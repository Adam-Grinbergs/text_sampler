 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-1 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

1 . 0  S U M M A R Y  

This Technical Report describes the scope, design features, and economic viability 
of the Mactung project.  The property, owned by North American Tungsten 
Corporation Ltd. (NATC), is located in southeast Yukon, Canada and is adjacent to 
the Northwest Territories (NWT).  

The project is an underground mine utilizing a combination of long-hole blast and 
mechanized cut-and-fill mining methods.  The ore is delivered to the mill by conveyor 
and subsequently processed through gravity and flotation concentration circuits at 
the rate of 2,000 tonnes per day (t/d).  Construction will occur over a 27 month period 
at a capital cost of $402.1 million; commercial production is scheduled to commence 
during the first quarter of 2013, and will continue for 11.0 years.  All currencies in this 
report are expressed in Canadian dollars (CDN$) unless otherwise noted. 

For the expected 11.0 year mine life and 8 million tonne (Mt) reserve, Wardrop 
Engineering Inc. (Wardrop) used the Goodall Business and Resource Management 
Pty Ltd. (GBRM) preliminary market review that was commissioned by NATC as 
source for tungsten metal price for the economic evaluation of the Mactung project. 

The project is expected to produce an average of 640,000 metric tonne units (mtu) 
(14.0 million pounds (lb)) of tungsten for each year of the expected mine life.  Based 
on GBRM's market forecast of US$255/mtu for gravity concentrate, US$300/mtu for 
Ammonium Paratungstate (APT) concentrate, and an exchange rate of 0.88 
(US$/CDN$), the project has a pre-tax Internal Rate Return (IRR) of 23.5% and a 
pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of CDN$276.8 million at an 8.0% discount rate, with 
recovery of capital within 2.9 years. 

The Mactung project will draw skilled workers from the operating Cantung mine, 
which is owned and operated by NATC.  On-site diesel-powered generators will 
generate electrical power for operations. 

The Mactung scheelite skarn deposit contains mineral reserves of 8.5 Mt, at an 
average grade of 1.082% WO3.  Long-hole stoping enables mining of the majority of 
the ore at a high production rate, while mechanized cut-and-fill stoping will mine the 
thinner and steeper ore.  

The design of the process plant is based on a series of metallurgical tests conducted 
in 1985, along with processing experience gained from the existing Cantung Mine.  
On average, the plant is designed to recover 82% of the metal in the form of a 
scheelite concentrate with a gravity concentrate grade of 67% WO3 and a flotation 
concentrate grade of 55% WO3.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-2 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The dry-stack nature of the tailings provides backfill for the underground mine 
operation, eliminates the need for a permanent tailings dam and impoundment, and 
allows for the re-establishment of the natural drainage paths at the end of the mine 
life.  An application for assessment has been filed through the Yukon Environmental 
and Socio-economic Assessment Act (YESAA) process during the fourth quarter of 
2008.  Extensive local community and First Nations consultation programs are 
ongoing. 

1 . 1  G E O L O G Y  

NATC retained Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) in 
2005 to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and a National Instrument 
43-101 (NI 43-101)-compliant Technical Report on the Mactung tungsten deposit.  

Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on August 19, 2005 and August 8, 2007.  The 
following sub-sections 1.1.1 (Mineralization) and 1.1.2 (Mineral Resource Estimate) 
were extracted from Scott Wilson RPA's Technical Report. 

1.1.1 MINERALIZATION 

The Mactung mineralization can be characterized as a metasomatic skarn deposit 
formed by magmatic hydrothermal fluids originating from a Cretaceous granitic stock.  
The deposit comprises an Upper and Lower mineralized skarn zone separated by 
100 m of hornfelsed pelitic sediments.  The Lower zone, while dipping in the same 
general direction as the Upper zone, contains a "Z" fold, with an amplitude of about 
90 m. 

Scheelite is the economic mineral of interest at Mactung; wolframite is reported only 
occasionally.  Scheelite occurs predominantly with pyrrhotite in the pyroxene-
pyrrhotite facies, wherein the scheelite content increases and grain size decreases 
with pyrrhotite content.  Minor scheelite also occurs in the garnet facies, and is 
coarser grained than that of the pyrrhotite facies. 

1.1.2 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The kriged estimate contains an indicated mineral resource of 33.0 Mt grading 0.88% 
WO3, or 290 kilotonnes (kt) of contained WO3.  An additional resource of 11.9 Mt 
grading 0.78% WO3, or 92 kt WO3, has been estimated for the inferred category.  
These estimates, which are based on assays capped at unique levels for each zone, 
are reported at a block cut-off of 0.5% WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers 
appropriate for the location and cost profile that can be expected for Mactung.

1.1.3 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 

Wardrop calculated the mining cut-off grade at 0.616% WO3 based on the cost 
estimates obtained from Wardrop's economic study of the Mactung Project in 
October 2007.  The calculation of the mineral reserves was limited in extent to the 
Yukon-NWT border.

Two underground stoping methods will be used: long-hole (LH) stoping and 
mechanized cut-and-fill (MCF).  The use of these methods is determined by the 
geometry, dip, thickness, and strength of rock.  LH will mine 89% of the ore and the 
remaining 11% will be extracted by MCF.  Table 1.3 shows the annual production 
rate, ore grade and tungsten concentrate.

The key design criteria included in the mining plan are: 

• The underground mine design is based on the indicated mineral resources 
inside Yukon. 

• A cut-off grade of 0.616% WO3 has been used in the mine design. 

• LH stoping will be the primary mining method, and will achieve high 
productivity and low operating costs. 

• LH stopes are designed at 17 m wide and 60 m long, with 4-m rib pillars 
between the primary and secondary stopes.  There will be a 4-m transverse 
pillar between stopes on the same stope line.   

• MCF stopes are designed at 17 m wide, with 3-m permanent rib pillars along 
the strike of the orebody in areas 12 m thick or less, and/or in areas dipping 
more than 20%. 

• Several stopes will be mined simultaneously to meet the planned production 
rate of 2,000 t/d and to improve blending of ore for grade control. 

• LH and MCF mined out stopes will be backfilled using dewatered mill tailings 
and waste from the waste developments to optimize ore recovery and 
stabilize the ground. 

• The underground mine will be operated in marginal permafrost conditions. 

Ore will be hauled and dumped through an orepass to an underground crusher 
station, where it will be crushed by a primary jaw crusher.  Crushed ore will be 
transported by a 512-m long conveyor belt up an incline to an ore bin at the surface.  
Dewatered tailings will be transported underground by a conveyor belt running in 
parallel with the ore conveyor in the same decline.  The tailings will be deposited in a 
stockpile at the crusher station, where it will be loaded into haul trucks and hauled to 
the mined-out stopes as backfill. 

The mine will operate without heating of ventilation air flow to preserve the marginal 
permafrost conditions.  In the event permafrost conditions are not sustained during 
the summer, pumps will be installed to dewater the underground workings. 

Mining operations will be carried out with an equipment fleet consisting of two long-
hole down-the-hole (DTH) production drills, three 5-m3 load-haul-dump (LHD) units, 
and five 30-t haul trucks.  The primary equipment will be supported by development 
equipment, rock bolters, graders, ANFO loaders, dozers, and personnel carriers.

The Mactung project process plant will treat scheelite ore at the rate of 2,000 t/d, or 
730,000 tonnes per year (t/a).  The plant design is based primarily on metallurgical 
testwork conducted by Lakefield Research in 1985, and processing experience from 
the existing Cantung Mine in the NWT.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-5 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The feed to the process plant will have a nominal tungsten grade of 1.30% WO3, 
which could vary from as low as 1.00% WO3 to as high as 1.75% WO3.  The total 
scheelite concentrate recovery will be 82%.  The process will consist of a gravity 
circuit, which will recover about 55% of the total scheelite concentrate at a grade of 
67% WO3, while the flotation circuit will recover about 27% of the total scheelite 
concentrate with a grade of 55% WO3.  Head grades below 1.30% will reduce the 
recovery to less than 82% recovery, while higher grades will conversely result in 
higher recoveries.  

The treatment processes as designed will involve comminution followed by the 
rejection of sulphide minerals and the concentration of scheelite.  Sulphide minerals 
will be rejected via wet magnetic separation and several sulphide flotation stages.  
The scheelite concentrate from the gravity circuit will be further upgraded through 
sulphide flotation and dry magnetic separation methods to reach the target tungsten 
grade and impurity specification limits.  Scheelite flotation concentrate will receive no 
further upgrading at the mine. 

All plant tailings will be thickened, filtered, and then either transported to the 
underground workings as back-fill, or to the surface tailings disposal location.  
Process water from the tailings thickener overflow will be directed to the ageing 
pond, where it will remain for 30 days before re-use so as to mitigate the possible 
influence of residual reagents and chemicals on the process. 

The processing facilities will include the following unit operations: 

• three-stage crushing processes with the primary crushing stage situated 
underground and the secondary and tertiary crushing stages situated at the 
processing plant on the surface 

• a two-stage grinding circuit 

• thickening process 

• a two-stage wet magnetic separation process 

• bulk sulphide flotation circuit, which includes the sulphide concentrate 
regrind stage and the cleaner sulphide flotation circuit 

• bulk sulphide flotation tailings/gravity plant feed classification step 

• coarse gravity separation circuit including a two-stage spiral separation 
stage, followed by a two-stage table cleaning/upgrading tabling stage 

• fine gravity separation circuit including a two-stage spiral separation 
process, followed by a two-stage table cleaning/upgrading step 

• regrind circuit for the tailings and middlings from the coarse gravity 
separation circuit, and the table middlings only from the fine gravity 
separation circuits, followed by the sulphide flotation in the gravity regrind 
sulphide flotation circuit 

• gravity circuit concentrate sulphide flotation circuit

• gravity circuit concentrate dewatering circuit, including wet magnetic 
separation, concentrate drying, a dry magnetic separation process and the 
concentrate packaging 

• thickening of scheelite flotation feed 

• scheelite flotation circuit, including the rougher, scavenger, and three stages 
of cleaner flotation circuit 

• scheelite flotation concentrate dewatering, drying, and packaging 

• final tailings thickening, filtering for backfill and/or for dry stack disposal. 

1 . 4  T A I L I N G S  D I S P O S A L  

Mactung tailings will be thickened and filtered to facilitate their disposal either as 
backfill material underground, or as dry stacked tailings.  Half of the tailings material 
will be returned underground via a conveyor belt system and used as backfill in 
mined-out stopes.  The remaining 50% of tailings material will be trucked to a Dry-
stacked Tailings Facility (DSTF). 

Mactung's filtered tailings will be placed as backfill material in the mined out stope in 
an unconsolidated form.  The tailings have to be free draining and testing has to be 
performed to confirm the percolation rate.  The tailings material is recommended to 
have a minimum percolation rate greater than 10 cm/h (Hassani & Archibald 1998).  

The DSTF will be constructed as a sidehill fill structure with a 25% grade.  The facility 
will be constructed through a series of 600 mm lifts, which will then be compacted to 
95% of the maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D698 using a vibratory 
compactor to ensure maximum stability.  To further ensure structure stability an 
upstream diversion berm will be constructed to divert surface run-off water around 
the structure.   

A dam will be constructed downstream of the mine's footprint in order to collect all 
runoff from the tailings facility, and to create a catchment to age the process water 
before reuse.  The ravine dam was designed to a 1:100 year flood event and a 
1:1000 year seismic event, as suggested by the Canadian Dam Association for 
structures of significant consequence.  Material for dam construction will be a 
combination of locally-available materials and geosynthetics.  Geosynthetic materials 
must be used due to a lack of high-quality aggregates and low-permeability core 
material.  These materials will be primarily used to construct drains and the dam's 
core, and for erosion protection.

The infrastructure planned at Mactung to support the mining and processing 
operations includes: 

• Forty-eight km of access roads to provide access from the existing North 
Canol Road to the project site.  Based on fieldwork conducted in May 2008, 
it was recommended to undertake a follow up assessment of snow melt in 
the area and to develop a hazard management plan for the access road and 
mine site.  As no avalanche protection was incorporated into the road 
design, subsequent engineering work will plan to re-align the road route to 
minimize potential avalanche hazards. 

• An airstrip, which is owned and maintained by the Government of Yukon.  
NATC will upgrade the airstrip to 1,375 m long by 30 m wide to 
accommodate a Beechcraft 1900 or similar aircraft. 

• Fresh water that will be pumped from the Hess River tributary to the plant 
site by a pipeline approximately 10-km long that is insulated and heat traced.  
The fresh water and fire water will be stored in one 10 m by 11 m diameter 
fresh/fire water tank.  Potable water will be stored in a 4.2 m by 4.2 m 
diameter tank.  The fresh water and process tanks will be insulated and 
heated.  A hypochlorinator will be provided for water treatment. 

• On-site waste disposal to minimize or eliminate the requirement for off-site 
waste removal services.  Grey water will be piped through the heated 
utilidors to a sewage treatment plant.  Solid waste will be transported to the 
dry stack tailings area and deposited along with the tailings. 

• Ancillary facilities consisting of the truckshop/warehouse, administration 
building/mine dry, bunkhouse complex, and mess hall. 

• A power plant consisting of five diesel generators with heat recovery 
modules located adjacent to the process plant to minimize power distribution 
losses and connection costs.  There will be sufficient recovered heat to heat 
surface facilities in the winter.  Portable propane heaters will provide heat for 
surface facilities when waste heat is not available from the power plant. 

• Electrical power distributed throughout the mine site at 4.16 kilovolts (kV).  
Power will be delivered to the underground operations through a single 
4.16 kV underground tunnel power cable. 

• A telecommunication system will have adequate data, voice, and other 
communication channels available.  The system will include: 

q a voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) telephone system 

q satellite communications for voice and data 

q ethernet cabling and wireless internet access 

q leaky feeder communication system in the underground mine 

q satellite TV.

The Mactung project will be reviewed under YESAA, a federal act that sets the 
process and conditions for environmental and socio-economic effects assessments.  
The Mactung project will trigger an Executive Committee Screening to be conducted 
by the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board (YESAB).  

The YESAA process has specified timelines associated with work conducted by the 
Board.  Efficiencies in the timing of the assessment may be achieved through:   

• completeness of the project proposal 

• responsiveness of the proponent 

• clear description of the project 

• accessibility of the proposal's content 

• active communication with groups to be consulted. 

NATC has collected an extensive amount of environmental baseline data from the 
site to date and continues to collect additional data to ensure adequacy of the project 
proposal for the assessment process.  

The project will require two main permits: a Type A Water Licence and a Quartz 
Mining License (QML).  The Type A Water Licence, is issued through the Yukon 
Water Board in accordance with the Yukon's Water Act.  The process to obtain this 
permit is not expected to pose a significant hurdle for the project.  

The QML adheres to the Government of Yukon's Quartz Mining Act, and is 
administered by Government of Yukon's Department of Energy, Minerals, and 
Resources.  The QML is issued in two parts to advance non-water related works 
associated with the project.  No significant obstacles are anticipated through this 
process. 

Other permits are required at different stages of the project; a comprehensive list of 
required licenses can be compiled once more detailed engineering has been 
completed.

NATC understands and respects the importance of minimizing the environmental 
impact of the mining project.  All practices of mining, processing, and auxiliary 
operations have been designed in accordance with best practices and an end goal of

returning the land as close to its natural state as practical.  The closure plan and 
environmental management system being developed by EBA Engineering Inc. (EBA) 
will provide for the site to be remediated to an acceptable standard. 

Progressive reclamation activities will be carried out throughout the mine life, but the 
major reclamation work will take place once mining is completed.  Mine closure 
reclamation will leave the site in a stable state with all measures taken to mitigate 
possible contamination and negative effects on the land. 

At the close of production all on-site structures will be removed, with all salvageable 
parts sold or recycled and the remainder disposed of appropriately, some non-
salvageable waste and structures may be placed in the underground workings.  All 
hazardous material will be removed from site and appropriately disposed of. 

Responsibility for the resource access road is expected to be handed over to the 
Government of Yukon if the road is deemed an asset.  

Closure will require that the dry-stacked tailings pile will be properly capped in 
accordance with industry best practices.  The process water aging and runoff storage 
pond will be recontoured, and the natural runoff channels will be re-established by 
decommissioning the Ravine Dam.  A directed program will be put in place to ensure 
that the natural drainage pattern is returned to the site, including making the existing 
stream continuous once again from its headwaters to the confluence of Tributary A. 

Periodic inspection and monitoring of the site post after closure will be required 
pursuant to the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER) for a period of three years 
following closure.

Wardrop used the GBRM market study that was commissioned by NATC as the 
source for tungsten metal price for the economic evaluation of the Mactung project.  
This summary was taken from the GBRM's market study entitled "A Preliminary 
Review of Tungsten". 

1.11.1 PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY 

Tungsten prices (both concentrate and APT) remained extremely low during the 
1990s and in fact well below the true cost of production.  As a direct result, 
exploration and mine development programs were almost totally abandoned. 

However, commencing in the early part of this decade, the global market structure for 
tungsten began to change, particularly driven by a rapid increase in domestic 
demand of tungsten products in China.  This signalled to the global market, two key 
issues: 

• The rapid increase in demand in China would tighten raw material 
availability to other markets, particularly given the Chinese Government 
policy of curtailing mining programs to maintain reserves for future domestic 
requirements. 

• The Chinese program of developing downstream processing would place 
increased pressure on processing companies outside China.  In order to 
remain competitive and secure sufficient base concentrates, these 
companies urgently needed to develop alternative supplies outside China. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-12 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Recognition of these circumstances has since led to a significant increase in 
exploration and mine development activities in Vietnam, Australia, and in North and 
South America.  However despite this increased activity, no new major production 
has actually been realized and this is unlikely to occur until 2010 at the earliest. 

The lack of new production has been recognized by Chinese processors which have 
recently entered into a number of agreements with companies such as King Island 
Scheelite and NATC in order to assist development through input of capital and off-
take agreements. 

1.11.2 CONSUMPTION 

The consumption of tungsten is reasonably broad based, both in industrial and 
geographical terms.  Major applications are metal-cutting tools, drill bits, light bulb 
filaments, high temperature alloys, x-ray shielding, military use, and chemical 
applications.  Regionally, the largest consuming area is China, followed by Europe 
and North America.  China also has by far the fastest growth; however India is also 
showing signs of rapid growth in demand albeit from a low base. 

Over the next five years to the end of 2012, global consumption of tungsten is 
expected to increase from its current level of approximately 85,000 t W (64,500 t W 
virgin tungsten) tonnes per annum to 110,000 t W (82,000 t W virgin tungsten) 
tonnes.  Mature markets such as Europe and North America are only expected to 
grow by an average of 2% per annum. 

Chinese domestic consumption is forecast to continue growing in excess of 10% per 
annum, largely driven by the increase in requirements for cutting and drilling tools.  
However, it should also be noted that China's growth over the past five years has 
averaged 15% and if these levels were to be maintained world tungsten demand will 
exceed 122,000 t W (91,500 t W virgin demand) by 2012. 

1.11.3 PRICE STRUCTURES 

As a result of the constant over-supply situation through the 1990s and early 2000s, 
prices fell to low levels of US$45/mtu for concentrates and only marginally higher for 
APT.  However, a number of important events have since occurred, which has 
greatly influenced current and forward price structures. 

China has not only curtailed domestic mining programs, but has now become a 
significant importer of tungsten concentrates and tungsten scrap.  Also the Chinese 
Government has moved from a position of providing export incentives for tungsten 
exports to now introducing production and export quotas, and consistently increasing 
export tariffs. 

The net result of these changes coupled with the continuing growth in global demand 
has resulted in strong price increases commencing in 2004, to a current level of 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-13 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

approximately US$220/mtu for concentrates and US$250-$260/mtu for APT (quoted 
price by Asian Metal News May 2008). 

With the Chinese Government strongly encouraging an even higher level of 
downstream processing, with a large percentage of these downstream products 
being consumed domestically, plus expected further increases in export tariffs for 
semi processed products, the availability of tungsten units to markets outside China, 
in all forms, will continue to tighten.  Furthermore, China has now become a major 
importer of tungsten concentrates and scrap. 

The net result of these changing circumstances, continued strong growth in China's 
consumption, the recognition of increasing costs to develop and operate mines 
outside China, plus the fact that tungsten has a 'high value in use' in most 
applications and substitution is unlikely, result in the conclusion that a continuing 
escalation in price structures is highly likely.  During the next five years, it is forecast 
that global prices for APT will reach or even exceed US$300/mtu. 

1.11.4 OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW PRODUCERS 

The projected strong growth in tungsten demand over the period 2007-2012 will 
require the development of between 33-45 kt W of new production. 

Analysis of current projects that are in the feasibility study stage indicates that even if 
the majority come on stream, the market will continue in tight supply through to 2012 
and onwards.  Many of the tungsten projects that are in the early stage of 
assessment that could be brought into production from 2012 onwards, are based on 
much lower WO3 grades than the projects currently under feasibility and will require 
stable tungsten prices at high levels to be feasible. 

Consequently there is a definite requirement for the development of larger 
(+4,000 t/a W) mines with 15-20 year mine life in order to support long-term market 
demand.  These types of world-class deposits are rare and of the projects under 
feasibility study only.  NATC's Mactung deposit is capable of achieving these 
production rates over 10 years plus.   

This project is currently scheduled to come on line in 2013, with production of 
30,000 t W over its initial 5 years of operation.  Projections are that the market will 
clearly require this additional production by 2013 and could in fact accommodate an 
earlier start-up. 

In addition to Mactung there are only four other projects under feasibility: Vital Metals 
Watershed Project (Australia), King Island Scheelite's King Island Project (Australia), 
the Nui Phao deposit in Vietnam, and the Hemerdon deposit in the UK that are 
projecting production levels of between 2,000-4,000 t/a W. 

Barriers of entry for a new producer outside China with a good grade tungsten 
deposit are expected to be minimal.  In the projected strong market, long term letters 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-14 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

of intent to purchase either concentrates or APT should be readily achievable and 
these would assist to underwrite project finance.   

1.11.5 PRELIMINARY MARKET REVIEW CONCLUSIONS 

The global market for tungsten is forecast to maintain strong growth over the next 
five years and beyond.  While China continues to dominate world mining and primary 
processing, the availability of tungsten units to non Chinese markets will continue to 
decline.  A strong escalation in prices has already occurred over the past three 
years.  However with producers struggling to meet demand, global mining costs 
continuing to increase, mining grades dropping, and the Chinese Government likely 
to impose tighter production quotas and higher export tariffs to maintain reserves, 
further global price escalation appears certain. 

Barriers of entry for new producers are relatively low apart from actual development 
costs, and new mine projects will continue to receive strong encouragement from 
processors both in and outside China. 

While there are a number of other projects at various stages of development, from 
exploration to bankable feasibility study, the timing to bring these projects into 
production is proving to be considerably longer than originally projected. 

Consequently, for the long term stability of supply, consumers are keen to form 
relationships that will assist in the development of the larger, longer term producers 
with good grade tungsten deposits.

Wardrop based the economic evaluation of the Mactung project on a pre-tax and 
post-tax financial model.  For the expected 11.2-year mine life and 8.0 Mt reserves, 
Wardrop used the GBRM Preliminary Market Review that was commissioned by 
NATC as the source for tungsten metal price for the economic evaluation.  Wardrop 
calculated the following base case pre-tax financial results based on GBRM's 
forecast of tungsten. 

• 23.5% IRR 

• 2.9 years payback on CDN$402.1 million capital 

• CDN$276.8 million NPV at 8% discount value. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-15 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The base case is calculated using an APT price of US$300/mtu.  Refer to section 
26.0 Market Review for more detailed commodity pricing information. 

The post-tax model was provided by NATC and audited by W.H. Taylor Inc. 
calculating the following: 

• 17.6 % IRR 

• 3.2  year payback on US$402.1 M initial capital 

• CDN$ 147.7 M NPV at an 8.0% discount rate. 

Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the project economics.  These 
analyses are presented graphically as financial outcomes in terms of NPV and IRR.  
The project NPV is most sensitive to the foreign exchange rate and in decreasing 
order: head grade, price, operating costs, and capital costs. 

Similarly, the project IRR is most sensitive to foreign exchange rate, head grade, and 
initial capital costs.

The identification of risks early on and the timely mitigation of those risks will 
enhance the project's continuous operation.   

The following outlines the major risks and mitigation of these risks: 

• Delays in project schedule result from equipment delivery delays: mitigation 
of equipment delays is done through timely procurement of long-lead items 
as identified in advanced engineering. 

• Non-availability of key construction personnel: plan a smooth transition of 
personnel from the Cantung Mine, early placement of contracts and initiate 
prompt and effective personnel recruitment. 

• Seasonal river crossing: increase inventory rate of essential materials to 
ensure continuity of construction and the subsequent operations.   

• Initial production: monitor and advance detail engineering work to ensure 
timely pre-production mine development, assess mining extraction 
sequences, and milling operational delays during start-up. 

• Fuel price sensitivity: monitor and control fuel consumption, optimize the 
heat recovery from the diesel generators and advance the evaluation of wind 
energy as a supplementary power source.

• The marginal permafrost impacts on working conditions in the underground 
mine.  Perform permafrost and hydrogeological investigation to understand 
permafrost temperature sensitivity and rockmass permeability. 

• Backfill operations: establish equipment and personnel safety through 
enhancements of work procedures and the application of remote equipment 
operation during backfill of mined-out stopes. 

• Unconsolidated backfill: investigate marginal permafrost and 
hydrogeological conditions to determine the impact on backfill stability and 
the requirement for backfill bulkheads. 

• Advance numerical modelling to predict induced mining stress on excavation 
openings and pillar configuration for optimization. 

• Dry stack tailings slope failure: facility is designed to the standards and 
placed upstream of the run-off dam. 

• Ravine dam: dam is designed to safe slope standards and appropriately 
lined to prevent leakage. 

• Avalanche hazard: protection from avalanche run-out to the tailings and site 
facilities such as the mill and power plant will be considered in detailed 
design.  Road access will require active avalanche management to 
maximize the construction season as well as safety.

A number of potential opportunities have been identified. 

• Geology: 

q Improve the reliability of the mineral resource estimates in the upper 
zones and in the periphery and northerly portions of all zones to identify 
additional higher grade ore.  

q Convert the inferred mineral resources to indicated category to possibly 
complement the higher grade ore and add to the life of the mine hence, 
fostering positive economic benefit to the project. 

• Mining: 

q The feasibility of decreasing the mine breakeven cut-off grade based on 
the feasibility study economics will potentially increase the mineral 
reserves and lengthen the life of underground resulting in increased 
value for the project. 

q A detailed investigation of the permafrost condition will provide a better 
understanding of the ground conditions resulting in potential cost 
savings in ground support requirement for the underground mine. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 1-18 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

q A better understanding of the backfill behaviour will promote confidence 
on the mining method and achieve optimal extraction sequences thus 
improving productivity and ore grades in the early years of mining. 

q Investigate the potential for an open pit to mine shallow grade ore to 
further enhance project economics.  This could potentially add 
significantly more years to the mine life. 

q Investigate underground mining of the shallow high grade ore to 
complement the open pit and therefore add more value to the project 
economics. 

• Metallurgy: 

q There are some opportunities for possible cost reductions with regards 
to the process equipment by confirming the 1985 pilot plant tests results. 

• Permit Requirements: 

q The centralized permit process would be beneficial to the project in 
obtaining timely permits for the early start up of construction in 2010. 

• Tailings Disposal: 

q Further optimization of the dry stacked tailings disposal and the method 
of handling and placing the dry tailings will potentially reduce costs and 
enhance confidence in the design. 

• Sustainability and Environmental Matters: 

q The development of an Environmental Management System (EMS) for 
the project will make available detailed information on spill and disaster 
response, waste materials handling and emergency contact information 
for the project. 

q The underground mining methods to be used at the Mactung mine are 
favourable to the effective management of waste materials to reduce 
potential long-term risks at the site.   

• Infrastructure: 

q As more site data is made available, re-design of buildings would focus 
on minimizing excavations, structures, and concrete quantities resulting 
in the reduction of site construction costs. 

q Further optimization of the power plant configuration would be an area 
under consideration during detailed engineering to reduce initial project 
capital.  

q Pre-fabrication of buildings off-site is an opportunity to be investigated to 
reduce the high cost of site work. 

q Conduct further optimization conveyor layouts for the ore and tailings 
handling systems. 

• Alternative Energy:

q Evaluate wind power as a renewable energy resource to supplement the 
diesel electric generation.  This could substantially reduce project 
operating cost over the long term due to projected high diesel fuel costs.

Wardrop developed three scenarios with varying economic parameters to evaluate 
the Mactung project on a pre-tax basis.  Based on the base case scenario for the 
project, an NPV of CDN$277 M at an 8% discount rate and an IRR of 23.5% were 
obtained using the forecast metal prices as recommended by GBRM. 

Sensitivity of the project was evaluated based on inputs such as metal price, 
exchange rate, grades, operating costs, and capital costs.  The project NPV is most 
sensitive to the foreign exchange rate and, in decreasing order, head grade, price, 
operating, and capital costs. 

On the basis of this study for the base case scenario with GBRM market projections, 
it is recommended to proceed with basic to detailed engineering, procurement, 
construction, and commissioning to target full production in 2013 Q1. 

Conclusions and recommendations for Geology, Mining, Metallurgy and Mill, 
Environmental Baseline Considerations and Risks, Tailings Disposal, Infrastructure, 
Capital Costs, Operating Costs, and Project Execution Plan are outlined in Section 
17.0 – Conclusions and Recommendations.

This NI 43-101-compliant report has been prepared by Wardrop for NATC based on 
work performed by the following companies: 

• Scott Wilson RPA: geology and mineral resource estimate 

• Wardrop: mining, processing, infrastructure, capital (excluding Construction 
Management costs), and operating costs, and financial analysis (based on 
GBRM metal price forecasts) 

• Wardrop:  NATC provided basic information of their drilling database on 
length, core recovery, and geological description in terms of Mactung 
geological rock codes.  Wardrop determined the geotechnical parameters for 
the geotechnical evaluation contained in Section 18.6 from a visual 
assessment of core photographs from 22 boreholes from the MS-series 
diamond drill holes.  This series was selected because its rock quality 
designation (RQD), one of the parameters for rock mass quality, had been 
previously determined. 

• Merit Consultants International Inc. (Merit): construction management costs 

• GBRM: preliminary market review and metal prices 

• EBA: tailings disposal, environmental, socio-economic assessment and 
permitting regime reclamation, decommissioning, and closure.  

In compliance with NI 43-101, NATC filed with SEDAR the "Technical Report on the 
Mactung Tungsten Deposit, MacMillan Pass, Yukon" as prepared by Scott Wilson 
RPA on April 18, 2007.  This report, including a 3D block model of the deposit, was 
used in the mining study. 

Wardrop has prepared this Technical Report to define the scope, design features, 
and the economics of the project to an accuracy of ±15%.  The project is based on 
mining an underground tungsten ore deposit using a combination of long-hole blast 
and mechanized cut-and-fill mining methods.  The project is expected to produce 
about 7 million mtu of tungsten over an 11.0 year mine life. 

NATC is a Canadian mining company listed on TSX Venture Exchange.  It owns two 
tungsten deposits: Mactung in Yukon, and Cantung in the NWT.  The Mactung 
deposit has been characterized as one of the world's largest tungsten deposits and 
ranked as the largest undeveloped skarn-type deposit (USGS, 1998). 

Many of the documents reviewed in the preparation of this report come from a library 
of Amax drawings and reports, accumulated between 1963 and 1985, and are now 
housed in NATC's Whitehorse office.  Copies of these reports were provided to

Peter Lacroix (P.Eng.), Associate Mining Engineer with Scott Wilson RPA, prepared 
the geology, mineral resource, and related sections in conjunction with Barry Cook, 
(P.Eng.), also from Scott Wilson RPA.  Barry Cook visited the Mactung property on 
August 19, 2005 and Peter Lacroix visited the site on August 8, 2007. 

Andy Nichols (P. Eng.), Associate Mining Engineer with Wardrop, visited the site on 
August 8, 2007 and is the QP for matters relating to mining and ventilation.  

The personal inspections undertaken by Peter Lacroix and Andy Nichols are still 
relevant to support the NI 43-101 Technical Report.  The subsequent work programs 
conducted in the summer of 2008 are in support of the surface observations and site 
selections for the mill and other facilities made during the site visit.  Discussion with 
Peter Lacroix and Andy Nichols confirmed that there is no material change to the 
technical information of the surface observed during the site visit. 

Richard Trimble (P.Eng.), Project Director with EBA, visited the Mactung property in 
the summer of 1983 to complete a detailed geotechnical drilling program.  Richard 
Trimble subsequently visited the site in 2005 and 2006 to complete aerial 
reconnaissance of the proposed infrastructure.

The Mactung property is located in the Selwyn Mountain Range and covers the area 
around Mt. Allan on the Yukon/NWT border, approximately 8 km northwest of 
MacMillan Pass (Figure 4.1).  The nearest settlement accessible by road, Ross 
River, is 250 km away to the southwest along the Canol Road, a drive that takes 
about 6 hours.  A ferry at Ross River and the Canol Road are maintained by the 
Yukon Territorial Government in the summer only.  The property is located at latitude 
63°17'N and longitude 130°10'W, and the Cantung Mine is approximately 160 km to 
the south.

4 . 1  C L A I M  S T A T U S  

The Mactung property comprises 113 mineral claims and 38 mining leases in Yukon 
and eight mining leases in the NWT, with a total area of 4,541.6 ha, or 11,217.7 ac 
(Figure 4.2).  Opinions on property title have been provided by NATC's legal counsel, 
Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP (FMC) (2007).  FMC reports that all mineral claims and 
leases pertaining to the Mactung property are in good standing as at May 14, 2007. 

In the 1970s, Amax had the then existing claims and leases surveyed by Underhill & 
Underhill (Now Underhill Geomatics) of Whitehorse.  The territorial border was 
surveyed by Paul S. Dixon C.L.S. in the period July 28 to August 5, 2003.  The 36 
grind claims staked in 2005 using a handheld GPS unit have not been surveyed.  
The claims and leases, none of which are patented, are contiguous and cover a 
single block of ground that straddles the Yukon/NWT border.  The Mactung mineral 
resource is located on mineral leases, mainly on the Yukon side of the border.  All 
leases and claims belong to NATC.  

4 . 2  R O Y A L T I E S  

Royalties on production are payable to the Yukon and NWT Governments under their 
respective mining legislation. 

There is also a reduced royalty of 1% payable to Teck Cominco Ltd. (Teck Cominco) 
upon payment of $100,000 in September 2005.  NATC has the option to pay 
$1,000,000 by the earlier of March 30, 2015 or 60 days after the receipt of a water 
licence issued in connection with any proposed mineral production on the property.  
If NATC has not exercised the option by March 30, 2010, it must pay an additional 
$200,000 to Teck Cominco on or before this date to extend the option.  The option to 
buy down the royalty will terminate if NATC misses any of the option payments to 
Teck Cominco.

The Mactung property is accessible from Ross River, a settlement 250 km southwest 
along the Canol Road.  This road is maintained by the Yukon Territorial Government 
as far as the NWT border in the summer only, and is only accessible while the ferry 
at Ross River is in operation.  The short section of the Canol Road in the NWT, 
between the border and the mine access road, is not maintained and is in poor 
driving condition.  The 11 km long access road from the Canol Road to the property 
itself is currently in fair driving condition. 

There are two airstrips locally, one near Tom Creek at MacMillan Pass, which is 
maintained by the Yukon Territorial Government and can accommodate light aircraft, 
and another at Tsichu River, the condition of which is not known but probably poor as 
it is not maintained by the NWT Government. 

5 . 2  C L I M A T E  

The area has a continental climate modified by the mountain setting.  The Tsichu 
River meteorological station was operated by Amax with assistance from the 
Atmospheric Environment Service from October 1974 to August 1982 (Kershaw and 
Kershaw, 1983).  The mean annual temperature for this period was -7.7°C, with a 
mean monthly minimum ranging from -30°C in December and January up to about 
+4°C in July.  For the same periods, the average monthly maximum temperature 
varied from -18°C to +15°C.  Temperature extremes for the Mactung property range 
from -42°C to +24°C, with a mean of -8.5°C.  The average annual precipitation is 
490 mm and snowfall 294 cm.  Midwinter snow pack varies from thin discontinuous 
on windswept sites to greater than 2 m in drifted areas.  Frosts occur in all the 
growing season months, but mean daily temperatures are above freezing from late 
May to mid-September.  Winds are most commonly from the west.

Labour and services are available from the adjacent communities of Yukon, Ross 
River, Faro, Mayo, and Watson Lake.  These communities have had considerable 
experience with the mining industry in the past.  

5 . 4  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  

The infrastructure is represented by an adit and associated underground workings 
that were driven into the Lower Zone (2B) ore horizon in 1973.  They are located on 
the Yukon side of the border at an elevation of 1,900 m.  Fresh water is available 
from the Hess River tributary downstream from the proposed plant site.  Diesel 
power generation is proposed due to the remote location of the project.  The main 
permits required for a producing tungsten mine include a Quartz Mining Licence and 
a Type A Water Licence.  A complete list cannot be provided at this time, as 
permitting requirements will be determined upon completion of project design and 
planning. 

5 . 5  P H Y S I O G R A P H Y  

The topography is rugged and the area has been glaciated.  Landforms include small 
glacier remnants, rock glaciers, glaciated surfaces, moraines, and fluvio-glacial 
deposits (Kershaw, 1976).  Rock talus slopes are common especially on Mount 
Allan.  The valleys on the Yukon side of the border are locally relatively narrow and 
steep sided, while those on the NWT side are broader and have shallower gradients.  
The valley floor lies at an elevation of about 1400 m, while the peak of Mount Allan is 
at 2200 m. 

The region is above the tree line and can be classified as arctic/alpine tundra.  The 
vegetation is better developed in valleys and is limited mainly to grasses, small 
shrubs, moss, and lichen (Kershaw and Kershaw, 1983).  Mountains, especially at 
higher elevations, are extensively covered with talus and intermittently with grasses, 
moss, and lichen. 

The predominant wildlife species in the area are moose, caribou, grizzly bears, 
wolves, and Dall's sheep, with smaller mammals such as voles, lemmings, 
chipmunks, shrews, ground squirrels, hares, and foxes.  Over 50 species of birds 
have been reported in the Mactung area, with 40 species using the area for breeding 
purposes.  No fish were discovered by surveys in 2005, but some were identified in 
earlier surveys by Amax.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

6 . 0  H I S T O R Y  

The historical description of the Mactung property has been taken from the 
"Technical Report on the Mactung Tungsten Deposit, MacMillan Pass, Yukon" 
prepared by Scott Wilson RPA for NATC (April/May 2007). 

6 . 1  1 9 6 2  –  1 9 7 2  

The Mactung deposit was discovered in 1962 by James Allan, an Amax geologist, 
probably as a result of follow-up prospecting to a regional stream sediment survey 
carried out as part of the Ogilvy Reconnaissance Project (Allan, 1963).  The deposit 
was originally known as MacMillan Pass Tungsten and then as MacMillan Tungsten 
before it became known as Mactung. 

During the years 1963 to 1967, Amax completed geological mapping, rock 
geochemical sampling, magnetometer surveying, and grid geochemical soil sampling 
on the property.  The 5 surface diamond drill holes completed in 1968 (1,513 m) 
were followed by 11 km of access road construction from the Canol Road to the 
property in 1970, and an additional 21 surface diamond drill holes (2,313 m) in 1971 
and 48 holes (6,956 m) in 1972.   

6 . 2  1 9 7 3  –  1 9 8 0  

In 1973, an adit was collared at the 1,890 m elevation and 726 m of lateral 
development and 27 m of raising were completed in the Lower Zone.  A 295-t bulk 
sample was excavated and shipped to an Amax facility in Colorado for metallurgical 
testing.  Every second round taken in the adit was crushed and then sampled using a 
Jones Riffle (Splitter).  A total of 43 underground holes (1,653 m) were drilled from 
the adit to better define the mineralization in the Lower Zone, stratigraphically known 
as the "2B" horizon.  Further surface diamond drilling was done in 1979 (Table 6.1), 
and another 49 m of underground development was done in 1979, with nine 45-
gallon barrels of mineralized skarn blasted for metallurgical test purposes.  The last 
surface drilling conducted by Amax was in 1980.   

6 . 3  1 9 8 1  –  1 9 8 5  

Ongoing environmental and feasibility studies, including an examination of local flora 
and fauna, archaeology, geomorphology, air quality, water quality, and soil studies 
that commenced in the early 1970s continued until 1985 when falling tungsten prices 
caused work on the project to stop. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 6-2 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Nearly all the diamond drill core was relogged during the period 1982 to 1985.  This 
work was undertaken by D. Atkinson (1982, 1983); D. Baker (1982); J. MacMillan 
(1984, 1985); J. Mustard (1985) and L. Erdman (1985).  As most drill holes have 
been logged on several different occasions at differing levels of detail, it will be a 
challenge to summarize the information to produce a single diamond drill hole record 
for each drill hole.  The drill core that remains, which is no longer a complete record 
of the drilling because it has been extensively sampled and resampled, is stored at 
the Cantung Mine. 

6 . 4  1 9 8 6  –  1 9 9 6  

Amax sold the Mactung property to Canada Tungsten Mining Corporation (CTMC) in 
1986 as part of a larger sale that also included the Cantung mine.  CTMC merged 
with Canamax Resources and Minerex Resources in 1993, to become Canada 
Tungsten Inc.  In August 1994, Aur purchased a 48% interest in Canada Tungsten 
Inc. and subsequently, in January 1997, the two companies merged.   

6 . 5  1 9 9 7  –  2 0 0 7  

In October 1997, the property, along with the Cantung Mine and other Aur assets, 
was sold to NATC, the present owner. 

In 2005, NATC drilled 25 surface diamond drill holes (6,639 m) to better define the 
west end of the deposit and to upgrade the resource classification of some mineral 
resource blocks from the "Inferred" to "Indicated" category.  Also one old drill hole 
was "twinned".  The adit was rehabilitated and a bulk sample of 79 tonnes in size 
taken for metallurgical test purposes. 

During 2005 and 2006, EBA restarted environmental studies partly to confirm 
previous work done by Amax, and partly to prepare for new environmental and 
mining permit applications; this work is ongoing. 

In compliance with NI 43-101, NATC filed with SEDAR the "Technical Report on the 
Mactung Tungsten Deposit, MacMillan Pass, Yukon" as prepared by Scott Wilson 
RPA on April 18, 2007.

These estimates, which, except for the Scott Wilson RPA estimate, are summarized 
by Atkinson and McNeil (1983), were made from 1973 to 2001 using a cut-off grade 
of 0.4% WO3 and minimum mining widths from 3.0 m to 4.5 m (10 ft to 15 ft).  The 
Mineral Resource estimated by Strathcona (1982) forms the basis for the potentially 
mineable reserves reported in the Mactung Project Scope Book (1984). 

In its 2001 detailed review, RPA used the Strathcona resource classifications to 
estimate the amount of proven and probable reserves and noted that, since the 
Mactung deposit had not yet been demonstrated to be economic, the potential 
reserves should be classified as Measured and Indicated Resources.  These 
resources, along with some prior estimates, are listed in Table 6.2.  The Strathcona 
report also included an additional Inferred Resource of 13,785,000 t grading 0.94% 
WO3 which is not compliant with the CIM classifications and should not be relied 
upon.  Part of the objective for the surface drilling carried out in the summer of 2005 
was to upgrade that part of these "inferred reserves" lying at the west end of the 
deposit to indicated resources.  The drill results from this work are included in the 
updated mineral resource described in this section.

The Mactung deposit is located in the eastern Selwyn Basin, an outer miogeoclinal 
basin that formed on the then western margin of the North American continent.  
Selwyn Basin refers to a region of deep-water, off shelf sedimentation that persisted 
from late Precambrian to Middle Devonian time (Gordey and Anderson, 1993).  The 
dominantly thin-bedded siliciclastic rocks (shale, chert, and basinal limestone) grade 
to the northeast into the thick-bedded carbonate sediments of the variably subsiding 
Mackenzie Platform.  Local stratigraphy of importance may include the Late 
Cambrian to Early-Middle Ordovician Gull Lake Formation (dolomitic siltstone and 
mudstone, slate, limestone conglomerate) and Rabbitkettle Formation (basinal silty 
limestone) and the Ordovician to Lower Devonian Road River Group which includes 
the Duo Lake Formation (black graphtolitic shale, laminated chert, and minor 
limestone) and the overlying Steel Formation (pyritic, locally wispy laminated, 
siliceous, locally dolomitic mudstone to siltstone).  Facies-changes between deep-
water clastic rocks (shale basin) and shallow water carbonate rocks (platform) are 
transitional.  

Mid-Devonian rifting and/or wrench faulting resulted in a regional marine 
transgression that abruptly terminated the Selwyn Basin phase of passive margin 
sedimentation.  An influx of marine, turbiditic, chert-rich clastic rocks (Earn Group) 
spread to the south and east from an uplifted source in northern Yukon and to the 
east from uplifted western portions of Selwyn Basin.  These clastics rocks, locally 
accompanied by mafic and less abundant felsic volcanism, blanketed all previous 
facies, covering Selwyn Basin sediments and onlapping onto the western Mackenzie 
platform.  The Selwyn Basin, as a distinct topographic entity, no longer existed. 

In Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time, the miogeocline was deformed by northeast-
directed compression caused by plate convergence and the accretion of pericratonic 
terranes onto North America.  The rocks of Selwyn Basin, relatively incompetent 
when compared to the carbonate rocks of the platforms, responded by thrust faulting 
and the development of open to tight similar folds.  Structural trends generally 
parallel the arcuate Paleozoic shale-carbonate facies boundary. 

Widespread Early to Late Cretaceous granitic magmatism intruded the deformed 
rocks of the miogeocline.  Five main intrusive suites are recognized, one of which, 
the Tungsten (97 Ma – 92 Ma), is responsible for a string of tungsten skarn deposits 
along the eastern flank of the former Selwyn Basin.

The rocks in the Mactung area are part of the west-trending Macmillan Fold Belt, 
which is discordant to the regional northwest structural grain.  This fold belt is 
interpreted to reflect a deep-seated Devonian fault zone that localized facies 
changes within the Earn Group and also responded differently to Mesozoic 
deformation.  Folding is tight and a narrow imbricate fault zone of southerly directed 
east-west trending thrust faults repeats Lower Cambrian to Devonian stratigraphy.  
South of the imbricate belt, open to closed folds and steep faults are the dominant 
structures. 

Stratigraphy in the general area of Mactung trends generally E-W, and dips from 10° 
to 40° to the south.  The axes of large folds also trend E-W and may have a shallow 
westerly plunge.  Several ages of high-angle normal faulting, of various orientations, 
are known in the area.  Strong slaty to fracture cleavage can be developed.  At least 
in the Paleozoic rocks, the grade of regional metamorphism is very low.  The area 
has been glaciated. 

Mactung is the most northerly of a group of W-Cu (Zn) skarn deposits strung out in a 
200 km long, northwesterly trending belt which roughly follows the NWT-Yukon 
boundary.  The Cantung deposit is about 160 km to the southeast of Mactung.  
These deposits are localized within thermal aureoles, typically above the altered 
apical zones of a suite of Late Cretaceous quartz-monzonite stocks.  At Mactung, the 
apparently related intrusive has been referred to variously as the Cirque Lake stock 
(Harris, 1977) or the Mactung pluton (Anderson, 1982 and 1983).

The property geology has been described by Dick and Hodgson (1982), Harris and 
Godfrey (1975), and Atkinson and Baker (1979). 

The Mactung mineralization occurs within a bedded sequence of altered limestones, 
shales and siltstones of Cambrian to Silurian age up to 230 m in thickness.  The 
deposit consists of scheelite-bearing skarns developed near the south contact of a 
granite intrusion, the Cirque Lake stock.  The main outcrop occurs in the NWT along 
a steep northerly sloping cliff on the north side of Mount Allan.  The watershed at the 
top of the cliff marks the border between the Yukon and the NWT in this region.  The 
main sedimentary sequence dips at low angles to the south.  The deposit comprises 
an Upper and a Lower Skarn Zone, with associated calcareous and pelitic sediments 
and their metamorphic equivalents, separated by 100 m of pelitic sediments, now 
largely metamorphosed to hornfels.  The hornfels is a light to dark brown or black 
and represents metamorphosed shales and siltstones with various amounts of 
muscovite, biotite and graphite.  Numerous thin veinlets of quartz or quartz carbonate 
containing pyrite, pyrrhotite, scheelite, and molybdenite cut the unit. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 7-3 1053390100-REP-R0001-00

A stratigraphic sequence has been established on the property, with nine mappable 
units distinguished and designated from oldest to youngest numerically I, 2B, 3C, 3D, 
3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, and 4 (Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2).  The following descriptions are 
taken from Atkinson and Baker (1979). 

Unit 1, the lowermost unit exposed on the property, is a heterogeneous brown to 
grey, thinly to moderately bedded clastic unit composed of interbedded mudstone, 
shale, siltstone and greywacke.  The unit is considered to be of lowermost Cambrian 
age; however, confirmation of this age must await more definitive work on the 
Hadrynian-Cambrian contact. 

Unit 2B, host to the Lower ore zone, is highly variable in thickness and composition.  
The unit is characterized by the presence of limestone slump breccias which appear 
to have formed as a series of coalescing debris fans at this stratigraphic level.  The 
unit has been correlated with the Lower Cambrian Sekwi Formation.  In outcrops on 
the North Face of Mount Allen, 20 m of dominantly well-bedded, fine-grained 
limestones and clastics with interbedded slump breccias are interpreted to represent 
the upslope extension of 35 m of chaotic, medium to light grey limestone slump 
breccia exposed in underground workings.  Down dip, these slump breccias abruptly 
thin and fragment size decreases as the slumps grade into a few centimetres of 
calcareous pelite as seen in southern drill holes.  South of these drill intersections, 
additional slump breccias also outcrop.  Slumps are chiefly lime or locally mud 
hosted.  Fragments include: limestone clasts, which may be fossiliferous containing 
Archaeocyathids, well-bedded or breccias; calcareous pisolites and ooids; 
phosphatic nodules; and various siliciclastic rocks including fragments of Unit 1.  
Clasts are generally elongate and range from a few millimetres up to 10 m in 
diameter.  Slumps rest locally with erosional unconformity on Unit 1, although, in 
southern drill intersections, the calcareous pelites of Unit 2B appear to conformably 
overlie shales of Unit 1. 

Unit 3C is in gradational contact with Unit 2B.  It consists of 100 m of black, pyritic, 
carbonaceous, fine-grained clastic rocks and rare thin limestone beds.  Numerous 
elongate clasts of mudstone, shale, siltstone, and collophane occur as separate 
distinct clasts, as intraformational conglomerates, and as boudinaged beds 
presumably disrupted by soft sediment deformation.  This unit separates the Lower 
and Upper ore zones.  Siliceous sponge spicules found in Unit 3C have been 
identified as Protospongia of broad Early to Middle Cambrian age. 

Unit 3D consists of 20 m of repetitively intercalated 2 cm to 1 m thick beds of calcic 
and phosphatic limestone slump breccias, mudstone, shale and siltstone that 
conformably overlie Unit 3C.  Slump breccias contrast with Unit 2B in that the breccia 
beds are characteristically thin and contain smaller, compositionally less variable, 
well sorted and bedded fragments.  Fragments include limestone clasts, black 
phosphatic nodules, and siliciclastic rocks.  Metasomatized calcic limestones within 
Unit 3D form the basal unit of the Upper ore zone. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 7-4 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Unit 3E is in gradational contact with Unit 3D, as slump breccias die out and the 
sequence becomes dominantly pelitic.  The unit consists of 60 m of finely 
interbanded black to brown mudstones, shales, and siltstones, with limestone beds 
scattered throughout.  The central portion of Unit 3E, with up to 20% limestone beds, 
hosts the middle part of the Upper ore zone. 

Unit 3F is similar to Unit 3E, consisting of 30 m of intercalated compositionally 
distinct layers commonly less than 10 cm in thickness.  The central part of Unit 3F 
contains up to 35% limestone beds which are host to the upper part of the Upper ore 
zone. 

Unit 3G, a 20 m thick cliff forming unit of light coloured talc-tremolite dolomite with 
thin shale interbeds, conformably caps the Upper ore zone. 

Unit 3H consists of 90 m of black, carbonaceous, pyritic, fissile shale which is 
characterized by strong limonite staining on surface exposures. 

Unit 4 consists of at least 50 m of black, carbonaceous, fossiliferous flagstones and 
shale.  Abundant graptolite fossils include late Ordovician species (all the above from 
Atkinson and Baker, 1979). 

The Lower zone, while dipping in the same general direction as the Upper zone, 
contains a "Z" fold (viewed down plunge to the west), with an amplitude of about 
90 m.  It has been suggested that in fact the fold is a fault, as there is significant fault 
material associated with it.  The Lower zone unconformably overlies the phyllite unit 
which comprises a substantial thickness of folded schistose micaceous phyllite of 
Cambrian age.  This rock forms the local base of the geological succession.   

The entire sequence is overthrust to the north, producing a recumbent isoclinal fold 
with an axis that plunges at a shallow angle (about 16°) to the west in the west, and 
at a shallow angle to the east at the eastern end of the deposit.  This gives the upper 
limb of the 2B horizon a slightly domed appearance. 

The Cirque Lake quartz monzonite stock cuts across the skarn succession on the 
north face of Mount Allan, penetrating the succession in large apophyses, dikes, and 
sills.  Samples taken from the granite are reported to contain from 4 ppm to 20 ppm 
tungsten, and variable amounts of molybdenum, beryllium, and tin. 

The deposit is cut and offset by numerous steeply dipping northerly trending faults.  
Some of the faults have displacements of up to 30 m or more, as interpreted by 
Strathcona (1982), and up to 45 m as recorded in the Mactung Project Scope Book 
(1984).  The faults are generally characterized by up to one metre of clay and sand 
gouge, with breccia zones of quartz, calcite, and ice-filled pore space.

The ore genesis at Mactung is characterized as a contact metasomatic skarn formed 
by magmatic hydrothermal fluids originating from a Cretaceous granitic stock.  The 
fluids migrated via channel ways to react with permeable limestone strata of Lower 
Palaeozoic age depositing scheelite mineralization.

The mineralogy of the Mactung deposit was described in detail by Dick and Hodgson 
(1982) and the alteration facies by the Mactung Project Scope Book (1984). 

The skarns associated with the metamorphosed limestone units may be divided into 
two main facies: garnet-pyroxene and pyroxene-pyrrhotite.  Scheelite occurs 
predominantly with pyrrhotite in the pyroxene-pyrrhotite facies.  In this facies, the 
scheelite content increases and grain size decreases with pyrrhotite content.  Minor 
scheelite also occurs in the garnet facies, and is coarser grained than that of the 
pyrrhotite facies. 

Scheelite occurs in five separate skarn horizons formed from lime rich layers in a 
300m thick sequence of Lower Cambrian metasediments that lie near the margin of a 
Cretaceous stock.  Locally, the rocks include phyllite (Unit 1), fragmental limestone 
(Unit 2B), hornfels (Unit 3C), calc silicate and pyrrhotite skarns, limestone, 
phosphatic limestone (Units 3D, 3E, 3F) and black shale (Unit 4). 

Pyrite is widely disseminated in some of the phyllite layers of the lower unit, with 
galena and sphalerite occurring in small quartz veinlets.  Scheelite is the economic 
mineral of interest at Mactung, with wolframite reported only occasionally in biotite 
skarn.  Chalcopyrite is the main base metal found in the deposit, but grades of 
economic value have not been demonstrated. 

The Upper Skarn unit, which is approximately 30 m thick, is composed of 
interbedded shale and white limestone that is often phosphatic because it contains 
fine grained apatite.  Scheelite and pyrrhotite occur in veins, fractures, and 
disseminations.  The limestone is generally recrystallized to white marble and 
varieties of skarn variably described as greenish, fine-grained diopside-hedenbergite, 
with local red-brown garnet with various amounts of pyrrhotite.  Tremolitic amphibole 
and biotite-rich skarns are described as occurring in patches, derived from pyroxene 
skarn.  The retrograde skarns are enriched in scheelite compared to the 
disseminated forms found elsewhere.  An argillite, siltstone, and hornfels unit of 
indeterminate thickness, containing interbedded limestone and marble, overlies the 
Upper Skarn and outcrops mainly to the west of the deposit. 

The main hornfels unit, which separates the Upper and Lower Skarn Zones, is 
approximately 100 m thick.  The hornfels is a light to dark brown or black and 
represents metamorphosed shales and siltstones with various amounts of muscovite, 
biotite and graphite.  Numerous thin veinlets of quartz or quartz carbonate cut the 
unit, containing pyrite, pyrrhotite, scheelite, and molybdenite.

The close spatial association with the tungsten deposit, the presence of abundant 
accessory garnet and quartz-tourmaline veins within the Cirque Lake stock led 
previous workers to suggest that hydrothermal fluids originated from this stock.  
However, Atkinson and Baker (1979) state that this simple interpretation was not 
compatible with critical geological observations, notably that no ore is developed in 
contact with the stock.  They concluded that the Mactung deposit is only 
coincidentally located near the contact with the Cirque Lake stock and that the 
source of mineralizing fluids is probably a blind stock located immediately south of 
Mactung.  Support for this theory is found in the work of Selby et al. (2003) who 
indicate that the U-Pb and Re-Os age data suggest that the exposed Mactung 
(Cirque Lake) stock is not the source of the ore-fluid for the tungsten skarns and that 
the progenitor pluton for the ore-fluid is unknown.

Between 1962, when the Mactung deposit was discovered and staked, and 1985, a 
total of about $26 million was spent by Amax on exploration and development, and a 
further $1.6 million was spent by NATC in 2005. 

Geological mapping, geochemical sampling, and magnetometer surveys were 
carried out in 1963, 1964, and 1967.  The deposit gave rise to patchy magnetic 
readings.  Surface diamond drill programs followed in 1968, 1971 and 1972, and an 
adit into the Lower Zone (2B) and an underground drill programme (43 drill holes 
totalling 1,653 m) were completed in 1973.  During the years 1974 to 1978, Amax 
changed their emphasis away from geology to environmental, metallurgical, and 
engineering studies.  In 1979, the adit was reopened and more bulk samples of the 
mineralization taken for metallurgical testing.  Another eight holes (668 m) were 
drilled from the underground workings, and another seven holes (1,113 m) on 
surface.  The year 1980 saw another ten surface holes completed (2,305 m).  From 
1982 to 1985, drill core was relogged, and extensive environmental and engineering 
studies completed, culminating in the Initial Environmental Evaluation in 1983 
(International Environmental Consultants, 1983) and the Mactung Project Scope 
Book (1984).  The property was dormant from 1985 until 2005, when DJ Drilling of 
Watson Lake, under contract to NATC, carried out a 25 hole (6,639 m) surface 
diamond drilling programme on the west and deeper end of the deposit.  At the same 
time, the adit was reopened and a metallurgical test bulk sample of approximately 
79 tonnes blasted by Mainstreet Mining of Whitehorse.  This sample is being held for 
possible future testing.  Environmental and permitting studies started the same year 
by EBA are ongoing.

Between 1968 and 2005, a total of 169 surface and underground diamond drill holes, 
with an aggregate depth of 23,158 m, were completed on the property.  Fifty-one of 
these holes (7,614 m) were drilled underground from the adit.  Strathcona states that 
93 of the Amax surface drill hole collars were surveyed, as well as 11 of the 51 
underground drill holes (Strathcona, 1982).  The remaining underground hole 
locations were determined from the underground development survey performed in 
1980 and the original diamond drill log.  Four surface holes drilled in 1980 were for 
testing of the mill site and tailings impoundment areas.  All of the 2005 drill collars 
were surveyed by Underhill Geomatics of Whitehorse using a differential GPS 
system.  In 1981 and 1982, the project site was resurveyed and the local mine grid, 
which exists in both imperial and metric forms, was reconciled to the UTM NAD27 
grid.  This work was updated in 2005 by Underhill Geomatics of Whitehorse who 
converted the NAD 27 collars to a NAD 83 datum that is currently in use. 

Most of the drill holes that intersected the deposit were collared on the south facing 
slopes of Mount Allan, and drilled at an angle of about seventy degrees to the north, 
which is approximately perpendicular to the dip of the sedimentary bedding in most 
of the deposit.  In the earlier drilling north-south drill hole section lines were spaced 
at intervals of 30 m (100 ft), but this was increased to 60 m (200 ft) in 2005 owing to 
the good continuity of the mineralization along strike from east to west.  Holes were 
generally placed from 40 m to 60 m apart up and down the dip of the mineralized 
horizons.  The closer spacing was indicated because there was more variability of 
both tungsten grade and of thickness of mineralization in this direction.

In plan, the Mactung deposit extends approximately 700 m from east to west with a 
maximum width of about 500 m from north to south.  Nearly all of the diamond drilling 
in the current computerized diamond drill hole database is within this area.  The 
original drilling by Amax from 1968 to 1980 was done on an imperial grid that had 
north-south drill section lines at 30 m (100 ft) intervals, with holes generally spaced 
along the lines at 30 m to 60 m intervals.  Drill core sample lengths were routinely 
1.5 m (5 ft), but varied from 0.3 m to 3.05 m with very minor exceptions. 

The drill core and samples have not been examined by Scott Wilson RPA; however, 
sample data in the form of drill logs, assay sheets, and the computerized diamond 
drill hole database have been reviewed and used in the current resource estimate.

The 2005 drilling program was designed to test the Lower Zone (2B) at the west end 
of the deposit where it was open on strike to the west.  All holes also incidentally 
intersected the Upper Zone.  The objective was to upgrade a large block of 
mineralization designated as "inferred reserves" by Strathcona, to the Indicated 
Resource category, and extend the known mineralization as far to the west as 
possible. 

The NQ size core recovered by the drillers was logged for geology and core 
recovery, and RQD measurements made.  Recoveries were at, or close to, 100% for 
the most part.  The core was also examined with a short wavelength ultraviolet lamp, 
which causes any scheelite on the surface of the drill core to fluoresce a bright bluish 
white, and visual estimates of the scheelite content made.  These estimates were 
typically overstated, but did provide a relative estimate of the grade that could be 
used as a check against the final assay results.  Because of the good continuity of 
the mineralization along strike from east to west, holes were drilled on north-south 
section lines that were 60 m apart on a grid.  This was done by extending the existing 
Amax grid to the west.  Holes were placed at 40 m to 60 m intervals up and down the 
dip of the mineralized horizons, because there was more variability of both tungsten 
grade and thickness of mineralization in this direction, which justified the closer 
interval.  Hole dips and bearings were measured with a "Flexit" down hole magnetic 
survey instrument, but only the dip was used, because the effects of any local 
pyrrhotite, some of which is magnetic, could not be predicted.  Some acid tests were 
also done.

Surface diamond drill hole MS 156 was collared beside old hole MT72071 and in the 
same direction and at the same dip.  The width and grade encountered in the "2B" 
horizon by these two holes were very similar (35.3 m grading 1.55% WO3 in hole 
MS156 and 32.0 m grading 1.66% WO3 in hole MT72071).

A 300 ton underground bulk sampling was sent to Colorado for metallurgical test 
purposes in 1973 (Amax Exploration, 1973).  The average calculated grade of the 55 
muck samples that were composited for this work was 1.66% WO3, while the 
average grade for all the muck samples in the bulk sampling area was 1.46% WO3.  
The averaged grade for a set of underground chip samples taken during the same 
summer was 1.62% WO3.  Grades are higher than the average grades for the Lower 
Skarn unit because the underground development passed through a higher grade 
portion of it.  Average calculated underground diamond drill hole grades were 
calculated by Strathcona to be highest closest to the walls of the adit at 1.73% WO3 
(Strathcona, 1982).  The average grade of the 28 channel samples taken in the adit 
in 2005 was also 1.73% WO3. 

Metallurgical test bulk samples were taken from both surface and underground in 
1979, and most recently a 79-t bulk sample was taken from underground in 2005.  
The grade and potential metallurgical recoveries of this last sample have not yet 
been determined.

crayon, and a metal tag with the sample number inscribed on it, nailed to the core 
box at the start of the sample run.  A pre-numbered paper sample tag was placed 
with it.  A record of the sample "from" and "to" was made in the sample book on the 
appropriate sample ticket stub.  This information was also recorded on the drill log 
along with the sample number and the recovered length of core, which was usually 
100%.  Diamond drill core, which was mainly sampled in lengths of 1.5 m, was split 
with a hydraulic core splitter set up in a room attached to the core storage shed on 
the Mactung property.  Some core was split with a diamond saw.  Once the sample 
was split, it was placed in a large polyethylene bag, which also had the sample 
number marked on it in black felt marker.  This bag was then placed inside a second 
identical bag and the paper sample tag placed between the two bags, which were 
then sealed with a single plastic tie.  The samples were transported in rice bags, 
each rice bag containing about five samples.  The rice bags were sealed with a 
numbered plastic security tie and shipped by commercial carrier from Whitehorse or 
Watson Lake to Global Discovery Laboratories (Global Discovery) in Vancouver.  
Sample pulps were shipped by Global Discovery to ALS Chemex of Vancouver and 
Becquerel Laboratories of Toronto for further assaying.

All duplicate testing for Mactung was performed on splits from the same pulps used 
for the original assays.  The duplicate program did not include analyses of separate 
splits from the core.  Consequently, the results from the various check assay 
programs at Mactung are primarily a measure of laboratory precision and accuracy 
rather than sample variability and/or bias.  Future programs should include analysis 
of separate splits of core to assess the variability in sampling.  Check assays were 
performed by a number of laboratories over the years, including Bondar Clegg of

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed analytical results and found that differences in the means 
for original and duplicate analytical results were statistically significant at a 95% 
confidence interval for two sets of paired original and check assays.  In both cases, 
the original assays were done at Amax's own laboratories, while the checks were 
performed at Chemex and Bondar Clegg respectively.  A scatter chart of original 
versus duplicate samples for the largest data set (Chemex) is depicted in Figure 
13.1, while Table 13.1 summarizes the results of t tests for paired duplicate samples 
from various labs, including the paired Amax/Chemex assays.

Where the absolute value of the t statistic exceeds the critical value for a 5% level of 
significance, the difference is said to be statistically significant at that level (i.e. there 
is at least a 95% probability that the difference is significant).  Those with high 
t statistics indicate a higher probability of statistically different means. 

While the analysis indicated that differences in means are statistically significant at a 
5% level of significance for two sets of paired data, the magnitude of the difference 
for the largest data set (Chemex colour) is only 5.3%.  Some laboratory bias likely 
exists in both the Chemex and Bondar Clegg colour assays when compared to the 
original Amax assays, although the bias is in opposite directions.  Irrespective of the 
potential for bias, the differences are not large in Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, and not 
material to the mineral resource estimates contained in this section.  In the 2005 
duplicate program (Becquerel), the difference between the means of the original and 
check assays is only 1%.

On August 19, 2005, R.B. Cook visited the Mactung property.  Andy Hureau provided 
an overview of the property geology and showed the writer cores of four drill holes 
from the surface drill program then in progress.  Under Cook's direction, the half core 
from three previously sawn samples was quarter sawn.  These samples were 
bagged, tagged, and sealed in a larger plastic bag by Cook and they remained in his 
possession for the trip back to Toronto.  The bag of samples was dispatched by 
courier to the SGS laboratory in Don Mills.  Analysis for tungsten by ICP and Au by 
fire assay/flame AA finish was requested and the results are listed in Table 14.1. 

SGS is accredited to the ISO 17025 Standard by Certificate Number 456.

Clearly there is a significant amount of tungsten in the material sampled.  The 
difference between the original assays and the SGS assay values could easily be 
explained by the very coarse nature of the mineralization.  The mineralization 
assayed should not be taken as representative of the grade of the mineralized zones.

Assay data provided to Scott Wilson RPA was in the form of Excel™ spreadsheets.  
Scott Wilson RPA independently verified a portion of the database by randomly 
selecting a hole on each drill section and comparing the WO3 values in the provided 
data with the assay certificates and/or assay sheets from the various labs.  Data from 
the 2005 drilling program was compared against Excel™ spreadsheets provided by 
the labs while data from earlier drilling programs was verified by using scanned 
handwritten or typed assay sheets.  Much of the scanned data did not identify the

lab.  In total, assay results for the mineralized portions of 31 holes drilled within the 
four interpreted zones were verified. 

Other than a small transcription error in one interval, no errors were found in the 
data; however, the data needs to be better organized and consolidated.  The 
database originally provided to Scott Wilson RPA did not contain the check assays 
and survey information was not well organized.  Collar locations and azimuths were 
reported on a number of different grids and a few discrepancies were present in the 
initial data provided.  The files containing the assay certificates were not labelled 
logically and Scott Wilson RPA did not receive some of the certificates until after the 
data verification exercise was complete.  Consequently, some sequences of data 
could not be verified from the original certificates.  While not material to the mineral 
resource estimates contained in this section, it is recommended that these 
deficiencies be addressed forthwith.  The use of database management software 
such as Access™ should be considered.

Wardrop designed the Mactung project process plant to treat scheelite ore that will 
be mined from underground at the rate of 730,000 t/a.  The design is primarily based 
on metallurgical testwork conducted by Lakefield Research Limited of Canada 
(Lakefield) in 1985, together with processing experience from the existing Cantung 
Mine, NWT, although various testwork results from as early as 1974 have been used 
to define the recovery process.  

The treatment processes as designed will involve comminution followed by the 
rejection of sulphide minerals and the concentration of scheelite.  As shown in the 
simplified flowsheet (Figure 16.1), sulphide minerals will be rejected via the wet and 
dry magnetic separation process and several sulphide flotation stages.  High grade 
tungsten concentrates will be produced through coarse and fine gravity separation 
methods, as well as a lower grade tungsten concentrate through the scheelite 
flotation process.

Various historical metallurgical testwork programs investigated crushing, grinding, 
sulphur rejection, scheelite gravity concentration, and flotation over the period from 
1974 to 1985.  

16.2.1 HEAD ANALYSIS 

Head analyses have been determined on all test programs carried out since 1974, 
and specific gravity determinations were obtained from selected samples.  The head 
assay and specific gravities test results considered to be the most representative 
were obtained from the Lakefield pilot plant testing program in 1985 and these results 
are listed in Table 16.1.  These values correspond closely with the anticipated grade 
of the plant feed ore for the first four years of production with an average grade of 
1.29% WO3 according the mine plan.

Sample WO3  (%) Cu (%) Fe (%) S (%) SG 

Pilot-Plant Feed (calc.) 1.50 0.23 18.2 8.05 3.32 
 

Although the ore feed grade of 1.30% WO3 has been used in the design of the 
process plant, it has been established that the recovery of scheelite is sensitive to 
ore grade variations.  In a scoping study report published in 1984 by Amax Extractive 
Metallurgy Laboratory (Amax), the effect of variations in ore grade on the recovery 
was characterised in Table 16.2 and is presented in Figure 16.2.   

Although the Amax study was conducted on the basis of a proposed treatment plant 
feed rate of 907 t/d and producing 4 scheelite products, the sensitivity of the grade 
and recovery is apparent.  The graph also shows the designed ore grade and 
scheelite recovery obtained from the Mactung deposit as used in the present report, 
namely 82% recovery based on a feed grade of 1.30% WO3.  It also shows the 
recovery variations resulting from changes in the scheelite grade of the ore to the 
Mactung plant, as based on the same relationship developed in the Amax study.

16.2.3 COMMINUTION TESTWORK 

The Colorado School of Mines Research Institute (CSMRI) determined the Bond and 
rod mill work indices during the 1974 pilot-plant test program requested by Amax.  
The maximum particle size of the rod and ball mill product was 1.7 mm and 0.3 mm.  
The weighted average ball and rod mill work indices of all the samples are 15.2 and 
15.0 kWh/t, respectively.  

In 1985 Lakefield conducted grinding tests on a pilot-plant scale.  The test results are 
shown in Table 16.4.  The rod mill work index for Tests PP-A4 to PP-A10 was 
16.0 kWh/t, which was close to the results from Tests PP-A11 to PP-A13 of 
16.7 kWh/t.  The average rod mill work index for the other two series of tests was 
higher, at 20.1 and 20.5 kWh/t.  The average ball mill work index was low at 
13.0 kWh/t.

Considering the Mactung design for the grinding circuit, the rod mill work index of 
16.0 kWh/t was selected, and the ball mill work index value of 13.0 kWh/t was used 
for the gravity regrind circuit. 

16.2.4 SULPHIDE MINERAL REMOVAL 

In the testwork reviewed, the removal of the sulphide minerals was investigated by 
using either sulphide flotation, or magnetic separation followed by sulphide flotation, 
or sulphide flotation followed by magnetic separation, or using both processes at 
various stages in the upgrading of the ore. 

SULPHIDE FLOTATION 

Using the sulphide flotation as the single treatment for sulphide minerals removal 
was first examined by Amax in 1973.  With a two-stage bulk sulphide flotation, the 
scheelite loss was still high about 3.3% at a grade of 0.62%WO3.  In 1974, Amax 
conducted further differential sulphide flotation tests on a pilot-plant scale which 
consisted of a copper mineral flotation step followed by an iron flotation step; each 
included multiple cleaner flotation stages.  The reported scheelite loss on average 
was 0.12% to the copper concentrate, and 0.41% to the iron concentrate.  The 
sulphur distribution in the final scheelite flotation concentrate was about 0.07 to 
0.51% grading at 0.23 to 3.56% S. 

MAGNETIC  SEPARATION FOLLOWED BY SULPHIDE FLOTATION 

In the Amax 1974 pilot-plant testwork, magnetic separation followed by the 
differential sulphide flotation, was examined.  The results indicated that the loss of 
scheelite in the iron sulphide flotation concentrate was reduced by 2% compared with 
the situation where no magnetic separation was employed.  The sulphur distribution 
in the final scheelite flotation concentrate was about 0.03 to 0.08% grading at 0.37 to 
1.40% S, which was an improvement on the flotation-only process. 

In 1985, Lakefield employed magnetic separation, primary sulphide mineral flotation, 
and secondary sulphide flotation in gravity circuit in order to reject sulphide minerals 
prior to the scheelite flotation.  The magnetic separation process consisted of a 
rougher with or without a cleaner stage.  The non-magnetic material produced was 
the feed material of the primary sulphide flotation, which was performed prior to the 
gravity concentration circuit.  The primary, or bulk, sulphide flotation included the 
following steps: rougher/scavenger sulphide flotation, a regrinding of the combined 
rougher and scavenger sulphide concentrate, followed by cleaner sulphide flotation 
stages.  The secondary sulphide flotation in the gravity circuit removed sulphide 
minerals from the fine gravity circuit tailings.  

The test results showed that magnetic separation treatment removed between 35 
and 53% of the sulphur content.  The scheelite loss to the magnetic concentrate was 
from 0.7 to 1.2% when a cleaner magnetic separation stage was included in the test.  



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-7 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The primary sulphide flotation stage removed about 59% sulphide minerals on 
average from selected tests at a grade of 36% S.  About 5% additional sulphide 
minerals were removed from the secondary sulphide flotation circuit having a grade 
of 19% S.  On average, the combined sulphur removal was 94% with the scheelite 
loss to the sulphide mineral concentrate being 2.3% with a tungsten grade of 
0.15% WO3.  

SULPHIDE FLOTATION FOLLOWED BY MAGNETIC SEPARATION 

The laboratory amenability tests of the1974 Amax pilot-plant testing used the 
process of the differential sulphide flotation followed by a magnetic separation of the 
gravity concentrate to remove sulphide minerals.  The test results showed that 
although the cleaned gravity concentrate had a 77% WO3 grade at a recovery of 
39% on average, the magnetic concentrate still contained relatively high scheelite 
content, about 3.5% of the total scheelite with a grade of 25% WO3.   

16.2.5 GRAVITY CONCENTRATION TESTWORK 

Gravity concentration, including the traditional spiral and tabling processes, were 
mainly examined in the 1974 Amax and 1985 Lakefield pilot-plant testwork programs.   

1974 – AMAX 

Laboratory scale tabling tests were carried out on sulphide flotation tailings in three 
particle size groups of 45 to 75 µm , 75 to 150 µm , and plus 150 µm.  The 
concentrate produced had an average grade of 77% WO3 at an average scheelite 
recovery of 39%, with a range from 33 to 54%.  The gravity concentrate obtained was 
further purified through a roasting stage on selected samples with a temperature 
above 650°C, followed by a magnetic separation.  However, the tungsten grade in 
the final concentrate was only increased marginally from 77% to 78.9% WO3.  Since 
no sulphur analyses were performed on the products, the sulphur removal efficiency 
cannot be calculated. 

The pilot-plant tabling tests used the modified flowsheet developed from the 
laboratory-scale test.  The sulphide flotation tailings were classified at 75 and 180 µm 
and each of the size group was subjected to a tabling test.  The scheelite 
concentrate product had a lower average grade of about 35% WO3 at a recovery of 
27%.  The highest grade of gravity concentrate obtained had a value of 56% WO3 at 
a recovery of 35%.   

1985 – LAKEFIELD 

The 1985 Lakefield test program included a primary and a secondary gravity 
concentration test stages.  The primary stage was performed on pilot-plant scale, 
and the secondary concentration test was conducted on a laboratory-scale.  The test 
results are discussed below.

Pr imary Grav i ty  Concent ra t ion Ci rcu i t  

The feed material for the primary gravity circuit test was obtained from the previous 
generated sulphide flotation tailings.  The basic gravity circuit included the coarse 
and fine spiral separation which was employed in Tests PP-A4 to PP-A7.  This 
produced a combined gravity concentrate with a tungsten grade of between 13.3 to 
28.3% WO3 and with the respective recoveries varying from 50.5 to 58.2%. 

Various flowsheet changes were tested to improve the performance of the primary 
gravity concentration circuit.  Table 16.5 summarizes the flowsheet modifications and 
the respective test results obtained.  From the table, it can be seen that the optimum 
metallurgical performance from the primary gravity concentration is obtained from 
Tests PP-A17 to A18.  These tests were based on the Flowsheet 7 as shown in 
Figure 16.3, which also includes sulphide mineral rejection and the scheelite flotation 
processes.  The combined primary gravity concentrates recovered for scheelite was 
between 68.9 to 75.9% at a tungsten grade of 15.5 to 19.8% WO3. 

Secondary Grav i ty  Concentrat ion Ci rcu i t  

The coarse and fine gravity concentrate obtained from the primary tabling 
concentration stage was used for the secondary gravity circuit using laboratory scale 
test equipment.  A two-stage and a single stage cleaner tabling circuits were 
employed to upgrade the coarse and fine concentrate, respectively.  The final 
concentrates obtained from this testwork was combined as the final gravity circuit 
concentrate.  The coarse and fine tailings were combined as well and reground 
before being processed in a regrind cleaner table.  The tailings and concentrate 
produced from the regrind cleaner table were discharged as the final products while 
the middlings were recycled.  The test results showed that the highest tungsten 
grade of 78% WO3 of the final gravity concentrate was obtained from Tests PP-A11 
and PP-A13 at a recovery of 85%.  The highest recovery of scheelite was obtained 
from Tests PP-A17 to A18 with a value of 88% at a grade of 71% WO3.

16.2.7 SCHEELITE FLOTATION 

The scheelite flotation process was extensively studied and reported in the various 
documents reviewed.   

Preliminary flotation tests were conducted by Lakefield in 1973 and 1974 with limited 
success.  Further flotation test work was carried in 1974 by Amax both on a 
laboratory and pilot-plant scale.  The laboratory scale tests were open-cycle tests 
that produced a tungsten concentrate with an average grade of 64% WO3 at a 
recovery of 27%.  In the pilot-plant testwork, the optimum results were from the 
locked-cycle test configuration grading at 65% WO3 at a recovery of 26%, and with 
the first cleaner tailings discarded as tailings.   

In 1978, Climax Molybdenum Division Mine Evaluation conducted a pilot-plant scale 
testwork program to evaluate scheelite flotation ahead of the gravity concentration 
circuit.  The scheelite flotation performance was poor with a concentrate grade of 
14.1% WO3 at a recovery of 38.5%.  It was reported that the presence of -38 µm 
material was the reason for the poor scheelite flotation response.   

In 1979, Amax evaluated the all-flotation scheelite circuit in comparison to the 
traditional flowsheet consisting of a gravity circuit followed by the scheelite flotation 
step.  The all-flotation circuit was an open-cycle test and included two rougher 
flotation stages, two cleaner flotation stages, and one scavenger flotation stage. 

A high grade scheelite concentrate and a low grade scheelite concentrate could be 
produced from the all-flotation circuit.  A typical high grade concentrate had a 
tungsten grade of 71% WO3 at a recovery of 80%.  However, a high concentration of 
impurities was reported typically with sulphur in the range of 1.05 to 1.34% S, and 
phosphorous between 0.136 and 0.321% P.  These values were significantly higher 
than the market product specifications of 0.3% S and 0.03% P, respectively.  A 
magnetic separation and a chemical leaching process were subsequently used to 
successfully lower impurity contents to below the product specification limits. 

The optimum reagent conditioning order was found to be very important with the 
sequential additions of first the soda ash, then sodium hydroxide/sodium cyanide, 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-12 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

and then followed by sodium silicate.  The degree of agitation during conditioning 
also positively affected the rougher and cleaner flotation concentrate grade in the 
range tested.  The optimum pulp temperature was found to be about 20°C in the 
temperature range studied which varied from 0 to 50°C.   

The conventional gravity-flotation flowsheet was tested as a comparison.  For a grind 
of about 12% plus 150 µm, the best results obtained had a gravity concentrate grade 
of 50% WO3 at a recovery of 82%, and a flotation concentrate grade of 74% WO3 at 
a recovery of 80%.   

A semi-continuous pilot-plant test was performed in 1979 by Amax to further evaluate 
the all-flotation circuit to recover scheelite concentrate based on the promising 
laboratory test results which had been obtained.  Two products were produced.  The 
best metallurgical results produced a high grade flotation concentrate of more than 
65% WO3 at a recovery of 70%, although the lowest grades obtained resulted in a 
flotation concentrate of 20% WO3 at a recovery of 10%.  However, high 
concentrations of impurity elements were found in the high grade scheelite 
concentrate and this would require further treatment for their removal.  

Lakefield evaluated the locked-cycle scheelite flotation circuit and tested different 
flowsheet options and configurations on a pilot-plant scale in the 1985 test program.  
Promising metallurgical performances were observed from the results of Tests 
PP-A14 to PP-A19 when using the flowsheet which consisted of four cleaner flotation 
stages with all the cleaner stage flotation tailings being recycled back to the first 
cleaner flotation stage, and with the first cleaner tailings and the scavenger 
concentrate combined and returned to the rougher flotation stage.  The results of the 
six tests conducted are presented in Table 16.7.  The best results were from Test 
PP-A15 which produced a flotation concentrate grade nearly at 75% WO3 with a 
recovery of 46%.  The lowest grade scheelite flotation concentrate was obtained in 
Test PP-A19 which gave a grade of 40% WO3 at a recovery of 11%.  Lakefield 
explained the reason for the reduced grades and recoveries as being the decrease of 
the tungsten grade in the feed material when the secondary tabling and regrind spiral 
products were added to the gravity circuit ahead of the flotation circuit.

16.2.8 CONCLUSIONS 

The following are the salient conclusions reached from the metallurgical testwork 
history. 

SULPHIDE MINERALS REJECTION 

The sulphide rejection process in the plant design will be performed via the 
combination of the magnetic separation, the bulk sulphide mineral flotation steps, as 
well as in process sulphide mineral flotation.  A similar flowsheet was tested in the 
1985 pilot-plant test program by Lakefield and the results were successful.   

SCHEELITE FLOTATION 

The scheelite flotation circuit should consist of a rougher, a scavenger, and multiple 
cleaner stages in order to produce a high grade tungsten concentrate.  The cleaner 
tailings from each stage should be returned as feed to the first cleaner stage and be 
combined with the rougher concentrate.  

The alternative process of using an all-flotation circuit produced very promising 
results which could be particularly suited to the treatment of oxidized feed material.  
However, some factors hindered its application, which mainly included the high cost 
to remove the impurities in the flotation concentrate, the application of depressant 
reagents in the scheelite flotation process such as sodium cyanide, and the potential 
loss of scheelite to the -10 μm fraction.  

The sequence of addition of reagents to the flotation process was also determined to 
be very important, as was the degree of agitation and the pulp temperature.

GRAVITY CIRCUIT  CONCENTRATE ROASTING 

The laboratory tests by Amax in 1974 indicated that the roasting of the gravity 
concentrate in order to remove sulphur can only marginally improve the concentrate 
grade, and that the sulphur gases produced will result in environmental problems 
requiring further treatment.  Therefore this operation should not be employed in the 
design of the Mactung process plant.  High intensity dry magnetic separation will be 
used instead to further upgrade the gravity concentrate.  

FLOWSHEET DEVELOPMENT 

The above testwork constitutes the basis of the design for the Mactung process 
plant, together with the operating plant experience obtained from the Cantung Mine.  
The design adopted for the Mactung process plant follows the generalized flowsheet 
from the 1985 Lakefield pilot-plant testwork program, which incorporated: 

• crushing and grinding 

• sulphide mineral removal using flotation and magnetic separation at various 
stages during the ore processing 

• using coarse and fine gravity concentration to produce a high grade 
tungsten concentrate 

• using scheelite flotation to produce a lower grade concentrate. 

16.2.9 RECOMMENDED TESTWORK 

Some additional metallurgical and environmental testwork will be required for the 
detailed engineering design stage.  This will include: 

• the determination of the crushing index 

• rod and ball mill work indices confirmation tests in relation to the feed and 
product particle size 

• characterization tests of the monoclinic and hexagonal forms of pyrrhotite 

• confirmation of the density of the magnetic separation feed pulp 

• settling tests of the various thickener feed streams, namely, the grinding 
thickener, the scheelite flotation thickener, the scheelite flotation concentrate 
thickener, and the final tailings thickener.   

In addition, the particle size distribution, specific gravity, and Uniaxial Compressive 
Strength tests of the final tailings, and the environmental tests will be recommended 
for the future testwork program.

The process plant will treat the ROM ore from underground at a nominal feed rate of 
2,000 t/d.  The ROM ore will be a skarn-type scheelite bearing ore with a nominal 
grade of 1.30% WO3 and 8.0% S. 

Two scheelite concentrate products will be obtained: one from the gravity 
concentration circuit grading at 67% WO3 at a recovery of 55%, and the other from 
the flotation circuit grading at 55% WO3 at a recovery of 27% for an overall scheelite 
recovery of 82%. 

The process plant will produce about 13,315 t/a scheelite concentrate on average, 
including the gravity circuit concentrate of 8,322 t/a and the flotation circuit 
concentrate of 4,993 t/a.  A simplified flowsheet is show in Figure 16.1. 

16.3.1 PRIMARY CRUSHING 

The ROM ore will be dumped into the ore pass through a static grizzly which will 
have square openings of 750 mm x 750 mm.  The ore pass will have a 400-t live 
capacity, allowing ROM ore to pass to the coarse ore vibrating grizzly feeder.  The 
vibrating grizzly feeder will classify the ROM ore at 125 mm and will feed the primary 
crusher with material larger than 125 mm.  The primary jaw crusher will have a feed 
opening of 1,044 mm x 838 mm and a closed side setting (CSS) of 100 mm.  
Together with the undersize product from the vibrating grizzly feeder, the primary 
crusher product will be conveyed from underground to the coarse ore bin on surface.  

The coarse ore bin will have a live capacity of 500 t and will be equipped with two 
vibrating pan feeders.  The conveyor belt will be equipped with a belt magnet, which 
will remove the tramp iron from the crushed ore and deposit this material into a tote 
bin for periodic removal and disposal. 

An air-operated diverter gate at the coarse ore bin will allow for the dumping of ore 
onto a temporary coarse ore stockpile.  Ore will be recovered from the stockpile by 
front-end loaders which will tip the ore into a feed chute and onto the coarse ore 
recovery conveyor.  

16.3.2 SECONDARY AND TERTIARY CRUSHING CIRCUIT 

The ore reclaimed from the coarse ore bin will report to the double-deck vibrating 
scalping screen.  The top deck of the scalping screen will have an aperture size of 
75 mm, and the bottom deck opening will be 50 mm.  The scalping screen undersize 
product will join the discharge from both crushers on a collection conveyor for 
transportation to the double deck vibrating sizing screen.  The oversize product from 
both decks will range from 50 mm to 125 mm and will be crushed to a particle size 
P80 of 38 mm by the secondary crusher.  The crushed ore from the secondary cone 
crusher and the scalping screen undersize will be conveyed to the sizing screen.   



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-16 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The sizing screen will classify the feed material at 20 mm.  The top deck aperture will 
be 50 mm and the bottom deck will have the slotted openings of 20 mm x 100 mm.  
The sizing screen undersize will be conveyed to the fine ore bin for further 
processing.  The screen oversize from the two decks will pass to the tertiary crushing 
feed hopper which will have a surge capacity of about 10 minutes and will then be 
fed to the tertiary cone crusher.  The tertiary cone crusher will have a CSS of 16 mm.  
The tertiary cone crusher product will also report to the sizing screen.  The 
secondary crusher circuit circulating load has been estimated to be 110%.  

An air-operated plow will divert the crushed ore to a fine ore stockpile should this be 
required operationally.  The material will be reclaimed using front-end loaders. 

The fine ore bin will have a live capacity of 2,000 t and will be equipped with two belt 
feeders.  A conventional baghouse will be used to collect and control the dust 
generated in the secondary and tertiary crushing circuits.  

16.3.3 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GRINDING CIRCUIT 

The crushed ore from the fine ore bin will be conveyed to the primary rod mill 
together with process water and the flotation reagent potassium amyl xanthate 
(KAX).  The diameter of the primary rod mill will be 3,400 mm and the length will be 
5,500 mm.  The milling density has been designed to be 80% solids.  Rotating at 
72% of the critical speed, the primary rod mill will grind the feed material from a 
particle size P80 of 16 mm to a P80 of 505 μm.  A motor of 745 kW will be installed for 
this operation.  The ground material will be diluted with process water to 45% solids 
for classification by the grinding screens. 

The grinding classification screens will be the 5-tray stack vibrating type with each 
deck having a slotted aperture of 230 μm x 3,000 μm.  There will be four sizing 
screens installed and three will be in operation at any time and one on standby.  The 
feed slurry to the screens will be classified at 230 μm.  The screen undersize will 
report to the grinding thickener for the next stage of processing.  The screen oversize 
obtained will feed the secondary grinding rod mill.  

The secondary rod mill will have the same dimensions, motor size, and rotation 
speed as the primary rod mill abut with a lower milling density of 75% solids.  The 
secondary rod mill discharge will join the primary rod mill discharge and feed the 
grinding classification screens.  The circulating load of 200% has been designed for 
secondary grinding.   

A sampler will be installed in the grinding screen undersize stream.  

16.3.4 SULPHIDE MAGNETIC SEPARATION STAGE 

The milled ore slurry with a P80 of 150 μm will report to a 2-tray/3-compartment 
stacked conventional thickener with a diameter of 18.3 m.  The thickener underflow 
will feed the three rougher sulphide magnetic separators at a density of 50% solids.  



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-17 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The thickener overflow solution will be returned to the process water tank for 
recycling.  No flocculant will be used in the thickening process in order to prevent any 
potential interference in the downstream gravity concentration circuits, and the 
subsequent sulphide and scheelite flotation unit processes. 

The rougher magnetic separators will process both the grinding thickener underflow 
and a small amount of magnetic concentrate collected from the magnetic separation 
stage used for the cleaning of the scheelite gravity concentrate.  The feed density to 
the rougher magnetic separators will be 50% solids.  About 75% by weight of the 
total feed in the slurry will be discharged as the non-magnetic material for further 
treatment.  The 25% by weight magnetic product collected will be diluted to 50% 
solids with process water and will be treated in the cleaner magnetic separation 
circuit. 

The cleaner magnetic separation will be performed using one magnetic separator at 
a feed density of about 50% solids.  The cleaner magnetic concentrate product will 
be diluted with process water to 30% solids and will then be discharged to the final 
tailings pumpbox.  About 8.4 t/h cleaner magnetic concentrate will be produced.  The 
non-magnetic material from the cleaner and rougher magnetic separators will be 
combined together and will be the feed to the bulk sulphide flotation circuit.   

The rougher and cleaner magnetic separators have been identically sized at 1.20 m 
diameter and 1.83 m long, and operating at a magnetic field strength of 850 gauss. 

A sampler will be installed in the bulk magnetic sulphide cleaner concentrate line. 

16.3.5 BULK SULPHIDE FLOTATION CIRCUIT 

The non-magnetic material from the sulphide magnetic separation circuit will feed the 
bulk sulphide flotation conditioning tank together with three other slurry streams.  
These slurry streams include the bulk sulphide cleaner flotation stage tailings, the 
regrind sulphide flotation concentrate from the gravity concentration circuit, and the 
sulphide flotation concentrate from the flotation stage of the table concentrate from 
the gravity concentration circuits.  The flotation reagents used will be the collector 
KAX, the frother DF250, and the activator copper sulphate that will be added to the 
conditioning tank and will be mixed with the feed slurries.  The design residence time 
for the conditioning of the feed slurry will be five minutes.   

The overflow from the conditioning tank will report to the bulk sulphide rougher 
flotation bank of cells at a density of 42% solids.  The bulk sulphide rougher flotation 
process will be conducted in 6 mechanical flotation tank cells each with a volume of 
20 m3.  The design assumes a 30-minute residence time and a slurry pH value of 7.0 
(neutral).  About 25% by weight of the flotation feed solids will report to the froth 
concentrate, which will mainly be composed of sulphide minerals.  This sulphide 
mineral concentrate, after being diluted with process water, will feed the sulphide 
regrind cyclone via the regrind cyclone feed pumpbox.  The sulphide rougher 
flotation stage tailings will be discharged to the gravity hydrosizer for further

treatment, together with the tailings from the regrind sulphide flotation circuit, the 
overflow from the gravity concentrate dewatering auger, and process water as 
required.  

Two cyclones with a diameter of 250 mm will be used as classifiers in the bulk 
sulphide regrind circuit.  One unit will be operational and the other will be acting as a 
spare.  The regrind cyclone will classify the reground sulphide rougher concentrate 
stream and will produce a cyclone overflow with a particle size P80 of 60 μm.  The 
cyclone overflow will be pumped to the sulphide cleaner flotation stage.  The regrind 
cyclone underflow at a density of 70% solids by weight will be discharged to the 
sulphide regrind ball mill and will be reground to liberate locked sulphide and 
associated scheelite minerals. 

The sulphide regrind ball mill will be 1,600 mm in diameter and 2,750 mm in length.  
The feed particle size F80 of the ball mill will be about 160 μm and the milling density 
has been designed to be 70% solids.  The sulphide regrind ball mill will operate in 
open circuit to minimize the over-grinding of the scheelite present in the feed 
material.  The regrind ball mill will be equipped with a 56 kW motor for this operation.  
The mill discharge will be combined with the regrind cyclone overflow to constitute 
the feed to the bulk sulphide cleaner flotation circuit.  

The bulk sulphide cleaner flotation will be carried out at neutral pH with no further 
flotation reagents added.  There will be five flotation cells each with a volume of 
10 m3.  This will give a residence time of 30 minutes.  The cleaner flotation process 
will produce 9.6 t/h of sulphide concentrate at a pulp density of 32% solids which will 
be diluted with process water and discharged as the final tailings.  The cleaner 
flotation tailings will be pumped back to the bulk sulphide flotation stage.  

Samplers will be installed to collect concentrate and tailings samples from the bulk 
sulphide rougher flotation circuit, and concentrate samples from the bulk sulphide 
cleaner flotation circuit, for process control and metallurgical accounting.  

16.3.6 GRAVITY CONCENTRATION CIRCUIT 

HYDROSIZER CLASSIF ICATION 

The bulk sulphide rougher flotation tailings, the gravity circuit regrind sulphide 
flotation tailings, and the gravity concentrate dewatering auger overflow will be 
combined and classified in a hydrosizer.  Process water will be added to dilute the 
feed slurry to 25% solids and to fluidize the feed material during the classification 
process.  The diameter of the hydrosizer will be 3,048 mm.  The hydrosizer overflow 
will have a particle size P80 of 110 μm and will be further processed in the fine gravity 
concentration circuit.  The hydrosizer underflow will be processed in the coarse 
gravity concentration circuit.

COARSE GRAVITY CONCENTRATION CIRCUIT 

Two-stage Spi ra l  Separat ion 

The hydrosizer underflow will be diluted with process water to 25% solids density in 
the spiral feed pumpbox and will then be pumped to the rougher spiral concentrator 
distributor.  The two-start type of spiral concentrators will be used for both the 
rougher and scavenger spiral concentration stages.  

The rougher spiral concentrate will be further purified in the tabling stage, together 
with the scavenger spiral concentrate.  The rougher middlings, after dilution with 
process water to a pulp density of 25% solids, will be the feed reporting to the 
scavenger spiral units.  The middlings and tailings produced will be combined with 
the rougher spiral tailings and will be reground in next stage.  

Two-stage Table Separa t ion 

The two-stage tabling process will include a cleaner tabling step followed by the one-
stage tabling of the middlings from the cleaner tables.  Two double-deck tables will 
be used in the cleaner tabling step and both tables will be in operation at any time.  
The feed to the coarse cleaner table will consist of the coarse spiral concentrates, 
and the returned coarse gravity middling cleaner table middlings, which will have a 
density of 25% solids after dilution with process water.  The coarse cleaner table 
concentrate will be diluted to about 17% solids and will be further upgraded in the 
tables concentrate sulphide flotation circuit.  The coarse cleaner table middlings will 
feed the coarse middlings cleaner table.  The coarse cleaner table tailings will be 
discharged for regrinding.  

The coarse middlings cleaner tabling stage will use one double-deck table.  The feed 
density will be adjusted to 20% solids with the addition of process water.  The 
concentrate will also be diluted and combined with the coarse cleaner table 
concentrate for further upgrading.  The middlings will be returned to feed the coarse 
cleaner table.  The tailings will also be discharged for regrinding. 

FINE GRAVITY CONCENTRATION CIRCUIT 

Fine Grav i ty  Desl ime Cyc lone Class i f icat ion 

There will be 6 deslime cyclones, each with a diameter of 250 mm, and 4 cyclones in 
operation at any time.  The feed material from the hydrosizer overflow will be sized at 
a D50 size of 30 μm.  The deslime cyclone overflow will consist of slime material with 
a particle size P80 of 40 μm, which will be further processed in the scheelite flotation 
circuit.  The deslime cyclone underflow at a density of 25% solids will be discharged 
to the fine gravity circuit.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Two-stage Spi ra l  Separat ion 

The deslime cyclone underflow will feed the fine rougher spirals at a rate of 49 t/h 
solids via a distributor.  The two-start type of spirals will be used and this will produce 
three products.  The fine rougher spiral concentrate will be upgraded in the 
subsequent fine tabling stage.  The diluted fine rougher spiral middlings will feed the 
fine scavenger spiral.  The rougher fine spiral tailings will be discharged to the 
scheelite flotation circuit.  

In the fine scavenger spiral concentration stage, the fine rougher middlings will be 
concentrated in the two-start spiral concentrators.  The fine scavenger concentrate 
will be combined with the rougher spiral concentrate for further tabling.  The fine 
scavenger spiral middlings and tailings will be combined with the fine rougher spiral 
tailings and report to the scheelite flotation circuit.   

Two-stage Table Separa t ion 

The combined concentrates from the fine rougher and scavenger spirals will feed the 
fine cleaner tables at a rate of 4.7 t/h solids.  With the addition of process water, the 
feed pulp density will be reduced to 25% solids.  Two triple-deck tables will be used 
in the first fine cleaner tabling stage and both tables will be operational.  The fine 
cleaner table concentrate will be diluted to about 17% solids and will be further 
upgraded in the table concentrate sulphide flotation circuit.  The fine cleaner table 
middlings will feed the fine middlings cleaner table.  The fine cleaner table tailings will 
be discharged to the scheelite flotation circuit.  

In the second fine middlings cleaner tabling stage, one triple-deck table will be used.  
The fine middlings cleaner table concentrate will be diluted to about 17% and will be 
further processed in the tables concentrate sulphide flotation circuit.  The fine 
middlings cleaner table middlings will be discharged to the gravity regrind circuit.  
The fine middlings cleaner table tailings will report to the scheelite flotation circuit.  

16.3.7 GRAVITY REGRIND CIRCUIT 

The gravity regrind circuit will facilitate the recovery of scheelite by liberating 
interlocked scheelite from gangue minerals.  The feed material for the regrinding 
circuit will include the coarse rougher spiral tailings, the coarse scavenger spiral 
middlings, and tailings, the coarse cleaner table tailings, the coarse middlings 
cleaner table tailings, and the fine gravity middlings cleaner table middlings. 

The 6 slurry streams will be diluted to 20% solids and feed the gravity regrind 
cyclone cluster.  There will be 6 regrind cyclones, each with a diameter of 150 mm 
with 4 operational at any time and 2 on standby.  The cyclone overflow will have a 
particle size P80 of 30 μm that will be discharged to the scheelite flotation circuit.  The 
cyclone underflow will have a particle size P80 of 180 μm and will be reground in the 
gravity regrind ball mill.  The flotation collector KAX and frother DF250 reagents will 
also be fed to the regrind mill.  The gravity regrind ball mill will be 1,900 mm in

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

diameter and 4,000 mm in length powered with a 130 kW motor.  Rotating at 76% of 
the critical speed, the ball mill will grind the feed material to a particle size P80 of 
100 μm.  The mill discharge, at 60% solids, will be report to the gravity regrind 
sulphide flotation circuit at a diluted density of 35% solids. 

16.3.8 GRAVITY REGRIND SULPHIDE FLOTATION CIRCUIT 

There will be 5 conventional mechanical flotation cells in the gravity regrind sulphide 
flotation circuit, each with a volume of 10 m3.  The sulphide flotation will proceed at 
pH 7.0.  The concentrate obtained will be diluted to 20% solids by adding process 
water, and will be returned to the bulk sulphide flotation circuit.  The gravity regrind 
sulphide flotation tailings will report to the bulk rougher flotation tailings pumpbox for 
further processing. 

Samplers will be installed in the gravity regrind sulphide flotation tailings and 
concentrate lines.   

16.3.9 TABLE CONCENTRATE SULPHIDE FLOTATION CIRCUIT 

The combined coarse and fine gravity concentrate will be diluted to 16% solids and 
will then feed the dewatering cyclone cluster.  There will be 4 dewatering cyclones 
each with a diameter of 40 mm.  Two of the four dewatering cyclones will be 
operational at any time with two spare units.  The dewatering cyclone overflow at a 
particle size P80 of 10 μm will report to the gravity concentrate dewatering circuit.  
The dewatering cyclone underflow at a density of 35% solids will feed the table 
concentrate sulphide flotation circuit. 

The dewatering cyclone underflow and the flotation reagents (KAX and DF250) will 
be mixed at a slurry pH 7.0 for approximately 5 minutes in the conditioning tank.  The 
conditioned feed slurry will feed the table concentrate sulphide flotation circuit.  

The table concentrate sulphide flotation can be performed either in the flash flotation 
type cells or in conventional mechanical cells.  The designed flotation cell volume will 
be 8 m3 to allow 30 minutes residence time.  Sulphide minerals will be concentrated 
in the froth product which will be diluted with process water and will be returned to 
the bulk sulphide flotation circuit.  The table concentrate flotation tailings containing 
the high tungsten grades will report to the gravity concentrate dewatering circuit.  

A sampler will be installed in the feed line of the tables concentrate dewatering 
circuit. 

16.3.10 GRAVITY CONCENTRATE DEWATERING AND MAGNETIC  SEPARATION CIRCUIT 

The combined dewatering cyclone overflow and tailings from the table concentrate 
sulphide flotation stage will first be processed in a wet, low-intensity magnetic 
separator to remove the remaining magnetic sulphide minerals.  The dimensions of

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

the magnetic separator will be the same as the magnetic separators in the sulphide 
removal circuit.  The magnetic material will be discharged to the magnetic separation 
rejects pumpbox.  The non-magnetic material will feed the dewatering auger.   

The dewatering auger used will be a spiral classifier which will reduce the feed 
moisture content from 87% to 20%.  The auger overflow will be returned to the bulk 
sulphide rougher tailings pumpbox.  The dewatered concentrate will be further dried 
in a holoflite screw dryer. 

The screw dryer will dry the feed material to a moisture content that will be less than 
0.5%.  The drying temperature, lower than 120°C, will be low enough to avoid any 
sulphur dioxide formation.  The off-gases from the dryer will be discharged to the 
atmosphere via the dryer exhaust fan.  The dried gravity concentrate will be 
discharged to the water-jacketed dryer discharge screw conveyor for cooling and 
transportation to feed the high intensity magnetic separation circuit.  The water-
jacketed screw conveyer cooling water will be returned to the warm process water 
tank for re-use in the scheelite flotation circuit.   

The cooled gravity concentrate will first report to the dry gravity concentrate oversize 
screen to remove any tramp material bigger than 2 mm.  The oversize material will 
be intermittently discharged to a tote bin, which will be periodically transported to the 
primary rod mill for recycling.  The screen undersize will feed to the dry high-intensity 
magnetic separation stage via a feed hopper, which will act as a surge bin.  

The dry high-intensity magnetic separation circuit will consist of a rougher magnetic 
separation step and a two-stage cleaner magnetic separation step.  The magnetic 
separators will be rare-earth permanent high-intensity magnetic separators.  About 
6% by weight of the feed to the rougher magnetic separator will be separated into the 
magnetic concentrate.  This material will report to the magnetic separation rejects 
pumpbox and will be combined with the wet auger feed magnetic separator magnetic 
product.  With the addition of process water, the combined rejects will be pumped 
back to the wet magnetic separation circuit for recycling. 

The non-magnetic product from the rougher dry high-intensity magnetic separation 
will subsequently be treated in the two-stage cleaner high-intensity magnetic 
separation circuit.  The resulting magnetic concentrate will be classified at 74 μm via 
a vibrating screen.  The screen oversize will be collected in a tote bin and will be 
returned to the primary rod mill for recycling.  The screen undersize will be combined 
with the non-magnetic product from the cleaner magnetic separation step.  The 
combined material will be the final gravity circuit concentrate that will be discharged 
to a hopper and then be packaged.  

A dust collector baghouse will be installed to collect dust generated in the areas of 
the dryer discharge point, the dry gravity concentrate bucket elevator transfer points, 
the dry high-intensity magnetic concentration oversize screen, the dry high-intensity 
magnetic separation cleaner magnetic undersize screen, the gravity concentrate 
hopper, and the gravity concentrate packaging area.

16.3.11 SCHEELITE FLOTATION CIRCUIT 

FLOTATION FEED THICKENING 

The feed to the scheelite flotation circuit will be a combination of the following 
products: 

• overflow from the fine gravity concentration deslime cyclone 

• tailings from the fine gravity circuit rougher spirals 

• middlings and tailings from the fine gravity concentration scavenger spirals 

• tailings from the fine gravity concentrate tables 

• tailings from the fine gravity middlings table 

• overflow from the gravity regrind cyclone.   

The combined streams will be equally distributed to two scheelite flotation feed 
thickeners at a pulp density of about 15% solids.  

Each scheelite flotation feed thickener will be a 3-tray/4-compartment unit with a 
diameter of 18.3 m.  No flocculant will be added to the feed in order to prevent the 
potential interference with the scheelite flotation process.  The overflow from the two 
thickeners will be discharged to the process water tank for recycling.  The thickener 
underflows, at a density of 60% solids, will be combined to feed the scheelite flotation 
conditioning tanks.   

FLOTATION FEED CONDIT IONING 

A series of four conditioning tanks will be used.  In the first conditioning tank, the 
designed pH value will be adjusted to 10.5 by adding a mixture of caustic soda and 
soda ash solution.  Warm process water will also be introduced to increase the slurry 
temperature to the required 22°C and thereby also diluting the flotation feed slurry.  
The slurry pH value will be about 10.4 in the second conditioning tank and the 
reagents Quebracho and Sodium Silicate will be added to depress silicate minerals 
as well as any remaining sulphide minerals.   

In the third conditioning tank, the reagent Pamak, which is the trade name for a fatty 
acid, will be added as a scheelite flotation collector.  Two more feed slurry streams, 
including the scheelite flotation first cleaner tailings and the scheelite flotation 
scavenger concentrate, will also join this conditioning tank.  The combined slurry with 
a pH value of 10.3 will overflow to the last conditioning tank. 

The reagent Emcol, the trade name for another type of fatty acid that also acts as a 
scheelite collector, will be added to the fourth conditioning tank.  The slurry pH value 
will be about 10.2.  The conditioned flotation feed slurry will have a density of 40% 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-24 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

solids and will overflow the final conditioning tank to enter the scheelite rougher 
flotation cells at a feed rate of 76 t/h solids. 

SCHEELITE ROUGHER FLOTATION 

The rougher scheelite flotation will be performed in the first four cells of a bank of 
eight mechanical flotation cells.  The volume of the rougher flotation cells will be 
10 m3 and this set of cells will be equipped with double launders.  When the rougher 
concentrate grade is high, the high grade concentrate will be directed to the outer 
launder and will then be treated in the first cleaner scheelite flotation circuit.  During 
the period when the rougher concentrate tungsten grade is very low, the concentrate 
will be collected in the inner launder and will be combined with the scheelite 
scavenger concentrate.  The combined concentrate will then be returned to the third 
scheelite flotation conditioning tank as long as required in order to build up the feed 
grade.  In this process description, it will be assumed that the rougher concentrate 
will report to the outer launder for upgrading in the cleaner circuit.  

The designed rougher flotation stage residence time will be 15 minutes.  The rougher 
concentrate, with a lip density of 25% solids, will be joined with warm process water 
will be pumped to the cleaner scheelite flotation circuit.  The rougher tailings will feed 
the scheelite scavenger flotation circuit. 

SCHEELITE SCAVENGER FLOTATION 

The scavenger flotation will be conducted in the last four cells of the bank of eight 
mechanical flotation cells.  Each cell will have a unit volume of 10 m3 but will be 
equipped with single launders.  The flotation retention time will be about 15 minutes.  

Warm process water will be introduced to the scavenger concentrate launder to 
maintain the flotation temperature and for dilution of the concentrate.  The scavenger 
concentrate will report to the third conditioning tank.  The scavenger flotation tailings 
will be discharged as the final tailings.   

SCHEELITE CLEANER FLOTATION 

The scheelite cleaner flotation circuit will consist of three cleaner flotation stages.  
The feed material will be a combination of the scheelite rougher concentrate, the 
second cleaner stage tailings, and the third cleaner stage tailings streams.  The 
combined streams will be pumped together with Sodium Silicate and Quebracho to 
the first cleaner flotation circuit at a rate of 3.4 t/h solids. 

The scheelite first cleaner flotation stage will be performed in a bank of 4 
conventional mechanical cells each with a volume of 3 m3.  The feed slurry will have 
a pulp density of 11% solids.  After a 10-minute residence time, the first cleaner 
tailings will be discharged to the third scheelite flotation conditioning tank.  The first 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-25 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

cleaner concentrate with a lip density of 25% solids, will be diluted with warm 
process water and will be pumped to the scheelite second cleaner flotation stage.  

The scheelite second cleaner flotation stage will be conducted in a column flotation 
type cell at a feed slurry density of 15% solids.  The second cleaner flotation column 
will be 4 m3, with dimensions of 0.91 m in diameter and 6.0 m in height.  The second 
cleaner concentrate will constitute about 85% by weight of the feed material.  Warm 
process water will be sprayed onto the froth bed to assist in draining the impurities 
off, and to maintain the scheelite flotation temperature.  The diluted second cleaner 
concentrate will report to the third cleaner stage.  The second cleaner flotation 
tailings will be recycled to the first cleaner flotation circuit. 

The third scheelite cleaner flotation stage will also be performed in a column cell with 
a feed slurry density of 15% solids.  The volume and dimension of the third cleaner 
stage column cell will be the same as the second cleaner flotation column.  The third 
cleaner tailings will be re-processed in the first cleaner flotation circuit.  Again, warm 
process water will be used to spray the froth bed.  The third cleaner flotation 
concentrate will be the final flotation scheelite concentrate produced at a solid rate of 
0.6 t/h.   

Samplers will be installed in the lines of the scheelite feed thickener underflow, the 
conditioned scheelite flotation feed slurry, the scheelite scavenger flotation tailings, 
the final tailings pumpbox discharge, the first scheelite cleaner flotation concentrate, 
the second scheelite cleaner flotation concentrate pumpbox discharge, and the final 
scheelite flotation concentrate.  

16.3.12 SCHEELITE FLOTATION CONCENTRATE DEWATERING STAGE 

A high capacity thickener with a diameter of 8 m will be employed to initially process 
the concentrate feed slurry.  Flocculant will be added to assist with the settling of the 
concentrate.  The thickener underflow will have a density of 60% solids and will be 
filtered with a vacuum belt filter.  The thickener overflow will be returned to the 
process water tank for recycling.  

The thickened scheelite flotation concentrate will be pumped to the concentrate filter 
feed tank.  The retention time of the feed material in the filter tank has been designed 
to be 8 hours to allow sufficient surge capacity for possible operational interruptions.  
A filter aid will be employed to facilitate the filtration process by adding this to the 
filter feed tank and mixing with the flotation concentrate.  The slurry will then be 
pumped to the scheelite flotation concentrate filter. 

The vacuum belt filter will reduce the flotation concentrate moisture content from 
40% to 10%.  The filter cake will be discharged into the scheelite flotation 
concentrate dryer.  The filtrate will be pumped back to the scheelite flotation 
concentrate thickener.  The flotation concentrate dryer will dry the flotation 
concentrate to the designed moisture content of less than 0.5%.  The dryer used will 
be a holoflite screw type.  The dryer will have a diameter of 914 mm, a length of 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-26 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

6,400 mm, and will be powered by a motor of 7.5 kW.  The dried flotation concentrate 
will be sampled and packaged.  

Off-gases generated from the dryer will be released to atmosphere through the 
exhaust fan.  The off-gases and dusts generated from the dryer discharge end will be 
collected in a dust collection system.  The solids will be returned to the dried flotation 
concentrate.  The gases from the cyclone will be released to the atmosphere.  

16.3.13 TAIL INGS TREATMENT 

The final tailings will consist of the wet cleaner magnetic concentrate, the sulphide 
cleaner flotation concentrate, and the scheelite scavenger flotation tailings.  The final 
tailings will have a density of 35% solids and will first be pumped to the tailings 
thickener.   

The tailings thickener will be the high capacity type with a diameter of 22 m; 
flocculant will be added.  The clear thickener overflow will be discharged to the 
ageing pond before recycling to the process water tank.  The ageing pond has been 
designed to provide 30 days of retention time which will allow the flotation reagents, 
especially the fatty acids including Pamak and Emcol, to decompose so that there 
will be no interference in the sulphide and scheelite flotation processes.   

The reclaimed water will be returned to the process water tank via two stages of 
pumping, which will consist of vertical turbine pumps mounted on a floating barge, 
and the land-based horizontal solution/water pumps.  All the pumps will be inside an 
insulated, lighted, and heated enclosure. 

The tailings thickener underflow, with a density of 60% solids, will be pumped to the 
agitated tailings filter feed tank and will then be filtered in the automatic plate and 
frame pressure filters.  The tailings filter feed tank has a nominal retention time of 
four hours.  The moisture content of the filter cake will be an estimated 12 to 15%.  
The filter cake will be discharged by the variable speed belt feeders and transported 
to the belt conveyor.  A flop gate plough will either direct the filtered tailings to the 
underground workings conveying system as backfill or to the conveying system for 
the surface tailings disposal location. 

The filtrate from the pressure filters and the filter cloth wash water will report to the 
air and water separator.  The water will be returned to the tailings thickener, while the 
air portion will be released to atmosphere. 

16.3.14 REAGENTS 

Various reagents will be used in the metallurgical processes.  The flotation collector 
reagent KAX will be added in the primary rod mill feed and in the bulk rougher 
sulphide flotation conditioning tank as the sulphide mineral collector.  Copper 
Sulphate will also be used in the bulk rougher sulphide flotation stage as the sulphide 
mineral activator.   



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 16-27 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

DF250 will be added as the frother in all the flotation circuits.   

A combination of reagents will be employed for the scheelite flotation circuit.  In the 
first scheelite conditioning tank, a mixture of the reagents Caustic Soda and Soda 
Ash will be used to adjust the slurry pH value and to act as a dispersant.  Quebracho, 
the depressant for calcite, apatite, any remaining sulphide minerals, and silicate 
minerals, will be added into the second conditioning tank.  Sodium Silicate, a 
dispersant, will also be introduced into the same tank.  Pamak and Emcol, which are 
the scheelite mineral fatty acid collectors, will be added in the third and fourth 
conditioning tanks, respectively.   

Flocculant will be used to facilitate the settling of scheelite flotation concentrate and 
the final tailings in their respective thickeners.   

Filter aid will be added to assist in the filtration of the scheelite flotation concentrate. 

The reagents Quebracho, Copper Sulphate, Caustic Soda, Soda Ash, and flocculant 
will be processed in bulk bags as solids, and will initially be mixed with fresh water to 
reach the designed solution strength, and will then be stored in the respective 
holding tanks.  Magnetically coupled pumps will be used to transport the prepared 
reagent solutions to the various addition points.  Liquid reagents will consist of 
Emcol, Pamak, DF250, KAX, Sodium Silicate, and filter aid.  Of these, Emcol, 
Pamak, DF250, and filter aid will be pumped in the as-received concentration to the 
addition points by metering pumps.  KAX and Sodium Silicate will be diluted with 
fresh water in the mixing tanks and then will be stored in holding tanks.  The diluted 
reagent solutions will be delivered to the respective addition points by magnetically 
coupled pumps. 

16.3.15 WATER SYSTEM 

Fresh water usage will be required for reagent preparation, slurry pump gland seals, 
the mill lube cooling system, and potable water consumption.  Fresh water will be 
supplied from the South Tributary of the Hess River by staged pumping.  The fresh 
and fire water tank will have the top section limited by an internal standpipe.  The 
bottom of the tank will be reserved for fire protection water.  The fresh water tank will 
have a diameter of 12.0 m and will be 11.5 m high.  The tank will be located above 
the residential camp to provide fresh water service by gravity.  The potable water 
treatment system will be located at the camp, with the mill and other buildings at the 
mill site being supplied by a gravity line from the camp.   

Process water will consist of overflows from the grinding thickener, the scheelite 
flotation feed thickeners, the scheelite flotation concentrate thickener, and the tailings 
thickener plus reclaim water from the ageing pond with provision for fresh water 
make-up to the process water tank, if required.  The process water will be added to 
the points of application throughout the plant as required.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Excess water from the ageing pond will be discharged by pumping to the river after 
testing and ensuring that this water complies with the environmental discharge 
specifications.  It is recommended that ageing tests be conducted at the same time 
that the supernatant toxicity testwork is undertaken for environmental purposes.  A 
warm process water tank will be installed to provide warm process water to the 
scheelite flotation circuit.  The input streams of the warm process water tank will be 
composed of the cooling water return from the gravity concentrate dryer discharge 
screw conveyor, and process water heated in the powerhouse with waste heat from 
the generators and transferred via plate and frame heat exchangers.  There will be 
two heat exchangers; one will be in service while the second exchanger will be off-
line for cleaning.  

16.3.16 AIR SERVICES 

The primary crushing area air will be supplied by an underground compressor with 
no standby unit.  An air receiver will be equipped for the compressor.  

The plant air will be produced by one operating compressor with one standby unit.  It 
will be used in the secondary and tertiary crushing area, process and power plant, 
rod and regrind mill clutches, and in preparation of the instrument air via filtration and 
drying stages.  

High-pressure flotation air will be supplied by a single compressor with no stand-by 
unit.  Plant air can be used to provide the high pressure air in the event the high-
pressure flotation compressor is off-line.  This unit will be equipped with an air 
receiver with a volume of 2 m3.   

Low-pressure flotation air will be supplied by low-pressure centrifugal blowers without 
air receivers.  Two blowers will be installed with one operating and one unit on 
standby.

17.1.1 SUMMARY 

Scott Wilson RPA has completed a 3D solid model, or wireframe, and 2D block 
model for the Mactung property.  The 2D model is a gridded seam model (GSM) and 
contains two separate estimates of grade (kriged and polygonal) and a single 
estimate of thickness for each block.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the kriged 
estimate more appropriate for this deposit.  Table 17.1 summarizes the Kriged 
estimates.

mtu's 

(millions) 

Indicated 33,029 0.88 290 29.0 
Inferred 11.857 0.78 92 9.2 

 

The kriged estimates, which are based on assays capped at unique levels for each 
zone, are reported at a block cut-off of 0.5% WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers 
appropriate for the location and cost profile that can be expected for Mactung.  CIM 
definitions (December 2005) were followed for the classification of the mineral 
resources.  Scott Wilson RPA estimates an average drill spacing of 50 m based on 
the average distance between each composite and its four nearest neighbours.  
Scott Wilson RPA considers the spacing close enough to classify approximately 76% 
of the resources as indicated. 

Further drilling is required to improve the reliability of the mineral resource estimates 
for the upper 3 zones (3D, 3E, and 3F) as well as on the periphery and northern 
portions of all four zones.  Initial efforts should focus on the areas of the deposit 
where higher grade intercepts have not been entirely closed off by peripheral drilling.  
Assessments of grade variability indicate a maximum drill spacing in the range of 
120 m to classify any portion of the resource as indicated category, although this 
must be confirmed by further drilling in the upper 3 zones.

17.1.2 DATABASE – GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

The mineral resource estimates for the Mactung project are based on information 
from surface and underground drilling supplemented in part by surface and 
underground mapping.  The collar database provided to Scott Wilson RPA contains 
168 drill holes, of which 161 were used for grade interpolation.  Those drill holes 
within the modeled area cover a 1,000 m (E-W) by 700 m (N-S) area.  Holes vary in 
length from 5 m to 450 m and the average spacing in plan is estimated at 50 m 
based on the average distance between each composite and its four nearest 
neighbours.  Most surface holes are drilled toward the north at -50° to -90° (vertical), 
with the majority drilled at -70°.  Underground holes are drilled at various horizontal 
and vertical angles (up and down) from the underground drifting in the upper 2B 
horizon. 

17.1.3 ASSAYS 

The assay database provided to Scott Wilson RPA for the Mactung Project contains 
6,311 assay intervals, of which all but 414 contain assay values of 0.01% WO3 or 
greater.  A total of 3,738 intervals are located within the interpreted mineralized 
zones.  Assay intervals vary from 0.3 m to over 8 m in length, although most are 
1.5 m.  The data approximate a normal distribution when transformed to natural log 
values (lognormal).  A brief statistical summary of WO3 assays within the interpreted 
mineralized zones is provided in Table 17.2.

Total 3,738 0.980 0.958 

Note: Only those assays within the interpreted mineralized zones are reported. 

17.1.4 GEOLOGICAL MODEL 

For the purpose of resource estimates, the Mactung deposit has been modeled as 
four sheet-like mineralized envelopes dipping roughly S30°W at -20°.  Thickness 
averages 18 m and varies from less than 1 m to over 50 m.  The four main zones 
have been further subdivided by three main faults and a fold structure to produce 12 
individual lenses.  Scott Wilson RPA based its interpretation primarily on the previous 
historic estimate (Strathcona, 1982), although subsequent drilling has led to some 
changes, particularly around the fault structures.  Scott Wilson RPA modeled the 
hanging wall and footwall surfaces for each lens using an external cut-off of 0.4% 
WO3, creating 3D solids, or wireframes, representing the 12 mineralized envelopes.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 17-3 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

These envelopes were used to control compositing and block selection in 
subsequent interpolation runs. 

17.1.5 ASSAY CAPPING (CUTTING) 

In order to reduce the influence of statistically anomalous sample data on resource 
estimations, a number of higher-grade assay values are often capped prior to 
compositing at levels determined by various means, including examination of 
probability distribution data.  Scott Wilson RPA produced plots of the WO3 
distribution for each of the four zones using the assay data provided.  The distribution 
curves exhibit obvious breaks or inflection points in the upper parts of the curves and 
a general tailing off beyond these points.  These breaks often indicate the existence 
of several distinct populations within the grouped data, with upper values 
representing a very small fraction of the total population. 

Scott Wilson RPA selected the upper break in the distribution curve as caps for 
assay data.  In total, 37 assay intervals were capped.  These intervals represent less 
than 1% of the total number of assays greater than or equal to 0.01.  The net impact 
of the capping was to reduce the average assay grade within the interpreted zones 
by 0.7% of the uncapped mean grade.  Table 17.3 provides a summary of capping 
statistics for the Mactung data.  All data above the stated capping levels were set 
back to these levels prior to compositing.

17.1.6 COMPOSITES 

Composites, which were produced by Scott Wilson RPA for a "gridded seam" or 2D 
model, are based on single intercepts for each drill hole that pierces a lens.  Assay 
intervals for each drill hole were composited down the hole from the top of the 
interpreted mineralized envelope to the point of exit, producing a single length-
weighted average grade for each intercept.  The composites were tagged with a 
unique code for each lens to control composite selection in subsequent grade 
interpolation runs.  In Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, the 2D method is ideally suited to

17.1.7 BLOCK MODEL AND GRADE ESTIMATION PROCEDURES 

Scott Wilson RPA built a GSM based on blocks with fixed EW and NS dimensions 
and variable vertical thickness.  Individual block dimensions are 10 m EW by 10 m 
NS in plan.  In the Mactung GSM model, each block carries an interpolated "vertical 
thickness" value based on the difference between the elevations of the modeled 
hanging wall and footwall surfaces at block centre.  Often, the thickness is 
interpolated along with grade, using the composite thicknesses.  In the case of 
Mactung, some of the holes were drilled from development within the upper 2B 
horizon, resulting in a number of composites which are shorter than the actual 
thickness of the lens.  As well, some surface holes did not exit the mineralized 
horizons.  Use of these composites to interpolate thickness would have inevitably 
resulted in an underestimate of block thickness.  As an alternative, the 3D location of 
the hanging wall and footwall pierce points were used to model the two surfaces.  For 
drilling that did not completely pierce a particular lens (both underground and surface 
holes), only the point of contact with the hanging wall or footwall was used. 

Each block with its centre located within the interpreted zone was assigned a zone 
code that matched the composites.  A separate "seam" is reserved for each lens, 
resulting in a total of 12 seams, or 2D matrices, representing the various components 
or fault/fold blocks of the four mineralized horizons (2B, 3D, 3E, 3F).  Each seam is 
assigned a unique code and grades estimated using only those composites with 
matching codes.  For reporting purposes, the estimated grades for each block are 
weighted by their corresponding thickness values and assigned densities. 

Ordinary kriging and polygonal methods were utilized to estimate grades for each 
block.  The polygonal method assigns each block within a particular seam the grade 
of the closest matching composite while the kriged grade is based on a weighted 
average of the surrounding matching composites.  Grade estimates were based on 
2D searches with the distance in the XY plane only considered.  Scott Wilson RPA

reviewed the variography for the deposit and a reasonable model was developed, 
however, the nugget value is relatively high, indicating high grade variability between 
closely spaced holes.  Small-scale faulting may be, in part, responsible for the 
variability.  More close-spaced drilling, particularly in the three upper horizons, would 
help in providing a more definitive assessment of the spatial continuity for the grades 
and structures within this deposit.  Table 17.5 summarizes the parameters for the 
variogram model used for Mactung.  Models for 3D and 2B are depicted graphically 
in Figure 17.1 and Figure 17.2.

The minimum and maximum numbers of composites used in kriging interpolations 
were set at 2 and 4, respectively.  This allows a grade to be estimated for any block 
with two or more holes within the search area but prevents over-smoothing the 
estimate by using too many composites.  The search strategy employed by Scott 
Wilson RPA was based on two passes with a maximum search distance of 120 m 
(major) x 120 m (minor) on the first pass and 80 m (major) x 80 m (minor) on the 
second pass.  The second pass also required that the closest composite be no more 
than 60 m from the block centre.  Those blocks that meet the search criteria in the 
second pass are overwritten while leaving other blocks unchanged from the first 
pass.  The two-pass strategy allows most blocks within the interpreted envelopes to 
receive grade estimates on the first pass, while using a tighter search on the second 
pass to reduce the influence of distant composites on grade estimates close to the 
drill holes.  Grade estimates were made using only the composite values derived 
from the capped assays. 

Finally, after completing the grade interpolations, overall grades were calculated by 
weighting the block grades by the thickness of each block within the interpreted 
mineralized envelopes.  A minimum vertical thickness of 4.5 m was applied to each 
block, diluting the grade accordingly, if required.  The tonnage is estimated by 
multiplying their respective volumes by the SG.  For the purposes of the estimates, 
an SG of 2.99 was used for 3D, 3E, and 3F, while a value of 3.14 was used for 2B.  
The latter is based on densities established by the underground bulk sample taken 
from 2B.  Scott Wilson RPA has not reviewed any data or calculations related to the 
SG determination.  Strathcona used identical values in their estimates while the 
preceding study (Steininger, 1980) used an SG of 3.08 for the upper horizons.  
Application of the methodology described above resulted in the estimates of mineral 
resources summarized in Table 17.6 and Table 17.7.

In Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, a cut-off of 0.5% WO3 would be appropriate for 
reporting purposes.  The current cut-off for NATC's operating mine is 0.75% WO3; 
however, should the Mactung property be put into production, it is likely that its larger 
resource would allow significant gains in economy of scale.  Based on current prices, 
a case could certainly be made for a lower cut-off, however, from a long-term price 
and cost perspective, 0.5% WO3 is reasonable.  Table 17.8 and Table 17.9 provide 
estimates at increasing block cut-off grades; however, caution is advised in the use 
of higher cut-offs because the resource breaks up into smaller clusters of blocks as 
the cut-off increases and may be difficult to mine without encompassing some of the 
surrounding lower grade material reported at lower cut-off grades.

17.1.8 MODEL VALIDATION 

As part of the block model validation process, polygonal grade estimates were also 
produced and are provided in Table 17.6 through Table 17.9 for comparison 
purposes.  The polygonal estimates are generally lower in tonnage and higher in 
grade at lower cut-offs; however, metal content is virtually identical at the selected 
cut-off of 0.5% WO3. 

In addition to producing parallel estimates of grade by polygonal methods, Scott 
Wilson RPA conducted a series of point validation exercises where the grade at each 
composite location is estimated from the surrounding composite data by kriging 
(using the variogram model produced by Scott Wilson RPA) and inverse distance 
methods and compared to the actual composite values at those locations.  Results 
are shown in Table 17.10.  Only those composites that had a minimum of four 
surrounding composites within the variogram range (120 m) were used in the 
analysis.  In all, 309 points were estimated from the surrounding data.  While kriging 
did not model the extremes, as well due to the high nugget value, the mean and 
median values are closer to the actual values when compared to inverse distance 
weighting.

Inverse distance cubed (ID3) is often used as an alternative to kriging because grade 
estimates for blocks that are very close to a composite generally show good 
agreement with the composite values, while block grade estimates between 
composites are not overly smoothed like those for inverse distance (ID1) and inverse 
distance squared (ID2).  A power of 4 or higher generally produces grade estimates 
similar to polygonal models, as can be observed in the reported minimums and 
maximums in Table 17.10.  Scott Wilson RPA also analyzed the point validation 
results for ID3 and kriging by linear regression.  As can be seen in Table 17.11, 
kriging shows marginally better results with a higher correlation coefficient, a lower 
intercept value, and a slope closer to 1.  A perfect linear correlation would have a 0 Y 
intercept and a slope of 1.

Note: Y=A+BX where Y is Actual, X is ID3 or Kriging. 

Based on the comparisons of means and medians for actual versus predicted 
composite grades as well as the results of the regression analysis discussed above, 
it is Scott Wilson RPA's opinion that the kriged estimates provide superior 
assessments of grade variability and distribution compared to inverse distance 
weighting and polygonal interpolation. 

17.1.9 CLASSIF ICATION 

CIM definitions (December 2005) were followed for the classification of the mineral 
resources.  Scott Wilson RPA analyzed the drill spacing within the modeled area by 
estimating the average distance between each composite and its four closest 
neighbours.  For Mactung, this was determined to be 50 m (this is skewed by the 
higher density of drilling in 2B).  A common approach is to use a threshold for the 
maximum spacing of 4/3 the variogram range in order to classify a particular area as 
indicated and 2/3 as measured.  Because of the numerous faults and high nugget 
values observed in the variography, it is Scott Wilson RPA's opinion that the 
maximum drill spacing for indicated should be no more than the variogram range for 
indicated.  Given a maximum variogram range of 120 m, which should be confirmed 
by more drilling for the upper 3 zones, the maximum distance from the block centre 
to the closest composite used in the block grade estimate was set at 60 m (i.e. 120 m 
spacing) for indicated.  No blocks were classified as measured.  A small portion of 
the upper 2B lens where the bulk sample was taken could be justifiably upgraded to 
measured; however, Scott Wilson RPA has not reviewed the bulk sample data.  The 
2B middle zone, which is interpreted as the middle limb of a z-fold, has been 
classified entirely as inferred due to the limited number of intercepts and the 
presence of abundant fault material that may suggest the limb is actually a fault zone 
rather than the limb of a fold.

17.2.1 MINE CUT-OFF GRADE 

Total indicated resources at a 0.5% WO3 cut-off grade, reported by Scott Wilson 
RPA in the April 2007 Technical Report, were used by Wardrop to design the mine.  
Wardrop loaded the data files provided by Scott Wilson RPA into the Gemcom 
Surpac™ 3D block model.   

The mine cut-off grade had to be calculated in order to estimate the mineral 
reserves.  The mine cut-off grade is calculated to be the grade at which the Net 
Present Value (NPV) of the project is equal to zero and/or when the annual net 
revenue is equal to the annual operating costs.     

The economic parameters as shown in Table 17.13 were used to calculate the mine 
cut-off grade.  The operating costs were obtain from Wardrop's economic study of 
the Mactung Project in October 2007.

18.1.1 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

The deposit consists of scheelite-bearing skarns developed near the south contact of 
a granite intrusion, known as the Cirque Lake stock. 

The main sedimentary sequence dips at low angles to the south.  The deposit 
comprises an Upper and a Lower Skarn Zone.  A statigraphic sequence of the 
property established nine mappable units, distinguished and numerically designated 
from oldest to youngest: 1, 2B, 3C, 3D, 3E, 3F, 3G, and 4 (Figure 7.1). 

Unit 2B, host to the Lower ore zone, is highly variable in thickness and composition.  
The 2B Upper ore zone provides the main source of ore for the underground mine; 
this zone is relatively flat along the strike and dips approximately 30% southwest, 
with some footwall and hanging wall undulations.  The zone's thicknesses vary 
between 10 m and 40 m and averages 26 m.  Its strike length varies from 90 to 
300 m and averages 180 m.  The 2B Lower zone is well-defined, occurring some 
20 m below 2B Upper zone.  It averages 21 m thick and 74 m long along strike, and 
is located closer to the northeast striking fault. 

A minimum thickness of 4.5 m was applied to the model and grades have been 
diluted to the minimum thickness where necessary. 

18.1.2 MINERAL RESOURCES 

The Mineral Resources report, authored by Scott Wilson RPA April 18, 2007 and 
filed as the Mactung Tungsten Deposit Technical Report, complies with NI 43-101 
regulations and provides the basis of this section and the entire technical report. 

The kriged estimate contains an indicated mineral resource of 33.0 Mt grading 0.88% 
WO3, or 290 kt of contained WO3.  An additional resource of 11.9 Mt grading 0.78% 
WO3 or 92 kt WO3 was estimated for the inferred category.  These estimates are 
reported at a block cut-off 0.5% WO3 (see Section 17.0).

18.2.1 MINE BREAK-EVEN CUT-OFF GRADE 

Total Indicated resources at a 0.5% WO3 cut-off grade, reported by RPA in the April 
2007 Technical Report, were used by Wardrop to design the mine.  Wardrop loaded 
the data files provided by RPA into the Surpac 3D block model.  Wardrop calculated 
the mining cut-off grade at 0.616% WO3, based on operating cost estimates 
developed in the October 2007 Internal Economic Update. 

18.2.2 MINERAL RESERVES BASED ON 0.616% CUT-OFF GRADE 

Using the 0.616% WO3 mining cut-off grade, Wardrop re-calculated the probable 
mineral reserve using Surpac Version 6.02 software.  The results are shown in Table 
18.1.

18.2.3 UNDERGROUND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 

NI 43-101 specifications define a mineral reserve as "the economically mineable part 
of a measured or Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary 
Feasibility Study".  Based on this definition, the mineral reserves contained in the 
Yukon side of the Mactung deposit were calculated for long-hole (LH) stope mining 
using a total recovery factor of 73.2% and 12% dilution, grading 0.1% WO3 For 
mechanized cut-and-fill (MCF) mining, mineral reserves were calculated at 83.5% 
recovery and 9% dilution, grading 0.1% WO3 (Table 18.2).

Scott Wilson RPA completed a 3D block model consisting of 10 m x 10 m x 10 m 
blocks.  The block model includes the following parameters: 

• northing, easting, and elevation coordinates 

• zone identification (Upper or Lower 2B zone, 3C, 3D and 3E zones) 

• resource category (indicated or inferred) 

• WO3 percentage 

• zone percentage (portion of the block that lies within the zone). 

The Mactung project will mine only the measured and indicated mineral resources 
located within Yukon.  LH stoping will be the primary mining method; MCF stoping 
will be used where the orebody thickness is less than 12 m thick, or in areas where 
the orebody dips steeply, such as the southeast end of the deposit.  Several stopes 
will be producing simultaneously at any given time to provide the number of working 
areas to produce 2,000 t/d. 

LH stopes will be 17 m wide and 60 m long on the strike, with 4 m rib pillars in 
between the primary and secondary stopes, and 4 m transverse pillars between 
stopes on same stope line.  Transverse and rib pillars will be permanent.  The back 
or roof of the drilling sill of the stopes will be reinforced with 2.1 m long friction 
stabilizer type bolts at 1.2 m x 1.2 m spacing and with 8 m long cable bolts on a 
1.8 m grid staggered with bolting grid.  The walls of the drilling drift will be reinforced 
with 2.1 m long friction stabilizer at 1.2 m x 1.2 m staggered grid. 

Mineralized areas 12 m thick or less and/or areas dipping over 20% will be mined 
using MCF with stope widths of up to 17 m and 3-m wide permanent rib pillars along 
the strike of the orebody.  The permanent pillars will prevent backfill material from 
contaminating the adjacent mining stope.  Mining lifts will be 4 m high, staggered 
along the foot wall and hanging wall contacts. 

LH and MCF mined out stopes will be backfilled using dewatered mill tailings and 
waste rock from mine developments. 

The mine equipment will be trackless, 10.0 t LHD units and 30 t mine trucks with 
diesel motors.  Lateral and long-hole drilling will be carried out with electrical 
hydraulic drilling rigs.  Personnel and materials will be transported in diesel-powered 
man carriers. 

Mine operations will be conducted without using water for drilling, to avoid freeze-ups 
that the marginal permafrost conditions may cause.  Dust from drilling operations will 
be controlled with drilling equipment that carries heated water in tanks to provide 
air/water mist flush.  Water will be delivered underground in 1,000 L intermediate 
bulk containers by a flat bed truck.

The mine layout includes access and haulage ramps as well as 5 m wide x 4 m high 
crosscuts, which will be bolted on a 1.8 m grid.  The ramps and crusher station will 
have galvanized steel screens bolted on the backs and walls on high areas in the 
crusher station.   

As previously indicated, the cut-off grade used for the design of the mine is 
0.616% WO3. 

To allow flexibility in mine output grade control, and to increase the productivity of 
equipment and personnel, the mine layout enables production from three or four 
individual stopes at any given time to meet the 2,000 t/d requirement.

18.4.1 MINE LAYOUT AND ACCESS 

The layout of the underground mine is illustrated in plan view as shown in Figure 
18.1 and Figure 18.2.  The drawings show the mine infrastructure in relation to the 
Upper and Lower 2B Ore Zones.  The mine is accessed through the existing adit at 
1895 m elevation and through the conveyor decline portal at 1845 m elevation.  All 
major mine infrastructures will be located in low grade ore areas of the hanging wall.  
The rock formation in the hanging wall is classified as geotechnically-competent rock. 

The orebody, composed of two superimposed mineralized layers, is approximately 
770 m long, 190 m wide and 70 m high including about 20 m of waste thickness 
between the Upper and Lower zones, dipping approximately -20° to the southwest. 

The portal close to the plant is the entrance to the conveyor decline.  The decline is a 
512 m long section at a grade of -13% that is 5 m x 5 m and ends at the underground 
crushing station.  There will be two conveyor belts installed in parallel along the 
decline.  One conveyor belt transports ore up to the surface from the primary 
crushing station and the other conveyor transports backfill material from the surface 
to an underground storage area near the primary crushing station.  The decline is 
also used for personnel access, exhaust ventilation, and for moving equipment in 
and out of the mine.

18.4.2 PRE-PRODUCTION MINE DEVELOPMENT 

Pre-production mine development consists of the excavation of underground ramps, 
drifts, raises and other workings to prepare the mine for production.  Pre-production 
development is estimated to take approximately 20 months. 

The ramps, crusher station, raises, and temporary sill pillars are shown in Figure 
18.1 and Figure 18.2.  

The 1895 m level adit, the upper portion of the South Ramp and the conveyor decline 
will be developed simultaneously to provide permanent access to existing and future 
underground mine development. 

The crusher station, backfill loading station, and two conveyor belts will be installed 
concurrent with the excavation of the north side ramps, sill pillar, and raises.  Figure 
18.3 shows the backfill loading station. 

Wardrop estimates that two teams of two shifts of experienced drift miners and one 
team of mine construction workers can develop a total of 6,358 m of ramps, 
ventilation raise, crusher station, and other underground excavation in approximately 
20 months, at an estimated rate of 10.2 m/d.  The total underground excavation will 
consist of about 4,020 m in mine infrastructure and 2,338 m in stope development. 

Table 18.4 summarizes the underground mine infrastructure development during the 
pre production period.

18.4.4 MINE TRANSPORT AND CRUSHER STATION 

All mobile equipment is rubber tired.  Mined ore will be transported in 30-t haul trucks 
from Upper 2B stopes along the South Ramp to an ore pass feeding the 
underground crusher. 

The crusher station will be 10 m wide by 24 m long by 17 m high.  It will be located at 
1778 m elevation south of the centre of the deposit and in competent ground in the 
hanging wall.  The upper 561 m long segment of the South Ramp will connect the 
crusher station with the adit at the 1895 level.  The South Ramp will be 1,206 m long, 
and will pass near the crusher station and extend from the adit down to the 
southwest end of the deposit.  Refer to Figure 18.1 and Figure 18.2 showing plan 
views of the mine developments. 

The ore will be crushed underground and conveyed up to the plant on a 1,050 mm 
(42 in) wide conveyor belt.  A second conveyor, installed beside the ore conveyor, 
will transport dewatered tailings as backfill material, from the plant down to a 
discharge point close to the crusher station.  Both conveyor structures will be 
suspended from the back by epoxy-grouted, threaded rebar rockbolts, chains, and 
turnbuckles.  The backfill material will be loaded with a LHD on returning haul trucks 
and transported to mined-out stopes. 

A second ramp, the North Ramp, is planned in the competent 3C Zone waste rock, 
which extends along the ore deposit on the north side. 

The North and South Ramps will be connected through both temporary sill pillars to 
provide haulage flexibility.  This drift will be used to truck ore and backfill material 
and, in later years, as a drilling drift for the mining of the pillar.  To reduce pre-
production capital expenses, the extension of the North and South ramps will be 
deferred to about years 5 and 6 of the project. 

After the extraction of stopes in this temporary sill pillar in operating year 9 or 10, the 
connection between the North and South Ramp will be through the west end of the 
deposit, where both ramps converge.

18.4.5 MINING NEAR THE YUKON BORDER 

Due to NATC's decision to mine only within the boundaries of the Yukon, the Upper 
and Lower North ramps cannot be extended beyond the Yukon border into NWT in 
order to access the stopes located close to the border from the east.  A buffer zone 
of 5 m will be provided to avoid any development beyond the territorial border.   

To access these stopes, a 570 m ramp will be developed northward from the South 
Ramp, and will connect with the stopes' drilling sill.  From there, a 250 m ore-
transporting ramp will be excavated to muck the LH stopes, and a 170 m long ramp 
will be directed south towards the MCF stopes. 

Both the LH stopes and MCF stopes will be accessed by crosscut drifts and short 
ramps from the haulage ramps.  The access drifts/ramps will be developed in waste, 
and will be between 40 and 100 m long. 

1 8 . 5  M I N I N G  M E T H O D S  

Two mining methods — LH and MCF stoping — will be used to extract ore from the 
Upper and Lower 2B mineralized zones.  

Both mining methods will use backfill to stabilize excavated stopes.  Dewatered mill 
tailings and waste rock from mine developments will be used as backfilling material.  
Sill pillars at 4 m wide are designed as skin pillars to confine the fill to the adjacent 
mining stope. 

Ore extracted from stopes and developments will be loaded in 30-t haul trucks by 
10.0 t LHD units and will be transported through 5 m wide, 4 m high crosscuts and 
ramps approximately 750 m up to the ore pass that feeds the jaw crusher.  On the 
return trip, trucks will be loaded with mill tailings at the backfill loading station, located 
at 450 m, through a 15% ramp, then hauled up to the mined out stope areas over an 
average distance of 1 km. 

18.5.1 LONG-HOLE MIN ING 

LH stopes will be12 to 40 m high, 60 m long and mined along stope lines.  They will 
extend up to 230 m on the strike of the orebody, leaving 4 m wide rib pillars between 
the primary and secondary stopes.  

Transverse pillars, each 4 m wide, will separate stopes at 64 m intervals on the same 
strike line, producing 60 m long compartments, which will enable independent 
mucking operations in one stope and backfilling in the preceding stope.  Figure 18.4 
shows a schematic diagram of LH stope and Figure 18.5 shows a schematic 
longitudinal section of the upper and lower 2B zones.

Wardrop divided the mine into three panels by two sequentially-numbered temporary 
sill pillars (Nos. 1 and 2) located along stoping lines in accordance with ore grade 
distribution, extraction sequence, and the ore zone dip (Figure 18.1).  

Panel A, at the west side of the deposit, contains nine sequentially-numbered stope 
lines (Nos. 1 through 9).  This panel is mined in the final years because of its below-
average ore grades. 

Panel B is located at the centre of the deposit, closer to the crusher station, and will 
contain five stope sequentially-numbered lines (No. 10 through 14).  This panel will 
contain average-grade ore and is mined after year five. 

Panel C, located at the east side of the deposit, will contain nine sequentially-
numbered stope lines (No. 15 through 23).  Stope lines No. 15 through No. 18 will 
contain high- grade ore, and will be mined in the first five years.  Stope lines No. 19 
through No. 23 present steeply-dipping ore on the south side, requiring MCF mining 
along contour lines, as shown in.  The central and northern areas of these stope lines 
are mined using the LH method.  The southeast area is mined using the MCF 
method (Figure 18.1). 

LH stoping in the Lower 2B Zone will also be carried out in three panels following the 
same long-term mining sequence as in Upper 2B.  The panels contain fewer stope 
lines and shorter length of stope line than Upper 2B Zone (Figure 18.2). 

Based on geotechnical assessment, the stopes are stable enough for stope lines that 
are parallel and 21 m apart are excavated parallel and in between the primary stope 
lines, leaving 4 m rib pillars on either side separating them from adjoining primary 
stopes (Figure 18.5). 

Based on the mining sequence, the 60 m long secondary stopes will be mined when 
the adjoining primary stopes on both sides are completely backfilled. 

The bulk of the backfill volume will be hauled through the drilling drift of the active 
stope, dumped close to the sill of the transverse pillar, and then pushed into the 
mined-out stope with a small remote-operated bulldozer.  Bulldozers will then push 
the backfill tight against the back of the stope from the stope above, through 4 m 
wide/4 m high crosscuts driven through the rib pillar (Figure 18.5). 

Backfilling of the mined out stopes will be performed by remote-controlled equipment 
as it is unsafe for personnel to work in the area. 

Drill and extraction drifts sized will be driven into the ore as close to the hanging wall 
and footwall contacts as possible.  

Stopes will be aligned along the strike of the deposit with azimuths approximately 
northwest, and have hanging wall and footwall contacts sloping along the dip of the 
deposit at approximately 25 to 30% to the southwest.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 18-16 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Drill drifts are driven in the centre line of the stope with the back of the drift 2 m below 
the contact of the hanging wall.  The drift is later slashed to 17 m wide, defining a 
60 m long and 17 m wide horizontal sill level needed for parallel long-hole drilling. 

Extraction or mucking levels will be driven along the footwall and at the centre line of 
the stope.  

The wedge of ore left on the back of the drill level is blasted at the same time as LH 
holes with the use of upper blast holes (Figure 18.4). 

Ore losses and grade dilution are caused by the blasting of mineralized areas of 
changing shape along the blasting length or burden, by blasting overbreak and by 
blasting of areas with layering of waste-ore contacts and possible mini faulting.  
These conditions are accounted for in the ore reserve and grade dilution calculations 
using an equivalent 0.6 m waste dilution on hanging wall and footwall contacts.  A 
loss equivalent to 0.2 m thick is included in the estimate for ore left on the stope floor 
after mining.   

In some cases, where footwall contacts present strong undulations, mucking drifts 
will be driven, crossing the waste rock areas between undulations.  LH stoping ore 
above these levels will be recovered with additional mucking drifts in ore above the 
undulations to avoid dilution with waste.  The ore left between the general transport 
drift and the short mucking drifts above will be mined by blasting short upper blast 
holes (back slashing).   

The back of drilling sill level will be reinforced with 2.1 m friction stabilizer bolts, using 
a 1.2 x 1.2 m staggered pattern and 8 m long grouted cable bolting on staggered 
1.2 m by 1.2 m grids.  The walls of the sill drifts will be reinforced with friction 
stabilizer bolts, installed on the same grid as the back.  

The extraction of the ore will retreat towards the haulage ramp (South Ramp for 
Upper 2B Zone) via a vertical slot raise, 2 m by 2 m in section, driven in the Upper 
2B Zone at the north end of each 60 m long stope and in the Lower 2B Zone at the 
south end of the stope.  An In-The-Hole (ITH) drilling rig, producing 104.6 mm 
diameter blast holes, will operate on the 17 m wide top sill.   

Ore in the stope will be broken by blasting one or two rings of seven drill holes using 
ANFO, at a total powder factor of 0.36 kg/t (0.8 lb/ton).  On average, a total of 132 kg 
of explosives will be used for each blast hole.  The explosive will be delivered to the 
blasting area using a boom truck with weather treads on tires.  

The ore from the Lower 2B Zone is hauled to the crusher ore pass through the Lower 
North Ramp, passing through Sill Pillar No.1 and reaching the ore pass drift.  Ore 
from the Upper 2B Zone is hauled through mucking crosscuts, the South Ramp, and 
an ore pass drift.  The ore is then dumped onto a grizzly at the ore pass where a 
rockbreaker breaks oversize rocks.  The ore pass, with a storage capacity of 
400 tonnes, has a discharge chute with a chain gate and a vibrating grizzly feeder for 
regulating the feed to the crusher.

Mining will progress, retreating along stope lines from north to south in the Upper 
Zone and from south to north in the Lower 2B Zone.  In the long stoping lines of the 
Upper 2B Zone, the backfill of stopes located at the north end of the stopes lines will 
be carried out from the Upper North Ramp without interrupting the extraction upon 
retreat of the next stope on line.  Centre and southern stopes will be backfilled by 
trucking plant tailings and waste rocks through the South Ramp.  In the short stoping 
lines of the Lower 2B Zone (80 m long), the backfill will be carried from the Upper 
North Ramp once the stope line is completely mined out. 

LH stopes, 60 m long on average, will require a minimum of approximately three 
months for development, extraction, and backfilling.   

In general, the Lower 2B zone stopes have higher grades than the Upper 2B Zone 
stopes and will be mined first, securing higher grade ore in the first three years of 
operation.  It is estimated that the length of these stopes, averaging 80 m and the 
waste intercalation of approximately 20 m between the Upper and Lower 2B zones, 
will have no impact on the stability of the mining operation above the Upper 2B Zone. 

18.5.2 MECHANIZED CUT-AND-FILL  MINING 

The total height of the MCF stopes is up to 12 m high (3 cuts), 17 m wide, and 50 to 
120 m along strike, with a permanent rib pillar of 3 m between stopes.  In areas with 
wider, steeply dipping ore, the breast mining will advance across the strike of the 
formation from footwall to hanging wall, approximately 60-80 m apparent width as 
shown in Figure 18.6.  Each cut will be 4 m high along the entire length of the stope.  
All extraction will be carried out using breast blasting, advancing 4.6 m per blast, and 
beginning at lower elevation stopes.  LHDs with a 10.0 t capacity and 30 t trucks will 
load the blasted ore and haul it up to the Crusher Ore Pass. 

The back of the first 4 m high cut will be reinforced with 2.1 m long friction stabilizer 
bolts and 16 m long grouted cable bolts.  Both systems will be installed on a 
staggered grid.  All stope walls will be reinforced with 2.1 m long friction stabilizer 
bolts drilled on a 1.2 m grid.  

After the first cut is mined out, the empty stope will be backfilled within one metre of 
the back with either waste rock from underground developments or with tailings 
backfill material capped with rocks to facilitate movement of wheel equipment.  The 
space without backfill will be used as undercut for the next blasting. 

The next 4 m high cut or lift will be by breast-blasted on top of the now-backfilled 
previous cut, along the whole length of the stope.  This sequence will be repeated up 
to the hanging wall contact, three or four cuts high.  The back will be rockbolted, this 
time without cable bolts.  After backfilling the empty stope, the sequence is repeated 
until the hanging wall is reached.  The dangling cables in the stope will be cut with a 
torch after each lift.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The back of the second cut and each successive cut will be reinforced with 2.1 m 
long friction stabilizer bolts, installed on a staggered 1.2 m grid between the 
remaining 16 m long cables that were installed on the first cut.  Cable bolts 16 m long 
were selected to obtain an 8 m thick bolted layer above the upper cut. 

MCF mining was selected for ore production from the southeast end of the Upper 2B 
Zone of steep slopes and limited ore thickness.  In this area, some 13,000 t of ore 
resources are located under the adit at elevation 1895.  A crown ore pillar 20 m long, 
20 m wide, and 10 m high containing approximately 13,000 t will be left below a 10 m 
thick waste rock crown pillar. 

To access the drill sill of these stopes located close to Yukon-NWT border, a 570 m 
long ramp will be excavated from the South Ramp.  From there, a 250 m ore 
transporting ramp for the LH stopes and a 170 m long ramp accessing the MCF area 
will be excavated.  

Long-hole stopes and MCF stopes will be accessed from the ramps with crosscuts in 
waste 40 to 100 m long. 

During the first five years of operation, higher grade ore located above the crusher 
station level will be mined so as to reduce the payback period (see Figure 18.6).  Ore 
will be hauled down the ramp by trucks; on the return trip, the trucks will haul backfill 
material up the ramp.  In years 6 to 10, mining will be carried out in lower grade ore 
areas located below the crusher level. 

Ore losses averaging 16.7% and grade dilution averaging 9% will result during MCF 
mining of an average 12 m high, 17 m wide stope.  Main losses are the result of a 
permanent 3 m wide pillar on a maximum 17 m wide stope (15%) and 1.7% losses 
after slashing of stope dipping contact walls (hanging wall and footwall).  Dilution with 
waste rock and tailings backfill is the result of steeply dipping hanging wall and 
footwall contacts and sand fill material dug out with blasted ore from the backfilled 
floor.

18.6.1 BOREHOLE DESCRIPTION 

NATC provided basic information of their drilling database on length, core recovery, 
and geological description in terms of Mactung geological rock codes.  Wardrop 
determined the geotechnical parameters based on a visual assessment of core 
photographs from 22 boreholes from the MS-series diamond drill holes.  This series 
was selected because its rock quality designation (RQD), one of the parameters for 
rock mass quality, had been previously determined. 

Table 18.6 lists the boreholes evaluated for rock mass classification and the 
boreholes column information.  Figure 18.7 shows the plan for the MS series 
diamond drill holes (in red).

18.6.2 SUMMARY OF GEOTECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS 

For the purpose of the initial geotechnical analysis at Mactung, the Barton rock mass 
rating is classified using six categories, ranging from Extremely Good to Very Poor.  
Table 18.7 provides the Q range associated with each classification. 

The factors for Jw and SRF in the Tunnelling Quality Index (Barton et al, 1974) for 
Mactung's open stope dimension with the use of Stability Graph analysis are set at 
1.0.  This is assuming that the joints have non-existent to minor inflow of less than 
5 L/min for the Jw factor.  The SRF factor is estimated based on medium stress 
environment where joints are moderately clamped but not overly stressed.

The criteria set forth by Wardrop for the rock mass classification of Mactung drill 
cores are as follows:  

• RQD for the overburden is set at zero (0) and the remaining reported RQD 
of zero (0) in very poor ground condition to gouge and fault is being adjusted 
to 10-20% upon visual inspection of core photographs. 

• Jn is set at 1-2 rating, representing Good quality and massive core with no 
or few joints to one joint set.  A rating of 2-3 or "one joint to one set plus 
random" is set for RQD less than 75% based on observation of the cores.  
No orientation was measured. 

• Ja for unaltered joint walls with surface staining to tightly healed is set at a 
rating of 0.75-1.  The presence of softening or low-friction clay mineral 
coating such as talc and graphite is set at a rating of 4.  A rating of 4, 6 to 10 
is classified for shears, gouge and faults, depending on the condition of the 
core. 

• The active stress (parameter Jw and SRF) is set to 1.0 for dry rock mass, 
subjected to medium stress conditions.

Results from the rock mass rating classified the 2B and 2BL (Upper and lower 2B) as 
being Very Good to Extremely Good.  This classification is consistent with data 
reported by Strathcona Minerals Limited (Aug. 21, 1982) and Amax (May-October, 
1973; revised Oct.1, 1984), which state the following: 

• Hanging wall: Rock is argillaceous sediment altered to hornfels which is 
massive, very hard, and very competent.  No difficulty was experienced 
during bulk sampling underground development in hornfels, except for 
higher than normal bit wear and steel breakage during bulk sampling (Amax, 
May-Oct., 1973). 

• Ore zone: Generally in good ground with only areas within fault zones likely 
to cause ground control problems in local areas (Strathcona, Aug. 21, 1982).  
Mineralized pyroxene-garnet skarn is massive, very hard, abrasive and very 
competent.  No difficulty was encountered during the development of the 
skarn during the bulk sampling (Amax, May-October, 1973). 

• Footwall: Rock is mica schist which is massive with slight foliation, is softer 
than the skarn and hornfels, but very competent (Amax, May-October, 
1973). 

Strathcona's 1982 report indicated that the rock types appear to be very tight, with a 
few vugs with very little moisture contained within the rock. 

During the bulk sampling program in 1973, Amax reported that surface drilling cores 
contained 6.1 to 9.1 m (20 to 30 ft) of gouge, indicating the presence of some areas 
of extensive faulting in the hornfels.  However, the underground development during 
the bulk sampling program encountered several faults at 38.1 to 53.4 m (125 to 
175 ft) interval.  The faults ranged from 12.7 to 609.6 mm (0.5 to 24") thick, with 
frozen gouge material.

JOINT SETS 

D. Stewart (1980) identified five joint sets for Mactung (Table 18.9).  Joint set 1, or 
family 1, was identified as the strongest fracture trend and "probably consists of 
faulting and parallel sympathetic" (D. Stewart, 1980).This set is reported by Stewart 
to be evident in surface mapping.  Flat dipping structures were reported by Stewart to 
be minor.

18.6.4 ESTIMATED SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS 

SUPPORT CATEGORIES 

Wardrop estimated the support categories based on the geotechnical data analysis 
for the anticipated rock mass quality.  The Mactung rock mass categories detailed in 
Table 18.7 are used to define the support types and classes.  Table 18.10 details the 
ground support classes for each range of the rock mass quality identified at Mactung. 

Table 18.10 Ground Support Categories 

Support 
Class 

Rock Mass 
Quality Ranges of Q' 

Type Ia Good 10 to 40 
Type Ib Fair 4 to 10 
Type IIa Poor 1 to 4 
Type IIb Poor 1 to 4 
Type IIIa Very Poor 0.1 to 1 
Type IIIb Extremely Poor Less than 0.1 

 

The Type IIa and Type IIb support classes apply to the similar range of Q rating.  The 
distinction between the two support classes is the stand-up time of the excavation, 
which is described below. 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 18-27 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

SUPPORT TYPES 

Pr imary Suppor t  

Table 18.11 outlines the primary support specification types for each of the ground 
support categories addressed from the following section.  This general guideline can 
be upgraded to reflect the actual ground conditions encountered once excavation 
commences.   

Type I support is sub-divided into two categories: Type Ia and Type Ib.  The only 
distinction between the two categories is that Type Ia (for Good quality rock) has a 
bolt spacing of 1.8 m x 1.8 m, while Type Ib (for Fair quality rock) has a bolt spacing 
of 1.5 m x 1.5 m.  A total of five bolts are recommended per pattern, whereby one 
bolt is placed at each corner and one bolt in the centre of the pattern (staggered 
pattern).  This bolting pattern will provide better confinement and superimposition of 
support onto the rock mass, thus avoiding loading of the screen with material. 

Type II (a and b) support requires that bolting and screening is performed as required 
to the floor.  The distinction between the two support classes is its stand-up time.  
When the stability of the opening is an issue, the advance rate must be reduced to 
approximately 70% from the full round of 4.0 m and Type IIb support with 50 mm of 
shotcrete is recommended. 

Type III support is for Very Poor to Extremely Poor ground conditions, where the 
bolting pattern is reduced to approximately 50%.  This support system may only be 
required in exceptional areas with very poor ground conditions at Mactung.  Advance 
geotechnical data collection and analysis performed in the future will provide an 
estimated percentage of underground excavation requiring this support system.  The 
Type III support system has not been considered in the cost estimate.  

The common approach to Type IIIa support is to lightly scale a majority of the loose 
material, wash the area, and apply 50 mm of shotcrete.  The shotcrete must be 
allowed to set for a minimum of 8 hours before the installation of rock support and 
screening, followed by an additional 50 mm of shotcrete over the bolts and screens.  
When squeezing or highly deformed ground is encountered, the screening and 
bolting pattern is recommended to continue to floor elevation. 

Type IIIb support is similar to Type IIIa, with the addition of lattice girders and spiling.  
The lattice griders are recommended to be spaced 1 m apart and the spiling are 
installed over the lattice griders.  This allows the lattice griders to support the tail 
ends of the spiling.  The spiling is recommended at least one round ahead (4.0 m) at 
25 cm spacing across the back, drilled sub-parallel (inclined +10°) to the back and 
slightly along the side walls.  The spiling will increase stand-up time and reduce the 
unravelling of the weak material from the back while shotcrete is applied.  If ground 
conditions are weak but not unravelling once open, and the application of shotcrete 
can be performed successfully, the application of fibre-reinforced shotcrete is 
recommended followed by appropriate support installation.

When necessary, the application of fibre reinforced shotcrete in selected areas is 
recommended for the application of the initial layer of shotcrete in Type IIb and III 
support.  Before the application of shotcrete, the corners of the excavation must be 
clean of debris and blasted muck without jeopardizing the safety of personnel and 
equipment.  All the support had to be installed at least 30 cm from the face with the 
exception of Type IIIb where the support has to be installed to the face.  The 
application of shotcrete may be required at the face to provide additional confinement 
if the material from the face has the tendency to cave-in. 

All the bolts installed had to be plated and tensioned to provide additional surface 
confinement to the support system.  The torquing of face plate and nut can be 
achieved with a jackleg with air pressure greater than 90 psi.  This provides sufficient 
pressure on the support system. 

The screen can be pre-installed either with the use of a 30 cm length frictional 
stabilizer bolt or with the assistant of a screen pusher.  The screen should overlap for 
30 cm. 

The ground conditions at Mactung are estimated to be mostly good to fair with some 
poor ground conditions.  In faulted ground, very poor conditions can be encountered.  
This rock mass quality estimation is made based on visual inspection of the cores. 

Est imated Suppor t  Types by Geolog ica l  Uni ts  

Generally, each geological unit is in Good to Very Good rock mass where Type I 
(a and b) support is required based on the estimated Q ratings (Table 18.12).  These 
support design estimates are used as the basis for the support cost estimate 
(Table 18.13) for the feasibility study.  When detailed and advanced geotechnical 
data and analyses are available, the support systems have to be upgraded to the 
ground conditions. 

The support requirements will be upgraded according to ground conditions during 
development, based on the recommended support type indicated in Table 18.11.  
Geotechnical mapping is recommended for every advance to determine the rock 
mass quality and support requirements.  Table 18.13 lists the estimated support 
length and specifications for excavation types.

Permanent  Opening Suppor t  Types 

Wardrop recommends Type Ib support with 1.5 m x 1.5 m spacing with screening 
(Table 18.11) permanent openings such as the fresh air intake adit, conveyor decline 
and haulage ramp, and crusher station.  The systematic bolting will be approximately 
1.2 m above the floor.  Screen and bolts will be plated and tensioned with nominal 
face advance of 4.0 m.  Support types will be upgraded as required based on the 
rock mass conditions.  The suggested support element is forged head resin rebar 
with screening on the back (roof).   

Cable bolts will be required at intersections or when the span of the opening is 
greater than 5 m. 

The crusher station (10 m W x 17 m H x 24 m L) will require complete support to the 
floor (Table 18.13) with cable bolting spaced 1.8 m x 1.8 m at 5 m length starting at 
approximately 4.5 m above ground in all excavation faces.  This will allow any sliding 
wedge to be supported and secured before equipment is installed for long term 
stability of the excavations and safety to both personnel and equipment.  A nominal 
50 mm unreinforced shotcrete sprayed on top of the screen is required (Figure 18.9).  
The crusher station is designed for a factor of safety (FOS) greater than 2. 

Temporary  Opening Suppor t  Des ign 

In crosscut and drift, and in temporary opening support design, frictional bolts will be 
used on the back and walls.

SECONDARY SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR INTERSECTION AND SILL 

In tersect ion Suppor t  

Intersections generate greater spans and expose the back to the wedge formation 
when the correct joint set angles intercept.  All intersections that generate 7.0 m wide 
span (diagonally) have to be supported by secondary support system (Figure 18.10).  

Intersection support is a secondary support system supplementing the primary 
support system addressed in Table 18.11 and Table 18.13. 

Figure 18.10 Intersection Wedge Analysis (7 m Span) 

 

The intersection supports are designed to have an FOS greater than 2.  The support 
must extend at least two to three rows before approaching and after the intersection.  
This support system provides potential stability issues caused by wedge 
development, while the primary support addresses the unravelling of material within 
the secondary support.  All intersections in the conveyor decline and permanent 
openings are recommended to be supported with secondary support. 

Wardrop recommends that detailed geotechnical mapping be performed on every 
intersection, and wedge analysis be performed to identify potential wedge formation.  
The spacing for the secondary support is recommended to be 1.8 m x 1.8 m and can 
be more widely spaced, depending on the rock mass quality for the back.  These

supports must be installed prior to the complete development of the intersecting 
excavations. 

Si l l  Suppor t  in  Long-hole and Mechanized Cut-and-Fi l l  Stopes 

The drill drive will be driven in the centre of the stope at 5 m W advancing one drill 
and blast round ahead of the 6.0 m side wall slash.  Sill support is a secondary 
support system supplementing the primary support system, which is required for 
long-hole stopes.  The 17 m wide sill will require plain strand cable bolts of 8 m 
length spaced at 1.8 m x 1.8 m, plated and tensioned.  This provides an FOS of 
approximately 1.2 for the roof wedge (Figure 18.11).  Cable bolting must be 
performed once the advance reaches 20 m or less when poor ground conditions are 
encountered. 

Supplementary support in MCF depends on the number of lifts per stope.  The 
average total stope height for the MCF is 12 m with mining performed at 4 m high 
lifts.  The recommended cable bolt support length for the MCF is 16 m.  The cable 
bolt pattern is similar to LH stoping. 

The cable bolting will be performed while the initial lift is being developed.  The 16 m 
length cable bolt allows the following two lifts to be mined without additional cable 
bolting.  This allows the final lift to be supported by 8 m length cable bolt.  The cable 
bolts are design to yielding an FOS at approximately 1.2.  Modified strand cable bolts 
are recommended for this application.

18.6.5 STOPE DIMENSIONING 

Open stope dimensioning for the Mactung analysis was empirically estimated with 
the Modified Stability Graph (Potvin, 1988 and Nickson, 1992). The stability graph 
design procedure is based on the calculation of two factors: the Modified Stability 
Number (N'), representing the ability of the rock mass to stand up under given 
conditions, and the Shape Factor (S) or hydraulic radius, which accounts for the 
stope size. 

MODIF IED STABIL ITY  NUMBER 

N' is based on Q with alterations to the active stress factor (Jw/SRF) on Q by setting 
the Jw/SRF factor to 1.0.  This alteration yields the Modified Tunnelling Index (Q') 
where:

Therefore, the Q for this geotechnical investigation is equivalent to the Q'. 

N' consisted of: 

N' = Q' x A x B x C 

Where: 

Q' = Modified Tunneling Quality Index 
A = Rock Stress Factor 
B = Joint Orientation Adjustment Factor
C = Gravity Adjustment Factor 

The shape factor, commonly known as the hydraulic radius, for the stope surface 
under consideration is computed as follows:

Where: 

w = Width of Stope or Openings (m)
h = Height or Length of Stope (m) 

The method proposed by the stability graph is based on Canadian case histories.  It 
provides a preliminary guideline for open stope dimensioning.  Modifications of its 
parameters are required to reflect the site conditions at Mactung and as detailed 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 18-35 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

geotechnical information is available.  Back analysis on the stope performance is 
essential to alter the parameters to suit the underground conditions.   

STABILITY GRAPH ANALYSIS 

Table 18.14 shows stope dimensioning for the Mactung project.  The modified 
stability number factors are presented in Table 18.14.  The average dip of the 
orebody for long-hole mining is reported to be at 17° with the average stope panel 
dimension of 60 m in length and 20 to 40 m in height. 

An estimated "A" factor of 1.0 is assumed if the strength of the intact rock is greater 
that the induced strength and where the hanging wall is at relaxation, in this case 
moderately dipping. 

The "B" factor accounts for the joint orientation with respect to the stope surface.  
Estimation is made for the stope back and the walls based on the major critical joint 
set 1. 

The gravity adjustment factor C is 2 for gravity fall and slabbing for the vertical 
hanging wall with an inclination of critical joint set 1 at 74° is 3.5 and for the stope 
back. 

The rock mass tunnelling index for Mactung is good, with ground conditions for Q' at 
zones 2B and 2BL determined to be 82 to 98, respectively.  The A, B, and C factors 
for variable stope dimension and length are presented in Table 18.14. 

A stope with a strike length of 60 m, a height of 20-30 m, and a width of 17 m yields a 
hanging wall shape factor or hydraulic radius of 7.5 to 10 and 6.6 for the back; this 
equates to a stable stope (Table 18.14).

The report from Amax (May-October, 1973) confirmed that the XC4S test stope at 
the contact of B and C unit with excavation size of 9.1 m x 15.2 m (30 ft x 50 ft) with

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

an average height of 2.8 m (9.1 ft) was very competent and required no rock bolting 
during development with no loosening of material from the stope back.  One-third of 
the stope back was in hornfels (hanging wall) and the other two-thirds in skarn (ore).  
The contact was bolted afterward to prevent loosening of material. 

Plotting these example values onto the stability graph provides a general guideline to 
the stability of the stope with respect to rock mass conditions and stope size. 

Figure 18.12 shows a stope with hydraulic radius of 6-12.  The stability of the stope 
can range from stable with support to stable, mainly depending on the quality of the 
ground conditions, stress factor, joint orientations, and orientation of the stope.

18.6.6 NUMERICAL MODELL ING 

A two-dimensional numerical modelling with Phase 2 was performed to analyze 
stope to pillar dimensioning and stress conditions around excavations for Mactung. 

Mactung numerical models were built based on the mine layout plans prepared from 
Surpac and AutoCAD (Figure 18.13).  The pillar-to-stope width ratio for this analysis 
is 0.235 or 4 m W pillar to 17 m W stope.  This arrangement provides higher recovery 
compared to the initial design.  

Figure 18.13 Numerical Model Cross Section 

 

DEFORMATION AND STRENGTH PARAMETERS 

The deformation and strength parameters (Table 18.15) for numerical modelling 
were based on rock mechanics test results presented in the report entitled "Room 
and Pillar Analysis for the Mactung Project" (D. Steward, 1980).  The ore properties 
were assumed to represent hanging walls and footwalls since most of the mining 
stopes are located in the ore (2B zone).  The assumed unconsolidated backfill 
parameters are shown in Table 18.16. 

The backfill at Mactung is unconsolidated where initial loading occurs as body force 
or self weight and remains distressed.  Walls on the open stopes are estimated to be 
relaxed before backfilling.  

Hoek Brown failure criterion was used for modelling and the estimated intact 
parameters are presented in Table 18.17.

IN-SITU STRESSES 

Cantung in-situ stress measurement results (AMEC, 2000) from overcoring are 
utilized for Mactung numerical modelling.  The Cantung site is about 160 km south of 
Mactung project, so it is assumed that the in-situ stress measurements are similar at 
the current level of study.  Detail stress measurement is recommended for Mactung 
during the advance geotechnical analysis. 

The principal stress values at 2900 ft (884 m) depth are presented in Table 18.19.

The major, intermediate, and minor principal stresses at overburden depth of 300 m 
are 55.5 MPa, 39.5 MPa, and 22.5 MPa, respectively, based on stress gradients 
listed in Table 18.19. 

For the purpose of 2D numerical modelling, the major principal stress is along ore 
zone for stopes looking from the southeast where the horizontal stress is assumed to 
be 55.5 MPa, with overburden (minor principal stress) at 22.5 MPa, and 39.5 MPa 
out-of-plane stress.

Figure 18.16 Mining Sequence Schematic 

 

 

Mining Sequence 

The 2D numerical analysis models the stope as being fully excavated along 200 m of 
ore strike length.  At the current stage, the backfill material is considered to be 
unconsolidated backfill consisting of classified and filtered mill tailings and 
development waste rock.  During actual mining, the 200 m strike length panel will not 
be fully extracted in a stage (approximately a year) and will be partially mined and 
filled. 

The initial three stages simulate primary stope extraction and, at the fourth stage, two 
secondary and one primary stopes are mined.  This sequence represents a typical 
cross section for the mine sequence. 

This model provides initial assessment and understanding of mining induced 
stresses and the analysis is limited for complex mining sequences with array of ribs 
and regional pillars.  To better analyze the mining sequence during detailed design, 
3D numerical modelling is required.

ANALYSIS  RESULTS 

Tensile or relaxation zones and shear failures on the stopes' back and side walls are 
typical of open stoping and expected during mining stages 1 to 5 (Figure 18.17).  
Dilution is expected on stope walls having contact with waste.  The supplementary 
support or sill support with cable bolts on full sill span will address issue pertaining to 
tensile or back relaxation. 

The 4 m W pillar acts as a "skin pillar" or barrier preventing unconsolidated backfill 
from diluting into adjacent mining stope.  Part of the 4 m pillar yields in tension and 
the rest of the pillar will be relaxed and confined by the backfill based on the analysis. 

The backfill does not carry any load because of unconsolidated characteristics where 
backfill placement is not "tight" to stope back and the stope walls are in relaxation 
during deposition. 

Secondary stopes can be observed to be under mid to low stress conditions in 
stages 2 and 3 on the Upper and Lower 2B zones.  During stages 4 and 5, corners of 
the secondary stopes will experience higher stresses on the southern limb.  This may 
cause strain bursting at the development and borehole squeezing may be expected. 

Figure 18.18 outlines the extent of the yielding zone (13.3 m) where wedge formation 
or unravelling of the back may occur.  Supplementary sill support, with cable bolts at 
8.0 m length by 1.8 m by 1.8 m (Figure 18.11) based on an unwedge analysis, yields 
an FOS of 1.2, which is stable. 

The model indicates that stoping with 17 m W stopes and with a 4 m W pillar is 
feasible with a pillar safety factor of 1.0 (Figure 18.19).

18.6.7 BACKFILL 

Mactung's backfill material consists of classified, filtered, and unconsolidated mine 
tailings, and underground development waste rock.  Wardrop recommends backfill of 
similar particle size distribution to hydraulic or slurry backfill.   

Hydraulic backfill specifications suggested by Hassani & Archibald (1998) are: 

• particle size distribution containing less than 20% (by weight) of minus 
10 µm 

• percolation rate above 10 cm/h. 

The presence of significant fines (sized less than or equal to 10 µm) reduces the 
effectiveness of stope drainage and may result in liquefaction.  Tailings are typically 
de-slimed to reduce fines to less than 20% by weight for this application. 

The particle size distribution for Cantung tailings, reported by Falcon test work, and 
Mactung tailings size analyses, by Lakefield Research (1985), indicates that less 
than 20% and 15% of the size distribution, respectively, is minus10 µm (Figure 
18.20) based on extrapolation from the available data.

similar specifications to the hydraulic fill even though the mine is considered to be in

marginal permafrost where no water saturation is anticipated.  This is to ensure that if 
there is a presence of water underground by external sources, it allows the 
unconsolidated backfill to drain.  This reduces possibilities of liquefaction induced by 
dynamic forces such as blast vibration, etc. 

The tailings will be filtered to approximately 10-15% moisture content and 
transported underground as backfill material.  Although the tailings are filtered, 
containment barriers or bulkheads are still recommended at draw points to seal off 
backfill material, to prevent it from entering into crosscuts and drifts and to provide 
drainage to the system. 

The particle size distribution of Mactung tailings will be suitable as backfill material 
according to the available data. 

Wardrop recommends tests to confirm the percolation rate of the mill tailings to 
ensure that the backfill drains at a percolation rate above 10 cm/h (Hassani & 
Archibald, 1998). 

MACTUNG BACKFILL  REQUIREMENTS

PERMAFROST AND FROZEN BACKFILL CONSIDERATIONS 

Rock temperature measurements were performed at Mactung in September 1979; 
the measurements were revised in April 1982 by H. Heinicke and September 1982 
by D. Stewart.

Rock Mass Temperature Measurement  1979-1980 by H.  Hein icke 

In the summer of 1979, nine Resistance Temperature Determination (RTD) devices 
and two thermometers were installed in crosscut No.1 north to measure rock mass 
heat response because it represents typical "weaker" rock.  The 100 ft long (30.5 m) 
crosscut was curtained off and a Koehring K-Master Model B100D with a 
90,000 BTU capacity heater was inserted under the curtain to heat the room.   

RTDs were installed in drill holes at depths between 22 to 26" (558.8 to 660.4 mm) 
and held in place by wedges.  One thermometer was hung beside a RTD; the other 
was taped to an RTD and inserted into a drill hole (H. Heinicke, September 1979, 
revised April 1982). 

Heinicke experienced difficulty keeping the heater operating continuously and had no 
means of measuring the BTU generated by the heaters during the rock mass heat 
response measurement.  He discovered that operating the heater for five hours 
raised the temperature above freezing; he also discovered that heat conduction 
through the rock is good (H. Heinicke, September 1979, revised April 1982). 

In August and September of 1980, a 40 ft (12.2 m) remuck room was curtained off at 
the intersection of the main drift and heated by a space heater for 5 days while 
monitored by 18 RTDs.  The remuck is located 500 ft (152.4 m) from the portal at 
14 ft W x 10 ft H (4.3 m W x 3.0 m H) with muck pile at the face.  The heater was a 
Koehring K-Master B1500 rated at 150,000 BTU. 

Heinicke commented that the heat applied during the trial was excessive compared 
to diesel equipment and mine ventilation systems.  However, the rapid heat transfer 
indicated that "it may be difficult to prevent a rind of thawed rock to develop around 
any mine openings exposed to diesel equipment" (H. Heinicke, September 1979, 
revised April 1982). 

Thawing of frozen faults and fall of material were reported during this experiment. 

Rock Mass Temperature Measurement  1982 by D.  Stewar t  

D. Stewart performed rock temperature measurements in 62 previously-drilled holes 
from underground and surface in 1982.  Temperatures in boreholes were measured 
by thermistor-type probes at 25-ft (7.6 m) intervals.  Underground borehole 
measured temperatures ranged from -1.182°C to -2.086°C from vertical depth from 
surface at 163 to 448 ft (49.7 to 136.6 m). 

Underground borehole measurements (47 holes) were utilized to derive linear and 
multiple regression expression.  The ice point in the vicinity of temperature 
measurement locations is predicted to occur sub-parallel to the ground surface at 
depth of approximately 900 ft (274.4 m).

Stewart indicated that the Mactung property is located in a marginal permafrost 
environment. 

FROZEN BACKFILL 

Mactung backfill is composed of filtered mill tailings and underground development 
waste rock.  At this stage of design the filtered mill tailings is assumed to be 
unconsolidated by freezing because of the marginal permafrost conditions.  The use 
of filtered tailings as frozen backfill material is currently under investigation by mines 
in the Arctic. 

Mactung backfill is therefore considered to be passive.  "Skin pillars" are allocated on 
mined stopes to prevent unconsolidated fill from contaminating adjacent mining 
stopes.  Drilling deviations are to be closely monitored for blast control to avoid pillar 
degradation during mining. 

An example of the usage of frozen backfill is at the Polaris Mine, where broken shale 
with 10-13% moisture was left to freeze for two years before the adjacent pillar was 
mined, exposing the 80 m H x 14 m W frozen fill.  Polaris permafrost conditions 
extend up to 500 m below surface with rock temperatures varying from -14°C near 
the surface to -3°C at the bottom of the mine.  Freezing conditions exist throughout 
the mine workings where the mine is dry and the rock remains very competent when 
frozen (K. Dewing et al., 2006).  Refrigerated intake air was delivered underground to 
counterbalance input heat from mining equipment, fresh water in the backfill, and 
electrical power for two months in the summer.  Cemented rockfill was also utilized in 
areas with increased lithostatic loads induced by over strata settling. 

Additional research is required to determine the mix design for treated mill tailings 
and development waste rock to obtain frozen fill.  This design is also to be tested on 
site during operation. 

18.6.8 GEOTECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS 

The rock mass quality at Mactung was reported to be very good.  The geotechnical 
data collection made in this investigation is based on RQD information provided by 
Mactung mainly on MS series drill holes; rock mass parameters were determined 
based on visual interpretation core photographs. 

Initial ground condition estimates indicate good ground conditions, but detailed 
geotechnical drill information and data collection is required on the main 
infrastructure to make a more complete evaluation.  Additional geotechnical drill 
holes are recommended to better define the rock mass quality surrounding major 
infrastructure and to determine the conditions of major faulting. 

Although ground conditions are reported to be competent, ground support is required 
to ensure the safety of underground workers and equipment. Wardrop recommends 
installing of ground support to all permanent openings as the support guarantees 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 18-50 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

safety of workers, equipment, and major infrastructure and to avoid future ground 
condition rehabilitation.  The support requirement provided is based on the current 
understanding of Mactung ground conditions.  The ground support systems design 
does not take into consideration the effect of permafrost.  This is because the 
permafrost condition of the mine is reported to be marginal.  

Ground movement monitoring is recommended so that the support system and its 
requirements can be optimized using the experience obtained during operations.   

An open stope with dimensions of 20 to 40 m H with an opening of 17 m W x 60 m L 
is stable based on the stability graph analysis.  These are non-man entry stopes.  It 
is recommended to support the back (roof) of the 17 m stopes with cable bolts 
allowing the support wedge to be formed in the back.  This enables production 
drilling and blasting activities, stoping, and backfill to be performed in a safe manner 
with reduced dilution from the back 

The mining of the Upper and Lower 2B Zone is recommended to be performed from 
the bottom up (from lower to upper) when favourable higher grade is encountered in 
the lower panel.  Middling in between the Upper and Lower 2B Zone is 
recommended to be greater than 15 m for mining from top to bottom.  Wardrop 
suggests mining from the Lower to Upper Zone. 

Preliminary numerical modelling indicated that 4 m skin pillar yields a factor safety 
greater than 1.0 and relaxation of the backs.  Relaxation of the backs is anticipated 
thus cable bolting is required.  Additional numerical modelling in 3D is recommended 
to define the extraction sequence and pillar dimension in detail.  During the 
geotechnical drill investigation, it is recommended to test samples of cores for 
engineering properties to increase the accuracy of the numerical modelling. 

The permafrost conditions at Mactung are reported to be marginal (D. Stewart, 
September 1982) and heat conduction through rock is good (H. Heinicke, September 
1979, revised April 1982).  Thus consolidated backfill induced by freezing is currently 
not considered.  The heat generated by diesel power diamond drilling at the end of 
XC1N had been reported to start thawing the gouge zone (Amax, May-October 
1973).  Amax (1984) recommended that additional studies and test work be 
conducted to determine the extent of permafrost.  Sprayed-on liners or foams are 
recommended to be applied on frozen faults to provide an insulation blanket and as a 
support component.  On site investigations on the types of liners or foam are 
recommended to be performed on site. 

A detailed investigation of the site's permafrost conditions will provide information 
essential to reinforce the mine design parameters.  This will allow confirmation of 
dewatering requirements and provide additional fill strength if conditions are 
favourable to freezing.  

The backfill is currently considered to be passive.  The mill tailings particle size at 
Mactung confirms to the requirements as hydraulic fill material based on available

data.  Wardrop recommends tests to confirm the percolation rate of the mill tailings to 
ensure that the backfill drains at the percolation rate above 10 cm/h. 

Underground testing of frozen, treated mill tailings are recommended once the mine 
is in operation to determine moisture content, the time required to freeze treated mill 
tailings, and frozen fill strength.  The technology of frozen fill research is currently 
being performed, which will assist Mactung in defining the mix design, moisture 
content, and conditions.  Refrigerated intake air may be required during the summer 
months to counterbalance heat generated from the equipment and surface air to 
maintain freezing conditions underground. 

Detailed investigation on the tailings backfill will be conducted to have a better 
understanding of permafrost at Mactung.  To be included in the investigation as 
earlier noted will be the percolation tests for drainage to meet or exceed the 10 cm/h 
rate. 

1 8 . 7  M I N E  V E N T I L A T I O N  

The proposed ventilation system for the Mactung underground mine will require an 
intake air volume capacity of 140 m3/s.  This intake volume requirement is based on 
the projected diesel equipment list for a 2,000 t/d operation.  Table 18.22 provides 
the required air intake for the production mine.   

Fresh air will be introduced to the mine via a 5.2 m wide x 4.6 m high adit, located at 
an elevation of 1895 m at the southeast end of the orebody.  The adit will deliver 
fresh air through the stopes, MCF, and crusher workings.   

Exhaust air will exit the mine by one 3 m x 3 m and one 2 m x 2 m exhaust raise 
installed at the northeast end of the orebody and connected to surface.  
Approximately 30 m3/s of air will be exhausted through the 5 m wide x 5 m high 
conveyor decline.  

The mine ventilation system will operate during production as shown in Figure 18.21.   

18.7.1 PRIMARY VENTILATION 

Primary ventilation will be by one stand-alone mine axial fan installed on the adit 
level.  The fan's adjustable blade pitch will provide the ability to alter air pressure and 
flow as mine development activities require.  As the mine develops and deepens, 
operating pressures and air volumes to ventilate the mine will increase.  Fan 
performance will be adjusted to meet the increased demand by changing fan speed 
and blade pitch.  A second identical fan motor and blade will be available for backup.

DESIGN PARAMETERS 

The ventilation system designed for the Mactung underground mine meets the Yukon 
Mine Safety Regulations for ventilation (section 15.61) and follows general practices 
employed throughout Canadian underground mines.  The following is a summary of 
the ventilation limits. 

Table 18.21 Design Ventilation Standards

The design basis for the ventilation system at Mactung is the air required to dilute 
and remove exhaust gases produced by underground diesel equipment.  Equipment 
utilization factors were used to represent the diesel equipment in use at any time.  

The ventilation system was modelled using Ventsim 3.9.2.f 2008.  The input 
parameters include friction factor (k-factor), length, area, air quantity, and ventilation 
controls.  The k-factors are standard for various types of drifts, raises, and openings.  
Ventilation controls such as bulkheads, regulators, and ventilation doors will be used 
to control air direction in the underground workings. 

18.7.2 VENTILATION OF HEADINGS DURING DEVELOPMENT 

Auxiliary fans will maintain a 22.4 m3/s air flow in the development headings.  This 
airflow rate is required to dilute and remove exhaust from the LHD and haul truck 
fleet.  Using Atkinson's equation for ventilation headings, a 75-hp fan with 0.9 m 
flexible ducting will be required for distances up to 100 m.  For distances 
bewteen100 m and 600 m, twin ducting will be required.   

Figure 18.22 and Figure 18.23 illustrate single duct tunnel location drawing and twin 
ducts application respectively.

the upper north ramp.  This ramp connects to a ventilation raise that exhausts to 
surface.   

In the Lower 2B Zone LH stoping operation, the fresh air will be drawn from the lower 
north ramp and pushed by a 75-hp fan through the ducting located in the mucking 
crosscut to the stope.  Exhaust air will exit through the top crosscut to the lower north 
ramp, then out to surface through the exhaust raise system.   

Development and production in the MCF section of the mine is designed so that the 
fresh air will be pushed using an auxiliary fan and flexible ducting to each of the cut 
and fill headings.  The fresh air will exit through the drift and crosscuts back to the 
ramp and out to surface through the southeast ventilation raise.

18.7.3 FAN SELECTION 

The selection of the main intake fan is based on the maximum operating duty for 
specific conditions.  For the main fan, Wardrop assumed an average fan efficiency of 
75% and 1.36 kg/m3 air density.  

An axial flow fan with variable pitch control will be used for the permanent ventilation 
system.  The simultaneous blade adjustment provides a wide range of fan settings 
within single speed; fan volume flow rate can also be adjusted to accommodate 
conditions.   

DUST CONTROL AND PERMAFROST CONDIT IONS 

Air ventilating the mine will be unheated to preserve the ground conditions provided 
by the marginal permafrost characteristics of the mine and its surrounding rock.  All 
mine equipment will have heated cabins.  Drilling dust will be controlled with air/water 
mist using water from hot water tank on the equipment.  Dust collector systems will 
be installed in all drilling units.  

1 8 . 8  M I N E  P R O D U C T I O N  S C H E D U L E  

The underground mine will operate on two ten-hour shifts per day, 365 days per 
year.  Mine crews will rotate on a fly-in, three-week-on/three-week-off schedule.  
When weather conditions delay the arrival of incoming crews, the on-site crews will 
remain until relief crews arrive. 

The mine will produce ore at the rate of 2,000 t/d from the Upper and Lower 2B ore 
zones.  At this rate and at current market prices, sales contract, volume of reserves, 
and operating costs, the life of the underground mine will extend to 11 years.  

The production schedule was developed using each stope line's tonnages and 
average grades, which were based on the reserve estimate calculation, the 
extraction sequence recommended by Wardrop's Geotechnical Study, and the 
preference to mine higher-grade ore during the initial years to reduce the payback 
period.  There is an opportunity to enhance the annual average ore grade by 
selectively scheduling 60-m long individual stopes after calculating the ore grade for 
each one.  There is also an opportunity to further enhance grade control from 
delineation drilling.  Table 18.23 summarizes the production schedule for 
underground mining in the Upper and Lower 2B zones.

During the pre-production period, all waste material excavated from mine 
development will be stored in two rock dumps located on surface: one close to the 
adit portal (elevation 1895 m), and one close to the conveyor decline portal. 

During the production phase, waste material excavated from ongoing mine 
development will be used to backfill mined out stopes, with priority given to 
mechanized MCF stopes used to circulate equipment in the backfilled areas. 

Wardrop estimates that 95% of the mine-out stopes volume will be backfilled.  Two 
materials types – mine waste and mill tailings – will be used in various ratios as fill.  
Wardrop estimates that 194,000 m3 of fill material will be required each year.  The 
geotechnical analysis has not considered the option of freezing backfill. Remote-
controlled bulldozers will spread, level, and push the backfill material against the 
pillar walls and the back of the LH stopes.  The mill tailings will be transported by two 
conveyor belts down to the underground backfill loading station.  One conveyor will 
be installed beside the crushed ore conveyor in the 5 m x 5 m conveyor decline.  The 
other conveyor will be transversal to the decline dumping on pile on the floor of the 
loading station (Figure 18.3). 

An LHD unit will load the backfill tailings into a returning ore truck and transported a 
distance of approximately of 1 km up to the backfilling stope.  The backfill material 
will be dumped into a dumping bay in the top crosscut of the stope, transported by 
another LHD unit up to the sill of the backfilling area, and pushed inside the stope 
with a remote-controlled bulldozer.  When the backfill volume reaches the sill level, 
the bulldozer will push and level the backfill inside the backfilling stope, finally perch 
the material against the back of the stope.  Due to the dip of the hanging wall 
contact, the backfilling stope can be reached from the drill sill of the next stope, 
pushing material through 4 m x 4 m windows in the rib pillars (Figure 18.4). 

18.9.1 BACKFILL  REQUIREMENTS 

Mactung's backfill material will consist of filtered and unconsolidated mill tailings, and 
underground development waste rock.  The backfill material requirement is 
presented in Table 18.20. 

The tailings will be filtered to approximately 10-15% moisture content and 
transported underground as backfill material.  Although the tailings are filtered, 
containment barriers or bulkheads at draw points are nonetheless recommended to 
provide drainage to the system and to prevent backfill material from entering into 
crosscuts and drifts.

Waste rock extracted during the pre-production phase of mine development will be 
stored in waste rock dumps on surface.  To minimize trucking cycle time, the dumps 
will be located approximately 500 m from the portals.  Wardrop estimates that a total 
volume of 124,000 m3 of waste rock will be extracted and delivered to surface during 
this phase.   

All soil and vegetation in designated rock dump areas will be recovered and a 
drainage system will be installed to collect run-off water into settling sumps and 
discharge into the natural drainage system.  

The rock dumps are designed to dump the lower-level base bench first, and then 
benches on top of it.  To control the long-range stability of the dump, benches will be 
up to 10 m with a 45° maximum effective slope angle.  A portion of all the waste rock 
can be used for road construction, rock fill areas, and backfill material inside the 
mine.   

Wardrop estimates that 92,000 m3 will be stored in the rock dump close to the 
ventilation adit portal, and 32,000 m3 in the rock dump close to the conveyor decline 
portal.  Interference with the crusher and conveyor belt installations in the conveyor 
decline will not permit extraction of waste after the first year of pre-production 
development.

An increase in mining activity has led to a worldwide mine equipment and 
components shortage.  Many equipment items require purchase orders several 
months in advance; therefore, Wardrop recommends that NATC develop and 
operate the mine using the company's own personnel and equipment.  Due to the 
remote location of the project and the higher productivity required in the development 
and operation of the mine, only new mine equipment was considered. 

18.11.2 DIMENSIONS AND CAPACITY 

The 30-t capacity rear dump truck was determined to be the best suited unit for mine 
works dimensions and 2,000 t daily production capacity based on design dimensions 
and configurations of the mine, ramps, drifts, drilling sills, and the access through the 
conveyor decline.  The compatible loading units for these trucks are 10.0 t LHDs.

Truck loading and dumping operations require a loading/dumping station with back 
slashing to approximately 6.5 m high. 

The two-boom drilling jumbos selected increase the productivity and offer good 
coverage of the drifting sections.   

Rock bolting and cable bolting rigs have the capacity and dimensions appropriate for 
the vertical section of the working areas and the length of rock and cable bolts. 

Mucking in LH stopes requires the use of remote control LHD units to operate in non-
man entry areas. 

The long-hole drill unit selected has a drilling capability of up to 36 m down and over 
25 m up, with drilling towers/booms fitting in the 4 m drilling sills. 

A list of major mine equipment operating parameters and productivities are shown in

Productivities, equipment operating hours, labour, and supply requirements were 
estimated for each type of underground operation, namely: drilling, blasting, mucking, 
ground support, haulage, and services.  Total hourly labour requirements were 
estimated to achieve the daily mining production rate based on 2 shifts at 10 h/d with 
4 crews: two on-site and two off.   

The supply costs were based on 2008 Canadian supplier's prices for drill bits and 
steel, explosives, ground support, and services supplies, and were included in

development and stoping costs.  Prices for maintenance and operating supplies were 
obtained from supplier quotations freight on board Cantung Mine as of June 2, 2008. 

A freight component was factored in to convert the estimated costs to the projected 
operating conditions at Mactung. 

The fuel price used in calculations was $1.31/L as delivered to the site.   

The cost of production development per tonne of ore was estimated based on the 
amount of underground development required per one production stope and stope 
tonnage.   

Summary of development cycle time estimation and development costs is shown in 
the Table 18.32.

The stope production cost was estimated based on average stope size as well as 
estimated cycle times for each operation, labour, supplies and equipment 
requirements.  Over the 11-year mine life, 89% of the orebody is extracted by LH 
stoping and the remaining 11% by MCF.  During the first four years of operation, all 
production is done by LH.  In year five, a small volume of production is to be obtained 
by MCF from the southeast mineralized area in the Upper 2B Zone.   

The operating cost for the LH mining method was based on average 17 m wide, 26 
m high, and 60 m long stope size.  Stope crosscut development was considered as 
stope waste development.  Development of the drilling level on the top of the stope, 
which is the initial 5m wide x 4m high ore drift and slash to the full 17m stope width, 
development of the 5m wide x 4m high mucking drift on the bottom of the stope and 
development of slot raise were included in stope ore development cost. 

The LH production cost was based on the estimated cycle time for parallel drilling, 
blasting and ore mucking.  Operating costs did not include ore haulage, as it was 
estimated as a separate cost item and included in total mining operating costs (see 
haulage estimation below).

The operating cost for the MCF method was based on an average 17 m wide, 12 m 
high, and 140 m long stope size.  The stope mining will be done in three 4m high 
cuts.  It was assumed that the first cut, which is the development of initial 5m wide 
and 4m high ore drift and slash to the full stope width of 17m, was considered as 
stope ore development and a crosscut was considered as stope waste development.  
The next two stope cuts were considered as stope production.  Ore haulage was 
included.

The haulage cost was estimated based on average haulage distances as follows: ore 
from production stopes to underground crusher station, waste from access 
development to the mined out stopes as backfill during production period, and backfill 
haulage from backfill stockpile to the mined out stopes.  Then haulage truck cycle 
times and trucking productivities were estimated based on 30 t trucks.  It was 
assumed that some trucks will be loaded with backfill material after dumping the ore 
into the crusher station.  Trucks will deliver backfill material to the mined out stopes 
on the return haul instead of coming empty.  The waste haulage from access 
development to the surface during pre-production period was included in the initial 
capital costs.

Dewatering equipment is included in the equipment list.  In the event permafrost 
conditions are not sustained during the summer, pumps will be installed to dewater 
the underground workings.

18.16.1 ROSTER 

Underground shifts will be 10 hours and underground personnel will work a three-
week on/three-week off schedule.  This exceeds the hours allowed underground by 
regulation and a variance will be sought.  Given the nature and location of the mine, 
and referencing other northern mining operations where similar variances have been 
given, it is expected that this variance will be granted.   

18.16.2 LABOUR SCHEDULE 

Due to the remote location of the project, current labour shortages, and a short 
construction period, all mine pre-production development will be carried out with 
NATC's personnel and equipment, without external contractors.  Table 18.40 and 
Table 18.41 respectively show the underground labour requirements during pre-
production and production phases.

Based on the findings in this report, Wardrop recommends the following: 

• Investigate the potential for an open pit to mine shallow higher grade ore to 
replace lower grade ore in the underground mine, to further enhance project 
economics. 

• Investigate the potential for an ore/waste pass from the open pit to the 
underground crusher. 

• Conduct geotechnical drilling for the potential open pit in order to collect data 
to incorporate it with the underground mine during detailed engineering.   

• Closely monitor the temperature and permafrost conditions inside the mine. 

• Conduct detailed ground control monitoring oriented to minimize the length 
of ground supported with steel mesh in ramps and the number of long cable 
bolts in LH and MCF. 

• Conduct detailed monitoring of freezing progress of backfilled areas.

Three tailings disposition systems — conventional, thickened and dry-stacked —
were considered for use for the Mactung Project.  Of the three deposition systems 
dry-stacked tailings was selected for use. 

1 9 . 1  D R Y - S T A C K E D  T A I L I N G S  F A C I L I T Y  

The mill tailings will be thickened, filtered, and then either transported to the 
underground workings as backfill or to the dry-stacked tailings facility (DSTF).  Both 
conventional and thickened tailings disposal systems were evaluated for the project; 
however, the steep sloping valley sides make the required containment areas very 
large and the required tailings dam very high for both conventional and thickened 
tailings deposition systems.  These requirements made the use of conventional or 
thickened tailings deposition systems appear difficult technically and potentially very 
expensive.   

19.1.1 DSTF INVESTIGATIONS 

In the summer of 2007, EBA excavated seven test pits and drilled four closed-ended 
Becker Hammer boreholes.  The foundation conditions can generally be described 
as gravel and sand colluvium, containing some silt directly overlying bedrock.  The 
foundation soils are fairly permeable (K=4x10-2 cm/s) and compact (N=10 and φ' = 
35°) (EBA, 2007).   

19.1.2 TAIL INGS PLACEMENT 

Milling 2,000 t/d produces approximately 717,600 t/a of tailings.  The estimated 
tailings storage requirements are summarized in Table 19.1.

A conveyor will discharge the tailings to a pile outside the mill, where they will be 
loaded into a truck and hauled approximately 3 km to the DSTF.  The truck will then 
dump the tailings, and a bulldozer will spread them in lifts not thicker than 600 mm.  
After spreading, the tailings will then be compacted with a 15-t vibratory compactor to 
95% of the maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D698.  The assumed 
compacted dry density of the tailings will be 1,800 kg/m3.  The in situ moisture 
content of the compacted tailings will be approximately 20%.   

The foundation of the DSTF will consist of the natural deposit of sand and gravel, 
which will act as a drain to dissipate seepage water from the tailings pile.  The 
seepage rate of the tailings is anticipated to be approximately 74,000 m3/a (2.3 x 
10-3 m3/s).  The DSTF will be constructed as a sidehill fill dump with a 4H:1V slope.  
The tailings pile location and typical cross-section are shown in Figure 19.1 and 
Figure 19.2, respectively. 

19.1.3 DSTF STABIL ITY  DESIGN CRITERIA 

There are currently no guidelines for mine waste pile construction in Yukon, so 
design guidelines from the British Columbia Mine Waste Rock Pile Research 
Committee were used.  The design seismic event is 1:500 (10% chance of being 
exceeded in 50 years) corresponding to a ground acceleration of 0.137 G. 

19.1.4 DSTF STABIL ITY 

For stability analyses, the shear strength (φ') of foundation soil and tailings were 35° 
and 26°, respectively.  The shear strength of the tailings was estimated from the 
particle size distribution, as shown in Figure 18.20 (Section 18.0 Mining), as well as 
EBA's experience with DSTFs at other Canadian mine sites.  The FOS associated 
with several slope stability scenarios are summarized in Table 19.2.

19.1.5 RUNOFF WATER DIVERSION 

Runoff diversions structures will be required in two locations.  A 760-m runoff 
diversion berm will be required uphill of the DSTF to divert water which would 
otherwise flow over the tailings pile.  

The diversion berm will require foundation preparation and 30,000 m3 of engineered 
fill.  On-going maintenance will be required and erosion protection may be required, 
depending on the final gradation of the engineered fill.

A dam is required to store the process water from the tailings thickener overflow for 
at least 30 days before it can be reused in the process plant, as described in 
Section 16.0.  The aging pond reservoir will also act as a runoff storage pond to 
collect runoff from the site infrastructure and DSTF. 

19.2.1 RAVINE DAM INVESTIGATIONS 

In the summer of 2007, EBA excavated six test pits and drilled two open-ended and 
two closed-ended Becker Hammer boreholes.  The foundation conditions can 
generally be described as between 2 to 5 m of gravel and sand containing some silt, 
underlain by shale bedrock.  The foundation soils are fairly permeable (K=4x10-2 
cm/s) and compact (N=10 and φ' 35o).  The shale bedrock is generally of poor quality 
across the bottom of the valley, good quality in the northeast abutment and unknown 
quality (no boreholes into rock in 2007) in the southwest abutment (EBA, 2007).

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

19.2.2 RAVINE DAM DESIGN 

The ravine dam is designed to retain 114,643 m3 of process water (to allow it to age 
for 30 days before it is re-used in the mill), and a maximum of 520,000 m3 of runoff 
water.  The dam is designed as a geomembrane lined structure, to account for the 
lack of natural low permeability core material on or near the site.  The dam also 
incorporates the use of geosynthetic products in place of high quality aggregates, 
which are also not available on or near the site.  The location plan and a typical 
cross-section of the dam are presented in Figure 19.1 and Figure 19.3, respectively. 

The dam is approximately 315 m long and up to 35 m high.  The dam has a crest 
width of 25 m to allow two-way traffic of haul trucks that will be used for construction 
of the dam and diversion channel.  The downstream slope will be 2.5H:1V and the 
upstream slope will be 3H:1V with a 4H:1V toe buttress. 

ENGINEERED FILL 

Engineered Fill will make up the bulk of the dam structure, and will be sourced from a 
borrow pit upstream of the ravine dam, increasing the size of the reservoir.  
Engineered Fill processing should be limited to removal of boulders at time of truck 
loading and avoiding areas of high silt content in the pit.  The Engineered Fill will be 
a well-graded gravel and sand with some silt. 

GEOCOMPOSITE DRAIN 

The Geocomposite Drain is a single piece of Geo-Net (a plastic net used for soil 
reinforcement) bonded between two pieces of non-woven geotextiles.  It will be used 
to prevent porewater pressure build-up in the Engineered Fill in the event of liner 
leakage; it will also be used as downstream bedding for the liner system.  The 
Geocomposite Drain will be a Geo-Comp 5, supplied by Layfield Plastics, or 
approved equivalent.   

LINER BEDDING 

Liner Bedding will be used to protect the liner system from the Engineered Fill, and 
will be sourced from a borrow pit upstream of the ravine dam.  Processing of the 
Liner Bedding will require screening.  The Liner Bedding will be well-graded sand 
with trace silt.

GROUT-F ILLED FABRIC  FORMED ARMOUR 

Grout-Filled Fabric Formed Armour (Fabric Form) will be used to prevent erosion of 
the dam crest when the reservoir is operating.  Fabric Form is an enclosed sewn 
sock of non-woven geotextile.  The sock is sewn together in the factory to 
customized dimensions.  Each sock is then pumped full of grout (20 – 30 MPa) in 
sections creating a series of grout panels.  The grout panels will be 150 mm (6") thick 
after hydration.  Fabric Forms are available from Layfield Plastics. 

OVERBURDEN EXCAVATION 

The overburden excavation quantity reflects the removal of the unconsolidated soils 
beneath the foundation of the dam.  Review of existing geotechnical information 
shows that the material should meet qualifications for use as borrow material for 
Engineered Fill, with the removal of boulders and avoidance of areas of high silt 
content. 

ROCK EXCAVATION 

Rock excavation occurs immediately beneath the concrete plinth to avoid a direct 
short-circuit route at that mechanical connection.  Rock excavation will be limited to 
the highly-weathered and fractured bedrock surface.  Rock excavation will be 
conducted mechanically (by a ripper tooth attached to a bulldozer, an excavator, or 
hand tools).  The use of drilling and blasting is not recommended as it may further 
fracture the underlying rock.  Since the bedrock excavation is limited to highly 
fractured and weathered rock, it cannot be re-used as construction material, except 
for access roads. 

CONCRETE 

The Liner System must be bolted to the sloped face of a concrete plinth to facilitate 
the connection of the competent bedrock surface to the Liner System.  The concrete 
plinth will be a 30 MPa reinforced concrete beam.  Concrete aggregate will be 
sourced from a quarry, which will likely be in the area of the proposed open pit.  
Processing of the concrete aggregate will involve controlled blasting in the quarry, 
crushing with both a jaw and hydraulic cone crushing plant, screening, and washing. 

LINER SYSTEM 

The primary containment barrier will be a 40 mil double-sided textured high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE).  The secondary containment barrier will be a geosynthetic clay 
liner, which will be 4.5 kg/m2 of bentonite needle-punched between two 300 g/m2 
non-woven geotextiles.  These two geosynthetics together comprise the Liner 
System.

19.2.3 RAVINE DAM DESIGN CRITERIA 

The ravine dam has been classified as a "Significant" consequence dam, according 
to the 2007 Canadian Dam Association Dam Safety Guidelines (CDA Guidelines).   

The "Significant" rating was selected for the following reasons: 

• There is only a temporary population at risk downstream. 

• There is no anticipated loss of life. 

• There is no significant loss or deterioration of fish or wildlife habitat. 

• Restoration or compensation in-kind is highly possible. 

• Potential infrastructure and economic losses will be limited to public 
recreational facilities, seasonal workplaces, infrequently used transportation 
routes, and owner's infrastructure and mill production (CDA, 2007). 

The CDA Guidelines stipulate the design seismic and flood events for the various 
dam classifications.  For the "Significant" classification, the design seismic event is 
1:1000 year return period and the inflow design flood can be between 1:100 and 
1:1000 year flood.  For the purpose of the design, the peak ground acceleration 
associated with a 1:1000 year return period of 0.179 G was used and reservoir was 
sized to the 1:100 year flood event (peak storage of 520,000 m3). 

19.2.4 RAVINE DAM STABIL ITY 

For stability analysis the shear strength (φ') of foundation soil and engineered fill 
were both 33° and the shear strength of the liner system (including bedding) was 14°.  
The shear strength of the liner system interface was determined from literature (PGI, 
1997).  The FOS associated with several slope stability scenarios are summarized in 
Table 19.3.

A reservoir water balance for the average (1:2 return period) and maximum (1:100) 
year return period is shown in Figure 19.4.  To keep the dam from overtopping, 
controlled discharge is required.  The discharge rate will vary with the precipitation 
inflow.  The discharge during the winter months will be limited to the difference in the 
process water discharge rate and the process water reclaim rate.   

The maximum discharge rates associated with the 1:100 year and 1:2 year events 
are 0.4 m3/s and 0.2 m3/s, respectively. 

The anticipated groundwater flow under the dam is 4 x 10-3 m3/s.  Four wells will be 
required approximately 100 m downstream of the dam toe to pump the groundwater 
back into the reservoir, should the seepage water not meet discharge criteria.

19.2.6 RUNOFF WATER DIVERSION 

A 2,160 m runoff diversion channel will be required on the north side of the valley to 
divert runoff water around the dam reservoir.  Typical runoff diversion structure 
sections are presented in Figure 19.5. 

The diversion channel will require an excavation of 9,000 m3 and 85,000 m3 of 
engineered fill.  On-going maintenance, including spring snow removal, will be 
required and erosion protection may be required, depending on the final gradation of 
the engineered fill.

20.2.1 ACCESS ROADS 

Approximately 48 km of upgraded/new roads will provide access from the existing 
Upper Canol Road to the mill site.  A road to the pump house at the Hess River 
Tributary C will branch from the main access road.  All access roads will be designed 
for the high snowfall and long winters typical of this area.  

Wardrop evaluated two possible access road routes.  The first option is an 
approximately 25-km route that follows through a narrow valley with steep slopes.  
The second option is an approximately 35-km route through a wider and flatter 
valley.  The second option was selected for its flatter terrain.  The access road layout 
is shown in Figure 20.2.

20.6.4 BUNKHOUSE COMPLEX AND CANTEEN 

The bunkhouse complex and canteen will accommodate 150 personnel.  After 
construction, the bunkhouse and canteen will be refurbished to make it suitable for 
operations personnel.   

20.6.5 FUEL STORAGE 

Fuel for the mining equipment and process and ancillary facilities will be stored in 
fuel storage tanks located adjacent to the south side of the power plant.   

20.6.6 EXPLOSIVE STORAGE 

Explosives storage facilities will be both above ground and below ground.  Two 
powder magazine containers and one cap magazine container will be located above 
ground. 

An underground concrete explosives storage facility will include concrete and gates 
for security and an ANFO kettle mobile. 

20.6.7 ASSAY LABORATORY 

The assay laboratory will be a single story, 15 m long by 8 m wide by 3 m high pre-
engineered building located adjacent to the process mill building.  It will be equipped 
to perform analyses of mine and process samples.   

2 0 . 7  P O W E R  S U P P L Y  A N D  D I S T R I B U T I O N  

Multiple on-site diesel generator units will generate electrical power.  A power plant 
structure, including five diesel generators with heat recovery modules, will be located 
adjacent to the process plant to minimize power distribution losses and connection 
costs. 

The number of generator sets will be N + 1, where N is the number of units required 
to meet the maximum power demand.  N is determined to be four 2.58 MW generator 
units (de-rated 10% for 1,900 m elevation).  One stand-by unit will be used as a 
backup unit.  Each generator is capable of 10% extra power generation to cover 
momentary surges in power demand. 

Each generator unit will recover waste heat from engine coolant, engine-lubricating 
oil, and the exhaust gases.  When in full production and with four generator sets 
operating under load, there will be sufficient recovered heat to heat surface facilities 
in the winter.  The camp will be heated via a combination of electrical heat and 
propane. 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 20-8 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Portable propane heaters will provide heat for surface facilities when waste heat is 
not available from the generator units, typically when the mill is shut down for 
maintenance or repair. 

The generator system will provide electrical power at 4.16 kV.  Power will be 
distributed throughout the mine site at this voltage for large electrical loads, such as 
rod mills.  A number of centrally-located electrical rooms will transform 4.16 kV power 
to 600 V.  These electrical rooms will include motor control, lighting panels, and other 
electrical equipment necessary for facility operation.  Electrical power will be stepped 
up to 13.8 kV for distribution by overhead power line to locations such as the tailings 
and booster pump station. 

Underground electrical power distribution equipment will power the underground 
ventilation, primary crusher, and miscellaneous loads via two underground power 
stations.  Power will be delivered to underground operations via a single 4.16 kV 
underground tunnel power cable.  

2 0 . 8  C O M M U N I C A T I O N  

The telecommunications system will have adequate data, voice, and other 
communications channels available.  The telecommunications system will be 
supplied as a design-build package.  The base system will be installed during the 
construction period then expanded to encompass the operating plant. 

The system will include: 

• a VoIP telephone system 

• satellite communications for voice and data 

• ethernet cabling  

• wireless Internet access 

• 2-way radio communications at site  

• satellite TV. 

A main telecommunications Central Equipment Office will consist of a pre-
manufactured trailer in which the main communications contractor will install and test 
all the main sub-systems for the facilities, prior to shipment.  The trailer will form the 
first block in a system that must support the construction needs of the project first, 
and the operating needs of the project following construction. 

Spare parts for critical and main components will be provided to ensure maximum 
reliability, and minimum down time.  A variety of communications media (copper and 
wireless during the construction phase and fibre optic during the operating phase) 
will be incorporated in the overall design.

20.9.1 OVERVIEW 

The process plant control system will consist of a Distributed Control System (DCS) 
with PC-based Operator Interface Stations (OIS) located in two separate control 
rooms.  The DCS, in conjunction with the OIS will perform all equipment and process 
interlocking, control, alarming, trending, event logging, and report generation.  DCS 
input/output (I/O) cabinets will be located in electrical rooms throughout the plant, 
and interconnected via a plant-wide fibre optic network. 

Field instruments will be microprocessor-based "smart" type devices.  Instruments 
will be grouped by process area, and wired to each respective area local field 
instrument junction boxes.  Signal trunk cables will connect the field instrument 
junction boxes to DCS I/O cabinets.  



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 20-10 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Intelligent-type Motor Control Centres (MCC) will be located in electrical rooms 
throughout the plant.  A serial interface to the DCS will facilitate the MCC's remote 
operation and monitoring. 

The plant control room operators will be in and out of the control rooms; therefore, 
the rooms will be equipped with alarms to alert the operator of potential problems. 

20.9.2 PRIMARY CRUSHING CONTROL SYSTEM 

A single OIS will be installed in the primary crushing underground electrical room to 
monitor all crushing and conveying operations onto the coarse ore stockpile.  Control 
and monitoring functions will include: 

• plugged chute detection at all transfer points 

• zero speed switches, side travel switches, emergency pull cords, and belt rip 
detection of all conveyors 

• weightometers on selected conveyors to monitor feed rates and quantities 

• equipment bearing temperatures and lubrication system status 

• vendor instrumentation packages. 

20.9.3 MILL  BUILD ING 

To control and monitor all mill building processes, two OIS's will be installed in the 
mill building's central control room.  These OIS's will control and monitor: 

• coarse ore reclaim, crushing and grinding conveyors (zero speed switches, 
side travel switches, emergency pull cords and plugged chute detection) 

• secondary and tertiary crushers (speed, bearing temperatures, lubrication 
systems, motors, and feed rates) 

• grinding mills (mill speed, bearing temperatures, lubrication systems, 
clutches, motors, and feed rates) 

• pump box, tank, and bin levels 

• variable speed pumps 

• thickeners (drives, slurry interface levels, underflow density, and flocculant 
addition) 

• flotation cells (level controls, reagent addition, and airflow rates) 

• samplers (for flotation optimization) 

• concentrate pressure filter and load out

The Mactung property is located in the Selwyn Mountain Range and covers the area 
around Mt. Allan along the Yukon/NWT border.  It is a remote site with seasonal 
access by gravel road, and is a six hour drive from the community of Ross River.   

The Selwyn Range, characterized by sharp peaks, steep sideslopes, and narrow 
rounded valleys, forms the landscape of the project area that varies from gentle to 
flat terrain on the valley floor to steep relief on upper bedrock slopes.  Mountain 
elevations range from 745 masl to 2970 masl. 

Most of the proposed Mactung Project area is located in un-forested high alpine 
terrain, where forest stands occur only at elevations below 1400 masl.  Upper 
bedrock and colluvium slopes are mostly bare and lower valley slopes and valley 
floors are typically vegetated with grasses, mosses, lichens and alpine willow and 
birch. 

The area is used by nesting migratory birds in the summer.  Mammal species which 
frequent the area include caribou, grizzly and black bear, wolf, lynx, wolverine, fox, 
marten, hare, and other small mammals.  

2 1 . 2  L I C E N S I N G  A N D  P E R M I T T I N G  

Project development activities proposed to occur in the Yukon are subject to the 
Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act (YESAA).  This 
assessment regime has been formed from the Umbrella Final Agreement and is 
tailored to fit the governing structures of Yukon.  Yukon-settled First Nation 
Governments govern their respective settlement lands and hold traditional treaty 
rights for areas designated traditional territories.  Of the fourteen First Nations 
Governments in Yukon, eleven have settled land claims and developed Final 
Agreements with the Government of Yukon and Government of Canada. 

The Mactung project is proposed to occur in an overlap area of the traditional 
territories of three Yukon First Nations, including: the Ross River Dena Council 
(RRDC), the Liard First Nation (LFN) (both non-settled First Nations), and the First 
Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun (NND) (a settled First Nation).  The project site, as 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-2 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

currently designed, does not cross settlement land or land set aside by the non-
settled First Nations. 

Beyond meeting the requirements of the assessment process, proponents of 
development projects are required to meet the regulatory obligations of both the 
Government of Yukon and Canada. 

21.2.1 YUKON ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMEN T ACT 

YESAA is the legal basis for the assessment of projects in Yukon.  It provides a 
single assessment process for projects proposed on all Yukon lands, including 
federal, territorial, and First Nation lands.   

The assessment process is governed by federal legislation and regulations as well 
as rules created by the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Board (YESAB).  
YESAB is an arms-length independent board which makes recommendations to 
decision bodies, comprised of federal departments, Government of Yukon, and First 
Nations Governments.   

21.2.2 REQUIRED YUKON PRODUCTION PERMITS 

This section contains an overview of the permitting required in Yukon for the 
production phase of a tungsten mine, as well as any perceived risks as identified 
through the consideration of the Yukon permitting regime.  

In 2003, the responsibility for land, water, mineral, and other natural resources were 
transferred from the federal to the Government of Yukon.  The majority of the permits 
required for a producing mine have since been issued by the Yukon government, or 
by arms-length boards.  The main permits required for a producing tungsten mine 
include a Type A Water Licence and a Quartz Mining License.  Depending on the 
land tenure, land use permits or land leases may also be required.  In addition, a 
number of other ancillary permits will be required by Yukon government and federal 
agencies.  A complete list cannot be provided at this time, as permitting requirements 
will be determined upon completion of project design and planning.   

QUARTZ MIN ING LICENSE 

Within Yukon Territory, the Government of Yukon, Department of Energy, Mines, and 
Resources form the major regulator for mine exploration and production which 
occurs on Crown land.  Regulatory requirements stem from the Quartz Mining Act 
(Yukon).   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-3 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The process has been designed to meet the realistic nature of mining projects which 
have received a positive determination of the assessment process.  As a result, the 
department will issue the Quartz Mining Licensing in two phases: 

1. The first phase will include authorization to proceed with construction 
activities which do not require licencing through the Waters Act (Yukon).   

2. The second phase will form the final component of the major licence 
requirements for the proponent and will provide authority to finalize 
construction activities and proceed with the proposed mining program.  

TYPE A WATER LICENCE 

In Yukon, water licencing is conducted by the Yukon Water Board under the authority 
of the Waters Act (Yukon).  The responsibility of the Water Board is specific to the 
provision of Water Licences, which may only be issued once a project has been 
assessed under YESAA.  Terms and conditions issued by the Water Board may not 
contravene a decision document issued under the authority of YESAA.  Licences 
issued by the Water Board provide the Government of Yukon with an enforcement 
mechanism, based on the technical parameters pertaining to quantity of water used 
and quality of effluent released.  

The Mactung project will require the issuance of a Type A Water Licence for its 
production activities.  As such, Section 19 of the Waters Act establishes the 
requirement for a public hearing in the review of the Water Licence application prior 
to permitting.  

ANCILLARY PERMITT ING REQUIREMENTS 

Other permits which may be required by the Yukon government include: 

• Type B Water Licence 

• Land Use Permit/Lease 

• Work in the Right-of-Way of a Highway 

• Formation of a Memorandum of Understanding (for the expansion of an 
aerodrome) 

• Environmental Health Permits 

• Building, Development, and Electrical Permits 

• Storage Tank System Permit 

• Special Waste Generator Permit 

• Air Emissions Permit 

• Solid Waste Commercial Dump Permit

• Permit to Install a Sewage Disposal System 

• Blasting Permit 

• Explosive Magazine Permit. 

Permits which may be required from the Government of Canada include: 

• Explosives Factory Licence

• Blasting Explosives Purchase and Possession Permit 

• Non-Mechanical Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil (AN/FO) Certificate 

• Permit to Transport Explosives 

• Authorization for Works or Undertakings Affecting Fish Habitats

This list is not meant to provide a comprehensive list of potential permits, but rather 
to identify authorizations which may be required as a result of the proposed project. 

2 1 . 3  E N V I R O N M E N T A L  S E T T I N G  

A number of studies have been completed since 1968 to study and document 
baseline environmental conditions in the area.  A current comprehensive baseline 
environmental assessment was initiated in 2006 (EBA, 2007). 

21.3.1 SURFIC IAL  GEOLOGY/SOILS 

The general site geology of the Mactung Project area has been extensively 
described and documented in previous reports.  Detailed terrain mapping was 
completed in the project area in 2007, as it was known at this time. 

Soils in the project area originate from glacial, colluvial, and minor fluvial processes.  
The higher areas of the mountains have little or no surficial soils while the lower 
slopes and valley bottoms are covered with thin deposits of residual soils, colluvium 
and glacial tills.  Till (moraine) is the most common surficial material mapped in the 
project area and occurs on middle to lower valley hillslopes 

Due to the generally weak and fissile nature of the parent rocks in the area, which 
are generally highly schistose metamorphic rocks, most granular deposits are of poor 
quality.  No granular deposits suitable for road surfacing or concrete aggregates 
have been identified and initial indications are that these materials may have to be 
obtained by crushing local competent bedrock.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-5 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Steep terrain and climate factors such as rain and snowmelt contribute to potentially 
high surface soil erosion hazard on the lower and middle slopes from May to 
September, particularly during spring freshet.   

Information required for the completion of the surficial geology/soils portion of the 
YESAA application and regulatory documentation was available for the project area, 
however, it was decided that more information would be required on the surficial 
geology and soil for the mine access road from the North Canol Road to the mine 
site.  This information was collected and analyzed during the summer 2008 field 
program and will be included in the YESAA Project Proposal.  

21.3.2 ACID ROCK DRAINAGE POTENTIAL 

Several historical papers and studies completed for this site between 1976 and 1982 
have been reviewed with regards to geochemical studies.  The reviewed reports 
contained all available relevant geochemical data and it appeared that no prior acid-
base accounting (ABA) analysis was conducted at the mine site. 

There has been considerable geological characterization of the rock units at the 
Mactung site.  Four of the nine mappable units at the site are mineralized.  The 
primary ore mineral is scheelite and occurs in varying quantities within the 
mineralized units.  Sulphide mineralization occurs as pyrhotite, pyrite, and 
chalcopyrite within the ore zone to varying degrees.  There has also been 
considerable surface mapping, diamond drill coring, and petrographic analysis 
including thin section and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies.  Sample descriptions and 
petrographic analysis show that mineralogical content within a single lithologic unit 
can be highly variable. 

Geochemical investigations were completed in 1978 and 1979 by the Colorado 
School of Mines (CSM) bulk sample collected in 1973 (CSMRI, 1976).  These reports 
documented an 8-week and 44-week testing program, in which a tailings sample was 
rinsed with aerated water.  The leaching program was designed to include several 
variants such as temperature, inoculation with bacteria and circulation vs. free flow. 

The CSM study was related to tailings produced from the pilot scheelite flotation 
plant of AMAX Inc. (the site owner at that time).  The sample used for the test work 
consisted of Mactung pilot plant tailings material of known composition (8.07% 
calcium, 13.80% carbonate, 5.83% total sulphur, 5.81% sulphide sulphur, and 0.02% 
sulphate sulphur). 

Rock samples were submitted by NATC for ABA and shake flask analyses to provide 
information on acid rock drainage potential and metals leaching.  A total of 27 
samples were submitted for the underground workings and surface borrow sites to 
provide geochemical characterization information on the different rock types.  

This information should satisfy YESAA information requirements for characterization 
with respect to acid rock drainage; however, the age of the core may be of concern.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-6 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The only core from the site that is less than two years in age is from geotechnical 
investigations conducted in 2007.  It was recommended that core collected from the 
proposed 2008 exploration program be submitted for ABA analyses to confirm the 
results of the older core.  Sample collection was not conducted as part of the 2008 
exploration program for ongoing static and kinetic testwork.  

Based on Wardrop and EBA data analysis, NATC has assumed that the tailings for 
the project are similar in composition to the tailings produced at the nearby Cantung 
Mine located in the NWT.  A comparative study of Mactung and Cantung undertaken 
by NATC and Wardrop has confirmed this assumption.   

Samples of tailings are planned to be collected during subsequent metallurgical test 
programs and on a continual basis during mine operation to confirm potential impacts 
to the environment.  To ensure that impact to the environment is minimal during and 
after mine operation, potentially acid-generating (PAG) and metal-leaching tailings 
will be stored using the most conservative method allowable.  If subsequent testing 
shows that the tailings are more benign, then less conservative storage methods 
may be employed. 

The results of ABA analyses indicate that all ore grade samples are PAG.  Low grade 
ore was overall net neutralizing but some PAG samples were identified.  Unit 1 waste 
rock sample analyses identified 67% of the samples as PAG.  Unit 3 waste rock 
sample analyses identified 83% of the samples as PAG.   

The underground nature of the development means that there will be no above 
ground ore stockpiles and wastes identified as having acid rock drainage or metal 
leaching potential may be able to be backfilled underground as part of the mining 
process.   

Based on the PAG classification of the ore samples, it is anticipated that the tailings 
produced at Mactung will be PAG.  Due to the lack of a metallurgical program, it has 
been assumed that the tailings will reflect the ore and are therefore considered PAG.  
If tailings are assumed to be PAG, there may be a need to encapsulate the tailings at 
closure to minimize risk.  

21.3.3 TERRAIN  HAZARDS 

Active geomorphological processes in the study area include rockfall, debris slides, 
debris flows, avalanches, gully erosion, and periglacial processes (e.g. rock glaciers). 

Rapidly-drained bedrock slopes of the upper valley walls and cirques are typically 
steep (greater than 70%) and moderately steep (50 to 70%).  Rockfall is the primary 
erosional process on these slopes and the moderately steep to steep slopes are 
likely subject to avalanching.  

A possible relic (inactive) debris slide about 10 ha in area was identified on a north 
valley hillslope about 6 km west of the Yukon/NWT border.  Small, periodic debris

flows are probably an ongoing process within valley sideslope stream channels and 
contribute to colluvial fan deposits mapped in the study area. 

Snow accumulations in the project area are heavy and the moderately steep to steep 
slopes have potential for avalanching.  Avalanches are an annual occurrence in this 
region and probably play a part in some downslope transport of colluvial material in 
the study area.  

Gullies on the valley sideslopes are mostly active, with most erosion probably taking 
place during spring run-off.  A number of rock glaciers are mapped in the study area, 
mostly on north-facing slopes but are not located within areas impacted by proposed 
development and there is a low probability that the project will be impacted by large 
rock glaciers. 

The project area is located in an area of moderate seismic hazard, rated 3 on a scale 
of 5 (GSC, Natural Resources of Canada, 2005).  The maximum ground 
accelerations associated with 1:475 and 1:1000 year return earthquakes are 0.137 G 
and 0.179 G, respectively. 

Information required for the completion of the terrain hazards section of the YESAA 
application was considered to be available at the time of feasibility analysis.  The 
terrain hazards mapping being completed for the mine access road from the North 
Canol Road to the mine site will be incorporated into the YESAA application.  

21.3.4 HYDROLOGY 

During the summer of 2006, hydrometric stations were installed on two Yukon creeks 
draining the Mactung Project site, and Tributary A.  The locations of these stations 
are shown in Figure 21.1.  The ongoing study involves the continuous open water 
season measurement of creek stages and temperatures as well as numerous 
discrete discharge measurements and subsequent determination of a time history of 
discharge from the stage. 

Tributary C originates in Yukon close to the Yukon/NWT border within the Mactung 
property, and has a catchment of 24.2 km2.  Tributary C flows into Tributary A, which 
flows northwest into the south tributary of the Hess River, and eventually into the 
Stewart River in Yukon.  Time histories of creek discharge were determined over the 
periods from July 9, 2006 to September 20, 2006 and July 10, 2007 to September 5, 
2007.

Due to the lack of a suitable site for the installation of a hydrometric station on 
Tributary C, it was necessary to estimate creek flows for this basin based on the 
larger Tributary A discharges collected just downstream of the confluence of 
Tributary C with Tributary A.  Discharges were measured manually for both creeks at

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

similar times throughout the course of the study to determine a discharge relationship 
for the two creeks.  The ratio of discrete discharge measurements between 
Tributary A and Tributary C is 0.308.  The ratio of the catchment area is 0.302, 
providing confirmation of this method.  The similarity of these two ratios validates the 
estimation of Tributary C discharges from Tributary A flows.  This methodology 
enabled discharges from two separate basins, Tributary A basin and Tributary C 
basin, to be determined. 

The average discharge for Tributary A over the two year period of record was 
3.4 m3/s.  Both years of record had very similar average discharges.  Short period 
increases in flow on the order of 10 m3/s may occur during the summer, in response 
to large precipitation events.  The maximum recorded summer flow on Tributary A 
was 10.5 m3/s, recorded on July 25, 2007.  Water temperatures recorded at the 
hydrometric station indicate that the average water temperature for the open water 
period of record was 5.6°C.  Over the two years of data collected for Tributary A, 
creek temperatures varied over the range from 1 to 10°C. 

The average flow on Tributary C over the period of record was 0.92 m3/s.  Both years 
on record had very similar average discharges.  Short period increases in flow on the 
order of 1.5 m3/s can occur during the summer, as a response to large precipitation 
events.  The maximum recorded summer flow on Tributary C was 3.1 m3/s which 
occurred on July 25, 2007. 

Monitoring during May 2008 measured flow in both systems and identified a thermal 
spring in the Tributary C drainage, which suggests year round flows in this stream.  A 
winter hydrology program was conducted during February and March of 2009 and 
the flows were observed in both tributaries at this time. 

Total basin runoff over the period of record was calculated for the two creeks 
draining the Mactung property.  Runoff during the 2006 and 2007 study period, as 
well as the mean discharge for Tributary C is summarized in Table 21.1.  

Table 21.1 Total Basin Runoff for Tributary C in 2006 and 2007

The construction of the Mactung mine will decrease the flows in Tributary A only 
during the period of filling of the Ravine Dam.  At other times during the production 
phase of the project the flows in this tributary will be generally unaffected with the 
exception of the winter months.   

The addition of a reservoir in the upper drainage basin is comparable to a lake 
headed drainage system.  It is expected that there will not be significant changes in 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-10 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

water temperature that could be observed as a result of the Ravine Dam; however, 
these temperature effects should be minimal based on the elevation and size of the 
reservoir. 

The proposed Mactung mine is designed to operate on a year-round basis.  The 
process water balance indicates a water surplus of 8 m3/h reporting to the polishing 
pond.  This will mean winter discharges to the Ravine Dam with overflow from this 
structure into Tributary C.  No information is available to estimate the relative impact 
to surface water flows as a result of these discharges. 

Low-flow analysis of the southern tributary of the Hess River, just downstream of the 
confluence of Tributary A was conducted using data recorded by Water Survey of 
Canada.  Hydrometric data for the Tsichu and Hess rivers has shown that water 
withdrawal requirements for mining operations may exceed creek discharge, posing 
potential effects to downstream aquatic resources and wildlife.  The percent 
occurrence of this low flow is projected to be less than 1%.  Mitigation of potential 
effects from water withdrawal in this tributary will be managed through the setting of 
maximum allowable water withdrawals as a percentage of total streamflows.  Limited 
data exists on the drainage of the proposed pumphouse; however, low flow 
monitoring from winter 2008 measured flows that were within the modelled range for 
this tributary.  

A detailed hydrological program has been designed to conduct year-round 
monitoring on the southern tributary of the Hess River.  The monitoring program will 
target the winter low flow period to determine the accuracy of the low flow modelling 
for the system.  The detailed assessment of aquatic resources in the stream sections 
where water withdrawals are proposed to allow for evaluation of potential habitat 
effects resulting from proposed water withdrawal.  The winter hydrology program of 
2008/2009 will also provide information to determine the relative contribution of 
groundwater to streamflows, which is identified as an information requirement under 
YESAA. 

Hydrological analysis of the Mactung site is complicated by the absence of active 
Water Survey of Canada hydrometric stations within 60 km of the site.  The three 
stations closest to the property were operated from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s; 
therefore, there is no direct comparison of the short-term onsite hydrometric data 
reported to the longer term record which would enable more accurate determination 
of hydrological parameters such as low- and high-flow frequency analysis and period 
of return for various flows. 

The initial assumption of no winter flows for Tributary A and Tributary C was re-
evaluated to reflect physical measurements.  Determination of flood frequencies 
becomes difficult without long-term hydrology stations for comparative purposes.  
Modelling of drainage basin run-off response is being conducted to allow for the flood 
frequency determinations required to meet YESAA information requirements.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Indications from existing information show that water quality from the tributaries 
draining the property is of poorer quality than that of the southern tributary of the 
Hess River.  Winter monitoring of flows and water quality in both drainage systems 
was recommended and undertaken to evaluate and quantify potential effects from 
water withdrawals during the low flow period. 

Hydrological data to determine sizing of drainage structures for the proposed 40 km 
access road has been recommended for collection upon determination of stream 
crossing locations.  This data may be of interest to assessment and regulatory 
agencies.  

21.3.5 SURFACE WATER QUALITY 

In June, July, August, and September of 2006 and 2007, EBA conducted water 
quality sampling at watercourses within the Mactung site including the Hess River 
and Tributaries A and C of the Hess River in Yukon, as well as Dale Creek, the 
Tsichu River, and Cirque Creek in NWT.  During these sampling events, surface 
water samples were collected eight times from sampling stations WQ1, WQ2, WQ3, 
and WQ4 and twice from sampling station WQ9.  

All of the stations were located on the Yukon side of study area; WQ1 at Tributary C 
of the Hess River, WQ2 at Tributary A of the Hess River, WQ3 on the Hess River 
upstream of its confluence with Tributary A, and WQ4 on the Hess River downstream 
of its confluence with Tributary A.  WQ1 through WQ4 are on the western side of 
MacMillan Pass on watercourses which drain northwest into the Stewart River in 
Yukon.  Station WQ9 was located on the South MacMillan River which flows into the 
Pelly River (Figure 21.2).  

The results from these events combined with previous water quality studies 
completed for the Mactung site (CSMRI, 1976) and AMAX Northwest Mining 
Company Limited (1983) were interpreted for this water quality summary.  

The project area contains large mineral deposits below and at ground surface.  There 
are underground springs seeping in at various locations.  These conditions influence 
the area's water quality; however, most parameter concentrations were found to be 
below laboratory detection limits.  Exceptions included aluminum, cadmium, copper, 
extractable iron, iron, nickel, selenium, and zinc which were consistently found to be 
above the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines for 
the Protection of Aquatic Life.  

In general, higher trace metal concentrations were seen at stations WQ1, WQ2, 
WQ4, and WQ9 while Station WQ3 on the Hess River upstream of the confluence of 
Tributary A (and Tributary C) had lower metal concentrations.  The elevated metal 
concentrations appear to be natural occurrences with no anthropogenic influences 
suspected. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-12 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Tailings from the project will be deposited below the mine mill site.  Thus, potential 
effects on downstream water quality, if any, would be greatest at Station WQ1 on 
Tributary C, due to its proximity to the project area and the direction of water flow 
from the proposed tailings location.  If water quality in Tributary C were to be 
measurably affected, then Tributary A at Station WQ2 and the Lower Hess River 
Station WQ4 might also potentially be affected.  Therefore, the collection of baseline 
data has begun for Tributary A prior to its confluence with Tributary C.  The 
monitoring of the current water sampling stations will continue.  Sampling of 
Tributary A upstream of the confluence with Tributary C was conducted during May 
2008 and the results indicate that Tributary A has poor water quality. 

Metals leaching from the tailings storage facility at the mine are deemed to have the 
highest potential for effects on receiving water chemistry in the project area.  CSMRI 
(1976) evaluated effluent quality for a tailings sample from the site and this study 
showed that effluent chemistry is not anticipated to have negative effects on the 
surface water receiving environment; however, water quality guidelines have 
changed since this study was conducted.  Relative changes to surface water 
parameters as a result of discharges from the Mactung site can be calculated once 
more detailed hydrology and water chemistry data for the winter months is available.   

There is a potential for changes to surface water flow and water chemistry in the 
southern tributary of the Hess River downstream of the confluence with Tributary A 
as a result of water withdrawals.  Winter flow and water quality monitoring are 
required to be able to evaluate the potential changes and determine whether 
mitigation measures may be required. 

Water quality data for the Mactung project currently only extends over the 
approximate 4 month open water period for each of the two years of record.  These 
summer months include periods of large dilution from snowmelt and precipitation 
events.  At the time of preparation of the Feasibility Study, data was being collected 
to better understand low flow periods, as this information will be required for a project 
proposal submission to YESAA.  Continued water quality from 2008/2009 monitoring 
program will be used for the development and implementation of mitigation strategies 
where these are required.

21.3.6 HYDROGEOLOGY 

A Detailed Hydrogeological Assessment (DHA) was conducted by EBA for NATC to 
assess the groundwater conditions at the Mactung property.  The purpose of the 
DHA was to provide enough background information for the description of the 
existing (baseline) hydrogeological conditions and to present a hydrogeological 
effects assessment for the YESAA process.  

The project area is bordered by surface water divides to the north, east, and south.  
The regional groundwater flow divide is assumed by EBA to coincide with surface 
water divides (i.e. groundwater from the project area discharges to the valley of 
Tributary C south of Mt. Allan). 

The groundwater flow direction generally mimics the slope of surface topography.  
Deep groundwater flows from the highest areas of Mt. Allan southwards, turning 
southwesterly or westerly in the valley of Tributary C.  Shallow groundwater flow 
within the overburden is characterized by local, small-scale flow cells, with its flow 
direction closely following local topography.  Groundwater recharge typically occurs 
at higher elevations with groundwater ultimately discharging to surface water bodies 
at lower elevations in valleys.  The presence of permafrost in the upland areas tends 
to reduce and/or inhibit infiltration to groundwater.  At lower elevations where 
permafrost is discontinuous or absent, groundwater recharge to the deep aquifer 
occurs where a hydraulic connection exists between the shallow overburden and 
underlying bedrock aquifers. 

The horizontal hydraulic gradient in the bedrock aquifer ranges from about 0.02 (i.e. 
2 m vertical per 100 m horizontal) in the upland areas of Mt. Allan to about 0.5 in 
locations south of the proposed mill site.  The hydraulic gradient in the valley south of 
Mt. Allan appears to be fairly constant at 0.1 to 0.15.  Based on the hydraulic 
conductivities obtained from hydraulic tests, the hydraulic gradients inferred from 
groundwater level measurements, and assuming a bedrock porosity of about 0.05 to 
0.15, the mean flow velocity of the deep groundwater is estimated to range from 
about a few metres to several tens of metres per year. 

Natural background concentrations for aluminum, cadmium, iron, selenium, and zinc 
slightly exceeded the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment guideline values 
for the protection of aquatic life.  However, all concentrations were below the Yukon 
Contaminated Sites Regulation aquatic life standards. 

UNDERGROUND WORKINGS 

Measurements of static piezometric levels in observation wells installed during the 
detailed hydrogeologic assessment indicate that a portion of the underground 
workings will occur below the existing static piezometric water level.  Hydraulic 
testing results suggest that the rock mass where underground workings are planned 
to be advanced has a low to moderate hydraulic conductivity.  It is expected 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-15 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

therefore that there will be some drainage into the mine from the surrounding rock 
mass, and a resulting requirement for dewatering during later mining.  Further, 
because a portion of the mine will be wet, the interaction of sulphide minerals in the 
open drifts and adits of the mine may create the potential for acidic mine drainage 
and metals leaching. 

Groundwater seepage is anticipated to occur in the underground workings below an 
elevation of about 1775 masl.  Mining at these depths will occur only on the west end 
of the deposit and will take place only from Year 5 to Year 11 of mine operation.  A 
consequence is that water flowing into the mine may create waters with elevated 
metals concentrations that must be handled during mining operations.   

Because the reservoir will largely be infilled with oxygenated, near neutral pH surface 
water diverted from the catchment areas upslope, dissolved metals will precipitate 
as/or adsorb onto mineral surfaces (e.g., iron oxyhydroxides), and further metal 
transport through surface water movement from the reservoir will be mitigated.  With 
this change in redox conditions and pH, precipitation of some metals would likely 
occur within the timeframe that the water is retained within the reservoir.  As part of 
the mine closure, once the dam is decommissioned, sediments that had settled out 
from the base of the reservoir and containing high metals concentrations will be 
relocated and disposed of on the DSTF. 

During mine dewatering, the base flow to some creeks with headwaters on Mt. Allan 
will also be diverted towards the underground workings.  Comparison of these 
volumes to the estimated flow into the mine suggests that the mine drainage water 
will amount to less than 1% of the volume in the reservoir (annually), and less than 
2% in low flow (winter months).  

Mined-out stopes and drifts will be backfilled with tailings.  After dewatering has 
ceased, the piezometric level will start to recover to its natural condition.  As a result, 
the lowest part of the underground workings below an elevation of about 1775 masl 
will flood and groundwater will move through the abandoned underground workings 
following the natural hydraulic gradient to the south towards Tributary C.  Stope and 
drift walls as well as backfill materials will have been exposed to atmospheric oxygen 
during the operation phase and sulphide minerals may have started to oxidize.  This 
provides the potential for the generation of acid rock drainage at least during the 
initial phase of flooding when oxygen will be available.   

However, after flooding, oxygen availability will be very limited due to the fact that all 
underground workings will be sealed off with bulkheads preventing any air circulation 
from atmosphere.  Furthermore, the groundwater flow through the mine will contain 
no significant amounts of oxygen and chemical conditions will be reducing.  
Therefore, potential acid generation and associated metals leaching will widely be 
restricted to the initial phase of flooding of the underground workings.  If acid 
generation and metals leaching does occur, there may be effects to groundwater that 
will flow southwards and ultimately discharge into Tributary C upstream of the ravine 
dam.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-16 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The overall significance has been identified as being low because acid generation 
and metals leaching will be very limited due to the low oxygen content in water within 
the flooded underground workings; and, the potentially affected groundwater 
represents only a small percentage (<1% to 3%) of the total discharge of Tributary C 
at the point of surface water discharge.  

DRY STACKED TAIL INGS FACIL ITY 

Water drainage through the active layer of the tailings during the warmer months 
may affect shallow groundwater quality during tailings placement.  The primary 
interface between leachate (process water, and/or precipitation that has infiltrated the 
dry-stacked tailings) and groundwater at the DSTF occurs primarily at the south 
slope of the DSTF where water leaching from the active layer of the tailings has the 
potential to mix with groundwater.  The southern part of the DSTF area is a 
groundwater discharge area with an upward groundwater gradient expected.  The 
upward gradient is expected to limit percolation of leachate from the tailings to the 
shallow groundwater flow system.  The potentially acidic and metals-rich water 
generated within the tailings will flow preferentially to the south end of the DSTF 
through the active layer at the upper surface of the stack.  Any seepage or leachate 
discharging from the DSTF will flow on surface, or in shallow groundwater towards 
Tributary C, and during operation, will ultimately discharge to the reservoir.  This 
seepage is expected to have chemistry similar to the process water.  

An impermeable geomembrane will be placed over the DSTF at the end of operation.  
This will greatly reduce or eliminate the risk of infiltrating water transporting acidic 
drainage or metals leachate post closure (after Year 11).  The water quality in 
Tributary C will not be affected significantly and the effect is unlikely to represent any 
threat for fish habitat further downstream in Tributary C where dilution will be much 
greater.  As well, the effects on groundwater are reversible due to the natural flushing 
of groundwater that will occur through the area of the DSFT after closure.  The 
overall significance of the effect of water seepage from the DSTF on the water quality 
of Tributary C after mine closure is low. 

WASTE ROCK STORAGE 

Groundwater recharge through the PAG waste rock stored at surface near the mine 
portal will only occur seasonally.  Since these materials will only be stored on surface 
for less than five years, acidic recharge is not expected.  If acidification of the waste 
rock occurs more rapidly than expected, accelerated placement as mine backfill is 
the most prudent mitigative option to limit the exposure of the PAG source to oxygen 
and moisture.  With this mitigative strategy, the potential effect on shallow 
groundwater quality will be minimal.

RESERVOIR  DAM UNDERFLOW 

The reservoir will collect groundwater discharge, mine drainage water, mill process 
water, and water directed to the reservoir from selected surface water catchments.  
The location of the proposed reservoir is currently a groundwater discharge area, 
and will remain a groundwater discharge area during the time that the reservoir 
exists.  The reservoir dam will be constructed upon fractured bedrock which will allow 
some groundwater seepage under the dam.  This underflow will mix with the 
underlying groundwater and potentially change the quality of the shallow 
groundwater.   

The rate of dam "underflow" has been predicted by EBA using a scoping 2D flow 
model to be in the order of 500 to 750 m3/d.  It is assumed that groundwater 
underflow will be very similar in chemistry to the surface water quality contained 
within the reservoir.  In the event that the reservoir water quality does not meet 
discharge criteria, mitigation to prevent the uncontrolled discharge of seepage water 
has been formulated and is included in the YESAA project proposal. 

21.3.7 CLIMATE 

Data from two existing meteorological stations in the Mactung project area were 
used: 

• A meteorological station was installed during the summer of 2005, 
approximately 50 m south of the existing Mactung camp site (Figure 21.1).  
Weather data recorded by this meteorological station have been analyzed 
for a period of record of over two years from July 15, 2005 to August 31, 
2007. 

• The MacMillan Pass meteorological station, which is operated by 
Meteorological Services of Canada from 2003-2005. 

The summer period at the Mactung site runs from June to late August and the 
remainder of the year may be classified as winter, with transitions occurring between 
April and May and between late August and September. 

Mean summer air temperatures are typically between 5°C and 10°C, with daily 
maximums around 15°C and minimums around 5°C.  The maximum air temperature 
recorded by the station over the study period was 20°C  

Winter temperatures have more day-to-day variance, but typically range between -
10°C to -20°C.  The minimum air temperature recorded at the site over the period of 
record was -36.6°C.  During the winter months, air temperatures rarely rise above 
freezing.  

Winds at the site come predominantly from the west/southwest and the northeast, 
with average wind speeds less than 6 m/s occurring approximately 90% of the year.  
Wind speeds greater than 6 m/s tend to occur more often during the winter months.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-18 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Average daily maximum wind gusts are typically 7 m/s; however, the maximum wind 
gust recorded by the station for the period of record was 23 m/s.  Relative humidity is 
typically near 90% throughout the year, but frequently drops as low as 30% for 
periods of up to a day. 

The site receives the highest amount of incident solar radiation between April and 
August.  During this period, maximum incident solar radiation is in the order of 
900 W/m2.  In the months of December and January, daily maximums are 
approximately 50 W/m2.  There are about 20 hours of daylight on June 21 (summer 
solstice), while daylight is restricted to approximately 4 hours on December 21 
(winter solstice). 

Precipitation data recorded at the MacMillan Pass meteorological station, provided 
by the Meteorological Service of Canada, have been used to estimate yearly 
precipitation at the Mactung property.  The MacMillan Pass station is located on the 
lee-side of the mountains (481 m lower in elevation), approximately 1.6 km southeast 
of the Mactung property.  An analysis of the data showed that 663 mm of water-
equivalent precipitation per year fell on the area over the period 2003 to 2005.  
Months with greater than 50 mm of precipitation commonly occur throughout the 
year, with January seeing the least, typically under 30 mm.  Based on temperature 
data recorded at the Mactung property, this precipitation could be expected to fall as 
snow from October to April.  Precipitation occurring in September and May has the 
potential to fall as snow, freezing rain, rain or as mixed precipitation. 

A complete record of monthly and daily precipitation at MacMillan Pass exists 
between August 2002 and June 2006.  The precipitation record outside of this period 
is sparser.  In addition, due to its location on the lee-slope of the divide, recorded 
precipitation totals may not be completely indicative of conditions at the Mactung site.  
As a result, it is difficult to accurately assess the study area basin runoff or potential 
for flood.  An onsite precipitation gauge is planned to be installed for the collection of 
relevant precipitation data.  

The MacMillan Pass meteorological station collects data on snow depth; however, no 
data with respect to snow depth has been collected for the site.  Field observations at 
the site during March 2008 indicated that the influence of wind on snowpack 
distribution makes snowpack highly variable.  Heavy drifting was noted in the area of 
the camp while other areas near to the proposed Mill building showed little to no 
snow cover. 

The majority of the potential project related risks described in this section can be 
addressed during the detailed engineering of the project infrastructure. 

Wind speeds up to 23 m/s have been recorded on site; therefore, there is a potential 
for minor wind damage to structures.  There is also a possibility of the transport of 
contaminated sediment fines from the mine or tailings storage facility during dry 
periods to areas outside of the property.  Aeolian transport from the tailings facility 
can be mitigated through the use of sprinklers to maintain surface moisture.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-19 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Precipitation could pose a potential risk with respect to increased potential for 
erosion and sediment transport in ditches and diversion channels at the site, 
including the ditchlines along the proposed access road to the site.  This impact can 
be mitigated through proper ditch and diversion design relating to anticipated flow 
volumes and rip-rap requirements.  Revegetation, where moisture conditions allow, 
can also be conducted to mitigate impacts from erosion and provide sediment 
control. 

Cold winter temperatures pose a risk with respect to freezing water lines used for 
plant feed and discharge lines, potable water and septic systems.  Ground 
temperatures readings from the site will be used to assist in service designs.  The 
use of adequately insulated or heat-traced water lines will need to be installed as 
appropriate to mitigate this concern.  Health and safety issues related to cold 
temperatures for mine operation personnel will be mitigated through development of 
operational procedures for the production phase.  

Currently there is no on-site information for precipitation or snowpack distribution for 
the Mactung site.  The highly variable distribution of snow at the site makes 
determination of site values for this parameter difficult.  The application of an 
orographic modifier to the available data from the MacMillan Pass Atmospheric 
Environment Service (AES) station can be conducted to reasonably estimate site 
values for both precipitation and snowpack.  

Climate change effects were considered for the submission of the YESAA project 
proposal, as per the information requirements.  

21.3.8 AIR QUALITY 

The proposed Mactung mining area is located in a remote area of Yukon that has no 
other sources which would affect the air quality.  As a result, it is assumed that the air 
quality in the area would be in the same range as background levels for the 
Canadian north. 

There is currently no air quality monitoring equipment in the area of the mine site or 
any other adjacent areas.  The only ongoing air quality monitoring in Yukon is 
conducted in Whitehorse.  The Whitehorse station is part of the National Air Quality 
Surveillance (NAPS) Network.  The air pollutants monitored in Whitehorse include 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, ground level ozone, and fine 
particulate matter (PM25).  The monitored ambient air pollutants in Whitehorse are 
compared with the National Air Quality Objectives (NAQOs), and summary reports 
for 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2004 were reviewed for this station.  Overall, the reports 
conclude that the ambient air pollutant levels monitored at the Whitehorse NAPS 
station are good and rarely exceed the levels specified in the NAQOs. 

A direct comparison cannot be made between Whitehorse ambient air pollutant 
levels and those at the Mactung mine site.  Some air emissions will be created from 
fuel-fired generator sets and traffic at the mine site.  However, due to the location of 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-20 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

the mine site, it is assumed that the ambient air quality at the site will have lower 
concentrations of air emissions than in Whitehorse. 

Based on the remoteness of the mine site location, it is not believed that air quality 
will pose a risk to the feasibility of the proposed Mactung project.  

21.3.9 NOISE 

The proposed mine site is situated in a remote area where the background noise 
consists of the natural setting.  Some noise is present during some intermittent 
mining exploration and mine planning activities.  Noise levels at the mine site have 
not been monitored but are commensurate with regular exploration activities.  
Ambient noise is expected to be mainly of a temporary nature during the construction 
and operation phase and will only impact the immediate vicinity of the above-
mentioned activities.  The daily and long-term averages for ambient noise in the area 
are anticipated to be low.  

Based on the remoteness of the mine site location, it is not believed that noise will 
form a risk to the feasibility of the proposed Mactung project.  

21.3.10 ARCHAEOLOGY 

In 2006, Points West Heritage Consulting Ltd. (Points West) conducted a preliminary 
archaeological assessment of the Mactung site.  The primary objective was to 
determine if there was sufficient archaeological potential to require more detailed 
investigation once finalized development plans are available.  

The results of this study identified the areas that may have sufficient archaeological 
potential to justify further archaeological investigation.  Areas that would not require 
further work were also identified.  The report predicted that any archaeological sites 
located in this project area would be small.  Further, it is most likely that they would 
be characterized by sparse to moderate quantities of artifacts.  However, because 
little is known of the archaeology of the region, any information that can be collected 
would be of value. 

Points West continued its work in August 2007, with the primary objective to follow-
up on the recommendations of a 2006 preliminary assessment.  The proposed mine 
facilities will be located in a high west facing alpine valley on the Yukon side of the 
border; and as a result of this study, is considered to have very low archaeological 
potential.   

No new archaeological sites were encountered during the 2007 study.  Little to no 
archaeological potential was found in the majority of the area proposed for mine 
facilities in the upper alpine valley area within Yukon.  No archaeological sites were 
discovered and there are no previously recorded sites in this area.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-21 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The new access road approach within Yukon from the vicinity of the MacMillan Pass 
airstrip, and this airstrip, were not included in the 2007 study.  These two areas were 
instead subject to an additional archaeological assessment in July 2008.  The results 
of this study were not available at the time of finalizing this report. 

Subject to the results of the 2008 study, no conflicts between the Mactung 
development and archaeological sites have been found, and there appears to be no 
archaeological issues that will impact the feasibility of this project.  

21.3.11 HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH 

There are no full-time residents in the area, and there is limited use of the area for 
recreational purposes.  Traditional activities are expected to occur in the area; 
however, the timing and extent to which these will occur is unknown. 

The predominant activities known to have occurred for the past two years have been 
centered on exploration activities and scientific research as a result of the exploration 
activities and plans.  Once construction activities begin there will be a camp located 
at the site which will be used to provide temporary accommodations for workers 
involved with project development.  Camp facilities are expected to be provided from 
construction through to operation and eventually for closure and reclamation.  

Yukon does provide a regulatory regime which will monitor site conditions and 
inspect monitoring reports from the site.  As well, Yukon government's Environmental 
Health Services will be responsible for the issuance of permits and monitoring of 
human and environmental health.  

Human and environmental health is important matters which will need to be 
considered throughout all stages of the project and will be regulated by Yukon 
government.  The project's impact on human or environmental health conditions 
appear to be minimal.  

21.3.12 VEGETATION 

The types of vegetation present and vegetation cover are highly variable in the 
Mactung Vegetation Local Study Area (VLSA) due to elevation, aspect, 
microtopography, and soil conditions.  Valley bottoms tend to be vegetated by willow 
and scrub-birch thickets, wetlands, and sedge-forb meadows.  Black and white 
spruce communities are rare in the Hess Tributary.  Subalpine fir dominates the 
wooded taiga from 1200 to 1550 masl at higher elevations the canopy becomes 
sparse and is typically replaced by Krummholz and dwarf shrub communities in the 
alpine.  At elevations above 1800 masl, vascular plants become rare and bare rock 
and epilithic lichen communities dominate.  

Two studies of special interest provided a detailed description of the vegetation of the 
area.  The Amax (1983) and Kershaw and Kershaw (1983) reports reviewed all 
physical, biological, and cultural aspects of their identified study area (500 km2).  The 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-22 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

vegetation portion of these reports summarized both the existing vegetation and 
plant communities and potential environmental impacts associated with the 
construction of the proposed mine at that time; and further identified 17 plant 
communities within their study area.  The reports also stated that upon review of rare 
species lists from Yukon, four species were to be considered rare with a potential to 
occur in the area.  None of the four plant species were identified or recorded in areas 
planned for proposed construction at that time.   

More recently, new biophysical assessments were conducted by EBA in 2006 and 
2007 entitled "Vegetation Environmental Baseline Studies" and "Vegetation and 
Ecosystem Land Classification" respectively (EBA 2007a; 2007b). 

Fifteen distinct ecosystem units/map units and 12 complex polygon associations 
were mapped based on the sampling performed by EBA in 2006 and 2007 (Figure 
21.3).   

A total of 145 plant species were observed within the Mactung VLSA.  One hundred 
twenty-three different plants were recorded in 2006, with an additional 22 observed in 
2007.  Twenty-nine of these recorded plants were identified only to genus and are 
assumed to be different than those identified to species.  A list of plant species 
expected from historical studies is presented in the Vegetation Baseline Study 
produced by EBA.  

A rare plant survey was completed over a two year period as part of on-going 
environmental baseline studies.  A three day rare plant survey was conducted from 
August 13 to August 15, 2007 in the proposed disturbance footprint for the Mactung 
Project, with two days of effort in Yukon and one day of effort in the NWT.  A rare 
plant reconnaissance (functionally different from a rare plant survey) was conducted 
and 14 vegetation plots were sampled within the area of the proposed footprint 
during the 2006 season.  Data collected in July 2006 were used to supplement the 
2007 rare plant survey.  

In 2007, no rare species were observed in areas proposed for development.  A 
baseline assessment of trace element concentrations in plant tissue was performed 
within the LSA.  A total of 14 vegetation samples were collected with two samples 
collected at each of seven sample locations.  Data were collected to establish 
baseline values for trace element concentrations in plants in and around the project 
area.  The results indicated no exceedance of any existing Canadian standards and 
values are only elevated with regards to within treatment values.

Figure 21.3 Ecosystem Units 

 

In review of the existing vegetation baseline requirements of the YESAA proposal 
guidelines, as well as the existing data there appears to be low risks to the project for 
development proposed to occur in the mine footprint.  Site clearing and construction 
will impact small amounts of alpine plant communities in specified areas, however, 
given their common occurrence throughout the Mactung region, these plant 
communities are expected to return following reclamation.  

Additionally, no forested areas occur within the proposed development area; 
therefore, no risks related to the loss of merchantable timber exist.  The information 
collected in their 2006 and 2007 baseline studies will support future regulatory

submissions leading to project approvals and have not identified any outstanding 
risks or impacts that may affect the feasibility of the mine footprint development. 

The project will include the development of a 48 km all season access road through 
lower elevation valleys to the southwest of the project area.  The road may traverse 
heavily vegetated habitat in the boreal high and subalpine ecozones, approximately 
two thirds of which would lie outside of the area covered by the 2006 and 2007 
baseline studies.  A 2008 field program has recently been completed which 
catalogued and assessed vegetation resources along this route and an inventory 
report was used for the YESAA application.   

21.3.13 WILDLIFE 

EBA conducted an extensive baseline study program at the Mactung project area 
with the objective of documenting and characterizing wildlife within the study area.  
Both ground and aerial surveys were carried out in October 2005 and continued 
during the summers of 2006 and 2007 (June, July, August, and September survey 
events) (Figure 21.4 and Figure 21.5).  These surveys may also form the basis for 
future monitoring programs associated with project implementation and operation.  
Baseline surveys were carried out in a 720 km2 wildlife study area that was centered 
on the existing Mactung camp.

Overall, wildlife use of the primary footprint area was found to be consistent with 
other areas in the region.  Consequently, disturbances to wildlife are expected to 
range from low to moderate in scale, and highly localized in spatial scope.  Potential 
disturbances may include limited effects on an active wildlife corridor between valleys 
in Yukon and the NWT that connect across the pass situated in the project footprint 
In addition, potential habitat losses for other species local to the development area 
may arise.  Such potential effects may be of concern to regulators and other 
stakeholders.  However, with the application of appropriate mitigation measures any 
potential effects are expected to be manageable.  

Woodland Caribou are likely to be the species of greatest interest during the YESAA 
assessment process, as many herds of caribou across the North, have been slowly 
declining due largely to the effects of encroaching human development.  Although 
the Redstone herd is currently believed to be stable, assessors and managers will be 
interested in predicting effects of future developments.  Mitigation measures have 
been included within the YESAA application.  Monitoring programs to minimize 
potential effects may be required as part of the permitting process.  

Moose are often considered to be a 'bread and butter' species in Yukon, and wildlife 
managers tend to be concerned about the indirect effects of development on this 
species.  Mitigation measures have been included within the YESAA application.  

Both Dall's sheep and grizzly bears are also species that are considered of high 
value.  While the study area does provide good habitat for grizzly bears, this species 
is secure in the region, and should not pose a project risk.  The relative abundance of 
sheep in the project area remains poorly understood, mostly due to the limited winter 
abundance data available for this species. 

While several other species were identified as occurring within the study area, no 
other keystone species or species at risk were identified.  EBA believes that there is 
sufficient baseline data from recent studies to properly assess the risks to these 
species, as well as to develop effective mitigation strategies. 

To address the limited winter abundance data, additional baseline work was 
conducted during March 2008, as well as further work in the summer of 2008, to gain 
a better understanding of abundance and distribution of this key species.  This work 
will provide a better understanding of consequences related to the project. 

Similar to all other disciplines, the risks associated with access to the Mactung site 
during all phases of development and operation is anticipated to be addressed in 
regulatory applications.  Access considerations for the Mactung project were not 
originally included in the baseline studies, as they had not been identified at the time 
these studies took place.  As a result further baseline studies have been undertaken 
in 2008 to provide for the information requirements held under YESAA.  Based on 
these studies, general wildlife usage and concerns were found to be similar to those 
in the area of the mine site.  Also considered within the submission were effects

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

associated with increased hunting pressure, direct and indirect habitat avoidance in 
adjacent areas, and wildlife mortality, as well as potential mitigations.  

21.3.14 FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES 

FISHERIES RESOURCES 

Fisheries baseline studies were collected during 2006 and 2007 in the Mactung study 
area.  These studies focused on assessing the fisheries and aquatic resources in 
both the primary tributaries leading from the project area, as well as those higher 
order watercourses further downstream.  Generally, these studies were conducted 
within the project LSA with the intent of characterizing the presence and 
characteristics of local fish populations, documenting habitat quality, identifying 
barriers to upstream fish passage, and identifying the fish bearing status of 
watercourses in direct influence of the project. 

Prior to the current baseline studies by EBA, no previous information had been 
collected for the local tributaries on the Yukon side of the Mactung property.  The 
current baseline study program was conducted by EBA and it focused efforts 
primarily within the greater project footprint and downstream impact areas on the 
Yukon side of the border, namely Tributary C (the primary tributary leading from the 
footprint area), Tributary A (a lower elevation tributary into which Tributary C flows), 
and the Hess River Tributary (into which Tributary A empties).  

The baseline studies determined the major tributaries downstream of the project area 
to be fish bearing.  Tributary C, the primary tributary flowing out of the footprint area, 
was found to support a resident population of dolly varden1 at lower elevations and 
gradients.  In these areas, Tributary C was found to provide good fish habitat 
conditions and is believed to support populations throughout the year.  Favourable 
habitat conditions deteriorate closer to the Mactung Project area at higher elevations, 
and a sampling effort approximately 700 m downstream of the proposed project 
footprint determined poor conditions and an absence of fish in this area.  It was also 
determined that areas upstream of this point were non fish bearing due to the 
numerous barriers to fish passage and the prevailing steep gradients. 

Further downstream from the project area, Tributary A was found to not support fish 
at the time of baseline surveys, presumably due to poor water quality.  This tributary, 
however, is likely to offer seasonal migration or other habitat potential due to the 
moderating effects of runoff water in the system.  Finally, the Hess River tributary 
was found to provide excellent characteristics for year round fish survival, and 
supports slimy sculpin, arctic grayling, and dolly varden.  Figure 21.6 presents the 
fisheries values and sampling locations. 

                                                  
1 The dolly varden (Salvelinus malma) is a member of the charr family that is a common resident of fluvial systems in the 
Yukon. This fish occupies watercourses from large to small, and does revert to an alternate "dwarf" life history form that 
occupies high elevation streams.

Overall, risks to fisheries resources resulting from the mine development are 
expected to be moderately low and manageable through the implementation of 
appropriate and effective mitigation measures for the release of deleterious 
substances and maintenance of site hydrology.  Generally, no direct effects (loss of 
habitat) are expected to result from the development or operation of the Mactung 
mine, as the footprint is at a high elevation and above steep gradient areas that 
naturally exclude fish.  As it has been determined that resident fish populations exist 
directly downstream of the project area, the maintenance of downstream habitat and 
water quality will be a requirement, through appropriate mitigative measures, to 
ensure that fish habitat quality and fish populations are maintained. 

It is anticipated that streams directly affected by project developments (within the 
development footprint) will be properly re-aligned to maintain downstream 
hydrological characteristics. 

The development, upgrading, or maintenance of roads can result in potentially 
negative effects on fish and fish habitat, in particular at watercourse crossings.  As 
expected, the development of suitable new mine access road is an important aspect 
of the mine feasibility.  Thus, the proposed development of the new road will need to 
consider lower elevation tributaries in the area outlined for development.   

Baseline information regarding the extent, quality, and characteristics of fisheries 
resources along potential access road route has been recently collected and 
preliminary results suggest that some tributaries along the route are fish-bearing.  
Consequently where the installation of a crossing structure may result in the loss of 
fish habitat, an Authorization pursuant to the Federal Fisheries Act will be required.  
For the permitting and authorization stage, a field habitat inventory and habitat 
compensation plan prepared by a professional biologist may be required.   

AQUATIC HABITAT 

During the aquatics baseline studies at the Mactung site in 2006 and 2007, a survey 
of benthic invertebrate resources was conducted in conjunction with fisheries 
sampling.  Overall, the diversity and abundance of benthic resources was found to be 
closely tied to water quality characteristics (and consequently fish 
presence/abundance).  Sampling in both years focussed on Yukon streams, and 
provided a suitable baseline of information for use in both regulatory submissions 
and future biomonitoring programs.  

Based on a review of YESAB's "Proponent's Guide to Information Requirements for 
Executive Committee Project Proposal Submissions", that all listed information 
requirements can be met with the current baseline information.  Some temporary or 
permanent direct loss of benthic resources can be expected during development and 
operation through the realignment of several primary tributaries within the lower 
footprint area or through potential water quality impacts.  These streams have not

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

been included in EBA's baseline studies to date as NATC was still working to define 
the project specific components.  However, while these tributaries are expected to 
support some local primary production and to supply downstream areas with drift 
invertebrates used by fish, their relative contribution to the system in whole is 
predicted to be minor.

This section of the report for the proposed Mactung Project considers the socio-
economic conditions for the development.  As the project will be located solely in 
Yukon, the socio-economic effects of the project were considered under YESAA.  
The "Guide to Socio-economic Effects Assessments" produced by YESAB identifies 
the following six steps to a socio-economic effects assessment: 

1. Determine project scope. 

2. Determine assessment scope. 

3. Compile baseline data. 

4. Characterize potential effects. 

5. Evaluate mitigation and enhancement strategies. 

6. Determine the significance of potential effects. 

Each of the above steps relates to late identification of "Valued Socio-Economic 
Components" (VSECs).  The 2006 Census provided much of the baseline data 
required.  

21.4.1 SOCIAL  AND ECONOMIC CONDIT IONS 

In the Yukon, three First Nations (RRDC, LFN, and NND) and the communities of 
Ross River, Faro, Watson Lake, and Mayo are most likely to be economically and 
socially affected by the Mactung mine.  The sections below summarize some of the 
key economic and social conditions of these communities and First Nations. 

LAND CLAIMS IN  THE YUKON 

In 1992, the Council for Yukon Indians (today the Council of Yukon First Nations) and 
the federal and territorial governments signed the Umbrella Final Agreement to serve 
as the template for individual land claims agreements.  The land claims agreements 
are accompanied by self-government agreements that allow First Nation 
governments to pass legislation in a number of areas.  The Mactung site is located 
within the Traditional Territories of the LFN, the RRDC, and the NND.  The NND in 
Mayo was among the first four land claims signatories.  However, significantly for this 
project, the RRDC and the LFN have not signed the agreements and remain Indian 
Act bands.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

YUKON 

The Yukon is large in area (483,450 km2) but has a small population (32,714 
inhabitants as of December 2007).  The territory's economy is heavily reliant on 
government and, to a lesser extent, on natural resources and tourism; a pattern that 
is typical of relatively remote jurisdictions across the circumpolar north.  Although 
Yukon has a variety of economic and industrial sectors, government is by far the 
largest and is largely financed through federal transfers.  

Until the 1990s, mining was the mainstay of the Yukon's private sector industry.  The 
dependence on mining gave rise to boom-and-bust cycles typical of economies 
dependent on natural resources.  Until this century, the size of the non-aboriginal 
population and of the economy fluctuated with the fortunes of the mining industry.  
The current importance of government, and of mining in the past, has resulted in 
Yukon having high average incomes, typically among the highest in Canada. 

The Yukon's mining industry entered into a prolonged slump following the last 
closure of the Faro lead-zinc mine in January of 1998.  By 2002 there were no 
operating hard-rock mines in Yukon, mineral exploration spending had declined 
steeply, and even placer gold production had fallen to a 23-year low.  Beginning in 
2004 expenditures on mineral exploration and development began to rise sharply, a 
rise that has continued through 2007.   

Whitehorse is the Yukon's capital, has close to three-quarters of the territorial 
population, is the service centre for the territory, and dominates the territorial 
economy.  Rural communities, where the First Nation population is concentrated, are 
generally not benefiting from the high incomes and economic prosperity of the 
capital.   

The communities most affected by the mine are likely to be Ross River, Faro, and 
Watson Lake.  The First Nation of NND, centered in the Village of Mayo, will also be 
affected due to the location of the mine in their traditional territory.  Ross River, Faro, 
and Mayo all have populations of approximately 400, while Watson Lake is larger 
with about 1,500 inhabitants.  

LABOUR FORCE 

According to the 2006 Census, about one quarter of the Yukon's population is of 
Aboriginal origin.  That proportion is much greater in rural communities with the sole 
exception of Faro, which was originally built to service a mine.  

For the proposed Mactung mine, NATC considered the potential benefits provided 
through employment as well as the potential effects associated with labour force 
depletion for inclusion within the YESAA application.  Further, the assessment 
application outlined potential mitigation measures to minimize negative effects and 
potential means of enhancing positive effects.

ROSS RIVER 

Ross River is the community closest to the Mactung mine.  Located on the south 
bank of the Pelly River near the confluence of the Ross and Pelly Rivers where the 
North Canol Road crosses the Pelly, Ross River is a mainly Kaska First Nations 
community (86%) with a population just under 400 (349 in December 2007).  The 
South Canol Road runs through the community with a seasonal ferry providing 
access to the North Canol Road during the summer.  The community is 
approximately 10 km from the Campbell Highway.  

Mining exploration increased in the region around Ross River through the 1950s and 
an exploration and mining boom occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with the discovery 
and development of the Faro mine.  Although Ross River Dena people did work in 
mining exploration the mining boom did little to benefit the First Nation.  The more 
recent increase in mineral exploration and development activity in the region have 
benefited Ross River residents as employment levels have increased to the point 
that in 2007 mining companies have had some difficulty recruiting local residents for 
work.  It is likely that the Mactung mine could get at least a portion of its labour force 
from Ross River, especially if it is willing to provide the necessary training and work 
environment to attract and keep a local work force. 

Despite the exploration boom in the region, unemployment rates were still high in 
Ross River in 2006 with an unemployment rate of 21% compared to 9% for Yukon as 
a whole. 

The RRDC is the First Nation Government in Ross River.  The Ross River Dena has 
developed a mining strategy to guide their relationship with mining companies.  

FARO 

Faro, located above the north bank of the Pelly River approximately 70 km from Ross 
River, is Yukon's newest community.  It was built in 1969 to house the Faro mine 
workers and their families.  The community's relatively short history has been marked 
by wild swings in population as the mine has opened and closed.  

Cyprus Anvil made the decision to go into production in 1967 and construction of the 
town began in the fall of 1968.  The 1970s were boom times for Faro.  The mine was 
profitable, wages were high, there were the benefits of heavily subsidized housing, 
and the town grew.  In 1981, it was the highest income community in Canada and 
reached a peak population of over 2,000 people. 

In the early 1980s metal prices dropped, and Cyprus Anvil began losing money and 
building up debt.  A temporary shutdown was announced in June of 1982 and the 
shutdown continued as metal prices remained very low.  In May 1985, the company 
announced it was mothballing the mine.

In November 1985, Curragh Resources Inc. took over the mine and in the spring of 
1986 the Faro mine and mill were back in operation; however, by 1992, the company 
was mired in difficulties and in April of 1993 the Faro mine was shut down for the 
second time.  Again, the town's population dropped precipitously, 

Anvil Range Mining Corporation (Anvil Range) bought the property in 1994 and 
production began again in August of 1995.  In November of 1996, Anvil Range 
suddenly announced a temporary closure of the mine by the end of the year.  The 
mill would continue to operate until March 1997 using stockpiles of ore.  Lower metal 
prices and a higher Canadian dollar were given as the reasons for the shutdown.  
Anvil Range declared bankruptcy in April 1998.  Since 2000, the town's population 
has remained stable at just under 400 residents.   

The 2006 census showed that Faro had a labour force of about 75 people, of whom 
17% were employed in natural resource industries (i.e. mining as there is very little 
agriculture and forestry in Yukon).  The occupational distribution provided by the 
Census showed that 50 worked as tradespeople, transport and equipment operators, 
or in occupations unique to primary industry.  It is therefore likely that the Mactung 
mine could get a portion of its labour force from Faro and that a number of other 
workers might be interested in moving there to spend less time commuting between 
their shifts. 

WATSON LAKE 

Watson Lake is situated in the south-eastern corner of Yukon at the junction of the 
Alaska Highway and the Campbell Highway.  The Stewart Cassiar Highway whose 
northern end is just north of Watson Lake provides a link to tidewater in Stewart, 
British Columbia.  The community is considered to include not only the Town of 
Watson Lake, but also the adjoining Kaska First Nation Settlements of Upper Liard 
along the Alaska Highway, and Two and One-Half Mile Village and Two Mile Village 
on the Campbell Highway.  The settlement of Lower Post just across the border in 
British Columbia is also often considered part of Watson Lake.  

The economy of the Watson Lake area has depended on being a transportation hub 
and a supply centre for mines in the area, notably Cassiar for asbestos, the Sa Dena 
Hes for lead zinc, and Cantung for tungsten.  There has also been logging and 
sawmilling in the area as the southeast is home to Yukon's largest trees associated 
with its relatively wet climate.  Yukon's one producing natural gas field, Kotaneelee, 
is located in the territory's south-eastern tip. 

As with the Cantung mine, Watson Lake is likely to provide a number of services to 
the new Mactung mine as well as a portion of its work force.  

MAYO 

Mayo is quite far from the Mactung mine, about 716 km by road, but both the 
Mactung mine and the community are in the Stewart River watershed, hence the 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-35 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

interest in the mine by First Nation of NND.  The First Nation may be concerned 
about potential downstream environmental effects and may wish to discuss positive 
economic spin-offs from the mine for its citizens.  

Mayo is another Yukon community that began as a mining centre.  Mayo served as 
the transhipment point for the silver ore from Keno and Elsa until the United Keno Hill 
mine closure in 1989.  There continues to be active placer mining for gold in the 
Mayo area as well as exploration activity, and for uranium in the Wind River area 
further to the north.  

Communi ty  Considerat ions 

The affected communities have had considerable experience with the mining industry 
in the past; as a result, some residents have worked or are currently working in the 
mining industry.  Given this experience and knowledge of the industry, the affected 
communities will have a fairly sophisticated approach to new mining development.  
They can be expected to be generally supportive of new mining development and will 
wish to maximize the potential economic benefits to their communities; however, it is 
also expected that these communities will be highly aware of and concerned about 
long-term environmental effects.  

One major socio-economic consideration that may have a material impact on the 
feasibility of the Mactung mine is the relationship that the company develops and 
maintains with affected First Nations.  In practical terms, this relationship may be 
shaped by the negotiation and signing of agreements, for instance "Impact-Benefits 
Agreements" (IBA) or "Socio-economic Participation Agreements" (SEPAs).  These 
agreements typically speak to a variety of issues including: jobs for community 
members, training, business opportunities, relations with the community, etc.  

Many of these provisions can also be advantageous to the company, as a local 
labour force is likely to be more stable and ultimately less expensive.  While it is not a 
legal or regulatory requirement, a SEPA/IBA may provide a framework for a positive 
relationship during the assessment and regulatory process as well as to provide a 
forum for ongoing communication while the mine is in operation. 

21.4.2 NON-TRADITIONAL LAND USE 

The area proposed for the Mactung mine site is located in a remote region of Yukon.  
Current use of the site has been limited due to this remoteness and limited access.  
At present, the site can be accessed through summer use of the North Canol Road, 
or through air access.  Due to the access limitations for the site, non-traditional land 
use has been limited to mineral exploration, and recreational use such as trapping, 
hunting and hiking.   

Based on the limited existing non-traditional land use as well as the relatively short 
temporal scope associated with the proposed project, conflicts between non-
traditional land use and this project are expected to be minimal.

21.4.3 TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE 

In preparation of the YESAA application, NATC has been seeking to obtain 
Traditional Knowledge from Yukon First Nations who have territories in which the 
Mactung Project is located.  Consultation and Traditional Knowledge gathering are 
separate but parallel processes, and are both required under YESAA.  

Guidelines provided by YESAB entitled the "Proponent's Guide to Information 
Requirements for Executive Committee Project Proposals" (Proponent's Guide) 
provides distinct guidance which requires proponents to seek Traditional Knowledge 
in addition to scientific knowledge.  The guidelines specifically state "The proponent 
is encouraged to develop a sound understanding of First Nations issues and 
expectations with respect to the incorporation of Traditional Knowledge" (YESAB, 
2005).  This Proponent's Guide describes the methods for the identification of valued 
components.  The guidelines produced by YESAB state, "Focus on the components 
identified as being most important according to the issues and concerns raised by 
government, stakeholders, First Nations, and the public, and include a consideration 
of: perceived intrinsic value, economic importance, traditional use, recreational value, 
rarity, legal, scientific value, and sensitivity" (YESAB, 2005). 

The Proponent's Guide also identifies that the project proposal should contain 
information describing the past and present land use by First Nations for traditional, 
commercial, and recreational purposes.  Information regarding social systems and 
economics is expected to be presented, where available, in both the description of 
existing conditions as well as the effects assessment.  The importance of recording 
best efforts to obtain Traditional Knowledge is identified in the consultation 
requirements of the Proponent's Guide. 

The Mactung project is proposed to occur within the traditional territories of LFN, 
RRDC, and NND.  Information collected during project planning, identification of 
methodologies, and through consultation activities was incorporated into the 
environmental and the socio-economic existing conditions section, as well as the 
environmental and socio-economic effects assessment section of the YESAA project 
proposal.  

At the time of the Feasibility Study, RRDC had developed a proposal to gather 
Traditional Knowledge for the company's consideration and NND had provided their 
Government's protocol for the gathering of Traditional Knowledge.  NATC has also 
sent letters to NND and LFN, specifically requesting that Traditional Knowledge be 
collected where available.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

2 1 . 5  C O N S U L T A T I O N  

Consultation requirements for the proponent are stated under YESAA, specifically 
Section 50 (3) states:  

"Before submitting a proposal to the executive committee, the proponent 
of a project shall consult any first nation in whose territory, or the 
residents of any community in which, the project will be located or might 
have significant environmental or socio-economic effects." 

Based on this requirement, NATC will be required to consult with the RRDC, LFN, 
and the First Nation of NND as well as the communities of Ross River and Faro.  

NATC has been actively engaged in consultation activities which included meetings 
in Ross River and Faro as well as with NND.  The company has also engaged with 
LFN Chief and Council, although, to date no formal meetings have taken place with 
LFN membership.  NATC is working through the consultation process to fulfill its 
requirements under Section 3 of YESAA.  The information utilized and gathered from 
this process was part of the YESAA application for review by the Board.  

The consultation process ensures that community members are provided with an 
opportunity to understand the project and participate in the project component 
planning, effects identification, and the potential formation of mitigations.  Through 
carrying out consultation activities prior to submission of the project proposal, the 
proposal included the values presented and, as a result, provide for a more efficient 
and effective assessment. 

2 1 . 6  W A S T E  A N D  W A T E R  M A N A G E M E N T  P L A N  

Waste will be generated during all phases of the proposed project.  NATC is 
committed to managing its waste streams to minimize potential impacts to the 
environment and local wildlife.  Within this section, a number of items have been 
outlined to demonstrate the range and types of mitigation measures which can be 
applied.  

Domestic waste generated at the site will be incinerated to minimize the potential for 
attracting wildlife to the project area.  Bear-proof garbage containers will be used at 
the site to minimize potential attraction of bears; ash from incineration will be 
disposed of in an approved disposal location.   

Sewage generated from the operations will be treated and disposed of on-site.  A 
suitably sized modular state-of-the-art sewage treatment system such as a rotating 
biological contactor (RBC) will be utilized.  The sewage treatment and disposal 
system will require permitting and the design requirements of the system will reflect 
appropriate regulatory requirements. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-38 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Industrial wastes will be handled, stored, and disposed of using accepted and 
appropriate methods to be determined by project planning and regulatory 
requirements.  Waste petroleum products such as oil will be collected and, if suitable, 
will be recycled or used to generate heat.   

Production and volumes of hazardous materials from mine processing has yet to be 
determined, but any such wastes will be safely stored and disposed of in accordance 
with appropriate regulatory requirements. 

During the de-commissioning and abandonment phase of the project there will be 
substantial wastes generated.  Any materials and equipment that are potentially 
salvageable will be sold or removed from site.  Remaining waste materials will be 
handled and disposed of in accordance with accepted practices and regulatory 
conditions. 

21.6.1 TAIL INGS MANAGEMENT 

Tailings produced at the proposed Mactung mine will be permanently stored using 
the dry stack process.  Dry stack technology will produce a sandy tailings product 
that will have a moisture content of less than 20%.  Approximately 50% of the tailings 
produced at the Mactung site are required for use as backfill in the underground 
workings.  The surface tailings material will be trucked from the mill site to the tailings 
storage facility (TSF) for disposal.  Water draining from the TSF will report to the 
Ravine Dam polishing pond where it will become part of the pumpback system used 
to supply the mill with process water. 

The use of dry stack technology eliminates much of the logistical issues associated 
with the disposal of wet tailings under winter conditions.  The tailings produced from 
the underground mining program are expected to be primarily classified as potentially 
acid generating based on accepted ABA practices.  The time to acidity for the tailings 
is expected to be greater than the duration of the underground mining for the reasons 
discussed below.   

There are some higher sulphide ores (>15%) that will be milled during the production 
phase which appear to be more reactive than the remainder of the deposit.  The 
higher sulphide material is not concentrated in the deposit and does not represent a 
significant portion of the deposit.  As a result it is expected that the higher sulphide 
material will become blended with the less reactive tailings and should not result in 
the onset of acid rock drainage during the production phase.  The bulk of the ore is 
expected to have greater than 30 years to potential onset of acid rock drainage 
based on an examination of ore samples from the 1970s.  To date no kinetic testwork 
is available to support the assumptions with respect to the possible time to onset of 
acid rock generation.   

A suitable engineered cover will be installed at the end of the underground 
production phase to cap and isolate the tailings from water and oxygen.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

21.6.2 WATER MANAGEMENT 

The proposed Mactung project requires freshwater for potable water supply, pump 
glands, and mixing of reagents.  It is estimated that the peak demand for fresh water 
will be approximately 34 m3/h.  Fresh water will be supplied to the project from a 
primary pumping station on the southern tributary of the Hess River, and possibly a 
seasonal pumping station located closer to the mine site.  This water demand is 
required year-round during periods of active milling.   

The fresh water utilized by the project will be collected with the process water during 
tailings dewatering activities and report to the polishing pond.  Process water for 
milling will be sourced from a reclaim barge located at the Ravine Dam.  The overall 
process water demands for the project are estimated to be 161 m3/h.   

Diversion ditches and berms will be installed to divert water away from the TSF.  
Waters routed away from the TSF end up in the Ravine Dam which will serve as a 
polishing pond during periods of active discharge to the receiving environment.  It is 
anticipated that the Ravine Dam will discharge periodically during the year and 
possibly during extended periods of suspended operations when process water is not 
required for milling.  Pumping will be used to discharge excess water from the Ravine 
Dam; the pipe discharge will be directed into an engineered energy dissipation 
structure prior to re-entering the natural drainage channel.  

The need for treatment of the discharges from the Ravine Dam remains to be 
determined and will be based on the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER) and 
water quality objectives for the project.  Should the Water Licence for the project be 
based on the MMER, then the treatment requirements would not be as stringent as 
opposed to water quality objectives under the CCME.  

2 1 . 7  E N V I R O N M E N T A L  M A N A G E M E N T  A N D  P L A N N I N G  

NATC is planning to minimize environmental risk through the development of an 
Environmental Management System (EMS) for the project.  The EMS will contain 
detailed information on spill and disaster response, waste materials handling and 
emergency contact information for the project.  Operating plans for mining and milling 
will be reviewed periodically and developed in accordance with the EMS for the site. 

A list of locations and quantities of reagents and other hazardous materials used at 
the site will be maintained throughout the production phase.  This information will 
allow emergency and environmental personnel to be fully aware of hazards that may 
be encountered. 

The underground mining methods to be used at the Mactung mine are favourable to 
the effective management of waste materials to reduce potential long-term risks at 
the site.  The use of backfill in the mine development process will create the 
opportunity for underground disposal of dry stack tailings with low carbonate

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

mineralization in addition to waste rock materials identified as having either acid-rock 
drainage or metals leaching concerns.  The mining and primary crushing processes 
will also occur underground, minimizing the potential for releases to the receiving 
environment based on accidents or spills from these processes. 

A production-phase geochemical characterization program will be developed to track 
materials being stored.  This production phase program will include field and 
laboratory static and kinetic testwork to confirm the assumptions made during the 
application and permitting phases and also to provide information for verification of 
the post closure site environmental model. 

21.7.1 BIOLOGICAL MONITORING 

Under the Yukon's regulatory and assessment process for mine development of 
major mine development projects, NATC may be required to undertake a number of 
wildlife, aquatic, and vegetation monitoring components.  It is not anticipated that any 
monitoring programs will exceed those normally expected for similar projects.  
Consequently, monitoring concerns are not anticipated to limit project feasibility.  The 
potential scope and subject of potential monitoring requirements are outlined below. 

WILDLIFE 

Based on the sensitivity of wildlife features in the Mactung project area, it is expected 
that the scope of recommended or required monitoring will fall within generally 
accepted monitoring practices.  Those anticipated and generally accepted practices 
include: 

• General Monitoring Program: Wildlife sightings within the project area will be 
logged, including time, location, activity, group sizes, etc.  This information 
would aid in monitoring migration routes, and presence of wildlife near 
project infrastructure. 

• Wildlife Incident Log: All wildlife incidents and interactions with people will be 
logged (e.g. road kills or injuries, bear attacks, bears in waste).  Based on 
the information gathered, NATC will cooperate and work with governments 
and other interested stakeholders to improve wildlife management programs 
at the project area.  

• Hunting Policies: NATC will incorporate a no hunting/firearms policy for 
employees while they are at the site.  

FISHING 

Required fisheries monitoring activities will conform to generally accepted industry 
Best Management Practices (BMPs) or government requirements and would form 
the conditions of fisheries permitting, including the following components: 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 21-41 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

• Construction Monitoring: An environmental professional would monitor 
construction activities around watercourses to provide assurance that permit 
conditions are met.  This may also include components such as fish salvage, 
or completion of erosion/sediment control plans. 

• Post-construction Monitoring: An environmental professional would monitor 
the effectiveness of fisheries compensation measures, long term 
watercourse stabilization measures, as well as the effectiveness of re-
vegetation in riparian areas.  

AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT 

Comprehensive aquatic environment baseline studies have been conducted at the 
Mactung site, which includes the surveying of benthic fauna, stream sediment metals 
and grain size, as well as periphyton and primary productivity.  Based on these 
studies, no aspects of the receiving environment or project plan have been identified 
that are predicted to require unconventional ongoing monitoring programs.  

It is anticipated that NATC will be required to undertake standard aquatic monitoring 
under the terms of a 'Type A' Water Licence for the Mactung site and the Federal 
MMER Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) program.  NATC plans to initiate 
EEM monitoring as the project progresses as the implementation of such a program 
will provide an ongoing, structured regime of monitoring that will identify changes in 
aquatic health throughout the life of the project, and will protect NATC from future 
liabilities at the site.  

VEGETATION 

Based on vegetation baseline study program conducted at the Mactung site, a low 
overall risk to vegetation communities identified based on chemical, community level, 
and species level surveys.  Consequently, it is anticipated that those monitoring 
programs required of NATC under the terms of development permitting will be 
conventional studies related to the ongoing effects of operations and site 
reclamation.  Examples may include trace element concentrations monitoring and 
invasive plant monitoring.

This section outlines the Closure Plan requirements as part of the permitting process 
for the proposed Mactung project.  EBA reviewed available information for the major 
mining components to determine if it is feasible to meet these requirements.  Further, 
each project component has been identified in reference to the overall reclamation 
goals and objectives as well as the final land use objectives for the site. 

Based on the review, EBA determined that the project, as proposed, would provide 
suitable closure techniques and that final abandonment would be feasible for the site. 

2 2 . 1  R E C L A M A T I O N  G O A L S  A N D  O B J E C T I V E S  

NATC is committed to using environmental management techniques during all 
phases of the operation that will minimize potential environmental impacts from the 
Mactung project.  Progressive reclamation activities to reduce site liability will be 
conducted when possible; however, much of the site infrastructure cannot be 
reclaimed until the end of the Production Phase. 

The main surface infrastructure for the project will include: 

• a new, approximately 40-km long access road in Yukon 

• an extension and upgrade of an existing airstrip in MacMillan Pass, Yukon 

• a freshwater pumphouse located on the southern tributary of the Hess River, 
with associated access road, powerline and piping 

• power generation facilities (including potential wind turbines) with associated 
site power distribution 

• a process water polishing pond with associated diversion ditching 

• a dry stack tailings facility with associated diversion berm 

• a mill building 

• an equipment maintenance shop and office complex 

• access roads between site infrastructure 

• a 150-person camp. 

The proposed resource access road to the Mactung site will be constructed entirely 
within Yukon.  Following end-of-site decommissioning, EBA anticipates that 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 22-2 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

responsibility for this road may be returned to the Government of Yukon, if the road is 
deemed to be a government asset.  The Government of Yukon may request financial 
security for the resource access road during the initial construction and production 
phase of the project. 

The extension and improvements to the surface of the MacMillan Pass airstrip will 
result in an overall improvement of this facility.  It is unlikely that Government of 
Yukon will require reclamation of the airstrip, since this infrastructure provides for a 
public aerodrome. 

Approximately 50% of the tailings produced during the underground mining phase of 
the project will be used to progressively backfill the underground workings.  Using 
tailings as mine backfill will reduce the long-term environmental concerns for surface 
storage.  The use of dry-stacked tailings also eliminates the necessity for a tailings 
impound dam.  The 50% portion of tailings that will be dry-stacked and surface 
stored must be capped prior to abandonment.  The anticipated construction 
procedure of the dry-stacked tailings facility does not allow for progressive capping.  
The process water aging and runoff storage pond created by the ravine dam will be 
recontoured.  The dam will be breached in a v-notch fashion and an erosion 
preventing streambed will be constructed through the dam structure.  Drainage 
patterns will be re-established in the area of the previous reservoir.  Once complete, 
the stream will once again be continuous from its natural headway to the confluence 
of Tributary A.  All water diversion structures constructed will be removed.  The 
diversion channel on the north side of the valley will be filled in and runoff water will 
be able to flow into the stream at the base of the valley. 

During decommissioning activities, all building, salvageable equipment and 
inventories will be removed from site.  Hazardous materials will be removed from site 
and disposed of in an approved disposal facility.  Any non-salvageable waste 
materials and structures will be broken down to ground level and preferably disposed 
in the underground workings. 

Periodic inspection and monitoring of the site after closure will be required.  The 
MMER regulations will continue to apply to the Mactung site for a period of three 
years following closure; it is also expected that Government of Yukon will require 
some form of more frequent inspection and monitoring for a period of up to 5 years 
post closure. 

2 2 . 2  L A N D  U S E  O B J E C T I V E S  

Land use objectives for decommissioning and closure are normally developed for a 
project area to guide the overall reclamation strategy for the project.  These 
objectives are often developed in accordance with objectives laid out in higher-level 
management plans, as well as through consultation with First Nations, community 
members, and other stakeholders. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 22-3 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Current land use in the project area is primarily wildlife habitat, with most wildlife 
utilizing a portion of the site during the year.  The limited road access into the project 
area has limited the level of general use of the area.  There has been some past 
exploration activity in the area of the proposed access road to the Mactung site.  
There is also a network of trails near the start of the proposed access route to the 
mine site. 

During the construction and production phases of the project, the lands will be 
considered industrial usage, and access to the site will be controlled to ensure safe 
operations.  The underground nature of the project ensures that the disturbance 
footprint of the mine site is minimal and that effects of changes in the land use are 
only temporary.  Following site decommissioning and abandonment, reclamation 
activities will return the site to as close to the pre-mining state as practical. 

It is expected that the post-closure wildlife usage of the site will return to pre-mining 
levels.  There may be an increased usage during the initial post-closure phase 
because of that initial high availability of forage from reclamation activities.  The lack 
of a tailings pond and the proposed encapsulation of the tailings wastes will ensure 
that these facilities are capable of meeting the final land use objectives for the 
Mactung project.

This section of the report outlines the proposed philosophy and approach required to 
execute engineering and construction activities needed to put the Mactung project 
into production. 

This Project Execution Plan (PEP) defines the relationship between engineering, 
procurement, and construction activities.   

2 3 . 2  I M P L E M E N T A T I O N  S T R A T E G Y  

NATC will design and direct pre-production mine development activities, and appoint 
a small project team to oversee project execution.  The initial steps of the 
implementation strategy will include: 

• the selection of an EPCM company to undertake the design of the material 
handling, process plant, and infrastructure facilities and to manage the full 
project construction activity 

• the selection of an engineering group for the engineering and procurement 
(EP) 

• the ordering of long-lead equipment items. 

Project risks will be managed using the EPCM scheduling, cost reporting and control, 
and purchasing and contracting strategy.  The construction contracting strategy may 
be based on either: 

• the award of multiple contracts commensurate with when the various 
engineering components will be delivered 

• a general contractor that will supply the majority of labour and equipment 
and make use of specialty sub-contractors as needed.

23.3.1 ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW 

Working under the administration of NATC's project team, the EPCM contractor will 
be lead by a Project Manager, who will be responsible for the execution of the 
project's established schedule, capital cost, safety, environmental, and quality 
targets.  The organizational chart is shown in Figure 23.1. 

23.3.2 OWNER'S RESPONSIB IL IT IES 

NATC will retain responsibility for the following activities: 

• mine planning and underground mine development 

• communication with local communities and the media 

• accounting and invoice payment 

• all permits or licenses required for construction, operation, and 
environmental compliance 

• operation staffing, operator training, commissioning, and start-up. 

23.3.3 EPCM CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIB IL IT IES 

The EPCM team will establish a project management system that will contribute to 
the overall cost reporting and scheduling for the project, as well as establish a 
comprehensive baseline plan to monitor project progress and productivities.  This 
plan will help project teams quickly identify and correct early departures from the 
plan. 

23.3.4 PROJECT PROCEDURES MANUAL 

A comprehensive Project Procedures Manual will outline the procedures and 
requirements for the execution of the project administrative activities, as well as 
Owner and EPCM contractor rights, authorities and obligations.  The overall Project 
Procedures Manual will be prepared by the EPCM contractor, and then issued to 
NATC for review and comment prior to formal issue.

The period prior to project financing approval will be used to establish the core 
project team, freeze project concepts, set-up, and baseline the project and advance 
the design and procurement of long-lead items.  

The intention is to commence this phase as soon as the set-up and baselining 
contracts are in place.  This phase is expected to take six months to complete and 
will proceed in parallel with basic engineering and project financing.  It will also 
overlap with the commencement of the detailed engineering and construction phases 
to a certain extent. 

Once the project has received full funding, the engineering and construction phase 
will then proceed to detailed engineering design, procurement, and construction 
activities.

23.5.1 ENGINEERING STRATEGY 

Primary out-sourced engineering work will include the following categories: 

• water, waste and tailings design 

• process facilities, site development and infrastructure, including the main 
access road and the transmission line. 

23.5.2 BASIC  ENGINEERING 

Basic engineering tasks will include the following: 

• Updating of the PFDs, Equipment List, P&IDs, General Arrangement 
drawings, Electrical SLDs, and Load Flow reports. 

• The engineering contractor will provide licencing and permitting assistance 
to NATC as required. 

• Specifications will be developed to obtain competitive and firm price bids for

23.7.2 FIELD ENGINEERING 

SURVEYING 

The CM survey crew will verify the accuracy of the existing control system before 
construction begins.  The Construction Manager will verify surveys prior to 
construction.  Contractors will supervise day-to-day field surveying, and the CM team 
will provide spot checks. 

QUALITY CONTROL/QUALITY ASSURANCE 

Contractors will establish and observe their own Quality Control program in 
accordance with the construction technical specifications and the applicable codes 
and standards.  The CM Field Engineering Team will employ independent CSA-
qualified Quality Assurance specialists to ensure quality control. 

23.7.3 CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING 

The contracting strategy will be designed to maximize the local labour force, create a 
responsible and sustainable relationship with the nearby communities, and provide a 
mix of senior management and specialists to support the safety, quality, schedule, 
and cost objectives of the project.  In addition, contracts will be designed to combine 
timing, scope, battery limits, and contract value into manageable packages.  

Approved contract pro formas will be utilized for construction and service contracts.   

23.7.4 MATERIALS MANAGEMENT 

WAREHOUSING 

The Site Materials Management group will receive, inspect, and log all incoming 
materials, assign storage locations, and maintain a database of all materials received 
and dispensed to the contractors.   

SITE HOUSEKEEPING AND HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT 

Procedures for waste management and spill response will be implemented for the 
construction period.  These procedures will be established in the Project Procedures 
Manual and will outline compliance, auditing, and reporting requirements.   

CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT 

Individual contractors will be responsible for the equipment required to meet their 
contract obligations.  All equipment must comply with Mine Safety Branch

requirements; NATC's CM team will perform regular spot checks.  Large cranes may 
be supplied by a single company, managed by the CM team. 

CONSTRUCTION CAMPS 

Development of a full-service camp for construction contractors will begin in June 
2010, immediately following the receipt of construction permits.   

The camp – a modular design with propane heat – will accommodate up to 250 
workers.  Accommodations types will include single occupancy rooms.  A recreation 
complex will house games and gym facilities. 

Transportation, potable water, waste management and other support services will be 
scaled to support the various development stages.  The CM team will ensure that 
catering contractor meets all facilities, staffing, hygiene, food handling, storage, and 
meal expectations. 

Only prescription drugs will be permitted on site.  No firearms or alcohol will be 
allowed on site. 

TEMPORARY FACIL IT IES AND CONSTRUCTION SITE INFRASTRUCTURE 

Communicat ion  

NATC's systems manager will determine the appropriate telecommunications 
technologies for the project.  Requirements include voice and data link technologies 
adequate to support growth construction and plant operation growth. 

The communications framework for management offices will be installed early in the 
construction period.   

Construct ion Power  

Approximately 1 MW of operating power capacity and one spare for camp utilities 
(excluding heat) and limited construction facilities will be required during the 2010 to 
2012 construction period.  By the second quarter of 2012, permanent power will 
supply all mine equipment and peak construction power loads for the remaining 
duration of the construction phase. 

Firs t -a id  and Si te  Secur i ty  

NATC will provide a fully-equipped first-aid facility and ambulance for project-wide 
use.  The facility will normally be staffed 12 h/d, with on-call services ensuring 
continuous coverage.  The first-aid staff will live at the camp.  Contractors will be 
expected to provide basic first-aid stations at the site. 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 23-10 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

NATC will supply a 24-hour staffed site security program during the initial field 
mobilization in 2010.  Access to the site will be controlled at the principal road 
entrance and will be limited to personnel who have attended induction training, as 
well as approved visitors. 

EARLY CONSTRUCTION ACTIV IT IES 

Receipt of the construction permits in May 2010 will launch initial construction 
activities from June to September. 

The first trucks on the Canol Road will transport the construction camp trailers to the 
project site.  Heavy civil equipment including bulldozers, excavators, gravel trucks, 
loaders, bobcats, graders, water trucks, fuel trucks, and pick-up trucks will be 
transported.  Trucks will also transport generators, fuel, electrical supplies, plumbing 
supplies, aggregate plant, carpentry supplies, and food. 

The camp will include approximately 13 modules, comprised of: 

• six modules for accommodations 

• three modules for kitchens 

• one module for the sewage treatment plant (STP) 

• one module each for water supply, recreation, and change room. 

The second 49-person camp module will be transported and set up at the MacMillan 
Pass Airstrip.  Generators, STP, and water storage will be set up.  More heavy civil 
equipment will be transported and off-loaded at the airstrip.  

The permanent 150-person camp will be transported to the site and operational in 
September. 

Work will commence to upgrade the airstrip.  The access roads will be constructed 
from both ends and will be completed in September.  

INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION ACTIV IT IES 

The activities during this period will involve major construction of non-temporary 
infrastructure, including the STP, the fuel tanks, and the process plant.  This 
construction phase is scheduled to start in the last week of September and will last 
for 14 weeks, after which the camp will have a capacity of 250 people. 

MAJOR CONSTRUCTION AND MINING ACTIV IT IES 

The final phase of construction will involve the commencement and completion of all 
remaining site facilities and services.  The bulk of the work will focus on completing 
the process plant, mine development and underground facility and services 



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 23-11 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

installation, and generator installation and start up.  Additional work will be the 
construction of auxiliary buildings and the completion of all site services including the 
development of a fresh/fire water system.  

The DSTF will be constructed from dewatered tailings hauled to the site by a 
combined conveyor belt and haul trucks.  The tailings material is spread out into a 
600 mm thick lift using a dozer and then compacted using a vibratory compactor.  
Construction will continue during the operating years. 

A dam will be constructed downstream from the plant to collect surface run-off from 
the tailings facility, and to age process water for re-use in the mill. 

The activities will commence in Q1 2011 and be completed 93 weeks later in Q3 
2012.  The project will be in full production in Q1 2013, after three to four months of 
plant commissioning. 

HEALTH,  SAFETY,  AND ENVIRONMENTAL 

A fully-integrated workplace safety and environmental responsibility program will be 
implemented to help achieve a "zero-harm" goal.  The development of effective 
Health, Safety, and Environmental (HS&E) practices will require a high level of 
communication, motivation, and involvement, including alignment with site 
contractors on topics such as safety training, occupational health and hygiene, 
hazard and risk awareness, safe systems of work, and job safety analysis.  Tools will 
be implemented for performance tracking and accountability, including procedures 
for incident management. 

All design and engineering stages incorporate criteria for responsible methods of 
process flows, effluent, and waste products, in order to meet established capture and 
containment guidelines.  The design also incorporates clean plant design standards, 
including operational safety and maintenance access requirements. 

A Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) will be conducted by the project design 
team during each plant area's detailed design stage.  Environmental protection will 
be incorporated in both the design of the main plant processes, as well 
transportation, storage, and material disposal. 

2 3 . 8  P R E - P R O D U C T I O N  M I N E  D E V E L O P M E N T  

Underground mining equipment delivery is expected in Q4 2010.  The pre-production 
mine development will commence in early Q1 2011 with the installation of generators 
and air compressors.  A temporary mine dry will be installed.   

Two ramps to the underground mine will be developed to provide permanent access 
to future underground mine workings.  Concurrent with the existing adit rehabilitation 
will be the construction of the 512 m by 5 m by 4 m conveyor decline at a –13%

gradient, with projected completion in Q4 2011.  At about this time, the drift, ore 
pass, and Crusher Station will be excavated at 1778 m level elevation.  The Crusher 
Station will be completed in Q1 2012.   

A drift will be driven from the conveyor decline to commence the excavation of the 
Tailings Backfill Load-out Station for completion in Q1 2012. 

The completion of the conveyor decline is subsequently followed by the excavation of 
the North Ramp to access the Upper and Lower 2B ore zones in Q4 2011.   

The pre-production stope developments will commence in Q4 2011 all the way to Q2 
2012 in order to prepare the underground mine for production. 

The power plant will be completed and commissioned in Q2 2012.  The electrical 
underground substation will be installed in Q2 2012 followed by the completion of the 
electrical feeders and distribution systems in Q3 2012. 

The commissioning of the primary crusher and the ore conveyor in the decline will be 
completed in Q2 2012 and followed by the tailings backfill conveyor in Q4 2012. 

The mine will be ready for full production in Q1 2013 with development ore supplied 
to the mill during the commissioning phase in the Q4 2012. 

2 3 . 9  P R O J E C T  C O N T R O L S  

23.9.1 COST 

The project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) defines the elements of project scope.  
The first step in the project implementation process will be to confirm the project 
WBS and distribute the control estimate. 

The definitive estimate produced at the conclusion of basic engineering will become 
the control estimate for project execution.  Budgets will then be cast for the approved 
scope, which will become the baseline control document against which the project 
will be measured. 

Cost management allows the EPCM team to quickly evaluate and minimize any 
potential negative effects of capital control budget deviations.  A project cost 
management system will provide comprehensive cost reporting, forecasting, and 
trending. 

The project team will implement a coordinated program to review the project 
Estimate at Completion (EAC), together with engineering, procurement, and the 
construction management team.   



 

 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 23-13 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

A cash flow will be established once the contracting strategy and construction 
schedules are finalized and the estimate is recast into procurement packages.    
Deviations from the scope of the control estimate will be evaluated with respect to 
cost and schedule impact against the funds approved for the project. 

23.9.2 PLANNING 

The project master schedule highlights project milestones and critical sequences.  
Executive level reports provide an ongoing overview of project status.  Detailed 
schedules track the planned and actual progress throughout the duration of the 
project.  Progress reporting is based on earned or weighted value progress 
measurement for work in place, trend analysis, and other techniques as required to 
ensure precise reporting of project status. 

23.9.3 DOCUMENT CONTROL 

A collaborative document control system will be implemented that provides status 
and version control for all issued documents.  Documents will be linked to the 
equipment database to ease the delivery of an accessible control system to the 
operations group at the completion of the design and construction phases. 

23.9.4 RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 

A formal risk management program will commence during the Feasibility Study 
phase and will continue through commissioning.  The project team will periodically 
review risks and opportunities, and take appropriate action to minimize the impact on 
overall costs and scheduling. 

2 3 . 1 0  P R O J E C T  S C H E D U L E  

23.10.1 GENERAL 

The first scheduled project implementation tasks are long delivery equipment 
(grinding mills, crushers, filters, thickeners, dryers, power generators, conveyors, 
underground mining equipment ) ordering, process facilities basic engineering 
commencement, and facilities construction.  The overall project execution duration, 
from the ordering of long lead time equipment to mechanical completion, is expected 
to be about 37 months.  The duration from commencement of field construction 
(Phase 1 camp construction) to mechanical completion is about 28 months.  The 
overall duration assumes that required financing will be in place to allow all phases of 
the project to proceed at their projected start times, and that all permits will be in 
place for the work to proceed as planned and without stoppages. 

The project development schedule is summarized in Figure 23.3.

23.10.2 CONSTRUCTION LABOUR 

The schedule is based on a 70-hour work week.  Crew rotations are assumed to be 
three weeks on-site and one week off-site.   

It is anticipated that there are about 1.0 million direct and indirect construction man-
hours, excluding mine pre-development and engineering.  A peak of about 250 
persons on-site is also expected during the construction phase of the project.  The 
distribution of labour is shown in Figure 23.4. 

23.10.3 MILESTONES AND SCHEDULE STRATEGY 

The schedule reflects a traditional approach to project execution.  Field construction 
will start only after engineering tasks are adequately advanced, in order to 
accommodate major equipment long lead delivery times.  Engineering will continue 
early in the project, and many of the construction work packages can be issued on a 
fixed-price basis, thus reducing cost risk. 

The project schedule requires interim project financing shortly after the completion of 
the Feasibility Study.  This interim financing will accommodate long delivery items 
and ensure camp and power transformer preparedness. 

DSTF construction activities are highly weather-dependent.  The phased completion 
of the DSTF containment areas and the ravine dam have accordingly been 
scheduled to collect surface runoff from the tailings facility and to age process water 
capture for re-use in the processing plant. 

23.10.4 CRIT ICAL  ACTIV IT IES 

The availability of early interim financing is critical to achieve sustained operations in 
Q1 2013.  The following tasks should be completed as soon as possible after the 
Feasibility Study is issued: 

• the execution of the EPCM contract will ensure that basic engineering 
commences, allowing a level of design adequate to order long delivery items  

• transmission line design 

• DSTF design 

• long delivery capital equipment ordering. 

Permits must be in place to allow initial construction to proceed in June 2010.  
Operators must be trained and ready to take over the operation of the facility upon 
project turnover.

Mechanical Completion indicates that systems are ready for safe dry-testing.  It also 
indicates that final work inspections can be completed, contract deficiency lists 
generated and resolved, and documentation for contract closeouts can be 
processed.   

The project will phase the mechanical completion sequence to level the resource 
requirements and stage the transition from construction to operation.  Critical site 
infrastructure facilities will be completed first, followed by critical process utilities 
commissioning, and then the main process equipment. 

23.11.1 MECHANICAL  COMPLETION AND COMMISSIONING INTERFACE 

With the exception of mining activities, the EPCM contractor will have responsibility 
over all facilities until Mechanical Completion.  Then, system-by-system, the plant will 
be transferred to NATC's operations team for commissioning.  

After Mechanical Completion, the EPCM contractor and the construction contractors 
will provide assistance during the commissioning and start up phase as requested. 

23.11.2 PLANT OPERATION AND PERFORMANCE TESTING 

The plant operations group will be responsible for plant operation and performance 
testing, including facility operation at various design sizes and capacities.  NATC's 
operational personnel will conduct plant performance tests, with assistance from 
suppliers.  Selected members of the project commissioning team may be asked to 
assist as required.

24.3.1 QUANTITY DEVELOPMENT AND PRIC ING 

All quantities developed are based on general arrangement drawings, process 
design criteria, process flow diagrams, and preliminary P&IDs.  Design allowances 
are applied to bulk materials based on discussions between the respective discipline 
and the estimator.  The respective discipline quantities are as detailed in the 
following sections. 

BULK EARTHWORKS 

Bulk earthworks quantities are based on rough grading designs done using Autodesk 
Land Development Desktop Civil Package.  Excavation of overburden and 
allowances for rock excavation are based on geotechnical information available at 
the time of the study.  Structural fill is costed based on aggregates being produced at 
site utilizing a portable crushing and screening plant.  The price of the aggregate 
plant is included in the processed material prices contained in the capital cost 
estimate.   

Earthwork quantities do not include an allowance for bulking or compaction of 
materials; these allowances are included in the unit prices.  Percentages of total 
quantities allocated to rock (ripped or drill/blast) waste material, and cut/fill is 
assigned based on available soils information. 

PLANT SITE SERVICES 

Plant site services quantities for fire water, fresh water, and sewage disposal are 
based on engineering designs, sketches, and P&IDs which identify pipe sizes and 
routing.

preliminary drawings and sketches and are provided in kilograms of steel.  Rubber 
lining for pumpboxes is provided on a square metre basis.  Wear plate liners and 
rubber liners are included as appropriate. 

HVAC 

Quantities for HVAC systems have been designed and calculated by Wardrop's 
building services engineer or obtained from in-house data.  Prices have been 
obtained from suppliers on budgetary quotes. 

DUST COLLECTION/SUPPRESSION 

All dust collection and suppression pricing has been sourced by Wardrop.  Dust 
suppression system and dust ducting sizes/capacities are designed by normal 
methods. 

The amount of ducting is calculated on anticipated duct runs at the project site. 

The installed price of dust ducting will be based on rates supplied by Wardrop's 
building engineer based on previous project information.  Installation costs for the 
equipment and ductwork are based on previous information from similar projects. 

PIPING 

Piping quantities are based on detailed quantity take-offs for pipe over 3" (75 mm) 
diameter and fittings.  The quantity take-offs are developed from pipe routing 'red 
line' drawings based on the detailed general arrangement drawings and the P&IDs, 
which identify pipe size.  Piping is provided as separate line items and sorted by 
WBS area and pipe specification.  Piping under 3" diameter (including fittings) is 
included as a total number of lines per area at an average length of 15 m.  Special 
piping such as stainless steel is listed separately; flanges and bolt-ups are included.  
Allowances are included for specialty items such as flexible hoses, etc. 

Painting and tagging are included as appropriate.   

Pipe insulation is quantified and quoted by an insulation supplier. 

Specifications for electrical heat tracing for the major pipelines are prepared and 
issued to suppliers for budgetary quotations.  Electrical heat tracing for all other main 
service lines is priced by Wardrop's electrical engineer, based on Wardrop's in-house 
data from previous projects.

The supply and demand of most industrial metals and minerals is cyclic and is 
influenced by many factors.  These factors include changes in demand patterns and 
the substitution of alternative products, the discovery and availability of new mines, 
and the political and economic structures of the key producing regions.  There is 
almost no exception to these rules. 

GBRM has prepared this review for the purpose of providing an overview of the 
global tungsten industry and to examine both the activity of existing producers and 
current and forward consumption patterns.  In preparing this review, GBRM has 
reviewed a large amount of data and while in some instances the validation of such 
data cannot be guaranteed, GBRM knows of no reason why such data should not be 
relied upon for the preparation of this review.  This review is intended to form part of 
the feasibility study and while no guarantee can exist with respect to future metal 
prices, the most likely scenario for tungsten metal prices based on all of the known 
factors is reasonable based on the author's professional skill, experience and 
judgement as well as the reasonable expectation that the factors outlined which can 
influence tungsten prices have been considered in determining such prices. 

2 6 . 1  P R O D U C T I O N  A N D  S U P P L Y  

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the supply structure of many of the industrial 
minerals and metals traditionally produced and consumed in Western markets was 
disrupted by two major changes in the market.  These were increases in Chinese 
production, and the change of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
(former Soviet Bloc) from importer to exporter. 

Tungsten was one of the minerals quite dramatically affected by these changes.  By 
the early 1990s, China with significant reserves and low cost of production, had 
secured over 90% of world markets for the production and sale of base concentrates.  
The Chinese processors also flooded the market with APT at prices marginally above 
the concentrate price.  As a direct result and despite previously strong financial 
histories, the great majority of Western tungsten miners were driven from the market.  
Additionally, most APT capacity outside China was eventually forced to close. 

Tungsten prices (both concentrate and APT) remained extremely low during the 
1990s and in fact well below the true cost of production.  Many Chinese mines were 
'high graded' and APT plants were artificially supported by government export 
incentives.  As a direct result, exploration and mine development programs outside 
China were almost totally abandoned.

However, commencing in the early part of this decade, the global market structure for 
tungsten again began to change, particularly driven by a rapid increase in domestic 
demand of tungsten products in China.  This signalled to the global market, two key 
issues: 

• The rapid increase in demand in China would tighten raw material 
availability to other markets, particularly given the Chinese Government 
policy of curtailing mining programs to maintain reserves for future domestic 
requirements 

• The Chinese program of developing downstream processing would place 
increased pressure on processing companies outside China.  In order to 
remain competitive and secure sufficient base concentrates, these 
companies urgently needed to develop alternative supplies outside China. 

Recognition of these circumstances has since led to a significant increase in 
exploration and mine development activities outside China and particularly in 
Vietnam, Australia, and in North and South America.  However, despite this 
increased activity, and apart from the restart of the Canadian Cantung mine in 2005, 
only small projects (i.e. Los Santos project in Spain, Malaga Project in Peru, and the 
Wolfram Camp project in Australia) have commenced operation.  No new major 
production has actually been realized and this is unlikely to occur until 2010 at the 
earliest. 

Rapid increases in mine development and operating costs, and also the very limited 
availability of high grade deposits, is increasingly indicating that a further advance in 
price structures is necessary before major new mining programs can actually be 
achieved. 

The lack of new production has been recognized by Chinese processors which have 
recently entered into a number of agreements with companies such as King Island 
Scheelite and NATC in order to assist development through input of capital and off-
take agreements.

26.2.1 EXPANSION IN  CURRENT MARKETS 

The consumption of tungsten is reasonably broad based, both in industrial and 
geographical terms.  Major applications are metal-cutting tools, drill bits, light bulb 
filaments, high temperature alloys, x-ray shielding, military use, and chemical 
applications.  Regionally, the largest consuming area is China, followed by Europe 
and North America.  China also has by far the fastest growth; however, India is also 
showing signs of rapid growth in demand albeit from a low base. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 26-3 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Most applications for tungsten are relatively mature and it is difficult to identify major 
new uses.  Minor exceptions include the replacement of lead bullets and lead fishing 
weights by tungsten, primarily for environmental reasons.  However, this would still 
represent a relatively small percentage of the market, which is unlikely to greatly 
impact on current supply and demand structures. 

More conservative projections are that China's demand will be approximately 10% 
per annum.  Other major markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA are mature 
and are expected to show a long-term growth of 2%.  Developing markets such as 
Russia, South America, Korea, India etc, while not at buoyant as China have been 
projected to experience a medium term (5 year) growth rate of 5%. 

Scrap is projected to increase over the period and the overall percentage of scrap in 
world-wide tungsten consumption has been increased from 22% to 25%. 

Over the next five years to the end of 2012, global consumption of tungsten is 
expected to increase from its current level of approximately 85,000 t W (64,500 t W 
virgin tungsten) to 110,000 t W (82,000t W virgin tungsten) per annum (See Table 
26.1).  Mature markets such as Europe and North America are only expected to grow 
by an average of 2% per annum.  Chinese domestic consumption is forecast to 
continue growing in excess of 10% per annum, largely driven by the increase in 
requirements for cutting and drilling tools.   

However, it should also be noted that China's growth over the past five years has 
averaged 15% and if these levels were to be maintained world tungsten demand will 
exceed 122,000 t W (91,500 t W virgin demand) by 2012.  In addition, China's 
continual move to end products may influence the direct consumption of tungsten in 
USA and Europe as imported finished goods replace domestic production.

26.2.2 POTENTIAL  NEW DEMAND 

There are a few applications that provide potential for increased consumption. 

• In principle, the US military has recently approved the use of tungsten as a 
replacement for lead core bullets.  However, replacement is likely to be a 
gradual transition, rather than a total industry change in the immediate 
future. 

• Expanded super alloy milling capacity has provided new product potential for 
tungsten and tungsten alloys. 

• Other relatively new uses including weighting in golf clubs and golf balls, 
significant use in motor vehicles, replacement of lead fishing weights, self 
darkening window panes and corrosion resistance of optical glass.

26.3.1 MEDIUM TERM ANALYSIS  2006-2012 

On the basis of 10% growth in China, global consumption of tungsten is expected to 
grow steadily from its current level of approximately 85,000 tonnes W per annum in 
2007 (64,500t virgin tungsten) to 109,328 tonnes W (81,996t virgin tungsten) per 
annum by 2012.  However, should China continue to grow at the 15% rate 
experienced between 1996-2006, then demand will be 122,053t W (91,540t of virgin 
tungsten) as shown in Table 26.2. 

Consequently, increased supply required to meet growth in tungsten demand from 
2006-2012 will be between 28 and 40kt W. In addition some current day operations 
are likely to be worked out in the next five to six years. Based on a 10% decline in 
current operations over the period 2006-2012 a further 5kt W of new production will 
be required taking overall requirements to between 33 and 45kt W. Areas, from 
which this increased supply could be serviced, are detailed in Table 26.2. 

As the majority of these projects are still under feasibility it is considered unlikely that 
they will all progress to production.  On this basis tungsten is projected to remain in 
tight demand until 2012 and probably beyond (Figure 26.1). Additional tungsten

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

projects to those already announced will be required in order to meet supply growth 
over this period. 

Even if China's production dropped to 5% per annum and Western world 
consumption was limited to 1.5% per annum, an additional 19ktpa W will be required 
by 2012 accommodating some 75% of propose projects.

tungsten growth will potentially exceed projected demand and could currently be 
restricted by supply.

26.3.2 LONG TERM (15 YEAR)  ANALYSIS  2007-2022 

In preparing a 15 year assessment (Figure 26.2), the following assumptions have 
been made. 

• Total production – all known projects. All announced projects, plus some 
general production increases for small projects in a range of countries.  

• Probable production – large projects under feasibility have been given a 
90% probability of coming on stream as per the timelines projected by the 
companies. Smaller projects have been given an 80% probability. These 
probabilities are considered to be extremely aggressive, and it is quite 
probable that actual production build-up will be lower than projected. 

• In all cases it has been assumed projects will take three years to build-up to 
projected capacity. Mine life has been applied based on company 
projections. 

• Long term consumption trend lines have been based on growth trends of 3, 
4 and 5% per annum. This is considered reasonable based on long-term 
world growth projections of 3.6% GDP and the fact that industrial growth has 
historically exceeded GDP.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Figure 26.2 Supply Projection 

 

It is clear from this projection that: 

• There is likely to be continued shortage of supply from 2008-2012. 

• Development of the large and medium projects Mactung, Vital, King Island 
Scheelite and Nui Phao are critical in maintaining the long-term supply 
demand balance. 

• Should the projects not be brought on line as per the current projections by 
the companies, the projected short-term supply shortages will continue past 
2010. 

• The only dedicated tungsten project that currently offers significant 
production and long (>10 years) mine life is Mactung. The development of 
this project by 2013 will be critical to long-term market supply and stability. 

• Additional significant deposits need to be located and developed in the 
timeframe 2014 onwards to negate the potential for further supply shortfalls, 
as smaller short-term mines are worked out. 

In order to support the development of new projects, it is critical that tungsten prices 
are at levels that provide ongoing adequate returns to these projects.

26.4.1 MARKET PRICE CORRELATION FOR APT AND CONCENTRATES 

The price of APT is related to the price of concentrate and with corresponding trends. 
However it is not always an absolute correlation and prices can vary depending upon 
processing costs and the prevailing attitude of individual APT producers. 

In turn, as a general guideline and under current market circumstances it is 
reasonable to assume that the market price for APT is approximately US$30-$50/mtu 
higher than the corresponding price for concentrates. Alternatively put, APT is 
increasingly becoming the traded commodity in tungsten, and tungsten concentrate 
has been declining. Therefore it is generally safer to adopt the prevailing price for 
APT and then deduct US$30-$50/mtu as a guideline price for concentrate prices, 
however some variation in price will prevail depending upon quality and the point of 
delivery etc. 

26.4.2 APT PRICE STRUCTURES 2001-2007 

Over the past six years there has been significant variation in APT prices. 

In 2001 market demand was strong as companies built up stocks, being particularly 
concerned about the potential impact of recently introduced Chinese export 
restrictions and diminished supplies from the CIS strategic stockpile. This provided 
an upward impact on prices. 

However, the projected shortages did not eventuate due to Chinese production 
remaining high and Cantung Canada coming into production. Consequently 
consumers drew down their stocks and prices again declined. 

In 2003 APT prices averaged approximately US$60/mtu and there did not appear to 
be much potential for a price increase with supply and demand in balance. 

However commencing in mid 2004, and on the back of rapidly increasing demand, 
prices increased quickly, moving to a new price structure well in excess of 
US$200/mtu and for a short period reaching US$300/mtu. However, following this 
dramatic increase, prices have since stabilised and have remained relatively steady 
during the past two years. The current price level for APT is US$250-260mtu FOB 
China.

26.4.3 FUTURE PRIC ING 2007-2015 

Whilst APT prices currently appear to have stabilised at between US$250 and 
US$260/mtu FOB China, tungsten processing companies both within China and 
more particularly outside China remain extremely concerned about future raw 
material supply. Furthermore in Japan and South Korea, there is even some 
discussion about Government agencies establishing strategic stockpiles 

With no new mining projects actually confirmed and with demand projected to 
increase between 17-26kt W over the next five years, this concern seems well 
justified. 

Challenges for the development of new tungsten mining projects outside China 
continue to increase, particularly in relation to economic grade availability, higher 
capital costs, and environmental constraints, with the net result that the time taken to 
actually establish new mining programs continues to extend.  

Increased mine development and operating costs is in fact the major issue, and 
investors in these projects will need to achieve a suitable return on investment before 
the new projects are confirmed and realised. With tungsten production based on low 
grade deposits (i.e. <1% WO3), the fuel costs associated with mining of significant 
tonnages/annum and power costs incurred in crushing and grinding these tonnages 
are, together with increasing labour costs, having a significant impact on operating 
costs. 

These increased costs and the indicated timing issues in actually establishing new 
mining programs strongly suggests that supply pressure on the market will continue 
to increase. In turn, and to provide greater encouragement to mine developers, 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 26-10 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

further price increases seem inevitable and during the next five years (if not sooner) 
it now seems certain that global market prices for APT will at least reach 
US$300/mtu (See Table 26.3). 

Table 26.3 Forecast APT Prices 2007-2012

Figure 26.4 Forecast APT Prices 2007-2015 

 

While it is difficult to accurately forecast pricing past 2012, this assessment clearly 
indicates that,based on projected supply and identified demand, APT prices will 
continue at, or above, US$300/mtu. 

The only major development currently proposed for the period 2012-2015 is the 
Mactung Project which, based on supply and demand projections, the market clearly 
requires in order to develop a stable base around larger long-term producers. 

Many of the tungsten projects which are at the early stage of assessment that could 
be brought into production in the longer term are based on much lower WO3 grades 
than Mactung, Vital and King Island Scheelite.  Consequently these projects will 
require high tungsten prices in order to be viable. 

The need to develop these types of lower grade projects, and the associated high 
operating costs, could be a further driver towards prices above the projected 
US$300/mtu from 2012 onwards (Figure XXX).

26.4.4 SUMMARY 

As a result of the constant over-supply situation through the 1990s and early 2000s, 
prices fell to low levels of US$45t/mtu for concentrates and only marginally higher for 
APT.  However, as indicated, a number of important events have occurred since then 
that have greatly influenced current and forward price structures. 

China has not only curtailed domestic mining programs, but has now become a 
significant importer of tungsten concentrates and tungsten scrap.  Also the Chinese 
Government has moved from a position of providing export incentives for tungsten 
exports to now introducing production and export quotas, and consistently increasing 
export tariffs. 

The net result of these changes coupled with the continuing growth in global demand 
has resulted in strong price increases commencing in 2004, to a current level of 
approximately US$220/mtu for concentrates and US$250-$260/mtu for APT (quoted 
price by Asian Metal News May 2008). 

With the Chinese Government strongly encouraging an even higher level of 
downstream processing (with a large percentage of these downstream products 
being consumed domestically, plus expected further increases in export tariffs for 
semi processed products) the availability of tungsten units to markets outside China 
in all forms will continue to tighten.  Furthermore, China has now become a major 
importer of tungsten concentrates and scrap. 

The net result of these changing circumstances (continued strong growth in China's 
consumption, the recognition of increasing costs to develop and operate mines 
outside China, plus the fact that tungsten has a 'high value in use' in most 
applications and substitution is unlikely) result in the conclusion that a continuing 
escalation in price structures is highly likely.  During the next five years, it is forecast 
that global prices for APT will reach or even exceed US$300/mtu. 

2 6 . 5  O P P O R T U N I T Y  F O R  N E W  P R O D U C E R S  

The projected strong growth in tungsten demand over the period 2007-2012 will 
require the development of between 33-45 kt W of new production. 

Analysis of current projects that are in the feasibility study stage indicates that, even 
if the majority come on stream, the market will continue in tight supply through to 
2012 and onwards.  However, a number of these projects are associated with junior 
mining companies that are likely to find it difficult to obtain support in today's tight 
financial markets. 

Many of the tungsten projects that are in the early stage of assessment that could be 
brought into production from 2012 onwards, are based on much lower WO3 grades 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 26-12 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

than the projects currently under feasibility and will require stable tungsten prices at 
high levels to be feasible. 

Consequently there is a definite requirement for the development of larger 
(+4,000 t/a W) mines with 15 to 20 year mine life in order to support long-term market 
demand. 

These types of world-class deposits are rare and, of the projects under feasibility 
study, only NATC's Mactung deposit is capable of achieving these production rates 
over 10 years plus. 

This project is currently scheduled to come on line in 2013, with production of 
30,000 t W over its initial 5 years of operation.  Projections are that the market will 
clearly require this additional production by 2013 and could in fact accommodate an 
earlier start-up. 

In addition to Mactung, there are only four other projects under feasibility; Vital 
Metals Watershed Project (Australia), King Island Scheelite's King Island Project 
(Australia), the Nui Phao Deposit in Vietnam, and the Hemerdon deposit in the UK 
that are projecting production levels of between 2,000 to 4,000 t/a W. 

The majority of other projects currently scheduled by the owners to come on line by 
2012 will produce less than 2,000 t/a and are based on small relatively short-term 
deposits.  On this basis, it is hard to identify sufficient supply to meet demand in 
2012, and even harder in the longer term (2012 onwards). 

With both capital and operating costs increasing significantly with processing of lower 
grade material, the tungsten price will need to remain high (+US$300/mtu APT) over 
the long term in order to attract the development of the lower grade deposits 
currently being assessed. 

This strong price trend will conversely underwrite the profitability of the projects 
scheduled to come on line between 2010 and 2013, which are based on higher 
grades (i.e. Mactung, Vital Metals, and King Island Scheelite). 

Barriers of entry for a new producer outside China with a good grade tungsten 
deposit are expected to be minimal.  In the projected strong market, long term letters 
of intent to purchase either concentrates or APT should be readily achievable and 
these would underwrite project finance.  However, these letters of intent would be 
firmly subject to the following conditions: 

• Confirmation that the operation would be relatively competitive with existing 
production programs, and that this position could be sustained for the life of 
the supply contract.  European, North American, and Japanese processors 
must still be able to access cost competitive concentrates in order to 
maintain a competitive position against finished products from China. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 26-13 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

• Confirmation of the required quality, with particular attention to the 
nominated impurity levels, including radioactivity. 

2 6 . 6  C O N C L U S I O N  

The global market for tungsten is forecast to maintain strong growth over the next 
five years and beyond.  While China continues to dominate world mining and primary 
processing, the availability of tungsten units to non-Chinese markets will continue to 
decline.  Equally important, China is now becoming a major importer of tungsten 
concentrates and scrap materials.  Ongoing rapid growth in demand by China will 
ensure that competition for raw materials between Chinese and non-Chinese 
processors will continue to intensify with the result that there is now an urgent need 
for increased mining programs outside China. 

A strong escalation in prices has already occurred over the past three years.  
However with producers struggling to meet demand, global mining costs continuing 
to increase, mining grades dropping, and the Chinese Government likely to impose 
tighter production quotas and higher export tariffs to maintain reserves, further global 
price escalation appears certain. 

Barriers of entry for new producers are relatively low apart from actual development 
costs, and new mine projects will continue to receive strong encouragement from 
processors both in and outside China. 

Despite this, only limited new tungsten production has been developed over the past 
3 to 5 years.  The only major new production has been the Cantung mine in Canada 
with smaller production from Malaga (Peru), Los Santos (Spain), and the recent 
commencement of mining at Wolfram Camp (Australia). 

While there are a number of other projects at various stages of development, from 
exploration to Bankable Feasibility Study, the timing to bring these projects into 
production is proving to be considerably longer than originally projected. 

Much of this delay has been due to the world-wide concerns impacting on the mining 
industry regarding equipment supply, labour, and increased complexity of 
government approvals.  In addition, in the tungsten industry, many of the potential 
producers are junior miners that are finding it difficult to raise the necessary finance 
for the projects. 

Consequently, for the long term stability of supply consumers are keen to form 
relationships that will assist in the development of the larger, longer term producers 
with good trade tungsten deposits.

Wardrop developed an economic evaluation of the Mactung project based on a pre-
tax financial model.  For the expected 11 year underground mine life, and 8 Mt 
reserve, the following base case pre-tax financial parameters were calculated: 

• 23.5 % internal rate of return (IRR) 

• 2.9 years payback on US$402.1 M initial capital 

• CDN$276.8 M at an 8% discount rate.  

The base case is calculated using an APT price of US$300/mtu.  Refer to section 
26.0 Market Review for more detailed commodity pricing information. 

The post-tax model was provided by NATC and audited by W.H. Taylor Inc. 
calculating the following: 

• 17.6 % IRR 

• 3.2  year payback on US$402.1 M initial capital 

• CDN$ 147.7 M NPV at an 8.0% discount rate. 

A sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the project economics against the 
base case and alternative pricing scenarios. 

The pre-tax and post-tax discounted cash flow analysis for the base is shown at the

• off-site charges including transport, marketing, and insurance 

• direct on-site operating charges including mining, milling, maintenance and 
surface, and general & administrative 

• a four-year average currency exchange rate of CDN$1.00 = US$0.88 as of 
July 18, 2008 

• royalty of 1% of the net revenue starting in Year 1. 

The mine production schedule shown in Table 18.25 was incorporated into the 100% 
equity pre-tax financial model to develop annual recovered commodity production 
from the relationships of tonnage milled, head grades, and recoveries.  The market 
price for tungsten was adjusted to a realized price level by applying transport, 
marketing, insurance, and toll conversion costs to determine the net revenue. 

Unit operating costs for mining, milling, maintenance, and general & administrative 
areas were applied to annual mined and milled tonnages to determine the overall 
mine site operating cost which has been deducted from the net revenue to derive 
annual cash flows. 

Initial and sustaining capital costs have been incorporated on a year-by-year basis 
over the mine life and were also deducted from net revenue to determine the net 
cash flow before taxes.  Initial capital expenditures include costs accumulated before 
concentrate is first produced.  Sustaining capital includes expenditures for mining 
and milling additions, replacement of equipment, and tailing facility construction.   

Working capital of CDN$12.6 M was determined on the basis of two months' mine 
site operating costs and applied to the first year of expenditures.  Working capital is 
recovered at the end of the mine life and aggregated with the salvage value 
contribution before being applied towards reclamation during closure.  This 
effectively sets the final year capital cost as zero. 

The undiscounted annual cash flows are illustrated in Figure 27.1.  

Net revenue is defined as gross revenue less off-site costs incurred for flotation toll 
conversion, concentrate transportation, insurance, and marketing charges.  
Operating cash flow is defined as the net revenue less mine site operating costs.  
Payback is calculated using the undiscounted cash flows.

27.2.3 SENSIT IV ITY ANALYSIS 

Sensitivity analyses were carried out on the following parameters:  

• tungsten prices (gravity price and APT price) 

• exchange rate 

• initial capital expenditure 

• operating costs 

• tungsten head grade. 

The analyses are presented graphically as financial outcomes in terms of NPV and 
IRR.  The project NPV (8% discount) is most sensitive to the foreign exchange rate 
and in decreasing order: head grade, gravity price, operating, and capital costs 
(Figure 27.2).  Similarly, the project IRR is most sensitive to FXR, head grade, and 
initial capital costs (Figure 27.3).

27.4.3 YUKON QUARTZ MINING ROYALTY 

The following summary of the "Yukon Quartz Mining Act" is taken from Yukon 
Government Website: 

Mining in the Yukon is administered under the Quartz Mining Act (QMA) enacted by 
the Yukon government in 2003. Section 102 of the QMA specifies an annual royalty 
payable to the Yukon Commissioner on mining profits. Under the QMA, royalty is a 
share of profits from a mine in the Yukon acquired under the QMA or the 
(predecessor) Yukon Quartz Mining Act, reserved for the Yukon government as 
owner of the mineral rights, for permitting extraction of mineral resources. It is paid 
by a mine owner or operator to the Yukon government (Table 27.3).  

The royalty is payable annually, on an escalating rate basis to a maximum rate of 
12%, for any profits from mining that exceed $10,000. The royalty-able profit is the 
amount by which the value of annual output from mining (revenues) exceeds eligible 
deductions (costs and a depreciation allowance for capital expenditures) for the year.

equipment salvage during breakdowns in open stope.  Additional remote 
control dozer is proposed to be available on site. 

Skin Pillars Skin pillars located in between stopes are to reduce possible dilution of 
unconsolidated backfill material into the adjacent mining stope.  Backfill 
dilution into the adjacent mining stope will reduce the overall grade and 
effect stope stability.  External factors such as drilling deviation and blasting 
practices, structure geological conditions and pillar strength, etc. will govern 
the stability of the pillars.  Detail geotechnical data and advance numerical 
modelling will assist in predicting pillar behaviour.

The requirements of the Yukon's assessment and permitting regime have been 
utilized to review the environmental and socio-economic information available for the 
Mactung project.  As a result of the review each section of the report has been 
divided into a summary of existing conditions as well as a description of the feasibility 
or potential risks.  In conducting this review, EBA recommended that studies be 
conducted which investigate ways to minimize risk to the project as well as to identify 
where mitigations may be required to minimize effects. 

With the completion of identified studies, continued planning and design of the 
project, and further work on consultation and traditional knowledge activities, it is 
EBA's view that the Mactung project, as proposed, is feasible from an environmental 
and permitting perspective. 

28.2.1 AVALANCHE HAZARD 

Potential avalanche hazards were identified in some areas of the proposed mine site 
during field work completed in the spring of 2008 (Figure 28.1).  The consideration of 
avalanche hazard in the areas of the Ravine Dam and DSTF are necessary due to 
the presence of workers in these areas during the winter and spring months.  The 
access road to the explosives magazine and mine site runs along the same slope as 
the DSTF and there will be year round use of this road by mine personnel and 
contractors. 

The southeastern valley slopes above the proposed Ravine Dam show evidence of 
avalanche runout that extend towards the valley bottom.  The proposed diversion 
ditch on this side of the valley has a high likelihood of being impacted by avalanches.  
Cleaning of debris from the diversion ditching will be required seasonally to ensure 
that the ditching operates as per design.  Spring cleaning of the ditching may require 
prior assessment or management of the avalanche hazard prior to allowing 
equipment and personnel to conduct this work.

There is also evidence of avalanche runout from upslope that extends into the area 
of the proposed DSTF (Photo 28.1).  The proposed diversion berm, to divert surface 
waters away from the tailings facility, is located upslope of this infrastructure and has 
a high probability of avalanche impact.  Consideration should be given during the 
detailed design of this berm to provide some protection from avalanche runout to the 
tailings facility.  There are similar concerns with maintenance activities conducted on 
the diversion berm during winter and spring months.

Note: Photo taken by Chris Dixon (2007). 

The area of the proposed powerhouse and mill were inspected in the field, where 
terrain with high avalanche potential is located upslope of these components.  The 
proposed powerhouse location is within an avalanche runout zone.  Relocation of the 
powerhouse will be considered during detailed engineering to reduce the risk of 
avalanche impact.  

The proposed mill building site appears to be in an area with a low to moderate 
probability of avalanche impact; however, further avalanche assessment is required 
to fully determine the avalanche impact potential in this area.  One section of 
moderate slopes is located above the proposed camp (Photo 28.2).  Further 
assessment is required to determine if this slope is steep enough for avalanche 
initiation.

The assessment of avalanche hazard identified a number of areas along the 
proposed access road with potentially moderate to high avalanche potential (Figure 
28.2).  Additional assessment work was recommended to determine whether the 
exposure of the proposed road to avalanche hazard could be avoided through 
routing.  Further avalanche assessment work was completed to assist in a Road 
Avalanche Hazard Program which is expected to be utilized in the development 
phase of the project.

RPA has recommended further drilling to improve the reliability of the mineral 
resource estimates in the upper 3 zones (3D, 3E, and 3F) as well as on the periphery 
and northerly portions of all zones.  Initial efforts should focus on the areas of the 
deposit where the higher grades have not been entirely closed off by peripheral 
drilling.   

By converting the inferred mineral resources to indicated categories, Wardrop sees a 
potential positive economic benefit to the project in terms of extending the life of mine 
and possibly, complementing the higher grade ore. 

Wardrop has proposed a 3D block model at 6 m x 6 m x 6 m size to potentially 
improve selective mining and hence improve grade control, which would result in 
increased head grade during the initial years of mining. 

2 9 . 2  M I N I N G  

The viability of decreasing the mine breakeven cut-off grade from 0.616% WO3 will 
be investigated based on the feasibility study economics.  This would potentially 
increase the mineral reserves to lengthen the life of the underground mine. 

The underground excavation support requirement is designed based on current 
understanding of Mactung ground conditions. A detailed investigation of the site's 
permafrost conditions may provide essential mine design parameters.  With a better 
understanding of the ground conditions, the support system and its requirements can 
be optimized to possibly result in cost savings to the project. 

Evaluate backfill characteristics as frozen fill in concurrence with the investigation of 
the permafrost conditions at Mactung will further assist mine design and pillar 
configuration.  A mix design for treated mill tailings and development waste rock to 
obtain frozen fill should also be investigated.  A better understanding of the backfill 
behaviour will promote confidence on the mining method and achieve optimal 
extraction sequences that would improve productivity and ore grades in the initial 
years of mining. 

Investigate the potential for an open pit to mine shallow higher grade ore to replace 
lower grade ore in the underground mine, to further enhance project economics.  
This could potentially add an additional 17 years of mine life.  A scoping level study

was undertaken that indicates the potential for an open pit mine to contribute 
financial value to the project after the depletion of the underground mine.   

Investigate underground mining of the shallow high grade ore behind the north pit 
highwall in conjunction with open pit mining.  The additional higher grade ore to 
complement the open pit ore would add more value to the project economics.

The recommendation for future testwork is to gather environmental data and to 
confirm the results obtained in the pilot plant tests of 1985.  There are some 
opportunities for possible cost reductions with regards to the process equipment 
selected. 

2 9 . 4  P E R M I T  R E Q U I R E M E N T S  

The majority of the permits required for a producing mine are now issued by the 
Yukon Government.  The centralized permit process certainly would be beneficial to 
the project in obtaining timely permits in ensuring timely start of the construction 
process in 2010. 

2 9 . 5  T A I L I N G S  D I S P O S A L  

Further optimization of the dry stacked tailings disposal relative to materials for its 
construction, the conveyor, and trucking system and method of handling and 
placement would possibly reduce costs and enhance confidence in the design.

EBA has recommended the following items: 

• The development of an EMS for the project will make available detailed 
information on spill and disaster response, waste materials handling and 
emergency contact information for the project.   

• The underground mining methods to be used at the Mactung mine are 
favourable to the effective management of waste materials to reduce 
potential long-term risks at the site.  The use of backfill in the mine 
development process will create the opportunity for underground disposal of 
dry stack tailings thus minimizing deposition on surface of waste rock 
materials identified as having acid-rock drainage concerns.  The mining and 
primary crushing processes will also occur underground, minimizes the

potential for releases to the receiving environment based on accidents or 
spills from these processes. 

• A production-phase geochemical characterization program will be developed 
to track materials being stored.  This production phase program will include 
field and laboratory static and kinetic testwork to confirm the assumptions 
made during the application and permitting phases and also to provide 
information for verification of the post closure site environmental model. 

2 9 . 7  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  

Construction cost of the site facilities such as the mill building layout may be reduced 
during detailed engineering.  As more site data is made available, re-design of 
buildings would focus on minimizing excavations, structures and concrete quantities.   

Further optimization of the power plant configuration would be an area under 
consideration during detailed engineering to reduce initial project capital.  

Pre-construction of buildings off-site are certainly issues to be investigated to reduce 
high cost of site work. 

Conduct further optimization on conveyor layouts for the ore and tailings handling 
systems.

Evaluate the site specific wind resource data currently being accumulated to develop 
definitive wind energy assessment.  This supplementary renewable energy source 
would reduce project operating cost substantially over the long term due to projected 
high diesel fuel costs.

Wardrop developed three scenarios with varying economic parameters to evaluate 
the Mactung project on a pre-tax basis.  The base case scenario for the Feasibility 
Study indicates an NPV of CDN$276.8 M at an 8% discount rate and an IRR of 
23.5%.  These figures were obtained using the forecast metal prices as 
recommended by GBRM. 

Sensitivity of the project was evaluated based on metal price, exchange rate, grades, 
operating costs, and capital costs.  The project NPV is most sensitive to the foreign 
exchange rate and, in decreasing order, head grade, price, operating, and capital 
costs.

The following interpretations and conclusions are made with respect to the Mactung 
mineral resource estimated completed by Scott Wilson RPA. 

• Scott Wilson RPA completed a solid model, or wireframe, and multiple-seam 
2D GSM block model for Mactung.  The 2D model contains two separate 
estimates of grade (Kriged and Polygonal) and a single estimate of vertical 
thickness for each block based on the solid model.  Scott Wilson RPA 
considers the kriged estimate more appropriate for this deposit.  A minimum 
thickness of 4.5 m has been applied to the model and grades have been 
diluted to the minimum thickness where necessary. 

• The kriged estimate contains an indicated mineral resource of 33 million 
tonnes grading 0.88% WO3, or 290 kt of contained WO3.  An additional 
resource of 11.9 million tonnes grading 0.78% WO3, or 92 kt WO3, has 
been estimated for the inferred category.  These estimates, which are based 
on assays capped at unique levels for each zone, are reported at a block 
cut-off of 0.5% WO3, which Scott Wilson RPA considers appropriate for the 
location and cost profile that can be expected for Mactung. 

• CIM definitions (December 2005) were followed for the classification of the 
mineral resources.  Scott Wilson RPA estimates an average drill spacing of 
50 m based on the average distance between each composite and its four 
nearest neighbours.  Scott Wilson RPA considers the spacing close enough 
to classify approximately 76% of the estimated resources as indicated.

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

• Both the kriged and polygonal estimates are virtually identical in terms of 
contained metal at the stated cut-off, although the polygonal estimates are 
lower in tonnage and higher in grade.

The following conclusions have been made regarding mineral processing: 

• The mill has been designed to treat 2,000 t/d of material with a tungsten 
grade of 1.30% WO3 present as the mineral scheelite, a calcium tungstate. 

• Two scheelite concentrates will be produced, namely a gravity concentrate 
with a tungsten grade of 67% WO3 and a flotation concentrate with 55% 
WO3.  The tungsten recovery will be 55% for the gravity concentration 
process, and 27% for the flotation process for an overall recovery of 82%.  

• The mill design relies on conventional recovery processes including 
crushing, grinding, size classification, gravity concentration, flotation, 
magnetic separation, thickening, filtration drying, and bagging.  Operational 
plant experience from the Cantung Mine has also been incorporated into the 
design. 

• Fresh water usage will be controlled and reliance has been placed on the re-
use of process waters.

Two underground stoping methods will be used: LH stoping and MCF.  The use of 
these methods is determined by the geometry, dip, thickness, and strength of rock.  
LH will mine 89% of the ore and the remaining 11% will be extracted by MCF.   

Mining operations will be carried out with trackless mine equipment, diesel-powered 
loaders and trucks.  Electric-hydraulic units will be used for lateral and long-hole 
drilling. 

To optimize ore recovery and stabilize the ground, mined-out stopes will be backfilled 
with dewatered mill tailings and waste rock from mine development activities.  The 
dewatered mill tailings will have similar characteristics to hydraulic backfill for the 
material to be free draining when placed. 

Permanent 4 m rib pillars, between the 17 m wide stopes, and a 4 m thick transverse 
pillar, at 60 m along the strike length of stope lines, will remain in place to support the 
stope back.  Recovery of these pillars is not feasible as the pillars are designed to 
provide containment to the unconsolidated backfill. 

Mill tailings will be transported as backfill material to a truck loading station located 
close to the crusher station, using a conveyor belt located beside the ore conveyor.  



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 30-3 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Both this backfill material conveyor and the ore conveyor will hang from the back of 
the decline to allow personnel and equipment to pass under them. 

To ensure stable ground conditions, all major mine infrastructure (such as the 
crusher station, ramps, and raises) will be located in low grade ore areas of the 
hanging wall rock of the deposit (3C rock zone).  The rock formation in the hanging 
wall is classified to be geotechnically-competent rock. 

The mine will operate without heating of ventilation air flow to preserve the marginal 
permafrost conditions.  In the event permafrost conditions are not sustained during 
the summer, pumps will be installed to dewater the underground workings. 

30.4.1 GEOTECHNICAL 

The rock mass quality at Mactung was reported to be very good.  The geotechnical 
data collection made in this investigation is based on RQD information provided by 
Mactung mainly on MS series drill holes; rock mass parameters were determined 
based on visual interpretation of core photographs.  Initial estimates indicate good 
ground conditions. 

The ground support requirement provided is based on the current understanding of 
Mactung ground conditions.  The ground support systems design does not take into 
consideration the effect of permafrost.  Ground movement monitoring is 
recommended so that the support system and its requirements can be optimized 
using the experience obtained during operations.   

An open stope with dimensions of 20 to 40 m H with an opening of 17 m W x 60 m L 
is stable based on the stability graph analysis.  These are non-man entry stopes.  
The mining of the Upper and Lower 2B Zone is recommended from the bottom up 
(from lower to upper) when favourable higher grade is encountered in the lower 
panel.  The thickness of the waste rock in between the Upper and Lower 2B Zone is 
recommended to be greater than 15 m for mining from top to bottom.  Wardrop 
suggests mining from the lower to upper zone. 

Preliminary numerical modelling indicated that 4 m skin pillar yields a factor safety 
greater than 1.0 and relaxation of the backs.  Relaxation of the backs is anticipated 
thus cable bolting is required.   

The permafrost conditions at Mactung are reported to be marginal (D. Stewart, 
September 1982) and heat conduction through the rock is good (H. Heinicke, 
September 1979, revised April 1982).  Thus consolidated backfill induced by freezing 
is currently not considered.  The AMAX report indicated that at location XC1N (Amax, 
May-October 1973) that the heat generated by diesel power diamond drilling has 
caused thawing of the gouge zone.  

The backfill is currently considered to be passive.  The mill tailings particle size at 
Mactung satisfies the requirements for hydraulic fill material based on available data.

30.4.2 MINE VENTILATION 

An efficient ventilation system and adequate fresh, clean air is paramount to the 
safety of personnel underground.  It is important that personnel be aware of 
underground ventilation and have adequate training in terms of air supply and 
dangerous fumes.  Basic information about the ventilation system and safety features 
of the mine should be thoroughly communicated with each employee as required by 
law and mining regulation.

The following conclusions have been made regarding environmental baseline 
considerations and risks: 

• The information required for completion of the general physiography section 
of the YESAA application and regulatory documentation is considered to be 
available.  It should, however, be noted that characterization of the general 
physiography was not available at the time of preparation of the section for 
the access road from the North Canol Road to the mine site.   

• Information required for the completion of the surficial geology/soils portion 
of the YESAA application and regulatory documentation was available for 
the project area; however, more information would be required on the 
surficial geology and soil for the mine access road from the North Canol 
Road to the mine site.   

• Rock samples were submitted to provide information on acid rock drainage 
potential and metals leaching; however, the age of the core may be of 
concern.   

• The tailings for the project, based on analysis of data by Wardrop and EBA 
have been assumed to be similar in composition to the tailings produced as 
a result of mining at the nearby Cantung Mine located in the NWT.  
Comparative studies of Mactung and Cantung have been undertaken by 
EBA and Wardrop to support this assumption.   

• Terrain Hazards: 

q Rockfall is the primary erosional process in the area and results in the 
formation of extensive talus slopes. 

q Small, periodic debris flows are probably an ongoing process within 
valley sideslope stream channels and contribute to colluvial fan deposits 
mapped in the study area.  

q Avalanches are an annual occurrence in this region and probably play a 
part in some downslope transport of colluvial material in the area.  

q A number of rock glaciers are mapped in the study area, mostly on 
north-facing slopes but are not located within areas impacted by 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 30-5 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

proposed development and there is a low probability that the project will 
be impacted by large rock glaciers. 

q The terrain hazards mapping being completed for the mine access road 
from the North Canol Road to the mine site will be incorporated into the 
YESAA application.  

• Hydrology, Water Quality, and Hydrogeology: 

q The construction of the Mactung Mine will decrease the flows in 
Tributary C only during the period of filling of the Ravine Dam.  At other 
times during the production phase of the project the flows in this tributary 
will be generally unaffected with the exception of the winter months due 
to discharge of water from the Ravine Dam during this period.   

q The addition of a reservoir in the upper drainage basin is comparable to 
a lake headed drainage system.  Temperature effects on the 
downstream portion of Tributary A are anticipated to be minimal based 
on the elevation and size of the reservoir. 

q For the production period, discharge of process water from the Aging 
Pond has potential for effects on receiving water chemistry in the project 
area.  For the closure period, metal leaching from the tailings storage 
facility at the mine has potential for long term effects on receiving water 
chemistry in the project area.   

q Effluent chemistry is not anticipated to have significant negative effects 
on the surface water receiving environment, however water quality 
guidelines have changed since the initial metallurgical study was 
conducted.   

q Groundwater at the Mactung property is anticipated to exist in unfrozen 
overburden deposits and bedrock fractures.   

• Climate and Air Quality: 

q Precipitation could pose a potential risk with respect to increased 
potential for erosion and sediment transport in ditches and diversion 
channels at the site, including the ditch-lines along the proposed access 
road to the site.  This impact can be mitigated through proper ditch and 
diversion design relating to anticipated flow volumes and rip-rap 
requirements.  Revegetation, where moisture conditions allow, can also 
be conducted to mitigate impacts from erosion and provide sediment 
control. 

q Cold winter temperatures pose a risk with respect to freezing water lines 
used for plant feed and discharge lines, potable water and septic 
systems.  Ground temperatures readings from the site will be used to 
assist in service designs.  The use of adequately insulated or heat-
traced water lines will need to be installed as appropriate to mitigate this 
concern.  Utilidors and covered passageways between buildings will be 
installed to minimize the exposure of personnel to the adverse winter 
conditions.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 30-6 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

q Based on the remoteness of the mine site location, it is not believed that 
air quality will pose a risk to the feasibility of the proposed Mactung 
project. 

• Environmental Health and Aesthetics: 

q Health and safety issues related to cold temperatures for mine operation 
personnel will be mitigrated through development of operational 
procedures. 

q Based on the remoteness of the mine site location, it is not believed that 
noise will form a risk to the feasibility of the proposed Mactung project.  

q There are no full-time residents in the area, and there is limited use of 
the area for recreational purposes.  The project's impact on human or 
environmental health conditions are expected to be minimal.  

• Archaeology: 

q Subject to the results of the 2008 study, no conflicts between the 
Mactung development and archaeological sites have been found, and 
there appears to be no archaeological issues that will impact the 
feasibility of this project. 

• Vegetation: 

q The vegetation cover is highly variable within the Mactung Vegetation 
Local Study Area due to elevation, aspect, microtopography, and soil 
conditions. 

q In review of the existing vegetation baseline requirements for the YESAA 
project proposal, as well as the existing data there appears to be low 
risks to the project proposed.   

• Wildlife and Fisheries: 

q EBA conducted an extensive baseline study program at the Mactung 
project area with the objective of documenting and characterizing wildlife 
within the study area.  Both ground and aerial surveys were carried out 
starting in October 2005 and continued annually through to the fall of 
2008. 

q Wildlife use of the primary footprint area was found to be consistent with 
other areas in the region and project footprint effects on wildlife are 
expected to be primarily minimal and localized in spatial scope and 
reversible nature.  Limited secondary effects on wildlife may result from 
increased access to the area, but can be addressed through mitigation 
measures.   

q The mine footprint is at high elevation and above natural barriers that 
exclude fish thus local risks to fisheries resources resulting from the 
mine development are expected to be low and manageable through the 
implementation of appropriate and effective mitigation measures for the 
release of deleterious substances and maintenance of site hydrology.  
Other project infrastructure including the access road and water intake 
do intersect several watercourses with fisheries values, however their 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 30-7 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

potential impacts are expected to be low and controllable through the 
implementation of proper mitigation and standard industry Best 
Management Practices (BMPs). 

q Based on a review of YESAB's "Proponent's Guide", information 
requirements can be met with the current baseline information.   

30.5.1 SOCIO-ECONOMIC BASELINE CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS 

The affected communities have had considerable experience with the mining industry 
in the past; as a result, some residents have worked or are currently working in the 
mining industry.  Given this experience and knowledge of the industry, the affected 
communities will have a fairly sophisticated approach to new mining development.  
They can be expected to be generally supportive of new mining development and will 
wish to maximize the potential economic benefits to their communities; however, it is 
also expected that these communities will be highly aware of and concerned about 
long-term environmental effects.  

The relationship that NATC develops and maintains with the affected First Nations 
will have a material effect on the feasibility of the project.  In practical terms, this 
relationship will likely be shaped by the negotiation and signing of socio-economic 
participation agreements.  These agreements are not a legal or permitting 
requirement but can be critical in creating community support, easing the passage of 
the project through the permitting process, and providing a framework for positive 
relationship throughout the life of the project. 

30.5.2 NON-TRADITIONAL LAND USE 

Based on the limited existing non-traditional land use as well as the relatively short 
temporal scope associated with the proposed project, conflicts between non-
traditional land use and this project are expected to be minimal.  

30.5.3 CONSULTATION 

The consultation process ensures that community members are provided an 
opportunity to understand the project and participate in the project planning, effects 
identification, and the potential formation of mitigations.  These consultation activities 
are a requirement of the proponent for the development of the project proposal in 
advance of the submission to YESAB.  Consultation activities were underway at the 
time of finalization of the Feasibility Study.  

30.5.4 ASSESSMEN T AND PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS 

The project will require an assessment pursuant to the Yukon Environmental and 
Socio-economic Assessment Act and two main permits: a QML and a Type A Water 
Licence; and several ancillary permits.  The QML adheres to the Government of 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 30-8 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Yukon's Quartz Mining Act, and is administered by Government of Yukon's 
Department of Energy, Minerals, and Resources.  The QML is issued in two parts to 
advance non-water related works associated with the project.  No significant 
obstacles are anticipated with the issuance of this licence. 

The second major permit, the Type A Water License, is issued through the Yukon 
Water Board in accordance with the Yukon's Water Act.  The process to obtain this 
permit is not expected to pose a significant hurdle for the project.  

3 0 . 6  T A I L I N G S  D I S P O S A L  

Three tailings disposition systems — conventional, thickened, and dry-stacked —
were considered for use for the Mactung project.  Of the three deposition systems 
dry-stacked tailings was selected for use at the Mactung Mine. 

The DSTF will be constructed from the dewatered tailings, which will be hauled to the 
site using a combination of conveyor belts and haul trucks, spread out into 
maximum 600 mm thick lifts using a bulldozer, and then compacted to 95% of the 
maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D698 using a steel-drum vibratory 
compactor.  The facility will be constructed as a sidehill fill structure with 4H:1V 
slopes.  The facility has been designed to withstand a 1:500 year seismic event.  A 
diversion berm will be required uphill of the facility to direct surface runoff away from 
the tailings, prevent sediment mobilization, and improve stability. 

A dam will be required downstream of the mine footprint to collect surface runoff from 
the tailings facility and to age process water, which will be reused in the mill.  This 
Ravine Dam has been classified into the Significant Consequence Category 
according to the 2007 Canadian Dam Association (CDA, 2007) and was designed 
using the 1:100 year inflow design flood and the 1:1000 year seismic event.

30.7.1 ACCESS ROAD 

Forty-eight kilometres of upgraded/new roads will provide access from the existing 
Upper Canol Road to the mill site.  A road to the pump house at the Hess River 
Tributary C will branch from the main access road.  All access roads will be designed 
for the high snowfall and long winters typical of this area.  

Wardrop evaluated two possible access road routes.  The first option is an 
approximately 25-km route that follows through a narrow valley with steep slopes.  
The second option is an approximately 35-km route through a wider and flatter 
valley.  The second option was selected for its flatter terrain.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 30-9 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The design of the access roads assumed the following: 

• an average vehicle speed of 30 to 50 km/h 

• an overall 8% maximum grade, increasing to 12% grade in some sections 

• a 0.2 m surface of 25 mm crushed gravel/rock 

• an 8 m wide main access road  

• a 5 m wide pumphouse road 

• 1.0 m deep ditch lines 

• 2H:1V cut slopes 

• 3H:1V fill slopes. 

Based on fieldwork conducted in May 2008, it was recommended to undertake a 
follow up assessment of snow melt in the area and to develop a hazard management 
plan for the access road and mine site.  As no avalanche protection was incorporated 
into the road design, subsequent engineering work will plan to re-align the road route 
to minimize potential avalanche hazards. 

30.7.2 AIRSTRIP 

The MacMillan Pass airstrip is reported to be 460 m long by 15 m wide (1,500' x 50').  
The airstrip is owned and maintained by the Government of Yukon.  NATC will 
upgrade and maintain the airstrip during the life of the project.   

The airstrip will be upgraded to 1,375 m long by 30 m wide, to accommodate a 
19-person Beechcraft 1900 or similar aircraft.  A total of 25.4 ha will be cleared 
around the strip to provide the necessary space for the airstrip, apron, and 
obstruction clearances. 

Construction will be a compacted granular sub-base with a crushed rock cover.  
Longitudinal and transverse slopes will be limited to 2%.  The finished elevation of 
the airstrip will be above the flood level of the MacMillan River and, if required, the 
airstrip will be provided with an armoured berm to protect against erosion during river 
flooding. 

The airstrip will be designed for visual flight rules; no runway lights will be provided, 
similar to the operating runway at Cantung Mine.

projections, Wardrop recommends proceeding with basic/detailed engineering, 
procurement, construction, and commissioning to target full production in Q1 2013. 

3 1 . 2  G E O L O G Y  

Scott Wilson RPA makes the following recommendations: 

• Further drilling is required to improve the reliability of the mineral resource 
estimates in the upper 3 zones (3D, 3E, and 3F) as well as on the periphery 
and northerly portions of all zones.  Initial efforts should focus on the areas 
of the deposit where the higher grades have not been entirely closed off by 
peripheral drilling.  Assessments of grade variability indicate a maximum drill 
spacing in the range of 120 m to classify any portion of the resource as 
indicated, although this must be confirmed by further drilling for the upper 3 
zones. 

• Subject to a positive decision to proceed with the EPCM work recommended 
in Section 31.1, a comprehensive delineation drilling program should be 
developed to increase the density of drilling to a nominal 50 m to 60 m 
spacing in that area of the deposit contained in the first 5 years of the mining 
plan.  The program should also serve to provide further delineation of the 
three main faults and "Z-fold" that subdivide the four main zones into 12 
individual lenses.

The following testwork is recommended: 

• Conduct a mineralogical evaluation detailing the relative abundance of 
minerals and the liberation characteristics of scheelite. 

• Characterize the sulphide mineral behaviour during the flotation and 
magnetic separation processes in order to determine the efficiency of these 
processes. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 31-2 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

• The crushability, grinding, and abrasion indices need to be verified in order 
to confirm the crushing and grinding circuit design. 

• The thickening and filtration design parameters of each operation will require 
confirmation. 

• The tailings require full characterization with respect to particle size analysis 
and sulphide mineral content for environmental permitting. 

3 1 . 4  M I N I N G  

Wardrop recommends the following: 

• Investigate the potential for an open pit to mine shallow higher grade ore to 
replace lower grade underground ore towards the tail end of the 
underground mine, which will further enhance project economics. 

• Investigate the potential for an ore pass from the open pit to the 
underground crusher. 

• Conduct geotechnical drilling for the potential open pit in order to collect data 
to incorporate the open pit with the underground mine during detailed 
engineering.   

31.4.1 GEOTECHNICAL 

Although initial estimates of rock mass quality indicate good ground conditions, 
detailed geotechnical drill information and data collection is required on the main 
infrastructure to make a more complete evaluation.  Additional geotechnical drill 
holes are recommended to better define the rock mass quality surrounding major 
infrastructure and to determine the conditions of major faulting. 

Wardrop recommends the installation of ground support in all permanent openings 
as the support guarantees safety of workers, equipment, and major infrastructure 
and to avoid the potential of future rehabilitation due to deteriorating ground 
conditions.  The permafrost condition of the mine is reported to be marginal. 

Ground movement monitoring is recommended so that the support system and its 
requirements can be optimized using the experience obtained during operations.   

It is recommended that stope back (roof) of 17 m wide be supported with cable bolts 
to support possible wedges formed in the back.  This enables production drilling and 
blasting activities to be performed under support ground conditions.  The supported 
back also reduces additional dilution from the back. 

The mining of the Upper and Lower 2B Zone is recommended from the bottom up 
(from lower to upper) when favourable higher grade is encountered in the lower 
panel.  The thickness of the waste rock in between the Upper and Lower 2B Zone is

Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

recommended to be greater than 15 m for mining from top to bottom.  Additional 
numerical modelling in 3D is recommended to define the extraction sequence and 
pillar dimension in detail.  During the geotechnical drill investigation, it is 
recommended to test samples of cores for engineering properties to increase the 
accuracy of the numerical modelling. 

Wardrop supports Amax (1984) recommendations in that additional studies and test 
work be conducted to determine the extent of permafrost.  Sprayed-on liners or 
foams are recommended to be applied on frozen faults to provide an insulation 
blanket and as a support component.  On site investigations on the types of liners or 
foam are recommended to be performed on site. 

A detailed investigation of the site's permafrost conditions will provide information 
essential to reinforce the mine design parameters.  This will allow confirmation of 
dewatering requirements and provide additional fill strength if conditions are 
favourable to freezing.   

Testing is recommended to confirm the percolation rate of the mill tailings to ensure 
that the backfill drains at the percolation rate above 10 cm/h. 

Underground testing of frozen, treated mill tailings is recommended once the mine is 
in operation to determine moisture content, the time required to freeze treated mill 
tailings, and frozen fill strength.  The technology of frozen fill research is currently 
being performed, which will assist Mactung in defining the mix design, moisture 
content, and conditions.  Cooled intake air (ice house) may be required during the 
summer months to counterbalance heat generated from the equipment, personnel, 
blasting, and air intake to maintain freezing conditions underground. 

Detailed investigation on the tailings backfill will be conducted prior to detailed 
engineering to have a better understanding of permafrost at Mactung.  To be 
included in the investigation as earlier noted will be the percolation tests for drainage 
to meet or exceed the 10 cm/h rate. 

31.4.2 MINE VENTILATION 

Regular monitoring of air quality is mandatory and should follow the rules and 
regulations of the Yukon Territory.  Regular measurements of air quality, air volume, 
speed, and gaseous contaminants should be included in the mine safety and 
standard procedures and should be meticulously followed. 

The fumes from blasting operations must be cleared before production and activity 
resumes in mining heading.  Calculations need to be undertaken to provide clearing 
delay times for smoke and fumes produced at the production level by excessive 
mobile equipment activity or production blasting.   



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 31-4 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

A higher air velocity is required to clear the air.  Two strategies that may be 
considered to clear the air in the headings are to: 

• Reverse the fan direction so the negative pressure created removes the 
fumes and smoke. 

• Push the air towards the headings using local utility fans so the fumes can 
travel to the exhaust ramp.  

The ventilation system should be modelled in case of fire in several key locations and 
several remote locations in the mine.  This can be done by introducing a constant 
source of smoke into the model.

EBA makes the following recommendations: 

• Surficial Geology/Soil: 

q More information would be required on the surficial geology and soil for 
the mine access road from the North Canol Road to the mine site.   

• Water Quality and Hydrogeology: 

q Groundwater information to be collected at the site will aid in determining 
the quality and quantity of potential groundwater inflow to underground 
workings; and the potential impact to groundwater and surface water 
from proposed mining activities. 

• Climate and Air Quality: 

q The use of adequately insulated or heat-traced water lines will need to 
be installed as appropriate to mitigate risks to water lines due to cold 
winter temperatures.  Utilidors and covered passageways between 
buildings will be installed to minimize the exposure of personnel to the 
adverse winter conditions. 

• Environmental Health and Aesthetics: 

q Health and safety issues related to cold temperatures for mine operation 
personnel will be mitigated through development of operational 
procedures.

31.6.1 ACCESS ROAD 

Particular attention will be given to vertical grades at the next stage of the project 
provided that detailed survey, geotechnical, etc. information will be available. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 31-5 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

Building roads along sloping terrain such as along the mountain sides involves cut-
and-fill excavation.  Cut-and-fill quantities for the Mactung project will be minimized 
by making the best possible use of the existing ground contours.  This will require the 
most accurate contour information possible during the more detailed design phases. 

Wardrop recommends that the Civil/Transportation team undertake a site visit as 
early as possible prior to the design process.  The purpose of the site visit is for the 
designer to familiarize him/herself with the area and get first-hand knowledge about 
the site and ground level terrain issues.  The overall site visit could be from a 
helicopter but ground access whenever possible, in the vicinity of streams and rivers, 
environmentally sensitive areas, or areas deemed to have design/constructability 
issues, would help in putting together a much more accurate overall picture of the 
site/project and its design and constructability issues.  Wardrop also recommends 
that a road building company with extensive expertise in northern resource road 
development be involved in the design process.  

Ground work for terrain mapping took place in July 2008.  Large scale aerial 
photography is required to complete terrain mapping, hazard mapping and to identify 
and delineate sources of suitable granular materials for road construction.  This 
baseline information is critical to determine a favourable road alignment based on 
grade, surficial material, drainage, proximity to suitable borrow sources, terrain 
hazards, favourable stream crossings and potential for permafrost. 

The need for truck escape ramps will have to be evaluated during more detailed 
design phases for sections of the road with long descending grades. 

Wardrop will work closely with the Regulatory and Environmental team in the early 
stages of the initial permitting schedule.  Necessary permits and 
authorizations/approvals as well as environmental requirements will have to be 
communicated to Wardrop prior to undertaking the design. 

It is anticipated that borrow pit(s) will be required throughout the project area.  
Special consideration will have to be given related to location, sediment control, and 
drainage. 

A detailed geotechnical assessment is required to determine ground support and to 
optimize ground support for road design.  The assessment will include the 
identification of permafrost and muskeg areas so that these can be avoided in the 
route alignment.  

Field investigation and sub-base and base foundation characteristics (e.g. soil 
classification, California Bearing Ratio) are required prior to the preliminary design 
stage.  A site investigation to identify suitable borrow sources for road construction 
materials is also required in the next phase. 

Collection of LiDAR survey information is considered to be necessary in order to 
obtain adequate surface model data for further detailed design.  This task is very 
important and it is critical to meet the project deadlines.  Wardrop recommends 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 31-6 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

engaging a consultant for this process as early as possible to ensure sufficient time 
to complete all the design tasks before construction. 

A ground survey is required to obtain cross-sections along the proposed centerline of 
the bridges and crossings and the respective approaches starting 50 m from each 
end.  A ground survey also needs to be conducted to obtain cross sections at 
approximately 10 m intervals, up and down stream of the crossings for at least 25 m 
both sides, and centerline, including depth sounds and bottom profiles if possible. 

A water management plan to control erosion and sedimentation will be needed in 
order to prevent the loss of soil and reduce the possibility of slope failure.  The water 
management plan will also be used to maintain water quality and aquatic habitat in 
downstream water bodies and riparian areas. 

Hydrological inspections and recommendations will be required for stream/river 
crossings. 

The side slopes of the road are subject to adjustments, depending on the results of 
assessing terrain stability, terrain stability hazards, and snow avalanche hazards. 

Regular road maintenance activities will be necessary and are anticipated to consist 
of practices such as: 

• annual (or more frequent) surface grading and spot-resurfacing where 
required 

• snow ploughing and sanding during the winter 

• inspection and maintenance of culverts and ditches where required.  The 
thawing of ice in culverts during spring will be required to prevent streams 
from cutting through the road before the culverts thaw. 

Larger occasional maintenance activities such as local slope stabilization or erosion 
control projects may be necessary due to unusual weather, unforeseen subsoil 
conditions, or other factors. 

Upon completion of mining activities it is anticipated that the access road may have 
to be deactivated and restored to a more natural condition.  Activities to be 
undertaken are expected to include the removal of all culverts and bridges, the 
restoration of natural drainage patterns where necessary, and resloping, scarification 
and revegetation of the access road surface. 

31.6.2 AIRSTRIP 

In order to proceed with the next phase of the airstrip design, hydrology input is 
required to determine the risk of flooding from the adjacent stream, and riprap design 
will be required if flooding is an issue. 



 
 

 North American Tungsten Corporation Ltd. 31-7 1053390100-REP-R0001-00 
Amended Technical Report on the Mactung Property   
 

The airstrip will also be designed to avoid permafrost and muskeg areas. 

A detailed topographic survey of the existing airstrip and surrounding area is also 
required, as well as a geotechnical investigation.  However, four test pits along the 
length of the runway are anticipated to be sufficient.
