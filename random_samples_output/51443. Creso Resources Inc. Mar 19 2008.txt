Attention: Stuart Lee 
 
Dear StuartSirs: 
 

Luisha Copper-Cobalt Project 
 
Attached please find our report on the Luisha copper-cobalt project in the Central African 
Copperbelt of Katanga Province, DRC.  The Luisha permit is in a favourable geological location 
in Roan Supergroup sediments, between the CIMCO and Kipoi projects, and its prospectivity is 
demonstrated by the artisanal mining of high-grade oxide copper ore from the pit that took place 
before the deal between Creso and TSM became effective.  The results of a few trench samples 
from the pit confirm copper and cobalt values over significant widths in calcareous siltstones, 
which are probably part of the Mines GroupDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  High-grade 
copper-cobalt ore was mined from a pit on the property by Union Minière du Haute Katanga 
(UMHK) in 1938_39, in connection with mining of a larger deposit to the northwest.   A total of 
some 230 000 tonnes of ore was removed by UMHK and possibly later by Gécamines and 
others from the pit on the Creso property.  The deposits were known as "Luishia" (the main 
deposit) and "Luishia Sud" (the deposit on Creso's Luisha property) when they were mined by 
UMHK.  Following  the spelling in legal documents, "Luisha" is used in this report when 
reference is made to the Creso project.  
     
The Luisha pit area has potential for a small remnant tonnage of oxide copper-cobalt ore, but 
the main economic target is sulphide mineralization below the pit, which was not part of the drill-
evaluation by UMHK in 1923-28.  The exploration potential of the permit outside of the pit will 
depend on the presence of the principal stratigraphic units carrying copper-cobalt mineralization 
in the region being present, and should be tested with geological, geochemical and geophysical 
methods.  Those prospective stratigraphic units are generally dolomitic shales and schists, and 
siliceous dolomites within the Roan Group, that is the host for most of the copper-cobalt 
mineralization in the Central African Copperbelt both in Zambia and the Congo. 
 
The waste from the Luisha pit, about 350 000 tonnes, consists of overburden and bedrock 
fragments, and contains copper and cobalt in small quantities which may allowwarrant  
processing of the material, once the economics have been confirmed by sampling and 
metallurgical testwork.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting project and we wish you success with 
the exploration of the Luisha property. 
           
Yours sincerely,

1. SUMMARY 

Creso Resources Inc. (Creso) has retained Strathcona Mineral Services Limited 
(Strathcona) to provide a technical report on the Luisha copper-cobalt (Cu-Co) project 
in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that would 
fulfill the requirements of National Instrument 43-101.   

The Luisha property (Figure 1) includes an old small open pit (Plates 1-3, Appendix 
I) and waste pile and is underlain by Roan SupergGroup sediments which host major 
copper-cobalt deposits in the Central African Copper belt of Zambia and the DRC.  
The project is between the CIMCO Luisha project to the northeast, with a quoted, but 
unconfirmed resource of 50 million tonnes of 2.1% Cu and 0.1% Coa property (the 
former UMHK Luishia mine) held by Congo International Mining Corporation (CIMCO) 
to the northwest, and the Kipoi Cu-Co exploration project of Tiger Resources with 
very encouraging drill resultsLimited to the southeast.  Although no drilling has been 
carried out on the property yet, there is geological and assay information which will 
be used to raise funds for the exploration of the property, and hence the description 
of the property and work to date in this report follows the NI 43-101 format. 

Creso has acquired a 60% interest in the Luisha Cu-Co project in July of 2007, by 
signing an agreement with TSM Entreprise SPRL (TSM) of Lubumbashi, the capital 
of Katanga Province.  The Luisha permit PEPM 4881 consists of 20 parcels of land 
with an area of 16.2 km2, located 80 kilometres northwest of Lubumbashi (Figure 2). 
The permit is valid for five years to 2011, and allows for small-scale mining on the 
property.  On October 5, 2007, the permit has beenwas transferred to Luisha Mining 
Entreprise SPRL, a company formed by Creso and TSM to operate the Luisha project 
(Appendix II).  Before the joint venture was formed, artisanal miners extracted  high-
grade oxide copper ore from anthe existing pit, with the ore treated at TSM's smelter 
in Lubumbashi.  

The LuishaCreso has been notified that a boarding school, operated by Franciscan 
nuns and located on the permit 300 metres west of the Luisha pit (and 400 metres 
south of the CIMCO pit), is objecting to exploration and mining being carried out in 
the area.  Creso is in negotiations with the school and different levels of government 
to resolve this matter.  

Records obtained by Creso in archives in Belgium indicate that the pit on the Creso-
TSM permit was part of the "Luishia-Kamwali" mining operation of l'Union Minière du 
Haut Katanga (UMHK), and was known as the "Luishia Sud" deposit.  The main 



 2 

Luishia orebody, situated on the property now controlled by CIMCO, was mined by 
open pit methods by UMHK between 1913 and 1939.  It produced a total of 4.1 
million tonnes of Cu-Co oxide ore with an average grade of 8.3% Cu, with a minor 
portion of this tonnage coming from other small deposits in the area.  A cut-off grade 
of 5% (later 4%) Cu was used.  In 1940, the mine reported remaining reserves of 1.8 
million tonnes of oxides with a grade of 10.1% Cu, and 6.7 million tonnes of sulphides 
with a grade of 2.6% Cu.   

The Luishia Sud orebody (Figure 4, Figure 5), was explored by geophysical 
(electromagnetic) methods, drilling, and some shafts and tunnels between 1923 and 
1928, and a small portion of the deposit was mined in 1938-39.  The bulk of the 
deposit must have been mined later, either by UMHK or Gécamines, but the available 
records do not include information  past 1942.  Luishia Sud had a pre-production 
oxide reserve (indicated by drilling) of 230 000 t with a grade of 10% Cu, using a cut-
off of 3% Cu. An additional 120 000 t with a grade of 6% Cu was in the probable and 
possible categories.  In 1942, remaining reserves at Luishia Sud quoted by UMHK 
and based on estimates from January 1940, were 203 000 tonnes at 10.1% Cu.  
Luishia and Luishia Sud were described as being unique among other UMHK mines, 
due to the presence of a rather thick layer of sulphide minerals below the water table. 
The UMHK drill holes show Luishia Sud hosted by Roan Group sediments, which are 
bordered on three sides by breccia.  On a regional scale, Roan Group is separated 
from younger Nguba sediments by a breccia (diamictite) known as "Grand 
Conglomérat" or "Conglomérat base" (Figure 3).  

The current Luisha (previously Luishia Sud) pit has a size of approximately 250 by 80 
by 30 metres in depth (Figure 36), and exposes steep southwesterly dipping Roan 
SupergGroup siltstones and carbonates, with Cu-Co mineralization as malachite and 
heterogenite in calcareous siltstone and silicified carbonates, locally with high 
concentrations of malachite crusts on bedrock, the target of the artisanal mining 
activities (Plates 4-8).  With the exception of short adits in the pit dug by the locals, 
Creso has no records of previous exploration on the property, which probably had 
been part of the larger Luisha property owned by Gécamines.     

Excavator sampling by Strathcona on the property in June 2007(Figure 47, Plates 9-
11) and assaying of samples at SGS Mineral Services in Toronto, indicates that a 
waste pile adjacent to the Luisha pit contains some 350 000 tonnes of mixed 
overburden and bedrock from the pit, with an average grade of approximately 0.6% 
Cu and 0.3% Co. The grade distribution is not homogenous with pits mainly in 



 3 

overburden material having low grades, while pits in waste from bedrock have higher 
copperCu and cobaltCo values. We caution, that because of the mixture of sand-size 
to cobble-size material in the pile, the channel samples may not represent the 
material properly and the assays should only be taken as indications of grade, and 
are probably within 20% of the true values.  The same applies to two trench channel 
samples taken by Strathcona from the bottom of the existing pit, with grades of 3.2 
and 5% Cu and 0.60 and 0.16% Co respectively.   

The Luisha permit covers some 4.5 kilometres of the Roan SupergGroup trend 
favourable for Cu-Co mineralization, but due to the lack of outcrop on the property, 
and no. With drill information, the distribution and nature of rocks on the permit 
outside of the pit is unknown.   

The property, and particularly the projected location of Roan sediments between the 
Luisha pit and the Judeira occurrence on the Kipoi property, available for the pit area 
only, information on the geology of the remaining permit is based on the Élisabethville 
geology sheet from 1925, which shows Roan Group ("Système schisto-dolomitique-
cherteux") to continue from Luishia to the southeast to Juidera, Kipoi and Kileba 
(Figure 3). 

The permit should be examined by geological mapping, geochemical sampling and 
geophysical surveying, with the objective to delineate Roan Group sediments, which 
may host mineralization similar to Luisha.  Drilling of initially about 30002000 to 2500 
metres should be completed at and near the Luisha pit, and a provision of 2000 
metres of drilling is made for the remaining permit area.  Bulk sampling of the waste 
pile and of loose material in the pit is planned, and metallurgical testwork to 
determine the suitability of the waste material for acid leaching.  Plants should be 
located,identified that could process the waste pile material if economic to do so.   

Exploration costs in the DRC are high, and the budget for the first phase of work is 
estimated at US$2.5 million.  If warranted by the results of this work, more drilling, 
bulk sampling and metallurgical and geotechnical work is planned during a second 
phase, which is also estimated at US$2.5 million, for a total of US$5.0 million for the 
two phases. 

Since the formal end of civil war in the DRC in 2003, the Katanga portion of the 
Central African Copperbelt of Katanga has seen a large influx ofrise in foreign 
investmentmining activities, with many deposits being developed or explored by 
mining companies from North America, Australia and China.  There are shortages of 



 4 

qualified professionals, and for exploration services in general, but particularly for 
drilling services.  The DRC hasintroduced a new mining lawcode in July 2002, but 
other areas of law need to be improved, and a large political risk remains for 
investments in the country.  A government commission is currently reviewing all.  A 
review of 61 contracts entered into by DRC-controlled mining companies, 
includingmainly Gécamines, has been initiated by a government commission in 
October 2007, and is still ongoing.  Tiger Resources have reported that their Kipoi 
project is included in this review.  The review, and continuing tensions in the eastern 
part of the country, are indications that a large political risk remains for investments in 
the DRC.

2. INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

In July 2007, Creso Resources Inc. (Creso) signed an agreement with TSM 
Entreprise SPRL of Lubumbashi, Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC) to acquire a 60-percent interest in the Luisha copper-cobalt project, 
located 80 kilometres northwest of Lubumbashi, for a consideration of US$2 000 000.  
The project comprises a small open pit and adjacent waste pile next to a larger open 
pit owned by a Chinese-DRC joint venture (CIMCO), both pits having originally been 
mined by l'Union Minière du Haute-Katanga (UMHK) and/orand probably later by La 
Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines). The pits lay dormant until about 
2002, when the government allowed artisanal miners to extract ore from the pits.  
Until Luisha Mining Entreprise SPRL was formed, TSM bought high-grade oxide 
copper (malachite) ore from local miners from the Luisha pit (Plate 6).  TSM is still 
buying malachite ore from similar artisanal operations elsewhere, and is processing 
the ore at a smelter in Lubumbashi with a capacity of seven tonnes copper metal per 
day (Plate 11).   

Creso and TSM have formed a joint venture company, Luisha Mining Enterprise 
SPRL, which will be the vehicle for planned exploration programs on the property.  

Creso has retained Strathcona Mineral Services Limited (Strathcona) to review the 
Luisha project, and provide a technical report that would that would fulfill the 
requirements of National Instrument 43-101.  Reinhard von Guttenberg of Strathcona 
has visited the project from June 28 to July 2, 2007 and has sampled trenches in the 
pit and on the waste pile.  These samples were shipped to Canada and assayed by 
SGS Minerals Services in Toronto. 

 

3. DISCLAIMER 

Our A report by Strathcona released in October 2007 had to be revised after historical   
property information was discovered by Creso in archives in Belgium in late-
2007.   

 

3. RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 



 7 

This report is based on the observations and assay results from samples 
takensampling during the visit to the property, on reports by UMHK on Luishia-
Kamwali and Luishia Sud from 1937 and 1942 respectively, and on gpublically 
available information. General geological information was obtained previously by 
Strathcona previously, from the reviews of two copper-cobalt deposits in the Central 
African Copperbelt of Katanga (Tenke-Fungurume and Kabolela).  The tenure 
information received from Creso, and other legal information including the right to 
explore and mine on permit PEPM No. 4881 has not been independently confirmed 
by Strathcona. 

4. Since the formal end of civil war in the DRC in 2003, the Katanga portion of the 
Central African Copperbelt has seen a large rise in foreign mining activities, 
aided also by the new mining code of July 2002.  The tensions that continue in 
the eastern part of the country, and the recent review of mining contracts by 
the government indicate that there remains a considerable risk to investments 
in the DRC.4. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 

The Luisha property is centred at 27Ε 01'E and 11Ε 11' S, in Kambove Territory, 
Haut-Katanga District, Katanga Province, DRC, 75 kilometres northwest of 
Lubumbashi, the capital of Katanga Province and the second largest city in the DRC 
(Figure 1). The property consists of 20 parcels of land with a total area of 16.2 km2, 
which form the Permis d'Exploitation de la Petite Mine (small-scale mining 
exploitation licence)  PEPM No. 4881 (Table 1, Figure 2).  The permit has been 
issued to TSM Entreprise SPRL under law No. 007/2002 of July 11, 2002 of the 
Mining Code, and is valid from March 22, 2006 to March 21, 2011, and allows 
extraction of copper, cobalt and zinc, and of other minerals upon application.  On 
October 5, 2007, the permit was transferred to Luisha Mining Entreprise SPRL 
(Appendix II).

Conditions for the Small-Scale Mining Exploitation Licence are in Chapter V of law 
No. 007/2002 007/2002, and include the right to transform the licence into an 

exploitation licence if the technical conditions justify or warrant it. The term of the 
licence may not exceed 10 years. 

End Of Moved Text 

A large boarding school, founded in the 1950's, and operated by Franciscan nuns, is 
located on the permit 300 metres west of the Luisha pit, and 400 metres south of the 
CIMCO pit.  The school is objecting to exploration and mining being carried out in the 

area, which affects both the Creso-TSM permit and the CIMCO operation.  Creso is 
in negotiations with the school and different levels of government to resolve this 

matter.

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Luisha property can be reached by 80 kilometres of paved highway (Route 
Nationale No.1) from Lubumbashi and six kilometres of dirt road from the village of 
Bungubungu. The village of Luisha borders on the property and on the adjacent 
CIMCO property.  The narrow-track national railway crosses the Luisha property in its 
northeast corner, and a high-voltage power line of the national grid crosses the permit 
area within 500 metres of the Creso-TSM Luisha pit. 

Luisha is at an elevation of about 1270 metres, in an area of wooded savannah 
(Miombo forest), consisting of plains and undulating tree-covered low hills.  The area 
near the pit is flat and covered by brush and open forest, except near the village and 
the former mines, where the land has been cleared through human activities.  

Katanga Province has a sub-tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 32ΕC in 

October to an average of 25ΕC  in July. Annual rainfall averages 1200 mm with peak 
intensities of 30 mm/hr over short periods of time during the rainy season which 
extends from October to March. The dry season at Luisha lasts from April to early 

November, with lowest temperatures of 8-11ΕC in June-July, and highest 

temperatures of 34-37ΕC in September-October.  Winds are normally light and from 
the north or northeast during the dry season changing to west to southwesterly winds 
during the wet season. 

 

6. HISTORY 

Copper ornaments recovered from 1300-year-old burial sites demonstrate that mining 
and processing of copper in the Central African Copperbelt took place long before the 
arrival of Europeans in Africa.  Geological studies in the Copperbelt date back to 
1892 (Francois, 2006), and copper deposits were first reported by Tanganyika 
Concessions Limited in 1904, whose land holdings, granted by Belgium, measured 
over 150 000 km2  (Nilsson et al, 2006).  Starting in 1906, l'Union Minière du Haute-
Katanga (UMHK), explored the copper belt through underground workings and drill 
holes, and this work was later continued by Gécamines in 1967, after the Congo 
became independent.  Following the discoveries of copper deposits, Elizabethville 
(Lubumbashi) received rail service in 1910, when the first industrial copper production 
took place in Katanga. Since 



 11 

UMHK mined the 1930's copper production from mines in the copper belt of Zambia 
and the DRC has often exceeded one million tonnes copper per year and has 
consistently produced in excess of 600 000 tonnes of copper per year (Nilsson et al, 
2006). 

Although information on past operations is unavailable to Creso, it is likely that 
Gécamines isLuishia Cu-Co deposit (situated on the CIMCO property) and the 
Luishia Sud Cu-Co deposit (on the Creso-TSM permit) between 1913 and 1939, and 
possibly later, together with other smaller orebodies in the area (UMHK report of 
March 1942).  A description of the geology of the deposits and their mining history is 
contained in Section 7.2, Local Geology and Mineralization.  We are not in 
possession of records on mining and exploration at Luisha.  The 2003 USGS Mineral 
Yearbook (The Mineral Industry of Congo (Kinshasa)), lists Luisha as a copper-cobalt 
mine owned by Gécamines.  This is probably a reference to the CIMCO-controlled 
part of records for the Luisha deposit, and may or may not include the Creso-TSM 
portion.  The sources of information listed by the USGS publication include 
Gécamines, and the Ministère de Mines and the Cadastre Minier (mining recorder) in 
Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC.

An Australian junior mining company, Tiger Resources Limited, in a joint venture 
which includes Gécamines, areis exploring for copper-cobaltCu-Co 12 kilometres 
southeast of Luisha, and show Luisha on location maps to contain 50 million tonnes 
of 2.1% Cu and 0.1% Co. 

 

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology and Mineralization  

Luisha is one of many Cu-Co deposits hosted by the Central African Copperbelt in 
the Lufilian Arc, a 500-kilometre fold belt extending from Kolwezi in southern Katanga 
Province to Luanshya in north-central Zambia. The belt is estimated to contain a 
global resource of more than five billion tonnes of copper ore with grades up to 4%, 
and about 40% of the world's resource base of cobalt (Robb, 2005).  Most of the ore 
deposits within the copper belt occur within Neoproterozoic sediments of the Katanga 
Seriesn Supergroup in the Katanga Basin, which developed on a Paleoproterozoic 
basement, with an age of 2100 to 1900 million years.  The sediments have ages  



 12 

between 880 and 500 million years.  Katanga SeriesKatangan sediments were 
intruded by gabbros and granites dated at about 750 and 500 million years 
respectively, and the basin was deformed during a major orogenic event known as 
the Lufilian Orogeny with its maximum about 600 to 500560-550 million years ago. 

The Katanga Series consist of the Roan Supergroup and the Lower and Upper  
Kundelungu Supergroups.   The Roan Supergroupsupracrustal sedimentary 
succession is approximately 5-10 kilometres thick and is commonly sub-divided into 
three major lithostratigraphic units: Roan, Nguba (previously Lower Kundelungu) and 
Kundelungu (previously Upper Kundelungu) Groups (Cailteux et al., 2005).  The 
groups are separated by diamictites at the base of the Nguba ("Grand Conglomérat") 
and at the base of the Kundelungu ("Petit Conglomérat"). 

The Roan Group (Table 2) has a total thickness of probably more than 1500 metres 
(François, 2006), and comprises a series of detrital and shallow marine sediments 
deposited in settings ranging from continental rift basins, to intra-cratonic shallow 
marine platforms (Nofal et al., 2007).  Two major transgressions have been 
documented. The first commenced with the deposition of the RAT Group (R1) and 
ended with the Mines Group (R2).  The second started with the Dipeta Group (R3) 
and ended with the Mwashya Group (R4).  The stratiform Cu-Co deposits occur atIt 
includes mafic volcanic and intrusive rocks in continental rift basins.  The Nguba 
supracrustal assemblage is made up of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks 
and includes mafic igneous rocks emplaced in a proto-oceanic rift similar to the Red 
Sea.  Kundelungu sedimentary rocks represent syn- to post-orogenic sedimentary 
deposits (Cailteux et al., 2005). The Nguba and Kundelungu groups vary in thickness 
from 630 metres in the north to 3500 metres in the south.

the base of the Mines Group.  The Roan Group sediments were deposited in a 
lagoonal environment, whichTwo major transgressions have been documented for 
the Roan Group. The first commenced with the deposition of the RAT Subgroup (R1) 
and ended with the Mines Subgroup (R2).  The second started with the Dipeta 
Subgroup (R3) and ended with the Mwashya Subgroup (R4).  Stratiform Cu-Co 
deposits occur in the Mines Subgroup, and locally in the Mwashya Sub-group.  
During the deposition of the Roan Group, conditions changed from oxidizing 
conditions at its base (R1) to mostly reducing conditions higher up (R2 to R4).  
The Kundelungu Supergroups comprise partly oxidized and partly reduced shallow 
marine  sediments, with some dolomitic and calcareous horizons, and vary in 
thickness from 630 metres in the north to 3500 metres in the south. 
The Katanga Seriesn Supergroup underwent two main orogenic phases, resulting in 
folds overturned to the north, and north-oriented thrusting creating numerous thrust-
slices during the Kolwezian event. During the Kundelungian phase, thrusting was 
oriented southward, and folds overturned to the south (François 2006).  Large strike-
parallel faults, which originated after each phase of folding in the KundelunguNguba-
Kundelungu sediments, expose uplifted Roan sediments.  In anticlinal axis, at the 
base of thrusts and in uplifts, the Roan exhibits "megabreccias" with locally very long 
fragments of R2 and R3 in a matrix of brecciated R1 or R3 sandstone.  These 
"megabreccias" have recently been interpreted as syntectonic conglomerates 
deposited in basins that propagated to the north (Wendorff, 2005).  Following this

interpretation the RAT and Dipeta Groups contain carbonate-clast conglomerates in 
addition to the rocks shown in Table 2.  Gaps at certain intervals of the Roan 
sequence may have been caused by dissolution of evaporites.   
The Roan in the DRC has generally been considered to be allochthonous, moved 
along thrust faults from the south.  It is lithologically similar to autochthonous and 
stratigraphically intact Roan SupergGroup in Zambia (Wendorff, 2005).  

 All of the Significant stratiform Cu-Co deposits ofin the Copperbelt occur  
stratigraphically below the  Grand Conglomérat, which is interpreted as a glacial 
till, deposited during one of at least two glacial periods in the Neoproterozoic.  It has 
recently been suggested that reducing conditions necessary for the formation of the 
Cu-Co deposits may have existed during these periods, caused by the blanket ice 
coverage which isolated the underlying rocks from atmospheric oxygen (Robb, 2005). 
SThe stratiform Cu-Co deposits, which form the most important ore type in the 
Copperbelt, and have long been considered to be of syngenetic or early-diagenetic 
origin, since they pre-date the period of major deformation.  Recent work suggests 
that deposition of metals may have occurred after the sediments were lithified, during 
subsequent tectonism and deformation.  Independent of the theories of origin, the 
stratiform nature of the Cu-Co mineralization on a small and also on a regional scale, 
indicates that syngenetic processes played an important role in the formation of the 
deposits.    
Copper-cobalt mineralization at Tenke-Fungurume is found in dolomitic shale 
horizons RSF and SDB, ranging in thickness from 5-15 metres, and separated by 20 
metres of silicified dolostone (RSC).  At Kabolela mineralization is mainly 
concentrated in RSF (10 m) and RSC (20 m).  Tiger Resources shows Cu-Co 
mineralization to occur in a horizon of Roan sediments within the Kundelungu 
Supergroup(Nguba) Group, forming a northeasterly trending anticline which is 
terminated to the north by a northwest-southeast striking fault. 
Mines in the Copperbelt have traditionally exploited the oxide zones of deposits, with 
depths at some of the deposits varying between 40 metres at Kabolela, 75-125 
metres  at Tenke-Fungurume, and locally over 150 metres at the Kipoi exploration 
project of Tiger Resources, 12 kilometres southeast of Luisha.  The oxide zone is 
separated from deeper sulphides by a mixed oxide-sulphide zone, with contacts 
between the zones transitional and often blurred.  At Luisha, oxidation reaches to a 
minimum of 30 metres below surface. 
The primary copper sulphide minerals include chalcopyrite CuFeS2, bornite Cu5FeS4, 
chalcocite Cu2S, and digenite Cu9S5, and the cobalt minerals carrollite CuCo2S4  and 



 15 

siegenite (Co,Ni)3S4.  Minerals in the oxidation zone include malachite Cu2CO3(OH)2, 

pseudomalachite Cu5(PO4)2(OH)4∀H2O, chrysocolla Cu2H2(Si2O5)(OH)4 and the 
cobalt mineral heterogenite CoO(OH).  

 
7.2 Local Geology and Mineralization  

In the geological description of the central part of the Katanga Copperbelt published  
by Armand François in 2006, the Luishia area is shown at the southeast end of the 
Luishia thrust slice or nappe ("Le chevauchement de Luishia"), which extends the 
Kambove nappe 40 kilometres to the southeast. The Roan megabreccia on the 
southern limb of the Luisha nappe is thrust over the Upper KundelunguNguba-
Kundelungu on its north limb. Francois limits his description of mineralized areas in 

the Luisha nappe to the area west of 27Ε East, just west of the Luisha deposit. 

An interpretation of the geology in the pit on the TSM permit is shown in Figure 3, 
and is based on observations during the site visit and information from TSM 
geologists.  The rock units in the pit (Plates 1-3) strike.  The geology of the Luisha 
area is shown on Figure 3. 
Information on the Luisha deposits ("Luishia" and "Luishia-Sud"), was found by Creso 
in archives in Belgium in late-2007. Luishia refers to the deposit on the property 
currently owned by CIMCO, and Luishia Sud to the area of the pit on permit PEPM 
No. 4881.  The original spelling "Luishia" is used in the descriptions below. 
Luishia Deposit  
The  history, geology and production of the Luishia deposit is contained in a report by 
UMHK of March 1942 (in French), and the following is summarized from this report. 



 16

Luishia is part of a thrust sheet of "terrains anciens" (Roan Group except Mwashya) 
with a northwest-southeast and dip steeplyextension of 12.5 kilometres and a 
maximum width of 2.5 kilometres.  The sheet is bounded by faults  which separate it 
from Kundelungu to the northeast and Mwashya to the southwest. They come to 
surface on the northeast side of the pit (where the deposit was likely discovered in 
outcrop) while they are buried under about 30 metres of overburden on its opposite 
side.  The area near the pit is flat and without outcrop exposure. 
A silicified vuggy carbonate horizon, about one metre thick and identified as part of  
"RAT" by the TSM geologists, forms the northeast wall of the pit.  This unit carries 
locally high-grade Cu-Co, at the southern margin of a regional anticline.  The 
northern fault dips 45 degrees to the southwest and could be observed in the Luishia 
pits. The southern fault is marked by outcrops of breccia.   



 17

 18

The Mines Group at Luishia consists of crystalline dolostone, talc schists and 
tectonic breccias, assembled as dislocated folded and faulted fragments.  Compared 
to other deposits mined by UMHK in Katanga at that time, Luishia was described as 
having a higher metamorphic grade, and a relatively thin oxide zone.  The more 
siliceous members of the Mines Group form rare outcrops in the area.  The report 
notes that it is not possible to establish the pre-deformation relations of the different 
fragments, with harder rocks embedded in more plastic rocks, forming the matrix of 
this giant breccia.  The variable strikes of the strata make it difficult to predict 
extensions of existing deposits.  The anticipated depth continuity of less disturbed 
units could not be confirmed in a deep drill hole at Luishia. Carbonaceous 
metasediments and BOMZ (Black Ore Mineralized Zone, part of SD Formation) are 
well represented at Luishia, while the RSC is lenticular.  
The Luishia deposit has a north-south strike length of 1100 metres and an average 
width of 50 metres.  Copper and cobalt oxide minerals (presumably confined to the 
layer above the water table, which reaches 30 metres depth at the north end of the 
deposit and 42 metres at its south end, where the surface is 12 metres higher), are 
underlain by a layer of sulphide minerals, which is about 40 metres thick, and has an 
average grade of 2-3% Cu, with some enrichment at the base. The transition 
between sulphides and oxides is abrupt, with hardly any mixed minerals.  The 
UMHK report describes this layer of sulphides as being remarkable, and it is noted 
that Luishia is the first deposit in Katanga where Cu-sulphides had been reported, 
and where chalcopyrite vein-type mineralization (Plate exists.  A one-metre-thick 
chalcopyrite vein which occupies a transverse fault proved that mineralization took 
place after the emplacement of the thrust slice.  Most of the copper is in siliceous 
rocks, the BOMZ and dolomite schist, with the latter having large amounts of low-
grade mineralization. Strong concentrations of malachite were found at the two ends 
of the deposit.  Uranium minerals (altered pitchblende) occur with Cu-sulphides in 
discontinuous veinlets. 
Luishia was first visited by Europeans in 1883, with exploration starting in 1902. The 
area of the deposit lacked vegetation, and had artisanal workings like other nearby 
Cu-deposits and occurrences.  Four pits at the deposit were intermittently mined 
between 1913 and 1939, with most of the ore extracted and shipped between 1927-
1930 and 1937-1939.  The production was supplemented from other small deposits 
in the area, including Kamwali and Luishia-Sud.  Mining was by steam and electric 
shovels, and high-grade ore was mined by hand.  The ore was shipped to 
Elisabethville (Lubumbashi) from a rail station at Luishia.  Oxide ore was mainly 
classified as smelter ore (screened for coarse and fine sizes), concentrate ore, and 
cobalt ore.  Sulphide ore was not mined.  The total mine production, summarized in 
Table 3,  was about 4.1 million tonnes of ore with an average grade of 8.3% Cu, and 
6.2 million tonnes of waste.  A total of 2.9 million tonnes of ore was shipped for 



 19

processing.  The bulk of this material, 81 percent, was concentrator ore averaging 
8.1% Cu, 14  percent consisted of high-grade smelter ore, averaging 19.1% Cu, and 
five percent was high-grade cobalt ore, with an average grade of 15.9% Cu and 
4.6% Co.  Material with less than 5% Cu (later probably 4%) was not economical at 
the time and was not mined.  Luishia Sud used a cut-off of 3% Cu for their 
December 1937 reserve estimate.

Kamwali.  The UMHK report states (p.38), that the Kileba deposit has no value 
(concerning Cu), and that the "Brèche de Kipoi" has locally little Cu-mineralization.   

 



 21 

Descriptions of Karoano, Kanshishi and Kansongwe are included in François (2006): 
Karoano  This fragment of R.2 is 110 metres long, it strikes northwest-southeast and 
dips at 40 degrees to the southwest. R.S.F. is in outcrop north of R.S.C., and there is 
some malachite. The fragment is too small to be of economic importance.  
Kanshishi  The Kanshishi R.2 fragment is about one kilometre long, of which 220 
metres are outcrop. It strikes east-west, with R.S.F. south of R.S.C., and shows only 
minor malachite in R.S.C. close to the R.S.F. contact, but is of interest because of its 
size. Some small shafts and a drill hole should help to better understand the 
mineralization. 
Kansongwe  Kansongwe consists of a northwesterly striking anticline of R.2 with a 
length of 300 metres. It dips 50 degrees to the south and is overturned to the 
northeast. Its southwestern flank, which is in normal succession, has been explored 
(2175 m of drilling in 1925 to 1931) and subsequently mined.  Most of the mined ore 
is from the BOMZ (black ore main zone) horizon, which is situated just below the 
upper orebody. Where unaltered, this is a massive sterile dolomite, but it can be 
mineralized during supergene alteration.  Kansongwe is not rich in cobalt, it carries 
only 0.2 to 0.5% Co.  Its depth extension is unknown since no deep drilling has been 
done. A first drill hole should test  for mineralization below the water table.  

 Luishia Sud Deposit 
 Luishia Sud was marked at surface by a small outcrop of siliceous, mineralized 

rocks.   The deposit was explored between 1923 and 1928 by UMHK through 
electromagnetic surveying, trenching, drilling and underground work.  A total of 46 
(45 vertical, one inclined) holes, with a combined length of 2406 metres were drilled 
over a northwest-southeast strike length of about 600 metres, with most holes on a 
25-metre square grid over the central 200 metres of the deposit (Figure 4).  These 
(28) holes vary in length from 24 to 89 metres with an average of 43 metres, with 
most holes about 40 metres long. Some longer holes (80 to 88 metres) were drilled at 
the northwest extension of the deposit.  The longest vertical hole (hole 407, 122 
metres) is situated at the southeast margin of the deposit. 
The geology (at 30 metres below surface), drill hole locations, and grade-thickness 
figures for copper for the Luishia Sud deposit are shown on Figure 4, and a section 
through the centre of the deposit - with our interpretation of dips - on Figure 5.

It should be noted that lithological descriptions in the available drill logs are in most 
cases not tied to the nomenclature of the Mines Subgroup, and the contacts, taken 
from a drawing in the report on Luishia Sud of 1937, are therefore somewhat open to 
interpretation. This is particularly the case for the "Breccia", shown to border the 
remnant of Mines Subgroup at Luisha on three sides.  The report mentions that the 
Luishia (Sud) fragment is limited to the east and northeast by the same major fault, 
which terminates the Luishia anticline to the east, and separates it from Kundelungu 
(Nguba) by an important breccia. To the northwest, the fragment is also terminated 
by a breccia formed by tectonics which were not fully understood in 1937.  It is 
therefore possible that the two breccias are not part of the same body as shown on 
the map. 
The geology of the deposit was summarized by chief geologist R. du Trieu in 1937 
(original in French): 



 25

The fragment of Mine Series at Luishia Sud is limited to the east and northeast by 

the large fault, which borders the Luishia anticline on its east side.  An important 

breccia separates the anticline from the Kundelungu. Towards the northwest it is also 

limited by a breccia, which results from tectonic complications which are not yet 
understood.  To the south and southeast it appears, pending more information, that 

the Mine Series and the Mwashya Series are concordant.  The Mwashya forms the 

relief at Luishia. 

The strata at Luishia Sud are in reverse order compared to Luishia, although they are 

situated on their direct extension. The usual stratigraphy of the series is present at 

Luishia Sud. 

The interpretation of results from drilling and underground work indicate that the 

strata are regular and dip at 45 to 60 degrees to the southwest. The underground 

work is not enough advanced to make this more precise. It is noted that a break 

perpendicular to the strike, follows approximately the cross-cut on level 30. It is 

therefore possible that certain anomalies will be encountered. However, because this 

will be an open pit, this is not of great importance. 

The Mine Series is in outcrop to the northwest of the deposit, everywhere else it is 

covered by a layer of red soil, which varies in thickness. This cover is on average 10 

metres thick.  It reaches 15 metres near drill holes 454 and 407. Mineralization starts 

generally not right below the red soil.  The top of the layers is leached. 

Mineralization of economic interest is present in the B.O.M.Z., the S.D. and at the 

contact between those and the C.M.N. The R.S.C. is poorly developed as in Luishia.  

The R.S.F. is insufficiently explored for an estimate. Where it has been intersected, it 

carries 4% to 5% in the oxidation zone. Green ore ("minerai vert") has been 

intersected in drill hole 464, where it assayed 6.5% 

The limit of the oxide zone is at 32 metres depth. Below is sulphur mineralisation, 

similar to the mineralization at Luishia. 

Cobalt seems to occur throughout, but in low quantities.  This will have to be 

monitored during mining. The length of the known mineralized zone is about 200 

metres. To the northwest, the mineralization is terminated by a fault, which cuts off 

the Mine Series. To the southeast, it dies out, inclined drill hole 407 did not intersect 

economic-grade mineralization.  It is possible that the B.O.M.Z. stays mineralized in 

this direction, beyond the proposed limit.  One could eventually exploit this extension 

from underground if it exists.

At the end of 1937, the tonnage above a cut-off of 3% Cu indicated from drilling at 
Luishia Sud, was estimated at 230 000 tonnes with a grade of 10% Cu. This estimate 
used a bulk density of 1.7 and was uncorrected for recoveries or dilutions. Another 
20 000 tonnes with a grade of 9% Cu at the extensions of the orebody was put in the 
probable category.  Possible tonnages were estimated at 75 000 tonnes grading 5% 
Cu for the R.S.F. and 25 000 tonnes at 7% Cu for the M.V. (minerai vert = green ore). 
From the report on the main Luishia deposit of March 1942, it is known that mining at 
Luishia Sud was carried out in 1938 and 1939 (Table 5), and that reserves in 1942  
were 203 000 tonnes with a grade of 10.1% Cu.  It is also noted that 1000 tonnes with 
a grade of 8 to 9% Co existed along the wall of R.S.F. which marked the limit of the 
mineralized zone.

cobaltiferous layer started in February and mining of that zone started in December. 

Total mining at the south deposit was 26 032 t of rich ore with a grade of 9.33% Cu, 

2217 t of low-grade ore with a grade of 3.48% Cu and 140 435 t of waste, for a total 

of 168 684 t with 2504 t of Cu.

We have no information on the total tonnes and grade of ore mined at Luishia Sud 
after these figures were released in 1942.  Total stripping amounted to 211 400 m3 at 
that time, or about 330 000 tonnes using a bulk density of 1.56 from the figures in 
Table 5. 
From data collected during the site visit in June 2007, the pit, waste pile and sample 
locations are shown on Figure 6.  The rock units in the pit (Plates 1-3) strike 
northwest-southeast and dip steeply to the southwest. They come to surface on the 
northeast side of the pit (where the deposit was discovered in outcrop), while they are 
buried under about 30 metres of overburden on its opposite side (Plate 10).  UMHK 
noted in their report on Luishia Sud that the overburden (red soil) was on average 10 
metres thick, with a maximum of 15 metres encountered in drill holes. These numbers 
are not confirmed by  some of the holes, e.g., 447 and 455, where red soil was found 
to depths of 22 and 38 (end of hole) metres respectively.  The overburden-outcrop 
boundary is at about 30 metres at the southwest end of the trench dug in the pit 
during the site visit.  The greater overburden thickness may reflect local karst fill, a 
karst cavity was observed at the end of the trench. The area near the pit is flat and 
without outcrop exposure. 
A silicified vuggy carbonate horizon, about one metre thick and identified as part of  
"RAT" by the TSM geologists, forms the northeast wall of the pit.  This unit carries 
locally high-grade Cu-Co mineralization (Plate 7), and was one of the targets of 
artisanal mining activities. It is joined by thin platy-weathering calcareous siltstones to 
the northeast, exposed in a trench at the northwest corner of the pit.  To the 
southwest, the RAT is joined byin contact with about 20 -metre-thick softer calcareous 
siltstone, which - following , according to the general stratigraphyinterpretation of the 
Roan Supergroup -geology by UMHK, has been tentatively grouped with the RSF 
unit.  MThis unit is followed by more competent carbonate rock, possibly RSC (but not 
silicified, therefore probably not RSC), with a thickness of 13 metres, joins the RSF to 
the southeast.  The carbonates are followed by a 10-metre-thickand 10 metres of 
calcareous siltstone to the southwest, possibly both probably part of the SD, which is 
unit. The SD carbonates are joined by massive limestone, likely CMN, to the 
southeast.   

  Thick fault -breccia bodies, which appear to cut the RAT and Mines units at right 
angles, terminate the pit to the northwest and southeast.  Another, thinner fault 
breccia with a similar

similar orientation is exposed near the centre of the pit.  This fault would have a right-
lateralright- lateral offset if a layer of siltstone with clusters of chert nodules in the 
eastern portion of the pit is an equivalent of the main silicified RAT unit.   
Mineralization in the pit consists of bright green malachite as thin coatings on 
fractures or bedding planes, but locally forming centimetre-thick layered crusts on 
bedrock, the copper ore sought by artisanal miners (Plates 4, 5). Malachite was 
found in all rock types except in the more competent carbonates in the centre of the 
pit, and was also seen in the breccias. Cobalt mineralization occurs as dark grey to 
black heterogenite, frequently with a sandy or powdery texture.   

 
8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

The deposits targeted by Creso at Luisha are stratiform or crosscutting Cu-Co 
deposits, similar to deposits known throughout the Central African Copperbelt of the 
DRC and Zambia, including Kolwezi, Tenke-Fungurume, Kabolela, Likasi, Etoile and 
others.  These deposits have formed in cratonic rift settings during the 
Neoproterozoic, and are of mixed origin, including probably syngenetic and 
diagenetic processes and re-mobilization during periods of intense folding and 
thrusting, and later through oxidation of sulphide minerals and deposition of oxide 
minerals during weathering.       
Mining in the Copperbelt to date has been, and still is, focussed on the easily 
accessible and high-grade oxide ores, which can be leached with sulfuric acid, while 
comparatively little is known on the grades and metallurgy of the unweathered 
sulphide portions of the deposits. 
 

9. EXPLORATION 
With the exception of artisanal mining activities, no work has recently been carried 
out on the Luisha property, and TSM has no records of previous work by Gécamines 
or others.  No exploration was performed at Luisha since Creso became involved in 
the project with the exception of. Creso undertook some grab sampling, and the 
backhoe trenching in the pit and on the adjacent waste pile, carried out first during 
our property visit, with some subsequent sampling by Creso since in the pit, and in a 
tunnel discovered under the north-wall of the pit.  Short adits exist at the east side of 
the pit, which have not been sampled yet.  The results of the sampling by Strathcona 
are shown in Table 3Table 7 on page 1727. 



 33 

Creso has attempted to start a drilling program at Luisha, but so far has been 
unsuccessful in signing a contract due to the high demand for drill rigs in the DRC, 
both for core and reverse circulation drilling.  

 
10.  DIAMOND DRILLING 

No records of drilling are available, with the exception of two holes drilled by 
Gécamines, mentioned in an environmental impact study for the Luisha project by 
TSM of January 2006 (Etude d'impact environnemental et programme gestion 
environnementale du projet, Janvier 2006), which accompanied the application for a 
small-scale mining permit. Hole SM90 was drilled 500 metres south of the pit, and 
hole SM55 was drilled outside the permit boundary, approximately five kilometres 
southeast of the pit.  Both holes were drilled to 80 metres depth and intersected shale 
and minor dolostone, and did not reachThe area of the Luisha pit was drilled on 25-
metre centres and wider spacings (Figure 4) by UMHK in 1923 to 1928, with a total 
of 2406 metres drilled in 45 vertical holes and one inclined hole.  This drill program 
was generally targeted to explore the oxide portion of the deposit above the water 
table (the water level in the CIMCO pit is approximately 25 metres below surface). 
There are no assays or descriptions of mineralization in the drill logs.  
The report by TSM includes a paragraph on the mineralogy and size of the deposit, 
which gives a size of 1.8 by 6.1 kilometres for the Roan Supergroup thrust slice on 
the property.  It further states that drilling undertaken by TSM, indicates a deposit 25 
to 98 metres thick, with a grade of 1.2-1.3% Cu and 0.2-0.5% Co, comprising 255 
500 tonnes of malachite and 115 800 tonnes of heterogenite mineralization. Since 
there is no backup information for these data, they are not relied upon in this report. 

 
11. at about 32 metres depth.  Sulphides were noted to occur below the oxides, as was 

the case at the main Luishia deposit, but were not explored due to their lower Cu-
grade (average 2.6% Cu at the main deposit).  The logs show several instances 
where malachite is mentioned but the core was not assayed, since the grade was too 
low to be of interest to UMHK at that time.  In some cases there are check assays 
reported from the local UMHK laboratory, which may differ from the original assays, 
but in general, report  the same high copper grades.  Cobalt was not always assayed, 
and many Co-assays had a detection limit of one percent, although there are also 
Co-values below that limit. Copper minerals recorded in the UMHK drill logs include 
the oxide minerals malachite, cuprite (Cu2O) and native copper, and sulphides 
chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite.   



 34 

In summary, drilling by UMHK mainly targeted high-grade Cu-Co oxide ore above the 
water table, while information on the lower-grade portions of the oxide zone was 
collected sporadically, and the sulphide zone was not explored.     

 
11.  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

To get an appreciation of Cu-Co values contained in the waste pile east of the Luisha 
pit, ten sample pits were dug by backhoe and sampled by the author during the 
property visit.  The pits varied in depth from 5.1 to 6.5 metres (Figure 47), and were 
channel-sampled using the excavator bucket for access.  The results of this sampling 
are shown on Figure 36.  The sample pits did not reach the bottom of the waste pile, 
which is 7-8 metres high on its southwest side.  In all but one pit (No. 10) one sample 
was collected from a vertical channel on one side of the pit, over the entire height of 
the wall.  In pit 10, materials were different enough to justify collection of two separate 
samples.  All samples were dry, and weighed about six kilograms each. 

   
 
  

Figure   47   Luisha Waste Pile Sampling  
 



 35 

The portion of the waste pile close to the open pit consists mainly of red, clayey soil 
(overburden), which further to the northeast is successively covered and replaced by 
broken and decomposed bedrock. 

The channels were dug by geology hammer, and since all pits contained silt and sand 
size material mixed with varying amounts of pebble to cobble-size bedrock fragments,  
the channel samples do not always represent an equal amount of material over the 
entire length of the channel.  Assay values from pits in fine-grained overburden 
material have a higher confidence level than assays from pits filled mostly with bedrock 
fragments. T While the assay values received from the samples do representassays 
reflect the mineralization contained in the waste pile, but the average error margin for 
the assays is probably 20% or more. they are not an accurate representation of the 
true grade of the pit materials. 

Two samples of decomposed bedrock from a backhoe trench in the Luisha pit were 
collected from horizontal channels along a trench wall (Figure 36), but the limitations 
for the waste pile samples would also apply to the representativeness of the 
trenchthese samples in the Luisha pit. 

 
12.    SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

The Luisha samples collected during the June 2007 site visit, together with 13 soil 
samples taken by Creso, were shipped by DHL courier from Lubumbashi to SGS 
Mineral Services in Toronto for assaying. The pit and trench samples were assayed 
for 27 elements by induced coupled plasma method ICP40B, and samples with Cu 
values above 10 000 ppm assayed for Cu by ICP90Q.  Creso had soil samples from 
a profile near the east end of the Luisha pit assayed by mobile metal ion method 
MMI-M5 and by ICP. No assays for acid soluble copper and total copper were 
requested, however, these assays could be performed on the samples if necessary.  
Assay results for samples from waste pile pits and from a trench in the open pit are 
shown in Table 36 and Figure 36, and assay reports are attached in Appendix III.

Table   3 
An estimate of tonnages and copper and cobalt grades has been made for the waste 
pile (Table 7) based on the backhoe sampling, assaying, and GPS surveying of the 
perimeter of the waste pile and the pit locations.  The depth of pits was measured by 
tape.  Each pit was assigned a polygon, and a volume calculated by multiplying the 
area of the polygon with the depth of the pit.  This volume was then multiplied with an 
estimated bulk density to arrive at tonnes.  Since bulk densities for the material are 
not known, we used estimates of 1.4 t/m3 and 1.6/m3.

The layer of the waste pile sampled by the pits contains between 330 000 and 370 
000 tonnes, with an average grade of 0.6% Cu  and 0.3% Co.  The grades are subject 
to the limitations mentioned in paragraph 11.  The table shows that the averages are 
somewhat misleading, since some pits contain very little mineralization (pits 1, 2), 
while others are relatively high in cobalt (pits 4, 5), or copper (pits 7, 8, 9).  The 
tonnage is a minimum, since the portion of the waste pile below the reach of the 
backhoe could not be sampled.  This bottom layer will contain relatively more of the 
red low-grade overburden material, which was dumped first and tapers off to the 
northeast.  The waste pile tonnage is in the range of the total of 330 000 tonnes of 
waste reportedly stripped by UMHK from Luishia Sud.  
Metallurgical testwork is required to determine the percentage of copper and cobalt 
recoverable in a leach plant.  Pilot plant studies on oxide ore from Tenke-Fungurume 
indicate recoveries of 95% for copper and 83% for cobalt (Nofal et al, 2007), and 
bench scale testwork for the Kalukundi Project in the Kolwezi district of Katanga 
Province achieved recoveries of 96% for copper and 86% for cobalt for material 
between surface and 10 metres depth (Hearne et al, 2006). Anvil Mining reported 
recoveries of 74-77% Cu for the oxide ore (malachite) from the Kinsevere mine in 
2007, using heavy mineral separation.

14.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

CIMCO - Luisha 
The main Luisha deposit and pit, centred 1.2 kilometres northwest of the Creso-TSM 
pit, is owned by Congo International Mining Corporation (CIMCO), a joint venture 
company of Gécamines and a Chinese group, who have built a metallurgical plant just 
north of Luisha village, but didwho were not carry outactively mining operations 
duringat the time of our visit in June 2007. 
Tiger Resources - Kipoi  
The Kipoi project of Tiger Resources Limited (Tiger) of Perth Australia, is centred 
approximately 12 kilometres southeast of the Creso-TSM Luisha pit, and covers 12.5 
kilometres strike length of the Roan SupergGroup southeast of Luisha permit PEPM 
4881. The northwest corner of the Kipoi permit area is approximately one kilometre 
south of the Luisha permit boundary.   
The permits covering the Kipoi area are owned 60% by Congo Minerals SPRL and 
40 % by Gécamines, and in May 2006 Tiger together with its Congolese partner 
company, Groupe Orgaman, signed an agreement  for an option to acquire a 55% 
interest in the property, and another 25% after completion of a bankable feasibility 
study.  The project includes five different Cu-Co deposits or mineralized zones - 
Kileba, Kipoi Central, Kipoi NW, Kipoi N, and Judeira - spread over a strike length of 
10 kilometres, and another occurrence three kilometres northeast of the main band of 
Roan SupergGroup.  Judeira, the northernmost occurrence on the Tiger permits, is at 
a distance of 7.5 kilometres from the Luisha Creso-TSM pit.  

  The property had never been drilled, but had been explored by pitting, trenching and 
exploration adits in the past.  Based on this work, Gécamines had estimated a part of 
the Kipoi property to contain 200  000 t tonnes of contained copper to a depth of 30 
metres (African Mining, 2007). 
Since mid-2006 Tiger has completed detailed helicopter airborne magnetic and 
radiometric surveying, soil sampling, adit sampling and reverse circulation drilling, 
diamond drilling and Aaircore drilling on the property, with highly encouraging results.  
The best drill intersections include 7.31% Cu over 122 metres core length in Kipoi 
Central (news release of May 14, 2007).  At Kipoi Central copper oxide-sulphide

mineralization has been outlined over a strike length of 550 metres and a zone of 
high_grade cobalt mineralization over a strike length of at least 150 metres.   
The copper mineralization is localized above the Lower and Upper R4 (Mwashya 
Formation) contact within steeply-dipping breccia zones and conjugate and bedding-
parallel vein sets. The mineralization is hosted by siltstone-dolostone of the Upper R4.  
The cobalt mineralization has been identified near the northern end of the Kipoi 
Central pit, and occurs in the hanging wall of the faulted contact between volcanic 
rocks (pyroclastics) of the Lower R4 and siliciclastic sediments of the Upper R4.  
On September 9, 2007, Tiger reported that the contractual arrangements and 
activities of Congo Minerals at the Kipoi Project arewere being reviewed by a DRC 
Government Commission which currently reviews all contracts entered into by DRC 
State_controlled companies including Gécamines. Gécamines has subsequently 
requested that the feasibility study for Kipoi be completed in  the near future, instead 
of January 31, 2009 as agreed to by Tiger.

15.  
Kipoi was part of the "Polygone de Kipoi - Gisement de Kileba" area explored by 
UMHK in 1935.  UMHK considered Kileba of no value as a copper prospect, and 
reported that the chloritic rocks known as "Brèche de Kipoi" carry locally minor 
copper.  From the drill results published by Tiger Resources, Kipoi contains very 
interesting copper mineralization, and the company also reported best results of 38 
metres of 5.4% Cu from initial RC drilling at Kileba, situated about five kilometres 
southeast of Kipoi. Historical workings can be traced intermittently over a distance of 
about 1100 m at Kileba. 

 
15.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

No information on mineral processing or metallurgical testwork carried out on samples 
from the Creso-TSM Luisha property is available, and noneno testwork has been 
done yet in the current investigations.  However, mMaterial mined by artisanal miners 
has been treated in Lubumbashi by TSM in the customary manner for ores from the 
area.. 

 
16.  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

No drilling has been carried out on the Creso-TSM Luisha property that would allow 
an estimate of a mineral resource for the project.   
An estimate of tonnages and copper and cobalt grades has been made for the waste 
pile (Table 4) based on the backhoe sampling, assaying, and GPS surveying of the 
perimeter of the waste pile and the pit locations.

The depth of pits was measured by tape.  Each pit was assigned a polygon, and a 
volume calculated by multiplying the area of the polygon with the depth of the pit.  
This volume was then multiplied with an estimated bulk density to arrive at tonnes.  
Since bulk densities for the material are not known, we used estimates of 1.4 t/m3 and 
1.6/m3.  The layer of the waste pile sampled by the pits has between 330 000 and 370

more of the red low-grade overburden material, which was dumped first and tapers off 
to the northeast. 
Metallurgical testwork is required to determine the percentage of copper and cobalt 
recoverable in a leach plant.  Pilot plant studies on oxide ore from Tenke-Fungurume 
indicate recoveries of 95% for copper and 83% for cobalt (Nofal et al, 2007), and 
bench scale testwork for the Kalukundi Project in the Kolwezi district of Katanga 
Province achieved recoveries of 96% for copper and 86% for cobalt for material 
between surface and 10 metres depth (Hearne et al, 2006). 

 
17. The last resource statement for Luisha dates back to 1940, when UMHK reported 

203 000 tonnes of 10.1% Cu for the deposit.  This tonnage has probably all been 
mined and is of historical significance only.  No current resource estimate exists for 
the deposit.   

 
17.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Luisha permit PEPM 4881 is underlain by Roan SupergGroup sediments which 
host locally host high-grade Cu-Co mineralization, exposed in a pit approximately 250 
by 80 metres  in plan, and 30 metres deep, probably exploited by Gécamines in the 
past.  The pit has.  Some 230 000 tonnes of oxide ore with a grade of about 10% Cu 
were mined by UMHK from the pit starting in 1938-39, and by UMHK, and possibly by 
Gécamines, later.  The pit has further been exploited by artisanal miners for malachite 
and heterogenite ore until recently, when the activities were stopped after the Creso-
TSM joint venture had been formed. The main Luisha deposit, mined by UMHK in 
1913-1939, and now owned by CIMCO, joins PEPM 4881 to the northeast, and 
anorthwest.  A permit in close proximity to the southeast corner of PEPM 4881 is 
being explored by Tiger Resources, who have released very encouraging drill results 
from the Kipoi Central deposit.  From its location and, observed mineralization, and 
past mining history, the Luisha property has to be considered highly prospective for 
Cu-Co mineralization.  
There are no records of diamond drilling with the exception of two short, vertical 
geotechnical holes attributed to Gécamines, which intersected mainly shale, have no 
assays, and appear to be located outside the Roan sediments. Despite this lack of 
drill information, it is still possible that some drilling has been carried out by 
Gécamines or others in the past.  With no outcrop near the pit, the extent of the 
prospective Roan Supergroup on the permit is unknownResults from shallow drilling 
by UMHK in 1923-28 indicate that the fragment of Roan Group sediments containing

the Luisha mineralization on PEPM 4881, has a strike length of about 300 metres, and 
is cut off by breccias to the east, northeast and west.  The Roan Group fragment is 
open to the southwest and to depth, and shows a normal sequence from RAT to RSF, 
BOMZ, SD and CMN formations, all of which have the potential to carry Cu-Co 
mineralization. 
Since most of the oxide ore has been mined, potential for Cu-Co mineralization 
remains mainly in the sulphides below the water table, which have not been evaluated 
by UMHK, and there may also be oxide and sulphide mineralization in the CMN 
formation on the southwest side of the deposit.  This remaining potential should be 
tested by drilling, to define Cu-Co grades and the depth extent of the fragment within 
the breccias. There is no information on drill types, core sizes,  recoveries, or assay 
methods (total Cu, Co, acid-soluble Cu, Co) used by UMHK, and it would therefore be 
of interest to twin some UMHK holes outside the pit to compare geology and assays.  
Holes 468 and 446, which are located in CMN formation southwest of the pit, and 
intersected 8.2% Cu over four metres and 4.4% Cu over two metres respectively, 
could be re-drilled.      
The best potential for new discoveries of oxide ore on PEPM 4881 exists on ground to 
the southeast of the Luisha pit, and this potential depends primarily on the percentage  
of mineralized Roan Group present.  News releases by Tiger Resources indicate that 
one of their targets, Judeira, is situated 7.5 kilometres southeast from the Creso-TSM 
Luisha pit. 
In contrast to other deposits in the Copperbelt, where Cu-Co mineralization is 
generally found in the RSF, RSC and SDB Formations of the Mines (R2) Group, 
mineralization on the permit explored by Tiger Resources is reported to occur in the 
younger Mwashya (R4) Group of the Roan Supergroup.  According to TSM 
geologists, mineralized rocks exposed in the Luisha pit belong to the Mines Group. 
The Roan sediments in the Luisha pit contain Cu-Co oxide mineralization over 
extensive widths, and locally high-grade mineralization, the target of artisanal miners.  
Although the results of trench, along the general strike direction of the Roan Group.  
UMHK or Gécamines have likely explored the area between Luisha and Kipoi, but 
could have missed mineralization not exposed in outcrop. 
A combination of geophysical (induced polarization-resistivity) and geochemical 
surveys, and mapping should be best suited to define any targets similar to Luisha 
under overburden in that area.  Roan Group lithologies identified by the surveys would 
be further explored by drilling.

Results of samples taken during our visit have to be viewed with some caution, due to 
the nature of the samples, whichin June 2007 from a trench in the pit may not be 
completely representative, since the samples were scratched with a geology hammer 
from the wall of the trench, t.  They nevertheless indicate veryconfirm interesting Cu-
Co values, consistent with UMHK drill results. The mineralization, particularly the g 
Green malachite crusts could be observed in the trench.  While more trench and adit 
sampling could be done (and has since been completed by Creso), drilling, preferably 
diamond drilling, is necessary to collect information on the geology and structure of 
the hostrocks, the grade distribution and location of the oxide-sulphide boundary at 
LuishaCreso has in the meantime re-sampled an old tunnel found in the northeast wall 
of the pit.  The nature of the breccias in the pit is unclear.  If they are, some may be 
local fault breccias, the  sediments and mineralization can be expected to continue, 
although offset, past the faults.  If they represent basal breccias (megabreccias), the 
same does not necessarily apply, since these breccias are at the base of the Lower 
Kundelungu Supergroupdifferent from the breccia at the Roan-Nguba boundary. 

  Sampling of the waste pile indicates that there is a quantity of about 350 000 tonnes, 
with values for copper and cobalt that may justify processing of this material, which 
ideally would be done in an existing plant in the area.  The CIMCO plant, probably set 
up for similar type of oxide material, would be the most logical site for this processing, 
however, other plants or possibilities for treating the waste pile may exist.  
The waste material is difficult to sample due to its unequal size distribution, and it is 
highly recommended to take more infill pit samples prior to a decision to invest in 
processing. 

 
 18. .  For an accurate assessment of the waste pile, more larger samples need to be 

processed and the depth of the pile determined.  
 
18.  RECOMMENDATIONS 

The permit area should be mapped and relatively widely-spaced geochemical 
(MMI) sampling carried out along the implied trend of the Roan sediments 
between the Luisha pit and the Tiger Resources permit to the southeast.  Induced 
polarization (IP) may detect the sulphides underneath the oxide zone and should 
be tested near the pit, and extended along strike if successful.   

The Old workings that may exist on the property outside of the Luisha pit and adits 
and trenches should be mapped and thesampled.

Mapping and sampling of the pit should be completed, and the rocks positively 
identified by a geologist familiar with the Roan and Kundelungu Supergroups.  
DiamondNguba stratigraphy.  To explore the potential of the Roan Group sediments in 
the pit area, diamond drilling of two inclined holes each on five sections at 100-metre 
spacings, for a total of about 2000 metres is recommended for the pit area.  If is 
recommended.  This would be followed by infill drilling on four sections if warranted by 
the results, four fill-in sections with two holes each would be drilled, which would bring 
the total to about 3000 metres..  Including twinning of some of the UMHK holes 
outside of the pit, a total of about 2500 metres of drilling can be expected for the first 
phase of work.  For the area outside of the pit, mainly along the presumed strike 
extension of the Roan Group to the southeast towards the Kipoi project, initial testing 
of geological-geochemical-geophysical targets may require 2000 metres of drilling. 
The samples from the waste pile collected in June-July should be used for initial 
metallurgical testing, and mMore excavator-sampling carried outof the waste pile is 
required, to receive more grade data of the waste materialand samples for 
metallurgical testwork.  A bulk sample consisting of material from the waste pile and of 
loose material from the pit bottom should be put through a sample tower.  
Metallurgical testwork should determine the suitability of the loose material for 
recovery of copper and cobalt by acid leaching. A plant in the area should be secured 
for custom-processing of the waste pile, if economic grades are confirmed.   
DIf warranted by the results of this program, drill coverage would be extended as 
needed, during a second phase of exploration at Luisha, drill coverage would be 
extended as needed, and a total of 7000 metres is included in the budget.  Also, more 
bulk sampling and metallurgical and mining testwork would be carried out during that 
phase. 

 
Budget 
Creso hasd to establish an office in Lubumbashi and requires geological and 
administrative staff, as well as equipment and vehicles and a camp before field work 
can start. The estimated costs for work in two phases at Luisha are $2.5 million in 
each of Phase I and Phase II, for a total of $5.0 million as shown in Table 58  below.
