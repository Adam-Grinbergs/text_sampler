1. SUMMARY  
The Sawayaerdun Property (Property) is located in Wuqia County Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region, western China, immediately adjacent to the border with Kyrgyzstan, 
about 200 kilometres northwest of the city of Kashi, the nearest major centre, and about 
1,000 kilometres southwest of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.   

 

The geographic centre of the property is located at about 40ยบ 04'19" North Latitude and 74ยบ 

16'30" East Longitude. The Property contains two gold deposits, Zone I and Zone IV that 
are the subject of this report.  A Mining License, No C6500002009124120053762, with an 
area of 1.7094 square kilometres and valid until February 25, 2018 covers the two deposits.  
The licence is held in the name of Xinjiang Tongyuan Minerals Ltd. and has an operating 
limit of 90,000 tonnes per year.  Xinjiang Tongyuan Minerals Ltd. (Tongyuan) is owned by 
three partners: Xinjiang Weifu Mining Ltd., a subsidiary of GobiMin Inc. (GobiMin), (70%); 
Xinjiang Baodi Mining Ltd., (15%) and by a subsidiary of the No. 2 Brigade of the Xinjiang 
Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (No. 2 Brigade) (15%).  The Property was 
acquired by Tongyuan in September 2009.   

Philip Jones has been retained by GobiMin to prepare a resource estimate and technical 
report on the Sawayaerdun Property for both Zone I and Zone IV, the best-explored of a 
number of fracture-hosted gold occurrences that are present within the Property.  This 
technical report is compliant with the requirements of National Instrument (NI) 43-101.   

 

The Sawayaerdun Property is located in the southern Tian Shan Mountains.  Gold 
mineralization is contained within a series of sub-parallel fault zones of regional extent 
marking the structural contact between heavily-sheared, fine-grained clastic 
metasedimentary rocks of the Silurian Sawayaerdun Formation and the structurally 
overlying Devonian Taertekuli Formation.   The gold mineralisation at Sawayaerdun was 
initially explored by the Xinjiang Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources (XBGMR) during 
the 1980s and 1990s when they carried out regional geological mapping, trenching, drilling 
and underground exploration.   The Property was then acquired by Majestic Gold Corp 
(Majestic). in 2003 who, during the period 2004 โ 2007, explored mainly along Zone IV by 
trenching and drilling (46 holes, 8,800 aggregate metres).  GobiMin acquired Majestic's 
share of the project in 2009 and funded all subsequent exploration.  In 2010 and 2011 an 
aggregate of 127 holes were completed for around 38,000 metres within Zone I and Zone IV 
to verify the exploration results obtained by previous operators and to further explore the 
main deposits. 

 

The current resource estimate is based upon all current and historic drill hole and trench 
assay data.  The resources for Zone 1 and Zone IV are summarised in Table 1.

lower cut-off grade base case  * Wardrop 2011 estimate Kriged tonnes and grade       

 

 

This latest resource estimate adds 18.4 million tonnes of Indicated resources for 798 
thousand ounces of contained gold and 30.3 million tonnes of Inferred resources for 1,117 



 

7 | P a g e  
 

thousand ounces to the resource estimate in Zone IV by Wardrop in 2011.  Wardrop did not 
estimate a resource for Zone I. 

An exploration program of drilling, underground development and metallurgical testing, with 
a budget of about US$6.8 million (~RMB43 million) is recommended for Zone IV in order to 
upgrade more or all of the Inferred resource into the Indicated category and to obtain a 
better understanding of the mining and metallurgical characteristics of the mineralization.

The Property contains the numerous gold occurrences although the main structure that 
contains the gold mineralization is of regional extent and extends well beyond the Property 
boundaries.  There are two trial adits being developed on the Property as well as several 
abandoned, experimental leach pads as well as a small open pit and several now-collapsed 
adits from previous exploration campaigns.    

There are no back-in rights other agreements or encumbrances to which the Property is or 
will be subject with the exception of an annual fee for the mining licence of RMB 
1000/kilometre2 (approximately CAD$158 / kilometre2 ).  There are no current environmental 
liabilities. Future abandoned mine restitution obligations are addressed by an Environmental 
Protection Deposit that is held by the appropriate government authority.  The existing Mining 
Licence is the only permit necessary to continue the present program of exploration.

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY  

 

The Property is located in the southern Tian Shan Mountains with moderate to steep 
topography and elevations between 3,100 and 4,000 metres above sea level, Figure 2.   

 

Figure 2  Sawayaerdun Property Location and Access   (Google Earth, 2012)  

A paved highway connects the regional centre at Kashgar (Kashi) with the village of 
Wulukeqiati via Wuqia.  The remaining 38 kilometres to the property from Wulukeqiati is via 
an un-paved road.  Within the Property, a system of exploration roads provides access to 
most of the licence area.  Vegetation is primarily comprised of sparse alpine grasses, wild 
onion and thorny shrubs.   Temperatures range from -15ยบ Celsius in the winter to 25ยบ Celsius 
in the summer.  Rainfall is sparse except in June and July, snowfall is possible between 
November and April.  

Water is available locally from the Sawayaerdun River which is mainly fed by snow melt.  An 
agreement has been entered into with the local electricity supplier for the mining and 
processing power supply.  A 38km power line from Tongyuan will connect the 
property with the local power grid.    Adequate areas for waste-rock storage exist within 
the licence area but the scarcity of flat terrain within the Property may necessitate locating 
processing facilities, and therefore tailings disposal, outside the Property boundaries.

6. HISTORY  
 

Regional geological exploration at 1:200,000 scale was first conducted in the area during 
1952 and 1953 by geologists from the former Soviet Union.  Chinese geologists followed up 
with regional geological mapping in the area between 1983 and 1985 when a geochemical 
survey in 1985 led to the discovery of gold mineralization at Sawayaerdun.   

An exploration licence that included the present Property was granted to XBGMR in 1983.  
XBGMR continued regional exploration until the mid-1990s with more focused exploration 
programs continuing until 1999.  The XBGMR carried out geological mapping, geochemical 
sampling, trenching, pitting, underground development and diamond drilling, primarily within 
Zone IV.   

Geological mapping was conducted at a scale of 1:10,000.  Trenches were typically spaced 
from 40 to 80 metres apart and were used to define the surface trace of mineralization.  Of 
the known areas of mineralization, Zone IV has been most intensively explored: by the end 
of 1998, nine holes (2,866 aggregate metres) had been drilled, 17 adits (1,415 aggregate 
metres), had been driven, and 34,000 cubic metres of trenches had been excavated on 22 
gold zones.  Each of the trenches was chip-sampled at approximately one-metre intervals.   

In 1999 XBGMR estimated a polygonal resource based on the trench, adit and drill hole 
sampling for Zone IV of 17,246,000 tonnes with an average grade of 1.96 grams per tonne 
gold (g/t Au).  This resource is comprised of approximately 90% sulphide and 10% oxide 
mineralization.  The lower cut-off grade for this resource estimate was 1.0g/t Au with a 
minimum zone thickness of 0.8 metres.    At a cut-off grade of 0.5g/t Au the resource 
estimate was 26,000,000 tonnes at an average grade of 1.7g/t Au.   The density of data at 
the time of the calculation resulted in a classification of the resource into Categories D and E 
of the then-current Chinese resource classification system.  For Category D grades and 
thicknesses were extrapolated between 30 and 60 metres, and for Category E, 60 to 120 
metres.  This estimate is considered relevant but is of unknown reliability and not 
considered NI43-101 compliant and is only included in this report for historical purposes.     

In about 1997, the XBGMR excavated a portion of Zone IV in a small open pit and 
processed the ore on six leach pads in the adjacent Sawayaerdun River valley.  The results 
obtained from this leaching operation are not known.  In November 2003, Majestic Gold 
Corporation signed a joint venture agreement with XBGMR.  Majestic had the right to earn a 
90% interest in the property as it then existed by incurring all exploration and development 
costs.  Majestic sold their interest back to XBGMR in 2009.   

During the period 2004 โ 2007 Majestic conducted programs of geological mapping, 
prospecting, trenching, core drilling and geophysical surveys, mostly on Zone IV.  During 
2004 and 2005, Majestic carried out trench sampling and core drilling over a 2000-metre 
strike length of this zone.  Thirty-two trenches with an aggregate length of about 1,200 
metres were excavated and 46 holes with an aggregate length of about 8,840 metres were 
drilled to test the zone to depths of between 100 and 300 metres below surface.   



 

14 | P a g e  
 

In 2006 Wardrop completed a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for Zone IV based on 
trench and drill data collected to the end of 2005.  At a lower cut-off grade of 0.50g/t Au, the 
zone was estimated to contain an Indicated resource of 18.0 million tonnes at an average 
gold grade of 1.2g/t, and an Inferred resource of 24.4 million tonnes with an average grade 
of 1.1g/t Au.  This estimate is considered by the Author to be both relevant and reliable as a 
historic estimate.  The data used in the 2006 estimate forms a substantial portion of the data 
upon which the current estimate, presented in Section 17.0 of this report, is based.    During 
2006 and 2007 Majestic drilled a further nine holes for an aggregate of 1,650 metres, 
principally to test the southwest and northeast limits of the zone.        

In 2011 Wardrop completed another NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for Zone IV 
based on the trench and drill data to the end of 2010.  A summary of this resource estimate 
at a lower cut-off grade of 0.5g/t Au is quoted in Table 3.

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING  

  Regional  

The tectonic framework of China is dominated by three global orogenic systems: the Central-
Asian or Paleo-Tethyan, the Circum-Pacific and Tethys-Himalaya.  The Property area is 
located within the Tethys-Himalaya system that resulted from the subduction of the Pacific 
Ocean floor beneath China and the collision of the Indian sub-continent with Eurasia.  The 
resultant fold belts are predominantly the product of subduction and accretion of oceanic 
complexes that were the focus of deformation in Paleozoic-Mesozoic cratonic collisions 
during final ocean closures.    

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is underlain by the Altaid orogenic complex, 
situated in the south-central part of the Eurasian Plate, immediately north of the Himalayan 
collision zone and south of the Angara Craton that underlies eastern Russia.  The region 
consists of several independent Precambrian continental blocks; Paleozoic accretionary 
complexes and extensional basins define the sutures between these blocks.  Permian 
extensional tectonics formed deep basins, including the Tarim, within the Altaid orogenic 
complex.  The Tarim Basin is the largest inland basin in China and is the product of late 
Paleozoic rifting that led to passive-margin sedimentation through the Cambrian and 
Ordovician, as well as the accumulation of several kilometres of terrestrial sediments from 
the mid-Paleozoic through the Mesozoic.  The Tian Shan mountain range, located 
immediately north of the Tarim Basin, is comprised of two partly-amalgamated Paleozoic 
sequences of allochthonous terranes forming the south-central portion of the Altaid orogenic 
zone.                

Property Geology  

Stratigraphy   

The Sawayaerdun Property is located in the eastern Kokshaal region of the southern Tian 
Shan Mountains.  Gold mineralization is contained within fine-grained clastic 
metasedimentary rocks of Devonian age.   



 

16 | P a g e  
 

 

Figure 3  Sawayaerdun property geology (Modified after GobiMin 2010)     

The Silurian-age Taertekuli Formation is the oldest unit exposed within the Property.  The 
Taertekuli Formation is comprised of sericite phyllite, metamorphosed sandstone, minor 
siliceous mudstone, carbonaceous siliceous phyllite, slate and calcareous breccia.  This 
formation is of probable turbiditic origin.  The Taertekuli Formation is overlain by the 
Devonian Sawayaerdun Formation.  

The Sawayaerdun Formation is subdivided into upper and lower units, both of which are 
turbiditic and are comprised of thin laminae of phyllite and siltstone.  The phyllites of the 
upper member are carbonaceous and this member is the primary host for gold mineralization 
in the area. 

Overlaying the Sawayaerdun Formation in the southeast are the Lower Carboniferous 
clastics and limestones of the Bashisuogong Formation. 

Quaternary deposits of fluvial outwash overlays the basement along the lower reaches of the 
Sawayaerdun River.   

Structure 

The predominant strike direction within the Property is northeast and most dips are to the 
northwest.   Schistosity is commonly developed parallel to bedding.  Existing mapping 
indicates that the disposition of formations is tectonically controlled.  The Silurian-aged 
Taertekuli Formation structurally overlies the Devonian-age Sawayaerdun Formation and 
strikes about 040 degrees.   The contact between the Taertekuli and Sawayaerdun 
Formations follows a prominent, northeast-trending fault (F3) with a strike of about 030 



 

17 | P a g e  
 

degrees that contains mineral Zone IV and obliquely truncates the Sawayaerdun Formation, 
and may also truncate the Taertekuli Formation.  Zone I is sub-parallel to Zone IV but lies 
entirely within the Sawayaerdun Formation.   

The Sawayaerdun Formation is mapped regionally as being folded into a broad anticline that 
strikes about 050 degrees, plunges gently to the northeast, and terminates to the southwest 
against the F3 fault.  A parallel syncline is mapped to the southeast in the lower member of 
the formation.  Most dips within the Sawayaerdun Formation are to the northwest, which 
suggests that these are overturned to the southeast.   

The Sawayaerdun Formation is structurally overlain to the southeast by the northeast 
dipping, Lower Carboniferous Bashisuogong Formation which is in turn structurally underlain 
to the southeast by the Middle Devonian-age Tuogemati Formation.     



 

18 | P a g e  
 

 

8. DEPOSIT TYPE 
 

The gold mineralization known to occur within the Property is considered to be shear-hosted 
or fracture-controlled, localized along major regional faults and related splays.  In this 
deposit type, sulphides are a relatively minor component.  The mineralization is related to 
broad areas of fracturing in which gold and sulphides may be associated with quartz veinlet 
networks or simply contained within the fractures themselves.   

Principal alteration mineralogy includes silicification, pyritization and potassium 
metasomatism, within broader zones of carbonaceous alteration including ferroan dolomite.      



 

19 | P a g e  
 

 

9. MINERALIZATION  
 

Zones I and IV are contained within the upper member of the Sawayaerdun Formation, 
trending northeast and crosscutting the stratigraphy at low angle and dipping generally 
steeply (60 to 80 degrees) to the northwest in conformity with the controlling structures.  The 
Zone IV mineralization is contained within the F3 fault that forms the contact between the 
upper Sawayaerdun Formation and the structurally overlying Taertekuli Formation.  The 
controlling structure and the contained mineralization continues to the northeast into 
Kyrgyzstan.   

The host rocks are heavily-sheared carbonaceous, sericitic phyllite and interbedded siltstone.  
Previous exploration, primarily surface trenching, by XBGMR and drilling by Majestic, traced 
mineralization in Zone IV for over seven kilometres, although mineralization is not 
continuous over that entire distance.  Zone I is shorter than Zone IV, being only 
approximately three kilometres long, and the alteration and gold/sulphide mineralisation less 
intense.  The zones both pinch and swell along strike and down-dip up to an apparent 
maximum thickness of more than 50 metres.     

Pyrite is the most-widely distributed sulphide in the mineralized zones and is accompanied 
by minor amounts of arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and stibnite.  Microscope studies of ore 
samples indicate that within the sulphide zone, gold occurs as micron-size grains of electrum, 
either in association with arsenopyrite or as free particles.  In the near-surface zone of 
oxidation, pyrite has been largely replaced by limonite.  Quartz, sericite, siderite, calcite and 
chlorite are commonly associated with gold.

10. EXPLORATION  
 

During 2010 and 2011, Tongyuan engaged the No.2 Brigade to carry out geological 
mapping, core drilling and underground development to acquire additional exploration data 
for Zones I and IV to enable a NI41โ101 compliant resource to be estimated.  This work was 
funded by GobiMin.  In 2010 and 2011 an aggregate of 127 holes were completed for 
around 38,000 metres within Zone I and Zone IV to verify the exploration results obtained by 
previous operators and to further explore the main deposits. 

Two adits with portals at the 3410 metre level (YD003 and YD004) and a fourth on the 3450 
metre level were developed during 2010 and 2011 to provide underground access to Zone 
IV for mapping, mining experience and detailed sampling, Figure 4.  Development of these 
adits will continue in 2012.

The exploration work carried out in 2010 and 2011 is considered by the Author to have been 
carried out in a manner consistent with industry standards and the results obtained are 
considered to be reliable.

11. DRILLING  
GobiMin drilled an aggregate of 127 diamond drill holes for more than 38,000 metres during 
2010 and 2011, Figure 5.  These holes were drilled to the southeast, perpendicular to strike 
and generally at 20 metre or 60 metre intervals along the strike of the zones and generally 
two or three holes were drilled on each section so as to intersect the zone at progressively 
greater depths down-dip.  The dip of the holes ranged from 60ยบ to 90ยบ; most were drilled at 
dips between 75ยบ and 85ยบ.  Holes were surveyed down the holes at 50 metre intervals as 
well as at the pierce points of the zone.

green, international border black, mineralised zones red.  (Jones, 2012) 

The holes penetrated the zones at a range of oblique angles so that the intercept thickness 
is in all cases greater than the true thickness.  However, the relatively large number of drill 
hole intercepts through the zone permits a good understanding of its morphology and the 
relationship between true and apparent thickness can be clearly demonstrated.

12. SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH  
The drill core was logged at the drill site and was then transported to the project camp site 
for sampling.  Only intervals logged by the geologist as potentially mineralized were sampled.  
Primary indicators of mineralization were the presence of one or more of pyrite, arsenopyrite, 
stibnite, silicification, sericitization, carbonatization and chloritization.  Where the core was 
competent it was sawn in half while the highly fractured intervals were sampled by hand.  
Half the core was bagged and submitted for analysis while the other half was retained on 
site for reference.  A total of 12,041 samples were collected from the core drilled by GobiMin 
during 2010 and 2011.  The assay population showed a typical log normal distribution that is 
typical for gold mineralization. 

 

Figure 6  Assay value frequency 

The gold mineralization is contained within a fault zone so much of the core is fractured, 
however recovery was high and the Author considers it improbable that any significant 
sample bias would have been introduced by loss of fine-grained material or other 
circumstance introduced by the fractured nature of the core.  The resultant assays are 
considered representative of the mineralization that was tested.    The sampled core was 
transported to the laboratory of the No. 2 Brigade in Kashgar (Kashi), Xinjiang for analysis.

13. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY  
In China the normal use of quality-assurance/ quality-control (QA/QC) measures such as 
standards, blanks and duplicates when collecting core samples is slightly different than 
required by NI43-101.  The Chinese standard similarly requires standards and duplicates as 
for NI43-101 however blanks to check for sample contamination during sample preparation 
at the laboratory are not normally used.  Consequently, GobiMin did not introduce any blank 
samples when sampling the Sawayaerdun drill core in 2010 however these blanks were 
included in all sample batches dispatched for chemical analysis in the 2011 drilling program.   

The assay laboratory included duplicate analyses of about 10% of the samples and a further 
about 5% of the same samples were sent to an outside laboratory for check sampling in both 
2010 and 2011.  The primary assaying was done at the No. 2 Brigade laboratory located in 
Kashgar (Kashi) during 2010 and at Urumqi in 2011.  The samples were only analyzed for 
gold.  Analyses were done using an activated carbon/foam absorption of dissolved gold in 
aqua regia after roasting technique.   Check assays of five percent (5%) of the samples were 
done by the Urumqi Mineral Resources Supervision and Assay Centre of the Land and 
Resources Ministry of China in Urumqi, Xinjiang.     

The Urumqi Mineral Resources Supervision and Assay Centre is ISO9001 certified and is 
also accredited by the China National Accreditation Centre for Conformity Assessment.  The 
laboratory of the No. 2 Brigade has not applied for ISO certification but does have a 
provincial certification.  The Author considers the sampling, sample preparation, security and 
analytical procedures to be adequate for the purpose of the resource estimate that follows.       



 

24 | P a g e  
 

 

14. DATA VERIFICATION  
GobiMin followed industry standard QA/QC measures during the 2011 drilling program.  As 
mentioned in the previous section, the primary and check assay laboratories also performed 
duplicate analyses on about 10% and 5% respectively of the sample population as required 
by government regulations.  In order for the analyses to meet government requirements the 
differences between duplicate means must be statistically insignificant.   

The Author had 40 pulps collected from the Brigade 2 laboratories over a spread of holes 
from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs which were sent to Genalysis Laboratories in 
Perth Western Australia for gold analysis using the fire assay method as a check against the 
Brigade 2 analyses.  These pulps were splits of the pulverised samples sent to the Brigade 2 
laboratory for analysis.  Although the Brigade 2 laboratory sample preparation techniques 
were not checked in this study, the repeatability of the assays were checked to detect if 
there is a bias in the assay methods used.  A comparison (XY scatter) plot of the check 
assays are displayed in Figure 7.  The correlation coefficient of the two sets of data is 0.9900 
which indicates a very high level of correlation between the two sets of assays and that there 
is no significant bias.

16. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING  
Xinjiang Minerals Research Institute conducted metallurgical testing of Sawayaerdun 
mineralization during 1996 and 1997.  A composite sample weighing 1,160 kilograms with an 
average grade of about 3.15 grams per tonne gold was collected from five trenches within 
Zone IV.  The material was subjected to various recovery methods including alkali pre-
treatment, roasting, arsenic-acid treatment and floatation, all followed by cyanidation.  
Recovery rates of gold from about 72% to 78% were achieved by these methods.  Acid 
leaching without cyanidation also produced similar rates of recovery, but over much longer 
periods.   

In 2005, Majestic collected a 678 kilogram sample comprised of two groups of material, one 
from surface trenches and the other comprised of coarse drill core reject material.  The 
sample was submitted to Process Research Associates (PRA) in Vancouver, Canada for 
testing.   

PRA made composites of the surface and drill core material, and each was subjected to 
cyanide leach, carbon-in-pulp extraction, and flotation plus cyanide extraction.  The trench 
material was variably oxidized while the core material was essentially unoxidized.  Gold 
recoveries varied with the degree of oxidation as summarized in Table 4.  

 

Extraction Method Trench Core 
Cyanide, no oxidation 54% <50% 
CIP after oxidation 75-80% 58% 
Floatation/oxidation/cyanide 87% 95-98% 

 

Table 4  PRA Metallurgical test gold recoveries 

 

In 2011 two sets of metallurgical gold recovery tests were done on representative samples of 
fresh sulphide ore from the underground workings in Zone IV by the Beijing General Institute 
of Mining and Metallurgy and the Processing Research Institute of XBGMR.  The results of 
these floatation and roasting tests are summarised in

Data Analysis  

Assays  

The Author received electronic data files for trench and drill hole locations, down-hole 
surveys and gold assays.  GobiMin also provided a topographic map of the Property in 
electronic format.  The data files included both current (2011) and historic (XBGMR, Majestic 
and Wardrop) data and therefore are assumed to represent as complete a record of assays 
from the Property as documentation permits.   

Descriptive statistics for the total assay population and individual sub-populations are 
presented below in Table 6.

  Composites  

Samples are composited (combined to a uniform length) to overcome the influence of 
variable sample length and thereby to make the influence of all samples comparable on the 
basis of length.  Almost 92% of the Sawayaerdun samples are one metre in length (17,109 
of a total of 18,606), therefore all samples were composited to one metre.

Capping  

The distribution of assay grades was examined for the existence of statistical outliers; i.e 
rare high assay values that are atypical of the assay population which if included in the 
resource estimate would distort the character of the sample population through the 
disproportionate contribution of the few high values.  A population that contains such outliers 
is termed "nuggety" and is typical of quartz-vein gold occurrences.  In such a case it is 
standard practice to cap the high values at some lower level that minimizes their potentially 
distorting effect.   

An analysis of Sawayaerdun 1m composited drill hole assay values >0.5g/t Au, i.e. wire-
framed assays, shows that about 30% of the aggregate gold content (sum of assays) resides 
in the top 10% of the sample population when the values are ranked from lowest to highest.  
When the top decile is subdivided into percentiles, the top percentile contains about 19% of 
the aggregate gold content (sum of assays), Table 7.  This grade distribution is characteristic 
of a log-normal gold ore population however the distribution of values is smoothly 
progressive from lowest to highest with no extreme steps in the grade distribution and 
extreme high grades, Figure 8.  The gold assay population is therefore not considered to be 
sufficiently nuggety to require capping.

Bulk Density  

GobiMin made a number of density measurements on samples of ore collected from 
trenches and drill core as follows:   

(1) Brigade 2 on 113 samples before 2007 

(2) Majestic on 572 samples for 2006 - 2007 

(3) Brigade 2 on 37 samples in 2010 

(4) Hanzhong Brigade on 41 samples in 2011 

The average of these measurements was 2.9 grams/centimetre3.  This value was used in 
this and previous Wardrop resource estimates.   

Geological Interpretation  

Zone I and Zone IV are interpreted as continuous shear zones that strike northeast and dip 
to the northwest at about 70ยบ.  The zones vary in width from less than 10 to up to 50 metres 
over their explored strike lengths but in the areas modelled for these resource estimates  
Zone I is generally inferred to be 10-20m wide and Zone IV 40-50 metres thick.  

    

The wire-framed solids used in these resource estimates were drawn as 0.5 g/t gold grade 
envelopes, the outer boundary of the zone was drawn to include as many as reasonable of 
the assays that equal or exceed 0.5 g/t gold so some minor internal waste, i.e. <0.5g/t Au, 



 

31 | P a g e  
 

was included in the wire-frames to include the higher grade outliers.  Although the fault that 
contains the gold no doubt continues along strike beyond the modelled limits of the zone, the 
geological solid was terminated to the northeast and southwest at 20m beyond the last drill 
intercept that could reasonably be assumed to be part of the zone.  Vertically, the zone was 
extrapolated to the topographic surface however the grades were not modelled within the 
wireframes beyond the search ellipses described later in this report.

Interpolation  Plan  
Resources were interpolated using Inverse Distance Squared (ID2) and Inverse Distance to 
the Third Power (ID3).  ID2 interpolation produces a smoother, less poddy model than ID3 by 
applying less weight to the nearest sample to the block being interpolated, i.e. there is more 
blending of the grades.   An ID2 model is more appropriate for bulk mining or underground 
mining where the ore is poddy and less predictable making selective mining of high grade 
pods less feasible. 

Trench samples and diamond core samples within 10m of the topographic surface were only 
interpolated within the top 10m to create an Oxide model.  All diamond core samples below 
10m of the topographic surface were not interpolated above the -10m surface to create a 
separate sulphide model.

Mineral Resource Classification 

Grade interpolation was carried out in one pass using a search ellipse 20m (X) x 200m (Y) x 
200m (Z).    The modelled cells within 50m of sample intervals were considered to be 
Indicated resources while the remaining modelled cells out to 200m from sample intervals 
were considered to be Inferred resources.

The block model was validated both visually against the drilling results on cross sections and 
by comparison of the outcomes of the two interpolation methods.   Figure 13 below is a 
typical cross section through Zone IV allowing a comparison of the drilling intercepts with the 
block model.

20. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  
Trenching and drilling by GobiMin during 2010 and 2011 has confirmed the nature and 
extent of gold mineralization within both Zone I and Zone IV as defined by earlier exploration 
programs.  The current level of exploration supports the classification of resources within 
both Zone I and Zone IV as Indicated and Inferred.   

A portion of the Zone IV contains more high grade mineralization than the remaining portions 
of the zone, termed "Target" for this report, Figure 14.  This portion of Zone IV also appears 
to be the thickest portion of the zone and therefore may represent a flexure or dilation zone 
within the F3 fault that contains Zone IV.  A subset of the total resource is provided in Table 
11 at a 0.5g/t Au lower cut-off base case.

base case 

Once the underground exploration of the deposit is completed, it is probable that those 
portions explored underground could be upgraded into the Measured category.  
Underground exploration would also provide information regarding ground conditions that 
would assist with mine design as well as provide material for metallurgical testing.   

The Author considers that the 2010-2011 GobiMin exploration program was successful in 
confirming previous exploration results and in providing a higher level or assurance for the 
resources in the widest portion of the Zone that had previously existed.  At a 0.5 g/t lower 
threshold, all of Zone IV is currently estimated to contain ID2 Indicated resources of 
approximately 52.5 million tonnes with an average grade of 1.3 g/t gold and Inferred 
resources of 43.8 million tonnes with an average grade of 1.1 g/t gold, Table 12.

21. RECOMMENDATIONS  
The following program of exploration for 2012 is recommended in order to upgrade the 
resource estimates and to obtain a better understanding of the mining and metallurgical 
characteristics of the mineralization:   

1. Core drilling: 30,000 metres @US$175/metreโฆโฆโฆโฆโฆโฆโฆ..โฆโฆโฆ US$5,250,000
