1.0 SUMMARY 

Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd. ("DMBW") has prepared this report at the 
request of PEDIMENT EXPLORATION LIMITED, ("Pediment") of Vancouver. Pediment 
are required to file a Technical Report on their San Antonio District gold property in Baja 
California Sur ("BCS"), Mexico, in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set 
forth in Canadian National Instrument 43-101. 

The Qualified Persons responsible for this report are Ian S. Thompson, P.Eng., President of 
DMBW, and Dave Laudrum, P.Geo. of Ashloo Consultants Ltd., who is responsible for the 
estimation of resources on the Los Planes and the Las Colinas gold deposits. 

The property consists of six exploration concessions staked and 100% owned by Pediment, 
through its wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Compania Minera Pitalla S.A. de C.V; these 
cover 37,800 hectares (ha), representing an additional 14 km of favourable geological trend. 

The SAN ANTONIO PROPERTY is located next to the historic mining town of San Antonio 
and about 45 km southeast by paved Highway No. 1 from the port city of La Paz. Historic 
production of about 115,000 ounces of gold was reported from numerous small mines over the 
period 1862 to 1915. 

Echo Bay Exploration Inc. ("EBX") explored the general property area from 1994 to1997 at the 
same time that they were exploring the Paredones Amarillos deposit (55.6 MT at 1.05g/t Au), 
20 km south. EBX outlined a non-NI 43-101 compliant, historic resource at Las Colinas, using 
data from 16 holes and 5 trenches. The current Pediment concessions contain this deposit. The 
deposits on the San Antonio project are classified as "Shear Zone Gold Deposits". The shear 
zones are generally within crystalline metamorphic or igneous rock. 

Pediment has carried out a program of mapping, prospecting, trenching, soil geochemical and 
Induced Polarization (IP) surveys from 2005 to 2007 over two main concessions. This has 
resulted in further in fill drilling at Colinas and the drill-discovery of a new deposit "Los Planes" 
about 600 m north and on structural trend. 

Los Planes was outlined (from June to December 13, 2007) by 75 vertical, Reverse Circulation, 
5.5 inch diameter ("RC") holes, totaling 14,981 m, completed by Layne Christiansen Drilling 
Co. of Hermosillo. 

At Las Colinas a total of 5 east-dipping 5 HQ core holes (823 m), were drilled by Pediment using 
a Longyear 44 rig, by Diamond Drilling Specialists, of New Mexico. 

The main mineralized body is confined to a cataclasite (mylonite) unit, varying from 25-35 m 
wide at Las Colinas. At Los Planes, several sub parallel cataclasite zones form a broad zone up 
to 100 m wide. This unit strikes about north-south and dips about 45-50 degrees west in both 
deposits. The Planes zone is best developed to a vertical depth of about 225m (50m ASL), or 
315m down the dip; the Colinas zone to a depth of about 150 m.

Resources 

The current National Instrument 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimates for the Los 
Planes ("Planes") and Las Colinas ("Colinas") zones on Pediment's San Antonio project were 
completed by Dave Laudrum of Ashloo Consultants Ltd., under contract to DMBW, using 
GEMS Software Version 6.1.3, from Gemcom Software International. The resource is reported 
based on cut-off grades and economic considerations provided by Ian S. Thompson of DMBW in 
Section 18.0 of this report. 

Based on the parameters described in this report DMBW has estimated an Inferred Mineral 
Resource, as at December 31, 2007, for the Los Planes deposit of 30.58 million tonnes at an 
average grade of 1.32 g/t Au, using a 0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade. In addition DMBW has estimated 
an Inferred Mineral Resource for the Las Colinas deposit of 5.62 million tonnes at an average
grade of 0.83 g/t Au, using a 0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade.

(1) It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an 
Indicated or Measured Resource as a result of continued exploration. 

(2)    Mineral Resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
(3) Numbers may not add up, due to rounding. 
(4) 'Oxidized' refers here to rock affected by oxidation including weak-moderate-strong intensities. 

At the current level of drilling there are well defined geological and grade domains at both 
deposit areas. These domains show good vertical and lateral continuity and were used as hard 
boundaries when interpolating grades into the block models. 

For Planes high-grade assays were capped at 30 g/t Au, although this capping level only affected 
4 assay samples. No high-grade assay capping was applied at Colinas where the highest assay 
returned from the zone was 5.71 g/t Au. Density values of 2.7 for sulphide mineralization and 2.6 
for oxide mineralization were used for both Planes and Colinas. Grades were interpolated by 
Ordinary Kriging. Search Ellipse and variogram ranges used were 65 m (along strike) x 65 m 
(down dip) x 25 m (across strike/dip). 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 7 

For this initial resource estimate all mineralization at Planes and Colinas has been classified as 
Inferred. Current drill spacing on individual x-sections often approaches 25 metre centres (down 
dip), while the spacing between currently drilled x-sections is generally 50 metres (along strike). 

Recommended Program and Budget 

DMBW recommends a further program of 10,000 metres of infill vertical Reverse Circulation 
('RC') and Core drilling at Planes in 2008 on a 50 x 50 metre grid to expand the inferred 
resource base, if possible, as a precursor to closer-spaced drilling. Further IP surveys are also 
recommended. In addition, as Pediment has noted and DMBW concurs, a Preliminary Economic 
Assessment ("PEA") should be undertaken. 
The above recommended program is estimated to cost US $1,962,000. 

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

This report has been prepared to satisfy the obligation of PEDIMENT EXPLORATION 
LIMITED, ("Pediment") of Vancouver, to file a Technical Report on their San Antonio District 
gold property in the Baja Peninsula, Mexico, in compliance with disclosure and reporting 
requirements set forth in Canadian National Instrument 43-101.

The Qualified Persons responsible for this report are Ian S. Thompson, P.Eng., President of 
DMBW, and Dave Laudrum, P.Geo. of Ashloo Consultants Ltd., an independent consulting 
geologist retained by DMBW. Dave Laudrum prepared the Mineral Resource Estimates 
presented in Section 17 of this report. The resource is reported based on cut-off grades and 
economic considerations provided by Ian S. Thompson in Section 18.0 of this report. Thompson 
visited the property, near La Paz, Baja California Sur, and the offices of Pediment's wholly-
owned Mexican subsidiary, Compania Minera Pitalla, S.A. de C.V., located in Hermosillo, 
Sonora, during the period December 12 to 17, 2007. 

The property comprises the currently-explored Los Planes gold deposit, as well as the Las 
Colinas gold deposit, which is located 600 m to the south and on trend. 

The objective of this report is to estimate initial NI 43-101-Compliant Resources for both the 
new Los Planes deposit and the historic Las Colinas gold deposit. This is the first Qualifying 
Report on the San Antonio District properties since 2004 and thus covers exploration from 2005 
through 2007. 

For Los Planes ("Planes") the data comprises Reverse Circulation ("RC") drilling data from the 
Pediment's drilling program, which began in March, 2007. The resource estimate includes the 
assay data from those 75 RC holes completed by December 31, 2007. Core drilling was also 
initiated in late 2007 and geology/assay logs of five holes on Planes completed in January, 2008, 
were available to aid in correlations.  

Pediment has continued the program of exploration RC drilling at Los Planes in 2008, however, 
any additional geological logs and acceptable assays (having passed the company's Quality 
Assurance and Quality Control measures) were not available at the time of writing this report. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 8 

At Las Colinas HQ type Core and Hydro-Winke NQ type core drilling was also undertaken in 
2007, prior to the discovery and delineation of Los Planes. The Los Planes discovery was 
subsequently made by partial completion with the same drill of three core holes and one 
additional Hydro-Winke drill hole. The balance of the geological and assay data is provided in a 
digital version of summary logs and complete assays from the 1998 Echo Bay Exploration 
(EBX) program report. 

There are other gold-bearing target areas, such as Fandango and La Virgen, which have been 
investigated by Pediment Exploration and by a contractor geophysical survey on the property. 
(See Exploration Section 10) 

Unless otherwise stated all units used in this report are metric. Gold assays are reported in grams 
Au per tonne (g Au/t), or ppm Au, unless ounces are specifically stated. Grades of silver are 
reported in ppm Ag. Currencies are US Dollars, or Mexican Pesos, as indicated.  

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

The authors have relied on the documents listed in the References and the site visit(s) for the 
information in this report, however, the conclusions and recommendations are ours. We have 
assumed that all of the information and technical documents listed in the References section of 
the report are accurate and complete in all material aspects; however, the accuracy and 
completeness of the data cannot be guaranteed. 

Portions of Sections 4.0 to 9.0 are reproduced from an earlier NI 43-101 report by R. Wallis, 
P.Geo. of Roscoe Postle Associates. (RPA -2004) 

Portions of Sections 6.0 and 7.0 are reproduced from an earlier publication of Northwest Mining 
Association presentation in 1998 by Brown, Reynolds, and Hauck III. 

Portions of Section 10.0 are reproduced from an internal exploration report by J.E. Stephens, 
P.Geo. and by data and commentary by J.Reynolds of Durango Geophysical Operations. 

The results and opinions in this report are dependent upon the information provided being 
current, accurate and complete. No information has been withheld that would impact the 
conclusions or recommendations made. 

DMBW has relied on Cia. Minera Pitalla and Pediment for providing information regarding: 
current status of legal title, property boundaries, property agreements and environmental matters. 

DMBW has examined a document from the Direccion General de Minas listing the Minera 
Pitalla title document numbers and the concession names, as well as semesters that the 
concessions have been renewed semi-annually, from inception in 2003 through 2007. 

The original concessions covering the explored area were the CIRIO and EMILY concession, 
which were filed by Pitalla in 2003, and title was subsequently granted by the Mexican Federal 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 9 

Government. The agreement between El Dragon LLC and Skinny in 2005 resulted in the full 
acquisition of Pitalla, including these concessions held by Pitalla.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The SAN ANTONIO PROPERTY is located on the Baja Peninsula, Mexico, adjacent to the 
historic mining town of San Antonio and about 45 km southeast by paved Highway No.1 from 
the port city of La Paz, population (170,000) and about 160 km north of the resort town of Cabo 
San Lucas. Good gravel roads traverse most of the project area and a 115 kV power line passes 
through San Antonio. The road crossing the deposit area is currently being paved with 
simultaneous installation of 80 kva electric power line. 

The property consists of six exploration concessions staked and 100% owned by Pediment, 
through its wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Cia. Minera Pitalla S.A. de C.V., that cover 
37,800 hectares (ha) and an additional 14 km of favorable geological trend. 

DMBW reviewed the title documents for two of the concessions which indicated that the 
property taxes have been paid for the current period ending September 30, 2007. On the TRINI 
concession the license has not yet been received, but DMBW has read the Letters of Application 
and their receipt by the Mining department. At the current exchange rate of 0.10, the yearly taxes 
are about US $15,300. The concessions are listed in Table 4.1 and their location relative to La 
Paz is shown in Figure 4.1. 

DMBW observed and photographed a common Discovery Monument for EMILY, CIRIO and 
TRINI, located at UTM 0597728E; 2638467N (NAD 27 Mexico). This lies next to the main NE-
SW gravel road to San Antonio village passing just east of the EMILY concession. 

The properties were originally held by Cia. Minera Pitalla. Skinny Technologies Ltd., the 
predecessor company of Pediment, issued 5,000,000 shares in 2004 to acquire all the outstanding 
shares of El Dragon Minerals LLC, which company then owned 100% of the issued shares of 
Cia. Minera Pitalla. Melvin Herdrick, Vice President Exploration and a Director of Pediment, is 
the majority shareholder in El Dragon. This company owned six properties, five in Sonora and 
the Las Colinas property in Baja California Sur. Additional bonus shares of Pitalla, totaling 
2,500,000, were to be issued to the original shareholders of El Dragon, should a minimum of 
1,000,000 ounces of gold be found on three or less of the properties; also one of these properties 
needed to contain a minimum 500,000 ounces of gold. This agreement is still in effect. There are 
no underlying royalties according to Pediment.

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE, PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The San Antonio Property is accessed by good gravel and dirt roads which traverse most of the 
project area. Electrical and telephone service is available easily in most parts of the region. 
Water is available as developed domestic and irrigation wells, although there is partial restriction 
of new water well development regulated by Comision Nacional de Agua, the Mexican Federal 
Government's water regulation and management agency. 

The climate is normally arid and hot, with an average temperature of 23ºC, and average lows of 
12ºC and highs of 35ºC. Precipitation averages 170 mm, much of it associated with hurricane 
systems occurring during the period August and September. Vegetation consists of numerous 
varieties of thorny desert cacti, small shrubs and bushes, including manzanilla, mesquite, and 
palo verde. At the time of my visit, the rainy season was just ending and the desert was quite 
green and thick with vegetation. 

Local labour is available in the nearby towns of San Antonio, Los Planes and the much larger 
city of La Paz. The capital city, La Paz, of Baja California Sur with a population of about 
170,000, is serviced by daily flights from the United States and other cities in Mexico. Electric 
power is readily available with a 115 kV power line passing through San Antonio. 

The northern part of the property consists of nearly flat "pediment" gravels and sands which 
slope away from mountainous areas and all of which incline gently northeastward towards the 
Sea of Cortez. Several deeper internal basins, now filled, make up part of the flat gravel covered 
area. 

The central part of the property is characterized by rounded hills, "Las Colinas" rising from the 
pediment with elevations ranging from 200 m to 250 m above sea level (ASL). The southern and 
western part is more rugged with elevations from 400 m to 600 m ASL. 

Electrical and telephone service is available easily in most parts of the region. Water is available 
as developed domestic and irrigation use with partial restriction of new water well development.

5.1 Community Consultation  

Although land tenure for mineral rights is acquired through the National Government, the local 
communal farming areas, or "ejidos" own in common the surface rights to the lands near their 
villages. Pitalla's social and community efforts in the San Antonio area have been excellent. 

Surface access agreements with the Procuraduria Agraria office in Sonora, (paid on an annual 
basis to the local ejidos) allow for either "low impact" exploration i.e. prospecting, soil and rock 
sampling and hand trenching, or "transition", i.e. road building, mechanical trenching, drilling, 
with higher cash payments. There are two ejidos: the San Antonio ejido and the San Luis ejido. 

SAN LUIS – this ejido comprises about 1000 ha of surface rights in the exploration area and is 
owned mainly by one family group in the NE part of the CIRIO and the adjacent TRINI 
concession. The San Luis ejido has more extensive irrigation farmed areas southeast of Los 
Planes pueblo. 

SAN ANTONIO – this ejido is a very old farm holding dating from 1919 and comprising 10,846 
hectares. This covers the south half of CIRIO; the last anniversary of the Temporary Surface 
Occupation Permit was November 8, 2007. A total of US $20,000 was paid prior to this date and 
annual payments are US $16,000; the expiry is November 2009. There are no work commitments 
and all types of exploration are permitted except mining. Exploration companies are encouraged 
to use ejido workers whenever possible. Pitalla, accordingly, have hired all staff from these 
ejidos and have consulted with these local village councils on all aspects of exploration; jobs are 
relatively high paying for the local communities and are thus sought after. 

San Antonio and the nearby villages of El Triunfo, 7 km west, while now farming communities, 
were important gold and silver producing centers respectively, over the last two centuries and in 
the past 20 years were again mine exploration focused. There is a strong community interest in 
the benefits of resuming mining activity. Numerous residents of these two communities continue 
to be active with small scale gambusino production with limited leaching of gold on ore taken 
back to the pueblo area. 

5.2 Environmental 

At this drilling stage there are routine permits required prior to drilling; the maximum disturbed 
areas per hole are 720 sq.m. for a core hole and 768 sq.m. for an RC hole. The allowance for 
roads is 7% of the area tested. The relevant authority is NOM (Norma Official Mexicana) and 
the environmental agency, SEMARNAT, is located in La Paz. The Mexican federal government 
regulations (NOM 120-ECOL) were gazetted in 1997, 1998 and 2005. 

Pitalla reported that overall less than 10% of the area has been disturbed and there are no 
environmental liabilities arising from previous explorers.

6.0 MINING HISTORY 

6.1 General 

Gold and silver mineralization was discovered around 1748 and rapidly began limited small 
scale production mainly in the Triunfo area and south of San Antonio. Don Manuel del Ocio in 
1748 began exploiting veins of Real de Minas de Santa Ana which towns later were named San 
Antonio and Triunfo. Jesuits and various French historical connections have been reported to be 
part of this mining history. A long period of inactivity followed until about 1862 when 25 mines 
were reported as working (CRM Baja California Sur Monograph, 2000). These mines produced 
steadily until 1895 when due to a large cyclone-hurricane, water problems and prices lead to a 
steady decline to 1915, after which the district was no longer active. Total production is 
estimated at over 3580 kg of gold (115,000 oz) and 661 tons of silver (21,250,000 oz Ag), plus 
lead and zinc. Recent production is high-lighted by Minera Tepmin in the Testera Mine south of 
San Antonio. Tepmin operated in about 1998-2000 at an intermittent rate of about 50 tons per 
day with a flotation mill. 

Old pits and shallow shafts (artisanal workings) have been noted on the both the CIRIO and 
EMILY Concessions. The government geological branch, Consejo De Recursos Minerales 
(CRM), now Servicio Geologico Mexicano, carried out work in the 1970s consisting of mapping, 
trenching and limited magnetic and Induced Polarization (IP) surveys which covered portions of 
the Las Colinas gold deposit.

Pitalla report that "Placer gold has been investigated in three areas by CRM where limited 
gambusino activity has defined accumulations mostly southwest of the Triunfo and San Antonio 
districts. The three areas are described as belonging to either of two types, alluvial or proluvial. 
The alluvial is typical gold accumulation by clastic separation in mechanical erosion, while the 
proluvial involves alluvial deposition with lateritic processes to concentrate further the deposited 
gold in sediments. The two alluvial deposits are closer to the sources of the gold districts, while 
the proluvial deposit is further west and covers an area estimated at 80 square km. Grades of both 
types are indicated to range from very low to over 2 grams per ton." 

Echo Bay Exploration Inc. (EBX) acquired the concession in the mid-1990s at the same time that 
they were exploring the Paredones Amarillos joint venture, 20 km south. (See Section 8) 
Information on the EBX exploration program is found in the public documents listed in the 
Reference section and also on the Company's website. 

EBX carried out detailed geological mapping, stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling, 
trenching, ground electromagnetics, radio metrics and VLF-EM surveys, airborne magnetics, RC 
drilling and metallurgical studies. The radiometric survey is reported to have indicated an 
anomalous potassium and K/Th ratio response associated with the Las Colinas mineralization.

6.2 Colinas Gold Deposit  replace this with newer ? 

Fig.6.2.1) (modified from PRA fig 7) shows the (Colinas) drill hole locations and IP results.
Two cross sections, one through the centre of the mineralized body (Section 38,500N) and one to 
the north (39,600N) illustrating the continuation of the mineralization, are shown as Fig.6.2.2 
and 6.2.3.(Figures 9 and 10 RPA) respectively." 

"The cataclasite is a relative conductor compared to the diorite and granodiorite. A close 
correlation between the increased polarization response and the sulphides containing the gold 
mineralization was noted. The IP survey was run using 100 m dipole spacing on lines spaced 
200 m apart. Additional lines to the north were run using 50 m dipoles on 200 m line spacing. 
Echo Bay concluded that the IP was successful in outlining the mineralization that was still open 
to the north beyond the IP coverage. Incomplete results from a soil survey also suggest a 
continuation of the mineralization to the north. Drill holes SA97- 120 and -123 confirm the 
extension of the mineralization to the north."(Brown 1998). 

6.3 Historic Estimate 1996-Colinas Deposit 

An independent estimate of the Las Colinas deposit was carried out for Echo Bay by a geologist 
(Kuyper 1996), using the data from 16 holes and 5 trenches. He estimated a "geological gold 
resource" of 2.74 MT at a grade of 1.0 g/t Au, using a cross-sectional method and extending 
mineralization a maximum distance of 25 m from the intercept and a maximum sectional width 
of 50 m. A specific gravity of 2.7 was used. No gold values were cut, as no assays exceeded 
34 g/t Au. 

Projecting mineralization 50 m up and down-dip and allowing a sectional width of up to 100 m, 
he estimated a resource of 6.84 MT @ 1.02g/t gold. At EBX's request he also estimated a 
incremental resource of 3.76MT @1.01 g/t, by extending the zone a further 200 m down-dip. 
The total and average of the latter two resources is 10.6MT @ 1.02g/t. This estimate was 
published by EBX (Brown, 1998) and has been reported in Pediment's Website under the 
caption "San Antonio project-Las Colinas deposit". 

The estimates have not been verified by a QP as required by NI 43-101. They are considered 
historical resources that are not compliant with NI 43-101 and are reported for informational 
purposes only. 

Kuyper noted that "the deposit was open along strike in both directions and down-dip; however, 
with its low grade and moderately steep dip to the west, the zone would be mineable for only 60 
to 80 metres down-dip".  

EBX carried out additional drilling in 1997, primarily to the north of the resource. The data 
available had been expanded to 31 RC holes totaling 6085.5 m. This drilling intercepted several 
intersections of mineralization confirming that the mineralized trend continued to the north and 
included Hole SA 97-112, which eventually became the discovery hole for the Planes deposit 
(reference Section 10). No further resource estimates were made. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 15 

The EBX geological, assay and survey data were recently compiled in digital format by Pitalla 
and a current resource estimate, including the 2007 RC and Core drill hole data, is described 
separately by Dave Laudrum in Section 17. 

6.4 Wallis (RPA 2004) 

This property was the subject of an independent technical report by Stewart Wallis, P.Geo. of 
RPA Associates in June 2004. His report, which described all of the properties in Mexico held by 
Skinny Technologies Inc., the predecessor company of Pediment, included a review of Las 
Colinas. He did not verify the database but noted that "the EBX interpretation extended the 
mineralization on most sections no more than100 m from a drill hole intercept". He also noted 
that "approximately 15% of the deposit lay on the adjoining Texcalama Concession to the south 
that was not owned by Pitalla". (Pitalla report that this ownership has not changed.) 

Wallis reported that "The early mining in both districts was focused on oxidized high-sulphide, 
high-grade gold-silver veins ranging in width of up to 3 m, with strike lengths of nearly 2 km. 
The Triunfo veins strike north-northeast and possibly converge with the north-south trending San 
Antonio vein system on the Las Colinas Property north of the currently defined mineralization."

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING  

7.1  Regional Geology 

The crystalline complex west of the La Paz fault which includes the San Antonio district is 
composed of two separate intrusive complexes hosted in limited schist and gneiss of sedimentary 
rock origin. These schist and gneissic rocks represent moderate levels of metamorphism prior to 
the time of mineralization, and prior to the igneous rocks because none of the igneous rocks 
show similar degrees of dynamic regional metamorphism. The age of the original sedimentary 
rocks is thought to be Late Paleozoic to Mid Mesozoic. 

The hornblende rich intrusive complex ranges in composition from gabbro, quartzdiorite. It 
intrudes the metamorphic units and locally shows foliation. The coarse grained biotite 
hornblende quartz diorite is the most common rock type present in the Planes deposit. A similar 
appearing coarse grained weakly foliated biotite granodiorite is present in the Triunfo district, 
but may not be part of the same intrusive complex. Hornblende from the hornblende gabbro near 
Paredones is dated at 129 ma (plus or minus 5) (Brown, et. al 1998). (Refer to Figure 7.1) 

Study of the Uvares gold deposit, located between Paredones and Planes-Colinas revealed age 
dates of hornblende from a tonalite of 137 ma (plus or minus 6) and on diorite of 128 ma (plus or 
minus 5) (Carrillo-Chavez 1998). He also determined that the batholith cooled at around 100 to 
90 ma and the hydrothermal activity had ended by 80 ma. Many radiometric determinations were 
completed as well as others from the area summarized. 

Limited sampling with whole rock major element analysis revealed the biotite granodiorite 
batholith of Valle Perdido that forms the footwall adjacent to the Paredones gold deposit is of 
peraluminous composition, having a high alumina content in ratio to the alkali elements. 
Additional dikes and sills of similar composition near the gold deposits are probably related to 
that batholith (Herdrick, 1998). The age of the Valle Perdido batholith was radiometric age dated 
with 91.3 (plus or minus 2.3) from biotite separates. 

Age of sericite from the Paredones deposit was also determined by radiometric analyses in two 
samples with 91.3 ma in one and the second at 79.1 ma. It is expected that the age of gold 
mineralization through the district is within this same time range, including Los Planes and Las 
Colinas. Two post mineral andesitic to dacitic dikes are present at Paredones revealed a 
radiometric determined age of 74.5 ma. (Brown, et. al. 1998) 

The close spatial position of the Triunfo and San Antonio districts suggests a possible 
connection. The two districts host mineralization in the same rock units; however the 
geochemical signature of the two districts is very different. San Antonio is a gold- mineralized 
district with gold-silver ratios of 1:1 while Triunfo is silver dominated. The trend of the 
mineralized shear zones at Triunfo is generally north 20-30 east, and they are similar in character 
to the San Antonio shear zones. The latter have a persistent north-south strike and even although 
the shear zones are low-angle, the mineralization appears to end down-dip, and possibly away 
from high- angle source structures.

Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 21 

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

Mel Herdrick, V.P. Exploration and a director of Pitalla, has provided the following description: 

"Geology in and around the gold deposits is determined from the drilling because of sand and 
gravel pediment cover. The deposits are contained in a large mega shear structure, possibly a 
Mesozoic age thrust fault dipping about 45 degrees westerly. This mega-shear appears to be 
regional in extent, with strands and splays that may have been more favourable for 
mineralization, which coalesce in one zone at Planes. (Figure 7.2) 

However the drilling at Planes and Colinas shows the thickness of the shear zone to be more than 
200 metres hosted in mid-level intrusive rocks of similar age to the shearing episode. This, and 
the presence of the structure for 40 km to the south, suggest more likely that the shear zone is a 
thrust fault related structure. Drilling at Planes has shown a very thick shear zone often with a 
change from coarse grained biotite-hornblende quartz diorite in the hangingwall to a fine to 
medium grained biotite granodiorite in the footwall. In the Colinas deposit, diorite to gabbro is 
found irregularly in both hangingwall and footwall parts of the mega-shear zone. The strike 
length of the shear zone through both Planes and Colinas is about 3 km, with mapping by Echo 
Bay indicating extension at least several km more to the south. 

Drilling has also revealed that a small northwest trending graben basin, probably Pleistocene age, 
with true listric faulting drops the northeastern part of the Planes deposit in domino like fault 
segments to sequentially more than 200 metres deeper to the northeast. Geophysical work 
consisting of both limited gravity and IP lines has been completed to determine the local extent 
of deeper parts of this basin. Sediment filling associated with the pediment development of the 
area consists of mainly sandy gravel produced by weathering breakdown of the local 
granodiorite and quartz diorite igneous rocks. Possibly this basin is still structurally active 
dropping in recent time. The top surface of the pediment has numerous scattered cobbles and 
occasional boulders, which appear to have been moved by erosion from further west, where 
schist and gneiss are more common. In several geological reports of the region the formal name 
for this young basin filling is Salada Formation. (Aranda-Gomez and Perez-Venzor, 1989) 

Surface oxidation of the sulphide bearing deposits has progressed to about 100 metres in the 
Planes deposit and about 25-30 metres in the Colinas deposit. It is reported that the Paredones 
deposit further south has only about 5-10 metres of oxidation. The reason for the depth of 
oxidation being greater at Planes is probably due to several causes. One is the covering of the 
deposit by pediment that removed it from active erosion. Much of the oxidized material is very 
soft due to the leaching of sulphides and probably would have eroded easily if exposed. Second 
factor in the depth of oxidation is the breakage of the deposit by the young listric faulting 
episode associated with the graben basin formation. The faulting opened the rock to more 
oxygen carried by sub-surface waters with a deeper water table flow route developed."

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Los Planes and Las Colinas 

The current model for the gold mineralization at Los Planes and Las Colinas is similar to that 
described at the nearby Paredones Amarillos deposit, 55.6 MMT grading 1.05 g/t Au (Snowden, 
2003), and other deposits, including the Mesquite Mine in California (194 MMT grading 
0.62 g/t, 2006) and La Herradura, 49.4 MMT, grading 1.06 g/t Au in Sonora, México (Penoles 
1998). The latter two are classified as Sonoran Megashear gold deposits. The general description 
is included in the name, Shear Zone Gold deposits, as used by Gibson et.al. (1996) and Brown 
et.al. (1998). The shear zones are generally within crystalline metamorphic or igneous rock of 
moderate to low grade metamorphism. Peraluminous intrusives related to anatectic metamorphic 
processes are usually important parts of the geology of these deposits. (See Section 9.0 for 
additional discussion of deposit model). 

Wallis (2004) describes it below: 
Figure 7 illustrates a conceptual model. The mineralization is associated with both shallow 
dipping shear zones and high-angle structures that are the probable conduits of mineralization 
originating from the peraluminous granodiorites which have intruded the basement metamorphic 
rocks. These mineralizing conduits have deposited precious metal mineralization in shallow 
dipping shear zones that are occupied by cataclasite and mylonite. Alteration is dominated by 
sericite with lesser amounts of quartz, sulphides and potassium feldspar. Refer to Fig 8.1 

8.2 Paredones Amarillos 

An abbreviated description of this gold deposit is taken from the Mine Development Associates 
('MDA') summary in their feasibility study of Paredones Amarillos in June 2007. The published 
reserves and resources are: 
Reserves: 48,496,000 tonnes @ 1.01gAu/t (cutoff grade 0.38 gAu/t) base case  
Resources: 11,498,000 tonnes @1.17gAu/t measured 
  44,170,000 tonnes @1.02g/Au/t indicated 
   5,495,000 tonnes @0.79gAu/t inferred 

"The main ore host is a 10 to 80 metre thick, north-east to east-west striking, 15 degrees to 45 
degrees, southeast-dipping cataclasite and mylonite unit. Main stage gold mineralization is 
associated with the cataclasis and mylonitization event. The cataclasite is a dense, competent 
rock composed of approximately 50% crushed quartz and feldspar fragments in a matrix of 
sericite and minor chlorite and fine-grained quartz. 

In the field, the term cataclasite is used for any tectonized, brecciated, pervasively sericite altered 
rock, in which no primary intrusive textures are preserved. Though this is technically an 
alteration description, through usage on the project it has been adopted as the cataclasite 
description. The hanging wall contact with the cataclasite is generally sharp, but the footwall 
contact may be gradational over several tens of metres with strongly fractured and sericitized 
granodiorite grading to fresh granodiorite. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 24 

Gold grade at Paredones Amarillos generally varies directly with the abundance of sulphides. 
The important sulphides are pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, and minor marcasite and 
chalcopyrite. However, not all high-sulphide rock carries high gold values." 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 25 

9.0 MINERALIZATION  

9.1 Los Planes and Las Colinas 

Pitalla have described it in internal memos as:

"Mineralization at Las Colinas and Los Planes is very similar, with the exceptions of the 
dimensions of the mineralized bodies and level of oxidation. The main mineralized body is 
confined to a cataclasite unit that varies in width from 25 to 35 metres at Las Colinas. At Los 
Planes, there are several sub parallel cataclasite zones that together form a broad zone that is up 
to 100 metres in width. The cataclasite unit has a roughly north-south strike and dips about 45 
degrees to the west in both Las Colinas and Los Planes. Coyan et al. (2007) interpreted that 
cataclasite was a good host for mineralization because of its highly fractured nature, but 
mineralization is not restricted to the cataclasite. Instead mineralization and alteration occur in 
many rock types, as long as brittle fractures are present. Typically, the cataclasite contains a zone 
where sulphides increase with abundance as high as 20%. Pyrite appears more commonly 
throughout the system; however main mineralization is seen with an increase of arsenopyrite and 
pyrite in addition to pyrrhotite. Sulphides are present in brittle structures including cracks, faults, 
joints and micro-fractures. Pyrite lines the walls of many fractures and joints as observed from 
core and outcrop. Quartz veining is also common (Coyan et al. 2007). The alteration goes from 
chlorite dominant around the cataclasite and changes to sericite-dominant within the cataclasite 
unit. Chemically, the system has low silver relative to gold, having Ag/Au ratio of around 0.4. 
Gold is also accompanied by anomalous As, Cu, and Bi. 

Some mineralized zones are believed by Pediment to be controlled by sub-vertical structures. 
The level of oxidation at Las Colinas extends only a few metres vertically from surface; however 
oxidation at Los Planes is much deeper, reaching as much as 100 metres from surface." 

Pitalla have recently located and summarized the Colinas drill logs, however there is no specific 
description in the logs of an oxide zone; except a numeric indicator of the "type of oxidation", 
i.e. mineralogy, throughout the entire hole, rather than the degree of oxidation. (See Resources 
Section 17)

10.0 EXPLORATION BY PITALLA  2005- 2007 

10.1 General 

Exploration work in the area started in 2005 with contracting a structural and chemical on site 
review by Stan Keith of Magmachem Exploration which is quoted from the Magmachem web 
site as follows: 

Sonora-Baja California Mexico Peraluminous Gold Reconnaissance – Minera Pitalla, 
February 2004 to Present  

• Analysis of existing MagmaChem and Minera Pitalla data followed by a field reconnaissance 
has established the presence of a major cluster of peraluminous pluton related gold deposits 
associated with trench directed thrusting in southern Baja between La Paz and Cabo San 
Lucas and in Sonora north and west of Caborca. 

• The Baja California cluster has a probable PC1A Mesquite or Muruntau type peraluminous 
gold (arsenic-thorium) porphyry affinity. Grade-tonne data for analog deposits indicates an 
excellent potential for giant size open-pittable gold deposits. 

• Minera Pitalla has acquired ground and is continuing follow-up on existing targets within 
their expanded land position(s).  

In 2006 Stephens (2007) was contracted to sample trenches and scattered sampling areas and 
produced an internal report dated March 16, and revised March 15, 2007, by Melvin Herdrick, 
then Manager of Exploration of Pediment ("Herdrick"), which summarized the San Antonio gold 
project just prior to the start of drilling in 2007. Stephens supervised soil and rock geochemical 
surveys in the Emily, and Cirio concessions and resampled four of the Echo Bay Exploration 
("EBX") trenches. In the same period IP and magnetic surveys were undertaken by the 
geophysical contractor J.Reynolds of Durango Geophysical Operations(DGO). 

10.2 Geochemistry 

The data is provided as a map, showing point gold content in ppb in soils, grouped in ranges 
from 0-25 to >100 ppb Au. (Pitalla August 14, 2007). The soil samples were collected mainly in 
2007 and the results are not contoured. A total of 3600 samples were collected every 50 m E-W 
across the trend of the mineralized zones, on lines 200 m apart N-S.; sample depth was 10-30 cm 
in the B zone of the pediment cover. Soil samples were sent to Jacobs Assay Laboratory in 
Tucson AZ for 37 element ICP analysis with gold. The last 800 samples on east TRINI were sent 
to ALS Chemex in Hermosillo for a similar analysis.

Sampling covered all of the CIRIO (which contains the Los Planes and most of the Las Colinas 
deposits and the El Virgen zone) and the EMILY concession which contains the Fandango zone. 
For orientation purposes the sampling also covered a small area of adjacent (alien) lands, east of 
EMILY (Triunfo Este) and south of CIRIO (Minera Exito), which contains the La Colpa zone 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 27 

explored by EBX. Sampling was also extended to cover the east and south part of the newer 
TRINI concession. 

Description of results

In general the gold background is 0-25ppb; high background is 50-75 ppb and anomalies at 
>100ppb. Anomalous gold content ranges from 100-300 ppb Au and >300 ppb, is evident at each 
of the four zones described below and at other locations and at several other points on TRINI. 
Two known gold anomalous trends are related to the Las Colinas trend continuing northward, as 
well as the further east trend from Mina La Colpa also trending northward. A large western 
zone, called Fandango, shows anomalous gold and a possible related subzone or an extension, 
the La Virgen zone, also has a broad low level gold anomaly. 

Anomalous As, Ag, Pb, Sb, characteristic of the El Triunfo mineralization, occur in a zone with 
no outcrop, called the 602 anomaly, near the east side of the TRINI concession. 

In 2008 the geochemical data will be used to prioritize the various IP chargeability anomalies for 
further drill testing/trenching.  

10.3 Geophysics 

This section is extracted from a review of the 2006 and 2007 IP surveys by Reynolds(DGO , 
2008); the sections in italics are extracted from Stephens, (2007). 

RIP (Reconnaissance Induced Polarization) surveys were carried out in mid-2006 by (DGO) of 
Durango, CO, under the direct supervision of John Reynolds assisted by (DGO) field 
geophysical technicians and by trained Pitalla field technicians. Several of the Pitalla field 
technicians had worked with Reynolds during the EBX generation of IP surveys, 1994 through 
1997. More detailed dipole-dipole and pole-dipole array IP surveys were carried out in 2007. 
Fig. 10.1 & 10.2 eliminated. 

2006 "A RIP (reconnaissance induced polarization) survey was done in mid-2006 as noted 
above to determine if anomalous zones [identified during the late 1990's by Echo Bay 
Mexico (EBMx)] continue northward beyond the known areas of mineralization. Results 
of the RIP survey ([stations are randomly spaced yet cover the aerial extend of the 
project area]) showed two large polarization anomalous areas which extended off the 
CIRIO concession north and east. The central RIP anomaly was concluded to probably 
connect to the Las Colinas deposit area, while the eastern chargeable anomaly was 
located out east of the concession in the 602,000 east UTM coordinate". 

DMBW have examined a DGO map which shows the RIP anomaly and contoured airborne 
magnetic data. The airborne magnetic data is part of the EBMx data package acquired during the 
mid-1990s. The output from the EBMx helicopter DIGHEM, which combined magnetic, 
electromagnetic, radiometric and VLF-EM data, are available through a data access agreement 
with EBMx' successor, Kinross Gold. [These airborne data were subsequently reprocessed by 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 28 

Mr. Chris Ludwig, independent geophysical consultant, Denver, Colorado and by Reynolds. Two 
of the data plots as delivered by Ludwig, Total Field Magnetics and "Radiometric - Anomalous 
Potassium Component" were also examined by DMBW and an understanding of the relationship 
was gained, but both maps were omitted to limit the size of the digital file.] 

2007 "A geophysical IP dipole-dipole [with limited pole-dipole array data] survey conducted 
by Durango Geophysics currently totals 16 east west lines, with 100 m dipoles, 3-5 km 
long lines. Total line distance completed is more than 80 line kilometers. Prior data 
acquired from the EBX data base is 12 lines with 50 m [and 100] dipoles and about 3 km 
long IP lines or about 36 line kilometers of lines. There is some overlap of the data, but 
most of EB[Mx]' IP was in the Colinas deposit area. (Figures 10.3.1 and 10.3.2) These 
data sets are defining the gold zones continuation north beneath pediment cover, and 
providing some verification to match soil geochemical which can be tested by drill 
targeting later". The 2007 IP program data expands on the EBMx' coverage of the Las 
Colinas and Los Planes zones and this data extends the area of anomalous response 
significantly. In the Los Planes area, EBMx IP coverage was limited to 50 metre dipoles 
on lines 200 metres apart. The effective depth of exploration using 50 metre dipoles is 
probably not greater than 150 metres. The Pediment Exploration 2007 IP program 
consisted of 100 metre dipole-dipole and a limited amount of 100 metre pole-dipole data 
on the northern extension of the Los Planes ore deposit. The effective depth of 
exploration for 100 metres dipole-dipole data possibly exceeds 300 metres while the 
depth of exploration for the pole-dipole array may reach a depth of 400 metres to 500 
metres. 

50 metre dipole-dipole data from the EBMx 1997 database on Line 40700N shows a definite 
polarization anomaly (phase shift data) beneath station 989+00E at the N=3 level, about the 125 
metre depth. Refer to Fig 10.3.3  

Pediment Exploration 2007 100 metre dipole-dipole data along approximately the same line 
location UTM NAD 27 – Line 2639800N) shows very similar data patterns but the anomalous 
responses obviously have a greater depth extent than is displayed in the earlier EBMx 50 metre 
data set. The shallowest response seen in the Pediment Exploration data is centered under 
5987+00E. This corresponds with the EBMx zone located at 989+00E in the figure above. In the 
Pediment 100m data, the zone is seen at the N=2 level, or about 100+ metres. What is obvious is 
the greater depth penetration of the 100 m dipoles and there are two separate deeper zones 
apparent in the Pediment data that were never seen in the EBMx data using the 50 metre dipoles. 
These additional zones warrant drill testing for additional resource delineation. 

The Los Planes zone can be traced in the IP data a distance of 600 metres further north from Line 
2639800N, above. An expansion of this IP coverage to investigate the northern extension of Los 
Planes is warranted, in addition to investigating other possible parallel zones. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 29 

10.4 Rock Chip Sampling and Trenching  

In 2006 Pitalla completed a resampling program of four Echo Bay trenches and widespread rock 
chip sampling over an area 550 m N/S by 700 m E/W. Results are tabulated below; (reference 
Quick Report Pediment December 10, 2007 by J. Stephens and Figure 10.4) - by Pitalla 

"The old trenches were cleaned out, mapped and re-sampled. All trench sampling consisted of 
chip samples of three meters length along the trench bottom, with the exception of trench 
LCOT-19 where three 10-meter samples were taken. Trenches LCOT-5 and 12 are located over 
the outcrop of Echo Bay's previous inferred resource area. Trench LCOT-22 is located 200 
meters further east of the resource surface outcrop. Trench LCOT-19 is located almost one 
kilometer north of and along trend from the resource area. All trenches are oriented east-west, 
perpendicular to trend of the host thrust zone." The re-sampling confirmed the gold content of 
the EBX trenches, as shown below:

Includes 9 m @ 1.3 g/t gold, and 
3 m @ 69.8 g/t gold (uncut) 

10.5 Exploration Fandango and Virgen zones  

The western Fandango zone is also marked by anomalous arsenic in soil and to a lesser degree 
Ag. The Virgen zone is a low level gold anomaly. Peraluminous granodiorite to granite occurs in 
contact with older granite in a relatively flat contact zone. Although outcrop is limited carbonate 
alteration and oxidation with limonite is observed indicating oxidized low sulphide content. The 
structure dips east in contrast to the regional dip. DMBW have not seen these zones. 

10.6 Exploration Los Planes 

The area is mostly covered by the pediment sediments however a very few small trial pits were 
reportedly dug in areas of anomalous IP response, heavier sulphide mineralization, or shearing.  
Other than LCOT- 19 in 2006, results have not yet been compiled by Pitalla and have been 
superseded by the drilling.

11.0 DRILLING BY PITALLA

11.1 Los Planes RC Holes 

From June 27 to December 13, 2007 a total of 75 Reverse Circulation, 5.5 inch diameter ("RC") 
holes, totaling 14,981 m, were drilled at Las Planes by Layne Christiansen Drilling Co. of 
Hermosillo. Average hole length was 200 metres. 

The runner/manager and another driller were Canadians. All helpers were local Mexicans trained 
on the job. The drilling was supervised by Pedro Teran, B.Sc., (Qualified Person on site), an 
experienced exploration and mining geologist from Hermosillo, who is the general manager of 
the San Antonio project. Visual and binocular chip logging was done by Francisco Mugica, 
B.Sc., a senior geologist who had logged core/chips for Echo Bay at Paredones Amarillos in 
1996/7 and also by a Pitalla geologist, Armando Contreras, B.Sc., working under his direction. 
The database and QA/QC procedures were compiled by Isaac Antuna, M.Sc., a Pitalla 
Geosciences Engineer. 

Figure 11.1 shows the Hole layout in the Drill plan for both Planes and Colinas. It is an 
orthogonal grid, measuring 800m N-S x 300m E-W, with holes drilled generally, but not exactly, 
at 50m intervals, both E-W and N-S. The exploration grid is only about 60% completed. (See 
Recommendations 20) 

The mineralized cataclasite zone strikes generally N-S and dip about 45-50 degrees west, thus 
the vertical RC holes cut a zone length expanded by a factor of 1.4. 

Down-hole surveys were carried out for dip and deviation using a Reflex Easy Shot system by 
the contactor Layne de Mexico. The RC (Core) rig was a truck-mounted Schramm Drill, 
mobilized from Edmonton to Hermosillo; it could move about easily through the desert scrub 
terrain on tractor roads made by a local contractor. Pre-numbered drill sites were laid out by 
Brunton compass and chain, working off the surveyed grid. 

All hole collars were surveyed by Mario Alberto Moyron, working from La Paz, in February 
2007. Also present was Mr. Charles Skipper, Jr., former Chief Surveyor for Echo Bay Mexico 
who had previously surveyed the Echo Bay drill hole collars and trenches. They were able to 
accurately tie the old EBX drill hole locations to the INEGI National Survey monuments near 
Los Planes, something EBX was unable to do in 1995 to 1997. The map base is NAD 27 and the 
holes were surveyed by GPS Trimble. 

11.2 Los Planes Core Holes 

Prior to the main RC program, three, short – 50 East dipping core holes, LCDD – 18, 19, 20 
(398.2 m) were drilled by Diamond Drilling Specialists, of Arizona, in May 2007 with the same 
Longyear 44 drill, to confirm the near surface gold mineralization in the central-north section of 
the Los Planes zone. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 32 

Holes 19 and 20 were entirely oxidized, but ended short of target depth, due to ground conditions 
and equipment problems. Hole 18 cut many oxide sections with a 40.22 m core length (119.2-
159.4), grading 2.22g/t Au. This was later corroborated by Hole PLRC 62 which cut 57 m 
(123.4-180.4) @ 3.65 g/t (including 6samples >10g/t). 

One short Winke hole, LCW 24, was also drilled 50 m SE of LCDD-19 at 70 E. It cut 17.68 
meters of mineralized cataclasite grading 0.55g/t Au. 

11.3 Geotechnical Logging 

Pitalla report that geotechnical logging was carried out on Planes drill core holes DDH-18, 19 
and 20, drilled in May 2007, prior to the geological logging; it included digital photographs, and 
records of core recovery (REC), rock quality designation (RQD), fracture types, fracture count 
and frequency, dip of structures, rock strength and weathering alteration index. 

11.4 Discussion of Los Planes Results  (Figure 11.4 -see also Sections 7.2 & 9) 

The Planes zone lies about 600m north of the Las Colinas zone. It consists of a several sub 
parallel cataclasite zones that form a broad zone up to 100 meters wide. This unit strikes north-
south and dips from 35 degrees to the west near surface, steepening to 50 degrees west at depth. 
A continuous zone of gold mineralization has been traced for at least 700 metres along strike 
from Section 40050 N (Hole 07PLRC-41, which cut 1.49g/t Au over 48.76m vertical depth) to 
39350N (Hole PLRC 56, which cut 0.69g/t over 6.09m). Cross-Section 39,650 N, showing the 
first four holes drilled by Pediment and Echo Bay holes SA 97-120& 123, is attached as Figure 
11.4. 
The oxidized portion (see Section 9 &17) extends from surface (275m asl) to about 65m 
(210mASL); the sulfide (non-oxide) portion has been tested to about 275m (sea level) 
 The zone is best developed to a depth of about 225m (+50m asl), or 315m down the dip. 

The RC holes were drilled intermittently on 7 N-S tiers (along the strike of the zone) at 50m 
intervals E-W; the deepest exploratory intercept in the western tier was Hole PLRC 63 which cut 
0.62g/t over 36.58m (287.12- 323.70m), or-25m asl. 

The five richest intersections were encountered in Hole PLRC -07 (3.69g/tAu over 81.07m), 
Holes RCPL- 62 (3.65g/tAu over 57.04m), Hole PLRC- 59 (1.66g/tAu over 115.83 m), Hole 
PLRC -21 (1.57g/t over 109.73m) and Hole PLRC-43 (1.02g/tAu over 135.64 m) 
Four of these holes are in a cluster around Section 39800N. 

11.5 Las Colinas Core Holes – Resource Base -refer to fig 11. 

From February 24 to March 30, 2007, a total of 5 HQ core drill holes, LCDD 9, 11, 12, 13, and 
22, totaling 823 m, were drilled using a Longyear 44 rig, by Diamond Drilling Specialists, of 
New Mexico. The holes were angled east to confirm some of the 1996/1997 EBX RC holes.

Pitalla reported that "the drilling was successful in intercepting the Colinas 'Main Zone' (the 
Echo Bay historic resource) in holes 9, 11, and 12, returning intersections of 32.93 metres of 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 33 

1.23g/t gold, 25.1 metres of 1.09g/t gold and 18.3 metres of 1.13g/t gold, respectively." (Press 
release May 22, 2007) These lengths are close to the true width as the Colinas zone dips 50 
degrees west. 

They report that all holes testing the eastern side of the resource area cut several new zones at 
depth, parallel to the historic resource and that further definition drilling will be done. (Refer to 
drill plan.) 

11.6 Discussion of Las Colinas Results 

The core holes have confirmed the 1995-97 Echo Bay gold mineralization and added zone detail 
on four section lines, along a strike length of 250 m, within the Colinas deposit area; 
mineralization has now been defined along a strike length of 400m and to an average depth of 
about 150 m. The footwall of the zone appears to subcrop about 50m east of section 598,400E, 
the easterly tier. The deepest intercept is about + 70m asl, or approx 225 m below surface. The 
results are described and discussed, together with the EBX holes, in the context of the resource 
estimation in Section 17.

11.7 La Colpa Zone Exploration Winke Holes-refer to fig 11.1 

This historic zone lies 200 m east of the Las Colinas zone and is not included in the Colinas 
resource base 

From February 11 to May 9, 2007, nine HQ thin-wall (4.7cm/1ft 8 inch-diameter) Hydro-Winke 
holes, were drilled by Diamond Drilling Specialists. One was drilled at Los Planes (Section 11.3 
below) and nine were drilled at the La Colpa Zone, located 200 m east of the Las Colinas zone.

Six of these were short (c. 50 m) vertical holes to test the northeast extension of the La Colpa 
Zone that had been outlined by EBX. 

"Though encouraging gold intersections were encountered, notably 7.32m of 1.68g/t Au in hole 
LCW-05, and 7.3m of 0.5g/t Au in hole LCW-08, the holes were too shallow to adequately test 
the zone." (Pediment press release May 22, 2007) 

The three others were drilled east to undercut the old Echo Bay trenches at depths of about 35 m. 
Two of these, holes LCW-06B and LCW-21, confirmed gold mineralization near surface. 

DMBW observed some of the overgrown trenches and several of these monumented 1994-1997- 
era RC holes, as well as the 2007 Winke- Hole collars.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH

12.1 Drilling Procedure 

Pre-numbered drill sites were laid out generally on section lines at 50 m intervals N-S by 
Brunton compass and chain, working off the surveyed grid. RC pipe diameter was 5.5 inch and 
all rods, casing and core barrels are measured in the Imperial system. Sumps were dug at each 
site. Cuttings were visually and binocular-logged and sampled in 5 foot (1.52 metre) increments 
regardless of lithology, alteration, or mineralization. 

Chip trays were set up for this sample interval. RC drilling was day shift. On completion of each 
hole the collar was marked by white PVC pipe encased in a cement marker and the hole plugged 
and cemented with loose rock; the hole number was inscribed in the cement before hardening; 
the sump was then backfilled and the site dozer-bladed and restored to normal. DMBW were 
impressed with the efficiency of the drilling operations. 

In the sample recovery process, a cyclone is set up to initially split the material in half using a 
vertical and a lateral discharge. When normal samples are collected, material from the vertical 
discharge (50%) is disposed and the side discharge goes through a second splitter to obtain two 
samples, each representing 25% of the total discharge. These two samples are collected and 
sealed with plastic pull ties in pre-numbered cloth bags (for wet material) or plastic bags (for dry 
material). One of the bags is later weighed and stored in large rice sacks in the fenced yard at the 
Pitalla warehouse as a Duplicate, while the other is weighed and sent to the ALS Chemex 
preparation laboratory in Hermosillo. 

RC pipe diameter is 5.5 inch and all rods, casing and core barrels are measured in the Imperial 
system. Sumps were dug at each site. 

DMBW were impressed with the efficiency of the drilling operations and believe that the 
samples are representative of mineralization on the San Antonio project. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 37 

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES and SECURITY  

13.1 Reverse Circulation Samples 

All logging of samples is made in-site by qualified Geologists at the same time that the samples 
are being collected by the local (San Antonio) trained drill helpers. 

All samples are taken by Pitalla staff in a pickup truck at the end of the shift to the central 
logging facility at San Antonio (about 10 minutes drive) where they are stored under lock and 
key in a gated and fenced compound (finca) with security guards watching the premises 24 hours 
per day. The core shack and yard in San Antonio village is rented from the family of one of the 
staff who acts as a daytime security guard. 

The samples are packaged in rice sacks and trucked to the city of La Paz by bonded carrier and 
then by truck ferry (8 hours) to the Mexican mainland in Sinaloa State. The truck then proceeds 
to Hermosillo, Sonora (8 hours) and to the ALS Chemex preparation facility. Once prepared, the 
pulps are forwarded by ALS to the ALS Chemex labs in North Vancouver, Canada where Au 
content is measured by fire assay with Atomic Absorption finish as well as by aqua regia 
digestion and ICP analysis to quantify trace elements. When needed, over- range Au analysis 
(>10 ppm) is made by fire assay and Gravimetric finish. 

13.2 Rig Duplicates 

In addition, every 30 samples, a rig duplicate sample is obtained from the vertical discharge 
(50%), then is split and stored as individual samples in the warehouse; the other 50% is split as 
normal in two 25% samples, which are packed in individual pre-numbered bags to be sent to the 
lab as duplicate samples. 

13.3 Drill Core samples  

All sampling is carried out at 1.52 m (5 feet) intervals. Core barrels are 10 feet long. In a few 
areas of poor recovery, samples are combined into lengths greater than 1.52 m. The 1.52 m 
sample intervals are not tied to lithology, alteration or structure. Most of the sulphide core is 
fairly hard and competent and a diamond saw is used to cut the core in half (lengthwise). Fault 
zones (clay gouge) and other alteration, or small rubble zones are split with a spoon. Oxide core 
is normally solid clay and is cut in half (lengthwise) using a butcher knife; solid lumps are split 
with the hammer splitter. Care is taken to keep the saws as clean as possible. One half of the core 
is put into individual sample bags while the other remaining half is retained in the core boxes and 
stored on site in San Antonio. The plasticized cardboard core boxes, standard in Mexico, can 
store four runs of 1.52 m. 

Core is washed initially to remove drilling fluids, and then logged and photographed and 
recovery noted by measuring the net amount received between drillers wooden markers, which 
are marked in feet and meters.



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 38 

The Pitalla personnel who do the cutting are local laborers with varying degrees of technical 
skills (non-geological), but were trained on site. Assay samples are bagged, tagged and zip-tied 
in secure bags and then transported to La Paz and to Hermosillo as described above. 

13.4 Exploration Rock Samples 

Rock and trench samples were collected by qualified Mexican geologists/prospectors with data, 
including UTM coordinates, lithology and mineralization recorded in field books. Grab, and 
representative chip samples, are placed in standard plastic rock sample bags, tagged and the 
locations recorded in a master database. The plastic bags are sealed using plastic pull ties. All 
samples are taken to the central logging facility at San Antonio. Sample shipment and treatment 
is as described in 13.1. 

13.5 ALS Chemex Protocol 

ALS Chemex laboratories in North America are registered to ISO 9001: 2000 for the provision 
of assay and geochemical analytical services by QMI Quality Registrars. 

In addition Chemex's North Vancouver laboratory has received ISO 17205 accreditation from 
the Standards Council of Canada under CAN-P-1579 "Guidelines for Accreditation of Minerals 
Testing Laboratories". (Reference www.alsglobal.com) 

Quality Assurance: Standard specifications for sample preparation are as follows: 

 • Crushing:  >70% of crushed sample passes through a 2 mm screen 
 • Ringing:  >85% of the ring pulverized sample passes through a 75 micron screen (Tyler 

200 mesh) 
 • Samples received as pulps:  >80% of the sample passes through a 75 micron screen 

13.6 Conclusions  

In the opinion of DMBW the sample preparation, security practices and analytical procedures 
employed by Pitalla, with exception of the lack of check assays, meet industry norms. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 39 

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION  

14.1 Introduction 

Due to the nature of RC sampling, one control sample (i.e. Duplicate, Standard or Blank) is 
systematically and alternately inserted every 10 samples by the exploration geologists. 

The sequence is: every tenth rig sample, (i.e. 15.2 m,) – Standard, every twentieth sample 
(30.4 m) – Blank, every thirtieth sample (45.6m) – Duplicate, every fortieth sample (60.8m.) – 
Standard, etc. This sequence is repeated continuously from surface collar to the end of each hole. 
Thus each mineralized interval, normally >30 m, is backed up by 2 to 3 of these QC checks. In 
the case of deep holes there is normally a thick barren section near surface, so that it is possible 
that some of this material can be set aside for assaying at a later date, thus reducing assay and 
reference material costs. 

As mentioned before, duplicates are obtained using the two 25% samples from the lateral 
discharge of the drill, and packed in two pre-numbered plastic bags. 

In general, the reference material (i.e. Standards and Blanks) consist of pulverized material 
obtained from "RockLabs Limited" in New Zealand. Standards utilized within the reverse 
circulation sampling consist of Sulphide and Oxide materials with different certified Au content 
values. 

After Geochemistry results are generated and certified by ALS Chemex, a statistical and/or 
graphic QA/QC analyses are applied to all control samples as shown below. 

14.2 Duplicates 

Duplicate samples are evaluated by the Spearman Rank's correlation coefficient (R2), which 
considers differences in Au-values sorting-ranks and is calculated to assure a good positive-
correlation represented by the proximity of R2 to 1. As shown in the scatter plot the Spearman 
rank of 0.953 shows excellent correlation (Fig. 14.2). 

14.3 Standards 

Certificates of results for all reference material are issued by RockLabs, these documents contain 
mainly the mean Au values and the Standard Deviation for each standard they manufacture, and 
this information is taken into account to establish the tolerance limits which determine if a re-
assay is required. 

Reference material's results that Pitalla receives from ALS Chemex are graphically analyzed as 
part of the QA/QC procedures. 

The RockLabs standards that have been used in the current drilling program are one sulphide-
type with code SG31, a mean Au value of 0.996 ppm and a standard deviation of 0.028 ppm; as 
well as three oxide-type materials with codes OxC58, OxD43, and OxD57, and mean Au values 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 40 

of 0.201, 0.401, and 0.413 ppm, respectively. It is apparent that many standard assays reported 
below the mean down to M+ 2SD and down to M+SD. 

Refer to Scatter Plots for QA/QC Standards: Figures 14.3.1, 14.3.2, 14.3.3, 14.3.4 .Appendix 

14.4 Blanks 

Blank material obtained from RockLabs and the corresponding results that Pitalla receives from 
ALS Chemex are also graphically analyzed. 

Pitalla's QA/QC procedures establish a maximum limit of 0.015 ppm Au content to consider a 
blank sample analysis within range, anything above that value would trigger a re-analysis request 
to ALS Chemex. A total of 11 samples were accordingly re-assayed and found to lie within the 
tolerance limit. (Refer to Figure 14.4 in-appendix)

14.5 Requested Re-assays

A total of 155 samples from 17 RC holes were re-assayed as a result of unacceptable variations 
beyond the limits described in Section 14.2, 14.3, and 14, above. All passed.  
  
14.6 ALS Chemex Reno, Nevada Assay Lab 

From November 7, 2007 to January 3, 2008, sample pulps from the Chemex Hermosillo prep lab 
were air freighted to the ALS Chemex assay laboratory in Reno. This was done to speed up assay 
turn around since the Vancouver facility was seriously over-booked. This practice was 
discontinued immediately following this date, as the assays from the Reno lab were found to be 
consistently 10% lower in Au grade than the assays from Vancouver. Samples from a total of 18
holes were sent. Upon Minera Pitalla identifying this problem the samples pulps were redirected 
to Vancouver. Chemex have resolved this problem and those pulp assays meeting the QA/QC 
protocols are now included in the final data base. 

None of the Reno lab samples are included. (See review prepared by Minera Pitalla as Appendix 
3) 

14.7 Laboratory Cross Check Samples 

Check samples were not taken during the 2007 drilling program to date; the lack of same does 
not detract from this first resource estimation, in the opinion of DMBW. 

At DMBW's recommendation a catch-up lot of 10 mineralized intervals from previously assayed 
holes were recently sent by bonded carrier to the Chemex Hermosillo lab with instructions to 
forward the reject pulp, including control samples, blanks, standards and duplicates to the ACME 
Preparation lab in Guadalajara, Jalisco. In future about 2% of mineralized zone samples should 
be routinely sent to ACME. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 41 

As shown in table 14.7 (appendix), all samples passed QA QC satisfactorily. A graph of these 
results is shown in Figure 14.4. 

14.8 Twinned Holes  

Upon the recommendations of DMBW, the program was started in December and to year end 
vertical RC hole PL07-RC 20 had been twinned by vertical core hole 08LCDD-10, with the 
following results

The cored hole was offset about 5 m and the intersections are about 10 m deeper, however the 
average grade-thickness products in the lower intercept are too variable. 

A total of 5 more RC holes were twinned in 2008 by core holes; assays are not available for the 
data base but the geology and mineralization have been used to verify zone continuity. 

When this data is available a more informed opinion can be made. (See Section 17) 

14.9 Conclusion 

The data verification measures observed by DMBW meet industry norms and there are no factors 
that would limit the use of such data.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The TEXCALAMA Concession that adjoins the Pediment concessions to the south, shown on 
Figure 4.1 contains a small uncalculated portion of the Las Colinas historic resource and the 
historic Mina La Colpa Deposit, lying about 200 m east. This was formerly known as El Mirador 
(2.96MT @ 1.45g/tAu) and was re-discovered by Echo Bay in the 1990s; Pitalla have explored 
its northern extension since. (Section 11) The company holder, Exploracion Minera El Exito, is 
inactive.  

This company also holds the EL EXITO concession which adjoins EMILY and TEXCALAMA. 
The LA TRINCHERA concession to the north is held by J. M. Deword and is also inactive; data 
is not available. 

Two other inactive small concessions, TRIUNFO ESTE and TRIUNFO OESTE are adjacent to 
TRINI. There is no record of exploration work on these other concessions. 

To the west of EMILY a large concession is held by The Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) and 
called El Triunfo. It contains a concession area called UVARES, and is the site of a small gold 
deposit with a historic resource of 1.82MT @ 1.81g/tAu. (Echo Bay 1997) Essentially, Minera 
Pitalla has been the sole company actually conducting recent exploration in the district. 

The above noted gold-sulphide deposits are hosted by cataclasite rocks and are oxidized to 
shallow depths; they were explored by EBX in the late 1990s to serve as potential satellite feed 
to Paredones Amarillos. The information comprises some drill sections and historic resource 
calculations. DMBW has been unable to verify the information and the information is not 
necessarily indicative of mineralization on the properties, which are the subject of this technical 
report. 

The above estimates have not been verified by a QP, as required by NI 43-101. They are 
considered as historical resources that are not compliant with NI 43-101 and are reported for 
informational purposes only. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 44 

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING & METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Metallurgical test work was carried out on Las Colinas by D. R. Shaw of the Colorado Minerals 
Research Institute, (CMRI, 1997). Two composite samples of RC drill cuttings, grading 1.07 and 
1.6 g/t Au respectively, were found to contain pyrite with minor pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and 
other sulphides, along with very fine-grained gold. In that study gold bottle leach recoveries of 
four composites varied from 48.2% to 62.6% and it is reported by Pitalla that these entirely 
sulphide samples with minor oxidation; they were taken from Holes SA 96-91and SA 96-102, 
and from depths of 120-160 m. CMRI concluded that "the incomplete gold dissolutions in these 
tests reflected the relatively coarse particle size of the as-received cuttings materials". "Sodium 
cyanide consumptions were reasonable at approximately 1 kg/t, as were lime requirements, 
which were approximately 3 to 4 kg/t." 

CMRI reported that "fine grinding would be required to achieve high gold recoveries" and that 
"core samples would be the most reliable material for future work especially in respect of 
confirming the grinding and liberation requirements". 

The samples responded well to flotation and cyanidation of the reground concentrate indicated 
98% to 99% recovery of the gold. Sodium cyanide consumption was high at 2.7 to 2.8 kg/t of ore 
because of the presence of copper sulphides and pyrrhotite in the concentrate. Further testing was 
recommended. 

Following DMBW's recommendation in 2007, Pediment has recently sent nine composited 
samples from reverse-circulation drilling samples to SGS Minerals Services in Durango, Mexico. 
The composites were chosen to represent high, medium and low grade for each of the ore zones 
at Planes: oxide, mixed oxide-sulphide and sulphide. 

A total of 44 samples were sent for oxide, 32 for mixed and 23 for sulphide. Results are not yet 
available. 

For subsequent metallurgical and scoping studies bottle roll tests should be done using whole 
(metallurgical) core. (See Section 20)

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES

17.1 Historic Mineral Resource Estimate

An independent estimate of mineralized material defined at Las Colinas was carried out for Echo 
Bay Mines by a Qualified Person (Kuyper, 1996) before the implementation of National 
Instrument 43-101 reporting standards. A specific gravity of 2.7 was used. No gold values were 
cut as no assays exceeded 34 g/t Au. Currently available information suggests that Kuyper/Echo 
Bay had not surveyed the drill hole collar locations at the time of this estimation exercise and 
that they used hole locations rounded to the nearest 50 m. Based on data from 16 holes and five 
trenches Kuyper's estimate of the mineralized material present was 6.84 MT at a grade of 1.02 
g/t Au using a cross-sectional method and extending mineralization a maximum distance of 50 m 
from each intercept. Kuyper noted that approximately 15% of this mineralization occurred on the 
adjoining Texcalama Concession to the south that was not owned by Pediment. 

The Echo Bay estimate is considered a Historical Resource that is not compliant with NI 43-101 
and is reported for informational purposes only. 

Echo Bay carried out additional drilling in 1997, primarily to the north of the resource estimated 
by Kuyper in 1996. This drilling intercepted several mineralized intervals which suggested that 
the mineralized trend was open to the north. 

17.2 Current Mineral Resource Estimates

The current National Instrument 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimates for the Los 
Planes ('Planes') and Las Colinas ('Colinas') zones on Pediment's San Antonio project were 
completed by Dave Laudrum of Ashloo Consultants Ltd., under contract to DMBW, using 
GEMS Software Version 6.1.3, from Gemcom Software International. The resource is reported 
based on cut-off grades and economic parameters produced by Ian Thompson of DMBW in 
Section 18. 

The resource estimate contains all assay data which had been received and passed Pediment's 
QA/QC procedures as of December 2007. Similar estimation methodologies were used for both 
the Los Planes and Las Colinas deposits. 

Based on the parameters described in this report DMBW has estimated an Inferred Mineral 
Resource for the Los Planes deposit of 30.58 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.32 g/t Au, 
using a 0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade. In addition DMBW has estimated an Inferred Mineral Resource 
for the Las Colinas deposit of 5.62 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.83 g/t Au, using a 
0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade. 

17.3 Geological Interpretation 

A key component of the resource estimation process is the construction of three-dimensional 
('3D') models of the mineralized domains which correspond to the detailed geological 
interpretation of the deposit. Domains are required in order to group geologically and statistically 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 46 

similar, and spatially continuous, areas of the deposit for modeling and estimation so that the 
assay data informs the appropriate areas of the model. 

Geological modelling is an evolving process and further refinement of the models is expected as 
new data and new interpretations are incorporated. Nevertheless, at the current level of 
exploration DMBW believe that Pediment has developed an appropriate geological interpretation 
for estimation of mineral resources at both Planes and Colinas. There are well defined geological 
and grade domains with good vertical and lateral continuity and these domains were used as hard 
boundaries when interpolating grades into the block models. 

 17.3.1 Planes Geological Model 

 For the Planes deposit Pediment provided DMBW with a partial set of cross sections 
showing its interpretation of the zone geometry. Based on that interpretation DMBW 
digitized 'polylines' of the mineralized domains in Gemcom,  on cross-sections oriented 
east-west and spaced 25 m apart. The resulting polylines were then linked and formed 
into 3D solids ('wireframes') of the mineralized domains. Copies of the polylines, the 3D 
solids, and a list of the 'from and to' drill intercepts captured in these 3D solids were then 
sent to Pediment's geologists in order for them to confirm that the geological 
interpretation was appropriate. 

 At Planes the boundaries of 2 mineralized zones have been modeled, based on assay 
composite grades > 0.3 g/t Au and on the presence of the cataclasite zone. The two sub-
parallel zones strike north-northeast and both zones dip approximately -35º to the west 
near surface with dips steepening to -50º at depth. 'Zone A' is the larger and deeper zone 
and 'Zone B' overlies it. To date mineralization has been defined along approximately 
800 m of strike length at Planes. There is generally good correlation between anomalous 
Au grades in composites and the logged cataclastite unit. 

 There are a number of holes where Au grades in the hole (as well as Au grades and 
geology of surrounding holes) show the zone coming through but cataclastite was not 
logged. This is not unusual given that logging of structural intensity can be quite 
subjective, and is particularly challenging when logging RC holes. Consideration should 
be given to re-logging some of these holes when time permits. 

 The current models incorporate several intervals of material with low or no grade where 
it was not considered practical to break that material out. 

 17.3.2 Colinas Geological Model 

 For the Colinas deposit Pediment provided DMBW with a report from a historic estimate 
of mineralized material carried out for Echo Bay in 1996 (see section 17.1 of this report). 
The Echo Bay report contained 8" x 10" summary x-sections showing the geological 
model for Colinas. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 47 

 Based on the Echo Bay interpretation, and using a 0.3 g/t Au composite cut-off, DMBW 
created 3D solids of the zone using the methodology as described above for Planes. 
These 3D solids were then sent to Pediment's geologists in order for them to confirm that 
the geological interpretation was appropriate. 

 Mineralization at Colinas occurs in a north-northeast striking zone which dips -50º to the 
west. To date mineralization has been defined along approximately 400 m strike length at 
Colinas. The southern portion of that strike length extends onto concessions not held by 
Pediment, however only that portion of the Colinas resource occurring on concessions 
held by Pediment is reported in this report. 

 17.3.3 Modelled surfaces 

 A 3D topographic surface was created by gridding the coordinates of the drillhole collars.  

 A 3D surface representing the base of the overburden was created by gridding the base of 
the overburden unit as identified in the drill logs. 

 A 3D surface representing the base of the rocks affected by oxidation was created by 
gridding the base of the lowest point where rocks have consistently been affected by 
surface oxidation in each of the drill logs. This 3D surface represents the base of all 
logged oxidation (including weak, moderate, and strong intensities) as it was not practical 
to break out finer divisions based on the available data. 

 The Colinas Deposit straddles the southern boundary of the concessions held by 
Pediment. For the current Mineral Resource Estimate the deposit was clipped by a 
vertical boundary constructed between the corners of Pediment's Concession located at 
596544E 2628303N and 599738E 2638324N. Only that portion of the Colinas resource 
occurring on concessions held by Pediment is reported in this report. 

17.4 Drill Hole Database 

DMBW received drill hole data from Pediment in MS Excel spreadsheets of the collar, survey, 
geology, and assay data. In addition separate spreadsheets were provided which contained 
QA/QC assays for blanks, standards, and duplicate assays for Planes. 

Additional files provided to DMBW contained digital copies of drill logs and assay certificates 
for both Pediment and Colinas holes, including the Echo Bay holes. No significant errors were 
found with respect to assay documentation and database entry. 

Geological information in the database is entered as numerical codes for alteration, mineralogy, 
oxidation, lithology, sulphide content, and zone (structure) type. Pediment and Echo Bay used 
different systems of numeric codes for these items, and the codes in the Echo Bay holes in the 
current database have not been converted. Pediment is aware of this discrepancy with the 
database coding and the issue is being corrected. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 48 

The database contained data on drill holes completed on the project prior to January 2008. 

Surface assays from rock chip sampling of outcrops and trenches were not incorporated into the 
assay database for the current resource estimate. 

The total San Antonio drillhole database used for the current resource estimates contains 14609 
assay samples collected from 124 drill holes. 

To ensure equal support in geostatistical analysis and resource estimation the assay data within 
the modelled domains were composited to fixed 2.0 m lengths. A composite length of 2 m was 
selected for both Los Planes and Colinas as being appropriate for the currently modelled domain 
geometry. 

The composites were generated by starting the zero metre length count at the upper edge of each 
mineralized interval; some fractional composites which are less than 2.0 m in length are retained 
at the lower edge of some intervals. The compositing process was carried out separately for 
samples within each modeled domain so that no composites cross the boundary between 
mineralized and non-mineralized domains. 

The 3D model of the 2 mineralized domains at Planes are intersected by 73 drill holes including 
five Echo Bay RC holes drilled in 1997, four Pediment Diamond Drill holes completed in March 
2007, and 64 Pediment RC holes completed in December 2007. Selecting only those samples 
which fall within the model of the mineralized zones A and B at Planes, and then compositing 
the selected samples to regular 2 metre intervals resulted in 2450 2 m composites which fall 
within the two Planes mineralized zones. The composites have a weighted average grade of 
1.2034 g/t Au. The weighted average of the raw assays (prior to compositing) which fall within 
the models of the Planes mineralized zones is 1.2056 g/t Au. 

The 3D model of the mineralized zone at Colinas is intersected by 19 drill holes including 14 
Echo Bay RC holes drilled in 1996-97, and five Pediment DDH holes drilled in 2007. Selecting 
only those assay samples which fall within the model of the mineralized zone at Colinas, and 
then compositing the selected samples to regular two metre intervals resulted in 318 2 m 
composites with a weighted average grade of 0.8688 g/t Au. The weighted average grade of the 
raw assays (prior to compositing) which fall within the model of the Colinas mineralized zone is 
0.8683 g/t Au. 

17.5 Sample Population 

The graph below shows the log normal distribution of grades based on the 2450 composites 
occurring in the modeled zones (zone A and B combined) for Planes. The histogram displays a 
uni-modal lognormal distribution of gold grades, indicating a single population of samples.

17.6 High-Grade Assay Capping

The assay populations within the mineralized domains were examined to determine whether the 
distribution of grades contains erratic high grade values which could have a disproportionate 
influence in the estimation of the average grade of the deposit, ie: whether the deposit is 
"nuggety". A common practice with nuggety gold deposits is to cap any identified erratic high 
grades by resetting all values above a certain threshold value to the threshold value. 

For the raw (uncomposited) assay samples in the Planes database a total of four samples returned 
assay grades > 30 g/t Au (with the highest being 41.8 g/t) and a total of 39 samples grade > 10 
g/t Au. Although the four assay samples grading greater than 30 g/t were capped at 30 g/t prior to 
calculating composites, in line with common industry practice, it was noted that with the Los 
Planes database this capping to 30 g/t did not have a measurable effect on the overall resource. 

For the raw (uncomposited) assay samples in the Colinas database a total of 23 samples returned 
assay grades > 2.0 g/t Au (with the highest being 5.71 g/t). No assay capping was applied to the 
Colinas assays prior to compositing.

17.7 Bulk Density  

Pediment contracted a local engineering company, Oestec de Mexico, to carry out bulk density 
(specific gravity) measurements on intervals of diamond drill core or half-core. Pediment 
provided DMBW with Excel spreadsheets of the density measurements for each of the Los 
Planes and Colinas Zones. A total of 72 density measurements were carried out on samples of 
mineralized core from within the modelled zones/domains. 

The following density values were used for resource estimation for both Planes and Colinas:

Average Density determinations for San Antonio mineralization 

Zone Type Density (SG) Number of Measurements 
Sulphide Mineralization 2.7 35 

Oxide Mineralization 2.6 37 

17.8 Block Models 

Separate block models were defined to cover the mineralization at Planes and Colinas. The 
blocks model limits are defined by the parameters in the following tables: 

Table 17.2 
Los Planes Deposit Block Model Parameters 

PLANES 
MODEL 

Model Origin1 Number of Blocks Block Size (m) 

Easting 598200 160 columns 5 
Northing 2638800 300 rows 5 
Elevation 300 (m) 100 levels 5

Easting 598000 150 columns 5 
Northing 2638100 175 rows 5 
Elevation 300 (m) 100 levels 5 

1 The convention used in Gemcom, and duplicated here, is to define the block model origin by specifying 
the Minimum X and Y coordinates and the Maximum Z coordinates of the outside corner of the block 
which sits at the origin. 

There was no rotation of either of the block models, all blocks are oriented east-west and are 
vertical. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 52 

17.9 Grade Interpolation 

Grades were interpolated into blocks by the method of Ordinary Kriging. 

Modeled 3D domains were used as hard boundaries to constrain the interpolation of grades. Only 
composites in a particular domain were considered when interpolating grade into blocks in that 
same domain. 

Gemcom determines the percentage of a block falling within a particular domain by the method 
of needling. For both Planes and Colinas a needling integration level of three was used so that 
nine equally spaced vertical needles pierce each block. 

Search ellipse and variogram ranges were determined by Variography using Sage 2001 software 
from Issacs & Co. Similar interpolation methodology and search ellipse/variogram ranges were 
used for both Planes and Colinas. Search ellipse distances used were 65 m (along strike) x 65 m 
(down dip) x 25 m (across strike/dip). 

17.10 Resource Classification 

For this initial resource estimate all mineralization at Planes and Colinas has been classified as 
Inferred. 

At the current level of drilling there are well defined geological and grade domains with good 
vertical and lateral continuity and these domains were used as hard boundaries when 
interpolating grades into the block models. 

Current drill spacing on individual x-sections often approaches 25 metre centres (down dip), 
while the spacing between currently drilled x-sections is generally 50 metres (along strike). 

Pediment has noted, and DMBW concurs, that the next major step in the development of the San 
Antonio project should be a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") to further assess the 
economic viability of the deposits. And that depending of the results of that PEA, that a program 
of additional drilling on 25 metre sections may be warranted, with the goal of increasing 
confidence in geological and grade continuity in order to upgrade portions of the resource to 
higher resource categories. 

17.11 Results Of Mineral Resource Estimates 

Based on the parameters described in this report DMBW has estimated an Inferred Mineral 
Resource for the Los Planes deposit of 30.58 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.32 g/t Au, 
using a 0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade. In addition DMBW has estimated an Inferred Mineral Resource 
for the Las Colinas deposit of 5.62 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.83 g/t Au, using a 
0.4 g/t Au cut-off grade.

or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration.   

(2) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
(3) Numbers may not add up, due to rounding. 
(4) 'Oxidized' refers here to rock affected by oxidation including weak-moderate-strong intensities. 

17.12 Block Model Validation 

The models and database were checked for proper coding of drillhole intervals, composites and 
block model cells. A detailed visual validation of the Planes and Colinas block models was 
carried out in both sectional and plan views where grade interpolation into blocks was checked 
relative to composite values in drillholes. The checks showed good agreement between drillhole 
composites and block model grades. 

See Figures 17.3, 17.4 and 17.5 for Planes deposit x-sections. See Figures 17.6 and 17.7 for 
Colinas deposit x-sections.

18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

18.1 General 

Other than the description of Cut-Off Grades below, there is no other relevant data or 
information not described in previous sections. 

18.1 Selection of Cut-Off Grades  

DMBW has derived a cutoff grade of 0.40g/t Au for the resource estimation in Section 17 
above. Lacking any determination of operating cost and revenues for Planes, as per a 
Floating Cone Evaluation, this selection of a cut off grade is only an initial general 
guideline for the Planes Inferred Resources. At this initial resource stage, the cutoff 
reflects the opinion of DMBW as regards the relative positioning of the Las Planes 
deposit with its peers. 

The selection of a cutoff grade at this early stage of project development is a best 
estimate based on the known geometry and grade of the zone and on the material 
reviewed below. A Preliminary Economic Analysis, as recommended by DMBW, is 
needed to determine a more accurate cut-off grade.

DMBW reviewed a variety of breakeven cut-off grades used by operators of open-pit, 
heap-leach gold deposits and mines currently (or within the past 4 years), in operation, or 
in various stages of pre-feasibility, or feasibility studies. The deposits are all of the 
low-grade gold, or gold-equivalent, type; six are located in Mexico, and one, Mesquite, in 
California. They are described in general terms in this section and tabulated below. 

The data is publicly available on either the companies' websites, or on SEDAR and 
features the opinions of two companies, Metallica and Gammon Gold and by those of 
different independent geologists and engineers. 

As shown in Table 18.1 the cut-offs range from 0.20g/t to 0.50g/t Au, the latter at 
Paredones as selected by Mine Development Associates (MDA). (see also Section 8.2) 
This deposit is a direct analogue of Planes but has only sulphide ore, thus reflecting the 
lower leach-recovery, and hence, the higher cut off grade. 

In this study, DMBW have examined data for both Indicated and Inferred Mineral 
Resources in the determination of Cut-off grades for Mineral and Mining Reserves, 
which are normally lower than those for Resources, are excluded from the overall 
average, as they are derived with the benefit of a much greater reliability of data and 
costs. 

The gold prices stated in the reports were selected by the engineers as suitable longer –
term prices for forecasting project revenue; they show a dramatic rise from $350/oz in 
2004 to $650/oz in 2007. 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 62 

DMBW examined gold prices published each six months by Kitco (www.kitco.com) a 
source used by engineers. From January 2004 to January 2008 the average six-month 
price rose from $425 to 850/oz (London Fix PM). The three year rolling (cumulative 
average) gold prices/oz for 2005, 2006, and 2007 were: $444.74, $603.46 and $695.39/oz 
respectively. The five year chart from May 2003 to May 2008 showed a shoulder at 
$650/oz from May 2006 to May 2007. From the above, a future longer term gold price in 
the range of $600 to $650/oz seems to be a reasonable assumption as at December 31, 
2007. 

The above-noted gold price trends have been considered by DMBW in their selection of 
this average cut-off grade of 0.36g/t Au, which has been marginally increased to 0.40g/t 
Au for the estimation of the Planes Inferred Mineral Resources.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

At the current level of exploration DMBW believe that Pediment has developed an 
appropriate geological interpretation for estimation of mineral resources at both Planes 
and Colinas. There are well defined geological and grade domains with good vertical and 
lateral continuity, suitable for use as hard boundaries, when interpolating grades into the 
block models. 

Quality assurance/quality control on blanks, standards and duplicates indicate that the 
assay data provided on the Planes Deposit is of sufficient quality to estimate a resource. 

Gold assays from 73 holes at Planes and from 19 holes at Colinas were used to complete 
the resource estimates; composite length was two metres. 

The Los Planes zone can be traced in the IP data for 600 metres north of Line 
2,639,800N, or 400 metres beyond the most northerly holes, 07PLRC-08 and 
07PLRC-42, thus justifying further exploration. 

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET 

20.1 Recommendations

DMBW recommends a further Exploration Program of infill vertical Reverse Circulation 
('RC') and Core drilling at Planes in 2008 on a 50 x 50 metre grid within a quadrangle 
formed by coordinates 2639350-2640150 north and 598500-598800 east. The intention is 
to outline all significant mineralization within this (800 x 300) 240,000 square metre 
block, thus possibly increasing the inferred resource base, as a precursor to closer spaced 
drilling. This program would entail about 50 holes or about 10,000 metres.

Note 1: The extent of an increase in inferred resources, if any, is unknown at this time. 

Note 2: It cannot be assumed that all, or any part of the present inferred mineral resource, would 
be upgraded to a higher category. 

Continued exploration of the Concession lands is also recommended. The IP coverage 
should be expanded to detail survey the northern extension of the Los Planes zone, in 
addition to detailing the parallel zones found in 2007. 

Pediment has noted, and DMBW concurs, that following this, the next major step in the 
development of the San Antonio project should be a Preliminary Economic Assessment 
("PEA"). 



Derry, Michener, Booth & Wahl Consultants Ltd.  Page 64 

The PEA should include: 

• Determination of gold recoveries in bottle roll tests from oxide, mixed and 
sulphide mineralization at Planes and Colinas. (in progress) 

• Estimation of capital and operating costs for open pit mining and whole ore leach 
processing to determine appropriate cut-off grades.

• Preparation of a scoping study which would include a Floating Cone Evaluation. 
• Preliminary environmental and water assessment  
• Further consultation with village ejidos on the acceptability of mining the San 

Antonio gold deposits. 

Depending on the results of that PEA, a program of additional drilling on 25 metre 
sections on the Planes gold deposit may be warranted, with the goal of increasing 
confidence in geological and grade continuity, to upgrade portions of the resource to an 
Indicated category.
Drill testing the IP anomaly extending for 400 m north of Los Planes and additional 
(definition) drilling at Colinas would be contingent on the results of the above program at 
Planes. 
DMBW have not determined the cost of further programs beyond this stage.  

20.2 Budget 

The budget is developed from Pitalla cost estimates for the 2007 drilling and exploration 
program. In DMBW's opinion the costs are reasonable. 

The field program entails about 6 to 8 months of drilling, depending on drill progress, 
followed by a consolidation/compilation phase of 4 to 6 months, during which the 
Preliminary Economic Assessment will be completed and plans made for the next phase. 
The 2 month exploration IP survey includes preliminary and detail follow-up, 
interpretation and reporting. The estimated cost of the complete recommended program, 
including normal contingencies, is $1,962,000. 

DMBW have not determined the cost of further programs beyond this stage.
