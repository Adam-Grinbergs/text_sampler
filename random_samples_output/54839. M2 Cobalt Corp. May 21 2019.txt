1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction  

The Nico Young Project ("the Project") is a mineral exploration area for nickel cobalt laterite located 
approximately 30 kilometres (km) west-northwest of the town of Young in the State of New South 

Wales (NSW), Australia.  The Project area is held by Nico Young Pty Ltd under Exploration 
Licences (ELs) 5571, 5527 and 8698 in accordance with the NSW Mining Act 1992 for Group 1 
Minerals including nickel and cobalt. Nico Young Pty Ltd is owned by Jervois Mining Limited 

("JRV"), a company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). JRV's titles cover 40.6 

square kilometres (km2). 

An unrelated magnesite quarry is located on Mining Lease CML15 and is shown on the map in the 
Adjacent Properties section.  EL7333 surrounds CML15 to the North and West and is an 

exploration licence for Group 2 Minerals. 

The area is subject to grain and livestock farming with the main geographic feature being Trig 
Station 3056 Memagong Hill, Tubbul, located at 34°10'49.01"S 148°4'0.75"E apart from a small 

area quarried for magnesite (Young Mining Co. Ltd – Causmag).

JRV commenced exploration in the Young district in 1998.  Field exploration has included 

geological mapping, ground magnetics, air core drilling, diamond drilling and Caldwell drilling 

followed by metallurgical testing. 

The Mineral Resource at Nico Young was originally estimated in September 2001.  Since that time 
there have been multiple programs of air core, RC and diamond drilling within the nominal resource 
boundaries.  These programs have produced metallurgical samples and provided infill data 

geological data. The most recent programs were in June 2017, February/March 2018, and 

July/August 2018.   

There are 14 Landholders who hold property that either partially or wholly lies within the Group 1 
mineral licence areas.  The relationship with these landholders is kept formal with documented 
requests and subsequent permissions for access to their lands for various purposes.  At the same 

time that procedural formality is upheld, the relationships are also cordial and mutually beneficial to 
either party.  Landholder compensation monies are agreed and disbursed accordingly subject to 

the type and duration of JRV's work that is to be undertaken on the property. 

If the Project successfully passes through the next phases of investigative, technical, and feasibility 
work then Mining Lease tenure status will need to be applied for.  There are a number of 

prescriptive sequential regulatory steps that need to be observed which are largely concerned with 
development of a suitable Environmental Impact Statement and securing conditional agreements 

with all affected landholders for operational land access.

1.3 Geology and Mineralisation 

The source of the nickel/cobalt mineralisation is the Wambidgee Serpentinite of Cambrian age.  

The serpentinites (originally harzburgites) have intruded the Jindalee Beds in elongate north-south 
bodies associated with faulting.  In the Young/Cootamundra area, they are flanked on the eastern 
side by the Silurian Young Granodiorite.  It is believed that this is an important factor in the 

formation of the mineralised laterites.  Runoff in the region is from east to west (from the Great 
Dividing Range) and the acid-rich groundwater, after traversing the 30 km-wide granite belt, has 
chemically leached the serpentinites, removing silica, magnesium and other soluble elements and 

leaving enriched amounts of less soluble iron, aluminium, nickel and cobalt. 

The Nico Young Project comprises three known soil covered nickel-cobalt laterite deposits: 

Ardnaree, East and West Thuddungra and have been periodically drill sampled since 1998.  The 

Tertiary laterisation has produced a profile over the serpentinites that comprises: 

 Hematitic Clay: Beneath the soil cover (1–2 m), red-brown to purple red clay is the 
dominant lithotype with common to abundant quartz-magnetite pisolites with moderate 

iron cementing in places.  It often contains large lithic fragments in localised sections. 

 Limonitic Clay: This lithotype is dominated by moderate to strong goethite and is orange 
or light-brown colour and is generally fine grained with rare tiny pisolites.  Sub-horizontal 

bands of black manganese that are sometimes strongly foliated and wavy from shearing 
are common.  This horizon is thought to be formed from intense shearing destroying all 
relic textures of the former serpentinite protolith.  This lithotype is considered to contain 

the majority of cobalt in manganese and some nickel.

 Weathered Saprolite – Fresh Serpentinite: These lithotypes occur as many hues of 
greens and some browner colourations.  It is often soft, highly clay altered and often quite 
micaceous with large silver muscovite flakes often found concentrated around the darker 

green minerals in the serpentinite.  It is often highly sheared with visible abundant flow-
banding shear textures indicating an earlier more ductile deformation and sometimes cut 
in places by more recent brittle deformation at steep angles.  This horizon is thought to 

contain the bulk of the nickel mineralisation.  There can be a minor component of fibrous 

minerals in the serpentinites. 

 Ultramafic: This lithology is usually weathered to a light brown-orange colour and has 
some silicification making it quite hard often and causing drilling termination due to bit 
refusal.  It contains white feldspar porphyry-blasts with a green hue from chlorite 

alteration giving the lithology a spotted appearance that is usually foliated.  Shearing 
textures both ductile and brittle are often evident.  The fresh ultramafic is dark green 

black with white spots or lines from feldspar and likely harzburgite. 

The main nickel minerals in the Weathered Serpentinite, Saprolite and Limonite samples are 
chlorite-saponite.  Towards the surface, hematite/Fe-hydroxides, asbolane and montmorillonite 

become more important. 

As drill defined to 2018, the Ardnaree deposit extends over 9 km along strike and up to 700 m 

across strike, with mineralisation present from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 56 m. 
Average mineralisation thickness is 13 m. Virtually 100% of the Ardnaree resource is located within 
50 m from the topographic surface.  Mineralisation at Ardnaree is characterised by an overall 

northeast trend and a sub-horizontal to horizontal dip. 

As drill defined to 2018, the Thuddungra deposit extends 5.9 km along strike up to the northern 

boundary of the JRV licences and up to 715 m across strike, with mineralisation present from 6 m 
below the topography surface to a maximum vertical depth of 98 m.  Average mineralisation 
thickness is 22 m.  Approximately 80% of the Thuddungra resource is located within 50 m from the 

topographic surface. Mineralisation at Thuddungra is characterised by an overall north-northeast 

trend. 

1.4 Mineral Resource Estimate 

During June 2018, Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Pty Ltd (Snowden) updated Mineral 

Resource estimates to incorporate additional drilling completed in February 2018 by JRV, together 

with additional multi-element assays completed in 2018 on samples from earlier drill programs. 

The Nico Young nickel/cobalt deposit is reported at a 0.5% Ni as listed in Table 1.4.1. 

The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared under the direction of a Qualified Person, as 

defined in NI 43-101, using accepted industry practice and have been classified and reported in 
accordance with the JORC Code (2012). There are no material differences between the definitions 
of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources under the CIM Definition Standards and 

the equivalent definitions in the JORC Code.

resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 

applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no 

certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

The Mineral Resource estimates were prepared in the following steps: 

 Data compilation and validation – this was undertaken by OMI Pty Ltd (OMI) and 

Geostats Services Pty Ltd (Geostats) on behalf of JRV and reviewed. 

 Data preparation. 

 Geological interpretation and modelling. 

 Establishment of block models. 

 Compositing of assay intervals. 

 Exploratory data analysis of Ni, Co and other constituents. 

 Analysis of top-cuts. 

 Variogram analysis. 

 Derivation of kriging plan and boundary conditions. 

 Grade interpolation of Ni, Co and other constituents. 

 Validation of grade estimates.

1.5 Mining 

The PEA mining study for Nico Young was completed by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Pty 

Ltd (Snowden).  As the majority of the resource is classified as Inferred, no Mineral Reserves were 
estimated, and the reader is reminded to apply caution in the interpretation of the results due to the 
limited confidence of the tonnes and grade reflected in the Mineral Resource classification of 

Inferred. 

1.5.1 Mining Method 

Mining at Nico Young can be completed with conventional truck and shovel mining methods. It is 
anticipated that blasting will not be necessary.  The orebodies are flat lying.  Waste overburden will 

be stripped on 4 m benches, and ore on 2 m flitches for additional selectivity.  Loading will be with 

190-t excavators and haulage with 90-t trucks. 

Reverse circulation (RC) grade control drilling will be completed at 10 m x 10 m spacing to define 

the waste/ore boundary ahead of mining.  

Mined-out pits will be backfilled with mine waste to surface.  Temporary external dumps will be 
utilised when no pit void is available at the time of mining.  There are no permanent waste dumps. 

Ore will be transported to a central leach pad or stockpiles near each deposit (for low grade).  

1.5.2 Mine Design 

To consider the proposed mining method, the resource model was converted to a mining model to 
reflect anticipated mining dilution and mining loss.  The model was re-blocked to 25 m x 25 m x 2 m 

to mimic the mining panel depths.  

The pits were optimised based on economic assumptions supplied by JRV.  

To expedite the mining of higher value areas, and to develop pit voids for waste storage, pits were 
split into stages (of approximately 200 m x 200 m size).  Waste and topsoil dumps were designed 

to store sufficient capacity as identified within the pit designs and road stripping. 

An overall mine layout is shown in Figure 1.5.1

1.5.4 Mining Production Schedule 

The mine production schedule was based upon a target processing rate of 3,000 kt/a.  The 

schedule considered: 

 Maximising revenue by targeting grade.

 Minimisation of the number of active areas. 

 Providing early access to pit voids for backfilling. 

 Smooth the overall mining rates. 

The annual mining rate peaks at about 11.0 Mt/a for years 2 to 7 before reducing to 6.0 Mt/a to 
8.0 Mt/a after year 8 for the remainder of the project (Figure 1.5.2).  There are six months of mining 
in pre-production. Mining commences at the northern end of Ardnaree.  The mining direction for 

each deposit is generally away from the leach pad.  The Ardnaree pits are complete by year 12 and 

by year 20 for Thuddungra. 

Note that the scheduled tonnes and grade do not represent an estimate of Mineral Reserves.

The mine can supply the necessary processing capacity (Figure 1.5.3).  The mine supplies higher 

nickel grades in the early mine life; early years with lower nickel grade generally correspond to 

elevated cobalt.

1.6 Metallurgy 

 Based on previous successful heap leach studies conducted by Duyvestyn in 2002/2003 (Ref 

1,2,3), JRV elected to continue to investigate the heap leach potential of the Nico Young ores.  

Drilling was conducted at the Ardnaree deposit in early 2017. The drill program consisted of both 

RC and diamond core. The location of the diamond core was selected to provide spatially 
representative samples of the three major ore types, Limonite, Saprolite and Weathered 
Serpentinite with sufficient sample to allow for the necessary laboratory testwork to be undertaken 

to support this study. 

Consultant Mworx (Mr David Readett B Eng Met Eng, FAusIMM, CP(Met)) was contracted to 

provide metallurgical consulting services and establish and manage the metallurgical testwork 

program. 

The metallurgical test program was established to provide the necessary inputs to allow for the 
development of the Process Design Criteria commensurate with the accuracy and detail of the 
study.  Internationally recognised laboratories and testing facilities, SGS Metallurgy in Perth, 

HydroGeoSense Ltd in Tucson and Brisbane Met Laboratory in Brisbane were utilised to undertake 

specific aspects of the testwork programme. 

The testwork included Geometallurgical testing at Brisbane Met Laboratory of 160 samples across 
the Ardnaree resource, to determine total acid soluble Ni and Co contents and acid consumption 
characteristics.  Composites representing the three major ore types, namely Limonite, Saprolite 

and Weathered Serpentinite were established and subjected to detailed physical and chemical 

characterisation, bottle roll testing and column leach testing.

A summary of the results to date is shown in Table 1.6.1.  These show a high proportion of the Ni 
(79% for Limonite to 91% for Saprolite) and Co (89% for Limonite to 84% for Saprolite) are present 
as acid soluble species in the range of acid consumption of 330 to 660kg/t.  As expected the 

Limonite exhibited lower Ni solubility than the Saprolite/Weathered Serpentinite.

The testwork indicated that there was a low degree of variability across the Ardnaree deposit with a 
soluble Ni standard deviation of < +/-15%, Co of < +/-12% and Acid consumption slightly more 

variable at < +/- 20%. 

Similar results are anticipated, and have been forecast, for the Thuddungra deposit as it is 
geologically similar and previous metallurgical testing gave very similar Ni recoveries for the 

limonite, saprolite and weathered serpentinite.  This will be confirmed in future testing. 

The composite samples were each characterized with assay, mineralogy, particle size distribution, 

size by size elemental distribution, work and abrasion indices.

The limonite contains mostly Fe oxides/hydroxides (50%) with about 42% silicates, 4% chromite, 
1% ilmenite and 2% asbolane.  The saprolite consists of about 79% silicates with 17% Fe 

oxides/hydroxides, 3% chromite, 1% ilmenite and about 0.4% asbolane.

The serpentinite contains 85% silicates consisting of 21% chlorite, 16% serpentinite, 35% quartz, 

11% amphiboles.  

Co deports 100% to asbolane in all samples. In the limonite composite 56% of the Ni deports to Fe 
oxides/hydroxides with 25% residing in chlorite, 16% in asbolane and minor amounts in Fe/Mg 
amphibole and serpentine. In the saprolite 57% of the Ni resides in chlorite with 21% in Fe 

oxides/hydroxides, 11% in serpentine, 6% in asbolane and 5% in Fe/Mg amphibole.  In the 
serpentinite 47% of the Ni is in chlorite, 22% in serpentine, 19% in Fe oxides/hydroxides, 7% in 

asbolane and 4% in Fe/Mg amphibole. 

Standard Bond Impact Work Indices and Abrasion Indices were established for each composite.  
Limonite BWi was 1.9 kWh/t with a range of 0.1 to 14.5 and Saprolite was 4.2 kWh/t with a range of 

0.5 to 22.5.  Abrasion indices for the three samples were 0.0063 for limonite, 0.0346 for Saprolite 

and 0.1380 for Weathered Serpentinite. 

The particle size distribution (PSD) and size by size elemental distribution were determined on the -
25mm crushed ore.  The ore appears quite coarse for a laterite with typically +40-50% of the mass 
in the +4mm category.  The Ni and Co distribution is very even in all cases across the sizing 

distribution.  This highlights that the ores are not amenable to any physical sizing upgrade, as has 

been found for other laterites. 

Representative sub samples of the three composites (limonite, saprolite and weathered 
serpentinite) were prepared by SGS to -25mm and forwarded to HydroGeoSense (HGS) in Tucson 
Arizona for testing.  An additional sample of the saprolite (a residue from prior testing) was also 

tested but it had been crushed to P100 -12.5mm.  

Preliminary head assays and size by size assays were consistent with those obtained by SGS 

confirming the viability and representivity of the composite sub samples.  Agglomeration 
optimisation tests were conducted to determine both optimal moisture addition and optimal 

concentrated sulphuric acid addition. 

Following agglomeration optimisation Stacking tests and Hydrodynamic Column Tests were 
conducted on each sample.  The results from the hydrodynamic characterization of the three ore 

types and additional finer crush saprolite sample from the Nico Young deposits show that optimal 
agglomeration was found to occur at acid addition rates of 50-100kg/t of acid at a moisture 

contents of 31% for limonite, 25% for Saprolite and 21% for Weathered Serpentinite. 

Agglomeration of the samples produce a product with a total porosity and hydraulic conductivity to 
support percolation leaching of a lift height of up to 10 m (Figures 1.6.1 and 1.6.2).  The initial 

percolation capacity of these samples will easily support a solution irrigation rated of 10 L/h/m2.  It 
is expected that the Saprolite will show the best hydraulic behaviour of these three ore types. 

Blending the Limonite and the Serpentinite ore with the Saprolite is recommended.

Figure 1.6.4 Bottle Roll Acid Consumption vs Ni Dissolution 

 

It is generally accepted that any form of atmospheric leaching of limonitic style Ni laterites tends to 
exhibit both the rate and extent of Ni dissolution that is lower than that of the saprolitic materials. 

The original column testing conducted by Duyvestyn (1,2 and 3) as well as the GeoMetallurgical 

testing indicated this was the case.  

The mineralogy indicates that for the limonite almost 60% of the Ni is associated with the Fe 
oxides/hydroxides.  The Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeO.OH/Fe2O3) leaching is slow with relatively low 
acid consumption but also exhibits a high rate of dissolution of Fe versus Ni.  The remainder of the 

Ni is associated with chlorite (Mg, Fe)5(Si3Al)O10(OH)8 and Serpentine Mg3Si2O5(OH)4.  These 
minerals are more rapid leaching but higher acid consuming as they generate soluble Mg, Al and 

Fe sulphates as the Ni is released. 

The saprolite with 60% of the Ni associated with the chlorite, exhibits higher rates and extents of Ni 
dissolution, at higher acid consumption due to generation of the soluble Mg, Al and Fe sulphates. 

The ratio of Fe to Ni dissolution is much lower than that of the limonite as the saprolite contains 
only a lower content of Fe oxides/hydroxides (of which only 20% of the Ni is associated).  This is 
clearly seen in the assays with limonite at 25.5% Fe and saprolite only 14.8% Fe.  For the 

weathered serpentinite 50% of the Ni is associated with serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) and 20% 
with both as the chlorite ((Mg, Fe)5(Si3Al)O10(OH)8) and Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeO.OH/Fe2O3).  
So as with the saprolite the majority of Ni leaches readily with the acid consumed mainly via Mg 

and the Fe and Al.  Interestingly for the weathered serpentinite the Ni associated with the Fe 

oxides/hydroxides does not seem to have inhibited the rate or extent of Ni recovery.

The Bottle Roll data using the finer crush sizes indicated potential to improve rate of Ni dissolution 
but the finer crush size did not affect the extent of Ni dissolution (Figure 1.6.5). Geotechnical and 
Hydrodynamic testing has indicated that the finer crush size will support heap leaching for the 

Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite.

The results for the 2m columns for the three ore types are summarised in the Figures 1.6.6 and 
1.6.7 below.  Figure 1.6.6 show the rate of Ni and Co dissolution based on days of leaching with 

Figure 1.6.7 showing the relationship between acid consumption and Ni dissolution.  The results 
are consistent with previous data showing the Weathered Serpentinite and Saprolite achieving 
>80% Ni and 90% Co dissolution.  The slower leaching limonite achieved similar Co dissolution but 

significantly lags behind the others with only 50-55% Ni dissolution.  The acid consumption 

characteristics in regard to the dissolution of Ni are consistent and specific to each ore type.

85% and Co 90 to 95%.  Typical leach times are 120 to 150 days.  The Ni and Co dissolution are 
then plotted against the volume of leach solution applied (leach solution application measured as 
kL of solution per t of ore).  This indicates that although the 2 and 4m column exhibit similar leach 

times in terms of days the 4m column utilises less leach solution to achieve the same recovery. 
This is as expected with the higher heap height achieving greater solution efficiency and efficiency 

of acid consumption. 

Figure 1.6.10 displays the relationship of acid consumption to the rate and extent of Ni dissolution. 
This indicates for the tests conducted that the acid consumed (to leach the Ni) is independent of 

the rate or concentration of acid supplied.

The very high acid consumption of 450-650kg/t is driven by the laterite host minerals namely 
chlorite and serpentine.  As the acid is consumed by the host chlorite, serpentine, Fe 
oxide/hydroxide, and asbolane minerals, dissolution of Fe, Al, Mg and Ca occurs and other minor 

impurities also report into the solution including Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn. The extent of acid consumption is 

in decreasing order Fe, Al, Mg. 

The extent of dissolution and the resultant concentration in the PLS significantly impact the 
downstream processing.  The neutralisation stage is where the majority (>99.5%) of the Fe and Al 

are removed. 

For the duration of the column leach tests the PLS is assayed on a regular basis and the 
deportment of impurities Fe, Al, Mg and Ca, Cu, Cr, Mn is tracked.  Based on analysis and 

interpretation of the full suite of column tests, Table 1.6.5 summarises the expected dissolution on 
major impurities which is driven by the acidic dissolution of the dominant Ni bearing minerals 

(chlorite, serpentine, Fe oxide/hydroxide).

A two stage Acid and Fe/Al Neutralisation circuit was tested, as Mworx previous experience had 
indicated this as the preferred method to minimise potential Ni and Co losses.  The tests were set 
up as single stage CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor), with PLS feed to achieve a reactor 

residence time of 3hrs.  Two tests were performed, with the initial tests used to confirm the 
testwork protocol and system as well as providing guidance for the target optimal operating 

conditions.  The conditions for the second tests are summarised in Table 1.6.7.

At this stage no testing of the downstream process route inclusive of direct solvent extraction and 
Ni sulphate crystallization has been undertaken.  Mworx experience and public domain information 

however indicate that the neutralised PLS would be amenable to direct solvent extraction. 

It has long been recognised (Ref 7,8,9,10,11 and 12) that it is necessary to scale-up the Ni and Co 
dissolution results from column testwork to reflect the non-ideal production conditions that exist in a 

commercial production scale heap leach operation.  Column leach testwork is conducted on small 

samples of ore under ideal conditions in a laboratory environment. 

Historically for Cu oxides and sulphides, scale-up has also been applied to the acid consumption.  
However, based on prior experience, Mworx has established that this acid consumption scale-up 
was not necessary for Ni laterite heap leaching.  The leaching chemistry and the relationship 

between acidic destruction of the laterite to release the Ni (and Co) do not change with scale and 
the scaled solution application established for the metal recovery allows for the inefficiencies of 

acid delivery to the ore in a commercial heap. 

For the scale-up of the column test results to the required Pre-Feasibility Study Process Design 
Criteria (PDC) inputs (which are required for a commercial production heap leach operation), 

Mworx has previously used the method described in the following section of this report.  This 
method has also been utilised by internationally recognised metallurgical consultants Miller 

Metallurgical Services Ref. 12). 

The process of scaling-up involves the following 4 steps: 

 Step 1 – Adjust the Ni and Co dissolution obtained from the column tests.  

 Step 2 – Scale Up the volume of leach solution required. 

 Step 3– Leach time adjustment. 

 Step 4– Acid consumption adjustment. 

This process was undertaken on the data from the 4m columns as the original basis of design was 

4m heaps. The resultant scaled-up commercial heap leach Ni and Co dissolution curves are shown 

below in Figure 1.6.11.

The metallurgical testwork program indicated that for a 2-stage neutralisation, Ni and Co losses to 
the residue were in the order of 0.5 to 1%.  With the inclusion of seed recycle in both stages and 
inclusion of a re-leach stage for the secondary neutralisation solids it is anticipated losses will be 

minimised to 1.0%.  

Subsequent testing of a two stage MHP indicated Ni and Co recovery in excess of 99%.  The 

process design considers the recycle of the second stage MHP which will allow the second stage 
to be operated to maximise Ni and Co extraction and hence minimise loss.  It is anticipated that 

losses will be kept to 1.0%.  

Previous Mworx experience with a similar downstream direct solvent extraction recovery process 

through to Ni sulphate indicated Ni and Co recoveries of 97%

Combining the calculated heap leach scaled up values and the downstream losses provides 

guidance for the overall process design criteria.  These numbers are provided below in Table 1.6.9. 

As the metallurgical testwork was conducted in parallel to the process modelling and design it was 
necessary to provide preliminary Design Criteria inputs based on the preliminary data available, 
before completion of any tests.  The values utilised for the PDC are also provided in the table.  The 

Revised PDC utilises the metallurgical testwork data and has been adopted as the basis for design 

for this study. 

The Bottle Roll data using the finer crush sizes indicates potential to improve the rate of Ni 
recovery but not the ultimate extent of Ni recovery.  The acid consumption characteristics appear 
unchanged.  Geotechnical and Hydrodynamic testing has indicated that the finer crush size will 

support heap leaching for the Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite.  At this stage the results from 

the finer crush size have not been incorporated into the revised PDC.

1.7 Process Plant 

The process concept is based on the production of high value added products via a Refinery back 
end, in this case, direct solvent extraction of neutralised PLS from the heap leach, culminating in 

the production of a nickel sulphate solid and a cobalt sulphide product.  The refinery back-end was 
largely based on a hybrid circuit utilising a similar processing circuit to the Bulong Nickel laterite 
plant, with some improved changes in the solvent extraction area.  The overall schematic 

flowscheme is shown in Figure 1.7.1.  The process plant consists of a number of major sections, 

which have different planned operating schedules.  The major sections are: 

 Crushing, agglomeration and stacking. 

 Heap leaching. 

 Acid plant. 

 Solution processing plant. 

 Products Refinery. 

 Residue Storage Facility (RSF). 

The solution processing plant consists of a number of sections, as follows: 

 Iron and Aluminium precipitation. 

 Manganese and magnesium precipitation. 

The products refinery also consists of a number of sections: 

 Separation of cobalt and nickel values by solvent extraction.

1.8 Project Infrastructure 

1.8.1 Surface Layout 

A preliminary layout for the mine and process plant surface facilities has been prepared.  The 
layout of facilities has been prepared to take advantage of existing topographical features to the 

extent possible.  At the 3 Mtpa scale of capacity, this has resulted in plant infrastructure being 

located outside the current exploration lease boundary. 

The surface layout will cut across existing roads and tracks, some of which will still be required to 
service operations/properties not associated with the Nico Young Project, in particular Mines Road 
and Ballards Road.  Consideration will need to be given to diverting these roads as part of the 

project development. 

Some major infrastructure has not yet been sufficiently defined to be shown located on the layout 

including the raw water pipeline, railway spur route, construction camp, electrical transmission lines 

(if applicable) and onsite supplementary power station. 

1.8.2 Surface Infrastructure 

The area is subject to grain and livestock farming, apart from a small area quarried for magnesite 

(Young Mining Co. Ltd – Causmag).  As such, there is no exposure of the regolith that has 
developed in the hill slopes and broad valley floors.  Hilltops and ridges contain sporadic outcrop 
and float of basement lithologies, including granodiorite, basic metamorphics, and occasional 

ultrabasic lithologies.  Elevations range from 308 m to 410 m (average 360 m) across the length of 

the deposits. 

The main deposit of Ardnaree is immediately east of Memagong Hill which can be accessed by 

vehicle along sealed and dirt roads/tracks as follows: 

 Via the paved Henry Lawson Way (9 km); turn left onto paved Bribbaree Road (14.6 km); 
turn left onto paved Mines Road (5 km); turn left onto Astons Lane (6.9 km); turn right 

onto farm tracks (2.3 km).  Total distance of 38 km (38 minutes). 

 Alternatively, via the paved Milvale Road and Tubbul Road to Kurrawyba Road in Tubbul 
(33 km); continue on Kurrawya Road and Coddingtons Lane (9.7 km).  Total distance of 

43 km (41 minutes). 

Dirt roads, Astons Lane and Ballards Road, provide access from south to north, essentially parallel 

to the overall strike of the Young deposits. 

There is year-round access along the local gazetted roads.  Access along farm tracks may be 

difficult in wet weather.

distance, west-northwest of Young, the nearest population and services centre (light industrial, 

retail, educational, agricultural). 

Young is a town in the South West Slopes region of NSW, Australia and the largest town in Hilltops 
Council (former council areas of Boorowa, Harden and Young).  At 9 August 2016, the population 

was 7,170.  Young is promoted as the Cherry Capital of Australia and is situated on the Olympic 

Highway and is approximately two hours' drive from the Canberra area (population 390,000). 

The Nico Young Project is ideally located geographically due to its proximity to rail, major highways 

and the National Electricity Grid. 

1.8.3 Power Supply 

There are a number of options available to provide electric power to the project including: 

 Connection to the local electrical grid. 

 Onsite generation by cogeneration of power with steam produced in the sulphuric acid 

plant. 

 Onsite generation of power in a diesel, natural gas or fuel oil fired power station with 

supplementary renewables generation. 

 A hybrid mixture of all or some of the above. 

The PEA compared the options of grid connection and onsite generation by cogeneration from 

steam produced by the acid plant.  The acid plant will be operated to generate the required plant 
electrical demand at all times by either producing excess acid into storage on ore types with lower 
acid demand or withdrawing acid from storage when processing ore types with higher acid 

demand.  The capacity for bulk acid storage will need to be selected to ensure this is possible 
when a detailed mine schedule becomes available in later project phases.  For the present level of 

study acid storage capacity is considered to be adequate based on annual mine schedules. 

An economic evaluation demonstrates conclusively that onsite generation from the acid plant with 

supplementary supply is the preferred option. 

1.8.4 Water Supply 

The selection of a suitable water source was based on the ability to supply from 3000ML to 
5500ML annually.  The higher end was revised back from 9000ML during the course of the project.  
The required volumes, even at the lower end of the range, ruled out unregulated river sources and 

even stretched the resources of the regulated system.  (Unregulated systems are water sources, 
which run on natural rain events and are not supported by storage dams.  Regulated systems are 

controlled and supported by state owned storage dams.)

The regulated systems will have two Water Access Licence (WAL) categories, which will be of 
interest; these are High Security and General Security.  Temporary Trading is the purchasing or 
selling of available water at any time to supplement a WAL allocation.  Both WAL categories can 

temporary trade allocation water during a water year.  The mine will predominantly require (if not 

all) High Security licences to ensure the most reliable supply for a continuous operation. 

1.8.5 Supply, Transport & Logistics 

In August 2018 JRV engaged Lycopodium Infrastructure Pty Ltd (LIPL) to conduct a review of 

transport and logistics relating to the import of reagents for mining operations at the proposed Ni co 
Young mine in Central West NSW.  Transport options relate generally to the import of bulk sulphur 
or bulk sulphuric acid into the East Coast Ports of Newcastle, Port Botany or Port Kembla and 

transportation to site.  The study has also considered the import of reagents into the Port of 

Melbourne. 

LIPL was requested to consider transport and logistics options and potential costs in more detail for 
mine production rates of up to 3 million tonne pa (ROM ore).  At the this mining rate, quantities of 
reagent (either bulk sulphur or sulphuric acid) are significant and the cost of transport of these 

reagents is considered to have a material impact on the feasibility of the project.  The LIPL Study 
Team have focused efforts on understanding the scope of materials handling facilities required at 
various Ports and at the mine, as well as the transport costs from the studied Ports to the mine.  

Where possible, consultation with Port owners and transport operators has been undertaken to 
improve the accuracy of budget pricing and verify assumptions made.  The Study team have been 
particularly grateful for the assistance provided by Aurizon and representatives from the Port of 

Newcastle, Port Kembla and the Port of Melbourne throughout the study. 

A financial assessment based on a pre-feasibility study level estimate of capital and operating 

costs has been provided for a range of options covering: 

 Import into various Ports (Newcastle, Port Kembla and Port of Melbourne). 

 Bulk sulphur Vs bulk sulphuric acid transport. 

 Road Vs Rail transport from Port to Mine, considering also the sub option of 

establishment of an intermodal terminal adjacent to the existing rail mainline. 

 A range of ROM annual production rates (1 mtpa ROM mining rate and 3 mtpa ROM 

mining rate). 

Findings 

The key findings of the study are presented below.  The findings presented assume the high Net 

Present Cost for sulphuric acid transport cannot be offset through a reduction in process costs at the 

mine, to the extent that acid transport becomes competitive against sulphur transport:

 Ports: Import of reagents into each of the three Ports is considered feasible, with each 
Port showing interest in the potential operation.  The advantages and disadvantages of 
each Port have been summarised in relation to their ability to support both sulphur and 

sulphuric acid import and dispatch.  The advantages and disadvantages of each Port are 

summarised in the following table:

 Transport Mode: Transport by road and or rail is feasible from each Port to either an 
intermodal terminal within proximity of Nico Young or directly to the Nico Young mine site.  
Based on the financial analysis, road transport is the most cost effective option for 

transporting reagents at the 1 Mtpa ROM ore mining rate, whilst rail transportation is 

more economical at the 3 Mtpa ROM ore mining rate;

 Intermodal Terminal Vs Rail Spur: It is possible to establish an Intermodal Terminal at 
Cootamundra (or another location on the Main South rail line) for the transfer of bulk 
sulphur from rail to road, however the financial analysis indicates that the construction of 

a spur line off the ARTC Parkes to Stockinbingal line and rail transport from Port directly 
to site is the most economical method of transport for the higher mining rate considering 

the life of mining. 

 Bulk Sulphur V Sulphuric Acid:  The financial assessment of options has provided a 
broad range of costs, which have been assessed on a Net Present Cost (NPC) basis for 

the various scenarios considered.  Based on the significant difference in Net Present 
Cost between bulk sulphur transport and sulphuric acid transport (approx. $300m @ 1 

Mtpa, and approx. $800m @ 3 Mtpa) the transport of sulphuric acid is not recommended.   

 Preferred Transport Routes: The following are the preferred transport routes based on 
the financial assessment and considering the advantages and disadvantages of each 

route option: 

Mining 
Rate 

Reagent 
Transport 

Mode 
Import Port Comments 

1 Mtpa 
ROM ore  

Bulk Sulphur Road (direct to 
site) 

Port Kembla Both Kembla and Newcastle 
Ports would be able to support 
bulk import. Negotiation is 
recommended with each.  

3Mtpa 
ROM ore 

Bulk Sulphur Rail (direct to 
site) 

Newcastle As above. If a staged stagged 
approach is favoured (ie – 
ramping up tonnage over time) 
then Port Kembla would be the 
logical location to base Import 
for short and long term 
operations. 

 

 Outcomes of the Financial Analysis: Capex and Opex for each option have been 
estimated using a range of pricing techniques.  Where possible, modelled pricing has 
been calibrated against recent industry benchmarks and budget pricing provided by Port 

owners and transport operators.  The Net Present Cost (NPC) of each transport option 
has been assessed against the lower mining rate of 1mtpa (ROM ore) and the upper 
mining rate of 3 Mtpa (ROM ore) in order to comparatively assess the options.  The NPC 

for the 3 Mtpa option is presented below, expressed as the total NPC over the life of the 

operation as well as the $/product tonne.

1.9 Capital Cost Estimate 

Capital costs were developed for a 3.0 Mtpa feed rate including a refinery to produce nickel 
sulphate and cobalt sulphide as products.  While the bulk of the estimate was prepared at the Pre-

Feasibility level of accuracy, ± 25%, the refinery component was only estimated at the concept / 
scoping study level of ± 35%, as a result of lack of supporting detail for this process.  The overall 
capital cost estimate is considered to be at the ± 25% accuracy level as of 3Q18.  Because of the 

lack of supporting detail for the refinery case, the estimate for this case is considered to have an 

accuracy level range of ± 25 - 30% and is presented as of 1Q19. 

The estimate addresses the engineering, procurement, construction, and start-up of the mine and 
processing facilities, as well as the ongoing sustaining capital costs.  Total initial capital cost for 3.0 
Mtpa including refinery is estimated at AUD$1,112.5 M.  This initial expenditure is envisioned to be 

completed over a 48 month construction schedule, with heap leach and production commencing 

progressively over this period.  The capital cost estimate is summarised in Table 1.9.1

1.11 Economic Analysis 

JRV has prepared its evaluation and assessment of the Nico Young Nickel Cobalt project based on 
a discounted cash flow model, from which the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return 
(IRR), payback, and other measures of the project pre-feasibility are determined.  The main 

economic assumptions used in the base case are presented in Table 1.11.1.  

It should be noted that the preliminary economic assessment within this study is preliminary in 

nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to 
have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorised as 
mineral reserves.  There is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realised. 

 There has been no Ore Reserve estimate developed.  There is no certainty that further exploration 
work will result in the determination of adequate measured and indicated mineral resources or that 
the production targets underlying the study will be realised.  Further evaluation work and 

appropriate studies in DFS are required to establish sufficient confidence that this target will be 
met.  This preliminary economic assessment was determined based on assumptions as laid out in 

Section 22.   

Despite its early nature, this preliminary economic assessment is considered to be sufficiently 
promising to move forward into the next phase of drilling and then study, particularly in light of the 

commodity outlook for nickel and cobalt relating to the electrification of the global transportation 

industry.

The project cost economic evaluation summary and cash flow statement indicate that the total 
project capital costs were evaluated at USD 778.8M.  This includes all initial project capital up to 
the achievement and stabilisation of nameplate capacity.  The life of mine sustaining capital 

requirement was evaluated at USD 311.1M.  A closure cost provision is included in the open pit 

and underground operating cost per tonne. 

The total revenue derived from the sale of the saleable product from the processing plant was 
estimated at USD 7,076.4M (USD 5,269.9M from Nickel and USD 1,779.5M from cobalt), or on 
average, USD 120/tonne processed.  The total site and offsite operating costs, including all 

royalties, were estimated at USD 4,318. 3M, or on average, USD 73/tonne processed. 

The financial results indicate a before-tax NPV of USD 341.1M at a real discount rate of 8.0%.  The 

before-tax nominal IRR is 16.9% and positive cash flow starts the first operating year once initial 

capital has been completed. 

The after-tax NPV is USD 179.6M at a real discount rate of 8.0%.  The after-tax nominal IRR is 

14.4%. 

A summary of the overall economic evaluation results is shown in Table 1.11.2.

It is to be noted that the preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and 

there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.

culmination of this work will be a bankable definitive feasibility study ("DFS") and a fully permitted 

project, including receipt of mining lease and all operating licenses. 

The DFS cannot commence until geological confidence in the Nico Young Mineral Resource is 
significantly improved.  This is outline in a planned sequential drilling programme across Ardnaree 
(phase 1(a)) and Thuddungra (phase 1(b)).  Whilst the exploration activities are budgeted to be 

sequential they are independent, and results and availability of capital dependent.   

Drilling will initially occur on the Ardnaree deposit to improve the geological level of confidence.  

Until this time other workstreams shall be paused, to ensure that DFS level engineering only occurs 
on a Mineral Resource Estimate with the requisite level of geologoical confidence.  Thereafter the 
Thuddungra programme will be initiated.  Early works in the DFS, particularly those associated with 

environmental and permitting approvals, will also likely commence in conjunction with Thuddungra 

resource definition.

1.12.1 Mineral Resource 

The following further activities related to Mineral Resource estimation are recommended: 

 Currently, the Nico Young Mineral Resources are classified largely as Inferred due to the 

wide spaced drill pattern.  Infill drilling to a pattern of 100 m x 50 m should be considered 
by JRV to achieve, as a minimum, the establishment of a large component of "Indicated" 
Resources, provided that drilling and sampling conditions are adequate and that JRV's 

comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures are followed. 

 Future drill programs should consider better ways of keeping the cyclone clean by using 

low friction liners (such as ceramic tiles) or mechanical wipers inside the cyclone. 

 Initial follow-up aircore drilling program at a spacing of 100m x 50m for a planned total of 

186 holes for 6253 metres.  Drillhole planning has been guided by initial pit shells 
generated and has been targeted to bring the resource on the Ardnaree deposit up to 
"Indicated" classification over all pit shells except pit 8 at the southern end of the 

Ardnaree deposit. Pit 8 is anticipated to be mined late in the preliminary mining schedule.  

Total budget for this drilling is $670,000. 

 Further infill drilling on the Thuddungra deposit should also be completed at a spacing of 
100m x 50m.  At the time of this report, insufficient results had been received from the 
July to September 2018 drilling program on the Thuddungra deposit to allow accurate 

planning.  Planning for the Thuddungra deposit infill drilling is expected to be conducted 

in early 2019.

 A pattern of close spaced drilling (5m x 5m) should be considered in select areas of 
cobalt mineralisation to aid in future grade control drill spacing analysis and to test short 

range continuity of cobalt mineralisation. 

 More cost efficient methods for relative density measurements should be investigated 
such as down hole nuclear densometer.  Such downhole methods would require casing 

drillholes but may be more cost effective than drill core and wrapped immersion 

techniques that are also time consuming. 

1.12.2 Metallurgy 

 The testwork conducted to date has concentrated on the Ardnaree deposit and providing 

sufficient information to support the PFS.  It has been assumed that the Thuddungra 
deposit ore types will behave similarly to that of Ardnaree but this must be proven in the 

next phase of study. 

 Based on an improved geological, mining, metallurgical and geometallurgical 
understanding it is necessary to undertake significant additional drilling to provide 

sufficient representative samples of ore types and potential ore type variability. 

 The following metallurgical testwork has been identified as necessary to support the basis 

of a definitive feasibility study (DFS).  Samples should be collected from future 
resource/reserve definition drilling planned to completed as part of the DFS from the 

Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits that make up the Nico Young project. 

The recommended testwork is broken down into four broad categories: 

 GeoMetallurgical Testing. 

 Material Characterisation and Batch Column Leach Testing. 

 Batch Neutralisation and DSX testing. 

 Integrated Pilot Plant for generation of marketing samples. 

It is anticipated that the testwork program would take approximately 18 months to complete. 

1.12.3 Processing 

 The sulphuric acid plant size has been selected based on the current annual mine plan.  
As more detailed mine plans become available the acid plant size and acid plant bulk 
storage capacity needs to be re-assessed to ensure that the plant is sufficiently sized to 

accommodate variations in ore type that will present to the plant over the life of mine. 

 Once laboratory results for the products refinery process have been obtained, a further 

phase of engineering design for the refinery process needs to be undertaken to bring the

capital and operating cost estimates up to the same level of confidence as the remainder 

of the process. 

1.12.4 Mining 

The following activities are recommended to be completed as a priority to improve confidence in 

the mine plan: 

 Further resource drilling to improve the confidence in the resource to bring it to Indicated 

Resources classification to support the potential for Ore Reserves. 

 Geotechnical drilling and analysis to provide confidence in the slope design, 

excavatability and trafficability. 

 Full water and environmental review to identify any risks for practical mine planning. 

 Further work to improve confidence in the underlying technical and economic parameters 

of the project. This includes: 

- development of a geometallurgical program with associated modelling.  This 
should aim to define metallurgical recoveries and acid requirements for all 

material types and by grade 

- refinement and additional support for operating costs through sourcing of 
quotations from the market. 

 Revision of the mine plan to consider all updated information. 

1.12.5 Supply Transport and Logistics 

Lycopodium Infrastructure recommends the following activities to be undertaken in the next project 

phase: 

 It is recommended JRV consider the findings presented in Supply Transport and Logistics 
report and enter into further negotiations with the preferred Port owners to define the 
specific scope of work for materials handling facilities and the costs and charges 

associated. 

 It is further recommended that JRV consider the most economic and acceptable form or 

transport to the Mine, develop a specific scope of services for the preferred transport 
case and seek MoU's with preferred transport operators or go to market for pricing for a 

specific transport task. 

 JRV to consider the cost of on site sulphuric acid production compared to the additional 

Net Present Cost of transporting sulphuric acid as presented in this report.

 Undertaken preliminary design of the proposed rail alignment from Weedalion to site by 
obtaining site survey, land title information including mining exploration lease details and 

commissioning a consultancy to complete the design. 

 JRV to consider the FOB costs of importing reagents into the Ports considered in the 

study in deciding which Port options to take into the next stage.  

1.12.6 Infrastructure 

The following recommendations for further work related to site surface infrastructure supply are 

made: 

 Optimise the layout to minimise the extent of area overlap across the lease boundaries. 

 Survey possible routing for the raw water pipeline easement. 

 Survey possible routing for the railway spur into the site. 

 Identify a suitable location for the construction camp. 

 Evaluate the extent of road upgrades required for the project. 

The following recommendations for further work related to project power supply are made: 

 Undertake detailed discussions with Essential Energy to firm up on actual capital 
requirements for grid connection and fixed and variable tariff charges for power supply 
from the grid.  This should cover both the total plant demand and the option of 

supplementary supply. 

 Commence detailed discussion, technical evaluation and trade off studies with the 

Chinese sulphuric acid plant vendor to determine the amount of electric power that can 
be generated from steam produced by the acid plant, and any advantages of including 
black start and emergency power and steam generation in the sulphuric acid plant power 

generation package. 

The following recommendations for further work related to project raw water supply are made: 

 As part of advanced studies in other project disciplines, the project water supply 

requirement should be more closely estimated. 

 Early discussions should be initiated with water funds and supply easement owners to 

establish preliminary conditions, capability, and availability.

 Early discussions should be initiated with the power supply authority to establish 
preliminary conditions, capability, and availability of power along the nominal pipeline 
route, particularly at the Jugiong intake station where power draw will be a significant 

additional draw to the local network. 

 It is recommended that communication continue in follow up phases of investigation with 

Goldenfields Water and Central Tablelands Water to exhaust all potential mutual benefits 

that may present from having a new pipeline to the area. 

The following recommendations for further work related to project hydrogeology are made: 

 Dewatering – Four of the proposed pit areas extend below the water table and will require 

dewatering.  Sump pumping will be required to abstract groundwater inflows and surface 
water run off during the wet season.  Feasibility level designs and cost estimates will be 

required. 

 Surface Water Management – Bunds and pit diversion drains will be required to manage 
the surface water in the pit areas to avoid flooding and geotechnical instability.  Sediment 

traps and seepage capture will be required to manage potential impacts relating to 

surface water quality.  Further work includes: 

- feasibility level designs and cost estimates for surface water management 
infrastructure 

- preparation of a surface water management plan. 

 Environmental Approvals – Further work relating to environmental approvals will 

comprise: 

- a baseline surface water assessment 

- a baseline groundwater assessment – i.e. commencement of monitoring the 
current bores and the installation of additional baseline monitoring bores 

- groundwater modelling for impact assessment (if required) for footprint, 
dewatering / water supply abstraction & recovery. 

 Mine Closure – Further work relating to mine closure will comprise: 

- a hydrological model (including a pit void water balance for both groundwater 
and surface water) 

- groundwater modelling.

recommended: 

 Enter into detailed discussions and bid evaluation with the Chinese equipment vendors to 

ensure that the actual scope required is covered by the bids they have provided. 

 Enter into detailed discussion and technology evaluation with the Chinese vendor for the 

sulphuric acid plant to ensure that the full scope required is included in their bid, and that 
the source of their technology is valid and justified.  Negotiation between the Chinese 
vendor and an Australian construction contractor will be required to ensure that valid 

construction costs for Australia are identified. 

 Enter into discussions with the Chinese vendor for the sulphuric acid plant to include the 

black start power and steam requirements for the sulphuric acid plant as part of the acid 

plant scope. 

 Continue discussion with Essential Energy to identify costs for backup power by 

connection to the NSW electricity grid. 

 Update the Refinery capital and operating cost estimates based on a revised design from 

metallurgical testwork results.

JRV commenced exploration in the Young district in 1998.  Field exploration has included 
geological mapping, ground magnetics, air core drilling, diamond drilling and Caldwell drilling 

followed by metallurgical testing. 

The Mineral Resource at Nico Young was originally estimated in September 2001.  Since that time 

there has been multiple programs of air core, RC and diamond drilling within the nominal resource 
boundaries.  These programs have produced metallurgical samples and provided infill data 
geological data.  The most recent programs were in June 2017, February/March 2018, and July 

August 2018.   

There are 14 Landholders who hold property that either partially or wholly lies within the Group 1 

mineral licence areas.  The relationship with these landholders is kept formal with documented 
requests and subsequent permissions for access to theirs lands for various purposes.  At the same 
time that procedural formality is upheld, the relationships are also cordial and mutually beneficial to 

either party.  Landholder compensation monies are agreed and disbursed accordingly subject to 

the type and duration of the JRV work that is to be undertaken on the property. 

If the project successfully passes through the next phases of investigative, technical, and feasibility 
work then Mining Lease tenure status will need to be applied for.  There are a number of 
prescriptive sequential regulatory steps that need to be observed which are largely concerned with 

development of a suitable Environmental Impact Statement and securing conditional agreements 

with all affected landholders for operational land access.

4.2 Property Description and Ownership 

This Technical Report describes the Nico Young Project ("the Project"), a mineral exploration area 

for nickel cobalt laterite located approximately 30 kilometres (km) west-northwest of the town of 
Young in the State of New South Wales (NSW), Australia.  The Nico Young Project is held by Nico 
Young Pty Ltd under Exploration Licences (ELs) 5571, 5527 and 8698 in accordance with the NSW 

Mining Act 1992 for Group 1 Minerals including nickel and cobalt.  Nico Young Pty Ltd is owned by 
JRV, a company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). JRV's titles cover 40.6 square 

kilometres (km2). 

4.2.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The area is subject to grain and livestock farming, apart from a small area quarried for magnesite 
(Young Mining Co. Ltd – Causmag).  As such, there is no exposure of the regolith that has 
developed in the hill slopes and broad valley floors (Figure 4.2.1).  Hilltops and ridges contain 

sporadic outcrop and float of basement lithologies, including granodiorite, basic metamorphics, and 
occasional ultrabasic lithologies.  Elevations range from 308 m to 410 m (average 360 m) across 

the length of the deposits.

 EL 5527 'Thuddungra' comprises four units.   

 EL8698 'Boulders' granted in March 2018, comprises 3 units.   

All tenements are in good standing against licence conditions. (Table 4.3.1),EL5571 expires on 
05/05/2019.  The application process for renewal of an exploration licence involves completing 
online forms detailing the work completed on the tenement, future planned work on the tenement 

and completion of rehabilitation works on the tenement.  The application is then submitted to the 
relevant government authorities and fees paid.  The government authorities acknowledge receival 
of the application to renew advising that should further information be required a case officer 

assigned will contact Jervois prior to the anniversary date.  Application for Renewal of EL5571 was 
completed and submitted to the Department of Planning & Environment NSW on 3 April 2019.  The 
department sent acknowledgement of renewal application receival and a receipt of renewal fee 

payment for $A2167.20 to Jervois on 5 April 2019. Since this time no further information has been 

requested and Jervois expects EL5571 to renew on the anniversary date 6/5/2019. 

Obligations to retain the exploration licences are: 

 Complete the annual summary expenditure and activity table. 

 Complete annual geoscientific reports. 

 Complete annual environment reports. 

 Complete annual community consultation reports. 

 Pay the annual rental fee. 

 Comply with the NSW exploration regulation under the Mining Act. 

 Maintain the appropriate level of security deposit with the regulator. 

There are no royalties, payments, encumbrances to which the property is subject outside of 
Statutory Annual Rental Fees and Compensation Payments to surface landholders which vary with 

exploration activity. 

Permits are required prior to commencing exploration activities and are applied for on an as needs 

basis.  Jervois Mining has applied for and been granted a permit to conduct the proposed Ardnaree

4.3.1 Land Ownership 

As of March 2018, the properties of 14 landholders are wholly or partly within the boundaries of 

ELs 5571 and 5527, Nico Young Project area (Table 4.3.1 and Figure 4.3.1). 

4.3.2 Local Agriculture and Historic Mining 

Local agriculture is primarily crops (barley, sorghum, wheat and canola) and/or grazing (cattle and 

sheep).  The area also grows cherries and stone fruit.  

Mineral resources are so far limited to magnesite, which is mined by the Young Mining Company 

Ltd, for export.  Historically the area was known for its small gold mines. 

4.4 Physiography  

The local topography comprises rolling hills and valleys.  The Weddin Ranges to the north is the 

highest elevation in the region.  

The Young district is within the Lachlan catchment system.  Surface water is limited to ephemeral 

or seasonal stream flow or constructed dams.   

4.5 Local History 

Before European settlers arrived in Young, members of a family group of the indigenous Wiradjuri 

Nation lived in the region.  Five descendants still live in Young. (Source: "New beginning".  The 

Young Witness.  Fairfax Media. 12 July 2013. Archived from the original on 25 April 2014.) 

James White was the first European settler in the district and established Burrangong Station in 
1826.  Gold was found in the district in 1860. Until that time the area was called Lambing Flat, a 
reference to the grazing of sheep that was the main industry until mining.  The town was gazetted 

in 1861.  The goldfields produced 15,000 kilograms (470,000 oz.) of gold sent by escort from the 
fields. Up to 20,000 miners worked the fields including about 2,000 Chinese miners.  From 
November 1860 through to June 1861, anti-Chinese miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the 

area, now known as the infamous Lambing Flat riots. (Source: History". visityoung.com. Archived 
from the original on 8 February 2007. Retrieved 9 February 2007.)  A Tribute Garden is one of the 

local landmarks and tourist attractions.   

Young is currently known as the Cherry Capital of NSW.  The area is known for its export quality 

cherries and stone fruit.    

4.6 Tenement History 

JRV commenced exploration in the Young district in 1998.  Field exploration has included 
geological mapping, ground magnetics, air core drilling, diamond drilling and Caldwell drilling 

followed by metallurgical testing.

The mineral resource at Young was originally estimated in September 2001.  Since that time, there 
has been multiple programs of air core, RC and diamond drilling within the resource boundaries to 
produce metallurgical samples and to provide infill data, the most recent in June 2017, 

February/March 2018 and July/August 2018.   

Since tenement granting (EL5527 6 October 1998; EL 5571 6 May 1999), 485 drill holes (RC, AC 

and Diamond) for 18,571m have been drilled on the currently held licence area of Els 5527 and 

5571.   

Collar database 'Master Co-ords Young Project 20.11.2018' and accompanying maps showing drill 
collar locations in relation to tenement boundaries, vegetation cover, topographic contours, land 

ownership, photo satellite and base maps have been provided in Reference 14.  

4.7 Landholder Compensation, Rehabilitation, Crop-Yield Assessment 

4.7.1 Landholder Compensation and Rehabilitation Status 2018 

During 2018, JRV completed two programs of Diamond, Reverse Circulation and/or Air Core 

drilling over five properties within the Nico Young project area.  All holes were rehabilitated within 2 

weeks of completion of drilling.  

All property holders were contacted after rehabilitation to confirm they were satisfied with the 
quality of the rehabilitation and that there had been minimal disruption to their properties. All 
landholders were disbursed their respective due and formally agreed compensation amounts in full 

shortly thereafter. Compensation for program 1 at Young of $7,575 was paid during January to 

March 2018, and compensation of $9,600 for program 2 at Thuddungra in July to August 2018. 

4.7.2 Crop-Yield Assessment 

An arrangement to assess crop yield in the areas of drilling was negotiated between JRV and 

potentially affected property holders.  This arrangement formed an addendum to the formal Access 

Agreement signed by each land holder prior to drilling. 

On the 30th October 2018 Andrew Daley from Premier Advisory, Cootamundra, 
(http://www.premieradvisory.net.au/team/andrew-daley)  assessed areas where the 2018 drilling 
programs took place.  Premier Advisory has determined that minor compaction damage was 

caused and little to no ongoing land degradation resulted from drilling activities. Loss of crop 
proved difficult to assess due to the drought conditions experienced in the area during the 2018-19 
cropping season. Compensation is based on costs of compaction regeneration; aerating using a 

ripper, soil conditioning and grader.  A preliminary report from Premier Advisory has been provided 
to JRV with compensation figures.  A full report is forthcoming.  A compensation summary is 

itemised in Table 4.7.1 below.

4.8 Mining Application Procedures 

A broad outline of the steps and processes involved in preparation, lodgement & processing of a 

Mining Lease Application for Nico Young follows: 

Prior to lodging a Mining Lease Application over the areas of interest, the following matters need to 

be addressed: 

 Basic infrastructure type and layout are to be understood for inclusion in an 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) The Mining Lease Application (MLA) area and the 

Development Application Area (DA) are normally arrived at by considering all the factors, 
including but not limited to mining areas, overburden storage areas, plant and associated 
infrastructure, haulage roads, tailings dams and the like.  All extraction areas must fit 

within the MLA, however selected infrastructure and other disturbance may be located 
outside the MLA area under the Ancillary Mining Activity process under the NSW Mining 
Act 1992.  All areas of disturbance must be contained within the area to be approved 

under the EIS.  

 Surface land ownership and access rights are important, including potentially adjacent 

lands.  Objections to the MLA can be lodged on agricultural grounds, improvements and 
the like.  As well as reviewing the situation of principle residences included within the 
MLA, no lease can be granted within 200 metres of the principal residence of an owner or 

occupier without his or her consent.  

 Once all the above elements have been addressed and considered, the EIS and MLA 

areas would typically be established by a multidisciplinary team comprised of tenure 
expert, environmental expert, social expert, and other company representatives.  The 
MLA would then be prepared utilizing extracts from the EIS as required.  The application 

fees required by the Department for lodgement of a lease are $10,000.  The lease would 
be lodged for exactly the same area or a smaller area as addressed under the EIS for the 

DA. 

 The company is not aware of any environmental liabilities that apply to the site. 

 Once Development Approval is granted, the next requirement is to organize for a full 
survey of the proposed licence area as approved under the Development Approval.  Any 
principal residences within 200 metres of the lease boundary where consent has not 

been obtained need to be identified and excluded from the survey.  Instructions for the 

survey are issued by the Department of Planning and Environment.

Page 4.9 
 

 Once the survey has been completed and approved, the Department of Planning and 
Environment is then in a position to formulate conditions and make an offer of grant of a 

lease. 

 The lease on offer of a grant provides for the lodgement of a grant fee of $85.00 per 
hectare or part thereof, a nominal security initially assessed at $10,000 being the 

minimum prescribed, an annual rental at $6.50 per hectare or part thereof as well as an 

Annual Levy initially 1% of the security $100.00. 

 Once lodged, a lease will then be granted and a new lease number allocated.  Operations 
involving mining or ancillary activities cannot commence until a Mining Operations Plan 
(MOP) is lodged and approved.  The MOP requires the submission of a detailed 

Rehabilitation Cost Estimate (RCE) covering the full costs of rehabilitation of the site on 
completion of operations.  The RCE would normally be put together by an environmental 
consultant and be based on the Development Approval and information included in the 

approved EIS. 

 Once the Department approves the MOP, and the new substantial security deposit is 

lodged as assessed from the RCE, then provided all other permits and Licences as 

required are in place, mining operations can commence. 

 Certain parts of the infrastructure for the mine may be constructed that do not specifically 
relate to mining based on the DA approval prior to the MOP approval, also with Activity 
Approval granted under the existing Exploration Licences some pre- preparation may be 

undertaken.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Description 

The prospect is located approximately 25 km NW to W of the Young township NSW, situated 
between the Bribbaree and Tubbul roads.  The topography consists of flat plains between low 

rolling hills.  A line of hills forms a low ridge along the western boundary of the project, particularly 
in the central southern section of the prospect with the highest hills Bald Hill, Stoney Hill, and 

Memagong Hill. 

Figure 5.1.1 Potential Site Heap Leach Pad Area 

 

5.2 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The area is subject to grain and livestock farming, apart from a small area quarried for magnesite 
(Young Mining Co. Ltd – Causmag).  As such, there is no exposure of the regolith that has 
developed in the hill slopes and broad valley floors.  Hilltops and ridges contain sporadic outcrop 

and float of basement lithologies, including granodiorite, basic metamorphics, and occasional 
ultrabasic lithologies.  Elevations range from 308 m to 410 m (average 360 m) across the length of 

the deposits.

5.3 Access 

The main deposit of Ardnaree is immediately east of Memagong Hill which can be accessed by 

vehicle along sealed and dirt roads/tracks as follows: 

 Via the paved Henry Lawson Way (9 km); turn left onto paved Bribbaree Road (14.6 km); 

turn left onto paved Mines Road (5 km); turn left onto Astons Lane (6.9 km); turn right 

onto farm tracks (2.3 km).  Total distance of 38 km (38 minutes). 

 Alternatively, via the paved Milvale Road and Tubbul Road to Kurrawyba Road in Tubbul 
(33 km); continue on Kurrawya Road and Coddingtons Lane (9.7 km).  Total distance of 

43 km (41 minutes). 

Dirt roads, Astons Lane and Ballards Road, provide access from south to north, essentially parallel 

to the overall strike of the Young deposits. 

There is year-round access along the local gazetted roads.  Access along farm tracks may be 

difficult in wet weather. 

5.4 Proximity to Population Centre and Transport 

The mineral exploration tenements of JRV are located from approximately 25.3 km to 28.7 km 
distance, west-northwest of Young, the nearest population and services centre (light industrial, 

retail, educational, agricultural).

Young is a town in the South West Slopes region of NSW, Australia and the largest town in Hilltops 
Council (former council areas of Boorowa, Harden and Young).  At 9 August 2016, the population 
was 7,170.  Young is marketed as the Cherry Capital of Australia and is situated on the Olympic 

Highway and is approximately two hours' drive from the Canberra area (population 390,000). 

The Nico Young Project is ideally located geographically due to its proximity to rail, major highways 

and the National Electricity Grid. 

5.5 Climate and Length of Operating Season 

Young has a temperate climate, with a hot dry summer and cool winter. Key weather parameters 

are provided in Table 5.5.1 for Young Airport located approximately 15 km east of Ardnaree.

With appropriate all-weather gravel roads and drainage, it is expected that mining operations can 

occur all-year round. 

5.6 Surface Rights & Resouces 

According to the NSW Mining Act 1992, the surface rights (top 2 m) is landholder held, below 2 m 

is Crown held; and under the exploration or mining licensing agreement, the exploration/mining 
company legally has rights to explore and mine.  However, all aspects of working with the property 

owners must be undertaken.  With any access denials, there is the possibility of arbitration. 

If the project moves forward and the exploration licenses are converted to mining licenses then 

there is sufficient land available to conduct the mining operation. 

Professional personnel for project operations would be sourced from within Australia and / or 
overseas if required, and trades and unskilled labour would be sourced locally (Hilltops Shire and 

surrounding districts).Rail and Road

The Young area is serviced by railway - the Stockinbingal Parkes railway to the west, and the 
Blainy Demondrille Railway to the east.  Grain sidings are located on each - the Milvale Siding at 
the intersection of Milvale Rd and Schillers Rd, about 20 km SW of the proposed plant site, and the 

Lawson Siding at the intersection of Chilling Works Rd and Henry Lawson Way, about 20 km SE of 
the proposed plant site.  Currently, neither siding is being used for grain rail transport, the grain 
being loaded onto trucks and shipped by road.  The area is well serviced by road being on the 

Olympic Highway with the Newell and Hume Highways located west and east respectively. 

5.7 Electric Power 

Electric power is distributed locally be Essential Energy via an 11 kV distribution network.  A 
Transgrid 132 / 66 KV substation is located at Murrumburrah, south of Young, and 66 KV is 

supplied to the Essential Energy 66 / 11 KV substation at Young.  This substation has a capacity of 
36 MVA and currently supplies 15.5 - 16.3 MVA (according to Essential Energy publicly available 
information).  The substation is located at the intersection of Chilling works Rd and Milvale Rd, 

approximately 23 km from the plant site. The extent to which this substation would require 

upgrading was not investigated as part of the study.

5.9 Natural Gas 

The Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline passes through Young, and a gas compressor and control 

centre is located in Young, supplying gas via laterals to Orange and Wagga Wagga. 

5.10 Airport 

Young is serviced by an airport with a single all weather sealed runway, 1,220 m x 18 m. JRV 

advise that they believe this is suitable for a Beechcraft King Air aircraft. 

Figure 5.10.1 Young Airport 

 

5.11 Accommodation 

Young is the largest town in the region with a population of just over 7,000. It is located in a 
pleasant rural setting, with good access to both Canberra and Sydney.  However, local 
accommodation facilities near Young are limited and will need to be established to service the 

construction and operation phases of the project. 

5.12 Adjacent Properties 

The area is intensively farmed for both crops and livestock. Cherry orchards are located closer to 
Young, and Young claims to be the Cherry capital of Australia.  No cherry orchards were observed 

within the prospective mining area. 

An existing magnesite mine, operated by Young Mining Company Pty Ltd, is located approximately 

3 km to the west of the prospect.  The site mines crushes and screens magnesite, which is then 
transported into Young where it is calcined to produce magnesia for export.  Electric power is 

supplied to the operation and maximum power draw was stated as 0.7 MW.

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 Summary 

The Nico Young Project was identified by JRV by a data search in October 1997 of the Minfinder 
Database of the NSW Department of Mineral Resources.  The search revealed the Memagong 

Nickel Prospect near Young, where in 1967, BHP Co. Ltd (BHP) had conducted a small nickel 
prospecting program in the Thuddungra area, including ground magnetic traverses, geological 
mapping, and 20 preliminary drillholes. BHP concluded at that time that "no economical 

accumulations of nickel or magnesite were detected". 

The BHP drillhole data has not been included in the JRV database as no verifiable information 

regarding location, sample type or quality assurance/quality control (QAQC) is available.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

7.1 Summary 

The Nico Young Project comprises three known soil covered nickel-cobalt laterite deposits: 
Ardnaree, East and West Thuddungra and have been periodically drill sampled since 1998.  The 

Tertiary laterisation has produced a profile over the serpentinites that comprises: 

 Hematitic Clay: Beneath the soil cover (1–2 m), red-brown to purple red clay is the 

dominant lithotype with common to abundant quartz-magnetite pisolites with moderate 

iron cementing in places.  It often contains large lithic fragments in localised sections. 

 Limonitic Clay: This lithotype is dominated by moderate to strong goethite and is orange 
or light-brown colour and is generally fine grained with rare tiny pisolites.  Sub-horizontal 
bands of black manganese that are sometimes strongly foliated and wavy from shearing 

are common.  This horizon is thought to be formed from intense shearing destroying all 
relic textures of the former serpentinite protolith.  This lithotype is considered to contain 

majority of cobalt in manganese and some nickel. 

 Weathered Saprolite – Fresh Serpentinite: These lithotypes occur as many hues of 
greens and some browner colourations.  It is often soft, highly clay altered and often quite 

micaceous with large silver muscovite flakes often found concentrated around the darker 
green minerals in the serpentinite.  It is often highly sheared with visible abundant flow-
banding shear textures indicating an earlier more ductile deformation and sometimes cut 

in places by more recent brittle deformation at steep angles.  This horizon is thought to 
contain the bulk of the nickel mineralisation.  There can be a minor component of fibrous 

minerals in the serpentinites. 

 Ultramafic: This lithology is usually weathered to a light brown-orange colour and has 
some silicification making it quite hard often and causing drilling termination due to bit 

refusal.  It contains white feldspar porphyry-blasts with a green hue from chlorite 
alteration giving the lithology a spotted appearance that is usually foliated.  Shearing 
textures both ductile and brittle are often evident.  The fresh ultramafic is dark green 

black with white spots or lines from feldspar and likely harzburgite. 

The main nickel carrier in the Weathered Serpentinite, Saprolite and Limonite samples is chlorite-

saponite.  Towards the surface, hematite/Fe-hydroxides, asbolane and montmorillonite become 

more important. 

As drill defined to 2018, the Ardnaree deposit extends over 9 km along strike and up to 700 m 
across strike, with mineralisation present from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 56 m. 
Average mineralisation thickness is 13 m. Virtually 100% of the Ardnaree resource is located within 

50 m from the topographic surface.  Mineralisation at Ardnaree is characterised by an overall 

northeast trend and a sub-horizontal to horizontal dip. 

As drill defined to 2018, the Thuddungra deposit extends 5.9 km along strike up to the northern 
boundary of the JRV licences and up to 715 m across strike, with mineralisation present from 6 m

below the topography surface to a maximum vertical depth of 98 m.  Average mineralisation 
thickness is 22 m.  Approximately 80% of the Thuddungra resource is located within 50 m from the 
topographic surface. Mineralisation at Thuddungra is characterised by an overall north-northeast 

alignment trend. 

7.2 Regional Geology 

The source of the nickel/cobalt mineralisation is the Wambidgee Serpentinite of Cambrian age.  
The serpentinites (originally harzburgites) have intruded the Jindalee Beds in elongate north-south 

bodies associated with faulting.  Regionally, the serpentinites are mapped from Grenfell in the north 
to Tumut in the south, a distance of 150 km.  The southern half of this belt are fresh rock and have 
not been lateritised.  In the Young/Cootamundra area, they are flanked on the eastern side by the 

Silurian Young Granodiorite.  It is believed that this is an important factor in the formation of the 
mineralised laterites.  Runoff in the region is from east to west (from the Great Dividing Range) and 
the acid-rich groundwater, after traversing the 30 km-wide granite belt, has chemically leached the 

basic composition of the serpentinites, removing silica, magnesium and other soluble elements 
from its lattice and leaving enriched amounts of less soluble iron, aluminium, nickel and cobalt (Ref. 

25). 

7.3 The Deposits 

The profile and interpreted structure of the regolith developed over ultrabasics (serpentinite) is 

known only from the vertical drilling conducted by JRV. 

The Nico Young Project comprises three known soil covered nickel-cobalt laterite deposits: 
Ardnaree; East and West Thuddungra.  These are held by JRV under New South Wales ELs and

A fourth deposit (Tyagong) located to the north was drilled by JRV.  However, Tyagong and a large 
part of Thuddungra West were subsequently relinquished because the mineralised horizons are 
deep and drilling conditions were problematic due to wet clays.  Mineral Resource estimates in this 

report do not include Tyagong and a large part of Thuddungra West and are restricted to the 

current JRV EL boundaries.

7.4 Laterite Profile  

The Tertiary laterisation has produced the following profile over the serpentinite bodies (Figure 
7.4.1): 

Figure 7.4.1 Typical Regolith Profile 

 

   Source: JRV PowerPoint presentation 

 

7.4.1 Hematitic Clay 

Beneath the soil cover (1–2 m), red-brown to purple-red clay is the dominant lithotype in the aircore 
drilling, with common to abundant quartz-magnetite pisolites with moderate iron cementing in 
places.  It often contains large lithic fragments in localised sections.  It can be difficult to determine 

if these are shear related inclusions of a highly Weathered Serpentinite protolith at a former water 
table level, or if this lithology represents an earlier period of clastic sediments during a long lived 

higher energy water environment. 

7.4.2 Limonitic Clay 

This lithotype is dominated by moderate to strong goethite and is orange or light-brown colour and 
is generally fine grained with rare tiny pisolites.  Sub-horizontal bands of black manganese that are 
sometimes strongly foliated and wavy from shearing are common in core. This horizon is thought to 

be formed from intense shearing destroying all relic textures of the former serpentinite protolith. 

This lithotype is considered to contain majority of cobalt in manganese and some nickel.

7.4.3 Weathered Saprolite – Fresh Serpentinite 

These lithotypes occur as many hues of green and some browner colourations.  It is often soft, 

highly clay altered and often quite micaceous with large silver muscovite flakes often found 
concentrated around the darker green minerals in the serpentinite.  It is often highly sheared with 
visible abundant flow-banding shear textures indicating an earlier more ductile deformation and 

sometimes cut in places by more recent brittle deformation at steep angles. This horizon is thought 
to contain the bulk of the nickel mineralisation.  There can be a minor component of fibrous 

minerals in the serpentinites. 

7.4.4 Ultramafic 

This lithology is usually weathered to a light brown orange colour and has some silicification 
making it quite hard often causing drilling termination due to bit refusal.  It contains white feldspar 
porphyry-blasts with a green hue from chlorite alteration giving the lithology a spotted appearance 

that is usually foliated.  Shearing textures both ductile and brittle are often evident.  The fresh 

ultramafic is dark green black with white spots or lines from feldspar and likely harzburgite. 

7.4.5 Minor Constituents 

Magnesite 

Coarse cream-coloured and generally clayey magnesite fragments are common in some aircore 

holes and can dominate some intervals. 

Smectite Clay 

A dense olive-grey plastic smectitic clay is commonly found above the granite basement at East 
Thuddungra might be a product of contact metamorphism and weathering of overlying serpentinite 

lithologies. 

Sandy Clay 

Pale-coloured sandy clay and locally gravel found typically at shallow depths related to interpreted 
palaeo-drainage channels at East Thuddungra.  Examples in core have identified moderate 
amounts of black carbon from decomposed vegetation and fragments of white carbonate material 

likely calcretion replacement (some bioturbation tubes found).  Typically, there is a fining upwards 
with the quartz grains and modal abundance becoming courser towards bottom of this lithology. 
Occasionally, there are bands of coarser clastic fragments of granite-related material, older 

metamorphosed sediments, serpentinite and ultramafic indicating short higher energy events too 

irregular to be seasonal. 

Saprolitic Granite/Granite 

Along the eastern margin of Thuddungra the basement comprises quartz-feldspar-mica granite 

(granodiorite).  In aircore drillholes, this was invariably highly weathered and saprolitic but often 

retained granitic textures.

7.5 Property Geology 

As drill defined to 2018, the Ardnaree deposit extends over 9 km along strike and up to 700 m 

across strike, with mineralisation present from surface to a maximum vertical depth of 56 m. 

Average mineralisation thickness is 13 m. 

Virtually 100% of the Ardnaree resource is located within 50 m from the topographic surface. 

Mineralisation at Ardnaree is characterised by an overall northeast trend and a sub-horizontal to 

horizontal dip. 

As drill defined to 2018, the Thuddungra deposit extends 5.9 km along strike up to the northern 

boundary of the JRV licences and up to 715 m across strike, with mineralisation present from 6 m 
below the topography surface to a maximum vertical depth of 98 m.  Average mineralisation 

thickness is 22 m. 

Approximately 80% of the Thuddungra resource is located within 50 m from the topographic 

surface. 

Mineralisation at Thuddungra is characterised by an overall north-northeast trend and a sub-

horizontal to gentle dip towards the east.

Nickel content ranges from 0.56% Ni in the Hematite sample to 0.84% Ni in Weathered 
Serpentinite.  Nickel sulphide content is insignificant (<0.003% Ni).  Cobalt content varies from 

150 ppm to 890 ppm with the highest in the Limonite sample.  Scandium content ranges from 

38 ppm in the Hematite sample to 13 ppm in the Weathered Serpentinite). 

Outotec Oy found that nickel correlates positively with magnesium, silica, calcium, and sodium. Iron 
is negatively related to MgO as well as aluminium, manganese, carbon, sulphur, cobalt and 
scandium.  The elemental correlations indicate, that the weathering process and enrichment of iron 

is accompanied with losses in elements associated with talc and serpentine (MgO, SiO2) but 
enrichment in elements associated in clay minerals (aluminium) and in oxides (manganese).  

Cobalt coincides with manganese in the laterite profile. Scandium follows iron. 

7.6.2 Mineralogy 

In the weathering process the primary minerals of serpentine are altered to iron oxide/hydroxides 
and smectite group silicate clay minerals (Table 7.6.2).  Although this weathering alteration has 
produced a laterite profile, and the primary minerals are most abundant in the weathered 

Serpentinite, silicate clay minerals in the Saprolite and Hematite + Fe-hydroxides in Hematite and 
Limonite samples, all the main nickel-bearing minerals can be found in samples investigated by 

Outotec Oy.

In the Outotec study, x-ray diffraction (XRD) of bulk samples and scanning electron microscope 

(SEM) equipped with wavelength-dispersive spectrometer (WDS) analyser were used.  Nickel 
content of minerals was analysed with WDS giving a good precision in low contents (<0.5% Ni) 
(Table 7.6.3).  For other elements, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was used 

and detection limit and analytical precision is poorer (±1%).

Primary Serpentinite Minerals 

The main minerals of the weathered serpentinite are talc, chlorite and quartz as shown by XRD. 

The SEM analysis found that tremolite, Na-amphibole, plagioclase and chromite are primary 
minerals of the serpentinite.  Primary silicate minerals alter to smectites.  The average nickel 
contents of the primary minerals are low (0.17% Ni for talc, 0.21% Ni for chlorite and 0.12% Ni for 

tremolite). 

Smectites – Mg-Al-Silicate Clay Minerals

Si-Mg clay minerals inferred by XRD in the samples included: saponite (average 2.14% Ni), 
montmorillonite (average 0.33% Ni), stevensite (average 0.3% Ni) (and Fe-smectite with average 

1.22% Ni). Chemical composition of smectites suggests that there are three alteration series: 

 Chlorite -> saponite -> montmorillonite. 

 Tremolite & plagioclase -> (saponite ->) montmorillonite. 

 Talc (&serpentine) ->stevensite -> Fe-smectite. 

All the series are characterised by an increase in silica and iron content and decrease in 

magnesium content.

Hematite and Fe-Hydroxides 

Hematite and Fe-hydroxides were common in all samples. Hematite was found as separate grains. 

Geothite-limonite formed botryoidal grains but most commonly they occurred as a fine-grained 

mixture with Mg-Al-Si clay minerals forming also pisolites. 

Nickel content of hematite ranges from 0.0% Ni to 4.2% Ni (average 0.64% Ni).  For goethite and 
limonite, the range is narrower; 0.08–1.22% Ni and 0.13–1.53% Ni respectively, but the average is 

about the same as for hematite: 0.54% Ni for goethite and 0.71% Ni for limonite. 

Asbolan – Manganese Hydroxide 

Asbolan occurs as fracture filling and is most common in the Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite 
samples.  Nickel and cobalt contents of asbolan are high. Nickel ranges are 7.8% Ni to 12.0% Ni 

(average 10.0% Ni). Cobalt ranges are 0–15% Co (average 12.0% Co). 

Quantitative Estimates 

The main minerals of the samples are chlorite-saponite, i.e. high-aluminium magnesium-silicate, 
montmorillonite and Fe-hydroxide+hematite (Table 7.6.5).  The sum of these minerals is low (about 
85%). 15% of samples consist of other minerals: in the Weathered Serpentinite this is partly 

explained by tremolite, plagioclase, ilmenite and chromite.  In the other samples, this may be due 

to higher hydrous content.

The main nickel carrier in the Weathered Serpentinite, Saprolite and Limonite samples is chlorite-

saponite.  Towards the surface, hematite/Fe-hydroxides, asbolane and montmorillonite become

Scandium content in all the minerals was below the detection limit.  Since scandium follows iron in 

the laterisation profile it is most probably carried by hematite and Fe-hydroxides.  If all scandium is 

carried by hematite/Fe-hydroxides then scandium content in the mineral would be 150–500 ppm.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Deposit Types 

The target mineralisation at the Nico Young Project has many characteristics of nickel laterite 
deposits formed on weathered and partially serpentinised ultramafic rocks.  Features of nickel 

laterites include: 

 The nickel is derived from altered olivine, pyroxene and serpentine that constitute the 

bulk of tectonically emplaced ultramafic oceanic crust and upper mantle rocks. 

 The process of formation starts with hydration, oxidation, and hydrolysis, within the zone 

of oxidation, of the minerals comprising the ultramafic protore.  

 The circulation of meteoric water (the pH being neutral to acid and the Eh being neutral to 

oxidant) are essential to this process.  Silicates are in part dissolved, and the soluble 

substances are carried out of the system. 

 This process results in the concentration of nickel in the regolith in hydrated silicate 
minerals and hydrated iron oxides; nickel and cobalt also concentrate in manganese 
oxides.  The regolith hosting nickel laterite deposits is typically 10 m to 50 m thick, but 

can exceed 100 m.  

 Concentration of the nickel by leaching from the limonite zone and enrichment in the 

underlying saprolite zones is also common.  Leaching of magnesium ± silicon causes 
nickel and iron to become relatively concentrated in the limonite zone. Nickel is released 
by re-crystallisation and dehydration of iron oxy-hydrides and is slowly leached 

downwards through the profile, both vertically and laterally, re-precipitating at the base 
with silicon and magnesium to form an absolute concentration within the saprolite (Figure 

8.1.1). 

 The degree of the nickel concentration and the detailed type of regolith profile developed 
is determined by several factors including climate, geomorphology, drainage, lithology 

composition, and structures in the parent rock, acting over time. 

 A typical laterite profile contains two distinct horizons, (limonite (oxide) and saprolite 

(silicate). 

Exploration criteria is summarised from Brand et al (Ref. 22) as follows: 

 Geological terrains with olivine-rich lithologies and their metamorphic derivatives, large 
enough to host nickel laterite deposits that will support low-cost, high-tonnage, open-cut 

mining operations, must initially be identified. 

 Airborne magnetic surveys, regional mapping and known occurrences of lateritic nickel 

are useful to identify likely targets.

 Later, detailed geological and geophysical surveys may be needed to delineate olivine-
rich lithologies and faulting that may represent sites for shallow, high-grade manganese-

cobalt-nickel and garnierite mineralisation. 

 Regolith landform mapping and reconnaissance drilling can be used to determine the 
nature and distribution of the regolith (i.e. whether in-situ, concealed or stripped) and 

those zones that host nickel enrichments. 

 Regional drilling and possibly soil sampling of in-situ regolith can be used to identify 

nickel halos (>0.5% Ni) and target the most prospective parts of a weathered ultramafic 

sequence. 

 Follow-up drilling to delineate nickel-enriched zones will, in association with geochemistry 
and mineralogy, provide valuable information on the geological and metallurgical

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Summary  

(Ref.27 and Ref.28) 

Since the serpentinite source rocks, which usually occur beneath thick alluvial or soil cover, are 
strongly magnetic, the exploration procedure of JRV was to locate the magnetic anomalies and 
pattern drill them.  The primary information was derived from the Cootamundra 1:250,000 sheet 

which had been flown in November/December 1997 and February/March 1998 for magnetics and 
radiometrics for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation and the Department of Mineral 
Resources as part of the Discovery 2000 program.  The total magnetic intensity map depicted the 

serpentinites and other ultramafics and their trends beneath soil cover. 

Initial field work by JRV was to conduct ground magnetic traverses on public roads in order to 

pinpoint the magnetic anomalies on the ground.  Permissions were then obtained from the Young 

and Cootamundra Shires to drill on the roadsides. 

The ground magnetic surveys taken along road sides are considered historical in nature as they 
occurred prior to any of the current Jervois staff having worked on the project.  No procedures have 
been located from historical records and no details of equipment used. From the data available, 

spacings of readings appears to be approximate 25 metre spacings between measured GPS 

points. 

The technique, whilst effective in locating magneticly responsive rock units is likely to have inherent 

bias due to the presence of power lines and other magnetic interference structures. 

The total area covered is not known. Many of the road sides surveyed are well outside the current 

exploration licences. 

JRV established that the right environment for lateritic nickel existed beneath the soil and alluvium 
cover.  Accordingly, the next step was to explore on private land on a grid basis.  The property 
owners in the areas of interest were approached in order to obtain access and compensation 

agreements for exploration on their freehold lands.  In 1998/1999, agreements were successfully 

concluded with 36 out of 37 of the owners approached. 

Ground magnetic traverses were then conducted along fence lines on the properties with pin 
markers being attached to the fences every 200 m for semi-permanent reference and the location 
of the ends of the lines fixed using a global positioning system (GPS) surveying instrument.  By 

2001, 186 km of magnetic readings had been taken on 129 fence/road line traverses. 

Traverses along road sides only were plotted in chart form in MSExcel.  No plans generated could 

be located from the historical data 

Apart from ground magnetic surveys and drilling programs, the author understands that no other 

systematic geophysical or geochemical surveys have been undertaken for inclusion in this report.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Resource Delineation Drilling Methods 

The methods of drill sampling for resource delineation were by aircore and RC rotary drilling, with 

aircore accounting for 86% of drilled metres (14% for RC drilled metres) to September 2018. 

The first aircore drilling program commenced in late October 1998 soon after the granting of the 
first tenement and the conducting of the roadside ground magnetic surveys.  The drilling program 

showed that a laterite profile existed and that enriched values of nickel and cobalt were present 

within the laterite. 

The dominant aircore drilling uses hardened steel or tungsten blades to drill a hole into 
unconsolidated ground such as weathered regolith. The drill bit has three blades arranged around 
the bit head, which cut the unconsolidated ground. The rods are hollow and contain an inner tube 

which sits inside the hollow outer rod barrel. The drill cuttings are removed by injection of 
compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the innertube and the drill rod. The 
cuttings are then blown back to surface up the inner tube where they pass through the cyclone and 

collected in a plastic bag (Figure 10.1.1).

Figure 10.1.1 Aircore Drilling and Sampling Activities 

 
 

All drillholes are vertical and all drill sites have been remediated in line with Departmental 
requirements, such that no collar locations are preserved with an identifying monument. All holes 

have been backfilled with surplus sample to about 0.3 m below the surface, then capped with an 

octoplug cap, then covered with soil. 

All drill collars were located by a licensed surveyor around the time of drilling or by trained JRV 

personnel using a Trimble PROXRS GPS system to an accuracy of about 0.15 m.  

A typical aircore program used a Schramm 450H rig with a hole diameter of 89 mm, and a Sullair 
compressor capacity of 200–350 psi and 400–600 cfm (e.g. Intertech and Competitive drillers). On 
one occasion, a RC hammer bit was used to pass through hard ground. Sample returns passed 

through an 1,800 cfm cyclone with three-tier splitter into a large clean plastic bag for each metre 
drilled. From 2007, the on-board splitter was not used, and large bags were weighed individually at 
the rig site to gauge sample recovery, using an industry strength scale from 2014. Typically, one 

sample split was submitted for analysis and a duplicate stored securely in JRV's shed in Young.

Samples were geologically logged by sieving material from each of the large bags. Qualitative 
logging of samples included (but was not limited to) lithology, oxidation, colour and weathering. 
JRV logging codes were recorded onto drill logs and were subsequently transferred to a digital 

Microsoft Access database. Additionally, magnetic susceptibility readings were taken using a 

GeoInstruments GMS-2 meter. 

In other aircore drilling campaigns, and confirmed by JRV's Competent Persons, sample returns 
were put through a single-tier riffle splitter with a split submitted for assay. Wet samples were grab 

sampled, put into a cloth bag and left to dry prior to being put through the splitter. 

Aircore drilling was used to obtain 1 m drill chip samples from which a 1–2 kg sample was collected 
for submission to the laboratory for analysis. Occasional 2 m and 5 m composite samples were 

also compiled from which a sample was collected for laboratory submission. 

All aircore samples from 2008 onwards were collected in a cyclone and split using a single-tier riffle 

splitter (50:50 split). Where samples greater than 2 kg were collected in the bottom tray, a scoop 
was used to collect the sample along the length of the tray into a sample bag. Samples smaller 

than or equal to 2 kg were collected in their entirety. Majority of the samples were dry.  

Sample recovery in damp or wet lithologies can be less than ideal due to sample returns sticking to 
the internal wall of the rod string and the pipework leading to the cyclone, as well as sticking to the 

internal wall of the cyclone. Average sample weights for individual aircore programs ranged from 
8 kg to 18 kg, with approximately 20% of weighed returns indicating less than ideal sample 

recovery. 

RC holes in 2018 were drilled by DDH1's Sandvik DE840 Multi-purpose rig using a down-the-hole 
hammer with a 140 mm face sampling bit to penetrate ground and deliver sample up 6 m drill rod 

inner tubes through to the cyclone and cone splitter. The compressor capacity was 500 psi and 
1,350 cfm. Sample weights ranged from 0.1 kg (minimum) to 48.6 kg (maximum) and averaged 

19.2 kg. 

RC sample returns were subsampled by processing through a triple tier riffle splitter at the rig site. 

10.2 Scope of Drilling 

Drilling was completed along a set of northwest-southeast trending sections perpendicular to the 

strike of the mineralisation. At Ardnaree, the drill spacing ranged from 90 m to 650 m along strike 
and averaged 100 m across strike. At Thuddungra, prior to the winter 2018 program, the drilling 
spacing ranged from 200 m to 420 m along strike and averaged 100 m across-strike (Figure 

10.2.1). At Ardnaree, there are two sub-areas of close-spaced drilling: 621200mN–6212500mN 
where drilling is approximately 100 m spaced and 6214400mN–6216750mN where drilling is 100 m 

spaced and closer, including twinned drillholes.

Drilling conditions at Thuddungra are less than ideal due to high-level groundwater, sticky clays 
and ball-bearing/marble sized iron-quartz pisolites. Sampling was conducted on 1 m drilled 

intervals. Despite the presence of high-level groundwater in many holes, majority of samples were 
presented dry to only moist with only a few (1.5%) recorded as wet or saturated. A gated cyclone 
was used to collect the 1 m interval sample which was released to a large green bag labelled with 

the Hole ID and the depth interval. Average sample weights were 18.1 kg (Thuddungra Phase 1), 

19.7 kg (Thuddungra Phase 2) and 19.3 kg (Ardnaree). 

JRV's QAQC Manager reported that 85% of samples were of high to moderate confidence. 

The drilling equipment was however considered adequate for the program and holes were 

generally terminated by the supervising geologist in visible basement rather than being terminated 
early due to inadequate capacity of the drill-rig and compressor. Several of the holes were drilled to 

96 m depth which was the maximum number of rods supplied by the drilling contractor. 

Drill bit wear was monitored throughout the program and it was noted there was little wear on the 

drill bit over the duration of the program. 

During the program, two different cyclones were used as the original smaller cyclone needed repair 
and was substituted by a larger RC-type cyclone (YA543-YA562). The cyclone was cleaned at the 

start of each hole and generally after every two to three rods when damp to moist sticky samples 
were encountered that quickly stuck to the walls of the cyclone. The bull-hose also frequently 
blocked which required its removal, reversal and blowing out using high-pressure air with water 

injection. Each cyclone and bull-hose clean was recorded in the database. The smaller cyclone 
performed better than the larger but required more frequent cleaning. The bull-hose and cyclone 

are recognised as the major contributors to poor recovery and potential contamination. 

All holes were rehabilitated by backfilling the holes with coarse gravel and the top 1 m with topsoil 

sourced from the property. All rubbish was removed from site. 

Preliminary geological logging of the chips was conducted on the drill rig as the hole was drilled by 
the contract geologist. Chip trays of each aircore hole are preserved in the JRV Young warehouse 

and each hole's chip trays have been photographed and integrated into the database.

Preliminary logging is to be re-assessed once assays are available as the reliability of visual 
logging in the field might not be comprehensive, fully accurate or consistent. At the JRV warehouse 
in Young, crates of bulk drilled interval samples were unpacked and laid out in sequence. Bag 

labels were verified and sample weights were rechecked and updated as required. 

Splitting was undertaken using a modified 60-L rotary splitter according to JRV's Standard 

Operating Procedures. Two splits were obtained, and the residue was disposed. A 1–3 kg split was 
collected in a calico bag, numbered with the sample number only, which was sent to ALS Orange 
for analysis. A second 3–5 kg split was collected in a smaller green plastic bag, labelled with the 

Hole ID and depth interval, which was folded over and stapled before stacking in labelled and 
numbered crates for preservation. Sample Number tickets were added to each sample bag (calico 

and green plastic) before they were securely closed. 

A very minor proportion (<0.5%) of samples were too wet to be split using the rotary splitter and 
were sampled by taking multiple random spears and grabs. These samples have been flagged in 

the database and are ranked with a low sample confidence. 

Each sample was allocated a unique sample number which was attached to the Hole ID and depth 

interval in the database which also recorded for each sample number the Sample Batch ID, 
Sample Type, Sample Medium, Sample Timestamp and Sampler, Bulk Sample Weight, Calculated 

Sample Recovery, Assigned Geology and QAQC flags (Skidmore, Ref. 32). 

The Winter 2018 Drilling Program was exclusively infill drilling and there was no step-out drilling 
involved. This drilling anticipated infill drilling on a closer spacing. This drilling  affected a portion of 

the Thuddungra Resource area and was based on a design spacing of 100 m x 100 m which 
did not increase the classification of the Mineral Resource from the currently 

Inferred Resource status. 

The project is a nickel laterite project and the drilling criteria are well established with minimum drill 
spacing criteria for Mineral Resource categorization, of course other geostatistical factors are also 

considered. At a minimum for a Measured Resource, the spacing would be 50 m x 50 m, for an 
Indicated Resource, 50 m x 100 m, and for an Inferred Resource, 100 m x 100 m, and greater. The 
in-fill drilling closed up an area of 200 m x 100 m to 100 m x 100 m, so the Mineral Resource 

classification remains as Inferred. 

The Thuddungra drilling information for aircore was completed well after the completion of the 

Mineral Resource modelling which formed the basis of the PEA study. In addition to 
the aircore drilling, diamond core drilling was conducted and some holes were twinned with 
the aircore holes. The diamond core drilling assays were received in April 2019 however the lab 

QA/QC report has not yet been received. 

The Winter 2018 Drilling Program does not alter the confidence level of the Mineral Resource. It is 

currently classified as Inferred and will remain so if an updated Mineral Resource were to be 
estimated using the additional drilling data. Further additional drilling over and above that which 
has already been carried out would be required to increase the confidence level of any part of the 

resource from the current classification.

It is an accepted recommendation that infill drilling to a pattern of 100 m x 50 m should be 
considered by the Company to achieve, as a minimum, the establishment of a component of 
Indicated" Resources. The Winter 2018 Drilling Program does not satisfy that recommendation and 

therefore further closer spaced drilling is required, and forms the basis of the future geology work 

programme. 

The results of the Winter 2018 Drilling Program are not included in the PEA at this time. The drill 
results from the Winter 2018 Drilling Programme are not expected to materially alter the mineral 
resource estimate upon which the PEA is based.  Neither the size, grade or metallurgy associated 

with Thuddungra will be impacted to a degree of materiality likely to impact the economic outcomes 

associated with the PEA. 

10.5 Core Drillholes for Metallurgical Testwork 

The methods for obtaining mineralised core for metallurgical test work include triple tube recovery 

systems with either diamond (DDH) or PCB (PCBDH) bits. 

Two programs of core drilling were undertaken by JRV during 2018 to obtain material for 

metallurgical testwork and density determination (Table 10.5.1). These cores are intended to 
replace historical programs of metallurgical testwork and density determinations that relied upon 

three DDH cores and five Calwell holes completed at Ardnaree in 2001.

10.5.1 DDH Drilling Details 

DDH1 completed core drilling using a Sandvik DE840 Multipurpose rig in early 2018. Diamond 
drillholes YE004 to YE015 were drilled using a PQ3 core barrel and all holes were vertical. A split 

inner tube was used for the diamond drillholes, with generally acceptable recovery using mud. 
Some core was lost at the top and bottom of core runs due to soft broken ground with recovery 
averaging 84% and ranging from 72% to 96.1%. Core was photographed and logged at JRV's 

facility in Young.  

Cores were split by JRV personnel with a handheld blade or mechanical rotary saw at 1 m intervals 

for holes to YE013 at the JRV shed in Young. Sampling intervals for holes YE014 and YE015 were 
sampled at varying intervals according to lithology. Quarter-core splits were bagged and submitted 

to Australian Laboratory Services in Stafford, Queensland for analysis. 

Once assays were to hand, the cores were reviewed and revised in light of the chemistry, and in 
accordance with JRV logging codes. Drill cores in trays were covered in plastic to preserve 

moisture and secured onto pallets for road haulage to SGS in Malaga, Perth, Western Australia.

Selected specimens were submitted for dry density determinations by SGS Malaga, Perth, Western 

Australia. 

10.5.2 PCBDH Drilling Details 

Underdale drillers completed a 17-hole, 991.5 m core drilling program for the purpose of providing 

material for metallurgical test columns (YE016 to YE032). Core drilling commenced on 4 July 2018 

and operated on a three weeks on/one week off roster, finishing on 29 September 2018. 

Underdale provided Schramm drilling equipment to undertake this program, which was charged on 
a day-rate basis rather than meterage in order to maximise recovery. Drilling was therefore slow 
(averaging ~18 m per day). Recoveries averaged 81% and ranged from 67% to 92% for individual 

holes; however, production and recovery improved over the duration of the program. Some holes 
were abandoned early due to collar collapses and ingress of groundwater towards the top of the 

hole via palaeo-channels. 

A blade pre-collar of 2 m was used due to quarantine restrictions sending the cores to Western 
Australia. Core was PQ3 and used a PCB drill bit. Initially it was proposed to use air in lieu of 

conventional muds, but this was found to be unsatisfactory and muds were used for the program. 

The average hole depth is 63.9 m. 

Once the core was delivered to the warehouse by JRV personnel, the core was thoroughly washed 
and marked up with metre marks and driller's blocks were checked and corrected as required. 
Recovery and core loss were measured along with average magnetic susceptibility readings for 

each run. The holes were geologically logged and photographed wet and dry. 

Sample intervals were marked up and labelled with a sample number on the tray. Sample intervals 

were allocated at generally <1 m, honoured geological boundaries, and included only negligible 
zones of core loss. Calico sample bags with ticket books and Certified QAQC Control Samples, 
which were assigned according to the database QAQC algorithm, were inserted in sequence were 

sent with the secured palleted core to SGS in Perth. 

Secured core was road hauled to SGS (Malaga, Perth) where the core was longitudinally cut in half 

and one half was further quartered. Sampling was designed to honour the sampling allocated by 
the geologist in Young using the supplied sample numbers and to include QAQC controls 

(Skidmore, Ref. 32).  

10.5.3 Density Measurement Procedure 

In May 2018, the core from 15 holes was reviewed at the SGS facility in Malaga, Perth. 

The core was re-logged by the geological contractor in order to identify composites for metallurgical 

testwork. At that time it was recommended to JRV that there was sufficient competent material 
available for dry bulk density determinations. A total of 99 core specimens were collected from 12 
of the 15 core holes and handed to SGS for analysis. Each specimen was numbered, and the hole-

ID and depth was recorded in a sample book.

A further 293 specimens were taken from the Thuddungra PCBDH cores for density 

determinations.

The results were supplied as an excel file (0867BH_JRV_DrillCoreBulkSG_FINAL_200618.pdf).  

A subset extract of the results provided in Microsoft Excel format is shown in Figure 10.5.1.

Wet and dry density (ARD) values were determined by SGS; however, only the dry density results 
were used in the resource estimate. The standard water immersion method for dry density was 

used with the following steps: 

1) Wrap the sample core in "cling wrap" and then "shrink" with a hot air gun (wet). Plastic is used 
as an alternative to wax by SGS so that the samples could be returned to the core trays and 
used for metallurgical testwork. 

2) Weigh the sample in air (Column C) and submerged in water. Subtract the submerged weight 
from Column C and record the result in Column D. The difference in these weights, using 
Archimedes' Principle, is the weight of the water displaced (i.e. the volume of the sample).  

3) The plastic coating was removed, and the sample was subsequently dried at approximately 
105°C, with the weight recorded periodically until a final (constant) dry weight was obtained. 
This dry weight was recorded in Column E. 

4) Wet bulk density was calculated using the formula Column C / (Column D-15) and the result 
recorded in Column F. The -15 is a correction factor; SGS advised  that the factor was applied 
to account for the plastic wrap. 

5) Moisture content (Column H) was calculated using the formula (1-(Column E/Column C) *100 

6) Dry bulk density (Column G) was calculated using the formula Column E / (Column D-15).

10.6 Drilling, Sampling or Recovery Factors That Could Materially Impact 
the Accuracy and Reliability of the Results 

Drilling conditions in restricted zones at the Nico Young Project are less than ideal due to high-level 
groundwater, sticky clays and ball-bearing/marble sized iron-quartz pisolites, with conditions more 

problematic at Thuddungra compared with Ardnaree.  

In order to understand the extent of the issue, the following occurred: 

 JRV's drill logs and recovery/sample weight information were reviewed; 

 JRV's supervisors for historic drilling programs were interviewed; and 

 the Intertech Drilling Services Manager was interviewed. 

The review identified programs of RC drillholes where the type of sample (blade or hammer) and 
sample quality was not described in the logs. A total of 41 RC drillholes were flagged in JRV's 

global database to be excluded from Mineral Resource estimates. 

 Aircore drillholes where there are intervals described as wet, sticky, small sample and 
recorded weights may sometimes be lower than adjacent intervals, indicating problematic 

sampling and low recoveries. Most problematic intervals occur in East Thuddungra at 
depth, where 3% of aircore drillholes encountered problematic sampling conditions, with 
zones ranging from 2 m to 17 m thickness (average 7 m). Ardnaree and West 

Thuddungra drilling conditions appear to be less problematic based on the information 
presented in the JRV drill logs.  The problematic sampling intervals at East Thuddungra 
were accepted and recommended application of an Inferred confidence to any Mineral 

Resource estimate in that area until closer spaced drillholes with improved recoveries 

become available. 

 Small diameter Kennedy aircore assays appeared to be higher grade than Allsearch 
aircore assays in the same area. To further understand whether aircore drill type had 
introduced a bias into sampling,  a statistical analysis of the composites from the close 

spaced drilled area at Ardnaree (between 6214400mN and 6215800mN) was 
undertaken. The analysis, while not conclusive, suggested a sample bias in respect of 
Kennedy aircore samples. A total of 33 small diameter aircore drillholes were flagged in 

JRV's global database to be excluded from Mineral Resource estimates (Ross, Ref. 31). 

There are potentially some historical aircore samples of uncertain quality remaining in the 

database.

11.0 SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Laboratory Details 

Assays for samples used in the Mineral Resource estimates were prepared by ALS.  Sample 
preparation occurred at either ALS Orange (up to 2014) or ALS Geebung and analyses occurred 

either at ALS Orange or at ALS Brisbane, except for four samples containing fibrous mineral that 
were processed in ALS Perth. None of the samples were assayed by JRV employees or 

contractors. 

The performance of ALS laboratory facilities is accredited by the National Association of Testing 

Authorities, Australia (NATA); however, the sample preparation facilities are not. 

The laboratory addresses are: 

 Brisbane: 32 Shand Street, Stafford, Queensland, Australia. 

 Geebung: 116 Delta Street, Geebung, Queensland, Australia. 

 Orange: 10 Leewood Drive, Orange, New South Wales, Australia.

11.1.1 ALS 

The general process used by ALS has been: 

 Split samples were sorted, labelled and weighed.  Received split sample weights are 

reported for only the 2018 RC program and show an average of 2.3 kg. 

 Samples were dried to 105°C. 

 Large samples were coarse crushed using a Boyd crusher if required and split to obtain 

no greater than 3 kg samples. 

 Samples were pulverised to 85% of weight passing 75 micrometres (µm) sieve in a LM5 

ring pulveriser. 

 A 200 g subsample was collected for analysis. 

 Diamond core samples were crushed and followed the above sample preparation 

methodology. 

11.1.2 SGS 

Palleted drill core trays, certified standards and blanks were received by SGS Malaga and 

analytical samples were prepared as follows: 

 Cores were split in accordance with the "cut sheet" instructions provided by JRV's QAQC 
Manager. Soft core was split in half with a 60 cm hand blade and then one quarter was 

bagged using a spatula. More competent core was cut using a conventional mechanised 

saw. 

 Split samples were sorted, labelled with an internal SGS number and weighed. Samples 

were dried for 48 hours at 105°C. 

 Dried samples were crushed to minus 3.35 mm in a jaw crusher. 

 400 g of coarse material was obtained by riffle splitting. 

 This aliquot was pulverised in a Labtechnics ring mill to 45–70 µm. 

 A 50-pulp aliquot was split and submitted to SGS Newburn, together with certified 

standards and pulverised quartz sand blanks. 

 Residues were bagged and returned to open head drums for transport back to JRV 

Young storage.

11.2 Assay Methods to May 2018 

Assays used in the Mineral Resource estimates were reported from the following: 

 Holes drilled to 2005 were assayed for Ni and Co by various assay methods including 
IC3B, IC4, and AAS method A102 (nitric, perchloric, HF acid digestion, HCl leach, flame 

AAS determination).  Limited information exists regarding these methods.  In 2018 JRV 
reclaimed approximately 2,900 pulps from its Young storage and submitted these for 
analysis using ICP methods – ME-MS61 and OG62 for verification and over-limit Ni.  The 

Mineral Resource estimate database now includes only 3% of records based on AAS-

A102. 

 Holes drilled from 2005 were assayed for Ni, Co and other elements by digestion with 
perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids, and then inductively coupled plasma 
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analytical techniques (ME-ICP61, OG62 and 

ME-ICP85). 

 Holes drilled in 2008 were assayed for Ni, Co and other elements using industry standard 

lithium meta/tetra borate fusion and ICP-AES analytical technique (ME-ICP93). 

 Holes drilled from 2014 onwards were assayed for Ni, Co and other elements by 

digestion with perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids, and then ICP-AES 

analytical techniques (ME-ICP61 and OG62). 

Four-acid digestion methods such as ME-ICP61 and ME-MS61 are regarded as "near total" 
digestions.  The ICP instrument reads a liquid sample and only reads what has been dissolved and 
in the solution presented to it.  Whilst these four-acid digestion methods generally dissolve virtually 

all of the sample, there can be some partial precipitation for elements such as Al, Sc, REEs. 
Accuracy of ±10% is likely for most elements (including Ni, Co) and worse for the elements that 
may partially precipitate. ME-ICP93 was a method used by ALS up to 2009 whereby the samples 

were fused in a flux (as used in the x-ray fluorescence (XRF) method) and subsequently dissolving 

the melt in dilute acid giving total dissolution, followed by ICP analysis. 

11.3 Assay Methods – Winter 2018 

11.3.1 Thuddungra and Ardnaree Aircore Drilling 

All AC samples, once split, were delivered by JRV personnel to ALS Laboratories (Orange), in zip-
locked polyweave bags containing 10 calico sample bags.  Each batch comprised 200 samples. 

Details of each batch were recorded into the database which used an industry-strength numbering 

system to identify each unique batch. 

At ALS the samples were weighed, dried and crushed prior to pulverising to -2µm.  The resultant 

pulps were sent internally by ALS to their Brisbane laboratories for analysis using ALS's nickel-
laterite Fusion XRF suite (ME-XRF12n).  The remaining pulps were returned to the JRV Young 

Warehouse.

Details of Analytical Method ME-XRF12n 

A prepared sample (0.66 g) is fused with a 12:22 lithium tetraborate – lithium metaborate flux which 

also includes an oxidizing agent (Lithium Nitrate), and then poured into a platinum mould.  The 
resultant disk is in turn analysed by XRF spectrometry.  The XRF analysis is determined in 
conjunction with a loss-on-ignition at 1,000°C (ME-GRA05 H2)/LOI by TGA Furnace).  The 

resulting data from both determinations are combined to produce a "total".  The analytical suite 

(with detection limits) comprises:  

 Ni (0.005–7.8%), Co (0.001–7%), Al2O3 (0.01–100%), CaO (0.01–40%), Cu (0.001–10%), 
Cr2O3 (0.005–10%), Fe2O3 (0.01–100%), K2O (0.01–6.3%), MgO (0.01–50%), MnO 
(0.005–30%), Na2O (0.01–5.3%), P2O5 (0.005–23%), SiO2 (0.05–100%), TiO2 (0.01–

30%), Zn (0.001–1.6%), LOI, Total (0.01–110%). 

11.3.2 Thuddungra PCB Drilling  

SGS was instructed to use fused disc/XRF analytical techniques to determine Al, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, 

Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, S, Si, Zn and LOI. 

11.4 Quality Control Procedures 

11.4.1 Programs to 2014 

Early drilling prior to 2008 had limited quality control (QC) conducted. These measures included: 

 In 1999, 100 pulps from ALS were submitted to Analabs, Orange, NSW, and were check 
assayed using method AAS-A104/5.  Average Ni results were 6% higher; average Co 

results were 1% lower.  Correlation of pulps was less than ideal with 22% of Ni pairs 

differing by more than 10% and 50% of Co pairs differing by more than 10%. 

 Subsequently in 2018, approximately 2,900 pulps originally assayed in 1998/1999 using 
method AAS-A102 (ALS) were resubmitted for analysis using ALS ICP methods – ME-
MS61 and OG62 for over-limit Ni.  Average Ni results were 2% higher; average Co results 

were 4% lower. Correlation of pulps was less than ideal with 22% of Ni pairs differing by 

more than 10% and 28% of Co pairs differing by more than 10%. 

 In early 2005, 200 pulps from ALS were submitted to Becquerel Laboratories in Ontario, 
Canada for assay using neutron activation method BQ-NAA-1.  Average Ni results were 
1% lower; average Co results were 6% higher.  Correlation of pulps was less than ideal 

with 16% of Ni pairs differing by more than 10% and 27% of Co pairs differing by more 

than 10%,(Ref.24), (Ref.25) 

In 2017, 70 ALS pulps from the 2014 programme were submitted to Bureau Veritas (BV) for 
verification of Ni and Co assay results.  Correlations between the two laboratories were satisfactory 

with results returned within 5% of original assays (Muller, 2017).

11.4.2 Ardnaree Reverse Circulation Program (2018) 

QC measures by JRV included the submission to ALS of standards and blanks with samples, and 

inclusion of field duplicate samples to test sample preparation and analytical processes.  Other 
measures included twinning of historical aircore holes by RC holes and pulp checks via an 

independent laboratory (Muller, Ref. 29). 

In addition, ALS inserted internal standards, blanks and undertook duplicate assays to measure 

QC of the analytical process. 

Blanks 

Blanks were inserted by JRV at the end of each hole, totalling 92 blank samples which were 
submitted blind to ALS in Brisbane.  Three Ni blanks and two Co blanks returned values above the 
3 standard deviation threshold.  Overall, these blanks have performed satisfactorily and indicate 

acceptable laboratory cleaning procedures between samples. 

Certified Standards 

Certified reference material (CRM) standards were sourced from Ore Research and Exploration 
Pty Ltd (OREAS).  A total of seven CRMs were used with one CRM inserted at the end of each 

drillhole by JRV. 

The nickel laterite CRMs were: 

 OREAS-182 (0.706% Ni and 723 ppm Co) is derived from transitional (saprolite-limonite) 

ore. 

 OREAS-184 (1.02% Ni and 899 ppm Co) is derived from transitional (saprolite-limonite) 

ore. 

 OREAS-189 (1.47% Ni and 327 ppm Co) is derived from saprolitic ore. 

 OREAS-190 (1.62% Ni and 874 ppm Co) is derived from transitional (saprolite-limonite) 

ore. 

 OREAS-191 (1.73% Ni and 652 ppm Co) is derived from saprolitic ore. 

 OREAS-198 (668 ppm Ni and 807 ppm Co) is derived from lateritic nickel-cobalt ore. 

 OREAS-199 (995 ppm Ni and 557 ppm Co) is derived from lateritic nickel-cobalt ore. 

Two out of the seven CRMs failed QC, with OREAS190 and OREAS191 standards nearly all 
reporting values below the 3 standard deviation threshold limit for Ni.  These two CRMs were 
analysed using method OG62 which is the ICP method used for Ni values reporting in excess of 

10,000 ppm.  Most of the other five CRMs were analysed using ME-MS61.  It is suggested that the 
assay method is underestimating the true Ni assay value.  As these standards represent very high

Ni assays which are at the upper end of the Ni population, the impact on the Mineral Resource 

estimate is considered to be small. 

Following this comparison, OREAS190 and OREAS191 were submitted to an independent 
laboratory (Intertek) in July for XRF fusion analysis to check their official expected value.  Results 
were consistent with the expected value and confirmed that XRF fusion provides a more accurate 

method of assay analysis.  It is recommended that this assay analysis method be adopted for all 

future drilling. 

The other five CRMs show passes for Ni, and nearly all passes for Co, with the exception of 
OREAS198.  A potential low-grade bias is evident for Co, with all CRM values reporting on the low 

side of the threshold, below the expected value, but still within the 3 standard deviation threshold. 

Field Duplicates 

A total of 126 field duplicates were collected by putting the retention sample return though a triple 
tier riffle splitter with the 12.5% split submitted by JRV for assay analysis. Standards and blanks 

were included with this submission. 

Comparison of original Ni assays with duplicate Ni assays showed a good correlation, with all but 
two results within 25% of each other. Co assay comparisons showed more variation, with 10 

samples (8%) above the 25% threshold; however, this is not considered to be of material concern. 

Twinned Drillholes 

A total of 14 earlier aircore drillholes at the Ardnaree deposit were twinned with RC holes from the 
recent 2018 drilling program for comparison.  Assessment of 279 RC assays against that of aircore 

assays showed a fair comparison, with an average difference of -8% in Ni values, and -9% 

difference for Co values. 

Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots where aircore and RC datasets have been plotted against each other 
suggest both nickel and cobalt show a bias towards RC assays at low grades, and a small bias 
towards aircore assays at high grades.  The low-grade bias represents sample assays close to the 

detection limit, and thus is not material to the Mineral Resource estimates.  The high-grade bias is 
potentially partially explained by the use of the Ni-OG62 assay method for nickel grades in excess 
of 1% in RC holes, which has shown to be slightly underestimating the in-situ nickel grade.  It is not 

fully understood why RC cobalt assays are reporting lower than that of the aircore cobalt assays at 
high concentrations (>0.1% Co); however, the RC drilling technique is likely to have pulverised the 
rock chips given the relative softness of the ground, resulting in a potential loss of fines.  The 

author considers the differences are not a material concern. 

Pulp Checks 

A total of 5% of ALS pulps (148 samples) were submitted to Intertek in Perth in July 2018 for 
verification of Ni% and Co% assay results.  Standards and blanks were included with this 

submission.

Comparison of ALS Ni assays with Intertek Ni assays showed a reasonable correlation, with all but 
10 results within 10% of each other.  Co assay comparisons showed more variation, with 20 
samples above the 10% threshold.  Check assays by Intertek were completed using fused disk 

XRF, whereas the original ALS assays were assayed using acid-digestion ICP, thus highlighting 

the accuracy and precision concerns with ICP (Muller, Ref. 30). 

Internal Laboratory Quality Control 

Internal ALS QC certificates were provided to JRV and show the rates of insertion by ALS were 

7%, 4% and 6% for standards, blanks and duplicates.  QC results did not reveal any 

instrumentation concerns. 

11.4.3 Thuddungra and Ardnaree Aircore Program (2018) 

QC samples were inserted into the sequence of sample numbers as allocated by an in-built 

algorithm in the drilling database which predetermined where QC samples are to be inserted 

according to the following rules: 

 Blank – Start of each laboratory batch and one in 50 sample numbers. 

 Certified Standard – one in 16 sample number. 

 Duplicate Pair – one in 20 sample numbers. 

Blanks 

Blank samples were made up by JRV using 1.5 kg of washed beach sand sourced from a gravel 

supplier in Young and packaged in a secured plastic bag. 

A blank is inserted in sequence at the start of each batch of samples submitted to the laboratory, at 

the start of each new hole and additionally at every subsequent 50th sample number. 

Certified Standards 

JRV used a high and a low-grade lateritic nickel-cobalt CRM sourced from OREAS and Geostats. 

These 60 g standards are pre-packaged in sealed nitrogen-filled foil pouches: 

 OREAS-180 (3,093 ppm Ni and 244 ppm Co) is derived from the Bulong Archean 

nickel/cobalt laterite deposit 35 km east of Kalgoolie, Western Australia. 

 OREAS-191 (1.75% Ni and 665 ppm Co) is derived from saprolitic ore material sourced 
from Anglo American Brazil Ltda's Codemin nickel mine located in the state of Goiás, 

~300 km from the port of Santos in Brazil.  

 GBM315-2 (1.67% Ni and 2,221 ppm Co) is derived from lateritic nickel ore from the 

Eastern Goldfields in Western Australia.

Standards are inserted in sequence at every 16th sample number.  The choice of standards is 

alternated. 

Duplicate Pairs 

To assess sample heterogeneity, duplicate samples were submitted in sequence at every 20th 

sample number.  A second split was used to generate the duplicate sample which is given the next 

sample number in sequence. 

Umpire Laboratory and Alternate Method Analysis 

To ensure QAQC, it is planned that 10% of the returned pulps should be submitted to Intertek 

Laboratory (Perth) as an umpire laboratory for re-analysis by nickel laterite XRF fusion methods. 

QAQC Audit and Management 

As part of its Continuous Improvement Program, JRV developed new Standard Operating 
Procedures in July 2018 and appointed a QAQC Manager, responsible for auditing and managing 

the QAQC of the Thuddungra and Ardnaree aircore program. This included: 

 Monitoring and overseeing all aspects of the sampling process. 

 Responsibility for custodianship of samples up to the delivery and submission to the 

laboratory. 

 Organising auditing of the sample preparation facility at Orange. 

 Validating data-recording and ensuring comprehensive metadata capture. 

 Compiling and validating the laboratory analyses into a FileMaker assay database which 

integrates with the sample records in Master FileMaker drilling database and which 

assigns recovery and lithologies to each individual sample.  

 Assessing and following up the assay QAQC results – analysis of QAQC controls are an 

in-built automated feature in the FileMaker assay database:  

- the assay database automatically graphs the results of standards and those 
falling outside of 2 standard deviations of the expected result for the target 
commodities should be considered a fail. If two standards in a batch fail, the 

laboratory should be requested to reanalyse the entire batch 

- the database will automatically pull-out and match duplicate pairs and analyse 
variation as a percentage. Significant variation implied heterogeneity within the 
samples and additional duplicate splits or preparation may be required to 

remove bias 

- blanks are automatically extracted, and anomalous results will be highlighted. 
Blanks returning any anomalous results indicate contamination at the sample

preparation stage. The laboratory should be investigated and if necessary new 
samples will need to be split from the preserved bulk samples stored at the JRV 

storage shed in Young and resubmitted for analysis. 

Responsible for organising storage of returned pulps and submission to umpire laboratories. 

Assigning a sample confidence ranking to each individual sample based upon recovery, sample 

quality and laboratory performance (Skidmore, Ref. 32). 

11.5 Author's Opinion on Adequacy of Sample Preparation, Security and 
Analytical Procedures 

11.5.1 Sample Preparation 

As described by ALS and SGS, the sample preparation procedures conform to standard industry 

practice and are considered adequate by the author. 

11.5.2 Security 

Little has been left to chance in the security of samples in the field, in transit from the field to JRV's 

storage facility in Young, and in despatch of samples and core from Young to the laboratories. 

Sample splits performed by JRV personnel were supervised by JRV Exploration Management, with 
samples securely bagged and labelled, and either independently transported by road haulage to 

ALS Brisbane or transported by JRV personnel to ALS Orange. 

Sample splits for 2018 RC drilling at Ardnaree were road hauled to ALS Brisbane on secured 

pallets; however, some samples were damaged in transit.  JRV was able to submit new splits from 

the retention samples stored in their secure facility in Young. 

As part of their Continuous Improvement Program, JRV instituted new Standard Operating 
Procedures in the lead up to the winter 2018 aircore Program at Thuddungra and Ardnaree to 
improve security.  All aircore samples, once split, were delivered by JRV personnel to ALS 

Laboratories (Orange) to ensure Chain of Custody. 

Prior to the winter 2018 aircore program Thuddungra and Ardnaree, JRV elected to label the 

sample splits with drillhole number and "from – to" numbers.  Additionally, CRMs and blank 
samples were inserted with dummy hole identifiers and "from – to" numbers as a disguise but only 
at the end of the drillhole.  This does not conform to standard industry practice as it could lead to 

transcription errors in the laboratory and in database processes.  While disguising CRMs and 
blanks is adequate, they should be inserted at varying places in the sample stream and not always 
at the end of a drillhole.  Revealing to the laboratory of drillhole numbers and depth is not 

considered best practice.  As part of their Continuous Improvement Program, JRV instituted new 
Standard Operating Procedures in the lead up to the winter 2018 aircore program at Thuddungra 
and Ardnaree to improve sample numbering by allocation of unique sample numbers, including

Procedures for securing drill core in the field, in the core logging facility and in transit to SGS 

Malaga were adequate. 

11.5.3 Analytical Procedures 

For the majority of samples, JRV has elected to determine Ni, Co and other elemental 

concentrations by ICP methods.  The ICP analytical procedures are acceptable for use in Mineral 
Resource estimates; however, confidence in the estimates is lower than if fused disc/XRF methods 
were used.  The fused disc/XRF method is considered standard industry analytical practice in 

nickel laterites. 

As part of their Continuous Improvement Program, JRV instituted new Standard Operating 

Procedures in the lead up to the winter 2018 aircore program at Thuddungra and Ardnaree to 
address QC issues with the analytical method.  The ICP methods are to be replaced by ME-

XRF12n method (Section 11.3.1).

12.2 Ardnaree Diamond Drill Core 

Pallets of secured core trays for holes YE004 to YEA015 were road hauled from Young to SGS 
Malaga in April 2018 for SGS to undertake column testing.  From 8 to 10 May 2018, with assay 
results to hand, the drill core logging was reviewed with JRV's geological contractor to update the 

preliminary logs and to identify mineralised zones for metallurgical testwork.  Assistance was 

provided for the identification and selection of core specimens for density determination by SGS. 

12.3 Thuddungra PCB Drill Core 

On 4 October 2018, Andrew Ross visited SGS Malaga to observe core cutting, sample preparation 

and density determinations in progress, and noted: 

 Pallets of core in sealed core trays on arrival, adequately secured and labelled with 

supporting documentation and instructions for cutting. 

 Hand splitting in half of soft core using a long blade, followed by scooping a quarter by 

spatula.  Attention to detail was observed, with sampling of each tray taking 2 to 2.5 

hours. 

 Labelling of quarter core sample trays and stacking of drying trolleys. 

 Processing of pre-selected specimens for density determinations, using shrink wrap and 

water displacement methods.

 Bags of pulps ready for submission to SGS Newburn. 

 Storage of sample residues in open head drums for return to JRV Young storage. 

12.4 Geological and Assay Database 

In 2017 and 2018, JRV engaged OMI and Geostats to compile a Microsoft Access relational 
database to store geological and sample information that had previously been recorded in 
individual Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  JRV supplied original ALS assay certificates in pdf and 

csv formatted electronic files, as well as ALS QC certificates to OMI and Geostats.  JRV and 
Geostats supplied copies of the Microsoft Excel drill log files and ALS assay pdf and csv electronic 

files. 

In November 2017, all Excel drill logs were reviewed for aircore and RC drill programs and 
interviewed current and former JRV Competent Persons to better understand drilling and sampling 

conditions.  Certain historical RC and narrow diameter aircore drill programs were identified where 
drilling and sampling conditions or assay methods could not be regarded as adequate, and these 

drillholes were flagged in the database and not used in the Mineral Resource estimates. 

The Microsoft Excel drill log records and original ALS assay certificates were reviewed and 
compared with the records in the OMI/Geostats Microsoft Access database.  No material 

discrepancies were identified.  ALS assay certificates could not be found for approximately 3% of 
records used in the Mineral Resource estimates.  In these instances, the unverified ALS AAS-A102 
Ni and Co assays were copied exactly from the entries contained in the Microsoft Excel drill log 

records.  The distribution and tenor of the ALS AAS-A102 Ni and Co assays were reviewed and 

found to have no material impact on the Mineral Resource estimates. 

12.5 Opinion on Data Adequacy 

The author's opinion is that the data is sufficiently adequate to support Mineral Resource estimates 

reported herein and used for mine planning studies.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Executive Summary 

Based on previous successful heap leach studies conducted by Duyvestyn in 2002/2003 (Ref 1,2,3), 

JRV elected to continue to investigate the heap leach potential of the Nico Young ores.  

Drilling was conducted at the Ardnaree deposit in early 2017.  The drill program consisted of both 
RC and diamond core.  The location of the diamond core was selected to provide spatially 

representative samples of the three major ore types, Limonite, Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite 
with sufficient sample to allow for the necessary laboratory testwork to be undertaken to support this 

study. 

Consultant Mworx (Mr David Readett B Eng Met Eng, FAusIMM, CP(Met)) was contracted to provide 

metallurgical consulting services and establish and manage the metallurgical testwork program. 

The metallurgical test program was established to provide the necessary inputs to allow for the 
development of the Process Design Criteria commensurate with the accuracy and detail of the study. 

Internationally recognised laboratories and testing facilities, SGS Metallurgy in Perth, 
HydroGeoSense Ltd in Tucson and Brisbane Met Laboratory in Brisbane were utilised to undertake 

specific aspects of the testwork programme. 

The testwork included Geometallurgical testing at Brisbane Met Laboratory of 160 samples across 
the Ardnaree resource, to determine total acid soluble Ni and Co contents and acid consumption 

characteristics.  Composites representing the three major ore types, namely Limonite, Saprolite and 
Weathered Serpentinite were established and subjected to detailed physical and chemical 

characterisation, bottle roll testing and column leach testing. 

A summary of the results to date is shown in Table 13.1.1.  These show a high proportion of the Ni 
(79% for Limonite to 91% for Saprolite) and Co (89% for Limonite to 84% for Saprolite) are present 

as acid soluble species in the range of acid consumption of 330 to 660kg/t.  As expected the Limonite 

exhibited lower Ni solubility than the Saprolite/Weathered Serpentinite.

The testwork indicated that there was a low degree of variability across the Ardnaree deposit with a 
soluble Ni standard deviation of < +/-15%, Co of < +/-12 and Acid consumption slightly more variable 

at < +/- 20%.

Similar results are anticipated, and have been forecast, for the Thuddungra deposit as it is 
geologically similar and previous metallurgical testing gave very similar Ni recoveries for the limonite, 

saprolite and weathered serpentinite.  This will be confirmed in future testing. 

The composite samples were each characterized with assay, mineralogy, particle size distribution, 

size by size elemental distribution, work and abrasion indices.

The limonite contains mostly Fe oxides/hydroxides (50%) with about 42% silicates, 4% chromite, 1% 
ilmenite and 2% asbolane.  The saprolite consists of about 79% silicates with 17% Fe 

oxides/hydroxides, 3% chromite, 1% ilmenite and about 0.4% asbolane.  

The serpentinite contains 85% silicates consisting of 21% chlorite, 16% serpentinite, 35% quartz, 

11% amphiboles.  

Co deports 100% to asbolane in all samples. In the limonite composite 56% of the Ni deports to Fe 
oxides/hydroxides with 25% residing in chlorite, 16% in asbolane and minor amounts in Fe/Mg 

amphibole and serpentine.  In the saprolite 57% of the Ni resides in chlorite with 21% in Fe 
oxides/hydroxides, 11% in serpentine, 6% in asbolane and 5% in Fe/Mg amphibole.  In the 
serpentinite 47% of the Ni is in chlorite, 22% in serpentine, 19% in Fe oxides/hydroxides, 7% in 

asbolane and 4% in Fe/Mg amphibole. 

Standard Bond Impact Work Indices and Abrasion Indices were established for each composite. 

Limonite BWi was 1.9 kWh/t with a range of 0.1 to 14.5 and Saprolite was 4.2 kWh/t with a range of 
0.5 to 22.5.  Abrasion indices for the three samples were 0.0063 for limonite, 0.0346 for Saprolite 

and 0.1380 for Weathered Serpentinite. 

The particle size distribution (PSD) and size by size elemental distribution were determined on the -
25mm crushed ore.  The ore appears quite coarse for a laterite with typically +40-50% of the mass 

in the +4mm category.  The Ni and Co distribution is very even in all cases across the sizing 
distribution.  This highlights that the ores are not amenable to any physical sizing upgrade, as has 

been found for other laterites.

Representative sub samples of the three composites (limonite, saprolite and weathered serpentinite) 
were prepared by SGS to -25mm and forwarded to HydroGeoSense (HGS) in Tucson Arizona for 
testing.  An additional sample of the saprolite (a residue from prior testing) was also tested but it had 

been crushed to P100 -12.5mm.  

Preliminary head assays and size by size assays were consistent with those obtained by SGS 

confirming the viability and representivity of the composite sub samples.  Agglomeration optimisation 
tests were conducted to determine both optimal moisture addition and optimal concentrated sulphuric 

acid addition. 

Following agglomeration optimisation Stacking tests and Hydrodynamic Column Tests were 
conducted on each sample.  The results from the hydrodynamic characterization of the three ore 

types and additional finer crush saprolite sample from the Nico Young deposits show that optimal 
agglomeration was found to occur at acid addition rates of 50-100kg/t of acid at a moisture contents 

of 31% for limonite, 25% for Saprolite and 21% for Weathered Serpentinite. 

Agglomeration of the samples produce a product with a total porosity and hydraulic conductivity to 
support percolation leaching of a lift height of up to 10 m (Figures 13.1.1 and 13.1.2).  The initial 

percolation capacity of these samples will easily support a solution irrigation rated of 10 L/h/m2.  It is 
expected that the Saprolite will show the best hydraulic behaviour of these three ore types.  Blending 

the Limonite and the Serpentinite ore with the Saprolite is recommended.

Figure 13.1.4 Bottle Roll Acid Consumption vs Ni Dissolution 

 

It is generally accepted that any form of atmospheric leaching of limonitic style Ni laterites tends to 
exhibit both the rate and extent of Ni dissolution that is lower than that of the saprolitic materials.  The 

original column testing conducted by Duyvestyn (1,2 and 3) as well as the GeoMetallurgical testing 

indicated this was the case.  

The mineralogy indicates that for the limonite almost 60% of the Ni is associated with the Fe 
oxides/hydroxides.  The Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeO.OH/Fe2O3) leaching is slow with relatively low 



NICO YOUNG PROJECT PEA

acid consumption but also exhibits a high rate of dissolution of Fe versus Ni.  The remainder of the 
Ni is associated with chlorite (Mg, Fe)5(Si3Al)O10(OH)8 and Serpentine Mg3Si2O5(OH)4.  These 
minerals are more rapid leaching but higher acid consuming as they generate soluble Mg, Al and Fe 

sulphates as the Ni is released. 

The saprolite with 60% of the Ni associated with the chlorite, exhibits higher rates and extents of Ni 

dissolution, at higher acid consumption due to generation of the soluble Mg, Al and Fe sulphates. 
The ratio of Fe to Ni dissolution is much lower than that of the limonite as the saprolite contains only 
a lower content of Fe oxides/hydroxides (of which only 20% of the Ni is associated).  This is clearly 

seen in the assays with limonite at 25.5% Fe and saprolite only 14.8% Fe.  For the weathered 
serpentinite 50% of the Ni is associated with serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) and 20% with both as the 
chlorite ((Mg, Fe)5(Si3Al)O10(OH)8) and Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeO.OH/Fe2O3).  So as with the 

saprolite the majority of Ni leaches readily with the acid consumed mainly via Mg and the Fe and Al. 
Interestingly for the weathered serpentinite the Ni associated with the Fe oxides/hydroxides does not 

seem to have inhibited the rate or extent of Ni recovery. 

The Bottle Roll data using the finer crush sizes indicated potential to improve rate of Ni dissolution 
but the finer crush size did not affect the extent of Ni dissolution (Figure 13.1.5).  Geotechnical and 

Hydrodynamic testing has indicated that the finer crush size will support heap leaching for the 

Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite.

The -25mm crushed composite samples underwent agglomeration optimisation and Kappes testing 
to ensure the conditions necessary for Column Leaching.  The moisture and acid addition utilised

significantly lags behind the others with only 50-55% Ni dissolution.  The acid consumption 

characteristics in regard to the dissolution of Ni are consistent and specific to each ore type.

A comparison of the 2m and 4m columns is shown below using the Saprolite composite sample as 

an example. 

The combined column and bottle roll results for all of the Saprolite samples are summarised below 

in Figures 13.1.8 to 10.  The results are all consistent showing Ni dissolution in the order of 70 to 
85% and Co 90 to 95%.  Typical leach times are 120 to 150 days.  The Ni and Co dissolution are 
then plotted against the volume of leach solution applied (leach solution application measured as kL 

of solution per t of ore).  This indicates that although the 2 and 4m column exhibit similar leach times 
in terms of days the 4m column utilises less leach solution to achieve the same recovery.  This is as 
expected with the higher heap height achieving greater solution efficiency and efficiency of acid 

consumption.

Figure 13.1.10 displays the relationship of acid consumption to the rate and extent of Ni dissolution. 
This indicates for the tests conducted that the acid consumed (to leach the Ni) is independent of the

Figure 13.1.10 Bottle Roll, 2 and 4m Column Acid Consumption vs Ni Dissolution – 

Saprolite 

 
 
The Limonite and Weathered Serpentinite exhibited similar relationships between 2 and 4m columns, 

with regard to acid consumption and solution application profiles. 

The very high acid consumption of 450-650kg/t is driven by the laterite host minerals namely chlorite 

and serpentine.  As the acid is consumed by the host chlorite, serpentine, Fe oxide/hydroxide, and 
asbolane minerals, dissolution of Fe, Al, Mg and Ca occurs and other minor impurities also report 
into the solution including Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn.  The extent of acid consumption is in decreasing order Fe, 

Al, Mg. 

The extent of dissolution and the resultant concentration in the PLS significantly impact the 

downstream processing.  The neutralisation stage is where the majority (>99.5%) of the Fe and Al 

are removed. 

For the duration of the column leach tests the PLS is assayed on a regular basis and the deportment 
of impurities Fe, Al, Mg and Ca, Cu, Cr, Mn is tracked. Based on analysis and interpretation of the 
full suite of column tests, Table 13.1.5 summarises the expected dissolution on major impurities 

which is driven by the acidic dissolution of the dominant Ni bearing minerals (chlorite, serpentine, Fe 

oxide/hydroxide).

The PLS Acid and Fe/Al Neutralisation and Downstream testwork was undertaken by Brisbane Met 

Labs in Brisbane (Ref 6).  A composite blend of PLS generated from Columns #1 to #8, conducted 
at SGS, representing what was considered to be a typical average PLS. An analysis of the PLS is 

provided in Table 13.1.6

A two stage Acid and Fe/Al Neutralisation circuit was tested, as Mworx previous experience had 

indicated this as the preferred method to minimise potential Ni and Co losses.  The tests were set up 
as single stage CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor), with PLS feed to achieve a reactor residence 
time of 3hrs.  Two tests were performed, with the initial tests used to confirm the testwork protocol 

and system as well as providing guidance for the target optimal operating conditions.  The conditions 

for the second tests are summarised in Table 13.1.7.

At this stage no testing of the downstream process route inclusive of direct solvent extraction and Ni 
sulphate crystallization has been undertaken.  Mworx experience and public domain information 

however indicate that the neutralised PLS would be amenable to direct solvent extraction. 

It has long been recognised (Ref 7,8,9,10,11 and 12) that it is necessary to scale-up the Ni and Co 
dissolution results from column testwork to reflect the non-ideal production conditions that exist in a 

commercial production scale heap leach operation.  Column leach testwork is conducted on small 

samples of ore under ideal conditions in a laboratory environment. 

Historically for Cu oxides and sulphides, scale-up has also been applied to the acid consumption.  
However, based on prior experience, Mworx has established that this acid consumption scale-up 
was not necessary for Ni laterite heap leaching.  The leaching chemistry and the relationship between 

acidic destruction of the laterite to release the Ni (and Co) do not change with scale and the scaled 
solution application established for the metal recovery allows for the inefficiencies of acid delivery to 

the ore in a commercial heap.

For the scale-up of the column test results to the required Pre-Feasibility Study Process Design 
Criteria (PDC) inputs (which are required for a commercial production heap leach operation), Mworx 
has previously used the method described in the following section of this report.  This method has 

also been utilised by internationally recognised metallurgical consultants Miller Metallurgical Services 

Ref 12). 

The process of scaling-up involves the following 4 steps: 

 Step 1 – Adjust the Ni and Co dissolution obtained from the column tests.  

 Step 2 – Scale Up the volume of leach solution required. 

 Step 3– Leach time adjustment. 

 Step 4– Acid consumption adjustment. 

This process was undertaken on the data from the 4m columns as the original basis of design was 
4m heaps. The resultant scaled-up commercial heap leach Ni and Co dissolution curves are shown 

below in Figure 13.1.11. 

Based on the detailed analysis and interpretation presented above, Table 13.1.8 has been derived 

as inputs for the Nico Young Heap Leach PDC assuming a 4m Heaps.

The metallurgical testwork program indicated that for a 2-stage neutralisation, Ni and Co losses to 
the residue were in the order of 0.5 to 1%. With the inclusion of seed recycle in both stages and 
inclusion of a re-leach stage for the secondary neutralisation solids it is anticipated losses will be 

minimised to 1.0%.  

Subsequent testing of a two stage MHP indicated Ni and Co recovery in excess of 99%.  The process 

design considers the recycle of the second stage MHP which will allow the second stage to be 
operated to maximise Ni and Co extraction and hence minimise loss. It is anticipated that losses will 

be kept to 1.0%.  

Previous Mworx experience with a similar downstream direct solvent extraction recovery process 

through to Ni sulphate indicated Ni and Co recoveries of 97%  

Combining the calculated heap leach scaled up values and the downstream losses provides 

guidance for the overall process design criteria.  These numbers are provided below in Table 13.1.9. 

As the metallurgical testwork was conducted in parallel to the process modelling and design it was 
necessary to provide preliminary Design Criteria inputs based on the preliminary data available,

before completion of any tests.  The values utilised for the PDC are also provided in the table.  The 
Revised PDC utilises the metallurgical testwork data and has been adopted as the basis for design 

for this study. 

The Bottle Roll data using the finer crush sizes indicates potential to improve the rate of Ni recovery 
but not the ultimate extent of Ni recovery.  The acid consumption characteristics appear unchanged. 

Geotechnical and Hydrodynamic testing has indicated that the finer crush size will support heap 
leaching for the Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite. At this stage the results from the finer crush 

size have not been incorporated into the revised PDC.

13.2 Metallurgical Testwork and Process Development 

13.2.1 Metallurgical Samples 

JRV undertook targeted metallurgical drilling at both its Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits during 

resource drilling campaigns during 2108.  

The metallurgical drilling consisted of diamond PQ core with the drill locations based on the current 

geological understanding of the orebody.  The holes were selected to provide representative samples 
of limonite, saprolite and weathered serpentinite ore types across the orebodies with hole spacing 

established to provide information on the spatial variability. 

15 holes were drilled at Ardnaree as shown below in Figures 13.2.1 and 13.2.2 and based on the 
lithological logging and chemical assays the metallurgical samples were composited into three 

samples representing limonite, saprolite and weathered serpentinite.  The samples used for each 
composite are shown in Table 13.2.1 and the calculated composite assays are provided in Table 

13.2.2.

13.2.2 Metallurgical Testwork Programme 

The PEA metallurgical testwork program was initially established based on the Ardnaree 2018 drilling 
program and was designed to provide the minimum necessary inputs required for the Nico Young 

PEA Study.  The program is described visually in Figure 13.2.3. 

An additional program was established for the Thuddungra samples and this was based on the 
program already established for Ardnaree.  This is not included in this particular study.

13.2.3 GeoMetallurgical Testwork 

From both the Ardnaree 2018 RC resource drilling and diamond core drilling representative 200gm 

sub samples were taken.  These were sent to Nagrom Brisbane Laboratories (Ref 4).  The list of 

samples selected is provided below in Table 13.2.3. 

Table 13.2.3 GeoMetallurgical Samples 

 

Mworx and Nagrom had adapted a CSIRO rapid geo-metallurgical testing protocol to allow for the 
determination of the maximum acid soluble Ni and Co from the laterite ore, as well as maximum acid 
consumption. Details of the test protocol are provided in the Nagrom Geo-metallurgical report (Ref 

4). For the protocol a 20gm ground (-100um) laterite sample was subjected to a 500g/l sulphuric acid 
agitated leach at 70-80 0C agitated leach for 48hrs.  Sampling was conducted at 4, 8 24 and 48hrs 
to establish extent of Ni and Co dissolution and acid consumption.  The initial test protocol had to be 

adjusted to ensure maximum Co extraction was achieved. 

A summary of the results to date is shown in Table 13.2.4.  These show a high proportion of the Ni 

(79% for Limonite to 91% for Saprolite) and Co (89% for Limonite to 84% for Saprolite) are present 
as acid soluble species in the range of acid consumption of 330 to 660kg/t.  It is typical to expect that 
80-90% of the acid soluble Ni and Co is recoverable using heap leaching, with the added proviso 

that for low grade materials of <1% sometimes the effect of a fixed residual tail value can reduce the 

effective expected recovery in percentage terms.

Based on these tests it would be anticipated that heap leach recoveries for the saprolite of 80 to 73% 

for Ni and 70 to 77% Co.  For Limonite the anticipated recoveries would be 63 to 71% for Ni. 

The testwork indicated that there was a low degree of variability across the Ardnaree deposit with a 
soluble Ni standard deviation of < +/-15%, Co of < +/-12 and Acid consumption slightly more variable 

at < +/- 20%. 

Similar results are anticipated, and have been forecast, for the Thuddungra deposit as it is 
geologically similar and previous metallurgical testing gave very similar Ni recoveries for the limonite, 

saprolite and weathered serpentinite. This will be confirmed in future testing. 

13.2.4 Composite Characterisation and Analysis 

QEMScan Mineralogy 

The limonite contains mostly Fe oxides/hydroxides (50%) with about 42% silicates, 4% chromite, 1% 
ilmenite and 2% asbolane.  The proportions of these minerals in the fractions is approximately similar, 
with the finest fraction having the least asbolane.  The silicates comprise quartz (9%), chlorite (14%), 

clays (11%), and about 2% serpentine and 5% talc.  The finest fraction contains a greater amount of 

chlorite relative to quartz than the other fractions. 

The saprolite consists of about 79% silicates with 17% Fe oxides/hydroxides, 3% chromite, 1% 
ilmenite and about 0.4% asbolane.  The silicates mostly comprise chlorite (30%) with 18% quartz, 
9% serpentine, 5% talc, 7% Ca amphibole and 5% Fe/Mg amphibole.  Clays are present in minor 

concentrations (3%). 

The serpentinite contains 85% silicates consisting of 21% chlorite, 16% serpentinite, 35% quartz, 

11% amphiboles.  Fe oxides/hydroxides make up 10% of the sample and there is about 0.3% 

asbolane., 3% chromite and 0.6% ilmenite. 

Co deports 100% to asbolane in all samples. 

The Ni deportment for the composites is summarised in Figure 13.2.4.  In the limonite composite 

56% of the Ni deports to Fe oxides/hydroxides with 25% residing in chlorite, 16%in asbolane and 
minor amounts in Fe/Mg amphibole and serpentine.  In the saprolite 57% of the Ni resides in chlorite 
with 21% in Fe oxides/hydroxides, 11% in serpentine, 6% in asbolane and 5% in Fe/Mg amphibole. 

In the serpentinite 47% of the Ni is in chlorite, 22% in serpentine, 19% in Fe oxides/hydroxides, 7% 

in asbolane and 4% in Fe/Mg amphibole.

Figure 13.2.4 Ni Deportment with Mineral Species 

 

Most of the Fe in the limonite resides in Fe oxides/hydroxides (89%) with minor amounts occurring 
in chromite, ilmenite and silicates.  In the saprolite the amount of Fe residing in Fe oxides/hydroxides 
is about 65%, with 6% in chromite and most of the remainder in silicates. In the serpentinite 58% of 

the Fe is in Fe oxides/hydroxides, with 12% in chromite and the remainder in silicates. 

In the limonite about 29% of the Si resides in Fe oxides/hydroxides.  The remainder occurs in 

silicates. In the saprolite 37% of the Si is in quartz with about 27% in chlorite.  In the serpentinite 

58% of the Si is in quartz with the remainder in other silicates. 

The bulk of the Al in the limonite resides in either clays (42%) or in chlorite (31%) with 14% occurring 
in Fe oxides/hydroxides.  Most of the Al in the saprolite and serpentinite resides in chlorite (69% and 

68% respectively). 

Most of the Mg in all samples resides in either chlorite or serpentine. 

The bulk of the Mn resides in asbolane, in all samples, with minor amounts occurring in chlorite.

Bond Impact Work and Abrasion Indices  

Standard Bond Impact Work Indices and Abrasion Indices were established for each composite.  

Limonite 1.9 kWh/t with a range of 0.1 to 14.5 

Saprolite 4.2 kWh/t with a range of 0.5 to 22.5. 

Abrasion indices for the three samples were 0.0063 for limonite, 0.0346 for Saprolite and 0.1380 for 

Weathered Serpentinite. 

Particle Size Distribution and Elemental Distribution 

The particle size distribution (PSD) and size by size elemental distribution were determined once the 
ore had been crushed to -25mm.  The results are summarised below for each composite in Figures 

13.2.5 – 13.2.10.  The ore appears quite coarse for a laterite with typically +40-50% of the mass in 
the +4mm category.  The Ni and Co distribution is very even in all cases across the sizing distribution. 
This highlights that the ores are not amenable to any physical sizing upgrade, as has been found for 

other laterites.

A number of samples were taken to establish the head grade of the composite with comparative 
assay techniques.  The range of results are shown below in Table 13.2.5.  The two separate 4 Acid 
digest ICP analyses showed the most reliable determination of Ni and Co.  A comparison of the head 

grade determinations is provided in Table 13.2.6 and this shows very good correlation between the 

head assay of the composites with the recalculated head assay based on the size by size analysis.

13.2.5 Agglomeration Optimisation, Geotechnical and Hydrodynamic Testwork 

Representative sub samples of the three composites (limonite, saprolite and weathered serpentinite) 
were prepared by SGS and forwarded to HydroGeoSense (HGS) in Tucson Arizona for testing.  All 

relevant sample data was also forwarded at the same time. 

Preliminary head assays and size by size assays were consistent with those obtained by SGS 

confirming the viability and representivity of the composite sub samples. 

Agglomeration optimisation tests were conducted to determine both optimal moisture (added as 
synthetic raffinate with 75 g/L sulphuric acid, 2 g/L of Fe+2 from ferrous sulphate) addition and optimal 

concentrated sulphuric acid addition.  The visual results of the agglomeration are shown below in 

Figure 13.2.11.

The moisture content of agglomeration is a function of the content of fines.  The higher the fines 
content; the larger the moisture content required to achieve a given agglomeration quality.  As 
indicated in Figure 13.2.11, the Limonite ore requires the most moisture (most fines) and Weathered 

Serpentinite requires the least moisture (least fines). 

For the Limonitic ore the moisture of agglomeration ranges from 29.8% to 43.1% (a delta of 13.3%) 

for an incipient to an optimal agglomeration while the corresponding range of moisture content for

the other two samples is more limited (23% to 29% for the Saprolite and 17.0% to 19.5% for the 

Serpentinite). 

These results indicate that strong-acid agglomeration of the Nico Young ore can be effectively 
accomplished by controlling the amount of moisture added and the residence time of the ore in the 

agglomerating drum. 

The Stacking Test allows for the determination of the Porosity, Bulk Density, and Hydraulic 
Conductivity of a sample as a function of the heap height.   Per the test matrix, two stacking tests 

were performed on Limonite, Saprolite, and Serpentinite at agglomeration levels of L2 and L3 
agglomeration. One repeat test was conducted on Saprolite-L2 as a confirmatory test.  The acid 
addition was 125 kg/t for the Limonite and Saprolite and 100 kg/t for the Serpentinite.   All of these 

samples were cured for 168 hours.  

The results for each test are discussed below: 

 Table 13.2.7 and Figure 13.2.12 show the total porosity and partitioning of porosity into its 
macro and micro components.  It is noted that these porosity values correspond to the 10-

m heap height. 

 Experience shows that a minimum of 30% total porosity is essential to support percolation 

and drain properly.  A 50:50 partitioning between macro and micro components result in 

optimal hydrodynamic performance as well as improved metallurgical response. 

 While all these samples satisfy the standard for the minimal total porosity, their porosity 

partitioning is heavily dominated by micro-porosity;  

- the Limonite has the largest micro-porosity (72.3% and 76.1%)  

- the Serpentinite samples show slightly lower micro-porosity (67.8% to 69.2%) 

- the Saprolite samples have a micro-porosity between 62.3% and 65% 

- typically, the largest the value of the high micro porosity the larger the likelihood 
that the sample will show high solution retention capacity and low percolation 
capacity.   These conditions, in turn, lead to ponding and drainage problems.  

Over time, chemical decrepitation of porous structure could make these issues 

more prevalent. 

 The porosity partitioning seems correlated to the level of fines.  Limonite with 26.9% fines 
has the highest micro porosity while Saprolite (18.3% fines) and Serpentinite (17.4% fines) 

have lower and more similar micro-porosity values. 

 Additional testing is being conducted on a 5-m heap height to confirm that this will show an 

improved porosity partitioning (closer to 50:50).

Figure 13.2.13 shows that the bulk density for all samples is quite low even for a 10-m heap.  This 
indicates a very porous structure which is in line with the high total porosity values presented in Table 
13.2.7.  Due to the high content of fines, relatively resilient ball-like agglomerates form, resulting in a 

good initial percolation.  Limonite has the lowest bulk density followed by Saprolite and then 

Serpentinite: 

 Increasing agglomeration quality from L2 to L3 for Limonite decreases slightly the bulk 
density for lift heights of up to 7 m. Above 7 m, the bulk density of the L3-agglomerates 

becomes equal to that of the L2. 

 Increasing agglomeration from L2 to L3 for the Saprolite samples has a minimal effect on 

their bulk density profiles. 

 L3 agglomeration for Serpentinite lowers bulk density slightly for heap heights smaller than 

5 m. 

Figure 13.2.13 Bulk Density Profiles 

 

The conductivity profiles in Figure 13.2.14 show that all the samples meet the minimum conductivity 
requirement for the flow rate of 10 L/h/m2.   Increasing agglomeration from L2 to L3 increases 

conductivity for all samples.  The largest increase is seen in the Limonite samples, Saprolite has a 

very slight increase, and Serpentinite sees a benefit for heap heights up to 8 m.

The results from the hydrodynamic characterization of the three ore types from the Nico Young 

deposits show that: 

 Agglomeration of the samples to a quality of L2 or better produce samples with a total 

porosity and hydraulic conductivity to support percolation leaching of a lift height of up to 

10 m. 

 The initial percolation capacity of these samples will easily support a solution irrigation rated 

of 10 L/h/m2. 

 However, the micro-porosity all of these samples is larger than 60% of the total porosity 
which typically promotes high liquid saturation during percolation and slow drainage. The 
worst condition is observed for the Limonite samples which have a micro-porosity in excess 

of 70%. 

 It is expected that the Saprolite will show the best hydraulic behaviour of these three ore 

types. 

 Several options to improve the hydrodynamic, and hence the hydrometallurgical behaviour, 

of these samples are as follows; 

- increased crush size 

- improved levels of agglomeration 

- blending the Limonite and the Serpentinite ore with the Saprolite. 

Two additional sample of ore were tested to determine the effect of both finer crush size and to 

establish the likely characteristics of the leached ore.  The retained residue sample from the saprolite

ore sample originally tested by HGS and subjected to stacking tests was dried and re-screened. 
Following agglomeration and partially leaching with 1m3/t of leach solution applied, as expected there 
are signs of decrepitation of the ore as shown in the variation in particle size distribution (Figures 

13.2.15 and Table 13.2.8).

10mm as shown below in Table 13.2.9.

The crushed ore sample (Sap Res) was then subjected to optimal L2/L3 agglomeration conditions 
using synthetic leach solution (Sap Res L2) and synthetic leach solution and sulphuric acid at 100kg/t 
(Sap Res CA-L2).  The agglomerated samples were then subjected to the standard Stacking Test 

with the results provided below (Figure 13.2.16 and 13.2.17) comparing to the original ore samples 
tested (at crush size -25mm).  It can be seen that the acid agglomerated p80mm -10mm saprolite

The interim results for bottle roll tests #1 to #3, based solely on head solids assay and solution assays 
indicated lower than anticipated recoveries.  On this basis, additional tests were conducted to 
establish potential improvements by finer crushing (bottle roll test #4 -#6). Tests #1-#3 were 

conducted at a crush size of P80 25mm whereas test #4and #6 were crushed to -10mm and test #5 

was crushed to -2mm.  

Final residue assays for bottle rolls #1 to #3, indicated an issue with the solution assays significantly 
understating Ni dissolution.  An investigation indicated that there had been a matrix impact on the 
absolute value of Ni determined by multiple element solution ICP.  It appears very high total dissolved 

solids and very high Fe to Ni ratio resulted in assays conducted at only a 10:1 dilution (typically used 
for bottle roll and column test programs) was insufficient to overcome the matrix effect.  A minimum 
1:100 dilution was found to be necessary to achieve reasonable accuracy of the Ni assay and gave 

mass balance reconciliation of +90%.  This solution assay issue was also encountered in the column 

leaching. 

The results for test #1 limonite, test #2 saprolite and test #3 weathered serpentinite are summarised 
below in Figures 13.2.18 and 13.2.19.  These results highlight the differing performance of the 

material types. 

It is generally accepted that any form of atmospheric leaching of limonitic style Ni laterites tends to 
exhibit both the rate and extent of Ni dissolution is lower than that of the saprolitic materials.  The 

original column testing conducted by Duyvestyn (1,2 and 3) as well as the GeoMetallurgical testing 

indicated this was the case also.  

The mineralogy indicates that for the limonite almost 60% of the Ni is associated with the Fe 
oxides/hydroxides.  The Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeO.OH/Fe2O3) leaching is slow with relatively low 
acid consumption but also exhibits a high rate of dissolution of Fe versus Ni.  The remainder of the 

Ni is associated with chlorite (Mg, Fe)5(Si3Al)O10(OH)8 and Serpentine Mg3Si2O5(OH)4.  These 
minerals are more rapid leaching but higher acid consuming as they generate soluble Mg, Al and Fe 

sulphates as the Ni is released. 

The saprolite with 60% of the Ni associated with the chlorite, exhibits higher rates and extents of Ni 
dissolution, at higher acid consumption due to generation of the soluble Mg, Al and Fe sulphates. 

The ratio of Fe to Ni dissolution is much lower than that of the limonite as the saprolite contains only 
a lower content of Fe oxides/hydroxides (of which only 20% of the Ni is associated).  This is clearly 
seen in the assays with limonite at 25.5% Fe and saprolite only 14.8% Fe.  For the weathered 

serpentinite 50% of the Ni is associated with serpentine (Mg3Si2O5(OH)4) and 20% with both as the 
chlorite ((Mg, Fe)5(Si3Al)O10(OH)8) and Fe oxides/hydroxides (FeO.OH/Fe2O3). So as with the 
saprolite the majority of Ni leaches readily with the acid consumed mainly via Mg and the Fe and Al. 

Interestingly for the weathered serpentinite the Ni associated with the Fe oxides/hydroxides does not 

seem to have inhibited the rate or extent of Ni recovery. 

The Co dissolution for the three material types was similar with 90% dissolution within 20 days when 
sufficient reductant is added to the leaching system.  This is consistent with the majority of Co being 
associated with asbolane ((Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) (OH)2(MnO2)2.H2O) and as expected the Co dissolution 

is coincident with the leaching of Mn.

The limonite achieved 62.5% Ni dissolution at 462 kg/t acid consumption.  The saprolite and 
weathered serpentinite show much higher Ni dissolution trends at similar acid consumptions. 
Ultimately the saprolite achieved 87% Ni dissolution at 608kg/t and weathered serpentinite 97.7% Ni 

dissolution at 530kg/t. At 450kg/t they achieved 69% and 92% Ni dissolution respectively.

The impact of finer crush size is shown in Figure 13.2.20 and 13.2.21.  This indicates that there is 
some merit in investigating crush size further with -10mm crush achieving an increased rate of Ni

dissolution but ultimately no improvement in terminal extent of dissolution.  The acid consumption 
characteristics appear very similar with the rate of Ni dissolution for the saprolite and weathered 

serpentinite.

The -25mm crushed composite samples underwent agglomeration optimisation and Kappes testing 

to ensure the conditions necessary for Column Leaching.  The moisture and acid addition utilised 
are shown below in Table 13.2.13 which also summarises the general column operating conditions 

and the key results.

Figure 13.2.24 2m Column Leach Acid Consumption vs Ni Dissolution 

 

Figures 13.2.22 and 13.2.23 show there is a distinct difference in both the rate and extent of Ni 
leaching between the Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite samples and that of the Limonite 

sample.  This distinct difference has been reported by others.  Duyvestyn's original column leaching 
tests (1,2,3) also showed a variation in performance between limonite and saprolite samples tested. 

These results are also consistent with the GeoMetallurgical testing and bottle rolls. 

Figure 13.2.24 shows there is a distinct acid consumption characteristic for each ore type with the Ni 
dissolution and highlighting the dependence of Ni dissolution on the acid consumed.  These results 

are all consistent with the bottle roll tests. 

Figures 13.2.25 and 13.2.26 indicate there is no measurable difference in the rate and extent of Co 

extraction with +90% recoveries to date.  This is consistent with the bottle roll data.

The full column test results for the limonite, saprolite and weathered serpentinite are provided below. 
Differing heap heights (2 to 4m) and acid regimes were utilised to determine the most effective 
leaching regime.  No testing was done on the finer crush size of -10mm.  However, the correlation 

between column testing and bottle rolls was reasonable and it is possible to predict an improved 

performance from the ores with a finer crush in terms of rate and extent of Ni dissolution. 

The combined column and bottle roll results for all of the Limonite samples are summarised below in 
Figures 13.2.27 to 29. The results are all consistent showing Ni dissolution in the order of 45 to 60%

and Co 90 to 95%.  Typical leach times are 100 to 140 days.  The Ni and Co dissolution are then 
plotted against the volume of leach solution applied (leach solution application measured as kL of 
solution per t of ore).  This indicates that although the 2 and 4m column exhibit similar leach times in 

terms of days the 4m column utilises less leach solution to achieve the same recovery.  This is as 
expected with the higher heap height achieving greater solution efficiency and efficiency of acid 

consumption. 

Figure 13.2.29 displays the relationship of acid consumption to the rate and extent of Ni dissolution. 
This indicates for the tests conducted that the acid consumed (to leach the Ni) is independent of the 

rate or concentration of acid supplied.  This will make it difficult to reduce acid consumption through 
management of acid additional rate.  Typically for oxide Cu ores the manipulation of acid 
concentration and rate of acid addition can be optimised and minimised to achieve a certain target 

Cu recovery.  This does not appear to be the case for this Ni laterite ore type.  

For a target acid consumption of 450kg/t the Ni dissolution achieved is 50%, 500kg/t achieves 55% 

and 550kg/t achieves 60%.  

Results for the 4m Column (#1) show the need to maintain a high acid feed to maximise the rate of 

Ni extraction.  The inflection in the Ni dissolution curve at 4kL/t occurred as the acid concentration in 
leach solution was reduced from 100g/L to 50g/L.  At ~6kL/t the acidity was increased back to 100g/L 

and it can be seen the rate of extraction increased to approximately that of rate prior to changes. 

The results for the low acid 2m column (#3) indicate that the column/heap leach ambient temperature 
can affect the rate of leaching.  The column test program was conducted in Perth during a cold winter 

where average ambient temperatures were <20C and <10C daytime and night time respectively. 
Column #3 had external heating applied to control temperature at 35-40C.  When the heating was 
applied at day 70 there was a positive inflection in the Ni dissolution rate.  At the same time there 

was a very distinct apparent increase in rate of leaching of Mg and Al.  Both Al and Mg sulphates are 
known to exhibit increased solubility within this temperature range.  It is thought that as the leach 
solution contains such a high background total dissolved solids/sulphate load at ~200g/L this impacts 

the individual solubility limits of key elements such as Mg and Al.

The combined column and bottle roll results for all of the Saprolite samples are summarised below 

in Figures 13.2.30 to 32.  The results are all consistent showing Ni dissolution in the order of 70 to 
85% and Co 90 to 95%.  Typical leach times are 120 to 150 days.  The Ni and Co dissolution are 
then plotted against the volume of leach solution applied (leach solution application measured as kL 

of solution per t of ore).  This indicates that although the 2 and 4m column exhibit similar leach times 
in terms of days the 4m column utilises less leach solution to achieve the same recovery.  This is as 
expected with the higher heap height achieving greater solution efficiency and efficiency of acid 

consumption. 

The rate of Ni dissolution for the saprolite composite was influenced very similarly by both increased 

leach solution acid concentration and increased leach temperature as the limonite sample.  With both 

variables increasing the Ni dissolution rate. 

Figure 13.2.32 displays the relationship of acid consumption to the rate and extent of Ni dissolution. 
This indicates for the tests conducted that the acid consumed (to leach the Ni) is independent of the 

rate or concentration of acid supplied.

Figure 13.2.35 Bottle Roll, 2 and 4m Column Acid Consumption vs N Dissolution – 

Weathered Serpentinite 

 
 
The Ni dissolution is strongly influenced by the acid consumption and this can be seen from the 
strong relationship shown in Figures 13.2.29, 13.2.32 and 13.2.35 for the three composites.  The 
acid consumption relationship for the bottle rolls and that derived from the geometallurgical testing 

are also include for comparison.  The geometallurgical test represent an ideal system with finely 
ground (-0.2mm) ore in an excess of acid at elevated temperature.  So the slightly lower recoveries 

achieved with bottle roll and columns using ore crushed to p100 of -25mm are expected. 

Similar results are anticipated, and have been forecast, for the Thuddungra deposit as it is 
geologically similar and previous metallurgical testing gave very similar Ni recoveries for the limonite, 

saprolite and weathered serpentinite.  This will be confirmed in future testing. 

13.2.8 Dissolution of Other Impurity Elements from Column Testing 

The very high acid consumption of 450-650kg/t is driven by the laterite host minerals, as discussed 
previously.  As the acid is consumed by the host Fe oxide/hydroxide, chlorite, serpentine and 

asbolane minerals, dissolution of Fe, Al, Mg and Ca occurs and other minor impurities also report 
into the solution including Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn.  The extent of acid consumption is in decreasing order Fe, 

Al, Mg. 

The extent of dissolution and the resultant concentration in the PLS significantly impact the 
downstream processing.  The neutralisation stage is where the majority (>99.5%) of the Fe and Al 

are removed.

of impurities Fe, Al, Mg and Ca, Cu, Cr, Mn is tracked.  A typical result from the Saprolite column test

13.2.9 PLS Acid and Fe/Al Neutralisation and Downstream Testwork 

The PLS Acid and Fe/Al Neutralisation and Downstream testwork was undertaken by Brisbane Met 
Labs in Brisbane (Ref 13).  A composite blend of PLS generated from Columns #1 to #8, conducted 

at SGS, representing what was considered to be a typical average PLS was used as the feed.  An 

analysis of the PLS is provided in Table 13.2.15.

A two stage Acid and Fe/Al Neutralisation circuit was tested, as Mworx previous experience had 

indicated this as the preferred method to minimise potential Ni and Co losses. 

The test was set up as single stage CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor), with PLS feed to achieve 
a reactor residence time of 3hrs.  An auto pH controller was used to maintain the desired pH by the 
addition of a pre-prepared limestone slurry.  Brisbane Met Laboratory describe this procedure as 

being 'batch continuous".  Each test was operated for the 12 hours which was equivalent of 4 
residence times, which was considered sufficient to achieve initial steady state conditions.  Two tests 
were performed, with the initial tests used to confirm the testwork protocol and system as well as 

providing guidance for the target optimal operating conditions.  The conditions and results for the 

second tests are summarised in Table 13.2.16.

At this stage no testing of an alternate downstream process route inclusive of direct solvent extraction 
and Ni sulphate crystallization has been undertaken.  JRV, Mworx and Lycopodium experience and 
public domain information however indicate that the neutralised PLS would be amenable to direct 

solvent extraction utilising a Bulong or CMN style flowsheet. 

Analysis of the PLS, neutralized PLS and MHP indicate there are potential deleterious elements 

which could impact the final product purity and hence the potential economic extraction.  Key 
elements of consideration are Fe and Al within the neutralization circuit.  Ensuring minimum Fe and 
Al remain in neutralized PLS will be critical with target values of less than 50ppm.  Testwork has 

shown this is achievable.  For downstream processing to final product it is known that the presence 
of Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn, Si and Zn can be problematic and impact the value of the final product.  
Preliminary testing to produce MHP did not encounter issues with product purity however future 

testing must validate these outcomes for the proposed DSX downstream flowsheet. 

13.2.10 Heap Leach Scale Up and Design Criteria Inputs 

It has long been recognised (Ref 7,8,9,10,11 and 12) that it is necessary to scale-up the Ni and Co 
dissolution results from column testwork to reflect the non-ideal production conditions that exist in a 

commercial production scale heap leach operation.  Column leach testwork is conducted on small 

samples of ore under ideal conditions in a laboratory environment. 

Depending on the heap leach system envisaged, a scale-up is applied to the rate and extent of metal 

recovery and typically based on the rate and volume of leach solution applied to the ore.  

Historically for Cu oxides and sulphides, scale-up has also been applied to the acid consumption.  
However, based on prior experience, Mworx has established that this acid consumption scale-up 
was not necessary for Ni laterite heap leaching.  The leaching chemistry and the relationship between 

acidic destruction of the laterite to release the Ni (and Co) do not change with scale and the scaled 
solution application established for the metal recovery allows for the inefficiencies of acid delivery to 

the ore in a commercial heap. 

For the scale-up of the column test results to the required Pre-Feasibility Study Process Design 
Criteria (PDC) inputs (which are required for a commercial production heap leach operation), Mworx 

has previously used the method described in the following section of this report.  This method has 
also been utilised by internationally recognised metallurgical consultants Miller Metallurgical Services 

(Ref 12). 

The process of scaling-up involves the following 4 steps: 

Step 1 – Adjust the Ni and Co Dissolution Obtained from the Column Tests.  

The test columns chosen as representative for the PEA were the final 4m Ardnaree columns 

conducted at SGS Lakefield Laboratories in 2018 (Ref 7 and 8).  

The column test results for the 4m columns (Column #1, #4 and #7) are shown in Figure 13.2.37. 

The Ni and Co dissolution are then plotted against the volume of leach solution applied (leach 

solution application measured as kL of solution per t of ore).

Based on the curves presented in Figure 13.2.37 above the target dissolution has been determined 

at 10 and 12kL/t leach solution application  

The target Ni and Co dissolutions are adjusted down by an efficiency factor of 5% to reflect non-ideal 
conditions within a commercial heap.  This is based on previous Mworx professional experience. 

This adjustment includes an allowance for heap side-slopes and solution piping/personnel corridors 
that remain unleached.  This is based on a difference between side-slope and piping corridor surface 

area, compared to the heap pad operating surface area.

Step 2 – Scale Up the Volume of Leach Solution Required 
It is then necessary to interpret the column leach results and apply known scale-up to factors known 
to affect the volume of leaching solution required for a commercial production Heap Leach operation. 

These are described in detail below and then summarised in Table 13.2.20  

Ore Density: 

 Ratio of the stacked heap ore bulk density vs the column ore bulk density.  The density for 
the heaps was provided as a result of the Stacking Tests conducted by HydroGeoSense 

(Ref 10). Eg for Limonite 1.12 t/m3 vs 0.96 t/m3 therefore 0.96/1.12 = 0.86. 

Column Height:  

 No adjustment required – 4m column vs 4m heap. 

Field Inefficiencies: 

 Ratio of volume of solution based on ideal conditions within the column vs non-ideal 

conditions within an actual heap, these inefficiencies include: 

- inconsistent ore feed 

- inconsistent agglomeration 

- inconsistent stacking 

- inconsistent solution application

- inconsistent solution permeability within the heap. 

Taking the above field inefficiencies into account, a scale-up factor of 1.5 has been applied based 

on Mworx professional experience and industry practice. 

The scale-up factor for the total volume of leach solution applied for Limonite is therefore:  

0.86 (ore density) x 1.0 (column height) x 1.5 (field inefficiencies) = 1.29 

The Total Solution Application Scale-up Factor of 1.29 then is applied to the Leach Solution 
Application as determined at the Ni and Co dissolution selected, which as stated above is 10 and 12 

kL/t. The scaled-up commercial application requirement is calculated as: 

10 kL/t x 1.29 = 12.86 kL/t 

Step 3 – Leach Time Adjustment 

The final step for the scale up is the adjustment to the leaching time.  The leaching time is 

recalculated with two additional factors applied: 

 Process Design Criteria Irrigation Equipment Utilisation Factor; 

- An adjustment is made when calculating the leaching/irrigation time to account 
for the plant availability which in the Process Design Criteria has been set at 95%. 

 Leach Solution Application Rate; 

- A final adjustment can be made when necessary to the leach solution application 
rate, if the column leach testing was conducted at a rate different to that being 
used as the basis of design.  In this case, the column selected to determine the 

basis of design were operated at a leach solution application rate was 14L/h/m2 
and the long term sustainable commercial heap leach solution application rate, 
based on Mworx professional experience, used as the basis is 7 L/h/m2. 

Consequently, it is determined that no adjustment is required. 

The summary of Scale Up outputs for a commercial heap leach operation is provide below showing 

at 10kL/t the scaled up leach cycles extend from the 145 days required in a column out to 310 to 368 

days.

Step 4 – Acid Consumption 

In this case, no scale-up has been applied to the acid consumption as it is not considered necessary 

in nickel laterite heap leach operations.  The laterite leach system is dependent on the consumption 
of acid to release the Ni (and subsequently Co).  Previous testing and Mworx experience with 
operational Ni Laterite Heap Leach has determined the relationship between acid consumption and 

the extent of Ni dissolution.  This chemistry is not anticipated to change with the scale of the leach 

operation from column to commercial operation.  

The range of acid consumption results for the 4m column tests are summarised below in Figure 
13.2.40.  These have been used directly to predict acid consumption based on the scaled up 

recoveries. 

Process Design Criteria and Mass Balance Inputs 

Based on the detailed analysis and interpretation presented above, Table 13.2.21 has been derived 

as inputs for the Nico Young Heap Leach PDC assuming a 4m Heaps.

The major constraint on the Nico Young Heap Leach PDC is acid consumption with the acid plant 
designed to allow for a maximum of 4,400tpd of concentrated sulphuric acid.  The acid consumptions 
associated with the 15kL/t solution application exceed the capacity of the acid plant when using the 

LoM production plan.  On this basis it is necessary to utilise the 13kl/t recoveries and acid 

consumption as the basis for the PDC.  

The stacking equipment is designed to allow for heap heights up to 4m.  The PDC allows for an 
average Leach Cycle time of 365 days, however the design basis for the sizing of the leach pads 
allows for an additional 90 to 120 days as there is a requirement for additional time for flushing of the 

heaps, draining, de-stacking the heaps and taking residue to TSF, re-establishing the leach pad and 
stacking of the new heap.  As such the PDC is within the design parameters used for the Heap Leach 

Facility.  There is sufficient leach solution pumping capacity also allowed for.  

Downstream Ni and Co Losses 

The metallurgical testwork program indicated that for a 2-stage neutralisation, Ni and Co losses to 
the residue were in the order of 0.5 to 1%.  With the inclusion of seed recycle in both stages and

inclusion of a re-leach stage for the secondary neutralisation solids it is anticipated losses will be 

minimised to 1.0%.  

Subsequent testing of a two stage MHP indicated Ni and Co recovery in excess of 99%.  The process 
design considers the recycle of the second stage MHP which will allow the second stage to be 
operated to maximise Ni and Co extraction and hence minimise loss.  It is anticipated that losses will 

be kept to 1.0%.  

Previous Mworx experience with a similar downstream direct solvent extraction recovery process 

through to Ni sulphate indicated Ni and Co recoveries of 97%.  

Combining the calculated heap leach scaled up values and the downstream losses provides 

guidance for the overall process design criteria.  These numbers are provided below in Table 13.2.22. 

As the metallurgical testwork was conducted in parallel to the process modelling and design it was 

necessary to provide preliminary Design Criteria inputs based on the preliminary data available, 
before completion of any tests.  The values utilised for the PDC are also provided in the table. The 
Revised PDC utilises the metallurgical testwork data and has been adopted as the basis for design 

for this study.

The Bottle Roll data using the finer crush sizes indicates potential to improve the rate of Ni recovery 

but not the ultimate extent of Ni recovery.  The acid consumption characteristics appear unchanged. 
Geotechnical and Hydrodynamic testing has indicated that the finer crush size will support heap 
leaching for the Saprolite and Weathered Serpentinite. At this stage the results from the finer crush 

size have not been incorporated into the revised PDC. 

During the study it was necessary, prior to completion of metallurgical testing to provide inputs for 

the Mining Study.  The table below summarises the inputs provided and compares them to the 
subsequent PDC inputs generated from the finalised testwork. In all instances the assumptions 

provided to the Mining Study are similar and further optimisation is possible.

13.2.11 Future Testwork 

The testwork conducted to date has concentrated on the Ardnaree deposit and providing sufficient 

information to support the PEA.  It has been assumed that the Thuddungra deposit ore types will 

behave similarly to that of Ardnaree but this must be proven in the next phase of study. 

A limited number of small scale batch/continuous laboratory tests for solution neutralisation, Fe/Al 
removal and MHP have been conducted on the solutions generated from the Ardnaree column 

testing.  

No testing of downstream refinery processes has been undertaken. 

Based on an improved geological, mining, metallurgical and geometallurgical understanding it is 
necessary to undertake significant additional drilling to provide sufficient representative samples of 

ore types and potential ore type variability. 

Recommended Future Metallurgical Testwork 

The following metallurgical testwork has been identified as necessary to support the basis of a 
definitive feasibility study (DFS).  Samples should be collected from future resource/reserve definition 
drilling planned to completed as part of the DFS from the Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits that 

make up the Nico Young project. 

The recommended testwork is broken down into four broad categories: 

 GeoMetallurgical Testing. 

 Material Characterisation and Batch Column Leach Testing. 

 Batch Neutralisation and DSX testing. 

 Integrated Pilot Plant for generation of marketing samples. 

GeoMetallurgical Testing 

GeoMetallurgical characterization for each of the ore deposits part of the Nico Young project should 

be continued.  A rapid acid consumption testing technique has been developed for the analysis of 
acid consumption and rates of Ni, Co, Fe, Mg dissolution.  This test can be used to determine these 
different characteristics across the entire ore bodies and used in conjunction with the geochemistry 

results to prepare optimized mining schedules that look to smooth out significant variations in acid 
consumption and Ni/Co recoveries.  These rapid acid consumption tests should become part of the 
standard Geochemical data suite of analysis so indicative metallurgical characteristics can be 

collected and entered into the pit geological models to assist in mine planning/optimization.  The test 

should be performed on 1 meter intersections for use with the geological models.  

Additional Bottle Roll test should be conducted on selected samples and composites to provide 

additional guidance and correlation to anticipated column leach behaviour

Material Characterisation and Batch Column Leaching 

Further detailed material characterisation and metallurgical column testwork is necessary at the 

selected heap height for each of the ore deposits, tested by ore type as part of a variability testwork 

program.  

A preliminary testing matrix is presented in Table 13.2.24.  As part of the sample preparation for each 

ore type by deposits, the following tests would also be necessary:  

 Head grade. 

 Size by Size analysis. 

 Mineralogy – QEMSCAN or equivalent. 

 Unconfined Compression Test – UCS. 

 Abrasion Index – Ai. 

 Crushing Work Index – CWi. 

 Materials Handling, Geomechanical and Geochemical testing of column leach residues and 
neutralisation residues (residue from the column leach tests and residues generated from 
the neutralisation tests will need to be subjected to both Geotechnical and Geochemical 

testing to allow for inputs into the design for residue handling and residue storage facility. 
Geotechnical testing would include CBR, shear box/triaxial, stability and Atterberg limit 
testing.  The geochemical would include determination of sulphate, metal and acid 

dissolution and mobility characteristics. 

 Agglomeration Optimisation, Stacking and Hydrodynamic Column Testing (HGS) 

The column testwork would be conducted at the selected heap height for each of the ore deposits. 
Testing would be conducted to understand the leaching characteristics based on ore/lithology type, 

Ni and Co grade and impurity variability.  An outline of the proposed test program is summarised 

below in Table 13.2.24

Based on the results from the variability testwork and rapid acid consumption testing, representative 
composites of ore blends to be processed over the first 5 years of operation should be prepared and 
evaluated under closed circuit conditions with neutralization and SX to simulate expected recycle 

conditions to see whether any impurities expectantly build up in solution and cause other issues.  

Batch/Continuous Neutralization, MHP and DSX Testing 

Testing of the PLS generated in the batch column testing needs to undergo two stage neutralization, 
using reagents that will be sourced for actual plant operations as well as water characteristics.  The 

variation in neutralization should be assed at various temperatures between 60 and 80°C, residence 

times of 2 to 8hrs and different pH values.  

In previous testing, seed recycling was required to be able to generate solids that gave acceptable 
solid liquid separation characteristic.  During the testing processes, representative samples of 
slurries should be collected and sent to equipment vendors for equipment selection/sizing evaluation 

(thickening and filtration) when tests involving seed recycling are completed.  

Testing of the neutralised PLS generated via a two stage MHP precipitation process using 

commercial magnesia is required.  The variation in MHP conditions to generate the required product 
specifications should be assed at various temperatures between 60 and 80°C, residence times of 2 

to 8hrs and different pH values.  

In previous testing, seed recycling was required to be able to generate solids that gave acceptable 
solid liquid separation characteristic.  During the testing processes, representative samples of 

slurries should be collected and sent to equipment vendors for equipment selection/sizing evaluation 

(thickening and filtration) when tests involving seed recycling are completed.  

The selected DSX process should be tested under the various likely feed conditions (grade, pH), on 
a batch basis, to determine the chemical and physical robustness of the selected flowsheet and DSX 
reagent, whilst generating isotherm data to design the continuous pilot plant operating conditions. 

The majority of these tests can be completed simply using single contact batch tests.  

Integrated Pilot Plant 

The operation of an integrated pilot plant is driven by the need for proof of the robustness of the 
selected flowsheet, determination of key design criteria inputs and generation of final product 

samples for marketing purposes to prove the quality and specification of final product that can be 
produced from the Nico Young project, according to the selected project flowsheet (MHP or Ni 

sulphate and Co sulphide). 

The pilot plant can be operated on either a batch or integrated basis between unit operations.  All 
reagents used as part of this testing need to be sourced from actual suppliers intending to supply the 

operating plant.  

Approximately 1t of ore from Ardnaree and Thuddungra should be leached in bulk conditions based 

on the optimized conditions determined in the variability and closed cycle testing described above in 
batch column leaching section.  Bulk PLS solutions generated every 30 days would be processed 
through a continuous integrated 2 stage neutralization pilot plant.  This could be integrated with a

continuous DSX pilot plant or operated separately.  The two Ni and Co rich solutions generated in 

DSX would then be processed through crystallization to produce samples for marketing purposes.  

It is anticipated that the testwork program would take approximately 18 months to complete.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Introduction 

During June 2018, Mineral Resource estimates were updated to incorporate additional drilling 
completed in February 2018 by JRV, together with additional multi-element assays completed in 

2018. The 2018 Mineral Resource estimate was undertaken by Mr R. Sulway of Snowden and 

reviewed by the author.  The Mineral Resource has an effective date of June 2018. 

The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared under the direction of a Qualified Person as 
defined in NI43-101, in accordance with accepted industry practice and have been classified and 
reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012, Ref 26). There are no material differences 

between the definitions of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources under the CIM 

Definition Standards and the equivalent definitions in the JORC Code. 

14.2 Method 

The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared via the following steps: 

 Data compilation and validation – this was undertaken by OMI and Geostats on behalf of 

JRV and reviewed  

 Data preparation (this and subsequent steps are discussed below) 

 Geological interpretation and modelling 

 Establishment of block models 

 Compositing of assay intervals 

 Exploratory data analysis of Ni, Co and other constituents 

 Analysis of top-cuts 

 Variogram analysis 

 Derivation of kriging plan and boundary conditions 

 Grade interpolation of Ni, Co and other constituents 

 Validation of grade estimates 

 Assignment of dry density 

 Classification of estimates with respect to JORC Code (2012) guidelines 

 Resource tabulation and resource reporting.

Drillhole Locations 

The drilling data was provided to Snowden in the form of a Microsoft Access database 

(JJRV_YoungDrillingDB_31-05-2018.accdb) by Geostats on behalf of JRV. The drilling data was 
exported as text files (CSV format) and imported into Datamine software and de-surveyed (the 

sample tables were merged, and the local grid coordinates were added to each sample interval). 

All drill collars were located by a licenced surveyor or by trained JRV personnel (Trimble SP60 
differential GPS) around the time of drilling. The supplied drillhole collar coordinates were based on 

the MGA Zone 55 grid. 

AAM Group was engaged by JRV to undertake an aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) 

survey in May 2018. This data was used to generate a surface digital terrain model (DTM). 
Snowden examined the collar table and noted some collar coordinates had integer RL values but 
non-integer easting and northing coordinates, which suggested that at some stage some collars 

have been pressed to a contour surface. Snowden projected the affected collar values onto the 
current topography to address this issue. Most of the adjusted values involved small differences; 

however, for some holes the differences were several metres. 

No downhole surveys were collected for any of the various drilling campaigns, given that all the 
drilling was vertical and relatively shallow with an average depth of 35 m. The approach is 

considered to be reasonable and in line with practices at other laterite projects. 

14.2.1 Database Validation 

Snowden accepted the data supplied by Geostats and OMI on an "as-is" basis and carried out 
validation checks as part of preparing the data for estimation in addition to the verification 

described in Section 16. The database checks undertaken by Snowden are listed below (no 

significant issues were identified): 

 The downhole sampling intervals were consistent with no overlapping sample intervals 

 The sample tables were checked to ensure there were no duplicate sample records 

 There were no missing or incomplete collar survey coordinates 

 There were no negative downhole sample ranges or grades. 

Absent field values were denoted as "blank" values in the database. In the case of numeric fields, 

these were treated as nulls when loading the data and storing it in Datamine tables. 

All estimated grade/compound fields were stored as percent fields with the exception of Cr. Cr was 

converted to percentage values prior to compiling the estimates. All estimated grade fields are in 

percent. 

Snowden identified minor occurrences of historic oxide assays for Al, Ca, Cr, Mg and Mn in the 

database. These were converted to elemental values.

14.2.2 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

The Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits are interpreted based on the following approach: 

 Understanding changes in chemistry as a function of depth and weathering are critical to 
defining the mineralised zones and the development of a processing method. Three 

distinct layers (domains) were defined as a function of geological logging and the grade 
fields; a Ni depleted surface layer (Cover), an underlying limonite, clay, and saprolite unit, 

and finally a basement unit consisting of weathered to fresh serpentinite and mafics.  

 Snowden found no spatial or distinctive statistical trends such as inflexions in log 
probability plots which could be used to distinguish mineralised and non-mineralised 

layers in terms of Ni and Co. While a distinct 0.15% threshold exists in the Ni 
distributions, the two populations overlap each other to such an extent it is of limited use 
in the modelling process. As such, Snowden elected not to use a Ni threshold to delimit 

"mineralised" from non-mineralised layers. 

 All grade estimates (Ni, Co, Ca, Mg, Fe, Ca, Mn, Al, SiO2) were compiled within the three 

domains using hard boundaries. The model was clipped to the currently held JRV licence 
boundaries (EL5527 and EL5571). To avoid edge effects in the model and to make use of 
drilling data just outside the licence limits, where appropriate the domain wireframes were 

all extended along strike beyond the current licence boundaries. The extension distances 

ranged typically between 200 m and 500 m. 

 To the east the mineralisation is bounded in many areas by granite. The other 
surrounding rock-types from an estimation point of view are considered undifferentiated 
sediments and volcanics. These two non-laterite domains were allocated mean values for 

the nine grade constituents. The model volume consisting of granite was defined using a 
purpose-built wireframe while all remaining areas not in the mineralised sequence or in 

the granite areas are considered undifferentiated sediments.  

 In order to distinguish limonite dominated layers from the more saprolitic rock in the 
middle horizon, a limonite interpretation was compiled based on logging and Fe, Ni, Al 

and Mg grades. The limonite unit was used for reporting purposes and to assign a density 

value. This domain played no role in the grade estimation process.  

Snowden was supplied with a number of regional scale magnetic surveys which had been 
superimposed with the EL boundaries and drillhole collars. The magnetic highs reflecting the 
underlying ultramafic rocks (source of the mineralisation) are quite distinct and have been the main 

drilling target. While the host rocks extend along strike for tens of kilometres, the widths are 
relatively narrow being typically a few hundred metres wide (200–500 m) and have largely been 
tested by drilling. Across-strike drilling was typically stopped after intercepting non-ultramafics such 

as granite or where the laterite profile pinched out against the underlying serpentinites (saprock 
exposed at surface). Extrapolation distances for the various geology domain wireframes were 
based on halving the nominal drillhole spacing of 100 m x 300 m in the X and Y directions 

respectively. As such, mineralisation was extrapolated:

 Typically, 50 m across strike beyond the last drillhole except in cases where barren host 

rocks (not ultramafic) were intercepted, e.g. granite, sediments.  

 In a few cases, extrapolation was extended up to 200 m across strike where two wide 
sections (five or more holes) of mineralisation were infilled by only a few (two to three) 

drillholes. 

 Between 50 m and 150 m along strike, depending on the width of the last intercept and 

the proximity of any licence boundaries. 

 The vertical extrapolation in the Serpentinite/Saprock zone was set to 35 m below the 
base of the saprolite surface. This distance was based on a mean thickness of drilling 

intercepts in this domain (ROCK=3000) of 13 m and a range in thicknesses of 1 m to 

70 m. All blocks below this level were flagged as unclassified. 

The laterite profile and surrounding country rocks (granite and undifferentiated sediments) were 
flagged in the model using a field called ROCK. The criteria used to define the various domains 

along with the corresponding ROCK values are summarised in Table 14.2.1.  

Table 14.2.1 Rock Domain Criteria 

 Short description Logging and grade criteria 

1000 Cover sediments Surface unconsolidated sediments depleted in Ni. Typically logged as 
"ALUV", "SOIL" and to a lesser extent "CLAY". Mg <3%, Ni <0.3%, Al 
>5%. 

2000 Limonite/saprolite Typically logged as "LIM", "SAP" and to a lesser extent "CLAY". Fe 
>10%, Mg <10% at the base of the profile. 

3000 Serpentinite (Saprock) Typically logged as "SERP" with Mg values in excess of 10%. 

8000 Undifferentiated sediments Any blocks drillhole records which sit outside the laterite and granite 
domains are given a rock value of 9000. No other criteria are used. 

9000 Granite Logged as granite, Ni <0.3. 

A set of wireframes were compiled to delimit the limonite dominated areas in the mixed 
saprolite/limonite domain (ROCK=2000). The criteria used to define the limonite domain along with 

the corresponding LIMONITE values are summarised in Table 14.2.2.

14.2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis 

The drillhole data was composited downhole prior to running the estimation process using a 1 m 
compositing interval to minimise any sample bias due to sample length. The compositing was run 
within the ROCK attribute field to ensure that no composite intervals crossed any boundaries. To

allow for uneven sample lengths within each of the domains, the Datamine composite process 
(COMPDH) was run using the variable sample length method (@MODE=1). This adjusts the 
sample intervals where required to ensure all samples are included in the composite file (i.e. no 

residuals) while keeping the composite interval as close to the desired sample interval as possible. 

The compositing process was validated by comparing the sample length statistics in the raw and 

composite files. The two total length values should match, and the mean composite interval should 

be close to 1. No discrepancies were identified. 

Composite statistics were reviewed for each assay constituent by ROCK code to determine the 

grade characteristics and ensure the domains are suitable for estimation.  

Summary statistics of the composited sample data are presented in Table 14.2.3.  

2.3 for Ni, Co Al, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, SiO2 and Mn within each ROCK code. 

Snowden found the grade/compound populations within the three laterite domains are all only 
mildly skewed with generally low (<1) coefficient of variation values ("CV" – ratio of the standard 

deviation to the mean). It is therefore Snowden's opinion that grades within the laterite domains 
with the exceptions of Ca and Mg do not require top-cutting and that ordinary block kriging is an 
appropriate estimation method for these three domains.  For the granite domain, while the domains 

were generally only mildly skewed, a few non-granite samples included in that domain were 

distorting the results and so the Ni, Co, Mg and Cr values were top-cut.

14.2.4 Top-Cuts 

The presence of relatively high CV values for Ca and Mg in some of the estimation domains 
required top-cuts to be applied to prevent overestimation and smearing of the relatively high values 

(when compared to majority of results) into the surrounding blocks.  

Mean values were assigned to the blocks in the essentially non-mineralised, undifferentiated 

sediments and granite domains (ROCK=8000 and 9000 respectively). The granite domains 
contained anomalous results for Ni, Co, Cr and Mg and so these were also cut prior to the 

generation of top-cut means. 

Top-cutting involved resetting the grades which exceed a top cut value to the top-cut value on a 

domain by domain basis. 

Top-cut values for each domain were defined by an analysis of log probability plots and 
histograms. The impact of the selected top cut threshold was assessed based on the CV and the 

number of samples that were cut. The top-cut and its impact on the domain CV statistic for the 

mineralised domains are summarised in Table 14.2.4.

14.2.5 Variogram Analysis 

Variograms were generated to assess the grade continuity of each element/constituent within the 

mineralised domains. Snowden Supervisor software was used to generate and model the 

variograms. 

The Datamine Unfold process was used to transform the sample coordinates into a flat (not 
undulating) state. This allows variogram analysis and grade estimation to be carried out using the 
"pre-folding" coordinates, which are then converted back to the folded (local) coordinate system. 

The unfolding process results in more samples (and more correctly aligned samples) being

available for variogram modelling and grade estimation than would have been the case if standard 

resource estimation methods based on the local grid were used. 

Control strings, which define the upper and lower contacts of the deposit geometry to be unfolded, 
are required for the unfolding process. The control strings were created on a sectional basis using 
a set of vertical sections orientated perpendicular to the strike of the stratigraphy paralleling the 

drilling lines. The base of saprolite/limonite surface was used to define the profile of each string. 

The sections are typically located approximately 50 m to 800 m apart, depending on the drill 

section spacing. The distance between the hangingwall and footwall strings was set to ensure that 
all the mineralised horizons and the immediate surrounding host rocks were enclosed by the two 
sets of strings. These control strings define the UCSB (down dip) direction. A plan view of the 

UCSB control strings is shown in Figure 14.2.1 and three-dimensional (3D) view is shown in Figure 

14.2 2.

Normal scores unfolded variograms were modelled for the horizons estimated using ordinary 
kriging. This method produces a clearer image of the ranges of continuity in skewed datasets. 

Downhole variograms were modelled to determine the nugget, followed by directional variography. 

Variograms were modelled using the following general approach: 

 The ROCK=1000, 2000 and 3000 domains were modelled using the unfolded coordinate 

fields. 

 All variogram variances were standardised to a sill of one. 

 All grades were modelled using two or three structure spherical variograms. 

 The nugget and sill values were then back-transformed to traditional variograms using the 

discrete gaussian polynomials technique prior to estimation. 

 There was insufficient data to model variograms for all three ROCK domains for SiO2 and 

Mn. Variogram models from other domains were used as an alternative. 

Variogram model parameters are listed in Table 14.2.5.

14.2.6 Block Model Setup 

Snowden compiled a volume model based on the model extents, parent cell and minimum sub-cell 

sizes listed in Table 14.2.6. 

Table 14.2.6 Block Model Prototype Settings 

 Value 

X Origin 591800 mE 

Y Origin 6207300 mN 

Z Origin 210 mRL 

Maximum easting  601500 mE 

Maximum northing 6222600 mN 

Maximum elevation (RL)  470 mRL 

Parent cell size – X  50 m 

Parent cell size – Y  100 m 

Parent cell size – Z  2 m 

Minimum cell size – X  25 m 

Minimum cell size – Y  25 m 

Minimum cell size – Z  1 m 

 

The parent cell sizes were based on the nominal drillhole spacing of 100 m x 400 m in the X and Y 
directions respectively. There was however a small area in the northern portion of the Ardnaree 
deposit where infill drilling had been closed down to a nominal spacing of 100 m x 100 m in the X 

and Y directions respectively which would support grade estimation using a parent cell size of 25 m 

x 25 m x 2 m. 

14.2.7 Grade Estimation Method 

Datamine software was used to: 

 Unfold the sample data and block discretisation points for ordinary block kriging. 

 Estimate the nine grade fields in the three domains (1000, 2000, 3000) using ordinary 
kriging (top-cut where appropriate). Merge the two parent grid estimate models into a 

single model. 

 The estimation boundaries between the ROCK=1000, 2000 and 3000 were all treated as 

hard. 

 Unassigned blocks in the 1000, 2000 and 3000 domains were allocated mean grades 
based on the corresponding drillhole domain statistics. If the original sample data was 

top-cut, top-cut means were applied. 

Allocate mean grades to the 8000 and 9000 domains.

14.2.8 Search Parameters and Search Ellipse Strategy 

The search ellipse parameters were derived from variogram modelling and are summarised in 

Table 14.2.7. A single search ellipse was used for all estimates to keep the nine estimated grades 

consistent (based on the same samples).

The selection of samples was clipped so that a maximum of four composites was used from any 

one drillhole when estimating each block grade. This restraint was applied to stop the individual 
block estimates being based on only two or three drillholes and to reduce the vertical smearing of 

grades through the profile. 

The distribution of the various attribute values within each of the domains is quite variable due to 
differences in drilling spacing and incomplete sampling/assaying of the non-Ni and Co grades. As 

such, if a single search ellipse was applied for the estimation process then a significant proportion 
of cells within the interpreted mineralised domains would not get an estimate for all the grade fields. 
To ensure that each cell within the mineralisation domains includes a value, the following approach 

was used: 

 Dynamic search volumes (expanding search volumes) were used to help with the grade 

interpolation process. After the first pass any blocks which could not be estimated were 
processed a second time after doubling the lengths of the search ellipse. If using the 
largest defined ellipse still fails to meet the minimum sample requirements, then no grade 

will be estimated for that particular cell. 

 In instances where grades could not be estimated with either of the two search ellipses, 

raw mean values (top-cut where relevant) were assigned instead.  

14.2.9 Estimation Settings 

The key search ellipse and estimation parameters are summarised in Table 14.2.8.

14.2.10 Grade Model Validation 

The grade estimates were validated using: 

 A visual comparison of the block grade estimates with the input drillhole composite data. 

 Generation of moving window grade trend plots of the block grade estimates, de-

clustered (nearest neighbour method) composites and naïve composite grades, along 
with the number of composite samples available. Example plots for Ni and Co in Domain 

2000 are provided in Figure 14.2.3 and Figure 14.2.4. 

 A global comparison of the estimated block grades to the average input grades (naïve 

drill samples and de-clustered composites) (Table 14.2.9).

The conclusions from the model validation work are: 

 Visual comparison of the model grades and the corresponding drillhole grades for the 

ROCK domains shows a good correlation for most domains. 

 With the exception of some of the poorly sampled domains (SIO2PCT and MNPCT), the 

grade trend plots generally show a good correlation between the patterns in the model 

cell grades compared with the drillhole grades. 

 A comparison of the global de-clustered mean drillhole and model domain grades for the 
three laterite domains shows a good correlation. The differences between the mean 
model and the de-clustered grades are mostly less than 15%, which Snowden considers 

reasonable given the generally broad spaced nature of the drilling.

14.2.11 Density Assignment 

The results classified by JRV logging are presented in Table 14.2.10. A number of results are less 

than 1, a common problem with core-based laterite density measurements due mostly to core 
swell. As such two means were calculated, a "raw mean" and a cut mean derived after excluding 

values less than 1.

14.2.12 Mineral Resource Classification 

The Nico Young Project model (Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits) was classified in accordance 
with the JORC Code (2012) guidelines. Model blocks were flagged as Inferred, Indicated or 

unclassified based on the following guidelines: 

 Whilst the results from the QC analysis are not ideal, they are not sufficient to render the 

data unsuitable for resource estimation. 

 Mining studies will be invariably based on shallow open pit mining. 

 Indicated Resources were flagged in the model using a closed wireframe solid for the 
Limonite/Saprolite domain for blocks supported by 100 m x 100 m nominal drillhole 
spacing with Ni and Mg grade data. All other 2000 and 3000 domain mineralisation was 

classified as inferred.  

 The vertical extrapolation in the Serpentinite/Saprock zone was set to 35 m below the 

base of the saprolite surface. All blocks below this level were flagged as unclassified. 

 All blocks in the granite and undifferentiated sediments were flagged as unclassified.

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Introduction 

As the majority of the Mineral Resource is Inferred and of lower confidence, any technical and 
financial results should be viewed with caution.  Reserves have not been generated. Any 

references to ore are purely generic and do not imply an Ore Reserve as defined by the JORC 

Code (2012) guidelines.   

For this section, all currency is quoted in Australian dollars and tonnes are presented as dry 

tonnes, unless otherwise noted. 

16.2 Mining Method 

Figure 16.2.1 summarises the proposed mining cycle.  

Figure 16.2.1 Mining Cycle Activities 

 
 

16.2.1 Clearing and Stripping 

The entire mining area will be cleared of buildings, installations and vegetation to a depth of 

150 mm.  All trees, bushes and other vegetable matter will be stockpiled separately at designated 
locations.  The actual depth of recovered topsoil will depend on location and be based on license 
requirements.  All areas where topsoil stripping occurs will be surveyed before and after topsoil 

removal. 

The topsoil will be pushed into piles by a bulldozer or grader before a wheel loader or excavator 

loads it into trucks.  Trucks will then haul the soil to stockpiles for later use on rehabilitation, or

possibly direct to active rehabilitation areas.  The stockpile areas will be cleared and surveyed prior 

to topsoil deposition. 

16.2.2 Grade Control 

Due to the local variability of the resource contacts, grade control drilling and assaying will be 

necessary to define the ore outline prior to presentation to the plant. 

The following activities are associated with grade control: 

 It will be undertaken up to a year ahead of the planned mining.  This is to provide 
sufficient time to update the grade control block model, re-optimise the pit limits, redesign 

the pit and reschedule the operation. 

 A RC drill rig with diameter between 4 inches and 5.5 inches, as specified in a quotation. 

 Drilling will be on a 10 m x 10 m drill grid with an average hole depth of about 40 m 

(ranging between about 6 m and 44 m).  

 Samples will be collected at 1 m intervals from 2 m above the limonite contact to 2 m 

below the anticipated pit, based on logging.  

 It is expected that about 50 km drilling per annum (30–70 km) and 15,000 x 1 m samples 

per annum (10,000 to 20,000) will be required. 

16.2.3 Drill and Blast 

Drill and blast is not expected to be required for this project. However, no test-work on rock 

strength has been completed for this study and should be confirmed in the next round of study. 

16.2.4 Excavation Guidance 

In general, excavation guidance will involve the following steps: 

 Aircore drilling and sampling. 

 Ore control: 

- dig plan creation 

- mark out by surveyors 

- face channel sampling of mineralised blocks  

- ore spotting (in pit and excavator) 

 Reconciliation:

- comparison of mined and processed with grade control and resource block

16.2.5 Excavation 

 All deposits are proposed to be mined with typical truck and excavator mining using contractors. 

Snowden's opinion is that other options (such as scraper/dozer systems or surface miners and 

similar) are unlikely to give a material improvement in project economics. 

There are typically four horizons within the laterite profile located above the bedrock (cover, 
limonite, saprolite and serpentinite).  Sections for Ardnaree North and Thuddungra South are 

shown in Figure 16.2.2 and 16.2.3 respectively.

A 190-t class excavator is proposed to provide reasonable selectivity. Table 16.2.1 lists excavators

16.2.6 Haulage 

Ore will be hauled from the pit to either the leach pad (higher grade) or stockpiles located near the 
mining area for lower grades.  Ore from stockpiles is then rehandled and hauled mining trucks, to 

the leach pad located centrally between the Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits. 

Waste will be tipped in existing pit voids where possible, or in temporary external waste dumps. 
These external dumps will be rehandled back into pit voids when the void capacity becomes 

available, returning the project to near-pre-mining surface profile.  All dumps and pit voids are 

unlined and no special measures have been assumed to be necessary when managing waste. 

Rigid body 90-t class haul trucks are proposed for the project.  Ramps and roads were designed for 
this size truck and allows for ramp to truck width ratios of 3.6 to 3.8 (typical range is 3.5 to 4). 
Snowden notes that the haul from some of the outlying locations to the leach pad can be nearly 

11 km long.  This can lead to heat build-up in truck tyres and will need to be managed by rotating 
trucks through shorter hauls and/or increasing fixed cycle times.  It may be beneficial to consider 
contracting on-highway trucks to carry this duty, although given the volumes and distance the 

benefit is unlikely to be material. 

Table16.2.2 lists rigid haul trucks around the 90-t class.

16.2.7 Trafficability 

No trafficability study was completed; it should be completed in the next round of study.  It is 

envisaged that some sheeting may be required during wet periods.  Sources and quantities of 

sheeting should be investigated at the next level of study. 

16.2.8 Mine to Mill 

The mine is targeting the highest value (combination of nickel and cobalt revenue) to the plant, 

subject to the constraints around processing limits and mining practicalities.  No restrictions have 
been applied on grades or lithologies.  However, this should be reviewed in the next phase of 

study. 

16.2.9 Rehabilitation 

The closure objective will be to return the mining area to pre-mining condition, by filling pit voids. 
There is a reasonable balance of void space and loose waste volume (after swell) meaning there

are only a couple of pits that are not returned to the natural surface level (in Ardnaree).  Testwork 

and analysis of potential acid rock drainage should be completed in the next round of studies. 

16.2.10 Water Management 

Surface water will be controlled using a combination of drains and bunds to direct water away from 

open pits, dumps, stockpiles and infrastructure.  Culverts will be required to allow drainage under 

haul roads. 

16.3 Mine Design 

16.3.1 Methodology 

Both deposits underwent a standard process of pit optimisation and design. 

Pit optimisations were completed in Whittle Four-X™ software, an industry standard software 
package.  This software determines the economic limits of each deposit after accounting for 
estimated revenues and costs associated with mining each block and the maximum allowable 

slope angles.  Nested pit shells produced by the pit optimisation were used in the selection of the 

"optimum" pit shell and guiding the location of pit stages. 

Using the selected pit shells, pit designs for the final pit limits and stages were undertaken in 
MineSight®.  The pit designs were used to derive volumes for waste placement.  An initial schedule 
was completed to determine mining sequence, and availability of in-pit dumping capacity over time. 

Any excess waste was used to calculate temporary external dump capacities for design.  

16.3.2 Mining Model 

The resource block model used for mine planning is named "jvyoungnico010818.dm". 

The following steps were undertaken on the resource models to derive the mining models: 

 Re-blocking to 25 m x 25 m x 2 m high. When grade control drilling is undertaken at 10 m 

x 10 m scale, the selective mining unit (SMU) should be able to be adjusted to 5 m x 5 m 
x 2 m. However, as the sub-cell resolution of the geology model was 25 m x 25 m x 1 m, 
this size was used for the feasibility study (FS). It is believed that the modelling (on limited 

drilling data) leads to smooth estimates reflecting internal mixing and dilution of the 
deposit for the considered ore loading selectivity. Exclusion areas (e.g. off lease) were 

coded into the models with a 25 m offset. 

 Incorporation of the limonite flag into the lithology (i.e. concatenating the ROCK and 

LIMONITE fields from the resource model). 

 The fields retained in the model were: 

- ROCK (1000 = Cover, 1500 = Limonite, 2000 = Saprolite, 3000 = Serpentite, 
8000/9000 = Basement)

- DEP (1 = Ardnaree, 2 = Thuddungra) 

- RESCAT (2 = Indicated, 3 = Inferred, 4 = Unclassified) 

- Grade fields (Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, SiO2) all in %. 

As the deposit is relatively flat dipping, re-blocking only occurs in the vertical and the grade-
tonnage impact of the re-blocking is negligible (Figure 16.3.1).  This is due to the large block size 
used for estimation likely incorporating the internal dilution.  Of note, is the extreme sensitivity to 

grade for the project (not uncommon for nickel laterite projects), particularly around the marginal 
cut-off grade (approximately 0.7% nickel equivalent – NiEq). This means there is a wide range of 
potential mining inventories for the project depending on the prevailing technical and economic 

parameters applied. At this cut-off grade, there is a mining loss of 2.3% with minimal dilution.

16.3.3 Pit Optimisation 

Parameters and Modifying Factors 

Pit optimisations were completed based on parameters derived from similar projects or supplied by 

JRV based on work completed to October 2018.  These parameters are detailed below.  

Resource Classification 

Indicated and Inferred Resources were considered for pit optimisation.

Page 16.8 
 

Starting Surface 

All deposit starting surfaces were the topographies used to generate the resource models.  The 

topography used was based on a LiDAR survey completed by AAM Group in May 2018. 

Boundaries 

Snowden applied an offset of about 25 m to the lease boundaries for pit optimisation.  This mainly 

impacts the northern and eastern extents of Thuddungra. 

Geotechnical Constraints 

A 35° overall wall angle was applied for pit optimisation based on experience in similar deposits. 

No geotechnical testwork or analysis was completed. 

Dilution and Mining Recovery 

Dilution and mining recovery were determined in the mining model (refer to Section 1). 

Processing Rate 

A process rate of 3,000 kt/a was applied.  The scenario contemplates a heap leach operation with 

a refinery to produce nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphide products. 

Processing Recovery and Acid Consumption 

Overall process recovery (leach and refinery) and acid consumptions vary by lithology, supplied by 

JRV.  These are provided in Table 16.3.1. 

Table 16.3.1 Process Recovery and Acid Consumption Assumptions by Lithology 

Lithology Overall recovery – Ni (%) Overall recovery – Co (%) 
Acid consumption (kg/t 

feed) 

Limonite 45 80 400

Saprolite 70 80 550

Serpentinite 75 80 450

 
It is likely that recoveries and acid consumptions will vary within the lithologies based on variable 

elemental composition. This should be explored through variability testing. 

Mining Costs 

A mining cost of A$3.70/t was applied to all blocks. 

An incremental ore premium of A$2.15/t feed was applied to cover grade control, stockpile 

management and fixed mining costs. 

Incremental costs for ore haulage were A$0.36/tkm.

Page 16.9 
 

These costs were based on contract quotations sourced in May 2018. 

Process Costs 

As process cost varies by lithology (Table 16.3.2). The main variation is due to differences in acid 

consumption (Table 16.3.1). An additional administration charge of A$3/t feed was applied. 

Table 16.3.2 Process Costs by Lithology 

 Leach cost (A$/t feed) 
Refinery cost (A$/t 

feed) 
Total (A$/t feed) 

Limonite 79 13 92

Saprolite 93 13 106

Serpentinite 85 13 98

 

Selling Costs 

A product transport cost of A$30/t of product was applied. 

A royalty cost of 4% of feed value (revenue minus product and process costs, 33% of 

administration cost) was applied for the pit optimisation.  This came to be an effective rate of less 

than 1% of gross revenue. 

Revenue Assumptions 

A nickel price of US$7.50/lb Ni and US$30.00/lb Co was applied for pit optimisation.  A 110% 

payability factor was applied to nickel and 100% for cobalt. An exchange rate of 0.7 US$/A$ was 

applied. 

16.3.4 Optimisation Results 

The pit optimisation was completed on revenue factors ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 in increments of 

0.05. Results are shown in Table 16.3.3 and Figure 16.3.2.  The pit shells, coloured by revenue 
factor (hot ≤1, cool ≤2), are shown in Figure 16.3.3.  The pits are hypersensitive to economics, with 

a large change in pit size possible with a small change in economics. 

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral 
resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 

applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no 

certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.

The pit shell for design was selected based on a revenue factor of 0.85 as this provided a mine life 
of between 19 and 20 years and contained some conservatism to protect margin. A summary of 

the selected pit shell is shown in Table 16.3.4.  The pit produces an operating margin of 25% 

based on the original input parameters provided.

16.3.5 Pit Design 

Parameters 

As no geotechnical investigation had been completed, Snowden used the design criteria listed 

below for the pit designs, based on experience with similar projects: 

 80° batters 

 4 m bench height 

 4.5 m berms 

All roads and ramps are 27 m wide with a maximum grade angle of 10%.  The minimum width for 

all stages was 30 m with a minimum mining width of 20 m.  Pit floors were designed flat but in more 

advanced work, would need to be slightly inclined to aid drainage.

Design 

Figure 16.3.4 (Thuddungra) and Figure 16.3.5 (Ardnaree) show the ultimate pit.  The pit was 

broken into a number of areas for ease of reporting.  The ultimate pit has excluded a couple of 

areas from the pit shell due to negative economics after mining practicalities are considered.

Each pit region was split into stages, generally following the pit shells numbers, from highest 
margin to lowest.  As the pits need to be backfilled, the stages were kept as small as possible 
without impacting on total waste movements.  Pit stage numbering is shown in Figure 16.3.6 

(Thuddungra) and Figure 16.3.7 (Ardnaree).

Clearing and Topsoil Stripping 

Table 16.3.7 summarises the clearing and topsoil stripping by deposit and type.  Total clearing is 
834 ha.  Topsoil recovery is estimated at 150 mm, producing over 1 Mbcm of topsoil. Large areas 
are required for topsoil stockpiling as topsoil stockpile heights were limited to 2 m.  To minimise the 

overall disturbance area, topsoil stockpiles are placed on future mining areas where possible 

(areas where the stockpile will be reclaimed prior to mining that area are minimal).

16.4 Life of Mine Schedule 

16.4.1 Methodology 

The mining schedule was completed in Snowden's Evaluator scheduling software, which is a Mixed 

Integer Linear programming-based tool. It is driven by the maximisation of net present value (NPV) 

in the presence of physical quantity and grade constraints

 Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Pty Ltd 

Page 16.22 
 

Material Types 

The mining model was coded with material types to allow for selectivity (e.g. stockpiling lower 

grades).  The material type is based on lithology (limonite, saprolite and serpentinite) and grade bin 

(associated with processing margin per tonne in A$20/t increments). 

Time Scale 

The schedule was completed in single year periods for the entire mine life.  

Resolution 

The design inventory was separated into pit stages and 4 m vertical benches for scheduling.  

Within each bench, material was separated into the lithologies for grade maximisation purposes. 

Precedence 

All benches within a stage were dependent on the bench above being mined out.  In addition, 

benches from subsequent, connected stages were prevented from mining below the current stage. 

Sequencing of the pit areas was orientated mining away from the leach pad over the mine life 

(i.e. increasing haulage).  Within a pit area, constraints were applied to force pit stages to be 

completed as soon as possible to provide backfill capacity. 

Active Mining Areas 

The schedule attempted to minimise the number of mining areas mined in any period to simplify the 

mining operation and provide the ability to generate pit voids for backfill. 

The timing of each mining area was determined by first running an unconstrained schedule (with no 

limit on active mining areas) and analysing the results.  The mining areas and deposits were then 
restricted to specific timeframes.  This is shown in Table 16.4.1 with shaded years indicating 
allowed mining.

Bench Turnover 

No bench turnover constraint was applied. Mining was constrained by mining rate. 

Mining 

The prime objective for mining volumes was to smooth the rate of mining.  Snowden completed an 
unconstrained schedule optimisation, before using the profile to smooth mining rates with a 

maximum mining rate of 11.0 Mt/a.  A six-month pre-production period is applied (year 1). 

Processing Throughput and Ramp-up 

The process throughput is 3,000 kt/a. In the first year, Snowden assumed a production of 75% 

(2,250 kt/a). 

Grade Constraints 

No grade constraints were applied.

Economic Assumptions 

The economic assumptions applied for scheduling (driving the discounted value calculation) were 

the same as for pit optimisation (Section 1). 

16.4.2 Schedule Results 

Mining Schedule Results 

Figure 16.4.1 shows the ex-pit movement by deposit.  Mining commences in Ardnaree North. 
Following this, mining is split between Ardnaree (moving from north to south) and Thuddungra 
South and Central South. Ardnaree is complete in year 12.  The maximum mining rate is 10.0 Mt/a 

to 11.2 Mt/a in years 2 to 7 before the rate drops to about 6.0 Mt/a to 8.0 Mt/a for the remainder of 

the mine life.

Figure 16.4.3 shows the ex-pit movement by lithology.  The split between lithologies is relatively 

consistent over the mine life. 

Figure 16.4.3 Total Ex-Pit Movement by Lithology 

 
 

The schedule requires a significant amount of rehandle Figure 16.4.4 shows the timing and extent 
of this.  Waste backfill is dependent on the availability of pit voids for storage which results in some 

years where backfill is not possible. 

Figure 16.4.4 Rehandle Mining Rates 

 
 

Long-Term Stockpile Scheduling Results 

Figure 16.4.5 shows the long-term stockpile balance.  This is a strategic stockpile which allows 
high-grade material to be preferentially processed.  The combined project peak of 7 Mt at 0.50% 

nickel occurs in year 8.  Most of the stockpile is only depleted after year 15, when the supply of 

feed from the pit reduces.

Processing Schedule Results 

Figure 16.4.6 shows the feed to the processing plant by lithology.  The split of saprolite and 
serpentinite varies of the life.  The limonite contribution is low due to the low recovery.  The acid 

consumption is quite consistent over the mine life at about 1.5 Mt/a.  The vast majority of the feed 

over the life of mine is classified as Inferred Resources (Error! Reference source not found.).

Figure 16.4.8 shows the nickel and cobalt feed grades together with a revenue per tonne of feed 

measure that combines the grade of both elements with price, recovery and payability.  The 
revenue per tonne measure tends to reduce over the mine life, indicating a value maximisation 
strategy, staying about A$175/t feed for the first 11 years before reducing to around A$100/t feed 

by the end of the mine life.

Figure 16.4.9 shows other elements tracked in the schedule.  Notable is change in year 9 to year 
11, when Ca spikes up with a corresponding drop in Fe and Cr due to mining predominately only in 

ARD12 (southern-most pit).

Loading 

The 190-t excavator productivity is estimated at 1,095 t/hr and the 11.4 t capacity FEL at 678 t/hr. 
Snowden notes that there are some periods where just over one excavator is required.  For the 
primary fleet this occurs from years 8 to 12.  During this period, both Ardnaree and Thuddungra are 

being mined, so having two excavators provides some redundancy to manage this.  However, an 
option may be preferred to spread out the dig rate requirement to provide better utilisation of a 
single excavator over time.  Likewise, two FELs are required for the rehandle activity in the last 

couple of years of operation.  It may be preferred to maintain one FEL and spread the duty over 
more time.  The FEL was not considered for makeup primary requirements due to its limited 

breakout force in free-dig material.

Haulage 

Figure 16.5.2 summarises the truck travel times by primary and rehandle activities.  The truck cycle 

times include total cycle (loading, waiting, tipping and return time).  These are averages for each 
year and there is likely more variability in the cycle times within a production month.  Cycle times 
are fairly steady for the primary haulage (between 20 minutes and 30 minutes), but variable for the 

rehandle fleet (from 25 minutes to over one hour) depending on the strip ratio.

Manning 

Figure 16.5.3 summarises the total manning requirements for the project. Manning levels peak at 

120 in year 20 but average between 80 and 120 for most of the mine life.

Fuel 

The operating scenario assumes fuel will be supplied free-of-charge to the contractor.  Fuel cost is 
$1/L delivered and rebated.  An estimate of the contractor fuel requirement is shown in Figure 

16.5.4 and is worked up from equipment hours and estimated fuel burns.   

Figure 16.5.4 Fuel Requirements 

 

Grade Control  

A drill metres and sample schedule for grade control purposes is shown in Figure 16.5.5.  Sample 
requirements peak at just over 20,000 in year 3 which equates to about 400 samples per week. 

Drilling peaks at 70,000 m per year in year 3, or approximately 1,400 m per week. It is likely that 

this schedule could be smoothed in more detailed planning.

16.6 Mining Costs 

16.6.1 Estimating Methodology 

The cost modelling was completed using Microsoft Excel software.  The mining cost estimate is 

supported by: 

 Budget estimates from one mining contractor based on a preliminary schedule supplied. 

 Estimation of haulage profiles for each source and destination over the life of the project. 

The supporting evidence is sufficient such that Snowden is confident that this cost estimate is 

accurate to within ± 25% for the given inputs. 

The costs are inclusive of: 

 Fuel costs. 

 Maintenance costs (inclusive of GET, consumables, tyres, accidental damage). 

 Labour costs (operators, maintenance personnel and mining management, technical and 

administration). 

The mining costs exclude: 

 Closure. 

 Sample assaying.

16.7 Risks and Opportunities 

16.7.1 Risks 

The project, at this early stage, has a number of risks to address: 

 Resource: The mine plan is based primarily on an Inferred resource.  Therefore, the 
confidence in the mine plan will be limited until such time that further drilling has been 

completed. 

 Economics: The project is highly sensitive to technical and economic parameters. 

 Geotechnical: The pits are reasonably shallow, however locally pits can be 60 m deep. 
The lack of geotechnical data collected to date represents a risk to the project.  In 
addition, analysis of trafficability should be considered in the next round of study as it may 

be necessary to construct in-pit haul roads. 

 Hydrogeology: The management of water in the mine will need to be well understood and 

managed. 

 Metallurgy: The current metallurgical recovery and cost assumptions are averaged across 

all rock types and grades. It is likely these will vary. 

16.7.2 Opportunities 

The project also has a number of mining-related opportunities to explore: 

 Mining costs: The current cost model is based on a single contractor quotation. It may be 

possible to source cheaper rates in a competitive situation. 

 Geometallurgy: Through understanding the variability of recovery and cost to the 
lithological and elemental composition within each lithology, it may be possible to 

optimise the schedule to maximise cash flows. 

 Additional leases: The current lease constrains ability to mine resource extensions and 

the location where waste dumps can be located. 

 Closure: There is a significant cost associated with rehandling external waste dumps 
back into the pit voids.  If it was possible to leave external dumps at closure, this would 

save significant funds. 

16.7.3 Further Work  

Snowden recommends the following activities be completed as a priority in any further work 

program to improve confidence in the mine plan: 

 Further resource drilling to improve the confidence in the resource to bring it to Indicated 

Resources classification to support the potential for Ore Reserves.

 Geotechnical drilling and analysis to provide confidence in the slope design, 

excavatability and trafficability. 

 Full water, geochemical and environmental review to identify any considerations for 

further mine planning. 

 Further work to improve confidence in the underlying technical and economic parameters 

of the project. This includes: 

- development of a geometallurgical program with associated modelling. This 
should aim to define metallurgical recoveries and acid requirements for all 

lithologies and by grade range. 

- refinement and additional support for operating costs through sourcing of 
quotations from the market. 

Revision of the mine plan to consider all updated information.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Summary 

The Nico Young Process Plant involves a crushing, agglomerating, stacking and heap leaching 
facility, followed by solution neutralisation and nickel and cobalt recovery via a refinery, consisting 

of solvent extraction, nickel crystallisation and cobalt sulphide precipitation at an ore feed rate of 3 

Mtpa. 

Initially, a blended composite ore was used for the initial engineering (design criteria, mass 
balance, operating costs etc.).  However as testwork results became available, it was recognised 
that individual ore types had differing extraction and acid consumption resulting from column 

leaching testwork, facilitating the need to generate mass balance and operating cost data for each 

ore type. 

Table 17.1.1 provides a summary of the key processing design criteria for the PEA.

The process plant consists of a number of major sections, which have different planned operating 

schedules.  The major sections are: 

 Crushing, agglomeration and stacking. 

 Heap leaching. 

 Solution processing plant. 

 Nickel and Cobalt Refinery. 

 Acid plant and Power Station. 

 Residue Storage Facility (RSF). 

The nickel and cobalt refinery consists of a number of sections: 

 Separation of cobalt and nickel values by solvent extraction. 

 Precipitation of a cobalt sulphide product. 

 Crystallisation of a nickel sulphate product. 

 Packaging of the separate cobalt and nickel products and shipment. 

Major plant infrastructure consists of raw and process water supply systems, storm water handling 

and storage areas for leach residues, iron precipitates, manganese and magnesium precipitates. 

The mass balances for the process were initially prepared using the METSIM simulation software 
package, and subsequently with SysCAD plant simulation software.  The balances incorporated the 

mass flows of metals, hydroxyl and sulphate ions, oxygen, carbon and steam / water.   

Engineering deliverables prepared for the study included process design criteria, mass balances, 

process flow diagrams, mechanical equipment lists and process plant layouts. 

Major reagents used within the process plant include sulphur (for sulphuric acid production), 
limestone, lime and magnesia.  Major plant infrastructure required includes a sulphuric acid plant 

(complete with co-generated steam power plant), rail infrastructure for sulphur delivery, and water 

pipeline infrastructure for raw water supply.

17.2 Introduction 

This section includes a description of the Nico Young Process Plant and the major components of 

the Nico Young facilities.  Detailed descriptions of the process and equipment items are included 

for each process area.   

Further details can be found in the Project Study report, Ref 14, which contains the engineering 
deliverables produced for the study, in particular the Process Design Criteria, Mass Balance, Block 

Flow Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams, Mechanical Equipment List, and Plant Layout.  

17.2.1 Throughput  

The PEA study is based on a total plant ore feed rate of 3 Mtpa. 

17.2.2 Ore Types 

Late in the study, testwork indicated that the main ore types (Limonite, Saprolite and Weathered 
Serpentinite) which had undergone column leaching testing, had significantly different leaching 

extractions, (particularly for nickel, iron and aluminium) and varying acid consumption.  For more 
detail on the leaching testwork results see Section 13.  A summary of the extractions and acid 
consumptions by ore type can be viewed in Table 17.3.1, which contains the key process design 

criteria. 

In order to progress the mine plan, it was deemed necessary to model the individual ore types at 

the 3 Mtpa throughput and produce unique operating costs for each.  The results of these are 

discussed in detail in Section 21. 

17.2.3 Final Product Options 

The PEA is based on the production of high value added products via a Refinery back end, 

involving direct solvent extraction of neutralised PLS from the heap leach, culminating in the 
production of a nickel sulphate solid and cobalt sulphide products.  The refinery back-end was 
largely based on a hybrid circuit utilising a similar processing circuit to the Bulong Nickel laterite 

plant, with some improved changes in the solvent extraction area.  For this report, the refinery 
option was not studied to the same level of detail as the remainder of the process and is only 
represented at a scoping study level of engineering with respect to process design criteria, block 

flow diagram and capital and operating costs.  It is also noted that while the refinery flowsheet is 
based on technically proven unit operations, the integrated refinery is not commercially 
demonstrated on a feed stream that would be processed at Nico Young and consequently there is 

a level of technical and economic risk.  This risk can be minimised in future study phases by 

undertaking appropriate metallurgical and pilot scale test work. 

17.2.4 Process Overview 

For more detailed overview of the processing facility reference should be made to the Overall Block 

Diagrams 3219-000-FF-101 and 3219-000-FF-201 contained in Ref 14.  The following provides a 

general overview of the proposed facility.

17.3.3 Mass Balance 

The mass and energy balances for the process were initially prepared using the METSIM 
simulation software package, and subsequently with the SysCAD plant simulation software.  The 

balances incorporated the mass flows of metals, hydroxyl and sulphate ions, oxygen, carbon and 
steam / water.  The understanding of the process chemistry on which the balance is based is 
described in Section 13 Metallurgical Testwork and incorporated in the unit process models used 

within the METSIM and SysCAD models.     

All flows in the balance, including agglomeration, heap leach and tailings reclamation sections, are 

based on the solution processing plant operating hours.  For design purposes, the balanced flows 

have to be adjusted for the actual plant operating hours for each section of the circuit. 

Engineering deliverables prepared for the study included process design criteria, mass balances, 

process flow diagrams, mechanical equipment lists and process plant layouts. 

17.3.4 Water Balance 

A site-wide water balance has been prepared by Lycopodium. In order to determine the likely 

make‐up water requirements of the HLF a water balance was prepared for the Heap Leach Facility

design at 3 Mtpa by L&MGSPL.  The rainfall in the region is 695 mm per annum (Wombat data 
1888 to 2014 IDCJAC0001 reference: 36067924) and evaporation in the region of 1,160 mm per 
annum from interpretation of climatology data.  The rainfall records indicate that rainfall is relatively 

evenly distributed throughout the year.  

Water inflows to the HLF system consist of rainfall, comprising incident rainfall onto the HLF and 

runoff from the stack, corridors, drains and ponds. Water outflows consist of evaporation from the 
drains and ponds and evapo‐transpiration from stack and liquor returned to the plant.  The 
following information was used for the preparation of the preliminary water balance: 

 Average monthly rainfall figures for Wombat, near Young, which has a long history of 

rainfall records. 

 Rainfall runoff co‐efficient of 0.15 for the HLF area occupied by the stack. 

 Rainfall runoff co‐efficient of 1.0 for other areas (corridors, drains and ponds) of the HLF 
which are lined. 

The total rainfall contribution, based on average rainfall with the relevant co‐efficients applied 
above, is insignificant, averaging less than 0.09% of the total volume of water for the operation.  

The contribution of rainfall to the ongoing operation can therefore effectively be ignored. 

 Annual average evaporation of 1,660 from interpretation of the Climatology Data (1975 to 

2005). 

 Daily evaporation loss of 5% from the top of the stacks. 

 Pan evaporation factor of 0.75 for other areas (corridors, drains and ponds) of the HLF. 

 Seepage losses are assumed to be nil (0). 

 Residual moisture of 30% retained in the stacked ore on the pad of the HLF. 

Under the preliminary assessment approximately 3.1 Mm3/year of make‐up water is required for 
the HLF.   

17.3.5 Mechanical Equipment List 

A mechanical equipment list has been prepared for the 3 Mtpa design throughput.  The list includes 

the estimated operating and installed electrical loads.  Reference should be made to the Project 

Study report, Ref 14 for details. 

17.3.6 Site Layout  

Layout drawings of the heap leach pad, process water ponds and process plant have been 

prepared, and are shown in Ref 14.

17.4 Process Plant Description 

17.4.1 Crushing 

Run-of-Mine (ROM) Ore is delivered to the ROM ore storage pad by mine truck and loaded into the 
ROM Bin by Front End Loader.  Delivery and loading of ore will be the responsibility of the mining 

contractor.   

Due to the expected sticky nature of the ore, no grizzly will be installed over the receival hopper 

and there are no screens in the circuit.  Instead, a single tooth rolled sizer has been selected to 
size the ore.  The sizer will deliver P100 50 mm sized ore to the agglomeration circuit via the 

Crusher Discharge Conveyor and the Agglomerator Feed Conveyor.   

The sizer will be fitted with scrolls capable of rejecting oversize material to an oversize bunker.   

17.4.2 Agglomeration and Stacking 

Crushed ore will be conveyed to an agglomeration drum with a residence time of two minutes.  The 

drum will be double lined, with the inner liner left partially loose in order to shake off sticky ore.   

Sulphuric acid and process water (raffinate) are added as the agglomerating agents.   

The agglomeration circuit includes a spillage tank, to collect slurried spillage from the ore 
preparation areas and dose it at a controlled rate into the agglomeration drum, so as to avoid 

disturbing the agglomeration process.   

The agglomerates will be conveyed to the stacker using a fixed tripper conveyor feeding onto a 

series of grasshopper conveyors and bandwagon conveyor to the radial stacker at the new heap 

leach stacking face.  

The radial stacker, fitted with a stinger conveyor, is capable of stacking over a width of 75 m, to a 

height of 4 m.  The stinger conveyor will be used to stack by layers so as to limit segregation.  

As the heap is built and the stacker retreats, sections of grasshopper conveyors will be removed as 
required.  Thus, over the stacking period of each heap, the variable length conveying system will 

steadily shorten until the stacking of each heap module is complete.  

As each heap is stacked, the irrigation network will be progressively installed and irrigation 
commenced after a curing stage so that the agglomerates are kept moist.  This is essential for 

curing and to prevent cracking and breakdown of the agglomerates, leading to heap percolation 

issues.  

17.4.3 Leaching 

The heap leach system is designed around the concept of leach modules (individual heaps) that 

progress through the process at a fixed time interval of approximately 30 days/step.  The leach 
residence time can be lengthened or shortened by changing the number of modules in process 

(subject to space restrictions), but the time period of 30 days is expected to remain constant.

Two options were considered for construction and operation of the leach modules, viz an On-Off 

Option and a stacked Option: 

 The On/Off Option has a single pad for the HLF with 15 leach cells, three (3) vee‐drains 
(3VD) to the west of HLF and associated ponds to the north of the site.  

 The Stacked Option has a Stage 1 Pad with 15‐leach cells, three (3) vee‐drains (3VD) 
and associated ponds.  The Stage 1 pad will be supplemented with 3 additional pads 
(Stages 2, 3 and 4) with each pad having 15 cells and three (3) vee‐drains (3VD) which 
are connected to the Stage 1 vee‐drains and ponds.  The stacked option is raised placing 
an additional 4 m high lift over each of the Stage 1 to 4 pads.  The first lift comprises 
Stages 5 to 8. An additional 4 m lift comprising Stages 9 to 12 is constructed over Stages 

5 to 8. The final 4 m lift comprising Stages 13 to 16 is constructed over Stages 9 to 12. 

Evaluation of the LOM costs associated with each option indicated that the On-Off option would 

provide the best economic outcome and this option was adopted as the basis for the study. 

The HLF construction will comprise earthworks as shown on the drawings, followed by placement 

of a geotextile and then a synthetic liner, high‐ density polyethylene (HDPE), over the base of the 
leach pad cells, 3VD and ponds.  The liner is designed to recover the leachate from the stack ore 
and minimise the potential for migration of contaminants from the site.  The objectives of the 

preliminary conceptual design of the HLF and RSF were to: 

 Optimise the configuration of the HLF footprint to suit mining and processing 

requirements in a cost‐ effective manner by, as far as possible, balancing the cut to fill 
earthworks to achieve the specified grades for the HLF pads, drains and ponds.   

 Maximise the leachate recovery.  

 Reduce environmental and societal impact. 

Further details of the HLF construction are given in Reference 15. 

The total process then consists of: 

Agglomerated ore that has been stacked into heaps will undergo acidified solution leaching in a 

number or stages.  Solution that has been returned from the process plant (raffinate) will be 
acidified and sent to Heap Leach Stage 3 via an irrigation system.  Drainage from Heap Leach 
Stage 3 will be collected in ILS (Intermediate Liquor Solution) 1 Pond. ILS 1 solution will be 

re‐acidified and sent to Heap Leach Stage 2 via an irrigation system.  Drainage from Heap Leach 
Stage 2 will be collected in ILS 2 Pond. ILS 2 solution will be re‐acidified and sent to Heap Leach 
Stage 1 via an irrigation system.  Drainage from Heap Leach Stage 1 will be collected in the PLS 

Pond.  The spent heap from Stage 3 will be washed with fresh water to retrieve any residual 

product. 

One module will be under reclaim at any time.  As the reclaim system only needs to operate for a 
portion of the total available time, this heap will also be used for drain down time, prior to 

commencing reclamation.

One heap module position will be vacant.  This position will precede the stacking position and 
therefore moves along the pad.  It has two purposes viz provide safe access to the top of the heap 
during stacking, so that irrigation piping can be laid and the agglomerates kept moist and allow for 

repair or replacement of the drainage layer, expected to be required on a regular basis.   

The pad will be sloped both longitudinally and transversely and the drainage system planned to 

ensure all the liquor draining reports to the correct heap module outflow pipe.  The pad location 

arrangement is shown in Figure 17.4.1.  

The construction will comprise earthworks and placement of a liner over the base of the leach pad 
cells, 3VD and ponds.  A synthetic liner, high‐ density polyethylene (HDPE) will be used to recover 
the leachate from the stack ore and minimise the potential for migration of contaminants from the 

site. 

Due to the geochemical characteristics of the leachate from the HLF, a liner is to be installed on the 

base of the HLF, drains and ponds.  The liner to be installed was subject to cost considerations 

(purchase and installation costs) and an HDPE liner was selected. 

The collection ponds are arranged in a cascade, with the PLS pond at the top of the cascade and 

the stormwater pond at the bottom.   

When rain occurs and the drainage rate from the heaps exceeds the capacity of the solution 
treatment plant, the solution ponds will overflow into the stormwater pond.  The cascade 
arrangement will minimise the amount of nickel in the water reporting to this pond.  With heavy 

rainfall, the drainage rate from the heaps will exceed the capacity of the drainage pipes and nickel 

bearing solution will overflow into the stormwater drain and directly to the stormwater pond.   

Solution will be drawn steadily from the stormwater pond and pumped to the barren liquor pond.  
From there, some will enter the process and the rest will be used for the rinse module.  Some of 
this liquor will remain in the ore and report to the leach residue, whilst some will report to the acid 

rinse stage and through to the solution processing plant.  Thus, a small amount of nickel will be lost 
to the leach residue via the stormwater and barren ponds, but a detailed water balance model is 
required to estimate this and it has not been allowed for in the current balance.  The amount will 

vary with the weather.

Four irrigation headers will run along the lengh of the leach pad, with offtakes to each heap 
module.  The irrigation system for the module will be connected to the appropriate header for the 
stage of the process.  Three of the headers will be fed from leach solution ponds with the fourth fed 

from flush water pond.  

Individual in-line mixers have been allowed for each heap module, to enable the acid addition rate 

to be varied for heaps at different stages of leaching.  This provides an additional means of 
optimising acid consumption, particularly for the weak acid leach.  Other approaches could be used 

and no comparative economic analysis of the alternatives has been completed.  

Allowance has been made for the addition of SMBS into the ILS leach system to generate 

necessary conditions to maximise cobalt recovery. 

17.4.4 Residue Storage Facility, RFS 

The RSF is to be constructed using borrow materials sourced from the RSF impoundment.  The 
initial construction will comprise the lined internal footprint and a containment embankment, due to 
the potentially acid forming (PAF) nature of the residues.  A synthetic liner, HDPE will be used to 

reduce the potential for migration of contaminants from the site.  A drawing for the RSF which has 

been prepared for the 3.0 Mtpa, 22-year LOM operation can be found in Ref 15. 

Embankment construction is to be undertaken using compacted clayey materials, sourced from 
within the RSF impoundment area.  The design concept includes a liner within the basin, where the 
main embankment at the northwestern end of the valley and ridges abutting the embankment form 

the 'encapsulated' storage area.  The proposed future embankment raises are to be executed by 
downstream construction techniques using borrow materials sourced from within the impoundment 
area.  As the materials are removed for embankment construction, the basal liner is placed. 

Contour drains to be constructed as part of the earthworks for each embankment raising will be 

required to divert rainfall runoff from the area upstream of the RSF into the adjacent valleys. 

Supernatant water will be recovered by a pump arrangement which can be placed into the valley 
and raised with the increasing residue and water level.  The collected water is to be returned to the 
process plant for re‐use.  The primary method of water recovery is pumping or decanting from the 
supernatant pond formed on the surface of the tailings. 

17.4.5 Recycle Leach 

The Recycle Leach step consists of two agitated tanks.  Recycled slurries from the Iron Removal 
Stage 2 thickener underflow and MHP Stage 2 thickener underflow circuits are treated with a 

portion of the PLS from the heap leaching circuit, essentially utilising the residual sulphuric acid in 
the PLS to redissolve any precipitated nickel and cobalt, before entering the Iron Removal Stage 1 

step. 

The Recycle leach is operated at 30°C.  Overall residence time is two hours.  The discharge slurry 

reports to Iran Removal Stage 1, along with the remaining PLS.

17.4.6 Iron Removal 

Iron Removal Stage 1 

Pregnant liquor solution is pumped from the PLS pond to the first stage of Iron Removal.   

The precipitation of iron (along with the majority of aluminium) takes place at a temperature of 70°C 
in a train of six stirred reactors.  Limestone is used to neutralise excess acidity and precipitate 
mainly gypsum, ferric hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide.  The incoming PLS is contacted with 

steam to raise its temperature and then enters the first tank.  Limestone slurry is dosed into the first 
three tanks, so as to incrementally raise the pH down the train of tanks.  Incremental addition is 
used as it is expected to produce a more crystalline precipitate and improve the dewatering 

properties.  The final pH is expected to be about 3.5, but depends on the solution composition and 

is dictated by the residual iron concentration and nickel losses. 

The reaction with limestone results in the formation of carbon dioxide, so the tanks have 2 m 
freeboard to provide for the foam that forms.  The freeboard also allows for situations where gas 

hold-up or viscosity in the tanks increases. 

The tanks require covering, both to reduce heat losses by evaporation from the liquor surface and 
to protect operators and equipment from acidic and nickel bearing aerosols.  Each tank is fitted with 

a vent that discharges well clear of operator head height.   

Provision is made to recycle 300% of new feed from the thickened tank discharge to the tank feed, 

to provide seed for the precipitates to grow.  Overall residence time is four hours, utilising 6 tanks. 

Iron Removal Stage 1 Thickening 

The discharge slurry reports to the high rate Iron Removal Stage 1 Thickener, where the slurry is 
thickened to an underflow density of 45%w/w, prior to vacuum belt filtration.  Flocculant is added to 

aid in solids settling.  

Iron Removal Stage 1 Filtration 

The Thickener underflow is pumped to a filter feed tank and then separated from the pregnant 
leach liquor by vacuum belt filtration.  The poor filtration characteristics of the iron residue result in 

a large filtration area requirement.  At least 3 stages of washing are required to achieve a wash 
efficiency of greater than 80%.  The iron precipitate filtration section includes provision to adjust the 

pH of the filter wash water, to minimise re-dissolution of the iron precipitate.   

Iron Removal Stage 2 

In this stage further iron and aluminium are removed from solution by raising the pH to 4.5 with 

limestone slurry at a temperature of 62°C.

Iron Removal Stage 2 Thickening 

Precipitated iron slurry from the Stage 2 iron removal step is thickened in a high rate thickener to 

produce a thickener underflow of 45% w/w solids.  The thickener underflow is recycled to recycle 

leach ahead of the Iron Removal Stage 1 step. 

17.4.7 Nickel and Cobalt Products Refinery 

At the present stage of development of the Nico Young project, no laboratory test work has been 

performed for the refinery step to develop process design criteria, prepare flowsheets or perform 
equipment sizing, so that this portion of the flowsheet has been included at a concept/scoping 
study level only.  While the refinery flowsheet is based on technically proven unit operations, the 

integrated refinery is not commercially demonstrated on a feed stream that would be processed at 
Nico Young and consequently there is a level of technical and economic risk.  This risk can be 

minimised in future study phases by undertaking appropriate metallurgical and pilot scale test work. 

The following gives a general description of the likely processing steps that would be involved in 

the refinery stage. 

Neutralised PLS from the Iron Removal Stage 2 is treated in a solvent extraction step to separate 
dissolved nickel and cobalt from the PLS by loading into an organic using Versatic 10 extractant.  

The stripped organic used in the extraction stage is pre-loaded with magnesium (via magnesia).  
The raffinate from this solvent extraction step undergoes a Versatic recovery stage, then flows to 
manganese precipitation and then magnesium precipitation before being returned to the heap 

leach circuit. 

The nickel and cobalt loaded organic is then washed using dilute nickel weak electrolyte, followed 

by stripping using spent nickel electrolyte from the nickel crystallisation circuit.  The stripped 
organic reports back to the magnesium preload circuit, whilst the nickel advance electrolyte enters 
the Cyanex 272 solvent extraction circuit in order to remove any co-extracted metals, 

predominantly cobalt and zinc.  Raffinate from this extraction stage reports to the nickel 
crystallisation circuit, where it is treated in a cooling crystalliser to produce a slurry of nickel 
sulphate crystals.  The crystals are separated from the mother liquor in a centrifuge, filtered, dried 

and packaged as high purity nickel sulphate product.   

The loaded Cyanex 272 organic is stripped using an acidic solution returning from the cobalt 

sulphide precipitation circuit.  Cobalt is precipitated from the strip solution with sodium 

hydrosulphide, filtered and packaged for sale as cobalt sulphide. 

17.4.8 Manganese and Magnesium Removal 

Raffinate from the refinery is treated in a series of six agitated, air sparged tanks with hydrated lime 

slurry to raise the pH to 9.0 and precipitate a mixed manganese-magnesium residue from solution.  
Precipitated solids are then thickened in a high rate thickener to produce a thickener underflow of 

30% w/w solids.

Thickener underflow is pumped to a filter feed tank and then separated from the slurry liquor by 
filtration in a horizontal plate and frame filters to produce a 60% w/w solids filter cake.  The filter 

cake is transported by truck for disposal in the RSF. 

The thickener overflow reports to the process water tank.  The majority of the process water is 

recycled back to the heap leach and re-acidified to become raffinate for leaching. 

17.5 Reagents 

17.5.1 Limestone 

Limestone is used to neutralise excess acid and precipitate iron and aluminium, in the iron 

precipitation circuits.   

A stockpile capacity of 10 days limestone has been allowed at site, to cater for interruptions to 

supply, particularly from heavy rain which can cut off road access.   

The stockpile consists of the dump pad, which will be managed using a front end loader (FEL).  

From the bin, the limestone will be fed by conveyor to a ball mill and hydrocyclone circuit, with a 

design product size of 80% passing 75 μm.   

The ground limestone slurry is stored in a 1000 m3 agitated tank, with 6 hours' storage capacity at 

normal feed rates.   

The circuit has a capacity 20% above the expected average rate of limestone consumption, to 
ensure that periods of higher demand can be catered for.  The storage tank allows the mill to be 
shut down for a portion of each day, when demand is less than maximum capacity.  It also allows 

for routine mill maintenance to be carried out whilst continuing solution process plant operations.   

The limestone slurry is circulated around the plant using a ring-main, from which dosing 

requirement are drawn. 

17.5.2 Flocculant 

No testwork is available to date to determine the required flocculant types.  For the purpose of the 
study it has been assumed that three different flocculant types will be used, based on the 

requirement for acidic and alkaline slurry thickening, along with flocculant for filtration conditioning, 

so three separate flocculant mixing plants have been provided for.     

17.5.3 SMBS 

SMBS (Sodium Metabisulphite) is added as a 20% solution into the ILS pumping system of the 

Heap Leach. It is added as a reductant to maximise the extraction of cobalt.  The addition rate has 

been set at 2 tonnes of SMBS per tonne of cobalt leached. 

The SMBS system consists of a hopper with bag splitter, mixing and transfer, and storage tank with 

dosing pumps.

17.5.4 Magnesia 

Magnesia will be delivered in bulk, via road trains with ISO containers (approx. 44 t).  It will be 

unloaded pneumatically into a storage silo.  On average, one delivery every day will be required for 

the MHP circuit, or two deliveries per day for the Refinery option.   

Magnesia is used as neutralising and buffering agent within the solvent extraction section of the 

Refinery circuit. 

On average, two deliveries daily will be required for the Refinery circuit.  The main silo provides 
storage for 15 days supply, and pneumatically feeds a surge bin mounted above the magnesia 
reagent mixing tank.  In the mixing tank magnesia is reacted with sulphuric acid to produce a 

magnesium sulphate reagent solution which is pumped to the products refinery. 

17.5.5 Sulphur Storage and Loading 

The acid plant will be designed to supply 4,400 tpd of acid and will require 1,437 tpd of sulphur at 

design production rate.   

Sulphur is expected to be purchased out of Vancouver and shipped in up to 50,000 t capacity 
Handymax vessels.  Once landed, the sulphur will be loaded onto rail stock and trained to site 

utilising existing lines and a new rail spur close to site.  

Sulphur will be stockpiled at site in an uncovered low profile pile, managed by front end loader.  

The stockpile capacity will be 15,000 t, to provide for 10 days storage.     

Sulphur will be transferred to a sulphur reclaim bin, with capacity 300 t, allowing sulphur to be 

loaded twice per day.  The sulphur melting plant has been sized to operate 18 h/day, seven 

days/week.   

17.5.6 Acid and Power Plant 

The acid and power plants are a vendor package and so are not described here.   

The design is based on Chinese supplied technology via ARC-Vanture JV.  The acid plant is a 
large capacity plant by Chinese standards, and consequently the adoption of this technology, for a 

plant to be built in Australia represents a higher level of commercial risk than would otherwise apply 
to conventional western options.  Western suppliers offer plants that differ in design, but are 

otherwise similar in terms of their interaction with the rest of the site.   

The acid plant will be designed to produce up to 4,400 tpd of acid, with a turn-down capability to 

30% of maximum production.   

The acid plant will produce 210 t/h of high pressure steam.  A portion of this steam will provide the 
process steam demand while the remainder will be passed through condensing turbo-generator 

(TG) to generate power.  The turbo-generator will supply all of the project electrical power 
requirement.  The plant design allows for a supplementary diesel fired power station to provide the 

sulphuric acid start-up (black start) power requirement of 14 MW.

The acid plant requires a number of reagents.  These are detailed in the design criteria and in the 
acid plant vendor proposals.  One reagent required is hydrated lime, at an expected rate of 7 kg/h.  
This lime is used for neutralising acidity formed by oxidation of sulphur during storage and must be 

added dry.  Dry hydrated lime will therefore be purchased for this purpose.  

17.5.7 Sulphuric Acid Storage 

A substantial acid storage facility is required, to cater for short term variations in demand, provide 

for controlled start-up and shut-down of the acid plant and avoid frequent starts and stops.   

Two tanks have been specified, holding 19,400 t of acid, which is 4 days supply at an acid 

consumption of 550 kg/t ore.   

17.5.8 Start-Up Steam Boiler 

A steam boiler (capacity of 115 tph of 3.5 Bar steam) will be required on an intermittent basis, at 
least during the extended commissioning period, to supply steam for process heating, and for start-

up of the acid plant after routine shutdowns.   

The boiler will be required since it will take several months to ramp the plant up to full production.  It 
is likely that the solution processing plant will quite quickly achieve the ability to operate at full flow 

rate and reasonable metallurgical efficiency.  However, it will take much longer to achieve the 
planned utilisation rate.  During this period, the acid plant will be operated at down to the minimum 
production rate (maximum turndown) and may not produce sufficient steam for process heating.  

Once the acid tanks are nearly full, the acid plant must be shut down in a controlled way, in order to 
avoid corrosion damage to the plant.  Restarting the acid plant takes about 36 hours to pre-heat 
and commence sulphur burning.  Thus, it will be impossible to match the process plant's steam 

requirements on an hourly or daily basis, until all plant is operating at full capacity and close to 

planned utilisation.  

Maximum use will be made of the acid plant steam, but it will be essential to have the capability to 
provide process steam when the acid plant cannot.  The estimates allow for a suitable boiler 
package to be leased for the ramp-up phase of operations.  Beyond this phase, the black start 

steam requirement will only be required following plant turn-around shutdowns. 

17.5.9 Lime Plant 

Lime is required to precipitate both manganese and magnesium from solution, to control 

concentrations to below saturation level.   

The expected consumption rate of lime (as commercial quicklime) is 34 tph, supplied from Phoenix 

Lime Pty Ltd.  The annual usage rate would be 282,000 tonnes.   

Lime would be delivered in Isotainers by double road train, with 44 t per delivery.  An average of 

19 deliveries would be required each day, seven days a week.   

Due to the quantities involved and the requirement to store in silos, on-site storage capacity has 

been limited to 5 days, requiring 4,000 m3 of silo volume.

The lime slaking plant would be a vendor supplied package, typically either a Metso Vertimill or a 
Transmin slaking plant.  The flowsheet shows a Vertimill.  If a Vertimill is selected, it would require 

use of the next size larger than is currently shown in Metso's catalogue for lime slaking. 

The lime slaking plant design capacity is 20% above the expected operating consumption rate, to 

allow for variations in ore type or processing rate.   

The slaked lime storage tank has 4 hours capacity, which will allow for minor mill maintenance and 

shutting down the mill when demand is less than capacity.  

17.5.10 Other Services 

Provision has been made for supply of high and low pressure process and raw water as well as 

compressed air.  The raw water supply system is discussed in Section 18. 

17.5.11 Control and Instrumentation 

The control philosophy and instrumentation will be typical for a plant of this type and have not been 

considered in detail for this report. 

Provision has been made for an on-belt Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analyser together with 

a moisture analyser, to measure the ore grade and moisture content of the ore feed to the 
agglomerator.  This analyser will be capable of measuring nickel, iron, magnesium, manganese 

and aluminium in the ore and will therefore provide information for: 

 Control of the agglomerator. 

 Modifying the mine plan to ensure that the acid demand of the ore on the heap leach 

pads is kept within supply limits overall. 

 Modifying the mine plan to avoid overloading any section of the plant, for example 

through processing high leachable iron content ore.   

 Assessing leach recovery. 

 Comparing with reserve estimates. 

Within the process plant, provision has been made for an on-stream XRF analyser, capable of 
analysing seven liquor streams.  This analyser will be used to control the solution process plant, 

including control of the operating pH levels in the precipitation stages.   

A weightometer is also provided on the agglomerator feed.  Slurry density and flowrate 

measurements would be made on all process streams of major interest.   

17.6 Further Work 

To date, testwork for the Nico Young project has focussed primarily on bench scale and column 
leaching testwork to provide extractions, acid consumption and scale up data for the heap leach

circuit. Preliminary iron removal and MHP precipitation work was conducted at a sighter test level. 
Going forward, a more comprehensive testwork programme must be undertaken to provide a 
greater understanding of the process plant parameters and to provide more confidence in the 

design criteria used for mass balancing and equipment sizing.  

Once laboratory results for the products refinery process have been obtained, a further phase 

engineering design for the refinery process needs to be undertaken to bring the capital and 

operating cost estimates up to the same level of confidence as the remainder of the process.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Summary 

A preliminary layout for the mine and process plant surface facilities has been prepared.  The 
layout of facilities has been prepared to take advantage of existing topographical features to the 

extent possible.  At the 3 Mtpa scale of capacity, this has resulted in plant infrastructure being 

located outside the current exploration lease boundary. 

The surface layout will cut across existing roads and tracks, some of which will still be required to 
service operations/properties not associated with the Nico Young Project, in particular Mines Road 
and Ballards Road.  Consideration will need to be given to diverting these roads as part of the 

project development. 

Some major infrastructure has not yet been sufficiently defined to be shown located on the layout 

including the raw water pipeline, railway spur route, construction camp, electrical transmission lines 

(if applicable) and onsite supplementary power station. 

A financial assessment based on a PEA study level estimate of capital and operating costs has 

been provided for a range of options covering: 

 Import into various Ports (Newcastle, Port Kembla and Port of Melbourne). 

 Bulk sulphur Vs bulk sulphuric acid transport. 

 Road Vs Rail transport from Port to Mine, considering also the sub option of 

establishment of an intermodal terminal adjacent to the existing rail mainline. 

 Annual production rates ranging from 1 Mtpa ROM mining rate to 3 Mtpa ROM mining 

rate. 

Ports Import of reagents into each of the three Ports is considered feasible, with each Port showing 
interest in the potential operation.  The advantages and disadvantages of each Port have been 

summarised in relation to their ability to support both sulphur and sulphuric acid import and 

dispatch. 

There are a number of options available to provide electric power to the project including: 

 Connection to the local electrical grid.  

 Onsite generation by cogeneration of power with steam produced in the sulphuric acid 

plant. 

 Onsite generation of power in a diesel, natural gas or fuel oil fired power station with 

supplementary renewables generation. 

 A hybrid mixture of all or some of the above.

The PEA compared the options of grid connection and onsite generation by cogeneration from 
steam produced by the acid plant.  The acid plant will be operated to generate the required plant 
electrical demand at all times by either producing excess acid into storage on ore types with lower 

acid demand or withdrawing acid from storage when processing ore types with higher acid 
demand.  The capacity for bulk acid storage will need to be selected to ensure this is possible 
when a detailed mine schedule becomes available in later project phases.  For the present level of 

study acid, storage capacity is considered to be adequate based on annual mine schedules. 

As shown in the following table, an economic evaluation conducted by Lycopodium Minerals 

demonstrated conclusively that onsite generation from the acid plant with supplementary power 

supply when required is the preferred option.

The Nico Young Project has a requirement for a significant volume of water supply.  The project is 
located in a high value, currently intensively worked, agricultural region.  The water supply for 

agricultural activity is drawn from rainfall, stored rainfall, and groundwater.  The groundwater 
sources in the immediate region are typically fresh to brackish in quality and the subject of current 
licence allocation with modest headroom allowance in total prescribed allocation allowance.  The 

fact that the groundwater in the immediate region is fresh to brackish in quality means that there is 
strong competition for allocated rights to use it and that the allocated rights are closely held and 
controlled.  The required volumes meant that unregulated water sources were excluded.  The 

project supply requirement is 3100Ml/annum. 

Residue storage options considered for this project comprise: 

 An integrated waste landform (IWL), where the RSF is lined and located within a mine 

waste dump.   

 In-pit tailings storage.   

 A standalone valley RSF. 

Neither Option 1 or 2 was considered feasible, as waste being generated from the mining activities 
is being used to backfill pits.  The valley style RSF has an ultimate embankment height of 
approximately 46.5 m.

18.2 Surface Layout 

The Nico Young Project lies approximately 30 km west-northwest of the town of Young, NSW in an 

established mining and farming region of central west NSW, Australia, around 300 km due west of 
the Wollongong and Sydney ports.  The main geographic feature, Trig Station 3056 Memagong 

Hill, Tubbul, is located at 595692.718mE 6213446.37mN. 

All the lands, including the surface and land below, with the exception of certain areas within the 
licences covered by the Consolidated Mining Lease 15 (Act 1992) by Young Mining Company 

Proprietary Limited are available for exploration subject to access arrangements being obtained 
with the landholder.  The Thuddungra Mine is an intermittent producer of magnesite and a part of 

Causmag International, a subsidiary of Orind Australia Pty Ltd. 

There is no known native title, national parks, cultural or state heritage areas in the licence areas. 

A number of factors will impact on the physical development of the project, as a result of its location 

including: 

 Noise and air quality: The proximity of surrounding residences will mean that noise and 

air quality impacts may be a constraint on the development. 

 Soils and agricultural land: The ELs include Biophysical Strategic Agricultural Land 
(BSAL). Mining projects that disturb BSAL require additional approvals and detailed 

studies and management measures will be required. 

 Traffic: Upgrades to the surrounding road and rail network will be required. 

The prospect is located approximately 25 km NW to W of the Young township NSW, situated 
between the Bribbaree and Tubbul roads.  The topography consists of flat plains between low 
rolling hills.  A line of hills forms a low ridge along the western boundary of the project, particularly 

in the central southern section of the prospect with the highest hills Bald Hill, Stoney Hill, and 

Memagong Hill. 

The main deposit of Ardnaree is immediately east of Memagong Hill which can be accessed by 

vehicle along sealed and dirt roads/tracks as follows: 

Via the paved Henry Lawson Way (9 km); turn left onto paved Bribbaree Road (14.6 km); turn left 
onto paved Mines Road (5 km); turn left onto Astons Lane (6.9 km); turn right onto farm tracks (2.3 

km).  Total distance of 38 km (38 minutes). 

Alternatively, via the paved Milvale Road and Tubbul Road to Kurrawyba Road in Tubbul (33 km); 

continue on Kurrawya Road and Coddingtons Lane (9.7 km).  Total distance of 43 km (41 minutes). 

Unsealed roads, Astons Lane and Ballards Road, provide access from south to north, essentially 

parallel to the overall strike of the Young deposits. 

There is year-round access along the local gazetted roads. Access along farm tracks may be 

difficult in wet weather.

The overall layout of the mine and associated waste dumps, haul roads, heap leach facility and 
ponds, process plant layout and associated infrastructure including residue storage facility is shown 
in Figure 18.2.1.  This figure provides only a general guide to the location of major mine and plant 

items. Significant infrastructure that will be required, but which has not yet been sufficiently defined 

to be located on the drawing include: 

 Raw water pipeline and associated easement route. 

 Rail spur to connect the site to the existing rail infrastructure. 

 Construction camp and associate facilities. 

 Electrical grid connection and transmission routing (if this becomes an option). 

 Onsite supplementary power station location and fuel storage facilities and or natural gas 

connection (if this becomes an option). 

The topography at the project location is dominated by a north south trending ridge to the west. 

The ridge line to the east, which is much lower, has a north, northeast/south, southwest trend.  The 
main drainage in the northern section of the tenement is Duckhole Creek, flowing to the north and 
ultimately to the west, around the northern end of the western ridge, to join Middle Station Creek. 

There is a drainage divide in the southern end of the tenements. 

In developing the layout for the 3 Mtpa throughput case, the following approach was taken: 

 It was assumed that the area for the facilities could be expanded to fit within the existing 

contour data.  Tenement boundaries were not considered as a constraint. 

 The RSF was shaped such that it fitted within the topographic setting.  In other words, the 

RSF was placed in a valley type and this was the only location that was considered. 

The infrastructure has been laid out to take advantage of the topography with the HLF following the 
natural ground surface slope to the north.  The RSF was located to take advantage of a valley on 

the eastern site of the site. 

The overall layout currently shows that the leach pads and process plant and infrastructure, 

including the RSF, extend beyond the current lease boundaries.  However, at present the indicated 
features represent the likely required plot areas and further work is required to optimise selected 
locations for the plant.  Tenements and land that remain outside the current ELs, after layout 

optimisation, would have to be acquired to support the implementation of the 3.0 Mtpa throughput 

capacity. 

Inspection of Figure 18.2.1 shows that the ultimate development will cut across a number of local 
roads and access tracks.  In particular Mines Road, and Ballards Road will be cut by the 
development and as these service properties outside of the lease, alternative routes will need to 

installed as part of project development.

Mines Road will probably become the main access road into the plant site, and this will need to be 
upgraded to accommodate the significantly increased freight traffic into the site.  The scale of the 
development will also require that Bribbaree road is upgraded, and bypass diversions around the 

township of Young may also need to be provided as part of the project.

18.3 Supply Transport and Logistics 

Lycopodium Infrastructure Pty Ltd were retained to conduct a Supply Transport and Logistics study 

(reference 16). Key findings of the study are presented below.  The findings presented assume the 
high Net Present Cost for sulphuric acid transport cannot be offset through a reduction in process 

costs at the mine, to the extent that acid transport becomes competitive against sulphur transport.  

18.3.1 Ports 

Possible Ports for import are Port Kembla, Newcastle and Melbourne. Import of reagents into each 
of the three Ports is considered feasible, with each Port showing interest in the potential operation. 
The advantages and disadvantages of each Port have been summarised in relation to their ability 

to support both sulphur and sulphuric acid import and dispatch.  The advantages and 

disadvantages of each Port are summarised in Tables 18.3.1 and 18.3.2:

18.3.2 Transport Mode 

Transport by road and or rail is feasible from each Port to either an intermodal terminal within 
proximity of Nico Young or directly to the Nico Young mine site.  Based on the financial analysis, 

Road transport is the most cost effective option for transporting reagents at the 1 Mtpa ROM ore 

mining rate, whilst rail transportation is more economical at the 3 Mtpa ROM ore mining rate; 

Intermodal Terminal vs Rail Spur 

It is possible to establish an Intermodal Terminal at Cootamundra (or another location on the Main 

South rail line) for the transfer of bulk sulphur from rail to road, however the financial analysis 
indicates that the construction of a spur line off the ARTC Parkes to Stockinbingal line and rail 
transport from Port directly to site is the most economical method of transport for the higher mining 

rate considering the life of mining; 

Bulk Sulphur v Sulphuric Acid  

The financial assessment of options has provided a broad range of costs, which have been 
assessed on a Net Present Cost (NPC) basis for the various scenarios considered.  Based on the 

significant difference in Net Present Cost between bulk sulphur transport and sulphuric acid 
transport (approx. $300m @ 1 Mtpa, and approx. $800m @ 3 Mtpa) the transport of sulphuric acid is 

not recommended.  

18.3.3 Preferred Transport Routes 

The following are the preferred transport routes based on the financial assessment and considering 

the advantages and disadvantages of each route option:

ramping up tonnage over time) 
then Port Kembla would be the 
logical location to base Import 
for short and long term 
operations. 

 

18.3.4 Financial Analysis of Transport Options 

Capex and Opex for each option have been estimated using a range of pricing techniques.  Where 

possible, modelled pricing has been calibrated against recent industry benchmarks and budget 
pricing provided by Port owners and transport operators.  The Net Present Cost (NPC) of each 
transport option has been assessed against the lower mining rate of 1mtpa (ROM ore) and the 

upper mining rate of 3 mtpa (ROM ore) in order to comparatively assess the options.  The NPC for 
each option is presented below, expressed as the total NPC over the life of the operation as well as 

the $/product tonne.

18.4 Electric Power 

There are a number of options available to provide electric power to the project including: 

 Connection to the local electrical grid. 

 Onsite generation by cogeneration of power with steam produced in the sulphuric acid 

plant.  

 Onsite generation of power in a diesel, natural gas or fuel oil fired power station with 

supplementary renewables generation. 

 A hybrid mixture of all or some of the above. 

Lycopodium have completed a trade-off study for the supply of electrical power to the Project.  

Options investigated are the purchase of grid power, and the generation of power on site utilising 

the waste heat from the acid plant. 

An early study phase trade-off study (Ref. 14) was completed to compare options for the supply of 
sulphuric acid to the project.  Options investigated were the purchase of acid from an external 
party, and the generation of acid via an on-site acid plant by the combustion of imported sulphur.  

The preferred option from this study was the generation of acid via an on-site acid plant. 

Based on the developed mechanical equipment list and identified electrical loads for the study the 

total plant electrical load will 281,415,000 kWh/y. the breakdown of this electrical load demand is 

shown in Table 18.4.1 below.

The table shows that the total required installed power will be 47 MW, with an operating demand of 

34.6 MW. 

18.4.1 Grid Supply Option 

Electric power is distributed locally be Essential Energy via an 11 kV distribution network.  A 
Transgrid 132 / 66 KV substation is located at Murrumburrah, south of Young, and 66 KV is 
supplied to the Essential Energy 66 / 11 KV substation at Young.  This substation has a capacity of 

36 MVA and currently supplies 15.5 - 16.3 MVA (according to Essential Energy publicly available 
information).  The substation is located at the intersection of Chilling works Rd and Milvale Rd, 
approximately 23 km from the plant site.  The extent to which this substation would require 

upgrading was not investigated as part of the study.

Figure 18.4.1 Essential Energy 66 to 11 kV Substation, Young 

 

Based on preliminary discussions with Essential Energy, a capital allowance of $ 7.5 million has 
been allowed for connection to the grid for the 3 Mtpa throughput.  An average variable supply cost 

for grid power of AUD13 c/kWh and fixed cost of AUD7,400 per month has also been assumed. 

For the 100% grid power supply option, any excess heat from the on-site acid plant that is not used 

in the process would be wasted. 

18.4.2 Onsite Generation Option 

The preference for an on-site acid plant has been established in trade-off study  
(Ref. 14).  The acid plant would be designed to produce 4400 tpd of sulphuric acid via the melting 

of imported sulphur.  Actual acid demand depends on the ore type being processed (Limonite, 

Saprolite, Serpentinite), but average annual acid demand is expected to be 3893 tpd. 

The production of sulphuric acid from the melting of sulphur is an exothermic reaction producing 
significant quantities of heat.  This heat can be recovered to produce steam, some of which can be 
utilised in the process, whilst the remainder can be used to produce electricity via a steam turbine 

generator.  

 Major acid demand is required for leaching the ore sent to the heap leach pads.  As the different 

ore types have different acid requirements for leaching, the amount of acid required will vary, 
depending upon the ore blend being processed.  For ores blends high in saprolite the acid demand 
will exceed the average capacity of the acid plant, and supplementary acid will be withdrawn from 

storage.  For ore blends high in limonite the acid plant will have excess capacity and the excess 

acid produced will be sent to storage.

The acid plant will be operated to produce the required electric power demand at all times, with 
excess or deficient acid production balanced by acid storage capacity.  In future project phases, 
when a more detailed mine plan is available, an assessment of the required bulk acid storage 

capacity will need to be made to ensure that there will always be sufficient storage capacity. 

As the availability of raw water to the Young site is strictly limited, the cooling and steam 

condensation requirements of both the acid plant and the associated power plant have been based 

on air cooling rather than the more conventional water cooling via an evaporative cooling tower. 

18.4.3 Evaluation Grid Supply vs Onsite Generation Option 

For the trade-off study (Ref. 14), a 15 year operating period was assumed.  Capital costs are 

committed in Years -2 and -1.  Operation commences in Year 0 at 50% of nameplate and 
continues at 100% of nameplate in Years 1 to 15 inclusive.  No revenue stream has been included 
in the analysis, as it will be the same for both options.  Accordingly, the preferred commercial 

option is the option with the least negative NPV. No inflation has been incorporated into the model 
and no consideration has been given to tax or depreciation for this simplified comparison.  Three 

separate discount rates (5%, 8%, and 10%) have been applied. 

A commercial summary of the options (pre-tax basis), based on the first 15 years of operation is 

provided in Table 18.4.2 below. 

Table 18.4.2 Commercial Summary 

 Grid Power 
On-Site 

Generation 

Capital Cost (AUDM) 7.5 65.6 

Mature Operating Cost (AUDM p.a) 37 2.8 

Relative NPV (AUDM) @ 5% Discount Rate 0 319 

Relative NPV (AUDM) @ 8% Discount Rate 0 236 

Relative NPV (AUDM) @ 10% Discount Rate 0 195 

 

The on-site power generation option has a clear commercial advantage over the grid power option. 

In terms of sensitivities, to achieve equal NPVs for the two options would require: 

A reduction in grid power variable cost from AUD13 c/kWh to AUD 2 - 3 c/kWh. 

The economic analysis indicates a clear preference for on-site power generation over 100% grid 

power supply, provided that there is an on-site acid plant. 

It is still required to have a supplementary supply of power and steam to provide the black start and 
emergency generation requirements for the acid plant and process.  The study has allowed for the 

installation of a 14 MW BOO power station to provide the black start requirement, and has 
assumed that a skid mounted packaged boiler would be leased on an as required basis to provide 
the black start steam requirement.  It was thus recommended that on-site power generation be 

adopted as the base case for the PEA.

18.5 Water Supply 

The selection of a suitable water source was based on the ability to supply from 3000ML to 

5500ML annually.  The higher end was revised back from 9000ML during the course of the project. 
The required volumes, even at the lower end of the range, ruled out unregulated river sources and 
even stretched the resources of the regulated system. (Unregulated systems are water sources, 

which run on natural rain events and are not supported by storage dams.  Regulated systems are 

controlled and supported by state owned storage dams.) 

The regulated systems will have two Water Access Licence (WAL) categories, which will be of 
interest; these are High Security and General Security.  Temporary Trading is the purchasing or 
selling of available water at anytime to supplement a WAL allocation.  Both WAL categories can 

temporary trade allocation water during a water year.  The mine will predominantly require (if not 

all) High Security licences to ensure the most reliable supply for a continuous operation. 

18.5.1 Licencing – Works Approval / Water Access Licence (WAL) 

A water supply work approval authorises its holder to construct and use a specified water supply 

work at a specified location.  These are usually applied for through Water NSW but due to the mine 

being of State Significance it would be exempt from this application.  

The Works Approval would be covered in the Development Application.  Water licences are 

referred to as WAL's. There are three ways of acquiring a WAL as follows: 

 Purchasing part of a WAL involves a 71Q application to Water NSW for assessment.  The 
time frame for completion of an application varies greatly but an allowance of 3 to 4 

months would be realistic.  The application cost is $355.91 per application. 

 Buying an existing WAL outright through a 71M application.  This involves the change of 
the entire title to the purchaser.  The body that handles these applications is the NSW 

Land Register Service.  Completion times are usually within two months of application. 

Cost is $141.60 per application. 

 Undertaking a lease arrangement.  An option would be to enter into a long-term lease 

with a Water Fund company, sometimes with an option to buy. 

18.5.2 Water Options 

18.5.3 Local Unregulated River & Ground Water 

The main unregulated source is the Burrangong Creek.  It was eliminated from further investigation 
as it only has 53 Licences and a total of 2537.5ML available under licence.  The groundwater in the 

local area is the Young Granite Ground Water Source.  It was deemed unsuitable due to the low 
yielding nature of the water source and the small number of licences and volume held.  The source 
has 149 Licences and a total of 6354 ML of allocation.  The main users are high value Orchards, 

predominantly cherry orchards.  The cherry orchards are also a main source of town wealth and 

provides tourism appeal.

The outlying ground water will fall in the Lachlan Fold Belt.  The zone is in the fractured rocks and 
is notorious for low yields.  One of the study target areas was the Murrumbidgee River.  The 
alluviums on the Murrumbidgee appear to be located more down stream past Wagga Wagga, 

which is too far out of the search area.  On the Map below the distribution of current bore 

development can be seen. The nearest point for access to Young would be the town of Jugiong. 

Figure 18.5.1 Murrumbidgee Target Area 

 

          Date 2017 

18.5.4 Lachlan River 

The Lachlan River is a regulated river, which is supplied from Wyangala Dam.  The Lachlan River 
currently has 189 High Security licence holders with a total of 27,680.1ML under licence.  The 

General Security category has 821 licence holders and a total of 592,801.42ML under licence. 

The High security is tightly held and as seen in Table 18.5.1 below there are low volumes traded. 
The general security is relatively underutilised with the 2017/2018 total usage being only 

217,174.6ML.  Table 18.5.2 highlights the variability in general security allocations.  Water users 
mitigate the low periods by temporary trading of the unused water in the system.  Temporary Water 
values vary from season to season.  Adopting temporary water trading as a strategy would 

probably be too risky for a large holding of water but may be an option if a majority of the target 
volume was held in High Security.  The price of Lachlan High Security water has been steadily 
rising as Table 18.5.1 shows.  This is due to the current increase in development from cotton and 

tree crops.  There have also been unsuccessful purchasing campaigns offering well above the 
current $2000 per ML indicating a challenging task to acquire large volumes at even extraordinary 
pricing.  The major water fund companies do not hold sufficient volumes in this system so leasing 

options aren't available.

The temporary market is substantial with an average of 185,000ML traded each year over the past 

three years.  The current season of 2018/2019 has already traded 87,572ML in the past four 
months.  The price varies from $50 to $300 per ML.  Price is greatly reflective on allocation and 
dam levels.  High dam levels will be more prone to "spilling" so buying of water will be at lower 

prices.

under licence.  The General Security category has 849 licence holders and a total of 
1,891,997.7ML under licence.  High Security on average yields 95% allocation.  General Security 
as seen in Table 18.5.3 has had a better allocation average then the Lachlan River. The current 

low allocations are reflective of the record drought (2018), which was being experienced at the time 
of writing in NSW.  The upward trend in prices on the Murrumbidgee can be seen in Table 18.5.4.  
High Security prices have risen from an average of $3566 to $4630 per ML.  The top prices in the 

2018/2019-water season are closer to $6000 per ML.  Information from southern water brokers 
also indicate that High Security water will continue to be in high demand and hence continuing to 
put pressure on the market.  Table 18.5.4 shows the considerable amount traded each year in all 

categories.  Retention of High Security is reflected in lower sales over the past two years.  The data 
also doesn't show sales within the schemes located along the Murrumbidgee.  Schemes such as 
MIA and Coleambally hold large volumes of allocation and hence may have sales that aren't on 

public registers.  Discussions with two of the water investment funds, Duxton Water Limited and 
Blue Sky Water Fund, have indicated that they hold sufficient licence to potentially supply the 

required volume needed by Nico Young.

18.5.6 Existing Water Corporations Infrastructure 

During the water investigations meetings were arranged with Central Tablelands Water at Blayney 
and Goldenfields Water at Temora.  Goldenfields water at the last minute weren't available and the 

meeting was rescheduled as a phone hook up.  The corporations both have a core business of 
delivering potable water to the various towns in the central to southern regions of NSW.  The 
delivery is via extensive network of pipelines and infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the majority of the 

pipeline is only 250mm to 300mm in diameter.  The current demands on their systems are a 
limiting factor as well as the price of treated water.  A major focus for the investigation was to 

explore current easements used for pipelines by these corporations. 

18.5.7 Central Tablelands Water (CTW) 

CTW were approached and were very interested in assisting in any way that they could.  There 
was interest in the potential for sharing of pipeline easements, for supplying some water from 
existing groundwater supplies, and for them to partly (joint venture, or similar) or fully own a 

pipeline, and supply water to Nico Young for a unit based fee.  The CTW pipeline (see map Below) 
extends to the Gooloogong area and then to Grenfell.  Gooloogong is on the Lachlan River.  
Although the CTW doesn't utilise the Lachlan River as a water source it would be a possibility to 

utilise their easement to Grenfell, which is 30Km short of Young.  CTW are very receptive to any 
ideas on how to add to their business and also as to how they can use an additional water source 
to improve water reliability.  This would especially interest them if Goldenfields Water (GFW) were 

interested in interconnecting to this pipeline to effectively link up water from the Macquarie, Lachlan 

and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

Bore water from CTW is also available in small quantities.  The Bangaroo Bores have 470 ML 
spare and other areas up to 200ML.  DPI Water Hydrology Department also indicated that the long-
term extraction from these ground water sources would not be sustainable.  The pipeline distance 

for a small amount of water looks prohibitive as well but communication with CTW on these during 

final analysis of preferred model would be recommended. 

As discussed above, sourcing water from the Lachlan may not be as secure and reliable as other 
options, and additionally, the existing pipelines are significantly undersized.  The existing system is 

geared around treated potable water only (not required and more costly). 

Figure 18.5.2 Central Tablelands Water Pipeline Map 

 

18.5.8 Goldenfields Water (GFW) 

A meeting was conducted with Goldenfields (GFW).  Goldenfields have an extensive pipeline 
network (see below) of which most originates at Wagga Wagga on both the Murrumbidgee River 
and Murrumbidgee Alluvium.  These sources are a great distance away from the project site.  A 

suitable source site has been identified in Jugiong on the Murrumbidgee River.  

Goldenfields has a treatment plant and pipeline to Young at Jugiong. Goldenfields Water, current 

supplies up to 9ML per day of potable water to Young.  This is about the maximum the current 
pipeline can deliver.  Conversations with Goldenfields on using the existing pipeline easement to 
Young found the easement too tight to accommodate a joint pipeline or additional infrastructure.

Also, recent Goldenfields upgrades to current pipelines and infrastructure made more investment 

an unlikely and unattractive proposition to Goldenfields. 

Initial conversations of collaboration on the pipeline weren't positive as it is possibly too big of an 
asset for Goldenfields to invest in and their main focus is potable water.  In our conversations with 
Goldenfields Water it was noted that the current infrastructure at Jugiong supplying up to 9ML per 

Year to Young put a lot of pressure on the power grid in that area.  If Nico Young were to install the 
pumps to move the required water needed, then the power source in the area may need to be 

upgraded.  

Goldenfields Water are currently looking at a new pipeline to supply Boorowa from Jugiong, this 
however heads off in the wrong direction with respect to Nico Young and would be potable water 

only.  Also, Goldenfields do not seem interested in any form of joint venture or similar.  To facilitate 
the new Goldenfields pump station for the proposed Boorowa pipeline, a power upgrade may be 
required.  Depending on timing their maybe scope to opportunistically share the costs of a power 

upgrade to the Jugiong site.

18.5.9 Hilltop Council (Young Office) 

A meeting was held with Hilltop Council representatives at Young Council offices. 

Council was receptive to working with Nico in any way they can.  However, they only handle water 
locally as GFW supply bulk potable water into a reservoir just south of Young.  The capacity of the 

water delivery to young is only 8-9 ML/day, which is less than the mine requirement; hence it is not 
feasible to take any water from that source.  If required, and if there was room, they would be 
receptive to the utilisation of some road reserves to accommodate a new pipeline (as outlined 

above GFW already utilise some of the road reserves). 

18.5.10 Cowra Shire Council. 

Cowra Shire Council had had previous discussions with a Nico Young project team representative, 
and had prepared some concept pipeline routes, designs and costings looking at supplying water 

(and potentially treated sewerage effluent) from Cowra district to Thuddungra.  The use of treated 
sewerage effluent could be possible, but would require approval from the EPA, and the flows may 

need to be segregated.  

The volume of treated effluent generated at Cowra is only in the order of 1.5 ML/day.  Therefore, 
this relatively low volume coupled with the lower security of sourcing large volumes of water from 

the Lachlan, (see discussion above) means that a pipeline from Cowra is not likely to be feasible at 
the time of writing.  Due to probity and transparency required by a Council, it is likely that the 
supply of effluent would have to be tendered out, and would attract competition from other more 

local potential users. 

18.5.11 Essential Energy 

Essential Energy contact Melinda White - Governance and Corporate Services – 
A preliminary approach was made to Essential Energy in relation to potentially sharing their route 
and easements under their 66kV power line that currently runs from just east of Jugiong to Young. 
Although they indicate that it may be feasible, a lot more work would be required to progress this 

potential.  

18.5.12 Purchasing Strategy Cost 

18.5.13 Murrumbidgee River 

Estimated Cost of purchasing sufficient licence in the Murrumbidgee River.  

Potential Costs - 5500ML High Security @ $6000 per ML = $33,000,000.00. 

Time Frame -  Purchasing entitlements could take several years.  A purchasing strategy would 

have to be aggressive, as the amounts water needed would take years to accumulate. 

18.5.14 Leasing Entitlement From a Water Fund 

Costs are likely to be around 6-7% of the value of an entitlement plus CPI.

For example, Murrumbidgee High Security Licence at $6000 per ML @ 6 - 7% = $360 to $420 per 

ML per year. Total cost per year over 5500ML $1,980,000 to $2,310,000 

The advantage of this strategy is that a large amount of water could be sourced relatively quickly 
from the Murrumbidgee River.  A position with a fund would need to be taken as soon as possible 

to ensure water is available. 

18.5.15 Lachlan River 

Purchasing High Security entitlements appears to be difficult and most likely the majority of 
sourced water would be General Security Licence.  More water would therefore be needed in order 

to achieve the required volumes in the context of unreliable allocations.  

Potential Costs - Allowing a factor of 3:1 when purchasing General Security Licence versus High 
Security Licence the target volume may be 10 to 15000ML. 15000ML General Security @ $1200 

per ML = $18,000,000.00 Temporary Trading would be part of the strategy to makeup allocation 
short falls each year.  Worst-case 100% buy in a 0% allocation year. 5500ML Temporary Water @ 

$300 per ML = $1,650,000.00 

Time Frame - Based on the data in Table 18.5.2, an allowance of 2 to 3 years may be necessary to 

purchase the required volume. 

18.5.16 Pipeline Routes 

18.5.17 Water Delivery System Design Parameters and Assumptions 

Pump / System Flow – The flow requirement provided by Nico Young was 175L/s, however for a 

delivery buffer, some flexibility to meet the demand and the potential for some growth, the flow 

used for the preliminary design and costing was 200L/s (17.28ML/day)

Figure 18.5.4 Preferred Option – Jugiong to Thuddungra – Powerline Easement 

 

Pump/System Head (pressure) - As can be seen from Figure 18.5.2 there is a considerable 
elevation difference between the river elevation at Jugiong (approx. 248m) and the mine site 
(approx. 340m), and unfortunately there is no real feasible way around the elevated areas in the 

Wombat / Kingsvale area (approx. 575m).  Therefore, the elevation requirement is in the order of 
327m.  The decrease in elevation from this point to the mine site helps the head situation over the 
last 40km.  Although the pipeline sizing was selected to minimise the pipeline friction, a 

combination of the long distance (and hence a significant pipeline friction head), and the elevation 

head outlined above, results in a significant system head requirement.

Figure 18.5.5 Elevation Profile– Jugiong to Thuddungra 

 

Pump Station(s) Duty - The design is based on a main pump station (total duty 200 L/s @150m 
head), and 2 x Booster pump stations each also with a duty of 200L/s @ 150m head.  To include 
some redundancy, back up into the system, the design was based on 2 x Duty pumps, and one 

standby pump (each with a duty of 100L/s @150m head).  A 1 ML buffer/balance reservoir was 

included at each booster pump station. 

Pipeline Material and Sizing – Because it is proposed to locate this pipeline in or adjacent to a 
major Powerline (fully or partially), the use of a metallic pipeline material is not recommended, nor 
generally approved by the power authority (in this case Essential Energy), due to potential 

electromagnetic induction along the pipeline.  Therefore, two non-metallic pipeline material options 
where considered, HDPE (poly – butt welded) and GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic – Hobas RRJ or 
equivalent).  The main design and costing was conducted using HDPE.  The cost of GRP was 

peripherally considered.  The sizing of the pipeline was conducted to minimise the friction head, as 
any significant friction would further increase the already relatively high total dynamic head. HDPE 
DN630 PN16 PE100 poly pipeline was selected for the full length for costing purposes.  Further 

pipeline modelling and analysis would be required during subsequent design stages.  Further 

optimisation of pipeline sizing would likely be possible. 

Pipeline Route and Length- As outlined above several potential sources of water were 
considered (principally the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers) and three pipeline route options 
were considered.  Namely, Jugiong to Thuddungra along the existing Goldenfields Water pipeline 

route (see appendix 19), Jugiong to Thuddungra along the Essential Energy 66kV Powerline 
(preferred option), and Gooloogong to Thuddungra (see appendix 2).  For the reasons discussed

above, the powerline corridor option was selected as the preferred option to be costed.  The 
proposed route (yet to be approved by Essential Energy and the landowners involved), as far as is 
practical follows the route of the Essential Energy 66kV Powerline to just outside of Young, then a 

conceptual route around the western side of Young and out to Thuddungra is used.  The map 
length of this route is approximately 85kms, however as the alignment is yet to be finalised, the 

costing's have been based on 95kms.       

18.5.18 Budget Costing of the Water Delivery System 

Table 18.5.5 below provides budget costing's for the approval, assessment, preliminary design, 
tendering and construction supervision of the proposed preferred pipeline option.  To provide 
robust estimates and costing's verification assistance was provided by estimators from Lead 

Engineering and Construction (experienced pipeline design and construction contractors – their 
recent work includes similar pipelines in the same general area).  The costs provided are budget 
costing's only for a preliminary design, and will therefore require further refinement, should the 

project proceed

TOTAL  $1,953,000 

 

The forecast total budget cost for all phases of the proposed pipeline, using HDPE would be 
$68,161,000 (Excl GST).  However, if GRP pipe (Hobas or equivalent - RRJ - Rubber Ring Joint) 

was utilized instead of HDPE the cost could be reduced by in the order of $6M to $8M. 

Due to long distance to be pumped (approx. 90kms), and the significant elevation changes along 
the route, it would be relatively costly to pump the water.  As an example, based on an average 

power cost of say $0.20/kWh (i.e. average of peak, off peak and shoulder etc.), calculations 

indicate that it would cost in the order of $250/ML - $300/ML to deliver the water. 

To balance the water delivery and provide some back up for power outages, pump and pipeline 
breakdowns and R & M etc., it is recommended that a storage, or storages be constructed on the

mine site with a capacity in the order of 300ML (approx. 20 days of storage).  Storage is not 

included in the above budget costs.  

18.5.19 Alternate Pipeline Budget Costs and Pump Costs 

Should the availability and security of water sourced from the Lachlan improve and become a 

viable option, a pipeline from the Lachlan (near Gooloogong) sharing some of the CTW route and 
easements could be re-assessed.  The same capacity would be required and it would be of a 
similar length.  There would however be less of an elevation difference and associated system 

head to overcome likely leading to requiring one fewer booster pump station.  The construction 
conditions may also be more favourable.  The pipeline cost would likely be in the order of $3M to 
$4M lower, and the water pumping cost would also be reduced due to lower system head 

conditions.  

CTW showed some interest in being involved in this option. S hould it be attractive, there may be 

an opportunity to link the pipeline to the Goldenfields system (may be a useful asset after mine 

closure). 

18.5.20 Recommended Water Supply Option 

The Murrumbidgee River was found to be the most plausible and practical water source.  The 

Lachlan River was assessed as the second choice source with lower reliability.  Project delivery 
timing will be important with any water procurement in either water source as water is in high 
demand generally and considerable time may be needed to accumulate the required volume.  A 

pipeline from Jugiong to Young was short-listed.  Current and possible routes and easements were 

investigated, documented and costed. 

18.6 Residue Storage Facility 

The preliminary conceptual design of the RSF has been aimed at: 

 Optimising tailings storage capacity and maximise density of the stored residue.   

 Reducing environmental and societal impact. 

Residue storage options considered for this project comprise: 

 An integrated waste landform (IWL), where the RSF is lined and located within a mine 

waste dump.   

 In-pit tailings storage.   

 A standalone valley RSF. 

Neither Option 1 or 2 was considered feasible, as waste being generated from the mining activities 
is being used to backfill pits.  The valley style RSF has an ultimate embankment height of 

approximately 46.5 m.

18.6.1 Hazard Category Assessment  

A preliminary consequence and hazard category assessment was undertaken for the RSF using 

the criteria provided in the DSC19 Guide (Ref 17), Table 2 and the ANCOLD (2012) Guideline (Ref 
18), Tables 1 and 2.  According to the DSC19 Guide Table 2, the RSF consequence category 

assessment would be High C. 

According to the ANCOLD Guideline, the category assessment identified a severity level impact 
assessment rating of Major, based on severe to crippling impacts on the business, health and 

social impacts and environmental impacts associated with a potential failure of the facility.  The 
population at risk (PAR) is estimated to be greater than 1 and less than 10.  Given the above, in 
accordance with ANCOLD (2012) Guidelines, the RSF has a Consequence Category Assessment 

of High C.  The next stages of the design work will need to address in detail the geotechnical, 
seismic and freeboard design parameters to be applied to the RSF, to meet the DSC and ANCOLD 

requirements. 

18.6.2 Residue Storage Facility Design Concept 

RSF for On/Off HLF Option 

This RSF study assumed borrow would be sourced within the storage area for the LOM operation. 

Refer to Ref 15 for detailed drawings of the RSF. 

The RSF is to be constructed using borrow materials sourced from the RSF impoundment.  The 

initial construction will comprise the lined internal footprint and a containment embankment, due to 
the potentially acid forming (PAF) nature of the residues.  A synthetic, HDPE liner, will be used to 

reduce the potential for migration of contaminants from the site.  Figure 18.6.1 below shows: 

The embankment layout for the RSF and a section of the adjacent On/Off HLF to the east of the 

RSF: 

 Sections for the external embankment, starter embankment and final embankment crest. 

 The starter embankment level is RL 355.0 m, providing 2.0 years storage capacity of 10.5 

Mm3. 

 The maximum embankment height for the 65 Mt Project, crest RL 382.5 m, is 

approximately 46.5 m high, which provides 107 Mm3 of storage, excluding freeboard. 

 Minimum freeboard allowance of 1 m. 

 The storage capacity curve for the RSF site which shows the ultimate capacity of the 

valley RSF could be 200 Mm3 at approximately RL 398 m.

Figure 18.6.1 RSF General Arrangement 

 
 

Embankment Construction 

Embankment construction is to be undertaken using compacted clayey materials, sourced from 

within the RSF impoundment area. 

The design concept includes a liner within the basin, where the main embankment at the 
northwestern end of the valley and ridges abutting the embankment, form the 'encapsulated' 
storage area.  The proposed future embankment raises are to be executed by downstream 

construction techniques using borrow materials sourced from within the impoundment area.  As the 
materials are removed for embankment construction, the basal liner is placed.  Contour drains to 
be constructed as part of the earthworks for each embankment raising will be required to divert 

rainfall runoff from the area upstream of the RSF into the adjacent valleys. 

The earthworks and liner construction costs were estimated based on the 3D DXF contour data 

supplied by the client.  Any supernatant water is to be recovered by a pump arrangement which 
can be placed into the valley and raised with the increasing residue and water level.  The collected 

water is to be returned to the process plant for re‐use. 

Embankment Geometry 

The design concept adopted for the starter embankment and all subsequent 
embankments, has downstream slopes of 3:1 horizontal to vertical (H:V), upstream slopes 
of 2:1 (H:V) and embankment crest width of 6 m.  The starter embankment has a

compacted upstream zone supported by a traffic-compacted downstream zone.  The primary 
structure will comprise a homogenous, 'select' soil embankment, with compacted 'select' clayey 
borrow.  The materials for embankment construction and the depth of the embankment foundation 
works will need to be confirmed in future geotechnical investigations.  The design concept includes 
a liner within the basin formed by the encapsulation of the storage area.  The proposed future 
embankment raises are to be executed by downstream construction techniques using borrow 
materials sourced from within the RSF impoundment area.   

Liner Details 

Due to the geochemical characteristics of the leachate from the residue to be stored in the RSF, a 
liner is to be installed on the base and upstream slopes of the RSF containment embankment.  The 

liner to be installed is subject to cost considerations (purchase and installation costs) and the 

HDPE liner was selected.   

An elastomeric BGM such as Coletanche ES2 which is a 4.0 mm thick, elastomeric BGM that 
contains a 250 g/m² polyester geotextile as internal reinforcement, has been considered as an 
alternative to HDPE.  HDPE liners have historically been used for these types of projects and are 

marginally cheaper in terms of liner, geotextile underlay and installation costs than a BGM.       

Underdrainage System 

At this stage, an underdrainage system, which is normally used to assist in the recovery of water, 
has not been incorporated into the concept design.  The value of such a system needs to be 

supported by geotechnical testwork on the residue materials and modelling to determine its 
benefits, particularly in increasing the insitu dry density of the deposited residues.  An 
underdrainage system typically comprises a network of feeder lines running along natural drainage 

paths within the RSF basin.  The underdrainage lines will typically comprise slotted pipe (Megaflo 
or approved equivalent) surrounded by a filter zone composed of aggregate and sand, wrapped in 
geotextile and stabilized with selected rock.  The underdrainage does have some potential to 

reduce seepage losses from the RSF.  However, the primary mitigation measures to contain 

seepage is a well compacted clay base the well-constructed HDPE liner.   

Decant System 

The primary method of water recovery is pumping or decanting from the supernatant pond formed 

on the surface of the tailings.  The use of pumps with suction or intake located at a relatively 
shallow depth, such as the turret illustrated in Figure 18.6.2 below is preferred, as it allows these 
pumps to operate in relatively shallow water which maximises the water recovered and allows for 

maximum exposure of the tailings beach.  The turret is relatively new technology and is designed to 

improve water recovery.

Figure 18.6.2 Decant Turret and Pump 

 

Water Management 

The supernatant pond level must be actively maintained so as to be kept around the decant area 
and well clear of the main embankment.  At no time should the supernatant pond be allowed to 
encroach within 100 m of the engineered embankment.  The position and extent of the supernatant 

pond is controlled by the water recovery which is to be maximised.  The decant pumping system 

must be capable of recovering additional water during the wet season.   

Residue Deposition 

The residues (spent heap leach materials and leach plant residue) will be transported to the RSF 

by trucking and dumping from multiple locations around the perimeter embankment.  Tailings 
deposition is to be executed such that the residue beach is sloping towards the decant facility in the 
centre of the RSF and the residue does not 'stack' above the crest of the perimeter embankment.  

Old conveyor matting, or similar, may need to be placed at the dumping locations to protect the 
liner.  The dumping sequence for the residue is to be formulated such that any supernatant water 
pond which forms is always maintained around a decant structure.  The residue is to be periodically 

shaped using a swamp dozer or similar and compacted to maximise the density of the stored 

residue.  The extent of these works can be determined after the operations commence.   

18.7 Natural Gas 

The Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline passes through Young, and a gas compressor and control 

centre is located in Young, supplying gas via laterals to Orange and Wagga Wagga. Connection to 

the gas supply system has not been considered for the Nico Young project. 

18.8 Airport 

Young is serviced by an airport with a single all weather sealed runway, 1,220 m x 18 m. Jervois 

advise that they believe this is suitable for a Beechcraft King Air aircraft.

18.9 Accommodation 

Young is the largest town in the region with a population of just over 7,000. It is located in a 
pleasant rural setting, with good access to both Canberra and Sydney. However, local 
accommodation facilities near Young are limited and will need to be established to service the 

construction and operation phases of the project. 

18.10 Adjacent Properties 

The area is intensively farmed for both crops and livestock.  Cherry orchards are located closer to 
Young, and Young claims to be the Cherry capital of Australia.  No cherry orchards were observed 

within the prospective mining area. 

An existing magnesite mine, operated by Young Mining Company Pty Ltd, is located approximately 

3 km to the west of the prospect.  The site mines crushes and screens magnesite, which is then 
transported into Young where it is calcined to produce magnesia for export.  Electric power is 

supplied to the operation and maximum power draw was stated as 0.7 MW.

18.11 Recommendations and Further Work 

18.11.1 Surface Layout 

Further work is required to: 

 Optimise the layout to minimise the extent of area overlap across the lease boundaries. 

 Survey possible routing for the raw water pipeline easement. 

 Survey possible routing for the railway spur into the site. 

 Identify a suitable location for the construction camp. 

 Evaluate the extent of road upgrades required for the project. 

18.11.2 Supply Transport and Logistics 

The key recommendations from the study are: 

 It is recommended JRV consider the findings presented in this report and enter into 
further negotiations with the preferred Port owners to define the specific scope of work for 

materials handling facilities and the costs and charges associated; 



NICO YOUNG PROJECT PEA

 It is further recommended that JRV consider the most economic and acceptable form or 
transport to the Mine, develop a specific scope of services for the preferred transport 
case and seek MoU's with preferred transport operators or go to market for pricing for a 

specific transport task; 

 JRV to consider the cost of onsite sulphuric acid production compared to the additional 

Net Present Cost of transporting sulphuric acid as presented in this report; 

 Undertaken preliminary design of the proposed rail alignment from Weedalion to site by 

obtaining site survey, land title information including mining exploration lease details and 

commissioning a consultancy to complete the design; 

 JRV to consider the FOB costs of importing reagents into the Ports considered in the 

study in deciding which Port options to take into the next stage.  

18.11.3 Electric Power 

The following recommendations for further work related to project power supply are made: 

Undertake detailed discussions with Essential Energy to firm up on actual capital requirements for 
grid connection and fixed and variable tariff charges for power supply from the grid.  This should 

cover both the total plant demand and the option of supplementary supply. 

Solicit quotations from acid plant technology suppliers to provide the required steam turbine genset 

power station, complete with black start power and steam capability. 

18.11.4 Water Supply 

As part of advanced studies in other project disciplines, the project water supply requirement 

should be more closely estimated. 

Early discussions should be initiated with water funds and supply easement owners to establish 

preliminary conditions, capability, and availability. 

Early discussions should be initiated with the power supply authority to establish preliminary 
conditions, capability, and availability of power along the nominal pipeline route, particularly at the 

Jugiong intake station where power draw will be a significant additional draw to the local network. 

It is recommended that communication continue in follow up phases of investigation with 

Goldenfields Water and Central Tablelands Water to exhaust all potential mutual benefits that may 

present from having a new pipeline to the project. 

18.11.5 Residue Storage Facility 

Geotechnical testing of the slumping characteristics of the residue is to be executed during the next 

phase of the project.

Whilst stainless steels will remain an important avenue of future nickel consumption (compound 

annual growth rates historically exceeds GDP expansion, a trend that is expected to continue), 
electrification of the global transportation sector will become increasingly important for future 
demand trends.  This is specifically due to the use of nickel in batteries.  At a point during the 

2020's more nickel will be used in non stainless steel applications than stainless.  

Nickel is used in a variety of batteries but the most significant for future pricing dynamics are its 

utilisation in the cathodes of lithium ion chemistries, specifically Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt ("NMC") 
and Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminium ("NCA").  Nickel is particularly important for the projected roll out of 
electric vehicles since it contributes to the increasing energy density of batteries (at expense of 

stability if it substitutes out cobalt).  Higher energy density allows greater vehicle driving range 
between battery charges.  Electric vehicle battery chemistry is thus projected to transition to higher 

nickel content over time, a trend that has already commenced. 

Stainless steel nickel consumption is initially satisfied by products classified as Class 2: ferronickel 
including nickel pig iron, oxides plus stainless scrap.  Within stainless melt shops, primary Class 1 

nickel will only be used to supplement cheaper sources of supply in order to reach required 
austenitic (nickel containing) stainless steel ratios.  Technically class 2 nickel cannot be utilised in

many non stainless applications, including batteries.  Thus the wave of Class 2 nickel supply that 
has arisen in the last decade from Indonesia, the Philippines and China is by and large unsuitable 
for battery use in its current form.  This presents an exceptional market opportunity for deposits 

such as Nico Young which will produce a form of nickel (nickel sulphate) that will be directly used in 

precursor materials for lithium ion cathodes. 

Due to the significant rise in demand for nickel within batteries, and the general unsuitability for 
class 2 forms of nickel to be utilised, expectations are for a bifurcated market in the future.  
Stainless steel will continue to represent the largest single first use of nickel units, and as such 

prevailing market conditions within stainless will significantly affect LME metal prices.  However, 
nickel products that are from stable, secure locations, and in a chemical form suitable for battery 

usage, are expected to be aggressively sought after by consumers, and priced accordingly. 

19.1.2 Nickel Sulphate Market Overview 

High purity nickel sulphate (NiSO4.6H2O) has a long history of use for electrochemical 
applications, of which plating was foremost.  But in recent years, on a first use basis this has been 
overtaken by battery applications, as illustrated in Figure 19.1.2.  While historical battery demand 

has been driven by use in the production of nickel hydroxide for NiMH and NiCd batteries, Li-ion 
cathode materials will dominate future demand for high purity nickel sulphate.  This is a 
fundamental step change in industry dynamics, with nickel consumption in batteries projected by 

Roskill to represent 17 percent of annual demand by 2030, up from 3-4 percent today. 

Figure 19.1.2 Nickel Sulphate Demand Outlook by Application (kt Ni) 

 
 

Given this sustained rapid growth driven by Ni-containing precursors for the Li-ion battery industry, 

Figure 19.1.3 illustrates how demand is projected to be fulfilled by primary and secondary nickel 
feedstocks over the forecast period.  Recycling at present is mainly from NiMH and NiCd batteries, 

but Li-ion battery recycling is expected to become increasingly significant in the future.

Future supply of nickel sulphate from new projects is outlined above.  As nickel sulphate production 
plants are not capital intensive, any future bottleneck will be feedstock, due to increasing market 

tightness for Class I nickel, where competition will come from plating and nickel alloys.   

19.2 Nickel Product Specification 

The Nico Young project will produce approximately 73,500 tpa of high purity nickel sulphate 
hexahydrate NiSO4.6H2O crystals, having 22.3% Ni content (16,400 tpa Ni), with typical impurity 

analysis of:

19.3 Product Supply 

The proposed Nico Young product analysis is similar to leading nickel sulphate brands offered in 

the marketplace today, that are considered the global benchmark for high purity nickel sulphate. 
This will enable the product to be qualified by potential end users for acceptance in the most 
demanding electrochemical applications.  As such Nico Young product is targeted to be suitable for 

high end nickel-containing battery precursors and to the plating industry worldwide, where optimum 

premium levels can be achieved with a strong technically-based sales and marketing programme. 

19.4 Packaging 

Nickel sulphate hexahydrate produced at the Nico Young facility are forecast to be free-flowing 

bright green reflective crystals, visually indicative of high purity.  Although there will be some 
compaction during product transit and storage, this is not expected to be detrimental to ease of 
bulk handling or ready dissolution, as required in individual end-use applications at customer 

plants. 

In line with accepted chemical industry practice, the product will be packed on site in 1,000 kg 

bulker bags then stuffed into 20 ft TEU dry cargo containers for shipment ex Australian Port, 
recognising that nickel sulphate is classified as dangerous goods (DG) for Marine purposes. 
Accordingly, only sealed containers will be employed and it is not planned to offer LCL shipments 

which carry an ocean freight premium.  Charter vessels uplifting bags in bulk would only be 
contemplated if the shipment volume and destination make this mode of ocean freight attractive to 

both parties. 

19.5 Commercial Strategy 

Target markets for Nico Young high purity nickel sulphate are the battery and plating industries.  A 
commercially sound sales and marketing plan will be developed, recognising that major end-users 

of nickel sulphate for these two electrochemical applications will need to qualify a new brand well 
before authority is given for purchase.  Representative samples of future production will therefore 
be supplied to targeted direct customers and distributors well before supply commences; this 

process is accommodated in the envisaged Definitive Feasibility Study schedule.

Technical sales and service personnel will be engaged to conduct such qualification trials at 
potential customers and continue thereafter in support of ongoing sales.  Such customer support is 
essential to ensure end-user satisfaction and long-term sales continuity, and to underpin stable and 

consistent production and attain optimum product premium in the marketplace.  

19.5.1 Lithium-Ion Battery Precursors 

In the battery industry, historical demand for nickel sulphate has been driven by its use in the 
production of nickel hydroxide for NiMH and NiCd batteries.  But looking ahead it is universally 

accepted that nickel-containing precursors for Li-ion cathode materials will dominate demand and 
be the driver of large nickel consumption in the years ahead.  Although demand outlook is 
presently Asian-centred in Japan, Korea and China, developments in Europe and North America 

will be closely monitored. 

19.5.2 Plating Industry 

Plated nickel is used to enhance the utility, value and sales appeal of consumer goods and 

manufactured products.  Also, these surface coatings are used to improve physical properties such 
as wear, heat or corrosion resistance.  In many applications nickel coatings serve the dual purpose 
of providing a bright or satin decorative finish while imparting improved corrosion resistance or 

other functional properties (e.g.) automotive components, bathroom fittings and builders' hardware. 

Until recent years, the major use of nickel sulphate hexahydrate was for the plating industry and 

while robust growth continues worldwide, consumption has now been overtaken by Li-ion battery 
precursor requirements.  Nevertheless, the plating industry (especially in Asia, which represents 
>75% of global consumption) is an attractive but technically demanding first-use market for the 

Nico Young product, because high purity is essential to satisfactory production outcomes. 

19.5.3 Sales Practice: 

Supply would be negotiated against either: 

 Offtake agreements with a pre-determined premium. Minimum monthly uplift to be 
specified during the month prior to shipment, to ensure consistent monthly production and 
cash flow; 

 Annual volume contracts with a premium fixed for the duration; or 

 Spot orders from regular or new customers based on LME Cash, with premium agreed 
annually or at time of order. 

19.6 Cobalt Market Overview 

The cobalt market is in the early stages of a transformation due to its role in the electrification of the 
global economy, particularly in transportation.  Cobalt demand is growing strongly and its rate of 
increase which expected to rise further as electric vehicles become established in global industry 

and transportation sectors.

Figure 19.6.1 Consumption of Cobalt by Application – 2018 

 
 

Already nearly 60 percent of all cobalt is used in batteries, mostly in lithium ion cathodes.  Despite 

the publicity around electric vehicles, around a quarter of all cobalt units are used in the ca 1.5 
billion smart phones manufactured annually.  Other personal devices make up around another 15 
percent of global cobalt demand.  Moving forward, due to increasing market saturation of cellular 

phone and personal electronic device users, and the rise of electric vehicles, the latter is forecast to 

dominate future cobalt demand. 

Historically super alloys have been the cornerstone of demand for high purity metallic cobalt units.  
End use demand of super alloys includes aerospace, defence, power generation and prosthetics.  

Other important uses include magnets, carbides and diamond/hard facing steels. 

Cobalt is generally produced as a by or co-product; in 2018 it was estimated that three quarters of 
cobalt was co-produced with copper, one quarter with nickel.  Approximately three quarters of 

global cobalt supply is from the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC"), with a significant 
proportion of these units being refined into final form in China.  Cobalt delivery to customers 
broadly occurs in either metallic (99.3% or 99.8% grades) or various chemical forms (including 

cobalt sulphate, the precursor form for cathode production).  Whilst there is crossover, generally 

batteries use cobalt in a chemical form.   

The reliance on the DRC is problematic for many customers as outside of sites run by western 
multi-national mining companies, work and safety practices are often inconsistent with required 

supplier standards. 

As such the market outlook for cobalt supply from reliable, non-DRC producers is extremely robust.  
Whilst battery manufacturers are aggressively substituting and minimising cobalt from cathodes, 

there are technical and safety constraints around their ability to remove in any timeframe affecting 
investment decisions such as in the Nico Young.  In addition, the expansion of low cobalt EV

batteries will likely result in higher overall cobalt demand.  Cobalt supply is considered the key 
constraint on how rapidly the world is able to electrify its commercial and personal transportation 
sectors.  As such there is expected to be significant support for cobalt into the future which will 

result in a rebasing of cobalt pricing versus historical averages. 

Due to the unprecedent wave of incremental cobalt supply from the DRC in 2018 (both from 

artisanal and non-artisanal sources), the significant oversupply of intermediate cobalt hydroxide 
has significantly depressed prices through the course of 2H 2018 and into 2019.  These inventories 
are being absorbed as electric vehicle demand rises, and supply side responses to lower 

commodity prices in the DRC have been as profound on the downturn as they were on the upturn.  
In the timeframe envisaged for Nico Young operations, cobalt is universally forecast to be in 
structural deficit, as the demands of leading automakers for cobalt usage simply cannot be met by 

the supply side, assuming their vehicle forecasts prove correct.  This outlook clearly bodes well for 

cobalt producers.

The product is expected to contain low impurity levels as the cobalt sulphide will be precipitated 

after impurity removal and selective solvent extraction.  

The product is relatively unique as there are currently few, if any, metallurgical operations which 
produce a bulk high purity cobalt sulphide product.  As a result, direct benchmarking with similar 
products is not possible.  The product does however compare favourably with synthetically 

produced cobalt sulphide products produced for the chemical industry.  The high purity cobalt 
sulphide market minimum grade specification starts from ~99.0% cobalt sulphide on a dry basis.  
The Nico Young product also represents a higher purity product when compared to other cobalt 

intermediate products (such as cobalt hydroxides or mixed cobalt hydroxides) which are used as 

feedstock by producers of other high-grade cobalt products such as cobalt sulphate.  

19.6.2 Product Supply 

There are currently few, if any, metallurgical operations which produce a bulk cobalt sulphide 

product.  As such, this product represents a unique market offering with limited competing 
products.  Although this may present marketing challenges as there is no specific target market for 
the product in its entirety, its purity and flexibility to form a feedstock for other forms of refined 

cobalt production, including cobalt sulphate, means there is strong likelihood of it being sold on 

attractive commercial terms.     

19.6.3 Packaging 

Consistent with standard market practise, packaging for wet metallurgical intermediates such as 

the Nico Young cobalt sulphide will be packed on site in one tonne (1,000kg) lined bulker bags, 
then stuffed into 20 ft TEU dry cargo containers for shipment ex Australian port.  Only sealed 
containers are employed and it is not planned to offer LCL shipments.  Charter vessels are not 

expected to uplift bags in bulk due to insufficient cargo per shipment. 

There is also commercial flexibility to sell product in two tonne lined bulk bags, depending on the 

final marketing strategy to be adopted.   One or two tonne bulk bags are generally acceptable to

most potential customers for this material type.  This form of packaging is preferred by many 
customers due to ease of storage, transport and containment of the material.  Bulk bags are easily 
stored in warehouses, or open areas as they are lined, UV protected and waterproof.  They are 

easily handled by forklift and can be readily transported by truck, on rail, or in containers.  The lined 
and waterproof nature of this packaging ensures low risk of external environmental impacts when 
compare with other forms of packaging, for example bulk storage, and these bags are also 

generally approved for transportation of hazardous materials.  

Other options for the transportation of this products may be possible. For example, lined containers 

may be suitable for local purchasers.  If the product is dried, drums could be considered.  Drums 
are often used as the packaging of choice for high purity cobalt sulphate which is generally sold on 
a dry basis.  Alternative packaging options would need to be tested for practicality, and to 

determine any potential risks associated with these options.  For example, customers may not be 
able to receive material in certain packaging, which could affect the potential customer base for the 

material.  

Due to the above considerations it is recommended to use lined bulk bags as the base case 

packaging option for the prefeasibility study of the Nico Young Project.     

19.6.4 Commercial Strategy 

Target Market 

While there are possible outlets for cobalt sulphide to refiners of metallic cobalt who may purchase 
third-party feedstock in addition to their own integrated mine-to-market operations, and also 
manufactures of catalysts for hydrodesulphurisation in the oil and gas industry, the target market 

for the Nico Young product would be refiners who convert a variety of intermediate and other cobalt 
products into specific cobalt end use chemicals.  In addition to the above-mentioned established 
chemical product applications, the fastest growing market for cobalt is in the production of battery 

cathode precursors - for which cobalt sulphate is foremost. 

Targeted refiners for Nico Young cobalt sulphide produce speciality products that trade at a 

premium to the prevailing cobalt price. Due to the rapid growth in demand expected for electric 
vehicles, and the need to secure supply to meet this demand from limited cobalt resources, these 
refiners are less price sensitive to the underlying cobalt price and more focused on securing stable 

supply of these commodities.  This is particularly true for high purity cobalt products that require 

little effort to convert to battery chemicals.      

Due to the rise of electric vehicles, this is a rapidly expanding market, particularly for chemicals 
suitable for lithium ion battery use.  This target market represents the main target market for the 
sale of the cobalt sulphide product from the Nico Young project.  The high demand and future 

growth in this market should result in favourable purchase terms for cobalt products in this market, 
with payables expectations at the full (100%) metal content value.  The high purity of the Nico 

Young cobalt sulphide should ensure its competitive pricing in this market. 

In conclusion the main target market for the sale of cobalt sulphate from the Nico Young project is 
high purity cobalt chemical producers with payment terms targeted at 100% of the contained cobalt 

value.

A further option warrants consideration.  The current cobalt final product for the Nico Young project 
is a cobalt sulphide product of relatively high purity.  Consideration should be given to producing a 
cobalt sulphate product suitable for the battery industry directly.  This may be possible if the solvent 

extraction raffinate is suitably pure, or can be rendered suitably pure, by further impurity removal to 
produce a high purity cobalt sulphate.  The incremental capital associated with installing a 
crystallisation circuit and dropping the cobalt precipitation circuit is not considered significant.  This 

would eliminate the need for further processing of the material and the product could be sold 
directly to battery manufacturers.  This market generally attracts a premium over prevailing cobalt 
prices and is expected to have high demand growth in the future due to the rapid growth expected 

in lithium ion batteries. 

Sales Practice 

Supply would be contracted against either: 

 An offtake agreement with pre-determined payables, having shipments aligned to 
monthly output; or 

 A single annual volume contract with payables agreed for the duration.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Summary 

Environmental Permitting and Approvals 

The following NSW environmental-related approvals, leases, licences and permits would be 

required for the Proposal: 

 Development Consent and associated Gateway Certificate required under the 

Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. 

 Mining Lease required under the Mining Act 1992. 

 Environment Protection Licence required under the Protection of the Environment 

Operations Act 1997. 

 Roads Act Section 138 Permit. 

 Water-related approvals and licences required under the Water Management Act 2000. 

The primary NSW approval would be the Development Consent for which a detailed Environmental 
Impact Statement supported by a range of Specialist Consultant studies would be required.  The 
application would be classified as State Significant Development, with the NSW Department of 

Planning and Environment responsible for accepting, managing and assessing the application.  
The application would be determined by a senior Departmental officer or the Independent Planning 
Commission.  A period of 18 to 24 months is usually required from the commencement of the 

application process (once a reasonably definite project description is available – typically at the end 
of the Preliminary Feasibility Study process) to determination, although this can vary widely based 

on matter specific to each application. 

In addition, a referral under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) is likely to be required.  The Commonwealth Minister for the 

Environment will determine whether the Proposal is a controlled activity for which Commonwealth 
approval is required. A bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and NSW to accredit the 
NSW assessment process for the purposes of assessment of EPBC Act approvals is in place and 

will be invoked if required 

Following receipt of development consent and any approval under the EPBC Act, the remaining 

approvals may be granted and a range of post-approval documents, including management plans, 

are required to be prepared and approved. 

Finally, a biodiversity offset is likely to be required to offset proposed disturbance to native 
vegetation.  The quantum of the required offset will be determined during preparation of the EIS, 

however, three options exist to satisfy this requirement:

 Establishment of a Stewardship Site and retirement of the associated biodiversity credits. 

 Purchase of the required biodiversity credits from a third-party who will then be 

responsible for managing the associated Stewardship Site(s). 

 Payment into the Biodiversity Conservation Fund, typically at a premium to the "market" 

rate for such credits. 

Environmental Studies and Assessment of Constraints 

Table 20.4.4 presents a summary of the constraints identified above. In summary, the most 

significant environmental constraints upon the development of the Proposal are as follows: 

 Ecology, particularly in relation to potential impacts on threatened ecological communities 

and fauna species and the availability (or otherwise) of suitable biodiversity offset credits. 

 Soils and land capability, particularly in relation to impacts on and rehabilitation of highly 

productiove agricultural land. 

 Traffic and transportation, particularly in relation to road upgrades and potential safety 

management issues, real or perceived. 

 Social impacts, particularly in relation to the establishment of a substantial new operation 
in an area with limited availability of workers and capacity constraints in relation to 

services and infrastructure. 

Government and Community Consultation 

Government agency consultation will include both formal and informal consultation.  Formal 

consultation will include the following: 

 Conceptual Project Development Plan. 

 Interagency Meeting. 

 Application for Environmental Assessment Requirements. 

Informal consultation will be required on an ad hoc basis throughout preparation of the EIS. 

Community consultation will include two components as follows: 

 Company-related consultation, including: 

- direct consultation with landholders within and surrounding the Project Site 

- community meetings and information sessions with the wider community and 
special interest groups

The Mine Closure Plan will be required to demonstrate that the Project Site, following completion of 

mining operations will: 

 be safe, stable, secure and non-polluting with land management requirements no higher 

than surrounding land; 

 provide for sustainable final land uses, including productive land uses that include a mix 

of agriculture and nature conservation; and 

 be acceptable to the surrounding community, future landholders and relevant government 

agencies.

 The application would be determined by either a senior officer of DPE or the Independent 

Planning Commission under delegation from the Minister for Planning.  

Under Section 4.42 of the EP&A Act, once State significant development consent is granted, the 
following approvals cannot be refused.  However, separate applications for each of the following 

would still be required and additional information may be requested by the relevant agency: 

 Mining Lease - A Mining Lease Application may still be refused on the 'fit and proper 

person' grounds identified in the Mining Act 1992. 

 Environment Protection Licence (EPL) - The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) may 

require preparation of a range of management plans prior to granting of an EPL. 

 Section 138 Permit under the Roads Act 1993. 

Similarly, under Section 4.41 of the EP&A Act, once State significant development consent is 
granted, the following approvals are not required.  However, the assessment requirements to 

obtain these approvals would typically be expected to be addressed in the EIS and failure to 
address these requirements would typically result in a request for additional information at the 

assessment stage: 

 Aboriginal Heritage Impact Permit under Section 90 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 

1974.

 Water use approval under Section 89, a water management work approval under Section 
90 or an activity approval (other than an aquifer interference approval) under Section 91 

of the Water Management Act 2000. 

20.3.3 Gateway Certificate 

In 2012, the NSW Government introduced the Strategic Regional Land Use Policy to address land 
use conflicts between the mining and coal seam gas industry and the agricultural and equine 
industries.   The Policy seeks to protect Critical Industry Clusters (CIC) and Biophysical Strategic 

Agricultural Land (BSAL) from inappropriate mining and coal seam gas development.  There are no 
CIC's in the vicinity of the Project Site, however, BSAL is present (see Section 20.3.5).  In 
summary, BSAL is land that has high quality soil and water resources and is capable of sustaining 

high levels of agricultural productivity.  Where more than 20ha of BSAL is present within a 
proposed Mining Lease Application area, an application for a Gateway Certificate is required.  The 
application is determined by the Mining and Petroleum Gateway Panel who may issue a Gateway 

Certificate, typically with conditions requiring additional assessment during preparation of the EIS.  
A Gateway Certificate (or if BSAL is not present – a Site Verification Certificate) is required prior to 

an application for Development Consent being determined. 

20.3.4 Mining Lease 

Under Section 5 of the Mining Act 1992, mining or prospecting without authorisation is an offence. 
Nico Young Pty Ltd hold Exploration Licences (ELs) 5571, 5527 and 8698.  A Mining Lease 
Application under Part 5, Division 1 of the Mining Act 1992 will be required in order to obtain a 

Mining Lease that will permit mining of the resource.  It is noted, however, that potential exists for 
infrastructure or disturbance beyond the area available within the Exploration Licences held by the 
Company.  Mining Leases cannot be granted over third-party Exploration Licences without the 

consent of the holders of those Licences.   

Notwithstanding this, limited activities may be undertaken in areas not covered by Mining Lease as 

off-site Ancillary Mining Activity activities.  Under Clause 7 of the Mining Regulation 2016 these 

may include: 

 Construction, maintenance or use any building, mining plant, dam, road, railway or 

pipeline. 

 Stockpiling of waste rock/overburden and tailings/reject material; or 

 Storage of materials for mining operations. 

Whether particular activities may be classified as Ancillary Mining Activities is a question of fact for 

which specialist legal advice is required. 

20.3.5 Environment Protection Licence 

Section 48 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act) states that an 
Environment Protection Licence (EPL) must be held for any premises at which any a scheduled 
activity.  Clause 29 of Schedule 1 of the POEO Act identifies that 'mining for minerals' is a

scheduled activity where the activity would disturb more than 4ha.  As the Project would disturb 

substantially more than 4ha, an EPL will be required. 

20.3.6 Section 138 Consent 

Section 138 of the Roads Act 1993 states that works within road reserves may not be undertaken 

except with the consent of the relevant roads authority.  As a result, works associated with the 
intersection of the Site Access Road and the public road network, as well as any works within road 
reserves associated with the Mine Site will require approval from Hilltops Council and/or the Roads 

and Maritime Service. 

20.3.7 Water-Related Licences 

The following Water Sharing Plans apply to the Project Site: 

 Water Sharing Plan for the Lachlan Unregulated and Alluvial Water Sources 2012. 

 Upper Lachlan Alluvium (upstream of Lake Cargelligo) Water Sharing Plan. 

 Lachlan Fold Belt Water Sharing Plan. 

Additional plans that may apply to the Proposal should water be sourced from the Murrumbidgee 

water sources include the following: 

 Water Sharing Plan for the Murrumbidgee Regulated River Water Source 2016. 

 Water Sharing Plan for the Murrumbidgee Unregulated and Alluvial Water Sources 2012. 

These Water Sharing Plans establish rules for sharing water between different types of water users 
such as town, rural stock and domestic, irrigation, industry and environmental users.  Each Plan 

identifies the maximum amount of water available within the area covered by the Plan and the 

available water allocations under the Plan. 

The following approvals and allocations will be required to be obtained under the Water 

Management Act 2000 (WM Act) and/or the above Plans: 

 An aquifer interference approval under Section 91(3) of the WM Act is likely to be 

required for disturbance to the aquifer associated with the proposed open cuts.  

 A Water Access Licence(s) with a suitable allocation for groundwater (and potentially 
surface water) that would be captured during and following mining operations.  An 
allocation will be required to be obtained for groundwater that would flow into the 

proposed open cuts.  An adequate allocation will be required to be purchased on the 

open market through a trading scheme set up under the relevant Water Sharing Plan. 

 A Water Access Licence(s) with a suitable allocation for water supply from the relevant 
water source.  An adequate allocation will be required to be purchased and/or leased on 

the open market through a trading scheme set up under the relevant Water Sharing Plan.

Other approvals that would otherwise be required under the WM Act will not be required in 
accordance with Section 4.41(1)(g) of the EP&A Act 1979 (see Section 20.2.2).  Notwithstanding 
this, the EIS will be required to demonstrate that the matters covered by these approvals have 

been adequately addressed: 

 A water use approval for the use (including evaporation) of water captured during and 

following mining operations. 

 A water management works approval for drainage works. 

 A controlled activity approval for works within and surrounding on site watercourses, 

including any diversion works required. 

20.3.8 Referral Under the EPBC Act 

The Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) 
seeks to protect "matters of national environmental significance".  These typically include Federally-
listed species and vegetation communities and those the subject of international agreements. A 

referral under the EPBC Act is likely to be required for the Proposal.  The Commonwealth Minister 
for the Environment will determine whether the Proposal is a controlled activity for which 
Commonwealth approval is required.  A bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and NSW 

to accredit the NSW assessment process for the purposes of assessment of EPBC Act approvals 

is in place and will be invoked if required. 

20.3.9 Post Approval Documentation 

Following the granting of development consent or any other approvals required for the Proposal, 

there is typically a range of post-approval documents that will be required.  This will typically 

include, but may not be limited to the following: 

 Environmental Management Strategy. 

 Mining Operations Plan/Rehabilitation Management Plan. 

 Air Quality Management Plan. 

 Biodiversity Management Plan. 

 Water Management Plan. 

 Noise Management Plan. 

 Heritage Management Plan. 

 Blast Management Plan. 

 Transport Management Plan.

 Waste Management Plan. 

 Pollution Incident Response Management Plan. 

Many, if not all of these plans will require approval prior to commencement of either construction or 

mining operations. 

20.3.10 Biodiversity Offsets 

Finally, it is likely that biodiversity impacts will be required to be offset through one of the following 
mechanisms under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, typically prior to or within a defined 

period after commencement of construction: 

 Establishment of a Stewardship Site and retirement of the associated biodiversity credits. 

 Purchase of the required biodiversity credits from a third-party who will then be 

responsible for managing the associated Stewardship Site(s). 

 Payment into the Biodiversity Conservation Fund, typically at a premium to the "market" 

rate for such credits. 

20.4 Environmental Studies 

20.4.1 Introduction 

This section provides a necessarily brief and conceptual review of the environmental setting and 
constraints upon the development of the Proposal.  It is noted that environmental studies have 

either yet to commence or are at a preliminary stage.  As a result, much of the information 

presented in this section is drawn from: 

 publicly available information. 

 information provided by the Company; and 

 The experience of RW Corkery & Co Pty Limited, based on over 37 years' experience 
preparing application and related documentation for mining and related projects in NSW, 

including extensive experience in western and southwestern NSW. 

The information, presented in this subsection is, by its nature, preliminary and reliance should not 

be placed on the conclusions or assessments presented until further detailed assessment, 
including field surveys, can be completed.  Rather, the information presented attempts to identify 
the principal environmental constraints upon the development of the Proposal and the application 

for development consent and classify them as follows: 

 Significant constraint – this issue, in the absence of appropriate management, has the 

potential to prevent granting of development consent.

 Moderate constraint – this issue will require active, detailed management but should not 

prevent granting of development consent. 

 Minor constraint – this issue will require general management but should not prevent 

granting of development consent. 

 Negligible constraint – this issue is not relevant and should not prevent granting of 

development consent. 

20.4.2 Environmental Setting 

Regional Topography and Drainage 

Figure 20.4.1 presents the regional topography and drainage surrounding the Project Site.  In 
summary, the Project  Site is located within terrain that is generally gently undulating, with 

elevations reaching up to 726m AHD within the Weddin Mountain Range to the north, and down to 
approximately 250m in the flat, low-lying land to the east.  Elevations are generally higher to the 
southeast of the project Site around the town of Young, and lower to the northwest of the Project 

Site.  

The Project Site is located within the Lachlan Catchment approximately 20km to the north of the 

boundary with the Murrumbidgee Catchment.  Watercourses in the region drain generally towards 
the northwest into Bland Creek, which flows into Lake Cowal, from which waters reach the Lachlan 

River. 

Local and Project Site Topography and Drainage 

Figure 20.4.2 presents the topography and drainage within and surrounding the Project Site.  In 
summary, a ridge of interconnected hills runs generally north-south through the Project Site, with 
elevations ranging from approximately 464m AHD at Memagong Hill at the southern end of the 

ridge, to 380m AHD at the northern end.  Land to the west of the ridge is relatively flat, with 
elevations of around 300m AHD, while land to the southeast of the ridge is more undulating and 
elevated, reaching similar elevations between 420m AHD and 460m AHD.  Land to the northeast of 

the Project Site is typically flat to mildly undulating, with elevations between 320m AHD and 380m 

AHD. 

Middle Station Creek is located to the west of the ridge, flowing north and then west, while 
Duckhole Creek is located to the east of the ridge, and flows north before turning west and merging 

with Middle Station Creek.

Climate 

An onsite meterological station was installed in 2018.  However, as a result of the limited data 

available from that station, Figure 20.4.3 presents climate data from the Bureau of Meteorology-
operated Young Airport weather station, located approximately 9km to the southeast of the Project 

Site. In summary, the area experiences: 

 Hot summers, with a mean maximum temperature in January of 31.8°C and a mean 

minimum of 14.7°C. 

 Cool winters, with a mean maximum temperature in July of 13.0°C and a mean minimum 

of 0.9°C. 

 A moderate climate, with a mean rainfall of 605.7mm per annum, and mean monthly 

rainfall varying between 30.8mm in April and 64.4mm in November. 

Figure 20.4.4 presents wind roses for the Young airport. In summary, winds are predominantly from 
the east and north during summer, while in autumn the prevailing winds are from the east and 

southeast.  During winter, winds are predominantly from the south, however in spring they are 
mainly northerly.  Annually, winds are experienced most frequently from the north, east, southeast 

and south.

Land Use and Ownership and Residences 

Figure 20.4.5 presents the land uses surrounding the Project Site. In summary, surrounding land 

uses include the following: 

 Agriculture, including cropping and grazing. 

 Widely-spaced rural residences and occasional clusters of residences associated with 

villages such as Thuddungra.  

 Transportation (local and regional roads).

20.4.3 Surface Water 

Existing Environment 

The existing surface water environment is described in Section 20.3.2.  In summary: 

 Rainfall is moderate, with annual average rainfall of approximately 606mm; 

 Rainfall is spread relatively evenly throughout the year, with more rain days occurring in 

the cooler months than the warmer month. 

 The Project Site is located on a ridge, with the area surrounding the Project Site generally 

gently undulating; and 

 Middle Station Creek is located to west of the Project Site, and Duckhole Creek to the 

east, both flowing north on either side of the ridge before turning west and merging with 

Bland Creek. 

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential surface water-related impacts and constraints include the following. 

 Contamination of downstream surface water through the discharge of chemical or 

sediment-laden water. 

 Surface water discharged from the Project Site has the potential to impact on aquatic 
ecosystems as well as riparian vegetation and the biodiversity supported by that 

vegetation.  Transportation of contaminated material may also result in offsite 

contamination that may be difficult to remediate.  

 In order to manage this risk, the following management and mitigation measures will be 

required to be implemented: 

- strict separation of contaminated, sediment laden and clean water, with 
contaminated water contained on site, sediment laden water permitted to be 
discharged only once treated and clean water permitted to flow through the 

Project Site 

- line all contaminated water storage ponds and associated processing and 
reagent management areas to achieve a permeability of 1 x 10-9 over 1m or 

equivalent and retail all contaminated water onsite 

- establish erosion and sediment control structures to capture and treat all 
sediment laden water and ensure no discharge except in accordance with the 

Environment Protection Licence

- establish clean water diversions around all disturbed areas and ensure that 
clean water is permitted to flow through the Project Site without mixing with 

contaminated or sediment-laden water. 

Assuming that these measures are implemented, this issue is likely to pose a minor 
constraint. 

 Loss of surface water flows through isolation of the Mine Site from the remainder of the 

catchment. 

This is likely to be a negligible constraint as the area of the Project Site is small compared 
with the area of the Lachlan River Catchment. 

 Flooding-related impacts. 

This is likely to be a negligible constraint as the Project Site is highly unlikely to be affected by flood 

waters due to its location in the upper reaches of the Lachlan River Catchment.  However, rainfall 
intensities will be required to be taken into account when designing sediment and erosion control 

structures. 

20.4.4 Groundwater 

Existing Environment 

AQ2 Pty Ltd (AQ2) undertook an assessment of the hydrological and hydrogeological setting of the 

Project Site.  The following provides a summary of the principal findings of that study which is 

referred to hereafter as AQ2 (2018). 

 A Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) survey was conducted on 23rd July 2018 for a total of 
47.7km of survey lines to identify targets for a water exploration program.  Seven sites 

were identified and subsequently drilled. 

 The water exploration program was undertaken between 29 September and 1 November 
2018, with five bores completed and equipped as monitoring bores with 50mm casing 

and monuments (Figure 20.4.7). 

 Table 20.4.1 present the results of hydraulic testing on the completed bores, as well as 

two pre-existing bores.  In summary: 

- standing water levels were between 7.97mbgl and 54.6mbgl or between 
283.74m RL and 350m RL 

- airlift yields were between <0.5L/s and 10L/s 

- falling head tests indicated derived permeabilities of between 5m/d and 
0.0003m/d. 

Figure 20.4.8 presents the piezometric surface within and surrounding the Project Site.  The water 
table elevation is estimated to range between approximately 336 and 250 mRL across the Nico

Young site, with groundwater levels being a subdued representation of the topography.  The tight 
groundwater level contours represent a steep hydraulic gradient across the Project area indicative 
of a low permeability environment, although there may be increased permeability along the 

Thuddungra Fault.  Further down gradient from the Project Site, the contours indicate increased 
permeability with a clear flow path evident between the Nico Young tenements and the Bribbaree 

Hills, meandering in a westerly direction towards Bland Creek. 

 Groundwater quality within the Project Site may be summarised as follows: 

- pH - slightly alkaline (pH 7.7 to 8.4)  

- salinity - slightly brackish (800 to 1,300 mg/L TDS).  

 AQ2 (2018) states that anticipated that the groundwater system within the Project Site 

comprises four hydrostratigraphic units as follows: 

- Saprolite – clay layer inclusive of the mineralised laterite zones; low 
permeability and high storage 

- Saprock / Fractured bedrock – weathered / fractured basement unit 
interspersed with and underlying the "saprolite", with increased permeability and 

moderate storage 

- Fresh Bedrock – low permeability, low storage 

- Faults / Fractures within the Bedrock – two regional, north-south trending faults, 
bound the deposit.  The hydraulic characteristics of the faults are currently 

unknown - they could be zones of high permeability and low storage or, if filled 

with fine-grained fault gouge, low permeability and high storage. 

 Based on the above, AQ2 (2018) undertook a preliminary mine inflow estimate.  Table 
20.2 presents the results of that assessment.  In summary, that estimate determined the 

following: 

- dewatering would be intermittent throughout the life of the mine 

- dewatering of individual open cuts could be as high as 320kL/day, with a 
combined dewatering rate of up to 400kL/day 

- saturated saprolite may not dewater effectively, resulting in poor ground 
conditions 

- hydrostatic pressure behind the open cut wall is expected to be high, potentially 
impacting on wall stability and requiring selected dewatering in advance of 

mining operations

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential groundwater-related impacts and constraints include the following: 

 Drawdown/depressurisation of surrounding aquifers adversely impacting on surrounding 

water users or groundwater dependent ecosystems. 

 Dewatering of the proposed open cuts may result in drawdown or depressurisation of the 
surrounding aquifers.  This in turn may result in adverse impacts on surrounding 

groundwater users or groundwater dependent ecosystems.  AQ2 (2018) note that the 
permeability of the aquifers within the Project Site is limited and that drawdown is likely to 
be restricted in extent around the proposed open cuts.  In addition, dewatering operations 

are likely to be intermittent.  As a result, this issue is likely to pose a minor constraint. 

 Reduced groundwater quality as a result of changes to water chemistry during 

processing. 

 Potential exists for changes to water chemistry as a result of leakage of contaminated 

water from the Project Site storages or chemical changes as a result of mining 
operations.  The Applicant proposes to implement a range of measures to ensure that 

such discharge does not occur.  As a result, this issue is likely to pose a minor constraint. 

 Geotechnical instability as a result of reduced dewatering/elevated hydrostatic pressure 

within saprolite units 

 Potential exists for geotechnical instability of open cut walls as a result of reduced 
dewatering rates in saprolite material resulting in elevated hydrostatic pressure in the 

material immediately behind the open cut wall.  This may result in "heaving" of the walls 
and the resulting requirement for cut backs and potential lost production.  Further 
assessment of this issue will be required.  As a result, this issue is likely to pose a 

moderate constraint.  

20.4.5 Soils and Land Capability 

Existing Environment 

Areas within and immediately surrounding the Project Site have been indicatively identified as 
Biophysical Strategic Agricultural Land (BSAL) by the NSW Government (Figure 20.4.9).  BSAL is 
defined as land with high quality soil and water resources capable of sustaining high levels of 

agricultural productivity.  Mr David McKenzie of Soil Management Designs Pty Ltd (SMD) 
undertook a field assessment of the soils within the Project Site in June 2018 to verify the presence 
of BSAL. The following provides a summary of the principal findings of that study which is referred 

to hereafter as SMD (2018). 

 SMD (2018) classified four of the six sites tested, Sites 1, 2, 3 and 4, as BSAL 

(Figure 20.4.9). The soils at these sites are derived from dark ultramafic rock, with 
possible inter-mixing of aeolian material.  They exhibited excellent internal drainage, 

significant water holding capacity, and a neutral pH that encourages plant growth.

 SMD (2018) classified Sites 5 and 6 as non-BSAL (Figure 20.4.9).  The soils at these 
sites appeared to be a combination of alluvium and colluvium derived from granitic parent 
materials to the east of the Project Site, together with aeolian material.  These sites 

exhibited poor subsoil drainage and low pH (acidity) at depths between 5cm and 15cm, 

presenting limitations to plant growth. 

 SMD (2018) identified that the dark ultramafic parent materials extend to the north and 
south of the soil sampling transect and that BSAL will almost certainly will cover a large 

proportion of the Project Site.

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential impacts and constraints related to soils and land capability include the following: 

 Adverse impacts on high quality agricultural soils and associated loss of agricultural 

productivity. 

Potential exists for soil resources to be substantially degraded during stripping and storage, 
resulting in reduced agricultural productivity on the final landform.  In order to manage this risk, the 

following management and mitigation measures will be required to be implemented: 

 a detailed soils assessment, including robust recommendations for stripping and storage 

of soil resources will be required 

 a detailed rehabilitation plan will be required to identify the final landform and those 

sections of the landform that would be returned to agricultural productivity.  The Plan will 
also be required to identify the measures to be implemented during establishment of the 

landform and soil profile to ensure reestablishment of the required agricultural productivity 

 Assuming that these measures are implemented, potential remains that the required 
agricultural productivity will not be achieved.  As a result, this issue is likely to pose a 

moderate constraint. 

 Requirements associated with obtaining a Gateway Certificate impose substantial 

assessment requirements or, following granting of development consent, substantial 
rehabilitation requirements and that these requirements substantially increase the 

operating costs for the Proposal or are not feasible to achieve. 

Potential exists for requirements from the Gateway Certificate process to substantially increase the 
cost or time required to complete the soils and related environmental assessment for the Project, or 

result in unrealistic/difficult to achieve final landform requirements.  As detailed soils (and 
groundwater) assessment will mitigate this risk and provide robust recommendations for 

management of the issue. 

Assuming that these measures are implemented, this issue is likely to pose a minor constraint. 

20.4.6 Ecology 

Existing Environment 

Niche Environment and Heritage Pty Ltd (Niche) undertook an initial field survey of the Project Site 
in June and August 2018, as part of the biodiversity assessment being undertaken for the 

Proposal.  A further survey is proposed for December 2018.  The results of the surveys may be 

summarised as follows: 

 Figure 20.4.10 presents the vegetation within the Project Site.  In summary, the 

vegetation communities may be divided into four classes as follows:

- non-native - namely those areas that have been the subject of cropping or 
recent fertiliser application, with non-native species comprising more than 50% 

of all groundcover species present 

- cleared grassland – namely those areas that have been cleared of trees but 
where native species comprises more than 50% of all groundcover species 

present.  These areas may be cropping paddocks which have been allowed to 
lie fallow for a number of years, or grazing paddocks that have not been the 
subject of pasture improvement.  This community mat be classified as an 

Endangered Ecological Community (EEC) despite the absence of native 

overstory species 

- non-EEC native vegetation – comprising native vegetation that is not classified 
as an EEC under the BC Act 

- EEC Vegetation – comprising native vegetation that is classified as an EEC 
under the BC Act. 

 One area of very high quality EEC has been identified.  These areas are associated with 
a high prevalence of threatened species and are likely to require very substantial 

biodiversity offset requirements. 

 No threatened native plant species were discovered opportunistically during the survey, 
however this will be confirmed by a further survey involving vegetation plots planned for 

December 2018. 

 Most areas of native vegetation with overstory eucalypt trees present had hollows which 

provide potential native bird and mammal habitat), with approximately 50% of trees 

having one or more suitable habitat hollows in larger patches of such vegetation. 

 The following threatened species were identified within the Project Site (Figure 20.4.11).  

Others have been presumed to utilise the Project Site based on habitat assessment: 

- Superb Parrots. 

- Grey-crowned Babbler. 

- Squirrel Glider

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential ecology-related impacts include the following: 

 Significant impacts on Endangered Ecological Communities. 

 An assessment of significance of the impacts on the identified EEC's in accordance with 
the Biodiversity Assessment Methodology mandated by the BC Act will be required. 
However, with the implementation of standard controls and establishment of a suitable 

biodiversity offset/stewardship agreement or payment into the Biodiversity Conservation 

Fund, this issue is likely to pose a moderate constraint. 

 Significant impacts on threatened flora species. 

 The presence or absence of threatened flora species will be confirmed by a vegetation 

survey in December 2018, however none were identified in the initial survey.  If any such 
species are identified, an assessment of significance of the impacts on them will be 
required.  With the implementation of strict controls, this issue is likely to pose a minor 

constraint to the Proposal. 

 Significant impacts on threatened fauna species. 

 At least three threatened fauna species are known to occupy the Project Site.  Habitat for 
these species will be disturbed, as a result an assessment of significance of the impacts 

on the identified species in accordance with the Biodiversity Assessment Methodology 
mandated by the BC Act will be required.  However, with the implementation of standard 
controls and establishment of a suitable biodiversity offset/stewardship agreement or 

payment into the Biodiversity Conservation Fund, this issue is likely to pose a moderate 

constraint. 

 Establishment of a suitable Stewardship Site/availability of required credits 

 The BC Act requires establishment of a Stewardship Site (and retirement of the resulting 

biodiversity credits), purchase of suitable credits from third party or payment into the 
Biodiversity Conservation Fund.  Potential exists that suitable Stewardship Sites will not 
be available or will not be available at a reasonable cost.  If that is the case, potential 

exists to pay into the Fund, however, a substantial premium applies to this option.  As a 

result, this issue is likely to pose a moderate constraint. 

20.4.7 Heritage 

Existing Environment 

Biosis Pty Ltd (Biosis) undertook a desktop assessment of Aboriginal and historic(non-Aboriginal) 

heritage. The results of the assessment may be summarised as follows:

 Ninety Aboriginal archaeological sites were identified within a 25km radius of the Project 
Site area, of which one site was located within the Project Site.  That site comprises of a 

single scarred tree located within the vicinity of Bribbaree Road (Figure 20.4.12).  

 The Project Site was identified as possessing moderate archaeological potential for 
artefact sites, modified trees, and burial sites, as the area contains landscape features 

that are closely associated with site distribution patterns for the region.  

 The assessment concluded that artefact sites are more likely to be low density artefact 

scatters or isolated finds occurring within the vicinity of watercourses on undisturbed 

landforms including ridgelines, well drained topographies, and alluvial flats. 

 Modified trees may be found within the Project Site in areas where patches of remnant 

vegetation are present. 

 Three locally significant historic heritage sites were identified within the north-eastern 

area of the study area as follows (Figure 20.4.12): 

- I70: St Patrick's Catholic Church, Thuddungra 

- I71: St Luke's Anglican Church, Thuddungra 

- I73: Thuddungra Memorial Hall. 

 One locally significant historic heritage site was identified approximately 1km to the 

southeast of the study area boundary as follows (Figure 20.4.12): 

- I135: Chinese Single Jian Dwelling. 

 A further three sites of potential historical significance were identified within the small 

township of Thuddungra that will require further assessment of significance. 

An archaeological survey will be undertaken following completion of the Preliminary Feasibility 

Study in conjunction with representatives of the Registered Aboriginal Parties to determine the 
potential presence of sites of items of Aboriginal.  A separate historic heritage survey will be 

undertaken by Biosis at the same time as the Aboriginal heritage survey.

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential heritage-related impacts include the following: 

 Impacts to known or unknown Aboriginal objects. 

- An Aboriginal heritage survey will be undertaken, with moderate likelihood 
identifying objects or places of Aboriginal heritage significance. If such objects 
or places are identified, further consultation with the Aboriginal community and 

government agencies will be required. Assuming such objects are located, this 

issue is likely to pose a minor constraint on the Proposal. 

 Impacts to historic or non-Aboriginal objects. 

- A non-Aboriginal heritage survey will be undertaken with the Aboriginal heritage 
survey, however, this issue is likely to pose a negligible constraint on the 

Proposal. 

20.4.8 Air Quality 

Existing Environment 

Ramboll Australia Pty Ltd (Ramboll) prepared an overview of the existing air quality environment 
(Ramboll, 2018) as part of their air quality impact assessment for the Proposal. Ramboll (2018) 

reported that the Thuddungra Magnesium Mine, located immediately to the west of the Project Site, 
has the potential to have cumulative air quality impacts with operations of the Proposal which will 
require quantification and assessment.  Other notable sources of air emissions are located closer 

to Young and unlikely to have a direct cumulative impact with emissions from the Proposal.  

Contributing particulate matter emission sources in the vicinity of the Project Site include: 

 Wind generated dust from exposed areas within the surrounding region; 

 Dust emissions from agricultural activities at neighbouring properties; 

 Dust entrainment due to vehicle movements along unsealed and sealed roads with high 

silt loadings; 

 Seasonal emissions from household wood burning; and 

 Episodic emissions from vegetation fires. 

Long-range transport of fine particles (dust storms and bush fire events) would also contribute to 

suspended particulate concentrations in the area. 

The annual average background values that Ramboll (2018) adopted for its assessment are based 
on monitoring data from Office of Environment and Heritage air quality monitoring stations at 

Wagga Wagga and Albury, and are as follows: 



NICO YOUNG PROJECT PEA

 PM10:  20.6µg/m³ 

 PM2.5: 7.3µg/m³ 

 Total Suspended Particulates: 51.5µg/m³ 

In addition to particulate matter, Tremolite and other asbestiform minerals have been identified 
within and surrounding the ore zones.  This material is likely to be extracted during mining 
operations and will be required to be managed to minimise the risk to workers and the surrounding 

community.  Asbestiform minerals are common in nickel laterite deposits elsewhere in Australia 
and in other jurisdictions.  However, this particular issue is not common in NSW and the regulators 
and surrounding community are unlikely to be unfamiliar with management of asbestiform minerals.  

As a result, perceived risks by external stakeholders may be substantially higher than that the 

actual risks. 

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Impacts at Surrounding Residences Associated with the Emission of Particulate Matter. 

Potential exists for unacceptable levels of particulate emissions at surrounding residences.  These 
may include amenity issues associated with deposited dust or health issues associated with 

suspended particulates.  In order to manage this risk, the following management and mitigation 

measures will be required to be implemented: 

 All disturbed areas with the potential to emit dust will be required to stabilised through the 

use of covers or chemical suppressants or watered regularly. 

 Progressive rehabilitation will be required to be completed. 

 All processing equipment will be required to be fitted with dust suppressant equipment. 

Assuming that these measures are implemented and given the distance to surrounding residences, 

this issue is likely to pose a minor constraint. 

Health Impacts Associated with the Emission of Asbestiform Particulates. 

Potential exists for asbestiform minerals to be emitted from the Project Site, resulting in perceived 
or actual adverse health impacts for workers and the surrounding community.  In order to manage 
this risk, the previously described management and mitigation measures will be required to be 

implemented, together with the following additional measures: 

 All areas of asbestiform minerals will be required to be mapped and strategically 

managed to minimise the potential for emission of asbestiform minerals, including 

encapsulation of waste material with a high potential to contain asbestiform minerals. 

 Workers and the surrounding community will be educated in relation to the risks and 

management of asbestiform minerals.

 Monitoring for suspended asbestiform minerals will be undertaken. 

Assuming that these measures are implemented, this issue is likely to pose a moderate constraint.  

In particular, it is noted that community/regulator concern in relation to this issue is likely to be high 

and that perceived risks may be substantially higher than actual risks. 

Impacts Associated with Gaseous Emissions. 

Potential exists for gaseous emissions to exceed relevant emission criteria, resulting in 

environmental impacts or adverse health impacts.  In order to manage this risk the following the 

following management and mitigation measures will be required to be implemented: 

 All point source emissions will be controlled through the use of extraction fans, scrubbers, 

etc. 

 Fugitive emissions will be managed through the use of hoods and collection systems. 

Assuming that these measures are implemented, this issue is likely to pose a moderate constraint.   

20.4.9 Noise 

Existing Environment 

The noise environment surrounding the Project Site is likely to be typical of a rural environment, 

with very limited noise emissions, principally associated with agricultural operations.  In addition, 
the existing Magnesite Mine is likely to result in noise emissions that will be required to be 
considered during the noise assessment.   Background noise levels are likely to be less than the 

default Noise Policy for Industry background level of 35dBA during the day and 30dBA during the 
evening and night and noise enhancing meteorological conditions such as temperature inversions, 

are likely to be a feature of the of the environment. 

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential noise-related impacts include the following: 

 Amenity impacts at surrounding residences as a result of construction or operational 

noise. 

Potential exists for unacceptable noise levels at surrounding residences, particularly at night and 

during noise enhancing conditions (temperature inversions or gentle winds blowing from source to 
receiver).  As a result, noise management measures are likely to be required, including mitigation 

of key equipment and scheduling of particular tasks. 

Given the distance to surrounding residences, this issue is likely to pose a minor constraint.  

 Amenity impacts at surrounding residences as a result of vibration. 

Given the distances to surrounding residences, this is likely to be a negligible constraint.

 Amenity impacts at surrounding residences as a result of road or rail noise. 

Given the distance to surrounding residences, this issue is likely to pose a minor constraint. 

20.4.10 Visual Amenity 

Existing Environment 

The visual setting of the Project Site is typical of rural settings throughout the Hilltops Local 

Government Area, with views dominated by: 

 Agricultural operations, including grazing and cropping. 

 Limited native vegetation. 

 Scattered houses and buildings; and  

 Local and regional roads and their associated vehicle movements. 

Elevated sections of the Project Site are visible from surrounding areas, however, the lower, flatter 

areas where most infrastructure would be installed is well shielded by extisting vegetation. 

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Direc t/ Daytime Visual Impacts for Surrounding Residents. 

Potential exists for adverse visual amenity impacts associated with direct views of Proposal-related 

infrastructure, including heap leach pads, processing infrastructure, sulphur stockpile and waste 
rock emplacements.  In order to manage this risk, the following management and mitigation 

measures will be required to be implemented: 

 All buildings and related infrastructure will be painted a suitable non-reflective colour. 

 The sulphur stockpile will be shielded from surrounding views or sprayed with a suitable 

sealant. 

 Visual screens will be established as appropriate. 

Given the distance to surrounding residences and publicly accessible vantage points, this issue is 

likely to pose a minor constraint. 

Indirect / Night-Time Visual Impacts for Surrounding Residents. 

Potential exists for adverse visual amenity impacts associated with indirect views of Proposal-
related activities, including dust plumes, vapour/steam emissions, or night-time "loom" from lighting.  

In order to manage this risk, the following management and mitigation measures will be required to 

be implemented: 



NICO YOUNG PROJECT PEA

Page 20.38 
 

 Lighting will conform to the relevant Australian Standard. 

 Dust management measures identified above will be implemented. 

Given the limited measures available to control steam/vapour emissions and the distance from 

which such emissions may be visible, this issue is likely to pose a moderate constraint. 

20.4.11 Traffic and Transport 

Existing Environment 

Proposed transportation arrangements are described in Section 18. However, in summary, the 

Project Site would be accessed via: 

 Bribbaree Road, a local road managed by Hilltops Council; and  

 A rail spur to be constructed as part of the Proposal. 

Traffic levels on Bribbaree Road are currently low and it is likely that road upgrades prior to the 

commencement of construction operations and ongoing maintenance contributions will be required. 

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

Potential traffic and transportation-related impacts include the following: 

 Inadequate road conditions or increased traffic levels result in increased risk of traffic-

related accident, injury or fatality. 

Potential exists for traffic accidents as a result of increased traffic levels on local roads, particularly 
if those roads are not suitable for the volumes or classes of vehicles, the y traffic volume or if 

increased maintenance requirements result in decrease road performance.  in order to manage this 

risk, the following management and mitigation measures will be required to be implemented: 

 traffic and fatigue management measures will be required 

 a contribution to the maintenance or local and regional roads through a Voluntary 

Planning Agreement will be required 

 road upgrades to meet the required AustRoads standards will be required. 

Given the fact that the vast majority of mining-related fatalities are associated with road 
transportation operations, particularly associated with fatigue and long commutes to/from the 

Project Site, this issue is likely to pose a moderate to significant constraint.

20.4.12 Socio-Economic Impacts 

Table 20.4.3 presents the 2016 Census results for the Hilltops Local Government Area (LGA) 

within which the Project Site is located. For the purposes of comparison, data from NSW as a 

whole is also presented. In summary: 

 The population of the Local Government Area is 18,498 persons. 

 The full-time employment rate within the Hilltops LGA (56.9%) was slightly lower than that 

for the state (59.2%), while the part-time employment rate in the Hilltops LGA (31.8%) 
was slightly higher than the rate across NSW (29.7%). The proportion of the labour force 
that was unemployed in the Hilltops LGA (5.5%) is slightly lower than for NSW as a whole 

(6.3%). These figures indicate that the workforce within the surrounding areas is not large 
and that there is limited capacity to source a substantially proportion of the workforce 

locally.  

 Median weekly incomes were significantly lower in the Hilltops LGA than in NSW as a 
whole, however, other costs, particularly housing, are likely to be substantially lower as 

well.

Potential Impacts and Constraints 

The Proposal would likely result in a range of positive economic benefits for the surrounding 
communities.  However, these benefits are likely to be unevenly distributed with those being most 
impacted by the Proposal, (near neighbours, agricultural operations, some businesses) unlikely to 

experience significant economic benefits.  In addition, social impacts are commonly non-
quantifiable and may include disruption of communal values and cohesion or introduction of 
substantial new members to a community, reducing the attractiveness of the community to existing 

members.  A detailed social and economic assessment

Page 20.40 
 

Potential social and economic-related impacts include the following: 

 The Proposal results in unacceptably high demand for accommodation, services and 

facilities. 

 The Proposal results in increased demand for labour, increasing the cost or reducing the 

availability for other industries. 

 The Proposal results in economic or other benefits that are (or are perceived) to be 

inadequate. 

The Company will be required to undertake a detailed Social Impact Assessment, including very 

extensive consultation with the local and wider community.  That assessment will identify the 
community values that are most important to surrounding residents and, based on this, the 
Company will be required to design and implement a range of management and mitigation 

measures to ensure that the Proposal minimises potential negative social impacts. 

In light of the above, and taking into consideration the substantial and rapid change in land use and 

potential community disruption, this issue has the potential to pose a significant constraint. 

20.4.13 Other Potential Environmental Impacts 

Other potential environmental impacts associated with the Proposal include the following: 

 Increased risk of bushfire. 

 Impacts associated with hazardous materials. 

 Impacts associated with the management of waste. 

In each case, these issues are likely to pose a negligible constraint. 

20.4.14 Conclusion and Summary 

Table 20.4.4 presents a summary of the constraints identified above. In summary, the most 

significant environmental constraints upon the development of the Proposal are as follows: 

 Ecology, particularly in relation to potential impacts on threatened ecological communities 

and fauna species and the availability (or otherwise) of suitable biodiversity offset credits. 

 Soils and land capability, particularly in relation to impacts on and rehabilitation of highly 

productiove agricultural land. 

 Traffic and transportation, particularly in relation to road upgrades and potential safety 

management ssues, real or perceived.

perceived) to be inadequate. 

 

20.5 Government, Community and Social 

20.5.1 Government Agency Consultation 

Consultation with Government agencies is required at several stages throughout the application 

and assessment process. 

Conceptual Project Development Plan 

A Conceptual Project Development Plan CPDP) is prepared and submitted to the Division of 
Resources and Geoscience (DRG) within DPE for approval to commence formal government 

agency consultation. The CPDP process is typically focused on matters relation to the following: 

 Resource definition and efficient utilisation of mineral resources. 

 Mine rehabilitation and final landform concepts. 

 Mining tenure and authorisations. 

An on-site meeting with DRG is held early in the application process. 

Interagency Meeting and Application for EARs 

A Preliminary Environmental Assessment (PEA) is prepared and submitted to relevant government 
agencies in preparation for an Interagency Meeting. This document provides a brief description of 
the Project as it is understood at the time and forms the basis upon which government agencies 

provide their requirements for the EIS. Typically, an on-site Interagency Meeting (IAM) is held at 

this stage to allow the relevant government agencies to gain an appreciation of the Project. 

Following the IAM and review of the PEA, the document is formally submitted to the Department of 
Planning and Environment and the relevant government agencies provide their Environmental 

Assessment Requirements (EARs), which detail the matters that should be addressed in the EIS.

Ongoing Consultation 

One-on-one meetings with government agencies throughout the application process may be 

required to provide further detail or updates on the Proposal, and to clarify assessment and design 
requirements. This applies particularly to the Hilltops Council, Environment Protection Authority, 

DOI Water and Department of Planning and Environment. 

Submission and Assessment of the Application 

Once the draft EIS has been prepared, it is submitted to DPE for an adequacy assessment to 
ensure that it adequately addresses the EARs. The EIS is then finalised based on feedback from 
this assessment, and submitted to the DPE which places it on public exhibition for a period of at 

least 30 calendar days.  

Following the exhibition period, government agencies provide submissions detailing any issues or 

concerns they may have with the Proposal and environmental assessments presented in the EIS. 
Responses to each issue raised are prepared and submitted in a Response to Submissions (RTS) 

document. 

DPE then prepares an assessment report and recommendations for approval or refusal based on 
the EIS and RTS. If the DPE recommends approval, it typically provides draft conditions for review 

and acceptance by the Applicant. A senior DPE officer or the Independent Planning Commission 
(IPC) then determines the application. If the application is referred to the OPC, representative/s of 

the Applicant are required to attend the IPC hearing for the Proposal. 

20.5.2 Community Consultation 

Community consultation typically involves two separate but related components. 

Company Community Consultation 

Consultation with the community by the Company is required throughout the application process, 

and involves a number of elements: 

 Initial and ongoing one-on-one meetings are held with landholders within or immediately 
surrounding the Project Site to discuss the Proposal and negotiate potential access and 

acquisition arrangements. 

 A community meeting(s) is arranged to provide community members with information 

about the Proposal, answer questions where possible, and note initial issues and 
concerns raised. Follow-up meetings may be held to provide updates to the community 
as more details about the Proposal are confirmed, and the findings of environmental 

assessments are received. At these meetings, community members are invited to provide 
their contact details if they would like to receive further information and updates about the 
Proposal. Some community meetings may only be for residents living in close proximity to 

the Project Site, while others are for the wider community of the area.

 Lycopodium Minerals Pty Ltd / Jervois Mining Limited 

Page 20.44 
 

 Meetings are held with local businesses, community groups and special interest 
organisations to discuss the Proposal, potential benefits and impacts to the community 
and environment, and potential arrangements regarding matters such as employment, 

housing, and supply of goods and services.  

 One-on-one meetings may be held with individual community members who wish to 

discuss aspects of the Proposal in more detail. 

 Site visits may be arranged for individuals or groups who wish to gain a first-hand 

understanding of the Proposal and its relationship to the landscape. 

 Often, a series of Community Newsletters are distributed electronically and physically to 

inform community members of updates about the Proposal and the application and 
environmental assessment process. The contact details of the Applicant and/or the 
environmental consultancy are provided if community members wish to discuss or find 

out more information about any aspect of the Proposal. 

 Up-to-date information about the Proposal is often provided on the Applicant's website, or 

on a separate website set up specifically for the Proposal. 

 Proposal information, brochures and/or Community Newsletters may be made available 

at the Applicant's office, local libraries, community centres, businesses or other 

community hubs as appropriate. 

 When the EIS is placed on public exhibition, community members have the opportunity to 
review the EIS and prepare submissions on any matters that may concern them. As for 
government agency submissions, responses to each issue raised are prepared and 

submitted in a Response to Submissions (RTS) document. 

Social Impact Assessment 

As a State Significant Development, a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) must be undertaken for the 
Proposal in accordance with the Social impact assessment guideline for State significant mining, 

petroleum production and extractive industry development 2017. The purpose of the SIA is to 
identify, predict, evaluate and respond to the social impacts of the Proposal, so that potential 
negative social impacts of the Proposal may be minimised and positive social impacts enhanced. 

This process is separate from and independent of the consultation undertaken by the Company, 
but there are clearly points of overlap and interdependence and the Consultant who undertakes the 

SIA is typically intimately involved with the application process. 

 Social impacts to be assessed include changes to people's: 

 Way of life. 

 Community. 

 Access to and use of infrastructure, services and facilities.

 Culture. 

 Health and wellbeing. 

 Surroundings. 

 Personal and property rights. 

 Decision-making systems; and 

 Fears and aspirations. 

The SIA is undertaken in parallel to the specialist environmental assessments undertaken for the 

EIS, the results of which must be considered in the SIA. The stages of the SIA are as follows: 

 Identify and understand the Proposal's area of social influence. 

 Apply scoping methodology to identify potential material social impacts and the level of 

assessment required for the EIS. 

 Prepare a social baseline, documenting conditions and trends without the Proposal. 

 Predict changes to the baseline and trending conditions and analyse their impact. 

 Evaluate the significance of the social impacts. 

 Develop responses to social impacts and evaluate residual impacts. 

 Develop a monitoring and management framework. 

The SIA process is integrated with the community consultation process and makes use of 
information and insights gained from many of the consultation techniques described in that section. 
The SIA also involves one or more rounds of one-on-one surveys and interviews with community 

members to gain an understanding of what they value about the area they live in, and of their 
perceptions about how the Proposal may affect these values. Other engagement techniques that 
may also be used include workshops, forum, focus groups, community liaison groups, and citizen 

panels. 

The SIA is assessed in conjunction with the EIS by the DPE. 

20.6 Mine Closure  

Mine closure is a critical component of the initial mine planning process and a conceptual Mine 
Closure Plan will be required at the CPDP stage (See Section 20.5.1).  In summary, the Mine 
Closure Plan will be required to demonstrate that the Project Site, following completion of mining 

operations will:

 Be safe, stable, secure and non-polluting with land management requirements no higher 

than surrounding land. 

 Provide for sustainable final land uses, including productive land uses that include a mix 

of agriculture and nature conservation; and 

 Be acceptable to the surrounding community, future landholders and relevant 

government agencies.  

In particular, the Resources Regulator no longer accept final landforms that include multiple open 
cuts.  There will be an expectation that mining operations will be scheduled in a manner that will 
permit backfilling of open cuts throughout the life of the Project.  In addition, there is an expectation 

that land to be returned to agricultural production will achieve the same level of productivity as the 
existing land.  Given the high quality soils and highly productive cropping operations undertaken 

within the Project Site, this will be a matter that will require detailed assessment and management. 

The PEA and EIS will be required to include detailed descriptions of the proposed Mine Closure 
Plan.  However, following granting of development consent and prior to the commencement of 

Mining operations, a detailed Mining Operations Plan (MOP) will be required to be prepared and 
approved by the Resources Regulator.  The MOP will include specific, measurable, achievable, 
realistic and time-bound commitments, with defined completion criteria.  Preparation of the MOP 

typically requires substantial resources and commitment by the Company prior to the 

commencement of mining operations. 

20.7 Recommended Works Program  

Figure 20.7.1 presents the conceptual timeline for completion of the application for Development 

Consent for the Proposal.  It is noted that this timeline has been prepared prior to engagement of 
all required specialist consultants and finalisation of the project description.  As a result, the 
proposed timeline should be considered indicative only.  Substantial variance from this timetable is 

possible depending the timeliness of the development of the final project design/description, 
whether issues are identified by the specialist consultant team and the resources dedicated to 

completion of the required works. 

The following works are required to complete the application for Development Consent: 

 Prepare a reasonably definitive Project Site layout and project description.  This 
information will be used for government agency and community consultation, specialist 
consultant assessments and EIS preparation.  Substantial changes to the project Site 

layout or project description after this point will require rework and potential delays.  Minor 

adjustments are likely and should not significantly impact on the application process. 

 Prepare a Briefing Paper and Preliminary Environmental Assessment for circulation to the 
relevant government agencies and specialist consultant team.  This document will 
typically become a public document and must be consistent with previous Company ASX 

and related announcements.

 Engage the remaining specialist consultant team, including consultants to address the 

following components: 

- traffic and transportation 

- social Impact Assessment (SIA) – this component is particularly important as 
the initial Scoping Phase of the SIA is required to be completed prior to the 

application for Environmental Assessment Requirements 

- economic assessment. 

 Recommence the existing specialist studies, with the following components of particular 

importance: 

- soils and land capability assessment, with a particular focus on obtaining the 
information required for the Gateway Certificate 

- heritage assessment, with a particular focus on ensuring that all areas of likely 
disturbance are assessed 

- ecology assessment, in particular, ensuring that all targeted searches are 
completed are the appropriate time to year and that the strategy for 

obtaining/securing the relevant biodiversity offset credits is determined 

- noise and air quality assessments, with a particular focus on developing and 
assessing realistic construction, operational and post-closure scenarios. 

 Commence formal government agency consultation, including: 

- completing the Conceptual Project Development Plan process with the Division 
or Resources and Energy 

- convening and participating in an on-site Interagency Meeting 

- making application for the Environmental Assessment Requirements for the 
Proposal; and 

- one-on-one consultation in relation to particular issues such as water licensing, 
Gateway Certificates etc. 

 Commence community consultation, including: 

- one-on-one consultation with landholders within and immediately surrounding 
the Project Site, with a particular focus on obtaining non-revokable access the 

land required for the Proposal; and 

- wider community and specialist interest group consultation.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

21.1 Summary 

Capital and operating costs were developed for the 3.0 Mtpa process, including a refinery to 
produce nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphide as products.  While the bulk of the estimate was 

prepared at the study level of accuracy, ± 25%, the refinery component was only estimated at the 
concept / scoping study level of ± 35%, as a result of lack of supporting detail for this process. The 

overall capital cost estimate is considered to be at the  ± 25% accuracy level as of 1Q19.   

The capital estimate address the engineering, procurement, construction, and start-up of the mine 
and processing facilities, as well as the ongoing sustaining capital costs.  Total initial capital cost 

for the 3.0 Mtpa process with refinery is estimated at AUD 1,112.5 M. This initial expenditure is 
envisioned to be completed over a 48 month construction schedule, with heap leach and 
production commencing progressively over this period.  The capital cost estimate is summarised in

21.2.3 Capital Cost Basis of Estimate 

Base Currency and Estimate Base Date 

All capital cost estimates are presented in Australian Dollars (AUD). A base rate of first quarter 

2019 is applicable to the estimate.  

No allowance has been made for escalation between the estimate base date and the time at which 

commitments will actually be incurred, and payments made. 

Estimate Class and Accuracy 

The estimate has been prepared generally in accordance with Lycopodium's requirements for a 
Class 3 pre-feasibility study estimate, the accuracy range of which is deemed to be +/-25%. 
However, the exception is that the refinery component was estimated at a concept/scoping study 

level of accuracy,( ± 35%) and consequently the overall level of accuracy is slightly lower.  This is a 

result of a lack of metallurgical testwork to support the refinery component. 

Qualifications and Assumptions 

The following general qualifications and assumptions have been made in assembling the capital 

cost estimates: 

 The Capital Cost Estimate (CCE) has been based on the implementation of an EPCM 

contracting strategy. 

 A construction camp will be established during the construction period (4 years duration) 

on a Build Own Operate contract basis. The costs of this contract are included in the 

financial model. 

 No dedicated operations camp will be provided for the Project.  Operating personnel will 

be accommodated within Young or nearby towns. 

 There is no allowance for unforeseen blasting and excavation of rock in the earthworks. 

 Power will be generated by a combination of a steam turbine associated with the 

sulphuric acid plant (approx. 35 MW) and by diesel generators (approx.14 MW) for black 
start of the acid plant.  No allowance has been made to connect to the state grid power 

supply. 

 The capital cost estimate for the heap leach facility, residue storage facility was provided 

by Land and Marine Geological Services Pty Ltd (L&MGSPL). 

Exclusions 

The following items are excluded from the capital cost estimate: 

 Sunk costs, including prior testwork, drilling and studies.

supplied equipment and technology. 

The estimate has been prepared and based on the following key documentation: 

 Process flow diagrams. 

 Mechanical equipment list. 

 General plant layout drawings. 

Engineering Status 

The design status varies across plant areas due to the level of detail available and actual design 
work undertaken.  The design has utilised recently completed facility designs from other like 

projects and studies, and modified construction and as-built drawings of past project facilities.  The 
level of design undertaken varies from initial concept drawings through to reconfiguration of 

existing plant layouts and quantity take-offs generated specifically for the Project. 

Equipment sizes and materials of construction are as specified in the mechanical equipment list, 
and have been designed to suit the mass balance and process design criteria, while utilising 

information from previous similar plants where possible.

Supply Costs 

The bulk of mechanical equipment supply prices were obtained from quotations provided by 

Chinese equipment vendors via Vanture International Joint Venture.  The quality and detail 
provided with these quotations was not at the same level as provided by typical Western vendor 
quotations for the same equipment.  For the purpose of developing the capital estimate, 

Lycopodium has accepted these quotations at face value and consequently there is an increased 
level of risk associated with the estimate.  For certain items Chinese quotations were not supported 
with adequate technical specifications.  In these instances, Western equipment quotations were 

used in their place.  Late changes to the overall material balance required Lycopodium to adjust 

equipment supply prices based on its historical data base. 

The supply cost for the sulphuric acid plant and cogeneration facility has been based on a Lump 
sum turnkey quotation from the Chinese vendor via ARC-Vanture JV. Only limited information was 
provided by the vendor, and whilst the vendor has significant international experience in the 

construction of sulphuric acid plants, this would be their first plant in Australia. For the purpose of 
developing the capital estimate, Lycopodium has accepted this quotation at face value and 

consequently there is an increased level of risk associated with the estimate. 

The supply cost for the products refinery was obtained by factoring costs supplied by JRV from 
their internal information for this process.  There was no available design criteria or metallurgical 

test work to enable first principles sizing and design of equipment.  Consequently, this cost can 
only be considered to be at a concept/scoping level accuracy.  The refinery installed cost amounts 

to approximately 34% of the total treatment plant installed cost of $289 M. 

Fabrication Costs 

Structural steel and platework fabrication costs have been based on Australian based fabricators 

for the estimate. 

There may be savings to be realised in fabrication rates (offset to some extent by increases in 

freight rates) if Asian based fabricators were used. 

There is potential to further explore this option during a future phase of the Project. 

Installation Costs 

Installation rates have been utilised from a recent similar project in regional NSW. 

Quoted installation costs included direct labour, equipment, and contractors' indirect costs. 

The labour component reflects the cost of the direct workforce required to construct the Project, 

being the product of the estimated working hours spent on site multiplied by the cost of labour to 
the contractor, inclusive of overtime premiums, statutory overheads, payroll burden and contractor 

margin. 

Manhours for all disciplines are based on Australian norms for recent completed installations, with 

a productivity factor of 1.25 having been applied.

The equipment component reflects the cost of the construction equipment and running costs 
required to construct the Project.  It also small tools, consumables, PPE, and the applicable 

contractor margin. 

Contractors' distributable costs encompass the remaining cost of installation and include items 
such as off-site management, on-site staff and supervision above trade level, cranes, crane drivers, 

mobile equipment, mobilisation and demobilisation, R&R, meals and accommodation, and the 

applicable contractor margin. 

The following distributable costs are included in the capital estimate: 

 Project construction offices and establishment. 

 Communications. 

 Computers, IT services, servers, and telephones. 

 Construction services that include power, water, fuel (facilities provided by the individual 

contractors), consumables, PPE, and costs for meals and accommodation. 

 Local indirect labour for installation support. 

Contractor distributable costs are typically estimated as a percentage of the direct cost component.  

Contractor distributable costs by discipline are shown in Table 21.2.4.

A separate allowance is made for the provision of trade labour from the E&I contractor to assist 

with plant commissioning. 

Freight and Import Duty Costs 

Project freight has been estimated on a per line item basis and is calculated as either freight tons 

or a percentage of the supply cost. 

No allowance has been made for import duty costs.

Management Costs 

The Project will be implemented using an EPCM approach, whereby the EPCM Engineer will 

provide design, procurement, construction management, project management and commissioning 

supervision services on behalf of the Owner, based on the agreed project schedule. 

The EPCM services estimate allows for the cost of home office and site staffing, sub-consultants, 

office consumables, equipment, and associated project travel. 

The EPCM costs for the Project has been estimated as $1 M for supervision of the acid plant 
(LSTK contract) and 16% general plant direct costs and $3.85 M for the heap leach as advised by 

L&MGSPL. 

Included in management costs is an estimate for specialist vendor representatives expected to be 

required to assist with construction verification and commissioning. 

Owners Costs 

Owner's project team costs cover: 

 Owner's project management team. 

 Insurance. 

 Licensing and permit costs. 

 Pre-production labour costs (prior to introducing ore to the plant). 

Other items included in the overall estimate of Owner's costs include: 

 Land acquisition for raw water supply easement. 

 First fills (consumables, lubricants, fuel, and reagents). 

 Mobile equipment. 

 Project spares.  An allowance has been included to cover both capital and initial 

operating spares. 

Contingency 

The contingency allowance is shown as a separate amount in the CCE and has been applied on a 

WBS line-by-line basis in accordance with Lycopodium's estimating guidelines. 

Contingency has been provided to cover anticipated variances between the specific items included 

the estimate and the final total installed project cost.  The contingency does not cover scope 

changes etc., or the listed qualifications and exclusions.

Contingency has been applied in a deterministic manner by assessing the level of confidence in 
each of the defined item cost inputs.  It should be noted that contingency is not a function of the 
specified estimate accuracy, and should be measured against the project total that includes 

contingency. 

21.3 Process Plant Operating Costs 

The Processing Plant component of the operating cost estimates are based on the process design 
criteria, mass balances, process flowsheets and mechanical equipment list.  Four operating costs 

are represented in total.  A life of mine and three individual ore types are presented, with operating 

costs calculated for the Refinery (Nickel Sulphate and Cobalt Sulphide Production) flowsheets. 

The operating costs are represented individually in the following documents and can be viewed in 

reference 14:

21.3.1 Accuracy of Estimate 

The methodology and data collection strategies applied during the development of the operating 
cost estimate are in accordance with Lycopodium's standards for a PEA Study and are sufficient to 

support a ± 25% level of accuracy, with the exception of the operating cost information associated 
with the refinery section of the processing plant (solvent extraction, nickel sulphate and cobalt 
sulphide production), which is only at considered to be at an accuracy of ± 35%.  It is also noted 

that the supply cost of sulphur has been forecast out over the period of mine operations by Integer, 

a global fertilizer consultancy, and is not a 4Q2018 price. 

21.3.2 Process Plant Operating Cost Summaries 

Cost estimates are shown in AUD dollars and summarised by the major Cost Items, along with an 

indication of the annualised operating cost in AUD dollars per tonne of ore processed.  The relative 
division of the process plant operating costs is also shown in graphical form, highlighting the major 

operating cost items.

 Demurrage costs. 

 Construction accommodation camp BOO contract fee. 

 Short term rental of skid mounted packaged boiler for black start steam. 

21.3.5 Base Date and Exchange Rates 

In general, as per Lycopodium's standard practice, all estimates are referenced to a standard base 

date.  For this estimate the base date of all estimates except that of supply cost of sulphur is Q4 
2018.  The supply cost of sulphur has been provided by Integer, a global fertilizer consultancy, and 
is based on their price forecasts over the period from 2021 to 2041.  This is an important 

consideration because the sulphur supply cost has been projected to decline significantly over this 

time, and the cost of sulphur contributes greater than 30% of the total process plant operating cost. 

The operating cost model base currency is the Australian Dollar (AUD).  The majority of the 
operating cost information was supplied in Australian Dollars (AUD).  Any conversion required from 
US$ used a conversion rate of US$0.70 = A$1.00.  The base date and exchange rates utilised for 

the operating cost derivation are consistent with the capital cost estimate. 

21.3.6 Start-Up Costs 

The operating cost estimate is inclusive of all production costs from the commencement of the 

commissioning on ore feed phase through to the end of production. 

The estimate excludes the following start-up and cessation costs: 

 Pre-commissioning costs (included in capital cost estimate). 

 Packaged boiler for start-up steam and associated fuel cost. 

 Black start power generation fuel requirement. 

 Initial inventory and/or first fill costs (included in capital cost estimate). 

 Pre-production costs (included in capital cost estimate). 

 Decommissioning costs. 

 Rehabilitation costs. 

21.3.7 Operating Cost Items 

The operating cost estimate has been assembled through a collection of data to satisfy the 

following seven main cost item categories: 

 Reagents.

 Contract and Consulting Expenses. 

Each Cost Item contains a number of sub-cost items. 

21.4 Recommendations 

In the next project phase the following activities related to capital cost estimation are 

recommended: 

 Enter into detailed discussions and bid evaluation with the Chinese equipment vendors to 

ensure that the actual scope required is covered by the bids they have provided. 

 Enter into detailed discussion and technology evaluation with the Chinese vendor for the 
sulphuric acid plant to ensure that the full scope required is included in their bid, and that 
the source of their technology is valid and justified.  Negotiation between the Chinese 

vendor and an Australian construction contractor will be required to ensure that valid 

construction costs for Australia are identified. 

 Enter into discussions with the Chinese vendor for the sulphuric acid plant to include the 
black start power and steam requirements for the sulphuric acid plant as part of the acid 

plant scope. 

 Continue discussion with Essential Energy to identify costs for back up power by 

connection to the NSW electricity grid. 

 Undertake further engineering and estimate development for the products refinery 

component of the flowsheet when metallurgical testwork results become available. 

Several opportunities exist to lower the overall operating cost and these include: 

 Further investigation of the alternative supply of supplementary power from the NSW 

state grid. 

 Further assessment of the alternatives for construction camp construction and operation 

during the four year extended construction phase.

 Long term negotiations with suppliers of major consumables, sulphur, magnesia and lime 

to lock in more stable long term supply costs. 

 Further investigation of the options for importation and transport of major consumables to 

site including port alternatives and rail options. 

A number of risks must also be included including:

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Economic Analysis 

JRV has prepared its evaluation and assessment of the Nico Young Nickel Cobalt project based on 
a discounted cash flow model, from which the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return 
(IRR), payback, and other measures of the project pre-feasibility are determined.  The economic 

assessments are generally accepted as a process of identifying, calculating and comparing the 
costs and benefits of mining projects to evaluate their merit, after consideration of the initial capital 

investment and operating expenses. 

The main objective of this report is to determine the potential economic viability of the proposed 
open pits and processing of the material at a modern industrial facility to exploit the Nico Young 

deposits.  For this analysis, the cash flow arising from the base case of the project has been 
forecasted, allowing for the calculation of the NPV and IRR.  The sensitivity of these measures to 

changes in the base case assumptions are then examined. 

The preliminary economic assessment within this study is preliminary in nature and includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 

considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorised as mineral reserves. 
There is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realised.  There has been 
no Ore Reserve estimate developed.  There is no certainty that further exploration work will result 

in the determination of adequate measured and indicated mineral resources or that the production 
targets underlying the study will be realised.  Further evaluation work and appropriate studies in 
DFS are required to establish sufficient confidence that this target will be met.  This preliminary 

economic assessment was determined based on assumptions as laid out in chapter [X].  Despite 
its early nature, this preliminary economic assessment is considered to be sufficiently promising to 
move forward into the next phase of drilling and then study, particularly in light of the commodity 

outlook for nickel and cobalt relating to the electrification of the global transportation industry. 

22.2 Forward-Looking Information 

This technical report contains forward-looking information regarding the results of the economic 
analysis that is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause 

the following actual results to differ materially from those presented.  The actual results may be 

affected by the following: 

 Different macro-economic outcomes including interalia those applying to nickel and cobalt 
base prices and commercial sale terms, realised foreign exchange rates and consumable 

costs including (but not exclusively) sulphur, limestone and quicklime. 

 Unexpected variations in quantity of mineralised material, grade or recovery rates, or the 

presence of deleterious elements that would affect the process plant or waste disposal. 

 Unexpected geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions from what was assumed in the 

mine designs, including water management and site preparation work.

 Differences in the timing and amount of estimated future saleable product production, 
costs of future saleable product production, sustaining capital requirements, future 
operating costs, requirements for additional capital, unexpected failure of plant, 

equipment or processes not operating as anticipated. 

 Unexpected regulatory risks and delays and associated compliance directives thereto. 

 Unexpected regulatory risks and delays and associated necessary response thereto; and, 

 Unexpected social risks, higher closure costs and unanticipated closure requirements. 

Forward-looking statements in this Report include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 

the future prices of saleable product, the estimation of Mineral Resources, the estimated mine 
production and Nickel and Cobalt recovered, the estimated capital and operating costs, and the 

estimated cash flows generated from planned operations. 

22.3 Assumptions 

22.3.1 Macro Economic Assumptions 

The main economic assumptions used in the base case are presented in Table 22.3.1.   

Life of mine nickel base (LME) price of USD/lb 8.00 was chosen.  This pricing level is consistent 
with consensus investment bank and research analyst expectations, and at the lower end of 

forecast incentive prices required to stimulate the required level of investment in order for future 
nickel supply to reconcile with projected metal demand.  It is also consistent with nickel industry 

standards for studies recently published. 

Life of mine cobalt base (Metal Bulletin HGH) price of USD/lb 30.00 was also adopted.  Cobalt is 
undergoing a rapid and transformative transition as the electrification of the global transportation 

sector gathers pace.  The pricing level selected again is consistent with consensus investment 
bank and research analyst expectations as future cobalt pricing levels are projected to be 
sustainably above those occurring historically.  It is also consistent with cobalt industry standards 

for studies recently published.   

The specific commercial forecasts for the saleable product grade were based on projections from 

the market study presented in Section 15.  The nickel sulphate premia applied in the study, of 
US$1.50/per lb of contained nickel, is lower than both current premia levels and research analyst 

forecasts. 

Sensitivity analysis to key inputs is also included.

Table 22.3.1 Macro Economic Assumptions 

 Unit Base Case Value 

Nickel (LME) price USD/pound 8.00

Nickel sulphate premium (FOB New South Wales) USD/pound 1.50

Cobalt (Metal Bulletin) price (High Grade High) USD/pound 30.00

Exchange rate  AUD$=USD$  0.70

Real discount rate  % per period  8.0

Inflation % 2.5

Corporate tax rate (Australia) % 30.0

 

An exchange rate of 0.70 USD per AUD was used to convert operating and capital costs (which are 

largely denominated in AUD) into USD.  This AUD-USD exchange rate assumption is close to 
current market rates and is also consistent with investment bank economists long term forecasts.  
The sensitivity of the base case financial results to variations in the exchange rate was examined.  

Those cost components which include U.S. content originally converted to Australian currency 
using the base case exchange rate were adjusted accordingly.  For sensitivity analysis it is assumed 

25% of operating costs and 15% of capital costs are denominated in USD. 

In calculating the NPV of the cash flow forecast of the project, a base case discount factor must be 
used which represents the average cost of capital imposed on the project by the capital markets.  

The cash flow projections used for the project are assessed on an ungeared basis and discounted 
at a rate consistent with general market expectations of a sponsor weighted average cost of capital 

("WACC"). 

It is to be noted that the preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 

considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and 

there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

22.3.2 Royalty 

The only royalty on the project is a New South Wales State royalty of 4.0% of net revenue less 

allowable deductions.  There are no privately held royalties 

22.3.3 Technical Assumptions

 Macro economic and marketing assumptions outlined herein; and, 

 Capital and operating cost estimates detailed in Section 21. 

22.4 Financial Model and Results 

A summary of the base case results is given in Table 22.4.1. 

Table 22.4.1 Project Cost Economic Evaluation Summary 

Item Unit Value 

Total Revenue USD M real 7,076.4

Total Operating Costs (includes Off Site Costs & Royalties) USD M real 4,318.3

Initial Capital Costs (excludes Working Capital & Closure Cost) USD M real 778.8

Sustaining Capital Costs USD M real 317.8

Total Before-tax Cash Flow (including all capital) USD M real 1,687.1

Before-tax NPV @ 8% real discount rate USD M 341,1

Before-tax nominal IRR % 16.9

After-tax Payback Period (from Technical Completion) Years 5.6

After-tax NPV @ 8% real discount rate USD M 179.6

After-tax nominal IRR % 14.4

 

The project cost economic evaluation summary and cash flow statement indicate that the total 
project capital costs were evaluated at USD 778.8M.  This includes all initial project capital up to 
the achievement and stabilisation of nameplate capacity.  The life of mine sustaining capital 

requirement was evaluated at USD 317.8M.  A closure cost provision is included in the open pit 

and underground operating cost per tonne. 

The cash flow statement shows a capital cost breakdown by area and provides an estimated 
capital spending schedule over the four-year construction period for the Project, with 
commissioning commencing within two years.  Working capital requirements were estimated basis 

the teams' expertise in operating similar flowsheets and added to total annual operating costs.  
Since operating costs vary annually over the LOM, additional amounts of working capital may be 

injected or withdrawn as required. 

The total revenue derived from the sale of the saleable product from the processing plant was 
estimated at USD 7,076.4M (USD 5,269.9M from Nickel and USD 1,779.5M from cobalt), or on 

average, USD 120/tonne processed.  The total site and offsite operating costs, including all 

royalties, were estimated at USD 4,318. 3M, or on average, USD 73/tonne processed.

The financial results indicate a before-tax NPV of USD 341.1M at a real discount rate of 8.0%.  The 

before-tax nominal IRR is 16.9% and positive cash flow starts the first operating year once initial 

capital has been completed. 

The after-tax NPV is USD 179.6M at a real discount rate of 8.0%.  The after-tax nominal IRR is 

14.4%. 

It is to be noted that the preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and 

there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.

The Nico Young Project is an advanced exploration and development project that is focused on 

nickel cobalt laterite deposits located in farm land near the town of Young in NSW. JRV has been 
drill testing the deposits periodically since 1998 with two programs undertaken in 2018 aimed at 

infilling the hole pattern and obtaining core for metallurgical testwork and density determinations. 

The geological setting of the Ardnaree and Thuddungra deposits is reasonably well understood, 
notwithstanding that majority of the deposits are drilled at spacings too great to confer an Indicated 

status to the Mineral Resource estimate in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The resource 
block model blocks were flagged as Inferred, Indicated or unclassified based on the following 

guidelines: 

 Whilst the results from the QC analysis are not ideal, they are not sufficient to render the 

data unsuitable for resource estimation. 

 Mining studies will be invariably based on shallow open pit mining. 

 Indicated Resources were flagged in the model using a closed wireframe solid for the 
Limonite/Saprolite domain for blocks supported by 100 m x 100 m nominal drillhole 
spacing with Ni and Mg grade data. All other 2000 and 3000 domain mineralisation was 

classified as inferred.  

 The vertical extrapolation in the Serpentinite/Saprock zone was set to 35 m below the 

base of the saprolite surface. All blocks below this level were flagged as unclassified.

 All blocks in the granite and undifferentiated sediments were flagged as unclassified.\ 

25.1.1 Drilling Conditions 

Drilling conditions in restricted zones are less than ideal due to high-level groundwater, sticky clays 
and ball-bearing/marble sized iron-quartz pisolites, with conditions more problematic at 

Thuddungra compared with Ardnaree. In order to understand the extent of the issue the historic 
data was reviewed and several programs of potentially problematic drilling or sampling conditions 
and these were flagged in JRV's global database to be excluded from Mineral Resource estimates 

were identified. There are potentially some historical aircore samples of uncertain quality remaining 

in the database. 

25.1.2 Sample Preparation 

As described by ALS and SGS, the sample preparation procedures conform to standard industry 

practice and are considered adequate by the author. 

25.1.3 Security 

Little has been left to chance in the security of samples in the field, in transit from the field to JRV's 

storage facility in Young, and in despatch of samples and core from Young to the laboratories. 

For early programs, sample splits performed by JRV personnel were supervised by JRV 
Exploration Management, with samples securely bagged and labelled, and either independently 

transported by road haulage to ALS Brisbane or transported by JRV personnel to ALS Orange. 

25.1.4 Continuous Improvement Program 

As part of its Continuous Improvement Program, JRV instituted new Standard Operating 
Procedures in the lead up to the winter 2018 aircore program at Thuddungra and Ardnaree. All 

aircore samples, once split, were delivered by JRV personnel to ALS Laboratories (Orange) to 
ensure Chain-of-Custody. Sample numbering methodology was brought into line with standard 

industry practice by allocation of unique sample numbers, including standards and blanks. 

For majority of samples, JRV has elected to determine Ni, Co and other elemental concentrations 
by ICP methods. The ICP analytical procedures are acceptable for use in Mineral Resource 

estimates; however, confidence in the estimates is lower than if fused disc/XRF methods were 
used. The fused disc/XRF method is considered standard industry analytical practice in nickel 

laterites and is now employed by JRV. 

25.1.5 Geological and Assay Database 

In 2017 and 2018, JRV engaged OMI and Geostats to compile a Microsoft Access relational 
database to store geological and sample information that had previously been recorded in 
individual Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. JRV supplied original ALS assay certificates in pdf and 

csv formatted electronic files, as well as ALS QC certificates to OMI and Geostats. JRV and 
Geostats supplied copies of the Microsoft Excel drill log files and ALS assay pdf and csv electronic 

files.

The Microsoft Excel drill log records and original ALS assay certificates were reviewed and 
compared with the records in the OMI/Geostats Microsoft Access database. No material 
discrepancies were identified. ALS assay certificates could not be found for approximately 3% of 

records used in the Mineral Resource estimates. In these instances, the unverified ALS AAS-A102 
Ni and Co assays were copied exactly from the entries contained in the Microsoft Excel drill log 
records. The distribution and tenor of the ALS AAS-A102 Ni and Co assays were reviewed and 

found to have no material impact on the Mineral Resource estimates. 

The author's opinion is that the data is sufficiently adequate to support Mineral Resource estimates 

reported herein and used for mine planning studies. 

The author is not aware of any issues that materially affect the Mineral Resources in a detrimental 

sense. 

25.2 Mining 

Mining at Nico Young can be completed with conventional truck and shovel mining methods.  It is 
anticipated that blasting will not be necessary. The orebodies are flat lying.  Waste overburden will 

be stripped on 4 m benches, and ore on 2 m flitches for additional selectivity.  Loading will be with 

190-t excavators and haulage with 90-t trucks. 

Reverse circulation (RC) grade control drilling will be completed at 10 m x 10 m spacing to define 

the waste/ore boundary ahead of mining.  

Mined-out pits will be backfilled with mine waste to surface.  Temporary external dumps will be 
utilised when no pit void is available at the time of mining.  There are no permanent waste dumps. 

Ore will be transported to a central leach pad or stockpiles near each deposit (for low grade). 

25.3 Metallurgical Test Work 

Metallurgical testwork, including material characterisation, geometallurgical evaluation, 
agglomeration optimisation, geotechnical and hydrodynamic testwork, bottle roll and column leach 
testing as well as neutralisation testwork and investigation of flowsheets for direct solvent 

extraction and Ni sulphate crystallization were undertaken for this study. 

The testwork confirmed the amenability of the Ardnaree ore types to Heap Leaching. Sufficient 

testing was conducted along with data interpretation and testwork scale-up to generate the 
necessary inputs for the Process Design Criteria. The key design inputs are summarised in the 

Table below.

25.4 Recovery Methods 

The Nico Young Process Plant, developed from inputs from the metallurgical testwork, involves a 
crushing, agglomerating, stacking and heap leaching facility, followed by solution neutralisation and 
nickel and cobalt recovery via a refinery, consisting of solvent extraction, nickel crystallisation and 

cobalt sulphide precipitation. 

Two distinct ore throughput rates were studied within the PEA. An initial 1 Mtpa case was 

engineered to produce a mixed nickel / cobalt hydroxide product (MHP). Capital and operating 
costs of this 1 Mtpa case identified that the project economics would benefit from higher plant 
throughput and higher value added products, and as such, the throughput was raised to 3 Mtpa 

and the MHP product circuit was replaced with the Refinery. 

Testwork indicated that individual ore types had differing extraction and acid consumption 

facilitating the need to generate mass balance and operating cost data for each ore type. 

Table 25.1.2 provides a summary of the key processing design criteria for the 3 Mtpa case with 

refinery.

The process plant consists of a number of major sections, which have different planned operating 

schedules.  The major sections are: 

 Crushing, agglomeration and stacking. 

 Heap leaching. 

 Solution processing plant. 

 Nickel and Cobalt Refinery. 

 Acid plant and Power Station. 

 Residue Storage Facility (RSF). 

The nickel and cobalt refinery consists of a number of sections: 

 Separation of cobalt and nickel values by solvent extraction. 

 Precipitation of a cobalt sulphide product. 

 Crystallisation of a nickel sulphate product. 

 Packaging of the separate cobalt and nickel products and shipment. 

Major plant infrastructure consists of raw and process water supply systems, storm water handling 

and storage areas for leach residues, iron precipitates, manganese and magnesium precipitates.

The mass balances for the process were initially prepared using the METSIM simulation software 
package, and subsequently with SysCAD plant simulation software.  The balances incorporated the 

mass flows of metals, hydroxyl and sulphate ions, oxygen, carbon and steam / water.   

Engineering deliverables prepared for the study included process design criteria, mass balances, 

process flow diagrams, mechanical equipment lists and process plant layouts. 

Major reagents used within the process plant include sulphur (for sulphuric acid production), 
limestone, lime and magnesia. Major plant infrastructure required includes a sulphuric acid plant 

(complete with co-generated steam power plant), rail infrastructure for sulphur delivery, and water 

pipeline infrastructure for raw water supply. 

25.5 Economic Assessment 

A financial model was constructed based geological and mining inputs from Snowden and 

operating and capital costs generated by Lycopodium. 

The financial results indicate a before-tax NPV of USD 341.1M at a real discount rate of 8.0%.  The 

before-tax nominal IRR is 16.9% and positive cash flow starts the first operating year once initial 

capital has been completed. 

The after-tax NPV is USD 179.6M at a real discount rate of 8.0%.  The after-tax nominal IRR is 

14.4%. 

Nico Young has acceptable financial returns relative to the technical risks and capital associated 
with the flowsheet versus alternative, higher capital intensity processing routes for nickel / cobalt 
laterites.  Further work is planned during Definitive Feasibility Study to further optimise economic 

returns. 

It is to be noted that the preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes 
inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and 

there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Resource 

Snowden recommend the following further activities related to Resource Estimation: 

 Currently, the Nico Young Mineral Resources are classified largely as Inferred due to the 
wide spaced drill pattern.  Infill drilling to a pattern of 100 m x 50 m should be considered 
by JRV to achieve, as a minimum, the establishment of a large component of Indicated 

Resources, provided that drilling and sampling conditions are adequate and that JRV's 

comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures are followed. 

 Future drill programs should consider better ways of keeping the cyclone clean by using 

low friction liners (such as ceramic tiles) or mechanical wipers inside the cyclone. 

 Initial follow-up aircore drilling program at a spacing of 100m x 50m for a planned total of 
186 holes for 6253 metres.  Drillhole planning has been guided by initial pit shells 
generated and has been targeted to bring the Mineral Resource estimate on the 

Ardnaree deposit up to Indicated classification over all pit shells except pit 8 at the 
southern end of the Ardnaree deposit. Pit 8 is anticipated to be mined late in the 

preliminary mining schedule.  Total budget for this drilling is $680,000.

TOTALS $679,500 5 Months 

 

 Further infill drilling on the Thuddungra deposit should also be completed at a spacing of 
100 m x 50 m.  At the time of this report, insufficient results had been received from the 
July to September 2018 drilling program on the Thuddungra deposit to allow accurate 

planning.  Planning for the Thuddungra deposit infill drilling is expected to be conducted 

in early 2019.

 A pattern of close spaced drilling (5 m x 5 m) should be considered in select areas of 
Cobalt mineralisation to aid in future grade control drill spacing analysis and to test short 

range continuity of Cobalt mineralisation. 

 More cost efficient methods for relative density measurements should be investigated 
such as down hole nuclear densometer.  Such downhole methods would require casing 

drillholes but may be more cost effective than drill core and wrapped immersion 

techniques that are also time consuming. 

26.2 Mining 

The following activities are recommended to be completed as a priority to improve confidence in 

the mine plan: 

 Further drilling to improve the confidence in the Mineral Resource estimate to bring it to 

Indicated Resource classification to support the potential for Mineral Reserve estimates. 

 Geotechnical drilling and analysis to provide confidence in the slope design, 

excavatability and trafficability. 

 Full water and environmental review to identify any risks for practical mine planning. 

 Further work to improve confidence in the underlying technical and economic parameters 

of the project. This includes: 

- development of a geometallurgical program with associated modelling.  This 
should aim to define metallurgical recoveries and acid requirements for all 

material types and by grade 

- refinement and additional support for operating costs through sourcing of 
quotations from the market. 

 Revision of the mine plan to consider all updated information. 

26.3 Metallurgical Testing 

 The testwork conducted to date has concentrated on the Ardnaree deposit and providing 
sufficient information to support the PFS.  It has been assumed that the Thuddungra 
deposit ore types will behave similarly to that of Ardnaree but this must be proven in the 

next phase of study. 

 Based on an improved geological, mining, metallurgical and geometallurgical 

understanding it is necessary to undertake significant additional drilling to provide 

sufficient representative samples of ore types and potential ore type variability.

 The following metallurgical testwork has been identified as necessary to support the basis 
of a definitive feasibility study (DFS).  Samples should be collected from future definition 
drilling planned to completed as part of the DFS from the Ardnaree and Thuddungra 

deposits that make up the Nico Young project. 

The recommended testwork is broken down into four broad categories: 

 GeoMetallurgical Testing. 

 Material Characterisation and Batch Column Leach Testing. 

 Batch Neutralisation and DSX testing. 

 Integrated Pilot Plant for generation of marketing samples. 

 

It is anticipated that the testwork program would take approximately 18 months to complete. 

26.4 Process Plant 

 The sulphuric acid plant size has been selected based on the current annual mine plan.  
As more detailed mine plans become available the acid plant size and acid plant bulk 
storage capacity needs to be re-assessed to ensure that the plant is sufficiently sized to 

accommodate variations in ore type that will present to the plant over the life of mine. 

 It is recommended that different leaching techniques be considered which may reduce 

water consumption, acid consumption and improve overall nickel and cobalt recoveries, 

without the requirement for a large footprint area associated with heap leaching.  

 A trade-off study between different known / operating leaching circuits should be 
employed, taking parameters such as acid consumption, recovery, nickel ore grade, 

residue production and storage and water balance into consideration. 

26.5 Supply Transport and Logistics 

Lycopodium Infrastructure recommends the following activities to be undertaken in the next project 

phase: 

 It is recommended JRV consider the findings presented in Supply Transport and Logistics 
report and enter into further negotiations with the preferred Port owners to define the 
specific scope of work for materials handling facilities and the costs and charges 

associated. 

 It is further recommended that JRV consider the most economic and acceptable form or 

transport to the Mine, develop a specific scope of services for the preferred transport 
case and seek MoU's with preferred transport operators or go to market for pricing for a 

specific transport task.

 JRV to consider the cost of on site sulphuric acid production compared to the additional 

Net Present Cost of transporting sulphuric acid as presented in this report. 

 Undertaken preliminary design of the proposed rail alignment from Weedalion to site by 
obtaining site survey, land title information including mining exploration lease details and 

commissioning a consultancy to complete the design. 

 JRV to consider the FOB costs of importing reagents into the Ports considered in the 

study in deciding which Port options to take into the next stage.  

26.6 Project Infrastructure 

26.6.1 Surface Infrastructure and Layout 

The following recommendations for further work related to site surface infrastructure supply are 

made: 

 Optimise the layout to minimise the extent of area overlap across the lease boundaries. 

 Survey possible routing for the raw water pipeline easement. 

 Survey possible routing for the railway spur into the site. 

 Identify a suitable location for the construction camp. 

 Evaluate the extent of road upgrades required for the project. 

The following recommendations for further work related to project hydrogeology are made: 

 Dewatering – Four of the proposed pit areas extend below the water table and will require 

dewatering.  Sump pumping will be required to abstract groundwater inflows and surface 
water run off during the wet season.  Feasibility level designs and cost estimates will be 

required. 

 Surface Water Management – Bunds and pit diversion drains will be required to manage 
the surface water in the pit areas to avoid flooding and geotechnical instability.  Sediment 

traps and seepage capture will be required to manage potential impacts relating to 

surface water quality.  Further work includes: 

- feasibility level designs and cost estimates for surface water management 
infrastructure 

- preparation of a surface water management plan. 

26.6.2 Project Water Supply 

The following recommendations for further work related to project raw water supply are made:

Page 26.5 
 

April 2019 
Jervois Mining Limited 

 As part of advanced studies in other project disciplines, the project water supply 

requirement should be more closely estimated. 

 Early discussions should be initiated with water funds and supply easement owners to 

establish preliminary conditions, capability, and availability. 

 Early discussions should be initiated with the power supply authority to establish 
preliminary conditions, capability, and availability of power along the nominal pipeline 
route, particularly at the Jugiong intake station where power draw will be a significant 

additional draw to the local network. 

 It is recommended that communication continue in follow up phases of investigation with 

Goldenfields Water and Central Tablelands Water to exhaust all potential mutual benefits 

that may present from having a new pipeline to the area. 

26.6.3 Project Electric Power Supply 

The following recommendations for further work related to project electric power supply are made: 

 Undertake detailed discussions with Essential Energy to firm up on actual capital 
requirements for grid connection and fixed and variable tariff charges for power supply 

from the grid.  This should cover both the total plant demand and the option of 

supplementary supply. 

 Commence detailed discussion, technical evaluation and trade off studies with the 
Chinese sulphuric acid plant vendor to determine the amount of electric power that can 
be generated from steam produced by the acid plant, and any advantages of including 

black start and emergency power and steam generation in the sulphuric acid plant power 

generation package. 

26.6.4 Heap Leach Facility and Residue Storage Facility 

The following recommendations for further work related to project Heap Leach Facility and Residue 

Storage Facility are made: 

 A risk assessment of the design for the RSF is to be completed prior to progressing to 
detailed design and documentation for regulatory approval. 

 Geotechnical investigations of the site selected for the HLF and RSF and construction 
materials as well as geotechnical testing of the materials to be stored in the RSF, is 

required to verify the assumptions for the embankment design and contained residue. 

 A desk top assessment of large�scale regional structures needs to be undertaken to 
confirm the seismicity characteristics of the site. The requirements of DSC3C3 may require 

a specific seismic hazard assessment.

 Stability analyses have been undertaken to confirm the HLF stack stability. Stability 
analyses are yet to be executed for the RSF embankment stability in accordance with the 

requirements of DSC3C3. 

 Stability analyses have been undertaken to confirm the HLF stack stability. Stability 
analyses are yet to beexecuted for the RSF embankment stability in accordance with the 

requirements of DSC3C3. 

 Where seismicity is demonstrated to be of concern, further analyses using 2D Plaxis 
(dynamic analysis) may need to be executed  

 Whist the concept presented in this study has limited external catchment, where runoff 
might be diverted, hydrological studies will need to be executed to assess the potential 

inflows to the RSF and confirm the freeboard and spillway requirements. 

 Further work needs to be executed in the next phase to fine tune and confirm the make�up 
water requirements. 

 Geochemical testing of the materials to be stored in the RSF is required to verify the liner 
details and assist in design of the rehabilitation and final surface cover for the RSF. 

26.7 Environmental 

The following works are required to complete the application for Development Consent. 

 Prepare a reasonably definitive Project Site layout and project description.   

 Prepare a Briefing Paper and Preliminary Environmental Assessment for circulation to the 

relevant government agencies and specialist consultant team. 

 Engage the remaining specialist consultant team, including consultants to address the 

following components. 

- traffic and transportation 

- social Impact Assessment (SIA) – this component is particularly important as 
the initial Scoping Phase of the SIA is required to be completed prior to the 

application for Environmental Assessment Requirements 

- economic assessment. 

 Recommence the existing specialist studies, with the following components of particular 

importance: 

- soils and land capability assessment, with a particular focus on obtaining the 
information required for the Gateway Certificate

- heritage assessment, with a particular focus on ensuring that all areas of likely 
disturbance are assessed 

- ecology assessment, in particular, ensuring that all targeted searches are 
completed are the appropriate time to year and that the strategy for 

obtaining/securing the relevant biodiversity offset credits is determined 

- noise and air quality assessments, with a particular focus on developing and 
assessing realistic construction, operational and post-closure scenarios. 

 Commence formal government agency consultation, including: 

- completing the Conceptual Project Development Plan process with the Division 
or Resources and Energy 

- convening and participating in an on-site Interagency Meeting 

- making application for the Environmental Assessment Requirements for the 
Proposal; and 

- one-on-one consultation in relation to particular issues such as water licensing, 
Gateway Certificates etc. 

 Commence community consultation, including: 

- one-on-one consultation with landholders within and immediately surrounding 
the Project Site, with a particular focus on obtaining non-revokable access the 

land required for the Proposal; and 

- wider community and specialist interest group consultation. 

 Commence EIS preparation, including a detailed description of the proposed activities 

and review and summarise the specialist consultant reports as they become available. 

26.8 Capital and Operating Cost Estimation 

In the next project phase the following activities related to capital cost estimation are 

recommended: 

 Enter into detailed discussions and bid evaluation with the Chinese equipment vendors to 

ensure that the actual scope required is covered by the bids they have provided. 

 Enter into detailed discussion and technology evaluation with the Chinese vendor for the 
sulphuric acid plant to ensure that the full scope required is included in their bid, and that 

the source of their technology is valid and justified.  Negotiation between the Chinese 
vendor and an Australian construction contractor will be required to ensure that valid 

construction costs for Australia are identified.

 Enter into discussions with the Chinese vendor for the sulphuric acid plant to include the 
black start power and steam requirements for the sulphuric acid plant as part of the acid 

plant scope. 

 Continue discussion with Essential Energy to identify costs for backup power by 

connection to the NSW electricity grid. 

Several opportunities exist to lower the overall operating cost and these include: 

 Further investigation of the alternative supply of supplementary power from the NSW 

state grid. 

 Further assessment of the alternatives for construction camp construction and operation 

during the four year extended construction phase. 

 Long term negotiations with suppliers of major consumables, sulphur, magnesia and lime 

to lock in more stable long term supply costs. 

 Further investigation of the options for importation and transport of major consumables to 

site including port alternatives and rail options. 

26.9 Budget to progress through the Next Development Phases 

Following is a description of the various workplans under Resource, Metallurgy, Processing, 

Mining, Supply Transport and Logistics, Infrastructure, Environmental and Cost Estimation.  The 
culmination of this work will be a bankable definitive feasibility study ("DFS") and a fully permitted 

project, including receipt of mining lease and all operating licenses. 

The DFS cannot commence until geological confidence in the Nico Young Mineral Resource is 
significantly improved.  This is outline in a planned sequential drilling programme across Ardnaree 

(phase 1(a)) and Thuddungra (phase 1(b)).  Whilst the exploration activities are budgeted to be 

sequential they are independent, and results and availability of capital dependent.   

Drilling will initially occur on the Ardnaree deposit to improve the geological level of confidence.  
Until this time other workstreams shall be paused, to ensure that DFS level engineering only occurs 
on a Mineral Resource Estimate with the requisite level of geological confidence.  Thereafter the 

Thuddungra programme will be initiated.  Early works in the DFS, particularly those associated with 
environmental and permitting approvals, will also likely commence in conjunction with Thuddungra 
resource definition.
