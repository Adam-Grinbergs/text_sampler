1.1.2 Project Location 

The Inata Gold Project is situated in Burkina Faso approximately 220km north-northeast of the capital 

Ouagadougou. 

Burkina Faso is a "landlocked" country, bordered by Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Cote D'Ivoire to the south, by 

Mali to the west and north, and by Niger to the east. The country has an area of approximately 274,200km2.  

The nearest town to the Gold Project is Djibo, situated approximately 60km to the southeast of the project 

area. 

The project site can be accessed from the capital, Ouagadougou, by 180km of sealed road to Ouahigouya 

and then via a further 170km of gravel road via Djibo.  The final 35km is via an unsealed gravel road to the 

site.  

1.1.3 Climate 

The country lies within the Sudano-Sahelian Zone where climate and natural environment are harsh. Rainfall 

is low, characterised by strong inter-annual and space-time variability. The hydrographic network of the 

country is quite dense; but most of the rivers are not permanent. 

Figure 1 – Project Location 

 

1.1.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Approximately 86% of the population (estimated at 12.1 million in 2003) are engaged in agriculture. 40% of 

the GDP is derived from agriculture (crops 25%, livestock 12% and fishing 3%), and this is predominantly 

subsistence agriculture. Cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize, fonio and rice) occupy 88% of the cultivated

area per year; but cotton is the main export crop and accounts for an average of 50% of net export income. 

Hence, potential mining projects would have a major impact upon the economy.  

1.1.5 Physiography 

The project area exhibits a slightly undulating topography with peneplanation evident. Local laterite-capped 

low hills are flanked by the broad flat plains. The low plains are cut by seasonal streams and rivers. 

1.1.6 History 

The Belahouro area was first explored in the early 1980's. Initially, the Bureau des Mines et de la Geologie du 

Burkina (BUMIGEB) undertook site exploration between 1984 and 1991, identifying mineralised quartz veining 

in the Souma, Fete Kole, and Inata areas.  

BHP Minerals International Exploration (BHP) was granted tenure over Belahouro in 1994. BHP then entered 

into a joint venture agreement with Resolute Limited (Resolute) for the period from 1998 to 2001. Resolute 

became sole operator of the project, until February 2004 when Goldbelt entered into an agreement to acquire 

the project and Resolute's other interests in Burkina Faso; with the final sale taking place in March 2005. 

Artisanal workings in the area of the resource have been limited to very small scale shallow workings, with the 

area protected under government regulations. More extensive but still very shallow workings are present to 

the west of Inata. No other development of the resource has taken place to date.   

 

1.2 Geology, Exploration and Resource Modelling 

1.2.1 Introduction 

The Inata Gold Project is situated within the western part of the Birimian Djibo Greenstone Belt, and 

encompasses three principal geological domains:- the granitic-dominated Damba-Inata domain in the 

westernmost portion of the project area, the central Belahouro-Sona Sedimentary Basin and the easternmost 

Fete Kole volcanic-dominated province. 

The Birimian Series of West Africa is host to some of the largest gold deposits in the world, including Sadiola, 

Yatela, Morila and Syama in Mali, Obuasi, Bogosu, Prestea and Bibiani in Ghana, and Siguiri in Guinea. 

1.2.2 Project Geology and Mineralisation 

The Birimian (2.1-2.2 Ga) volcano-sedimentary series is understood to have been extensively deformed and 

metamorphosed during the Eburnean Orogeny (2.0-2.1 Ga). Metamorphic mineral assemblages are generally 

indicative of low-grade regional metamorphism to greenschist facies.   

Throughout the Inata Project, exposures of the Birimian basement succession are rare. 

At Inata, gold mineralisation is commonly associated with mesothermal stockwork and sheeted quartz–

carbonate–sulphide veining, stockworks of albite-carbonate-sulphide veinlets, or as sulphidic haematitic 

breccia in host shales (sometimes graphitic) and/or felsic volcaniclastics and epiclatics. The stratigraphy is 

generally upright and north-striking or moderately west-dipping. The mineralisation has been defined along a

BS EN ISO 9001:2000 

FS80050

5.5 km long zone and occurs in a number of stacked elongated bodies that have been emplaced along a 

composite N-S shear zone. Felsic porphyries have been emplaced within the mine stratigraphy or cross-cut. 

The porphyries are rarely foliated and rarely mineralised suggesting that they came later to the mineralising 

event. 

Extensive weathering and lateritisation of the mineralisation and surrounding host rocks has occurred, 

resulting in oxide mineralisation up to 100m depth.  There appears to be little evidence of depletion and 

corresponding supergene enrichment within the weathering profile, and the width and grade of primary 

mineralised zones appears to be similar to their equivalents within the saprolite profile. 

1.2.3 Exploration 

Successive exploration programmes have been conducted by BUMIGEB, BHP, Resolute and Goldbelt 

between 1984 and 2007. The majority of work conducted since Resolute's involvement with the project in 

1999 has been the drill definition of the Inata Deposit. In total, 111,311m of RC drilling in 1,112 holes has 

been conducted over the project (INRC0001-INRC1186) and 6,150m of diamond drilling (43 holes). 

Goldbelt's approach from 2004 has been to increase confidence in and extend the Inata area deposits by a 

substantial increase in the drilled metres, with additional less intensive work in the Souma and Fete Kole 

areas. 

1.2.4 Drilling and Drilling Quality 

Data utilised by Ravensgate in this study comprised RAB (Rotary Air Blast), RC (Reverse Circulation) and 

diamond drillholes in the Inata area (including the satellite deposits of Sayouba and Minfo). RAB data was 

only used in aiding in construction of geology and mineralisation interpretations only, and was not used in the 

actual interpolation or estimation process.  

Ravensgate considers that the RC and diamond drilling data and sampling procedures utilised in the resource 

estimation are of acceptable quality and broadly consistent with international industry "best practice" 

standards, although recoveries for diamond core from the moderate to highly weathered saprolite has been 

relatively poor.  

RC field duplicate samples were routinely collected (at a rate of 1 in 30 samples) to allow assessment of the 

field sampling error (or bias) once the laboratory error, determined from analysis of pulp duplicates, has been 

subtracted.  Ravensgate assessed RC field duplicate data, and considers that the data can be reproduced 

acceptably, and no distinct bias is immediately evident. 

Wherever possible, drilling was undertaken normal to the plane of the principal mineralised orientation.  

Ravensgate is confident that the modelled resources are adequately supported by the drilling orientation with 

respect to the mineralised strike and down-hole versus true intersection width. 

1.2.5 Sample Quality and Laboratory Quality Control Procedures 

Current Goldbelt procedures for quality control include the submission of internationally recognised standards, 

duplicate and replicate analyses, and submission of field duplicates at a rate of 1 in 30 samples.

Analysis of the results of the analysis of the QA/QC data from the various drilling programmes shows that the 

results are of acceptable precision and accuracy. 

1.2.6 Bulk Density Determination 

Bulk density data has been collected by Goldbelt staff using an industry-standard immersion in water 

technique. A total of 2,100 determinations have been made, with a total of 185 of these within the modelled 

mineralisation. Bulk density determinations of 1.6, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6 t/m3 have been used for highly, moderately 

and slightly weathered ore respectively and 2.6 t/m3 for fresh ore. 

1.2.7 Topography 

A detailed topographic digital terrain model (DTM) was used to tie in all the proposed infrastructure with the 

modelled resource.  

1.2.8 Database and Drillhole Data 

Goldbelt previously supplied Ravensgate with an Access database containing collar, survey, geology, 

structure assay, and specific gravity data. This data was supplemented with relevant data from the more 

recent programme of 74 RC drillholes provided by Goldbelt.  

A thorough review of the deposit statistics was carried out for sample support considerations. Raw sample 

data was analysed, and was then composited to a standard 2.0m down-hole composite length. The resultant 

data was used in the Block Model interpolation calculations.  

The data overall was deemed by Ravensgate to be of acceptable quality.  

1.2.9 Block Model Construction 

1.2.9.1 Geological Model 

A set of geological wireframes defining intrusive felsic porphyry and graphitic shale packages was 

constructed. These wireframes were used to code a separate set of geological block models for later addition 

to the mineralisation block models. Figure 2 to Figure 6 below show the combined wireframes, with 

mineralisation in red, graphitic shale in purple, and felsic porphyry in orange.

1.2.9.2 Compositing, Spatial Domaining and Statistical Analysis 

The complete drillhole database was subset into domains using the wireframe solids produced within the 

Datamine Studio software. Once the composite database was verified, an entirely new set of analytical 

statistics for gold (Au) grade and length for each domain was generated. In this instance it was determined 

that most domains did not require any top cut of the data (most domains displayed low coefficients of 

variation), and several domains had a top cut of 30g/t gold applied. 

1.2.9.3 Variography 

A set of directional variograms was generated using the Datamine Studio programme VGRAM and VARFIT 

functions for the domains at the Inata deposits.  All the variograms were calculated and developed using the 

2.0m down-hole composite set of diamond drilling data for sets of comparable domains, with 3 groups for 

Inata North, 3 groups for Inata South, 2 groups for Minfo, and a single group of domains for Sayouba.  

1.2.9.4 Block Model Construction 

The drill spacing generally centred on 50m northing intervals, with areas of 25m spacing, which is reasonable 

given the ranges generated in the variography study. The parent cell estimation block sizes chosen were 6m 

East by 12.5m North by 5m RL elevation for the Inata North, Inata South and Sayouba block models and 

12.5m East by 6m North by 5m RL elevation for the Minfo block model. 

1.2.10 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resources for the Inata Deposits were classified in accordance with the Canadian Securities 

Administration National Instrument NI 43-101 (NI 43-101) and the Australian JORC Code (2004).

1.2.11 Interpretation, Conclusions and Recommendations 

The Inata Gold Deposits have been modelled and analysed by standard 3D interpretation and by use of the 

Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) technique with the addition of some localized calibration checking using the 

Ordinary Kriging (OK) technique.  

The updated 3D wireframing of the mineralisation was aided by the additional drilling carried out during 2007, 

based upon recommendation from the March 2007 Resource Estimate.  

Analysis of the drilling data shows that the Inata Deposits exhibit good continuity of mineralisation thickness 

and grade with regular dip and strike, but on a local scale a more complex control is implied with over-

thrusting evident. 

 

1.3 Metallurgy 

1.3.1 Overview 

Metallurgical sampling and testing was carried out by Resolute and BHP during 1999 to 2002, prior to the 

acquisition of the property by Goldbelt Resources Ltd. The results of that work have been reviewed as part of 

the feasibility study and have been incorporated into the later test work initiated by Goldbelt between 2004 

and 2007.  

The results of these programs indicate a CIL process with gravity concentration will yield recoveries of 93% - 

95% in all ore types. Leach kinetics demonstrated that the ore was relatively insensitive to grind size and good 

recoveries were obtained at a grind of 80% passing 106µm.  A conservative approach was employed in the 

process design and a grind of 80% passing 75µm was selected. 

Samples from the zone of major gold mineralisation were collected in the Goldbelt programme of 2004-05 

from diamond drill holes, sometimes twinned with RC holes in order to obtain the maximum amount of 

material for testing. The material submitted for test work included samples of transition and fresh ore to allow 

investigation of the metallurgical characteristics of all three ore types. Holes INRC 913 and INRC 914 were 

collected from the southern part of the Inata North orebody which Goldbelt believe to be the best part of this 

orebody, from where the major part of the ore will be sourced. Samples have also been obtained from drill 

holes in Inata Central (INRC 912) and Inata South (INRC 911).

The Inata oxide ore demonstrated mild preg-robbing characteristics which were overcome in the conventional 

cyanide in leach (CIL) process.  Some unweathered (fresh) ore reflected higher preg-robbing characteristic.  

These fresh ores responded well to pretreatment with kerosene and good recoveries were obtained. However, 

the fresh ore presents a minor proportion of the orebody and it is proposed that such ore will be stockpiled 

and treated towards the end of the mine life.     

Initial test work showed there that gold could be recovered by gravity concentration, the amount varying from 

about 8 to >80%.  The introduction of gravity concentration to remove the coarse gold prior to leaching was 

investigated and found to reduce leaching time greatly but did not increase overall recovery significantly.  

Since gravity concentration recovers gold before the addition of cyanide, reducing the quantity of gold at risk 

to loss due to "preg-robbing" will be an additional advantage.  The operating costs for reagent consumption 

were determined from whole process test work, i.e. gravity concentration with leaching of the gravity tails. 

The Bond work Index determination showed the oxide ore from the Central ore body to be very soft (Wi about 

6 kWh/t) while the oxide ore in the North ore body was moderately soft (Wi about 10.5 kWh/t).  The indices for 

transition ore from the North ore body were 13.2 kWh/t and 14.0 kWh/t and from the Central ore body 9.0 

kWh/t.  In the case of fresh ore, one sample (INDD 22) showed a work index of 15.2 kWh/t while the other 

was suspiciously low at 9.0 kWh/t. A value of 15.0 kWh/t was assumed for this sample.  The work index for 

fresh ore from Central ore body at 9.9 kWh/t was again significantly lower than the same fresh material from 

the North orebody.  The Mine Plan has taken cognisance of these work index values to achieve a blended mill 

feed with a work index which will allow a plant throughput of 2.25 million tonnes annually to be maintained. 

 

1.4 Mining 

1.4.1 Introduction 

The mining study is based around a process plant with a 2.25 million tonne per annum (Mtpa) ore throughput. 

The Inata project includes the following resource models:  

• Inata (including Sayouba)  

• Minfo 

The total combined resource at a 0.5 g/t cut-off grade is 25.1 Mt at 1.8 g/t for 1,397 kozs contained gold as 

outlined in Table 3 at a 0.5 g/t cut-off.

1.4.2 Pit Optimisation 

The optimisation studies were completed on both the Inata and Minfo models using the key optimisation 

parameters highlighted in Table 4. The results of the optimisation study show that the size of the shells 

generated for the Inata resource are robust to changes in key parameters, but the cash value can change 

significantly.  The Minfo resource is sensitive to key changes in the optimisation parameters.

1.4.3 Economic Criteria 

Detailed operating cost estimates were developed based on owner operation.  

Process recoveries as summarised in Table 5 are based on metallurgical testwork conducted on a number of 

composite samples from different sections of the orebody which vary by area and by weathering profile and 

include areas where graphitic shales are encountered.

• Sayouba  

• Minfo 

Final designs were completed on all of the Inata resources, including staged designs on both the North and 

Central areas. Ultimate designs were completed for Sayouba, Minfo and Inata Far South.   

1.4.5 Ore Reserves 

As the mineralized zone is generally wide and sub-vertical a relatively low dilution factor of 5% has been 

allowed.   

Ore losses are defined as ore that would be "lost" due to poor mining practices (i.e. ore sent to a waste 

dump), or as isolated small blocks which when mined would be heavily diluted. In both the Inata and Minfo 

models, minimum mining widths have been maintained, and the shear zone is wide and predictable, hence a 

relatively low ore loss factor of 1.5% can be used. 

The ore reserves have been classified as per the Australian ore reserve guidelines outlined in the Australian 

Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2004. This classification is 

consistant with NI 43-101 guidelines. That is, the reserves are diluted and recovered ore from within a 

practical pit design that will be delivered to the process plant. The total Mineable Reserve Estimate for Inata 

and Minfo is 15.4 Mt at 1.9 g/t, as summarised in Table 8.  This ore reserve consists of 35% Proven and 65% 

Probable material.

The vast proportion of ore material is highly to moderately weathered ore, with only 2% being fresh or 

graphitic shale.

1.4.6 Operations 

1.4.6.1 Mining Method 

Open pit mining will be undertaken by Goldbelt and managed by an experienced operating team.  All material 

will be hauled from the open pit either directly to the crusher, to an ore stockpile or to a waste dump.   

1.4.6.2 Mining Schedule 

The schedules were developed using MineSight®'s strategic scheduling program which accounts for ore 

losses, dilution, different material types and variable period lengths.  The over-riding objective was to 

maximise metal on a period-by-period basis. 

The schedule is based on months for the 2 month pre-strip period and the first 12 months of production. After 

the first year, the schedule was changed to quarters for the following two years, and annual periods after this.  

Efforts were made to schedule only highly weathered ore for as long as practically possible and to defer 

mining the deeper transitional and fresh ore. 

As staged pit designs were developed, the resulting incremental reserves allow higher grade ore to be 

targeted during the early part of the mine life. 

The final schedule is based on developing the open pits in the following sequence with an initial focus on 

supplying high grade, highly weathered ore early in the schedule. 

• Inata North Stage 1,  

• Inata North – Ultimate, 

• Inata Central, 

• Inata South and Far South, and 

• Sayouba and Minfo. 

1.4.6.3 Waste Dump and Stockpiles 

The current strategy is to develop waste dumps to the west of the open pits on the hangingwall side of the 

deposits, a minimum distance of 130m from the pit crest. Given the steep dip of the orebody, this position of 

the waste dumps is unlikely to sterilise any potential extensions of the orebody at depth. This assumption will 

be confirmed by condemnation drilling prior to mining.  Two main dumps are required, one to service Inata 

North and a separate dump for Inata South and Central. A small dump is required for Minfo while Sayouba will 

use the Inata North Dump. Figure 7 outlines the positions of the waste dumps and their relative size.   

1.4.6.4 Equipment Purchase Schedule 

To minimise up-front mining capital costs, the procurement of the mining fleet will be split, with the first fleet 

being purchased at commencement of operations.  The second fleet will be required for production by month 

10 (month 8 of the first production year after accounting for 2 months of pre-strip) of the schedule and will be 

purchased on the basis of this date for delivery and commissioning.

1.4.7.2 Mining Operating Costs 

Costs have been summarised with the capital costs being amortised on a tonnage basis. The overall average 

mining costs for the life of the operation are $1.34/tonne mined excluding capital and $1.56/t including capital.  

Table 11 summarises the mining schedule. Over 15.4 Mt of ore is scheduled over a 6.9 year period to supply 

on average 135 kozs of metal per year, with a peak of 177 kozs in Year 2.  Maximum material movement of 

21.4 Mt occurs from Years 4 to 5, and reduces after this for the remainder of the mine life. Approximately 1.1 

Mt of low grade ore stockpiled over the life of the mine is rehandled in the final year to supplement direct ore 

feed from the open pits.  A total of 944 kozs is presented to the mill over the life of mine with 893 kozs 

recovered during this period. 

A staged approach has been adopted for mine development, and pre-strip requirements have been minimised 

as a result. Mine production is based on two primary 200 tonne excavators with a fleet of 91 tonne off-highway 

trucks supported by a standard ancillary mining fleet.   Overall project life at an annual processing rate of 2.25 

Mtpa is almost 6.9 years.

1.5 Processing Plant and Infrastructure 

1.5.1 Introduction 

Following extensive exploration, sampling and testing it was determined that the Inata Gold project will be a 

conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant combined with a gravity recovery circuit to process 2.25 Mtpa of ore.  

Goldbelt Resources purchased a second hand plant from Brock's Creek in Australia to fast-track the Inata 

Project implementation by acquiring long lead-time items that were part of the Brocks Creek plant.  

The major components of this plant include the jaw crusher, SAG mill, one Ball Mill, the cyanide mixing and 

the elution system. There are also other items such as steelwork, tanks, pumps etc. All possible items will be 

refurbished as necessary and used in the Inata plant. 

A second ball mill has also been purchased to enable the plant throughput to be increased to 2.25Mtpa. This 

mill, from South Africa, will be refurbished to as new before transportation to Burkina Faso. 

Goldbelt Resources has already dismantled the Brock's Creek plant and has stored the items for reuse in the 

Inata plant ready for refurbishment and subsequent transportation to Burkina Faso for installation in the Inata 

Plant. New equipment selection will be based on the mass balance and co-ordination with equipment vendors 

and service providers. The CIL area will be all new construction with new tanks, agitators, interstage screens, 

carbon transfer pumps, classifying and dewatering screens, whilst the AARL elution system from Brocks 

Creek will be utilised within the elution and acid wash system.   

The Inata Plant will be designed to operate for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Its availability will be 90%. 

The new equipment will be designed to meet the mass flow balance for the 2.25 Mtpa plant.

1.5.2 Tailings Discharge 

Tailings will be pumped to a conventional tailings dam located to the north of the process plant (refer section 

6).  

1.5.3 Water 

Water for process plant use will be drawn from the Gomde Barrage, supplemented by water reclaimed from 

the tailings dam (refer section 6). 

1.5.4 Power Generation  

There will be a generating system of low speed HFO fuelled diesel units, supplemented with two high speed 

diesel units with a total installed power of 14 MW. 

The generators will be housed in a separate building.  

Total power requirement for all plant, mine and administration services is estimated at 6.8 MW. 

1.5.5 Process Plant Control  

The plant is designed to operate with a low level of automation using a Supervisory Control and Data 

(SCADA) system to control the process related drives from the central control room, by means of PLCs at the 

MCC locations. Processes such as reagent mixing and elution will be manually controlled by trained 

operators. 

1.5.6 Plant Infrastructure 

The buildings associated with the process plant include administration, laboratory, medical building, ablution 

area, mess hall, gold room, security building, plant workshop and store, chemical storage (reagents, caustic 

and carbon) and lime storage building. The plant and support buildings are within a high security fenced area. 

1.5.7 Camp Infrastructure 

The camp is located 7km south of the process plant and is accessible by a light vehicle all weather access 

road.  

The camp and its infrastructure has the capacity to accommodate up to 230 personnel.  

1.5.8 Airstrip 

A site was identified for the airstrip and  based on site observations of the ground conditions and prevalent 

topography, was considered appropriate for the placement of a runway to be used by the project for the 

operation of small passenger and cargo aircraft. 

1.5.9 Access Road 

An all weather access road to the project site has been designed.   

1.5.10 Conclusion 

The mineral processing plant is a combination of existing Brocks Creek equipment and new equipment. The 

process has been designed to achieve optimum gold recovery against economy based on test work carried

out by AMMTEC. The process for the plant was developed directly from test work and GBM's experience in 

CIL plants and other plant designs in remote locations, especially West Africa. Equipment selection was 

based on the mass balance and the design criteria for the operating conditions and environment, as well as 

vendor data and previous designs. 

The control system will be of robust design with minimal automation. Alarming and diagnostic facilities will be 

included for monitoring and trouble shooting. 

The plant is largely self sufficient and as such has all the required infrastructure at the plant site. 

 

1.6 Tailings & Water Management Facilities 

1.6.1 Geotechnical and Hydrogeological Investigations  

Samples of tailings and rockfill materials from the Inata North open pit have been analysed for both 

geotechnical and geochemical characteristics such that their suitability for construction, in the case of the 

rockfill, and their deposition characteristics, in the case of the tailings, can be ascertained. 

During July to September 2007 significant rainfall occurred in the area of the project, affecting site access and 

movement within the site.  As a result, movement of the drill rigs within the site was severely restricted and the 

planned hydrogeological borehole programme could not be completed.   

It is planned therefore that the design parameters assumed for the preparation of this report will be confirmed 

once geotechnical testing of the materials is completed and the hydrogeological investigation is undertaken.  

A review of the design parameters will then be completed to determine the appropriateness of the proposed 

TMF and Gomde Barrage layout. 

1.6.2 Inata Tailings Management Facility 

The tailing disposal strategy is for conventional sub-arial deposition of tailings to a dam constructed of mine 

waste material. 

Sequential construction of dam raises will be undertaken using the downstream method.  This will ensure the 

long term stability of the structure and facilitate the installation and optimal performance of the embankment 

liner.   

Tailings will be discharged from the plant by pumping through a dedicated pipeline system taking the tailings 

to the crest of the facility.   

Tailings water released as the material is deposited will accumulate towards the centre of the impoundment 

where a floating pontoon will be located for the recycling of the tailings water to the process plant. 

Seepage water from the drainage system will be directed to the return water pond, a 30 m by 30 m HDPE 

lined pond from where seepage water will be returned to the tailings pond for recycling.

Geotechnical characterisation of the site and the construction materials have not been completed to date and 

geotechnical parameters for the construction materials and the foundation materials have been estimated.  

Therefore the TMF has been conservatively designed.   

The TMF for the Inata project has been designed to accommodate the yearly production of tailings at a rate of 

approximately 2.25 Mt per year with a maximum capacity of approximately 14 Mt.  The dam has also been 

designed such that if further raises are required to accommodate additional tailings production, this can be 

accommodated without the requirement for a new development. 

The use of groundwater by the local population 4km from the tailings dam site, and the lack of firm 

hydrogeological information on the TMF site, indicate that a HDPE liner may be required in the design. Based 

on the above, the HDPE liner has been included in the design until the hydrogeological investigation is 

completed and the non requirement of the liner is proven. 

1.6.3 Gomde Water Storage Facility 

Various options were considered at the pre feasibility design stage for the provision of a secure and reliable 

water supply for the Inata Gold Project.  Various surface water impoundments and ground water abstraction 

options were analysed. 

The results of the preliminary studies leading to the pre feasibility study indicated that a barrage in the vicinity 

of the village of Mormosal was the best and most reliable option for the water supply to the project. 

Following completion of the pre feasibility study, a site visit was undertaken  to further assess potential sites 

for a water supply facility for the project. Following this assessment,  the Gomde site was selected, located 

16km north east of the process plant. A topographical survey is in progress  to confirm the characteristics of 

the site. 

The Gomde dam will be a 11.5m high, compacted, structural rockfill embankment 2.8km long and provided 

with a suitable spillway structure for the secure discharge of excess water. 

1.6.3.1 Site Investigations & Design Parameters 

As stated previously final geotechnical, hydrogeological and topographical works have not been completed to 

date.  

1.6.3.2 Rainfall Data 

The site of the proposed Gomde Barrage is located at approximately 14°23' N with the headwaters of the 

combined upstream contributing area extending below 14°N.  Five rain gauges from which monthly rainfall 

data was made available are well distributed at comparative latitudes.   

Rainfall data sourced from hydrological studies undertaken in Burkina Faso were used to prepare an average 

for the five meteorological stations located within the same latitude of the Inata project site.  

1.6.3.3 Water Balance 

The Gomde water balance has been based on the same assumed parameters, summarised in the rainfall 

date and in addition the following: 

• NASA satellite mapping of the catchment area

• Interpolated contours based on January 2007 river spot elevations and the satellite maps for the 

catchment area 

• Assumed runoff factors based on Socrege EIA recommendations  

• Assumed hydrogeological parameters - no hydrogeological evaluation of the catchment area has 

been undertaken 

The water balance has been developed as follows: 

• 100% rainfall onto the impounded area 

• Rainfall runoff from the catchment area with variable run off coefficient) 

• Minus the following; evaporation from the river, estimated seepage, evaporation from the impounded 

area, village potable water abstraction, mine potable water abstraction, dust suppression water, 

process water requirements. 

Using average year rainfall conditions following completion of the barrage construction, water storage will 

reach approximately 100 Mm3 at the end of the rainy season and will, depending on average rainfall years for 

every year following, vary between a minimum of 84 Mm3 and a maximum of 112.5 Mm3 (maximum capacity).   

Following an average rainfall year, sufficient water storage should be achieved by the barrage to provide 

water supply for the project for a maximum of two consecutive dry years. 

The simulation shows that 25% barrage capacity is achieved after 2 years and only decreases to 12.5% after 

32 months.   

 

1.7 Manpower 

1.7.1 Introduction 

The remote location of the Inata Gold Project dictates certain additional requirements to ensure that the plant 

is largely self sufficient and utilises local resources as much as possible, especially in terms of manpower. 

Goldbelt Resources intends to employ selected personnel with specific remote location operational 

experience as well as to recruit and train people from the local community. It is envisaged that some of the 

site construction crew will be retained in operational roles once the mine is operational in order to provide a 

solid background and understanding of the facility. 

1.7.2 Recruitment and Training 

To ensure that all positions are filled in accordance with the implementation schedule, Goldbelt Resources will 

start a recruitment campaign prior to commencement of construction. Advertised positions will state the 

required qualifications and level of experience for each position. A rigorous screening process will be 

implemented to ensure appropriate personnel are employed.

Positions requiring select or specific skills will be filled by expatriates. Expatriates will provide knowledge and 

experience for the operation of the plant and also serve to train lesser experienced personnel. It is expected 

that as the knowledge base increases more local personnel will fill more senior and supervisory positions. 

1.7.3 Organisational Structure 

The organisational structure is presented in the main body of the BFS showing all positions and number of 

personnel required. At total of 259 persons will be employed by SMB, of which 239 will be site based and the 

remaining 20 based at the office in Ouagadougou. The employee numbers categorised by main department 

are summarised in Table 12.

1.8 Implementation plan 

1.8.1 Introduction 

The purpose of this section is to outline the implementation plan for the successful execution of the proposed 

new gold plant and associated infrastructure at the Burkina Faso Inata Project Mine site. 

It is understood that the client wishes to "fast track" this project and this plan outlines the steps necessary to 

make this happen in the client's best interests. 

1.8.2 Nature of Implementation 

The nature of the implementation plan is determined considering the project site location, the regulations 

governing construction in Burkina Faso, the key milestone dates as set out in this document and the 

anticipated efficiency levels of the construction contractors. The implementation plan also takes into account 

the implications of relocation and integration of the existing Brocks Creek processing plant in Australia into the 

overall design and construction of the Inata Project in Burkina Faso. 

Construction of the process plant and site infrastructure will be implemented under the overall management of 

the EPCM (Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management) Contractor. Direct control of 

construction shall be the responsibility of the individual contractors.

All fabrication, where practical, will be done in Burkina Faso. Included in the Engineers team will be expatriate 

quality control and expediting personnel who will ensure that off-site fabrication schedules and quality of work 

are in accordance with the project requirements. 

1.8.3 Implementation Schedule

1.9  Environmental 

1.9.1 Overview 

The Prefeasibility Study for the Inata Gold Project included a detailed Environmental Impact Study that 

investigated the impact of the mine and process plant on the environment in terms of: 

• Air quality and climate; 

• Hydrology; 

• Hydrogeology; 

• Water quality; 

• Noise and vibration; 

• Flora and fauna; 

• Socio-economics; and 

• Cultural heritage. 

The Environmental Impact Study (EIS) was carried out by Socrege in 2005 on behalf of Resolute (West 

Africa) Ltd for the Inata mine site. Since the completion of the 2005 EIS the proposed capacity of the mine and 

process plant has increased and various design parameters have been revised as a result of recent 

exploration and geological and metallurgical test work. 

The EIS is being updated and will be submitted to the Burkina Faso government in the fourth quarter of 2007. 

It is not expected that the conclusions of this report will differ significantly from the 2005 report. 

1.9.2 Closure 

The closure plan will incorporate a long-term target for closure and rehabilitation which will permit the mine 

operator to leave the site in a condition that requires limited further maintenance or monitoring.   

The main closure activities for the project, including the TMF, which will require remediation, are envisaged to 

be: 

• remediation of the open pit to ensure slope stability, public and wildlife security and safety; 

• remediation of the waste dumps; 

• dismantling of all surface infrastructure not required for future end-use; 

• vegetation of the tailings surface and downstream embankments to minimise the potential for wind 

and water erosion; 

• ongoing downstream environmental monitoring programme.

1.9.3 Conclusion 

Subject to the effective implementation of the measures, the environmental monitoring and environmental 

management plan outlined in the previous EIS, and being updated presently, the Inata Project will not have a 

detrimental impact on the environment.

1.11 Conclusion 

The Inata Gold Project resource deposits exhibit good continuity of mineralisation thickness, and the total 

combined resource at a 0.5g/t cut-off grade is 25.1 Mt at 1.8g/t giving 1,397kozs of contained gold. 

A traditional CIL treatment plant has been designed to extract the gold, and in order to construct the plant in 

the shortest possible time Goldbelt Resources has secured the major long lead equipment by purchasing 

second hand mills, crusher, and power plant. 

Water supply for the Plant is a key issue and a design has been prepared for the construction of a barrage at 

Gomde. This barrage will be constructed before the 2008 rainy season and will be capable, given average 

rainfall, of impounding sufficient water for the total plant, mining and infrastructure for 2 consecutive dry years. 

The environmental impact study was prepared 2 years ago on the basis of the parameters in the pre-feasibility 

study, and is currently being upgraded to include the current information. 

The previous study concluded that the environment would not suffer any detrimental affects and it is expected 

that the latest study will have the same conclusion. 

Total capital expenditure, excluding previously purchased items has been prepared to an accuracy of + or – 

15%. Contingencies have been assessed for all the individual areas of the Plant and this amounts to 10.6% of 

the future capital expenditure. 

The financial analysis calculates an IRR of 49.75% at a gold price of US$650/oz.

SECTION 2 -  INTRODUCTION  

This bankable feasibility study (BFS) for the Inata Gold Project has been compiled by GBM MEC. Ltd. for and 

on behalf of Goldbelt Resources Ltd. in accordance with National instrument 43-101 and has been prepared 

in compliance with this instrument and with Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. The study 

addresses all technical and economic aspects of the project. 

Geological modelling and resources estimation was completed by Ravensgate Consultants of Perth, Australia. 

George, Orr and Associates of Perth, Australia provided geotechnical design recommendations. Orelogy Pty 

Ltd of Perth, Australia completed all mine design, costings and reserves estimation. Engineering and design 

for the tailings dam, water dam and other mine infrastructure was carried out by AMEC, Kent, England. 

Metallurgical test work was carried out by AMMTEC of Perth, Australia. The Environmental Impact Study 

(EIS) was prepared by Socrege of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. GBM was responsible for the management 

of the feasibility study, development of the process flowsheet, process engineering, design and the 

compilation of the report.   

 

2.1 Corporate Background of Goldbelt Resources 

Goldbelt Resources Ltd. ("Goldbelt", "Goldbelt Resources" or the "Company") was incorporated under the 

Company Act (British Columbia) on July 23, 1976 as a specially limited company with the name Goldbelt 

Mines Inc. (Non-Personal Liability) and converted to a limited company pursuant to the Company Act (British 

Columbia) with the name Goldbelt Mines Inc. on October 5, 1984. The Company amalgamated with North 

American Metal Corporation on October 22, 1984 as one company with the name Goldbelt Mines Inc., 

changed its name to Goldbelt Resources Ltd. on July 15, 1991 and amalgamated with Comptoir International 

du Commerce Ltee on July 9, 1997 as one company with the name Goldbelt Resources Ltd. In August 2001, 

the Company continued its corporate jurisdiction into Yukon Territory. On February 16, 2006, the Company 

continued its corporate jurisdiction into the Province of British Columbia. Goldbelt's registered office is in 

Canada. Goldbelt is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario and is a multiple jurisdiction 

filer with SEDAR. The Company's common shares are not listed for trading on any securities exchange in the 

United States. The Company is required to file annual and periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange 

Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

After several years of being inactive, Goldbelt on March 3, 2005 resumed trading on the TSX Venture 

Exchange ("TSXV") after achieving Tier 2 Maintenance and Minimum Listing Requirements through the 

acquisition of mineral properties in Burkina Faso, West Africa and a simultaneous $8,000,000 private 

placement. 

On September 18, 2006, the Company attained Tier 1 status on the TSXV. The Company's common shares 

were listed on the TSXV under the symbol "GLD:V". On April 10, 2007, the Company's shares were approved 

for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") under the symbol "GLD". 

The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of gold properties primarily in 

Burkina Faso, West Africa. Over the three most recently completed financial years, Goldbelt has advanced

the development of its 90%-owned Inata Project through the completion of a Prefeasibility Study, ongoing 

drilling programs, acquisition of a mining permit for the property and most recently the completion of the 

Mining Convention with the Government of Burkina Faso. The Mining Convention governs specific details 

relating to fiscal arrangements, taxation, employment, land and mining guarantees, and environmental 

protection, in accordance with Burkina Faso's Mining Code. 

In addition to the Inata Project, the Company has 20 exploration tenements in Burkina Faso. Twelve of the 

tenements are located in the north-eastern part of the country in the Belahouro region, the location of the 

Inata Project. Of the remaining 8 exploration tenements, 7 are in the Houndé and Bougouriba regions located 

in the southwest part of Burkina Faso and 1 permit is in the Koupelo region, in the southeast region of the 

country.  

Goldbelt's geologists have been actively exploring the Houndé and Bougouriba tenements. To date 

approximately 22,000 soil and rock samples have been collected and assayed. These geochemical assay 

results and earlier geophysical survey results are currently being collated to provide an updated geological 

model of the tenements. The Company completed 6,000 meters of drilling on the Karba permit in Houndé 

which have shown promising results. Goldbelt plans on conducting a geophysical exploration program at 

Karba, Mandiasso and Diosso in order to identify drill targets. The Company is required under Burkina Faso 

Mining Laws to spend approximately $600/km2 annually in order to keep these exploration tenements in good 

standing. 

In February 2007, the Company entered into an exclusive option to acquire all of Barrick Exploration Africa 

Limited's assets in Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea. 

 

2.2 Resource Estimation Terms of Reference 

The Independent Resource Model Report has been prepared at the request of Goldbelt Resources Ltd to 

provide a resource model on the Inata, Sayouba and Minfo Deposits within the Inata Gold Project of northern 

Burkina Faso. 

This Report has been compiled in accordance with the JORC Code and the National Instrument 43-101 and 

has been prepared in compliance with this Instrument, Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. 

The Australasian Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC 

Code-December 2004) is prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) which is comprised of 

representative members from the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM), the Australian 

Institute of Geoscientists (AIG), the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), the Australian Stock Exchange 

(ASX), and the Securities Institute of Australia (SIA).   

It is mandatory for all companies actively working on exploration, mining and mineral processing projects 

within the minerals sector listed on the ASX (Australian Stock Exchange) to report all exploration results, 

mineral resources and ore reserves using the JORC Code as a reporting guideline.

The JORC Code provides minimum standards for public reporting, so as to ensure that investors and their 

advisors have the necessary information they reasonably require to form reliable opinions on the results and 

estimates being reported. 

Reporting according to the JORC guidelines does not automatically satisfy the requirements of National 

Instrument 43-101 reporting, but is a very sound basis for doing so. The majority of this report outlines the 

other "modifying factors" reviewed in the Belahouro Project resource modelling study that affect the primary 

requirements related to National Instrument 43-101 Reporting.

2.4 Property Description and Location 

The Inata Gold Project is situated approximately 220km north-northeast of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso in the 

western part of the Birimian Djibo Greenstone Belt. The Inata Gold Project comprises three prospect areas; 

being Souma and Fete Kole to the east and Inata to the west. Souma and Inata lie on the eastern and 

western margins of the Belahouro – Sona Basin; with the Inata deposits within the Damba – Inata Volcano 

Sedimentary Province.  

Burkina Faso is a "landlocked" country, bordered by Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Cote D'Ivoire to the south; by 

Mali to the west and north, and by Niger to the east. The country has an area of approximately 274,200km2.   

The location of the project and other mining projects in the vicinity are shown in Figure 1. The ounces quoted 

refer to total resources.

2.5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, and Physiography 

2.5.1 Access 

The Inata Gold Project is located approximately 220km to the north-northeast of Ouagadougou, in northern 

Burkina Faso close to the neighbouring country of Mali. The nearest town, Djibo, is situated approximately 

60km to the southeast of the project area. 

The project site can be accessed from the capital, Ouagadougou, by 180km of sealed road to Ouahigouya 

and then via a further 170km of gravel road via Djibo.  The final 35km is via an unsealed gravel road to the 

site.  

2.5.2 Climate 

The country lies within the Sudano-Sahelian Zone where climate and natural environment are harsh. Rainfall 

is low, characterised by strong inter-annual and space-time variability. The hydrographic network of the 

country is quite dense; but most of the rivers are not permanent. 

The area is within the Sahelian Zone (north of 14o 00'N); which has an average annual rainfall of 300mm to 

600mm concentrated over three months. There has been an observed tendency for rainfall to have 

decreased, with Djibo having an average annual rainfall of 570mm for the period from 1961-1970 and of only 

300mm for the period 1981-1987. The dry period normally extends for 8 to 10 months. Vegetation consists of 

steppes with trees, shrubs and thick bushes.   

2.5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Approximately 86% of the population (estimated at 12.1 million in 2003) are engaged in agriculture. 40% of 

the GDP is derived from agriculture (crops 25%, livestock 12% and fishing 3%), and this is dominantly 

subsistence agriculture. Cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize, fonio and rice) occupy 88% of the cultivated 

area per year; but cotton is the main export crop and accounts for an average of 50% of net export income. 

Hence, potential mining projects would have a major impact upon the economy.  

The regional infrastructure in Burkina Faso is poor, with a limited power distribution network and poor road 

and rail networks. During the dry season water is commonly sourced from manually operated bores. 

Belahouro is the largest of the permanent local villages, approximately 30km to the east of Inata; and this is 

the current location of the Goldbelt exploration camp. The current exploration camp has accommodation for 

up to 40 persons, two generators with 30,000 litre diesel storage capacity, and permanent bore water. 

Tracks in the project area are not maintained, and accommodation comprises mud huts and straw huts. 

Diesel powered generators are the only source of power in the area.  

2.5.4 Physiography 

The project area exhibits a slightly undulating topography with peneplanation evident. Local laterite-capped 

low hills are flanked by the broad flat plains. The low plains are cut by seasonal streams and rivers.

2.6 History 

The Belahouro area was first explored in the early 1980's. Initially, the Bureau des Mines et de la Geologie du 

Burkina (BUMIGEB) undertook site exploration between 1984 and 1991, identifying mineralised quartz veining 

in the Souma, Fete Kole, and Inata areas.  

BHP Minerals International Exploration (BHP) was granted tenure over Belahouro in 1994. BHP then entered 

into a joint venture agreement with Resolute Limited (Resolute) for the period from 1998 to 2001. Resolute 

became sole operator of the project, until February 2004 when Goldbelt entered into an agreement to acquire 

the project and Resolute's other interests in Burkina Faso; with the final sale taking place in March 2005. 

Artisanal workings in the area of the resource have been limited to very small scale shallow workings; with the 

area protected under government regulations. More extensive but still very shallow workings are present to 

the west of Inata. No other development of the resource has taken place to date.

SECTION 3 -  LICENCES AND PERMITS 

Goldbelt Resources has received a Mining Licence, as of 25th May 2007. The mining licence was granted for 

a total area of 26,025 km2, and allows the Company to construct all necessary infrastructures for the 

exploitation of the deposit in accordance with the plans indicated in the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) and 

approved by the Mines Commission. 

The licence is valid for 20 years from the date of signature. 

A Mining Convention was signed on 14th August 2007. This Convention précis's the rights and obligations of 

Goldbelt SMB and the Burkina Faso State as defined in the mining code, and provides guarantees with 

respect to these rights and obligations, especially in respect of taxation and currency exchange regulations. 

Other permits required for the operation of the mine will be applied for following the completion of detail 

design, and include explosives storage and use permits and authorisations to construct and operate a water 

reservoir.

SECTION 4 -  GEOLOGY AND RESOURCES 

4.1 Introduction 

The Inata Gold Project is situated within the western part of the Birimian Djibo Greenstone Belt; which 

comprises intermediate to mafic volcano-sedimentary successions and syn to post-kinematic granite and 

gabbro intrusions within sedimentary and tuffaceous sediments. The region has undergone regional lower 

greenschist facies metamorphism. Subsequent intrusion of dolerite and felsic porphyry occurred during and 

after mineralising events. Tarkwaian facies arkosic sandstone is seen to overly the volcano-sedimentary 

sequence at the eastern border of the Belahouro granite. 

Figure 11- Regional Geology and Location of Inata Gold Project 

 

 

The project area encompasses three principal geological domains as shown in Figure 2 above. The Damba-

Inata domain occurs in the westernmost portion of the project area.  Central to the project is the Belahouro-

Sona Basin, and the Fete Kole province occurs in the eastern region. 

The Damba-Inata trend is dominated by metasediments and intermediate to mafic volcanics and 

volcanoclastics.  To the west of the Inata trend, strong magnetic signatures are present in aeromagnetic data 

indicating the presence of mafic volcanics or sedimentary derivatives.  The trend varies over the strike of the 

prospect, from north-northwest in the south to north in the central area and north-northeast in the northern 

area. 

The Belahouro-Sona Basin consists of turbiditic metasediments and minor volcanoclastics and provides the 

key elements to the understanding the regional tectonic framework subsequent to basin formation.  The basin 

is bounded to the east, west and south by early basin forming structures (D1) that have later been reactivated

in subsequent phases of compressional deformation (D2).  Arcuate, generally south dipping thrusts abut the 

southern margin of the basin indicating a significant north-south compressional event (D3).  Late mineralised 

(D4) 040° and 330° faults crosscut the entire basin and adjacent volcano-sedimentary terranes. 

Fete Kole to the east of the Sona Basin, is a complex of felsic to mafic volcanics and sedimentary derivatives, 

and various pre-, syn- and post deformation granitoid intrusions.  The final phase of intrusion is gabbroic, 

which is also associated with minor volcanic ultramafic sequences. 

The basement geology of the Inata Gold Project represents part of the Baoulé-Mossi Domain of the West 

African Craton which is mainly formed by Birimian volcano-sedimentary series, which dominates the 

basement geology of the West African Shield.  The Birimian Series is composed of volcanic and plutonic 

bodies (basalt, andesite, rhyolite, rhyodacite, dacite, felsic tuff, gabbro, diorite and ultramafic rocks) distributed 

within a generally schistose and vertically tilted sedimentary and tuffaceous succession of black shale, 

sandstone, pelitic schists, tuffaceous schist, greywacke, quartzite and chert.  This basement succession is 

overlain by Tarkwaian siliceous and arkosic sandstone and conglomerate.  

The Birimian Series of West Africa is host to some of the largest gold deposits in the world, including Sadiola, 

Yatela, Morila and Syama in Mali, Obuasi, Bogosu, Prestea and Bibiani in Ghana, and Siguiri in Guinea. 

 

4.2 Project Geology 

The Birimian volcano-sedimentary series is understood to have been extensively deformed and 

metamorphosed during the Eburnean Orogeny. Metamorphic mineral assemblages are indicative of low-grade 

regional metamorphism to greenschist facies.  However, in the Belahouro-Souma area, kyanite-bearing mica 

schist and pelite indicate a higher grade metamorphic regime.  The succession is strongly affected by 

polyphase deformation displaying recumbent folding and a strong sub-vertical dominant schistosity with 

transposed bedding planes in some areas.  Syn to post-tectonic granitoids intrude the basement succession. 

The entire stratigraphy has been intruded by massive post-Birimian dolerite dykes and sills with higher 

magnetic susceptibility than the surrounding host rock.  This allows the dykes and sills to be readily 

distinguishable in airborne magnetic data. 

Throughout the Belahouro Project, exposures of the Birimian basement succession are rare.  Weathering is 

extensive, persisting up to 100 metres depth with a typical lateritic profile. The gross structure of the 

Belahouro Project relies on interpretation of the airborne magnetic data (Figure 12and Figure 13).

Figure 12   Regional Structure of Inata Gold Project – Aeromagnetic Interpretation (SRK, 2002) 

 

 

Regional compression resulted in folding of the Belahouro-Sona Basin lithologies, with displacement evident 

along axial planar shears or faults evident at Inata. The later D3 thrusting associated with further shortening is 

reflected on the deposit scale at Inata with stacking of mineralised slices; which results in thick intersections 

particularly at Inata North. Gold mineralisation is commonly associated with stockwork and sheeted quartz–

carbonate–sulphide veining, stockworks of albite-carbonate-sulphide veinlets, or as sulphidic haematitic 

breccia. 

Pyrite is the dominant sulphide species, present as discrete poikilitic euhedra ranging from a fraction of a 

millimetre in size, largely confined to vein margins or disseminated within alteration selvedges.  Traces of 

other sulphides, principally chalcopyrite, galena, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, bornite, tennantite, linneite and 

mackinauwite are present as veins, fracture fillings and localized disseminations adjacent to veins.  Gold is 

largely developed within fractures in pyrite grains, rarely larger than 50 microns, and is non-refractory. 

Extensive weathering and lateritisation of the mineralisation and surrounding host rocks has occurred.  The 

base of oxidation extends to over 60m in places, but may be locally depressed within zones of fracturing and 

brecciation.  There appears to be little evidence of depletion and corresponding supergene enrichment within 

the weathering profile, and the width and grade of primary mineralised zones appears to be similar to their 

equivalents within the saprolite profile.

4.3 Deposit Types 

Gold mineralisation within the Inata Gold Project is associated with the mesothermal vein style, seen in much 

of the Birimian Series of West Africa, and within most Archaean and Proterozoic terrains worldwide. There is a 

common association between this mineralisation style and considerable deformation associated with regional 

metamorphism; resulting in a strong structural as opposed to lithological control upon the mineralisation. 

 

4.4 Mineralisation 

The Inata deposit has an overall strike extent of 5.5km, with Sayouba extending 350m and Minfo extending 

500m. They are believed to relate to the same structural and mineralising events with later structural offset 

and thrusting. Mineralisation is predominantly associated with carbonate-pyrite alteration within and adjacent 

to quartz veining, with gold present as essentially free grains or inclusions in pyrite.  Trace amounts of

arsenopyrite and sphalerite have been observed in thin section (Mason, 1999). The host lithologies are shale 

(often graphitic), siltstone, minor intermediate volcanics and felsic porphyry. 

 

4.5 Exploration 

Successive exploration programmes have been conducted by BUMIGEB, BHP, Resolute and Goldbelt 

between 1984 and 2006. 

BUMIGEB focussed on defining mineralised areas of quartz veining at Fete Kole, Souma and Inata between 

1984 and 1991 with mapping, chip sampling of outcrop, trenching and limited drilling. 

BHP commenced work in 1994, conducting mapping and geological interpretation using available airborne 

magnetic data. Soil geochemical sampling was used to identify numerous anomalies, with follow-up trenching 

and widely spaced RC and diamond drilling conducted predominantly at Fete Kole, Souma and Inata. 

Resolute took over as operators of the joint venture with BHP in 1998, and their work concentrated on Inata 

and to a lesser extent Souma. Further soil geochemistry was followed by RAB, RC and diamond drilling in 

these areas. Minor exploration was conducted on the Fete Kole and Pali areas. In 2001, Resolute acquired 

full ownership of the project, and undertook further geological mapping, ground geophysics (TEM and 

magnetometer) surveys, and additional soil and rock sampling. The Detailed Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) 

data was acquired in 2002/2003 utilising SiroTEM MkII equipment via a 200m square loop, with 200m steps 

between stations and 400m between traverses. This data enabled better delineation of shear zones, as 

targets for potential mineralisation. 

The exploration activities of previous explorers are summarised in Table 17.

Goldbelt's approach from 2004 has been to increase confidence in and extend the Inata area deposits by a 

substantial increase in the drilled metres; with additional less intensive work in the Souma and Fete Kole 

areas. 

 

4.6 Drilling 

Data utilised by Ravensgate in this study comprised RAB (Rotary Air Blast), RC (Reverse Circulation) and 

diamond drillholes in the Inata area encompassing Sayouba and Minfo. RAB data was only used in aiding in

construction of geology and mineralisation interpretations only, and was not used in the actual interpolation or 

estimation process.  

The principal drillholes comprised the INRC prefix series of RC holes, and the INDD (RD) prefix series of 

diamond drillholes. A summary of the drilling statistics is given in Table 3.  A total of 183 additional RC and 5 

additional diamond drillholes were completed since the last resource calculation by RSG (Slater and Nicholls, 

2006).

Analysis of the data shows that Goldbelt have now drilled 73,156m, or 66%, of the RC drilling from the total of 

111,311m. Similarly, Goldbelt have completed 3,119m, or 51%, of the total of 6,150m of diamond drilling. 

The Resolute and Resolute-BHP drilling comprises 26,936m, or 24%, of the RC drilling; and 1,751m, or 28%, 

of the diamond drilling. 

There is extremely limited documentation available on the BUMIGEB and BHP drilling phases prior to 1998; 

but which comprise only 10% of the RC drill metres and 21% of the diamond drill metres at Inata. The ensuing 

descriptions below will relate to the predominant Goldbelt and Resolute drilling campaigns. 

4.6.1 Reverse Circulation Drilling 

Four types of drill rigs were utilised, and were supplied by two drilling companies. 

• UDR650 (truck mounted) with 750cfm/350psi compressor.  Rod string 4½ inch with 5½ inch face 

hammer.  Supplied by West African Drilling Services (WADS).

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 67 of 334 

 

• UDR1000 (truck mounted) supplied by WADS. 

• Schramm T66 truck mounted with 900cfm/350psi air capability using 5½ inch face hammer,   supplied 

by WADS. 

• Schramm 685 truck mounted with air capability of 900cfm/350psi.  Drill string with 4½ inch face 

hammer, supplied by Grimwood Davies. 

The performance of the different drilling companies was reported as satisfactory with high daily productivity 

rates, acceptable sample recovery (except shallow diamond coring), and safety standards being achieved. 

Examination of samples in the field agrees with the recorded sample recoveries. 

4.6.2 Diamond Core Drilling 

WADS completed diamond drilling for both Resolute and Goldbelt.  RC pre-collars were drilled using a 

UDR1000 multipurpose rig with 350psi/900cfm capacity.  Pre-collars were completed with a 5½ inch RC drill 

bit while diamond coring was completed using HQ triple tube assembly. Concrete-lined sumps were 

excavated for use in the drilling. All holes were surveyed using a single shot magnetic camera at the collar 

and at regular down-hole intervals.  Core orientations were completed using the spear technique, with both 

tungsten and crayon bits utilised, depending on core competency. Core is packed into open-topped wooden 

trays, with wooden blocks used to mark depth intervals; and permanent marker used for labelling rather than 

stamped aluminium plates.  

Core structural orientations are routinely recorded to assist in determining the controls on mineralisation, in 

establishing a reliable geological model for resource estimation, and to provide additional geotechnical 

information to determine the potential blast fragmentation and pit stability characteristics. 

The core is transferred from the trays and "reconstructed" on a V-rail (angle iron) rack and the orientation line, 

determined from the crayon orientation mark recorded during drilling, drawn along the entire length of the 

assembled core. 

Geotechnical logging has recorded percentage core recovery, RQD percentage, rock type, weathering, rock 

strength and fractures per metre.  This basic geotechnical logging is considered appropriate at this stage of 

project development, but it is Ravensgate's opinion that some further advanced structural modelling could 

now be carried out on the basis of the data so far collected. 

4.6.3 Drilling Quality 

Ravensgate considers that the RC and diamond drilling data utilised in the resource estimation is considered 

to be of acceptable quality and broadly consistent with international industry "best practice" standards. 

The general quality of RC drilling has progressively improved over time, particularly since more experienced 

and well-equipped contractors have become available.  Drilling practices have benefited from closer attention 

by more experienced exploration management.  The quality of diamond drilling is considered to be of industry 

accepted standard, although recoveries for diamond core from the moderate to highly weathered saprolite has 

been relatively poor.

Wherever possible, drilling was undertaken normal to the plane of the principal mineralised orientation.  

Ravensgate is confident that the modelled resources adequately are supported by the drilling orientation with 

respect to the mineralised strike and down-hole versus true intersection width. 

 

4.7 Sampling Method and Approach 

Much of the field data relevant to the Inata deposits has been collected by Goldbelt or Resolute, with most of 

the procedures relevant to their activity. 

4.7.1 RC Sampling and Logging 

RC drill chips were collected at 1m downhole intervals via a cyclone and then into PVC bags prior to sample 

splitting. The collected samples were riffle-split by using either a multi stage Jones riffle-splitter, or by 

performing multiple passes through a single stage Jones riffle-splitter.  A final sample of approximately 2kg 

was collected for submission to the laboratory for analysis.  The dry sampling represents industry standard 

practices, but Ravensgate did not observe any drilling activity during the site visit to confirm the practice; and, 

in the absence of homogeneity testwork, a sample weight of 2kg is potentially below optimal. Wet samples 

were collected via grab sampling; which is an unreliable and potentially unrepresentative method. However, 

the recorded instances of wet sample return are extremely low as a result of a very low water table.  

BHP maintained a practice of RC chip boards, compiled by gluing the sieved RC chips to a board.  These 

boards provide a reasonable record of RC sampling and are a useful tool for the re-logging and in some cases 

the re-interpretation of the geology and mineralisation.  RC chip boards for INRC001 to INRC150 were 

examined in detail by Ravensgate at the exploration camp. 

When Resolute took over management of the project, the practice of RC chip boards was discontinued; and 

there are approximately 300 RC drillholes with no chip record. The practice of using plastic chip trays was 

commenced by Resolute from 1999, and has been continued by Goldbelt. Chip trays were observed at the 

exploration camp at Belahouro by Ravensgate, and several were also sighted at the Goldbelt office in 

Ouagadougou. 

Standard logging sheets have been used for the drill programmes post-BHP, along with a standardised 

logging legend; which enables proper analysis and interpretation of the drillhole dataset. Ravensgate 

examined hard copy logging sheets for all the INRC prefix drillholes in the Goldbelt office in Ouagadougou. 

4.7.2 Diamond Core Sampling and Logging 

Diamond core is predominantly stored in three row wooden trays at the Belahouro exploration camp. There is 

limited space for layout of the core other than directly on the ground for examination. 

Logging is done onto standard lithology and geotechnical logging sheets; and hard copy originals of all the 

diamond core logging was examined in the Ouagadougou office. The sampling of the core was subject to the 

discretion of the geologist completing the geological logging.  After the marking out of the required interval, the 

core was cut in half by the electric diamond blade core saw.  The cut is made along the orientation line with

the half core portion that looks north being retained as a reference.  The half portion that looks to the south is 

broken up for assay. 

In the upper oxide zone, the core was too friable for diamond saw cutting.  Instead, the core was dry cut or 

cleaved.  The sample weight required was 2kg. A photograph of typical diamond core samples is shown in 

Figure 14. 

Figure 14   Core Handling and Mark-Up – Goldbelt Diamond Drilling – INDD037 

 

 

The following diamond holes were previously inspected by RSG Global personnel during their 2006 site visit; 

INDD007, INDD008, INDD009, INDD016, INDD018, INDD019 and INDD020. 

The zone of mineralisation in holes INDD007 to INDD009 had been weakly weathered and the core was 

relatively competent.  Fines along fractures and veining had been washed out but recoveries were above 

90%.  Holes INDD016, INDD018, INDD019 and INDD020 were moderately to strongly weathered, the core 

was crumbly and friable and sample recovery was very poor. Consequently, these holes are likely to 

underestimate the gold in grade and width when compared to adjacent RC. 

Ravensgate inspected diamond drillholes INDD035, INDD036 and INDD037 during the site visit. These were 

geotechnical holes completed by Goldbelt during 2006. Intervals used for specific gravity determination were 

observed, along with areas of core removed for geotechnical testwork. Recovery in the weathered zones was 

better than previously accomplished by RSG Global, since Goldbelt staff had paid close attention to drilling 

during this latest programme. 

4.7.3 Sample Recovery 

Sample recovery for RC drilling was noted as good and generally estimated to be in excess of 20kg per metre 

drilled. While sample weights have not always been systematically recorded; Ravensgate visually inspected

some of the samples from the 2006 drilling and previous samples stored at the Belahouro camp and at Inata, 

and considers that acceptable sample recoveries were being achieved.  (Based on 5'' or 122.5mm diameter 

RC drillholes and the established average weighted bulk density, the notional volume recovery of dry samples 

should approximate 20kg/m in saprolite and 32kg/m in the primary (fresh) zone).  Dry samples were obtained 

often to downhole depths of approximately 200m.  

Sample recovery in diamond holes was poor to moderate for the moderately to highly weathered zones.  Core 

loss tends to occur due to washing and/or grinding at the commencement and completion of drilling runs, 

particularly within the partially oxidised portion of the profile or within friable zones of tectonised rock.  

Consequently, confidence of samples from shallower diamond drilling is considered to be low to moderate . 

4.7.4 Sample Quality 

The sampling procedures adopted for drilling are consistent with current industry "best practise" standards 

and sample recovery is good.  Samples from diamond coring within the highly weathered zones are generally 

of low quality. 

RC field duplicate samples were routinely collected (at a rate of 1 in 30 samples) to allow assessment of the 

field sampling error (or bias) once the laboratory error, determined from analysis of pulp duplicates, has been 

subtracted.  Ravensgate assessed RC field duplicate data, and considers that the data can be reproduced 

acceptably, and no distinct bias is immediately evident.   

 

4.8 Sampling Preparation, Analysis, and Security 

4.8.1 Sample Preparation 

Procedures initiated during the Resolute-BHP joint venture have essentially continued through to the present 

Goldbelt tenure; and as such current procedures are indicative of those in practice since 1999.  

Samples for submission are prepared rapidly, generally under the supervision of expatriate technical staff. 

Sample bags are stapled closed and transported to the secure Belahouro exploration camp. The sample 

batches are then transported by road from the camp, directly to the laboratory – currently the SGS Assay 

Laboratory in Ouagadougou. 

Goldbelt drill core samples selected for assay are also despatched to the laboratory by truck from the 

Belahouro exploration camp in a similar way. 

4.8.2 Sample Analysis 

Several different laboratories have been utilised over the course of exploration at Belahouro. Initial work by 

BUMIGEB was conducted utilising their own laboratory situated in Bobo-Dioulasso, however, this represents a 

negligible proportion of the overall database. 

BHP data represents 10% of total RC data used, and 18% of the diamond drilling data. The SGS laboratory at 

Tarkwa, Ghana was utilised for sample analysis. Digital quality control data associated with this dataset is not 

available.

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 71 of 334 

 

Resolute determined that the BUMIGEB laboratory was unreliable, and instead utilised the Intertek Testing 

Service (ITS) laboratory situated in Ouagadougou. This data represents 26% of the RC drill chip assays and 

28% of the diamond drill core assays. 

Goldbelt have used the Transworld laboratory in Tarkwa, Ghana in 2004 (19% of total RC assays); whilst in 

2005 the SGS laboratory in Tarkwa, Ghana was used (22% of total RC assays); and in 2006 the SGS 

laboratory in Ouagadougou has been utilised for assay analysis (23% of total RC assays). 

A summary of the various sample preparation and analytical procedures employed at the different laboratories 

is given below. 

4.8.3 Intertek Testing Service (ITS), Ouagadougou 

The assay method applied by ITS is summarised below. 

Sample Preparation 

• 2kg or less of sample is dried, disaggregated, crushed, and pulverised (95% passing -200 

micron). 

• Two 180g pulps are taken for analysis and pulp storage. 

Sample Analysis 

• 30g charge, Fire Assay fusion, lead collection, AAS determination to 8ppb. 

• Gravimetric analysis completed on Au>10g/t. 

Routine quality control included the submission and assay of two international standards, one international 

blank and two duplicates per batch of 30 samples.  In addition, random checks were completed on spurious 

results. Sample preparation and analytical methods have been conventional and appropriate. 

4.8.4 Transworld Laboratories, Tarkwa 

The assay method applied by Transworld (Tarkwa) was as follows:- 

• 2kg to 3kg field splits are oven dried at 105°C. 

• Over dried samples are crushed in a jaw crusher to a nominal 3mm. 

• A 1.5kg sub-sample is collected via a riffle splitter. 

• The 1.5kg sub-sample pulverised in a homogenizing mill (LM2) to 90% -75µ. 

The 50g Fire Assay analytical procedure applied to the pulps is summarised as follows:- 

• A 50g portion of pulverized sample is weighed. 

• The sample is fused in a fusion furnace to produce a lead button. 

• A lead button is cupelled in a cupellation furnace. 

• The resulting prill is subjected to acid dissolution. 

The resulting solutions are then read on an AAS, with a stated detection limit of 10ppb gold.

4.8.5 SGS Laboratories, Tarkwa and SGS Laboratories, Ouagadougou 

The 2005 drill programme (and previously BHP samples with an undocumented procedure) was analysed at 

SGS Tarkwa, and the 2006 drill programme analysed by SGS Ouagadougou with the following procedure:- 

• 2kg to 3kg field splits are oven dried at 105°C. 

• The dried sample is crushed in a Jaw crusher to a nominal 3mm. 

• A 1.5kg sub-sample is collected via a riffle splitter. 

• The 1.5kg sub-sample is pulverised in a homogenizing mill (LM2) to 90% -75µm. 

The 50g Fire Assay analytical procedure applied to the pulps is summarised as follows:- 

• A 50g portion of pulverized sample is weighed. 

• The sub-sample is fused in a fusion furnace to produce a lead button. 

• A lead button is cupelled in a cupellation furnace. 

• The resulting prill is subjected to acid dissolution. 

The resulting solutions are then read on an AAS, with a stated detection limit of 10ppb gold. 

 

4.9 Data Verification 

4.9.1 Quality Control Procedures 

Current Goldbelt procedures for quality control include the submission of internationally recognised standards 

(Rocklabs 50g sachets of reference material, and Assay Solutions assay pills), duplicate and replicate 

analyses, and submission of field duplicates at a rate of 1 in 30 samples. Umpire assaying has also been 

undertaken by Ammtec in Australia. 

4.9.2 Intertek Testing Service (ITS) 

The quality control procedures implemented by ITS assaying were: 

• Cross referencing of sample identifiers (sample tags) during sample sorting and preparation with 

sample sheets and client submission sheet. 

• Compressed air gun used to clean crushing and milling equipment between samples. 

• Barren quartz 'wash' applied to the milling/pulverising equipment at the rate of 1:10. 

• Quartz washes assayed to determine the level of cross contamination. 

• Sieve tests are carried out on pulps at the rate of 1:50 to ensure adequate size reduction. 

• Assaying of internal standards data. 

• Mineralised duplicate pulps despatched to Genalysis Laboratory Services in Perth, Australia, for 

umpire fire assay analysis.

4.9.3 Transworld, Tarkwa and SGS, Tarkwa 

In addition to the above procedures applied at ITS, the following procedures were adopted for Transworld and 

SGS: 

• A minimum of 3% (1:30) of the submitted samples in each batch, are duplicated in the field. 

• Blank samples are inserted at the rate of approximately 1:30. 

• Screen tests are undertaken on sample pulps at the rate of 1:20. 

• Industry recognised solid standards (Rocklabs) are disguised and inserted at a rate of 1:30. 

• Assaying of internal standards data. 

• Mineralised duplicate pulps (representing 5% of the mineralised intercepts) are to be despatched 

for umpire fire assay analysis. 

• Pills inserted in barren 2kg samples are included in sample batches.  The insertion rate is 

approximately 1:40.  The pills were sourced from Assay Solutions Pty. Ltd, Australia. 

Analysis of the quality control data up to and including 2005 was made by RSG Global (Slater and Nicholls, 

2006), and comments on results of the analyses are given below. Graph plots generated by RSG Global are 

included the Appendix. Ravensgate examined the data from 2006 from the SGS Ouagadougou laboratory. 

4.9.4 Pre BHP Assay Data 

Little quality control data exists for the assaying completed prior to the involvement of BHP.  No quantitative 

assessment can be made in relation to the quality of this data however the data accounts for only 0.03% of 

the database.   

As little quality control data exists for the assaying completed prior to BHP's involvement, no quantitative 

assessment can be made in relation to the quality of this data.   

4.9.5 Resolute/BHP-Resolute (ITS) Assay Data 

Quality control data has been evaluated in the internal report 'Interim Report December 31 1998 by Resolute.  

A total of 583 pulps were submitted to Genalysis Laboratory Services in Perth, Western Australia, as part of 

routine off-continent analysis.  A high correlation was noted between datasets indicating no bias in the original 

assay dataset. 

Routine quality control included two international standards, one international blank and two duplicates per 

batch of 30 samples.  In addition, random checks were completed on spurious results.  Sample preparation 

and analytical methods have been conventional and appropriate. 

Data was reviewed by RSG Global in the form of reports for the QA/QC completed by Resolute.  The 

available data indicates that acceptable levels of accuracy and precision were being achieved in assaying for 

these datasets.  The pulps remain intact and were inspected by Ravensgate during the site visit at the 

Goldbelt storage facility in Ouagadougou, affording the possibility of selective re-assay if deemed necessary.

Based on a visual review of the different drillhole datasets, no apparent change in assay quantum was 

identified. 

4.9.6 Goldbelt (Transworld – Tarkwa) Assay Data 

The exploration samples generated by Goldbelt to May 2005 were assayed at the Transworld laboratory in 

Tarkwa. 

Digital QC data has been supplied to RSG Global for review, and includes field duplicate data, international 

standards, blanks and pill data. 

Discrepancies were encountered with the pill data supplied.  After consultation with the laboratory it was 

determined that during sample preparation, operators saw the pills as contaminants and removed them from 

the sample.  The later analysis conducted when operators stopped the practice of removing the pills showed 

that samples were generally being correctly crushed, homogenised and splits were representative of the 

crushed sample.   

Note that pills are a form of standard so that when sample weights are available metal can be calculated.  The 

mean of the assay pill data, as shown in all QC plots, reports below the expected value, and this under 

reporting is interpreted to be principally due to the identified removal of the pills.  Goldbelt elected to 

discontinue Transworld's services and to switch to SGS Laboratories in Tarkwa for its assaying. 

Field duplicate data is available for 644 samples.  The results show acceptable levels of precision, with 88% 

of the ≥ 0.1g/t Au data within the 20% HARD tolerance limits and a linear correlation of 0.98. 

Analyses of blanks were available to review the data for possible contamination.  The blanks database 

comprised 642 data.  Little contamination was evident, with the 55% of data lying at or within twice the 

detection limit of 0.005g/t Au.  Minor spikes are seen in the data with some clustering of higher background 

values apparent. 

The quality control data suite investigated for the 2005 drilling comprises 37 assays of independently 

submitted standards.  The submitted standards were sourced from Rocklab Ltd who specialise in producing 

internationally accredited standards. 

RSG Global completed a review of the following Rocklab standards: 

• Standard 0.42 (expected value 0.42g/t)  

• Standard 1.30 (expected value 1.30g/t)  

• Standard 3.46 (expected value 3.46g/t)  

The data analysis revealed some notable bias with standard 0.42, 1.30 and 3.46 reporting only 54%, 69% and 

77% respectively of standards within 10% tolerance limits.  However, the limited nature of the dataset should 

be appropriately considered.  Some anomalies were identified which appear to reflect incorrect labelling of the 

standards, in particular the 0.42g/t standard, and hence indicate that supervision of this aspect of the sample 

submission may have been inadequate.  Goldbelt has elected to discontinue to use TWL and to switch to 

SGS Tarkwa for its assaying.

Notwithstanding the sample preparation error concerning the use of the assay pills, the Transworld 

laboratories have achieved acceptable levels of precision.  Based on the available standards assaying, 

insufficient data is available to assess the assay accuracy fully, although RSG Global in previous review and 

reporting, do not regard that any systematic bias exists. 

4.9.7 Goldbelt (SGS – Tarkwa) Assay Data 

The exploration samples collected by Goldbelt in 2005 have been assayed at the SGS laboratory in Tarkwa.  

Field duplicate data, international standards, blanks and assay pill data has been reviewed.  Close monitoring 

of the QC data was conducted by Goldbelt and RSG Global personnel on a batch by batch basis during the 

current drill program with any irregularities immediately investigated and if warranted samples being re-

assayed.  

Pill data is available for 331 samples. Data shows that samples were generally being appropriately crushed 

and homogenised, with splits representative of the crushed sample.  Plots are supplied for the 5 pills utilised 

(HOME25 - 0.01g/t Au, HOME10 - 0.02g/t Au, HOME13 - 0.29g/t Au, PAD22 - 1.13g/t Au and SOG9 - 

3.99g/t Au).  The lower grade pills 0.01g/t and 0.02g/t have been treated effectively as blanks with results 

generally within tolerance (96% and 75% respectively).  The low grade data must be treated with caution as 

the 2kg blank material to which the pill is added may be weakly mineralised and the pill grade is also near 

assay detection.  Plots show that where the pill has been captured within the sample preparation, results are 

generally acceptable.  Continued review of the SGS laboratory sample preparation is required as 

approximately 20% of the higher grade pills (PAD22 and SOG9) have not been captured in sample 

preparation, possibly due to the pill being removed by sample preparation staff as a contaminant or excess 

sample being removed along with the pill before initial crushing.  Where the pill has been captured results are 

considered acceptable.   Further review of sample preparation based on the laboratory duplicates also reveals 

no issue with the sample preparation.   

Field duplicate data is available for 1081 samples. The results show acceptable levels of precision, with 87% 

of the ≥ 0.1g/t Au data within the 20% HARD tolerance limits and a linear correlation of 0.96. 

The blanks database comprised 644 data.  Little contamination was evident, with the 93% of data lying within 

0.1g/t Au.  Minor spikes are seen in the data with some clustering of higher background values apparent. 

The 2005 SGS Tarkwa quality control dataset includes 899 assays of independently submitted standards.  

The submitted standards were sourced from Rocklabs Ltd, specializing in producing internationally accredited 

standards. 

RSG Global completed a review of the following Rocklabs standards: 

• Standard OXA26 (expected value 0.08g/t) 195 samples  

• Standard OXC30 (expected value 0.20g/t) 87 samples  

• Standard OX9 (expected value 0.47g/t) 49 samples  

• Standard OXF28 (expected value 0.80g/t) 90 samples  

• Standard OXL14 (expected value 1.22g/t) 14 samples

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 76 of 334 

 

• Standard OXL40 (expected value 1.86g/t) 195 samples  

• Standard OXL25 (expected value 5.85g/t) 48 samples  

• Standard SN16 (expected value 8.37g/t) 201 samples 

The data analysis of the lower grade standards show excellent reproducibility of standard OXA26 with 98% of 

data falling within the +/- 0.04g/t tolerance.  Standard OXC30 also shows acceptable reproducibility with 94% 

(bias 12%) of data falling within the +/-0.05g/t tolerance as does standard OX9 with 88% (bias 13%) of data 

falling within the +/-0.07g/t tolerance.  Apparent large bias is related to the low order of magnitude of the 

dataset and is not considered noteworthy.  

Analysis of standards in the range above the reported cut-off of 0.5g/t and less than 5g/t reveal excellent 

accuracy was achieved by SGS Tarkwa, with Standard OXF28, OXL14 and OXL40 reporting 99% (bias 4%), 

78% (bias -8%) and 91% (bias 2%) of data respectively within 10% tolerance limits.  The relatively low 78% of 

data within tolerance of standard OXL 14 is a function of the limited dataset consisting of 14 samples and thus 

the large relative bias is considered insignificant. 

Review of the standards OXL25 and SN16, which represent the higher grade range of assaying, reports 96%, 

and 91% respectively within 10% tolerance limits, and a bias of -0.1 and 2.11% respectively.  It appears that 

some mislabelling of standard SN16 with standard OXL40 may have occurred in sample dispatch.  Removing 

these mislabelled standards improved the accuracy with the relative standard deviation reduced from 1.24 to 

0.48 and a reduction in reported bias to an acceptable 0.3%. 

Goldbelt's decision to use SGS Tarkwa for its assaying appears well justified when the quality of the 

standards data is considered.  In conclusion the SGS laboratories have achieved acceptable levels of 

precision and accuracy.  Based on the current dataset, RSG Global believes no systematic bias exists. 

4.9.8 Goldbelt (SGS – Ouagadougou) Assay Data 2006 

The exploration samples collected by Goldbelt from the 2006 drilling programme have been assayed at the 

SGS laboratory in Ouagadougou.  Field duplicate data, international standards, blanks and pill data has been 

reviewed.  

Field duplicate data is available for 1,528 samples, with 491 original assays above 0.1g/t. The results show 

acceptable levels of precision, with 54% of the ≥0.1g/t Au data within the 20% HARD tolerance limits and a 

linear correlation of 0.91.

The 2006 SGS Ouagadougou quality control dataset includes 886 assays of independently submitted 

standards which were sourced from Rocklabs Ltd who specialise in producing international accredited 

standards. 

Ravensgate completed a review of the following Rocklabs standards: 

• Standard SN16 (expected value 8.37g/t) 347 samples mean 8.37g/t 

• Standard OXL40 (expected value 1.86g/t) 195 samples mean 1.87g/t  

• Standard OXF41 (expected value 0.82g/t) 116 samples mean 0.79g/t  

• Standard OXF28 (expected value 0.80g/t) 93 samples mean 0.95g/t 

Analysis of Rocklabs standard SN16 (expected value 8.37g/t) shows that 95% of the values returned fall 

within 20% of the expected value. There are 13 anomalous low values which appear to have been a result of 

incorrect standard submission. There are 3 anomalous high values all from SGS job BF000368. Since this job 

also displays anomalous results for other check samples, it and this job has been re-assayed. Removing the 

anomalous values results in a mean of 8.62g/t and bias in the 'acceptable' range, and 94% of assays within 

10% of the expected value.

Analysis of Rocklabs standard OXF41 (expected value 0.82g/t) shows that 86% of the values returned fall 

within 20% of the expected value. There are five anomalous low values; which may have partly been a result 

of incorrect standard submission. There are five anomalous high values,  some which may have actually been 

standard OX14. Removing the anomalous values results in a mean of 0.80g/t and bias in the 'acceptable' 

range, with 68% of assays within 10% of the expected value, and 94% of assays within 20% of the expected 

value.

Analysis of the Rocklabs standards showed several outlier values, and these were investigated in conjunction 

with blanks and duplicates on a laboratory job by job basis.  

Ravensgate also viewed four hard copy reports of internal quality control performed by SGS Ouagadougou in 

the form of four monthly reports. Five international standards, blank material, replicate assays, and second 

split assays were used in the control process, and results were good for all four months. 

Generally, the performance of the SGS Ouagadougou laboratory has been acceptable. Ravensgate considers 

that the ongoing process of analysis and quality control during the exploration programme as assays results 

are returned can be improved, as there was a tendency not to evaluate assay jobs in as timely a fashion as 

was possible. Ongoing improvement in the understanding of the importance of QA/QC by company personnel 

was noted. 

Pill data is available for 523 samples. Data showed that the problems previously encountered at SGS Tarkwa 

were replicated. The results showed the majority to have returned a blank value, with the inference being that 

the pill had been removed. Due to the ongoing problems with the use of the assay pills and the inability to 

identify a particular problem in the preparation and assay process, their usage has been discontinued. This 

was discussed with and confirmed by staff during the site visit. 

4.9.9 Goldbelt (SGS – Ouagadougou) Assay Data 2007 

The exploration samples, collected by Goldbelt from the 2007 RC drilling programme of 74 holes for 6,582m, 

have been assayed at the SGS laboratory in Ouagadougou.  Field duplicate data, international standards, and 

blanks have been reviewed.  

Field duplicate data is available for 145 samples, with 44 original assays above 0.15g/t. The results show 

acceptable levels of precision, with a linear correlation of 0.995.

The 2007 SGS Ouagadougou quality control dataset includes 886 assays of independently submitted 

standards which were sourced from Rocklabs Ltd who specialise in producing international accredited 

standards. 

Ravensgate completed a review of the following Rocklabs standards: 

• Standard SN26 (expected value 8.543g/t) 123 samples mean 8.582g/t 

• Standard OXJ47 (expected value 2.384g/t) 133 samples mean 2.361g/t  

• Standard OXF53 (expected value 0.810g/t) 6 samples mean 0.768g/t  

• Standard OXA45 (expected value 0.0811g/t) 125 samples mean 0.0821g/t 

Analysis of Rocklabs standard SN26 (expected value 8.543g/t) shows that 100% of the values returned fall 

within 10% of the expected value. There are no anomalously low or high values reported.

Results of the analysis of the QA/QC data from the 2007 RC drilling programme shows that the results are of 

acceptable precision and accuracy. 

4.9.10 Bulk Density Determination 

Bulk density data has been collected by Goldbelt staff using an immersion in water technique. A procedure 

that was developed by RSG Global staff assisting Goldbelt, with the core billet sealed in an industry standard 

practice.  

A total of 2,100 determinations have been made, with a total of 185 of these within the modelled 

mineralisation. The results are tabulated below inTable 19.

4.9.11 Survey Control 

4.9.11.1 Topography 

The topography digital terrain model (DTM) has previously been created from drillhole collar survey data. 

Whilst this was adequate for the purposes of resource modelling, it was strongly recommended that a detailed 

site survey be undertaken to enable tie in of all proposed infrastructure with the modelled resource. This 

survey has now taken place, and the resultant topographic surface used for this resource is up to date. 

The new data resulted in an elevation approximately 22 metres above the historical surface, and required the 

correction of all drill collars with resultant requirement of adjustment of all previously interpreted 

mineralisation, geology, and weathering strings and wireframes.

4.9.11.2 Drillhole Collar Survey 

In 1998, upon Resolute assuming management of the exploration at the Inata Gold Project, a detailed 

surveying programme was completed over the entire project.  BAGEME/IGB, a Burkina Faso government 

survey agency, was employed to complete the survey.  Baselines of the local grids were accurately surveyed 

and geodetic stations were established in UTM WGS 84 datum. 

Drillhole collar positions have been accurately surveyed using standard theodolite techniques based on the 

geodetic stations.  Subsequent collars from drilling by Resolute were surveyed by a differential GPS unit to an 

accuracy of ±1 metre. 

All recent Goldbelt drilling has been resurveyed by DGPS and the data are incorporated into the exploration 

survey file.  DGPS survey of the 2006 drillholes using a new instrument, returned collar elevations 

approximately 25m higher than the expected value. This was as a result of the latest readings using ellipsoidal 

height, as opposed to the previous use of geodesic height. The new collar data was adjusted to fit the 

previous collar data. Several of the collar positions at Inata were re-checked with a handheld GPS unit during 

the site visit by Ravensgate. Collar elevations have been adjusted by the recent detailed survey data collected 

over the resource area. 

The majority of the drillhole collars have been marked with a cement slab for future reference.

4.9.11.3 Drillhole Downhole Survey 

Diamond drilling conducted by the Resolute-BHP joint venture was downhole surveyed by an unstated 

method at regular downhole intervals.  The RC holes were not surveyed.  However, due to the limited depth of 

RC holes, minimal substantial deviation would be expected, and the lack of survey data is therefore 

considered as not critical in the areas concerned. 

For the Goldbelt drill programmes, downhole surveys were undertaken by the drilling contractor (WADS) 

under the supervision of Goldbelt personnel prior to the completion of each hole.  All down-hole surveys were 

completed using an Eastman single shot camera at the collar and at regular down-hole intervals.  All azimuth 

readings taken by the camera are magnetic.   

In the case of RC holes, surveys are undertaken at nominal 30m to 50m intervals in the open hole after drilling 

is completed.  The drillholes remain very stable due to the lack of ground water (up to 200m in depth) and are 

easily surveyed with minor risk of hole blockage or loss of camera.  Each survey result is checked onsite 

before being entered into the survey file and is re-surveyed if a discrepancy between the planned and 

determined orientation is evident.  Typical deviation is less than 7º in both dip and azimuth for drillholes of up 

to 200m depth. 

The azimuth and dip can be readily determined through the bottom of the bit for diamond core holes.  This 

information is also determined at nominal 30m to 50m intervals down-hole and recorded in the database in a 

similar fashion to the RC drilling.

Once the set-up orientation of the rigs is defined, little deviation is evident in either the RC or diamond drilling 

and the spatial distribution of data is considered to be well controlled. 

In addition, several of the 2006 drillholes were analysed using a Televiewer instrument by Teeratec 

Geophysical Services of Germany. This produces a 3D downhole image of the hole and also records survey 

data at 1cm intervals. The available Televiewer downhole survey data was incorporated into the survey 

database.

Data validation of the supplied database was made by Ravensgate. Minor issues were previously identified 

with some missing collar elevations, missing azimuth data, and duplicated records; which were investigated 

and rectified. An issue with the Televiewer survey data at 1cm intervals was identified whereby the software

used will only permit a maximum of 2000 downhole survey data points per drillhole; which required reducing 

the data point frequency for this dataset.  

Variations in the geological logging codes between pre-Resolute and post-Resolute involvement in the project 

are evident and Ravensgate edited the early data to match the later codes used in order to enable improved 

geological modelling. 

The supplied database is considered to be of an acceptable industry standard. However, it was recommended 

that a system with built in validation procedures should be purchased or developed in the future, and 

Ravensgate understands that this implementation is in progress. 

 

4.10 Adjacent Properties 

4.10.1 Ouaire Kerboule 

The permit immediately to the North of  the Belahouro Permit is currently held by Somika SA, which acquired 

the 404km2 Ouairé Kerboulé exploration permit from Orezone Resources (OZN:TSX, Amex).  Orezone 

Resources previously spent over US$1 million exploring the permit and identified significant mineralisation at 

Kerboulé, located approximately 25 kilometres to the north-north east of Inata.  

Orezone Resources suggested that mineralisation at Kerboulé lies in the same structural corridor to that of the 

Inata deposit and that mineralisation also occurs in a similar shear zone and geological setting containing the 

same volcano-sedimentary and volcanoclastic rocks.  The global Inferred Resource quoted by Orezone 

Resources (as September 2005) at Kerboulé was 4.8 million tonnes at 1.3g/t Au (200,000 ounces).  The 

economic feasibility of the Kerboulé project is currently related to the advancement of the Inata Deposit.

There are no other mineral deposits associated with adjacent projects that are directly relevant to the 

Belahouro Project.

4.11 Mineral Resource Estimates 

4.11.1 Database and Drillhole Data 

Goldbelt previously supplied Ravensgate with an Access database containing collar, survey, geology, 

structure assay, and specific gravity data by Goldbelt. This data was supplemented by an excel spreadsheet 

containing relevant data for the recent programme of 74 RC drillholes provided by Goldbelt. All information 

from current drillholes, including the associated assay data, was loaded into Datamine Studio (v2.1.1444) 

software. The new topographic data was available for use in this resource update. 

Original hard copy drillhole logs were previously examined in the Ouagadougou office in January 2007. Data 

from the latest drill programme was taken on face value after completion of QA/QC analysis by Ravensgate. 

A thorough review of the deposit statistics was carried out for sample support considerations. Raw sample 

data was analysed, and was then composited to a standard 2.0m down-hole composite length. This 

composite sample length was seen to reduce the variance of the sample population significantly, without a 

significant loss of the ore zone interval "resolution". The 2.0m composited data-set of diamond and RC drilling 

data was used to develop semi-variograms for the deposit domains, and the resultant data was used in the 

Block Model interpolation calculations.  

The data overall was deemed by Ravensgate to be of acceptable quality.  

4.11.2 Geological Model 

Methods of geological modelling adopted for the Inata mineralised area. 

Ravensgate modified the existing set of Datamine wireframes defining the mineralised envelopes using a 

broad lower cut-off of 0.3g/t Au. Mineralisation was also constrained by structural control, particularly by 

interpreted axial planar shears with a strike of 030o to 040o and average dip of 50o to the north-northwest.  

This resulted in numerous structurally separated domains, and thrust "stacking" of the mineralisation is 

evident, particularly in the Inata North area. These are in keeping with structural observation and 

interpretations made previously by SRK Consulting (McCuaig, Campbell and Gardner, 2002), and 

observations made by Ravensgate and Goldbelt Personnel. The previous interpretations were adjusted to 

account for the new topographic surface, and to incorporate the additional information from the recent RC 

drilling programme. 

A set of geological wireframes defining intrusive felsic porphyry and graphitic shale packages was also 

constructed for the previous resource estimate, using interpretations made during the site visit in collaboration 

with Joseph Sawadogo and Dr. Francois Ouedraogo of Goldbelt. These wireframes were adjusted in line with 

the change in topographic elevation as a result of the new survey data, and used to code a separate set of 

geological block models for later addition to the mineralisation block models. The figure below shows the 

combined wireframes, with mineralisation in red, graphitic shale in purple, and felsic porphyry in orange.

4.11.3 Compositing, Spatial Domaining and Statistical Analysis 

4.11.3.1 Methods adopted for the Inata deposits 

The complete drillhole database was subset into domains using the wireframe solids produced within the 

Datamine Studio software. Downhole compositing to 2.0m of the sub-sets was then applied; which provides a 

consistent sample length and therefore significantly improving localized geostatistical "sample support".  

Analysis of the strike change within the Domain 109 solid of Inata South resulted in it being sub-divided into 

two domains, 109 and 119, based primarily upon the marked strike change.  Hard wire-frame boundaries 

were used for the model, with one drillhole section having overlap with soft boundaries used for the coding 

assay data for the domains. 

Once the composite database was verified, an entire new set of analytical statistics for Au and length for each 

domain was generated. Analysis of the statistical data, population percentiles, and graphical logarithmic and 

histogram presentations, allowed the consideration of any requirement for "top cut" applications. In this 

instance it was determined that most domains did not require any top cut of the data, and several domains 

had a top cut of 30g/t Au applied. A series of log and histogram plots describing the constrained composites 

was produced for each of the deposit DOMAINs in the graph collection which is included in the the Appendix. 

A comprehensive set of reports of raw drillhole samples and sample composites by domain and by drill type is 

included also in the tables following. 

Declustering of the composite data for the different areas as a whole, and within the individual Domains was 

undertaken; and coupled with analysis of the variable drill density. This was then used to determine a parent 

cell size with dimensions 6m East x 12.5m North x 5m Elevation for Inata North, Inata South and Sayouba; 

whilst parent cells of 12.5m East x 6m North x 5m Elevation were employed for the Minfo deposit. Sub-celling 

of this parent cell size up to 10 times in each direction to fit the interpreted domain wireframes was also used 

in Datamine Studio during the block modelling process.

4.11.4 Variography 

Variography Methods adopted for the Inata deposits: 

A set of directional variograms was generated using the Datamine Studio programme VGRAM and VARFIT 

functions for the domains at the Inata deposits.  Downhole variograms were developed to assess various 

parameters including the nugget and sill values for different localized parts of the deposit. Then "follow-up" 

variogram modelling was attempted and ultimately "best fit" curves were constructed to describe sample 

variances and ranges both along strike and down-dip. For estimation using Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK), 

variograms were developed using the 30, 50, 75, 85, and 95 percentile cut-off values for each set of domains. 

All the variograms were calculated and developed using the 2.0m down-hole composite set of diamond drilling 

data for sets of comparable domains; with 3 groups for Inata North, 3 groups for Inata South, 2 groups for 

Minfo, and a single group of domains for Sayouba. The variograms generated are included for review in the 

Appendix.

4.11.5 Block Model Construction – General Description 

4.11.5.1 Methods of Block Modelling and Kriging Adopted for the Inata Deposits 

The selection of an appropriate parent cell estimation block size was carefully considered during the 

mineralisation geometry review, as the density of data points within the various domains varies. An optimal

block size adequately defines the ore zones within the block model, whilst simultaneously not compromising 

the localised calculated block variances. The drill spacing generally centred on 50m northing intervals, with 

areas of 25m spacing; which is reasonable given the ranges generated in the variography study. The parent 

cell estimation block sizes chosen were 6m East by 12.5m North by 5m RL elevation for the Inata North, Inata 

South and Sayouba block models and 12.5m East by 6m North by 5m RL elevation for the Minfo block model; 

but Datamine Studio software allowed extensive sub-celling to "seam fill" within domain wireframes, with sub-

celling of 10mx10mx10m used. 

Ravensgate did not initially elect to use the Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) method at the Inata deposits for 

interpolation of gold values, but was requested by Goldbelt to do so in order to keep additional interpolation 

and estimates in line with previous resource model reporting for the project. The MIK method is not commonly 

used for deposits with clearly and locally constrained sample population sets and / or deposits with relatively 

low coefficients of variation within any given specific mineralisation zone/geological domain, or where 

enhanced restriction of higher grade values is considered appropriate. MIK modelling also inherently has 

some significant difficulties to be overcome with respect to allocating localized grade values from the various 

indicator probabilities when exporting the model information for further pit optimization and reserves and 

scheduling studies. 

The spatial distribution relationships of samples at Inata deposits were closely examined during construction 

phase of the numerous semi-variograms developed for the various mineralised domains within the deposit 

area. These parameters were initially examined with the view to setting up all estimation runs required for 

MIK. However, and as part of standard industry good practice, a set of "equivalent" interpolation runs using 

the Ordinary Kriging (OK) method for gold was also run as a localized calibration and validation of the Multiple 

Indicator Kriging results. The OK runs were also to provide further useful statistical data that was used to help 

in later resource classification considerations. 

The various variogram and search parameters by domain used for input into Datamine Studio software, and 

the fields to be generated are shown in Tables 34 to 40. The estimation parameters by domain used for input 

into Datamine Studio software, were different for the MIK and OK estimation runs. Examples from Minfo are 

shown in Tables 41 and 42. Datamine Studio requires the three input parameter files for variogram, 

estimation, and search parameters for input into the estimation function.

4.11.6 Grade Interpolation and Cut-Off Levels 

4.11.6.1 Smoothing Effects of Grade Interpolation  

Estimated average block grades produced by linear interpolation methods (such as inverse distance and 

ordinary block kriging) may contribute to the smoothing of grade and consequent conditional bias, i.e. the 

over-estimation of low grades and under-estimation of high grades. MIK is a method of interpolation that 

largely mitigates these effects, but the MIK model must be treated very carefully so that "distortions" of the 

underlying grade distribution within the deposit are not compromised. Ideally, the interpolation procedure 

should honour the contact boundary between the mineable ore and the surrounding lower grade 

mineralisation if such a distinct boundary exists. This would avoid smoothing of the grade across boundaries, 

providing a more realistic estimate. The use of reasonably large parent cell estimation blocks also minimizes 

any localised smoothing effects and this is an underlying assumption used in MIK interpolation. However, the 

data density available will also directly govern to a large extent the ability to balance the amount of smoothing 

of grade. 

Methods adopted for the Inata deposits: 

The distribution of gold composite grades within the project area ore zones was examined in detail. 

Ravensgate observed that the gold composite data set by domain displayed low coefficients of variation, and 

generally did not warrant any application of top cuts. However, top cuts of 30g/t were applied to a small 

number of the domains based upon the statistical analysis and also considering the estimation technique to 

be applied. 

4.11.7 Mineral Resource Classification  

The estimated block models carried values for number of composites used to estimate the block (NS field), 

and search volume number (SV) in which the block was estimated. Several other fields were calculated in the 

OK model which can then be used to calculate a field for Kriged Efficiency (KE). The OK and MIK models

were then combined, and the three fields NS, SV, and KE were then used to assign points to a new field 

Quality; and the value of the Quality field was then used to assign a Resource Category field (RESCAT). 

Plots of the calculated values for the KE, NS, ZZ (slope of regression), and SV fields are included in the

Table 65  Block Model Validation – Raw Drillhole Data and 2m Composites (Un-declustered and 
Declustered) versus Block Model Grades by Area 

 

 

Table 62 shows a comparison of block model grades to the raw assay and 2.0m composite grades and also 

the declustered composite statistics. All domains exhibit acceptable correlation results. The Swath Plot graphs 

in the Appendix, show the block model grades in comparison to the composite grades by elevation and 

northing. In general, the results are good, with some smoothing of the uppermost composite grades, as some 

"rapid" change in grade tenor is expected. The level of smoothing overall is considered acceptable and the 

interpolation process has performed as expected. The ordinary kriged model returned slightly higher block 

grades in the uppermost grade categories, but has overall compared favourably to the MIK model as 

expected. Example plans and sections through the models are displayed in the following figures, with a full set 

of figures in the Appendix. 

Adjustments were made to small Sayouba domains 336 and 339, with all Measured and Indicated Resource 

material reclassified to Inferred Resource due to some uncertainty in the results of the MIK estimation runs in 

relation to the composite statistics.

4.11.8 Canadian and Australian Mineral Resource Codes 

A comparison between the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines 

(prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council August 20, 

2000) and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, or JORC code,  

(prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 

Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia (JORC) and effective from September 

1999) is set out in the following table: 

 
Table 66  Mineral Resource Definitions 

Comparison of Mineral Resource Definitions 
Canadian Code (CIM) 2000 Australian JORC Code (AusIMM) 2004 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a 

Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 

quality can be estimated on the basis of 

geological evidence and limited sampling and 

reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological 

and grade continuity. The estimate is based on 

limited information and sampling gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as 

outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a 

Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade 

and mineral content can be estimated with a 

low level of confidence. It is inferred from 

geological evidence and assumed but not 

verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is 

based on information gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as 

outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes 

which may be limited or of uncertain quality 

and reliability. 

 

 

4.11.9 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Mineral Resources for the Inata Deposits were classified in accordance with NI43-101 and the Australian 

JORC Code (2004). A Mineral Resource summary is given in the table for the Inata Project Area.

4.11.10 Reliability and Confidence in the Resource Estimates 

The data for the Inata Deposits has been obtained over a number of years by several companies; but the 

majority of the mineralised intercepts used in the resource estimation have been obtained by Goldbelt or 

Resolute using well-documented procedures, and Ravensgate is of the opinion that the bulk of the drillhole 

data is of high quality with respect to its method of collection.  In general, Ravensgate considers the mineral 

resources for the Inata Deposits to be robust. The local scale faulting and remobilisation engenders a higher 

degree of local small-scale complexity which may not be fully represented by the current data density.  Table 

67 provides a summary of the of the sampling techniques and data review which associated with the historical 

and current drillhole data. 

 

Table 68  Sampling Techniques and Data Review 

Sampling techniques  Diamond core was cut by diamond saw according to lithological 
and mineralisation intervals and dispatched to the laboratories. 

Drilling techniques  The Inata Deposits are based upon the results of good quality 
RC and diamond drill core. 

Drill sample recovery  Diamond drill core recovery is recorded, and is locally poor in 
the uppermost weathered horizon. 

Logging  All diamond core samples were geologically logged for geology, 
with all recent drillholes logged for geotechnical data, and 
structure. A well documented geological logging standard has 
been used for the entire Goldbelt and Resolute programmes. 

Sub-sampling 
techniques and sample 
preparation 

 Diamond core was sampled using a diamond saw (or cleaving in 
weathered material) to provide half core based upon 
geological/mineralisation intervals.  

Quality of assay data 
and laboratory tests 

 Samples assayed at a variety of laboratories in Ghana and 
Burkina Faso (see Section 13). 

 Samples analysed for gold by fire assay. 
Verification of sampling 
and assaying 

 Assay quality control measures for Goldbelt are current and 
well-documented. Resolute employed standard procedures 
similar to those of Goldbelt. 

 Submission of gold standards is standard practice. 
Location of data points  Drillhole positions have been surveyed using Differential GPS 

and/or Total Station systems.  
 Downhole Televiewer readings taken on some 2006 Goldbelt 

drillholes.  
Data density and 
distribution 

 Average drillhole density at Inata Deposits ranges from 25m x 
20m to 100m x 30m – predominantly 50m x 20m. 

Orientation of data in 
relation to geological 
structure 

 Diamond drillholes were oriented, wherever possible, 
perpendicular to the mineralised structures. 

Audits or reviews  Periodic reviews for Goldbelt of QA/QC data and procedures. 
 Ravensgate has verified the site procedures on site as far as 

was practicable during the site visit.

Database integrity  Goldbelt employs a system of validation of all data, with 
attempted exclusion of unreliable data. However, the 
system can still be improved further. 

Geological 
interpretation 

 Interpretation of the lithological boundaries and the 
proposal of a conceptual model for the mineralisation are 
supported by a sufficient amount of drilling. Geological 
continuity is based upon a coherent and predictable 
model, and is confirmed in both sectional and plan 
analyses.  

 A geological model was developed for Inata Deposits 
using all available RC and diamond core data. Three 
dimensional mineralised wireframes were constructed 
using the geological models as a guide, and these were 
subsequently filled with blocks for resource estimation. 
Further drilling and/or mapping is expected to refine the 
geological model in the future. 

Dimensions  The Inata Deposits comprises a broadly north-south (east-
west at Minfo) trending zone of mineralisation comprising 
5km strike length, 200m depth extent; with local and 
regional offsets along flat fault or shear structures. 

Estimation and 
modeling techniques 

 The resource estimations presented here were generated 
using standard 3D block modelling techniques and 
specifically the Multiple Indicator Kriging Interpolation 
technique. This series of calculations required a rigorous 
review of the localised deposit geostatistics. A small 
number of higher grade outlier samples requiring top-cut 
application were identified for gold.  Parent cell block sizes 
for Inata Deposits was set at 6m E x 12.5m N x 5m 
elevation (12.5m E x 6m N x 5m elevation for Minfo).  

 Classification of resources also relied on ancillary Block 
Model interpolation items such as "kriged efficiency", 
number of sample composites available within block 
vicinity, and search volume pass. The final block model 
grades were checked with respect to the local domain 
geometry and domain statistical summaries. Only once 
the assumptions used in the data generation and 
compilation were eliminated or minimized, was the data 
used in these block model calculations. The localised 
variations in drilling and sampling density were carefully 
considered.  

Moisture  Tonnage calculations were carried out on a dry basis to 
conform to reported assay results. 

Cut-off parameters 
 

 All Mineral Resources have been reported are at lower 
cut-off of 0.5g/t Au. 

Mining factors or 
assumptions 

 No assumptions were made about mining methods. 

Metallurgical factors 
or assumptions. 

 No assumptions were made about process methods. 

Bulk density  Weathering was delineated by the construction of DTM 
boundaries, with blanket bulk density values applied to 
each zone based upon the available testwork results.

SECTION 5 -  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

5.1 Overview 

Metallurgical sampling and testing was carried out by Resolute and BHP during 1999 to 2002, prior to the 

acquisition of the property by Goldbelt Resources Ltd. The results of that work have been reviewed as part of 

the feasibility study and have been incorporated into the later test work initiated by Goldbelt between 2004 

and 2007.  

The results of these programs indicate a CIL process with gravity concentration will yield recoveries of 93%-

95% in all ore types. Leach kinetics demonstrated that the ore was relatively insensitive to grind size and good 

recoveries were obtained at a grind of 80% passing 106µm.  A conservative approach was employed in the 

process design and a grind of 80% passing 75µm was selected. 

Samples from the zone of major gold mineralisation were collected in the Goldbelt programme of 2004-05 

from diamond drill holes, sometimes twinned with RC holes in order to obtain the maximum amount of 

material for testing. The material submitted for test work included samples of transition and fresh ore to allow 

investigation of the metallurgical characteristics of all three ore types. Holes INRC 913 and INRC 914 were 

collected from the southern part of the Inata North orebody which Goldbelt believe to be the best part of this 

orebody, from where the major part of the ore will be sourced. Samples have also been obtained from drill 

holes in Inata Central (INRC 912) and Inata South (INRC 911).  

The Inata oxide ore demonstrated mild preg-robbing characteristics which were overcome in the conventional 

cyanide in leach (CIL) process.  Some unweathered (fresh) ore reflected higher pre-robbing characteristic.  

These fresh ores responded well to pretreatment with kerosene and good recoveries were obtained. However, 

the fresh ore presents a minor proportion of the orebody and it is proposed that such ore will be stockpiled 

and treated towards the end of the mine life.     

Initial test work showed there that gold could be recovered by gravity concentration, the amount varying from 

about 8 to >80%.  The introduction of gravity concentration to remove the coarse gold prior to leaching was 

investigated and found to reduce leaching time greatly but did not increase overall recovery significantly.  

Since gravity concentration recovers gold before the addition of cyanide, reducing the quantity of gold at risk 

to loss due to "preg-robbing" will be an additional advantage.  The operating costs for reagent consumption 

were determined from whole process test work, i.e. gravity concentration with leaching of the gravity tails. 

The Bond work Index determination showed the oxide ore from the Central ore body to be very soft (Wi about 

6 kWh/t) while the oxide ore in the North ore body was moderately soft (Wi about 10.5 kWh/t).  The indices for 

transition ore from the North ore body were 13.2 kWh/t and 14.0 kWh/t and from the Central ore body 9.0 

kWh/t.  In the case of fresh ore, one sample (INDD 22) showed a work index of 15.2 kWh/t while the other 

was suspiciously low at 9.0 kWh/t. A value of 15.0 kWh/t was assumed for this sample.  The work index for 

fresh ore from Central ore body at 9.9 kWh/t was again significantly lower than the same fresh material from 

the North orebody.  The Mine Plan has taken cognisance of these work index values to achieve a blended mill 

feed with a work index which will allow a plant throughput of 2.25 million tonnes annually to be maintained.

5.2 Ore Characterisation 

The oxide rock mass is extensively sheared and is expected to be highly weathered and dry. As might be 

expected, due to the extensive weathering the oxide ore is the softest ore type. Fresh ore is the hardest ore 

type with hardness of transition ore being between these extremes. Some areas of the transition and fresh ore 

zones of the deposit contain "preg-robbing" shale which requires to be passivated with kerosene before 

cyanidation. It would seem that the incidence of ore requiring kerosene pre-conditioning is not restricted to a 

particular ore type in the non-oxide phases or from a discrete area of the deposit. One recommendation for 

further testing of ore material and associated gold recoveries, (once ore production is under-way), is to select 

relatively large (truck dump) ore parcels of both transition and / ore fresh material at regular time intervals and 

place them in an "open weathering" environment to determine if there is a significant effect on recovery of 

stock-piled and "aged" ore material over time. 

 

5.3 Initial Test Work 

5.3.1 AMMTEC Report A6611 

In March 1999, as part of the initial test work carried out for BHP/Resolute Ltd., four composite samples of 

Inata material were tested by AMMTEC of Australia.  

Notes in the margin identify the samples as, 

• T128827 - Low grade oxide (0-14m) 

• T128828 - High grade oxide (6-45m) 

• T128829 - Low grade oxide/trans (48-45m) 

• T128830 - High grade oxide/trans (61-90m)  

The samples were crushed to minus 2mm prior to splitting into both 1kg mill charges and 200g assay 

samples.  Duplicate head assays compared well, with less than 5% variation between assays.  Gravity 

recovery was tested on samples ground to 80% passing either 106 or 75 microns using a small Knelson 

concentrator followed by amalgamation.  All gravity and amalgam tailings were combined then subjected to 

cyanide leaching.  The results, which were presented in AMMTEC Report A6611, are summarized in Table 

71.

*The slurry was oxygen sparged in this test. 

The tests indicate that the material is not particularly grind sensitive below 100 microns.  The ninety per cent 

plus recoveries achieved in oxide samples were similar to results obtained from 24 bottle roll tests at ITS 

laboratory in Ouagadougou.  Due to the relatively low recoveries in transition samples, oxygen sparging tests 

were performed on the T128829 106 micron sample.  The use of the oxygen sparging gave an overall 

recovery of 90% after two hours contact time with cyanide solution. 

Viscosity measurements carried out at three levels of slurry density indicated that a density of about 45% 

solids should be employed. 

5.3.2 AMMTEC Report A6922 

The next report issued in August 1999, gave details of the testing of shale material for its "preg-robbing" 

potential.  A sample INRD 09, described as a barren black shale carbon material, was contacted with a 

standard gold solution.  After 24 hours contact time, the gold content of the solution had been reduced from 

1.96 mg/l to 0.075 mg/l, indicating the material's ability to adsorb gold from solution. 

In the next report in the sequence, AMMTEC Report A7029 (December 1999), contained the results of 

investigations of the potential for "preg-robbing" of the ore.  12 samples of Inata North oxide and transition 

(INNO-Ox and INNO-Tr) ore and of Inata Central oxide and transition (INCE-Ox and INCE-Tr) ore with visible 

shale content were hand selected before being contacted with standard gold solution for 6 hours.  After 6 

hours contact time, all but one of 12 solutions showed a reduction in gold content, indicating that "preg 

robbing" had taken place.  In two of the tests, the reduction in gold content was > 90%; in four of the tests, the 

reduction was 50-80%; in three of the tests, the reduction was 30-40% and in two of the tests, the reduction 

was < 10%. 

Three of the samples tested with the standard gold solution were then subjected to a CIL test of 48 hours 

duration.

There is a degree of correlation between these results, the sample showing the least adsorption in the "preg-

robbing" test giving the highest extraction and the sample showing the highest adsorption in the "preg-

robbing" test giving the lowest extraction. 

Four composites were then made of the material from the trays and these were treated by CIL.

The use of CIL gave similar results (94-95%) for the oxide ore as noted in AMMTEC Report A6611.  The 

results from the transition ore at 81-89% covered a greater range than those reported in A6611 but were not 

dissimilar. 

5.3.3 AMMTEC Report A7259  

This report of March 2000 contains the results of Bond Work Index determinations on the four ore types.

The results are highly suspect since the oxide ore is clearly much softer than the transition ore. 

5.3.4 AMMTEC Report A7326  

In the next series, the results of which were reported in May 2000, the various process steps found to be 

beneficial were brought together to simulate the probable flow sheet.  The same samples, the results from 

which were reported in A7029, were treated in this exercise.  These tests differed from the A7029 tests in that:

• Since the results given in A 6611, indicated little difference between the results from the two grind 

sizes, grind P80 of 106 µm was used instead of one of P80 of 75 µm. 

• Gravity recoverable gold was removed prior to leaching. 

• Preconditioning of gravity tails with kerosene was employed as this often improves gold extraction 

by passivating the "preg-robbing" sites of the carbonaceous materials in the ore.  

• The leach pulp would be sparged with oxygen, since this was found to be beneficial as reported in 

A6611.

In spite of the inclusion of these "improvements", as may be seen from the results presented in Table 75, 

three of the four tests showed slower leach kinetics and lower extraction than the corresponding test, whose 

results (given in italics), have been given in Table 73.  The fourth test showed faster kinetics initially than the 

corresponding A7029 test but the latter caught up and finally gave a slightly better extraction.  AMMTEC 

presumed that the poorer results could be attributed to the coarser size used in the tests, which is probably 

correct but the test should have been repeated using material ground to P80 of 75µm. 

5.3.5 AMMTEC Report A8186  

In the final report in the series, (June 2002), the results of tests to compare the use of CIL and RIL are given.  

Two samples of Inata Central Transition ore composite were pre-conditioned with kerosene before being 

subjected to RIL, one test using new resin and the other using regenerated resin.

5.4 Goldbelt Resources' Test Work 

5.4.1 Introduction  

A drilling programme was conducted in 2004-2005 by Goldbelt Resources and the samples obtained from this 

exercise were submitted for metallurgical testing.  Samples from the zone of major gold mineralization were 

collected from diamond drill holes, sometimes twinned with RC holes in order to obtain the maximum amount 

of material for testing.  The material submitted for test work included samples of transition and fresh ore to 

allow investigation of the metallurgical characteristics of all three ore types.  Holes INRC 913 and INRC 914 

were collected from the southern part of the Inata North orebody which Goldbelt believe to be the best part of 

this orebody, from where the major part of the ore will be sourced.  Samples have also been obtained from 

drill holes in Inata Central (INRC 912) and Inata South (INRC 911).  In this collection of samples from oxide, 

transition and fresh ore zones, included was material that was thought to have the potential to cause 

metallurgical problems, (graphitic shale with "preg-robbing" characteristics and high sulphide material where 

there may be intimate associations with gold).  All these samples from holes INRC 911-INRC 914 were 

submitted for metallurgical testing to AMMTEC, whose results form the conclusions set out in sections 5.4.2-

5.4.5.  Samples of oxide, transition and fresh ore from INDD 21 and 22 in the North Zone and from INDD 23 in 

the Central Zone were also sent to AMMTEC for determination of Bond work indices. 

Goldbelt believe that it has addressed the important criteria and that the 2004-05 samples are more 

representative of the Inata mineralization than samples collected in the BHP/Resolute work programme.  

5.4.2 CIL Test Work 

While the results of the work carried out for BHP/Resolute were obtained in a program of test work, which 

largely employed the direct cyanide leaching; the programme conducted on the ten composites samples 

obtained by Goldbelt investigated whether carbon in leach (CIL) was a more suitable approach.  The results of 

this exercise are shown in Table 77.

The samples were collected from three areas of the deposit; oxide and transition samples 911 came from 

Inata South, oxide, transition and fresh (sulphide) samples 912 came from Inata Central while the remaining 

five samples came from Inata North.

A grind of 80% passing 75 µm was employed throughout.  The need for the use of CIL is clearly demonstrated 

by these results. The recoveries obtained by direct cyanide leaching oxide composite samples for 48 hours 

ranged from 90.17 – 98.67%, giving an arithmetical average of 94.69%.  This includes the result from oxide 

sample 912, where, although the leach residue assay was lower in the CIL test, the recovery by direct 

leaching was inflated by a sample head grade of 13.95 g/t, much greater than that of the CIL test sample.  

When CIL was employed, the results were superior in every case (except oxide sample 912).  CIL recoveries 

ranged from 94.34-97.71% to give an arithmetical average of 95.97%.  From these results, it would appear 

that "preg-robbing" in oxide ore is not a major problem and it may be resolved by the application of CIL.  

The results from the transition and fresh ore samples were much more variable. The recoveries from transition 

samples obtained by direct leaching ranged from 12.50-90.69% (average 59.28%); while those from CIL 

ranged from 77.68-95.08% (average 88.76%).  In the case of fresh ore, the recoveries obtained by direct 

leaching ranged from 1.46-90.95% (average 31.88%); while those from CIL ranged from 47.36-94.67% 

(average 67.85%). Thus, with transition and fresh ore, there were samples e.g. transition samples 911 and

912 from Inata South and Central respectively and a fresh sample 914 from Inata North, where "preg-robbing" 

could controlled by the use of CIL to give recoveries similar to those obtained from oxide ore; while there were 

also samples of fresh and transition ore (fresh samples 912 and 913 and transition sample 913), where "preg-

robbing" was only partially countered by the use of CIL to give recoveries of 47.36-77.68%.   

The samples were subsequently analysed for organic carbon and the variation in results was then 

explainable.  The organic carbon contents were low for all the oxide samples (0.09% was highest) but this 

seemed to be enough to depress recovery when direct leaching was employed by about 1.2% (or 2.0% 

without the oxide sample 912 results). 

In contrast to the results from oxide samples, which all gave recoveries in excess of 90% irrespective of the 

leaching method, the results from the transition and fresh ore samples were much more variable and this 

would seem to be attributable to the organic carbon content, which ranged from 0.07% to 4.60%.  The carbon 

contents of fresh sample 914 (organic carbon 0.07%) and transition sample 912 (organic carbon 0.09%) were 

similar to those observed with oxide ores, the recoveries at about 91% by direct leaching and about 94% by 

CIL being within the range of results obtained from oxide samples. 

The organic carbon content of transition sample 911 was 0.82% but its recovery by CIL was 95.08%.  On the 

evidence of this one sample, such a level of organic carbon would not seem to present a problem.  However, 

with fresh sample 912, transition sample 913 and fresh sample 913, whose organic carbon contents were 

1.25%, 1.51% and 4.60% respectively, the use of CIL alone does not give satisfactory results.  The organic 

carbon level does not seem to be the sole factor; fresh sample 912 with a carbon content of 1.25% gave a 

recovery of 1.46% by direct leaching and 61.51% by CIL, while transition sample 913 with a higher carbon 

content of 1.51% gave a recovery of 12.50% by direct leaching and 77.68% by CIL.  Thus the carbon in fresh 

sample 912 would seem to be more active than that in transition sample 913.  Fresh sample 913, with an 

average head grade of only 0.513 g/t, was not ore grade but, despite its high organic carbon content of 

4.60%, it gave a higher recovery by direct leaching than fresh sample 912, whose organic carbon content was 

1.25%; again suggesting there is a variation in the "preg-robbing" propensity of the naturally occurring carbon. 

5.4.3 Kerosene Pre-conditioning Test Work 

Pre-conditioning with kerosene prior to CIL to passivate the "preg-robbing" species was investigated for the 

samples (912 fresh and 913 transition) where the use of CIL did not produce satisfactory results.  The effect of 

increasing the dosage of kerosene was investigated in tests that used air or oxygen sparging.  The results are 

presented in Table 78. 

The initial tests, where dosages of 1000 ml/t and below were used, were conducted on ore samples, which 

had not undergone any pre-treatment but the later tests, where dosages of kerosene of 1500 and 2000ml/t 

were employed, were carried out on samples of 912 fresh and 913 transition, which had previously been 

subjected to gravity concentration.  On the basis of the residue assays, it would seem that, with a gravity 

concentration pre-treatment, a kerosene dosage of 1500ml/t gives optimum results and that the use of air or 

oxygen sparing gives equally good results.  The recoveries may be somewhat inflated due to higher head 

grades in these later tests where the higher kerosene dosages were employed.

5.4.4 Milling Test Work 

Further testwork was carried out to investigate the optimum grind for Inata ore.  Seven samples were ground 

to four 80% passing sizes (38 µm, 75 µm, 106 µm and 150 µm) before being subjected to CIL cyanidation.   

As may be seen from the results presented in Table 79, a grind with an 80% passing size of 38 µm gave the 

highest recoveries from four of the seven samples (oxide samples 911, 914, transition sample 912 and fresh 

sample 914).  In one of the tests (oxide sample 913), grinding to 80% passing size 75 µm gave the best result, 

while, in two tests (oxide sample 912 and transition sample 911), the best results were obtained where 

comparatively coarse grinds of 80% passing size 150 µm were employed.  In case of oxide sample 912, the 

high value of feed sample in the test using a grind of 80% passing size 150 µm inflated the recovery and the 

optimal indicated result was that from the test employing a grind of 80% passing size 75 µm, which gave the 

lowest value of leach residue.

In most cases, the difference in recoveries between the tests where grinds of 80% passing 38 µm were used 

and those where the grinds were 80% passing 75 µm did not justify the required increase in power required to 

achieve the finer grind, thus a grind of 80% passing 75 µm was adopted.

5.4.5 Gravity Concentration 

In a separate set of tests, the composite samples listed in Table 79 were treated in a Knelson concentrator 

after grinding 80% passing 75 µm.  The concentrate from the Knelson was amalgamated.  The amount of gold 

recovered by gravity concentration/amalgamation varied from 8.8% (913 oxide) to 88.6 (912 oxide), the 

arithmetical average being 40.8%.

Since these results indicated the desirability of including gravity concentration in the circuit, the effect of 

leaching gravity tailings was then investigated.  The samples were treated on a Knelson concentrator, the 

concentrate from which was subjected to intensive cyanidation, in the presence of carbon.  The Knelson 

tailings and intensive cyanidation leach residue were combined and treated by CIL to give the results shown 

in Table 80.  

It will be seen from the results represented in  

Table 81 , that the introduction of gravity concentration allows a significantly reduced leach time but generally 

the leach residues were higher and hence, the recoveries lower than those obtained by straight CIL.  It is 

difficult to believe that removing the coarse free gold prior would give poorer recoveries than leaching in the 

presence of these coarse particles so check assays were requested.  The assay samples from the straight 

CIL tests were no longer available for checking so only the gravity/CIL leach residues could be submitted for 

check assays.

It will be seen from the results shown in Table 82 that the repeat assays were lower in every case than the 

original assays, some significantly so.  In addition, it will be seen that, based on the  repeat assay results, the 

overall average recovery from treating oxide ore by gravity concentration followed by CIL leaching is 95.21%; 

from treating non-graphitic transition ore by the same process average recovery is 95.0% and from fresh ore 

like 914 fresh, 94.05%.  The corresponding figures from treating these ore samples by straight CIL are very 

similar being 95.97%, 94.30% and 94.67% respectively.  Using the average of the five assay figures, the 

results are slightly poorer.   

From the results presented in  

Table 81 and Table 83, it is clear that introduction of gravity concentration does not improve recovery 

significantly but leaching time is greatly reduced; in six of the seven cases leaching was complete after 8 

hours.

5.4.6 Determination of Bond Work Indices 

The determination of Bond Work Indices was carried out on samples collected from Goldbelt Resources' 

drilling programme.  The results were in line with observations on ore hardness made in the field.

5.5 Conclusion 

The results of these programs indicate a CIL process with gravity concentration will yield recoveries of 93%-

95% in all ore types.  

In the tests performed to determine the optimum grind generally recovery increased with decreasing grind size 

but in most cases the difference in recoveries between the tests where grinds of 80% passing 38 µm were 

used and those where the grinds were 80% passing 75 µm did not justify the required increase in power 

required to achieve the finer grind, thus a grind of 80% passing 75 µm was adopted. 

The Bond Work Index tests found distinct differences amongst all three species of ore from the North and 

Central orebodies, the latter all being softer.  The Wi values varied from about 6-10.5 kWh/t for oxide ore, 

which contain most of the gold values. The variation of Wi values was 9.0-13.5 kwh/t for transition ore and 9.9 

-15.0 kWh/t for fresh ore.  The Mine Plan has taken cognisance of these work index values to achieve a 

blended mill feed with a work index which will allow a plant throughput of at least 2.25 million tonnes annually 

to be maintained. 

 Varying degrees of preg-robbing activity will be encountered in the treatment of Inata ore.  On existing 

evidence, this not a serious problem with oxide ore, which forms the bulk of the deposit, as the mild "preg-

robbing" problem can be resolved by the use of  CIL to give recoveries of about 95%.   With other samples of 

transition and fresh ore where the carbon content was 1.0%, the use of CIL will not be sufficient to obtain 

satisfactory results and pre-conditioning of the ore with kerosene will be required.  Test work, albeit on only 

two samples, indicates that the optimum recovery from these samples will be obtained by employing a

conditioning is not restricted to a particular ore type in the non-oxide phases or from a discrete area of the 

deposit.  It seems to be related to carbon content and the correlation of refractoriness with carbon content 

would be worth investigation.  Kerosene pre-conditioning will only be required periodically and, if such a 

relationship exists, it can be used to give warning of the need to bring the kerosene pre-conditioning circuit 

into operation. 

The introduction of gravity concentration to remove the coarse gold prior to leaching would allow a significant 

reduction in leaching time but when the recoveries after 48 hours are compared there is little difference 

whether gravity concentration is employed or not.  It will also recover gold before the addition of cyanide, 

thereby reducing the quantity of gold at risk to loss due to "preg-robbing".

SECTION 6 -  MINING AND RESERVES 

6.1 Introduction 

Orelogy Pty Ltd (Orelogy) was retained by Goldbelt Resources Ltd (Goldbelt) to prepare a detailed mine plan 

to Bankable Feasibility Study standards (costs ± 15%) based on the following design criteria: 

• Latest topographical survey completed in early July 2007, 

• Resource models developed by Ravensgate Geological Consultants (Ravensgate) and 

completed in mid July 2007, 

• Process and design criteria supplied by GBM Mech (GBM) based on a 2.25 mtpa throughput, 

• Geotechnical information supplied by George Orr and Associates, 

• Owner operator mining cost estimates developed by Orelogy based on fully supported cost 

estimates, and 

• Other general information supplied by Goldbelt. 

Two site visits by Mr. Steve Craig, Managing Director and Principal Consultant with Orelogy were completed 

during April 2006 and June 2007, during which an overall site reconnaissance was undertaken and a drillhole 

core review was completed.  

There is minimal topographical relief over the entire project as illustrated in Figure 67.  To the east and south 

of the project lie seasonal drainage channels.  These channels will be dammed to provide water for the 

process plant.

There are a number of artisanal miners located within the Inata tenements. However, the bulk of the Inata 

project is free of any artisanal workings, with the only affected area identified during site visits being to the 

south west of the mining areas examined as part of this study. 

The orebody shear zone presents at surface in numerous locations as illustrated in  

Figure 68 and is a typical competent, quartz rich shear zone which will require some drill and blast from the 

surface.

current northern limit of Inata North (beyond the hill in background) 

 
 
 

6.2 Pit Optimisation 

All pit optimisation work was performed using WHITTLE 4X optimisation software.  The 3D resource block 

models were coded to allow for mining and processing cost adjustment factors, slope codes and was then 

limited using the latest topographical information. The models were then exported into a format suitable for 

uploading into WHITTLE 4X optimization software.  

6.2.1 Geotechnical 

George, Orr and Associates were commissioned by Goldbelt to undertake the geotechnical investigation for 

developing open pits at the Inata project.  Extensive investigations were undertaken within the three areas 

defined as:

• Inata North 

• Inata Central 

• Inata South 

No investigations were completed in the Minfo and Sayouba deposits during the course of the BFS and the 

position has been taken that the slope design established for the Inata pits will be used as a guide for these 

two areas.  However, prior to mining at Minfo and Sayouba a detailed geotechnical investigation will be 

undertaken to ensure these parameters are confirmed and/or updated. These areas will be mined at the end 

of the scheduled mine life. 

Data sources for the geotechnical investigation included: 

• Previous geotechnical assessments, 

• Structural geological information prepared by SRK Consulting, 

• Interpretations made from boreholes and core photography from 15 holes located in the Inata 

North, Central and South deposits, 

• Information on rock defects and orientations using an optical televiewer on a number of holes 

located in Inata North, 

• Unconfined compressive strength tests carried out on core from geotechnical holes by 

AMMTEC Limited in Perth, 

• Geological sections supplied by both Goldbelt and Ravensgate,  

• Observations on the site geology and diamond drill core made during site visit in July 2006 as 

well as discussions with various personnel. 

Generally speaking the topography is quite flat with a slight dip to the south.  The gold mineralisation is based 

on quartz veining contained within a regional shear zone striking north-south.  This trend has rotated to the 

east-west for Minfo. The width of the trend varies from 10 to up to 60 metres in width and dips steeply the 

west at angles ranging from 60 to 80º. 

Rock units consist of a surface duracrust layer which is approximately 5 metres thick. Underlying this are a 

sequence of sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Birimian Group of lower Proterozoic age (about 

1.8 to 2.2 Ma).  They comprise faulted and folded argillites, siltstones, tuffs and black (carbonaceous and graphitic) 

shale, intruded by steep west and east dipping felsic (porphyry) dykes.  Felsic intrusive contacts, where sheared, 

are graphitic in some instances. 

Figure 69 to Figure 71 show idealised cross-sections through Inata North, Central and South. 

On average, strongly to slightly weathered rocks occur to depths of 125 metres for Inata North, 132 metres for Inata 

Central and 100 metres for Inata South, however, care will need to be taken, as these could vary significantly from 

this average value. No details on rock weathering where available for Sayouba and Minfo.  

Groundwater depths have been estimated to be from 110 to 160 metres below surface with this depth being 

interpreted from data supplied by Ravensgate.  Groundwater, if present, would be expected to take place from

geological structures located in moderately weathered to fresh rocks.  The interpretation is that "dry" mining 

conditions should prevail. 

Intact rock strengths show that in general, the weathered rock is moderately weak (mean values ranging from 6 to 

10 MPa), and the fresh rock is moderately strong (mean values ranging from 19 to 43 MPa). The UCS test results 

also showed that most of the specimens failed in shear along bedding, foliation and or joints. 

The principal geological structures can be summarised as foliation planes (dipping at 70 to 90º, striking 250 to 

300º), fractures, graphitic structures and lithological contacts.

6.3  Geotechnical Engineering 

George, Orr and Associates carried out a geotechnical investigation for the Inata Gold Project. This report can 

be found in the Appendix. 

6.3.1 Rock Mass Quality 

Weathered rocks are judged to range locally from "blocky/disturbed/seamy" to "very blocky", with "poor" 

surface conditions.  Likely Geological Strength Index (GSI) values range from 25 to 40.  These low GSI values 

reflect on the fractured and foliated nature of the rock observed in cores and the presence of clay-rich 

geological structures. 

Fresh rocks are judged to range locally from "very blocky" to "blocky", with "fair" surface conditions.  Likely 

GSI values range from 50 to 65.  The higher GSI values reflect on the less fractured nature of the rocks 

observed in cores and the absence of clay-rich geological structures.

6.3.2 Potential Wall Failure Mechanisms 

Borehole cores show well developed geological structures in the form of shearing, bedding, foliation and 

jointing, giving rise locally to "blocky", "slabby", and "wedgy" ground conditions.  Future wall instability, should 

this develop where walls are mined at too steep an angle for the prevailing ground conditions, would be 

expected to be governed almost exclusively by the attitude and shear strength properties of the geological 

structures exposed in the wall rocks. 

The assessed "poor" quality of the weathered rocks (reflected by low intact rock strengths and the 

"blocky/disturbed/seamy" to "very blocky" conditions) also implies that there is some potential for rock mass 

(rotational) failures to develop should walls be mined at too steep an angle.  Such failures, if occurrent, would 

involve shearing along and across geological structures and blocks of intact rock.  The potential for this type 

of failure to develop in the pit walls is discussed later. 

Kinematically feasible (gravity-driven) wall failure modes controlled by geological structures have been 

assessed from the stereographic projections. 

The assumptions have been made that geological structures are ubiquitously developed, are sufficiently 

persistent to contribute to failure development, and that these structures display overall defect friction angles 

within the range of 10o to 30o. 

Principal wall failure modes controlled by geological structures that would be expected to occur in the walls of 

future pits (should these be mined at too steep an angle) comprise: 

• Toppling (including pseudo-circular toppling) failures, taking place along steep west dipping foliation 

structures exposed in future west walls at the Inata and Sayouba deposits.  Similar failures could 

detrimentally affect the stability of the south wall at Minfo. 

• Planar sliding (including "stepped path") failures, taking place along "daylighting" geological structures 

undercut in any wall during mining.  Likely principal candidates at Inata and Sayouba include failures 

along west dipping D3 foliation and graphitic shears exposed in the east walls if local slope angles 

exceed around 60o, and south dipping D1 foliation where exposed in the north walls where local slope 

angles exceed around 60o. 

• Wedge failures, taking place along intersections formed by inclined geological structures.  Likely 

candidates at Inata and Sayouba include (but are not limited to) failures occurring along intersections 

formed between south-west and north-west dipping fractures encountered in the east walls, and east, 

south-east and north-east dipping fractures encountered in the west walls.  Current assessments 

indicate that wedge failures could theoretically take place wherever local slope angles exceed around 

40o.  In our experience, these "failures" would normally (but not always) take place as "drop-outs" of 

blocks and wedges of rock during digging of final wall slopes. 

• Rockfalls, involving blocks and wedges of rock bounded by joints and/or joints and blast induced 

fractures.  Rockfalls (involving rock volumes ranging from several cubic decimetres to several cubic 

metres) may be expected in all wall sectors.  If prolific, they could lead to local slope unravelling.

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 181 of 334 

 

Factors increasing the likelihood of future rockfall events include disturbance by blasting of the wall 

rocks, time-related loosening and slaking (progressive deterioration of shale-rich rocks on exposure to 

the atmosphere), undercutting (over steepening) of wall profiles during final digging, and inadequate 

scaling of final bench faces and berm crests. 

The presence of undissipated groundwater pressures within the final wall rocks would be expected to increase 

the likelihood of wall failures taking place during mining. 

6.3.3 Wall Design Parameters 

"Base case" pit wall design parameters considered suitable for use in open pit mining have been based on: 

• The results of the aforementioned kinematic stability assessments. 

• Experience with wall stability in pits of similar depths and geological conditions, mined elsewhere. 

The recommended "base case" design parameters for all pits (including staged variants) are as follows: 

6.3.4 Weathered Rocks 

These rocks occur between surface and vertical depths of 125m at Inata North, around 132m at Inata Central, 

and around 100m at Inata South.  They are expected to make up the majority of walls mined at Inata North 

and Inata Central.  Walls mined at Inata South, Sayouba and Minfo are expected to be mined exclusively in 

weathered rocks. 

The recommended "base case" design parameters for mining in the weathered rock zone for all walls 

incorporate 10m vertical height benches, mined at face angles of 60o, separated by 5m wide berms. 

Wider (10m wide) berms should be incorporated at 40m vertical intervals in walls not containing ramps (for 

example, the planned east walls at the Inata deposits), or where vertical distances between ramp passes 

exceeds 40m. 

Allowance should be made to incorporate a wider berm (minimum 20m wide) at a suitable elevation (to be 

determined from the mining schedule) within the Stage 1 pits to be mined at Inata North and Inata Central.  

The purpose of this wider berm will be to retain (and to allow periodic clean-ups of) material derived from wall 

cutbacks during Stage 2 pit mining.  Planned 10m wide berms (referred to above) could be incorporated in the 

wider berm required to catch material derived from wall cutbacks. 

Wind blown sand deposits, where present, should be stripped from surface to a distance of around 10m 

minimum outside the planned pit perimeter areas. 

6.3.5 Fresh Rocks 

Fresh rocks are expected to be exposed within the lowermost portions of the planned final (Stage 2) pits to be 

mined at Inata North and Inata Central. 

The recommended "base case" design parameters for all walls incorporate 20m vertical height benches, 

mined at face angles of 65o, separated by 5m wide berms.  Stable wall life requirements within the lowermost

portions of the walls would be expected to be limited to several months. An overall pit crest to pit toe wall 

angle of around 43° is achieved over a vertical height of 160m. 

Figure 72 illustrates the final (Stage 2 Pit) Inata North east wall mined to the "base case" wall design 

parameters. An overall pit crest to pit toe wall angle of around 43° is achieved over a vertical height of 160m."

Whilst there was minimal geotechnical investigations completed on Minfo and Sayouba, the above design 

criteria were used during the optimisation and design phases. 

6.3.6 Resource Models 

All of the resource models were prepared by Ravensgate. Detail concerning geology, statistics and resource 

estimation techniques are not part of this scope, and only summary comment will be made. 

The main resource models for Inata/Sayouba and Minfo has been developed using Multi-Indicator Kriging 

(MIK) as the primary estimation technique with Ordinary Kriging (OK) being used for comparison and 

validation of the MIK technique. 

These models were developed using the latest drillhole dataset and were completed in July 2007.  New 

wireframes were created which defined the mineralisation at a gold cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t.  Geological

wireframes defining the porphyry and shale packages were also developed with significant input from site 

based geological staff.  

Bulk density measurements were undertaken by Goldbelt staff and included over 2,100 measurements, of 

which 185 were included within the mineralised zones.  These results are summarised in Table 85.

6.4 Economic Criteria 

6.4.1 Mining Costs 

Goldbelt requested Orelogy to prepare a set of owner/operator based ore and waste mining costs from first 

principles to use for pit optimisation and mining cost estimation purposes.  To achieve this in a timely manner, 

Orelogy approached a number of equipment suppliers including: 

• Hitachi – Netherlands and Australia 

• Komatsu – Belgium and Australia 

• Caterpillar – Australia 

• Sandvik/Tamrock – Australia 

Of these suppliers, Komatsu and Sandvik provided the most detailed capital and operating cost estimates, 

and as such were used as the basis of the cost estimate.  The cost centres included are: 

• Labour, 

• Dewatering,

• Clearing, road construction and rehabilitation costs, 

• Drill and blast, 

• Grade control, 

• ROM Ore rehandle and 

• Load and haul costs by area/depth. 

These costs are summarized in Table 87 in terms of both unit mining and ore specific costs.

6.4.2 Equipment Pricing 

Detailed cost estimates were received from Komatsu Belgium, via their agent for West Africa. Included in 

these estimates were unit capital costs and life-cycle parts costs.  Orelogy estimated all other cost centres. 

The procedure is as follows: 

• Convert all cost estimates to USD, 

• Add in major and minor maintenance hourly cost estimates, plus allowances for routine 

maintenance items and accidental damage, 

• Add in allowance for maintenance fixed costs, 

• Estimate fuel consumption based on "medium" level mining conditions using Komatsu 

handbooks, 

• Estimate lubricant usage, 

• Estimate GET costs where applicable, 

• Estimate tyre life and tyre cost per hour, 

• Combine all variable and fixed costs, and

• Calculate cost per operating hour, and cost by engine hour accounting for availability, 

utilisation and service machine (SMU) factors.  

Exchange rates for USD used in the conversion process are as follows:

6.4.3 Labour 

GBM provided annual salary rates for a range of expatriate and local positions.  These were used to build up 

the mine costs for management, operations, maintenance and technical personnel.  The cost estimate is 

based on a 2 x 12 hour shift basis, with expatriate personnel working a 3 month on/3 week off roster.  

Messing, flight costs and other on-cost allowances including on-cost items such as superannuation, workers 

compensation etc, are included in this estimate. 

6.4.4 Dewatering 

Current hydrology testwork has indicated that water table is quite deep (>100 m) and that dry conditions are 

expected until this depth is reached.  However, $50,000 per year has been allowed for in-pit pumping to cater 

for: 

• Dust suppression,  

• Inclement weather and  

• Any perched water tables if encountered.   

Once a depth of 100m is reached the dewatering cost is increased by $2,000 per vertical metre of 

advancement to allow for increased pumping requirements.

Hydrological studies will be undertaken to determine dewatering requirements. The results from these studies 

are expected to show that this approach is conservative and that the cost to dewater can be reduced.   

6.4.5 Clearing, road construction and rehabilitation costs 

Costs associated with clearing etc, are based on: 

• Equipment hourly costs, 

• Number of hours required on a hectare basis for each of piece of equipment, and 

• An estimate of topsoil depth. 

A clearing cost per hectare was developed and then applied to the top of mining.  This was calculated to be 

the equivalent at $0.51/t. 

6.4.6 Drill and blast 

Drill and blast costs are based on a typical pattern size for the expected rock weathering condition and 
associated rock strengths.  African Explosives Limited supplied information on explosive costs, accessories 
and services which included personnel, equipment and infrastructure. It has been assumed that the material 
from 5.0 m to 35.0 m below the surface will be free-dig as shown in  

Figure 73. The remaining material will be blasted and the following pattern sizes have been applied: 

• Highly weathered -  6.0 x 6.0 m 

• Slightly weathered -  4.4 x 5.1 m 

• Fresh -    4.9 x 4.5 m 

• Ore -    4.4 x 5.1 m

Drilling bench heights are 7.5 m with 1.0 m of subdrill which will allow single pass drilling with a Tamrock 

D25KS drill rig.  ANFO will be used for both highly weathered, slightly weathered material and ore, and an 

emulsion product for fresh material.  Assumed penetration rates vary from 10 to 15m per hour. 

Overall drill and blast costs and powder factors by weathering are as follows: 

• Highly weathered -   $0.79/bcm (PF = 0.35) 

• Slightly weathered -   $1.22/bcm (PF = 0.55) 

• Fresh -    $2.10/bcm (PF = 0.80) 

• Ore -    $1.41/bcm (PF = 0.55) 

6.4.7 Grade Control 

Given that not all ore will be drill and blast and to ensure bench turnover can be maintained at an acceptable 

rate, grade control will be undertaken by angled RC drilling.  Pattern sizes are 6.0 metres across strike, and 

12.0 metres along strike drilling 20m deep angled holes.  50% of all material will be sampled in this manner, 

with all sample preparation and assaying being undertaken by on-site laboratories. Total grade control costs 

inclusive of drilling costs vary by material type but are estimated to be $0.14/bcm. 

6.4.8 ROM Ore Rehandle 

The mining cost estimate is based primarily on a combination of direct tipping and ROM rehandle.  As ore will 

only be mined during the day, an allowance of 80% rehandle has been made for crusher feed costs.  The cost 

estimate is based on typical cycle time and productivity estimates of a Komatsu WA800 front end loader 

supported by the ancillary fleet.  The total cost equates to $0.15/t. A second hand, smaller front end loader 

has also been purchased for backup. 

6.4.9 Load & haul costs 

A proprietary software package called TALPAC has been used to estimate truck cycle times, equipment 

productivities and load & haul costs.   

Using the current pit and dump designs, haul profiles were digitised in MineSight®, and exported to an ASCII 

format for each 20.0 m bench.  These were uploaded to TALPAC which converts the 3D string to a haul 

profile of distance and grade. A rolling resistance of 3.0% on haul roads and 5.0% on pit floors / waste dumps 

was applied.  An equipment set consisting of a Komatsu PC2000-8 excavator/HD 785-7 haul truck was 

attached to each profile. The fleet optimisation tool was used to evaluate each haul and determine the most 

appropriate truck fleet to minimise costs and maximise productivity. Cycle times were calculated for each 20.0 

metre bench and were entered into the cost model spreadsheet to calculate a final mining cost for each bench 

of each pit. Ancillary fleet hours are generally calculated on the basis of a proportion of the loader hours (e.g. 

1 grader for every 6 trucks). Load and haul costs range from $0.48/t to $2.42/t for waste material and $2.70/t 

to $4.97/t for ore.  Note, these costs do not include allowances for cost for financing, ownership costs or 

insurances.  These costs are included elsewhere in the capital cost estimates.

6.4.10 Gold Price, process recoveries, and other factors 

A base case price of USD$550/oz has been used and discount rate of 8% has been applied. Royalties net of 

price of 5.5% were applied. Sensitivity analysis has examined prices up to $625/oz.  Dilution has been set at 

5%, which is reasonable given the nature of the orebody (i.e. sub-vertical, reasonably wide in most areas, but 

with a number of shears). Mining losses are 1.5% which reflects the wide ore zones (i.e. no thin ore zones 

which would be lost due to blasting and/or equipment sizing).  This low factor assumes that best mining 

practices will be adopted to ensure ore losses are minimised, and that mining of ore will require geological 

control and will be conducted during daylight hours only.   

Process recoveries as summarised in Table 89 are based on metallurgical testwork conducted on a number of 

composite samples from different sections of the orebody which vary by area and by weathering profile and 

include areas where graphitic shales are encountered.

6.5 Pit Optimisation Results 

A number of optimisation runs as outlined in Table 90 were examined to determine the sensitivity of the 

resource to various parameters.  Changes to key parameters included: 

• Gold price, 

• Mining costs, 

• Processing throughput and costs, 

• Process recovery and  

• Overall slopes.

Generally speaking the project resource is relatively robust to changes in key optimisation parameters.  

However the following points should be noted: 

• The project is not overly sensitive to mining or processing costs. The variation with regard to 

in-pit tonnage and ounce production is less than 10%, with a variation in up to 15% for 

cashflow. 

• The project is sensitive to changes in the gold price, with in-pit tonnage and ounce production 

varying to a similar degree to the change in gold price.  However, the open pit value changes 

by over 50% with a 14% change in gold price. 

Shell 47 was used for design purposes and the rationalization for this is to: 

• Maximize net cashflow whilst also maximising resource utilization.  The standard Whittle 

concepts of "best" and "worst" schedules or discounted cashflows are averaged to give an 

approximation of a realistically achievable schedule.  As shown in Figure 74, Shell 47 will 

maximize the resource as well as being within 10% of the maximum discounted cashflow.

As shown in Figure 75, the value curve is much more defined compared to Inata, and hence, the decision to 

mine a slightly larger shell has a larger impact on value.  Therefore Shell 31, which is within 95% of the 

maximum discounted cashflow, has been used for design purposes.

6.6 Mine Design 

6.6.1 Geotechnical 

Mine design parameters are based on those proposed by George, Orr and Associates.  They are based on 

the geotechnical work completed to date and are summarised in Table 93.

Fresh Rock (below 195 mRI) 5m 65° 20m 
23m wide @10%

1m @ 10% single 

 

In addition to these design parameters, the following approach is also used: 

• All ramps to be located in the hangingwall (i.e. western wall), 

• Staged designs will be developed with the objective of obtaining additional geotechnical 

information as the mine progresses. 

• Steeper batter slopes may be achievable with the additional information which will 

be obtained in future geotechnical assessments. Subsequent redesigns can 

incorporate these updates. 

• Minimum mining widths have been set at 30 metres for pushbacks and 10 metres in 

depth for goodbye cuts. 

6.6.2 Designs 

The designs are split into 5 different areas detailed below: 

• Inata North 

• Inata Central 

• Inata South / Inata Far South 

• Sayouba and 

• Minfo. 

Final designs were completed on all of the Inata resources, including staged designs on both the North and 

Central areas. Ultimate designs were completed for Sayouba, Minfo and Far South.   

6.6.3 Inata Design 

As outlined in the previous section, Shell 47 was used for Inata designs.

6.6.3.1 Inata North – Stage 1 

To facilitate a design for the Stage 1 Inata North, Shell 10 was used to focus on high grade low cost ore as 

shown in Figure 77.  This pit is approximately 100 m deep, and has a two-way access ramp to the 265 mRl, 

and a one-way access ramp to the 240 mRl.  Goodbye cuts at the base of the pit allow for another 10 m of 

mining.

6.6.3.2 Inata North – Ultimate 

The design illustrated in Figure 78 is developed below the fresh contact to a final depth of 165 mRL, with 

"goodbye cuts" mining to the 155 mRL.  The open pit is split into two areas, with one ramp system accessing 

both pits.  A central switchback at the 275 mRL will allow for ore to be mined from both the northern and 

southern sections. The ramp exits to the south west in an appropriate position for the ROM stockpile and 

waste dump. 

A separate one-way access ramp to the northernmost section mean that this area can be mined 

independently of the rest of the pit for short periods to a depth of approximately 50 metres below surface.

6.6.3.3 Inata Central – Stage 1 

This design illustrated in Figure 79 is developed to a final depth of 90 metres, mining to the 240 mRl.  The 

open pit is designed to access ore early, and therefore allow for ore continuity to facilitate the subsequent 

waste strip within the remaining section of the Central Ultimate pit. Waste is hauled to the waste dump to the 

west of the open pit.

6.6.3.4 Inata Central – Ultimate 

This design illustrated in Figure 80 is developed to a final depth of 135 metres mining to the 195 mRl.  The 

open pit mines to the top of fresh contact with a two-way access ramp being developed on the eastern wall to 

allow both the north and southern sections to be developed independently. Waste is hauled to a large waste 

dump to the west of the open pit.

6.6.3.5 Inata Central – South 

This design illustrated in Figure 81 is developed within the highly weathered material only to a final depth of 

245 mRl which is approximately 70 metres deep.  The two-way access ramp system is developed to the 280 

mRL with a one-way ramp access developed to the 245 mRL. 

The small open pit called the Far South is developed using a one-way access ramp to the 250 mRL. 

Waste will be hauled to a small waste dump to the west of both of the open pits.

6.6.3.6 Minfo and Sayouba 

The designs illustrated in Figure 82 and Figure 83 utilise the same design parameters as employed for the 

Inata pits.  The parameters are to be validated prior to mining (commences in Year 4). The Minfo pit design 

use a single pass ramp to access the ore to a depth of 90 m below the surface. Waste will be hauled to a 

small waste dump the west of the dump, with the ore being hauled over 5.0 km to the ROM pad.

6.7 Ore Reserves 

6.7.1 JORC and National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Compliance 

6.7.1.1 Dilution and Ore Loss 

The geostatistical modeling approach adopted for both the Inata and Minfo deposits uses a combination of 

Multi-Indicator Kriging (MIK) as the primary estimation technique with Ordinary Kriging (OK) used for 

comparison and validation of the MIK technique. Both these methodologies constrained the estimation of 

grade within a 3D solid shape that defined the mineralized zone. As the mineralized zone is generally wide 

and sub-vertical a relatively low dilution factor of 5% has been allowed.   

Ore losses, in this case, are defined as ore that would be "lost" due to poor mining practices (i.e. ore sent to a 

waste dump), or as isolated small blocks which when mined would be heavily diluted. In both the Inata and 

Minfo models, minimum mining widths have been maintained, and the shear zone is wide and predictable, 

hence a relatively low ore loss factor of 1.5% can be used. 

6.7.1.2 Cut-off Grade Calculation 

Cut-off grades are based on processing costs divided by the net recovered gold price and are summarised in 

Table 94. Low grade ore has been defined as ore between a lower cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t and the breakeven 

cut-off grade of 0.8 g/t. As the costs are slightly higher for graphitic shale, the ore cutoff grade is increased to 

0.9 g/t.  The low grade cut-off has been based on reducing the fixed costs by 35% and using a higher gold 

price of $625/oz.  If $550/oz is used this cut-off grade increases to ~0.60g/t.

6.7.2 Other Criteria 

The resources will be developed by open pit mining methods as employed in many other operations 

throughout the world.  All wall design parameters have been accounted for and are based on a combination of 

sound engineering testwork, knowledge and experience.  Grade control methods will utilise RC drilling and 

sampling which is used throughout many operations in West Africa and the rest of world.  Metallurgical 

process recoveries are based on testwork performed on representative samples obtained during the 2005 and 

2006 drilling programs.  The testwork was performed by the AMMTEC laboratory in Perth and was supervised 

by a qualified metallurgist.  

A conservative gold price of $550/oz has been used and all known royalties have been included to develop a 

net price as outlined in Table 94. 

The Inata, Sayouba and Minfo deposits are all contained within the same Exploitation Permit (mining lease) 

area.  The exploitation permit submission was registered with the Burkina Faso government in December 

2005 and final approval was given in September 2006. 

6.7.3 Ore Reserve 

The ore reserves have been classified as per the Australian ore reserve guidelines outlined in the Australian 

Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2004. These are consistent 

with NI 43-101. That is, the reserves are diluted and recovered ore from within a practical pit design that will 

be delivered to the process plant. The total Mineable Reserve Estimate for Inata and Minfo is 15.4 Mt at 1.9

6.7.4 Comparison to Optimal Shells 

Table 96 summarises the comparison of each of the designs to the optimal shell on which they were based 

and Figure 84 shows a comparison of the design to the shell in section.  In general there are minor differences 

in ore tonnage and grade.  There is a 2% increase in waste tonnage which is well within design tolerances.  

The ore tonnages quoted in the table are Proven and Probable ore using a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t for 

comparative purposes. Given the size and shape of the optimal shells, these variations are considered within 

acceptable limits.

6.8 Operations 

6.8.1 Mining Method 

Open pit mining will be undertaken by Goldbelt and managed by an experienced operating team including 

expatriate staff.  A minimum bench height in ore of 2.5m will be utilized where required to minimize dilution 

and ore losses.  This may be increased to 3.5 metres to ensure the productivities of the larger excavators are 

maximised, especially in waste material. Mining operations will consist of the following functions:

• Site Preparation – The open pit, waste dump and laydown areas will be cleared and grubbed 

of all vegetation, with all topsoil stockpiled in strategic locations (i.e. close to the waste dump 

toe) in anticipation of progressive rehabilitation requirements. 

• Road building – All external roads will be built to an appropriate standard for heavy earth 

moving equipment usage.  Appropriate surface water management measures will be put in 

place to ensure all weather access.   

• Dewatering – It is anticipated that the open pits will be dry for the majority of the time.  Water 

will be pumped to a bunded pond at the crest of the pit, which will be equipped with a pump, 

power pack and standpipe for the provision of water for dust suppression purposes.  In the 

early stage of mining, water will be supplied from the process raw water supply for dust 

suppression. 

Drill and Blast – At present this study has assumed that all material from 5 metres to 35 metres below surface 

will be "free dig" (i.e. not require blasting). All material below 35 metres will be drilled and blasted (see  

• Figure 73). Modern blasting practices will be used to limit mining dilution and ore loss. 

• Grade control – This study has assumed that dedicated RC drilling and sampling will be used 

for grade control.  Data will be processed, and blocks will be marked out as per the grade 

control guidelines which will be developed prior to mining. Ore will require in-pit geological 

monitoring due the complexity of the orebody and only waste will be mined during night shift 

periods.  Ore mining will progress from the hangingwall across the orebody to the footwall (i.e. 

west to east) Waste will be stripped off and the orebody will be exposed with control being 

given by the grade control geologist.  

• Load and haul – All material will be mined using 200 tonne hydraulic excavators loading 91 

tonne off-highway trucks.  Trucks will be loaded from the rear or from the sides, with the 

excavator loading from the bench above the truck to maximize productivities.  There may be 

the requirement to "top load" ore blocks, which will require the excavator on the same level as 

the truck.  However this requirement will be minimized.  The smaller ancillary excavator will 

also be used to trim batters after a visual inspection to ensure safe operations.  Basic haulage 

standards will be implemented (e.g. operators to remain within the truck during loading 

operations, maintaining a safe distance from loading operations, not parking in blind spots, 

lower trays before moving off, obeying necessary road rules at all times etc.).  Any areas 

where there is vertical drop of half a truck wheel height will require a safety windrow to be 

built. 

All material will be hauled from the open pit either directly to the crusher, to an ore stockpile or to a waste 

dump.

6.8.2 Mining Schedule 

The schedules were developed using MineSight®'s strategic scheduling program which accounts for ore 

losses, dilution, different material types and variable period lengths.  The over-riding objective was to 

maximise metal on a period-by-period basis. 

The schedule is based on months for the pre-strip period (2 months) and also for the first year of production. 

The schedule was then extended to quarters for years 2 and 3 and annual after this.  Efforts were made to 

schedule only highly weathered ore for as long as practically possible and to defer mining the deeper 

transitional and fresh ore.  Generally speaking, this harder material will be mined towards the end of the mine 

life and will be blended with the weathered ore to assist with process throughput and recovery issues.   

As staged pit designs were developed, the resulting incremental reserves allow higher grade ore to be 

targeted during the early part of the mine life, with medium and low grade ore stockpiled and processed at the 

end of the mine life. 

A number of schedules were examined and based upon the following criteria: 

• Two, 200 tonne excavators, each capable of  – 450 kbcm per month, or approximately 10.0 – 

10.5 Mtpa, 

• 2.25 mtpa ore tonnes processed per year, and 

• Minimise material movement in the first 20 months, and any pre-stripping required to minimise 

working capital requirements. 

To allow for training and start-up requirements, the excavator has been de-rated to 70% for the first 2 months, 

85% for the following two months and 95% for the remainder of the first year.  After this, each machine is 

expected to work at their maximum capacity of 10.0 to 10.5 Mt for the next four years.  

The final schedule is based on developing the open pits in the following sequence with an initial focus on 

supplying high grade, highly weathered ore early in the schedule. 

• Inata North Stage 1,  

• Inata North – Ultimate, 

• Inata Central, 

• Inata South and Far South, and 

• Sayouba and Minfo. 

The annualised schedule is highlighted in Table 97, whilst detailed schedule output is attached in the 

Appendices. This table indicated that 142 kt of ore is initially stockpiled in the first 2 months, and then 

reclaimed within the following six months.

Inferred ore has not been included and has been treated as waste material. During the course of the 

schedule, 1.081 Mt of low grade ore is stockpiled and is rehandled in Year 7 at the end of the mine life.  

Bench turnover rates are within an acceptable range (i.e. 1 – 2 x 5.0 m benches per month). 

6.8.3 Waste Dump and Stockpiles 

The current strategy is to develop waste dumps to the west of the open pits on the hangingwall side of the 

deposits.  Siting of the waste dump locations is based on consideration of the prevailing wind direction during 

Harmattan. Given the steep dip of the orebody, this position of the waste dumps is unlikely to sterilise any 

potential extensions of the orebody at depth. This assumption will be confirmed by condemnation drilling prior 

to mining. Two main dumps are required, one to service Inata North and a separate dump for Inata South and 

Central. A small dump is required for Minfo while Sayouba will use the Inata North Dump.  Figure 85 outlines 

the positions of the waste dumps and their relative size.  The South/Central waste dump is 40 m high and the 

North Dump 40 m high; with 10 m wide berms placed every 10 m vertical.  Batter slopes are 30º to give an 

overall slope of 25º.

Waste dump capacity is 70 Mbcm, which provides enough capacity after allowing for a 15% swell factor for 

the highly weathered waste, and a 20% swell for the slightly weathered / fresh waste.  The amount of fresh 

waste is negligible. 

As part of closure planning, a 2.0 m high bund will be placed around all open pits and the open pits will be 

allowed to fill with water based on the natural ground water levels.  All of the waste dumps will be battered

down to an overall slope of 20°.  The top of the waste dumps will be battered at a slope of 1:100 to allow for 

water to drain away.  Topsoil will be replaced and seeded. 

6.8.4 Equipment Requirements 

To minimise up-front mining capital costs, the procurement of the mining fleet will be split, with the first fleet 

being purchased at commencement of operations.  The second fleet will be required for production by month 

10 (month 8 of the first production year after accounting for 2 months of pre-strip) of the schedule and will be 

purchased on the basis of this date for delivery and commissioning. The equipment outlined in Table 98 will 

be required to commence mining operations as well as well as to sustain development throughout the life.  An 

additional smaller excavator will be purchased as part of the first fleet to provide backup in case of the main 

production machine failing, and will also be used for batter pulling and trimming. 

A single front end loader at the ROM pad is required to ensure continuity of ore feed.  An additional second 

hand unit will also be purchased with the second fleet purchase as a back-up machine.  This second machine 

can also assist with road maintenance on an as-needs basis. 

An explosives magazine supplied as part of the explosives contract will be located in a suitable position away 

from operations, and will be securely fenced and bunded. Bulk product will be separated from accessories in a 

separate magazine.

6.9 Mining Costs 

6.9.1 Mining Capital Costs 

The total mining capital cost will be $26.4 M as outlined in Table 99 and Table 100.     

Access to the orebody in the Inata North Stage 1 pit is at surface, hence pre-stripping requirements are 

minimal.  All stripping, grubbing, clearing and topsoil stockpiling is accounted for in the operating cost.  The 

mining capital cost includes delivery of equipment, setup costs, workshop construction and equipment and 

first fill quantities for fuel, lubricants, tyres, GET parts, and other spares.  An allowance has also been made 

for inclusion of mining software and the survey system. Contingency or financing costs have not been 

included in this estimate as this will be included in other sections.

• ROM Ore rehandle and 

• Load and haul costs by area / depth. 

The incremental ore cost (i.e. the difference between the waste mining cost and the ore mining cost) is added 

to the process costs to create a total "ore" cost which is used during the optimisation process. 

These costs, together with the capital costs, have then been applied to the schedule and summarised in Table 

102. The capital costs have been amortised on a tonnage basis and the overall average mining costs for the 

life of the operation are $1.34/tonne mined excluding capital and $1.56/t including capital.

SECTION 7 -  MINERALS PROCESSING PLANT 

7.1 Introduction 

Goldbelt Resources has purchased a second hand plant from Brocks Creek in Australia to fast-track the 

implementation programme by acquiring long lead-time items.  Major components of this plant, such as the 

jaw crusher, SAG mill, one Ball Mill, the cyanide mixing and elution system will be refurbished and utilised in 

the new plant. A second refurbished Ball Mill has also been purchased from South Africa. 

Goldbelt Resources has already dismantled the Brocks Creek plant and has stored selected items in Darwin, 

NT. These items of equipment, and supporting structures where acceptable, will be refurbished by a specialist 

Material Subcontractor and then sent to the Inata site for installation. 

New equipment will be selected on the basis of the mass balance and in conjunction with equipment vendors 

and service providers. The CIL area will be all new construction with new tanks, agitators, interstage screens, 

carbon transfer pumps, classifying and dewatering screens. The control system will be of robust design with 

minimal automation. Alarming and diagnostic facilities will be included for monitoring and trouble shooting. 

The Inata Gold Project will be a conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant combined with a gravity recovery 

circuit to process 2.25 Mtpa of ore. Run of Mine (ROM) ore will pass through a coarse grizzly before entering 

the primary jaw crusher where it is crushed to -150mm. After crushing, the ore will be ground in the milling 

circuit comprising a primary SAG mill operating in closed circuit with a screen.  The SAG mill will discharge to 

a sump from where it will be pumped to the screen.  The screen oversize will be returned to the SAG mill while 

the undersize will report to a sump which will also accept the discharges from the two parallel secondary ball 

mills.  The slurry will be pumped to a cyclone cluster.  About 70% of cyclone underflow will be returned to the 

ball mills with the remainder being treated in centrifugal concentrator(s), the concentrator tails then gravitating 

to the ball mills.  The concentrator product will be upgraded on a Gemini table.  The table tailings will be 

returned to the milling circuit while the table concentrate will be smelted to produce dore bullion.  The mill 

cyclone overflow will form the feed to the CIL section.  Powdered lime will be added to the SAG mill feed to 

produce the alkaline slurry required for leaching with cyanide. 

The cyclone overflow will first be screened to remove foreign matter (trash), which might otherwise blind the 

interstage screens.  The trash screen undersize will be sent to the first of the CIL tanks where cyanide 

solution will be added to initiate dissolution of gold.  The slurry will flow down the tank train through the 

interstage screens, which will be sized to prevent carbon exiting the tank.  As the gold is dissolved as the 

slurry flows down the circuit, it will be adsorbed onto carbon.  Counter current to the slurry passage, the 

loaded carbon will be pumped up the train with the result that the carbon in the first tank will be the most 

heavily loaded and that in the last tank will be the least loaded.  A batch of carbon will be removed daily from 

the first tank by pumping the appropriate volume carbon bearing slurry from the first tank over the loaded 

carbon screen for stripping (elution).  The screen undersize (slurry) will gravitate back to the first while the 

oversize (loaded carbon) will pass to the acid wash/elution section.

The loaded carbon will first be given a wash in dilute hydrochloric acid to remove carbonate coatings.  Gold 

will then be recovered from the loaded carbon by an AARL elution system.  The pregnant solution from elution 

loaded carbon will be stored in a tank, from which it will be recycled through an electro-winning cell until the 

grade of the solution discharged from the cell is less than 10 ppm. 

The gold stripped from the cathodes will be calcined and smelted to form doré bullion.  

After elution the barren carbon will be treated in a regeneration kiln to restore its activity in terms of its 

capability to adsorb gold.  The regenerated carbon will be returned to the CIL section by way of the last tank in 

the train. 

The plant will be designed to be largely self sufficient and accommodate the particular operating conditions 

within the country of Burkina Faso and it will be designed to operate at 90% availability for 24 hours per day, 7 

days per week.  

New equipment will be designed to meet the mass flow balance for the 2.25 Mtpa plant whilst incorporating 

elements of the Brocks Creek plant. 

A conventional tailings facility will be provided capable of holding a minimum volume of 15.7 Mt of tailings 

waste material generated from ore processing over the proposed seven year mine life. 

 

7.2 Crushing 

ROM ore will be directly dumped or recovered from the ROM pad and loaded into the ROM bin which is fitted 

with an 800 mm fixed grizzly sloping at 20º. Oversize ore is periodically removed from the grizzly and stored 

on a separate stockpile for breaking by mobile breaker. The ROM bin will have a live capacity of 200 tonnes 

and ore will be extracted from the bin by a heavy duty apron feeder. The apron feeder will discharge ore to the 

crusher feed fixed grizzly which will be fitted with a 150mm aperture. Oversize ore will be directed to the Ken 

Kue 48" x 42" jaw crusher, where it will be crushed to -150 mm. Undersize ore will bypass the crusher and will 

be deposited directly on the sacrificial conveyor. The sacrificial conveyor will accept the product from the jaw 

crusher as well as the fixed grizzly undersize. The sacrificial conveyor will be designed to be as short as 

possible to minimise replacement cost of the belt which may be damaged by ore and tramp metal falling onto 

the belt. The sacrificial conveyor will be fitted with a tramp iron magnet and metal detector to remove tramp 

iron from the ore prior to being fed to the SAG Mill feed conveyor.  

The plant will not have a fine ore stockpile as the ore has exhibited particularly "sticky" clay characteristics; 

instead a fine ore (-150mm) stockpile will be established on the ROM pad for use as plant feed when the 

crusher is under maintenance. At this time, the 800 mm fixed grizzly on the ROM bin will be replaced with a 

150 mm fixed grizzly and the ore will bypass the crusher and be fed directly to the SAG mill.

7.3 Conveying 

The SAG Mill Feed Belt Conveyor will be fitted with a belt scale. A signal from the belt scale will be sent to the 

apron feeder control system to control the feed rate to the SAG mill. Lime will be added to the ore on this 

conveyor for pH control in the CIL process via a 100 tonne lime silo fitted with a rotary valve.  A signal from 

the belt scale on the conveyor to the rotary valve will control the lime dosage rate. 

The lime will be delivered in 1 tonne bulk bags, which will be broken into a bin and pneumatically conveyed to 

the top of the silo. 

 

7.4 Grinding 

After crushing, the ore and water will be fed into the 20' diameter x 11' long SAG Mill, driven by a 1500 kW 

variable speed DC motor and gearbox. The SAG mill will discharge into the SAG Mill sump where additional 

water may be added to the sump if required. The SAG mill sump will be constructed of mild steel and rubber 

lined.  The SAG mill discharge pumps (one duty, one standby) will pump slurry to the SAG mill screen where -

0.7 mm material passing the screen will be directed to the ball mill feed sump. Oversize shall gravitate back to 

the SAG mill. 

The ball mill sump will be serviced by two slurry pumps (one duty, one standby). The ball mill discharge 

pumps will feed the cyclone cluster, the overflow of which will report to the trash screen and hence to CIL tank 

1 (or CIL tank 2) if 1 is unavailable).  About 30% of the cyclone underflow will be directed to the contractor 

feed scalping screen.  The scalping underflow screen, complete with oversize chute and underpan, will 

discharge the oversize back to the Ball Mill and the sized product will report to a splitter box. The remainder of 

the cyclone underflow will be recycled to the ball mills.  

Ball Mill 1 is a 16' diameter x 13' long Allis Chalmers Ball Mill complete with a 1000 kW slipring motor and 

gearbox. Ball Mill 2 is a refurbished 12' diameter by 18' long Vecor unit, complete with 1200kW slipring motor 

and gearbox.  A trommel will be fitted to each mill to screen out the ball scats from the mill discharge and feed 

them into the Ball Mill scat box. The mills will discharge into the Ball Mill sump. 

The concentrator splitter box will divide the feed between the two centrifugal concentrators, which will be 

supplied complete with computer control and automated piping.  The concentrator product will be upgraded on 

a Gemini 1000 table, which will be housed in the Gold Room.  The table concentrate will be smelted after 

calcination. 

The centrifugal concentrator tails and the table tails will be returned to the ball mill.  

The mill area will be serviced by a tower crane which is used for maintenance and ball charging, which will be 

done by way of the ball mill feed chute using the charger hopper.

7.5 Leaching and Adsorption 

A conventional carbon in leach circuit, comprising six adsorption tanks with associated screens, pumps and 

steel work, will be employed to adsorb gold from solution. 

Cyclone overflow from the classification tower will report to a single deck trash screen. This screen will 

remove any unwanted wood fragments and other fibrous matter that could blind the interstage screens in the 

CIL tanks. The underflow from the screen will be sampled by use of a cross-cut sampler before being directed 

into CIL tank 1 (or tank 2 if tank 1 is out of service). 

The six CIL tanks will provide a total residence time of 24 hours. An oxygen and air sparge system will be 

incorporated into the tanks from the Brocks Creek plant. The ore slurry will flow through the interstage screens 

from tank 1 to tank 2 and through to tank 6. Carbon will be pumped countercurrent from tank 6 to 5 and on to 

tank 1. 

As the slurry passes though the tanks, gold will be dissolved by the cyanide solution and then adsorbed onto 

carbon.  Due to this counter current system, the carbon in the first tank will be the most heavily loaded and 

that in the last tank will be the least loaded. 

A system of dart valves and launders will allow single tanks to be bypassed and taken off line for maintenance 

and servicing. The tanks will be furnished with suitable walkways, stairways and access platforms to ensure 

safe access to each piece of equipment. 

Loaded Carbon from CIL tank 1 will be pumped to the Loaded Carbon Screen located above the acid 

wash/elution column. The loaded carbon screen will receive the loaded carbon pumped from tank 1.  This 

screen will be equipped with water sprays to remove slurry from the carbon.  The cleaned loaded carbon 

screen oversize will be sent to the acid wash/elution column, while the slurry will gravitate back to tank 1. 

The CIL area will be enclosed in a bund with sumps and pumps to reclaim spillage. Normally the spillage will 

be pumped to the first or second CIL tank but if pumping to these tanks adversely affects the slurry density 

because of the amount of water in the bund, then the spillage may be pumped to the carbon safety screen. 

A tower crane will cover the CIL section for maintenance purposes. The crane will be used primarily for 

periodic removal of the interstage screens for cleaning and maintenance. A high pressure pump for cleaning 

the surfaces of the interstage screens will be provided. 

 

7.6 Elution and Acid Wash 

The Acid wash/elution column will receive the 2.5 tonne batch of loaded carbon from the loaded carbon 

screen. The acid wash will be carried out with a dilute acid prepared on site. Spillage will be sent to the sump. 

All necessary safety equipment will be included.  

The acid washed carbon will be soaked in a strong solution of cyanide and caustic for 20 minutes before 

being eluted by the AARL system. In this system, high quality water is pumped through the recovery heat 

exchanger where it will gain heat from the hot solution exiting the elution column. The partially heated solution

leaving the recovery heat exchanger will pass to a second exchanger where it gains heat from the hot oil 

heater to bring it up to the operating temperature of 110°. The hot solution is pumped into the base of the 

column. After passage up the column, the solution is discharged from the top of the column. On exiting the 

column, it will give up heat to the incoming solution in the recovery heat exchanger and pass to the pregnant 

electrolyte tank. This process will continue until the grade of the carbon is 50-100 ppm gold. 

Unlike the Zadra system, the elution and electro-winning operate independently.  The pregnant solution from 

the storage tank will be recycled through the electro-winning cells for approximately 16 hours until the assay 

of the solution is less than 10 ppm gold. The barren solution from the cell will pass to the barren eluate tank 

from where it is recycled to the elution tank. 

The cyanide and caustic solutions required by the elution process will be made up on site and pumped into 

the mixing tank, which will be equipped with an agitator. 

The mixed solution will be pumped into the elution column via the recovery heat exchanger and heater. 

The spent carbon will be transported to the carbon regeneration area by high pressure water from the 

Elution/Transport water tank. Periodically the water from the tank will be cleaned of carbon fines by passing 

the water through a pressure filter. 

 

7.7 Carbon Regeneration 

The spent carbon will be pumped from the elution area onto the dewatering screen above the carbon 

regeneration kiln feed hopper. The water is routed back to the transport water tank. A carbon regeneration kiln 

will be employed to regenerate the carbon for reuse in the CIL tanks. The carbon will be withdrawn from the 

carbon kiln feed hopper by the kiln screw feeder where further dewatering takes place. The water will be 

routed back to the elution transport water tank. The carbon is heated to a suitable temperature and allowed to 

"soak" before being discharged into the quench tank. 

Fresh carbon will be added to the system via the carbon attrition tank. Fresh activated carbon will be manually 

loaded into the tank containing fresh water. The tank will be equipped with an agitator to condition the carbon 

by abrasion to remove particles of a size such that, had they been produced in the CIL tanks, they would pass 

through the interstage screens and be lost to tailings carrying adsorbed gold with them. As required the 

carbon attrition tank will be discharged into the quench tank.  

The quench tank is a rubber lined mild steel tank which collects the regenerated carbon from the kiln and the 

fresh carbon as required. 

 

7.8 Electrowinning and Smelting 

Two electro-winning cells, complete with rectifiers and fume handling system, will accept the pregnant solution 

from the electrolyte tank and extract gold from the solution onto the cathodes by electrolysis. Periodically, 

loaded gold cathodes will be taken from the cell to recover the gold sludge.  The cathodes will be cleaned in

the cathode wash table from where the sludge washed from the cathodes will be recovered in the precious 

metal filter press. 

Barren solution from the filter press will be sent to the Goldroom sump and pumped back to the eluate tank. 

Concentrate gold from the centrifugal concentrators will be recovered on the Gemini table in the Goldroom. 

This table is an existing piece of equipment from Brocks Creek that has been refurbished. The tails from the 

Gemini table will be sent back to the ball mill. 

Intensive cyanidation was also investigated to recover gravity gold, however, as the Gemini table is existing it 

was decided that its use be trialled. If recoveries from the Gemini table are found to be low, the installation of 

an intensive cyanidation plant (such as a Gekkoo or Acacia unit) could be investigated. 

The filter cake from the filter press and the gold from the Gemini table will be manually loaded into the 

calcining oven. The calcining oven dries the filter cake prior to smelting. A smelting furnace will accept the 

cake from the calcine oven along with suitable fluxes, added manually, to smelt the gold into the bullion 

moulds. After cooling, the bullion bars will be cleaned and placed in the safe ready to transport for further 

refining. 

 

7.9 Goldroom Building 

The Goldroom building will be a steel framed and concrete block structure located within the plant area and 

founded on a concrete slab and footings. Equipment within the building includes: 

• The electrowinning equipment; 

• Calcining furnace and smelting kiln; 

• Gemini table; 

• Bullion preparation area and safe; 

• Clean in/dirty out facilities. 

 

7.10 Tailings Discharge 

A conventional tailings discharge system will be utilised for the Inata Gold project. After passing through the 

safety screen to recover any fine carbon, the tailings will be pumped to the tailings dam located just north of 

the ROM pad. Tailings deposition will be by multi-spigot distribution system. 

The carbon safety screen will be a single deck vibrating screen fitted with a rubber-lined underpan and water 

sprays. The screen will accept the leached slurry discharged from tank No 6 (or tank 5 if tank 6 is not in 

operation) and discharge the oversize into a bulk bag. The undersize will gravitate down to the tailings sump 

where it will be pumped by a slurry pump to the tailings dam via a HDPE pipeline.

The tailings dam will consist of an embankment prepared from mine waste rock. Initially it will be 7m high and 

built up as required to a height of 40m. 

Process water will be reclaimed from the tailings dam by a floating submersible pump. The process water will 

be pumped back to the process water tank at the plant site. 

Further details of the Tailings Mangement Facility can be found later in this section.  

 

7.11 Reagent Mixing 

Cyanide will be delivered in the form of briquettes in bags. The briquettes will be mixed with water in the 

cyanide make up tank. The cyanide solution will be pumped to the CIL tanks and the elution plant as required. 

Caustic soda pearls will be supplied in bags. They will be added by hand into the caustic make up tank where 

they will be mixed and agitated in water to make the desired solution. The caustic solution will be pumped to 

the elution area where it will be added to the cyanide solution to make up the required eluant.   

Caustic may also used to raise the pH of the slurry in the CIL tanks if the lime addition system fails. 

The acid wash solution will be prepared by diluting concentrated hydrochloric acid solution in the hydrochloric 

acid tank. 

Concentrated hydrochloric acid will be added to the acid tank via a drum pump. 

The dilute acid will be pumped through the acid wash/elution column to acid rinse the carbon prior to the 

elution process. 

 

7.12 Water 

Water for process plant use will be drawn from the Gomde Barrage, supplemented by water reclaimed from 

the tailings dam. Water reclaimed from the tailings dam will be used as process water supplying the SAG and 

ball mills and various screens around the plant. Raw water will be used for make up if the quantity of process 

water reclaimed from the tailings dam, is insufficient during the dry season. Raw water will be stored near the 

plant in a reservoir with a capacity of 15,000 m3, enough for 24 hours of plant operation. 

Potable water will be produced by treating the raw water from the Gomde Barrage in the water treatment 

plant. Potable water will be distributed throughout the plant for drinking, washing and for safety showers. 

 

7.13 Air 

Plant air will be provided by the existing Brocks Creek air compressors and distributed around the plant. 

Instrument air will be supplied by the existing Brocks Creek air compressors via an air dryer.

7.14 Oxygen 

Oxygen will be produced by the self contained oxygen generators. Air will be supplied by the plant air 

compressors and the oxygen will be used in the CIL tanks. 

 

7.15 Generator Sets 

There are four main HFO 11kV generators of 2500kVA prime output at 0.8 power factor, feeding the 11kV, 50 

Hz busbars. 

The generator sets are fitted with Pielstick 6PC2.5L400 engines and 500rpm alternators. In addition there will 

be two 1500rpm diesel generators that can be synchronised on the busbars to allow for peak loads and 

shutdowns of the main generators. 

The engines will be capable of providing 10% overload for one hour in a twelve hour period and will be 

provided with industrial type silencers and radiators for cooling. 

High water temperature and low oil pressure protection will be provided. 

A generator building will be provided to house the six generators. 

 

7.16 Automatic Load Sharing, Load Demand and Synchronising Panels  

This unit controls the auto synchronising of the sets on the main busbars and provides automatic load sharing 

as required. Sets are started to meet the load requirements and will then be shutdown if a point is reached 

when the load decreases.   

The multi cubicle enclosure is arranged for front access to the controls and instruments. All necessary 

protection relays will be included for reverse power, under voltage and overvoltage conditions. 

 

7.17 Distribution Transformers  

The distribution transformers are used on the electrical supply as follows: 

MV Supply:  11kV, 3 phase 50Hz 

LV Supply:  415V, 3 phase and neutral, 50Hz  

   630V, no load, for the SAG Mill Motor Convertor  

Control:   240V 50Hz  

The transformers will be of the oil immersed naturally air cooled type (ONAN) and are housed in weatherproof 

heavy duty steel tanks with tank-mounted cooling radiators either bolted or welded in position. The

transformer tanks will be of the free breathing type fitted with a conservator and silica gel breather or 

hermetically sealed. 

The core will be constructed from laminations of low loss electrical sheet steel. The laminations will be 

insulated in such a way as to be unaffected by continuous operation under normal service conditions of the 

transformer. The core design will provide a uniform flux distribution throughout the magnetic circuit. 

The MV windings will have conductors and joints brazed and insulated to withstand the service conditions of 

the transformer. LV windings will comprise a number of conductors in parallel as required. End insulation and 

supporting frames will be braced to prevent deformation when subjected to short circuit forces.  

The following features are included: 

• Delta/Star winding (Delta/Delta for one of the Sag  Mill Transformers),

7.19 Tailings Management Facility (TMF) 

7.19.1 Introduction 

During the pre-feasibility study for the Inata Gold Project, AMEC was requested to undertake a review of 

alternative tailings disposal methods.  The result of such analysis was heavily influenced by the necessity to 

minimise water make up requirements and the selected method was the disposal of tailings as a dry filter cake 

with a moisture content of 10%. 

Following AMEC analysis of the water availability to the plant, the storage characteristics of the proposed 

Gomde Barrage, the hydrological characteristics of the site and a review of the rainfall patterns in the project 

area, GBM confirmed that net process water savings by use of filter cake disposal were not significant and 

that sub aerial deposition of slurry tailings will be the method used for the purposes of this feasibility study. 

The concept of hydraulically placed, sub aerial, thin layer deposition of tailings is a proven concept which, 

combined with modern dewatering techniques, can achieve higher densities and lower closure costs.  The 

capital costs requirements associated with this type of deposition are orders of magnitude lower than for dry 

cake or thickened tailings deposition although more rigorous water management will be required at the facility 

especially during the rainy season. 

The siting study for the TMF was completed as part of the pre feasibility study and although the proposed 

location for the facility was determined for the option of dry cake disposal, it is considered that the site 

selected remains appropriate at this stage.  The scope for an optimised site that allows some construction 

cost savings remains open and this should be investigated during the detailed design phase. 

The proposed TMF has been designed to contain up to 15.75 Mt of tailings arising at a rate of approximately 

2.25 Mt per annum over a predicted life of mine of 7 years.  The main characteristics of the proposed facility 

are as follows:

• Final Dam Elevation 371 m 

• Area at the base of the containment pad 250 000 m2 

• Year 1 embankment Volume 368 000 m3 

• Final embankment volume estimated at 10.7 Mm3 

• Final Dam Storage Capacity (tailings only) 10.67 Mm3 (16.0 Mt) 

The selected site for the location of the tailings facility is located immediately north of the plant site and east of 

the Inata North Open Pit.  The site has been the subject of a preliminary geotechnical investigation, including 

sample collection of the identified materials and laboratory analysis for geotechnical modelling. 

Construction materials for the pre-deposition embankment will be sourced from the Inata North open pit pre 

stripping.  Confirmation of the appropriateness of the materials will be obtained once the results of the 

geochemical characterisation programme on these waste materials is completed. 

The selected site for the construction of the barrage for water supply was determined to be some 16 km north 

east of the plant site location near the village of Gomde.  Construction materials for the barrage will be 

sourced from the excavation of the spillway channel or from a borrow area located inside the inundation 

footprint for options 1 and 2 respectively. 

In addition to the above, and airstrip has been planned and two options for the site access road have been 

analysed and are presented in this report. 

A detailed description of the site characteristics has been included as an Appendix of this report. 

7.19.2 General 

The Inata TMF is required to contain a minimum of 15.75 Mt of tailings waste material generated from ore 

processing over the proposed seven year mine life.  The design of the facility accommodates appropriate 

statutory requirements for Burkina Faso, international best practice, local planning laws and the operator 

requirements with respect to the safe, efficient and environmentally acceptable disposal of the mine waste 

products to enable: 

• efficient tailings deposition; 

• effective confinement of the solid waste products during the mine life; and 

• ultimate closure following cessation of mining operations to achieve acceptable standards of 

long-term stability and environmental compliance with the minimum of long term maintenance. 

The Inata TMF is a robust facility that: 

• is designed in accordance with best international practice; 

• is designed to be efficiently constructed using proven construction methodologies; 

• promotes optimal settlement of the finest particles; 

• ensures liquid effluents within the depository are effectively attenuated and managed;

• ensures natural surface run-off water flows from outside the facility will not report to the TMF 

and will be managed by the diversion toe drains;  

• promotes the recovery of supernatant water for return to the process plant via decant facilities; 

• minimises the risk of seepage; 

• can be efficiently managed during the dry and wet seasons. 

The TMF also complies with the requirements of the process plant, land availability, project economics, 

environmental constraints and operational flexibility. 

7.19.3 General Description of the TMF 

7.19.3.1 General 

The site is located east of the proposed Inata North Pit, adjacent and to the north of the proposed process 

plant location and comprises: 

• low permeability lined storage facility for waste tailings; 

• Internal drainage systems to promote the drainage and consolidation of the tailings materials; 

• structural earthfill / rockfill water retaining embankments; 

• tailings seepage interception drains; 

• tailings delivery pipelines and distribution system; 

• decant facilities located approximately in the centre of the deposition area; 

• a toe drain to facilitate diversion of natural external surface runoff; 

• drainage return sump and pump system. 

The general arrangements for these components are shown on the respective drawings of the TMF Series for 

the pre-deposition and operational works. 

The topography of the TMF site is relatively flat rising from approximately 330 masl in the eastern side of the 

facility to approximately 340 masl on the western side.  A gentle valley trends from the south-eastern corner, 

north of the process plant and west towards the Inata North Pit.  

The regional topography forms a gentle natural slope, which is suitable for the development of a paddock 

TMF.  The predominant vegetation within the site is generally low shrub with occasional trees, one of which is 

located within the footprint of the proposed facility.  No good quality agricultural topsoils are present with the 

upper layers being formed generally by a sequence of strata including firm light brown/reddish clayey fine 

sands with occasional sub angular to semi rounded gravel overlying firm reddish brown very fine sandy clay 

with frequent sub angular to semi rounded black gravel grading to competent lateritic strata.   

Due to the limitations of the site investigation undertaken during July 2007, only shallow trial pits were 

completed to depths of approximately 2.0 mbgl.  No other layer of foundation material was found and it is 

expected that the competent lateritic material extends to depth in the area of the proposed TMF.

7.19.3.2 Embankment Cross Section  

The brief seismic hazard assessment suggests that the design operating base earthquake (OBE) will be 

0.02 g.  The site is within an area of medium to low seismic activity.  However, the number of potential active 

faults close to the site is currently unknown and the potential for local seismic activity should not be ignored.  

For this reason, a rigorous assessment of the TMF has been adopted.   

Barren stripped overburden shall be utilised to form both the starter wall and the subsequent downstream lifts, 

efficiently developing a "co-disposal" (waste rock / tailings) facility. 

The structural fill material utilised for the main embankment sections should be resistant to the loss of shear 

strength under the design seismic event.  Consequently careful selection of the cross section, fill materials 

and their parameters has been undertaken.  

The above consideration is also influenced by the lack of firm geotechnical information to date.  Geotechnical 

testing is currently underway for the samples of foundation materials obtained during the July 2007 visit as 

well as tailings and rockfill.  Once this geotechnical characterisation is completed, a review of the proposed 

embankment cross section will be possible with the objective of minimising the volumes of rockfill required for 

construction year on year and to improve the fill to tailings ratio of the facility. 

The selection of the most appropriate cross section for the Inata TMF paddock embankment has been 

appraised assuming one main embankment section using downstream construction for the raises of the 

embankment. 

The downstream method for raising the TMF embankment is adopted using approved structural material 

placed sequentially onto the downstream slope of the starter embankment to raise the crest.  The 

embankment will be formed by a compacted earthfill / rockfill starter dam approximately 8.0 m high, with 

slopes of 1 V to 2.5 H on the downstream side and 1 V to 2 H on the upstream side.  The embankment will 

have a crest some 4.0 m wide minimum to allow for traffic of small construction equipment although 

depending on the availability of construction material during the early stages of construction, the crest width 

could be increased. 

The dam will be constructed in lifts some 4 m high from the starting elevation of 331 mamsl.  The starter 

embankment will have a final crest elevation of 339 m (2 lifts of 4.0 m each) and, therefore, will have a height 

of 8.0 m on the eastern wall and approximately 3.0 m on the western wall.  The height of the south and north 

walls will vary between 3.0 and 8.0 m depending on the topography. 

Further raises of the dam embankment will be required year on year to ensure tailings disposal capacity 

according to the mine production schedule and to ensure sufficient freeboard is available to manage the wet 

season incident rainfall into the dam impoundment for the period May to September.  It is planned that all 

subsequent raises of the embankment will be constructed using the downstream method. 

The main disadvantage in using a downstream configuration is that as the elevation increases, the 

embankment cross section area increases and additional rockfill / earthfill volume is required.  This is 

unavoidable at this stage, as the requirement of the installation of a low permeability liner for the

impoundment and the upstream face of the embankment make it very difficult if not impossible to use an 

alternative configuration. 

7.19.3.3 Impoundment Low Permeability Barrier 

Best Available Techniques (BAT Ref 1.4) recommends that where it is necessary to avoid seepage into the 

ground and no natural barrier exists, the bottom of the pond can be made impermeable with a low 

permeability material or other artificial barrier with a target permeability lower than 1 x 10-8 m/s.    

No definitive information is currently available on the cyanide concentration in effluent reporting to the TMF 

but it is understood that Goldbelt is not planning to use any sort of cyanide destruction system and therefore it 

is expected to exceed 250 ppm cyanide.  Under these circumstances, a low permeability barrier is essential to 

minimise the risk of seepage and potential contamination of any groundwater resources. 

As discussed earlier, during July 2007 a limited hydrogeological investigation was completed in the area of the 

TMF, including 5 permeameter tests within the upper 500 mm layers.  The analysis of the natural ground 

underlying the TMF suggests that the in situ permeability varies between 2.02 x 10-6 and 8.36 x 10-8 m/s.  

AMEC consequently recommends that the natural permeability of the in situ materials will required to be 

enhanced. 

Based on the lack of definitive information on the hydrogeological and geotechnical characteristics of the 

proposed TMF site, two options for a low permeability barrier for the TMF impoundment area have been 

considered.  

Option 1: HDPE Liner as low permeability barrier 

A robust solution and recommended approach, based on current information, include the installation of a 

HDPE liner over the base of the TMF to avoid the risk of seepage from the tailings into the groundwater 

system. 

The design solution adopted includes various elements as follows: 

• Enhance Natural Barrier:  The surface area of the impoundment will be treated to lower the 
natural permeability of the site.  The surface will be ripped to a minimum depth of approximately 300 mm.  

Laboratory testing will be used to determine the optimal moisture content of the natural clayey materials 

to achieve minimum permeability.  Based on these tests, moisture conditioning of the material in situ will 

take place followed by compaction of the surface. 

• HDPE Liner Protection:  In order to protect the long term integrity of the low permeability liner, a 
geotextile layer will be installed above the treated subgrade.  The exact specification of the geotextile will 

be determined during the detailed design stage based on the results of compaction tests on the materials 

on site. 

• HDPE Liner:  In order to achieve the minimum 1 x 10-8 m/s permeability, a 1.5 mm thick HDPE 
liner will be installed to cover the entire base of the TMF impoundment.  This low permeability barrier will 

have as a main objective the interception of any potential seepage from the tailings materials to avoid

potential contamination of the surrounding environment with emphasis on protecting any potential 

groundwater resources. 

Option 2: natural Liner as low permeability barrier 

This option assumes that the characteristics of the materials forming the base of the tailings impoundment are 

such that a natural low permeability barrier can be provided. 

The design solution adopted includes various elements as follows: 

• Enhance Natural Barrier:  The surface area of the impoundment will be treated to lower 
the natural permeability of the site.  The surface will be ripped to a minimum depth of approximately 300 

mm.  Laboratory testing will be used to determine the optimal moisture content of the natural clayey 

materials to achieve minimum permeability.  Based on these tests, moisture conditioning of the material 

in situ will take place followed by compaction of the surface. 

Recommended Studies 

Further investigations are recommended prior to and during the detailed design phase to confirm the 

requirements of the low permeability barrier and to confirm tha characteristics of the site such that an 

appropriate selection of the low permeability barrier can be completed.  These should include as a minimum 

the following: 

• Complete the hydrogeological investigation of the site to determine any hydraulic connection 

with local or regional aquifers 

• Determine the availability of appropriate materials in sufficient quantities to construct an 

appropriate natural lining system. 

7.19.3.4 Embankment Low Permeability Barrier 

As for the design solution adopted for the TMF impoundment, the upstream face of the embankment will be 

protected with a low permeability barrier such that the potential for seepage is minimised.  

Similarly, two options for the low permeability barrier have been considered similar to Options 1 and 2 as 

described above.   

The upstream face of the embankment has been designed assuming an HDPE liner is required and therefore 

benches at 4.0 m vertical intervals have been incorporated in the design.  This design should be reviewed 

once the characteristics of the low permeability liner are confirmed. 

7.19.3.5 Drainage 

Consolidation of the tailings may be enhanced by draining pore water via a series of 100 mm perforated pipes 

installed on the liner and using the natural ground profile to promote water flow.  The 100 mm diameter HDPE 

perforated pipes will be provided with a geotextile sock to avoid the ingress of fine tailings particles into the 

drainage system.

The 100 mm perforated pipes will follow an angular pattern to cover the entire surface of the TMF base.  The 

100 mm perforated pipes will report to three central 200 mm perforated HDPE pipes which are surrounded in 

a clean gravel/geofabric filter arrangement.  The collected solution will then be recovered via a solid 400 mm 

diameter HDPE pipe aligned along the eastern embankment and taken to the water return system for 

pumping back into the TMF pond. 

Drawing Nos. 5879000205-005 and 5879000205-006 show both the general layout and details of the basal 

drainage system. 

In addition to the basal drainage system and in order to promote rapid drainage and consolidation of the 

tailings mass, additional drainage layers will be incorporated as the tailings beach rises.  A network of 

horizontally laid wick drains (Mebradrain) will be installed covering the entire tailings surface at 4.0 m vertical 

intervals.  The mebradrain layers will report to a peripheral drain installed over the berm of the upstream face 

embankment and will discharge to the seepage return pond via solid pipes. 

7.19.4 Tailings Disposal 

7.19.4.1 Deposition Strategy Objectives 

The tailings deposition strategy will be designed and managed throughout the life of the depository to meet 

the following main objectives: 

• beach development adjacent to all embankments to develop a drained perimeter beach of 

coarse tailings; 

• emergency deposition by open ended discharge to the inside area of the depository formed 

upstream of the beach; 

• deposition to maximise sub-aerial deposition and consolidation of tailings; 

• deposition to effectively utilise the net available storage capacity; 

• effective management of the size and location of the supernatant pond; 

• minimise the operating costs of the tailings distribution system; 

• minimise down time by providing operating flexibility; 

• facilitate the implementation of the depository closure strategy; 

• minimise potential for dust emissions during summer months. 

Tailings will be spigotted sequentially along the four embankments to allow the desiccation and consolidation 

of the tailings materials.  A degree of hydraulic segregation of the tailings will occur with coarser tailings being 

deposited closer to the deposition points and finer tailings and slimes being deposited in or near the tailings 

pond.  Tailings deposition management will be required to avoid the excessive accumulation of fine materials 

in a single location of the impoundment which would have a detrimental effect on consolidation and could 

create significant problems on closure.  To this effect the deposition will be managed such that the tailings 

pond is continually moved allowing the homogeneous distribution of the tailings.

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 232 of 334 

 

During the life of the depository the distribution pipe network will be raised and extended as the tailings 

elevation increases and the paddock embankment is raised. 

7.19.4.2 Sub-aerial Tailings Disposal  

The principle of sub-aerial tailings deposition comprises the discharge of material onto the beach via a series 

of spigot points or 'open end' pipes, positively fixed to the main delivery line, which can be opened and closed 

as required.  Reference to the meteorological parameters for the project site suggests that the ambient 

temperature and evaporation for the site will allow sub-aerial spigotting techniques to be used throughout the 

year.   

The sequential discharge of tailings to the TMF beach will result in a laminated deposit which exhibits a 

vertical coefficient of permeability some one to two orders of magnitude lower than the horizontal permeability.   

Following discharge of tailings by sub-aerial deposition techniques, the tailings slurry will flow gently over the 

beach and form uniformly thick layers, which for beach slopes of 1% to 0.5% range between 100 mm and 

150 mm in thickness.  Once the beach has been covered, the initial spigots will be closed and other spigots 

opened.  During placement, the coarse fractions hydraulically will settle out close to the embankment while, 

the finer fractions will be carried in solution into the central sections of the TMF.  During this process 

supernatant water will be released from the slurry, and slowly flow over the beach towards the supernatant 

pond where it will be decanted back to the process plant for reuse.  Additional water will be removed from the 

TMF by evaporation and sub-surface drainage, which further consolidates the tailings and increases the in 

situ density. 

7.19.4.3 Rate of Rise 

The Inata TMF will, once the embankment elevation raises above 336 mamsl, form a square paddock some 

500 m by 500 m.  Due to its characteristics the rate of rise of the tailings within the paddock will be almost 

constant through the life of the facility. 

The only exception to this rule is during the initial filling stages where the square paddock is not completely 

covered in tailings, due to the topography of the site, and therefore the rate of rise of the tailings will be 

greater. 

The rate of rise during most of the life of the facility will be approximately 5.0 m per year.  The effect of the 

high rate of rise on the facility will be the lack of time for the deposited tailings to drain and consolidate, 

potentially generating problems of tailings saturation and excess pore water pressures leading to lack of 

tailings strength which would create significant  structural problems to sequential construction during cover 

placement at closure.   

In order to maximise drainage and consolidation of the tailings mass, drains will be installed at the base of the 

impoundment.  The drains will promote and collect seepage from the tailings and directed to a seepage 

control and recirculation system to be returned to the supernatant pond by pumping.   

In addition to the drains installed at the base of the facility and above the low permeability liner, additional 

drainage layers will be installed at 4.0 m vertical intervals on each raise of the dam embankment.  These

FS80050

drainage layers will be formed by horizontally laid "mebradrain" strips installed at 4.0 m centres over the entire 

tailings surface, promoting drainage and maximising consolidation of the tailings. 

The above technique has been successfully proven on gold tailings of similar characteristics as those 

expected to be produced at the Inata Project, under conditions of high rainfall and low evaporation rates and 

similar or higher rates of rise of the tailings surface. 

Based on the above, it is expected that the proposed rate of rise of the tailings at Inata, although high 

compared to traditional practice, will provide a stable tailings mass which will rapidly drain and consolidate 

and which will not present access problems during closure and rehabilitation. 

7.19.4.4 Freeboard 

In accordance with ICOLD, the hydrological design of any water retaining embankment must take account of 

storm water ingress, natural water inflow and process plant fluid management, safely balancing them against 

storage and outflow.  To maintain the integrity of the TMF and ensure the safety of downstream communities 

and property, discharge will not be permitted from the facility except in extreme emergency, when a strictly 

controlled discharge may be required. 

It is well known that in the northernmost areas of the country, mainly the areas north of 14°N, the rainy season 

sets in relatively late. Likewise, over the whole country, July, August and September are the rainiest months.   

The maximum 24-hour rainfall amounts generally are measured in the full rainy season, however, it is not rare 

that an exceptional quantity is recorded at the beginning or end of the season. Since the beginning of 

measurements until 2004, Arbinda recorded more than 100 mm in 1954 and 1994, in other words, 40 years 

after the first measurement. Djibo on the other hand has never recorded a single rainfall event of more than 

100 mm, and Dori, only a single received one in 1994. 

The layout of the proposed tailings facility will result in incident rainfall and tailings water being the only water 

entering the facility.  Records indicate that a maximum average monthly rainfall will reach approximately 336 

mm during August.  A design concept allowing a minimum operational freeboard of 2.0 m at any time has 

been adopted and is considered appropriate. 

The minimum allowed freeboard will safely attenuate a flood within the TMF, without overtopping the water 

retention embankment.  As rains in the project area occur in a very well defined period during the year (May to 

September), the minimum freeboard will be further enhance by ensuring that the construction of each year's 

raise of the dam embankment is completed by April of each year.  In this way, a minimum of 1.3 Mm3 of 

additional storm water storage capacity will be available at the beginning of the rainy season with a minimum 

of 0.75 Mm3 of additional storm water storage capacity remaining at the end of the rainy season. 

7.19.4.5 TMF Depth Capacity  

Based on available topographical information, the estimated net storage capacity of the TMF has been 

calculated assuming an average dry density of 1.5 tonnes/m3 with horizontal and sloped (1 in 200) beach 

profile.  The results are presented in graphical form on Figure 86 below and suggest that for the safe storage 

of an average 2.25 Mtpa the maximum height of the downstream pre-deposition starter embankment will be 8 

m along the eastern embankment at an elevation of 339 masl. The final embankment elevation will be

371 masl with a maximum height of the embankment of approximately 38.0 m along the eastern embankment.  

The ultimate crest length is approximately 2 500 m, which will impound an area of some 40 hectares. 

Table 104 below presents the overall construction schedule for the dam embankment to achieve the tailings 

disposal requirements as defined by the production schedule.  It also presents the minimum water storage 

capacity for the attenuation of rainfall events without water discharge from the facility.

7.19.5 TMF Stability Analysis 

The TMF downstream embankments are designed for both static and pseudo static loads worst case loading 

conditions.  The primary consideration is to ensure that the embankments exhibit an appropriate factor of 

safety with respect to stability under the assumed range of loading conditions. 

7.19.5.1 Stability Design Parameters 

The safety factor of a slope is defined as the ratio of shear strength to the shear stress required to maintain 

the slope in equilibrium.  According to the Finnish "Dam Safety Code of Practice" and the BREF Document, 

the total factor of safety of dams in a constant seepage flow should be at least 1.5.   Under a dynamic load, 

the slope should not exhibit a factor of safety less than unity. 

The stability analysis design values derived from the preliminary seismic hazard assessment for the Inata site 

are summarised in Table 105.

The geotechnical parameters used for the stability analyses are summarised in Table 106 for all materials 

modelled using the Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion.  The parameters adopted have been estimated and 

confirmation of these should be sought prior to the detailed design stage.

7.19.5.2 Stability Analysis Results 

The stability analyses of the downstream embankments have been carried out using SLOPE/W, a limit 

equilibrium based commercial software package developed and marketed by Geoslope International of 

Canada.  The factors of safety against sliding were calculated using the Morgenstern-Price method.  The 

analysis of the dam is based on sections corresponding to the initial and the final dam embankment 

configurations. 

The analysis assumes that the main embankments are founded on the competent lateritic materials found on 

site from depths of between 300 mm and 1.0 m.  Representative strength parameters are assigned to the silt 

materials with the ultimate base horizon being modelled as solid bedrock.  Pore water pressure conditions 

within the embankment are not considered as the upstream face will be provided with a HDPE liner which will 

prevent seepage and therefore the formation of a phreatic surface within the embankment. 

All the stability analyses have been undertaken assuming both static and pseudo-static loading conditions.  

The analysis of the downstream scenarios has been carried out for two conditions: the starter dam with a 

crest elevation at 339 masl; and the final dam configuration with a crest elevation at 367 masl.   

The stability analysis for the upstream face has taken into consideration the most critical stage in the dam life 

which is the starter condition immediately prior to the start of tailings deposition.  At this stage, the upstream 

embankment face will have the greater exposed slope with neither tailings nor water to provide support to the 

slope. 

The results of the analysis for downstream and upstream embankments are summarised in Table 107 and 

Table 108 and shown diagrammatically in Drawing Nos. 5879000205-007, 5879000205-008 and

Additional earthfill material and tailings laboratory testing will be required for the detailed design stage to 

validate the feasibility design assumptions for the materials properties, section and overall profile as a prelude 

to the detailed design stability analyses.   

7.19.6 Embankment Construction  

Selected rockfill / earthfill won from the open pit stripping operations will be used in the development of the 

structural zones of the TMF confining embankments to form robust cross sections, which complies with the 

various design code structural requirements for a co-disposal facility. 

7.19.6.1 Embankment 

The main starter embankment and subsequent lifts are designed as a homogeneous earthfill structure formed 

to a 1.0 vertical to 2.0 horizontal (1.0V:2.0H) upstream and a 1.0V : 2.0H downstream profile with a 4.0 m 

wide horizontal crest.  The design has assumed that pre-deposition and sequential operational raises will be 

formed using selected open material, compacted in controlled layers.   

To minimise the risk of seepage from the deposited tailings and to avoid the formation of an internal phreatic 

surface within the embankment, the dam impoundment and the upstream face of the embankment will be 

provided with a HDPE liner. 

Internal drains will be installed to allow the seepage from the tailings to be recovered and recirculated.  The 

characteristics of the drainage material will be selected to prevent the clogging of the drains and their 

malfunction.  Drainage will ultimately discharge via 100 mm nominal bore perforated pipes to a 400 mm 

diameter solid collection pipe, gravitating to the insulated drainage collection pump station, where it will either 

be returned to the supernatant pond or pumped to the process plant. 

7.19.6.2 Sequential Development 

The TMF will be sequentially raised each year to maintain the confining embankment crest elevation in 

advance of the tailings beach while also providing sufficient freeboard to attenuate the May to August rainfalls 

and the summer Peak Maximum Precipitation (PMP) event. 

The preliminary elevations for the sequential expansion of the facility have been derived from the depth 

capacity appraisal and will require to be optimised at the detailed design stage based on validated tailings 

parameters.  A summary of the staged embankment elevations is presented in Table 3.1 above and 

graphically in Figure 87 below. 

To provide sufficient storage for the initial year of production, the TMF embankment pre-deposition works will 

be constructed to a maximum height of 8.0 m, measured from the lowest contour to the 339 masl crest 

elevation.  The facility will then be sequentially raised every year over the 7 year project life to the final crest 

elevation of 371 masl.

7.19.7.1 Pipe Design 

The Inata Project site will be subject to prolonged periods of very high temperatures in summer.  The 

preliminary design of the pipelines and tailings deposition arrangements consequently takes account of the 

extreme temperatures by ensuring the following: 

• the pipes are appropriate to maintain their performance at high temperatures; 

• the pipes are formed on a continuous grade so that they will quickly and easily drain if the flow 

stops; 

• adequate protection of pipes is provided to avoid damage by mine traffic; 

• the thermal movements are adequately accommodated; 

• overall, the provision of a simple system, requiring minimal maintenance and operation. 

7.19.7.2 Slurry Transport Analysis 

The processed ore will produce one blended tailings stream for disposal into the TMF which will be 

discharged at an estimated slurry density of 45% solids. 

Slurry transport analysis has not been undertaken to date as the characteristics of the tailings materials to be 

delivered to the tailings dam are not yet defined.  It is envisaged however that the tailings will be delivered at 

an approximate maximum rate of rate of 180  m3 per hour (2.25 Mt per year). 

The delivery system will be formed from the plant tailings thickener by the following elements: 

• Pumping station appropriate to deliver 180 m3 per hour with a total static head loss of 

approximately 40 m and a total friction head loss of approximately 5 m per km 

• Tailings delivery pipeline, probably a 400 mm diameter HDPE pipeline from the pump station to 

the south eastern corner of the TMF

• a peripheral pipeline system located on the crest of the embankment at each stage of the 

embankment raise 

• a break pressure valve located immediately upstream of the pump station for release of tailings 

in case of pump failure or stoppage. 

• Emergency discharge pond sufficient to store the contents of the tailings pipeline located next 

to the pump station 

• Break pressure installations as required due to topography 

• a system of spigots around the entire facility such that tailings disposal can take place from 

every side to facilitate tailings pond management and control. 

The precise design of the tailings delivery system should be completed once the characteristics of the tailings 

materials are known, at the detailed design stage. 

7.19.7.3 Spigotting System 

A total of eighty 150 mm nominal diameter spigots will be installed within the TMF tailings delivery line, at a 

maximum interval of 25 m or, every second pipe length. 

Tailings will be spigotted all year round on a sequence that allows the management of the tailings pond and 

also for the constant raising of the tailings beach in layers up to 100 mm thick such that desiccation and 

settlement of the deposited tailings is maximised while minimising creation of dusty conditions.   

The details of the spigotting system are presented in Drawing No. 5879000205-010. 

7.19.8 Return Water System 

A pumping facility will be provided to manage the return of water from the TMF to the process plant.  This will 

include drainage from the internal drainage system and water decanted from the tailings supernatant pond. 

The seepage water recirculation system will comprise of the following elements: 

• A HDPE lined 30 m by 30 m by 4 m deep recirculation pond 

• A pumping system for the return of seepage water to the tailings pond capable of pumping up 

to 25 m3 per hour of water from the recirculation pond to the tailings pond 

• a level trigger such that operation of the pump system is automatically activated once the level 

of water reaches the predefined level allowing for a 1.0 m freeboard.   

• All seepage waters collected by the main 400 mm seepage collection pipe will be delivered to 

the recirculation pond. 

The main water return system will be formed by a floating barge equipped with two pumps for the return of up 

to 450 m3 per hour to the process plant with an additional pump as standby.

7.19.9 TMF Water Balance 

The safe management of the TMF water component of the Inata tailings stream and strategies in balancing 

net deficit and/or excess water within the system has been addressed by computer modelling.  Variable 

seasonal parameters are considered which model the magnitude of water reporting to the tailings dam from 

the process circuit and local precipitation, and equate the total gains against system outputs due to process 

circuit abstraction, evaporation and potential seepage.  The preliminary Inata process plant operational 

conditions are modelled using monthly iterations, and the design requirement for additional makeup identified. 

Only one option of the TMF has been modeled for the water balance as it is assumed that, for the purposes of 

seepage, both options would have the same result in minimising seepage from the facility.  Should Option 2 

be adopted, the natural low permeability barrier provided is expected will minimise seepage and therefore its 

assumed will perform in a manner similar to the low permeability barrier adopted for option 1 of the design. 

The Inata TMF water balance model is based on the following assumptions and parameters:  

• the flotation tailings will be delivered at 45.0% solids content (%pulp density); 

• the average tailings tonnage is approximately 6 250 t/day; 

• the balance is based on assumptions of tailings characteristics; 

• the TMF will be operated on the basis of 100% availability; 

• supernatant water will be of acceptable quality for reuse within the process plant; 

• process plant losses will be made up from the Gomde Barrage; 

• the rainfall depths are mean monthly values, as presented in

• the evaporation records are average monthly values, as presented in ; 

• excess storm run-off from the beach will be attenuated within the supernatant pond; 

• An average runoff factor for tailings is assumed to be 0.7. 

All of the above will require confirmation once the hydrogeological characteristics of the site and the physical 

characteristics of the low permeability barrier have been confirmed.

A paddock depository arrangement has been modelled which safely stores the annual tailings stream.   

Tailings discharged to the TMF at an average rate of 6 250 tonnes per day at 45% solids content, will deliver 

some 7 639 m3 of water per day.   

Laboratory evaluation of similar gold tailings to those expected at Inata, suggest that between 26 % and 33% 

of the delivery water will be entrained within the matrix of the tailings following discharge, while the 

consolidation characteristics suggest that between 67% and 74% of the interstitial water will ultimately be 

realised.  A conservative water lock up percentage of 30 % has consequently been adopted to model long-

term water entrainment losses within the flotation tailings. 

Further water loss from the tailings mass occurs due to surface evaporation.  As the facility has been provided 

with a low permeability liner system, no seepage has been considered.  

The mean annual run-off coefficient for the tailings beach of 0.7 is inclusive of surface evaporation losses from 

the tailings.  

A total of three meteorological cases have been addressed which are summarised as follows: 

• Case 1: Average monthly precipitation, average evaporation, average monthly tonnage, 

supernatant pond operated to between 3% and 9% of the paddock area and confirmed to the centre of 

the facility.  Maximum available process water abstraction. 

• Case 2: Wet Year, maximum monthly precipitation, minimum monthly evaporation, 

average monthly tonnage, supernatant pond operated between 3% and 9%, maximum available process 

water abstraction.

• Case 3: Dry Year, minimum monthly precipitation, maximum monthly evaporation, 

average monthly tonnage, supernatant pond operated to between 3% and 6%, maximum process water 

abstraction. 

The results for each case are presented in full in Appendix D, summarised on Table 110 and discussed in the 

following paragraphs. 

The first model assumes that for a year with average rainfall and evaporation, sub-aerial tailings deposition 

will be maximised by restricting the size of the supernatant pond to an average area of 2 Ha throughout the 

year varying between 1 Ha. and 3 Ha.  A minimum depth of water of 0.5 m has been assumed for the 

modelling. Throughout the year, between 68% and 80% of the tailings delivery water volume can be 

abstracted from the supernatant pond and returned to the process plant with an average for the year of 71% 

with the remainder of the water being required as make up water from the Gomde Barrage 

Case 2 assesses a wet year assuming maximum monthly precipitation and minimum evaporation.  The results 

suggest that up to 95% of tailings delivery water volume can be won from the supernatant pond with an 

average for the year of 78%. 

Similarly, the dry year scenario has been modelled assuming the minimum monthly rainfall and the maximum 

evaporation.   The results suggest that approximately 68% can be returned from the pond throughout the 

year.   

The TMF has been designed and the construction scheduled to attenuate a probable maximum precipitation 

(PMP) 24 hour event comprising approximately 400 000 m3 of rainfall into the facility or the equivalent of 

some 1 500 mm of water which is well in excess of any estimation.  Uncontrolled discharge to the 

environment will not occur.   

The conclusions from the water balance modelling are summarised as follows: 

• the project will maximise process water abstraction from the tailings supernatant pond; 

• should the combined abstraction be greater than 100% of the process plant requirements, 
excess supernatant will be stored within the supernatant pond; 

• normal storm events will be attenuated, the PMF will be attenuated within the TMF facility by 
maintaining a minimum freeboard of 1.0 m; 

• process plant water make up will be sourced from the Gomde Barrage. During periods of 
average rainfall, make up requirements will vary between 47 000 m3/month and 75 000 m3/month with a 
total estimated at just under 0.8 Mm3 per year; 

• during periods of maximum rainfall make up water requirements will vary between 23 000 
m3/month and 70 000 m3/month with a total estimated at 0.64 Mm3 per year; 

• during periods of minimum rainfall, make up water requirements will vary between 67 000 
m3/month and 74 000 m3/month with a total estimated at just over 0.88 Mm3 per year;

7.19.10 Instrumentation 

In order to ensure the continued efficient performance of the TMF and to validate design assumptions, the 

main embankment will be fully instrumented to: 

• verify that the material properties and the behaviour of the structures and foundations are within 

the limits predicted in the design process; 

• to provide a continuous record and forewarning of any potential distress in the TMF structure or 

foundations, which may require remediation works to preserve the integrity of the facility. 

• The following instrumentation will be incorporated into the Inata TMF: 

• piezometers (automatic and manual) within the tailings mass to monitor pore water pressures; 

• settlement gauges ; 

• settlement beacons at every stage of the embankment construction; 

• seepage measurement devices both for quantity and quality. 

Ground water quality will be monitored via a minimum of five cased boreholes installed around the TMF.  The 

location of these boreholes will be defined once the hydrogeological investigation of the site has been 

completed, probably during the detailed design stage. 

As part of the detailed engineering design, details of the instrumentation and guidance as to the 

recommended frequency of methods of monitoring will be developed and an operation and maintenance 

manual then provided to ensure effective management and monitoring of the TMF during the life of the facility. 

7.19.11 Closure 

7.19.11.1 General 

It is recommended that a 'best practice' closure plan should be developed at the detailed design stage for the 

Inata Project based on guidelines similar to those prepared by the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development 

and Mines (1995) or the Draft Reference Document on Best Available Techniques of Management of Tailings. 

The plan will incorporate a long-term target for closure and rehabilitation which will permit the mine operator to 

leave the site in a condition that requires limited further maintenance or monitoring.   

The main closure activities for the project, including the TMF, which will require remediation, are envisaged to 

be: 

• remediation of the open pit to ensure slope stability, public and wildlife security and safety; 

• remediation of the waste dumps; 

• dismantling of all surface infrastructure not required for future end-use; 

• vegetation of the tailings surface and downstream embankments to minimise the potential for 

wind and water erosion;

• ongoing downstream environmental monitoring programme. 

It is recommended that the management and operational requirements for implementing the environmental 

procedures are reviewed in the updated EIA and the costs appraised as part of the overall project strategy 

plan. 

7.19.11.2 TMF Closure 

The TMF will comprise on completion a 36 m high structural fill embankment confining some 10 Mm3 of 

process waste.  The facility has been engineered for closure such that drainage and consolidation of the 

tailings mass occurs concurrent with the TMF operation leading to a rapid stabilisation of the surface post 

operation.   

The above will allow the rapid construction of a cover system to minimise the potential for wind and water 

erosion with the objectives of long-term stability and an appropriate after use, which requires minimal 

maintenance.  The process of closure will commence prior to the cessation of mining operations, probably 

during the final two years of processing operations, to ensure that the objectives can be achieved cost 

effectively and will continue as the performance of the depository demands. 

As is considered best practice for mine and tailings disposal sites internationally, information will be collected 

throughout the deposition period to ensure that an appropriate closure strategy is adopted.  This information 

will include data on tailings geotechnical and geochemical properties, as well as on vegetation types, 

hydrology, meteorology etc.  These data will be incorporated into the closure planning documents, which will 

be prepared within two years of start up and updated on a regular basis throughout the operations. 

To achieve these objectives, the closure plan will define a number of key periods of activity on the facility 

which are identified and described in the following sections. 

7.19.11.3 Pre Closure Period 

During approximately the last two years of processing, preparatory works will be commenced including 

modification of the tailings disposal system to ensure achievement of the final surface topography and to 

encourage early consolidation of the upper surface of the depository.  This will entail the following: 

• introduction of coarser materials as appropriate with the slurry to achieve enhanced 

consolidation and to facilitate early access to the tailings surface post closure ; 

• control of deposition to maintain and minimise the tailings pond; 

• stockpiling of approved low permeability overburden materials for spreading onto the tailings; 

• inclusion of nutrients and seed stock into the final layers as determined from vegetation trials. 

The rehabilitation will use natural materials stockpiled within the working area during the early stages of 

construction to ensure the tailings basin achieves and retains an appropriate end-use.  

A final cover will require to be designed during this period.  However, for the purposed of this study, AMEC 

have assumed that up to 300 mm of clayey silt material will be placed onto the consolidated tailings which in 

turn will be covered with a minimum of 300 mm protective layer to avoid surface erosion especially during high

intensity rainfall events.  Surface drainage gullies will be formed and side slope spillways installed to prevent 

storm erosion of the completed embankment. 

7.19.11.4 Post Closure Period 

After the cessation of tailings disposal, intensive input will be required to achieve the final surface topography 

commensurate with the agreed after use and to ensure its long-term integrity.  This will include the following: 

• operation, as required, of the decant pump to drain the residual supernatant from the tailings 

depository and convey this water to an effluent treatment works; 

• progressive ripping and scarifying and landscaping of stockpile areas, haul tracks and services 

road; 

• operation and maintenance of the decant pump and pipework, as conditions dictate; 

• operation of the drainage collection sump pump and pipework to recycle seepage water back to 

the supernatant pond or the effluent treatment works as appropriate; 

• ongoing maintenance of the TMF and its associated infrastructure; 

• monitoring of water quality, flows and water levels in the drainage collection sump; 

• monitoring of embankment performance from surveys, piezometers, settlement gauges and 

seepage data together with annual expert inspection and instrumentation audit; 

• placement of any cover/capillary break layer as considered appropriate, using appropriate 

equipment.  The depth and grading of the material comprising such a cover will depend on the 

geotechnical characteristics of the final tailings layers.  Material for this cover is assumed to be 

freely available from overburden waste stockpiles; 

• all roads not required for the servicing of the embankment during the implementation of closure 

will be ripped and scarified to encourage re-vegetation of the surface; and 

• independent post closure auditing. 

7.19.11.5 Long-Term Maintenance Period 

Once any capping and initial re-vegetation has been achieved there will be a need for a longer-term 

programme of works including maintenance and inspection prior to the eventual handover to the local 

authority or other party.  This will involve the following: 

• dismantling and removal of the decant pump and pipework; 

• dismantling and removal of the sump pump and pipework; 

• cessation of recycling of seepage water; 

• ongoing maintenance of the vegetation including thinning and replacement of selected planting 

to ensure that the long-term species diversity and health is achieved;

• it is anticipated that the size and importance of the TMF embankment will require that there is 

an ongoing programme of monitoring, instrumentation and of inspection both locally and by a 

competent expert.  The maintenance of this function is consistent with statutory requirements 

for long-term inspection of embankments and tailings depositories within Western Europe and 

is an essential requirement to ensure that the embankment integrity is maintained. 

7.19.12 Bill of Quantities & Cost Estimation 

The estimated quantities for the construction of the embankment and the impoundment for the Inata TMF are 

included in detail in Appendix E1 for option 1 of the low permeability barrier and in Appendix E2 for Option 2.  

The quantities are also summarised in Table 111 and

Table 112 for options 1 and 2 respectively.   

The tables and appendices include an estimation of the construction costs based on the quantities estimated 

and the information available to date for the cost of items and materials. 

The cost estimation includes the following elements: 

• General Items, including insurances mobilisation and demobilisation of contractors; 

• Quality control, including supervision of construction and geotechnical testing; 

• Site clearance, including excavation of the embankment footprint to competent foundations; 

• Diversion channels, including erosion protection and energy dissipaters; 

• Tailings drainage system including horizontally laid wick drains 

• Embankment construction assuming materials are sourced from open pit operations 

• Embankment compaction will be achieved by spreading, moisture conditioning and compaction 

with a smooth vibrating roller.  Additional compaction will be provided by traffic of mine trucks 

delivering rock fill. 

• Installation of a HDPE liner system including protection geotextile in both the impoundment 

area as well as the upstream face of the embankment for Option 1 of the Low Permeability 

Barrier 

• Installation of a natural liner system in both the impoundment and the upstream face of the 

embankment for Option 2 of the Low Permeability Barrier. 

• Tailings delivery system, including pipes and fittings 

• Tailings pumping system 

• Return water system including seepage collection and recirculation and decant water 

recirculation; 

• Decant floating pontoon;

7.20 Process Plant Control Philosophy 

7.20.1 Introduction 

This section details the Project Control Philosphy and for ease of understanding should be read in conjunction 

with the Process Flow Diagrams and the P&ID Diagrams found in the Appendices.  It is not intended to be a 

detailed plant operating manual for the process. 

7.20.2 Control System (SCADA) 

The plant is designed to operate with a low level of automation using a Supervisory Control and Data 

(SCADA) system to control the process related drives from the central control room, by means of PLCs at the 

MCC locations.  The status of the drives indicating MCC ready, emergency stops ready, field (local) start and 

drive running will be fed to the PLCs.  A run signal will be supplied from the PLC to each drive.  

In the case of the Crusher area there is a separate control station for the drives in that area and the 

information fed to the main SCADA system will only be for monitoring and plant management functions.  

Although crusher drives will not be started from the main control room there is an emergency stop facility 

provided.  This emergency stop can only be cancelled and the system reset by signal from the main control 

room. 

During operation of the plant the operators have a choice of either normal (auto) / manual or local (field) mode 

and the field control mode can be selected from the operators PC. 

Auto mode allows the drives to be started/stopped in sequence while manual operation allows starting out of 

sequence.  Process and safety interlocks will be active for both of these modes.  Local stop/start stations are 

positioned at each main drive position for testing and maintenance duties and under this condition the process 

interlocks will be over-ridden. 

It is expected that operators will check throughout the plant to make sure that it is safe to start any drives.  

Pages are displayed on the operator PCs at the central control room to indicate the status and operation of 

each plant area based on the flow diagrams and P&IDs.  These will also give an indication of the mode of 

operation that each drive is in. PI loops are monitored and controlled from the operator PCs. 

7.20.3 General Requirements 

All drives can be locked off at the MCCs for maintenance purposes. 

Conveyors have a combination of emergency pull-wire switches along their entire length and under speed 

(rotation) detection/shutdown.  

Start up sirens sound for 20 seconds before drives are started. In the case of electric cranes and hoists a 

continuous audible alarm sounds during travel mode. 

Mill and Tailings sump pumps are started manually and run on an intermediate set level. An alarm is triggered 

if the high level is reached.  A low level alarm is provided.  

There will be a 20 second delay before the mill starts and during this time an audible alarm will sound.

7.20.4 Crushing 

Vendor supplied crusher control panels monitor and control all the crusher functions and communicate 

start/stop, alarm and run signals to the crusher area control system. 

Ore is loaded directly into the Jaw Crusher Feed Hopper and extracted from the bottom of the hopper by a 

variable speed Apron Feeder which discharges over a static grizzly to the Jaw Crusher.  A riddlings conveyor 

is included below the Apron Feeder.  

A double idler mass meter is used to indicate the tonnage of ore crushed and provides local and remote 

(Control Room) displays of the instantaneous and totalised tonnage.  The mass meter output is used as a 

basis for manual adjustment of the speed control of the feeder, locally or from the crusher control room. 

Regular samples will be taken to determine the ore moisture content and produce a factor to be used to 

compensate the belt weigher reading and calculate the dry tonnage processed. 

The tramp iron magnet is manually cleaned and a manual water spray is installed over the conveyor.  

7.20.5 Mill Section 

The feed rate to the Ball Mill is measured by a double idler mass meter for accounting purposes and the feed 

rate from the vibratory feeders at the crushed ore stockpile is adjusted to maintain the feed against a set point.  

The mill inlet water feed is controlled manually and a flow meter is included to indicate locally and in the 

control room. 

A density gauge on the cyclone feed controls water addition to the mill discharge sump. 

Variable speed discharge pumps are adjusted to maintain a constant level in the mill discharge sump.  

Lime is added to the SAG Mill feed belt from a screw feeder at a rate controlled by a pH probe in the CIL 

tanks.  An alarm is included on the pH monitoring system in order that the addition of caustic can be initiated.  

The mill power draw is measured by a kW meter. 

A pressure indicator is provided on the cyclone feed, to enable correct pressure balance by manual 

adjustments.  

The Mill Control Panel monitors and controls all the mill functions with stop/start and alarm signals interfaced 

with the SCADA system. 

7.20.6 Gravity Concentration 

The gravity concentration devices are equipped with their own vendor supplied automation package.  The 

cycle time is set via the control panel which is interfaced with the SCADA system.  The system is designed to 

operate with access control, using passwords and a touch screen graphical interface.  Access to the primary 

gravity concentrator is restricted. 

An automated pinch valve is provided to control the concentrator feed during a flush cycle.  On expiry of the 

countdown timer, the normally open feed valve from the scalping screen under pan to the concentrator will 

close.  The screen undersize then reports to a bypass line until the concentrator finishes flushing and reaches

full speed again.  The feed valve from the scalping screen under pan to the concentrator then reopens and the 

bypass line empties. 

Manually taken samples around the gravity circuit will be used for process control and accounting purposes.  

An air cooler and dryer is used for the compressed air required for automated valves and process 

instruments.  The condensate are discharged from the cooler drier periodically by an automatic drain valve.  A 

filter is provided to remove any fine particulate contamination that may affect the actuators. 

7.20.7 Carbon-In-Leach Section 

The trash screen undersize is sampled automatically before it passes to CIL tank 1.  

A shift laboratory cabin is provided on top of the CIL tanks.  Manually taken slurry samples from the various 

tanks are filtered where necessary, and used for process control and accounting purposes, such as the 

titrated lime and cyanide or carbon concentration determinations.  Carbon transfer is controlled and actuated 

on a time cycle. The inter stage carbon transfer pumps on tanks 6, 5, 4 and 3 are arranged to run for 22.5 

minutes 12 times a day and this will  move 2.5 tons of carbon through the system during the day. On tank 2 

the carbon transfer pump runs for 2 hours to feed the loaded carbon screen and this will take place every day. 

The Loaded Carbon Screen and the process water supply to it only run when the transfer pump runs. 

A pH monitoring system is used to control lime addition by means of a variable speed rotary valve fitted to the 

lime silo. 

7.20.8 Acid Wash, Elution, Carbon Regeneration and Gold Room 

The acid wash and elution process sequences are controlled manually.  The elution column is equipped with 

pressure and temperature gauges, as well as a pressure relief valve. 

A vendor Control Panel for the elution heater will control the heater operation and interface with the SCADA 

system. 

The elution tank is fitted with a level switch to trip the elution pump at low level to prevent the progressive 

cavity pump from running dry.  The eluate temperature is controlled via temperature monitoring on the exit of 

the eluate heater bank that controls the power supply to the heater bank.  There is temperature indication of 

the solution exiting the column. 

The regeneration section operates continuously, depending on the availability of eluted carbon and the 

requirements for regenerated carbon to be added to the CIL circuit.  The Regeneration Kiln Panel will control 

all functions of the kiln and communicates with the SCADA system for stop/start and status functions only.   

The kiln is operated from the local control panel to give a maximum capacity at the design regeneration 

temperature and speed control of the screw feeder.  

The carbon passes through the dewatering screen ahead of the carbon feed bin, which is sized to 

accommodate a batch of carbon transferred from the elution column.  The carbon is then fed to the kiln at a 

rate controlled by a manually set variable speed screw feeder.

The temperature of the electrically heated carbon regeneration kiln is controlled by temperature sensors which 

are part of the kiln control package.  In order that the kiln can be rotated to prevent distortion of the shell 

during cooling in the event of a power failure, an emergency power supply is provided.  Manually taken 

samples are taken to test activity of regenerated carbon. 

The rectifier controllers for the electrowinning cells are located in the rectifier room outside the Gold Room.  

The controller potentiometer is located at the rectifier unit and the current and voltage are indicated on the 

panel.  The calcine furnace is equipped with local temperature control systems to control electrical heaters.  

Manually taken samples, such as loaded, acid washed, eluted and regenerated carbon, gravity concentrate, 

bullion prills and acid wash and elution solutions, from the acid wash, elution, regeneration and gold room 

sections will be used for process control and accounting purposes. 

7.20.9 Reagents 

All reagent make-up is by manual operation and controlled with reference to high and low level monitors. 

Dosage rates are controlled by variable speed metering pumps. 

7.20.10 Tailings 

An automatic sampler is positioned after the tailings screen. The tailings pump speed is controlled 

automatically from the tailings sump level. 

7.20.11 Compressed Air 

The compressors are run on automatic local control based on the system pressure to start and stop the units 

as required. The status of the compressors will be monitored by the main control system.  An air receiver for 

the plant and instrument air are fitted with pressure gauges and automated drain valves that periodically drain 

any accumulated moisture from the receivers.  The instrument air supply is fitted with an air dryer.

8.3.6 Septic Tank and Sewage System 

The camp has a septic tank and filter bed system to cater 230 personnel. The plant has a separate smaller 

septic tank and filter bed system which has a 100 man capacity. Overflow water from these systems will be 

irrigated locally as required. 

 

8.4 Gomde Barrage 

8.4.1 General 

Various options were considered at the pre feasibility design stage for the provision of a secure and reliable 

water supply for the Inata Gold Project.  Various surface water impoundments and ground water abstraction 

options were analysed. 

The results of the preliminary studies leading to the pre feasibility study indicated that a barrage in the vicinity 

of the village of Mormosal was the best and most reliable option for the water supply to the project. 

Following completion of the pre feasibility study, a site visit was undertaken by AMEC to further assess 

potential sites for a water supply facility for the project. North of the Mormosal site near the village of Gomde 

was located and a topographical survey requested to confirm the characteristics of the site. 

Further to the above, AMEC was commissioned to supervise a geotechnical investigation of the proposed 

Gomde Barrage site to confirm both geotechnical and hydrogeological characteristics of the site.  During 

AMEC's July 2007 site visit, all the proposed trial pits were completed but the three boreholes scheduled to 

address geology and permeability of the underlying strata to the barrage site were abandoned due to very 

unfavourable flooding and soft ground conditions..  Access to the sites was significantly restricted and the 

borehole sites became inaccessible to the drill rigs.  After a number of delays, Goldbelt decided that the 

proposed investigation should be postponed until September 2007, when access to the sites will be available. 

Based on the above, the design parameters for the Gomde Barrage have been assumed and a two option 

approach has been adopted.  The two options include a conservative design approach which allows for the 

construction of a concrete face spillway and a more cost effective option which include an excavated spillway 

channel on the western bank of the embankment.  Optimisation of the barrage design criteria and therefore 

the design of the water retaining structure will be possible once the investigations requested are completed 

and the topographical survey of the site is available. 

8.4.2 Rainfall & Hydrology 

8.4.2.1 General 
The site of the proposed Gomde Barrage is located at approximately 14°23' N with the headwaters of the 

combined upstream contributing area extending below 14°N.  The five rain gauges from which monthly rainfall 

data were made available are well distributed at comparative latitudes.  The stations at Dori and Gorgadji are 

located at latitudes 14°02'N, Djibo at 14°06' N, Baraboule at 14°13' N and Arbinda at 14°14' N.

The coefficient of variation (COV) of the average annual rainfall between these five gauges is 0.045 and thus 

is indicative of there being little variation in annual average rainfall between the locations over the period of 

data collection.   

8.4.2.2 Rainfall Data Variability 
On the basis of calculated summary statistics generated from the monthly rainfall data, it is possible to be 

misled by the coefficients of variation (COV) for monthly rainfall for June to September.  These are very high 

at 0.47-0.63.  These COV's should be viewed in the correct context that they pertain only to the variation in 

rainfall depth during single months from year to year.   

It is much more relevant to view the monthly rainfall data in terms of variations in the cumulative totals over 

the four month period of Jun-Sep as this period contributes, on average, 91% of the annual total rainfall.  Even 

more appropriate is to establish the range of variation in rainfall over the 3 years.  On this basis, the COV for 

cumulative monthly rainfall for Jun-Sep for all 170 sample years is 0.28 and for all of the consecutive 3-year 

periods (168) is 0.23.  Clearly, these COVs are indicative of a better established mean and there not being the 

degree of variability that would be associated with the more drought-prone areas of the Sahel. 

8.4.2.3 Drought Influence 
It is difficult to ascertain the effect that successive dry years would have on the speed with which the reservoir 

fills and on the increase in water volume.  This is because of local disparities between rain gauges.  For 

example, the minimum annual rainfall year across the five gauges of 127.5 mm - recorded at the Gorgadji 

gauge - corresponds with only the 10th lowest annual rainfall at Arbinda, the 5th lowest at Dori, the 3rd lowest 

at Baraboule, but also the lowest at Djibo.   

The year in which this low was recorded (1984) results in an average annual rainfall depth across the 5 

gauges of 248.18 mm.  As a test, the monthly averages across the five gauges for 1984 were used as input to 

the water balance model and, while the reservoir failed to fill to capacity during the initial 3 years, it is likely 

that a fourth successive year using the same monthly rainfall distribution would have led to the reservoir being 

filled to capacity.   

Despite the encouraging results obtained from the water balance model based on the 1984 monthly rainfall 

distributions, the following should be noted. If anomalously dry spells occur in areas of the catchment between 

the site of the proposed Belahouru Gombe reservoir and further upstream where average rainfall conditions 

may ensue, water draining from the upper regions of the catchment may be lost to bed transmission losses 

whilst being routed through the dry river sections.  Testing the implications of such scenarios can only be 

achieved by employing more detailed hydrological modelling. 

8.4.2.4 Rainfall Data 
Rainfall data sourced from hydrological studies undertaken in Burkina Faso were used to prepare an average 

for five meteorological stations located within the same latitude of the Inata project site.  

A literature review suggests that it is reasonable to interpolate between rain gauges when working at the 

aerial extent of the rain gauges considered when they lie within the same latitude bounds as the top and

bottom of the catchment assessed and the for a catchment size like the one for the Gomde Barrage.  This is 

of particular importance given the fact that there is no site specific meteorological information for the Inata 

site.   

Based on the above, the information available for the Djibo, Dori, Gordgadji, Baraboule and Arbinda stations 

has been considered and Table 113 below presents the data used in the preparation of the different scenarios 

considered for the water balance for the Gomde barrage. 

The maximum 24-hour rainfall amounts generally are measured in the full rainy season when monsoon is very 

significant. However, it is not rare that an exceptional quantity is recorded at the beginning or end of the 

season. Since the beginning of measurements until 2004, Arbinda recorded more than 100 mm in 1954 and 

1994, in other words, 40 years after the first measurement. Djibo on the other hand has never recorded a 

single rainfall event of more than 100 mm, and Dori, only a single received one in 1994.

8.4.3 Gomde Barrage Water Balance 

8.4.3.1 General 
Following the revision of the Tailings Management strategy for the Inata Gold Project and the completion of 

the preliminary water balance for the new Slurry Tailings Option, it was decided that the option of lowering the 

proposed Gomde Barrage crest elevation should be investigated. 

The results of the TMF water balance for the slurry option indicate that in the worst case scenario, a 

maximum of approximately 0.9 Mm3 per year will be required as make up water to cover water losses by 

evaporation and tailings water lock up.  Based on these results, the maximum storage capacity estimated for 

the Gomde barrage was considered excessive to cover the total estimated water requirements at 

approximately 4 Mm3 per year and therefore the revision in the proposed Gomde Barrage design is 

proposed. 

8.4.3.2 Water Balance Model Accuracy 
An alternative water balance has been developed for the Inata Gold Project in northern Burkina Faso, 

focussing on a potential barrage site north of the Sona confluence and north of the previously investigated 

Mormosal Site.  As previously, the model has been based on preliminary meteorological, process, 

hydrogeological and topographical data collated by the owners and developed by AMEC.  As such, the model 

provides results suitable for initial planning purposes. 

8.4.3.3 Gomde Barrage Water Balance Parameters 
The preliminary Gomde water balance has been based on the same assumed parameters, summarised 

above, in addition to the following: 

• NASA satellite mapping of the catchment area 

• interpolated contours based on January 2007 river spot elevations and the satellite maps for 

the catchment area 

• assumed runoff factors based on Socrage EIA recommendations 

• assumed hydrogeological parameters - no hydrogeological evaluation of the catchment area 

has been undertaken.  

• the barrage will be constructed during the dry season and completed prior to the first rains.   

• minimum barrage height: 11 m at the center of the river alignment 

• crest elevation: 284 masl 

• emergency spillway elevation: 282.5 masl 

• evapotranspiration from the catchment area obtained from hydrological data recently 

obtained from site

• mine dust suppression water abstraction of approximately 1000 m3/month 

• potable water abreaction for the villages is assumed to be 300 m3/day 

• potable water abstraction for the mine is assumed to be 100 m3/day. 

• The water balance has been developed as follows: 

• 100% rainfall onto the impounded area 

• rainfall runoff from the catchment area with variable run off coefficient) 

• minus evaporation from the river  

• minus evaporation from the impounded area 

• minus village potable water abstraction  

• minus mine potable water abstraction 

• minus dust suppression water 

• minus process water requirements. 

To model the critical start-up phase, the monthly time step for the first three years has been assumed.  The 

volume of the Gomde impoundment and its area of inundation has then been calculated. 

The operational depth of the impounded area is critical to maintain an efficient abstraction operation.  For the 

purposes of this level of study, AMEC has assumed that the minimum operational depth is 3.0 m when 

measured adjacent to the upstream face of the barrage within the existing river alignment (i.e., 276 meters 

above sea level (masl) assuming a crest elevation of 284masl).  The normal operational limit is envisaged to 

be between 276.0 masl to 282.5 masl.  Once the reservoir reaches an elevation of 282.5 masl, excess water 

will be safely discharged downstream via a spillway designed to take the maximum probable storm water 

discharge.  Based on the above analysis, and assuming a minimum freeboard of 1.5 m, the crest elevation for 

the Gomde barrage will be 284 masl.  The actual crest elevation will require to be validated following the final 

topographical survey, hydrological and hydrogeological evaluation of the Gomde catchment area.   

The approximate catchment area for the Gomde with a crest elevation at 284 masl has been estimated at 

approximately 1.78 Mm2.  At full supply level (9.5 m depth) the impounded area for the Gomde barrage is 

estimated to be 4 400 hectares, with an impounded volume of 112.5 Mm3. 

Figure 90 below shows the Gomde barrage depth capacity curve where the storage volume between the level 

base of the river at 273 m and the 280 m elevation has been estimated due to the lack of precise 

topographical information.  The topographical information for the site between the elevations of 280 and 284

It is important to note that the following aspects have not been considered: 

• incident rainfall and run off into the TMF has not been taken into account for water supply 

purposes 

• mining, drinking and process plant water requirements have been assumed and need to be 

confirmed by GBM 

• NO requirement for continuous discharge from the barrage has been included to minimise the 

impact downstream of the barrage site.  This might be a requirement imposed on Goldbelt 

Resources and needs to be investigated. 

8.4.3.4 Average Rainfall Year Simulation 
The preliminary assessment indicates that subject to hydrogeological conditions of the ground around the 

Gomde Barrage site, being investigated, and assuming average year rainfall, the Gomde Barrage could 

provide a relatively secure source of water for the project during normal conditions. 

Assuming average year rainfall conditions following completion of the barrage construction, water storage will 

reach approximately 100 Mm3 at the end of the rainy season and will, depending on average rainfall years for 

every year following, vary between a minimum of 84 Mm3 and a maximum of 112.5 Mm3 (maximum capacity).  

Under the same conditions, water elevation varies between 281.7 and the maximum level of 282.5 masl 

providing sufficient operating depth for the safe and secure pumping of clear water to the plant. 

Water abstraction, including losses for evaporation and estimated seepage amount to just under 20 Mm3 per 

year.

8.4.3.5 Effect of Dry Rainfall Year of Water Availability 
Similarly to the above, other combinations of rainfall years have been analysed to assess the impact of 

minimum rainfall years on the project area.  The results indicate that should a minimum rainfall year occur 

immediately after the completion of the barrage, sufficient water will not be available to supply mine and 

process plant requirements with water levels, not even reaching the predicted minimum operating levels.   

On the other hand, following an average rainfall year, sufficient water storage should be achieved by the 

barrage to provide water supply for the project for a maximum of two consecutive dry years. 

Figure 93 shows the effect on the water volumes within the barrage for an initial dry year (minimum rainfall 

maximum evaporation) followed by average years.  It can be observed that water volumes do not reach the 

minimum and by the end of the dry season, the reservoir would have completely dried up.

Figure 94 shows the effect of two consecutive dry years following an initial average year after construction.  

As indicated above, it can be seen from the graph that sufficient water should be impounded within an 

average year to ensure water supply to the project even if two consecutive dry years occur following the 

average year.  This will be applicable at any stage of the project.

8.4.3.6 Minimum 3 Year Scenario 
The minimum 3 year rainfall scenario presents a recorded worst case scenario from 1971 and thus includes 

the majority of the Sahel drought that lasted from the late 60's to the early 80's.  The simulation includes a 

fixed runoff coefficient at 8% from May to September to correspond to a worst case scenario situation.   

The simulation shows that 25% barrage capacity is achieved after 2 years and only decreases to 12.5% after 

32 months.  As indicated earlier, based on these results it would provide no assurance of a secure water 

source for the project, however, given that the reservoir does not dry up, it could be viewed as a positive and 

acceptable outcome.

8.4.4 Reservoir Siltation 

The Gottschalk equation given in chapter 8 of the EIA generates unrealistic catchment averaged erosion rates 

of 0.2 mm per year.  However, the majority of the literature analysis focuses on North America and Europe 

with no work apparent in low latitudes or Sahelian regions.  This would explain why Gottschalk's empirical 

equation is not consistent with lower latitude regions. 

Average annual sediment delivery from the Santa Clara catchment in California (Mediterranean climate but 

comprised of significant ephemeral tributary catchments) corresponds with a denudation rate of 1.4 mm per 

year.  It is noted that the Santa Clara catchment is characterised by a considerable contribution to the 

suspended load from gully erosion, and very steep and well connected sub-catchments that result in relatively

BS EN ISO 9001:2000 

FS80050 

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 273 of 334 

 

low conveyance losses.  As such, this denudation rate is a reasonable indication of catchment average 

erosion in semi-arid environments where gully erosion is one of the principal mechanisms of erosion. 

An empirical equation was generated by Lahlou (1988) from a study of 16 dammed Moroccan watersheds 

characterised by a number of highly erodible lithologies and including some pre-Saharan and Saharan 

catchments.  By using the original estimation for the Gomde catchment area of 1.78 km2, a catchment 

averaged denudation rate of 1.22 mm per year is returned, corresponding to a projected annual sediment 

delivery to the Gomde reservoir 2 171 600 m3 per year.  This value represents 1.93 % of the reservoirs 

effective maximum capacity (assuming a surface water level of 282.5 masl).   

Furthermore, generalised relationships from Walling and Kleo (1979) give a global range of denudation, 

based on annual precipitation and runoff parameters, of 0.5 mm per year and 1 mm per year.  This represents 

sediment volumes delivered to the Gomde reservoir of 890 000 and 2 136 000 m3 per year (between 0.8 and 

1.9 % of the maximum storage capacity of the Gomde reservoir). 

On the basis of the above information it is probable that the sedimentation rates quoted above are reasonable 

approximations of projected rates for the Gomde Reservoir resulting in a maximum projected loss of reservoir 

storage volume of some 1.5 Mm3 or just over 13% during the projected life of the mine.  Although this is high, 

it is considered acceptable with the risk of significantly higher sedimentation rates, likely to cause water 

supply problems during the life of the project, being low. 

These rates, however, can only be confirmed by a period of sediment transport monitoring in conjunction with 

the use of hydrological models and existing empirical models. 

8.4.5 Flood Hydrographs 

Flood routing through the reservoir was calculated applying the Modified Puls method using the basic broad 

crested weir equation combined with knowledge of the reservoir storage/elevation head relationship derived 

from the water balance model.  Outflow from the reservoir was based on the range of elevation heads 

between 282.5 and 284.0 masl for the 500 m long weir crest used as the bade design option, now spillway 

option 2.. 

Specification of the inflow hydrograph was difficult given that no river discharge or catchment elevation data 

could be specified.  Moreover, a thorough search of publicly available literature failed to yield any comparable 

studies.  Equations do exist whereby peak discharge and travel time can be calculated using maximum hourly 

intensity, the runoff coefficient and catchment area.  However, such is the size of the Gomde catchment, it 

would be unreasonable to assume that the maximum hourly intensity and a uniform runoff coefficient would 

apply throughout the whole catchment during an extreme event. 

As such, inflow hydrographs have not been calculated and the peak flood volumes used for the design of the 

barrage spillway structure is based purely on site observations and measuments of the erosion channel at the 

Gomde site.  An erosion channel some 500 m wide and 1.5 m deep was observed and these dimensions

were used to size the spillway required.  Based on the above, the estimated spillway capacity required for the 

Gomde Barrage spillway is 950 m3 per second. 

Given the uncertainty associated with the inflow hydrograph and the predicted peak surface water elevations, 

it is recommended that more detailed hydrological modelling in is undertaken in order to more accurately 

determine the extreme event inflow hydrograph, and thus to validate the proposed dam specifications and, if 

necessary, identify any required design modifications. 

8.4.6 General Description of the Gomde Barrage 

8.4.6.1 General 
The site is located some 16.0 Km north east of the Inata plant site location and 5.0 Km downstream of the 

proposed Mormossal Barrage site as described in the pre Feasibility Study. 

Two options have been considered for the development of the barrage.  The reason for the inclusion of the 

two options is due to the fact that the topographical and geotechnical characteristics of the proposed Gomde 

site have not been confirmed with sufficient detail to ensure the feasibility of the proposed poreferred option 

and therefore an alternative design has been considered that is sufficiently robust to ensure its feasibility 

regardless of the topographical and geotechnical characteristics of the site. 

The two options are similar in principle with a barrage formed by an earthfill / rockfill embankment to the 284 

masl elevation and provided with a spillway facility designed based on site observations of the existing river 

channel dimensions. 

Option 1, the preferred option, considers the excavation of a side channel on the western flank of the barrage 

embankment for the creation of the spillway structure.  The spillway channel, including the approach and 

discharge channels will be excavated into natural ground and the excavated material will be used for the 

construction of the barrage embankment. 

Option 2, assuming that option 1 is not feasible, includes the construction of a spillway structure on the 

embankment along the river alignment.  The construction of such structure will require the provision of 

significant erosion protection measures for the barrage which makes this option significantly more expensive 

that the preferred option although it also makes it independent of the topographical and geotechnical 

characteristics of the site. 

The barrage will comprise generally of the following elements: 

• structural rockfill/earthfill embankment 2 830 m long 

• downstream monitoring and seepage return boreholes 

• 4.0 m wide crest elevation suitable for equipment access 

• key in trench under the embankment and filled with compacted rockfill

• protective rip rap on the upstream and downstream faces 

• seepage interception toe drains 

• decant facilities located near the embankment. 

The general arrangements for these components are shown on the drawings. 

The topography of the Gomde Barrage area is relatively flat rising from approximately 273 masl in the centre 

of the river valley to approximately 286 masl.  The valley forms a relatively steep gulley between the 

elevations of 273 and 280 masl with a gentle slope from the 280 masl elevation. 

The regional topography forms a catchment area equivalent to that identified for the Mormossal Barrage site 

investigated for the pre feasibility study.  The total catchment area was estimated at 2.5 Mm2 considering a 

crest elevation of 286 masl.  Originally a barrage at the Gomde site was considered to the same elevation and 

calculations were completed using the same catchment area.  Subsequently, a reduction in the elevation of 

the proposed barrage elevation has been introduced to 284 masl and consequently the catchment area has 

been reduced to a conservative 1.78 Mm2. 

The predominant vegetation within the site is generally low shrub with occasional trees present, although 

vegetation tends to be slightly denser at the bottom of the river valley.  Similarly to the TMF site, no good 

quality agricultural topsoil is present with the upper layers being formed generally by a sequence of strata 

including firm light brown/reddish clayey fine sands with occasional sub angular to semi rounded gravel 

overlying firm reddish brown very fine sandy clay with frequent sub angular to semi rounded black gravel 

grading to competent lateritic strata.   

Due to the limitations of the site investigation undertaken during July 2007, no boreholes have been 

completed on the site of the barrage with the site investigation activities completed to date being limited to the 

excavation of some trial pits to an approximate depth of 10 mbgl.  The trial pits, excavated along the line of 

the embankment, encountered competent lateritic material extending to depth as the predominant foundation 

material in the area. 

8.4.6.2 Embankment Cross Section  
The brief seismic hazard assessment suggests that the design operating base earthquake (OBE) will be 

0.20 g.  The site is within an area of medium to low seismic activity.  However, the number of potential active 

faults close to the site, are currently unknown and the potential for local seismic activity should be not be 

ignored.  For this reason, a rigorous assessment of the barrage has been adopted.   

The structural fill material utilised for the main embankment sections should be resistant to the loss of shear 

strength under the design seismic event.  Consequently careful selection of the cross section, fill materials 

and their parameters has been undertaken.

The above consideration is also influenced by the lack of firm geotechnical information to date.  Geotechnical 

testing is currently underway for the samples of foundation materials obtained during the July 2007 visit.  

Once this geotechnical characterisation is completed, a review of the proposed embankment cross section 

will be possible with the objective of minimising the volumes of rockfill required for construction.   

The embankment will be formed by a compacted earthfill / rockfill dam approximately 11.0 m high with slopes 

of 1 V to 3 H on both the downstream and upstream sides.  The embankment will have a crest some 4.0 m 

wide minimum to allow for traffic of small construction equipment. 

The construction programme should be planned such that the embankment is completed before the months 

of April to take full benefit of favourable access conditions during the dry season and that the storage of water 

during the rainy season (May to September) is maximised prior to the operations start up. 

8.4.6.3 Spillway Design 
The barrage will be constructed with a spillway capable of safely discharging excess water during extreme 

rainfall events.  Site observations have indicated that the required discharge capacity for the spillway could 

reach 941 m3 per second and therefore the spillway options have been design to accommodate this 

discharge level. 

As indicated above, two options of the spillway design have been included as follows: 

Option 1 

The spillway will be formed by a 200 m wide, 2.0 m deep channel located on the western flank of the barrage 

embankment with an invert level at 282.0 masl but with the inclusion of a sacrificial embankment with an 

invert level at 282.5 masl.  The spillway will be protected from erosion by the construction of grouted gabions 

on the entire base and side slopes. 

The approach and discharge channels will be excavated into natural ground and the resulting spoil will be 

used for the construction of the embankment.  It has been estimated that approximately 360 000 m3 of 

excavation will be required providing sufficient material for the construction. The approach and discharge 

channels will be provided with erosion protection in the form of gabions.  Grouting for this gabions has not 

been included and the integrity of the protection will have to be reassessed once the first discharge event has 

occurred.  

Option 2 

The spillway structure will be approximately 500 m wide with an invert level at 282.5 masl elevation.  This 

results in a spillway 1.5 m in depth capable of discharging some 941 m3 per second at full head. 

The upstream and downstream faces of the spillway section, relatively in the centre of the barrage, will be 

protected by a slab of reinforced concrete with tie backs into the rockfill embankment at 1.0 m centres.

Similarly, the crest of the spillway will be protected by a reinforced concrete slab to ensure erosion of the 

embankment during water discharge does not occur.  The crest of the spillway area will have a width of 

approximately 18.0 m with a transition from the spillway crest to the embankment crest at a slope of 1 V to 10 

H in order to allow access for small vehicles. 

8.4.6.4 Ancillary Structures 
In order to ensure the appropriate performance and long tern stability of the barrage, a number of ancillary 

structures have been included in the design.  These are briefly described in the following sections. 

Cut Trench 

This structure will only be required if Option 2 of the barrage design is adopted. 

A cut trench will be excavated and fill with structural compacted rockfill under the spillway section of the 

barrage.  It is envisaged that the trench will be a minimum of 4.0 m deep although the precise dimensions and 

extension of the cut trench will be confirmed once the results of the geotechnical and hydrogeological 

investigations for the site are available. 

Details of the characteristics of the structure are shown in the details drawing for the Gomde Barrage. 

Key Trench 

This structure will be required for both options of the barrage design.  In case of Option 1 being adopted, the 

key trench will extend the full length of the embankment.  If Option 2 is adopted, the section under the 

spillway will include the Cut trench and therefore the key trench will not be required. 

Similarly to the cut trench, a key trench 1.0 m deep has been planned for the section of the barraged which is 

not under the spillway structure.  The dimensions and extension of this key trench will be confirmed following 

completion of the geotechnical studies for the site and construction materials. 

Details of the characteristics of the structure are shown in the details drawing for the Gomde Barrage. 

Downstream Longitudinal Drain 

This drain will be required for both options of the barrage design. 

A toe drain will be provided near the toe of the barrage.  The objective of the drain installation is to reduce the 

elevation of the phreatic surface likely to form within the embankment. 

The drain will be located a minimum of 5.0 m upstream of the toe and will be formed by a perforated HDPE 

pipe surrounded by selected gravel and protected by a suitable geotextile fabric to minimise the risk of 

clogging and blocking of the drain. 

Finger discharge drains will also be provided, discharging the seepage to the downstream of the barrage.

Energy Dissipator 

An energy dissipator structure will be required for both options of the barrage design, located at the toe of the 

spillway.  The characteristics of the structure however differ with a minimised requirement included for option 

1 due to the lower velocities that the discharged flow will reach and therefore the lower energy load needing 

to be dissipated. 

In the case of option 1, the energy dissipator will be formed by reinforced grouted gavios constructed across 

the full width of the spillway. 

For option 2, a reinforced concrete energy dissipator structure will be constructed at the downstream toe of 

the barrage, on the 500 m wide section of the spillway.   

The purpose of the energy dissipater is to protect the toe of the spillway during period of water discharge to 

ensure the integrity of the toe in the long term. 

Details of the characteristics of the structure are shown in the details drawing for the Gomde Barrage. 

Protective Rockfill Gabions 

In order to minimise the risk of erosion in case of discharge via the spillway, gabions will be provided at 

different points of the barraged depending on the option adopted. 

For option 1, gabions will be provided to protect the approach and discharge channels of the spillway.  If 

required, the gabions will be groutrd for additional resistance to erosion. 

For Option 2, gabions will be constructed upstream of the toe of the spillway on the river base.  The objective 

of this protective structure is primarily to protect the integrity of the reinforced concrete slab forming the 

upstream face of the spillway.  The gabions will also facilitate the dredging of silt in the immediate vicinity of 

the barrage should this became a problem in the later years of operation of the facility. 

Gabions will also be provided downstream of the energy dissipater on the downstream side of the barrage to 

protect the river bed from erosion which could compromise the stability and integrity of the energy dissipater 

structure 

Details of the characteristics of the structure are shown in the details drawing for the Gomde Barrage. 

Protective Rip Rap 

Protective Rip Rap will be constructed on the upstream face of the barrage to protect the rockfill embankment 

from erosion by the action of the water.  The protective rip rap will cover the entire upstream face except for 

the section of the spillway. 

Details of the characteristics of the structure are shown in the details drawing for the Gomde Barrage.

Sacrificial Spillway Embankment 

A 500 mm sacrificial (erodable) embankment will be constructed on the alignment of the spillway channel for 

option 1.  The spillway will be constructed 2.0 m deep with an invert elevation at 282.0 masl.  This will allow 

the channel to have the required capacity with a reduced width and therefore minimise the required 

excavation without compromising the barrage integrity in case of an extreme rainfall event. 

The erodable embankment will allow the maximum water level within the barrage to reach 282.5 masl and 

therefore allow the barrage to realise its maximum planned storage capacity.  In the case of a mayor rainfall 

event, water will be discharged above the 282.5 masl elevation and the sacrificial embankment will be eroded 

gradually to ensure sufficient discharge of water occurs to ensure barrage integrity. 

8.4.7 Gomde Barrage Stability Analysis 

Two options are being considered for the design of the spillway of the proposed Gomde Barrage.  The 

preferred option has not been confirmed to date due to the lack of reliable topographic information and 

therefore the stability analysis has been undertaken for the two options considered. 

As indicated and described earlier, the preferred option includes a spillway channel constructed on the west 

flank of the barrage.  This makes the centre line of the proposed barrage and the highest point of the 

embankment the critical section and this is what has been modelled to ensure the long term stability of the 

barrage embankment. 

Option 2 however considers a reinforced concrete face spillway covering a width of 500 m on the centre of the 

barrage embankment providing significant additional strength to the lope.  The critical section, therefore, is 

considered to be the section immediately to the west of the spillway and this has been considered for the 

model. 

 The Gomde Barrage embankment is designed for both static and dynamic loads worst case loading 

conditions.  The primary consideration is to ensure that the embankment exhibits an appropriate factor of 

safety with respect to stability under the assumed range of loading conditions. 

8.4.7.1 Stability Design Parameters 
The safety factor of a slope is defined as the ratio of shear strength to the shear stress required to maintain 

the slope in equilibrium.  According to the Finnish "Dam Safety Code of Practice", the total factor of safety of 

dams in a constant seepage flow should be at least 1.5.   Under a dynamic load, the slope should not exhibit 

a factor of safety less than unity. 

The stability analysis design values derived from the preliminary seismic hazard assessment for the Inata site 

are summarised in Table 105.

The geotechnical parameters used for the stability analyses are summarised in Table 2.3 for all materials 

modelled using the Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion.  The parameters adopted are estimated and 

confirmation of these parameters should be sought prior to the detailed design stage. 

The stability analysis was undertaken on a section of the barrage that is not the highest section.  As indicated 

earlier, the barrage will be provided with a 500 m wide reinforced concrete faced spillway structure.  The 

effects of the reinforced concrete face on the stability of the embankment are significant and beneficial and 

therefore, the critical section of the barrage embankment is that immediately to the west of the spillway. 

The section considered is the highest section of the embankment where no reinforced concrete is available. 

An estimated phreatic surface has been incorporated to include the effects of this factor into the analysis 

although a more detailed seepage analysis will be required once the materials testing programme has been 

completed. 

8.4.7.2 Stability Analysis Results 

The stability analyses of the Gomde Barrage embankment has been carried out using SLOPE/W, a limit 

equilibrium based commercial software package developed and marketed by Geoslope International of 

Canada.  The factors of safety against sliding were calculated using Morgenstern-Price method.   

The results of the analysis for the barrage are summarised in Table 114 Stability Analysis – Gomde Barrage 

Critical Section below and shown diagrammatically in Drawing Nos. 5879000205-106 and 5879000205-107. 

It is important to note that a rapid drawdown situation has not been considered for the modelling of the 

upstream face.  Rapid drawdown conditions occur when a rapid discharge of water from the reservoir results 

in the upstream face of the embankment losing the support provided by the water but retains a high phreatic 

surface (saturated rockfill) which could lead to embankment stability. 

The operation of the Gomde Barrage does not include the facilities to generate such rapid discharge of water 

from the reservoir and therefore it is expected that the phreatic level within the embankment will be allowed to 

adjust gradually as the water is pumped out of the reservoir.  Based on this, a stability analysis under these 

conditions has not been included.

8.4.8 Closure 

The life of mine for the Inata Gold Project is estimated at seven years.  The construction of the Gomde 

Barrage is required to ensure water supply to the project during the operational and closure period. 

Following decommissioning of the mining and processing operations and subsequent closure of the site, it is 

expected that the barrage will be transferred to either local or national authorities in Burkina Faso for the 

continued operation of the Gomde Barrage to provide water for the local population, animal grazing and 

agricultural activities in the area. 

No closure cost provisions should therefore be required. 

8.4.9 Bill of Quantities and Cost Estimation 

As a result of the provision for two options of the barrage spillway and therefore embankment structure, two 

options for the constructions quantities and costs have been prepared.  The estimated quantities for both 

options of the Gomde Barrage are included in detail in Appendices F1 (option 1) and F2 (option 2).  The costs 

include an estimation of the construction quantities for the two options assessed based on the information 

available to date for the cost of items and materials. 

The cost estimation includes the following elements: 

• General Items, including insurances mobilisation and demobilisation of contractors; 

• Quality control, including supervision of construction and geotechnical testing; 

• Site clearance, including excavation of the embankment footprint to competent foundations; 

• Ancillary structures, including erosion protection and energy dissipaters; 

• Embankment construction assuming materials are sourced from the excavation of the 

approach and discharge spillway channel for option 1 and from borrow areas in the vicinity of 

the barrage site for option 2. 

• Return water system 

• Decant floating pontoon; 

• Other sundry equipment and installations. 

The cost estimation is based on the assumption of a facility design for a maximum storage of some 112.5 

Mm3 of water.

8.5 Airstrip 

8.5.1 General 

In order to facilitate personnel and critical spare parts movement to and from the project area, Goldbelt has 

decided to include in the planning stage of the project, the construction of an appropriate airstrip for fix wing 

aircrafts. 

It is not known at this stage the type of aircraft that will use this facility and therefore assumptions have been 

made to determine take off and landing strip lengths.  The estimations are based on the use of 2 types of 

aircraft as follows: 

• LearJet 60 XR for executive travel, and 

• Cessna Grand Caravan capable of a mixed passenger / cargo configuration 

The proposed design for the airstrip is therefore based on the geometrical requirements of these aircraft. 

8.5.2 Wind 

As indicated above, the dry season is longer than the wet season.  This makes it possible to discern a more 

marked influence of the harmattan than that of the monsoon on the area.  The average wind speeds are 

about 1 to 3 m/s, but transient speed maxima of up to 15 m/s are observed during rain-storm events. 

Thus, under the harmattan, wind speeds from 8 to 10 m/s can sometimes be observed. This contributes 

generally to dust-storm generation in the period from November to March. 

Figure 97  Dori Synoptic Station: Wind roses 
 

 

 

 

 

Based on the above, it can be seen that wind directions are distributed across the spectrum with NE, SW, S 

and SW being predominant although 40% of the time corresponds to calm wind conditions. 

The orientation of the airstrip can not therefore be defined to satisfy the guideline of "take off against the wind" 

and therefore has been instead located based on the most appropriate topographical conditions   

Table 115 below presents wind speed information for the Dori station which is assumed to present similar 

conditions to those on the project site.  Maximum wind speed does not exceed 2.5 m/s (9 Km/h) and therefore 

it is not expected that winds, either in the direction of landing and take off, or cross winds will present any 

problems for aircraft operations.

It is recommended however that minimum instrumentation is installed on site to allow the measurement of 

wind speed and communication equipment to communicate ground conditions to approaching aircrafts is also 

available.

8.5.3 Location and Layout 

Drawing number 5879000205-001 shows the proposed location of the airstrip on the general arrangement 

plan for the site and Drawing No 5879000205-201 shows the existing topography in the area. 

The proposed airstrip has been located approximately 1500 m of the proposed residential camp, hidden 

behind a bank of low trees.  The proposed location was identified and reviewed during a site visit undertaken 

by AMEC during 2006. 

The runway will be some 20 m wide and 2000 m long to allow for the opration of the aircraft assumed to be 

used by the project.  In addition to the above, a 10m runway strip will be required either side of the runway 

and full clearance of this strip will also be required. 

A 40 m by 40 m loading and turning area will be fully cleared and prepared on the northern extreme of runway 

to be nearest to the access road (adjacent to Option A and close to Option B) 

The proposed site is free draining with the topography gently sloping towards the south and west although 

some minor water diversion and side drains will be required. 

Photograph 4.1 below presents a general view of the site.  The photograph was taken during the site visit at 

point 158900N, 684500E loking east over the proposed route of the airstrip.

Figure 98  158900N, 684500 E looking east. 

 

The ground is underlain by lateritic material and is it expected that minimum preparation, clearing and 

moisture conditioning and compacting will be required to achieve a surface which is suitable for aircraft 

operation. 

The air strip alignment will be close (within 2 km) to the proposed residential area and limits with the proposed 

access road Option A being sufficiently close to the access road Option B to allow for access to earthmoving 

equipment for repairs and maintenance of the runway as well as to permit loading and unloading of 

passengers and cargo. 

8.5.4 Ground Works 

8.5.4.1 Site clearance 

Clearance of the runway and the runway strip area will be undertaken prior to the surface conditioning to 

achieve a suitable surface for landing and take off.  Full clearance will be required on this area. 

The site inspection showed that there are no natural obstacles that could jeopardise landing, take off or fly 

over safety for aircrafts.  A further inspection of the site using topographical equipment will be required to 

confirm this.   

Drawing number 5879000205-202 shows the clearance requirements for both the approach and take off 

areas and the fly over areas either side of the runway strip. 

8.5.4.2 Surface Preparation 

Preparation and conditioning of the surface will be required for both the runway area and the runway strip 

area as shown in drawing No. 5879000205-202. 

Preparation and conditioning will generally comprise of the following elements: 

• Identification and stripping of any unsuitable materials in the area 

• Replacement of the materials removed with approved lateritic material placed in 300 mm layers 

and compacted to a minimum of 85% of the optimum compaction

• Grading of the surface  

• Ripping of the top 300 mm layer on the entire surface 

• Raking of the surface to eliminate big particles  

• Moisture conditioning to achieve optimal moisture content for compaction 

• Compaction of the surface using an appropriate smooth roller compactor to achieve a minimum 

of 85% of the optimal density. 

After work has been completed, the entire surface of both the runway and the runway strip areas will be 

inspected and any area found to contain loose material or loose particles above 10 mm in diameter will be 

retreated. 

8.5.4.3 Drainage  

As seen on drawing No. 5879000205-201, the natural drainage of the area will generally have the same 

orientation as the runway.  However to ensure that no excessive water is accumulated on the runway, 500 

mm high berms will be constructed along the edge of the runway strip area. 

In addition, a drainage channel will be excavated along the edge of the runway strip area and the resulting 

spoil will be use to form the berm described above.  Discharge from the drains will be directed away for the 

runway and the runway strip area. 

Drawing 5879000205-202 presents the specifications for the clearance areas both in plan and section.  These 

requirements are based on the assumed aircraft to be use by Goldbelt. 

8.5.5 Instrumentation and Equipment 

As indicated earlier, minimum equipment for the measurement and communication of wind and ground 

conditions should be installed at the airstrip to ensure he safe operation of aircraft, in particular approach and 

landing operations. 

Depending on the characteristics of the site, wind measurement could be restricted to a wind sock.  For the 

purposes of this study, it has been assumed that two wind socks will be installed.  One will be installed at the 

head of the runway such that it can be visually inspected by pilots prior to take off so the optimal take off 

direction can be decided as well as being available for inspection by fly over prior to landing should the plot 

chooses to do so. 

An additional wind sock will be installed at the residential village where it is expected that the communication 

equipment will be installed.  This would allow the inspection of wind conditions by ground personnel and allow 

the communication of these conditions to the pilot prior to approach and landing. 

Runway markings are not expected to be required and have been assumed that they will not be included.  

It has been assumed that the airstrip will only be used for day operations and therefore no allowance for 

lightning has been made.

8.5.6 Bill of Quantities and Cost Estimation 

The bill of quantities for the construction of the airstrip has been prepared based on the above assumptions 

and the topography derived from satellite images for the proposed site.  A more detailed topographical survey 

of the site will have to be completed during the detail design stage in order to provide a more robust cost 

estimation. 

The main elements of the bill of quantities for the airstrip and therefore the main elements of cost include the 

following: 

Site Access The proposed access road passes next to the end of the runway and therefore no 

additional access road will be required.   

Site Clearance Full clearance of the runway and runway strip areas will be required.  Fly over areas 

will have to be clear of above ground obstacles as indicated in the specifications. 

Ground Replacement A detailed inspection of the final location of the airstrip has not been undertaken and 

therefore no detail information exists on the requirement for materials excavation and 

replacement.  It as been assumed based on site observation that 10% of the area will 

require materials replacements to a depth of 1.0 m and quantities have been 

estimated accordingly. 

Ground Works It is envisaged that, due to the characteristics of the materials on the surface of the 

area selected, ground works required to form a suitable surface for aircraft operation 

will be limited to ripping of the surface, grading, moisture conditioning and 

compacting.  These will be required both in the runway area and the runway strip 

area. 

Instrumentation An allowance has been made for the provision of wind socks and communications 

equipment. 

Table 116 below presents a summary of the bill of quantities and cost estimation

8.6 Access Road 

8.6.1 General 

An all weather access road alignment to the project site has been identified.  Drawing No. 5879000205-001 

shows the general site layout and presents access road. 

The alignment of the road has been designed to maximise the running of the road over higher elevations of 

the terrain as identified in the available topographic maps.  Stream crossings have been identified and 

avoided where possible in order to ensure that requirements for crossings are kept to a minimum and 

therefore construction and maintenance costs are minimised. 

The alignment was inspected by AMEC during a site visit January 2007.  The findings of the site visit were 

reported to Goldbelt in a letter report dated February 2007 and discussed in detail below.   

An alternative alignment was also considered, but the option presented an area of crossing over the Sona 

River some 800 m long as reported by AMEC in the letter report dated February 2007.  This area was further 

inspected during the July 2007 site visit and was found to be completely inundated and, therefore, it will 

require a crossing structure that allows for continuous operation of the road as well as drainage of the water 

from the significant catchment area upstream of this point.  A preliminary estimation of the characteristics of 

such structure and the construction costs was undertaken and, based on the high costs and technical 

uncertainty, it has been decided that this option would not be considered any further.

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 289 of 334 

 

The road alignment has considered the potential disruption to the local villages and the risk of local traffic 

using the road.  In order to avoid both, the road has been aligned as far as possible away from the villages 

and a controlled access system will be required to avoid unwanted access. 

The alignment of the road will require the clearing of bushes, grading of the surface and construction of a 

rolling surface and edge drains to ensure all year trafficability. 

8.6.2 Road Alignment 

The access road (Option A – Western Access Road) was reviewed by driving along its full length from the 

Inata site to the intersection with the Tongomayel – Belehede road.  A summary of the observations as well 

as a detailed description of the route main features is presented as Appendix G. 

The alignment was generally easy to traverse.  With the exception of a 10 m wide channel at 1572970N, 

675005E, no major water management control structures are envisaged.  The alignment of the access road 

will require to be surveyed to optimise its final route and to accurately locate French crossings and culverts.   

8.6.3 Ground Works 

8.6.3.1 Road Section 
The proposed access road will be approximately 6.0 m wide protected with a 150 mm thick lateritic gravel 

wearing course.  The sides of the road will be cleared and drains will be formed to promote the rapid 

dissipation of rainfall water.  Beyond the drains, a side protection berm will be formed with the material 

excavated from the drains. 

Every 100 m, Mitres will be formed from the side drains to allow the water to be discharged into the bush and 

minimise the risk of road erosion or saturation.  The Mitres would be extensions of the side drains and would 

have the same characteristics.   

8.6.3.2 Alignment Clearance 
The proposed access road to the Inata project will be approximately 6.0 m wide.  In addition to the traffic 

surface, side drains will be required which, depending on the material in the area will require the clearance of 

between 2.0 and 4.0 m either side of the road.   

When the road is founded on lateritic materials, the side drains will require the clearance of a minimum of 2.0 

m either side of the road.  When the foundation of the road is on sandy materials, deeper side drains will be 

required and therefore the road will required clearance of at least 4.0 m either side. 

Drawing No. 5879000205-203 shows the typical details  

8.6.3.3 Road Grading and Surfacing 
The in situ foundation material characteristics suggest that the natural colluvium can be re-compacted as a 

subgrade provided sufficient side drainage is provided to ensure the rapid dissipation of incident rainfall.

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 290 of 334 

 

The road alignment has been planned to minimise the areas where flat sections of road will allow the ponding 

of incident rainfall.  In addition to this, and to ensure the rapid and effective drainage of the road surface, the 

road will be graded to slope at 1V to 60H perpendicular to the road alignment. 

To ensure all year trafficability, the surface of the road will be protected with a minimum 150 mm thick lateritic 

gravel wearing course.  Where lateritic gravel is evident on the surface, the importation of a gravel wearing 

course may not be required.  Depending on the results of the proposed GSI, sufficient lateritic gravel borrow 

source may be available along the route within a 2 km haul distance of the road alignment. 

The alignment is away from flood plains and will not be degraded during wet conditions due to low bearing 

capacity of saturated foundation soils.  

8.6.3.4 Stream Crossings 
The road alignment runs along the higher elevations of the terrain such that it will not be prone to flooding.  

Four (4) potential stream crossings have been identified for this option although all of them will require minor 

works. 

The crossings required will be provided with "French Crossings", a sloped reinforced concrete sections that 

allows for that section of the road to be inundated by passing water, allowing at the same time for traffic of 

vehicles through a shallow stream of water.   

Details of the proposed crossing structure are presented in Drawing No. 5879000205-203. 

8.6.4 Bill of Quantities and Costs 

The bill of quantities for the construction of the access road has been prepared based on the above 

assumptions and the topography derived from satellite images for the proposed site and road alignment.  It is 

envisaged that no detail design will be undertaken for the access road but a contract will be let for design and 

build of the access road in sections from the intersection with the main road to the Inata site. 

The main elements of the bill of quantities for the access road and therefore the main elements of cost include 

the following: 

Site Access It is envisaged that access to the site will continue to be via the existing roads and 

paths until the new road in completed.  The road will be commenced from the 

intersection with the main road and therefore no site access will be required. 

Site Clearance Full clearance of the road width and the sides to enable the construction of the 

drainage channels and the protecting berm will be required.  Some clearance of 

borrow areas may be required along the length of the road. 

Ground Replacement The inspection of the road alignment has not identified any significant areas where 

ground replacement will be required.  In order to have an allowance for the

replacement of materials where require, a contingency will be included in the bill of 

quantities. 

Ground Works It is envisaged that, due to the characteristics of the materials on the surface of the 

area selected, ground works required to form a suitable surface for heavy all year 

operation will be limited to ripping of the surface, grading, moisture conditioning and 

compacting.  It has been assumed that 50% of the road length will require the 

importation and placement of a lateritic gravel wearing course. 

Drainage Features It is envisaged that the side drains, side protection berms and drainage Mitres will be 

achieved by dozer or grader.  No allowance has been made for excavation and re-

placement of the materials. 

Stream Crossings A total of 4 "French crossings" have been allowed for in the BoQ.  Two additional 

concrete boxed culverts have also been allowed for.  The culverts will provide 

crossing in an area identified during the route inspection which corresponds to a 10 

m wide erosion gulley some 2.5 m deep.

SECTION 9 -  MANPOWER 

9.1 Overview 

9.1.1 Introduction 

The remote location of the Inata Gold Project dictates certain additional requirements to ensure that the plant 

is largely self sufficient and utilises local resources as much as possible, especially in terms of manpower. 

Goldbelt Resources intends to employ selected personnel with specific remote location operational 

experience as well as to recruit and train people from the local community. It is envisaged that some of the 

site construction crew will be retained in operational roles once the mine is operational in order to provide a 

solid background and understanding of the facility. 

 

9.2 Recruitment and Training 

9.2.1 Overview 

To ensure that all positions are filled in accordance with the implementation schedule, Goldbelt Resources will 

start a recruitment campaign prior to commencement of construction. Advertised positions will state the 

required qualifications and level of experience for each position. A rigorous screening process will be 

implemented to ensure appropriate personnel are employed. 

Positions requiring select or specific skills not readily available within Burkina Faso will be filled by 

expatriates. Expatriates will be expected to support the Company's training and development programmes 

and to ensure transfer of special skills and knowledge as a priority. It is expected that as the knowledge base 

increases more local personnel will fill more senior and supervisory positions. 

9.2.2 Employment Policy 

Goldbelt Resources intends to employ a capable workforce and as such will provide attractive salary 

packages in line with other mines operating in Burkina Faso. Each employee will have their own 

accommodation in the camp that is located 7 km from the plant site.  

Expatriate staff will receive additional assistance in terms of a fly in/fly out service. 

9.2.3 Recruitment Sequence 

The following outlines the sequence for recruitment.  

A General Manager will be employed at the design stage to incorporate personal operational preferences to 

the design of the plant. It is important that the General Manager fully understands how the plant will operate 

and has input into the design and construction. 

Department Managers will be employed during the initial stages of construction to ensure the necessary flow 

down of knowledge about the design and construction of the plant. 



 

 Bankable Feasibility Study – 0287-BFS-001
 

 
BS EN ISO 9001:2000 

FS80050 

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 293 of 334 

 

Unskilled staff will be drawn from the local community and used in the construction of the plant and facilities. It 

is intended to continue to employ staff that show potential for working in the operation of the plant. This 

provides a continuation of the knowledge base and will streamline plant operations. 

Further key operating staff will be employed at the commissioning stage of the project. This enables staff to 

learn how the plant and mining operation will function, and to witness trouble shooting techniques. 

Plant operators, maintenances personnel, mining operators and engineers, and administration staff will be 

employed as required as the mine ramps up to full operation. 

9.2.4 Expatriate Staff 

Expatriate staff will be required to work and train local personnel. Pre-employment aptitude tests and 

specialised selection testing will be conducted to ensure that expatriate staff have the necessary ability and 

willingness to do this, as well as to live and work in a remote part of a third world country. 

An estimate 32 expatriate positions will be required in the initial period of the project, or 12% of the total 

workforce.  

9.2.5 Local Staff 

Positions will be advertised nationally for senior and junior positions. Preference will be given to people living 

in the local community as it is more likely that they will settle more quickly and be more inclined to remain as 

long term employees. 

Local candidates for senior positions will be subjected to selection testing in literacy, numeracy and practical 

skills and knowledge.  

It is likely that junior positions will be filled by people aged 18 to 26 years old, with some level of education 

and vocational training. 

9.2.6 Manning Build-up 

It is critical that all employees are familiar with the operational, management and safety procedures of the 

mine and plant prior to start up. Expatriate and key senior local staff will be employed at a sufficiently early 

stage of the project to ensure that these requirements are met. It is intended that these staff will be employed 

prior to commissioning and take an active role in the commissioning and start up of the plant and mining 

operation. 

9.2.7 Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental Training 

Goldbelt Resources Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental (OHSE) policies will be implemented on 

the mine and plant sites. Appropriate training will be given to all staff, including site inductions and site 

specific safety training. Gold processing plants and mining operations utilise a wide variety of machinery and 

chemicals and the health, safety and environmental implications of working in this environment will be 

addressed. 

Goldbelt Resources policy will ensure that:

H:\Projects\0287 Goldbelt - BFS Belahouro Project\4 - Engineering\4.10 Reports (General)\0287-BFS-001 Rev 0.doc Page 294 of 334 

 

• Compliance with statutory regulations is maintained by continually reviewing and implementing OHSE 

procedures and guidelines. 

• Health, safety and environmental  hazards are mitigated by implementing risk analysis procedure for 

all processes. 

• Staff are suitably employed to deal with the mining and processing environments. 

• All staff are provided with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  

• All staff are provided with ongoing health, safety and environment training. 

• All staff are trained in Emergency Response procedures, according to a ER Policy document  

• Contracting company policies align with Goldbelt Resources policies. 

• The medical facility is always available and prepared for accidents and incidents. 

9.2.8 Job Training 

Agriculture and farming is the predominant employer in this region of Burkina Faso. As such there is a 

shortage of skilled labour available. It is therefore intended that a team of expatriate staff will be employed 

initially and used to train local staff. 

The initial training programme will consist of a basic skills component focused on HSE practices, and  basic 

hand and power tool use (plant and maintenance personnel) and basic operation of mine mobile equipment 

(mining operators). 

Maintenance personnel will be seconded to the construction and commissioning workforce to become familiar 

with the equipment and operations of the plant.  

It is essential that training and education are key parts of employment on site, particular at start up when most 

employees will still be undergoing training or are new to the job.  

9.2.9 Skills Development 

Staff will be required to participate in ongoing skills development programmes. These programmes will be 

designed to increase the efficiency of the workforce and allow employees to initiate new systems. 

9.2.10 General Training 

General basic training will be provided for staff. This will include computer, clerical, warehousing, supervisory 

and management training.

SECTION 10 -  ENVIRONMENTAL 

10.1 Overview 

The Prefeasibility Study for the Inata Gold Project included a detailed Environmental Impact Study that 

investigated the impact of the mine and process plant on the environment in terms of: 

• Air quality and climate; 

• Hydrology; 

• Hydrogeology; 

• Water quality; 

• Noise and vibration; 

• Flora and fauna; 

• Socio-economics; and 

• Cultural heritage. 

The Environmental Impact Study (EIS) was carried out by Socrege in 2005 on behalf of Resolute (West 

Africa) Ltd for the Inata mine site.  

Since the completion of the 2005 EIS the proposed capacity of the mine and process plant has increased and 

various design parameters have been revised as a result of recent exploration and geological and 

metallurgical test work. These parameters are summarised in Table 119 below.

• Document emergency preparedness and response activities and resources (especially in terms of 

tailings dam accidents or flooding); 

• Present mitigation measures for all significant impacts; and 

• Develop an Environmental Management Plan. 

 

10.2 Tailings Dam, Mine and Process Plant Closure 

10.2.1 General 

It is recommended that a 'best practice' closure plan should be developed at the detailed design stage for the 

Inata Project based on guidelines similar to those prepared by the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development 

and Mines (1995) or the Draft Reference Document on Best Available Techniques of Management of Tailings. 

The plan will incorporate a long-term target for closure and rehabilitation which will permit the mine operator to 

leave the site in a condition that requires limited further maintenance or monitoring.   

The main closure activities for the project, including the TMF, which will require remediation, are envisaged to 

be: 

• remediation of the open pit to ensure slope stability, public and wildlife security and safety; 

• remediation of the waste dumps; 

• dismantling of all surface infrastructure not required for future end-use; 

• vegetation of the tailings surface and downstream embankments to minimise the potential for 

wind and water erosion; 

• ongoing downstream environmental monitoring programme. 

It is recommended that the management and operational requirements for implementing the environmental 

procedures are reviewed in the updated EIA and the costs appraised as part of the overall project strategy 

plan. 

10.2.2 TMF Closure 

The TMF will comprise on completion a 36 m high structural fill embankment confining some 10 Mm3 of 

process waste.  The facility has been engineered for closure such that drainage and consolidation of the 

tailings mass occurs concurrent with the TMF operation leading to a rapid stabilisation of the surface post 

operation.   

The above will allow the rapid construction of a cover system to minimise the potential for wind and water 

erosion with the objectives of long-term stability and an appropriate after use, which requires minimal 

maintenance.  The process of closure will commence prior to the cessation of mining operations, probably 

during the final two years of processing operations, to ensure that the objectives can be achieved cost 

effectively and will continue as the performance of the depository demands.

As is considered best practice for mine and tailings disposal sites internationally, information will be collected 

throughout the deposition period to ensure that an appropriate closure strategy is adopted.  This information 

will include data on tailings geotechnical and geochemical properties, as well as on vegetation types, 

hydrology, meteorology etc.  These data will be incorporated into the closure planning documents, which will 

be prepared within two years of start up and updated on a regular basis throughout the operations. 

To achieve these objectives, the closure plan will define a number of key periods of activity on the facility 

which are identified and described in the following sections. 

10.2.3 Pre Closure Period 

During approximately the last two years of processing, preparatory works will be commenced including 

modification of the tailings disposal system to ensure achievement of the final surface topography and to 

encourage early consolidation of the upper surface of the depository.  This will entail the following: 

• introduction of coarser materials as appropriate with the slurry to achieve enhanced 

consolidation and to facilitate early access to the tailings surface post closure ; 

• control of deposition to maintain and minimise the tailings pond; 

• stockpiling of approved low permeability overburden materials for spreading onto the tailings; 

• inclusion of nutrients and seed stock into the final layers as determined from vegetation trials. 

The rehabilitation will use natural materials stockpiled within the working area during the early stages of 

construction to ensure the tailings basin achieves and retains an appropriate end-use.  

A final cover will require to be designed during this period.  However, for the purposed of this study, AMEC 

have assumed that up to 300 mm of clayey silt material will be placed onto the consolidated tailings which in 

turn will be covered with a minimum of 300 mm protective layer to avoid surface erosion especially during high 

intensity rainfall events.  Surface drainage gullies will be formed and side slope spillways installed to prevent 

storm erosion of the completed embankment. 

10.2.4 Post Closure Period 

After the cessation of tailings disposal, intensive input will be required to achieve the final surface topography 

commensurate with the agreed after use and to ensure its long-term integrity.  This will include the following: 

• operation, as required, of the decant pump to drain the residual supernatant from the tailings 

depository and convey this water to an effluent treatment works; 

• progressive ripping and scarifying and landscaping of stockpile areas, haul tracks and services 

road; 

• operation and maintenance of the decant pump and pipework, as conditions dictate; 

• operation of the drainage collection sump pump and pipework to recycle seepage water back to 

the supernatant pond or the effluent treatment works as appropriate; 

• ongoing maintenance of the TMF and its associated infrastructure;

• monitoring of water quality, flows and water levels in the drainage collection sump; 

• monitoring of embankment performance from surveys, piezometers, settlement gauges and 

seepage data together with annual expert inspection and instrumentation audit; 

• placement of any cover/capillary break layer as considered appropriate, using appropriate 

equipment.  The depth and grading of the material comprising such a cover will depend on the 

geotechnical characteristics of the final tailings layers.  Material for this cover is assumed to be 

freely available from overburden waste stockpiles; 

• all roads not required for the servicing of the embankment during the implementation of closure 

will be ripped and scarified to encourage re-vegetation of the surface; and 

• independent post closure auditing. 

10.2.5 Long-Term Maintenance Period 

Once any capping and initial re-vegetation has been achieved there will be a need for a longer-term 

programme of works including maintenance and inspection prior to the eventual handover to the local 

authority or other party.  This will involve the following: 

• dismantling and removal of the decant pump and pipework; 

• dismantling and removal of the sump pump and pipework; 

• cessation of recycling of seepage water; 

• ongoing maintenance of the vegetation including thinning and replacement of selected planting 

to ensure that the long-term species diversity and health is achieved; 

• it is anticipated that the size and importance of the TMF embankment will require that there is 

an ongoing programme of monitoring, instrumentation and of inspection both locally and by a 

competent expert.  The maintenance of this function is consistent with statutory requirements 

for long-term inspection of embankments and tailings depositories within Western Europe and is 

an essential requirement to ensure that the embankment integrity is maintained.

The water supply is via a hdpe pipeline which has been designed  by GBM and quantities calculated. The 

costs of the pipe is from a recent quote for this type and size of pipe. 

Amec have carried out a preliminary design for the barrage and a bill of quantities has been compiled and 

costed.   

11.3.16 Infrastructure 

The main parts of the infrastructure are the civil construction works and the camp and plant buildings. 

The camp buildings are prefabriacated units for which there is a quoted price. 

The civil construction works quantities have been calculated and the price calculated using current robust 

rates. 

The plant buildings costs have been calculated on the same basis as above. 

11.3.17 EPCM 

GBM have calculated the full EPCM package by preparing a detailed programme, a comprehensive list of 

deliverables to be produced, and a full list of equipment to be purchased.  This has enabled GBM to prepare a 

comprehensive cost for EPCM. A capital cost estimate of US$10,000,000 has been used in the capital cost 

estimate and financial analysis.

For the base case scenario of a 2.25 Mtpa CIL process plant, the gold production is estimated to average 

136,000 ounces per annum for a 7 year life of mine.   

Cash operating costs, excluding the cost of pre-stripping, are estimated to average US$336.26/oz before 

royalties, interest and taxes over the 7.0 year life of the mine. The equivalent cost per tonne of material mined 

is $2.43. 

Allowing for a 12 month design, procurement, construction to first production/revenue schedule, the after tax 

project payback at a US$650/oz gold price is 2.7 years. The associated Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the 

project is 49.75% and the Net Present Value (NPV) at 0% is US$128,086,142.

SECTION 12 -  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 

12.1 Introduction 

The purpose of this section is to outline the implementation plan for the successful execution of the proposed 

new gold plant and associated infrastructure at the Inata Project Mine site, Burkina Faso. 

It is understood that the client wishes to "fast track" this project and this plan outlines the steps necessary to 

make this happen in the client's best interests. 

 

12.2 Nature of Implementation 

The nature of the implementation plan is determined considering the project site location, the regulations 

governing construction in Burkina Faso, the key milestone dates as set out in this section and the anticipated 

efficiency levels of the construction contractors. The implementation plan also takes into account the 

implications of relocation and integration of the existing Brocks Creek processing plant in Australia into the 

overall design and construction of the Inata Project in Burkina Faso. 

Construction of the process plant and site infrastructure will be implemented under the overall management of 

the EPCM (Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management) Contractor. Direct control of 

construction shall be the responsibility of the individual contractors.  

All fabrication, where practical, will be done in Burkina Faso. Included in the Engineers team will be expatriate 

quality control and expediting personnel who will ensure that off-site fabrication schedules and quality of work 

are in accordance with the project requirements.   

 

12.3 Critical Drivers for Fast Tracking 

The following are the critical drivers influencing the implementation plan of the Project: 

• Completion and "freezing" of Basic Engineering. 

• Basic engineering essentially constitutes: 

o Site layout drawings; 

o Process design Criteria; 

o Process flowsheets; 

o P&ID's; 

o GA's;  

o Single line diagrams; 

o Project schedule (level 1) with critical path analysis; 

o Project Budget;

o Engineering procurement packages for long lead/critical equipment; 

o Camp conceptual design; 

o Infrastructure conceptual design. 

• Commence detailed engineering in accordance with fast track schedule requirements. 

• Permitting and licensing as necessary (by Owner). 

• Site Geotechnical evaluation; 

• Design/determine early infrastructure requirements to support commencement of construction ie. 

camp and office requirements, communications, power, water, sewage disposal and contractor 

laydown areas; 

• Mass earthwork drawings IFC for early construction commencement, 

• Pre qualification of potential construction contractors and obtain expressions of interest; 

• Commission a Traffic and Logistics (T&L) study for the relocation of the Brocks Creek plant and 

equipment from Australia to the Inata Mine site (via refurbishment facilities for certain critical 

equipment items); 

• Hydrogeological analysis for water availability; 

• Establish installed power and emergency power requirements; 

• Identify and develop engineering procurement packages for long lead items and solicit bids;  

• Establish scope of site communication systems; 

• Undertake crane lifting studies for construction heavy lifts; 

• Fast track design and construction of underground utilities; 

• Topographical survey of the plant and infrastructure areas. 

 

12.4 Strategy for Fast Tracking 

In order to fast track this project the execution programme is divided into 4 Phases. Phase 1 being the 

Feasibility Study and Phase 2 being Basic Engineering. 

• Phase 1 Feasibility Study 

• Phase 2 – Basic Engineering. Completion of Basic Engineering is critical to the successful 

implementation of the fast track schedule. Concerted effort should be put into "freezing" basic 

engineering expeditiously.  

• Phase 3 – Detailed design and approval stage. This phase will include the detail design of the plant 

and infrastructure including the development of engineering procurement packages for equipment and

materials. The detailed engineering activities will be executed and issued for construction in such a 

way as to support the fast track approach.    

• Phase 4 – Construction Execution. This phase is the physical construction of the plant and 

infrastructure.  

Further critical items influencing the implementation are as follows: 

• Availability of suitable local contractors, plant and equipment for construction; 

• Availability of local construction commodities/consumables;

SECTION 13 -  CONCLUSIONS 

The Inata Gold Project resource deposits exhibit good continuity of mineralisation thickness, and the total 

combined resource at a 0.5g/t cut-off grade is 25.1 Mt at 1.8g/t giving 1,397kozs of contained gold. 

A traditional CIL treatment plant has been designed to extract the gold, and in order to construct the plant in 

the shortest possible time Goldbelt Resources has secured the major long lead equipment by purchasing 

second hand mills, crusher, and power plant. 

Water supply for the Plant is a key issue and a design has been prepared for the construction of a barrage at 

Gomde. This barrage will be constructed before the 2008 rainy season and will be capable, given average 

rainfall, of impounding sufficient water for the total plant, mining and infrastructure for 2 consecutive dry years. 

The environmental impact study was prepared 2 years ago on the basis of the parameters in the pre-feasibility 

study, and is currently being upgraded to include the current information. 

The previous study concluded that the environment would not suffer any detrimental affects and it is expected 

that the latest study will have the same conclusion. 

Total capital expenditure, excluding previously purchased items has been prepared to an accuracy of + or – 

15%. Contingencies have been assessed for all the individual areas of the plant and infrastructure and is 

equivalent to 10.6% of the future capital expenditure. 

The financial analysis, at a gold price of US$650/oz, calculates an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the project 

of 49.75% and the Net Present Value (NPV) at 0% of US$128,086,142.

SECTION 2 -  MINING 

2.1 Detailed Optimistic Results for INATA and MINFO 

 

Whittle Optimisation and Analyses: Explanatory Notes 

 

The Whittle pit optimisations were based on a plant throughput of 2.0Mtpa. The Whittle optimisation programme uses plant throughput to derive discounted 

cash values from calculated cash flows. Higher throughput rates will increase the discounted value of a particular pit, all other inputs being equal. 

The costs inputs used in Whittle were also derived from this planned throughput. An increase on plant throughput will result in a decrease in unit processing 

costs, as a proportion of costs are fixed. Consequently, the cash value of a particular pit will increase for an increased throughput, all other inputs being equal.  

All costs are calculated to an accuracy appropriate to the BFS, i.e. +/-15% 

Following the Whittle optimisations and the selection of the most suitable pit shell for mine design purposes and the establishment of a mine schedule, it was 

determined that an increase in plant throughput was justified, and subsequently all analyses and cost derivations were based on the assumption of a 

2.25Mtpa throughput. 

It was deemed unnecessary to repeat the optimisation process, because the original pit shell selection criteria was based on maximising ore reserves, and 

was larger than that indicated by the theoretical maximum value of the cash value curve. Consequently, it was decided that despite the shift in cash value 

curve that would result through a re-optimisation process, the pit shells that were used were still within acceptable industry standard limits as compared to the 

maximum value of the cash value curve, and would in fact be closer to this maximum value, i.e. more optimal.  

In essence the increase in process throughput rate validated the pit shell selection policy applied in the BFS (and explained in section 6.5 of the BFS)

Estimate of Milling Circuit Throughput (revised) Goldbelt Resources Ltd 

GBM MEC 0287 (Goldbelt Resources) 1 

1. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
Goldbelt Resources Ltd is developing the Inata Gold Project in Burkina Faso.  The deposit 
consists of a Measured and Indicated Resource of 21.6 million tonnes at a grade of 1.7g/t Au.  
Goldbelt have purchased the CIL plant previously operated at Brock's Creek in Australia for 
relocation to the project site. 

A Bankable Feasibility Study of the Inata Project is being undertaken by GBM Minerals 
Engineering Consultants Ltd (UK). 

The Brock's Creek plant has a nominal capacity of 1.5Mtpa.  In the light of a revised resource 
estimate, Goldbelt are interested in increasing the throughput target to 2.25Mtpa, and have 
purchased an additional ball mill to achieve this. 

Goldbelt have requested an independent review of the milling capacity in the light of 
available ore hardness data, with a view to forming an opinion of whether the circuit will be 
capable of processing the target throughput for the range of ore hardnesses expected over the 
life of mine. 

2. METHODOLOGY 
A series of Bond Ball Mill Work Index values have been provided.  These values have been 
determined from three drill holes, two from the North ore zone and one from the Central ore 
zone, and have been further described according to ore type.  The Bond Ball Mill Work index 
values are: 

• Oxide ore: 10.4kWh/t (North), 10.6kWh/t (North), 6.4kWh/t (Central) 
• Transition ore: 13.2kWh/t (North), 14.1kWh/t (North), 9.0kWh/t (Central) 
• Fresh ore: 15.2kWh/t (North), 14.5kWh/t (North), 9.9kWh/t (Central) 

A production plan has also been provided, showing ore production from various areas of the 
mine over the life of mine period.  This lists tonnage, grade and expected Bond Work Index 
(amongst other things) monthly for Year 1, quarterly for Years 2 and 3, then yearly for the 
remaining four years of the mine plan.  The range of annual average figures is from 6.5kWh/t 
(Year 6) to 11.0kWh/t (Year 4), with the overall Life of Mine average being 9.0kWh/t.  The 
highest individual figure reported is 14.3kWh/t, and the lowest 6.2kWh/t. 

The use of a Bond Ball Mill Work Index to estimate the likely performance of a ball milling 
circuit is standard industry practice, however the use of a Bond Ball Mill Work Index to 
estimate the performance of a SAG mill, while suitable for a Scoping level study, and perhaps 
for a Pre-Feasibility study, is not sufficiently detailed for a Feasibility level of study.  
Therefore, the throughput estimates calculated in this report should be viewed in that context. 

The Brock's Creek SAG mill has dimensions of 6.10m (diameter) by 3.36m (length); these 
are assumed to be inside shell dimensions.  The SAG mill motor is 1500kW.  After making 
suitable allowances for liner, grate and pulp lifter dimensions, the power calculation method 
of Morrell (1996) was used to confirm the power requirements of this mill.  At a typical mill 
speed of 75% critical, a ball charge of 12.5% (by volume) and a typical total charge of 25% 
(by volume), the calculated motor power draw was 1355kW, or 90% of the installed motor 
capacity.  The calculations that follow used this as the operating power draw for the SAG 
mill. 

The Brock's Creek ball mill has dimensions of 3.97m (diameter) by 4.88m (length); these are 
assumed to be inside shell dimensions.  This mill has a 1000kW motor.  The second ball mill 
has dimensions of 3.66m (diameter) by 5.49m (length); again these are assumed to be inside 
shell dimensions.  This mill is fitted with a 1200kW motor.  After making suitable allowances 
for the liners, the power calculation method of Rowland and Kjos (1978) was used to confirm

GBM MEC 0287 (Goldbelt Resources) 2 

the power requirements of these mills.  At a typical mill speed of 75% critical, the calculated 
motor power draw for the Brock's Creek mill was 900kW (i.e. 90% of the installed motor 
power) for a ball charge of 26%.  This is a relatively low figure, and is towards the low end of 
the typical range of operating ball loads for a ball mill.  For the additional ball mill, again at a 
speed of 75% critical, the calculated motor power draw reached 90% of the installed motor 
power at a ball load of 40%.  This is a relatively high figure, again towards the high end of the 
typical operating range. 

The calculations that follow used a figure 5% less than these figures as the operating power 
draw of the ball mill/s. 

The aim of the throughput analysis was to determine the relationship between plant 
throughput (one ball mill and two ball mills) and Bond Ball Mill Work index, over the range 
6-15kWh/t.  Having determined this relationship, estimates could be made of the likelihood of 
the projected ore blends achieving the target throughput for milling circuit options consisting 
of both ball mills in operation, and of only one ball mill (in this case the larger mill, i.e. the 
"additional" mill with the larger motor) in operation. 

The SAG mill throughput was estimated using the standard Bond Work Index formula:

The ball mill throughput was estimated using the Bond Work Index formula with correction 
factors, as described by Rowland and Kjos (1978). 

The SAG mill calculation used an F80 value of 110mm, representing an estimate of the P80 of 
a primary crusher operating with a gap of 150mm.  The value of Wi used for the SAG 
calculation was the 120% of the Ball Mill Work Index value (the so-called "fSAG method").  
For a selected tph estimate, the value of P80 was calculated, and used as the estimate of F80 for 
the ball mill calculation.  This figure is often known as the "transfer size", or T80. 

The process was iterated until the feedrate, T80 and power for each milling stage balanced, i.e. 
the T80 calculated from the feedrate in the SAG mill stage produced the target ball mill P80 
with the target ball mill power. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The results of the estimation of throughput as a function of Bond Ball Mill Work Index are 
shown in Table 1 below, and illustrated in Figure 1.  Also shown in Figure 1 is the target 
throughput of 2.25Mtpa (285tph @ 90% availability).  The throughput figures have been 
estimated to the nearest 5tph. 

The results show the expected decrease in estimated throughput with increasing hardness, and 
that the estimated throughput with two ball mills is high than with one ball mill.  The 
magnitude of both of these effects decreases with increasing hardness. 

With both ball mills in operation, the calculations suggest that the target throughput of 
2.25Mtpa will be achieved at values of the Bond Ball Mill Work Index of only up to just 
under 9.5kWh/t.  This suggests that the projected production rates for several of the years in 
the production plan may not be achieved – specifically Year 2 (average Bond Ball Mill Work 
Index 10.0kWh/t) and Year 4 (average Bond Ball Mill Work Index 11.0kWh/t).  While the 
average Bond Ball Mill Work index figure for Year 7 is 9.6kWh/t, the planned throughput for 
this (the final) year is only just over 2.0Mtpa.

However, for Year 6, where the average Bond Ball Mill Work Index is 6.5kWh/t, the results 
indicate that it may be possible to process the planned production for that year using only the 
larger (i.e. "additional") ball mill in conjunction with the SAG mill. 

Values of the transfer size (T80) typically range from 0.5mm to 1mm, i.e. 500µm to 1000µm.  
For the two ball mill circuit, the estimated T80 is slightly lower than this range of values.  For 
the single ball mill circuit, the estimated T80 is significantly lower than this typical range, at 
approximately 240µm.  This indicates that the circuit, for either configuration, is ball mill 
limited, i.e. the SAG mill is being asked to do a greater share of the grinding duty than might 
be considered "typical".

Reviewing the production plan, the proposed ore supply appears to be predominantly a blend 
of material with an average Bond Ball Mill Work Index of the order of 10.5kWh/t, and 
material with an average Bond Ball Mill Work Index of the order of 6.5kWh/t.  Under these 
circumstances, considerable attention will need to be paid to blending the ore to be fed to the 
milling circuit, to prevent wide swings in the circuit throughput, and to ensure that, on 
average, the circuit can meet the 2.25Mtpa planned average throughput. 

While the throughput estimates indicate that the target throughputs could be achieved feeding 
the "soft" ore (i.e. the ore with a Bond Ball Mill Work index of the order of 6.5kWh/t) only, 
in practice this may not be advisable.  SAG mills require the ore to provide competent ore 
particles as the main portion of the grinding media charge.  If coarse particles of this material 
with the low Bond Ball Mil Work Index ore are as soft as the Bond Ball Mill Work Index 
indicates the ore is for grinding at finer sizes, then this ore may not be capable of providing a 
suitable level of charge in the SAG mill.  This in turn can limit the capacity of the SAG mill, 
even if the ore itself is "soft" for grinding.  It may therefore be necessary to provide some 
minimum level of the harder ore types ore into the milling circuit in order to achieve the target 
throughput levels. 

The above calculation methodology and the available ore "hardness" information is not 
sufficiently detailed or sophisticated to make a quantifiable assessment of this sort of 
behaviour. 

4. RECOMMENDATIONS 
As noted earlier, the calculation methodology used in this report to predict SAG mill 
performance produces results that should be considered to be indicative at best.  A more 
sophisticated approached would be to conduct a simulation study, using commercially 
available software such as the mineral processing simulator JKSimMet. 

Such a study is therefore recommended to provide a greater degree of confidence in the 
throughput estimates.  This study could also identify potential circuit modifications that could 
result in the circuit achieving the target 2.25Mtpa throughput when feeding all of the ore types 
and the expected blends of ores. 

Conducting such a simulation study would require more laboratory-based ore "hardness" 
testwork to be undertaken, to provide suitable ore characterisation data, particularly of the ore 
breakage characteristics at coarser sizes.

SECTION 2 -  BROCKS CREEK PLANT 

Goldbelt purchased the Brocks Creek plant with the intention of using the majority of the plant as the basis for 

the Gold Plant at INATA in Burkina Faso. GBM visited the Brocks Creek plant to identify the items of plant to 

reuse.. 

The Personnel involved in the determinations were as follows:- 

  Malcolm Hope GBM MEC 

 Glenn Wightman Big Rock Consulting (GBM's Mill Expert) 

 Gary Argus Previously Maintenance Engineer on Brocks Creek Plant 

 Mark Mussig NAC Previously Electrical Engineer on Brocks Creek Plant. 

The clients team comprised of:- 

 Collin Ellison President & CEO 

 David Mulroney 

 Brendan Dwyer 

2.1 Summary of plant visit 

The plant had been well maintained and was found to be generally in good condition, the major plant items 

such as the SAG Mill, Ball Mill and jaw crusher required a relatively small amount of refurbishment work. 

We believe that certain specialist engineering assistance will be required during the dismantling process, 

especially during dismantling and packing of the:- 

 SAG MILL mechanical items  

 Ball Mill mechanical items. 

This would be either a representative from Big Rock Consulting / New Concept Projects or a suitably qualified 

Mill Expert from Australia. It is imperative that the mill expert is present on site during the installation of the 

mills in Burkina Faso 

 Electrical items 

This would be Mark Mussig of North Australian Controls. 

It would be beneficial that there should be a representative from the company who would carry out the 

reinstallation of the Brocks Creek Plant in Burkina Faso.

SECTION 3 -  BROCKS CREEK PLANT DISCUSSION 
Please see the attached list in Appendix 1 

3.1 Primary Crushing Area 

The primary crushing area comprised of the following:- 

ROM Bin 

The bin is essentially a concrete box with rolled steel plate outlet chute and rolled steel plate guide plates Our 

recommendation would be to leave the bin and chute work in place. 

Feeder 

The feeder is a hydraulically driven plate feeder, the feeder is in poor ondition and will not be reused in our 

revised arrangement for the Inata Project We recommend that the feeder is either sold or scrapped on site 

Primary Crusher 

The Primary Crusher was bought refurbished for the Brocks Plant, the Crusher is a size 160 Kue Ken crusher 

with a 110kw drive manufactured by Brown Lennox. The crusher appears in good condition and there are 

spare liners in the store yard According to Gary Argus the crusher gave very little trouble after it was modified 

in the area of the diaphragm.The crusher is suitable for use as a primary crusher in the Inata plant. 

We recommend that the crusher is dismantled and examined with a view to refurbishment We would 

recommend that this work be carried out under the supervision of a representative of  Advanced Crusher 

Spares who took over many of the patterns, spares and servicing of the Kue Ken Crushers.

ROM Area Steelwork 

The Steelwork is in good condition and requires to be cleaned and painted to be suitable for reuse. We would 

recommend that the steelwork should be dismantled in sections, match marked by either punching or welding 

and packed in containers 

The floor grating should be strapped and tagged with appropriate area number and packed into container,  

Handrailing should be cut into suitable lengths and marked with area number and packed into container. 

Stairways to be dismantled in flights with stairtreads fitted, marked with appropriate number and packed into 

containers. 

Crusher Feed and discharge chute 

The chute work is in good condition and is suitable for re use. 

 We would recommend that the chute should be dismantled in as small sections as possible, match marked 

with area number and packed into containers.

Conveyor CV-001 

The conveyor looks in re usable condition in its entirety.  We would recommend that the conveyor items be 

treated as per the attached list in Appendix 1 

Magnet 

The magnet along with its transformer, hoist and support steelwork should be re used, assuming that the 

magnet and transformer are still functional. 

We would recommend that the items are dealt with as per the attached list in Appendix 1. 

Dust Extraction Unit 

The dust extraction unit shall be re used assuming the unit is found to be functional by the OEM. 

Figure 3 Conveyor CV-001 

 

3.2 Stocking Out 

At the time of the visit the envisaged system at Inata did not have a stockpile, the Inata plant may have a 

stockpile hence we can re use certain items from the stockpile system. These are:

3.3 SAG Mill 

See list in Appendix 1 

The mill has been subjected to some repairs in its lifetime. The first repair was carried out by the original 

supplier in the USA, where the ribs on the discharge end heads were welded up converting a two piece mill 

into a single piece. The mill was then transported to its present site. 

After a period of time at Brocks Creek the ribs at the feed end head showed signs of cracking at the root. 

These were subject to extensively documented repair and the mill put back into service. 

The mill appears in good condition with the following faults noted at time of inspection:- 

Shell Some  slightly elongated holes – can be rectified with " African Washers". The shell should have NDT' to 

the previous problem areas and these should be periodically checked during running. 

Trunnions Seals require renewing and bearings should be inspected (spare available) 

Girth Gear Appears in good condition, should have random NDT on teeth. 

Pinion Appears worn but serviceable, a spare pinion in stock appears to be "overground"  choice is case 

harden existing units or purchase new pinion. should have random NDT on teeth,  

Gearbox – David Brown Unit appears in good condition but should be checked out by the OEM. 

Motor- this is a DC unit, the motor should be stripped and inspected but appears in good condition. The set is 

a little unusual but offers a number of advantages both process and operational. 

Switchgear DC drive appears in good condition and well documented. The unit has been reliable during 

operation at Brocks Creek.

Final Comments: 
 
This ball mill is completely assembled and none of the guards and covers were removed, making it hard to do a 
thorough inspection.  This mill appears in excellent condition and from what the maintenance people said about the 
unit, I would be surprised if any more than minor refurbishment was required.  I would suggest cleaning up the gear 
spray system, the lube system and checking the gear box otherwise everything looks very good.

Inspection 
 
 

Motor; 
Make: Gulf Power Systems 
1500KW  
Horse Power: 2000 at 750 volts 
Type: DC 
 
Comments: 
This is a DC motor to gear box to pinion set up. This unit appears in excellent condition. The DC drive is not as 
common as the traditional, synchronous or wound rotor style. The DC motor adds the capability to vary the mill 
speed and eliminates the need for an inching drive. DC motors have full torque at zero speed. They are extremely 
smooth, reducing wear on both clutch and gear box. 
 
 The down side to a DC motor is slightly higher maintenance. Brushes and brush holders have to be checked and 
changed on a regular basis. One of the inherent problems that was mentioned is dirt getting into the brushes and 
commutator. I would suggest improving the filter system on the two blower units that pressurize the motor. Power 
factor correction is also a concern if you are on a power grid. As your mine is generating its own electricity, this is 
not an issue.  
 
The DC motor has no in rush of power on start-up, which means no extra loading on the generator system when 
starting the mill. I believe the D/C motor is the best choice for your application. 

 

 
 
 
Switch Gear 
Make: Ross hill SCR controllers 
Voltage: A/C to D/C converter 
 
Comments:  
These units are critical to the star-up of the D/C drives.

Feed Head and Discharge Trunnion 
  
 

     
 
Both trunnions appear in very good condition.  No wash was visible and there were no signs of leakage.           
Bolt holes are excellent. 
Trunnion faces were unable to be inspected; however, I have no reason to believe they are not in good condition. 
The maintenance general foreman mentioned that he was concerned that there may be some minor damage to the 
feed trunnion bearing due to contamination. He said they were having problems keeping the dust seals in the 
trunnion; this will have to be checked prior to installation. If the bearing is damaged it should be replaced with the 
spare. 
The seals should be replaced with new units during installation. 
The feed end of the mill has a load cell assembly located under the feed trunnion. This unit works on a pivot point 
and is in good condition. The maintenance foreman says that the unit requires a new sensor. 
 

 
 
 

During disassembly care must be taken not to spin the mill, with 
no lubrication to the trunnion bearing. I have seen trunnions 
damaged this way during removal.

Shell 
 
Number of Pieces: 1 
Liner Bolt Hole Size: 1 ½ "some minor oblongation (could be repaired with African washers) 
 

   
 
Some of the liner bolt holes have been blanked off.  I assume this was due to a change in liner design. Liner 
drawings should be checked carefully prior to purchasing any new liners.   
 
Condition of Shell: This shell was originally a two piece assembly, the ribbed style, where the heads were 
incorporated into the shell. The inherent problem with this type of design was cracking along the ribs toward the 
trunnions.  
 
This unit has received extensive repair. The main repair was done in the U.S.  I would suggest this repair was done 
under the guidance of the OEM, as the whole mill had to be removed and repaired. The discharge end of the shell 
assembly was completely rebuilt, the ribs were removed and a circular section was cut out approximately 14' in 
diameter and replaced with a new section far thicker and stronger than the original design.  To do this it appears 
the machine shop first cut the entire discharge end of the mill off at the gear flange. They then rebuilt the end using 
the gear bolting flange and approximately 3' of the old head shell section. They welded the new head and gear 
flange back to the original shell. Once welding was complete, they would have to stress relieve the whole unit and 
re-machine the trunnion faces. This repair converted the mill from a two piece shell to a one piece unit.

The second repair to the mill shell was done in Australia, as I understand, prior to installation. This repair was to the 
feed end where the ribs that showed cracking were repaired and new ribs were added for re-enforcing. Once again 
this repair appears to have been done by a professional.  The feed end now appears crack free and has been 
stiffened. Once this mill is up and running, these ribs should be checked periodically for stress cracks.  If cracks are 
found, they can be easily repaired as long as they are detected early on.  
 

 
 
 
Comments:   
The up side to having the one piece shell is that, after repair, it is now structurally stronger then when first built. 
Being in one piece will stop some of the flexing that caused the problems with the original design. 
 You will also save on fastening hardware, rubber lining, removal and installation cost. 
As you will have to get permits for the sag from the Australian Department of Transport, I would apply to ship the 
ball mill in one piece as well.  Permitting the smaller unit should be no problem as the DOT's main concern will be 
with the sag shell. 
The savings, shipping both units in one piece, should out weigh the extra logistical cost. 
 
The down side to a one piece shell is the size; 21' in diameter and 80 ton weight.  This will no doubt cause some 
logistical problems with shipping and re-assembly. 
Fortunately, the sag mill is outdoors and a 150 ton crane can get right up next to it, so the 80 ton lift is not a big 
problem. In Australia, the mill will have to be shipped on its ends making it 21' wide by approx 14' high. This mill 
was shipped to site from the Port in Darwin in one piece and as it can't be disassembled.  There should be no 
problems shipping back to the port.   
Once arriving in Africa there could be some handling problems.  You may want to consider shipping the shell on it's 
side making it 21' tall and only 14' wide. If the mill is off loaded in the same position, you will be able to roll it to its 
permanent location.  Once on site, if cranes are a problem, you could crib the mill and use jacks to raise and lower 
into trunnion bearings during installation.

Bull Gear 
 
Type: Single Helical  
Number of Pieces: 2 
NDT Testing: No 
Has Gear Been Turned? No 
 
Comments: 
Bull gear appears in good shape. Webbing and teeth look good. 
Some slight pitting and wear is apparent on the drive side of the tooth. It appears some fine contamination has 
been wearing the teeth. Gear could be turned at time of installation if new pinion is purchased. If new pinion is not 
purchased, I would leave the gear face as installed now. 
I believe the lubrication being used was too light for this application, due to the ambient temperature in the area. A 
heavier lubrication should be used. (I will forward recommended lubrication manual from Falk)   
Gear has shims between both gear flange and shell flange. This is normal on all mills for proper gear alignment and 
critical for this mill (see comments on installation.) 
New gear hardware looks to be available in the warehouse. This should be double checked as you will require a 
new gear split joint hardware prior to installation. 
 

  
 
 
Bull gear drip ring in good condition. 
Bull gear guards in good condition. 
Bull gear guards should be cleaned prior to shipping 
 
Pinion 
 
The pinion that is installed has had the teeth ground down, so the face of the teeth are at least 1/8 "smaller than the 
original. They may have unknowingly ground the contour off of the contact face of the pinion tooth causing the 
pinions to wear even faster. Grinding the pinion was no doubt done to remove wear ridges (caused by 
contamination and inadequate lubrication). We were told they changed out pinions every 7 months.  They have a 
spare in the outside warehouse.  This unit has also been ground. The pinions were not case hardened, so they 
were made out of some sort of shafting material. I believe that they were probably just trying to get by until 
shutdown; otherwise I am sure they would have purchased a new pinion.  
A new pinion with correct lubrication and proper alignment will last indefinitely.  I would suggest purchasing a new 
pinion. If you want to postpone that purchase, it may be worth sending the two pinions currently on site out for case 
hardening.  
This should gain you a couple years of operation without purchasing a pinion.

Pillow blocks look to be in good condition 
 
 
Trunnion Bearings 
Look to be in good condition.  Inspection plates could not be removed, but I would be surprised to find damage. 
See comments on feed trunnion bearing with trunnion comments. Spare brass bearing in warehouse. 
New trunnion dust seals should be purchased   
 
Lubrication: from lube system 
 

Sole Plates 
 Motor, gearbox, pinion and trunnion sole plates all look very good.  They are easily removed as they have not been 
grouted in place. I would suggest grouting sole plate when installing.  
 

 
 
Comments: 
Check & clean adjustment bolts. 
 
 
Trommel Screen 
Steel trommel screen in good condition and needs little repair.

David Brown speed reducer appears in good condition. The sole plate has been modified to accept the new gear 
box, as the original gear box was a lighter unit that failed and was replaced. The original unit is still on site.  We 
were told it was rebuilt. 

    
  
Comments:  
Gearbox should be cleaned and checked over prior to installation 
 
Lube System Pumps 
 
The lube system was designed on site and is a High/ Low pressure unit. It appears to be similar to the new OEM 
style system. Both Ball and Sag mill have a similar set up. I would reuse these systems but would go over them 
thoroughly prior to commissioning of the mill. (I will forward you a print of a typical lube system for a mill of this size)    
 

   

 
 
Gear Spray System 
 
Type: Lincoln.  Normally I would recommend purchasing a new system, however this system looks to be n good 
shape. I would give it a good clean-up and reuse.

As I am recommending a heavier lubricant you should check the orifice size on the injectors to insure they can 
handle the new gear lube. 
 
Feed Chute  
Feed chute is on tracks and is in good condition.  There is a spare set of chute liners in the warehouse.  

   
 
Instrumentation 
Must be replaced as pieces are damaged and missing. 
 
Auxiliary Equipment 
Cradles / Stands / Jacking System 
All appear in very good condition. Was unable to locate jacks and was told they had been lent out. This should be 
followed up to insure their return. 
 
   

 
 
Inching Drive: Not require as mill has D/C drive. 
 
 
Spare Parts 
 
There are a number of miscellaneous mill parts in the warehouse.  You should get an inventory lists to insure none 
are missed when shipping the mills.   
Spare liners – there is not a complete set.  I believe there is a set of feed and discharge liners. There does not 
appear to be any shell plate liners or shell lifter bars.

Final Comments:  
Both ball and sag mill are in very nice shape. The maintenance and electrical supervisors, who both were on site 
during inspection, were very knowledgeable of the plants workings.  The cleanliness of the entire plant tells me that 
this was a well run plant with a good preventive maintenance system in place. Talking with 
both of the supervisors, it became very apparent that they were proud of how the plant had run and the innovations 
they both implemented.   
 
While the sag mill has seen its fair share of repairs in the past, it appears to be in good condition now. The last 
repairs seem to have solved most of the cracking issues. There are no visible leaks/cracks or any significant wear.  
These repairs, no matter how well they were done, will still cause some extra alignment problems during 
reassembly.  This must to be taken into account.   
 
The number one thing to insure with this mill during installation, more so than with any other, will be exact 
measurement on sole plate levels, motor to gear box, gear box to pinion and gear alignment.  
Count on three to five extra days during assembly for alignments. Make sure all tolerances are less than 
OEM spec. For example, if spec calls for plus/minus 25 thousands, shoot for 15. Make sure you bring in an 
expert for the critical shimming, adjustments, measurements and alignment.  
If the installation of this mill is done properly and your tolerances are checked regularly, there is no reason 
this mill not provide many years of trouble free service.

Introduction

On the 26th June 2007 Metso Minerals was asked to conduct a preliminary audit on a 13' x 16'
Allis Chalmers Ball Mill and a 20' x 11' Marcy SAG Mill, that was currently installed at the
Brocks Creek Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.

At the time of inspection, the mills were still assembled on their foundations in their operating
positions. As a consequence, the inspection and audit on the trunnion bearings had to be limited
to a visual observation of the "in –situ" assemblies. The bearing inserts (slippers) could not be
properly inspected or evaluated.

The same would apply to the trunnions and trunnion liners.

Overall the condition of both of the mills and components seemed to be in quite good condition
with the following observations made on each component.

The same would apply to the trunnions and trunnion liners.

1. Mill Shell and Head Sections

Observations

The mill shell and heads appear to be in a visually good condition, with no obvious areas of
washout present.
The rubber lining that was still inside appeared to have "bubbled" in some areas, and also some
ripping was present.
All liner boltholes appear to be uniform and round with no ovaling present.

Recommendations

• It is advisable for the rubber lining to be removed from the shell and then be thoroughly
inspected further. Once this is completed the mill shell should be sandblasted and the
heads and shell section re-rubber lined with the correct hardness of rubber.

• It is also highly recommended that an F.E.A. (Finite Element Analysis) be carried out to
not only ensure safe and reliable operation, but to also aid with process calculations and
throughputs.

2. Feed End Assembly

Observations

At the time of inspection the trunnion-bearing cap was still on the bearing and inspection was
limited to the visual one carried out through inspection doors on the bearing cap.
As per the picture below, there was rust present of the journal surface.
It was also noticed that the oil buckets that pour oil onto the journal surface whilst the mill is
turning are currently missing.

There was a significant but not defined wear groove on the inboard side of the trunnion thrust
face, which seemed strange, as there appeared to be ample clearance for the thermal expansion of
the mill, with this being the floating bearing.

Wear Groove on Thrust Face

Rust on Journal Surface

Apart from surface rust on the drip ring, this appeared to be in reasonably good condition. The
same applies to the trunnion liner, but without removing it from the trunnion it would be difficult
to know for sure what it may be like. More importantly the trunnion itself would not be properly
inspected with the after mentioned parts in place.

Recommendations

• Replace both of the trunnion bearing seals as they have perished over time and are now
unusable.

• An overhaul of the high-pressure manual hand jacking pump should be carried out
including the replacement of all seals, "O" rings etc.

• The trunnion journal would require all of the surface rust removed from it insuring that it
is brought back to its smooth and flat operating surface.

• It is very much advisable that the trunnion-bearing insert is replaced since the mill has
been seating on it for the last six (6) to seven (7) years without turning. This gives a real
possibility of permanent distortion and in-bedding to be present in the Babbitt ("white
metal").

• The two (2) clear inspection covers on the bearing cap will also require replacing as they
have become brittle with cracks present in them.

• The trunnion liner should be removed from the assembly, so that the machined seats for
trunnion liner, trunnion seal and trunnion internals are exposed for proper inspection for
wear and washout.

• Once this is completed, new hardware and seals should be used to fix the trunnion liner
back into position correctly.

• It would also be advisable that the feed spout seal is replaced preventing spillage once the
mill is back in operation.

3. Discharge End Assembly

Observations

At the time of inspection the trunnion-bearing cap was still on the bearing and inspection was
limited to the visual one carried out through inspection doors on the bearing cap.
It could be noticed that the inboard thrust face of the bearing appeared to have a wear mark on it,
most likely due to the axial forces of the mill from the pinion whilst in operation.

• Prior to the re-installation of the discharge trunnion liner, it should be re-rubberized
together with the transition piece.

4. Trommel screen

Observations

The trommel screen has been removed from off of the mill and was in the lay-down yard at time
of inspection. The spiral is partially displaced internally and the rubber protection has perished
very badly and is peeling off.

The machined mounting flange has some bad corrosion present and also the rubber lining that
protects the outer stiffening bars has perished and requires to be replaced.

Prior to the re-installation of the discharge trunnion liner, it should be re-rubberized
together with the transition piece.

Recommendations

• The machined surface of the mounting flange should be checked for flatness and
skimmed if necessary.

• The rubber-protected surfaces should be sandblasted inspected and re-rubberized.

• The screen spiral should be repaired and properly re-assembled. The screen wire mesh
should be replaced with the size suitable for the new process requirements.

5. Base plates

Observations

Following base plates were available for inspection:

• Inching drive base plate
• Gear reducer base plate
• Pinion assembly base plate
• Motor base plates

All the machined surfaces on all the base plates are generally rusty with a substantial amount of
rust present on the machined surfaces. The inching drive base plate/frame seems to be in a good
condition except for the deteriorated paint.

The main trunnion bearing base plates were not available for inspection since the mill was still in
its original position, as was the pinion base plate.

Recommendations

• All the base plates should be checked for flatness and machined if necessary.

• All the downsides of the base plates should be sandblasted removing all of the corroded
spots to allow better adhesion once the grout is poured.

• Recommended that all new leveling blocks (sub-sole plates) are used during re-
installation.

• It would be advisable that all of the adjusting bolts be replaced, or remove them, clean all
of the threads on them and the base plates to reduce any threads binding up once the
alignments begin.

• There is also an additional option of inserting machined wedges between the adjusting
bolt blocks and the bearing housings to reduce the chances of movement of the
components once the mill is in operation.

• All the base plates should be checked for flatness and machined if necessary.

• All the downsides of the base plates should be sandblasted removing all of the corroded
spots to allow better adhesion once the grout is poured.

6. Girth Gear

Observations

The girth gear has been operated in both directions already with one operating flank in
significantly better condition than the other one.

There is clear evidence that the gear set had been operated with insufficient backlash and root
clearance, which resulted in a "concave" effect on the tooth flank and loss of the gear profile.
Also there is heavy pitting and some spalling present on the same side that was run with the
insufficient backlash.

The worse side of the gear flank is shown in the following picture:

The other side of the gear flank shows signs of something hard and solid going through the mesh
all the way around the gear. It is shown in the form of a deep indentation approximately 15 mm in
from the right hand side as the gear as it is operating out of mesh.

Also there is heavy pitting and some spalling present on the same side that was run with the

clearance, which resulted in a "concave" effect on the tooth flank and loss of the gear profile.
Also there is heavy pitting and some spalling present on the same side that was run with the

Both sides of the girth gear flanks have been heavily ground, including the tips which were
relieved excessively. In some cases the tips are nearly rounded completely over losing some
strength.
The gear-split joints appear to be in a good condition as well as the mud rings and bolt -holes.

Recommendations

• Full 100% NDT (Non Destructive Testing) of the girth gear.
• That the girth be hand ground to remove any high spots and try to re-establish a flat

surface during the re-installation of the mill.
• Use the better side of the gear for operation when the mill is re-erected.
• Install all the new hardware for the gear-split joints.
• Install all new gear to head/shell mounting hardware using the correct torque methods.
• Remove the radial adjusting bolts, clean all of the threads and check  that they are all free

and easy prior to installing the gear to the mill.

7. Pinion Assembly

Observations

The pinion gear is in good condition with some heavy grinding marks clearly visible in the root
area of the gear. Again this gear is in much better condition running one direction than in the
other.

Heavy Grinding Marks

Recommendations

• That the pinion is lightly hand buffed to remove any high spots prior to re-installation.
• That both pinion bearings, seals etc be replaced and the housings checked for size and

also concentricity.
• Full NDT (Non Destructive Testing) of the gear and shaft sections.

8. Girth Gear Guard

Observations

In general, the gear guard is in a good condition and only requires some minor changes to bring
back to a good condition.

Recommendations

• All the gear guard segments should be properly sandblasted and re-painted, this is not
only for cosmetic reasons but also for rust prevention at a later stage of its operating life.

• The gear guard seals should be replaced with new rubber seals or a retrofit carried out to
accommodate the new style that is currently being installed on new mills today.

NOTE:

• It is recommended that the gear spray system be modified in such a way that
girth gear is lubricated directly from a spray bar mounted through the gear
guard above the pinion, rather than the pinion directly, as per the below
picture.

9. Gear Reducer and Clutch Assembly

Observations

This drive arrangement consists of a Hansen gear reducer together with an Eaton Air flex clutch.
Without removing the inspection covers and carrying out a full internal inspection of the gear
reducer, it would be hard to determine what real condition it is in, in regards to the bearings, gears
etc.
It had been reported from when the mill was in operation that there were issues with the high-
speed Falk coupling. This could be linked to a number of contributing factors ranging from
lubrication, coupling gaps or mis-alignment issues.

The Eaton Air Clutch was still assembled on the gear reducer as it was whilst in operation and
there had been some NDT (Non Destructive Testing) carried out on the spider hub.

It could be clearly seen on the side plates that they were now slotted where the torque bars locate
due to running out of axial mis-alignment.
Also the airlines seem to have perished out in the weather.

Recommendations

Hansen Gear Reducer

• The Hansen gear reducer should be returned to the OEM (Original Equipment
Manufacturer) for a complete inspection and overhaul to bring back to its original
supplied condition.

• The gear reducer oil cooling system should also be inspected, overhauled and tested by
the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).

• The rotating union on the NDE side of the high-speed shaft should be replaced to ensure
that reliability is maintained whilst in operation.

• The Falk high-speed coupling should be changed as there is some signs of wear from
when it was operation previously.

Note:

There is a spare gear reducer for this drive arrangement on site that should also be sent back to
the OEM for a full inspection/overhaul and be utilized as a spare.

Eaton Air Flex Clutch

• Both the clutch drum and spider should be 100% NDT (Non Destructive Tested) to check
for fractures that may have occurred during operation.

• All of the torque bars should be replaced as should the air tube (air bladder).
• Both side plates should be changed, as the carrying holes are now oval in shape.
• All of the airlines should be replaced complete with the fittings to ensure no leaks

propagate. Also there were only two (2) outlets used on the spider hub to distribute the air
to the air tube, this should be changed so that all four (4) of the outlets are utilized.

General Observations

• All bolting hardware should be replaced on the mill and its drive components etc with
new ones, especially on the rotating element and torqued using the correct procedures as
per Metso Minerals recommendations.

• The existing lubrication system should be replaced with a new one suitable for the new
operating parameters and location.

• Engineering research is highly recommended on the girth gear/pinion capabilities and
loadings considering intended increase of the nominal power to 1.5 Megawatts.

• Main motor drive should be sent to the OEM for a complete inspection and possible
refurbishment to bring back up to standards and therefore provide reliability once in
operation.

10. Mill Shell and Heads

Observations

Both of the heads and the shell appear to be in good condition on the inside apart from some
elongation in the shell liner boltholes. The liners were still installed on both heads, which made it
difficult to see the condition of the head surfaces.

The horizontal split shell flanges appear to be in a good condition, with no signs at all of leakage
or bolt breakage.

Both of trunnion to head flanges are also in a good condition, with no signs of leakage or bolt
breakage.

Liner Bolt Hole Elongation

Recommendations

• The remaining head liners should be removed and the mill shell and heads properly
inspected for washout etc.

• Sandblasting and re-rubberizing should be carried out to the internal mill shell, once this
is completed the small washed sections on the feed end head should be filled flush with
Belzona or similar being sure to follow the same contour as the surrounding areas.

• All of the structural hardware should be replaced with the new ones to ensure integrity.
• It is highly recommended that an F.E.A. (Finite Element Analysis) be carried out to not

only ensure safe and reliable operation, but to also aid with process calculations and
throughputs.

• Sandblasting and re-painting of the outside surfaces could be done for purely cosmetic
purposes only.

• The ovaled and out of shape liner boltholes should be repaired to ensure that a good seal
is made between the liners and mill shell. The preferred method is by boring the holes out
to a larger diameter and fitting steel bushes.
Although it is common to see rubber washers and sleeves fitted on other mills to alleviate
this problem, it is not as simple with a SAG Mill as the weights and forces are much
greater and combined with steel liners this has been unsuccessful in the past.

11. Feed End Assembly

Observations

The mill was still supported by the trunnion bearings at the time of inspection, so the bearing
inserts could not be exposed for inspection. Also there was limited access to the bearing pedestals
due to the final phases of the deconstruction project taking place as far as the mills were
concerned.

The mill has been in the same position for last six (6) to seven (7) years in the bearings without
turning.
It was reported that there were many problems with the feed end trunnion bearing whilst the mill
was in operation, however the problem was not elaborated on at the time of inspection.

During removal of the feed end trunnion from the feed head, the outer trunnion flange was
damaged by a way that there was now a cracked section right the way through the casting.

The feed end trunnion bearing was supported by a "sandwhich" base-plate with a one end hinged
and a load cell on the other. Its functionality and condition at this stage is unknown.

Recommendations

• It is advised that the bronze insert be replaced as the mill has been sitting on these
bearings for a long time without being turned or the mill lifted to allow them to relax,
possibly resulting in deformation and distortion. These would be kept as emergency
spares if new bearings were purchased.
However they could be checked for concentricity, wear, oil wedge clearance and mill lift
to ensure they are of a satisfactory condition to be put back into operation.

• The trunnion journal should be checked for damage, grooves and cleaned free of all rust
to ensure reliable running.

• New trunnion bearing seals would be required
• The feed end base plate with the load cell should be discarded and replaced with a

standard base plate. Process parameters could be observed and controlled through the
lubrication system.

• All of the rusty surfaces should be cleaned back.
• A new sand-wheel should be manufactured and installed.
• It is recommended that the bolt holes on the feed end trunnion flange be re drilled to

accommodate fitted bolts and a heavier drip ring installed to aid as somewhat of a
stiffening device for this high-low bearing design.

inspected for possible wear and washout. If there is any noted it may be necessary to
thickness test by way of ultra sonic measuring.

• The discharge trunnion liner should be sand blasted and re-rubberized. The machined
surfaces/flanges should be checked and cleaned prior to reinstallation.

• The transition piece (trunnion liner to trommel) should also be sandblasted and re-
rubberized.

Trommel Screen

• The machined surface of the mounting flange should be checked and skimmed if
necessary.

• The rubber-protected surfaces should be sandblasted, inspected and re-rubberized for
protection once back in operation.

13. Base Plates

Observations

In general, all the base plates seemed to be fine. However there was a "dummy" plate in between
the gear reducer and main base plate to allow for a different size gear reducer in the past.

Recommendations

• All the base plates should be checked for flatness and machined if necessary.

• That a new base plate is manufactured to accommodate the gear reducer being used rather
than a "dummy base plate".

• All the downsides of the base plates should be sandblasted removing all of the corroded
spots to allow for better adhesion once the grout is poured.

• Recommended that all new leveling blocks (sub-sole plates) be used during re-
installation.

• It would be advisable that all of the adjusting bolts be replaced, or remove them, clean all
of the threads on them and the base plates to reduce any threads binding up once the
alignments begin.

• There is also an additional option of inserting machined wedges between the adjusting
bolt blocks and the bearing housings to reduce the chances of movement of the
components once the mill is in operation.

14. Girth Gear

Observations

The girth gear appears to be in quite good condition, even though both operating flanks have been
used and again one flank is in better than the other.

The split joints are also in a good condition as are the mud rings although there was some
warping in two (2) sections most likely occurring during the removal.
There has been some scuffing in the past and some very small signs of spalling but nothing
detrimental as such.

Minor Signs of Spalling

Recommendations

• Full 100% NDT (Non Destructive Testing) of the girth gear.
• That the girth be hand ground to remove any high spots and try to re-establish a flat

surface during the re-installation of the mill.
• Use the better side of the gear for operation when the mill is re-erected.
• Install all the new hardware for the gear-split joints.
• Install all new gear to head/shell mounting hardware using the correct torque methods.

15. Pinion Assembly

Observations

Existing pinion was in a rather questionable condition with what seemed to be a wear step on
both operating flanks.
It was later reported that the pinion teeth were machined again after some years of running to
remove some defects, be it spalling etc a further 2.00mm.

The pinion bearings, seals etc were still on the shaft and wrapped in plastic.

Recommendations

• That a new pinion is purchased, this was also acknowledged and agreed with by the client
during the teleconference call Metso Minerals Australia.

• The existing pinion should be utilized as an emergency spare.
• That the pinion teeth are hardness tested and aswell as crack tested.
• Pinion bearing housings should be properly refurbished, checked for correct dimensions

and concentricity.

16. Girth Gear Guard

Observations

In general, the girth gear guard is in a good condition and would need only some minor changes
to bring back to a good condition. There is, like the ball mill guard some perished rubber that will
be required to be replaced to ensure that the risk of contamination onto the gear is minimized.

Recommendations

• All the gear guard segments should be properly sandblasted and re-painted, this is not
only for cosmetic reasons but also for rust prevention at a later stage of its operating life.

• The gear guard seals should be replaced with new rubber seals or a retrofit carried out to
accommodate the new style that is currently being installed on new mills today.

NOTE:
• It is recommended that the gear spray system be modified in such a way that

girth gear is lubricated directly from a spray bar mounted through the gear
guard above the pinion, rather than the pinion directly.

17. Gear Reducer

Observations

This gear reducer that has been used in this arrangement was manufactured by David Brown.
Without looking at the internals of this gear reducer it is very hard to give an accurate description
of its current condition.

The high-speed Falk coupling that is currently installed has a history of causing problems most
likely due to alignment and lubrication issues and subsequently has some wear signs showing on
the faces gear spline.

General Observations

• All bolting hardware should be replaced on the mill and its drive components etc with
new ones, especially on the rotating element and torqued using the correct procedures as
per Metso Minerals recommendations.

• The existing lubrication system should be replaced with a new one suitable for the new
operating parameters and location.

• Engineering research is highly recommended on the girth gear/pinion capabilities and
loadings considering intended increase of the nominal power to 1.5 Megawatts.

• Main motor DC drive motor should be sent to the OEM for a complete inspection and
possible refurbishment to bring back up to standards and provide therefore provide
reliability once in operation.

A - 1.0 SITE CHARACTERISTICS 

A - 1.1 LOCATION AND ACCESS  

The Inata Gold Project lies within the Belahouro permit, close to the Mali-Burkina Faso 
border in the northernmost part of Burkina Faso.  The central part of the permit lies 
approximately 220 km NNE of the capital, Ouagadougou and the nearest large city is 
Dijbo, 60 km to the South-West.  

Access is by gravel road from Ouagadougou to Kongoussi and Djibo (200 km) or by 
bitumen road from Ouagadougou to Ouahigouya (180 km) then to Djibo by 110 km of 
gravel road.  The Belahouro camp site can be accessed by driving east from Djibo along 
the Dori Road, for approximately 60 km, then north along a gravel road for 18 km to the 
village of Belahouro.  Crossing the permit area is possible along village tracks or through 
open country as most areas are open grassland or low shrub. Access to large drainages 
is difficult due to dense vegetation and deep drainage erosion.  

Figure 1.1 below presents the general location of the project area.

A - 1.2 CLIMATE 

The project site is located south of the Sahara desert at approximate coordinates 
158 8000 north and 682 200 west.  The regional climate is strongly influenced by the 
Sahara and is defined as a semi-tropical environment of Soudanien type, characterised 
by one distinct wet season between May and September and one dry season.  During 
November to January the Harmattan winds mobilise fine dust from the Sahara creating 
cool and dry conditions.

The meteorological data used for the project site feasibility study are discussed in later 
sections of this report. 

A - 1.3 VEGETATION   

The predominant vegetation comprises sparse low lying bush containing Acacia and the 
occasional Baobab tree.   Very little subsistence farming is evident with the exception of 
migratory grazing of goats and cattle.   

A - 1.4 GEOLOGY 

A - 1.4.1 General Geology & Mineralisation 

The Inata Project is located in the western portion of the Birimian Djibo Greenstone Belt.  
The belt has undergone regional lower greenschist metamorphism and is comprised of 
intermediate to mafic volcano-sedimentary successions and syn- to post-kinematic 
granite and gabbro intrusions.  Further emplacement of dolerite and felsic-porphyry has 
also occurred during and after mineralizing events.  

Gold within the Inata Project is exclusively associated with mesothermal vein style 
mineralization, entirely consistent with the majority of Archaean and Proterozoic terrains 
worldwide, including the Birimian Series of West Africa.  This style of mineralization is 
generally associated with regionally metamorphosed terrains that have experienced 
considerable deformation.  As such, the deposits are invariably strongly structurally 
controlled, with the dominance of structural control increasing proportionally with 
metamorphic grade.  

The principal gold mineralization within the area is confined to the Inata and the Fete 
Kole and Souma trends.  The three Inata deposits (North, Central and South) are located 
over a strike length of 4 km. The deposits appear to be related to the same mineralizing 
event and are associated with shearing. The Inata Central and Inata South deposits 
occur on the same mineralized zone, separated by intermittent low grades and cross-
faults.  Inata North lies some 300 m west of the Inata Central-South trend.  The shear 
zone encompassing the Inata deposits strikes north-northeast and dips steeply to the 
west-northwest.  Gold occurs as free grains and sulphides associated with quartz veins 
or silicified rocks.  

The Damba-Inata volcano-sedimentary province lies within the western third of the 
tenure. The Belahouro-Sona Basin occupies the central third, whilst the Feto Kole 
volcanic province is located in the eastern third.  

The Damba-Inata volcano-sedimentary province is dominated by metasediments 
(epiclastics) with lesser basaltic to andesitic volcanics. The province contains multiple 
granitoid intrusions. The regional foliation trend is north-east.  

The Belahouro-Sona basin is dominated by metasediments, generally turbiditic, with 
minor intermediate volcaniclastics. The southern part is traversed by an east-west shear 
zone. South of this zone, lithotypes are andesites, shales and chert.

The Fete Kole volcanic province is a complex of rhyodacitic, dacitic, andesitic and 
basaltic volcanics with associated pyroclastics and epiclastics. Within the volcanics, both 
pre-tectonic and syn- to post-tectonic granitoids occur. The last major intrusive phase is 
a differentiated gabbro complex. The gabbro has intruded mainly into the volcanic 
package. At the base of the gabbro, titaniferous and vanadiferous magnetite banding 
can be found. Associated ultramafic units also occur within the gabbro and volcanic 
package.

A - 1.4.2 Regional Geology 

The Inata Gold Project is located within western environs of the Djibo greenstone belt, 
which comprises volcanic, volcano-detrital and sedimentary formations intruded by syn- 
to post-tectonic granitoids, impacted by metamorphism. 

A detailed analysis of the regional geology is currently outside the scope of this report 
and the reader is directed to former pre-feasibility studies for the site. 

A - 1.4.3 Local Geology  

The Inata mineralization is located within the Birimian Group of rocks of the Proterozoic 
age, close to the contact zone between the Turbiditic and Epiclastic sediments (see 
Figure 1.2).  An east-west section through Inata suggests that coarse to fine grained 
epiclastics give way to a sedimentary association comprising black shales, pelites and 
chert bands.  The contact zone between the volcano-sediments and sediments is 
defined by a silicified shear zone.

Preliminary pit geotechnical work was completed by George Orr and Associates Pty Ltd 
in August 1999, a summary of which is provided in their report 'Belahoura Gold Project, 
Burkina Faso, Inata North and Inata Central Deposits – Preliminary Geotechnical 
Assessment'. 

In summary, the oxide rock mass is extensively sheared and is expected to be highly 
weathered and dry. The wall rocks were judged to be of 'very poor' to 'poor' quality, 
reflecting the weak nature of the rock and the presence of numerous structural 
geological defects. 

Further geotechnical work, in particular related to the TMF site foundation materials is 
currently underway and is expected to be completed during September 2007. 

A - 1.5 HYDROLOGY & HYDROGEOLOGY 

A - 1.5.1 TMF Site 

The selected location for the proposed TMF lies to the east of Inata North Pit.  Two 30 m 
cored boreholes were proposed at the TMF site, one located within the footprint of the 
dam embankment and the second within the footprint of the tailings inundation area.  
However, due to extreme weather conditions and poor access to the site during the site 
visit of July 2007, both boreholes are yet to be completed.  Seven trial pits were 
excavated on the footprint of the TMF to a depth of approximately 2.0 m.  All were found 
to be dry.  

In addition to the trial pits, four permeameter tests were undertaken in the near surface 
soil zone. Each of the tests was conducted over a maximum 12 hour period.  The results 
are presented in Table 1.1 below.

Although there is no hydrogeological information from beneath the proposed TMF site, 
there is some information from the adjacent open pits as a result of the RC drilling 
undertaken for mineral exploration.  According to George Orr and Associates (2007), the 
RC drilling at the Inata pits carried out by Goldbelt identified groundwater at depths of 
110 – 160 mbgl. In addition a number of shallower occurrences (20-60 mbg) of 
groundwater were noted in a number of RC holes during optical televiewer surveys.

George Orr and Associates (2007) was of the opinion that groundwater inflows would be 
expected to take place from geological structures (predominately faults and shears) 
located in moderately weathered (transitional) and fresh rocks.  

The interpretation of the available groundwater information is that open pit mining would 
take place predominately in dry ground conditions.  However some groundwater 
seepage or flows are likely to be encountered from depths greater than 20 m and at the 
base of the proposed pits.  

However, during AMEC's site visit in July 2007, discussions with the geologists on site 
overseeing the RC drilling indicated that no groundwater was encountered during drilling 
of the Inata pit. It is currently unclear how groundwater levels are impacted by infiltration 
during the wet season.  

Anecdotal evidence from Dave Wayled, West African Drilling Services (WADS), is that 
the 140 m deep vertical borehole completed at the driller's camp at Inata encountered no 
water.   

Socrege (2005) suggests that with regards to dewatering the Inata pits, groundwater 
abstraction will not be required during the dry season, assuming the pits are a maximum 
of 120 m deep.  During the wet season, groundwater abstraction is anticipated.  

Socrege also suggests that within the environs of Inata, the aquifer system is often 
regarded as a double layered aquifer system comprising a semi permeable reservoir 
overlying a reservoir formed of fissured rock.  The evidence for this interpretation has 
been obtained from the analysis of groundwater samples.  Water sampled from 
boreholes (fracture zone water table) is characterized by a higher level of hardness, a 
moderate-to-high alkalinity, clearer evidence of mineralization, and a pH higher than 6.0, 
sometimes approaching neutrality.  As for water sampled from wells, their pH is 
generally close to 5.0 and their hardness, alkalinity and mineralization is lower. 

Socrege consequently suggests that the aquifer system is likely to have a permeability of 
between "10-6 and 10-10" m/s, with a porosity of less than 5%. 

Consequently with regard to the hydrogeology at the TMF site and due to its proximity to 
Inata North pit it is probable that a similar aquifer system exists beneath the TMF to that 
suggested by George ORR and Associates (2007).  It is possible that there could be a 
near surface aquifer in the top 20 – 60 mbgl.  However the more permeable zones are 
likely to be found within the less weathered fractured and fissured strata at greater 
depth.  This preliminary assessment needs to be confirmed by intrusive investigations 
during the detailed design stage. 

A - 1.5.2 Gomde Barrage Site 

Fourteen (14) trial pits were excavated to a maximum depth of 10 m along the line of the 
barrage (Table 1.2 below).   

Trial pits TP5 and TP6 located topographically in the lowest lying section of the proposed 
barrage site encountered groundwater inflows and as a result were terminated at a depth 
of 7 m and 6 m respectively.  The geological logs of the trial pits, prepared during their

excavation, indicate that groundwater was encountered within the alluvial deposits rather 
than the underlying bedrock. 

All the trial pit logs completed to date for the site are included in Appendix A. 

The trial pits were completed by June 2007, less than 1 month before the beginning of 
the wet season.  This suggests that at the time of excavation, groundwater levels would 
have been at their lowest.

TP13 699425 1597400 10   
TP14 699675 1597400 10   

 

During excavation, groundwater inflows were not identified in any other trial pits.  This 
was confirmed by AMEC during a site visit on the 12th July 2007 where TP7 to TP13 
were inspected and no groundwater was observed.  

In addition to the 14 trial pits, three 30 m boreholes were planned to be drilled 
immediately downstream of the proposed barrage to investigate the hydrogeological and 
geotechnical conditions of the site.  Due to the heavy rains experienced during the July, 
access for the drill rig to the sites was not possible and as a result the boreholes could 
not be completed. 

Based on the preliminary analysis by AMEC and on available information, the underlying 
bedrock groundwater flow at the barrage site is likely to be concentrated within the 
fractured and fissured zone beneath the highly weathered zone. 

As a result of not being able to drill boreholes at the barrage, the depth of the various 
strata, the yields and the hydraulic parameters cannot be determined.  However the trial 
pits completed on site, indicate that groundwater is in the region of 6 mbgl during the dry 
season, although it is envisaged that groundwater levels are likely to rise as a result of 
recharge during the rainy season.

The permeability of the alluvial deposits is likely to be within a similar range to those 
found at the TMF site, i.e., 2x10-6 to 8x10-9 m/sec. 

A - 1.6 SEISMICITY  

There are no known seismic risk assessment studies for the area of the Belahouro 
Project.  However, the map of seismic risk for Africa describes the project area as a zone 
of low seismic risk with seismic acceleration factors lower than 0.04 g. 

Contemporary practice requires that major structures are designed to resist the 
Operating Basic Earthquake (OBE) and Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE).  Based 
on this and in comparison with seismic risk assessments for projects located in areas of 
similar seismic risk in other regions of Africa (Ghana), the values shown in Table 2.3 
below will be used for the different loading conditions in the stability analyses of the dam 
embankments. 

The Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has not been defined due to the lack of a site 
specific seismic hazard assessment.  It is recommended that this assessment is 
completed as part of the detailed design of the project.  Table 1.3 below presents 
estimated values for the ground acceleration used for the MCE on the stability analysis 
of the TMF at Inata.

FEASIBILITY STUDY 

INATA GOLD PROJECT – BURKINA FASO 
JULY 2007 

 

  
 

B - 1.0 TMF DESIGN CRITERIA 

B - 1.1 DESIGN CRITERIA 

The main design criteria used in the definition of a tailings management system for the 
Inata Gold Project are as follows: 

• define a cost effective deposition system for the tailings materials generated as part 
of the beneficiation process. 

• define a flexible disposal system such that reasonable changes in the operation of 
the facility and the characteristics of the tailings can be accommodated. 

• the design should be such that the safety of the structure is guaranteed in case of 
seismic events or extreme rainfall occurrences. 

• compliance with national legislation and international guidelines in respect of 
environmental protection during construction, operation and closure. 

• generate a cost estimate for the construction of the facility and ancillary works with 
accuracy adequate to the level of the study. 

B - 1.2 SITE SELECTION 

As part of the pre feasibility study a site visit was undertaken and various potential sites 
were assessed for the location of the proposed TMF at Inata.  The site selection review 
has addressed the following elements: 

• mitigation of environmental impact;  

• topographical convenience; 

• no significant or zero release; 

• no significant seepage; 

• maximum supernatant reuse; 

• storm water retention; 

• maximum storage availability; 

• optimisation of capital and operating costs; 

• proximity with respect to the mine operations;  

• ease of operation; and 

• ease of expansion. 

Following the 2006 site inspection, AMEC confirmed that the optimum site with respect 
to its economics, location of the mine and process plant site, topography, drainage and 
environmental impact is a TMF located immediately north of the proposed plant site and

east of the Inata North open pit.  This site is one of those identified during the pre 
feasibility study stage, as the optimum for a dry stack facility. 

B - 1.3 TAILINGS DISPOSAL METHOD SELECTION 

Three alternative discharge systems are available for the deposition of tailings residue 
as described in the following subsections. 

B - 1.3.1 Filter Cake Disposal 

The tailings stream is passed through additional thickeners and/or pressure belt filter 
systems to dewater the total product to the optimum moisture content.  Following 
stockpiling adjacent to the process plant, the cake tailings is delivered to the deposition 
area for discharge by either articulated truck or a dedicated overland conveyor system. 

B - 1.3.2 Paste/Thickened Tailings Disposal 

The tailings stream is discharged via additional thickeners to increase the pulp density to 
at least 70% solids by weight.  Tailings are then pumped to the depository by positive 
displacement pumps where discharge is undertaken by either co-disposal with stripped 
overburden or rockfill waste from the mining operations, or discharged from a series of 
open end discharge points to form a natural cone-shaped depository. 

B - 1.3.3 Slurry Disposal 

Discharge of the unthickened total tailings stream at the process plant pulp density (45% 
solids by weight) and delivery via a centrifugal pumping system to the TMF for sub-aerial 
deposition. 

Disposal at the depository could be completed via the following methods: 

• open end pipes; 

• a series of spigots or spray bars; 

• cyclones. 

B - 1.3.4 Ranking Study 

The main environmental impact of a TMF is defined as being derived from two sources: 

• the uncontrolled escape of effluent and solids by seepage and run-off; and 

• wind erosion of the tailings solids from the surface.  

Operation of a thickened discharge system will reduce the size of the supernatant pond, 
provided the solution recovered from the thickener is returned directly to the process 
plant.  A small supernatant pond has the advantage that the potential for ground 
seepage is reduced by virtue of its small impounded area.   

A conventional slurry facility will have a significantly larger supernatant pond, the size of 
which will be controlled by returning up to 100% of the process plant requirements.  The 
hydraulically discharged fine tailings will be transported to the supernatant pond where it

FEASIBILITY STUDY 

INATA GOLD PROJECT – BURKINA FASO

will settle out and gradually increase in depth.  The resultant increased imposed load on 
underlying layers leads to consolidation and a decrease in tailings permeability.  As 
permeability decreases, the potential for seepage from the base of the tailings into the 
foundation is reduced.   

Due to the vulnerability of the tailings to wind erosion, especially during periods of low 
rainfall when the tailings exposed surface becomes dry, fine surface material will be 
susceptible to dusting.  A thickened tailings product will retain its fine fraction within its 
matrix and be less susceptible to dusting.  

The volume and cost of pre-deposition civil earthworks will be higher for a slurry system 
when compared with a thickened approach, as a higher starter embankment is required.  
However, the initial capital expenditure for the thickened tailings delivery system will be 
high due to the requirement for extra process plant thickeners, higher pumping 
specification and the requirement for additional earthmoving plant.   When compared 
with the operational costs for a slurry discharge system, which are typically less than 
those for paste/thickened and cake disposal systems, slurry deposition is the most cost 
effective. 

A preliminary assessment for each tailings disposal method has been undertaken based 
on individual environmental, engineering and operational factors ranked with respect to 
the system's estimated advantages and disadvantages.  A score of 1 is given for 
maximum advantage whereas a score of 3 is used to highlight the least advantageous 
option.

1 – most advantageous, 3 - least advantageous. 
 

The overall score is calculated as the sum of the overall ranking for each criterion, as 
summarised in Table 2.1 and suggests that slurry deposition is the most appropriate 
system for the Inata Gold Project.

B - 1.4 TMF ARRANGEMENT 

The proposed arrangement for the Inata TMF is summarised below to enable an 
assessment of the relative engineering and environmental parameters and including 
engineering, environmental, geotechnical and economic factors as described below. 

B - 1.4.1 Environmental 

The potential for seepage from the dam of potentially contaminated water is minimised 
by the introduction of an appropriate liner system.  The liner system is considered 
essential if a cyanide destruction plant is not considered for the project.  Further studies 
to demonstrate the feasibility and appropriateness of a natural liner have been delayed 
by the adverse conditions on site during the raisy season.   

At this stage, due to the lack of information on the hydrogeology of the site and the 
potential impact on receptors, a HDPE liner system has been assumed as required for 
the project. 

The potential for storm water discharge from the tailings impoundment will be minimised 
by the management of the construction sequence providing maximum freeboard for 
water storage at the beginning of each rainy season in May each year.  As the dam is 
planned to be raised on a yearly basis, it has been planned that the annual embankment 
raise be completed by April each year. 

Tailings dust due to desiccation of the tailings surface will be minimised by the 
continuous deposition of fresh tailings over the surface of the facility.  It is expected that 
some dusting problems might occur in the middle of the dry season but this cannot be 
quantified at this stage. 

B - 1.4.2 Catchment 

The tailings facility for the Inata project will be constructed as a paddock embankment.  
The catchment area for the facility will therefore be equivalent to the area of the tailings 
beach and the tailings pond. 

B - 1.4.3 Location to the Plant Site 

The plant site location is immediately to the south of the facility. 

B - 1.4.4 Embankment 

Due to the high rate of rise of the tailings beach, the necessity of including a liner for the 
upstream face of the embankment, a downstream construction method has been 
adopted for the embankment.   

The embankment will be constructed using selected, non reactive, stripped overburden 
won from the Inata North open pit for the starter and first year of operation, with stripped 
overburden from the Inata Central and Inata South pits to complete the facility. 

Utilisation of approved stripped overburden and tailings to form the TMF is an effective 
co-disposal technique.

INATA GOLD PROJECT – BURKINA FASO 
JULY 2007 

 

  
 

Due to the lack of information on the hydrogeology of the site, a HDPE liner has been 
assumed for the facility and the design of the embankment has been carried out 
accordingly.  However, should a natural liner for the facility be proved feasible, the 
embankment design will need to be reviewed and the ability of the facility to store water 
will need to be tested. 

B - 1.4.5 Geotechnical 

The geotechnical characteristics of the foundation, construction or tailings materials have 
not been determined in detailed and therefore a conservative approach has been 
adopted for the embankment cross section to ensure long term embankment stability. 

B - 1.4.6 Decant 

A supernatant pond confined to the center of the TMF has been planned.  This will 
require the construction and operation of a floating decant equipped with centrifugal 
pumps for the return of the water to the plant.  The floating pontoon for the installation of 
the decant pumps will be movable to ensure fresh clear water from the pond can always 
be pumped to the plant.   

Access to the pontoon will be provided by a walkway constructed over wooden pilons 
which will be raised as required as the tailings beach rises. 

B - 1.4.7 Drainage 

Drainage of the tailings mass will be achieved by the provision of a drainage layer above 
the liner system.  Water collected by the drainage network will be directed to the return 
seepage pond constructed immediately downstream of the eastern wall of the facility. 

In addition to the initial drainage layer, "mebradrain" layers will be installed every four 
vertical metres.  The "mebradrain" will be connected to peripheral drain pipes which will 
direct seepage to the return water system. 

B - 1.4.8 Economics 

Although pre-deposition costs for the slurry tailings facility are high due to the allowance 
for the provisional installation of an HDPE liner system, these will be compensated by 
the avoidance of costs for additional thickening systems and special pumping or 
transportation arrangements.  It is strongly recommended though that the investigations 
required to confirm the necessity or otherwise for the HDPE liner be completed. 

B - 1.4.9 Start-up Operations 

Provision of a water retaining embankment and a suitable liner will enable start-up water 
to be impounded in the tailings facility prior to commissioning.  It is however noticed that 
additional water supply is planned for the project to satisfy start up water requirements. 

B - 1.4.10 Operation: Spigotting 

Spigots will be aligned along the crest of the embankment sections.  A sequential 
deposition pattern will be developed to ensure the uniform rise of the tailings beach and

to ensure that the beach formation follows the guidelines to maximise tailings density 
and minimise dust formation potential. 

B - 1.5 TMF SITE SUITABILITY 

The topographical and geological suitability of the selected site were confirmed by site 
visits undertaken by AMEC during 2006 and 2007.  The topography of the proposed site 
was selected for the placement of a facility to contain dry cake filtered tailings.  However, 
following a recent change in the project's tailings management strategy and the 
completion of a detailed survey of the site, the appropriateness of a TMF to contain 
slurry tailings deposited sub aerially has also been confirmed. 

The geotechnical investigation has not been completed to date, geotechnical testing of 
selected samples is underway in Burkina Faso, and therefore the design of the proposed 
facility has been undertaken using assumed design parameters for similar project sites, 
such that the geotechnical and hydrogeological risks are minimised. 

The area of the project has been characterised as very low risk from a seismic point of 
view and preliminary geotechnical investigations of the TMF area indicate that the 
underlying materials are competent and are not a cause of immediate concern for the 
stability of the TMF.  The geotechnical investigation to ensure the correctness of the 
above assumptions needs to be completed so that this may be confirmed during the 
detailed design stage. 

Similarly, the hydrological investigation has not been completed to date with preliminary 
works completed during a site visit during July 2007 and the full investigation is expected 
to be completed by September 2007.  The final design is dependent on this investigation 
but the preliminary design includes the provision of a HDPE liner to minimise the risk of 
seepage from the facility.   

The dam embankments will be constructed using selected rockfill from the pre stripping 
operations of the Inata North Pit, for the pre-deposition works, and from selected waste 
rock from the open pit operations for the subsequent raises of the embankments.  
Geochemical testing of selected waste rock samples is currently underway to confirm 
what materials present the lowest risk of acid rock drainage (ARD) generation such that 
these materials can be selected for construction of the TMF embankments as well as 
other project facilities.

G - 1.0 ROAD ALIGNMENT 

The following set of photographs describes salient features encountered along the 
proposed road alignment for the Option A access road and which provide an indication 
of the works that will be required to establish an all weather road access to Inata. 

 

 

 

 

Photograph 5.1:  At 158100N, 
682655E, Firm reddish brown 
slightly clayey lateritic Gravel 
with colluvium (fine sandy Silt) 
surface infill. Looking south 
over a 2 m wide gully with 
Galamsy working evident. 

Photograph 5.2:  At 15839000N, 
680695E, on lateritic gravel 
plateau, looking SE Note 
adjacent to Fulani subsistence 
level cultivation.  To be avoided 
when final alignment is 
confirmed.

Photograph 5.3:  At 1580747N, 
677355E, on lateritic gravel 
plateau with Colluvium infill 
(Close to Station 15) Looking 
east towards deserted Fulani 
Village 

Photograph 5.4:  At 1581120N, 
675695E, Plateau.  Looking SW 
over potential laterite plateau 
overlain by Colluvium in low spots 
with Spartan bush growth.  Road 
formation required with gravel 
wearing course (Where natural 
laterite is evident no additional 
material may require to be 
imported).   To be validated.  

Photograph 5.5:  At 1574500N, 
675000E, Bush, light reddish brown 
fine sandy SILT with termite mounds 
(Close to Station 31) Alignment to be 
moved East.  Photograph looking 
South with reddish brown termite 
mounds indicating laterite at depth.  
Road formation will be required with 
and an imported gravel wearing 
course and French Crossing. 

Deserted Fulani Village.

Photograph 5.6:  At 1572970N, 
675005E, Large water erosion 
gully (2 m deep by 8 m wide at 
invert) sand filled 1:1 side slopes 
in firm slightly clayey sandy Silt 
with occasional fine gravel.  
Looking east downstream. Road 
formation required on both banks 
with imported gravel wearing 
course.  Main box culvert structure 
required some 10 m wide with 1.5 
m square sections.  Anticipated 
2m excavation.  GSI required and 
detailed design. 

Photograph 5.7:  At 1568315N, 
672300E, Light reddish brown 
slightly clayey fine sandy Silt, 
termite activity evident within the 
environs and small water erosion 
gullying evident.  Photograph 
looking NE towards gully.  Road 
formation required with imported 
gravel wearing course + French 
Crossing.  Laterite is evident at 
350 mm depth consequently local 
borrow possible.  To be validated. 

Photograph 5.8:  At 1567250N, 
673000E, on side of hill (kopie) 
within lateritic gravel.  Downstream 
of the slope dense slightly clayey 
fine sandy Silt evident, with erosion 
gullies 1.5m wide approx 0.3 m 
deep. Road formation required and 
imported gravel wearing course, 
with the exception of close to the 
toe of the hill.  French Drain may 
be required.

Photograph 5.9:  At 
1563620N, 674321E, Laterite 
plateau with Colluvium infill.  
Edge of dense low bush in 
distance.  Once formation 
completed within the natural 
material, additional laterite 
importation may not be 
required.  To be validated by 
GSI. 

Photograph 5.10:  At 1559125N, 
673675E, Light brown slightly 
clayey Silts & Sands evident 
with occasional gravel (Station 
64 Flagged).  Looking north 
towards dense bush.  Granite 
outcrops some 10 m from this 
point.  Road formation will be 
required with gravel wearing 
course imported from local 
borrow source. 

Photograph 5.11: At 1557748N, 
673465E, At main road interface 
(Dori mile marker 163 km)  
Flagged  Light reddish brown silt 
overlying laterite.  Looking North 
towards road.  Note main road 
built up by approx 1 m in 
elevation.  Formation and gravel 
wearing course (Laterite approx 
300 mm deep below surface so 
local borrow material will be 
available).

SECTION 10 -  REFINING AGREEMENT 

Goldbelt Resources Inata Project 

We thank you for your enquiry regarding the request to provide indicative terms to refine, market and sell 
your doré production. These terms will be subject to verification 60 days prior to the first shipment date and 
are subject to change. 

 
We have compiled the following indicative term sheet in an endeavour to cover all our terms and conditions. 

 
RRL Capability: 
 
Rand Refinery Limited ("RRL") is an integrated precious metals company active in the collection, refining, 

marketing and sale of precious metals, acting as the agent for gold producing mines in Western, Central, East 

and Southern Africa and South America, as well as toll refining on behalf of Bullion Banks active in the Asian 

markets. RRL has been accredited with the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) since 1920. RRL has 

also been accredited as a Good Delivery Referee with the LBMA. 

 

RRL's gold refining capacity is up to 1200 tpa while silver capacity is 180 tpa. It is important to note that RRL 

does not purchase precious metals but will act as your agent in the refining, marketing and sale of such 

metals with immediate settlement of payment on assay finalisation into your nominated bank account. 

 

RRL is committed to maintain the highest safety, security and environmental standards. In doing so, RRL has 

been certified under ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OSHAS 18001. Further to these international standards, RRL 

is subjected to annual audits by BSi. 

 

All precious metals on the premises of RRL are fully insured with Lloyds of London and individual depositor's 

interest is noted in the insurance policy. Our under-writers subject this policy and the security operations at 

RRL to annual scrutiny and audits. 

 

Gold and silver imported into the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of refining and re-export is free from 

any duties and taxes. 

 
Contract Terms 
Doré:                                      Fortnightly shipments of approximately 150kg. 

                                                Au (estimated assay of 90%). A minimum purity of 85% Au is specified. Doré 

of a lower purity will attract an additional refining fee.                                

 

Transport and Security:  There is no additional charge for transportation from Johannesburg 

International Airport to Rand Refinery. This is included in the refining fee.

BS EN ISO 
9001:2000 
FS80050 

  

 
 
 

 
Freight and Insurance:            RRL will arrange for secure freight and insurance, which costs will be for the 

customer's account.. Risk will pass to RRL at the time the doré is handed 

over to and signed for by our preferred shipping agent at mine site. The 
rates quoted below are on a per shipment basis. The option below considers 

that the doré from the Inata project will be shipped alone however in the 

future the possibility exists for co-shipment with the doré from future mines in 

the surrounding area with a resulting reduction in the shipment cost should 

 RRL be the successful tenderer, then these other options will be explored 

further with the other mines concerned. The rates for the "Inata alone" option 

are: 

It is proposed where possible and when local contractors are used, invoicing 

and payment will be made in country, in order for the mine to claim back TVA 

or other statutory charges it may be due under its mining convention. 

 

Minimum Charge USD$ 7015.00/del. 

50kgs   USD$ 4.364/gross oz 

100kgs   USD$ 2.903/gross oz 

200kgs   USD$ 2.193/gross oz 

                          

 

These rates are fully inclusive and cover road pick up, Clearing charges, 

insurance, all documentation and customs Clearance in Johannesburg. 

 

Invoicing for Transporting and Security Services: 

 

                                               All charges and fees payable to RRL in accordance to this proposal shall be 

included in a statement (in US$) from RRL to the customer for each 

shipment. 

 
Accountable Metal:                  Gold  

99.90% of the agreed contained gold, based on the conclusion of the assay 
agreement. 
 
Silver  
95.00% of the agreed contained silver, based on the conclusion of the assay 
agreement. 
 

Weighing, Sampling and Assaying:

BS EN ISO 
9001:2000 
FS80050 

  

 
 
 

                             On arrival at RRL, doré will be weighed, separately melted and sampled and 

then subjected to an initial assay by X-ray fluorescence and assayed by the 

proof corrected fire assay procedure which will determine the fine gold 

content. The maximum acceptable gross weight for a doré bar is 25-28kg. 

The official assay will form the basis of the settlement. The after melt weight 

shall be determined by RRL by weighing on an electronic balance having a 

tolerance of +/- 0.1g. A detailed weighing, sampling and assay procedure will 

form part of the official contract between CGML and RRL. 

Sampling Supervision:             At the customer's request and cost. This can be arranged with one of the 

LBMA approved supervising companies. 

 

Splitting Limits:                         Weight 0.10% 

Assay: Au= 0.15%, Ag=0.20 % 

 

Umpire:                                    When the assay and weight values fall within the splitting limits, metal will 

automatically be released and RRL's assay value will be used for final 

settlement. 

 

When assay results exceed the limits, samples may be submitted to an 

independent umpire at Company's request.  RRL requires at least 72 hours 

written notice. The metal will, however, be automatically released for refining 

and reserve samples retained for the purpose of assay dispute resolution. 

Should umpire results fall within the results of Company's and RRL's assay or 

coincides with either, then the arithmetic mean of the Umpire assay and the 

party closest to the umpire assay shall be final for settlement. Otherwise the 

median of the three shall be taken as final for settlement. The cost of umpire 

analysis shall be borne by the party (CGML or RRL) who is furthest away 

from the umpire result.  

 

Assay Exchange:                     Via secure electronic media or telefax. 

 

Refining Charges:                 US$0.375 per ounce gross dry weight. The refining process used is the Miller 
Chlorination process. 

 

Return of Metal:                     RRL will refine the product to London Good Delivery standard and make such 

Good Delivery bars available for collection loco Germiston within two 

business days after the conclusion of the assay agreement. At this time, title 

will pass from Goldbelt Resources to the purchaser, usually a bullion bank.

Should Goldbelt Resources request delivery of the refined gold and silver 

loco London, RRL will honour such request also within two business days at 

the following additional charges: 

  

                                                 Au – US$0-25 per troy ounce fine 

                                               Ag – US$0-15 per troy ounce fine 

 

Advance Payment:                  Should Goldbelt Resources request advance payment (99% of the value of 

the contained gold) on collection of the doré at mine site, based on the mine 

assay and weight, then a financing fee of US$0.01 per day will be charged 

until the doré has arrived at the refinery, assay conclusion has been reached 

and value given to Goldbelt Resources. 

 

Deleterious Elements:            Penalties will apply should the contained levels of the following deleterious 

elements exceed the levels indicated: 

                                                Iron 2.00%, Copper 10.00%, Zinc 5.00%, Lead 5.00%, Nickel 2.00%, Bismuth 

0.50%, Mercury 0.20%, Arsenic 0.205. 

 

Cadmium is not accepted. Where the above levels are exceeded an 

additional refining fee of US$0.01 will be charged for every 1% or part thereof 

in excess of these levels.         

 

Conditionality:                          Subject to the formalisation of a refining contract between Goldbelt 

Resources and RRL.
