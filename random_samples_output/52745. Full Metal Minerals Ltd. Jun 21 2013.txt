Executive Summary 
The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper molybdenum gold exploration prospect located in 
Alaska, USA. 

This technical report documents the mineral resource estimate for the Pyramid prospect. It was 
prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 
43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines". 

Property Description, Location, Access and Physiography 

The Pyramid Project is located on the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula approximately 
890 km by air southwest of Anchorage, centered on NAD83 coordinate N394450, E6165953 
Zone 4N. The nearest town is the fishing village of Sand Point on Popof Island, 33 km south-
southeast of the Pyramid Project. Access to the property is via a flight from Anchorage to the 
regional airport in Sandpoint. People and supplies are ferried 25 km across the Unga Straight 
separating Sand Point and the camp on Balboa Bay. 

Prominent volcanic geographical references are the Veniaminof Volcano (140 km northeast) and 
the Pavlof Volcanoes (80 km southwest). The project is set in the upper most part of a west 
draining basin that works its way north out to Herendeen Bay and towards Bristol Bay. Elevations 
vary from 150 m in the valley to the south to 850 m at the top of Pyramid Peak. The terrain is 
moderate to steep and sparsely vegetated as much of the work area is considered to be above 
the tree line. Rock scree-talus is commonplace throughout the area and rock outcrop is generally 
sparse. In the lower elevations, minor tundra and low-lying shrubs are present. 

The Pyramid property consists of 38,376 hectares, encompassing an approximately 26 km by 
13 km area. Lands at the project are split into separate surface and sub-surface (mineral) 
ownership. The sub-surface (mineral) rights are held by The Aleut Corporation (TAC), whereas 
the surface rights are held by the Shumagin Corporation in some areas and the Tanadgusix 
Corporation (TDX) in others. A lease agreement was completed on the 30th of June, 2010 
granting Full Metal Minerals and its affiliates conditional exploration rights in specific lands 
outlined in the agreement, particularly lands in the Pyramid Project area. Notably, a separate 
surface lease agreement was obtained with the TDX Corporation in July, 2010. A letter 
agreement was reached with the Shumagin Corporation for lease of eight townships within their 
surface owned estate. The agreements provide Full Metal Minerals access to their surface owned 
lands with the right to conduct mineral exploration and ultimately mining if there is sufficient 
encouragement to proceed. At present there are no outstanding hindrances with respect to land 
status at the Pyramid Project. 

History 

The history of Pyramid dates back to the mid-1970s when geologists from Aluet Corp (TAC) and 
Quintana-Duval Mining identified porphyry copper-molybdenum potential during regional 
reconnaissance along the Alaskan Peninsula. Although Pan American Petroleum was active in

the region during the 1960s, there is no evidence they conducted exploration at Pyramid other 
than possible claim staking. There is no evidence of historic mining or prospecting in the Pyramid 
area, which is relatively uncommon for a broadly mineralized and partly exposed porphyry 
system. 

Quintana-Duval Mining initiated surface mapping and geochemical sampling in 1974, which 
ultimately defined a large area of porphyry-style alteration and copper-molybdenum 
mineralization sufficient to warrant a 1975 drill program. In 1975, Aleut-Quintana-Duval completed 
19 core holes for a total of 1692 m which confirmed the presence of a broad area of copper and 
molybdenum mineralization to a maximum depth of 168 m. The distribution of holes and broad 
Cu-Mo mineralization allowed Aleut-Quintana-Duval to produce a shallow (less than 100 m) 
resource of 126,330,000 tons containing 0.403% Cu and 0.025% Mo with a 0.25% cut-off grade 
(Christie, J. S., 1975). The 1975 program was followed-up in 1976 with a one-hole program, 
placed on a prior site which had poor recovery in the chalcocite enrichment zone; however, the 
results did not indicate higher grades and the entire program was abandoned. 

Minor rock and stream sediment sampling was performed at Pyramid between 1979 and 1991, 
and the exploration was gold oriented, thus most samples were typically analyzed for gold, silver, 
mercury, and arsenic. 

Full Metal Minerals (FMM) and Metallica Resources (Metallica), following completion of a joint 
venture commenced mineral exploration in 2005 along the Alaskan Peninsula using Sand Point 
as a base of operations. The exploration team focused on the Pyramid porphyry copper-
molybdenum deposit in addition to Centennial and Apollo-Shumagin gold deposits. The work at 
Pyramid included completion of five induced polarization (IP) lines and several miles of ground 
magnetics along with opportunistic rock chip sampling and outcrop lithologic-alteration mapping. 
A reported 177 rock chip, 14 silts/stream sediment, and 1 soil samples were collected during the 
2005 season. The samples were analyzed at BSI inspectorate through Alaska Assay 
Laboratories for fire assay gold and 31 elements by aqua regia ICP. During 2006, exploration by 
FMM and Metallica focused upon a rock channel sampling program on continuous exposures in 
one of the principal creeks transecting the Pyramid porphyry system. A total of 113 rock chip 
samples were collected and only analyzed for gold, copper and molybdenum. 

There was no additional exploration conducted on the Pyramid property until Antofagasta entered 
into an Option Agreement with FMM during 2010 and commenced drilling on the Property. 

Geological Setting and Mineralization 

The Pyramid Project is located in the Pacific 'Ring of Fire', in a portion of the arc which contains a 
number of other porphyry copper epithermal gold deposits in addition to hundreds of metal 
occurrences. The project area is located in a volcanic arc setting, approximately 20 km from the 
Pacific-North America convergent plate boundary. The volcanic arc is derived from semi-
continuous tectonic activity and oceanic crust subduction since the Mesozoic and currently 
represented by a chain of nearly 80 volcanoes throughout the Aleutian island chain and Alaskan 
Peninsula.

The Pyramid Cu-Mo mineralization is centered on several late Miocene porphyry intrusions, likely 
quartz diorite in composition, which is hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary 
clastic sedimentary rocks. The intrusive bodies are small (<200 m) stocks or dikes and are 
exposed in an area of at least 2.5 km x 1.5 km largely within an east-west trending glacial valley. 
Available drill hole data suggest that most of these intrusive units occur as vertical bodies but 
existence of smaller sills cannot be ruled out. They have similar mineralogy of plagioclase, biotite 
and amphibole with variable occurrence and abundance of quartz phenocrysts. Texture of the 
rocks varies from small to coarse grained porphyritic to coarse equigranular texture. 

Exploration and Drilling 

In 2010, FMM entered into a joint-venture with Antofagasta Minerals PLC (Antofagasta) to 
explore the Pyramid Project. 

A program of work on the Pyramid Project commenced in August 2010 and to date 30 core holes 
have been drilled on the property for a total of 7485 meters. In addition to drilling, several 
geophysical surveys including ground magnetics and Induced polarization (IP) were conducted 
simultaneously as was continued mapping and prospecting. 

Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 

FMM has used a robust procedure for sampling, sample preparation, analysis and security. 
Assay samples were collected from half core sawed lengthwise with an unbiased sampling 
interval of two meters through the entire length of the drill holes starting at bedrock. Assaying 
protocols include the use of commercial certified control samples, sample blanks and duplicates 
to monitor the accuracy of the laboratory, ALS-Chemex Vancouver or their Reno Nevada 
laboratory. Two assay methods are used; a 30 g fire assay ICP-AES method for gold analysis 
and a 4-acid near total digestion ICP-AES procedure that produces quantitative results for 33 
elements. A pre-determined over limit for copper and molybdenum is prescribed by both FMM 
and Antofagasta. Thus, when copper exceeds 2,500 ppm and/or molybdenum exceeds 200 ppm, 
the sample is automatically analyzed by the higher detection limit AA-OG62 method of analysis. 

Data Verifications 

Exploration data verification for the Pyramid Project has included a site visit by SRK, enforced 
database structures, analytical quality assurance and quality control samples and assay 
checking. 

SRK Associate, Dr. Gilles Arseneau, visited the site in March 2013 to examine drill core, core 
logging and sampling procedures, and view the drill sites. Drill site locations were verified with 
hand-held GPS and were found to agree with the digital database of drill hole locations. 

SRK conducted routine verifications to ascertain the reliability of the electronic borehole database 
provided by FMM and completed an audit of the FMM analytical and quality control data acquired 
during the sampling of the Pyramid deposit. All assays in the current database were verified 
against the independently sourced sample certificates from ALS Laboratories and ActLabs. The

mafic volcanic rocks used as blank sample material naturally contains a higher concentration of 
copper than average crustal rocks and it is recommended that for future programs, FMM source a 
more appropriate material for blank samples. It is also recommended that FMM request re-
analysis of batches of samples which return SRM values greater than three standard deviations 
of the mean. 

After the review, SRK is of the opinion that the Pyramid drilling database is sufficiently reliable for 
resource estimation. 

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

No metallurgical testwork has been completed for the Pyramid deposit. 

Mineral Resource Estimates 

SRK utilized Gemcom's Gems version 6.3.1 to complete the Mineral Resource estimation. A 
comprehensive and validated drill hole database including 49 drill holes was utilized to complete 
the analysis. 

Three domains were modeled: a very low grade leach cap varying between zero to 90 m in 
thickness (not estimated); a supergene enrichment zone below the leach cap with variable depth 
extending to 250 m below surface in some areas and defined by increased chalcocite 
mineralization and higher copper values; and the primary hypogene mineralized zone, with 
copper mainly occurring as chalcopyrite, underlying the supergene zone in most areas. 

The Pyramid resource was estimated using Gemcom's GemsTM (Gems) 3D block modeling 
software in multiple passes in 25 by 25 by 10 m blocks by ordinary kriging. Grade estimates were 
based on capped 2 m composited assay data. Capping levels were set at 1.3% Cu for the 
supergene and 0.83% Cu for the hypogene zone. Mo was capped at 0.1% and 0.08% for the 
supergene and hypogene zones respectively. Gold grades were capped at 4.2 g/t for the 
supergene and 0.215 g/t for the hypogene zone. In calculating the CuEq, SRK Consulting 
(Canada) Inc. utilized the long term metal prices provided by Energy and Metals Consensus 
Forecast (Cu US$ 3.54/lb, Mo US$ 18.23/lb, Au US$ 1,480/oz). The contained copper represents 
estimated contained metal in the ground and has not been adjusted for metallurgical recoveries. 

Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by the Canadian 
Institute of Mining (CIM) as stipulated in NI43-101. All interpolated blocks were classified as 
Inferred Mineral Resource. 

In order to quantify the Mineral Resources requirement of "reasonable prospects of economic 
extraction", the block model was subjected to conceptual mining limits using an open pit 
optimization program. The process uses reasonable mining and processing parameters to define 
a conceptual pit within which the material with reasonable economic prospects should be 
contained. 

The inferred resources for the Pyramid deposit reported at Cu Eq grade of 0.21% are 
summarized in Table 14.11.

contained metal in the ground and has not been adjusted for metallurgical recoveries. All numbers have 
been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Mineral resources are reported in relation to a 
conceptual pit shell. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. Confidence in the estimate of Inferred mineral resources is insufficient to allow the meaningful 
application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of 
public disclosure. 
 

Conclusion and Recommendations 

The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper molybdenum gold exploration prospect located on 
the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula, Alaska, USA. Drilling by FMM and the previous 
owners has identified Cu-Mo mineralization centered on several small late Miocene porphyry 
intrusions, hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary clastic sedimentary rock.  

Mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" guidelines by ordinary kriging using 
Gemcom Gems software. Mineral resources may be affected by further infill and exploration 
drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent resource estimates 

SRK is not aware of any significant risks and uncertainties that could be expected to affect the 
reliability or confidence in the early stage exploration information discussed herein. 

SRK recommends that FMM continues the exploration on the Pyramid Project, specifically, SRK 
recommends that the next exploration phase includes a 5000 m drilling program comprising of 15 
additional drill holes to expand and further delineate the porphyry mineralization. SRK estimates 
that the recommended work program together with support camp will cost $3,674,000.

1 Introduction 
The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper molybdenum gold exploration project, located in 
Alaska, USA. It is located on the southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula approximately 890 km by 
air southwest of Anchorage and 33 km northwest of Sand Point, the nearest town. 

In January 2013, Full Metal Minerals (FMM) commissioned SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) to 
visit the property and prepare a geological model and mineral resource estimate for the Pyramid 
Project. 

This technical report summarizes a mineral resource estimate for the Pyramid Project. Mineral 
resources were classified as Inferred mineral resources following the CIM Definition Standards for 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) guidelines. The report was prepared 
following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and 
Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines". 

The report was compiled by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo., and Darrell Farrow, M.Sc., Pr.Sci.Nat., with 
assistance from Michael Tedeschi of FMM. The information contained in this report was provided by 
FMM. Dr. Arseneau carried out a visit to the Pyramid Project on March 19 and 20, 2013 to examine 
drill core, core logging and sampling procedures, and visit the drill sites. Mineral resources were 
estimated by Darrell Farrow, Pr.Sci.Nat, under the supervision of Dr. Arseneau.

2 Reliance on Other Experts 
In preparing this report, SRK has relied on information provided by FMM for matters pertaining to 
environmental, socioeconomic, and permitting issues. SRK has not performed an independent 
verification of land title and tenure as summarized in Section 3 of this report. SRK did not verify the 
legality of any underlying agreement(s) that may exist concerning the permits or other agreement(s) 
between third parties, but have relied on information provided by Full Metal Minerals. 

SRK was informed by FMM that there are no known litigations potentially affecting the Pyramid 
Project.

3 Property Description and Location 
The Pyramid Project is located 890 km by air southwest of Anchorage, centered on NAD83 
coordinate N394450, E6165953 Zone 4N (Figure 3.1). The main project area is located 
approximately 5 km from the Gulf of Alaska at the tip of the Alaskan Peninsula. The nearest town is 
the fishing village of Sand Point on Popof Island, 33 km south-southeast of the Pyramid Project 
(Figure 3.2). Prominent volcanic geographical references are Veniaminof Volcano (140 km 
northeast) and the Pavlof Volcanoes (80 km southwest). 

The Pyramid property consists of 38,376 hectares, encompassing an approximately 26 km by 13 km 
area. Lands at the project are split into separate surface and sub-surface (mineral) ownership. The 
sub-surface (mineral) rights are held by The Aleut Corporation (TAC), whereas the surface rights are 
held by the Shumagin Corporation in some areas and the Tanadgusix Corporation (TDX) in others. A 
lease agreement was completed on the 30th of June, 2010 granting Full Metal Minerals (FMM) and 
its affiliates, conditional exploration rights in specific lands outlined in the agreement, particularly 
lands in the Pyramid Project area (Figure 3.2). Notably, a separate surface lease agreement was 
obtained with the TDX Corporation in July, 2010. A letter agreement was reached with the Shumagin 
Corporation for lease of eight townships within their surface owned estate. The agreements provide 
FMM access to their surface owned lands with the right to conduct mineral exploration and ultimately 
mining if there is sufficient encouragement to proceed. The mineral resources for the Pyramid 
Project reported herein are located on the Pyramid property comprising the townships listed in 
Table 3.1. At present there are no outstanding hindrances with respect to land status at the Pyramid 
Project.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure 
and Physiography 

4.1 Accessibility 

Access to the property is via a commercial flights from Anchorage to the regional airport in 
Sandpoint. People and supplies are ferried 25 km across the Unga Straight separating Sand Point 
and the camp on Balboa Bay. This occurs either via boat or helicopter. Several miles of existing dirt 
roads exist on the property and date back to 1975 when the first exploration program was conducted. 
An access road from Balboa Bay to the project site also exists and in 2011 minor repairs were made 
to the road making it ATV accessible. Many of the old roads were utilized during the 2012 drilling 
season to reduce additional surface impact. 

4.2 Physiography 

The project is set in the upper most part of a west draining basin that works its way north out to 
Herendeen Bay and towards Bristol Bay. Elevations vary from 150 m in the valley to the south to 
850 m at the top of Pyramid Peak; however, most exploration activities have been conducted in the 
range of 300 m to 600 m. The terrain is moderate to steep and sparsely vegetated as much of the 
work area is considered to be above the tree line (Figure 4.1). Rock scree-talus is commonplace 
throughout the area and rock outcrop is generally sparse. In the lower elevations, minor tundra and 
low-lying shrubs are present. There is also minor alder growth in some of the lower elevations to the 
south. 

4.3 Climate 

Temperatures at nearby Sand Point range from highs near 60°F (15°C) in the summer to lows 
around 20°F (-6°C) in the winter. The daytime and nighttime temperatures vary daily by about 10°F 
(6°C). Precipitation is common; snow from autumn to spring and rain when the temperatures allow it. 
The truncated summer often does not allow for snow to fully melt from winter to winter, although by 
August/September the area of snow cover has often decreased a considerable amount compared to 
the start of the season. The weather is generally unpredictable and typically windy with fronts 
ascending from both the north and south.  

4.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The nearest town is the fishing village of Sand Point which is on the northwest side of Popof Island 
and 33 km south-southeast of the Pyramid Project (Figure 3.2). Sand Point has a population which 
varies from about 2000 in the summer to 1200 in the winter. Commercial fishing is the key industry of 
Sand Point and the surrounding towns of Cold Bay (135 km southwest), King Cove (119 km 
southwest), Nelson Lagoon (50 km north), and Bear Lake (48 km northeast).

5 History 
5.1 Early History 

Exploration, prospecting, and mining in the region dates back to 1882 when coal was identified and 
extracted on Unga Island followed shortly thereafter with the discovery of gold on both Shumagin 
and Unga Islands. Gold mining in 1886 at the Apollo vein on Unga Island is considered the first gold 
mining operation in the state of Alaska. The Apollo produced approximately 112,000 ounces of gold 
between 1886 and 1914 through the extraction of nearly 500,000 tons of free milling rock. 
Approximately 18 km north of Pyramid are Cretaceous aged bituminous coal beds that were 
identified in 1889, though they proved difficult to extract, possibly due to structural complexity.  

The history of Pyramid dates back to the mid-1970s when geologists from Aluet Corp (TAC) and 
Quintana-Duval Mining identified porphyry copper-molybdenum potential during regional 
reconnaissance along the Alaskan Peninsula. Although Pan American Petroleum was active in the 
region during the 1960s, there is no evidence they conducted exploration at Pyramid other than 
possible claim staking. There is no evidence of historic mining or prospecting in the Pyramid area, 
which is relatively uncommon for a broadly mineralized and partly exposed porphyry system. 

5.2 1970 - 1976 

The Quintana-Duval teams initiated surface mapping and geochemical sampling in 1974 which 
ultimately defined a large area of porphyry-style alteration and copper-molybdenum mineralization 
sufficient to warrant a 1975 drill program. Geology, alteration, and sample location maps from 1974 
were geo-referenced and digitized (Figure 5.1). The 1974 exploration was sufficient to identify 
several targets based upon detailed geological and alteration mapping in addition to geochemical 
results from 63 soil, 18 rock, and 11 silt/stream sediment samples (Figure 5.2). All of the samples 
were analyzed for copper, molybdenum, zinc, gold, and silver. 

Quintana-Duval commenced drilling in September 1975. Operations were conducted from a 
Peninsula based camp and an access road was constructed by bull dozer from the head of Balboa 
Bay (Albatross Anchorage) to the Pyramid Project, a road distance of 6.8 km. Upon commencement 
of drilling, two rigs completed 19 core holes for a total of 1692 m (Figure 5.1). One drill rig consisted 
of a skid mounted Longyear 38 which drilled 1163 m of NQ core over 13 holes. The second, a screw-
feed Boyles rig, was a smaller machine that drilled 6 AQ holes for a total of 529 m and was 
transported in part by helicopter or skid.  

The 1975 drilling confirmed the presence of a broad area of copper and molybdenum mineralization 
to a maximum depth of 168.6 m where NQ holes averaged 89.3 m and AQ holes averaged 88.1 m, 
the deepest of which was 135.6 m. The distribution of holes and broad Cu-Mo mineralization allowed 
Quintana-Duval to produce a resource calculation which is stated in the 1975 Pyramid Project report 
by J. S. Christie (Christie, J. S., 1975). The report stated a resource of 126,330,000 tons containing 
0.403% Cu and 0.025% Mo with a 0.25% cut-off grade. This resource was based upon drill hole 
geochemistry and calculation of 17 polygonal blocks to produce tonnage. The estimated resource is 
shallow at less than 100 m and was indicated to have potential to grow at depth. An additional 
48,800,000 potential tons was also calculated based upon a favorable undrilled area, though no 
grade was predicted. These results are historic in nature from work completed prior to 2001 and NI

43-101 standards and should not be relied upon. The 1975 program was followed-up in 1976 with a 
one-hole program, placed on a prior site which had poor recovery in the chalcocite enrichment zone. 
However, the results did not indicate higher grades and the entire program was abandoned.

5.3 1979-1991 

Gold exploration was active throughout the region between 1979 and 1991 by various companies 
including Resource Associates of Alaska (RAA), Battle Mountain Gold, Bear Creek, Teck, and 
Cominco (Van Wyck, et al, 2005). Exploration consisted of broad reconnaissance –style rock, stream 
and soil sampling programs and some drilling, though no significant deposits were identified. It 
should be noted that only minor rock and stream sediment sampling was performed at Pyramid 
during this time, and the exploration was gold oriented, thus most samples were typically analyzed 
for gold, silver, mercury, and arsenic. Historic databases contain sparse metal or trace element 
geochemistry. 

5.4 2003-2006 

Alaska Earth Resources, Inc. (AERI) successfully negotiated a mineral exploration lease with two 
Peninsula native corporations in 2003: BBNC (Bristol Bay Native Corporation) and The Aleut 
Corporation (TAC). The Pyramid Project sits entirely within TAC mineral lands and a combination of 
surface lands dominated by the Shumagin Corporation and to a lesser degree by the St Paul

Tanadgusix Corporation (TDX). Full Metal Minerals (FMM) examined the property in 2004 and 
subsequently optioned the lease from AERI. 

FMM and Metallica Resources (Metallica), following completion of a joint venture, commenced 
mineral exploration in 2005 along the Alaskan Peninsula using Sand Point as a base of operations. 
The exploration team focused on the Pyramid porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit in addition to 
Centennial and Apollo-Shumagin gold deposits. The 2005 program consisted of reconnaissance-
style mapping, surface sampling, ground geophysics, and examination of the Apollo-Shumagin 
epithermal gold vein systems. The work at Pyramid included completion of five induced polarization 
(IP) lines and several miles of ground magnetics along with opportunistic rock chip sampling and 
outcrop lithologic-alteration mapping. A reported 177 rock chip, 14 silts/stream sediment, and 1 soil 
samples were collected during the 2005 season (Figure 5.2). The samples were analyzed at BSI 
inspectorate through Alaska Assay Laboratories for fire assay gold and 31 elements by aqua regia 
ICP. Recommendations for additional work at Pyramid were made for the 2006 season, including 
drilling four holes totaling 914 m. 

A remote sensing study was undertaken in late 2005 over the Pyramid area and surrounding areas 
(Figure 5.3). The study examined several band widths from land satellite imagery, and through 
filtering, identified the following minerals: sericite, kaolinite pyrophyllite, illite, jarosite, and alunite. 
Most of these minerals are associated with porphyry copper systems and are present in or peripheral 
to Pyramid. The work was contracted to and conducted by Ming-Ho Du Image2Map Services Inc. 

During 2006, exploration by FMM and Metallica focused upon a rock channel sampling program on 
continuous exposures in one of the principal creeks transecting the Pyramid porphyry system. This 
program was recommended by consultant John Proffett who conducted a one-day visit to the 
property and suggested a line of continuous channel sampling along a well exposed creek segment 
might represent a horizontal drill hole. The crew collected 113 rock chip samples and only analyzed 
for gold, copper, and molybdenum. 

No drilling was completed on the property since a surface exploration agreement was not completed 
with the Village Corporations. However, a review of the historic drill core was undertaken at the 
Alaska Materials Archive Center in Eagle River, AK. This review was conducted by Joanna Lispke 
and Joel Rotert and compiled into a separate report. Based upon the positive core review report and 
surface sampling, a drill program was recommended for the following season. 

There was no additional exploration conducted on the Pyramid property until Antofagasta entered 
into an Option Agreement with FMM during 2010 and commenced drilling on the Property.

6 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
6.1 Regional Geology 

The Pyramid Project is located in the Pacific 'Ring of Fire', a portion of the arc which contains a 
number of other porphyry copper epithermal gold deposits in addition to hundreds of metal 
occurrences. The project area is located in a volcanic arc setting, approximately 20 km from the 
Pacific-North America convergent plate boundary. The volcanic arc is derived from semi-continuous 
tectonic activity and oceanic crust subduction since the Mesozoic and currently represented by a 
chain of nearly 80 volcanoes throughout the Aleutian island chain and Alaskan Peninsula.  

The Alaska Peninsula is comprised of arc-related volcanic and plutonic rocks intermixed with marine 
and minor continental sedimentary rocks that date to the late Paleozoic (Figure 6.1). Exposed 
Peninsula basement lithologies have both accretion and continental origins, derived from a long 
complex tectonic history. Regional mapping has labeled lithologic boundaries by structural 
components such as thrust faults, normal faults, strike-slip faults, intrusive contacts, and 
unconformities. Thrust and strike-slip faults are principally derived from compressional and 
transpressional tectonism, some as deeply rooted long lived structures. This is typical of structural 
preparation in conjunction with arc-related subduction and is partly responsible for the genesis of the 
Pyramid porphyry center. 

The sedimentary rocks throughout the range of the Alaskan Peninsula are dated from the upper 
Triassic through the Pliocene with a good percentage represented by the Jurassic through Tertiary. 
Collectively, the entire sedimentary stratigraphic column consists of roughly 800 m of upper Triassic, 
6,424 m of Jurassic, 5,825 m from the Cretaceous, and 8,131 m contained within the Tertiary for an 
aggregate total of about 21,180 m (Detterman, et al, 1974). The most dominant rock types are 
siltstone, sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, with lesser amounts of tuffs and lavas, limestone, 
mudstone, and non-marine coal. Tuffs and lava material are found prominently within much of the 
Tertiary formations whereas the limestone and non-marine coal is confined to the Cretaceous and 
older.  

Examination of Port Moller 1:250.00 quadrangle reveals fewer overall exposed sedimentary 
formations with the following being most dominant with measured thickness: 

Tertiary 

• Stepovak Formation (2030 m) 

• Tolstoi Formation (660 m) 

Cretaceous 

• Chignik Formation (490 m) 

• Hoodoo Formation (630 m) 

• Shumagin Formation (3000 m) 

  



SRK Consulting 
Technical Report for the Pyramid Project    Page 29 

DJF/GA_hd Pyramid_2CF012.000_Technical Report_DJF_GA_MN_20130621 June 2013 

Jurassic 

• Northeast Creek Member (Naknek Fm), (614 m) 

• Snug Harbour Siltstone Member (Naknek Fm), (625 m) 

• Indecision Creek Sandstone (Naknek Fm), (870 m) 

The Jurassic rocks, likely by virtue of a longer history, are more deformed and becomes better 
exposed on the northern side of the Peninsula. Should a continuous sequence be exposed of the 
above sedimentary rocks, there would be roughly 8,920 m of sediments present within the Port 
Moller/general Pyramid area. 

 
Figure 6.1: Regional Geology Setting 



SRK Consulting 
Technical Report for the Pyramid Project    Page 30 

DJF/GA_hd Pyramid_2CF012.000_Technical Report_DJF_GA_MN_20130621 June 2013 

The entire sedimentary package is not exposed, but in general, has a northeast-southwest strike and 
southeast dip that varies from shallow to steep. The further northeast on the Peninsula, the more 
deformed and rotated the sedimentary package tends to be.  

Relative timing and interpretation indicates the Alaska Peninsula terrain was accreted in the early 
Tertiary exposing Upper Cretaceous variably marine sedimentary rocks of the Chignik, Shumagin, 
and Hoodoo Formations. Early Tertiary sedimentary rocks are also within the accreted terrain and 
were subducted beneath the peninsular terrain. The Border Range Fault is interpreted to occur 
between the inner and outer Shumagin Islands where the Shumagin Formation and Late Cretaceous 
Plutons of 58-63 Ma are best exposed. Following terrain accretion, southern Alaska rotated counter-
clockwise between 30-50 degrees to its current location by no later than 43 Ma. At this time, the 
direction of the accretion shifted to a northwest vengeance of the currently active Aleutian 
(subduction) Trench. 

6.1.3 Economic Geology 

Regional metal endowment and mineralization is consistent with other porphyry copper districts 
worldwide. There are several different mineralizing events within the region, all of which are related 
to arc-subduction volcanism. The oldest event is the farthest south and includes epithermal and 
porphyry style mineralization on Unga and Popof islands, 47 km (30 miles) to the south-southwest. 
Although this event is older than the event responsible for Pyramid mineralization, it is less eroded 
and present surface distribution may suggest that only the upper tiers of the greater porphyry system 
are exposed.  

The Pyramid deposit is hosted within the current volcanic arc, a contemporaneous intrusive rock that 
has been dated to 6 million years by K-Ar isotope dating (Armstrong et al, 1975). Also associated 
with this activity are Pavlof and Veniaminof; two active volcanoes within the arc. The arc becomes 
progressively older to the east with the Bee Creek porphyry system being roughly 20 Ma. While the 
current arc is more deeply eroded, several epithermal centers have been identified, most notably the 
San Diego bay epithermal center and hot springs located along the northern coast of the Alaska 
Peninsula only several miles from the Pyramid deposit. 

6.2 Property Geology 

6.2.1 Sedimentary Rocks 

The sedimentary rocks at Pyramid consist of a thick succession of clastic rocks of largely siltstone 
character. The siltstone commonly occurs as a fine-grained rock with no preserved internal structure 
such as bedding. Locally, feldspatic siltstone with small (<1 mm) plagioclase grains or slightly coarse 
sandstone texture occurs. They are thought to belong to the Late Cretaceous age Hoodoo Formation 
and the Late Paleocene to Middle Eocene Tolstoi Formation. The Hoodoo is a lower continental 
slope submarine shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone, becoming coarser (sandy) 
stratigraphically upwards.  

Siltstone within the Pyramid area is intensely affected by pervasive K-silicate alteration of biotite 
giving the pale brown to creamy appearance to the rock. This is variably overprinted by green to grey 
sericite alteration in the core of the mineralized area. It characteristically has higher hairline vein 



SRK Consulting

density relative to the adjacent intrusive porphyry unit reflecting a pre-mineralization fracture system 
and competency difference. Least altered siltstone occurs as a dark grey rock outside the K-silicate 
zone. Therefore, appearance of zones of dark grey siltstone in drill holes marks the outer limit of the 
intense K-silicate alteration zone. 

6.2.2 Intrusive Rocks 

The Pyramid Cu-Mo mineralization is centred on several late Miocene porphyry intrusions, likely 
quartz dioritic composition, which are hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary clastic 
sedimentary rocks (Figure 6.2). The intrusive bodies are small (<200 m) stocks or dikes and are 
exposed in an area of at least 2.5 × 1.5 km largely within an east-west trending glacial valley. 
Available drill hole data suggest that most of these intrusive units occur as vertical bodies but 
existence of smaller sills cannot be ruled out. They have similar mineralogy of plagioclase, biotite 
and amphibole with variable occurrence and abundance of quartz phenocrysts. Texture of the rocks 
varies from small to coarse grained porphyritic to coarse equigranular texture. The intrusive rocks 
found on the property have been divided into several types on the basis of texture, mineralogical 
composition and timing of emplacement. 

Feldspar porphyry (FP) is a main intrusive rock at Pyramid emplaced into the host sedimentary rocks 
commonly as vertical bodies less than 150 m wide. It is characterized by approximately 35% small 
(2-3 mm) plagioclase phenocrysts in a fine-grained mafic groundmass of dominantly plagioclase, 
biotite and hornblende. Locally, small (<2 mm) triangular shape quartz occur. Hornblende is rarely 
preserved but abundant biotite occurs in groundmass in areas with least sericite alteration. Quartz 
diorite porphyry (QDP) is texturally and mineralogically similar to the feldspar porphyry, having 
approximately 35% plagioclase phenocrysts. However, characteristically, it has approximately 5% 
small (ca. 3 mm) hexagonal to rounded quartz phenocrysts. 

The equigranular diorite (ED) forms a large central intrusive body at Pyramid with surface exposure 
of at least 600 m × 400 m. Drill core data suggest that it probably expands at depth and extends 
especially towards west. It is characterized by approximately 60% plagioclase (3-4 mm), 30% biotite 
(1-6 mm) and amphibole, 2% magnetite and less than 10% groundmass of largely plagioclase. The 
biotite is usually recrystallized and hornblende is rare. It has been affected by K-silicate alteration 
characterized by quartz + K-feldspar + magnetite. It locally contains veins with green sericite 
alteration halos with minor chalcopyrite and trace pyrite (cp>>py). They cut and are cut by early 
green sericite veinlets suggesting development of early veins within ED. However, typical Pyramid 
mineralization associated with quartz-grey sericite veins do not occur. Late pyrite veins are not 
common. 

Crowded feldspar porphyry (CFP) is a distinct porphyry unit at Pyramid characterized by abundant 
coarse phenocrysts of zoned plagioclase (2-8 mm, 45%), biotite (2-5 mm, 15%), hornblende (3-4 
mm, 10%), and magnetite (1-2 mm, 3%) in a fine-grained grey feldspar-rich groundmass. CFP cuts 
FP and QDP with sharp contacts and rarely has clasts of QDP. CFP is only weakly mineralized and 
commonly barren.  

The plagioclase biotite dike (PBD) is a late mafic dike with thickness from a few cm to over 20 m. It 
cuts all previous rock units especially near the contacts between older rocks and occurs as dikes 
trending approximately east-west. PBD is characterized by variable amounts of plagioclase (20 to

40%) and locally biotite phenocrysts in a biotite-rich groundmass with magnetite (1-3%). Locally, 
PBD contains disseminated chalcopyrite with minor pyrrhotite similar to minette dikes. PBD, 
however, is commonly barren, cuts all vein types and is locally cut by trace hairline pyrite veins. 

 
Figure 6.2: Geological Map of the Pyramid Property 

6.3 Mineralization and Alteration 

The alteration suites can be described as multiphase and in approximate paragenetic order 
consisting of early potassic assemblages (biotite-magnetite+/-kspar), early dark micaceous (EDM) 
veining, A and B quartz-kspar-sulphide veining, minor D-veining as pyrite-carbonate-quartz-sericite, 
copper sulphide enrichment, and oxidation (Figure 6.3). The complete timing of phyllic alteration 
(quartz, sericite, pyrite) has not been fully established but likely overlaps the potassic alteration 
phase and is identified with aspects of EDM, A, B, and D veining. Indications of argillic alteration are 
also present with an abundance of clay altered feldspars, particularly in holes drilled on the south 
side of the valley. Not all alteration types were identified in each hole, but various combinations were 
observed and contribute to a slightly complex multiphase system.

Figure 6.3: Alteration interpretation map of Pyramid Project, end of the 2010 program. Alteration 
boundaries defined during field examination, 2010. Potassic defined as biotite-magnetite, phyllic is 
defined as sericite, quartz, sulfide, and pyrite halo consists of veined pyrite with minor quartz, calcite, 
sparse epidote, and chlorite. 

The early potassic is dominantly potassium-rich secondary biotite with variable disseminated to 
veinlet fine-grained magnetite. The biotite is fine-grained, often root beer brown, shreddy, 
preferentially replaces pre-existing hornblende and often biotite. The magnetite is typically fine-
grained disseminated and/or in hairline veinlets with biotite. A slightly later (?) phase of potassic 
alteration consists of potassium feldspar with quartz and sulphides in veining as A-type veins. This 
type of veining is common in the drilling and locally very abundant on the surface.  

The early dark micaceous (EDM) veins and veinlets are abundant, particularly in hornfelsed 
sediments. The veins are composed of quartz, sericite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, minor chlorite, and 
sparse K-spar. They are 1-3 mm wide, but can be up to 1 cm and have diffuse halos with no distinct 
wall boundary. These veins are thought to be genetically early as they are observed cross-cut by A, 
B, and D veins. Another hypothesis indicates EDM veins originally contained biotite and K-spar, but 
no sericite or chlorite which would be later alteration components replacing biotite and most of the K-
spar.

DJF/GA_hd Pyramid_2CF012.000_Technical Report_DJF_GA_MN_20130621 June 2013 

All drill holes were found to contain A-veins, variably composed of quartz, K-spar, sericite, and 
sulphide minerals (chalcopyrite, pyrite, and molybdenite) with minor anhydrite and carbonate. The 
veins range from a few millimeters to a couple of centimeters wide, have distinct wall boundaries, 
center-lines which are frequently filled with sulphide minerals. The veins can occur as cross-cutting 
stockworks and observed in hornfels, quartz diorite porphyry, diorite porphyry, and feldspar porphyry. 
Coeval and slightly later B-veins are apparent by their lack of alteration halo and are dominantly 
composed of quartz with minor sericite and deep purple anhydrite, and have sharp continuous 
transects of the core. Molybdenite and chalcopyrite are the most frequent sulphide minerals 
associated with B-veins, commonly along the wall rock-vein boundary. They are not as abundant as 
EDM or A veins, but are found in all holes. The EDM, A, and B veins probably occurred during the 
transition between late potassic to early-middle phyllic alteration.  

Perhaps the latest veining event, D-veins, tend to cross cut all other vein types mentioned above. 
They can contain a variety of minerals, though nearly always contain pyrite with at least minor to 
moderate amounts of sericite, quartz, calcite/siderite, clay, and sparse molybdenite. D-veins are 
interpreted to arrive late, during the waning phyllic alteration phase, though are not considered a 
major part of the system in the holes drilled.

7 Deposit Types 
A porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold system is the primary deposit style targeted at the Pyramid 
Project. The Property is regionally located within the Pacific 'Ring of Fire', a geographic moniker for 
an area of tectonic and volcanically active terrains encircling the Pacific Basin. There are hundreds 
of known porphyry style deposits located within this feature, which includes countries such as the 
United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, and Mexico. The 'Ring 
of Fire' hosts an enormous amount of copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver from porphyry style 
deposits which are typically large low grade, bulk tonnage and generally open pit for economically 
effective extractions. 

Porphyry deposits are large, low-medium grade deposits; their primary (hypogene) mineralization is 
dominantly structurally controlled and is genetically and spatially related to felsic or intermediate 
intrusions. Along with hypogene mineralization, copper rich porphyry deposits have the potential for 
secondary (supergene) mineralization. Supergene mineralization occurs when copper bearing sulfide 
minerals (i.e. chalcopyrite) are weathered or dissolved by downward to laterally migrating acidic 
groundwater, then re-precipitated in a deeper reduced setting; the end result can be the precipitation 
and deposition of higher grade copper minerals, enhancing the economic potential. Secondary 
supergene mineralization does occur at Pyramid. 

Porphyry deposits come in varying styles, grades, and depths of exposure and as a result have a 
broad spectrum of deposit types. Typical copper porphyry deposit grades range from 0.2 to 1.5 % 
copper, 0.01 to 0.05 % Mo, 0.05 to 0.5 g/t Au, and 0.5 to 5.0 g/t Ag. Due to the various compositions 
of porphyry deposits, they often have varying metal values. There are deposits that are copper and 
gold rich, molybdenum and silver poor or copper and molybdenum rich, and gold and silver poor. 
Some deposits can also have smaller quantities of other precious metals that fall into the platinum 
group metals (platinum, palladium, rhenium, indium and rhodium) as well as selenium. These rarer 
metals and elements are often extracted during the smelting process.

8 Exploration 
Surface exploration agreements with two Alaska Native Village Corporations were finalized in 2010, 
and FMM subsequently entered into an Option Agreement with Antofagasta Minerals PLC 
(Antofagasta), principally focused on the Pyramid area. 

8.1 2010 

A program of work on the Pyramid Project commenced in early August, 2010 and was completed by 
mid-September, 2010. The program encompassed geologic mapping, collection of 150 rock chip 
samples, and diamond core drilling of 5 holes for a total of 1668 m with depths ranging from 201 m to 
500 m. The 2010 exploration program included the collection of surface samples, particularly in 
areas with deficient sample coverage. Previously sampled outcrops, specifically in areas covered 
during 2005 and 2006, were not fully duplicated and considered sufficient to merge and integrate 
with the 2010 sampling. Most of these samples were gathered during reconnaissance and detailed 
surface mapping. Six of the 150 samples were taken at the San Diego Bay alteration target, 8 km to 
the east. 

The 2010 surface sampling and mapping program identified previously un-recognized exposures 
containing strong porphyry style alteration and mineralization, and defined a 4 km x 3 km NE-SW 
oriented zone of strong porphyry style alteration and mineralization.  

8.2 2011 

The 2011 field program began June 1st and lasted until August 1st of 2011. The program consisted 
of rock chip and grab sampling (Figure 8.1), detailed geologic mapping, vein density mapping, 
diamond core drilling of 12 holes totaling 2,576 m with depths ranging between 105 m to 327 m, and 
a magnetic survey at Pyramid as well as minor prospecting and geologic sampling at San Diego Bay. 
A ground magnetic survey was contracted to Aurora Geoscience LTD out of Whitehorse, Yukon 
Canada. A one-man crew conducted the survey and collected a total of 26.6 line kilometers with 3 
km of N-S tie lines, 100 km E-W line spacing and 10 m station spacing. The survey was oriented 
east-west over the heart of the porphyry system. Also during late 2011, a high quality 5 m resolution 
IKONOS Geo Eye image capture over the immediate Pyramid target and surrounding area was 
commissioned through ETerra. Several images were captured, though none had 100% coverage 
due to cloudy peaks, thus imagery from other slightly lower quality datasets were spliced-in and a 
good image was ultimately produced in early May, 2012 (Figure 8.2). The dimensions of the image 
are 14.7 km x 7.7 km. This high quality dataset also came with 5 m digital contours to replace the 
government 100 feet contour data.

Figure 8.1: Rock sampling to date at over the main prospect at Pyramid (Au) 

8.3 2012 

The 2012 exploration campaign consisted of an extension of the 2011 ground magnetic survey and 
minor geologic mapping. There were no rock chip or grab samples taken during the season. Most of 
the focus for the season was on a drill program which resulted in 3,241 m of drilling over a total of 13 
holes. The mapping was performed over five man days by Full Metal Minerals geologist Joey Wilkins 
and focused on the southwest of the property. The most substantial part of the program, outside of 
drilling, was a four day ground magnetic survey performed by two Alaska Earth Sciences (AES) 
geologists in mid-August. The base station was a G-856AX Memory-Mag Proton Procession 
Magnetometer, and the rover was a G-859 MINING MAG Cesium Vapor Magnetometer. The work 
done extended the previous survey by about 1 km to the west (Figure 8.2), essentially covering all 
areas of drilling, but not all areas of surface mapping. This data was merged with the 2011 dataset 
by Ronald Bell at International Geophysical Services (IGS), LLC in Lakewood, Colorado. After 
merging the data, several products such as reduced to pole, total magnetic field, analytical signal,

9 Drilling 
9.1 Historical Drilling 

Drilling conducted by the Aleut-Quintana-Duval JV in 1975 consisted of two rigs which completed 19 
core holes for a total of 1692 m (Table 9.1 and Figure 9.1). One drill rig consisted of a skid mounted 
Longyear 38 which drilled 1163 m of NQ core over 13 holes. The second, a screw-feed Boyles rig, 
was a smaller machine that drilled 6 AQ holes for a total of 529 m and was transported in part by 
helicopter or skid. Overall core recovery was poor; especially in strongly altered chalcocite enriched 
rocks. It is hypothesized that overall grades may be higher than indicated due to loss of chalcocite in 
these sections.  

Drilling confirmed the presence of a broad area of copper and molybdenum mineralization to a 
maximum depth of 169 m where NQ holes averaged 89 m and AQ holes averaged 88 m; the 
deepest of which was 136 m (Table 9.1). The distribution of holes (Figure 9.1) and broad Cu-Mo 
mineralization allowed Aleut-Quintana-Duval to produce a resource calculation which is stated in the 
1975 Pyramid Project report by J. S. Christie (Christie, J. S., 1975). The report stated a resource of 
126,330,000 tons containing 0.403% Cu and 0.025% Mo with a 0.25% cut-off grade.

9.2 2010 Drilling 

A surface exploration agreement with the village corporations was finalized in 2010, and FMM 
subsequently entered into a joint-venture with Antofagasta Minerals PLC (Antofagasta), principally 
focused on the Pyramid area. Work on the program commenced in early August, 2010 and was 
completed by middle September, 2010. The program encompassed geologic mapping, collection of 
150 rock chip samples, and HQ sized diamond core drilling of 5 holes for a total of 1,668 m with 
depths ranging from 201 m to 500 m (Table 9.2 and Figure 9.1). 

Table 9.2: 2010 drill hole locations and orientations

Copper, molybdenum, and gold geochemistry from the five core holes indicated economic 
mineralization with the potential to expand dimensions of known mineralization. The most significant 
drill hole, PY10-005 was oriented northward on the north side of the known system and encountered 
0.63 % Cu, 0.018 % Mo, and 0.141 g/t Au from surface to a depth of 201 m. Other highlights from 
the 2010 drilling included 156 m of 0.402 % Cu, 0.039 % Mo, and 0.108 g/t Au in drill hole PY10-004 
and 468 m of 0.32 % Cu, 0.018 % Mo, and 0.067 g/t Au in drill hole PY10-001. Higher grades were 
detected over intervals of 40 to 70 m in all 5 drill holes, and drill hole PY10-005 recorded multiple 2 
m intercepts with over 1% Cu. Despite core recovery problems reported by Quintana-Duval in 1975, 
the core recovery during this campaign was excellent.     

9.3 2011 

During 2011, 12 HQ sized diamond core holes totaling in 2,576 m with depths ranging between 
105 m to 327 m were drilled (Table 9.3 and Figure 9.1). Copper, molybdenum, and gold 
geochemistry from the 12 drill holes showed potential for the expansion of the known mineralization. 
Although some drill holes failed to intercept significant Cu-Au-Mo mineralization, eight were 
successful. Of those eight, 11PY010 was the most impressive with 310 m of 0.39 % Cu, 0.009 % 
Mo, and 0.102 g/t Au. Drill hole 11PY016 returned 156 m of 0.71 % Cu, 0.018 % Mo, and 0.179 g/t 
Au.

9.4 2012 Drilling 

During the third year of exploration, the joint venture between Antofagasta-Full Metal continued, 
although a third party consulting/logistics group Alaska Earth Sciences was used for general project 
management. A helicopter supported drill rig was used throughout the entire project supplied by 
Peak Exploration Drilling Co. All of the diamond core drilling was HQ in dimension, drill hole 
orientation was either north or south and always at an angle.  

Thirteen diamond core holes with a total drilled depth of 3241 m were completed during the 2012 
program (Table 9.4 and Figure 9.1). There were very few weather days and the drill remained in 
good repair. Nine of the thirteen drill holes (12PY018, 019, 021, 022, 023, 027, 028, 029, and 030) 
all have anomalous to significant copper, gold, and molybdenum intercepts. There are a total of 3 
drill holes with ≥ 0.2% Cu over approximately 100 m. The longest continuously anomalous intercept 
is in drill hole 12PY018 which has 344 m at 0.110 % Cu, 0.036 % Mo and 0.035 g/t Au.

10 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 
10.1 Historical Sample Preparation and Analyses 

Samples for assay were obtained by splitting the core with a core splitter, crushing to a -4 mesh size 
and then reducing the volume by 50-75% using a Jones Riffle. These yielded samples consisting of 
2-3 lbs depending on core size and recovery. Copper and molybdenum assays were run on all 
samples and check assays from two additional laboratories were made with the original pulps. 50-75 
ft composite samples were also run for gold and silver and select representative samples run with 30 
element spectrographic analysis.  

10.2 2010 to 2012 Sample Preparation and Analyses 

Sampling during the 2012 project was a continuation of the methods used in the 2010 and 2011 
seasons which had been laid out by FMM geologists and approved by Antofagasta. This involved an 
unbiased sampling interval of two meters through the entire length of the drill holes starting at 
bedrock. Core was sawn in half using two 14 inch diamond bladed rotary saws on site and placed in 
sealed polyethylene bags. Within the catch basin below the blade, a chafing dish was placed, which 
was able to collect the fines from cutting. The fine material was allowed to settle, after which the 
water was poured off. The fine material was halved, one part was put into the core box and the other 
with the samples bound for the laboratory. The chafing dish was emptied upon completion of each 
sample. This procedure was initiated early in the 2012 program when chalcocite mineralization was 
present in the core and wet saw cutting showed minor evidence of 'washing' of this secondary 
copper mineralization. 

Upon completion of each drill hole, sample bags were compiled into rice sacks and transported to a 
locked facility rented by FMM in Sand Point, Alaska. Each rice sack was labeled with a bag number 
and sample string contents. After completion of up to three drill holes, the rice sacks were then 
loaded onto charter aircraft and transported to Anchorage, where the samples were couriered by 
Alaska Earth Sciences (AES) personnel to the ALS Preparation Facility in Anchorage, AK. Samples 
were kept under lock and key or under direct supervision by AES employees during the entire 
process of shipment to the prep facility. Drill holes were generally submitted as their own work order; 
exceptions were made to accommodate deeper holes. 

The Anchorage, AK preparation laboratory crushed and pulverized every sample then produced a 
balanced 200 g split called a pulp which was placed into a small envelope.  

The Pulps were then sent to the ALS-Chemex Vancouver laboratory, or in some cases, their Reno, 
Nevada laboratory where each sample was analyzed. Two methods were chosen for each sample: a 
30 g fire assay ICP-AES method for gold analysis and a 4-acid near total digestion ICP-AES 
procedure that produces quantitative results for 33 elements. The lower detection limit for gold is 
0.005 parts per million (ppm), 1 ppm for copper, and 1 ppm for molybdenum. A pre-determined over 
limit for copper and molybdenum was prescribed to the laboratory by both FMM and Antofagasta. 
Thus, when copper exceeded 2,500 ppm and/or molybdenum exceeded 200 ppm, the sample was 
automatically analyzed by the method AA-OG62, which consists of the same method just with a 
higher detection limit of 0.001 to 40 %. Once the laboratory had completed analyzing all of the 
samples in the batch, they reviewed the data for any potential quality control problems and upon

passing their QAQC restrictions, results were posted on their secure website. Upon which time, pre-
designated members of FMM were allowed to access and download the data. The time frame for 
preparation and analysis was typically 15 to 25 days, but sometimes longer during the busiest times 
of the year. 

10.3 Specific Gravity Data 

Specific gravity (SG) on select samples from the Pyramid Project was collected in 2010 and 2011 but 
not in 2012. In 2010, 21 samples were sent to ALS Laboratory for analysis. These samples were 
weighed in both air and water with the data reported as a ratio between the density of the sample 
and the density of the water. In 2011, 40 samples representing various lithologies were tested on-site 
by geologists from Antofagasta Minerals using methods similar to 2010.  

10.4 SRK Comments 

In the opinion of SRK the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by FMM are 
consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are therefore adequate.

11 Data Verification 
11.1 Historical Data Verification 

All information from historical work and sampling including core drilling was derived from a 1975 
report produced by J.S Christie, the project geologist for the Aleut-Quintana Duval joint Venture. 
Core from the project still exists at the Alaska core repository in Eagle River Alaska and was 
inspected by FMM geologists in 2006 and re-logged in 2011. Due to contamination and the mixed 
nature of some of the boxes (core had been dumped out of the original boxes and returned out of 
place) it was decided not to re-assay any of the core. Additionally due to the age of the analysis, the 
original certificates were unavailable from the laboratory, thus FMM is relying on the values included 
in the 1975 report. 

11.2 FMM Data Verification 

All drill holes, both recent and historical were initially located using a handheld Garmin GPS with an 
accuracy of ± 3 m. In 2012, a differential GPS survey was conducted over the Pyramid Project, 
covering most but not all of the drill holes located on the property. Down hole drill surveys were 
conducted on all recent drill holes except in cases where this was impossible due to collapsed holes 
or lost pipe.  

A batch of samples from each drill hole were carefully selected and sent to a second ISO certified 
laboratory as a means of data verification. A total of 10 % of all 2010 to 2012 pulp samples (314) 
were sent to ActLabs for analysis. Overall, excellent correlation is seen between assay results from 
the two laboratories for copper ICP values, with 97.5 % of sample pairs having a half absolute 
relative difference of less than 10%.  Correlation between sample pairs for molybdenum is lower with 
74.2 % of sample pairs having a half absolute relative difference of less than 10%. As expected, due 
to the lower concentration there was much more variation in the relative difference of the gold values 
with only 49.2 % of sample pairs having a half absolute relative difference of less than 10%. One 
sample had an original gold value of 5.06 ppm and a rerun value of 0.034. As there were no other 
high grade samples, this sample pair was removed as an outlier. Scatter plots and percentile rank 
charts sample pairs for copper ICP, molybdenum ICP and gold fire assay are presented in Appendix 
B, Figures B1 to B3.  

11.3 Analytical Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs  

A quality control and assurance system was implemented by FMM from the beginning of the 
program, which consisted of placing a blank sample or Standard Reference Material (SRM) sample 
every 10 samples, alternating between the two. Blank material for 2010 and 2011 was sourced from 
a granodiorite intrusion near the town of Chicken, Alaska intended to have similar properties to the 
host rocks at Pyramid. Overall, these rocks were barren but were later found to contain anomalous 
fracture hosted copper mineralization which led to irregular spikes in the data. In 2012, blank 
material was sourced via AES personnel from an Interior Alaska quarry. This material consisted of 
barren unaltered basalt. Though unmineralized, it contained on average 30 ppm Cu due to the fact 
that mafic volcanic rocks naturally contain a higher concentration of copper than average crustal 
rocks. These blanks were systematically sampled to assure that they contained sufficiently low metal

values before being used. The SRM's used are tabulated in Table 11.1 and have all been certified by 
the source company, CDN Laboratories.

There were no outstanding quality control or quality assurance issues during the 2010 to 2012 
seasons. Most standards fell within 2 standard deviations for copper and molybdenum and rarely fell 
near 3 standard deviations, most typically in relation to the gold. The standard with the most range in 
gold was CDN-CM-14 with 3 samples falling outside 3 standard deviations, though not considered 
extreme and these batches were not re-analyzed. 

The 2010 to 2012 external analytical quality control data produced by FMM is summarized in 
Table 11.2.

11.4 SRK Data Verification 

SRK Associate, Dr. Gilles Arseneau, carried out a site visit on March 19 and 20, 2013 to examine 
drill core, core logging and sampling procedures, and visit the drill sites. Drill site locations were 
verified with hand-held GPS and were found to agree with the digital database of drill hole locations, 
although only two sites were located because of snow cover. Several holes were re-logged and 
checked against original drill log. SRK noted that the original drill logs agreed well with the re-logging 
and copper assay values seem to agree well with the amount of visible chalcopyrite and chalcocite 
present in drill core. In February 2013, SRK completed an audit of the FMM analytical and quality 
control data acquired during the sampling of the Pyramid deposit. The audit was completed by SRK 
Associate, Darrell Farrow. SRK conducted routine verifications to ascertain the reliability of the 
electronic borehole database provided by FMM. All assays in the current database were verified 
against the independently sourced sample certificates from ALS Laboratories and ActLabs. The 
copper, molybdenum and gold values in the assay table were found to match the laboratory 
certificates.

Technical Report for the Pyramid Project    Page 47 

DJF/GA_hd Pyramid_2CF012.000_Technical Report_DJF_GA_MN_20130621 June 2013 

After the review, SRK is of the opinion that the Pyramid drilling database is sufficiently reliable for 
resource estimation. 

11.4.1 Quality Control Results 

FMM made available to SRK the assay results for analytical quality control data accumulated for the 
Pyramid drilling project from 2010 to 2012. SRK aggregated the assay results from the quality control 
samples for further analysis. Sample blanks and certified reference materials data were summarized 
on time series plots to highlight any potential failure. Field duplicate paired assay data were analysed 
using scatter plots and ranked absolute relative difference charts. 

Field blanks are used to monitor contamination introduced during sample preparation and to monitor 
analytical accuracy of the laboratory. True blanks should not have any of the elements of interest 
much higher than the detection levels of the instrument being used. SRK consider batch samples 
which contain a blank sample with more than five times of detection limit as problematic batches. In 
general, molybdenum (Figure 11.1) and gold (Figure 11.2) returned good results while copper 
(Figure 11.3) consistently returned values that were too high. The high copper values can be 
attributed to the fact that FMM was using mafic volcanic rocks which naturally contain a higher 
concentration of copper than average crustal rocks. The spikes in the earlier blank samples are due 
to blank material for 2010 and 2011 which was sourced from a granodiorite intrusion near the town of 
Chicken, Alaska containing anomalous fracture hosted copper mineralization. It is recommended that 
for future programs, FMM source a more appropriate material for blank samples.

Time series plots for standard reference materials (SRM) CDN-CM-6, CDN-CM-7, CDN-CM-8, CDN-
CM-11A, CDN-CM-13, CDN-CM-14, and CDN-CGS-23 can be found in Appendix A, Figures A1 to 
A31. 

SRM CDN-CM-13 was the only standard that performed consistently well for gold. The other SRM's 
returned a number of samples with values greater than three standard deviations from the certified 
mean value for the SRM. 

Variable performance of all SRM's used was seen for copper using the ICP-AES method of analysis 
with a number of samples returning values greater than three standard deviations from the certified 
mean value of the SRM. With the exception of CDN-CM-11A in which one sample returned a copper 
value very much greater than three standard deviations of the mean, all SRM's performed well when 
analysed using the AA-OG62 method of analysis for copper. 

All SRM's performed well for molybdenum analysed by the AA-OG62 method of analysis, whereas 
with the ICP-AES method of analysis, CDN-CM-11a returned one sample with a molybdenum value 
of very much greater than three standard deviations from the certified mean molybdenum value and 
CDN-CM-14 returned two samples with molybdenum values greater than three standard deviations 
from the mean. 

FMM did not request re-analysis of batches of samples containing SRM's which returned values 
greater than three standard deviations from the certified mean value of the SRM. Where samples 
were analysed for copper and molybdenum using both the ICP-AES and the AA-OG62 method of 
analysis, the AA-OG62 results were used for the resource estimate and on the whole all SRM's 
performed better using the AA-OG62 method of analysis. However, not all samples were analysed 
using both methods and SRK recommends that for future programs, FMM should request re-analysis 
of batches of samples which return SRM values greater than three standard deviations of the mean.

13 Mineral Resource Estimates 
13.1 Introduction 

SRK was engaged in January 2013, by Full Metal Minerals (FMM) to provide a mineral resource 
estimate for the copper molybdenum gold Pyramid Project, Alaska Peninsula, Alaska.  

The Mineral Resource Statement presented in this report represents the first time disclosure of 
mineral resource for the Pyramid Project by FMM with the Canadian Securities Administrators' 
National Instrument 43-101. 

13.2 Resource Estimation Procedures 

The resource evaluation methodology involved the following procedures: 

• Database compilation and verification; 

• Construction of wireframe models for the Pyramid copper molybdenum, gold mineralization 
domains; 

• Data preparation (compositing and capping) for geostatistical analysis and variography; 

• Block modeling and grade interpolation; 

• Resource classification and validation; 

• Assessment of "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" and selection of appropriate cut-
off grades; and 

• Preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement. 

13.3 Database 

The Pyramid database comprises descriptive information and assay grades from exploration drilling 
carried out by FMM and Antofagasta Minerals PLC (Antofagasta) from 2010 to 2012 inclusive as well 
as historical drilling conducted by the Aleut-Quintana-Duval JV in 1975. The database was provided 
to SRK in Excel format spreadsheets and contains 19 historical drill holes and 30 drill holes drilled 
between 2010 and 2012. The database includes the following tables: 

• Drill hole collar information such as location and length; 

• Down hole survey information such as direction and dip; 

• Lithology information including rock group codes and interpreted geology; 

• Mineralization information including mineral types and percentage; 

• Vein counts and types of veins; 

• Alteration information including alteration type; 

• Down hole magnetic susceptibility data; 

• Down hole specific gravity measurements ;  

• Chemical analytical (assay) records; and, 

• Ore type.

Technical Report for the Pyramid Project    Page 53 

DJF/GA_hd Pyramid_2CF012.000_Technical Report_DJF_GA_MN_20130621 June 2013 

The data encompasses 49 drill holes, 247 down hole survey readings, 3,926 copper, molybdenum 
and gold assays, and 59 specific gravity measurements (Table 13.1).

The supplied mineral resource database was imported into Gemcom's GemsTM 6.4.1 software 
Access Database and validated by checking for inconsistencies in naming conventions, analytical 
units, duplicate entries, length, distance values, or sample intervals less than or equal to zero, blank 
or zero-value assays, out-of-sequence intervals, intervals or distances greater than the reported drill 
hole length, inappropriate collar locations, and missing interval and coordinate fields. A few minor 
inconsistencies were noted and corrected by FMM. No other significant validation errors were noted 
in the supplied database. Gold assay intervals marked below the detection limit of 0.005 g/t were 
assigned a nominal grade of 0.0025 g/t prior to importing into Gems. 

13.4 Specific Gravity 

The data supplied by FMM included 59 specific gravity measurements from the 2010 and 2011 
drilling. In 2010 samples were sent to the ALS Laboratory for specific gravity measurements and in 
2012 samples representing various lithologies were tested on-site by geologists from Antofagasta 
Minerals using a laboratory scale and recording the mass of drill hole core pieces in air and in water. 
There were not enough specific gravity measurements for interpolation of specific gravity into blocks. 
Specific gravity measurements falling within the supergene and hypogene zones were averaged and 
an average specific gravity value of 2.59 and 2.68 were applied to the blocks in the supergene and 
hypogene domains respectively. 

13.5 Solid Body Modeling 

Solid models were created to provide spatial limits for each of the mineralization domains within the 
Pyramid copper molybdenum gold porphyry deposit. 

Domains were created by interpretation of the drill hole lithology data from the 2010 to 2012 drill 
holes together with the historical drill holes. Three domains were modeled: a low grade leach cap 
varying between 0 to 90 m in thickness; a supergene enrichment zone below the leach cap with 
variable depth extending to 250 m below surface in some areas and defined by increased chalcocite 
mineralization and higher copper values; and the primary hypogene mineralized zone, with copper 
mainly occurring as chalcopyrite, underlying the supergene zone in most areas. Three zones of 
hypogene mineralization were modeled, one to the north of the large central intrusive equigranular 
diorite (ED), one to the south of the ED and one to the west of the ED intrusion. The boundary 
between the hypogene and supergene mineralization was broadly based on the percentage of 
chalcocite together with the copper values within the drill holes. Two barren veins of crowded

feldspar porphyry (CFP) intersect the modeled supergene in the north western portion of the deposit. 
These veins were also modeled in order to remove them from the modeled supergene.  

Gemcom's GemsTM 6.4.1 software was used to create the wireframes. The topography surface was 
constructed from E-Terra satellite imagery tiles from which a DEM was created and imported into 
Gems as a dxf file.  

Figure 13.1 depicts a three dimensional (3D) view of the modeled domains.  

 
Figure 13.1: 3D view of the Pyramid modeled domains. 

13.6 Compositing 

A total of 1,265 and 938 diamond drill hole assay intervals fall within the modeled supergene and 
hypogene domains respectively. Approximately 75% of samples are 2 m in length and therefore a 
compositing interval of 2 m was selected. Histograms of sample length for the supergene and 
hypogene domains can be seen in Figures 13.2 and 13.3 respectively.  

The assays were imported into Gems and composited to 2 m length weighted intervals within the 
modeled domains.

13.7 Capping 

Grade capping analysis was conducted on the domain-coded sample assay data in order to limit the 
influence of extreme assay values during estimation. The assays from the supergene and hypogene 
domains were examined using histograms and cumulative frequency plots. Capping threshold values 
were selected that minimize changes in the sample distribution, and composited values were capped 
to these values prior to estimation (Table 13.2).

13.9 Block Model 

A block model was constructed to cover the entire extent of the modeled mineralized domains for 
Pyramid. The block model includes estimated copper, molybdenum and gold grades as well as 
estimated grades by other than ordinary kriging methods, and an estimated copper equivalent (Cu 
Eq) grade. A block percentage model was used to accurately determine volume and tonnage values 
based on the modeled wireframes. The geometrical parameters of the block model are summarized 
in Table 13.4.

13.10 Variography 

Experimental correlograms and correlogram models were generated for copper, molybdenum and 
gold from composite grade data. The nugget effect was established from down hole correlograms. 
Directional correlograms were examined and ultimately omnidirectional models were employed. The

13.11 Grade Interpolation 

Ordinary Kriging (OK) was used for the estimation of block grades. For all metals a three-pass series 
of expanding search ellipsoids with varying minimum sample requirements was used for sample 
selection and estimation.  

Composite data used for the estimation was restricted to samples located in the respective domains, 
i.e., hard boundaries were used. Estimated copper, molybdenum, and gold block grades were used 
to estimate CuEq block grades. Estimation criteria for the supergene and hypogene domains are 
summarized in Tables 13.6 and 13.7 respectively. All interpolated blocks were classified as inferred 
mineral resource.

13.12 Block Model Validation 

The block model was validated visually by the inspection of successive section lines in order to 
confirm that the block model correctly reflects the distribution of high-grade and low-grade samples. 
An inverse distance squared estimate (ID2) was prepared for the blocks using the same search 
criteria and compared against the OK estimate. The average composite sample grades for all blocks 
containing composite samples (informed blocks) were compared to the OK and ID2 estimates using 
scatter plots. The scatter plots for copper, molybdenum and gold within the supergene and hypogene 
domains are shown in Figures 13.6 and 13.7 respectively. 

Good correlation between OK, ID2 and average composite sample grades was observed for copper, 
molybdenum and gold in both the supergene and hypogene domains. Average sample grades for 
the informed blocks are compared against the average grade of the OK and the average grade of the 
ID2 estimates for copper, molybdenum and gold in Table 13.8.

13.13 Block Model Sensitivity Analysis 

The mineral resources of the project are sensitive to the selection of the reporting cut-off grade. To 
illustrate this sensitivity, the block model quantities and grade estimates within the conceptual pit 
used to constrain the mineral resources are presented in Table 13.9 at different cut-off grades. The 
reader is cautioned that the figures presented in this table should not be misconstrued with a Mineral 
Resource Statement. The figures are only presented to show the sensitivity of the block model 
estimates to the selection of cut-off grade. Figure 13.8 presents the effects of increasing cut-offs on 
the tonnage and grade of the deposit.

13.14 Mineral Resource Classification 

Mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" guidelines. Mineral resources may be affected by 
further infill and exploration drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent resource 
estimates. Mineral resources may also be affected by subsequent assessments of mining, 
environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic, and other factors.  

Mineral reserves can only be estimated based on the results of an economic evaluation as part of a 
preliminary feasibility study or feasibility study. As such, no mineral reserves have been estimated by 
SRK as part of the present assignment. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral 
Resources will be converted into a mineral reserve. Confidence in the estimate of Inferred mineral 
resources is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or 
to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. 

Mineral resources for the Pyramid Project have been estimated and classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definition and Guidelines" (December, 2005) by 
DJ Farrow, Pr.Sci.Nat., under the supervision of Dr. Gilles Arseneau P.Geo., an "Independent 
Qualified Person" as defined by National Instrument 43-101. The commercial Gemcom's GemsTM 
software program was used for mineral resource modeling. 

SRK considers that the quality of the 2010 to 2011 exploration data (confidence in the location and 
reliability of assaying results) acquired by FMM is good and therefore is not a factor that would 
impact resource classification. The use of the historical drill hole assay data in the estimation of 
mineral resources does not support an Indicated mineral resource. The confidence in the underlying

datasets support classification of Inferred mineral resources within the meaning of the CIM Definition 
Standards. However, there is insufficient information to confirm both the geological and grade 
continuity with the current level of sampling to support an Indicated mineral resource classification 
within the meaning of the CIM Definition Standards. 

All interpolated blocks were classified as inferred mineral resource. 

13.15 Mineral Resource Statement 

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) defines a 
mineral resource as: 

"A concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid 
fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on 
the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge". 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the quantity 
and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources are reported 
at an appropriate cut-off grade taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. In 
order to meet this requirement, SRK considers that major portions of the Pyramid Project are 
amenable for open pit extraction. 

In order to determine the quantities of material offering "reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction" by an open pit, SRK used a pit optimizer and reasonable mining assumptions to evaluate 
the proportions of the block model that could be "reasonably expected" to be mined from an open pit. 

The optimization parameters were selected based on experience and benchmarking against similar 
projects (Table 13.10). The reader is cautioned that the results from the pit optimization are used 
solely for the purpose of testing the "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" by an open pit 
and do not represent an attempt to estimate mineral reserves. There are no mineral reserves on the 
Pyramid Project. The results are used as a guide to assist in the preparation of a Mineral Resource 
Statement and to select an appropriate resource reporting cut-off grade.

SRK considers that the blocks located within the conceptual pit envelope show "reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction" and can be reported as a Mineral Resource. 

In calculating the CuEq, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. utilized the long term metal prices provided 
by Energy and Metals Consensus Forecast (Table 13.10). The contained copper represents 
estimated contained metal in the ground and has not been adjusted for metallurgical recoveries. 

The inferred resources for the Pyramid deposit reported at Cu Eq grade of 0.21 percent are 
summarized in Table 13.11.

16 Interpretation and Conclusions 
The Pyramid Project is an early stage copper molybdenum gold exploration prospect located on the 
southwestern tip of the Alaskan Peninsula, Alaska, USA. The history of Pyramid dates back to the 
mid-1970s when geologists from the Aluet Corp (TAC)-Quintana-Duval joint venture identified 
porphyry copper-molybdenum potential during regional reconnaissance along the Alaskan 
Peninsula.  

Drilling by FMM and the previous owners has identified Cu-Mo mineralization centered on several 
small late Miocene porphyry intrusions, hosted by a sequence of Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary 
clastic sedimentary rock.  

A total of 49 drill holes totaling 9,177 m has delineated an inferred mineral of 173 million tons grading 
0.08 g/t Au, 0.35% Cu and 0.02% Mo. Mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally 
accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" guidelines by 
ordinary kriging using Gemcom Gems software. Mineral resources may be affected by further infill 
and exploration drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent resource estimates 

SRK is not aware of any significant risks and uncertainties that could be expected to affect the 
reliability or confidence in the early stage exploration information discussed herein

17 Recommendations 
During 2012, only limited geologic mapping and no rock or chip sampling was performed; as a result 
the recommended target areas are based upon information gathered from drill hole data, magnetics, 
and surface work done during the 2010 to 2012 campaigns. In addition to drilling new targets, infill 
drilling is recommended in certain areas of the deposit targeting near surface higher copper grades. 

A program of at least 5,000 m of diamond core drilling is recommended with drill holes taken to 
depths greater than 250 m on average with deeper holes targeting the potassic core of the system. 
In holes with strong mineralization, it is recommended that a second hole be drilled at a steeper 
angle. 

Aside from drilling, surface exploration work is recommended. Additional soil sampling as well as 
geologic mapping in the western portion of the property with corresponding vein density mapping is 
also recommended.
