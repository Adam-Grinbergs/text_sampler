 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -  

Preliminary Economic Assessment of a Pulp Agglomeration Treatment and Underground Option - Technical Report 

 

1 Summary 
 Introduction, property description, and ownership 1.1

This technical report refers to the Dolores property (the "Property"), an open pit silver-gold 
mine located in Chihuahua state, Mexico, approximately 250 km west of the city of 
Chihuahua. The Property is owned by Pan American Silver Corp. ("Pan American") through its 
wholly owned subsidiary, Compañía Minera Dolores S.A. de C.V.  

This technical report has been prepared to disclose relevant information about the Property 
which has resulted from mineral resource and reserve delineation drilling, updated mineral 
resource and mineral reserve estimates, and a preliminary economic assessment of an 
expansion of the Dolores mine to include pulp agglomeration treatment and an underground 
mine to extract material from beneath the current pit limits (the "Project"). This technical 
report supports the disclosure of the updated mineral resource and reserve estimates and the 
results of the preliminary economic assessment. 

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

Metallurgical testing of the Dolores mineralization has shown a strong relationship between 
the size of the ore particles and metallurgical recovery, with decreasing particle size resulting 
in increased metallurgical recovery. Pan American has determined that recovery of the higher 
grade mineralization can be improved by constructing a pulp agglomeration plant to crush, 
grind, filter, and agglomerate the higher grade ore particles and then sending them to the 
existing heap leach pads for leaching.  

The possibility of developing an underground mine to provide supplemental feed to the 
existing heap leach facilities, without construction of a pulp agglomeration plant, was 
investigated. The study concluded that although the economics were positive, they were not 
sufficiently robust to justify developing an underground mine without the benefit of the 
additional metal recovery that would be achieved by the pulp agglomeration plant. The life of 
mine plans and the economics presented in the preliminary economic assessment assume 
that the pulp agglomeration plant and the underground mine will be developed together.  

The expansion Project construction could be completed over a period of 15 to 18 months and 
would involve increasing the current treatment rate from roughly 16,200 to 20,000 tonnes 
per day by processing the high grade portion of the mined material through a pulp 
agglomeration treatment plant and conveying the agglomerated material with the crushed 
lower grade portion of the mined material to the heap leach pads for leaching. The pulp 
agglomeration plant would be comprised of crushing, grinding, particle size classification, 
thickening, filtration, agglomeration, and reagent facilities. The pulp agglomeration process of 
liberating metals by grinding has the advantage of improved leaching kinetics and ultimate 
recovery of precious metals in the high grade ore relative to the current heap leach method. 
The improvement in recovery of the high grade fraction due to pulp agglomeration is

estimated at around 19% for silver and 13% for gold. This results in an overall improvement in 
metal recovery of around 7% for both silver and gold for the entire mineral inventory. 

Underground mining is expected to occur concurrently with open pit mining, and will be 
developed to commence production at approximately the same time as the pulp 
agglomeration plant installation is completed. The proposed underground mining method is 
open stoping, a low cost mechanized bulk mining method appropriate for the competent 
ground conditions present at the mine that allows for a near complete extraction of the 
mineable inventory. A preliminary underground schedule based on the underground mine 
plan targets a production rate of approximately 1,500 tonnes per day to feed the pulp 
agglomeration circuit in tandem with the high grade portion of the material from the open pit 
mine. The planned schedule indicates underground development commencing in 2015 with 
full production achieved in 2018 and a mine life of approximately 12 years, including 
construction time. The projected mine life of the expanded operation may increase if 
additional mineral resources are defined and can be converted to mineral reserves. 

The Project also considers cost savings in replacing onsite power generation with the 
installation of a high voltage power line approximately 110 km long to connect the Dolores 
operation with the main electrical grid in Chihuahua. The new power line project will proceed 
regardless of the construction decision related to the expansion Project.  

 Geology and mineralization 1.2
Mineralization at Dolores occurs within the Sierra Madre Occidental volcanic belt, an arc 
formed by eastward subduction of the Pacific tectonic plate. The Sierra Madre is a 
metallogenic terrane well known for its epithermal precious metal deposits. The lower part of 
the arc comprises late Cretaceous to early Tertiary calc-alkaline batholiths and equivalent 
volcanosedimentary rocks. These rocks are generally referred to as the 'Lower Volcanic 
Supergroup' or 'Lower Volcanic Series' (McDowell and Keizer, 1977, Wark et. al., 1990, and 
Wark, 1991) and were formed by magmatic activity about 80 to 40 million years ago. The 
Lower Volcanic Series is the main host for mineralization at the Property and is cut by a 
swarm of north-northwest striking dikes. The magmatic activity was followed by two periods 
of major ignimbrite eruption in the early Oligocene and early Miocene. Collectively these 
eruptions constitute the 'Upper Volcanic Supergroup' or 'Series' (McDowell and Keizer, 1977). 
The ignimbrites were accompanied by minor andesite/basalt flows and rhyolitic domes.  

Dolores lies about 42 km north-northeast of the Mulatos high sulphidation epithermal gold 
deposits and 82 km north-northwest of Pinos Altos. Pinos Altos, a low sulphidation epithermal 
vein system, lies on the northeast rim of the Ocampo Caldera. This 30 km diameter caldera 
hosts a district of epithermal gold-silver deposits, including the Ocampo mine. 

The most important faults at Dolores, from west to east, are the Chupacabras, San Francisco, 
and East faults. The overall geometry is horst-like. The San Francisco fault and its footwall 
host most of the mineralization at Dolores. The immediate footwall and hanging wall of the 
San Francisco fault form a 500 m wide corridor of northwest-striking igneous intrusions 
broadly following the fault.  

There is a great variety of intrusive types and field relations indicate that they are 
contemporaneous with mineralization. The rocks with the most plutonic character occur in 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         12 of 171

the south, where a steep-sided barren microdiorite stock straddles the San Francisco Fault. 
Coinciding with high grade mineralization, it comprises weakly porphyritic diorite and 
marginal parts comprise porphyritic quartz diorite with a potassium feldspar-rich aplitic 
groundmass.  

Silver and gold mineralization at Dolores is hosted in north-northwest trending, mostly 
steeply southwest dipping hydrothermal breccias and sheeted vein zones on the order of 5 m 
to 10 m wide. Most of the high grade mineralization occurs along two or three major 
structures which provided the conduit for metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids. Silver and gold 
mineralization identified on the surface at Dolores covers an area 4,000 metres long and up 
to 1,000 metres wide, at elevations ranging between 1,100 metres to 1,700 metres above sea 
level. The extent of mineralization at depth and along strike has not yet been fully defined. 

Most high grade mineralization occurs within the San Francisco Breccia, a well-defined and 
spatially continuous hydrothermal breccia and stockwork zone that occurs in the immediate 
footwall of the post-mineral San Francisco Fault. The breccia trends farther away from the 
fault towards the north until it joins a second major breccia zone known as the Alma Maria 
Breccia. The San Francisco Fault marks a profound drop in grade and the hanging wall is 
mostly devoid of silver and gold mineralization. This barren hanging wall, comprised mostly of 
latite lava, forms the high west walls of the open pit mine. 

Most veins at Dolores are relatively simple, with only weak crustiform texture. They comprise 
euhedral comb quartz, commonly zoned from milky to transparent. They are thin, rarely over 
30 mm wide, and tend to form as sheeted swarms. Economically mineable grades occur 
where the veins are sufficiently closely spaced.  

 Status of exploration, development, and operations 1.3
The central part of the silver-gold mineralization at Dolores is well defined by over 
1,100 drillholes and has been the subject of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates. 
Typical near mine exploration takes place on an annual basis, including testing of the open 
regions of the deposit at depth and towards the south, as well as infill drilling to upgrade the 
confidence categories of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates.  

The mine has been in commercial operation since May 2009 and the current infrastructure 
includes the typical components of an operating open pit mine, including the mine workings, 
the processing facilities, three heap leach pads, medium grade mineralization stockpiles, 
waste rock storage facilities, workshops, laboratories, storage facilities, offices, drill core and 
logging sheds, water and power lines, access roads, a light aircraft landing strip, and the 
workers camp and recreational facilities. 

Pan American acquired the Dolores mine from Minefinders Corp. Ltd. ("Minefinders") at the 
end of March 2012, and began mining operations in April 2012. As at December 31, 2013, 
13.3 million ounces of silver and 335,200 ounces of gold have been produced from modern 
operations at Dolores. Historical production from between 1922 and 1931 is on the order of 
116,000 ounces of gold and 6 million ounces of silver.

 Mineral resource and reserve estimates 1.4
Pan American conducts infill and near-mine drilling through much of the year. The drillhole 
data cut-off date for the commencement of the geological interpretation and the mineral 
resource estimate was October 22, 2013 and the effective date of the mineral resources is 
May 31, 2014. Mineral resources were estimated by Pan American technical staff under the 
supervision of and reviewed by Michael Steinmann, P. Geo., Executive Vice President, 
Corporate Development and Geology of Pan American Silver, who is a qualified person as that 
term is defined by NI 43-101.  

Mineral resources for Dolores as at May 31, 2014 are given in Table 1.1. This tabulation 
includes in situ potentially economic material classified as measured, indicated, and inferred 
constrained within an optimized pit shell created using metal prices of $35 per ounce of silver 
and $1,400 per ounce of gold, as well as any potentially economic material within the reserve 
pit classified as inferred, underground resources below the resource pit shell, and low grade 
previously mined stockpiled material. The in situ mineral resources have been depleted for 
mining as at May 31, 2014 and stockpiles have been inventoried as at May 31, 2014. The costs 
and metallurgical recoveries estimated for pulp agglomeration treatment and combined open 
pit/underground mining have been used to estimate mineral resources. There are no known 
mining, metallurgical, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other factors or risks that could materially affect the potential 
development of the mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do 
not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resources reported here are in addition to 
mineral reserves.

Mineral reserve estimates were prepared by Pan American technical staff under the 
supervision of and reviewed by Martin Wafforn, P. Eng., Vice President, Technical Services of 
Pan American, who is a qualified person as that term is defined by NI 43-101.  

Mineral reserve estimates for Dolores as at May 31, 2014, comprising in situ material 
classified as proven and probable reserves within a reserve pit designed using metal prices of 
$22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold, as well as previously mined stockpiled 
economic material, are given in Table 1.2. The in situ mineral reserves have been depleted for 
mining as at May 31, 2014 and stockpiles have been inventoried as at May 31, 2014.The costs 
and metallurgical recoveries for the existing heap leach only operation have been used to 
estimate mineral reserves. Mineral reserves do not use the pulp agglomeration cost and 
metal recovery assumptions disclosed in this preliminary economic assessment, nor do they 
include any of the resources anticipated to be mined from underground, because the 
economic viability of those resources has not yet been determined by at least a pre-feasibility 
study.  

Mineral reserve estimates are based on assumptions that include mining, metallurgical, 
infrastructure, permitting, taxation, and economic parameters. Increasing costs and taxation 
and a fall in metal prices will have a negative impact on the estimation of mineral reserves. 
Aside from the current fluctuations in silver and gold prices, there are no other known factors 
that may have a material impact on the estimate of mineral reserves at Dolores.

 Mining 1.5
 Mining methods of the existing operation 1.5.1

Mining at Dolores has been ongoing since 2008 using conventional open pit methods with 
excavators, shovels, loaders, and haul trucks.  

Ore grade control is carried out using angled reverse circulation drilling to provide closer 
spaced sample data for a grade control estimate, which is used to mark out the ore/waste

mining boundaries. Ore and waste are usually blasted separately to minimize ore loss, 
dilution, and material misclassification. The minimum mining unit is 7 x 15 x 7.5 m, and 
planned dilution in the mineral reserve estimate averages around 13%. Blast movement 
monitoring takes place regularly.   

The mining sequence is to focus on the higher grade material in the south of the pit with 
waste material stored in the east waste rock facility, which is located to the south of the pit. 
When the last phase in the south is depleted, mining will switch to the north part of the pit 
with some of the waste stored inside the pit and some of the waste stored at the north waste 
rock facility. 

 Mining methods of the proposed expanded operation 1.5.2
There are no anticipated changes to the existing open pit mining methods or mining fleet 
associated with the expansion Project. Implementation of the proposed expanded operation 
will require additional mining selectivity to separate the high grade portion of the deposit for 
grinding, which will require a manageable adjustment to current grade control practices.  

The preliminary economic assessment assumes that a mechanized, ramp accessed 
underground mine will be developed to provide additional production from the extension of 
the mineralized structures below and along strike of the planned open pit mine. Underground 
mining is expected to occur concurrently with open pit mining and will be completed at 
approximately the same time. The mining method selected was open stoping, mostly 
oriented longitudinally, which takes into account the competent ground conditions and the 
requirement to tight fill stopes beneath the open pit. The advantages of this method include 
near complete extraction of the mineable inventory as no pillars are routinely necessary, and 
lower unit costs compared to development intensive methods such as cut and fill.  

Where competent backfill is required, cemented rock fill will be used, and where the stopes 
are located in areas that will later interact with open pit mining, the cemented rock backfill 
will be placed tightly to the backs to ensure open pit stability. Uncemented rock fill will be 
used where competent fill is not required, and will be preferentially sourced from 
underground development.  

 Life of mine plan of the existing operation 1.5.3
The life of mine plan of the existing operation is based on the mineral reserve estimate and 
has been developed with all mining sourced from the current open pit, feeding the existing 
crushing plant and heap leach system at a rate of 16,200 tonnes per day. In this life of mine 
plan the mining rate for the next seven years of production varies from 38.2 million tonnes to 
40.9 million tonnes of ore and waste. The waste mining rate declines thereafter, with mining 
completed in 2024. The heap leach system is fed at full capacity from the pit and stockpiles 
through to 2025, and stacking of crushed ore on the heap leach pads is completed in 2026. 
Production from residual leach-down of silver and gold from the heap leach pads is projected 
to continue through 2029. The projected mine life of the existing operation may increase if 
additional mineral resources are defined and can be converted to mineral reserves. 

The open pit has been designed with multiple phases to allow for earlier access to higher 
grade ore in the pit and to provide a smoothed mining schedule that minimizes peak open pit 
mining fleet requirements. Where excess ore is available in the mine plan, the mine will 
stockpile lower grade material to be processed later in the mine life. Silver and gold grades

are highly variable with annual head grades expected to vary between 24 ppm Ag and 
51 ppm Ag and between 0.48 ppm Au and 1.68 ppm Au during the mining phase. When 
mining has been completed and the stockpile is being processed, grades are expected to 
decline to approximately 16 ppm Ag and 0.24 ppm Au.  

 Life of mine plan of the proposed expanded operation 1.5.4
The preliminary economic assessment is based on measured, indicated, and inferred 
resources mined by a combination of open pit mining from within a reserve pit and 
underground mining methods, both designed using metal prices of $22 per ounce of silver 
and $1,300 per ounce of gold, and treated using the current heap leaching facilities at the 
current processing rate of 16,200 tonnes per day until 2016, at which point the pulp 
agglomeration plant would commence operations. The annual feed mining rates between 
2014 and 2024 are estimated to range between 5.0 million and 9.9 million tonnes.  

For the preliminary economic assessment, the open pit mine has been optimized and 
redesigned with the combined pulp agglomeration and heap leach process costs and metal 
recoveries and using metal prices of $22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. The 
life of mine plan for the expanded case includes an additional 5.6 million tonnes of ore from 
the open pit that was formerly uneconomic with the heap leach only metal recoveries and 
operating costs, as well as an additional 5.0 million tonnes of ore from the underground mine. 

A preliminary underground schedule based on the underground mine plan targets a feed rate 
of approximately 1,500 tonnes per day for 550,000 tonnes per year to feed the pulp 
agglomeration circuit in tandem with the coarser, lower grade feed from the open pit. Level 
development per heading is estimated to advance at a rate of 100 m per month, for a total of 
315 m per month of development. The planned schedule indicates development commencing 
in 2015 and full production achieved in 2018, with a mine life of approximately 12 years 
including construction time.  

The preliminary economic assessment assumes that construction of the pulp agglomeration 
plant is completed by the beginning of 2016 and processing starts at a rate of 5,600 tonnes 
per day (2.0 million tonnes per annum). With the start-up of the pulp agglomeration plant, 
the throughput of the existing crushing plant and heap leach system is reduced to 
14,400 tonnes per day (5.3 million tonnes per annum), while overall processing and stacking 
on the heap leach pads increases from the current 16,200 tonnes per day (5.9 million tonnes 
per annum) to 20,000 tonnes per day (7.3 million tonnes per annum).  

The preliminary economic analysis assumes that the open pit will continue until the end of 
2023 and that stockpiled open pit material will be processed in 2024 and 2025. The 
underground mine is anticipated to continue operations providing feed to the pulp 
agglomeration plant until into 2026. Production from residual leach-down of silver and gold 
from the heap leach pads is projected to continue through 2029. The projected mine life of 
the expanded operation may increase if additional mineral resources are defined and can be 
converted to mineral reserves. 

 Infrastructure of the existing operation 1.5.5
The existing mine infrastructure comprises three waste storage facilities, three leach pads, 
pregnant solution and overflow, run of mine stockpiles of material awaiting crushing, a three 
stage crushing plant, a Merrill-Crowe plant, a power generation plant, and maintenance

shops and warehouses. As the mine plan prioritizes the highest grade material available for 
crushing, approximately a dozen medium grade stockpiles are located around the mine site, 
awaiting crushing.  

A series of fixed and portable conveyor belts transport the crushed material to the leach 
pads. Pad 1 operated for the first two years of the mine life and is now currently on care and 
maintenance. Stacking on Pad 2 is nearly complete except for the transfer of a minor amount 
of partially leached ore from Pad 1. All stacking of fresh ore now takes place on Pad 3, with 
active leaching continuing in series on Pad 2 and Pad 3. 

 Infrastructure of the proposed expanded operation 1.5.6
This preliminary economic assessment considers an expansion of the mine with the 
development of a new 1,500 tonne per day capacity underground mine and the construction 
of a pulp agglomeration plant for processing the higher grade mined material. The 
agglomerated material will then be conveyed to the heap leach pads for leaching. The pulp 
agglomeration plant will be comprised of crushing, grinding, thickening, filtration, 
agglomeration, reagent, and auxiliary facilities. A cemented rock fill plant necessary for 
providing back fill and ground support to the underground operation will comprise a fully 
automated mixing plant where cement, aggregate, and water are combined in a concrete-
style drum mixer. These facilities will include a mixer structure, mixer feed conveyor, 
aggregate belt feeder, a slurry plant, and a cement silo.  

 New power line 1.5.7
Pan American has been working with an independent power line consultant to study the 
economic benefits of the installation of a power line to the Dolores operation to replace the 
existing diesel generators. An initial study completed by the Comisión Federal de Electricidad, 
the national power utility of Mexico ("CFE"), showed that the project is strongly economic, 
with initial capital costs in the $15 to $20 million range. The initial economics based on the 
projected power requirements in 2014 and the current diesel fuel consumption and costs 
indicated annual savings of $7.5 million in diesel fuel costs alone. Savings in the maintenance 
and replacement costs of the existing generators further add to the benefits of the Project. 
The additional power costs associated with the expanded operation, particularly for crushing 
and grinding, would essentially double the annual savings.  

Pan American is proceeding with the power line project, and negotiations with the land 
owners for right of way along the access route are currently underway. The connection to the 
Chihuahua electrical grid is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2016. 

 Mineral processing and recovery methods 1.6
 Current heap leaching method 1.6.1

Broken ore is trucked from the open pit to a crushing plant where the target treatment rate is 
a nominal 16,200 tonnes per day crushed to a target particle size of 80% of the particles 
passing ("P80") 6.3 mm in a three stage crushing circuit with a recirculating load. The crushed 
ore product is conveyed to the leach pads via an overland conveyor system, sampled at 
regular intervals from a material sampler, and placed on the pads using portable 
grasshoppers and a radial stacking system. Sodium cyanide solution is pumped to the leach

pads directly or to a holding tank near Pad 3, from where it is distributed to the heap leach 
pads and applied using a combination of drip and sprayer systems. The mine operates a 
closed circuit processing system without tailings facilities. 

Metal recoveries are a function of solution flow rates, cyanide concentration, and time, and 
the metal leaching period can cover years, continuing as subsequent lifts are placed on the 
pads. The pregnant leach solution containing the dissolved silver and gold is collected from 
the bottom of the leach piles via gravity collectors and/or vertical perforated steel pipes (well 
risers) fitted with internal pumps that transfer the solution to the pregnant solution pond. 
The solution is clarified, de-oxygenated, and processed through a Merrill-Crowe circuit with a 
nominal capacity of 1,000 cubic metres per hour to precipitate silver and gold from the 
cyanide solution. The clarified and de-oxygenated silver and gold cyanide solution is added to 
zinc dust, which triggers the precipitation of the silver and gold. The remaining barren cyanide 
solution is then recycled back to the heap leach pad for continued processing, while the 
precipitate in suspension is pumped to filter presses, where the resulting material containing 
zinc, gold, and silver is dried. The dried material is then mixed with fluxes and melted in a 
furnace to form doré bars.  

The bars are cleaned, assayed, weighed, and transported to a third party refinery in North 
America for final recovery. The doré bars typically contain between 1% and 5% gold and 
95% to 99% silver, with generally less than 1% impurities. 

The heap leach pads, ponds, and cyanide circuit are contained within a closed circuit and not 
released to the environment.  

Metallurgical recoveries during 2013 averaged 43% for silver and 82% for gold. 

Medium grade material may be placed on stockpiles allowing for the preferential crushing 
and stacking of higher grade material. Currently approximately a dozen such stockpiles are 
located around the mine workings.  

 Proposed pulp agglomeration method 1.6.2
Pulp agglomeration is the process of grinding ore and filtering it to form a moist pulp (the 
"pulp"), combining the pulp with cement, and tumbling to form round balls on the order of 
½ inch to 2 inches in diameter. In this process the fine pulp and cement particles are tumbled 
together in a drum at a controlled moisture content and feed rate such that they start to stick 
to each other. During the agglomeration process balls of material start to form, and as the 
tumbling continues more and more material adheres to these balls (the "agglomerates"). The 
cement acts as a binder that holds the particles together and gives the agglomerates strength 
to prevent them from crumbling as material is stacked on top of them during heap leaching. 
This is important to prevent the fine material being washed to the solution collection drains 
and in maintaining good permeability in the heap for percolation of cyanide solution down 
through the heap. The agglomerates remain very porous and permeable which allows the 
cyanide solution to contact with the increased surface area of the individual particles that is 
produced by grinding the high grade fraction of the ore deposit. This in turn results in 
increased metallurgical recoveries and improved metal recovery kinetics compared to the 
current coarse crushing and heap leaching process. 

The pulp agglomeration process will operate in an integrated fashion with the existing heap 
leach processing facilities. High grade run of mine material will be stockpiled on the existing

run of mine pad, separated from the medium grade run of mine material. The high grade 
material will be tipped into a bin using front end loaders, at a rate of 5,600 tonnes per day, 
then recovered from the bin by a vibrating grizzly feeder, delivered to a primary jaw crusher, 
and the discharge will be conveyed to a vibrating screen. Screen oversize will pass through a 
cone crusher in a closed loop to produce a rod mill feed with a P80 12.8 mm. The screen 
undersize will report to a discharge bin outfitted with two reclaim belt feeders. One of the 
reclaim belt feeders will report directly to the rod mill via a conveyor. The other reclaim belt 
feeder from the discharge will report to a conveyor and radial stacker for depositing onto a 
fine feed stockpile. The material will be recovered from this stockpile via multiple reclaim 
feeders and a reclaim tunnel conveyor system for eventual feed to the rod mill if necessary. 

The rod mill discharge will be pumped in closed circuit to a Vertimill/vibrating wet screen 
circuit. The screen oversize will report back to the Vertimill and the screen undersize will be 
pumped to a surge tank for feed to the pressure filters. This closed loop circuit is anticipated 
to produce a P80 of 0.425 mm (35 mesh) product.  

The milled slurry will be pumped from the surge tank to one of three horizontal pressure 
filters equipped with vertical plates, air blowers, and a membrane squeeze. The filtration 
process is necessary primarily to reduce the water content of the material to a level suitable 
for agglomeration and will also provide an opportunity for early recovery of a portion of the 
precious metal content that will be leached in the rod mills. The pressure filters will dewater 
the slurry and produce a filter cake of approximately 15% moisture. Recovered filtrate 
solution will be pumped to a pregnant solution holding tank for eventual metal recovery in 
the Merrill-Crowe plant.  

The dewatered filter cake will be discharged from the filter presses onto a belt conveyor with 
the possible addition of cement for feed to the rotating agglomerator drum. Additional 
solution will be sprayed onto the mixture within the drum as it tumbles in order to control the 
moisture content and formation of the agglomerate balls. The agglomerate balls will be 
discharged from the drum and conveyed to the heap leach pad feed conveyor where they will 
be combined with crushed low grade mineralized material to be conveyed to the existing 
heap leach pads.  

Most of the pulp agglomeration process make-up water for the high grade treatment circuit 
will be sourced by diverting a portion of the pregnant solution flow from the heap leach pads 
on its way to the Merrill-Crowe plant. The benefits of using pregnant solution in the pulp 
agglomeration plant include cost savings in sodium cyanide and solution pumping, optimizing 
the Merrill-Crowe and cementation process which improves with higher metals values in 
solution, and minimizing any increase in fresh water consumption. Additional cyanide solution 
will be sourced from a sodium cyanide solution make-up plant constructed next to the berm 
of heap leach Pad 3. The heap leach pads, ponds, and cyanide circuit will remain contained 
within a closed circuit and will not be released to the environment.  

No tailings disposal system is required as the pulp agglomeration process does not produce a 
tailings stream.

Preliminary Economic Assessment of a Pulp Agglomeration Treatment and Underground Option - Technical Report 

 

 Capital and operating costs and economic analyses 1.7
This preliminary economic assessment compares the relative value of the existing 
16,200 tonne per day heap leach operation and a 20,000 tonne per day pulp agglomeration 
and heap leach operation. Summary production and financial metrics of the two options are 
given in Table 1.3, assuming grid power costs. 

The project was evaluated on an after-tax, free cash flow basis. The income tax rate 
applicable to corporations in Mexico was increased from 28% to 30% effective 
January 1, 2014. A tax-deductible special mining duty of 7.5% was applied on earnings before 
the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. An additional 0.5% 
extraordinary mining duty on precious metals revenue (applicable to precious metals only) 
was assumed to be in effect as of January 1, 2014.  

The preliminary results indicate that the expansion Project has the potential to generate 
positive after tax economic returns using Pan American's current reserve metal prices of 
$22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. The Project economics also remain 
robust at metal prices of $19 per ounce of silver and $1,200 per ounce of gold. The Project 
will increase average annual silver production from 3.7 million ounces to 5.0 million ounces, 
while average annual gold production will increase from an estimated 111,000 ounces to 
148,000 ounces.

 Estimated capital, sustaining capital, and operating costs of the existing 1.7.1
operation 

The Dolores mine has been constructed and is in operation, however, capital expenditures 
that will be required in 2014 and 2015 regardless of the construction decision related to the 
expansion Project include $11.6 million to complete the current phase of construction on 
heap leach Pad 3, $15.2 million for the new power line, and a further $2.0 million for 
technical support to the operation and the expansion Project. 

Sustaining capital expenditures for the existing operation are estimated to total 
$118.8 million over the remaining mine life. This includes an estimated $60.4 million for 
mining, primarily for the rebuild and replacement of the open pit mining equipment fleet over 
the life of the operation. A further $42.1 million has been estimated for future construction of 
heap leach pad capacity after the current phase of construction. Other sustaining capital of 
$16.4 million is estimated for general and administrative ("G&A") purposes.  

For the estimate of operating costs, the existing operation is assumed to continue to mine, 
crush, and convey material to the heap leach pads at the same rate as the current 
16,200 tonnes per day. Mining costs are estimated to total $700.2 million to mine 
340.6 million total ore and waste tonnes, including the cost of stockpiling and re-handling 
stockpiles over the life of the mine. Processing costs are estimated to total $554.1 million to 
process 69.7 million tonnes, including the cost of solution recirculation for leach-down. G&A 
charges are estimated to total $170.8 million over the life of mine.

 Estimated capital, sustaining capital, and operating costs of the proposed 1.7.2
expanded operation 

The estimated capital cost over the life of the underground mine is $77.6 million. Of this, 
$34.8 million can be considered initial capital, which includes all costs incurred in the first two 
years and the cost of mobile equipment entering the fleet at the beginning of the third year. 
All primary access declines and ventilation designs are capitalized, while level development is 
capitalized during the first two years and treated as an operational expense thereafter.  

Based on the underground mining schedule, a cost model was developed that produced a 
total operating cost over the life of mine of $175.6 million, which equates to $34.94 per tonne 
of feed mined. Operating costs include all underground mining costs, up to the delivery of the 
feed to the crusher stockpile, or waste to the final backfill or waste rock facility location. Key 
inputs to the mining cost estimate include diesel fuel at $1.02 per litre, electrical power at 
$0.12 per kWh, and cement at $194 per tonne. Operating costs are estimated to be expended 
at an annual rate of between $15 and $18.5 million. 

The initial capital cost estimate for the pulp agglomeration process plant addresses the 
completion of design engineering, procurement, construction, and start-up of a nominal 
5,600 tonnes per day circuit for preparing a high grade silver and gold feed amenable to 
cyanide leaching via a heap leach pad. The initial capital costs are expected to be on the order 
of $69.6 million, including $35.3 million of direct capital, $20.0 million of indirect capital, and 
$14.3 million of contingency. 

Sustaining capital costs for the addition of a pulp agglomeration plant includes an estimate of 
an additional $6.4 million for the additional heap leach pad tonnage, $2.7 million for the pulp 
agglomeration plant, and a reduction of $0.3 million in G&A costs due to cut-back of one year 
of metal production because of the higher treatment rate with the addition of the pulp 
agglomeration plant as well as better recovery kinetics of the pulp agglomerated material. 
Operating costs are estimated at $339.5 million, including $112.8 million for reagents and 
consumables, and $54.7 million in G&A.  

 Estimated financial metrics of the existing operation 1.7.3
The operating cash flow of the existing operation is anticipated to total $825.8 million, which 
is comprised of an estimated revenue of $2,602.9 million, $1,425.1 million in operating costs, 
$21.9 million in smelting and refining charges, $13.0 million relating to the new 0.5% 
extraordinary mining duty on gross revenue, $72.3 million on third-party royalties, 
$71.6 million relating to the new 7.5% special mining duty on earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"), and $171.0 million in income taxes. After 
accounting for reclamation and capital expenditures, the total net cash flow for the operation 
is estimated to be $671.4 million. The after tax NPV at an 8% discount rate is estimated at 
$389.6 million. 

 Estimated financial metrics of the proposed expanded operation 1.7.4
The operating cash flow of the expanded operation is anticipated to increase to 
$1,163.6 million, comprised of $3,377.1 million in revenue, $1,723.5 million in operating 
costs, $28.6 million in smelting and refining charges, $16.9 million relating to the new 
extraordinary mining duty, $93.7 million in third party royalties, $103.8 million relating to the

new special mining duty, and $244.6 million in income taxes payable to the government. After 
accounting for reclamation and capital expenditures, the total net cash flow for the operation 
is estimated to be $853.3 million. The after tax NPV at an 8% discount rate is estimated at 
$479.8 million.  

 Environmental, social, and community impact 1.8
The most significant environmental liabilities associated with the Dolores Property include 
surface disturbance and reclamation liabilities and issues related to the stability and 
containment system of heap leach Pad 1, which developed prior to Pan American's 
acquisition of the Property. Pan American has implemented additional contingency measures 
in and around leach Pads 1 and 2, and has commenced the relocation of ore to Pad 2 to allow 
rebuilding of Pad 1 for future operation. Pan American has also completed construction and is 
operating an extension to Pad 2, after application of rigorous quality control to both the 
design and construction of the facility, and has finalized construction of the first phase of 
Pad 3.  

The Dolores staff community relations team implements an extensive program of community 
engagement activities including information sessions, infrastructure works, and educational 
and training programs for local people, which have resulted in the establishment of several 
important businesses. Unskilled workers are sourced from nearby small villages, and the 
company has recruiting and training programmes in place to develop the mining skills of the 
local workforce. 

Due to the relative scale, the physical and organizational changes proposed in the expansion 
Project are unlikely to modify the existing environmental and social impacts at the Property. A 
permit modification for the Project would be lodged with the Mexican authorities and the 
processing of that permit application is not expected to create unmanageable time delays or 
risk to the realization of the Project.  

There are no known environmental or social issues that could materially impact the mine's 
ability to extract the mineral resources or mineral reserves or affect the viability of the 
expansion Project.  

 Conclusions and recommendations 1.9
 Existing operation 1.9.1

The Dolores mine was acquired by Pan American in 2012 as part of the acquisition of 
Minefinders. Pan American has operated the mine for the last two years, and following an 
initial period of investment, particularly in building heap leach pad capacity, the operation is 
now at steady state.  

This technical report demonstrates that the proven and probable mineral reserves in the 
mine plan will be economic with the forecast metal prices and other assumptions. Based on 
the current mineral reserves, the mine is projected to continue to produce silver and gold 
until 2030. This projected mine life may increase if additional mineral resources are defined 
and can be converted to mineral reserves. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         24 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -

There are no known drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the 
reliability of the drilling results used to estimate mineral resources and reserves. Pan 
American intends to continue annual near-mine diamond drilling programmes to test the 
southern and down dip extents of the currently defined mineralization and to conduct regular 
infill drilling of the deposit to upgrade mineral resource and reserve confidence categories.  

There are no known significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to 
affect the reliability or confidence in the mineral resource and reserve estimates. Pan 
American routinely conducts reconciliation of the reserve model to the grade control model 
and to the heap leach feed conveyor weight meter and sampler in order to monitor actual 
mine versus model performance. Between January and the end of May, 2014, sample grade 
information obtained from closer spaced grade control drilling (10 m along strike and 15 m 
across strike) has allowed the operation to identify and economically mine additional lower 
grade material in some areas that was either not identified by the exploration drillhole data 
used to estimate the mineral reserve, or else was not supported by sufficient data to estimate 
the tonnes and grade of the mineralization to mineral reserve levels of confidence. 
Additionally, in some areas the closer spaced grade control drilling has revealed less physical 
continuity of the economic zones as assumed by the interpretation of the wider spaced 
exploration data. These two factors have resulted in the operation mining year to date 21% 
more ore tonnes at a 17% lower silver grade and a 26% lower gold grade, for a difference of 
nil in silver ounces and 10% fewer gold ounces relative to the tonnes, grade, and contained 
metal estimated in the reserve model.  

For the existing heap leach only operation, column leach testing on a range of mineralization 
grades and lithologies from the Dolores deposit yielded gold recoveries ranging between 
51% and 91%, and silver recoveries between 23% and 74%, all at a target particle size of 
P80 6.3 mm. The metallurgical recovery model created for the mineral reserve estimate 
estimates gold recoveries of 81.5% for oxides and 66.1% for mixed and sulphide ores, and 
silver recoveries of 47.4% for oxides and 59.2% for mixed and sulphide ores. The kinetic 
model created for the mineral reserve estimate assumes a three year period to achieve 
ultimate gold recovery and five years to achieve ultimate silver recovery. The authors have 
reviewed these models and conclude that they are consistent with recovery tracking 
observations in the heap leach operation at the mine. 

Pan American should continue to optimize blasting patterns, including continuing to measure 
blast movements, and to monitor pit slope stability, as per good mining practices.  

 Proposed expanded operation 1.9.2
For the expansion Project, it is the authors' opinion that sufficient test work has been 
conducted to confirm that the recovery of silver and gold increase at finer grind size at 
Dolores. The metallurgical recovery model created for the pulp agglomeration of high grade 
mineralization presented in this preliminary economic assessment estimates gold recoveries 
of 89.3% for oxides and 82.4% for mixed and sulphide material and silver recoveries of 66.1% 
for oxides and 76.7% for mixed and sulphide material, all at a particle size of P80 425 microns. 
The kinetic model created for pulp agglomeration assumes a one year period to achieve 
ultimate gold recovery from oxide material and two years to achieve ultimate gold recovery 
from mixed and sulphide material. The ultimate silver recovery of all material types subject to 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         25 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -

pulp agglomeration is assumed to take two years. The authors conclude that these models 
are reasonable and respect the available data. 

The load / permeability tests that have been conducted and the experience gained from other 
operations using a similar process provide a reasonable degree of assurance that the 
agglomerates will remain stable in the heap leach stack. The ponding issue on the master 
composite using 15 kg/t of cement and shortened curing time is an indication that the 
operation would need to be vigilant in ensuring a minimum of 20 kg/t of cement and 
adequate curing time during actual operations. 

The pilot plant testing results provide a good degree of confidence for rod and Vertimill sizing. 
Filtration and other testing have also been conducted. The authors consider that the 
metallurgical and recovery methods have been developed to the point to confirm the 
concepts. 

The expansion Project construction could be completed over a period of 15 to 18 months and 
would involve increasing the current treatment rate from roughly 16,500 to 20,000 tonnes 
per day by processing the high grade portion of the mined material through a pulp 
agglomeration treatment plant and conveying the agglomerated material with the crushed 
lower grade portion of the mined material to the heap leach pads for leaching. The pulp 
agglomeration plant would be comprised of crushing, grinding, particle size classification, 
thickening, filtration, agglomeration, and reagent facilities. The pulp agglomeration process of 
liberating metals by grinding has the advantage of improved leaching kinetics and ultimate 
recovery of precious metals in the high grade material relative to the existing heap leach 
method. The improvement in recovery of the high grade fraction due to pulp agglomeration is 
estimated at around 19% for silver and 13% for gold. This results in an overall improvement in 
metal recovery of around 7% for both silver and gold for the entire mineral inventory. 

The preliminary economic assessment of expanding the Dolores mine by adding a milling and 
pulp agglomeration circuit to the processing flow sheet to enhance silver and gold recoveries 
of higher grade mineralization, as well as by developing an underground mine to extract 
mineral resources that exist beneath and to the south of the ultimate open pit floor, has been 
shown to have positive economic results.  

Underground mining is expected to occur concurrently with open pit mining, and will be 
developed to commence production at approximately the same time as the pulp 
agglomeration plant construction is completed. The proposed underground mining method is 
open stoping, a low cost mechanized bulk mining method appropriate for the competent 
ground conditions present at the mine that allows for a near complete extraction of the 
mineable inventory. A preliminary underground schedule based on the underground mine 
plan targets a production rate of approximately 1,500 tonnes per day to feed the pulp 
agglomeration circuit in tandem with the high grade portion of the material from the open pit 
mine. The planned schedule indicates underground development commencing in 2015 with 
full production achieved in 2018 and a mine life of approximately 12 years, including 
construction time. 

The expansion Project will increase total average annual silver production from 3.7 million 
ounces to 5.0 million ounces, while total average annual gold production will increase from an 
estimated 111,000 ounces to 148,000 ounces. The projected mine life of the expanded 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         26 of 171

operation may increase if additional mineral resources are defined and can be converted to 
mineral reserves. 

The expansion Project also considers cost savings in replacing onsite power generation with 
the installation of a high voltage power line approximately 110 km long to connect the 
Dolores operation with the main electrical grid in Chihuahua. 

The preliminary economic assessment is based on a mineral inventory of approximately 
80.3 million tonnes of oxide, sulphide, and mixed oxide/sulphide material sourced from a 
combination of open pit and underground mining and treated at a rate of 20,000 tonnes per 
day, including 14,400 tonnes per day from the existing crusher and 5,600 tonnes per day from 
the pulp agglomeration plant. The estimated after tax NPV of the incremental cash flow at an 
8% discount rate is $90.2 million, with an internal rate of return of 33% and a capital payback 
period of 1.7 years, using the Company's current reserve metal prices of $22 per ounce of 
silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. At metal prices of $19 per ounce of silver and $1,200 per 
ounce of gold, the estimated after tax NPV of the incremental cash flow at an 8% discount is 
$65.6 million, with an internal rate of return of 27%. 

The initial capital requirements for the Project are estimated at $104.5 million, including 
$69.7 million for the pulp agglomeration plant and $34.8 million for the underground mine. 
Other capital projects that are required for the expansion to be successful, but which will 
proceed regardless of the construction decision related to the expansion Project, include an 
estimated $15.2 million for the power line installation, $11.6 million for leach pad 
construction, and $2.0 million for technical support to the operation. 

Sustaining capital costs are estimated at $170.3 million, including $60.4 million for the open 
pit mine, $48.4 million for the expanded heap leach pad operation, $42.8 million for the 
underground mine, $16.1 million for G&A, and $2.7 million for the pulp agglomeration plant. 
Many of these sustaining capital expenditures will be required regardless of the construction 
decision related to the expansion Project. The incremental sustaining capital expenditures 
associated with the Project total $51.5 million spread over the mine life. 

Operating costs in the open pit mine vary by depth and haul distance and are estimated to 
average $1.91 per tonne over the life of mine. Underground mining costs are estimated to 
average $34.94 per tonne. Heap leach costs with the benefit of grid power beginning in 2016 
and the additional volume from the pulp agglomeration plant will decline by approximately 
$2 per tonne. Pulp agglomeration costs with grid power and sharing the cost of the existing 
facilities that will be used for all material (Merrill-Crowe plant, refinery, and leaching system) 
are estimated at $15.20 per tonne. G&A costs for the mine and heap leach are estimated to 
be $1.99 per tonne and $3.01 per tonne for pulp agglomeration. 

There are no known significant risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to 
affect the reliability and confidence in the projected economic outcomes. The preliminary 
economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources which are 
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them 
that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that 
the assessment will be realized. 

Pan American has decided to defer making a construction decision for the next nine to 
12 months while it invests a modest amount of capital (estimated at $3.0 to $5.0 million) to 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         27 of 171

proceed with additional studies, and continue the delineation of the underground accessible 
mineralization, in order to further de-risk the Project. This will allow Pan American more time 
to operate the mine at its optimum steady state, prior to introducing further investment and 
changes, and to continue to reconcile actual mining results with mineral reserve estimates to 
ensure the reliability of the mineral resource and reserve estimates, which form the basis for 
the expansion plan. The mine plan indicates that the highest incremental returns from the 
Project do not commence until 2017, when mining of higher grade material from the open pit 
begins, and as a consequence there is a built-in window of time to further de-risk the Project 
without sacrificing the economic returns, while monitoring the prices of silver and gold. 

It is recommended to advance the preliminary economic assessment of the proposed 
expansion Project to a pre-feasibility study level. This will require more detailed engineering, 
mine plans, test work, and cost estimates to more accurately assess the technical feasibility 
and economic viability of the Project and to finalize the anticipated flow sheet. The cost of 
this work is estimated at approximately $1.45 million. 

The secondary crushing equipment selected for this study has been sized in common with the 
existing crushing plant, which affords benefits in areas such as spares stockholding. If the run 
of mine feed size can be reduced by varying the blasting practices in the pit, then smaller and 
less expensive primary and secondary crushing equipment may be used. It is recommended 
to evaluate the benefits of varying the blasting practices in the pit in order to reduce the size 
and cost of the crushing equipment in the pulp agglomeration plant. 

An opportunity lies in diverting the rod mill product to pre-leach holding tanks for early 
recovery of silver and gold prior to the thickening and filtration process. This option may be 
more attractive at higher metal prices. Additional studies are required to compare the 
additional capital and operating costs versus the advantage of improved kinetics.  

The authors recommend exploring opportunities to optimize the filtration equipment. There 
is an opportunity to use vacuum filters if medium grade material is added to the 
agglomeration drums to help control the moisture content while forming agglomerates. 
Diverting the crushed medium grade material to the agglomeration drum circuit will add 
flexibility to the high grade filter cake moisture content; however the system will be exposed 
to the variability in the moisture content of the crushed medium grade that changes with the 
seasons at the mine. It is recommended to quantify the peaks of maximum moisture content 
in the crushed medium grade material in order to evaluate the optimization of filtration 
equipment.  

Pan American is currently preparing samples for additional load permeability tests to assess 
the behaviour of the agglomerates under the current design conditions and height of the 
heap leach pads. Initial tests have confirmed the permeability with 20 kg of cement per tonne 
of high grade material, and further testing with variable feed is recommended. An estimated 
$1 million will be required for the additional testing, the trade-offs, and to advance the 
engineering and cost estimates of the process area to a pre-feasibility study level.  

The authors recommend advancing the expansion studies to a pre-feasibility study level to 
update the recovery and cost parameters and to re-optimize the pit design used in the 
estimation of mineral reserves. The open pit mining plan used in the preliminary economic 
assessment has a slightly higher production rate than is currently achieved at the mine and 
additional open pit production is expected to be supplied by an existing contractor and by 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         28 of 171

purchasing additional mine haulage trucks. Implementation of the pulp agglomeration 
processing option will require additional mining selectivity to separate the high grade portion 
of the deposit for grinding, which will require a manageable adjustment to current grade 
control practices, but is not likely to result in significant additional mining costs. 

The authors further recommend advancing the underground studies to a pre-feasibility study 
level in order to convert the underground mineral resources to mineral reserves. This will 
require pre-feasibility study level underground mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost 
models so that the value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a 
higher level of confidence. Other studies will include advancing geotechnical test work and 
analyses, addressing the open pit and underground interactions and interfaces, and assessing 
the appropriating mining and back filling techniques. Work should also be done to understand 
the geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine. 

Given the high level of existing knowledge about the geology and ground conditions at the 
site, the amount of test work required for a pre-feasibility study for the underground mine is 
anticipated to be much less than at a greenfield project. Key items to be addressed for a 
future study include: 

• Additional studies of potential water inflow and water pumping requirements. 

• Improving the confidence of inferred resources which make up around two thirds of 
the underground inventory. The primary access decline for the underground could 
provide improved sites for diamond drilling to target structures beneath the pit. 

• Advancing the level of geotechnical knowledge, particularly where the underground 
and open pit operations will be in close proximity to each other. 

• Conducting a more detailed assessment of the cemented rock fill requirements and 
schedule.  

• Understanding the geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine. 

• Identify the permitting requirements for the addition of an underground operation.  

• Develop pre-feasibility level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models so that 
the value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a higher 
level of confidence. 

The estimated costs of pre-feasibility level underground mine designs, plans, schedules, and 
cost models is $450,000. Given a positive outcome of these studies, Pan American may 
conclude that the most effective method of assessing the geotechnical and geothermal 
conditions and to improve the confidence of the inferred resource will be to develop part of 
the primary access decline for underground and some of the planned level accesses prior to 
making a final production decision on the underground mine. 

As the pulp agglomeration plant and the underground are expansions to the existing Dolores 
mine, Pan American may consider that upgrading only a portion of the inferred mineral 
resource prior to making a decision on construction of the pulp agglomeration plant and the 
underground mine may be an acceptable risk.

 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -  

Preliminary Economic Assessment of a Pulp Agglomeration Treatment and Underground Option - Technical Report 

 

2 Introduction 
This technical report has been prepared by Pan American Silver Corp. ("Pan American") in 
compliance with the disclosure requirements of Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-
101), to disclose relevant information about the Dolores Property. This information has 
resulted from additional mineral resource and reserve delineation drilling, updated mineral 
resource and mineral reserve estimates, and a preliminary economic assessment of an 
expansion of the Dolores mine to include pulp agglomeration treatment and an underground 
mine to extract economic material from beneath the current pit limits. This technical report 
supports the disclosure of the updated mineral resources and reserves and the results of the 
preliminary economic assessment. 

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

The effective date of this technical report is May 31, 2014. The drilling data cut-off date for 
the geological interpretation and mineral resource estimation was October 22, 2013. The 
economic analysis to determine the appropriate cut-off values for reporting mineral 
resources was complete by May 31, 2014, and the in situ mineral resources and reserves 
were depleted for mining and stockpiles were inventoried as at May 31, 2014. No new 
material information has become available between these dates and the signature date given 
on the certificate of the qualified persons.  

Pan American is a silver mining and exploration company listed on the Toronto (TSX:PAA) and 
NASDAQ (NASDAQ:PAAS) stock exchanges.

4 Property description and location 

 Location, issuer's interest, mineral tenure, and surface rights 4.1
The Dolores mine is located in Chihuahua state, Mexico, approximately 250 km west of the 
city of Chihuahua, at 29°00' North, 108°32' West. Pan American is the 100% owner of the 
Dolores mine and the mining concessions, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Compañía 
Minera Dolores S.A. de C.V. A Google map of the Property location is given in Figure 4.1. 

Figure 4.1 Property location map 

 

 

The mineral rights are held under three contiguous mining concessions with a total area of 
27,700 hectares covering the entire mineral resources, mineral reserves, and surface 
infrastructure. Pan American makes the required semi-annual payments to maintain the 
mining concessions and has agreements in place granting surface rights and legal access to 
the mining operations, and to Pan American's knowledge, all obligations required for the 
conduct of mining operations at Dolores are currently in good standing. Details of the mining 
concessions are given in Table 4.1. A plan prepared by Pan American of the mining 
concessions and surface rights relative to the pit outline as at May 31, 2014 is given in Figure 
4.2.

 Royalties, back-in rights, payments, agreements, and encumbrances 4.2
A net smelter return of 2% on silver production and 3.25% on gold production is payable to 
RG Mexico Inc., a subsidiary of Royal Gold Inc. There are no other known back-in rights, 
payments, agreements, or encumbrances in place.  

 Environmental liabilities 4.3
The most significant environmental liabilities associated with the Dolores Property include 
surface disturbance and reclamation liabilities and issues related to the stability and 
containment system of heap leach Pad 1, which developed prior to Pan American's 
acquisition of the Property. A tear in the liner of Pad 1 developed in June 2010 following 
movement in the stability berm and significant leakage was collected by the leak collection 
system. Minefinders ceased stacking and irrigation on Pad 1 and relocated approximately 
2 million tonnes of ore to heap leach Pad 2. The pad under the excavated material was 
examined and stabilized with an additional retaining wall structure, and the damaged liner 
was repaired. No sodium cyanide was detected in the downstream surface and ground water 
sampling points as a result of the failure, and continued soil and water sampling below Pad 1 
has confirmed that no residual cyanide is present.  

Approximately 8 to 9 million tonnes of ore remain in a stable state on Pad 1, awaiting transfer 
to another operational pad. A small portion of that ore is currently being transferred by truck 
to Pad 2 to complete that pad's design capacity. Full remediation of the liner system will be 
required as the life of mine plan and leach pad capacity estimates indicate that Pad 1 will be 
required for use in the future. The additional costs associated with moving the ore and 
reconstructing the pad, as well as the additional metal production from the partially spent ore 
currently on Pad 1, have been accounted for in the life of mine plan. 

Pan American has implemented additional contingency measures in and around leach Pads 1 
and 2, including the installation of well riser type over-liner solution collection systems, 
additional under drain and leak collection systems, and a network of containment, 
monitoring, and demonstration wells. Pan American has also completed construction and is 
operating an extension to Pad 2, after application of rigorous quality control to both the 
design and construction of the facility, and has finalized construction of the first phase of 
Pad 3.  

The surface disturbance and reclamation liabilities are addressed under Pan American's 
project reclamation and closure plan, which is discussed in Section 20.10. 

 Permits 4.4
Pan American holds all necessary environmental and operating permits for the development 
and operating of the existing mine and is in compliance with Mexican law.  

Permit applications for the construction and operation of Dolores, including an Environmental 
Impact Study or Manifestation ("MIA"), a Technical Justification Study for Change of Land-
Use, and an Environmental Risk Study were approved by the Mexican Secretariat of 
Environment and Natural Resources ("SEMARNAT") in April 2006. These studies include a full 
assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the mine and environmental 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         36 of 171

management plans, which describe the ongoing management and environmental monitoring 
programs. Other principal permits include an Accident Prevention Program, a Surface Water 
Extraction Authorization, an MIA for an underground exploration ramp, and a Waste 
Management Plan. These permits are renewed regularly and as far as Pan American is aware, 
all of the permits required for the mine and processing operations are in good standing.  

Modifications to the existing permits will be necessary to obtain authorization for future 
activities such as adjustments to the life of mine open pit operations, waste rock facilities, 
and leach pads; expansion of the processing facilities to include additional crushing and a new 
grinding, leaching, and pulp agglomeration circuit; and development of an underground mine. 
Any modification application for these activities will require an updated MIA, Environmental 
Risk Assessment, and Technical Justification Study for Land Use Change. The required 
technical baseline studies and impact assessment for these updates would be based on the 
extensive monitoring database that has been developed over the past seven years, and 
conducted by an independent environmental consultant. Due to the minor changes in 
footprint and the overall impacts that these changes imply, as well as the current good 
standing of the existing permits, it is expected that the necessary permit modifications could 
be completed within standard regulatory timeframes of five to seven months.  

The power line connection from Chihuahua will be the subject of a separate approvals 
process managed with the CFE. 

 Significant factors and risks 4.5
There are no known significant factors or risks that may affect access, title, or the right or 
ability to conduct mining, processing, and exploration at Dolores.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         37 of 171

5 Accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure, and 
physiography 

Information in this section is referenced and updated from Chlumsky, et. al. (2011).  

 Physiography and climate 5.1
The topography at the mine site is rugged, with elevations ranging from 1,200 to 
2,000 metres above sea level. The vegetation is typical of the foothills of the Sierra Madre and 
ranges from thorn scrub and cactus to oak and pine forests at higher elevations. The climate 
is also typical of the Sierra Madre with an average annual temperature of 18° C, an annual low 
of -10° C, and an annual high of 45° C. Annual precipitation averages around 250 millimetres, 
with much of it occurring between July and September as brief heavy rainstorms. Short-lived 
snowfall is common in December and January. Mining and exploration work may be carried 
out year round.  

 Accessibility, local resources, population centres, and transport 5.2
The main road access to the Property is via 92 kilometres of unpaved roads leading north 
from Federal Highway 16, near Yepachic, Chihuahua. Access for personnel is also provided by 
an unpaved landing strip suitable for light aircraft, located about 8 kilometres from the mine. 
The nearest major population centre is at the city of Chihuahua, located 250 kilometres to the 
east. Employees travel to the mine either by road or by light aircraft, while materials come by 
road.  

The local economy is based on logging, ranching, and subsistence farming. Unskilled workers 
are sourced from nearby small villages, and the company has recruiting and training 
programmes in place to develop the local workforce. Much of the mine workforce is 
supplemented from the town of Ciudad Madera located 50 km east of Dolores, from the city 
of Chihuahua, and from the city of Hermosillo in the state of Sonora, located 350 kilometres 
to the west. Both Sonora and Chihuahua states have an established mining culture and 
provide a pool of experienced workers, as well as vendors and contractors who provide 
services to the Dolores site.  

 Surface rights 5.3
The majority of the surface rights on the Property are owned by Ejido Huizopa. An ejido is an 
area of communal land registered with the National Agrarian Registry of Mexico and parcelled 
out to community members for agricultural use. Pan American has surface rights agreements 
with Ejido Huizopa and with several individual members of the Ejido dating from November 
2006 which allows for irrevocable access and the right to carry out exploration and mining 
activities for a term of 15 years with a right to extend for a further 15 years. These surface 
rights provide sufficient access to the mining operations, waste storage areas, heap leach pad 
areas, and other facilities.

 Power and water 5.4
Water for the operations is sourced from wells, the historical underground workings, pit 
dewatering activities, the nearby Tutuaca River, and more recently from the Chabacan dam. 
The wells yield 9 litres of water per second while the nominal pumping capacity from the river 
is 47 litres per second from an available supply of 57 litres per second. Water availability from 
the river is substantially limited during the dry season, which typically runs from April to June. 
Water supply lines have been installed from the Tutuaca River to the Chabacan dam which is 
located to the west of the waste storage facility and then from the dam to the processing 
facilities. The Chabacan dam reservoir has a capacity of 1.2 million cubic metres and provides 
storm water control as well as the primary water storage. The permitted water usage from 
the Tutuaca River is 2.0 million cubic metres per annum at a maximum rate of 64 litres per 
second. The current consumption is well under this limit with annual water usage estimated 
at approximately 800,000 cubic metres.  

Power is currently generated on site by six 1,800 kW Cummins and two 1,200 kW Caterpillar 
diesel generators. This reserve provides the start current requirements of the existing primary 
or tertiary crusher motors and also allows for planned and unplanned shutdown of two 
generating sets for maintenance, without disturbing the plant operations. The existing power 
station capacity is a total of 13.2 MW. In 2014, the power demand for the existing operations 
are forecast to average 6.8 MW, reaching a maximum of 8.4 MW when re-starting the crusher 
motors, which are the largest motors on site. Power costs using diesel generators are 
anticipated to be in the order of $0.29 per kilowatt hour, depending on the cost of diesel.  

Pan American has been working with an independent power line consultant to study the 
economic benefits of the installation of a high voltage power line to the Dolores operation to 
replace the existing diesel generators. An initial study completed by the CFE, showed that the 
project is strongly economic, with initial capital costs in the $15 to $20 million range. The 
initial economics based on the projected power requirements in 2014 and the current diesel 
fuel consumption and costs indicated annual savings of $7.5 million in diesel fuel costs alone. 
Savings in the maintenance and replacement costs of the existing generators further add to 
the benefits of the project. The additional power costs associated with the expanded 
operation, particularly for crushing and grinding, would essentially double the annual savings.  

Pan American is proceeding with the power line project, and negotiations with the land 
owners for right of way along the access route are currently underway. The connection to the 
Chihuahua electrical grid is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2016. There is 
some uncertainty associated with these negotiations in determining the final cost and 
schedule. The current estimate for completion is between $15 million to $20 million with a 
two year period required for right of way negotiation, environmental assessment, permitting, 
and construction.  

 Infrastructure 5.5
The existing infrastructure includes the typical components of an operating open pit mine, 
including the mine workings, the processing facilities, heap leach pads, medium grade 
mineralization stockpiles, waste rock storage facilities, workshops, laboratories, storage 
facilities, offices, drill core and logging sheds, water and power lines, access roads, a light

6 History 
Information in this section is referenced and updated from Chlumsky, et. al. (2011).  

Placer mining began in the region of the Dolores mine in the 1860s and was followed by lode 
mining in 1898. A power line from the town of Madera was installed in 1915, and a 25 tonne 
per day stamp mill began treating the Dolores ore until it was destroyed by fire in early 1929. 
Only sporadic production occurred from 1929 to 1931, after which there are no further 
records of any historical production. Incomplete mining records from between 1922 and 1931 
indicate that on the order of 372,000 tonnes of ore containing over 116,000 ounces of gold 
and 6 million ounces of silver were mined from several underground operations, including 
Dolores.  

The Property lay idle until 1993 when Minefinders Ltd. began acquiring a land position in the 
district. Minefinders began a full exploration programme in November 1995 and commenced 
drilling programmes in September 1996, using both diamond and reverse circulation drilling 
methods.  

In July 1996, Minefinders granted Echo Bay Mines ("Echo Bay") an option in the Property and 
Echo Bay commenced drilling, sampling, environmental data collection, and metallurgical 
testing. Minefinders bought back the option, including the information collected by Echo Bay, 
in October 1997.  

A number of historical mineral resource estimates have been prepared for the Property since 
1997. In 2003 Minefinders commenced a feasibility study to evaluate various process options 
and in June 2005 disclosed a mineral reserve estimate and the results of a technically and 
financially feasible operation involving open pit mining operations and heap leaching of 
tertiary crushed ore followed by the Merrill-Crowe process for silver and gold metal recovery. 
Following the results of the positive feasibility study, Minefinders undertook detailed 
engineering and optimization of the mine plan as well as updates to the mineral resource and 
mineral reserve estimates. 

Construction of the mine began at the end of 2006, with the commissioning period occurring 
between September 2008 and January 2009. The construction of the treatment process 
followed the recommendations made in the 2005 feasibility study and comprised a crushing 
plant, conveying and stacking facilities, leach pads, solution ponds, and Merrill-Crowe and 
refining facilities. The first doré was produced in November 2008 and commercial production 
began in May 2009. During the 2008 to 2011 period, Minefinders mined 25.5 million tonnes 
and stacked 18.3 million tonnes of ore on the leach pads, producing 210,660 ounces of gold 
and 6.2 million ounces of silver. The remaining low grade material has been stored in 
stockpiles for later treatment. 

Pan American acquired the Dolores mine from Minefinders at the end of March 2012 and 
assumed control of mining operations in April 2012. As at December 31, 2013, 13.3 million 
ounces of silver and 335,200 ounces of gold have been produced from modern operations at 
Dolores.

7 Geological setting and mineralization 
Information in this section is referenced from Pratt (2013).  

 Regional geology 7.1
Pre-Tertiary rocks in northern and mid-Mexico comprise a jigsaw of oceanic and island arc 
terranes (Campa and Coney, 1983). Figure 7.1 shows a regional map of the tectono-
stratigraphic terranes of Mexico, as redrawn from Campa and Coney (1983). These elongate 
terranes create the mostly northwest structural grain apparent on national and regional 
maps. Strike-slip movements, driven by Pacific microplates pushing into the Caribbean, played 
an important role in assembling the terranes. This process continues to the present day, 
exemplified by the major dextral (right lateral) offset on the San Andreas Fault system, which 
continues into the Gulf of California before joining the East Pacific Rise. 

Dolores occurs within the Sierra Madre Occidental volcanic belt, an arc formed by eastward 
subduction of the Pacific Plate. The lower part of the arc comprises late Cretaceous to early 
Tertiary calc-alkaline batholiths and equivalent volcanosedimentary rocks. This is generally 
referred to as the 'Lower Volcanic Supergroup' or 'Lower Volcanic Series' (McDowell and 
Keizer, 1977, Wark et. al., 1990, and Wark, 1991). It represents magmatic activity during the 
mostly thin-skinned Laramide orogeny (about 80 to 40 million years ago). This was followed 
by two periods of major ignimbrite eruption in the early Oligocene and early Miocene. 
Collectively these constitute the 'Upper Volcanic Supergroup' or 'Series' (McDowell and 
Keizer, 1977). The ignimbrites were accompanied by minor andesite/basalt flows and rhyolitic 
domes. Age dating suggests that the Upper Volcanic Supergroup began to be erupted at 
about 35 to 32 million years ago and finished around 27 million years ago in the northern 
Sierra Madre Occidental (Wark et. al., 1990 and Wark, 1991).  

Precise isotopic dates are sparse, but many Mexican low sulphidation epithermal deposits 
probably developed during the first ignimbrite phase, in a window between 40 and 27 million 
years ago (Camprubí et. al., 2003). Many deposits seem associated with the calderas that 
produced the voluminous ignimbrites, for example the Ocampo Caldera. The epithermal belt 
overprints an older belt of Eocene copper-molybdenum porphyries that includes Cananea and 
La Caridad (Barra et. al., 2005).

 Local geology 7.2
The best available geological mapping is shown on the 1:250,000 Madera (H12-9) and 
Tecoripa (H12-12) sheets produced by the Servicio Geológico Mexicano and are available on 
their website. The local geology shown in Figure 7.2 is based on these maps. 

Bedding dips are mostly sub horizontal and gently undulating. The maps show a strong north-
northwest structural grain defined by many faults, some with apparent normal offsets. Some 
of these regional faults probably had a syn-depositional history, controlling local basins.  

Dolores lies about 42 km north-northeast of the Mulatos high sulphidation epithermal gold 
deposits and 82 km north-northwest of Pinos Altos. Pinos Altos, a low sulphidation epithermal 
vein system, lies on the northeast rim of the 30 km diameter Ocampo Caldera. This caldera 
hosts a district of epithermal gold-silver deposits, including the Ocampo mine.

 Lithostratigraphy 7.3.1
The Property lithostratigraphy was previously split into 'Lower' and 'Upper Volcanic Series', 
with a major unconformity inferred between them (Overbay et. al., 2001) and tentatively 
correlated with the Upper and Lower Volcanic supergroups, although there is no definitive 
work or mapping to confirm the correlation. It was suggested that mineralization occurred 
before deposition of the Upper Volcanic Series (Overbay et. al., 2001). However, recent 
mapping shows no clearly exposed stratigraphic break and the observed contacts between 
the two series comprise mostly faults, as shown in the cartoon of the stratigraphic and 
structural relations given in Figure 7.3. The most important faults, from west to east, are the 
Chupacabras, San Francisco, and East faults. The San Francisco and its footwall host most of 
the mineralization on the Property.

Lower Volcanic Series 
A simplified geological map of the Dolores Property is given in Figure 7.4. The Lower Volcanic 
Series is divided in two by Overbay et. al. (2001) and consists of a lower andesitic sequence 
overlain by latites. The main andesitic outcrop forms a wide strip between the San Francisco 
and East faults. It is the main host for mineralization and is cut by a swarm of north-northwest 
striking dikes. It comprises alternating dark and light green units. Dark green units comprise

massive, porphyritic andesite and basaltic andesite while feldspar and clinopyroxene 
phenocrysts occur in the aphanitic groundmass. The light units are either strongly 
amygdaloidal andesite or monomict andesitic breccias (autobreccias and transported volcanic 
breccias). There are also minor hyaloclastites and hyalotuffs. The light green colour comes 
from abundant epidote, sometimes in excess of 15%, locally giving a skarn-like appearance. 
Peperite forms at the bases of some andesite by the interaction of igneous rock and wet 
sediments.

Other rock types in the Lower Volcanic Series include thin acid welded and crystal-rich tuffs, 
as well as bedded sandstones between andesite lava flows.  

The andesitic sequence is overlain by several massive porphyritic latites, with minor 
tuffaceous sediments. Their geometry is tabular and stratiform and they are interpreted to 
have formed as lava flows and/or sills. The main outcrop forms a wide strip between the 
Chupacabras and San Francisco faults. Petrography shows phenocrysts of potassium feldspar 
and biotite (Overbay et. al., 2001). The latites are about 250 metres thick and the base is 
apparently conformable. Latite crops out extensively around the heap leach pads and forms 
cliffs at Cerro Colorado (shown in Figure 7.3). It also occurs widely on the west side of the San 
Francisco Fault, up to the Chupacabras Fault. It forms most of the high west wall of the open 
pit.  

Fresh latite is purplish grey and comprises isolated feldspar phenocrysts, mostly less than 
2 mm to 3 mm long, within a very fine grained groundmass. The texture is locally 
glomeroporphyritic. Small biotite and long thin hornblende phenocrysts also occur. The rock 
is locally flow banded, but to a much lesser extent than in the latite dikes at Dolores. Fresh 
latite weathers like a plutonic rock, with onion-skin form, or is friable and crumbly.  

The latites are widely hydrothermally altered and weather to a red colour by extensive 
hematite alteration of disseminated pyrite. The source of the latite is unclear. There is no 
obvious 'root' to indicate a volcanic neck or eruptive center. However, they are texturally 
identical to the swarm of latite dikes at Dolores (see Figure 7.4). Overbay et. al. (2001) 
suggests they may have been erupted from a diorite-diatreme complex present in the pit. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         47 of 171

There are some extensive areas of latite breccia that are not distinguished on Figure 7.4. They 
comprise clast-supported, monomict latite blocks from 0.1 m to greater than 2 m diameter. 
Patches of siliceous sediment commonly occur in between clasts which may be either 
autobreccias or talus aprons spilling off flow fronts. They are also more deeply 
hydrothermally altered than massive latite, perhaps because of improved permeability.  

Transported latite breccia and lapilli tuff, with crude bedding and sorting, occurs in a few 
places, overlying flow banded latite. A short distance to the north, this same lapilli tuff 
overlies autobrecciated latite, the equivalent of the flow banded latite. 

A body of strongly flow foliated latite occurs in the pit in the footwall (east) of the San 
Francisco Fault. It is unusual because the flow banding is very intense and dips consistently 
gently southeast. The body overlies andesites with a shallow, conformable contact. This latite 
does not seem to correlate with the major latite flows to the west of the fault. This may be a 
sill within andesitic rocks of the Lower Volcanic Series or one of the domes mentioned by 
Overbay et. al. (2001). 

Upper Volcanic Series 
The Upper Volcanic Series comprises a bimodal sequence of rhyolite/obsidian, basalt, pumice-
rich lapilli tuffs and volcaniclastic rocks. It is well exposed on the two main access roads to the 
mine and is preserved west of the Chupacabras Fault, and is possibly a caldera margin. The 
tabular or lens-shaped rhyolites show widespread, flat-lying flow banding. Scattered perlitic 
obsidian layers in the rhyolite contain large spherulites with drusy zeolites, quartz, and minor 
amethyst.  

The amygdaloidal and oxidised basalts are probably thin lava flows, and have peperitic bases. 
The geological map given in Figure 7.4 shows all other lithologies as volcaniclastics (labelled 
"Volc"). These comprise crystal tuffs, green non-welded pumice-rich lapilli tuffs, crystal-rich 
sandstones, and conglomerates. They are mostly sub horizontal, though the dip varies where 
they onlap rhyolite bodies. Some of the tuffs are pyroclastic surge deposits, with shallow 
antidunes. 

The topographically, and stratigraphically, highest rocks comprise a thick porphyritic andesite 
flow (labelled "UAnd" in Figure 7.4), which is overlain by a basalt underlying the Dolores 
airstrip. 

The Baucarit Formation comprises polymict conglomerates, sandstones, and scattered 
basalts. To the east of the East Fault, the formation sits directly on latites of the Lower 
Volcanic Series and the Upper Volcanic Series appears to be absent, an indication of the 
importance of fault control on sedimentation and volcanism at Dolores. 

 Intrusions 7.3.2
The immediate footwall and hanging wall of the San Francisco Fault form a 500 m wide 
northwest-striking corridor of igneous intrusions broadly following the fault. However, there 
is a tendency for dikes to strike slightly clockwise and there are also some splits and north-
northeast jogs.  

There is a great variety of intrusive types. Field relations indicate that some are pre- and post-
mineralization. There are no isotopic dates, but the intrusions are probably of Eocene to 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         48 of 171

Oligocene age and are broadly contemporaneous with mineralization. The rocks with the 
most plutonic character occur in the south, where a steep-sided barren microdiorite stock, 
500 m in diameter, straddles the San Francisco Fault. Coinciding with high grade 
mineralization, it comprises weakly porphyritic diorite and marginal parts comprise 
porphyritic quartz diorite with potassium feldspar-rich aplitic groundmass. Age relations are 
not clear, but it appears to be cut by latite dikes. Exposures in the pit walls show very complex 
intrusive relationships, including diorite chilled against possibly intrusive andesite. Deep 
drilling shows a range of intrusive types in this area, including porphyritic granodiorite and an 
unusual amygdaloidal porphyritic andesite packed with xenoliths of diorite. Probable 
diatreme occurs in drill holes, but does not appear to crop out. Overbay et. al. (2001) suggests 
that some of the intrusions pass upwards into flow-domes. 

The dike swarm at Dolores is dominated by latite. This phase cuts the plutonic and sub 
volcanic rocks and is clearly younger. It comprises strongly flow banded rock, with isolated 
feldspar phenocrysts. Flow banding is parallel to the dike contacts, generally dipping steeply 
west. The latite dikes are visually indistinguishable from the latite lavas of the Lower Volcanic 
Series which is a major obstacle to geological interpretation. There were clearly several pulses 
of intrusion as evidenced by the presence of xenoliths of early latite varieties within later 
latites. The latite is in turn cut by late andesite dikes with a strong trachytic texture. 

 Structure 7.3.3
The sequence at Dolores is broadly flat-lying and suffered no significant compressional 
deformation after the Late Cretaceous. The major faults show large post-Pliocene (post-
Baucarit) normal offsets. However, complications in the stratigraphic sequence indicate an 
older history. Subtle changes in dip, internal angular unconformities, wedges, and missing 
strata all imply that the major faults controlled sedimentation and volcanism. 

The Chupacabras Fault throws down rocks to the west by about 200 m to 400 m while the 
East Fault drops the Baucarit Formation down to the east by about 350 m. The San Francisco 
Fault throws down latite lavas by about 300 m to 500 m to the west and is marked by a 
corridor of dikes and stocks. The overall geometry is therefore horst-like. The Upper Volcanic 
Series appears much thicker to the west of Chupacabras and it is possible that the fault is a 
trap-door type caldera. This may explain the chaotic nature of rock exposures to the south of 
the Dolores mine which may be related to caldera collapse.  

Although each major fault has an apparent normal offset, there is also evidence of strike-slip 
movement. The clockwise orientation of dikes relative to faults, along with north-northeast 
dike jogs, suggests a component of dextral strike-slip during intrusion and mineralization. 

All of the principal faults suffered major post-mineral (post-Pliocene) reactivation. The San 
Francisco Fault shows smectite-rich gouge with milled vein fragments, locally with amethyst. 
Fabrics within the foliated gouge confirm mostly normal offsets. 

 Alteration 7.3.4
The andesitic rocks of the Lower Volcanic Series show widespread, locally intense, propylitic 
alteration (chlorite + epidote + calcite + pyrite). Epidote is locally abundant (>15%), giving 
rocks a skarn-like appearance. The wide distribution of propylitic alteration suggests it is 
semi-regional, perhaps due to burial metamorphism. Propylitic alteration also affects the 
dioritic rocks of the stock-diatreme complex.

In contrast, the latite lavas of the Lower Volcanic Series show argillic (pyrite + clay) alteration. 
Pyrite commonly replaces original biotite phenocrysts. Clay, commonly kaolinite, replaces 
feldspars. Rarely exceeding a few percent, the kaolinite may be hypogene, but it is more likely 
that original hypogene clay, perhaps illite, was converted to kaolinite during weathering of 
pyrite. These altered latites form spectacular hematite-stained cliffs at Cerro Colorado. The 
alteration dies out abruptly in the west, probably along a steep front, between the 
Chupacabras and San Francisco faults. Fresh latite lava therefore occurs only a short distance 
west of the pit. At deeper levels, light green sericite haloes occur around veins and 
hydrothermal breccias. An area of probable advanced argillic alteration occurs beside the East 
Fault, where the latite is silicified and has pyrophyllite and/or alunite/dickite. 

 Mineralization 7.4
Silver and gold mineralization at Dolores is hosted in north-northwest trending hydrothermal 
breccias and sheeted vein zones on the order of 5 m to 10 m wide. Most high grade 
mineralization occurs along two or three major structures which provided the conduit for 
metal-bearing hydrothermal fluids. Silver and gold mineralization identified on the surface at 
Dolores lies over an area 4,000 metres long and up to 1,000 metres wide, at elevations 
ranging between 1,100 metres to 1,700 metres above sea level. The extent of mineralization 
at depth and along strike has not yet been fully defined. 

Most high grade mineralization occurs within the San Francisco Breccia, a well-defined and 
continuous hydrothermal breccia and stockwork zone that occurs in the immediate footwall 
of the post-mineral San Francisco Fault. The breccia trends farther away from the fault 
towards the north until it joins a second major breccia zone known as the Alma Maria Breccia. 
Other high grade zones split and re-join, forming diamond-shaped structures and steeply 
pitching mineralization shoots. These types of splits and branches, and steeply pitching 
intersections, are typical of fault systems with some strike-slip movement, in this case dextral. 
The San Francisco Fault marks a profound drop in grade and the hanging wall is mostly devoid 
of silver and gold mineralization. This barren hanging wall, mostly latite lava, forms the high 
west walls of the open pits. 

Hydrothermal breccias carry the highest silver and gold grades and vary from crackle to very 
milled types. Crackle types were more permeable and they commonly show coarse 
quartz + sulphide (pyrite, sphalerite, and galena) + fluorite gangue. They pass outward into 
vein stock works. Milled varieties of breccia contain fewer sulphides. The finer varieties 
resemble the fluidised mud/sand dikes typical of active geothermal fields. Hydrothermal 
breccias commonly include quartz vein or quartz-veined fragments. For example, exposed 
breccias at the north end of the San Francisco Breccia, where it more or less coincides with 
the San Francisco Fault, include amethyst vein fragments. Overall, the hydrothermal breccias 
mostly developed after the sheeted vein swarms, presumably by evolution from early 
fracturing to total failure and transportation of clasts. However, there are rare examples of 
breccias cut by veins.  

Diatremes, the roots of maar volcanoes, are reported at Dolores (Overbay et. al., 2001). 
Unusual breccias in a drill hole located on the north side of the microdiorite stock in the pit 
resemble diatreme. They are polymict, with common sub-rounded clasts, and show local

crude bedding and fine grained sediment partings. Large parts of the breccia are silicified and 
carry economic values of silver and gold mineralization.  

Most veins at Dolores are relatively simple, with only weak crustiform texture. They comprise 
euhedral comb quartz, commonly zoned from milky to transparent, depending on fluid 
inclusion content. Veins commonly show aggregates of very fine grained drusy quartz. They 
are thin, rarely over 30 mm, and tend to occur as sheeted swarms. Economically mineable 
grades occur where the veins are sufficiently closely spaced.  

Many of the veins and hydrothermal crackle breccias are open and drusy. Vein fill progresses 
from high temperature (>200oC) minerals, such as epidote, to low temperature (150oC to 
200oC) minerals such as colloform chalcedony, adularia, amethyst, laumontite, and other 
zeolites. Examples of well crystallized adularia are quite rare, but Overbay et. al. (2001) 
describes widespread adularia as an alteration mineral in the wall rocks. Geopetal structures 
occur in some veins and indicate high levels in the epithermal system, with only hydrostatic 
pressure in the conduits. The proximity of high and low temperature minerals suggests rapid 
cooling of fluids, perhaps due to uplift or a rapidly waning hydrothermal system. The 
presence of zeolites indicates very alkaline fluids. 

Local acanthite and visible gold occur in a variety of settings, including hydrothermal crackle 
breccias and in thin quartz-dominated veins. Base metal sulphides appear to increase at 
depth, with widespread coarsely crystalline sphalerite, galena and minor chalcopyrite. The 
sphalerite is always zoned, from yellow in the core, to black (marmatite) rims. Base metal 
sulphides are particularly abundant in the deeper parts of the stock-diatreme complex in the 
pit.  

A sub-vertically pitching mineralization shoot occurs where the San Francisco and Alma Maria 
Breccias meet, parallel to the intersection. Clearly this was a site of increased permeability for 
hydrothermal fluids. High grades also occur in the diorite stock-diatreme complex in the pit. 
The diorite formed an ideal brittle host for fracture, meaning more extensive brecciation and 
stock working. It may also have been the main upflow centre for hydrothermal fluids.  

Not all silver and gold mineralization occurs in vein swarms and hydrothermal breccias. Some 
diffuse areas of sugary, silicified rock with coarse adularia and high silver and gold grades also 
occur.

8 Deposit types 
Information in this section is referenced from Pratt (2013).  

Dolores is a low sulphidation epithermal deposit with strong structural control (Overbay et. 
al., 2001). Northeast-striking faults, perpendicular to the structural grain, locate many mineral 
deposits in the Sierra Madre Occidental. However, regional controls at Dolores are unclear 
where mineralized faults are north-northwest striking. There is no apparent transverse 
structure apparent on geological maps or satellite imagery. The mineralized structures have a 
typical Sierra Madre, or Laramide, trend, a direction probably inherited from the basement of 
elongate terranes. 

Local structural controls are better understood. Sometime after eruption of the Upper 
Volcanic Series, which finished about 27 million years ago, there was a northeast-southwest 
extensional regime, with a component of dextral strike-slip, creating dilation on northwest-
striking faults. It also caused local dilational jogs that allowed emplacement of dikes, 
hydrothermal breccias, and sheeted veins. It is highly likely that the diorite stock-diatreme 
complex was the main heat engine that drove the hydrothermal system and provided the 
source of metals. It may have also been emplaced into a space created by a dilational jog. 

Many aspects of mineralization at Dolores resemble Pinos Altos, where mineralization is 
hosted by major normal faults either side of a west-northwest-striking horst, according to 
Agnico Eagle's website. Like Dolores, the horst comprises the Lower Volcanic Group, faulted 
against the surrounding Upper Volcanic Group. Sinter suggests that the original paleosurface 
is preserved in places. Likewise, geopetal structures and low temperature minerals suggest 
Dolores developed close to the original surface and has not been strongly eroded.  

Pinos Altos lies on the northeast margin of the Ocampo Caldera. No circular caldera is 
apparent in satellite imagery or topography at Dolores. However, it is possible that the 
Chupacabras Fault is a trap-door type caldera margin since a thick pile of rhyolites, basalts 
and pumice tuffs is preserved to the west.  

High silver and gold grades occur over a wide vertical interval at Dolores. This is unusual for 
most low sulphidation epithermal deposits, which tend to have narrow vertical intervals of 
high grade. Studies in geothermal fields (e.g. Simmons and Browne, 2000) suggest that this is 
due to elevation-controlled boiling or fluid-mixing. However, Pinos Altos is also similar, with a 
considerable vertical range (> 750 m). These large vertical ranges mean that both Dolores and 
Pinos Altos are amenable to open pit mining, followed by underground working. 

Lithology was important for localizing high grade. Although the principal control on fluids was 
through-going semi-regional faults (San Francisco and Alma Maria), some host rocks were 
ideal for fracturing. Others were ductile and less amenable to mineralization. For example, 
historic workings in the East Dike targeted a continuous 1 m to 2 m wide hydrothermal 
breccia, hosted by a latite dike. This breccia disappears where the structure passes into 
country rocks. This, and many other examples, highlights the importance of brittle host rocks. 
Latite dikes were ideal while the surrounding andesites were a poorer host.  

Vein textures, the occurrence of adularia, and the simple sulphide mineralogy confirm 
Dolores is a low sulphidation epithermal deposit. But it lacks the typical complex crustiform

banding found in most low sulphidation veins (e.g. Hishikari in Japan and Kupol in Russia). This 
implies relatively few mineralizing and boiling events in the conduits.  

Local advanced argillic alteration along the East Fault suggests the potential presence of high 
sulphidation-type mineralization. There are examples of high sulphidation gold deposits in the 
area, for example, Mulatos, located about 42 km south-southwest (Staude, 2001). 

Major post-mineral offsets of up to 500 m occurred on the principal faults at Dolores. This 
locally juxtaposed unaltered glassy rocks with argillic-altered rock. The San Francisco 
structure was effectively sealed by mineralization. Therefore, the focus of post-mineral 
movement jumped west by up to 100 m. This resulted in a major fault zone, dominated by 
milled and foliated smectitic rock. A significant concealed epithermal system may occur in the 
deep part of the hanging wall.

9 Exploration 
Information in this section is referenced and updated from Pincock, Allen, & Holt (2002).  

 Exploration by Minefinders from 1993 to 2012 9.1
Minefinders acquired the Property in 1993 and began a reconnaissance surface exploration 
programme, assisted by aerial photographs taken in 1995, a 3 metre resolution digital 
topography map sourced from air photographs covering 20 square kilometres, and satellite 
imagery. Minefinders staff geologists carried out surface mapping and sampling, and 
employed contractors to complete the geophysical programmes.  

Four mapping campaigns defining the general structural and geological trends of the 
mineralized systems were completed, including an initial 1:5000 scale map covering 12 square 
kilometres, followed up by more detailed mapping at 1:2000 scale covering 3 square 
kilometres, and two structural mapping campaigns covering over 4 square kilometres at 
1:1000 and 1:500 scales.  

Over 13,000 rock samples were taken from surface outcrops, including 9,882 samples taken 
as 5 m long continuous samples along road cuts or sample lines cut perpendicular to the 
strike of the deposit. Channel samples were taken in the accessible portions of the 
underground workings. In workings parallel to the strike of the deposit, samples were 
selected from across the back at 5 m intervals at lengths averaging 2 m wide and up to 4 m 
wide. For other areas of the workings, 2 m long continuous samples were taken along the 
ribs.  

Geophysical surveys undertaken for Minefinders by Quantech Consulting Inc. of Reno, 
Nevada included 14,900 line metres of induced polarization/resistivity surveys and total field 
magnetic surveys, run across the strike of the deposit.  

The results of the surface exploration work as well as ore microscopy, metal ratio studies, and 
petrographic analyses were used to identify potential drill targets.  

None of the sample assay data collected from the surface and underground sampling 
campaigns has been used in the estimation of the current mineral resources and mineral 
reserves.  

 Exploration by Pan American from 2012 to present 9.2
Since Pan American acquired the Property, staff and consulting structural geologists have 
carried out near mine surface geological and structural mapping and near mine diamond 
drilling exploration campaigns are ongoing.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         54 of 171

10 Drilling 

 Drilling summary and database 10.1
Minefinders conducted drilling programmes on the Property almost annually using either 
diamond drill core or reverse circulation methods since 1996 (no drilling took place during 
1999, 2001, or 2008). A summary of the drillhole data available at the drillhole data cut-off 
date of October 22, 2013 for the commencement of the geological interpretation, which uses 
holes up to and including D13-0803, is given in Table 10.1. About 75% of the drillholes in this 
summary were completed by Minefinders, 15% were drilled by Echo Bay during their option 
period between 1996 and 1997, and the remaining 10% were drilled by Pan American. Since 
Pan American began operating the Property in April 2012, near mine exploration programmes 
have been conducted using only diamond drilling methods.  

Many of Minefinders drillholes were drilled down the dip of the mineralized trends, which 
provides little reliable grade and intersection width information. Pan American removed the 
majority of these drillholes, which comprise 17% of the current database, from the geological 
interpretation and the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves. A few down dip 
holes were retained for the interpretation where there are no nearby supporting drillholes 
oriented perpendicular to the mineralized trends.  

Most of the drilling is centred over the strike length of the currently defined mineral 
resources. A plan showing the location of the drillholes, coloured by drillhole type, is given in 
Figure 10.1. A cross section of the exploration drillholes used in the mineral resource estimate 
at 53000 m North is given in Figure 14.2, which shows the relative orientation and spacing of 
drillholes on a typical section.

 Drilling by Minefinders from 1996 to 2012 10.2
Minefinders drilled using a combination of reverse circulation and diamond drilling methods, 
with holes mostly oriented perpendicular to the strike of the deposit and spaced roughly 25 m 
apart. Some of the holes were oriented down the dip of the mineralized zones and the 
majority of these have been removed from the geological interpretation and the estimation 
of mineral resources and mineral reserves. The diameter of the diamond drillholes was either 
HQ or NQ. The diameter of the reverse circulation holes was not well documented but 
appears to be either 4 ½ or 5 ½ inches. The majority of collar surveys were taken with a total 
station or multi-station GPS survey instrument, while the remaining holes were surveyed 
relative to previously surveyed holes using a tape measure and Brunton compass. About 70% 
of the holes were surveyed down the hole by the drilling crews using a Tropari single shot 
camera tool for reverse circulation holes and an Ausmin or Sperry-Sun single shot camera for

diamond drillholes, at downhole intervals of around 50 m. The remainder of the holes were 
not surveyed.  

 Drilling by Pan American from 2012 to present 10.3
Pan American uses two Boart Longyear LF90 diamond drill rigs and one hybrid diamond drill 
rig, with a depth capacity of around 950 m, operated by Rock Drill Mining of Aguascalientes, 
Mexico. The hole diameter varies from PQ, HQ, and NQ. Drilling recovery is good, on the 
order of greater than 95%, and additives such as bentonite are used whenever necessary to 
improve core recovery and to regulate drilling pressure.  

The drillhole collars are set up in the field prior to drilling by the mine survey department 
using total station survey equipment and by laying out the front and back sights with stakes 
and flagging tape. Collar coordinate surveys are taken of the drillhole by the mine surveyors 
using total station methods, and downhole surveys are taken with a Reflex Multi-shot 
instrument on average every 25 m down the hole. The bearing and dip at the collar is 
determined by the mine survey department using total station survey equipment to survey a 
point at the collar and another point along the drill rod.  

 Material impact on the accuracy and reliability of drilling results 10.4
Pan American is aware of a number of potential issues with the drilling protocols for some of 
the drillholes in the Minefinders database, including the use of reverse circulation drilling 
(which may result in a less reliable sample than diamond drillholes, particularly when the 
sample is wet), orienting some of the drillholes down the dip of mineralization, absent or 
insufficiently spaced downhole surveys in some of the drillholes, and the lack of an effective 
Quality Assurance / Quality Control ("QAQC") programme to monitor error and accuracy of 
the drillhole sample data.  

However, Pan American believes these potential issues are unlikely to have a material impact 
on the accuracy and reliability of the drilling results and the mineral resource and mineral 
reserve estimates. There are a large number of drillholes present over the deposit, and 
wherever there is a potentially biased drillhole, another more reliable hole is located nearby 
that confirms the results. There is only a negligible difference in the silver and gold grades and 
thicknesses of the mineralized zones encountered by reverse circulation and diamond 
drillholes drilled in close proximity to each other. The removal of down dip drillholes from the 
geological interpretation and the grade estimation technique has mitigated the effect of 
poorly oriented drillholes, and there appears to be no significant difference in the location of 
the mineralized zones encountered by surveyed and by unsurveyed drillholes.  

Regular reconciliation reviews comparing close spaced grade control drillhole data against the 
mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates have reasonably confirmed the location, 
orientation, and grades of the mineralized zones as defined by the exploration drillholes. 
These factors relating to the reliability of the sample data has been considered when applying 
confidence categories to the current mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates. 

Pan American routinely conducts reconciliation of the reserve model to the grade control 
model and to the heap leach feed conveyor weight meter and sampler in order to monitor 
actual mine versus model performance. Between January and the end of May, 2014, sample

grade information obtained from closer spaced grade control drilling (10 m along strike and 
15 m across strike) has allowed the operation to identify and economically mine additional 
lower grade material in some areas that was either not identified by the exploration drillhole 
data used to estimate the mineral reserve, or else was not supported by sufficient data to 
estimate the tonnes and grade of the mineralization to mineral reserve levels of confidence. 
Additionally, in some areas the closer spaced grade control drilling has revealed less physical 
continuity of the economic zones as assumed by the interpretation of the wider spaced 
exploration data. These two factors have resulted in the operation mining year to date 
21% more ore tonnes at a 17% lower silver grade and a 26% lower gold grade, for a difference 
of nil in silver ounces and 10% fewer gold ounces relative to the tonnes, grade, and contained 
metal estimated in the reserve model.  

Since acquiring the Property, Pan American has undertaken measures to ensure the data used 
for the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves is reliable and collected using 
industry best practice. This includes orienting holes to obtain as perpendicular an intersection 
with mineralization as possible, taking downhole surveys at frequent intervals down every 
hole, and conducting an effective QAQC programme.  

 Conclusions and recommendations 10.5
There are no known drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the 
reliability of the drilling results. Pan American intends to continue annual near-mine diamond 
drilling programmes to test the southern and down dip extents of the currently defined 
mineralization and to conduct regular infill drilling of the deposit to upgrade mineral resource 
and mineral reserve confidence categories.

11 Sample preparation, analyses, and security 

 Sampling by Minefinders from 1996 to 2012 11.1
 On-site sample preparation and security 11.1.1

For reverse circulation drillholes, Minefinders selected one sample over the interval of each 
drill rod length, which was 5 feet (1.52 m), as the hole was being drilled. For holes drilled 
under dry conditions, the broken rock fragments were collected in a bucket placed below the 
cyclone discharge nozzle, divided into two equal sample pairs with a splitter, and then 
bagged. Sample weights varied from 10 kg to 12 kg. Wet drillholes were sampled from a wet 
splitter placed directly below the cyclone discharge, which directed half the material to one 
bucket and the second half of the material to a second bucket. Flocculant was added to the 
buckets and then the buckets were placed in tubs to rest and settle the fine material. The 
weight of the wet samples varied from 10 kg to 13 kg.  

One sample pair was sent to the laboratory for analysis and the other was retained on site for 
reference. A portion of the reference sample was stored in plastic chip trays, logged for 
geological features, and retained on site for future reference. The geological logging included 
codes for lithology, colour, and breccia type. Strength ratings were assigned for brecciation, 
fractures, veins (quartz, calcite, and epidote), alteration (silica, argillite, and propylite), 
oxidation (pervasive or fracture controlled), sulphides (pyrite, galena, and sphalerite), and 
oxide minerals (goethite, hematite, jarosite, and manganese oxides).  

Diamond drillholes were logged, photographed, split in half, and sampled in a secure core 
logging facility at the Property. The geological log included all the data collected for reverse 
circulation holes as well as core recovery, rock quality designation ("RQD"), and structural 
features. Core was split in half with a manual core splitter, with one half sent to the 
laboratory for preparation and analysis and the other half retained in the core tray for 
reference. The sampling length was frequently 2 m.  

Samples were collected by truck from the Property site by whichever commercial sample 
preparation laboratory was currently in use, which included Bondar-Clegg (since acquired by 
ALS) of Chihuahua, Mexico, ALS of Hermosillo, Mexico, or Inspectorate of Hermosillo, Mexico.  

 Laboratory sample preparation and analytical methods 11.1.2
Samples were dried and crushed to 70% passing minus 2 mm in either jaw or roll crushers, 
then reduced to 1 kg weight by splitting in a riffle splitter, then pulverized to 85% passing less 
than 75 microns (200 mesh). The pulverized material was then split to a 150 gram pulp 
sample weight.  

Between 1996 and 2002, the pulverized samples were sent for geochemical analyses by air to 
ALS of Vancouver, Canada and from 2002 onwards, the period covering the majority of the 
drillholes in the database, to Inspectorate of Reno, USA.  

ALS of Vancouver is an accredited laboratory that conforms to the requirements of CAN-P-
1579, CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025:2005) and Inspectorate conforms to the requirements of ISO-
9001:2008.

At the analytical laboratory, a 30 gram subset was assayed for gold using fire assay with 
atomic absorption finish. Any sample with a grade greater than 1 ppm gold was re-assayed 
using fire assay with gravimetric finish.  

Prior to 2001, samples were assayed for silver using Aqua Regia digestion with atomic 
absorption finish, until metallurgical test work at McClelland Laboratories Inc. ("MLI") found 
that the Aqua Regia digestion technique may have been under-reporting silver values, likely 
because of poor digestion of silver halide minerals. Minefinders implemented a campaign to 
re-assay approximately 9,000 retained pulps from drillhole and underground channel samples 
for silver using multi-acid digestion with atomic absorption finish, which resulted in a grade 
increase of 59% for oxidized samples, 22% in mixed oxide-sulphide samples, and 19% in 
sulphide samples. The database prioritizes assays by analytical method first by fire assay with 
gravimetric finish, then fire assay with atomic absorption finish, then multi-acid digest with 
atomic absorption finish, and finally Aqua Regia digest with atomic absorption finish.  

 Quality assurance and quality control 11.1.3
As part of their QAQC programme, Minefinders submitted standard reference material and 
blank material to the laboratory to independently test for accuracy and contamination of the 
assays determined by the laboratory. No duplicates were submitted to test for grade 
precision and variability. Standards were submitted with each annual drilling campaign at a 
frequency that varied from between 1 standard per every two drillholes up to 16 standards 
per drillhole, for an overall frequency of approximately 1 standard per 20 samples. 

From 1997 Minefinders submitted three standards comprised of mineralized material from 
the Dolores Property, which were prepared and certified for gold by Bondar-Clegg from round 
robin assays from a number of external laboratories. In 2002 Minefinders purchased four new 
standards comprised of mineralized material from site which were prepared and certified for 
both silver and gold by Inspectorate Laboratories.  

Blanks, comprised of material believed to be unmineralized and sourced from overburden or 
the upper parts of drillholes, were submitted in 1997 and from between 2004 and 2009, at a 
frequency of approximately 1 blank per 80 samples.  

The results of the QAQC data are problematic to assess, as record keeping and standard 
identification numbering on the log sheets was poor, no coherent QAQC database was 
maintained, and no regular QAQC reports are available for review. Pan American's review of 
the results of the silver and gold standards from both sets of standards shows unacceptably 
wide grade variation, which is likely the result of poor standard preparation. Blanks failed on 
the order of 3.8% for gold and 3.2% for silver, but since the blank material was not prepared 
from material assayed and certified to be completely free of mineralization, there is no way 
to assess whether the blank failed because of contamination during the sample preparation 
and analysis process or from trace mineralization present in the blank material.  

 Sampling by Pan American from 2012 to present 11.2
 On-site sample preparation and security 11.2.1

bladed saw, and samples are selected with respect to geological features, at 2 m lengths or 
less. The samples are collected weekly from site by SGS of Durango, Mexico and driven to 
their laboratory for sample preparation and analysis.  

SGS Durango conforms to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025 standard for the analytical 
methods employed for the Dolores samples.  

 Laboratory sample preparation and analytical methods 11.2.2
The samples are crushed to 2 mm in size and split with a riffle splitter to obtain a 250 g sub-
sample, which is then pulverized to 75 microns.  

Samples are analysed for gold using fire assay with atomic absorption finish, and any sample 
with a grade greater than 10 ppm Au is re-assayed using fire assay with gravimetric finish. 
Silver is assayed using three acid digest with atomic absorption finishing methods, and any 
sample with a grade greater than 300 ppm Ag is re-assayed by fire assay with gravimetric 
finish.  

 Quality assurance and quality control 11.2.3
Since acquiring the Property, Pan American has implemented an industry standard QAQC 
programme including the submission of certified standards, blanks, and duplicate samples to 
the laboratory and reviews the results regularly to ensure that appropriate and timely action 
is taken in the event of a QAQC failure. The protocol for the submission of QAQC samples is 
5% each of blanks, certified standards, and duplicate samples. The actual submission rate 
achieved to date is 5.0% blanks, 4.9% standards, and 6.1% duplicates.  

As at the diamond drilling data cut-off date of October 22, 2013 used for the geological 
interpretation, just over 1,000 samples from four different certified gold/silver standards 
were submitted to the laboratory with the diamond drill core samples. Sampling errors are 
assumed to follow a normal distribution, which means that 70% of the results are expected to 
fall within one standard deviation of the certified value, 95% of the results are expected to fall 
within two standard deviations, and 99.7% of the results are expected to fall within three 
standard deviations. For gold, the standards performed slightly better than expected at one 
standard deviation, 5% worse than expected at two standard deviations, and 2.5% worse at 
three standard deviations. For silver, the standards performed 5% better than expected at 
one standard deviation, 2% better at two standard deviations, and slightly worse than 
expected at three standard deviations. Overall, the results are acceptable and indicate 
reasonable accuracy at the laboratory. The bias of the failures to the plus standard deviation 
is noted, but the biases are within acceptable ranges.

1,027 blanks were submitted to the laboratory with the diamond drill core samples, with 
1.4% failures for gold (samples that returned assay values greater than 0.05 ppm Au) and 
1.0% failures for silver (samples that returned assay values greater than 2.5 ppm Ag), 
indicating little concern for sample contamination at the laboratory.  

860 field duplicates comprising the second half of the drill core and 404 duplicate pulps were 
sent to the laboratory with the diamond drill core samples. Sample grade precision is 
problematic at Dolores given the mineralization style and the presence of highly variable 
sample grades over short distances. Long (1998) recommends monitoring and assessing the 
results of precision pairs using a ranked absolute relative deviation (ARD) plot, with his 
recommendations corresponding to ±10% agreement on 90% of pulp duplicate pairs and to 
±30% agreement on 90% of field duplicate pairs when using the ranked half absolute relative 
difference (ranked "HARD") between sample pairs. Following Long's criteria, the pulp 
duplicates have poor precision for gold at 20.4% for 90% of pairs and poor precision for silver 
at 53.6% for 90% of pairs. Field duplicates are poor for both gold and silver at 40.8% for gold 
and 50.3% for silver for 90% of pairs. In general, while laboratory issues may be a potential 
factor, the highly variable nature of mineralization is considered to be the main cause of the 
poor precision noted in the duplicate data.  

 Bulk density measurements 11.3
Minefinders measured bulk density using the water immersion method from 296 paraffin 
sealed drill core samples of mineralized latite and andesite selected from 58 different drill 
holes from the 1996, 1997, 2002, and 2003 drilling campaigns. In 2012, Pan American 
selected 441 samples from 317 different drillholes chosen from geologically and spatially 
representative locations along 25 m sections oriented along the strike of the mineral 
resources. The samples were measured for bulk density by ALS of Vancouver, Canada, using 
the water displacement method on wax coated samples. The results of the bulk density 
measurements are discussed in section 14.7.

 Conclusions and recommendations 11.4
No effective QAQC programme was in place at the Dolores Property prior to 2012 to assess 
the accuracy, precision, and contamination of drillhole sample grades. Despite this, the risk of 
any material error or bias in the sample grades is considered to be low, given that the 
samples were prepared and analysed at certified, international commercial laboratories and 
that there is no material difference between the grade of exploration samples and the 
current grade control samples. The opinion of the Qualified Person responsible for this 
section of the technical report is that the sample preparation, analytical, and security 
procedures followed for the samples used to estimate mineral resources and mineral reserves 
are sufficient and reliable for the purpose of the mineral resource and mineral reserve 
estimates, and for the preliminary economic assessment of the expansion Project.  

The Qualified Person recommends continuing the sampling and assaying protocols in place at 
the Property and to continue to follow the practice of submitting blanks, standards, and 
duplicate samples at regular intervals for all drillholes at the Property in order to monitor 
potential issues with sample contamination, grade accuracy, and precision.

12 Data verification 

 Data verification by the qualified persons 12.1
 Geology data reviews 12.1.1

Prior to and following the acquisition of the Property from Minefinders, Pan American 
undertook extensive geological data verification reviews. These reviews included compiling 
the available information and conducting reviews of downhole surveys in the database 
against the original photographic disks, visual reviews of the drill hole location in three 
dimensional mining software, reviews of the drillhole collar coordinates against the surveyed 
topography, and extensive reviews of the assays in the database. The assay reviews included 
checking around 2,600 assays in the database against the original assay certificate, with 
particular attention paid to relatively high silver and gold grades and any assay showing 
unusual gold to silver ratios. A relatively minor number of discrepancies were noted and 
corrected.  

In the opinion of the qualified person, the data used to estimate mineral resources and 
mineral reserves and that form the basis of the preliminary economic assessment of the 
proposed expansion Project are sufficiently reliable for those purposes. 

 Mine engineering data reviews 12.1.2
Pan American has undertaken reviews of the mine engineering data, including the mining 
fleet and mine operational and production data, grade control data including dilution and ore 
loss, geotechnical and hydrological studies and pit wall and underground stability data, waste 
disposal requirements, environmental and community factors, the heap leach operations and 
production data, the development of the life of mine plan including production and recovery 
rates, capital and operating costs estimates for the mine and processing facilities, 
transportation, logistics, and power and water consumption and future requirements, 
taxation and royalties, and the parameters and assumptions used in the economic model.  

In the opinion of the qualified person, the data and assumptions and parameters used to 
estimate mineral resources and mineral reserves and the preliminary economic assessment of 
the proposed expansion Project are sufficiently reliable for those purposes. 

 Metallurgy data reviews 12.1.3
Pan American has undertaken reviews of the metallurgical test work performed in the past, as 
well as reviews of the metallurgical test work currently ongoing under Pan American's 
direction. In the opinion of the qualified person, the data and assumptions used to estimate 
the metallurgical recovery model for the mineral resource and reserve estimates are 
sufficiently reliable for those purposes, and that the data and assumptions used for the 
purposes of the preliminary economic assessment are sufficiently reliable.  

 Data adequacy 12.2
It is the opinion of the qualified persons responsible for the preparation of this technical 
report that the data used to support the conclusions presented here are adequate for the

13 Mineral processing and metallurgical testing 
Information in this section is referenced and updated from M3 (2005), Chlumsky, et. al. 
(2011), McClelland (2014), and Lyntek (2014). 

 1996 to 2000 test work by Echo Bay and Minefinders 13.1
Between 1996 and 1998, Echo Bay engaged Hazen Research ("Hazen") of Golden, Colorado to 
undertake bottle roll tests and mineralogical studies and Colorado Mineral Research Institute 
("CMRI") of Golden, Colorado to perform column leach and bottle roll tests. Subsequently, 
Minefinders engaged MLI of Sparks, Nevada to perform wet tails screen analyses and to 
develop metallurgical balances based on the column head grades reported by CMRI. In 1998 
Minefinders engaged MLI to undertake additional bottle roll tests which showed increasing 
metal recoveries with finer grind sizes.  

The results of this test work as well as the successful implementation of pulp agglomeration 
at the Ruby Hill mine in Nevada encouraged Minefinders to consider pulp agglomeration as a 
potential processing option for the Dolores ores. In 1999 and 2000, Minefinders engaged MLI 
to conduct further tests on three crushed, non-agglomerated, medium grade control columns 
as well as columns of high grade material ground to 65 mesh and 150 mesh and agglomerated 
onto crushed medium grade material. The results of this work confirmed the amenability of 
the material to cyanidation.  

 2003 to 2004 feasibility study test work by Minefinders 13.2
 Test work to support selection of processing option 13.2.1

In support of a feasibility study completed in June 2005, Minefinders began a two year 
programme of metallurgical test work in early 2003 to obtain data for scoping level trade off 
studies of various processing options to determine the most economic flow sheet for the 
Dolores ores and to optimize the processing conditions of the selected process route. Test 
work by MLI and SGS Lakefield Research Limited ("Lakefield") of Lakefield, Ontario included 
bottle roll, column leach, gravity scalping, and flotation tests to determine the metallurgical 
response of the feed types to heap leach treatment, gravity concentration, pulp 
agglomeration, flotation, and cyanide leaching of the flotation tails and concentrate. 
Flocculant screening, gravity sedimentation, pulp rheology, and vacuum and pressure 
filtration studies on leached concentrate and tail samples were also completed. The results 
from the column and bottle roll tests were used to determine silver and gold metal 
recoveries, recovery rates, reagent requirements, and crush size for heap leach parameters.  

Additionally, Hazen performed crushing, grinding, and abrasion index determination and 
impact crushability tests for work index determination. Metso of Wisconsin, USA performed 
paddle abrasion tests for abrasion index determination for estimating crusher liner 
consumption and impact crushability tests for work index determination. Metso classified the 
abrasion index of the andesite material as acceptable and the latite material as abrasive. The 
weighted average abrasion index of the feed material was determined at 0.336. The crushing 
work indices were considered favourable at 5.4 kilowatt hours per tonne for andesite and 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         67 of 171

7.6 kilowatt hours per tonne for latite. An average of 6.3 kilowatt hours per tonne was 
assumed for the feasibility study. Pocock Industrial Inc. ("Pocock") of Salt Lake City, Utah, 
performed flocculant screening, gravity sedimentation, pulp rheology, and vacuum and 
pressure filtration studies on leached concentrate and tailings samples.  

This test work was conducted on 92 spatially and geologically representative drill core 
composites and 13 reverse circulation composites, categorized into feed types dependent 
upon grade, lithology, and the presence of iron and/or manganese oxides.  

 Study and process selection conclusions 13.2.2
Based on the results of the studies, the stand-alone heap leach processing option at a target 
particle size of P80 6.3 mm, a processing capacity of 18,000 tonnes per day, and a 90% 
availability of the crushing plant was selected as the preferable processing choice for the 
Dolores ores and was used as the basis for engineering, construction, and start-up of the 
operation.  

 Test work to support heap leach processing option 13.2.3
Minefinders initiated a further series of test work in 2003 and 2004 on 16 composite samples 
categorized by grade and oxidation state in order to collect information in support of the 
chosen heap leach processing option. The test work included size sensitivity column tests, 
column leach tests, head screen analyses, comminution testing, finer crushing tests, and 
bottle roll tests to determine silver and gold metal recovery, recovery rates, reagent 
requirements, and crush sizes for optimizing the heap leach parameters. Following the results 
of the initial bottle roll tests, further column leach tests and head screen analyses were made 
on finer crushed material, and additional comminution, milling/cyanidation, gravity, and 
flotation testing were carried out.  

Direct agitated leach cyanidation tests were performed on 16 composites to determine 
sensitivity to feed size and metallurgical variability. All of these tests showed that the feed is 
amenable to direct cyanidation leaching and that silver and gold recoveries are related to 
feed size, with higher and quicker metal recoveries correlated with finer feed sizes. Silver 
recovery was shown to be slower than gold recovery at all sizes. MLI found no strong 
correlation between gold recovery and gold head grade, but later analysis using all the data 
available at the time indicated that sulphide columns showed a general tendency of higher 
silver and gold recovery with increasing silver head grade. Gold recoveries were higher for the 
oxide and mixed feed composites than the sulphide composites, while silver recoveries were 
higher for the sulphide composites. MLI initially noted no strong correlation between 
manganese content and silver and gold recovery in bottle roll testing, but later reviews of 
bottle roll and column test work showed decreasing silver recovery in the presence of 
manganese oxide.  

Column leach (percolation) tests conducted by MLI on 15 composite samples confirmed the 
amenability of the feed to heap leach cyanidation treatment. Tests were carried out on 
medium grade and high grade composites, as well as on medium grade composites at 
different crush sizes to determine the sensitivity of the medium grade feed type to feed size. 
The column leach tests did not indicate any problems with solution percolation, fines 
migration, or solution channeling with any of the composites.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         68 of 171

The column leach tests confirmed the results found in the bottle roll tests: that gold recovery 
tended to decrease and silver recovery tended to increase with increasing sulphide sulphur 
content of the feed. Table 13.1 gives the average recoveries for silver and gold by feed type. A 
weighted average recovery of 51.3% for silver and 73.9% for gold was assumed in the 
2005 feasibility study. As expected, the overlying iron and manganese oxide ores were 
planned to be mined in the early stages of the mine life and the sulphide ores were expected 
to be mined later.  

Table 13.1 2005 feasibility study metallurgical recoveries by heap leaching 

Feed type Gold recovery % Silver recovery % 

Oxide 79 46 

Mixed oxide/sulphide 79 52 

Medium grade sulphide 56 55 

High grade sulphide 65 71 

Precious metal recovery rates of the leaching tests were slow, between 333 and 399 days, 
and both silver and gold extractions continued to increase during the one year leach test. 
Cyanide consumption was very high, in part because of the long column leach test cycle. 
Based on the results of this test work and reagent consumptions reported from existing 
commercial heap leach operations elsewhere treating similar feed types, an average cyanide 
consumption of 0.4 kg per tonne of feed was assumed for the feasibility study. Lime 
requirements for the column testing conducted by MLI ranged from 0.6 kg to 5.6 kg per tonne 
of feed. Oxide ores required almost twice as much lime as mixed and sulphide feed types and 
andesite lithologies required about twice as much lime as latite. A weighted average lime 
consumption for all feed types of 1.4 kg per tonne at 100% CaO availability (or 1.69 kg per 
tonne of feed at 83% active CaO) was assumed for the feasibility study.  

Assays were made of each sample using fire assay methods for silver and gold content. Multi-
element ICP scans, sulphur speciation analysis, and bulk density determinations were carried 
out on some of the samples. The sulphur speciation analysis showed an inconsistent 
correlation between sulphide sulphur content and the oxidation code assigned to the sample 
composite, which may be attributed to the variety of different inexperienced loggers 
assigning oxidation codes to the geological log.  

Load/permeability tests on select column residues indicated that the leached feed maintained 
relatively high permeability even under compressive loadings simulating heap stack heights of 
up to 100 metres. The physical feed characteristic data showed that moisture requirements 
were typical for finely crushed feed and tended to increase with decreasing feed size. Very 
little or no slumping of the feed charges were observed during leaching. The feed charges did 
not require agglomeration at any of the feed sizes.

 2008 to 2010 test work and pre-feasibility study of a proposed 13.3
sulphide grinding, flotation, and cyanidation plant by Minefinders 

 Reassessment of previous test work 13.3.1
In a press release dated April 8, 2010, Minefinders disclosed the results of a pre-feasibility 
study considering the technical and economic feasibility of a proposed grinding-flotation-
leaching plant with a capacity of 6,500 tonnes per day to treat mixed and sulphide feed. The 
sulphide plant was proposed to improve the metal recoveries of the mixed and sulphide feed 
material achieved using the existing heap leaching process. However, no changes were made 
to the process flow sheet following the disclosure of the pre-feasibility study results.  

The 2010 pre-feasibility study included a review of the existing metallurgical test work data, 
undertaking new tests in 2004 and 2009, and focussing on the evaluation of the impact of 
grinding followed by direct agitated cyanidation or by the addition of a flotation stage and 
cyanidation for mixed and sulphide feed types. This review indicated that compared to heap 
leaching, direct cyanidation significantly improves metal recoveries for both silver and gold. 
At P80 75 microns and 1.0 grams of sodium cyanide per litre concentration, there was an 
improvement of 9% and 19% for gold and silver recoveries respectively in the oxide material, 
11% and 13% in the mixed material, and 22% and 4% in the sulphide material.  

Minefinders developed estimates for the silver and gold recoveries to be expected from 
milling at 106 microns and cyanidation of flotation concentrate reground at 25 microns plus 
cyanidation of the flotation tails, as shown in Table 13.2. 

Table 13.2 Pre-feasibility study metallurgical recoveries by milling, flotation, and 
cyanidation of reground concentrates and flotation tails 

Feed type Gold recovery % Silver recovery % 

Oxide 87 61 

Mixed oxide/sulphide 92 87 

Medium grade sulphide 91 78 

High grade sulphide 92 90 

In summary, the sulphide feed responded satisfactorily to the flotation process. Cyanide 
consumption for all tests varied between 0.15 kg per tonne and 1.02 kg per tonne, and lime 
consumption varied between 1.6 kg per tonne and 24.5 kg per tonne. The highest 
consumption was observed in ores with high amounts of manganese oxides.  

Minefinders reported that mixed ores could be treated along with oxide ores by direct 
cyanidation or with the sulphide ores via flotation/cyanidation, however, direct cyanidation 
was not considered an attractive option for sulphide ores since silver and gold recoveries 
were significantly lower than for flotation/cyanidation of reground concentrates.  

 Test work to support a sulphide grinding and flotation plant 13.3.2
In 2004 two sulphide feed composites and one mixed feed composite were subjected to test 
work at Lakefield to investigate the recovery of silver and gold by flotation and cyanidation of 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         70 of 171

the flotation products. Mineralogical analysis of the composites was undertaken to determine 
the nature of silver and gold mineralization, which found that the samples were composed 
primarily of silicates and pyrite with minor amounts of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, 
pyrrhotite, and magnetite, and trace amounts of silver minerals, kustelite, native gold, 
bornite, chalcocite, and covellite. Gold and silver recoveries of between 90% and 93% for gold 
and between 80% and 95% for silver in a flotation concentrate were achieved using a simple 
flow sheet and reagent scheme. No optimization of the leach conditions was performed. 
Variability test work showed considerable variation in terms of grind, and flotation and 
cyanidation response. The lowest recoveries were found in the medium grade samples, but 
the overall relationship between head grade and overall recovery was weak. Regrinding the 
concentrate to a P80 of less than 20 microns increased the extraction of gold and particularly 
silver.  

Lakefield also conducted environmental characterization comprising both geochemical and 
geotechnical testing of three composite samples of cyanide destruction tails, in order to 
provide basic information on the cyanide destruction process and the physical characteristics 
of the tailings product. All three composites responded well to cyanide destruction treatment 
using the SO2-Air process. The target residual total cyanide concentration of less than 
1 milligram per litre was achieved using a retention time of 90 to 120 minutes. SO2 
consumption was in the normal range of 4 to 5 grams of SO2 per gram of cyanide.  

No metallurgical test work took place between 2005 and 2007. Construction of the mine 
began at the end of 2006, and the commissioning period took place between September 2008 
and January 2009. The construction of the processing facility followed the recommendations 
made in the 2005 feasibility study and comprised a crushing plant, conveying and stacking 
facilities, leach pads, solution ponds, and Merrill-Crowe and refining facilities. The first doré 
was produced in November 2008 and commercial production began in May 2009, initially 
treating the overlying oxide ore.  

In 2009, SGS Lakefield Research Limited of Santiago, Chile ("Lakefield Chile") undertook 
flotation and cyanidation test work considering four stages for each feed type to determine 
silver and gold recovery and cyanide and lime consumption in four different processes, 
including rougher flotation on different size distributions and cyanidation of the flotation 
tailings, kinetic tests of rougher flotation with varying reagents and dosages, testing of 
cyanidation concentrates and flotation tailings at varying cyanide concentrations and 
regrinding degrees, and direct cyanidation testing of the different feed types.  

The results of the flotation-cyanidation tests showed that there was no significant difference 
in the metallurgical recoveries obtained from flotation and cyanidation for particle sizes of P80 
of 100 microns and 150 microns, at the flotation reagent scheme and cyanidation conditions 
used, although increased silver recoveries were obtained at a P80 of 75 microns in the oxide 
sample.  

Kinetic testing of the rougher flotation with different reagents and dosages was performed, 
indicating that the standard formula of potassium amyl xanthate ("PAX"), A3418 promoter, 
and methyl isobutyl carbinol ("MIBC") with a flotation time of ten minutes would be the most 
effective for the flotation of the Dolores feed minerals.  

Rougher concentrates were tested at intensive leaching conditions. Gold recoveries from the 
rougher concentrate of the mixed feed types were over 91% at P80 50 microns or finer and 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         71 of 171

5 grams of sodium cyanide per litre or higher. Gold extraction for the sulphide rougher 
concentrates ranged from 84% at P80 47 microns using 20 grams of sodium cyanide per litre 
concentrate to 87% at P80 15 microns using 5 grams of sodium cyanide per litre, with 
appreciably slower kinetics. In both cases, no significant effect of cyanide concentration on 
gold extraction was observed for concentrations between 5 grams and 20 grams of sodium 
cyanide per litre. Silver extractions from mixed concentrates ranged between 87% and 91%. 
For high grade sulphide concentrates, silver extraction was lower and reached a maximum of 
80%.  

The test work by Lakefield Chile showed that the optimum particle size for rougher 
concentrate flotation is P80 106 microns, followed by regrind of rougher concentrates to 
P80 25 microns. A leaching residence time of 72 hours is required for concentrate leaching and 
56 hours for tailings leaching, with total cyanide and lime consumptions of 0.7 kilograms per 
tonne and 2.5 kilograms per tonne, respectively. The expected gold recoveries of a circuit 
with flotation at 106 microns, cyanidation of cleaner concentrates reground to 25 microns 
plus the cyanidation of the rougher tails are around 92% for mixed and sulphide ores and 
87% for oxide ores, and expected silver recoveries are 61% for oxide, 87% for mixed, 78% for 
medium grade sulphide, and 90% for high grade sulphide.  

Comminution testing, including Bond (ball mill and rod mill) work index testing and abrasion 
index testing was performed and added to the database of test work undertaken in 2004. The 
rod mill work index was variable depending on the material type, ranging from 16.1 to 
17.3 over the eight samples tested, and averaging 16.8 kilowatt hours per short ton. The ball 
mill work index averaged 17.0 and ranged from a medium of 14.8 to a high of 19.0 for the 
16 samples tested. The average and maximum abrasion indices were 0.335 and 0.762, 
respectively. Comminution testing for grinding design, including Specific Energy Consumption 
("CEE") determined in pilot plant tests and Minnovex SPI tests also confirmed that the feed is 
in the high hardness range. The average and minimum SPI indices were 115 and 98, 
respectively.  

Lakefield Chile also made mineralogical assessments of three head samples categorized as 
sulphide, mixed, and oxide, using quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron 
microscopy ("QEMSCAN") technology to determine mineralogical associations and the degree 
of mineral liberation. Four silver species, including argentite/acanthite, 
freibergite/argentotennantite, argentojarosite, and electrum were identified. The mineral 
associations varied depending upon the sample type. Silver was almost completely occluded 
in the sulphide and mixed minerals, while over 65% of the silver was released in the oxide 
sample. This indicated that a greater reduction of particle size will be required to increase 
liberation of silver minerals in the sulphide ores than is currently being achieved in the 
crushing and heap leach circuit. Gold in electrum was associated with sericite/muscovite in 
the sulphide sample, with pyrite, quartz, feldspars, and phyllosilicates in the mixed feed, and 
with quartz, feldspars, micas, and clays in the oxide sample.  

Preliminary IsaMill test work was performed by Lakefield Chile, which indicated that the 
specific consumption for a grinding particle size of P80 of 15 microns is 22.5 kilowatt hours per 
tonne.  

Thickening and consolidation testing was undertaken at different solids concentrations to 
assess the optimal pulp dilution and flocculant dosage. Washing efficiencies higher than 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         72 of 171

96% were obtained when using a washing ratio of 2.5 cubic metres per tonne and three 
thickening stages. A thickening of 8 tonnes per square metre per day and a fluctuating 
consumption per thickener of 10 g/t was used for equipment design. Vacuum filtration tests 
showed that washing efficiencies of higher than 99.5% could be achieved when using a 
2.5 cubic metre per tonne washing ratio in the closed circuit decantation circuit composed of 
three thickeners and a displacement ratio of 1 cubic metre per cubic metre in the filtration 
stage.  

 Additional test work on heap leaching 13.3.3
In 2008, MLI undertook column leach testing and bottle roll testing on seven drill core 
composites to determine the amenability of the ore to heap leach cyanidation treatment and 
feed size sensitivity. Column leach tests were conducted at 1,000 ppm of sodium cyanide 
concentration, with a leaching time of 376 days. Gold recoveries at 6.3 mm ranged from 
57.1% to 79.6% with an average of 71.6%, and silver recoveries ranged from 24.6% to 66.0%, 
with an average of 56.2%. At 4.4 mm, gold recoveries ranged from 62.5% to 77.7%, with an 
average of 71.0%, and silver recoveries ranged from 26.3% to 68.1%, with an average of 
57.5%. The results showed that the composites were amenable to heap leach cyanidation 
treatment at 6.3 mm and 4.4 mm feed sizes, and that metal recovery, recovery rates, and 
reagent requirements were not particularly sensitive to the crushed sizes tested and were 
similar to the previous test undertaken at 6.3 mm. Pan American has used the results of this 
test work at 6.3 mm to update the current heap leach pad recovery model.  

 Pre-feasibility study conclusions 13.3.4
The pre-feasibility study of the sulphide grinding, flotation, and cyanidation plant concluded 
that the project was technically and economically feasible, and recommendations were made 
to undertake a feasibility study and more detailed engineering work to provide a higher level 
of detail on the project. Minefinders initiated a preliminary economic assessment involving an 
update of the current life of mine plan with the new treatment plan including updated costs, 
as well as a review of design for major omissions or errors, but terminated the work in 
anticipation of a potential acquisition of the Property by Pan American, which was completed 
at the end of March 2012. 

Pan American's later review of pre-feasibility study test work found that the direct 
cyanidation test work was undertaken under non-optimized conditions, that the flotation 
concentrate did not contain sufficient value to be sold directly to a smelter, that no viable 
option was presented for tailings storage, and that the option of pulp agglomeration was not 
evaluated 

 2012 to 2014 heap leach test work by Pan American 13.4
During the process of acquiring the Dolores mine from Minefinders, Pan American reviewed 
the available metallurgical test work, monthly operational performance data collected from 
the heap leach pads, and the results of monthly column leach tests performed at the 
metallurgical laboratory on site. Following acquisition of the mine in April 2012, Pan American 
selected 521 drill core samples for metallurgical test work. These samples were selected from 
spatially and geologically representative core drillholes located every 50 m along strike and 
every 100 m in depth, with consideration of silver and gold grade (including the cut-off grade, 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         73 of 171

the average grade, and high grade), oxidation state (sulphide, mixed, iron oxide, and 
manganese oxide), and lithology.  

 Cyanide soluble silver and gold shake tests 13.4.1
The 521 samples as well as 15 composite samples prepared for previous metallurgical test 
work by Minefinders were subjected to cyanide solubility ("cyanide shake tests") tests and 
analysis of manganese, lead, zinc, total sulphur, and sulphide sulphur content at MLI. The 
testing conditions were optimized using the composite samples with the objective of 
maximizing silver and gold extraction with respect to leach time, cyanide concentration, and 
solids density. After finalizing the optimum testing conditions, shake tests were performed on 
the 521 variability samples to measure the solubility of gold and silver by cyanide, which 
averaged 72% and 66% respectively.  

The cyanide soluble recovery results were then reviewed spatially and with respect to the 
geological codes assigned to the sample interval by the geologists during logging, in order to 
assess for any correlation of recovery with spatial or geological features. While the recovery 
results were highly variable, no meaningful correlation was noted between recovery and 
spatial location, lithology, or oxidation and alteration strength codes. As noted in the previous 
test work undertaken by Minefinders, there was a moderate negative correlation of gold 
recovery with respect to sulphur and total sulphur content and a moderate positive 
correlation of silver recovery with respect to sulphur and total sulphur content. These results 
indicated that information collected in the geological logs is not a reliable indicator of cyanide 
soluble silver and gold recovery.  

 Metallurgical recovery model update 13.4.2
An updated metallurgical recovery model for the existing heap leach operation was prepared 
for the December 31, 2012 mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, and confirmed 
for the December 31, 2013 and May 31, 2014 mineral resource and mineral reserve 
estimates, and is shown in Table 13.3. The recovery model was developed using the results of 
the tests conducted by Minefinders that were performed under similar conditions to the 
current heap leach operation, at a particle size of 6.3 mm and cyanide concentrations of 1.0 
grams of sodium cyanide per litre. No distinction is made between the metal recoveries of 
mixed and sulphide ores as the metallurgical results are similar.  

The metallurgical recovery model was supplemented with a silver and gold leaching kinetic 
model developed from the kinetics of all of the column leach tests and based on the solid to 
liquid ratio (the ratio of feed placed on the heap leach relative to the solution added) and 
metal recoveries. Furthermore, based on the topography of Pad 3, the current treatment 
rate, and the quantity of solution applied to heap leaching (1,000 m3/hour), a solid to liquid 
time schedule was estimated for use in the kinetic model equation. The kinetic silver and gold 
recovery curves by feed type are presented in Figure 13.1 and the kinetic model of 
metallurgical recovery of heap leaching at a target particle size of P80 6.3 mm after placement 
on the heap leach pad is given in Table 13.4.

 2012 to 2014 preliminary economic assessment of a pulp 13.5
agglomeration treatment option by Pan American 

 Introduction 13.5.1
Following review of the previous metallurgical test work at the Property, Pan American 
concluded that a fuller economic analysis considering the existing heap leach pad versus a 
new mill plus heap leaching at various capacities should be conducted as well as a thorough 
study of whole ore milling – cyanidation at optimized conditions. Pan American further 
decided to undertake a meaningful evaluation of the ability to selectively mine the higher 
grade sulphide component of the deposit as well as prepare a geologically based 
interpretation of the tonnes and grade of the different feed types (oxide and mixed/sulphide) 
present in a rigorously developed economic mine plan.  

In mid-2012 Pan American began a preliminary economic assessment of three alternative 
process options including a pulp agglomeration followed by heap leaching option, a grinding 
and leaching in tanks option, and a review of a flotation/cyanidation option. The three 
options were compared to the existing 16,200 tonne per day heap leach only process. The 
comparisons involved a high level assessment of treatment rates, metal recovery, the 
required particle size reduction, the necessity and cost of any tailing disposal system, 
operating costs, and initial capital requirements. 

Pulp agglomeration was ultimately selected as the most attractive treatment option based on 
higher metallurgical recoveries and improved recovery kinetics relative to the existing heap 
leaching option, and lower capital and operating costs as well as avoiding the logistical issues 
of siting tailings storage facilities on the challenging topography at Dolores relative to the 
grinding and leaching in tanks and flotation/cyanidation options. 

Minefinders had previously identified pulp agglomeration as a potential process alternative 
and initial tests were carried out at MLI in 2000. These tests were conducted at a medium 
grade to high grade ratio of 75% to 25% using partially leached (24 hour pre-leaching) high 
grade pulp with grind sizes of P80 212 microns and 106 microns agglomerated with crushed 
9.5 mm medium grade ores. Overall column percolation leach test results showed the Dolores 
ores to be amenable to pulp agglomeration heap leaching treatment and that recovery from 
high grade pulp is relatively independent of grind size. Recoveries from P80 106 micron pulps 
were nearly always only slightly higher than P80 212 micron pulps. No percolation, fines 
migration, or solution channeling problems were encountered.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         77 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -

Pulp agglomeration is the process of grinding ore and filtering it to form a moist pulp (the 
"pulp"), combining the pulp with cement, and tumbling to form round balls on the order of 
½ inch to 2 inches in diameter. In this process the fine pulp and cement particles are tumbled 
together in a drum at a controlled moisture content and feed rate such that they start to stick 
to each other. During the agglomeration process balls of material start to form, and as the 
tumbling continues more and more material adheres to the balls (the "agglomerates"). The 
cement acts as a binder that holds the particles together and gives the agglomerates strength 
to prevent them from crumbling under the weight of the material stacked on top of them 
during heap leaching. This is important to prevent the fine material from being washed to the 
solution collection drains and in maintaining good permeability in the heap for percolation of 
cyanide solution down through the heap. The agglomerates remain very porous and the 
surface area of the particles increased by grinding the high grade fraction of the mineral 
deposit allows for better contact of the cyanide solution on the surface of the precious metal-
bearing minerals. This in turn results in increased metallurgical recoveries and improved 
metal recovery kinetics compared to the existing coarse crushing and heap leaching process. 
A photograph of the pulp agglomerates in a 1 gallon paint bucket is given in Figure 13.2. 

Figure 13.2 Agglomerates formed from Dolores feed crushed to 425 microns 

 

 Bottle roll tests 13.5.2
In 2012 Pan American conducted additional bottle roll tests at MLI on 16 composites to 
determine the amenability of the feed to milling/cyanidation and to optimize leaching 
conditions. The tests were conducted to determine silver and gold recovery, recovery rates, 
reagent requirements, and in the case of a few composites, sensitivity to feed size. The 
optimum conditions were determined to be 3.0 grams of sodium cyanide per litre and a grind 
size of P80 of 75 microns. All of the high grade and medium grade composites were amenable 
to milling and cyanidation treatment. Grind size optimization testing showed that the feed is 
sensitive to feed size with respect to silver recovery but less so for gold recovery and that 
reagent consumption is not significantly sensitive to grind size. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         78 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -  

Preliminary Economic Assessment of a Pulp Agglomeration Treatment and Underground Option - Technical Report 

 
At optimum conditions gold recoveries ranged from 72.3% to 95.3% with an average of 
87.8%, and silver recoveries ranged from 60.0% to 94.9% with an average of 80.4%. Cyanide 
consumption and lime requirements were low to moderate.  

At the optimum testing conditions, the results showed improvements on the order of 15% to 
20% higher silver recovery and similar gold recovery compared to the previous test work 
conducted under less optimal conditions.  

On comparison of the recoveries of the milling/cyanidation bottle roll tests and the estimated 
the capital and operational cost required for a whole ore crushing, milling, and leaching in 
tanks plant, the estimated recoveries and economics of a pulp agglomeration plant were 
considered more favourable than the whole ore milling/cyanidation plant option.  

 Column leaching tests 13.5.3
In 2013 Pan American initiated column leach testing at MLI on high grade oxide, mixed, and 
sulphide composites; medium grade oxide, mixed, and sulphide composites; and on a 
combination of master composites representing high grade and medium grade oxide, mixed, 
and sulphide material. The composites were sourced from 521 spatially representative 
diamond drill core samples selected to represent the deposit in terms of grade, feed type, 
and lithology, and were prepared in the proportion of the feed types expected during the life 
of mine.  

Column leach tests are currently in progress on each high grade and medium grade composite 
at a P80 6.3 mm feed size to determine baseline recoveries for the existing heap leach only 
process. Pulp agglomeration column leach tests are also being conducted on each high grade 
composite. For these tests, the high grade composite was ground to P80 425 microns, pre-
leached for one hour to simulate the cyanide solution contact time in the mills, thickeners, 
and during filtration, then agglomerated with cement (20 kg/t) prior to column leaching 
without the addition of any medium or low grade material. Baseline and pulp agglomeration 
tests are also being conducted on combined high grade and low grade master composites. For 
these tests, the high grade material was milled, agglomerated, and then the agglomerates 
were blended with the crushed (6.3 mm) medium grade material at a ratio of 77% crushed 
medium grade material to 23% high grade pulp agglomerated material. This test work is still 
in progress and final results are expected in late 2014.  

Preliminary metallurgical results show that through 238 to 240 days of leaching of pulp 
agglomeration columns, extraction from the high grade composite samples ranges from 
0.91 ppm Au to 1.96 ppm Au and from 39 ppm Ag to 93 ppm Ag. Relative to baseline column 
leach tests, extractions from the pulp agglomeration column leach tests are currently 1% to 
21% higher for gold and 35% to 50% higher for silver. Through 295 days, extraction from the 
pulp agglomeration column leach test on the master composite comprising blended high and 
medium grade material is 17% higher for both silver and gold. The ultimate recovery from all 
column tests may change following completion of the tests and with residual (tails) assays. 
The relative improvement in recovery by grinding and pulp agglomeration treatment may be 
significantly different than the relative improvement in extraction observed at this time. 

Gold extraction from the pulp agglomeration column leach test on a high grade mixed 
oxidation composite is essentially the same as the extraction from the baseline test. Interim 
tail assay samples were taken from the baseline test of this composite after 120 days of 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         79 of 171

leaching to determine if the gold head grade of that sample might be higher than expected. 
Assay results confirmed that the head grade of the column test sample is likely greater than 
expected (approximately 1.74 ppm Au), giving rise to an anomalously high baseline 
extraction. Based on these observations, it is believed that in terms of gold recovery, there 
may be a significant advantage to pulp agglomeration of the high grade mixed material. Final 
tail assays from both columns will be required to verify this conclusion. 

Reagent consumption was compared for baseline and the agglomerated samples. The results 
showed that cyanide consumption in the high grade samples is significantly lower (between 
2.3 and 3.0 kg/t) than for the baseline tests (between 4.4 to 5.0 kg/t). The high cement 
requirements for agglomerating ground high grade material results in an elevated pH, which 
likely limits cyanide consumption. Reagent consumption results for the master composite test 
were nearly the same (4.3 and 4.6 kg/t respectively) where the baseline and pulp 
agglomeration tests were conducted at a similar pH. The addition of the medium grade into 
the pulp agglomerated sample results in a normal pH for leaching (around 11).  

The master composite column with 77% medium grade at P80 6.3 mm and 23% high grade at 
P80 425 microns presented ponding on the top of the column, indicating permeability 
restriction, perhaps due to migration of fines. The column was prepared with 15 kg of cement 
per tonne of high grade feed instead of 20 kg of cement per tonne of high grade feed as has 
been defined as the design criteria for the Project based on the results of load/permeability 
tests received later in the testing programme. The column was also cured for three days 
instead of seven, as is currently defined as the design criteria. Additional testing is now in 
progress at the conditions defined for the pulp agglomeration Project. 

Load/permeability tests at Geo-Logic Associates of Grass Valley, California, and agglomerate 
strength and stability testing at MLI have been conducted on a number of sample 
combinations, with varied binder additions, and on non-agglomerated feed, to evaluate the 
permeability of the material under expected commercial heap stack height compressive 
loadings. In summary, those tests have shown that it is possible to achieve acceptable 
permeability of a blended feed, by agglomerating only the milled high grade material and 
blending it with the crushed (P80 6.3 mm) medium grade material. The permeability of the 
blends evaluated was sensitive to cement addition, feed size of the milled high grade 
material, and blend ratio. In the case of 425 micron high grade material, blended at a ratio of 
77 % medium grade material to 23 % high grade, adequate permeability was obtained with a 
cement addition of 20 kg per tonne of high grade material. The results of the 
load/permeability test are presented in Figure 13.3.

 Metallurgical recovery model 13.5.4
The recovery model for the pulp agglomeration process was calculated using head and tail 
screen analysis results of 24 column leach tests of medium and high grade material. The 
weight and silver and gold grade distributions were calculated on each size fraction based on 
the screen analysis results, then the values of the coarser fractions (+850 microns) were 
redistributed and included in the fractions expected for grinding to P80 425 microns (minus 
20 mesh, 35 mesh, 65 mesh, 150 mesh, and minus 150 mesh fractions). The pulp 
agglomeration metallurgical recovery model is shown in Table 13.5.

The kinetics of the pulp agglomeration leaching were estimated using the same methodology 
as for heap leaching. The kinetic model was based on the extraction rate of the column leach 
tests at 425 microns, developing an equation of solid to liquid ratio with the partial recoveries 
of the current column leach tests and extrapolated or adjusted to the ultimate recovery 
estimated based on the screen analysis results. The topography of Pad 3 was also considered

 Comminution tests and pilot plants  13.5.5
Three new series of comminution tests were conducted for pulp agglomeration and the 
results were used with the previous test work reported in Minefinders' 2005 feasibility study. 
The first of the new series of tests consisted of Bond rod and Bond ball mill grindability tests 
completed at Phillips Enterprises LLC in Golden, Colorado. A second series of tests was 
conducted using a 19" (0.482 m) diameter continuous pilot rod mill at Metso's pilot milling 
facility in York, Pennsylvania. A third series of tests was conducted by Pan American at the 
Dolores operation in a 4' by 8' rod mill. The pilot data from the mine was used to verify the 
data obtained in the pilot mill tests at Metso and to provide the design parameters for the 
comminution circuit for the pulp agglomeration study.  

The new series of Bond grindability tests were completed on three diamond drill core 
composites milled to 1,180 microns for rod mill test work and milled to 150 microns for ball 
mill test work. The results from this test work were similar to all previously determined Bond 
mill and rod work indices, however, these results were used for initial estimates only with the 
pilot milling tests considered to be more accurate and reliable for final design of the rod mill 
circuit. The average rod mill work index was 17.8 kilowatt hours per tonne and the average 
ball mill work index was 18.7 kilowatt hours per tonne, a measure that indicates that the ores 
are moderately hard.  

A series of pilot rod milling tests were conducted under various circuit configurations in 
Metso's 19" diameter by 35 ¾" long continuous pilot mill. The tests of interest were three wet 
open circuit tests run with a feed size of 7.5 mm. Two runs at a feed rate of around 125 and 
145 kg per hour produced a final product of P80 381 microns and P80 552 microns, respectively, 
and reported a net specific energy of 7.6 and 6.7 kW hours per tonne, respectively. The third 
run at twice the feed rate produced a final product of P80 1,360 microns and reported a net 
specific energy of 3.8 kW hours per tonne. The results of this test work are considered 
indicative of rod mill performance at the considered grinds, but because the size of the pilot 
plant limits the feed size and road diameter that can be used in the tests, the results are not 
necessarily indicative for final design.  

Pan American purchased a 4' by 8' rod mill (shown in Figure 13.4) to conduct large scale batch 
and continuous tests under varying conditions to confirm the laboratory data and to allow for 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         82 of 171

a more representative feed sample of the correct feed size. The mill can be operated in either 
open or closed circuit. The pilot rod milling plant also produced larger samples of the final 
product suitable for filtration and settling test work to provide data to confirm the design 
criteria. A series of open circuit test runs were conducted using a range of feed size 
distributions prepared by different crushing circuits with material considered to be typical of 
the Dolores feed expected for the pulp agglomeration plant. To facilitate the comparison of 
grinding circuit efficiency, operating work indices were calculated for each of the runs. The 
criteria for the selection of the rod mill considers the highest operating work index of 22.4 kW 
hour per tonne obtained from three test runs with feed and product sizes within the range of 
expectations.

 Solid liquid separation tests 13.5.6
In late 2012 Pan American undertook solid liquid separation tests on reverse circulation 
coarse reject sample composites at Pocock including sample characterization, particle size 
analysis, flocculant screening, gravity sedimentation, pulp rheology, vacuum filtration, and 
pressure filtration studies.  

The flocculant screening test work helped identify the optimum flocculant product, dosage, 
and concentration to be used in subsequent testing. Dynamic thickening tests were 
conducted to determine the maximum hydraulic sizing basis for thickener design based on 
the settling properties of the material, and/or based on achieving acceptable underflow 
density or overflow total suspended solids limitations. Thickener underflow was used for 
viscosity testing to determine the rheological properties of the thickened pulp by measuring

the apparent viscosity of the material at known shear rates relative to solids concentrations. 
Yield values were determined for the pulps based on the observed relationship between 
shear stress and shear rate.  

Vacuum filtration test work was performed on the thickened samples to establish a general 
set of data to design and size vacuum filtration equipment by examining the effect of cake 
thickness and drying time, wash rate, and wash efficiency on production rates and filter cake 
moisture content. This test work was performed on six composites at variable percentages of 
feed solids and the absence and presence of flocculant at variable dosages and 
concentrations. Based on the results of these studies, vacuum filtration was not selected for 
agglomeration of the high grade by itself as a dewatering technology due to both the 
thixotropic behaviour of the produced cakes and poor production rates necessary to achieve 
a moisture content below 15%.  

Following the vacuum filtration tests, pressure filtration tests were performed on the 
thickened samples to establish a general set of data to design and size pressure filtration 
equipment, by examining the effect of cake thickness, drying time, wash rate, and wash 
efficiency on production rates and filter cake moisture content. The pressure filtration test 
work indicated that a filter press with a horizontal recessed plate equipped with vertical 
plates and air blow and membrane squeeze will produce the optimal product at the assumed 
production rates.  

 Conclusions 13.5.7
For the existing heap leach only operation, column leach testing on a range of mineralization 
grades and lithologies from the Dolores deposit yielded gold recoveries ranging between 
51% and 91%, and silver recoveries between 23% and 74%, all at a particle size of P80 6.3 mm. 
The metallurgical recovery model created for the mineral reserve estimate estimates gold 
recoveries of 81.5% for oxides and 66.1% for mixed and sulphide ores, and silver recoveries of 
47.4% for oxides and 59.2% for mixed and sulphide ores. The kinetic model created for the 
mineral reserve estimate assumes a three year period to achieve ultimate gold recovery and 
five years to achieve ultimate silver recovery. The authors have reviewed these models and 
conclude that they are consistent with recovery tracking observations in the heap leach 
operation at the mine. 

For the expansion Project, it is the authors' opinion that sufficient test work has been 
conducted to confirm that the recovery of silver and gold increase at finer grind size at 
Dolores. The metallurgical recovery model created for the pulp agglomeration of high grade 
mineralization presented in this preliminary economic assessment estimates gold recoveries 
of 89.3% for oxides and 82.4% for mixed and sulphide material and silver recoveries of 66.1% 
for oxides and 76.7% for mixed and sulphide material, all at a particle size of P80 425 microns. 
The kinetic model created for pulp agglomeration assumes a one year period to achieve 
ultimate gold recovery for oxide material and two years to achieve ultimate gold recovery 
mixed and sulphide material. The ultimate silver recovery of all material types subject to pulp 
agglomeration is assumed to take two years. The authors conclude that these models are 
reasonable and respect the available data. 

The load / permeability tests that have been conducted and the experience gained from other 
operations using a similar process provide a reasonable degree of assurance that the 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         84 of 171

agglomerates will remain stable in the heap leach stack. The ponding issue on the master 
composite using 15 kg/t of cement and shortened curing time is an indication that the 
operation would need to be vigilant in ensuring a minimum of 20 kg/t of cement and 
adequate curing time during actual operations. 

The pilot plant testing results provide a good degree of confidence for rod and Vertimill sizing. 
Filtration and other testing have also been conducted. The authors consider that the 
metallurgical and recovery methods have been developed to the point to confirm the 
concepts. 

 Material issues and deleterious elements 13.6
There are no known material issues and the operation is not subject to any negative impact of 
deleterious elements. The mine operates a closed circuit processing system without tailings 
facilities and produces a doré product.  

 Recommendations 13.7
Recommendations for additional metallurgical test work include incorporation of the final 
results of the column tests currently in progress into a pre-feasibility study upon their 
completion.  

The authors recommend exploring opportunities to optimize the filtration equipment. 
Calculations based on test results with Dolores ores has demonstrated that there is an 
opportunity to use vacuum filters if medium grade is added to the agglomeration drums to 
form the agglomerates. Diverting the crushed medium grade material to the agglomeration 
drum circuit will add flexibility to the high grade filter cake moisture content; however the 
system will be exposed to the variability in the moisture content of the crushed medium 
grade. The usual range of crushed medium grade moisture content is acceptable to use with 
vacuum filter product. It is recommended to quantify the peaks of maximum moisture 
content in the crushed medium grade material in order to evaluate the optimization of the 
filtration equipment.  

Pan American is currently preparing samples for additional load permeability tests to assess 
the behaviour of the agglomerates under the current design conditions and height of the 
heap leach pads. Initial tests have confirmed the permeability with 20 kg of cement per tonne 
of high grade feed, and additional load permeability tests are recommended with variable 
feeds.

14 Mineral resource estimates 

 Disclosure 14.1
Pan American updates mineral resources on an annual basis following reviews of metal price 
trends, operational performance and costs experienced in the previous year, and forecasts of 
production and costs over the life of mine. No new material information has become 
available between May 31, 2014 and the signature date given on the certificates of the 
qualified persons.  

Pan American conducts infill and near-mine drilling through much of the year. The drillhole 
data cut-off date for the commencement of the geological interpretation was October 
22, 2013, which uses holes up to and including D13-0803. The mineral resource estimate as at 
May 31, 2014, using this same drillhole data, has been updated to reflect anticipated cost and 
metal recovery parameters assumed in the pulp agglomeration treatment option, and to 
reflect refinements to the underground inventory based on the advancing underground 
studies, both of which are disclosed in this technical report. The effective date of the mineral 
resources is May 31, 2014.  

Mineral resources were prepared by Pan American staff under the supervision of and 
reviewed by Michael Steinmann, P. Geo., Executive Vice President, Corporate Development 
and Geology of Pan American Silver, who is a qualified person as that term is defined by 
NI 43-101.  

There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the potential 
development of the mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do 
not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resources reported here are in addition to 
mineral reserves.  

 Available data, data preparation, data transformations, and data 14.2
validation 
A breakdown of the type of drillholes available for interpretation is given in Table 14.1. The 
available drillhole data includes collar coordinates, downhole survey information, silver and 
gold assays, multi-element assays for a subset of the drillholes, and codes for lithology, 
structural features, alteration, mineralization, and oxidation, all in Microsoft Excel format. 
This data was imported into Datamine format and desurveyed into three dimensional 
drillhole traces. The drillhole data was reviewed and corrected as necessary for errors such as 
overlapping intervals. The drillholes were reviewed for their orientation relative to the 
orientation of the deposit, as well as for the presence and frequency of downhole surveys, to 
assess the reliability of the location of the drillhole trace and the nature of the drillhole 
intersection with the mineralization.  

Some of Minefinders' drillholes were drilled down the dip of the mineralized trends, which 
provides little reliable grade and intersection width information. Pan American removed the 
majority of these drillholes, which comprise 17% of the current database, from the geological 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         86 of 171

interpretation and the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves. A few down dip 
holes were retained for the interpretation where there are no nearby supporting drillholes 
oriented perpendicular to the mineralized trends.

 Geological interpretation, modeling, and domaining 14.3
 Geological interpretation and modelling 14.3.1

The drillhole data was assessed for any correlation between silver and gold content relative to 
geological features such as lithology, alteration, oxidation, and structure. Low to moderate 
correlations exist between silver and gold content and brecciation as well as quartz veining 
and silicification. There are no meaningful correlations between metal content and any of the 
other logged features.  

Three dimensional interpretations were made of the mostly barren diorite stock and iron 
oxidation codes on the drillholes on 25 m sections. These interpretations were wireframed 
and used to code the drillhole data and later the block model for the respective features.  

 Definition of grade estimation domains 14.3.2
Mineralization at the Property is structurally controlled and occurs in numerous parallel 
trends oriented to the northwest and dipping steeply to the southwest. As there are no other 
meaningful indicators to differentiate between economic and uneconomic grade except for 
sample assays, and because silver and gold grades are generally gradational within the 
mineralized zones, three dimensional mineralized envelopes for open pit mineral resources 
and reserves were prepared on 25 m sections around spatially continuous trends of 
composite samples greater than 0.25 ppm gold equivalent, using a gold to silver ratio of 
1 gold to 55 silver grams per tonne, with a minimum horizontal width of 3 m. This resulted in 
the creation of 28 spatially distinct and continuous mineralized trends. These interpretations 
were wireframed and used to back-code the drillhole data and later the block model for 
28 mineralized grade estimation domains, as well as the surrounding unmineralized domain. 
An example graphic of Pan American's interpretation of the mineralization style as at 
May 31, 2013 is given in Figure 14.1, which shows a plan of the mineralized trends at the 
1525 m elevation. The widths of the narrower zones are on the order of 15 m wide, while the 
widths of the wider zones are on the order of 155 m wide.  

Some of these mineralized zones extend to depths that cannot be mined economically by 
open pit mining methods, and will likely be accessed from underground. Interpretations of 
12 spatially continuous down dip extensions of the mineralized trends were made in the same 
manner but using a higher cut-off of 1.25 ppm gold equivalent and the same minimum 
horizontal width of 3 m. The interpretations were then expanded by 1 m either side to create

a dilution "skin" to account for the volume and grade of uneconomic material that is likely to 
be mined underground.

 Sample statistics 14.4
 Compositing of sample assay intervals 14.4.1

Approximately 40% of the samples within the mineralized domains were taken at intervals 
less than 2 m, 58% of the samples were taken at 2 m intervals, and around 2% of the samples 
were taken at intervals greater than 2 m. All samples were composited to 2 m intervals to 
ensure equal weighting of sample grades during the grade estimate.  

 Summary statistics 14.4.2
Gold grades within the 28 open pit estimation domains range from a mean of 0.11 ppm Au 
and 6 ppm Ag to a mean of 1.05 ppm Au and 56 ppm Ag. The mean grade of all composites in 
all domains is 0.69 ppm Au and 31 ppm Ag. The main zones at San Francisco and Alma Maria 
are the two volumetrically largest estimation domains and comprise nearly 80% of the 
mineral resource, with mean grades of 0.71 ppm Au and 29 ppm Ag at San Francisco and 
0.91 ppm Au and 37 ppm Ag at Alma Maria.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         88 of 171

The coefficient of variation ("CV"), a statistic that defines the similarity of sample grades and 
which may be used to justify the selection of grade interpolation method, is relatively high at 
4.9 for gold and 3.5 for silver at San Francisco and 3.4 for gold and 5.2 for silver at Alma 
Maria. Because the mineralization at Dolores is characterized by highly variable silver and 
gold grades over short distances, multiple indicator kriging was selected as the grade 
interpolation method for those domains with sufficient numbers of sample composites to 
support the creation of multiple variograms at different grade bins.  

Gold grades within the 12 underground estimation domains range from a mean of 0.85 ppm 
Au and 32 ppm Ag to a mean of 4.40 ppm Au and 154 ppm Ag. The mean of all composites in 
all domains is 2.25 ppm Au and 79 ppm Ag.  

 Extreme grade value treatment 14.4.3
No top cuts were applied in the multiple indicator kriging estimation domains as the 
interpolation method better deals with high grade variability than ordinary kriging or inverse 
power of distance, and does not require the use of top cuts. A review of composite grades in 
each domain not intended for multiple indicator kriging was conducted to assess and apply 
any necessary top cuts of extreme silver and gold grade values. Where necessary, top cuts to 
reduce the influence of a small number of high grade values were applied to domains based 
on the log histogram and location of the extreme grade values.  

 Variogram analysis and variogram modelling 14.5
Multiple indicator kriging requires the calculation and modelling of variograms at a range of 
grade thresholds, usually at the 10th percentiles (deciles) and the upper grade percentiles. 
Experimental variograms were calculated on each grade estimation domain to assess whether 
sufficient drillhole intersections were present to produce reasonable multiple indicator 
variograms. In the open pit region, reasonable variograms were obtained for the San 
Francisco and Alma Maria mineralized trends, as well as five other larger domains. A single 
variogram for all samples in one of the mineralized trends (domain 24, which lies between the 
San Francisco and Alma Maria trends) and the waste domain was calculated for an ordinary 
kriged estimate in those two domains. In the 20 remaining open pit estimation domains and 
all 12 of the underground estimation domains, no reliable variogram could be found, so 
inverse power of distance estimates were planned for those domains.  

Variogram models were developed for the 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th, 95th, 97.5th, 
98.75th, 99.6th, and 99.9th percentiles for silver and gold for samples in each of the seven 
multiple indicator estimation domains, oriented along the strike and dip of each mineralized 
trend. An example variogram for silver and gold at the 80th percentile for samples within the 
San Francisco trend is given in Table 14.2.

 Estimation methods and parameters 14.6
 Block model set up 14.6.1

A block size of 12.5 m x 12.5 m x 7.5 m was chosen with respect to the average drillhole 
spacing over the mineral resource region and to the open pit mining selectivity. Sub-cells 
were employed to obtain a better volumetric fit within the wireframes wherever the 
wireframe configuration cannot accommodate a full size parent block. The model was coded 
using the interpretation wireframes for the diorite stock, grade estimation domains, and iron 
oxidation strength. Iron oxidation affects metallurgical recovery and the oxidation 
interpretations are used to code the model for metallurgical recovery. 

The resulting block model was then depleted for previous open pit mining as at May 31, 2014. 
According to a review of incomplete mining records (Overbay, et. al., 2001), approximately 
372,000 tonnes of ore grading 9.8 ppm Au and 563 ppm Ag were mined from underground 
stopes between 1922 and 1931, producing 117,000 ounces of gold and 6.7 million ounces of 
silver. Minefinders staff created long sections plotting the location of the old workings based 
on drillholes that had encountered underground openings. These interpretations were 
digitized and wireframed but the resulting tonnage in the interpretations was on the order of 
2.5 million, far in excess of the reported tonnage and the volumes encountered during open 
pit mining thus far. There are very few grades in the drillhole database that correspond to 
reported mined grades, so in order to meaningfully deplete the resource for historic 
production, the interpretations were reduced in size to match the reported mined tonnages, 
adjusted to centre on the highest grade portions of the deposit, and the bulk density of the 
blocks within the mined volumes was set to zero. 

 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         90 of 171

 Grade interpolation and parameters 14.6.2
The 12 indicator variograms parameters for silver and gold were applied to the multiple 
indicator kriging estimate of silver and gold for the seven multiple indicator kriged grade 
estimation domains, and the ordinary kriged variogram parameters for silver and gold were 
applied to domain 24 and the waste domain. The range and direction of continuity obtained 
from the 70th percentile Au indicator bin was used to define the search ellipse. A minimum of 
8 and a maximum of 16 samples were required to return an estimate to the parent block 
(which means that all sub-cells of a parent block receive the same grade estimate), with a 
restriction of two samples from any one drillhole. A second search at 1.5 times the first search 
(which matches the range of continuity of the 60th percentile) was applied if the first search 
did not find the minimum number of samples, and a final search at 2.5 times the first search 
(which matches the range of continuity of the 30th percentile) was used if the second search 
did not find sufficient samples. For the unmineralized domain and for the other 20 domains 
where reliable variograms could not be obtained, silver and gold estimates were prepared 
using inverse power of distance and the same search parameters as the mineralized multiple 
indicator estimation domains. A summary of the search parameters is given in Table 14.3.

 Bulk density 14.7
The 441 bulk density measurements taken by Pan American from spatially and geologically 
representative regions of the deposit were reviewed with the 296 bulk density measurements 
collected by Minefinders. The bulk density values range from 2.0 to 3.00 grams per cubic 
centimetre (g/cm3), and have a mean of 2.61 g/cm3. The variability of the bulk density values 
is relatively low, at 2.54 for the 25th percentile, 2.62 at the 50th percentile, and 2.69 at the 75th 
percentile. There is no meaningful correlation between bulk density and any geological or 
spatial features, except for base metal content. Considering the variability of the bulk density 
measurements and that there are insufficient base metal assays to reliably estimate base 
metal content and then derive bulk density based on estimated base metal content 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         91 of 171

throughout the model, bulk density was applied to the block model using a nearest neighbour 
estimate to honour the local bulk density variability.  

 Estimation validation 14.8
The estimates were validated by comparing the global declustered mean composite grades 
with the mean of the estimated grades, by domain, and by comparing the local composite 
grade trends with estimated grade trends, by domain, on slice or "swath" plots. These 
reviews show the estimated grades to reasonably reflect the variability of the composite 
grades. Only a few smaller domains with fewer input sample grades showed poorer 
comparisons, and this was reflected in the confidence classification. Histograms of the input 
sample grades, by domain, were also compared to the histogram of the estimated grades to 
assess whether the shape of the histogram was reasonably maintained.  

Pan American routinely conducts reconciliation of the reserve model to the grade control 
model and to the heap leach feed conveyor weight meter and sampler in order to monitor 
actual mine versus model performance. Between January and May 31, 2014, sample grade 
information obtained from closer spaced grade control drilling (10 m along strike and 15 m 
across strike) has allowed the operation to identify and economically mine additional lower 
grade material in some areas that was either not identified by the exploration drillhole data 
used to estimate the mineral reserve, or else was not supported by sufficient data to estimate 
the tonnes and grade of the mineralization to mineral reserve levels of confidence. 
Additionally, in some areas the closer spaced grade control drilling has revealed less physical 
continuity of the economic zones as assumed by the interpretation of the wider spaced 
exploration data. These two factors have resulted in the operation mining year to date 
21% more ore tonnes at a 17% lower silver grade and a 26% lower gold grade, for a difference 
of nil in silver ounces and 10% fewer gold ounces relative to the tonnes, grade, and contained 
metal estimated in the reserve model.  

In the authors' opinion, the diamond drilling and reverse circulation drilling information that 
has been collected is of sufficient spacing and quality for mineral resource and mineral 
reserve estimation. There are areas of the Dolores deposit that will benefit from additional 
infill drilling in order to improve the interpretation of the continuity of the economic zones. 

 Mineral resource confidence classification 14.9
The estimate was classified into spatially continuous measured, indicated, and inferred 
categories by preparing three dimensional interpretation wireframes around the drillhole 
patterns and coding the estimate for classification category with the wireframes. Measured 
resources were assigned at the central and upper zones of the deposit where drillhole spacing 
is on the order of 25 m or less, surrounded by indicated resources where drillholes are more 
widely spaced at the lower and outer regions of the deposit, on the order of 50 m or less, and 
then by inferred resources at depth and in other regions with the widest, but still regularly 
spaced drillholes.

 Dilution, value estimates, and resource pit optimization 14.10
The sub-celled open pit block model was then re-blocked to a 6.25 m x 6.25 m x 7.5 m re-
block size by a process that eliminates the sub-cells formed at the boundaries of the 
wireframe interpretation and incorporates the grade of any sub-cell across the boundary into 
the grade of the re-blocked cell. On the contact of the economically mineralized zones with 
the surrounding uneconomic material, this process dilutes the grades of any cells with a 
majority of the volume lying within the economic interpretation, by incorporating the grade 
of the neighbouring uneconomic material into the re-block cell. The quantity of dilution 
added in this process varies and is dependent upon the width and location of the mineralized 
zone relative to the block, but on average the process resulted in the application of around 
13% dilution.  

A value per tonne was applied to each block based on the grade, metallurgical recovery, and 
location of the block as well as metal prices and costs including refining, transportation, 
royalties, processing, mining, G&A, and leach pad sustaining capital. For mineral resources, 
the costs and metallurgical recoveries applied were relevant to the pulp agglomeration 
processing option. An optimized pit shell was created for constraining the mineral resources 
using metal prices of $35 per ounce of silver and $1,400 per ounce of gold. For open pit 
mineral reserves, a pit design was prepared using costs and metallurgical recoveries for the 
heap leach only processing option and metal prices of $22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per 
ounce of gold.  

An example cross section showing the regularized mineral resource estimate (shown without 
being trimmed by a resource and reserve pit), the May 31, 2014 mineral reserve pit outline, 
and the exploration drillholes used in the estimate is given in Figure 14.2.

 Dilution, value estimates, and definition of underground inventory 14.11
To account for dilution during underground mining, a 1 m "skin" of block cells was applied to 
either side of the 3 m minimum width underground mineralization interpretations. These 
block cells contained estimated silver and gold grades based on the sample composites 
located within the dilution skin. The value per tonne calculation for underground material 
uses the same metal recovery percentages and resource metal prices as open pit material but 
uses higher cost parameters appropriate to underground mining. More details on the 
metallurgical recovery, cost parameters, mining methods, and development of the 
underground inventory are given in the relevant sections elsewhere in this report.  

The economic underground inventory was visually examined and any small isolated pods that 
would not be economical to extract due to the cost of access were removed from the 
inventory. No crown pillar between the open pit mine and the underground mine is 
necessary, as long as underground mining is scheduled to occur at a distance of greater than 
30 m from the active bottom of the open pit, and the stopes are tightly back filled before the 
pit advances to its final depth. As a conservative measure, however, in two areas a 15 m pillar 
was maintained in areas where underground production would interact with large sections of 
the pit high wall or which would undercut the pit ramp access.

 Mineral resource tabulation 14.12
Mineral resources for Dolores as at May 31, 2014, are given in Table 14.4. This tabulation 
includes in situ potentially economic material classified as measured, indicated, and inferred 
constrained within an optimized pit shell created using metal prices of $35 per ounce of silver 
and $1,400 per ounce of gold, as well as any potentially economic material within the reserve 
pit classified as inferred, underground resources below the resource pit shell, and low grade 
previously mined stockpiled material. The in situ mineral resources have been depleted for 
mining as at May 31, 2014 and stockpiles have been inventoried as at May 31, 2014. The costs 
and metallurgical recoveries estimated for pulp agglomeration treatment and combined open 
pit/underground mining have been used to estimate mineral resources. There are no known 
mining, metallurgical, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, political, or other factors or risks that could materially affect the potential 
development of the mineral resources. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do 
not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral resources reported here are in addition to 
mineral reserves.

Notes: Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability. Totals may not 
add up due to rounding. Mineral resource estimates were prepared under the supervision 
of or were reviewed by Michael Steinmann, P. Geo., Executive Vice President, Corporate 
Development and Geology of Pan American. Mineral resources have been estimated using 
a combination of pulp agglomeration and heap leaching metal recovery and cost 
parameters. Metal prices used for the mineral resource estimate were $35 per ounce of 
silver and $1,400 per ounce of gold. Mineral resources are in addition to mineral reserves.  

 Recommendations 14.13
No significant recommendations are made to improve the quality of the mineral resource 
estimate methodology. Pan American intends to continue with annual diamond drilling 
programmes and it is recommended to commence an additional infill drilling campaign to 
collect closer spaced drillhole information for updating the annual mineral reserve and 
resource estimates at Dolores. Exploration diamond drilling is expected to be concentrated on 
defining the southern strike extent of the deposit, and in improving the confidence in the 
estimate at depth. Mineral resources will be updated annually to include additional diamond

15 Mineral reserve estimates 

 Disclosure 15.1
Mineral reserve estimates were prepared by Pan American technical staff under the 
supervision of and reviewed by Martin Wafforn, P. Eng., Vice President, Technical Services of 
Pan American, who is a qualified person as that term is defined by NI 43-101.  

Pan American updates mineral reserves on an annual basis following reviews of metal price 
trends, operational performance and costs experienced in the previous year, and forecasts of 
production and costs over the life of the mine. The mineral reserve is based on measured and 
indicated mineral resources estimated as at December 31, 2013 using heap leach only metal 
recovery and cost parameters. The effective date of the mineral reserves is May 31, 2014, 
which accounts for material removed by mining between December 31, 2013 and 
May 31, 2014 as well as the inventory of economic broken material held in stockpiles at 
May 31, 2014. No other new material information has become available between 
May 31, 2014 and the signature date given on the certificates of the qualified persons. 
Mineral reserves reported in this section do not use the pulp agglomeration cost and metal 
recovery assumptions disclosed in this preliminary economic assessment, nor do they include 
any of the resources anticipated to be mined from underground, because the economic 
viability of those resources has not yet been determined by at least a pre-feasibility study.  

Mineral reserve estimates are based on assumptions that include mining, metallurgical, 
infrastructure, permitting, taxation, and economic parameters. Increasing costs and taxation 
and lower metal prices will have a negative impact on the quantity of estimated mineral 
reserves. There are no other known factors that may have a material impact on the estimate 
of mineral reserves at Dolores. 

 Planned dilution 15.2
As described in section 14.10, the sub-celled block model created for the mineral resource 
estimate was re-blocked to 6.25 m x 6.25 m x 7.5 m block size by a process that eliminates the 
sub-cells and incorporates the grade of the neighbouring block into the grade of the re-
blocked cell. On the contact of the economic mineralized zones with the surrounding 
uneconomic material, this process dilutes the economic grades by incorporating the grade of 
the neighbouring uneconomic material into the re-blocked cell. The quantity of dilution is 
dependent upon the width and location of the mineralized zone relative to the block, but on 
average the process resulted in the application of around 13% dilution.  

 Recovery and cost parameters 15.3
A value per tonne was applied to each block based on the estimated grade, projected 
metallurgical recovery, and location of the block as well as metal prices and costs including 
refining, transportation, royalties, processing, mining, G&A, and leach pad sustaining capital. 
For open pit mineral reserves, a pit design was prepared using metal prices of $22 per ounce 
of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         97 of 171

 Geotechnical parameters 15.4
Golder Associates Inc. of Tucson, Arizona, USA, updated their recommendations for the 
geotechnical parameters for the open pit design, following their review of the available data 
and the rock conditions in August, 2013 (Golder, 2013a). The results of their review are 
discussed in more detail in section 16.1.2. 

Surface weathering and/or intense argillic alteration occurs to a depth of around 30 m. 
Benches above 30 m should be constructed with production bench heights of 7.5 m with

6.2 m wide catch benches located on each bench (separated by 7.5 m vertically). The bench 
face angle should be 60° resulting in an inter-ramp angle of 35°. 

 Pit design 15.5
An optimized pit shell following the geotechnical parameters provided by Golder was 
prepared using Whittle software on resource blocks classified as measured and indicated 
using the value per tonne calculations. Roadways and other adjustments were made to the 
optimized pit shell using Minesight software to complete the pit design. The resulting pit is 
developed in a series of phased outward expansions, comprising triple benches of 7.5 m each 
and 9.1 m wide catch berms. A 24 m wide catch berm has been included in the design of the 
high west wall to mitigate the risk of failure. 

Below the weathering profile at a depth of 30 m, the inter ramp angle for internal phases has 
been designed at 47° as it is assumed that presplit blasting will not be used for internal 
phases. The final pit wall is designed with the assumption of presplit blasting to an inter ramp 
angle of 52°.  

The pit extends around 2,400 m in length trending to the northwest, and is about 750 m wide. 
The bottom elevation is at 1,285 m towards the north and at 1,155 m in the south. A plan 
view of the ultimate pit is given in Figure 15.1.

Notes: Totals may not add up due to rounding. Mineral reserve estimates were prepared 
under the supervision of or were reviewed by Martin Wafforn, P. Eng., Vice President, 
Technical Services of Pan American. Mineral reserves have been estimated using heap 
leach only metal recovery and cost parameters. Metal prices used for the estimate were 
$22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold.  

 Recommendations 15.7
The authors recommend advancing the pulp agglomeration processing studies to a pre-
feasibility study level. This work will provide more accurate estimates of the recovery and cost 
parameters relevant to the pulp agglomeration process and will allow the conversion of 
mineral resources to mineral reserves using the pulp agglomeration metal recovery and cost 
parameters.  

The authors further recommend advancing the underground studies to a pre-feasibility study 
level in order to convert the underground mineral resources to mineral reserves. This will 
require pre-feasibility study level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models so that the 
value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a higher level of 
confidence. Other studies will include advancing geotechnical test work and analyses, 
addressing the open pit and underground interactions and interfaces, and confirming the 
appropriating mining and back filling techniques. Work should also be done to understand the 
geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine.

16 Mining methods 

 Existing open pit operations 16.1
 Mining methods 16.1.1

Mining at Dolores has been ongoing since 2008 using conventional open pit methods with 
excavators, shovels, loaders, and haul trucks.  

Ore grade control is carried out using angled reverse circulation drilling to provide closer 
spaced sample data for a grade control estimate, which is used to mark out the ore/waste 
mining boundaries. The grade control holes are oriented perpendicular to the strike of the 
deposit on sections spaced every 15 m along strike and every 10 m to 15 m across strike. 
Drillholes are approximately 43 m long, which results in a vertical span of 30.2 m, which is 
equal to four bench heights. The holes pattern is offset with 25% of the holes drilled from 
each bench to provide full coverage. The reverse circulation drillholes are logged for lithology 
and oxidation and sampled every 2.03 m. The sample assays are used to estimate a grade 
control model with similar attributes as the mineral resource model, but with a 3 m x 5 m x 
7.5 m block size. A blast layout is designed based on polygons interpreted from the value per 
tonne calculation in the grade control model.  

Ore and waste material is drilled and blasted using 135 mm diameter, 8.5 m deep blast holes 
spaced 4.5 m along strike and 4.5 m across strike, charged with ammonium nitrate fuel oil 
("ANFO"). Ore and waste are usually blasted separately to minimize ore loss, dilution, and 
material misclassification. The minimum mining unit is 7 x 15 x 7.5 m, and planned dilution in 
the mineral reserve averages around 13%.  

In late 2012, the mine commenced a blast movement investigation conducted by Blast 
Movement Technologies of Australia in a further effort to reduce ore loss, dilution, and 
material misclassification. In early 2013 the mine implemented a blast movement monitoring 
system comprising directional transmitters placed into the hole prior to blasting and located 
with a detector after the blast, from which the distance and direction of blast throw is 
determined. The blast movement monitoring now takes place regularly.   

The mining sequence is to focus on the higher grade material in the south of the pit with 
waste material stored in the east waste rock facility, which is located to the south of the pit. 
When the last phase in the south is depleted, mining will switch to the north part of the pit 
with some of the waste stored inside the pit and some of the waste stored at the north waste 
rock facility. 

 Geotechnical and hydrological parameters 16.1.2
Golder Associates Inc. of Arizona, USA, made recommendations for the geotechnical 
parameters for the open pit design, following their review of the rock conditions at site in 
mid-2012 (Golder, 2013a). During that site visit, Golder supervised the drilling of three 
oriented diamond drillholes to extend the geotechnical database in the northern and 
southern halves of the southwest wall.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         102 of 171

Golder classified the rocks present in the mining area into two major lithology types including 
a latite group consisting of non-welded latite tuff, breccias, flows, dikes, and sills, and an 
andesite group consisting of andesite volcanics, porphyry intrusives, and diorite intrusives. 
The structural model consists of a dominant structural fabric striking 330° and dipping steeply 
to the west that pre-dates mineralization and cuts through both major lithology groups. 
Faults following this trend typically comprise normal faults dipping to the southwest. 
Conjugate normal faults and reverse faults dipping to the northeast are also present. A weak 
orthogonal system of normal and wrench faults striking east-west are also part of the major 
structural model. Minor structures including joints and veins typically follow the major 
structural trends, and a joint set dipping to the northeast at an angle less steep than the 
overall fabric is present within the pit.  

The geomechanical model includes the data collected from nine oriented diamond drillholes, 
30 unconfined compression tests, six disk tension tests, 11 triaxial compression tests, 
43 uniaxial compressive strength tests, and four direct shear tests of saw cut joints in the drill 
core. The tests on the Dolores drill core indicate good to very good rock quality and that the 
structural conditions are generally favourable for the development of steep inter-ramp slopes 
in all sectors of the pit except within the upper weathered zone and other surface areas 
affected by intense argillic weathering of the rock, which generally occurs to a depth of 
approximately 30 m below the surface.  

Hydrogeological studies indicate generally low permeability of the rock mass with very steep 
groundwater gradients towards the steep sided drainage valleys, likely following faults, 
fractures, and other geological boundaries. The groundwater elevation varies from 1,400 m to 
1,575 m above mean sea level. Initial work indicates that the orthogonal system of normal 
and wrench faults may be more permeable than the primary mineralized fabric, which 
facilitates natural drainage of the southwest pit wall.  

Golder recommended production bench heights of 7.5 m with 7.5 m wide catch benches 
located after each bench for mining areas within 30 m of the surface, and catch benches 
located each third bench or each 22.5 m vertically for mining areas below 30 m. For pre-split 
and trim mining, the recommended catch bench width is 9.1 m, with a bench face angle of 
70° and an inter-ramp angle of 52°. For buffered blasting, the recommended catch bench 
width is 9.5 m with a bench face angle of 67° and an inter-ramp angle of 50°. 

 Production and process rates and expected mine life 16.1.3
The life of mine plan is based on the mineral reserves presented in Section 15.6 and has been 
developed with all mining sourced from the existing open pit, feeding the existing crushing 
plant and heap leach system at a rate of 16,200 tonnes per day. In the life of mine plan the 
mining rate for the next seven years of production varies from 38.2 million tonnes to 
40.9 million tonnes of ore and waste. The waste mining rate declines thereafter, with mining 
completed in 2024. The heap leach system is fed at full capacity from the pit and stockpiles 
through to 2025, and stacking of crushed ore on the heap leach pads is completed in 2026. 
Production from residual leach-down of silver and gold from the heap leach pads is projected 
to continue through 2029. The projected mine life may increase if additional mineral 
resources are defined and can be converted to mineral reserves. 

The open pit has been designed with multiple phases to allow for earlier access to higher 
grade ore in the pit and to provide a smoothed mining schedule that minimizes peak open pit 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         103 of 171

mining fleet requirements. Where excess ore is available in the mine plan, the mine will 
stockpile lower grade material to be processed later in the mine life. Silver and gold grades 
are highly variable with annual head grades expected to vary between 24 ppm Ag and 51 ppm 
Ag and between 0.48 ppm Au and 1.68 ppm Au during the mining phase. When mining has 
been completed and the stockpile is being processed, grades are expected to decline to 
approximately 16 ppm Ag and 0.24 ppm Au.  

 Waste mining requirements 16.1.4
Stripping and other waste mining is expected to be at around 34 million tonnes annually 
between 2014 and 2020, reducing to 3.5 million in 2024. The final life of mine strip ratio is 
1 to 4.46. Waste rock is stored in three different waste rock storage facilities, located to the 
north, west, and east of the open pit.  

The mining sequence is planned to focus on the higher grade material in the south of the pit 
with waste material stored in the east waste rock facility, which is located to the south of the 
pit. When the last phase of mining in the south is completed, mining will switch to the north 
part of the pit with some of the waste stored inside the pit and some of the waste stored at 
the north waste rock facility. 

 Mining fleet and machinery 16.1.5
The mining fleet operated by Pan American includes six Komatsu HD785-5LC 91 tonne 
capacity haul trucks, nine Komatsu HD785-5 78 tonne capacity haul trucks, three Caterpillar 
777F 91 tonne capacity haul trucks, three Komatsu PC3000-6 shovels, one Komatsu 
PC1250SP-8 excavator, two Komatsu WA900-3A and one Komatsu WA600-6 wheel loaders, 
two Komatsu D375A-5 and one Komatsu D155AX-6 bulldozers, two Komatsu WD500-3 wheel 
dozers, two Komatsu GD825A-2 bladed road graders, and four Atlas Copco DM-45E and one 
Atlas Copco DM780D blast hole drill rigs.  

The mining fleet operated by the site mining contractor, PEAL, includes two Komatsu PC1250 
excavators, one Komatsu PC2000 shovel, ten Caterpillar 777F 91 tonne capacity haul trucks, 
two Atlas Copco blast hole drill rigs, one Caterpillar 16H bladed road grader, one Caterpillar 
D10T and one Caterpillar D8T bulldozers, one water truck, one diesel re-fuel truck, and a 
flatbed work truck.  

As mining progresses deeper and haulage distances increase, the life of mine plan 
contemplates the requirement for an increase in the number of mine haul trucks from the 
current 28 trucks (including PEAL) to a maximum of 33 trucks. This number is planned to be 
accomplished by replacing lower capacity (78 tonne) trucks with higher capacity (91 tonne) 
trucks and by purchasing additional trucks.  

 Workforce 16.1.6
The workforce currently budgeted for 2014 comprises 488 Pan American employees, 
including 257 in the mine (drilling, loading, hauling, and equipment operators, maintenance, 
administration, engineering and geology), 168 in the process area (crushing, leaching, 
maintenance, smelting, Merrill-Crowe, laboratory, administration, and metallurgy), and 63 in 
G&A (administration, human resources, safety, environmental, security, information 
technology, cost controllers, logistics, and warehouse). A further 282 contractors bring the 
total site workforce to 770.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         104 of 171

Most of the mining is undertaken by Dolores mine staff, and there is also a contract in place 
with a mining contractor, PEAL, to undertake an agreed upon amount of mining per year, 
most of which takes place in the waste areas. The mine operates year round on two twelve 
hour shifts per day, with the workers rotating on a two week on, one week off roster.  

 Recommendations 16.1.7
Pan American should continue to optimize blasting patterns, including continuing to measure 
blast movements, and to monitor pit slope stability, as per good mining practices.  

 Preliminary economic assessment of combined open pit and 16.2
underground operations with a pulp agglomeration treatment option 
The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

 Mining methods 16.2.1
There are no anticipated changes to the existing open pit mining methods or mining fleet 
associated with the expansion Project. Implementation of the expansion Project will require 
additional mining selectivity to separate the high grade portion of the deposit for grinding and 
processing through the pulp agglomeration circuit, which will require a manageable 
adjustment to current grade control practices.  

Snowden Mining Industry Consultants of Vancouver ("Snowden", 2014) and Pan American 
completed a preliminary economic assessment of the proposed underground mine, which is 
expected to occur concurrently with open pit mining and will be completed at approximately 
the same time. The mining method selected was open stoping, mostly oriented longitudinally, 
which takes into account the competent ground conditions and the requirement to tight fill 
stopes beneath the open pit. The advantages of this method include near complete extraction 
of the mineable inventory as no pillars are routinely necessary, and lower unit costs 
compared to development intensive methods such as cut and fill. Golder (2014b) advised that 
stope heights of 25 m, widths of 15 m, and lengths of up to 100 m will be stable. The width of 
economic mineralization is mostly less than 15 m, but there are localized areas with widths of 
between 15 m and 20 m, and in those cases the stope lengths are reduced. The average stope 
length used in the design is 75 m, to allow for level geometry and to accommodate a few 
stopes where the width is greater than 15 m.  

Where competent backfill is required, cemented rock fill will be used, and where the stopes 
are located in areas that will later interact with open pit mining, the cemented rock backfill 
will be placed tightly to the backs to ensure open pit stability. Uncemented rock fill will be 
used where competent fill is not required, and will be preferentially sourced from 
underground development. The ratio of backfill used for this study is estimated at 35% 
cemented to 65% uncemented.  

Using the mining inventory available below the current reserve pit design, the underground 
was designed using a decline access for haulage and transport of personnel and materials, 
utilizing a portal at the surface previously excavated by Minefinders, which is located

approximately 750 m east of the final pit crest at an elevation of 1335 m. The main access will 
first develop to a point where a ventilation raise can be developed, and then will approach 
the mineralization near the mid-point of the production zones along strike and split into 
subsidiary declines to access each of the production zones. Access declines are at a grade of 
1:7. A summary of the physicals developed from the mine plan are shown in Table 16.1. A 
plan view of the access development, underground inventory, and open pit design is given in 
Figure 16.1.

Figure 16.1 Plan of underground access development 

 

The total length of all access development for the material in the plan is estimated to be 
10,460 m. Decline development will be 5.5 m wide by 5.5 m high, except for a section from 
the portal leading to the point where development splits north and south, which would be 
5.5 m wide by 6.0 m high to allow room for auxiliary ventilation ducting.  

Production levels are spaced at vertical intervals of 25 m or less in each production zone. 
Levels will include footwall drives and crosscuts in waste to within 100 m of the level extents 
along strike, beyond which development along economic mineralization will provide the sole 
access. The design includes 24,080 m of level development, of which 12,340 m is in 
mineralization above the economic cut-off.  

It is estimated that the underground mine plan would require 280 cubic metres per second of 
airflow to safely ventilate the mine at a 1,500 tonnes per day production rate. It is envisaged

that the access decline will serve as the primary intake supplemented by a downcast fresh air 
raise to keep velocities in the decline within acceptable limits. The return infrastructure will 
consist of two upcast return air raises with surface fan installations. A dedicated fresh air 
drive and return air drive will connect the ventilation shafts to the mining horizon. 

The mining areas will be accessed by an access drive which will also serve as a fresh air drive 
supplying air to each of the spiral ramp systems. In addition a return air drive will be required 
which will access each of the mining zones and spiral ramp systems. Return from the levels 
will connect to this "collector" return air drive via a series of small raise bore holes or long 
hole raises of equivalent area that will follow the spiral ramp system. This will also provide a 
through ventilation position for the ramp development. The ventilation design includes 
3,810 m of lateral development, 930 m of 4.0 to 4.5 m diameter raises, and 1,620 m of 2.5 m 
diameter raises. Three portable refuge chambers have been included in the cost estimate. 

 Geotechnical parameters 16.2.2

Geotechnical characterization 

Golder (2013b) provided geotechnical input into the underground preliminary economic 
assessment, building on the recommendations they had previously provided for the open pit 
mine (Golder, 2013a). The scope of their underground work included characterizing the 
deposit, investigating open pit and underground interaction design aspects, and providing 
preliminary recommendations for the underground mine design and backfill requirements.  

The nine geotechnical drillholes completed for the open pit studies were insufficiently spaced 
to adequately characterize the rock conditions that will be encountered in the underground 
mine. To supplement this data, Golder reviewed RQD data and core photographs from 
exploration drillholes. As previously noted, the intact rock strength is considered generally 
very strong, at greater than 100 MPa (megapascals), on the basis of 43 uniaxial compressive 
strength tests.  

No major features or structures were identified near the proposed underground mine. As the 
design analysis for the pit slopes were undertaken assuming any failure would occur through 
the rock mass rather than along any major structural discontinuities, Golder considers it 
unlikely that structural features will adversely impact underground stability or that the 
proposed underground stopes will adversely influence overall pit wall stability. Assessments 
of the rock mass, including uniaxial compressive strength tests, RQD and discontinuity spacing 
measurements, the condition of the discontinuities, and ground water conditions, indicates 
that the rock quality is generally good to very good. The data do not suggest any variability in 
rock quality related to lithology, mineralization, or alteration.  

The review of the drillhole photographs indicates consistently good quality rock with the 
exception of a single anomalous drillhole which shows poor quality, highly fractured rock. The 
reasons for the condition of this hole are unknown. Other holes nearby, however, indicate 
good quality rock, and the ground conditions in the anomalous drillhole appear to be 
localized to that one hole.  

Based on the geotechnical information determined from core logging and strength testing, 
and from the observations of the drill core photographs, Golder concluded that the quality of 
all of the mineralized rock beneath and outside the pit limits that might be mined by 
underground methods, is good to very good.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         108 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -

The interpretation of structural features suggests that faults are very steep and are generally 
aligned normal to the southwest pit wall, particularly in areas where the mineralized rock 
intersects the pit. The overall stability of the pit is not controlled by major structural features, 
only the local bench faces, and this is particularly true of the areas where the mineralized rock 
intersects the pit. Analyses undertaken to evaluate overall stability of the pit (with no 
underground stopes) were based on failure of the rock mass and the factor of safety was 
determined to be very high, at greater than approximately 1.8. This represents very stable 
conditions, and as a result, the slope angles for the overall pit design were based on 
geometrical considerations and not on pit stability considerations.  

Geotechnical recommendations 

On the basis of the geotechnical characterization, underground stope dimensions of 
approximately 15 m wide by 100 m long by 25 m high are considered to be achievable. 

Mesh and pattern bolting is the recommended ground support for stope development. 2.4 m 
long bolts at a spacing of 1.5 m across the back and ribs to within 2 m of the sill were 
assumed for the study. Routine shotcrete is not considered necessary, but may be required in 
very localized areas where poor quality rock is encountered. Some limited cable bolting of the 
backs may be necessary. Parallel drilling and controlled blasting techniques will be necessary, 
especially immediately adjacent to the hangingwall contact, to ensure the walls are not 
undercut on the levels.  

The good quality rock, stable pit conditions, and the limited lengths of proposed underground 
stopes indicate that underground stopes that will be subsequently intersected by the pit, or 
are located immediately below the open pit, should not have a destabilizing impact on the pit 
walls provided that the stopes are backfilled tightly with cemented backfill immediately after 
they are excavated. 

Underground stope stability will require an adequate crown pillar between the open pit and 
the stopes at the time each stope is mined. Golder recommends that the stopes are mined 
and completely backfilled before the pit approaches within approximately 30 m of the stopes 
to avoid any adverse interaction developing between the open stope mining and the pit. 
Following tight filling of the stopes, open pit mining will advance through the crown pillar to 
achieve full extraction of the reserve.  

The necessary backfill material is expected to comprise both cemented and uncemented rock 
fill, at a ratio of 35% cemented rock fill to 65% uncemented rock fill. The backfill material is 
expected to be sourced from andesite and rhyolite waste rock broken mainly during 
underground mining, depending on the mine schedule, as well as crushed silver-depleted 
heap leach material. The waste rock is considered to be of good quality, with high uniaxial 
compressive strength values greater than 150 Mpa, and contains no clay or other 
contaminants. Neither the waste rock nor the spent heap leach material individually meets 
typical cemented rock fill aggregate size distribution requirements, so the two materials will 
be combined at a ratio of two parts waste rock screened to 100% passing minus 100 mm to 
one part spent heap leach material to yield about 30% passing 10 mm.  

The cemented rock fill is expected to contain between 3% and 4% cement, prepared in

for the plant and equipment is estimated at $4.8 million, with a further $2.4 million estimated 
for mobile equipment which includes underground haul trucks equipped with ejector plates.  
Overall backfill costs including cemented and uncemented rock fill are estimated at $5.09 per 
tonne of feed.  

 Production and process rates and expected mine life 16.2.3
The preliminary economic assessment is based on measured, indicated, and inferred 
resources mined by a combination of open pit mining from within a reserve pit and 
underground mining methods, both designed using metal prices of $22 per ounce of silver 
and $1,300 per ounce of gold, and treated using the current heap leaching facilities at the 
current processing rate of 16,200 tonnes per day until 2016, at which point the pulp 
agglomeration plant would commence operations. The annual feed mining rates between 
2014 and 2024 are estimated to range between 5.0 million and 9.9 million tonnes.  

For the preliminary economic assessment, the open pit mine has been optimized and 
redesigned with the combined pulp agglomeration and heap leach process costs and metal 
recoveries and using metal prices of $22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. The 
life of mine plan for the expanded case includes an additional 5.6 million tonnes of feed from 
the open pit that was formerly uneconomic with the heap leach only metal recoveries and 
operating costs, as well as an additional 5.0 million tonnes of feed from the underground 
mine. 

The preliminary economic assessment assumes that construction of the pulp agglomeration 
plant is completed by the beginning of 2016 and processing starts at a rate of 5,600 tonnes 
per day (2.0 million tonnes per annum). With the start-up of the pulp agglomeration plant, 
the throughput of the existing crushing plant and heap leach system is reduced to 
14,400 tonnes per day (5.3 million tonnes per annum), while overall processing and stacking 
on the heap leach pads increases from the current 16,200 tonnes per day (5.9 million tonnes 
per annum) to 20,000 tonnes per day (7.3 million tonnes per annum).  

An underground mining inventory, shown in Table 16.2, was developed using mining 
parameters appropriate to the mining method, derived mining costs, and estimated process 
and G&A costs and process recoveries.

A preliminary underground schedule based on the underground mine plan targets a feed rate 
of approximately 1,500 tonnes per day for 550,000 tonnes per year to feed the pulp 
agglomeration circuit in tandem with the coarser, lower grade feed from the open pit. Level 
development per heading is estimated to advance at a rate of 100 m per month, for a total of 
315 m per month of development. The planned schedule indicates development commencing

in 2015 and full production achieved in 2018, with a mine life of approximately 12 years 
including construction time. The projected mine life of the expanded operation may increase 
if additional mineral resources are defined and can be converted to mineral reserves. 

The preliminary economic analysis assumes that the open pit will continue until the end of 
2023 and that stockpiled open pit material will be processed in 2024 and 2025. The 
underground mine is anticipated to continue operations providing feed to the pulp 
agglomeration plant until into 2026. Production from residual leach-down of silver and gold 
from the heap leach pads is projected to continue through 2029.  

 Waste mining requirements 16.2.4
Open pit waste mining is anticipated to average 34.2 million tonnes per annum until 2020, at 
which point the waste mining will decline until completed in 2023. Waste mining in the life of 
mine plan totals 271 million tonnes from June, 2014, for a strip ratio of 1 to 4.12. The majority 
of the waste will be stored to the south of the pit, and there is an opportunity to store 
31.7 million tonnes of waste in the south part of the open pit after mining has been 
completed in that area.  

Underground waste mining is anticipated to occur at a rate of around 240,000 tonnes per 
year between the 2nd and 6th year of mining, reducing to around 110,000 tonnes per year 
thereafter.  

 Mining fleet and machinery 16.2.5
The mobile equipment fleet for the open pit mine will be essentially unchanged from that of 
the existing operation.  

The fleet of mobile equipment for the underground mine is shown in Table 16.3. Major 
equipment, including drills, trucks, and loaders, will be overhauled and replaced according to 
accrued service hours, while ancillary equipment and light vehicles will be replaced according 
to age. Two underground dump trucks and one scoop tram were purchased by Minefinders 
and are currently sitting unused in storage.

 Workforce 16.2.6
The open pit mine workforce will be essentially the same as for the existing operations. 

At its peak, the underground mine would employ 154 people in mine, maintenance, 
management, and technical services roles. The average annual workforce would comprise 
around 135 individuals, with around 85 in the mine, 28 in maintenance, and 22 in 
management and technical services.  

 Recommendations 16.2.7
The authors recommend advancing the preliminary economic assessment of the pulp 
agglomeration processing option to a pre-feasibility study level, which will allow Pan 
American to update the recovery and cost parameters and to re-optimize the pit design used 
in the estimation of mineral reserves. The open mining plan used in the preliminary economic 
assessment has a slightly higher production rate than is currently achieved at the mine and 
additional open pit production is expected to be supplied by PEAL and by purchasing 
additional mine haulage trucks. Implementation of the pulp agglomeration processing option 
will require additional mining selectivity to separate the high grade portion of the deposit for 
grinding, which will require a manageable adjustment to current grade control practices, but 
is not likely to result in significant additional mining costs. 

The authors further recommend advancing the underground studies to a pre-feasibility study 
level in order to convert the underground mineral resources to mineral reserves. This will 
require pre-feasibility study level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models so that the 
value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a high level of 
confidence. Other studies will include advancing geotechnical test work and analyses, 
addressing the open pit and underground interactions and interfaces, and assessing the 
appropriating mining and back filling techniques. Work should also be done to understand the 
geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine.

Given the high level of existing knowledge about the geology and ground conditions at the 
site, the amount of test work required for a pre-feasibility study for the underground mine is 
anticipated to be much less than at a greenfield project. Key items to be addressed for a 
future study include: 

• Additional studies of potential water inflow and water pumping requirements. 

• Improving the confidence of inferred resources which make up around two thirds of 
the underground inventory. The primary access decline for the underground could 
provide improved sites for diamond drilling to target structures beneath the pit. 

• Advancing the level of geotechnical knowledge, particularly where the underground 
and open pit operations will be in close proximity to each other. 

• Conducting a more detailed assessment of the cemented rock fill requirements and 
schedule.  

• Understanding the geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine. 

• Identifying the permitting requirements for the addition of an underground 
operation.  

• Developing pre-feasibility level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models so 
that the value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a higher 
level of confidence. 

The estimated cost of pre-feasibility level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models is 
$450,000. Given a positive outcome of these studies, Pan American may conclude that the 
most effective method of assessing the geotechnical and geothermal conditions and to 
improve the confidence of the inferred resource will be to develop part of the primary access 
decline for underground and some of the planned level accesses prior to making a final 
production decision on the underground mine. 

A total of $2.7 million has been considered in the preliminary economic assessment for 
diamond drilling to improve the confidence of the mineral resource estimates in the region of 
the proposed underground mine. As the pulp agglomeration plant and the underground are 
expansions to the existing Dolores mine, Pan American may consider that upgrading only a 
portion of the inferred mineral resource prior to making a decision on construction of the 
pulp agglomeration plant and the underground mine may be an acceptable risk.

17 Recovery methods 
Information in this section is referenced and updated from M3 (2005), GBM (2013), and 
Lyntek (2014). 

 Existing heap leach process  17.1
In early 2003, in support of a feasibility study completed in June 2005, Minefinders embarked 
on a two year programme of metallurgical test work to obtain data for scoping level trade off 
studies for various processing options to determine the most economic flow sheet for the 
Dolores ores and to optimize the processing conditions. Based on the results of the 
metallurgical test work, the ultimate flowsheet selected for the processing of the Dolores 
feed included primary crushing of run of mine feed to 112 mm, followed by secondary and 
tertiary crushing in closed circuit with screens to produce a final crushed product with a 
target P80 6.3 mm, conveying the crushed product to the heap leach pad, and stacking using a 
conveyor stacking system for leaching with sodium cyanide. The recovery of metals from the 
pregnant leach solution follows the Merrill-Crowe process with precipitation of metal ions 
using zinc dust followed by the removal of trace amounts of mercury in retort ovens and 
smelting of the precipitate to produce doré bars. The metals recovery circuit was designed for 
the capacity to produce approximately 200,000 ounces of gold and 7.5 million ounces of 
silver, for 8 million ounces of doré annually.  

Construction of the mine began at the end of 2006, with the commissioning period occurring 
between September 2008 and January 2009. The construction of the processing facility 
followed the recommendations made in the 2005 feasibility study and comprised a crushing 
plant, conveying and stacking facilities, leach pads, solution ponds, and Merrill-Crowe and 
refining facilities. The first doré was produced in November 2008 and commercial production 
began in May 2009, initially treating the shallow oxide ore.  

 Heap leach flow sheet 17.1.1
Broken ore is trucked from the open pit to a crushing plant where the target treatment rate is 
a nominal rate of 16,200 tonnes per day crushed to a target particle size of P80 6.3 mm in a 
three stage crushing circuit with a recirculating load. The crushed ore product is conveyed to 
the leach pads via an overland conveyor system, sampled at regular intervals from a material 
sampler, and placed on the pads using portable grasshoppers and a radial stacking system. 
Sodium cyanide solution is prepared in the same building that houses the Merrill-Crowe plant 
and pumped to the leach pads directly or to a holding tank near Pad 3, from where it is 
distributed to the heap leach pads and applied using a combination of drip and sprayer 
systems. More sprayers are used during the rainy season between July and October to 
increase evaporation in the circuit to account for the dilution of additional rain fall on the 
pads, while drip systems are used exclusively during drier times of the year. The mine 
operates a closed circuit processing system without tailings facilities. 

Metal recoveries are a function of solution flow rates, cyanide concentration, and time, and 
the metal leaching period can cover years, continuing as subsequent lifts are placed on the 
pads. The pregnant leach solution containing the dissolved silver and gold is collected from 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         114 of 171

the bottom of the leach piles via gravity collectors and/or vertical perforated steel pipes (well 
risers) fitted with internal pumps that transfer the solution to the pregnant solution pond. 
The solution is clarified, de-oxygenated, and processed through a Merrill-Crowe circuit with a 
nominal capacity of 1,000 cubic metres per hour to precipitate silver and gold from the 
cyanide solution. The clarified and de-oxygenated silver and gold cyanide solution is added to 
zinc dust, which triggers the precipitation of the silver and gold. The remaining barren cyanide 
solution is then recycled back to the heap leach pad for continued processing, while the 
precipitate in suspension is pumped to filter presses, where the resulting material containing 
zinc, gold, and silver is dried. The dried material is then mixed with fluxes and melted in a 
furnace to form doré bars.  

The bars are cleaned, assayed, weighed, and transported to a third party refinery in North 
America for final recovery. The doré bars typically contain between 1% and 5% gold and 95% 
to 99% silver, with generally less than 1% impurities. A chart showing predicted recovery 
compared to actual production since late 2010 is given in Figure 17.1. 

The heap leach pads, ponds, and cyanide circuit are contained within a closed circuit and not 
released to the environment.  

Medium grade material may be placed on stockpiles allowing for the preferential crushing 
and stacking of higher grade material. Currently approximately a dozen such stockpiles are 
located around the mine workings.

 Power and water requirements 17.1.2
Power is currently generated on site by six 1,800 kW Cummins and two 1,200 kW Caterpillar 
diesel generators. This reserve provides the start current requirements of the existing primary 
or tertiary crusher motors and also allows for planned and unplanned shutdown of two 
generating sets for maintenance, without disturbing the plant operations. The existing power 
station capacity is a total of 13.2 MW. In 2014, the power demand for the existing operations 
are forecast to be average 6.8 MW, reaching a maximum of 8.4 MW when re-starting the 
crusher motors, which are the largest motors on site. Power costs using diesel generators are 
anticipated to be on the order of $0.29 per kilowatt hour, depending on the cost of diesel.  

Water for the operations is sourced from wells, the historical underground workings, pit 
dewatering activities, the nearby Tutuaca River, and more recently from the Chabacan dam. 
The wells yield 9 litres of water per second while the nominal pumping capacity from the river 
is 47 litres per second from an available supply of 57 litres per second. Water availability from 
the river is substantially limited during the dry season, which runs from April to June. Water 
supply lines have been installed from the Tutuaca River to the Chabacan dam which is located 
to the west of the waste storage facility and then from the dam to the processing facilities. 
The Chabacan dam reservoir has a capacity of 1.2 million cubic metres and provides storm 
water control as well as the primary water storage. The permitted water usage from the 
Tutuaca River is 2.0 million cubic metres per annum at a maximum rate of 64 litres per 
second. The current consumption is well under this limit with annual water usage estimated 
at approximately 800,000 cubic metres.  

 Preliminary economic assessment of a pulp agglomeration treatment 17.2
option 

 Introduction 17.2.1
Laboratory testing has confirmed that reducing the particle size of the material being sent to 
the heap leach pads by grinding to a finer size will increase the overall recovery of precious 
metals and will reduce the leaching time required to achieve that recovery. The economic 
aspects of the additional costs of finer grinding and the associated treatment costs versus the 
benefits of the improved recovery and leaching time (leach kinetics) are the subject of this 
preliminary economic assessment. The concept is to exploit the apparent economic benefit of 
grinding higher grade materials to a finer grain size. Lower grade material would continue to 
be processed in the existing crushing circuit.  

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

This preliminary economic assessment of alternative processing treatments considers the 
existing 16,200 tonnes per day three stage crushing followed by heap leaching versus a 
20,000 tonne per day pulp agglomeration process consisting of 14,400 tonnes per day of low 
and medium grade material sent through the three stage crushing circuit and fed directly to 
the leach pads as well as 5,600 tonnes per day of high grade material ground to 425 microns 
and agglomerated before sending to the leach pads. The comparison involved a high level

assessment of treatment rates, particle sizes, and their respective metal recovery, the 
necessity and cost of any tailing disposal system, operating costs, and initial capital 
requirements.  

Bench scale laboratory testing and current pilot scale testing conducted on site have 
demonstrated a viable method for treating the high grade mineralization. The recommended 
treatment method consists of two stage crushing followed by coarse grinding in a rod mill to 
produce a P80 of 0.425 mm (-35 mesh) product. This material is then dewatered to 
approximately 15% moisture via pressure filtration, the dewatered material is then fed into 
an agglomeration drum where cement is added and mixed to produce a stable agglomerated 
product. This agglomerated material is then placed on the heap leach pad for metal recovery. 
This method provides the advantages of: 

• Improved liberation, leaching kinetics, and ultimate recovery of precious metals in the 
high grade ores 

• Reduced capital cost compared to fine milling and tank leaching and fine milling, 
flotation, and cyanidation of concentrate and tails 

• Reduced operating cost compared to fine milling and tank leaching and fine billing, 
flotation, and cyanidation of concentrate and tails 

• Maintained stability of heap leach pads 

• Optimized use of cyanide, lime, and cement reagents 

• No requirement of a tailings disposal system 

 Pulp agglomeration flow sheet 17.2.2
The pulp agglomeration process will operate in an integrated fashion with the existing heap 
leach processing facilities, as shown in the flow diagram in Figure 17.2. High grade run of 
mine feed will be stockpiled on the existing run of mine pad, separated from the medium 
grade run of mine material. The high grade feed will be tipped into a bin using front end 
loaders, at a rate of 5,600 tonnes per day, then recovered from the bin by a vibrating grizzly 
feeder, and delivered to a primary jaw crusher (Metso C-150 or equivalent). The discharge 
from the primary crusher will be conveyed to a vibrating screen. Screen oversize will pass 
through a cone crusher (Metso HP-800 or equivalent) in a closed loop to produce a rod mill 
feed (screen undersize) with a P80 of 12.8 mm. The screen undersize will report to a discharge 
bin outfitted with two reclaim belt feeders. One of the reclaim belt feeders will report directly 
to the rod mill (Nordberg 13' by 18'8") via a conveyor. The other reclaim belt feeder from the 
discharge will report to a conveyor and radial stacker for depositing onto a fine feed stockpile. 
The material will be recovered from this stockpile via multiple reclaim feeders and a reclaim 
tunnel conveyor system for eventual feed to the rod mill if necessary. 

The rod mill discharge will be pumped in closed circuit to a Vertimill/vibrating wet screen 
circuit. The screen oversize will report back to the Vertimill and the screen undersize will be 
pumped to a surge tank for feed to the pressure filters. This closed loop circuit is anticipated 
to produce a P80 of 0.425 mm (35 mesh) product.  

Cyanide and lime will be fed into the rod mill to start the metals recovery process. Process 
water for the rod mill will be pregnant solution from the heap leach. The entire area from the 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         117 of 171

rod mill forward will be on concrete pads for chemical and spill containment. A small 
thickener for mill clean-out and general spill and water recycle has been included in the initial 
design of the system. Thickener underflow will be intermittently pumped to the slurry surge 
tank. The thickener overflow will be processed in the Merrill-Crowe plant.  

The milled slurry will be pumped from the surge tank to one of three horizontal pressure 
filters equipped with vertical plates, air blowers, and a membrane squeeze. The filtration 
process is necessary primarily to reduce the water content of the material to a level suitable 
for agglomeration and will also provide an opportunity for early recovery of a portion of the 
precious metal content that will be leached in the rod mills. The pressure filters will dewater 
the slurry and produce a filter cake of approximately 15% moisture. Recovered filtrate 
solution will be pumped to a pregnant solution holding tank for eventual metal recovery in 
the Merrill-Crowe plant.  

The filtration circuit is expected to consist of three filter presses and associated support 
equipment, and all of the equipment will be housed within a building. Three filters will allow 
for continuous operations with one filter being filled while the other two are being emptied 
or going through a wash cycle.  

The dewatered filter cake will be discharged from the filter presses onto a belt conveyor with 
the possible addition of cement for feed to the rotating agglomerator drum. Additional 
solution will be sprayed onto the mixture within the drum as it tumbles within the drum in 
order to control the moisture content and formation of the agglomerate balls. The 
agglomerate balls will be discharged from the drum and conveyed to the heap leach pad feed 
conveyor where they will be combined with crushed low grade mineralized material to be 
conveyed to the existing heap leach pads.  

Most of the pulp agglomeration process make-up water for the high grade treatment circuit 
will be sourced by diverting a portion of the pregnant solution flow from the heap leach pads 
on its way to the Merrill-Crowe plant. The benefits of using pregnant solution in the pulp 
agglomeration plant include cost savings in sodium cyanide and solution pumping, optimizing 
the Merrill-Crowe and cementation process which improves with higher metals values in 
solution, and minimizing any increase in fresh water consumption. Additional cyanide solution 
will be sourced from a sodium cyanide solution make-up plant constructed next to the berm 
of heap leach Pad 3. The heap leach pads, ponds, and cyanide circuit will remain contained 
within a closed circuit and will not be released to the environment.  

No tailings disposal system is required as the pulp agglomeration process does not produce a 
tailings stream.

 Plant design 17.2.3
The proposed pulp agglomeration plant will require a two stage crushing plant with a capacity 
of 5,600 tonnes per day, a rod mill targeting a particle size of P80 passing 1,700 microns, a 
Vertimill targeting a particle size of P80 passing 425 microns, a thickener, pressure filters for 
dewatering of the ground rod mill product, and an agglomeration drum where the ground 
high grade feed will be agglomerated with the addition of cement. The cement requirements 
for agglomeration are expected to be approximately 20 kilograms per tonne of feed.  

A schematic of the proposed pulp agglomeration plant layout (Lyntek, 2014) is given in Figure 
17.3 and is anticipated to be located to the northwest of the existing crushing plant. This 
location was selected as the most suitable given its close location to the existing crushed 
medium grade stockpile, which eliminates the necessity of long overland transfer conveyors. 
Sharing the run of mine feed pad with the existing crushing facility eliminates the 
requirement for any additional haul roads.

 Equipment and specifications 17.2.4
Scoping level estimates of equipment requirements and specifications for the proposed pulp 
agglomeration processing option have been made in the preliminary economic assessment.  

Estimates for the crushing design criteria are given in Table 17.1. A trade off study of the 
crushing equipment concluded that unless the run of mine feed size can be reduced to less 
than the current 800 mm, it will not be possible to achieve the necessary size reduction 
through units smaller than those presented in Table 17.1.

Estimates for the milling plant design criteria are given in Table 17.2. An alternative option 
was also analysed that entailed the use of two rod mills to grind directly to 425 microns. This 
option could achieve the target particle size, but technical and operational advantages of the 
selected circuit outweighed the use of two rod mills in parallel.

The estimated design criteria for leaching, thickening, filtration and clarification, and 
agglomeration are given in Table 17.3. No leaching has been accounted for in the rod mill. A 
portion of the soluble silver and gold will be recovered from the thickener overflow and filter 
press filtrate streams, but the majority of the precious metals will be leached on the heap 
leach pads and will report to the Merrill-Crowe plant in the pregnant leach solution. The 
cyanide required for the high grade feed will be sourced by diverting a portion of the flow of 
the pregnant heap leach solution from the pads to the Merrill-Crowe plant, as well as from a 
cyanide solution make up plant to be built at the berm of heap leach Pad 3.

The estimated reagent requirements are given in Table 17.4. The addition of lime and cement 
to the pulp agglomeration plant is anticipated to result in a reduction in the amount of lime 
required for the medium grade heap leach feed, which has been accounted for in the

 Power and water requirements 17.2.5
Power is currently generated on site by six 1,800 kW Cummins and two 1,200 kW Caterpillar 
diesel generators. This reserve provides the start current requirements of the existing primary 
or tertiary crusher motors and also allows for planned and unplanned shutdown of two 
generating sets for maintenance, without disturbing the plant operations. The existing power 
station capacity is a total of 13.2 MW. In 2014, the power demand for the existing operations 
are forecast to be average 6.8 MW, reaching a maximum of 8.4 MW when re-starting the 
crusher motors, which are the largest motors on site. Power costs using diesel generators are 
anticipated to be on the order of $0.29 per kilowatt hour, depending on the cost of diesel.  

The lease of an additional 2,000 kW generating set is considered for six months to cover the 
power requirements of the pulp agglomeration plant with the assumption that grid power 
will be installed by April, 2016. If connection to a power grid is not available, then an 
additional 2,000 kW generator will be required to cover the power requirements. The 
estimated operating load is 3,500 kW for a 5,600 tonnes per day pulp agglomeration plant, 
with an estimated total connected load of 5,130 kW.  

Pan American has been working with an independent power line consultant to study the 
economic benefits of the installation of a high voltage power line to the Dolores operation to 
replace the existing diesel generators. An initial study completed by the CFE, showed that the 
project is strongly economic, with initial capital costs in the $15 to $20 million range. The 
initial economics based on the projected power requirements in 2014 and the current diesel 
fuel consumption and costs indicated annual savings of $7.5 million in diesel fuel costs alone. 
Savings in the maintenance and replacement costs of the existing generators further add to 
the benefits of the project. The additional power costs associated with the expanded 
operation, particularly for crushing and grinding, would essentially double the annual savings.  

Pan American is proceeding with the power line project, and negotiations with the land 
owners for right of way along the access route are currently underway. The connection to the

Chihuahua electrical grid is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2016. There is 
some uncertainty associated with these negotiations in determining the final cost and 
schedule. The current estimate for completion is between $15 million to $20 million with a 
two year period required for right of way negotiation, environmental assessment, permitting, 
and construction.  

The only additional water requirements for the pulp agglomeration plant include minor 
amounts of raw water for emergency eye wash, showers, and miscellaneous fresh water 
needs. Plant water will be delivered from the existing heap leach pad pregnant solution 
collection and pumping systems.  

 Recommendations 17.2.6
Additional engineering will be required to more reliably assess the technical feasibility and 
economic viability of the Project and to finalize the anticipated flow sheet. Some of the 
additional test work and studies necessary to advance the Project are discussed here. 

The secondary crushing equipment selected for this study has been sized in common with the 
existing crushing plant, which affords benefits in areas such as spares stockholding. If the run 
of mine feed size can be reduced by varying the blasting practices in the pit, then smaller and 
less expensive primary and secondary crushing equipment may be used. It is recommended 
to evaluate the benefits of varying the blasting practices in the pit in order to reduce the size 
and cost of the crushing equipment in the pulp agglomeration plant. 

An opportunity lies in diverting the rod mill product to pre-leach holding tanks for early 
recovery of silver and gold prior to the thickening and filtration process. This option may be 
more attractive at higher metal prices. Additional studies are required to compare the 
additional capital and operating costs versus the advantage of improved kinetics.  

The authors recommend exploring opportunities to optimize the filtration equipment. There 
is an opportunity to use vacuum filters if medium grade material is added to the 
agglomeration drums to help control the moisture content while forming agglomerates. 
Diverting the crushed medium grade material to the agglomeration drum circuit would add 
flexibility to the high grade filter cake moisture content; however the system would be 
exposed to the variability in the moisture content of the crushed medium grade that changes 
with the seasons at the mine. It is recommended to quantify the peaks of maximum moisture 
content in the crushed medium grade material in order to evaluate the optimization of 
filtration equipment. An estimated $500,000 would be required for the trade-offs and studies 
to advance the process area to a pre-feasibility study level. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         126 of 171

18 Project infrastructure 

 Existing operations 18.1
 Transportation and logistics 18.1.1

The main road access to the Property is via 92 kilometres of unpaved roads leading north 
from Federal Highway 16, near Yepachic, Chihuahua. Access for personnel is also provided by 
an unpaved landing strip suitable for light aircraft, located about 8 kilometres from the mine. 
The nearest major population centre is at the city of Chihuahua, located 250 kilometres to the 
east. Employees travel to the mine either by road or by light aircraft, while materials come by 
road. 

No additional road works are anticipated for the construction and operation of the proposed 
expansion Project.  

 Crushing, leach pad, and waste disposal facilities 18.1.2
The existing mine infrastructure comprises three waste storage facilities located to the north, 
west, and south of the open pit mine workings, three leach pads located to the east of the 
workings, pregnant solution and overflow ponds located to the north of the offices, run of 
mine stockpiles of material awaiting crushing, a three stage crushing plant, a Merrill-Crowe 
plant, a power generation plant located to the west of the ponds, and maintenance shops and 
warehouses located near the mine offices. As the mine plan prioritizes the highest grade 
material available for crushing, approximately a dozen medium grade stockpiles are located 
around the mine site, awaiting crushing.  

A series of fixed and portable conveyor belts transport the crushed material to the leach 
pads. Pad 1 operated for the first two years of the mine life and is now currently on care and 
maintenance. Stacking on Pad 2 is nearly complete except for the transfer of a minor amount 
of partially leached ore from Pad 1. All stacking of fresh ore now takes place on Pad 3, with 
active leaching continuing in series on Pad 2 and Pad 3. The mine operates a closed circuit 
processing system without tailings facilities. A plan of the current site facilities is shown in the 
photograph in Figure 18.1.

 Power 18.1.3
Power is currently generated on site by six 1,800 kW Cummins and two 1,200 kW Caterpillar 
diesel generators. This reserve provides the start current requirements of the existing primary 
or tertiary crusher motors and also allows for planned and unplanned shutdown of two 
generating sets for maintenance, without disturbing the plant operations. The existing power 
station capacity is a total of 13.2 MW. In 2014, the power demand for the existing operations 
are forecast to be average 6.8 MW, reaching a maximum of 8.4 MW when re-starting the

the benefits of the Project. The additional power costs associated with the expanded 
operation, particularly for crushing and grinding, would essentially double the annual savings.  

Pan American is proceeding with the power line project, and negotiations with the land 
owners for right of way along the access route are currently underway. The connection to the 
Chihuahua electrical grid is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2016. There is 
some uncertainty associated with these negotiations in determining the final cost and 
schedule. The current estimate for completion is between $15 million to $20 million with a 
two year period required for right of way negotiation, environmental assessment, permitting, 
and construction.  

 Water 18.1.4
Water for the operations is sourced from wells, the historical underground workings, pit 
dewatering activities, the nearby Tutuaca River, and more recently from the Chabacan dam. 
The wells yield 9 litres of water per second while the nominal pumping capacity from the river 
is 47 litres per second from an available supply of 57 litres per second. Water availability from 
the river is substantially limited during the dry season, which runs from April to June. Water 
supply lines have been installed from the Tutuaca River to the Chabacan dam which is located 
to the west of the waste storage facility and then from the dam to the processing facilities. 
The Chabacan dam reservoir has a capacity of 1.2 million cubic metres and provides storm 
water control as well as the primary water storage. The permitted water usage from the 
Tutuaca River is 2.0 million cubic metres per annum at a maximum rate of 64 litres per 
second. The current consumption is well under this limit with annual water usage estimated 
at approximately 800,000 cubic metres.  

 Estimated infrastructure requirements for the proposed expanded 18.2
operation 
A schematic of the proposed pulp agglomeration plant layout is given in Figure 17.3 and is 
anticipated to be located to the northwest of the existing crushing plant.  

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

 Crushing facilities 18.2.1
In addition to the existing crushing facilities, additional crushing facilities will be necessary for 
the pulp agglomeration Project. This will include a front end loader, run of mine ore bin, a 
vibrating grizzly feeder, a primary jaw crusher, a secondary screen and a secondary cone 
crusher, belt conveyors, a dust collection and dust suppression system with the necessary 
ducting and piping, a tramp iron magnet, and feeders discharging to the crushed ore 
stockpile.  

 Grinding facilities 18.2.2
The necessary infrastructure for the grinding area will include a stockpile reclaim and rod mill 
feed belt conveyor, a rod mill, a scalping screen, a Vertimill, mill discharge and associated 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         129 of 171

pumps, an automatic sampler, a metal detector and tramp iron magnet if necessary, piping, 
instrumentation, platforms and support structures, thickener feed pumps, control room, and 
ablution facilities.  

 Thickening facilities 18.2.3
The necessary infrastructure for the thickening facilities will include grinding circuit product 
pumps, a feed box, one high-rate thickener, thickener underflow to surge tank feed pumps, 
sumps and all other associated pumps, piping, launders, instrumentation, platforms, support 
structures, filter press feed pumps, and filtrate pumps.  

 Filtration facilities 18.2.4
The necessary infrastructure for the filtration facilities will include a filter feed surge tank, a 
filter feed surge tank agitator, filter feed pumps, three filter presses with air blow and 
membrane squeeze, filter cake conveyors, filtrate tank, filtrate pump, piping to deliver the 
pregnant solution to the existing Merrill-Crowe plant, instrumentation, and platforms and 
support structures.  

 Agglomeration facilities 18.2.5
The necessary infrastructure for the agglomeration facilities will include a cement silo, one 
agglomeration drum, process solution sprayers, instrumentation, platforms, support 
structures, and additional conveyors to feed the agglomerates to the stacking system on heap 
leach Pad 3.  

 Reagent facilities 18.2.6
The necessary infrastructure for the sodium cyanide, flocculant, lime, and cement reagent 
facilities will include tanks, mixers, pumps, metering pumps, piping, instrumentation, 
platforms and support structures, storage facilities, two overhead travelling cranes, and 
splitters. The facilities are anticipated to have the capacity to store a two day supply of 
cement. Existing facilities will be used for storage of a one month supply of lime and sodium 
cyanide.  

 Auxiliary facilities 18.2.7
The facilities will also include compressed air, power supply, and process solution and water 
management systems. The compressed air facilities will consist of plant and instrument air, 
compressors, filters, receivers, piping, instrumentation, and platforms and support structures. 
The process solution management system will include pumps and tanks for the collection, 
storage, and distribution of the pregnant solution from the Pad 3 discharge that will be used 
as process water. The water management system will include pumps, tanks for the collection, 
storage, treatment, and distribution of the plant fresh water, fire suppression water, potable 
water, and plant safety showers.  

An expansion of the current camp facilities will be necessary to house additional construction

 Cemented rock fill plant 18.2.8
A cemented rock fill plant necessary for providing back fill and ground support to the 
underground operation will comprise a fully automated mixing plant where cement, 
aggregate, and water are combined in a concrete-style drum mixer. These facilities will 
include a mixer structure, mixer feed conveyor, aggregate belt feeder, a slurry plant, and a 
cement silo. Aggregate will be comprised of a combination of waste rock with the oversize 
screened off and spent heap leach material that will be blended into an engineered aggregate 
by a series of aggregate hoppers and conveyors. The plant will be loaded by a front end 
loader and discharged directly into mine haul trucks that are equipped with ejector beds so 
that the backfill can be tipped directly into the open stopes.  

 Power 18.2.9
Power is currently generated on site by six 1,800 kW Cummins and two 1,200 kW Caterpillar 
diesel generators. This reserve provides the start current requirements of the existing primary 
or tertiary crusher motors and also allows for planned and unplanned shutdown of two 
generating sets for maintenance, without disturbing the plant operations. The existing power 
station capacity is a total of 13.2 MW. In 2014, the power demand for the existing operations 
are forecast to be average 6.8 MW, reaching a maximum of 8.4 MW when re-starting the 
crusher motors, which are the largest motors on site. Power costs using diesel generators are 
anticipated to be on the order of $0.29 per kilowatt hour, depending on the cost of diesel.  

The lease of an additional 2,000 kW generating set is considered for six months to cover the 
power requirements of the pulp agglomeration plant with the assumption that grid power 
will be installed by April, 2016. If connection to a power grid is not available, then an 
additional 2,000 kW generator will be required to cover the power requirements. The 
estimated operating load is 3,500 kW for a 5,600 tonnes per day pulp agglomeration plant, 
with an estimated total connected load of 5,130 kW.  

 Water 18.2.10
The only additional water requirements for the pulp agglomeration plant include minor 
amounts of raw water for hydration of cement to form the agglomerates, increased water 
retained in the agglomerates in the heap, and miscellaneous fresh water needs such as 
emergency eye wash and showers. The current water supply infrastructure will be adequate 
for the expansion Project needs and any additional water supply will become available from 
the underground mine dewatering.   

 Recommendations 18.2.11
The main Project infrastructure has been identified and the cost has been included. Detailed 
engineering will be required in order to more accurately assess the cost estimates and the 
technical feasibility and economic viability of the Project. Some of the additional studies for 
infrastructure are discussed here. 

The secondary crushing equipment selected for this study has been sized in common with the 
existing crushing plant, which affords benefits in areas such as spares stockholding. If the run 
of mine feed size can be reduced by varying the blasting practices in the pit, then smaller and 
less expensive primary and secondary crushing equipment may be used. It is recommended 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         131 of 171

to evaluate the benefits of varying the blasting practices in the pit in order to reduce the 
crushing equipment in the pulp agglomeration plant. 

An opportunity lies in diverting the rod mill product to pre-leach holding tanks for early 
recovery of silver and gold prior to the thickening and filtration process. This option may be 
more attractive at higher metal prices. Additional studies are required to compare the 
additional capital and operating costs versus the advantage of improved kinetics.  

The authors recommend exploring opportunities to optimize the filtration equipment. There 
is an opportunity to use vacuum filters if medium grade material is added to the 
agglomeration drums to help control the moisture content while forming agglomerates. 
Diverting the crushed medium grade material to the agglomeration drum circuit would add 
flexibility to the high grade filter cake moisture content; however the system would be 
exposed to the variability in the moisture content of the crushed medium grade that changes 
with the seasons at the mine. It is recommended to quantify the peaks of maximum moisture 
content in the crushed medium grade material in order to evaluate the optimization of 
filtration equipment. An estimated $500,000 would be required for the studies to more 
accurately assess the necessary infrastructure. 

The power line project will proceed regardless of the construction decision related to the 
expansion Project.

19 Market studies and contracts 

 Contracts and marketing 19.1
The Dolores operation has a contract in place with a mining contractor, PEAL Mexico of 
Hermosillo, Mexico, to undertake an agreed upon amount of mining per year, most of which 
takes place in the waste areas. 

Dolores also has a multi-year contract in place with Johnson Matthey of Salt Lake City, Utah, 
for the purchase of the doré produced on site. The doré is transported to the Johnson 
Matthey refinery in Salt Lake City where it is refined to the London Good Delivery 
specification, which is defined as a minimum of 995.0 parts per thousand of fine gold and a 
minimum of 999.0 parts per thousand of silver. Once refined, the bars are sold on the 
international market to bullion banks, financial institutions, and traders under negotiated 
fixed term contracts. The terms, rates, and charges are within industry norms. To date, no 
problems have been encountered in securing contracts for the sale of Dolores doré or for the 
doré produced at Pan American's other two mines operating in Mexico. Pan American has 
secured a back-up contract with the Republic Metals Corporation refinery in Miami, Florida, 
and the Met-Mex Peñoles refinery in Torreón, Mexico, in the event that full marketing 
requirements cannot be met by Johnson Matthey. No forward sales or hedging takes place at 
this time.  

 Review by the qualified person 19.2
Martin Wafforn, the qualified person responsible for this section of the technical report, has 
reviewed the contract terms, rates, and charges for the production and sale of the silver and 
gold produced at Dolores, and consider them sufficient to support the assumptions made in 
this technical report.

20 Environmental studies, permitting, and social or community 
impact 

 Environmental factors 20.1
The most significant environmental liabilities associated with the Dolores Property include 
surface disturbance and reclamation liabilities and issues related to the stability and 
containment system of heap leach Pad 1. A tear in the liner of Pad 1 developed in June 2010 
following movement in the stability berm and significant leakage was collected by the leak 
collection system. Minefinders ceased stacking and irrigation on Pad 1 and relocated 
approximately 2 million tonnes of ore to heap leach Pad 2. The pad under the excavated 
material was examined and stabilized with an additional retaining wall structure, and the 
damaged liner was repaired. No sodium cyanide was detected in the downstream surface and 
ground water sampling points as a result of the failure, and continued soil and water sampling 
below Pad 1 has confirmed that no residual cyanide is present. Approximately 8 to 9 million 
tonnes of ore remain in a stable state on Pad 1, awaiting transfer to another operational pad. 
Full remediation of the liner system will be required as the life of mine plan anticipates that 
the Pad 1 area will be required for heap leaching in the future and that the liner system in the 
area will be fully rebuilt.  

Pan American has implemented additional contingency measures in and around leach Pads 1 
and 2, including the installation of well riser type over-liner solution collection systems, 
additional under drain and leak collection systems, and a network of containment, 
monitoring, and demonstration wells. Pan American has also completed construction and is 
operating an extension to Pad 2, after application of rigorous quality control to both the 
design and construction of the facility, and has finalized construction of the first phase of 
Pad 3.  

The surface disturbance and reclamation liabilities will be addressed under Pan American's 
project reclamation and closure plan, which is discussed in Section 20.10. 

 Environmental studies 20.2
A full suite of environmental baseline studies was completed by Minefinders as part of its 
original permit application for the construction of the mine. Pan American has continued 
environmental monitoring in and around the mine and continues to add to the database of 
environmental information. These studies would be used in any future permit modification 
application for the expansion Project.  

Static and kinetic testing was conducted during the feasibility and permitting phases of the 
mine development in order to ascertain potential for acid generation in the waste and ore 
materials. That work determined that only a small portion of the waste is potentially acid 
generating and no specific measures to manage waste or ore deposition were required. Pan 
American plans to review the representativity of the samples tested against the current 
mineral resource and reserve estimate and mine plan, and expects to conduct new sampling 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         134 of 171

and testing to increase the available data and to improve the understanding of potential acid 
and metal leaching issues during operation and post-closure.  

 Pan American's environmental policy 20.3
Pan American has committed to operate all mines and develop new projects in an 
environmentally responsible manner. The existing environmental conditions at each site are 
evaluated and Pan American strives to minimize and mitigate environmental impacts of 
mining and processing operations by applying prudent design and operating practices, and by 
educating employees and contractors who work at company facilities. Pan American has an 
environmental policy that all employees and contractors are required to follow.  

 Permitting factors 20.4
Pan American holds all necessary environmental and operating permits for the development 
and operating of the existing mine and is in compliance with Mexican law and international 
best practice environmental management.  

Permit applications for the construction and operation of Dolores, including an Environmental 
Impact Study or Manifestation ("MIA"), a Technical Justification Study for Change of Land-
Use, and an Environmental Risk Study were approved by the Mexican Secretariat of 
Environment and Natural Resources ("SEMARNAT") in April 2006. These studies include a full 
assessment of the environmental and social impacts of the mine and environmental 
management plans, which describe the ongoing management and environmental monitoring 
programs. Other principal permits include an Accident Prevention Program, a Surface Water 
Extraction Authorization, an MIA for an underground exploration ramp, and a Waste 
Management Plan. These permits are renewed regularly and as far as Pan American is aware, 
all of the permits required for the mine and processing operations are in good standing.  

Modifications to the existing permits will be necessary to obtain authorization for future 
activities such as adjustments to the life of mine open pit operations, waste rock facilities, 
and leach pads; expansion of the processing facilities to include additional crushing and a new 
grinding, leaching, and pulp agglomeration circuit; and development of an underground mine. 
Any modification application for these activities will require an updated MIA, Environmental 
Risk Assessment, and Technical Justification Study for Land Use Change. The required 
technical baseline studies and impact assessment for these updates would be based on the 
extensive monitoring database that has been developed over the past seven years, and 
conducted by an independent environmental consultant. Due to the minor changes in 
footprint and the overall impacts that these changes imply, as well as the current good 
standing of the existing permits, it is expected that the necessary permit modifications could 
be completed within standard regulatory timeframes of five to seven months.  

The power line connection from Chihuahua will be the subject of a separate approvals 
process managed with the CFE. 

 Waste disposal 20.5
Mine waste is deposited in three constructed waste rock facilities (East, West and North 
facilities) which are located around the pit. The west waste rock facility has reached full 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         135 of 171

capacity. Environmental permits include an allowance for a south waste rock facility which is 
currently not planned for use, in preference of expanding the existing East and North waste 
rock facilities. The changes to the projected waste rock facility layouts are covered in a 
modification application to the current environmental permits that are currently being 
evaluated by SEMARNAT. The life of mine plan also contemplates storing some waste in the 
southern portion of the open pit mine when mining has been completed in that area. 

The mine operates a closed circuit processing system without tailings facilities. 

 Site monitoring 20.6
The mine operates an extensive monitoring programme that includes surface and 
groundwater, waste, air quality, noise, flora and fauna, and socio-economics. Due to the 
location of the proposed future infrastructure, it is anticipated that there will be no material 
effect on the cost of any modifications to the existing, future, or post-closure monitoring 
programs. 

 Water management 20.7
Water supply for the mine is obtained from the Tutuaca River and a dam constructed on the 
Chabacan Creek upstream of the pit. Wells located in the Arroyo Amplio town area supply 
water to the town and the Dolores camp. Current water use at the operation is approximately 
half that provided for in Dolores' water permits and no modification to the permits are 
anticipated to supply any mining and processing expansions. Process water is recycled and 
the mine has essentially no discharge except for effluent from domestic waste water 
treatment plants servicing the offices and camp. 

 Environmental certification 20.8
The Dolores mine voluntarily participates in the Mexican Federal Environmental Protection 
Authority's ("PROFEPA") Clean Industry Program which involves independent verification of 
compliance with all environmental permits and the implementation of good practice 
environmental management procedures and practices. The mine obtained its first 
certification in 2010 and was re-certified again in June, 2012. 

 Social and community factors 20.9
The majority of the surface rights on the Property are owned by Ejido Huizopa. An ejido is an 
area of communal land registered with the National Agrarian Registry of Mexico and parcelled 
out to community members for agricultural use. The Dolores mine has surface rights 
agreements with Ejido Huizopa and with several individual members of the ejido dating from 
November 2006 which allows for irrevocable access and the right to carry out exploration and 
mining activities for a term of 15 years with a right to extend for a further 15 years. These 
surface rights provide sufficient access to the mining operations, waste storage areas, heap 
leach pad areas, and other facilities. The agreement provided for relocation of the old village 
of Dolores, which formerly occupied an area directly over the southern end of the deposit. 
Construction of the new town and relocation of all families from within the Property area was 
completed by the end of 2009.  

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         136 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -

The Dolores staff community relations team implements an extensive programme of 
community engagement activities including information sessions, infrastructure works, and 
educational and training programs for the local people which have resulted in the 
establishment of several important small businesses. Unskilled workers are sourced from 
nearby small villages, and Pan American has recruiting and training programmes in place to 
develop the mining skills of the local workforce. Dolores is recognized as a Socially 
Responsible Enterprise by the Mexican Center for Philanthropy.  

Pan American, through its Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, has committed to operating 
all of its mines in harmony with the communities where they are located, and to continually 
improve standards of social responsibility and to make a positive difference in the 
surrounding communities by fostering sustainable development.  

 Project reclamation and closure 20.10
A closure cost estimate for Dolores was prepared in 2012 according to Pan American's 
standard methodology which employs the State of Nevada approved Standardized 
Reclamation Cost Estimator ("SRCE") model. This estimate includes consideration of all 
surface disturbance and reclamation liability at the site and is updated on an annual basis. 
The Dolores SRCE model includes demolition of all site infrastructure, re-grading of waste 
rock facilities, rinsing and covering leach pads, and complete re-vegetation of the site. The 
current model estimates the present value of reclamation costs or environmental liability for 
the Dolores Property at December 31, 2012 to be approximately $5.2 million. Reclamation 
bonds are not currently a legal requirement in Mexico. 

Given the long mine life and the location of the proposed expansion Project within the 
existing mine footprint, the incremental change in overall closure cost liability is not expected 
to have a material effect on the conclusions of this report. 

 Expected material environmental issues 20.11
There are no known environmental issues that could materially impact the mine's ability to 
extract the mineral resources or mineral reserves. 

Due to the relative scale, the physical and organizational changes proposed in the expansion 
Project are unlikely to modify the existing environmental and social impacts at the Property. A 
permit modification for the Project would be lodged with the Mexican authorities and the 
processing of that permit application is not expected to create unmanageable time delays or 
risk to the realization of the Project.  

There are no known environmental or social issues that could materially impact the mine's 
ability to extract the mineral resources or mineral reserves or affect the viability of the 
expansion Project.

21 Capital and operating costs 

 Estimated capital, sustaining capital, and operating costs of the 21.1
existing operations 
The Dolores mine has been constructed and is in operation, however, capital expenditures 
that will be required in 2014 and 2015 regardless of the construction decision related to the 
expansion Project include $11.6 million to complete the current phase of construction on 
heap leach Pad 3, $15.2 million for the new power line, and a further $2.0 million for 
technical support to the operation and the expansion Project. 

Sustaining capital expenditures for the existing operation are estimated to total 
$118.8 million over the remaining mine life. This includes an estimated $60.4 million for 
mining, primarily for the rebuild and replacement of the open pit mining equipment fleet over 
the life of the operation. A further $42.1 million has been estimated for future construction of 
heap leach pad capacity after the current phase of construction. Other sustaining capital of 
$16.4 million is estimated for G&A purposes. No capitalization of waste mining or pre-
stripping strategy has been assumed as part of this preliminary economic assessment in the 
coming years, although should Pan American decide to use pre-stripping accounting, it is the 
opinion of the authors that this will not materially change the cash flow or the overall Project 
economics.  

For the estimate of operating costs, the existing operation is assumed to continue to mine, 
crush, and convey material to the heap leach pads at the same rate as the existing 
16,200 tonnes per day. Mining of the 69.7 million tonnes of proven and probable mineral 
reserves will be completed in 2024 and stacking of stockpiled material on the leach pads will 
continue for another two years. Thereafter a further four years of solution recirculation and 
precious metal extraction will follow during leach-down of silver and gold from the heap leach 
pads. The new power line and connection to the Chihuahua electrical grid is expected to be 
completed by the beginning of 2016 and will result in a significant reduction in operating 
costs. 

Mining unit costs in the open pit are expected to vary primarily by depth and haulage 
distance. Mining costs are estimated to total $700.2 million to mine 340.6 million total ore 
and waste tonnes, including the cost of stockpiling and re-handling stockpiles over the life of 
the mine. Processing costs are estimated to total $554.1 million to process 69.7 million 
tonnes, including the cost of solution recirculation for leach-down of silver and gold from the 
heap leach pads. G&A charges are estimated to total $170.8 million over the life of mine.  

 Estimated costs for the proposed expanded operation 21.2
 Introduction 21.2.1

Capital and operating cost estimates for a proposed pulp agglomeration processing option 
and an underground mine have been prepared at a preliminary economic assessment level. 
The estimates for the underground mine are based on resource and cost estimates prepared 
by Pan American, underground geotechnical parameters and options and cost estimates for 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         138 of 171

backfill prepared by Golder Associates of Vancouver, and a mine plan and schedule prepared 
by Snowden. The estimates for the pulp agglomeration plant were prepared by Pan American 
and by Lyntek Incorporated of Lakewood, Colorado ("Lyntek"). 

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

 Estimated capital and sustaining capital costs for the underground mine 21.2.2
The preliminary design for the underground mine is to utilize decline access for haulage and 
transportation of personnel and materials. The decline makes use of the previously 
established portal which is located approximately 750 m east of the final pit crest at an 
elevation of 1,335 m and approaches the mineralized zone near its mid-point. From there the 
decline splits to develop the zones to the north and to the south providing access to sub 
levels at 25 m vertical intervals. Snowden has provided preliminary designs for a ventilation 
circuit where fresh air is provided via the decline and a fresh air raise, with return air via raise 
bore holes and surface fans. A total of 14,300 m of decline ventilation drives has been 
estimated as well as 900 m of 4 m to 4.5 m diameter main ventilation circuit raise bore holes. 

Capital costs for the mobile equipment were estimated using data from other underground 
studies in Mexico and elsewhere. The purchase cost of two large capacity haulage trucks 
(45 tonne and 55 tonne) and a scoop tram already purchased were excluded from the 
estimate. Over the life of mine the estimated capital cost is $77.6 million. Of this, 
$34.8 million can be considered initial capital, which includes all costs incurred in the first two 
years and the cost of mobile equipment entering the fleet at the beginning of the third year. 
All primary access declines and ventilation designs are capitalized, while level development is 
capitalized during the first two years and treated as an operational expense thereafter. A 
summary of the preliminary estimate of initial and sustaining capital costs is given in Table 
21.1.

 Estimated capital and sustaining capital costs for the pulp agglomeration 21.2.3
facilities 

The capital cost estimate included in this preliminary economic assessment has been 
developed to a level sufficient to assess and evaluate the Project concept, various process 
options, and the potential for overall Project viability. After inclusion of the recommended 
contingency, the capital cost estimate is considered to have a level of accuracy in the range of 
plus and minus 25%. Amounts are presented in second quarter 2014 United States dollars. 

The initial capital cost estimate addresses the completion of design engineering, 
procurement, construction, and start-up of a pulp agglomeration process plant for a nominal 
5,600 tonnes per day circuit for preparing a high grade silver and gold feed amenable to 
cyanide leaching via a heap leach pad. The initial capital costs are expected to be on the order 
of $69.6 million, including $35.3 million of direct capital, $20.0 million of indirect capital, and 
$14.3 million of contingency. A breakdown of the capital costs is given in Table 21.2.  

The cost estimate includes: 

• $22.1 million of mechanical equipment including labour and ancillary systems 

• $7.3 million for earthworks, civil, structural, and concrete 

• $3.7 million for electrical, control, and instrumentation 

• $2.2 million for piping and buildings associated with the plant 

• $8.7 million of engineering, procurement, and construction management 
("EPCM") for the delivery of the plant and infrastructure, including mobilization, 
equipment rentals such as generator, contractor fuel and maintenance, small 
tools and consumables, and vendor commissioning 

• $6.3 million for camp expansion, camp operations, Pan American's Project 
management team, overhead costs, consultants, geotechnical work, and 
additional test work 

• $2.5 million for capital spares, one-year spares, and commissioning spares and 
liners for the first year-wear 

• $2.5 million for cost of freight and freight forwarding services for mixed 
domestic and international procurement 

The following items are not included in the capital estimate:  

• Sunk costs that are associated with the existing plant and leach pads 

• All taxes 

• Reclamation costs 

• Potable water and sewage systems for the plant 

• Working capital and sustaining capital

Sustaining capital costs for the addition of a pulp agglomeration plant includes an estimate of 
an additional $6.4 million for the additional heap leach pad tonnage, $2.7 million for the pulp 
agglomeration plant, and a reduction of $0.3 million in G&A due to cut-back of one year of 
metal production because of the higher treatment rate with the addition of the pulp 
agglomeration plant as well as better recovery kinetics of the pulp agglomerated material.

 Underground operating cost estimates 21.2.4
A cost model was developed for the underground using fundamental productivity 
assumptions for the nominated equipment, such as drill penetration rates, and scoop tram 
and truck speeds, combined with the physicals from the schedule to build up fleet size and 
fleet utilization values. This was then combined with unit operating costs for the equipment, 
unit costs for material, and labour costs which were in turn derived from, in some cases, first 
principals, and in other cases, previous similar studies or operational experience at Dolores. 
Level development is estimated at 11,700 m in waste and 12,300 m in pulp agglomeration 
plant feed, and a further 1,600 m are estimated for small diameter raise bore holes for 
ventilating air distribution within the mine.  

Based on the underground mining schedule, a cost model was developed that produced a 
total operating cost over the life of mine of $175.6 million, which equates to $34.94 per tonne 
of feed mined. Operating costs include all underground mining costs, up to the delivery of the 
feed to the crusher stockpile, or waste to the final backfill or waste rock facility location. Key 
inputs to the mining cost estimate include diesel fuel at $1.02 per litre, electrical power at 
$0.12 per kWh, and cement at $194 per tonne. Operating costs are estimated to be expended 
at an annual rate of between $15 and $18.5 million. A summary of the operating cost items is 
shown in Table 21.3.

 Pulp agglomeration operating cost estimates 21.2.5
Operating costs for the proposed pulp agglomeration plant are expected to be on the order of 
$18.15 per tonne of feed, including $15.20 per tonne of feed for processing costs and 
$2.95 per tonne of feed for G&A. A detailed breakdown of the operating costs is given in 
Table 21.4. Following completion of stacking on the heap leach pads, additional expenditures 
will be required for a further three years of solution recirculation and precious metal 
extraction. The additional annual costs include $1.6 million for processing solution and 
$1.2 million for G&A costs.  

The estimate includes provisions for feed re-handling, reagents, consumables, power, water, 
and fuel for the operation of the plant, 64 additional employees and their associated costs, 
operating spares, wear and maintenance costs of the plant equipment, and the additional 
demands on the heap leaching, Merrill-Crowe, refining/smelting, generators, laboratory, 
metallurgy, and process general administration. Mining and plant road maintenance costs are 
not included in the pulp agglomeration costs.  

The operating cost estimate has been developed with the consultants' inputs, current costs of 
Dolores operations, and test work results. Power draw was calculated based on the size of the 
motors, power demand for the processing areas, and the projected power cost per kW-hr 
($0.12 per kW-hr). Wear and media costs were estimated based on test work results, and in 
the case of the crushing liners were confirmed by the actual consumption and costs at 
Dolores as well as using a database of liner weights. Reagents and consumables were derived 
from test work results and on-going tests of cyanide, cement, and lime consumptions as well 
as actual consumptions in the Merrill-Crowe and refining/smelting facilities at the Dolores 
operation. Current vendor pricing for steel and reagents was applied to the consumption 
rates to derive the per tonne costs. Labour cost estimates are based on actual current rates at 
the operation. 

The unit costs at the existing facilities of heap leaching, Merrill-Crowe, smelting, generators, 
process maintenance, labs, and process administration will reduce due to the additional 
volume from pulp agglomeration plant and from the benefit of grid power beginning in 2016. 

For the estimate of operating costs, it has been assumed that the existing operation will 
continue to mine, crush, and convey material to the heap leach pads at the same rate as the 
existing 16,200 tonnes per day operation until the pulp agglomeration plant begins 
operations at the beginning of 2016. Thereafter, the pulp agglomeration plant will process

5,600 tonnes per day and the existing crushing plant will process 14,400 tonnes per day. The 
total material processed increases to 80.3 million tonnes from 69.7 million tonnes due to a 
lower costs and improved economics of the higher processing rate in the pit and the addition 
of 5.0 million tonnes from underground. Open pit mining is estimated to be completed in 
2024 while underground mining and stacking of stockpiled material on the leach pads will 
continue for another two years. Thereafter a further three years of solution recirculation and 
precious metal extraction will follow during leach-down of silver and gold from the heap leach 
pads. The new power line and connection to the Chihuahua electricity grid is expected to be 
completed by the beginning of 2016 and will result in a significant reduction in operating 
costs. 

Mining unit costs in the open pit are expected to vary primarily by depth and haulage 
distance. Open pit mining costs are estimated to total $683.5 million to mine 337.2 million 
total tonnes, including the cost of stockpiling and re-handling stockpiles over the life of the 
mine. Processing costs are estimated to total $685.5 million to process 80.3 million tonnes, 
including the cost of solution recirculation for leach-down of silver and gold from the heap 
leach pads. G&A charges are estimated to total $178.9 million over the life of mine.

The crushing equipment selected for this study has been sized in common with the existing 
crushing plant, which affords benefits in areas such as spares stockholding, and is oversized to 
cater for a relatively large run of mine feed size. If the run of mine feed size can be reduced by 
varying the blasting practices in the pit, then smaller and less expensive crushing equipment 
may be used.  

Additional cost savings may be found by the use of second hand, discounted, or unutilized 
equipment at Pan American's other operations.  

 Risks 21.2.7
The pulp agglomeration plant operation was developed in the absence of site specific 
geotechnical information. The site was chosen with a degree of confidence in the ground 
competence, but there is a risk that additional excavation and fill may be required to provide 
solid ground. Typical risks to the estimate of the capital cost would include the availability of 
equipment for purchase or hire, increases in equipment and labour costs, and extensions in 
the length of the rainy season and the construction time. Typical risks to the estimate of the 
operating costs would include increases to the reagent and power consumption and costs, 
and availability of equipment and contractors.  

 Recommendations 21.2.8
Capital and operational costs for the Dolores expansion Project have been estimated at a 
preliminary level. It is recommended to advance the preliminary economic assessment of the 
pulp agglomeration processing option and the underground mine development to a pre-
feasibility study level. This will require more detailed engineering and test work to more 
accurately assess the cost estimates of the Project.

22 Economic analysis 

 Estimated economic model for the existing operation 22.1
 Estimated life of mine plan 22.1.1

The life of mine plan for the open pit in situ reserves as at May 31, 2014 is for processing a 
total of 69.7 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 32 ppm Ag and 0.79 ppm Au, 
including 6.0 million tonnes of ore currently placed on stockpiles and awaiting processing. The 
ore mining rate varies annually from between 5.2 million to 9.5 million tonnes per year until 
2023, and reduces to 0.7 million tonnes in 2024, the final year of mining. Processing of 
stockpiles continues to 2026 and metal recovery from the heap leach pads extends to 2030. 
The projected mine life of the existing operation may increase if additional mineral resources 
are defined and can be converted to mineral reserves. 

The total produced ounces accounting for metallurgical recovery is estimated at 44.7 million 
ounces of silver and 1.3 million ounces of gold. Overall metallurgical recoveries for new 
material added to the heap leach pads are 55.2% for silver and 70.1% for gold. These 
recoveries increase to 61.7% for silver and 70.8% for gold when factoring in the recovery of 
metal from material already on the pads.  

The open pit mining requires the removal of 276.9 million tonnes of waste to access the ore, 
for a strip ratio of 1 to 4.35.  

 Estimated cash flow forecast 22.1.2
The operating cash flow of the existing operation is anticipated to total $825.8 million, which 
is comprised of an estimated revenue of $2,602.9 million, $1,425.1 million in operating costs, 
$21.9 million in smelting and refining charges, $13.0 million relating to the new 0.5% 
extraordinary mining duty on gross revenue, $72.3 million on third-party royalties, 
$71.6 million relating to the new 7.5% special mining duty on earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"), and $171.0 million in income taxes. After 
accounting for reclamation and capital expenditures, the total net cash flow for the operation 
is estimated to be $671.4 million. The after tax NPV at an 8% discount rate is estimated at 
$389.6 million. 

 Assumptions 22.1.3
Metal prices for this analysis were set at $22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold.  

Overall production is estimated at 44.7 million ounces of silver and 1.3 million ounces of gold. 
This production includes 13.2 million ounces of silver and 375,000 ounces of gold from oxide 
material, 19.8 million ounces of silver and 403,000 ounces of gold from mixed material, and 
11.7 million ounces of silver and 473,000 ounces of gold from sulphide material. Silver 
metallurgical recoveries were assumed at 47.4% for oxide material and 59.2 for mixed and 
sulphide material, and gold metallurgical recoveries were assumed at 81.5% for oxide 
material and 66.1% for mixed and sulphide material.  

Total doré produced is estimated at 48.4 million ounces. Refinery payable is assumed to be 
99.75% for silver and 99.8% for gold. Refinery treatment charges are assumed to be $0.22 per 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         146 of 171

ounce of doré, plus gold refining charges of $0.50 per ounce of gold, and transport and 
insurance charges are assumed at $0.22 per ounce of doré.  

 Estimated taxes, duties, and royalties 22.1.4
The principal taxes of Mexico affecting Dolores include income tax, annual fees for holding 
mineral properties, various payroll and social security taxes, and a refundable value added 
tax. Total taxes, mining duties, and mining duties payable to the government for the Project 
are forecast at $255.5 million.  

On October 1, 2007, the Mexican taxing authority enacted a business flat tax ("IETU") that 
became effective in 2008 and was defined as a minimum tax in respect to income tax, but 
with a wider taxable base as many of the tax deductions authorized for income tax purposes 
were not permissible for IETU. 

On October 31, 2013, the Mexican government enacted a new mining tax that became 
effective in 2014. The new mining tax includes a 7.5% special mining duty on EBITDA, a 0.5% 
extraordinary mining duty on gross revenue, and cancelling the IETU tax. 

A net smelter return of 2.0% on silver and 3.25% on gold is payable to RG Mexico Inc., a 
subsidiary of Royal Gold Inc. The total paid for the royalty is forecast at $72.3 million.  

 Estimated economic model for the proposed expanded operation 22.2
 Introduction 22.2.1

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

Following a two year construction period where crushing continues at the current rate of 
16,200 tonnes per day, the pulp agglomeration treatment option considers a 20,000 tonne 
per day rate, including 14,400 tonne per day of open pit feed processed in the existing three 
stage crushing circuit plus 5,600 tonnes per day crushed, ground, and pulp agglomerated 
higher grade material from the open pit and from the underground. Since some of the 
existing facilities will be used for the pulp agglomeration plant and the underground mine, 
the treatment of the medium grade in the existing facilities will be reduced to 14,400 tonnes 
per day from the current 16,200 tonnes per day. Complete life of mine plans have been made 
for the options of continuing with the existing heap leach only crushing circuit, and for the 
option of constructing the pulp agglomeration plant and the underground mine. The annual 
production schedule and annual cash flow forecast for the life of mine estimated for the 
proposed expanded operation are given in Table 22.1. A comparison has then been made of 
the cash flow streams in order to determine the potential benefits of the pulp agglomeration 
and underground option.

 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -  

Preliminary Economic Assessment of a Pulp Agglomeration Treatment and Underground Option - Technical Report 

 

As part of the analysis, the option of developing the underground mine without the pulp 
agglomeration plant was considered. In this option, the economic underground material was 
assumed to be processed in the existing crushing circuit. Although the economics were 
marginally better than the open pit to heap leach only option, the authors concluded that 
development of the underground mine is dependent upon the increased metallurgical 
recovery provided by the pulp agglomeration plant. For this reason the options presented 
are: 

• The existing case which is open pit feed processed in the existing crushing plant and 
sent to the heap leach pads for leaching, including the benefit of a new power line. 

• The expanded case which includes the construction of the pulp agglomeration plant 
and the underground mine, including the benefit of a new power line.  

Increasing processing to a rate of 20,000 tonnes per day as assumed in the expanded case 
requires initial capital expenditures of $104.5 million for the pulp agglomeration plant and the 
underground development. The investment increases total cash flow to $853.3 million and 
increases the after tax NPV to $479.8 million at a discount rate of 8%. 

The project was evaluated on an after-tax, free cash flow basis. The income tax rate 
applicable to corporations in Mexico was increased from 28% to 30% effective 
January 1, 2014. A tax-deductible special mining duty of 7.5% was applied on earnings before 
the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. An additional 0.5% 
extraordinary mining duty on precious metals revenue (applicable to precious metals only) 
was assumed to be in effect as of January 1, 2014.  

Comparing the cash flow streams of the two options, the expanded case generates an 
estimated IRR of 32.8% relative to the existing operation.  

This preliminary economic assessment compares the relative value of the existing 
16,200 tonne per day heap leach operation and a 20,000 tonne per day pulp agglomeration 
and heap leach operation. Summary production and financial metrics of the two options are 
given in Table 22.2, assuming grid power costs.

 Estimated life of mine plan 22.2.2
For the preliminary economic assessment, the open pit mine has been optimized and 
redesigned with the combined pulp agglomeration and heap leach processes and using metal 
prices of $22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. The life of mine plan for the 
expanded case includes an additional 5.6 million tonnes of mineralization from the open pit 
that was formerly uneconomic with the heap leach only metal recoveries and operating costs, 
as well as an additional 5.0 million tonnes of mineralization from the underground mine.  

As a result of the underground development and sharing the fixed cost of some of the existing 
facilities, the total economic material mined increases by 15% to 80.3 million tonnes at an 
average grade of 33 ppm Ag and 0.80 ppm Au, with a contained metal content of 84.7 million 
ounces of silver and 2.1 million ounces of gold. Total produced ounces accounting for 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         151 of 171

metallurgical recovery are 58.4 million ounces of silver and 1.6 million ounces of gold. The 
total waste mined to access the feed is 271.3 million tonnes, reducing the strip ratio slightly 
to 1 to 4.12.  

The preliminary economic analysis assumes that the open pit will continue until the end of 
2023 and that stockpiled open pit material will be processed in 2024 and 2025. The 
underground mine is anticipated to continue operations providing feed to the pulp 
agglomeration plant until into 2026. Production from residual leach-down of silver and gold 
from the heap leach pads is projected to continue through 2029. The projected mine life of 
the expanded operation may increase if additional mineral resources are defined and can be 
converted to mineral reserves. 

 Estimated cash flow forecast 22.2.3
The operating cash flow of the expanded operation is anticipated to increase to 
$1,163.6 million, comprised of $3,377.1 million in revenue, $1,723.5 million in operating 
costs, $28.6 million in smelting and refining charges, $16.9 million relating to the new 
extraordinary mining duty, $93.7 million in third party royalties, $103.8 million relating to the 
new special mining duty, and $244.6 million in income taxes payable to the government. After 
accounting for reclamation and capital expenditures, the total net cash flow for the operation 
is estimated to be $853.3 million. The after tax NPV at an 8% discount rate is estimated at 
$479.8 million.  

 Assumptions 22.2.4
A preliminary estimate of the processing and selling costs associated with the pulp 
agglomeration treatment was used as an input to prepare the underground mining inventory. 
These parameters are shown in Table 22.3. Taxes were excluded from the analysis but are 
included in the later economic modelling.

An assessment was made of the sensitivity of the Project to reduced feed grades by 
simulating increased dilution, which showed that the expansion case was preferred to the 
existing operation.  

Increasing the underground and pulp agglomeration capital costs by 25% has the impact of 
reducing the IRR versus the existing operation to 24.8% at metal prices of $22 per ounce of 
silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. As shown in Table 22.5, the impact of the Project 
economics of increasing and decreasing the operating cost estimates for the underground 
and pulp agglomeration by 25% at metal prices of $22 per ounce of silver and $1,300 per 
ounce of gold reduces the IRR of the expansion case versus the existing operation to 22.6%, 
which demonstrates the robust nature of the Project.

 Risks 22.2.8
Fluctuations in the prices of silver and gold represent one of the most significant factors 
affecting the profitability of the Dolores mine. Within the range of metal prices considered, 
the expansion Project provides enhanced economics.  

The majority of the material in the underground mining plan for this preliminary economic 
assessment is from inferred mineral resources that are based on limited drillhole information. 
Due to the uncertainty that is associated with inferred mineral resources, it cannot be 
assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to indicated or 
measured mineral resources as a result of additional drilling.

 Recommendations 22.2.9
It is recommended to advance the preliminary economic assessment of the Dolores 
expansion Project to a pre-feasibility study level. This will require more detailed mine 
engineering, mine plans, and cost estimates for the underground mine, as well as additional 
testing, trade-offs, and engineering and cost estimates of the process area to more accurately 
assess the technical feasibility and economic viability of the Project.

25 Interpretation and conclusions 
The Dolores mine was acquired by Pan American in 2012 as part of the acquisition of 
Minefinders. Pan American has operated the mine for the last two years, and following an 
initial period of investment, particularly in building heap leach pad capacity, the operation is 
now at steady state.  

This technical report demonstrates that the proven and probable mineral reserves in the 
mine plan will be economic with the forecast metal prices and other assumptions. The 
preliminary economic assessment disclosed in this technical report also demonstrates that 
the Dolores expansion Project has the potential to be economically robust. Based on the 
current mineral reserves, the mine is projected to continue to produce silver and gold until 
2030. With the higher production rate of the expansion case and the addition of some 
mineral resources, the mine will still produce until 2030. This projected mine life may increase 
if additional mineral resources are defined and can be converted to mineral reserves.  

The preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources 
which are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is 
no certainty that the assessment will be realized. 

 Mineral resources and mineral reserves 25.1
There are no known drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the 
reliability of the drilling results used to estimate mineral resources and reserves. Pan 
American intends to continue annual near-mine diamond drilling programmes to test the 
southern and down dip extents of the currently defined mineralization and to conduct regular 
infill drilling of the deposit to upgrade mineral resource and reserve confidence categories.  

There are no known significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to 
affect the reliability or confidence in the mineral resource and reserve estimates. Pan 
American routinely conducts reconciliation of the reserve model to the grade control model 
and to the heap leach feed conveyor weight meter and sampler in order to monitor actual 
mine versus model performance. Between January and May 31, 2014, sample grade 
information obtained from closer spaced grade control drilling (10 m along strike and 15 m 
across strike) has allowed the operation to identify and economically mine additional lower 
grade material in some areas that was either not identified by the exploration drillhole data 
used to estimate the mineral reserve, or else was not supported by sufficient data to estimate 
the tonnes and grade of the mineralization to mineral reserve levels of confidence. 
Additionally, in some areas the closer spaced grade control drilling has revealed less physical 
continuity of the economic zones as assumed by the interpretation of the wider spaced 
exploration data. These two factors have resulted in the operation mining year to date 21% 
more ore tonnes at a 17% lower silver grade and a 26% lower gold grade, for a difference of 
nil in silver ounces and 10% fewer gold ounces relative to the tonnes, grade, and contained 
metal estimated in the reserve model.  

 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         159 of 171

 Mineral processing, metallurgical testing, and recovery methods 25.2
Broken ore is trucked from the open pit to a crushing plant where the target treatment rate is 
a nominal rate of 16,200 tonnes per day crushed to a target particle size of P80 6.3 mm in a 
three stage crushing circuit with a recirculating load. The crushed ore product is conveyed to 
the leach pads and placed on the pads using portable grasshoppers and a radial stacking 
system. Sodium cyanide solution is pumped to the leach pads directly or to a holding tank 
near Pad 3, from where it is distributed to the heap leach pads and applied using a 
combination of drip and sprayer systems. The mine operates a closed circuit processing 
system without tailings facilities. 

The pregnant leach solution containing the dissolved silver and gold is collected from the 
bottom of the leach piles and transferred to the pregnant solution pond. The solution is 
clarified, de-oxygenated, and processed through a Merrill-Crowe circuit with a nominal 
capacity of 1,000 cubic metres per hour to precipitate silver and gold from the cyanide 
solution. The clarified and de-oxygenated silver and gold cyanide solution is added to zinc 
dust, which triggers the precipitation of the silver and gold. The remaining barren cyanide 
solution is then recycled back to the heap leach pad for continued processing, while the 
precipitate in suspension is pumped to filter presses, where the resulting material containing 
zinc, gold, and silver is dried. The dried material is then mixed with fluxes and melted in a 
furnace to form doré bars. The bars are cleaned, assayed, weighed, and transported to a third 
party refinery in North America for final recovery. The heap leach pads, ponds, and cyanide 
circuit are contained within a closed circuit and not released to the environment.  

For the existing heap leach only operation, column leach testing on a range of mineralization 
grades and lithologies from the Dolores deposit yielded gold recoveries ranging between 51% 
and 91%, and silver recoveries between 23% and 74%, all at a particle size of P80 passing 
6.3 mm. Based on laboratory test work and site performance, the metallurgical recovery 
model created for the mineral reserve estimate estimates gold recoveries of 81.5% for oxides 
and 66.1% for mixed and sulphide ores, and silver recoveries of 47.4% for oxides and 59.2% 
for mixed and sulphide ores. The kinetic model created for the mineral reserve estimate 
assumes a three year period to achieve ultimate gold recovery and five years to achieve 
ultimate silver recovery. The authors have reviewed these models and conclude that they are 
consistent with recovery tracking observations in the heap leach operation at the mine. 

For the expansion Project, it is the authors' opinion that sufficient test work has been 
conducted to confirm that the recovery of silver and gold increase at finer grind size at 
Dolores. The metallurgical recovery model created for the pulp agglomeration of high grade 
mineralization presented in this preliminary economic assessment estimates gold recoveries 
of 89.3% for oxides and 82.4% for mixed and sulphide material and silver recoveries of 66.1% 
for oxides and 76.7% for mixed and sulphide material, all at a particle size of P80 425 microns. 
The kinetic model created for pulp agglomeration assumes a one year period to achieve 
ultimate gold recovery for oxide material and two years to achieve ultimate gold recovery 
mixed and sulphide material. The ultimate silver recovery of all material types subject to pulp 
agglomeration is assumed to take two years. The authors conclude that these models are 
reasonable and respect the available data. 

The load / permeability tests that have been conducted and the experience gained from other 
operations using a similar process provide a reasonable degree of assurance that the 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         160 of 171

agglomerates will remain stable in the heap leach stack. The ponding issue on the master 
composite using 15 kg/t of cement and shortened curing time is an indication that the 
operation would need to be vigilant in ensuring a minimum of 20 kg/t of cement and 
adequate curing time during actual operations. 

The pilot plant testing results provide a good degree of confidence for rod and Vertimill sizing. 
Filtration and other testing have also been conducted. The authors consider that the 
metallurgical and recovery methods have been developed to the point to confirm the 
concepts. 

There are no known significant risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to 
affect the reliability and confidence in the projected economic outcomes. The preliminary 
economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources which are 
considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them 
that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that 
the assessment will be realized. 

The expansion Project construction could be completed over a period of 15 to 18 months and 
would involve increasing the current treatment rate from roughly 16,500 to 20,000 tonnes 
per day by processing the high grade portion of the mined material through a pulp 
agglomeration treatment plant and conveying the agglomerated material with the crushed 
lower grade portion of the mined material to the heap leach pads for leaching. The pulp 
agglomeration plant would be comprised of crushing, grinding, particle size classification, 
thickening, filtration, agglomeration, and reagent facilities. The pulp agglomeration process of 
liberating metals by grinding has the advantage of improved leaching kinetics and ultimate 
recovery of precious metals in the high grade feed relative to the existing heap leach method. 
The improvement in recovery of the high grade fraction due to pulp agglomeration is 
estimated at around 19% for silver and 13% for gold. This results in an overall improvement in 
metal recovery of around 7% for both silver and gold for the entire mineral inventory.  

 Mining and financial 25.3
The preliminary economic assessment of expanding the Dolores mine by adding a milling and 
pulp agglomeration circuit to the processing flow sheet to enhance silver and gold recoveries 
of higher grade mineralization, as well as by developing an underground mine to extract 
mineral resources that exist beneath and to the south of the ultimate open pit floor, has been 
shown to have positive economic results.  

Underground mining is expected to occur concurrently with open pit mining, and will be 
developed to commence production at approximately the same time as the pulp 
agglomeration plant construction is completed. The proposed underground mining method is 
open stoping, a low cost mechanized bulk mining method, appropriate for the competent 
ground conditions present at the mine that allows for a near complete extraction of the 
mineable inventory. A preliminary underground schedule based on the underground mine 
plan targets a production rate of approximately 1,500 tonnes per day to feed the pulp 
agglomeration circuit in tandem with the high grade portion of the material from the open pit 
mine. The planned schedule indicates underground development commencing in 2015 with 
full production achieved in 2018 and a mine life of approximately 12 years, including 
construction time. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         161 of 171 

 



 Technical Report for the Dolores Property, Chihuahua, Mexico -

The mine schedule for the expansion Project assumes that the open pit will continue until the 
end of 2023 and that stockpiled open pit material will be processed in 2024 and 2025. The 
underground mine is anticipated to continue operations providing feed to the pulp 
agglomeration plant until into 2026. Production from residual leach-down of silver and gold 
from the heap leach pads is projected to continue through 2029. The projected mine life of 
the expanded operation may increase if additional mineral resources are defined and can be 
converted to mineral reserves. 

The expansion Project will increase total average annual silver production from 3.7 million 
ounces to 5.0 million ounces, while total average annual gold production will increase from an 
estimated 111,000 ounces to 148,000 ounces.  

The expansion Project also considers cost savings in replacing on site power generation with 
the installation of a high voltage power line approximately 110 km long to connect the 
Dolores operation with the main electrical grid in Chihuahua. The power line project will 
proceed regardless of the construction decision related to the expansion Project.  

The preliminary economic assessment is based on a mineral inventory of approximately 
80.3 million tonnes of oxide, sulphide, and mixed oxide/sulphide material sourced from a 
combination of open pit and underground mining and treated at a rate of 20,000 tonnes per 
day, including 14,400 tonnes per day from the existing crusher and 5,600 tonnes per day from 
the pulp agglomeration plant. The estimated after tax NPV of the incremental cash flow at an 
8% discount rate is $90.2 million, with an internal rate of return of 33% and a capital payback 
period of 1.7 years, using the Company's current reserve metal prices of $22 per ounce of 
silver and $1,300 per ounce of gold. Using metal prices of $19 per ounce of silver and $1,200 
per ounce of gold, the estimated after tax NPV of the incremental cash flow at an 8% discount 
is $65.6 million, with an internal rate of return of 27%. 

The initial capital requirements for the Project are estimated at $104.5 million, including 
$69.7 million for the pulp agglomeration plant and $34.8 million for the underground mine. 
Other capital projects that are required for the expansion to be successful, but which will 
proceed regardless of the construction decision related to the expansion Project, include an 
estimated $15.2 million for the power line installation, $11.6 million for leach pad 
construction, and $2.0 million for technical support to the operation. 

Sustaining capital costs are estimated at $170.3 million, including $60.4 million for the open 
pit mine, $48.4 million for the expanded heap leach pad operation, $42.8 million for the 
underground mine, $16.1 million for G&A, and $2.7 million for the pulp agglomeration plant. 
Many of these sustaining capital expenditures will be required regardless of the construction 
decision related to the expansion Project. The incremental sustaining capital expenditures 
associated with the Project total $51.5 million spread over the mine life. 

Operating costs in the open pit mine vary by depth and haul distance and are estimated to 
average $1.91 per tonne over the life of mine. Underground mining costs are estimated to 
average $34.94 per tonne. Heap leach costs with the benefit of grid power beginning in 
2016 and the additional volume from the pulp agglomeration plant will decline by 
approximately $2 per tonne. Pulp agglomeration costs with grid power and sharing the cost of 
the existing facilities that will be used for all material (Merrill-Crowe plant, refinery, and 
leaching system) are estimated at $15.20 per tonne. G&A costs for the mine and heap leach 
are estimated to be $1.99 per tonne and $3.01 per tonne for pulp agglomeration. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         162 of 171

Pan American has decided to defer making a construction decision for the next nine to 
12 months while it invests a modest amount of capital (estimated at $3.0 to $5.0 million) to 
proceed with additional studies, and continue the delineation of the underground accessible 
mineralization, in order to further de-risk the Project. This will allow Pan American more time 
to operate the mine at its optimum steady state, prior to introducing further investment and 
changes, and to continue to reconcile actual mining results with mineral reserve estimates to 
ensure the reliability of the mineral resource and reserve estimates, which form the basis for 
the expansion plan. The mine plan indicates that the highest incremental returns from the 
Project do not commence until 2017, when mining of higher grade material from the open pit 
begins, and as a consequence there is a built-in window of time to further de-risk the Project 
without sacrificing the economic returns, while monitoring the prices of silver and gold. 

 Environmental and community 25.4
The most significant environmental liabilities associated with the Dolores Property include 
surface disturbance and reclamation liabilities and issues related to the stability and 
containment system of heap leach Pad 1, which developed prior to Pan American's 
acquisition of the Property. Pan American has implemented additional contingency measures 
in and around leach pads 1 and 2, and has commenced the relocation of ore to allow 
rebuilding of Pad 1 for future operation. Pan American has also completed construction and is 
operating an extension to Pad 2, after application of rigorous quality control to both the 
design and construction of the facility, and has finalized construction of the first phase of Pad 
3.  

Only a small portion of the waste is potentially acid generating and no specific measures to 
manage waste or ore deposition are required. 

Pan American holds all necessary environmental and operating permits for the development 
and operation of the existing mine and is in compliance with Mexican law and international 
best practice environmental management. The mine has held "Clean Industry" Certification, 
awarded by Mexico's PROFEPA, since 2010.  

The Dolores staff community relations team implements an extensive program of community 
engagement activities including information sessions, infrastructure works, and educational 
and training programs for the local people, including small business training, which has 
resulted in the establishment of several important service providers to the mine. 

Due to the relative scale, the physical and organizational changes proposed in the expansion 
Project are unlikely to modify the existing environmental and social impacts at the Property. A 
permit modification for the Project would be lodged with the Mexican authorities and the 
processing of that permit application is not expected to create unmanageable time delays or 
risk to the realization of the Project.  

There are no known environmental or social issues that could materially impact the mine's 
ability to extract the mineral resources or mineral reserves or affect the viability of the 
expansion Project.

26 Recommendations 

 Project advancement 26.1
Pan American has decided to defer making a construction decision for the next nine to 
12 months while it invests a modest amount of capital (estimated at $3.0 to $5.0 million) to 
proceed with additional studies, and continue the delineation of the underground accessible 
mineralization, in order to further de-risk the Project. This will allow Pan American more time 
to operate the mine at its optimum steady state, prior to introducing further investment and 
changes, and to continue to reconcile actual mining results with mineral reserve estimates to 
ensure the reliability of the mineral resource and reserve estimates, which form the basis for 
the expansion plan. The mine plan indicates that the highest incremental returns from the 
Project do not commence until 2017, when mining of higher grade material from the open pit 
begins, and as a consequence there is a built-in window of time to further de-risk the Project 
without sacrificing the economic returns, while monitoring the prices of silver and gold. 

 Mineral resources and mineral reserves 26.2
No significant recommendations are made to improve the quality of the mineral resource 
estimate methodology. Pan American intends to continue with annual diamond drilling 
programmes and it is recommended to commence an additional infill drilling campaign to 
collect closer spaced drillhole information for updating the annual mineral reserve and 
resource estimates at Dolores. The cost of these programs will be covered by Pan American's 
usual annual drilling budget. Exploration diamond drilling is expected to be concentrated on 
defining the southern strike extent of the deposit, and in improving the confidence in the 
estimate at depth. Mineral resources will be updated annually to include additional diamond 
drilling undertaken during the year and to deplete for the previous years' mining. Reviews of 
the geological interpretation against grade control drilling will continue to be undertaken on a 
regular basis to verify the reliability of the resource estimate. 

 Mineral processing, metallurgical testing, and recovery methods 26.3
It is recommended to advance the preliminary economic assessment of the pulp 
agglomeration processing option to a pre-feasibility study level. This will require more 
detailed engineering, test work, and cost estimates to more accurately assess the technical 
feasibility and economic viability of the Project and to finalize the anticipated flow sheet. 
Some of the additional test work and studies necessary to advance the Project are discussed 
here. 

The secondary crushing equipment selected for this study has been sized in common with the 
existing crushing plant, which affords benefits in areas such as spares stockholding. If the run 
of mine feed size can be reduced by varying the blasting practices in the pit, then smaller and 
less expensive primary and secondary crushing equipment may be used. It is recommended 
to evaluate the benefits of varying the blasting practices in the pit in order to reduce the 
crushing equipment in the pulp agglomeration plant. 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         164 of 171

An opportunity lies in diverting the rod mill product to pre-leach holding tanks for early 
recovery of silver and gold prior to the thickening and filtration process. This option may be 
more attractive at higher metal prices. Additional studies are required to compare the 
additional capital and operating costs versus the advantage of improved kinetics.  

The authors recommend exploring opportunities to optimize the filtration equipment. There 
is an opportunity to use vacuum filters if medium grade material is added to the 
agglomeration drums to help control the moisture content while forming agglomerates. 
Diverting the crushed medium grade material to the agglomeration drum circuit would add 
flexibility to the high grade filter cake moisture content; however the system would be 
exposed to the variability in the moisture content of the crushed medium grade that changes 
with the seasons at the mine. It is recommended to quantify the peaks of maximum moisture 
content in the crushed medium grade material in order to evaluate the optimization of 
filtration equipment. 

Pan American is currently preparing samples for additional load permeability tests to assess 
the behaviour of the agglomerates under the current design conditions and height of the 
heap leach pads. Initial tests have confirmed the permeability with 20 kg of cement per tonne 
of high grade feed, and further testing with variable feed is recommended. An estimated 
$1 million would be required for the additional testing, the trade-offs, and to advance the 
engineering and cost estimates of the process area to a pre-feasibility study level.  

 Mining and financial 26.4
The authors recommend advancing the preliminary economic assessment of the pulp 
agglomeration processing option to a pre-feasibility study level, which will allow Pan 
American to update the recovery and cost parameters and to re-optimize the pit design used 
in the estimation of mineral reserves. The open pit mining plan used in the preliminary 
economic assessment has a slightly higher production rate than is currently achieved at the 
mine and additional open pit production is expected to be supplied by PEAL and by 
purchasing additional mine haulage trucks. Implementation of the pulp agglomeration 
processing option will require additional mining selectivity to separate the high grade portion 
of the deposit for grinding, which will require a manageable adjustment to current grade 
control practices, but is not likely to result in significant additional mining costs. 

The authors further recommend advancing the underground studies to a pre-feasibility study 
level in order to convert the underground mineral resources to mineral reserves. This will 
require pre-feasibility study level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models so that the 
value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a high level of 
confidence. Other studies will include advancing geotechnical test work and analyses, 
addressing the open pit and underground interactions and interfaces, and assessing the 
appropriating mining and back filling techniques. Work should also be done to understand the 
geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine. 

Given the high level of existing knowledge about the geology and ground conditions at the 
site, the amount of test work required for a pre-feasibility study for the underground mine is 
anticipated to be much less than at a greenfield project. Key items to be addressed for a 
future study include: 

August 2014                                                                                                                                                         165 of 171

• Additional studies of potential water inflow and water pumping requirements. 

• Improving the confidence of inferred resources which make up around two thirds of 
the underground inventory. The primary access decline for the underground could 
provide improved sites for diamond drilling to target structures beneath the pit. 

• Advancing the level of geotechnical knowledge, particularly where the underground 
and open pit operations will be in close proximity to each other. 

• Conducting a more detailed assessment of the cemented rock fill requirements and 
schedule.  

• Understanding the geothermal gradient and heat loading in the mine. 

• Identifying the permitting requirements for the addition of an underground 
operation.  

• Developing pre-feasibility level mine designs, plans, schedules, and cost models so 
that the value of the proposed underground operations can be assessed with a higher 
level of confidence. 

The estimated cost of pre-feasibility level underground mine designs, plans, schedules, and 
cost models is $450,000. Given a positive outcome of these studies, Pan American may 
conclude that the most effective method of assessing the geotechnical and geothermal 
conditions and to improve the confidence of the inferred resource will be to develop part of 
the primary access decline for underground and some of the planned level accesses prior to 
making a final production decision on the underground mine. 

A total of $2.7 million has been considered in the preliminary economic assessment for 
diamond drilling to improve the confidence of the mineral resource estimates in the region of 
the proposed underground mine. As the pulp agglomeration plant and the underground are 
expansions to the existing Dolores mine, Pan American may consider that upgrading only a 
portion of the inferred mineral resource prior to making a decision on construction of the 
pulp agglomeration plant and the underground mine may be an acceptable risk. 

 Environmental and community 26.5
At this time there are no significant recommendations to make with respect to environmental 
and community issues, until a construction decision has been reached and permit 
modifications are required.
