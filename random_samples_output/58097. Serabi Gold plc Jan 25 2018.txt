1 Summary 
This report was prepared as a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report 

(Technical Report) for Serabi Gold plc (Serabi or Company) by SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) on 

the Palito Mining Complex, which consists of the Palito and São Chico gold deposits in Pará State in 

central north Brazil. 

Serabi is a United Kingdom registered and domiciled gold mining and development company based 

in London, England. The Company's principal assets are its gold operations in the Tapajós region in 

the State of Para in Brazil, which it holds through its wholly owned subsidiaries Serabi Mineração S.A. 

and Gold Aura do Brasil Mineração Ltda (GOAB).  

1.1 Property Description and Ownership 
The Palito Mining Complex is comprised of the Palito and São Chico underground gold mines which 

are located in the Tapajós Mineral Province in the southeast part of the Itaituba Municipality in the 

west of Pará State in central north Brazil, near the eastern municipal boundary with the Novo 

Progresso Municipality. The Palito Mine lays some 4.5 km southwest of the village of Jardim do Ouro 

and approximately 15 km via road. The São Chico Mine lays some 30 km southwest of the Palito Mine. 

It is accessed by road from the Palito Mine along the Transgarimpeira Highway. 

The Palito Mine is a high grade, narrow vein underground mining operation that uses the shrinkage 

stoping method to extract gold and copper bearing ore. During the first six months of 2017, Serabi 

mined 53,883 t of ore from Palito at an average grade of 8.29 g/t Au (~300 t/d). 

The São Chico Mine is a 140 t/d high grade, narrow vein longhole stoping operation that mined 25,010 t 

of gold bearing ore during the first six months of 2017 at an average grade of 10.18 g/t Au (~140 t/d). 

Serabi operates a 500 t/d plant to process ore from both the Palito and São Chico mines. Palito ore is 

processed through a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, copper flotation and carbon-in-pulp 

(CIP) cyanidation of gold and silver values from the copper flotation tailing. The São Chico ore is 

processed in a separate grinding circuit that includes gravity concentration and intensive cyanide 

leaching of the gravity concentrate. During the first six months of 2017, the plant processed 90,568 t 

of ore at an average head grade of 6.69 g/t Au (including surface ore stockpiles and 4,042 t of retreated 

flotation tailings).  

The Palito Mining Complex is formed by 48,846 ha of tenements, including 1,150 ha of mining 

concession. In addition, there are 6,369 ha in mineral exploration license application and 1,416 ha in 

mining concession application resulting in a total area for this property of 56,631 ha. The mining 

concession and exploration licenses are issued to Serabi Mineração S.A., which is the wholly owned 

Brazilian subsidiary of Serabi Gold plc.  

Serabi initially acquired the surface rights to the immediate Palito Mine area through a purchase 

agreement with the existing artisanal miners (garimpeiros) entered into in 2002 and since that time 

has acquired from other garimpeiros and/or farmers additional parcels of land. 

In September 2010, Kenai Resources Ltd (Kenai) entered into an option agreement with Gold Anomaly 

Ltd (GOA) whereby Kenai had the option to purchase up to 75% of issued and outstanding shares of 

GOAB. GOA subsequently exercised this option. In December 2011, Kenai entered into a letter 

agreement with GOA to acquire GOAB and provide Kenai with full ownership of the São Chico project.

That transaction was completed, with GOAB becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Kenai. In July 

2013 Serabi completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Kenai, with GOAB becoming a 

wholly owned subsidiary of Serabi. 

1.2 Geology and Mineralization 
The Palito and São Chico gold deposits are located within the northern portion of the Tapajós-Parima 

Orogenic Belt (TPOB), a constituent of the Ventauri-Tapajós province of the Guaporé Shield. Formed 

between 2.5 and 1.8 Ga, the TPOB is a northwest oriented magmatic arc bound to the north by the 

Amazonian Basin and to the south by the Cachimbo Graben. Within the TPOB, the Tapajós Gold 

Province hosts numerous primary gold deposits over an area of approximately 300 kilometers (km) by 

350 km. 

Mineralization at the Palito and São Chico deposits is hosted in granite and granodiorite of the Paráuari 

suite. Mineralization at the Palito Mine is hosted within three granitoids and is intimately associated 

with northwest-southeast vertical to sub-vertical mesothermal quartz-chalcopyrite-pyrite veins and 

pyrite disseminations filling the brittle-ductile fault sets. At Palito, the nature of sulfide mineralization 

varies along the strike and plunge extents of the deposit. Pyrite and chalcopyrite dominate in the 

granites, whereas pyrrhotite and pyrite with lesser chalcopyrite are found in the granodiorite. Within 

the granodiorites, the pyrrhotite-pyrite sulfides tend to be lower grade due to lower chalcopyrite 

content. 

The Main Vein at São Chico strikes in a broadly west-northwest direction, dips steeply to the south, 

and ranges from approximately 1.0 to 3.9 meters (m) in apparent width. Mineralization extends 

approximately 140 m down dip and approximately 100 m along strike, and is open down dip and 

plunging to the west; to the east, mineralization is open for a minimum of 80 m along strike. The fault 

zone is variably mineralized, with both sinuous and regular quartz veining, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, 

chalcopyrite and electrum. 

Deposit Types 

Gold deposits in the Tapajós Gold Province can be broadly classified into three main types: 

 Mesozonal deposits; 
 Epizonal intrusion centered or intrusion related deposits; and 
 Alluvial, colluvial and supergene enriched saprolitic deposits. 

The mineralogy and textures of the deposits at the Palito Mining Complex is consistent with a model 

for an intrusion related mesothermal gold-copper mineralization. This relatively new classification of 

gold deposits is associated with granitic rocks and are best developed above and surrounding small, 

granitic intrusions. Mineralization styles can manifest as stockworks, breccia, skarns and lode style 

veins, and have a clear metal association zonation. 

1.3 Exploration Status  
Exploration work by Serabi on the Palito properties has been ongoing since 2003, with surface 

exploration, geological mapping, rock chip sampling, shallow auger drilling and diamond drilling 

programs completed. Since initial exploration, airborne, ground and downhole geophysical surveys 

have been executed to better constrain the known mineralization on the property and define new 

potential targets.

1.4 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Extensive metallurgical studies have been conducted on Palito and São Chico ores by respected 

commercial metallurgical laboratories to evaluate process options that included gravity concentration, 

flotation and cyanidation. The following general observations can be made regarding the metallurgical 

programs that have been conducted: 

 Both the Palito and São Chico ores are highly amenable to conventional processing 
techniques to recover the contained metal values; 

 Palito ore is processed using a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, copper flotation and 
CIP cyanidation of the copper flotation tailings; 

 São Chico ore is processed using a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, gravity 
concentration and cyanidation of both the gravity concentrate and the gravity tailing; 

 Plant performance on both Palito and São Chico ores has been similar to the results predicted 
from the metallurgical test programs; and 

 Serabi has tested and designed a new cyanide detoxification circuit to replace the existing 
circuit which has not performed as planned. It is expected that the new cyanide detoxification 

circuit using the industry-standard SO2/Air process will be operational during 2018. 

1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The Mineral Resource Statement presented herein represents the second and first mineral resource 

evaluation prepared for Serabi for the Palito and São Chico mines, respectively, in accordance with NI 

43-101. The mineral resource estimate prepared by Serabi for the Palito Mine considers core drilling 

and underground chip sampling by Serabi generated during the period mid-2002 to May 2017. For the 

São Chico Mine, the mineral resource estimate, also prepared by Serabi, considers core drilling and 

chip sampling by Serabi and previous operators during the period September 2011 to March 2017.  

The databases used to estimate mineral resources at Palito and São Chico were audited by SRK. 

SRK believes the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the 

boundaries for gold mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support mineral 

resource estimation. 

Serabi used a traditional polygonal estimation method in 2D sections to evaluate the mineral resources 

of both mines. AutoCAD® software was used to define the 2D longitudinal sections and the 

calculations were performed in Microsoft® Excel.  

SRK generated parallel geostatistically-based three-dimensional mineral resource models in Datamine 

Studio, using an ordinary kriging estimator for the main mineralized structures of São Chico and the 

G3 vein at Palito for mineral resource validation purposes. 

The polygonal quantities and grade estimates were reviewed by SRK to determine the portions of the 

Palito and São Chico mines having "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" from an 

underground mine, based on a cut-off grade (CoG) of 3.10 g/t gold at the Palito Mine and 2.85 g/t gold 

at the São Chico Mine, assuming a gold price of US$1,500 per ounce (oz), and metallurgical gold 

recovery of 91% and 95% respectively. The reporting parameters were selected based on production 

experience on the project. 

Condensed Mineral Resource Statements for the Palito and São Chico mines are tabulated in Table 

1-1 and Table 1-2 below respectively.

1.6 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
The Mineral Reserve Statement presented herein represents the first mineral reserve evaluation 

prepared for the Palito and São Chico mines, in accordance with NI 43-101. The mineral reserve 

estimates were prepared by Serabi and audited by SRK based on the Measured and Indicated mineral 

resource estimates presented in Section 1.5. 

Mineral resources are converted to mineral reserves using the assumptions, parameters and methods 

discussed in this report. Proven mineral reserves are reported within the Measured classification 

domain, and Probable mineral reserves are reported within the Indicated classification domain.  

Mineral reserves are reported for a total of 17 veins at the Palito Mine and one vein (the principal vein) 

at the São Chico Mine. Some Palito veins that contain Measured and Indicated mineral resources do 

not host mineral resource polygons that could be converted to mineral reserves. This is primarily 

because of the application of mining dilution and the use of a CoG for mineral reserves that is higher 

than the CoG used for mineral resources. 

At the Palito Mine, underground Mineral Reserves are inclusive of planned and unplanned (external) 

mining dilution and mining recovery and are reported at a CoG of 3.70 g/t Au assuming a gold price of 

US$1,250/oz, a 3.5:1 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate, and metallurgical recovery of 91%. 

Mineral Reserves for Palito surface stockpiles and flotation tailings are reported at a CoG of 1.95 g/t 

gold assuming a gold price of US$1,250/oz, a 3.5:1 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate, and 

metallurgical recovery of 78%. 

At the São Chico Mine, Mineral Reserves are reported at a CoG of 3.45 g/t gold assuming a gold price 

of US$1,250/oz, a 3.5:1 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar exchange rate, and metallurgical recovery of 

95%. 

Condensed Mineral Reserve Statements for the Palito and São Chico mines are tabulated in Table 

1-3 and Table 1-4 below respectively.

1.7 Mining Methods 
Palito Mine 

Mining of the narrow, near-vertical gold veins at the Palito Mine is undertaken using the shrinkage 

stoping method. During the first six months of 2017, Serabi mined 53,883 t of ore from Palito at an 

average grade of 8.29 g/t Au (~300 t/d).  



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

Shrinkage stoping blocks are defined on the lower level by horizontal development mining along the 

vein, and a vertical raise is then driven to the top of the stoping block and ladders are installed so that 

men and materials can access the stope on each subsequent lift as mining advances upward.  

Shrinkage stope mining progresses vertically beginning with the drilling of sub-vertical holes using 

hand-held pneumatic drills (stopers). The drill holes are loaded with explosives and the blasted ore is 

left in the stope except to the extent it is necessary to draw down the rock to leave an adequate 

distance between the working floor and the back. The ore left in the stope supports the walls and no 

installed ground support is typically required. Serabi extracts the broken ore via a series of crosscuts 

that are driven in waste from a footwall access. After a stope is mined to its full height, load-haul-dump 

(LHD) units are used to muck the remaining ore from the stope. The LHD units load haul trucks, which 

then transport the broken ore to the surface. 

São Chico Mine 

The São Chico Mine is a 140 t/d high grade, narrow vein longhole stoping operation that mined 25,010 t 

of gold bearing ore during the first six months of 2017 at an average grade of 10.18 g/t Au. Mining of 

the steeply dipping vein is by longitudinal longhole stoping methods using sublevels that are spaced 

at a nominal 15 m. Because structural backfill is not available and because mining takes place on 

multiple adjacent levels, rib and sill pillars are used to separate the ore blocks and maintain 

geotechnical stability. The top and bottom of each stope block is mined with horizontal development 

using a drift cross-section of 3.5 m high by 3.5 m wide. Longholes are drilled between levels and 

blasthole rings are fired in the direction of a conventionally driven slot raise that is mined on one end 

of the stope. Ore is mucked from the longhole stopes using LHDs. The LHDs load haul trucks, which 

then transport the broken ore to the surface. Once the ore reaches the surface, it is transported by 

road (approximately 30 km) from the São Chico Mine to the processing plant at the Palito site. 

Life of Mine Production Schedule 

The life of mine (LoM) production schedule based on Mineral Reserves produces an average annual 

processing rate that ranges between 264 t/d and 569 t/d (LoM average is 436 t/d). LoM primary 

development in waste (ramps, footwall accesses and raises) is 9,616 m for the Palito Mine and 838 m 

for the São Chico Mine. Ore mining in the Palito Mine continues until November 2021 whereas mining 

in the São Chico Mine ends in June 2019. 

Mine Equipment and Services 

The underground equipment fleet, which is owned and operated by Serabi, comprises a mix of older 

and newer units that are appropriately sized for operation in the relatively narrow stope widths in Palito 

and São Chico. Haulage from Sao Chico to Palito is performed by a haulage contractor using 

equipment that is owned, operated and maintained by the contractor. 

Mine dewatering is approximately 10 L/sec at the Palito Mine and approximately 17 L/sec at the São 

Chico Mine. At both mines, water is pumped through a system of staged centrifugal pumps to the 

portals at the top of the main ramp systems.  

Total mine airflow is approximately 5,950 m3 per minute (210,000 cfm) at the Palito Mine and 

approximately 1,060 m3 per minute (63,400 cfm) at the São Chico Mine. At both mines, fresh air is 

drawn into the mine through the main ramp system and intake raises, distributed throughout the mine, 

and then exhausted through a series of ventilation raises and adits that connect to the surface.

1.8 Recovery Methods 
Serabi operates a 500 t/d plant to process ore from both the Palito and São Chico mines. Palito ore is 

processed through a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, copper flotation and CIP cyanidation 

of gold and silver values from the copper flotation tailing. The São Chico ore is processed in a separate 

grinding circuit that includes gravity concentration and intensive cyanide leaching of the gravity 

concentrate. The São Chico gravity tailing is combined and processed with the Palito copper flotation 

tailing in the CIP cyanidation circuit. In addition to Palito and São Chico ore, old flotation tailing 

stockpiles, which contain about 2.6 to 3.6 g/t Au, are processed by direct feedi into the CIP circuit. 

Gold and silver values extracted in the CIP circuit are adsorbed onto activated carbon. The "loaded" 

carbon is then eluted to remove the adsorbed gold and silver values into an upgraded solution that 

flows through electrowinning cells to recover gold and silver as a cathodic precipitate, which is then 

fluxed and smelted to produce a final doré product.  

A summary of Serabi process plant production for the period of 2015 – 2017 (Q1) is shown in Table 

1-5. The following general observations can be made regarding plant production over this period: 

 Average reconciled Palito ore grade has declined from 8.51 g/t Au in 2015 to 6.54 g/t Au in 
2017 Q1; 

 Average annual gold recovery from Palito ore has been consistent at about 91% during this 
period; 

 Average reconciled São Chico ore grade has increased from 6.88 g/t Au in 2015 to 9.35 g/t 
Au in 2017 Q1;  

 Average annual gold recovery from São Chico has increased from 87.1% in 2015 to 95.8% in 
2017 Q1; 

 In addition to Palito and São Chico ore, old flotation tailing stockpiles, which contain about 2.6 
to 3.6 g/t Au, are processed by direct feed into the CIP circuit. Average annual gold recovery 

from the old flotation tailings has increased from 70.7% in 2015 to 84.4% in 2017 Q1.

Generally, reconciliation with measured plant feed grades has been poor. Since the beginning of 2016 

Palito reconciled gold grades have been consistently about 7% to 20% lower than the measured plant 

feed grades. During this same period, the São Chico reconciled ore grades have been about 2% to 

18% higher. In SRK's opinion there appears to be a bias in the ore feed sampling and/or the allocation 

of production between Palito and São Chico ores.

1.9 Project Infrastructure 
Property Access 

The Palito Mine is 4.5 km southwest of the village of Jardim do Ouro and approximately 15 km via 

road. Jardim do Ouro lies on the unsealed Transgarimpeira Highway some 30 km west-southwest of 

the town of Moraes de Almeida, which is located on the junction of the Transgarimpeira Highway and 

the BR 163 or Cuiabá – Santarém Federal Highway. Moraes de Almeida is approximately 300 km 

south south-east by road of the municipal capital and similarly named city of Itaituba. 

The São Chico Mine is 30 km southwest of the Palito Mine. It is accessed by road from the Palito Mine 

along the Transgarimpeira Highway. 

An airstrip, suitable for light planes, is currently fully operative at the Palito site. 

Underground Mine Access 

A 4.5 m high x 4.5 m wide ramp system (-12% gradient) provides access to the underground portions 

of the Palito and São Chico mines. The portal at the Palito Mine is located at elevation 235 meters 

above sea level (masl), and the deepest level is -50 masl. At São Chico, the portal is located at 

elevation 224 masl, and the deepest level is currently 10 masl.  

Palito Mine Camp 

There are full mining camps at the Palito and São Chico mines that consist of accommodation for 

personnel, kitchen and dining facilities, offices, warehouses, maintenance facilities, and guard houses 

at the entrances to the sites. Serabi provides a daily bus service for employees and contractors living 

in Jardim do Ouro and Moraes de Almeida. 

Fuel and Explosives Storage  

At Palito, fuel is stored on site in storage tanks with a capacity of 75,000 L of diesel. At São Chico, fuel 

is stored on site in storage tanks with a capacity of 35,000 L of diesel. Fuel storage tanks are located 

in a contained fuel storage area. There are explosives storage facilities at both operational sites 

located away from the main offices and other installations.  

Power 

At Palito, electrical power is provided from the local power grid though a 34.5 kV overland power line 

and by diesel generators to deliver approximately 1 million kWh/month. Electrical power from the grid 

normally costs about R$0.34/kWh, but during peak demand periods (6:30 to 9:30 pm Monday to 

Friday) grid power costs R$120-130/kWh. During these peak periods Serabi operates its own diesel 

generators to generate 380 V electrical power at an average cost of R$0.70/kWh. 

The power requirement at São Chico is approximately 594 kW (about 700 kVA), including the 

underground mine (437 kW), camp and village (94 kW) and surface support facilities (63 kW). The 

power is supplied by a diesel power house that includes three diesel gensets of 550 kVA (Maquigeral-

SDMO/Scania 47N) that operate in parallel with one as standby.

Water 

Water is an abundant resource in the area, and the current water supply system is not a limiting factor 

for operations at the Palito Mine or the São Chico Mine. The operation has a water supply system 

consisting of dams that contain water from underground workings, recycled process water after 

neutralization and decantation, and rain water. 

Tailings Disposal 

Mineral Reserves for both the Palito Mine and São Chico Mine will be processed by the Palito 

processing plant and tailings will be deposited into existing clay lined tailings disposal areas that are 

located adjacent to the processing plant. Tailings deposition will alternate between tailings disposal 

areas 16 and 17 from June 30, 2017 until the remaining capacity for those areas is exhausted. 

Thereafter, dry tailings will be removed from tailings disposal areas 16 and 17 and will be stacked on 

top of completed tailings disposal areas 14 and 15. Tailings disposal areas 16 and 17 will then be re-

used for tailings deposition until the remaining Mineral Reserves are processed. 

1.10 Environmental Studies and Permitting 
The 2006 environmental impact assessment (Estudo de Impacto Ambiental or EIA) and its respective 

report of environmental impact (Relatório de Impacto ao Meio Ambiente or RIMA) concluded that 

negative impacts to the environment would occur to various resources during construction and 

operations, but that these impacts could be effectively mitigated through the implementation of 

environmental protection measures and through proper monitoring. 

The Annual Environmental Information Reports (Relatorio de informação Ambiental Anual or RIAA) 

for the Palito and São Chico mines are presented each year to the Secretary of State for Environment 

and Sustainability (Sectretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente e Sustentabilidade or SEMAS) with 

respect to the socio-environmental actions carried out during the previous year, and cover any specific 

commitments made to the environmental agency by the operator, as well as those agreements and 

obligations between the operator and other stakeholders in the project.  

Documentation provided by Serabi and discussions during the site visit by SRK with site personnel 

indicate that groundwater and surface water quality (i.e., potential contamination by previous 

operators) may be an issue for consideration. The exact nature and source of these elevated 

concentrations is not currently known.  

At this time, these known environmental issues are not expected to materially impact Serabi's ability 

to extract the mineral resources or mineral reserves at either Palito or São Chico. 

Palito operates under a Plan of Environmental Control (Plano de Controle Ambiental or PCA) approved 

in 2008 by SEMAS. The PCA formalizes the environmental obligations of the operator that must be 

carried out in order to minimize impacts during operations. São Chico operates under a separate PCA.  

The Serabi operations have been authorized under a series of licenses, as presented in Table 20-1. 

For each license, related conditions and/or obligations are also listed, along with the respective status. 

Generally, Serabi has acquired all of the necessary permits to continue with operations; however, at 

Palito, Serabi continues to wait for SEMAS to act on the installation and operational licenses/permits 

for Dam 16 and Dam 17. No cease and desist orders or notices of violation have been issued by 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 11 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

SEMAS for this situation, though Serabi indicates that the agency routinely visits the operation and is 

aware of the conditions and operations at the site. 

Social and environmental programs have been developed in coordination with the communities 

deemed to be in the Directly Affected Area (ADA): Jardim do Ouro and São Chico; the Area of Direct 

Influence (AID), including the district of Moraes de Almeida; and the Area of Indirect Influence (AII), 

which includes the municipalities of Itaituba and Novo Progresso, from which Serabi obtains much of 

its labor, material supplies, and services. The programs have included: a dental clinic, improvements 

to local schools, provision of electricity and treated water, as well as planning for a new health clinic. 

The most recent conceptual mine closure plans for Palito and São Chico were developed at the end 

of 2016. Because Palito is currently operated as an underground mine, only a small amount of surface 

disturbance exists which requires concurrent reclamation during operations. The former open pit area, 

Alvo Senna, is no longer in operation. Reclamation of those pits is currently being carried out by Serabi, 

and is partially completed. São Chico is strictly an underground mine, with ore being sent to Palito for 

processing. No concurrent reclamation is planned for this location, with the exception of some early 

artisanal mining areas within the concession. 

Based on the current mine plans, Serabi estimates the reclamation and closure costs for the Palito 

Mine to be on the order of US$2,271,472, and for the São Chico Mine to be on the order of 

US$570,566. Given the size and extent of the facilities, the known environmental issues surrounding 

potential surface water and groundwater contamination, and the potential need for more robust 

engineered closure covers on the tailings impoundments and waste rock piles, it is SRK's opinion that 

the estimated closure costs are generally appropriate. However, the costs may be higher if there is a 

need for surface and groundwater remediation and compulsory post-closure monitoring ordered by 

SEMAS.

1.12 Economic Analysis 
Under NI 43-101 rules, producing issuers may exclude the information required in Section 22 

Economic Analysis on properties currently in production, unless the Technical Report includes a 

material expansion of current production. Serabi is a producing issuer, the Palito Mining Complex is 

currently in production, and a material expansion is not being planned. Serabi completed economic 

analysis for the Palito Mining Complex based on the Mineral Reserves stated herein. SRK reviewed 

Serabi's analysis and we have verified that the outcome is a positive cash flow that supports the 

statement of Mineral Reserves. 

1.13 Conclusions and Recommendations 

1.13.1 Geology and Mineral Resources 

The mineralogy and textures of the deposits at the Palito Mining Complex are consistent with a model 

for an intrusion related mesothermal gold-copper mineralization. This relatively new classification of 

gold deposits is associated with granitic rocks and are best developed above and surrounding small, 

granitic intrusions. Mineralization styles can manifest as stockworks, breccia, skarns and lode style 

veins, and have a clear metal association zonation. 

SRK is of the opinion that there is an opportunity to further improve the data collection, verification and 

mineral resource estimation methodologies at both the Palito and São Chico mines. Areas that could 

be reviewed include the following: 

 Upgrade the analytical assay QA/QC protocols; 
 Upgrade and maintain documented mine geological procedures for all mine geology tasks, to 

be consistently implemented; 

 Introduce a three dimensional geostatistically-based mineral resource estimation methodology 
to the operations; 

 Generate and maintain a three-dimensional lithology and structural model for both deposits 
based on surface drilling and underground mapping to facilitate mine planning and the 

identification of additional mineralization targets; 

 Provide geology and resource estimation modeling training to the resource geology staff at 
both operations;

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

 The mine geology staff would benefit from training on relevant aspects of the NI 43-101 
reporting guidelines; 

 Develop an automated grade control modeling system to enable more accurate mine planning 
processes; and 

 Implement a practical model to mine to mill reconciliation system. 

There are several highly prospective exploration targets on the Palito property which require further 

drill testing. These targets could potentially add to the mineral resource inventory. 

1.13.2 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The following conclusions and recommendations are made regarding the metallurgical programs that 

have been conducted: 

 Both the Palito and São Chico ores are highly amenable to conventional processing 
techniques to recover the contained metal values; 

 Plant performance on both Palito and São Chico ores has been similar to results predicted 
from the metallurgical test programs. During the period 2015 - 2017 (Q1):  

o Average annual gold recovery from Palito ore has been consistent at about 91%; 

o Average annual gold recovery from São Chico has increased from 87.1% to 95.8%;  

o Average annual gold recovery from the old flotation tailings has increased from 70.7% to 

84.4%;  

 Reconciliation with measured plant feed grades has been poor. Since the beginning of 2016 
Palito reconciled gold grades have been consistently about 7% to 20% lower than the 

measured plant feed grades. During this same period the São Chico reconciled ore grades 

have been about 2% to 18% higher. In SRK's opinion there appears to be a bias in the ore 

feed sampling and/or the allocation of production between Palito and São Chico ores. 

1.13.3 Mining and Mineral Reserves 

The following conclusions and recommendations are made regarding mining and mineral reserves: 

 The Mineral Reserves have been estimated by Serabi personnel in a manner that is 
reasonable and appropriate for the narrow vein orebodies at the Palito and São Chico mines. 

 The selected mining methods (shrinkage stoping at the Palito Mine and longhole stoping at 
the São Chico Mine) are appropriate. 

 The Mineral Reserves conform to CIM definitions and comply with all disclosure requirements 
for Mineral Reserves set out in NI 43-101. 

 Based on the current Mineral Reserves at the Palito Mine, a total of 541 kt grading 8.63 g/t Au 
will be mined over a mine life of approximately 4.5 years (July 2017 to November 2021). 

 Based on the current Mineral Reserves at the São Chico Mine, a total of 90 kt grading 8.43 g/t 
Au will be mined over a mine life of approximately two years (July 2017 to June 2019). 

 SRK recommends that Serabi investigate acquiring a cavity monitoring survey instrument to 
allow completed longhole stopes at São Chico to be accurately and safely surveyed. Accurate 

cavity surveys will allow Serabi to optimize drilling and blasting practices and will provide for 

a better understanding of overbreak/slough in the longhole stopes.

1.13.4 Environmental Studies and Permitting 

São Chico has initiated the process for revalidation of the current Operational License, which expired 

on December 22, 2017. Serabi appear to be in possession of, and in compliance with all relevant 

installation and operational licenses and/or permits. At Palito, Serabi continues to wait for SEMAS to 

act on the installation and operational licenses/permits for Dam 16 and Dam 17. No cease and desist 

orders or notices of violation have been issued by SEMAS for this situation, though Serabi indicates 

that the agency routinely visits the operation and is aware of the conditions and operations at the site.   

Potential environmental issues at the sites include: 

 Unfortunately, the site lacks appropriate background monitoring data to determine if some of 
the current surface water and groundwater exceedances are the result of historic mining, prior 

operators of the site, or the current operations. 

 The detection of cyanide in the downgradient monitoring well may suggest potential leakage 
from the clay-lined tailings impoundments, though Serabi is working toward improved 

groundwater sampling and analyses to increase their confidence in the previous results 

reported for the site. The installation of a cyanide destruction circuit will be complete in the first 

quarter of 2018 and is expected to mitigate this issue. 

 The limited surface water monitoring data from São Chico suggests potential impacts to 
Igarapé São Chico Creek, most notably by the elevated concentration of zinc, lead and 

manganese as compared to upgradient samples. 

 Neither Palito nor São Chico conducts geochemical characterization on tailings or waste rock 
materials which may be necessary to assess the current contamination issues as well as 

develop effective closure and potential remediation alternatives. 

Based on the assessment carried out on the documentation provided by Serabi and the site visit, SRK 

recommends the following additional work programs: 

 A more detailed surface water chemistry characterization and QA/QC implementation for both 
sites; 

 A more detailed groundwater chemistry characterization and QA/QC implementation for the 
Palito site; 

 Characterization of acid-rock drainage (ARD) potential and metal leaching (ML) potential for 
waste rock and tailings materials; 

 Based on the ARD/ML analyses, conduct an assessment of the potential for the underground 
workings to flood and cause localized groundwater contamination post closure; 

 Identify and sample suitable background study sites for both Palito and São Chico; 
 Prepare a more comprehensive site-wide water balance for the site, coupled with a 

geochemical mass balance exercise to evaluate the need for possible water treatment and 

concentration objectives prior to effluent discharge; and 

 Review and possibly update both Palito and São Chico mines closure plans and related costs 
(considering more robust cover systems and possible post-closure remediation requirements). 

1.13.5 Operating and Capital Costs 

The CoG calculation is based on recent actual operating costs and the calculated CoGs are 

reasonable and appropriate for both the Palito and São Chico mines. The sustaining capital costs as

used in Serabi's economic analysis for the Mineral Reserves are appropriate for the remaining life of 

each mine. SRK reviewed Serabi's economic analysis and we have verified that the outcome is a 

positive cash flow that supports the statement of Mineral Reserves.

3 Reliance on Other Experts 
The Consultant's opinion contained herein is based on information provided to the Consultants by 

Serabi throughout the course of the investigations. SRK has relied upon Serabi and the work of other 

consultants in the project areas in support of this Technical Report.  

The Consultants used their experience to determine if the information from previous reports was 

suitable for inclusion in this Technical Report and adjusted information that required amending. This 

report includes technical information, which required subsequent calculations to derive subtotals, totals 

and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently 

introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, the Consultants do not consider them to be material. 

SRK has relied upon Serabi for information regarding the surface land ownership/agreements as well 

as the mineral titles and their validity. Land titles and mineral rights for the project have not been 

independently reviewed by SRK and SRK did not seek an independent legal opinion for these items.

The Palito underground mine is centered on latitude 6.31˚S and longitude 55.79˚W and includes the 

adjacent Palito Mineral processing plant. The Palito Mine lays some 4.5 km southwest of the village of 

Jardim do Ouro and approximately 15 km via road. Jardim do Ouro lies on the Transgarimpeira 

Highway some 30 km west-southwest of the town of Moraes de Almeida, which is located on the 

junction of the Transgarimpeira Highway and the BR 163 or Cuiabá – Santarém Federal Highway.

The mining concession and exploration licenses are issued to Serabi Mineração S.A., which is the 

wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary of Serabi Gold plc.  

National Department of Mineral Production (Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral or "DNPM") 

legislation allows for the extension of up to three years for exploration licenses beyond the initial period 

of validity, through a process of report presentation and application for an extension. 

Exploration extension licenses cannot be renewed and must either be relinquished or can be upgraded 

to a mining concession through submission of an application including a mineral resource statement, 

economic assessment and mining plan and schedule. Mining concessions are valid until exhaustion 

of the resources or cessation of mining.

4.2.1 Surface Rights 

Palito 

Serabi initially acquired the surface rights to the immediate Palito Mine area through a purchase 

agreement with the existing "garimpeiros" (artisanal miners) entered into in 2002 and since that time 

has acquired from other garimpeiros and/or farmers additional parcels of land with the intention of 

securing the surface rights. It has also entered into agreements with other parties for access rights in 

return for making monthly rental payments in the amount of R$14,900. 

In total, these surface rights cover a total area of approximately 865 ha out of the total tenement holding 

of 56,631 ha. Of these surface rights, 367 ha lie within the mining concession. Serabi holds the land 

possession rights over the remaining 783 ha of the mining concession.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

São Chico 

Waldimiro Martins (WM) originally owned 100% of the São Chico property and in 2006 he entered into 

an agreement with Ademir and Jandira (A&J), whereby A&J would acquire 100% of the São Chico 

project. The terms of the agreement are not known. 

On November 13, 2006, Gold Anomaly Ltd (GOA) entered into an agreement with A&J whereby GOA 

could earn up to 60% of the São Chico property. GOA subsequently exercised this option. 

In 2008, WM initiated court action against A&J to rescind his agreement with A&J on certain grounds. 

On May 12, 2009 the Itaituba Court granted an injunction to suspend the agreement between WM and 

A&J. This injunction provisionally transferred total control of the São Chico property to WM. 

Following the injunction granted May 12, 2009, GOA subsequently entered into an agreement with 

WM to protect GOA's 60% interest in the São Chico property. Under the terms of this agreement Gold 

Aura do Brasil Mineração Ltda (GOAB), a wholly owned subsidiary of GOA, would own 100% of the 

mining rights associated with the São Chico property.  

In September 2010 Kenai Resources Ltd (Kenai) entered into an option agreement with GOA whereby 

Kenai had the option to purchase up to 75% of issued and outstanding shares of GOAB. In December 

2011, Kenai entered into a letter agreement with GOA to acquire GOAB and provide Kenai with full 

ownership of the São Chico project. That transaction was completed, with GOAB becoming a wholly 

owned subsidiary of Kenai. 

In July 2013 Serabi completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Kenai, with GOAB becoming 

a wholly owned subsidiary of Serabi. 

4.2.2 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 

CFEM Tax and Royalties 

Financial Compensation for Exploration of Mineral Resources (CFEM) is a federal tax levied on 

production from mining operations and is applicable to the Palito Mining Complex. CFEM taxable basis 

is the gross revenue less, indirect tax costs associated with the sale of mineral resources. The CFEM 

rates for gold, silver and copper, the primary products of the Palito Mining Complex, are 1.5%, 2.0% 

and 2.0% respectively. 

The São Chico property is subject to two royalty arrangements: 

 A&J have a 3% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) to a maximum of US$10 million; and  
 WM has a royalty of US$3.75/oz of gold production. 

Obligations Related to Exploration Licenses 

To retain the exploration licenses for the Palito Mining Complex, Serabi will need to make annual 

payments to the DNPM, which are presently calculated as R$133,079 as shown in Table 4-1. 

Additionally, there is one pending application for an exploration license (No. 850.495.2005) which, if 

approved, will require an annual payment of R$19,488.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

Obligations Related to Mining Licenses 

To maintain a mining license, Serabi must comply with the conditions set out by the DNPM in respect 

to annual reporting and environmental compliances, but no taxes are owed, except those incurred on 

production. 

4.3 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

4.3.1 Environmental Liabilities 

Environmental liabilities to which the property is subject include, but are not necessarily limited to: 

 Closure and reclamation liabilities associated with the cessation of mining and 
decommissioning and dismantling of all surface and underground facilities; 

 Serabi has not yet received the final approval/licensing from the regulatory agency for the 
current tailings dam facilities, although the application documentation has been submitted;  

 Potential groundwater impacts and possible remediation requirements associated with the 
detection of cyanide in monitoring well PZ-01; and 

 Potential surface water contamination from mining facilities as indicated by elevated 
constituent concentrations (exact sources currently unknown). 

Additional discussion on these issues is provided in Section 20. 

4.3.2 Required Permitting 

This section discusses the general permits that must be acquired to conduct mining and processing at 

the Palito and São Chico mines. Additional information on the permits and licenses already obtained 

and their status is provided in Section 20. 

Mining Titles 

After the mining concession is granted by the National Department of Mineral Production 

(Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral or DNPM), the holder must: 

 Submit a report on all mining and processing activities (RAL or "Relatorio Anual de Lavra") for 
the previous year, including, but not limited to quantities of materials mined and processed; 

and 

 Pay a monthly "royalty" on mining activities (Compensação Financeira pela Exploração de 
Recursos Minerais or CFEM) which is shared by federal, state, and municipal jurisdictions, 

depending on the mineral resource in the respective territory.  

Any necessary modifications to the approved mine plan need to be submitted to the DNPM for 

approval. 

Environmental Permitting 

The Brazilian National Environmental Policy, established on the August 31, 1981 by Federal Law # 

6.938, requires all potentially or effectively polluting activities to have an environmental license. 

Applicable rules regarding the licensing procedure were established by resolution #237 of the National 

Council of the Environment (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente or CONAMA) on 19th December 

1997. The licensing procedure allows the issuing agency to determine the conditions, limits and 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 25 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

measures for the control and use of natural resources, and permits the installation and implementation 

of a project. 

The license can be issued by either a federal, state or municipal agency. Authority to issue a license 

is based on the extent of likely impacts and generally follows the rules established by CONAMA's 

Resolution # 237/97 listed below: 

 Federal entities are responsible for licensing activities that may cause national or regional 
environment impact (more than two federal States); 

 State entities and the Federal District Entity (the area covered by the capital of Brazil, Brasilia) 
are responsible for activities that may cause State environment impact; and 

 Municipal entities are responsible for licensing activities that may cause low local environment 
impact (within city limits). 

During exploration, the Project proponent generally initiates the environmental licensing process, for 

which they must have the following: 

 Vegetation Suppression (supressão vegetal); and 
 Environmental Authorization (autorização ambiental de funcionamento). 

These preliminary authorizations are issued by the Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainability 

in the State of Pará (Secretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente e Sustentabilidade or SEMAS). The 

regulatory framework sets out a three-step environmental licensing process that is conceptually 

equivalent between SEMAS and the federal Institute of the Environment (Instituto do Meio Ambiente 

or IMA) (although having different names): 

 Preliminary License or Licença Prévia (LP) – establishes the environmental feasibility and 
viability of the project, and approves the concept and location. In order to obtain this license, 

the regulatory authority must approve the baseline studies, environmental impact assessment 

(Estudo de Impacto Ambiental or EIA), and environmental impact report (Relatório de Impacto 

Ambiental or RIMA), and hold formal public hearing(s). The LP established the conditions and 

agreements for environmental management, mitigation, reclamation and compensation(s) for 

the project. Negative impacts identified in the EIA/RIMA, may require some form of 

compensation according to Brazilian Law #9.985/2000, which introduced the System of 

Conservation Units and determined environmental compensation standards; 

 Installation License or Licença de Instalação (LI) – approves the basic engineering and 
authorizes the project proponent to implement the project (subject to compliance with specified 

conditions). In order to obtain this license, the regulatory authority must approve the 

Environmental Control Plan (Plano de Controle Ambiental or PCA). Requirements for 

reclamation and closure are also defined through the approval of the Reclamation Plan (Plano 

de Recuperação de Áreas Degradadas or PRAD). This license must be obtained prior to the 

commencement of construction activities. Also at this stage, the project proponent must 

identify required Legal Reserves. The size of the Legal Reserve depends on state regulation. 

Each Legal Reserve shall be validated by the Rural Environmental Cadastre (Cadastro 

Ambiental Rural or CAR) or at the Real Estate Notary Office as property of the entrepreneur, 

according to Federal Law #12.651/2012; and 

 Operations License or Licença de Operação (LO) – confirms that the conditions stipulated 
in the LI have been met (including evidence that all the environmental programs and control 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 26 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

systems were duly installed), and authorizes the commencement of operations. The project 

proponent will be required to apply for the LO every four to eight years (COPAM 17 edit from 

1996), although in practice the licensing body has discretion to invoke a more regular renewal 

regime At each renewal time, the operator must provide a detailed report on environmental 

performance, with particular attention to concurrent reclamation and implementation of the 

PRAD. 

As noted above, for activities where the environmental impact may be considered significant, an 

environmental impact assessment (the EIA or RIMA in Brazil) must be undertaken and presented to 

the appropriate licensing agency (federal, state, or municipal). In addition, the applicable government 

agency and the project owner are required to publish all related information and provide for public 

hearings, if required, according to the regulation of each location. The content of EIA-RIMAs is similar 

to that required under the Equator Principles and the IFC Performance Standards, and is agreed by 

the relevant regulatory authorities prior to undertaking the work. Modification to the mine plan may 

require re-issuance of the LI and/or LO, depending on the magnitude of the proposed changes. 

One of the remaining important authorizations issued to a mining operation by the Brazilian Institute 

of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos 

Recursos Naturais Renováveis or IBAMA), which is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment's 

administrative arm, is the Authorization for Vegetation Suppression (Autorização para Supressão 

Vegetal or ASV), which enables the operator to remove vegetation and forest resources and alter the 

designated land uses in the area of the mine. 

The responsibility to protect the environment is shared between the federal, state, and municipal 

authorities (Brazilian Federal Constitution - CF/1988, Article #24; Complementary Law #140/2011). 

Competence for environmental licensing could be delegated to municipalities through an agreement 

to impact local environmental activities. 

The prescription for recovery of the impacted areas from mineral resource exploitation can be found 

in the Brazilian Constitution, 1988, Article #225, § 2, where recovery should be compatible with the 

technical solution required by the environmental agency. 

The DNPM regulates the mine closure requirements by the Mining Regulation Standards (Normas 

Reguladoras de Mineração or NRM), including the environmental ones. Specifically, NRM #20 deals 

with mine closure. 

4.3.3 Required Permits and Status 

In Brazil, mineral resources are federal property, regulated by the DNPM. The DNPM grants both 

Utilization Guidelines and Mining Concessions. The first is temporary and only valid when coupled with 

an environmental license and also limits the amount of material that can be mined. DNPM issues 

Exploitation Permits based on technical criteria, which conditionally authorizes the extraction of 

minerals in a titled concession area. Serabi has been granted a Mining Concession for the exploitation 

of the Palito Mine (DNPM #850175/2003) and Utilization Guidelines for the exploration and limited 

exploitation of the São Chico Mine (DNPM #650007/1998). 

Environmental considerations, however, may also be administered by state and local agencies in 

accordance with the prevailing interest, for example relating to specific environmental characteristics.

At the operational stage, the exploration license holders may require the following environmental 

permits: 

 Vegetation Suppression; 
 Surface Water Uptake Authorization; 
 Groundwater Uptake Authorization; 
 Environmental Authorization; and/or 
 Operation License (granted after Preliminary and Installation Licenses). 

The authorizing acts are detailed in Section 20.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
Palito Mine 

The Palito Mine lies at an elevation of 260 masl. Local physiography consists of a rugged topography 

forming hills and steep sided valleys in the immediate area, and more subdued undulating hills and 

valleys in the surrounding region. There are numerous creeks (Igarapés) draining the incised 

topography in the area, all of which drain into the Rio Novo and Jamanxim Rivers.  

The majority of the environment is covered by tropical forest typical of the Amazon region, however 

north and west of the Palito Mine; the forest has been felled to create pastures for the grazing of 

livestock along the Transgarimpeira Road. 

Many of the drainages radiating away from the Palito Mine have been worked intensely in the 1980's 

by the garimpeiros resulting in manmade swamps, permanent wetlands and old forest destruction. 

São Chico Mine 

The São Chico property is characterized by low rolling hills with an average elevation of approximately 

240 masl. Much of the area has been cleared for grazing of livestock, but the remainder is covered by 

dense tropical forest. São Chico is located in a shallow valley which broadens to the east.  

5.2 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property 
The Palito Mine lays some 4.5 km southwest of the village of Jardim do Ouro and approximately 15 km 

via unsealed road. Jardim do Ouro lies on the Transgarimpeira Highway some 30 km west-southwest 

of the town of Moraes de Almeida, which is located on the junction of the Transgarimpeira Highway 

and the BR 163 or Cuiabá – Santarém Federal Highway. Moraes de Almeida is approximately 300 km 

south south-east by road of the municipal capital and similarly named city of Itaituba. 

The São Chico Mine lays some 30 km southwest of the Palito Mine. It is accessed by road from the 

Palito Mine along the Transgarimpeira Highway. 

An airstrip suitable for light planes is currently fully operative at the Palito site. 

5.3 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
The local climate has two well defined seasons, the rainy season from December to June and the dry 

season from June to December. Regional rainfall averages around 1,400 mm/y although this now 

fluctuates greatly due to the deforestation effect of local farming. 

The temperature does not vary significantly ranging between 24°C and 33°C, with an average of 

around 26°C. Relative humidity ranges from 70% to 80% depending on the season. Mining and 

processing operations are conducted year-round. 

5.4 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 
Surface rights are discussed in Section 4.2.1.

5.5 Infrastructure Availability and Sources 

5.5.1 Power 

Grid electricity is sourced from the neighboring municipality of Novo Progresso 135 km away, and 

brought to site via a spur line. Backup power and peaking power is supplied by a fleet of onsite diesel 

fired generators.  

5.5.2 Water 

Water is in abundance locally and is sourced from small reservoirs and dams constructed on site for 

industrial purposes and from water wells for potable water requirements. 

5.5.3 Personnel 

Labor employed by the project is preferentially sourced from the local towns and villages, within the 

state of Pará. Other more job specific professionals unavailable in Pará are sourced preferentially from 

within Brazil. 

5.5.4 Tailings Disposal Areas 

Ore from both the Palito and São Chico mines is processed by the Palito processing plant and tailings 

are deposited into existing clay lined tailings disposal areas that are located adjacent to the processing 

plant. 

5.5.5 Waste Rock Disposal Areas 

Waste rock from development mining at Palito and São Chico is stored underground as stope backfill 

or placed in waste rock storage facilities located adjacent to the mine portals. 

5.5.6 Processing Plant Site 

The processing plant is located at the Palito site as shown in Figure 5-1, which also shows the locations 

of the tailings and waste rock disposal areas.

6 History 
The Palito deposit is located in the eastern portion of the Tapajós Mineral Province where the presence 

of gold has been reported as early as 1747 from the Colonial Portuguese era. Gold production in the 

Tapajós commenced in the mid-20th century via artisanal miners (garimpeiros) reaching a peak in the 

1970's and 1980's with estimated production of between 15 to 30 t/y, from over 500,000 garimpeiros.  

Total historical production from the Tapajós is estimated at some 15 to 30 Moz as reported by the 

Serviço Geológico do Brasil (CPRM). However, accurate reports do not exist. Gold mining in the Palito 

Mining Complex area was initiated by garimpeiros during the 1970's, who typically worked alluvial and 

colluvial gold sources up stream until they came upon the residual source. Generally, the garimpeiros 

worked the residual mineralized saprolite profile containing free primary and secondary gold. In 

circumstances where extremely high grade was encountered in fresh rock, the garimpeiros sunk shafts 

and mined the vein underground by gallery development. The mining method employed traditionally 

was by hand and hydraulic mining in the saprolite, using basic gravity separation and occasionally 

mercury amalgamation. In the high grade, vein material extracted from fresh rock or deeper open 

casts, the material was crushed and then gravity separated and/or mercury amalgamated. 

6.1 Prior Ownership and Ownership Changes 
Palito Mine 

Modern exploration was initiated in 1994 by RTDM, which conducted surface geochemical sampling, 

auger drilling, ground and airborne geophysics, and diamond drilling in the Palito Mine area. 

The founders of Serabi commenced operating in Brazil in 1999, with the objective of acquiring, 

evaluating and mining hard rock gold deposits previously unknown or technically too difficult for the 

garimpeiros to exploit. 

Having evaluated several opportunities, the group acquired the Palito Mine in 2001, forming the basis 

for Serabi. In 2002, Serabi purchased RTDM's historical Tapajós exploration database and negotiated 

access to RTDM's exploration drill core library, following RTDM's decision to withdraw from the 

Tapajós Province. 

Serabi initially acquired the surface rights to the immediate Palito Mine area through a purchase 

agreement with the existing garimpeiros entered into in 2002 and since that time has acquired from 

other garimpeiros and/or farmers additional parcels of land with the intention of securing the surface 

rights. It has also entered into agreements with other parties for access rights in return for making 

monthly rental payments. 

São Chico Mine 

Waldimiro Martins (WM) originally owned 100% of the São Chico property and in 2006 he entered into 

an agreement with A&J, whereby A&J would acquire 100% of the São Chico project. The terms of the 

agreement are not known. 

On November 13, 2006, GOA entered into an agreement with A&J whereby GOA could earn up to 

60% of the São Chico property. GOA subsequently exercised this option. 

In 2008, WM initiated court action against A&J to rescind his agreement with A&J on certain grounds.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

On May 12, 2009 the Itaituba Court granted an injunction to suspend the agreement between WM and 

A&J. This injunction provisionally transferred total control of the São Chico property to WM. 

Following the injunction granted May 12, 2009, GOA subsequently entered into an agreement with 

WM to protect GOA's 60% interest in the São Chico property. Under the terms of this agreement 

GOAB, a wholly owned subsidiary of GOA, would own 100% of the mining rights associated with the 

São Chico property.  

In September 2010 Kenai entered into an option agreement with GOA whereby Kenai had the option 

to purchase up to 75% of issued and outstanding shares of GOAB. In December 2011, Kenai entered 

into a letter agreement with GOA to acquire GOAB and provide Kenai with full ownership of the São 

Chico project. That transaction was completed, with GOAB becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of 

Kenai. 

In July 2013 Serabi completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Kenai, with GOAB becoming 

a wholly owned subsidiary of Serabi. 

6.2 Exploration and Development Results of Previous Owners 
Exploration results, including the results of previous owners are described in Section 9 herein. Small 

scale artisanal miners have intermittently attempted to work the Palito and São Chico areas but are 

no longer active and no historical production figures are available. There was some re-working of 

tailings by villagers at São Chico but no records are known to exist. 

6.3 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 
SRK has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates for the Palito and São Chico mines 

as current Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates and Serabi is not treating historical 

estimates as current Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates. 

6.4 Historic Production 
Historic production for the Palito Mining Complex under Serabi's ownership is summarized in Table 6-

1. There was no production during the 2011 – 2013 period because the operation was placed on care 

and maintenance.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 
Northern Brazil is dominated by the Precambrian Amazonian Craton, which is divided into the Guiana 

and Guaporé shields. The Amazon Basin separates the Guiana and Guaporé shields, while 

Neoproterozoic orogenic belts bound them. Orogenic movements that took place during the Trans 

Amazonian Orogeny between 2.2 and 1.9 billion years (Ga) are thought to have initiated the 

development of major northwest-southeast structures and crustal lineaments that acted as controls on 

mineralization until the Late Mesozoic. Following the break-up of Pangaea, Amazonia entered a 

prolonged period of quiescence and weathering, characterized by widespread laterite and saprolite 

development across much of the craton. 

The Palito and São Chico gold deposits are located within the northern portion of the Tapajós-Parima 

Orogenic Belt (TPOB), a constituent of the Ventauri-Tapajós province of the Guaporé Shield. Formed 

between 2.5 and 1.8 Ga, the TPOB is a northwest oriented magmatic arc bound to the north by the 

Amazonian Basin and to the south by the Cachimbo Graben. Within the TPOB, the Tapajós Gold 

Province hosts numerous primary gold deposits over an area of approximately 300 km by 350 km. 

The Tapajós Province represents a tectonically controlled geological evolution over 140 million years 

(Ma) during the Orosirian Period of the Paleoproterozoic Era, comprising four plutonic events 

(Coutinho et al., 2000). Two main units form the basement: the 2.4 to 2.0 Ga Paleoproterozoic Cuiú-

Cuiú metamorphic suite and the >2.1 Ga Jacareacanga metamorphic suite. The Jacareacanga suite 

is a sedimentary-volcanic sequence, metamorphosed to a regional greenschist facies, with units of 

sericite and chlorite schists and rare banded iron formations. The Cuiú-Cuiú suite forms the basement 

for the Palito area and is comprised of orthogneisses of dioritic to granodioritic composition, locally 

mylonitized, deformed tonalitic granitoids, and enclaves or rafts of amphibolites. Both suites are 

intruded by monzogranites of the 2000 – 1900 Ma Paráuari suite, tonalites, diorites and granodiorites 

of the 1907 – 1898 Ma Tropas suite, and granites and granodiorites of the 1893 – 1853 Ma Creporizão 

suite. These three intrusive suites are considered to have calc-alkaline affiliations and may be 

considered remnants of a magmatic back arc system interpreted for the region. 

Coeval ryolites, dacites and andesites of the 1900 – 1853 Ma Bom Jardim and Salustiano Formations 

and volcaniclastics of the 1893 – 1853 Ma Aruri Formation cut through all of the older units. The post-

collisional 1882 – 1870 Ma Maloquinha Granite suite intrudes throughout the Tapajós Province and is 

associated with the strong extensional episode, pre-dating deposition of the Uatumã Volcanics (Iriri 

Group, Aruri Formation and Salustiano Formation). The Maloquinha Granites are considered to be the 

deeper intrusive phase of the Uatumã Volcanics and the source of gold mineralization in the Tapajós 

Province. 

Younger sedimentary rocks cover the Maloquinha and Uatumã suites along a northwest-southeast 

trending feature in the central and western portions of the Tapajós Province. 

Mineralization at the Palito and São Chico deposits is hosted in granite and granodiorite of the Paráuari 

suite (Figure 7-1).

7.2 Property Geology 

7.2.1 Palito Mine 

In the vicinity of the Palito Mine, three types of alkaline granitoids dominate; the Rio Novo Granite, the 

Palito Granite, and the Fofoquinha Granodiorite. The Rio Novo Granite is found to the east of the main 

Palito Mine area and forms a sharp contact against the Palito Granite on its western margin. To the 

west of the immediate Palito Mine area, the Palito Granite has a chilled contact with the Fofoquinha 

Granodiorite. Feldspar porphyritic dykes and sills of dacite composition intrude the granitoids, while 

gabbroic bodies termed the Rio Novo Gabbro are restricted to within the Fofoquinha unit.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

The Rio Novo Granite is a medium grained, porphyritic quartz-plagioclase granite, varying in color from 

pink-orange to red-green depending on the degree of hydrothermal alteration. Granophyric textures 

are common along with lesser developed miarolitic cavities, silicified broken and brecciated zones 

which are more intensely hydrothermally and propilitically altered, giving the rock a grey to green 

coloration. Zones intensely broken by brittle faulting are also common, typically associated with breccia 

and chlorite and fluorite veins. Xenoliths of Fofoquinha Granite are found within the Rio Novo Granite, 

indicating it is a later phase. The unit cuts the older Paráuari suite and is overlain by volcanics of the 

Iriri Group. 

The Palito Granite is medium grained, inequigranular, with local finer grained variations at contact 

zones with the surrounding granites. Potassic alteration is pervasive and the granite has an intense 

red coloration. Miarolitic cavities, crystalline quartz and poorly developed granophyric textures are 

occasionally present. In near surface exposures, the granite is strongly hydrothermalized and shows 

characteristics of differential weathering, reflecting features relating to phased emplacement or 

magmatic flow. The Palito Granite hosts the majority of mineralized structures within the Palito Mine. 

The Fofoquinha Granodiorite is medium to coarse grained, inequigranular to porphyritic in texture, with 

15% to 35% mafic mineral content of primarily amphibole and iron oxides. The granodiorite has been 

observed to be enriched in magnetite, which disappears when the rock shows evidence of potassic 

metasomatism and is likely related to the intrusion of the Rio Novo or Palito granites. The color of the 

granodiorite varies from grey to green-grey, and coarse plagioclase crystals show intense zonation. 

The Rio Novo Gabbro occurs as rounded intrusions varying from 100 to 500 m in diameter. Local 

brecciation and xenoliths of the Fofoquinha Granodiorite within the unit indicates post emplacement of 

the gabbro. Brittle faulting and hydrothermal alteration are also observed to have affected the Rio Novo 

Gabbro. 

Sub-volcanic dykes are granitic in composition, with porphyritic texture and a very fine to aphanitic 

matrix. Miarolitic cavities are common, with small concentrations of mafic minerals and sulfides. The 

dykes are grey-pink to light brown in color, and have been hydrothermally altered by potassic 

metasomatism, propylitization, sericitization and sulfidization. They are recognized as cutting all 

lithologies on the property and rarely exceed 1 m in width, but locally have been recorded up to 30 m 

wide. 

The mineralized structures at the Palito deposit are generally dark grey-green intensely sericite-silica-

pyrite-chalcopyrite +/- chlorite, carbonate, pyrrhotite, sphalerite altered granite that are often 

unrecognizable as granitoid protoliths. The hydrothermal alteration forms the lower-grade 

mineralization selvedges and the host to the higher-grade quartz-sulfide and massive sulfide zones. 

Distal from the structures and intensely hydrothermally altered zones, the granite hosts display strong 

potassic alteration, grading into the regional scale background potassic alteration within 1 to 5 m of 

the mineralized structure. Alteration zones are found to range from decimeters to meters in width. 

7.2.2 São Chico Mine 

Outcrop at the São Chico deposit is poor due to widespread laterite development and alluvium, with 

the average depth to fresh bedrock approximately 10 to 20 m below the surface. The cover comprises 

a 1 to 3 m red, lateritic top soil, with a lower boundary marked by a pisolith of quartz fragments and 

ferruginous pebbles. Saprolitic bedrock underlies the laterite and gradually transitions to the fresh host 

rock.

Host rocks of gold mineralization at São Chico are composed of medium-grained, leucocratic, feldspar 

phyric granodiorite and diorite of the Paráuari suite. Mineralization is hosted in west-northwest 

trending, steeply south dipping fault zones with a shear component. The mineralized faults have been 

offset by north-northeast trending normal faults with a dextral lateral displacement. 

The location of both the Palito and São Chico properties in relation to a simplified local geological plan 

is provided in Figure 7-2.

7.3 Structural Setting 
Regional structural analysis of the Tapajós Province has identified two compressive deformation 

regimes. The first compressive event, with peak deformation at approximately 1.96 Ga, resulted in the 

development of ductile and brittle-ductile regimes, while the second event at 1.88 Ga resulted in brittle 

deformation. Together, these events resulted in major north-south, northwest-southeast and east-west 

lineament sets. The geometry of the lineaments and structures are compatible with a combination of 

Riedel fracturing and strike-slip fault systems, where the principle vector of compression is oriented in 

an east-west and east northeast – west southwest direction. The Palito Mining Complex lies on the 

northwest-southeast trending Tocantinzinho Trend, which is the major controlling structural feature in 

the Tapajos region.

In October 2011, Serabi commissioned the services of Dr. Brett Davis of Olinda Gold to perform a 

structural review of the Palito Mining Complex. The following observations were made from his 

investigation: 

 The project area is strongly dissected by several fault sets; prevalent faults strike subparallel 
to pervasively developed deformation fabrics. The pervasively developed fabrics are 

interpreted as forming coeval with similarly oriented faults, with northeast-southwest faults 

broadly parallel to northeast-southwest fabrics and northwest-southeast faults broadly parallel 

to northwest-southeast fabrics 

 The northeast-southwest fault set is interpreted as forming synchronous with east-west striking 
fault sets. The east-west faults generally have a shorter strike length and terminate against 

the northeast-southwest fault, and are interpreted as strain accommodation features that link 

the northeast-southwest faults 

 The northeast-southwest and east-west fault sets are interpreted as forming synchronous with 
granite emplacement; the event that produced the northeast-southwest structures is 

considered to be the main episode of deformation and pluton emplacement, and likely 

responsible for gold-bearing hydrothermal systems. The faults display curved geometries 

around the margins of the plutons and cut the intrusions 

 Zones of contact metamorphism are spatially associated with all intrusions. The ovoid shape 
of the plutons is interpreted to be a product of emplacement at levels suitable for ductile fabric 

formation, with the long axes of the pluton conforming to northwest-southeast faults which 

represent long-lived basement structures. All fault and fabric populations cross-cut the plutons 

 An area of potential exploration interest was found at the southern extent of one of the ovoid 
plutons. The area hosts a number of fault intersections and is interpreted as a zone of low 

mean stress that may have developed during deformation synchronous with gold deposition. 

7.4 Significant Mineralized Zones 

7.4.1 Palito Mine 

The mineralization control found on the Palito property is related to the schematic mega-system of 

strike-slip faulting and Riedel fracture systems of the Tapajós Province as described by the CPRM 

(2008). The mineralized veins appear related to the intersection of "Y" and "P" and/or "R" (sinistral 

strike-slip) faulting on 305° and 315° and/or 295° orientations respectively within "R" 070° trending 

structural corridors. 

Mineralization at the Palito Mine is hosted within all three granitoids encountered in the immediate 

vicinity and is intimately associated with northwest-southeast vertical to sub-vertical mesothermal 

quartz-chalcopyrite-pyrite veins and pyrite disseminations filling the brittle-ductile fault sets. The 

principle vein system has a strike length over 900 m, with mineralized veins typically averaging 

approximately 1 m in width with grades between 15 and 30 g/t. Grades in excess of this are associated 

with semi-massive chalcopyrite-pyrite blowouts within the quartz veins, typically on the intersections 

of "Y" or "P" and "R" veins. 

Gold mineralization associated with quartz and hydrothermal alteration assemblages is reported in all 

fracture orientations of the Riedel system, and are dominated by fractures oblique to the principle 

strike-slip shear orientation.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

Gold mineralization occurs within pyrite and chalcopyrite (Figure 7-3) associated with sphalerite, 

argentite and tellurobismuthite/tetradymite. Gold occurs as fine grains of 10 to 15 microns in size, with 

the highest gold grade typically found in zones of hydraulic brecciation, where the alteration zone, 

sulfides and vein quartz show multiple stages of reactivation. In the granodiorite, the dominant sulfide 

is pyrrhotite with lesser pyrite and chalcopyrite compared to the granites, typically resulting in 

pyrrhotite-pyrite sulfides with lower gold grade. Sulfides occur as segregates in the quartz veins, as 

disseminations within the grey hydrothermal alteration selvedges, or as decimeter to meter wide 

massive sulfide veins. 

The nature of sulfide mineralization varies along the strike and plunge extends of the deposit. Pyrite 

and chalcopyrite dominate in the granites, whereas pyrrhotite and pyrite with lesser chalcopyrite are 

found in the granodiorite. Within the granodiorites, the pyrrhotite-pyrite sulfides tend to be lower grade 

due to lower chalcopyrite content, and is likely a result of greater mafic mineral content in the 

granodiorite affecting the paragenesis of sulfide deposition. 

The hydrothermal alteration of the host rocks is strongly alkaline and has resulted in potassification 

and ferruginization, accentuating the original alkaline character of the host rocks and resulting in 

intense silicification. Hydrothermal alteration associated with mineralization is intense sericitization and 

chloritization, where intense potassic alteration has resulted in the original lithotype no longer being 

compositionally or texturally identifiable. The alteration zone appears as a dark grey rock formed of 

relict quartz crystals of 0.5 to 1 mm in a groundmass of feldspar pseudomorphs of sericite, clay 

minerals and rare epidote and carbonate. Chlorite occurs as infill of shears and veinlets, as rare 

aggregated crystal masses, and occasionally intercalated with biotite with inclusions of zircon, apatite 

and prenhite.  

Grey hydrothermal alteration is confined to the selvedge of the brittle fractures and rarely extends more 

than half a meter into the host granite. The alteration is generally present to some degree along the 

mineralized structures; however, the quartz-sulfide and sulfide veins are not always present. On 

occasion, the structure may appear as a sericite, chlorite, and ankerite vein only several centimeters 

wide before opening into a traditional hydrothermal selvedge. 

Secondary gold deposits are encountered directly above the mineralized veins within the residual 

saprolite and laterite portions of the regolith profile. Free gold is contained within the oxidized sulfides 

in the vein material, and with secondary iron oxides along fractures and joint planes within the saprolite 

adjacent to the veins, and in pisolites and lateritic cements at the paleo-surface above the vein. The 

secondary deposits are generally not high tonnage, as the residual saprolite profile is only 

approximately 5 to 8 m depth underlying up to 5 m of barren transport cover. They can however be 

nearly 10 times broader than the source mineralized vein due to weathering dispersion of the gold.

7.4.2 São Chico Mine 

Mineralization is hosted in west-northwest striking, steeply south dipping quartz-sulfide veins at the 

São Chico Mine. Individual veins can range from under 0.2 to over 3 m in width, averaging roughly

0.8 m, and are observed over an area of approximately 1 km by 300 m in size. The shear zones hosting 

mineralization correspond to the "P" shear orientation in a pure east-west lateral Riedel system. 

The Main Vein at São Chico strikes in a broadly west-northwest direction, dips steeply to the south, 

and ranges from approximately 1.0 to 3.9 m in apparent width. Mineralization extends approximately 

140 m down dip and approximately 100 m along strike, and is open down dip and plunging to the west; 

to the east, mineralization is open for a minimum of 80 m along strike. The fault zone is variably 

mineralized, with both sinuous and regular quartz veining, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite and 

electrum. Along the vein, high grade lodes are developed where a high degree of brecciation is 

observed, and are manifested as moderately east plunging shoots within the plane of the Main Vein. 

These lodes exhibit a higher chalcopyrite content than what is observed along the strike of the fault 

zone. The dip extent of mineralization remains open along the fault and within numerous higher-grade 

ore shoots. 

The Western Zone is a sub-parallel fault zone developed in the footwall of the Main fault zone. The 

quartz veins display a similar alteration assemblage to the Main Vein, though a narrower width, less 

brecciation and less sulfide content is observed. The fault zone extends along strike for over 100 m to 

the northwest of the Main Vein. 

The Highway Vein strikes roughly west-northwest, dips steeply to the south, and varies from 1.6 to 2.9 

m in apparent width. The mineralized zone extends 75 m below the surface and remains open along 

strike and down dip. High gold grades are associated with brecciated granite supported by chlorite-

sericite-quartz cement with blebby pyrite and galena. 

The Parallel Vein is found 60 m south of the Main Vein fault, within the hanging wall. The vein averages 

90 cm in width, and has been defined over a strike length of approximately 80 m to a depth of 75 m. 

Mineralization comprises quartz-sulfide veins and breccias, with narrow chlorite-sericite-pyrite 

selvedges within a wider potassium-feldspar alteration halo. Although the mineralized interval may be 

1 to 2 m in width, individual veins are often less than 30 cm wide with cross-cutting veins within the 

mineralized zone. Veins are composed of white to grey, fine-grained, massive to banded quartz with 

chlorite stylolites. 

Sulfide mineralization is spatially related to chlorite-sericite alteration in the quartz vein selvedges, and 

the assemblage is dominated by pyrite with locally abundant sphalerite, chalcopyrite and galena 

phases.

8 Deposit Type  

8.1 Mineral Deposit 
Gold deposits in the Tapajós Gold Province can be broadly classified into three main types: 

 Mesozonal deposits; 
 Epizonal intrusion centered or intrusion related deposits; and 
 Alluvial, colluvial and supergene enriched saprolitic deposits. 

Tapajós deposits are structurally controlled, but host rock control is vital to understanding the metal 

precipitation process locally. Primary gold deposits occur as the first two categories of deposit types 

and are generally located in fractured and sheared host environments such as: 

 Quartz and quartz sulfide stock work and associated alteration hosted disseminated sulfide; 
 Quartz vein; 
 Quartz sulfide veins +/- selvedge alteration hosted disseminated sulfide; 
 Massive sulfide veins +/- selvedge alteration hosted disseminated sulfide; and 
 Disseminated sulfide within alteration. 

Historically in the Tapajós, the third category of deposit types has produced most of the gold in the 

region, with a significant contribution from supergene enriched laterite and saprolite deposits. A sizable 

percentage of the gold contained within this category is residual in nature, but physically concentrated 

along stone lines or weathering fronts, liberated from nearby auriferous quartz, quartz-sulfide or sulfide 

veins, and secondarily enriched by redox chemical processes. 

Most of the primary gold sources known in the Tapajós are related to the quartz vein and quartz-sulfide 

vein deposits, as the extensive felsic to intermediate volcanics intruded by coeval granitic intrusives 

provide the conditions for formation of mesothermal and epizonal and/or epithermal deposits. The 

mesothermal granite-hosted systems are associated with a range of deposit types including porphyry, 

orogenic lode gold and intrusion related gold systems. These granite hosted systems share many 

characteristics, with distinction among the genetic models becoming difficult to strictly apply in the 

region. 

Within the regional context of the Palito Mining Complex, significant granite hosted deposits have 

recently been discovered that share geological features with the Palito deposit. Examples including 

the Tocantinzinho and São Jorge gold deposits located approximately 70 km northwest and 45 km 

southeast of the Palito deposit, respectively, as well as a number of artisanal operations. Evidence 

suggests that the Palito deposit is not isolated, but is rather part of a series of deposits in a gold 

endowed district, and it is therefore considered that the potential for further discovery of primary gold 

deposits within the Palito Mining Complex is favorable. 

The mineralogy and textures of the deposits at the Palito Mining Complex is consistent with a model 

for an intrusion related mesothermal gold-copper mineralization (Figure 8-1). This relatively new 

classification of gold deposits is associated with granitic rocks and are best developed above and 

surrounding small, granitic intrusions. Mineralization styles can manifest as stockworks, breccia, 

skarns and lode style veins, and have a clear metal association zonation. 

A number of exploration methods have been useful in the identification and discovery of additional 

gold targets on the Palito Mining Complex. Surficial geochemistry has proven to be successful in areas

of shallow saprolite weathering or where laterite horizons are developed at shallow depths, whereas 

chemical depletion in deeply developed profiles can mask mineralization. Magnetics is limited at the 

Palito Mine due to poor contrast between local host rocks, however it can be used to define additional 

regional scale features. Electromagnetics are limited to detecting only massive sulfide mineralization, 

but is useful in regional screening for initial exploration and targeting mineralized structures. Induced 

polarization methods are effective and have demonstrated the ability to map Palito style mineralization 

with a high degree of definition, ideal for drill targeting.

9 Exploration 

9.1 Relevant Exploration Work 
The presence of gold in the Tapajós region has been recorded as early as 1747 during the Colonial 

Portuguese era. Gold production began in the mid-twentieth century by garimpeiros who followed 

alluvial and colluvial sources up stream until discovering the primary source, mining the free gold from 

the saprolite material by hand and hydraulic methods using basic gravity separation. 

Modern exploration on the Palito Mining Complex was initiated in 1994 by Rio Tinto Desenvolvimentos 

Minerais Ltda (RTDM) and continued until 1997. Early work focused on testing the depth potential of 

near surface garimpeiros workings in the primary sulfide zones. Soil, rock grab and rock chip samples 

were collected for surface geochemistry, preliminary geological mapping was executed, a broadly 

spaced (300 m line spacing) regional aeromagnetic survey was flow, and six diamond drill holes were 

completed in the area surrounding the Palito Mine. 

Exploration work by Serabi on the Palito property has been ongoing since 2003, with surface 

exploration, geological mapping, rock chip sampling, shallow auger drilling and diamond drilling 

programs completed. Since initial exploration, airborne, ground and downhole geophysical surveys 

have been executed to better constrain the known mineralization on the property and define new 

potential targets. 

Table 9-1 summarizes the exploration work completed by Serabi on the property to date. The salient 

exploration work performed in the Palito and São Chico areas is described in greater detail in the 

subsections below.

9.2 Exploration in the Palito Area 

9.2.1 Surface Geochemical Sampling 

Since commencing exploration work in 2002, Serabi's exploration department has conducted a 

number of regional and local soil geochemistry programs using manual and small motorized auger 

drills. Systematic sample intervals were established every 2.5 m on a 100 m x 50 m grid, with auger 

holes penetrating to either 2.5 m or 5 m depth. Geochemical analyses using a 100 ppb detection limit 

showed that the mineralized zones in the Palito Mine area were defined by a greater than 400 ppb 

gold result (Figure 9-1). Subsequent assessment and evaluation of the soil sample results in 2007 

suggested that re-analyses using a 10 ppb detection limit could define more subtle footprints of 

undiscovered mineralization, and the available historic soil sample pulps were sent for analyses at 

SGS Geosol laboratories. This re-assessment did not significantly change the values for characterizing 

the known mineralization. H owever, confidence was gained from the results and improved definition 

of the mineralization was achieved. 

In 2008, Serabi contracted Explorer Services to execute a program of deeper reconnaissance auger 

drilling. A total of 1,206 samples were collected from 1,244.6 m of material with the objective of 

confining the saprolite mineralization at the Bill's Pipe prospect northwest of the Palito Mine. Explorer

Services also completed a regional stream sediment geochemistry program in 2008. Under the 

direction of Serabi, Explorer Services collected a 200 g sample under 200 mesh and a 3 kg sample 

under 2 mm from sample sites across the entirety of the Palito Mining Complex area. A number of 

anomalous zones outside the immediate Palito Mine area were identified; however, these anomalies 

have to date not been followed up. 

From January to February 2011, 771.5 m of surface trenches were excavated over the Piaui prospect 

area, with samples collected at 1 m intervals. This work program was followed up with diamond drilling 

in March 2011. 

Auger drilling was planned over numerous target areas in 2011. Geochemical anomalies, IP 

anomalies, and trenches with anomalous results or those that did not reach the pisolith horizon were 

tested. Sampling was conducted using a Big Beaver motorized auger rig over 14 planned lines, with 

samples collected every 5 m.

9.2.2 Geophysical Surveys 

The Palito Mining Complex is partially covered by a broad 300 m line-spaced airborne magnetic and 

radiometric survey that was commissioned by RTDM in mid 1996. Several phases of geophysical

surveys and a number of reviews have since been completed on the property under the ownership of 

Serabi. 

In 2002, Serabi commissioned Fugro Ground Geophysics (Fugro) to conduct a ground based magnetic 

and dipole-dipole induced polarization (IP) survey over the northern portion of the Palito Mine area, 

and extending to the Copper Hill area. A total of 13 line-kilometers were completed over the survey 

area, the results from which defined the main mineralized zone at the Palito Mine and identified 

numerous anomalies. The additional anomalies that were identified were subsequently drill tested in 

the following years. 

Fugro also completed a fixed loop time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) survey over two areas adjacent 

to the main mineralized zone and to supplement the previously executed ground magnetic program. 

The survey was initiated in November 2003 and completed in early 2004. Fugro was commissioned to 

execute further fixed-loop TEM surveys in late 2006 and early 2007 over the Chico da Santa prospect 

area, located adjacent to the Palito Mine and along the southern strike extension of the Palito 

mineralization. As part of the extended TEM survey, Fugro also conducted downhole electromagnetic 

surveys of 14 drill holes within the Palito Main Zone, and the Chico da Santa, Ruari's Ridge and Palito 

West prospects in early 2007. 

Serabi conducted an in-house ground magnetic survey in April 2007 at the Tatu prospect area, located 

approximately 2 km northeast of the Palito Mine. The survey focused on targeting the magnetic quartz 

vein hosted mineralization apparent within the prospect. 

In September 2007, Geotech Ltd (Geotech) was commissioned to complete a helicopter-borne vertical 

time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) survey. The survey covered 6,650 hectares from the Rio Novo 

prospect to an area some 1.5 km northwest of the Palito Mine. A total of 750 line-kilometers were 

flown, with survey lines spaced at 100 m intervals in a northeast-southwest line direction 

(perpendicular to the known mineralization trend). Results indicated that the Palito Mine corresponded 

with six discrete anomalies and two anomalous zones, as well as the Palito West and Ruari's Ridge 

prospects displaying associated EM anomalies. The survey was integrated with other geophysical and 

geological datasets, and defined a number of northwest-southeast oriented lineations containing 

multiple high priority VTEM target or target clusters corresponding to the P direction in the Riedel 

scheme. A number of target clusters also occurred on northeast-southwest trending zones 

corresponding with the R' orientation in the Riedel scheme. A total of 18 target areas were defined 

within a 7 km radius of the Palito Mine, including three high-priority drill ready targets. 

In July 2008, reprocessing of the 2002 Fugro IP data using a Zonge Smooth Model Inversion was 

conducted. Pseudo section data was converted into resistivity and chargeability models reflecting the 

geometry and location of anomaly sources. Notably, modeling demonstrated that Palito style 

mineralization is a valuable technique in defining mineralized trends, and a number of untested 

features within the survey area were highlighted. 

In March 2010, contractors from Fugro, LASA Prospecções S.A. (LASA), and Geomag S.A. 

Prospecções Geofisicas (Geomag) executed a 45 line-kilometer IP survey over three grid areas, based 

on the data integration and assessment previously completed by Serabi. The survey incorporated 13 

of the 18 integrated targets, and modeling of the survey data defined nine priority drill targets. 

Geotech commenced a further 8,000-hectare helicopter borne VTEM survey in January 2011 over 

areas of interest to the northeast and south of the 2008 survey area. Approximately 1,200 line-

kilometers were flown along 100 m spaced lines perpendicular to the main geological trend, and an 

additional 47 anomalies were defined. The combined VTEM surveys cover approximately 15 km strike 

projection of the Palito host structure. Geoelectric model sections were generated via conductivity 

depth transform through Emax Air software. Model sections and raw data profiles were integrated to 

identify anomalies attributable to basement conductors, and in the Jardim do Ouro area, basement 

conductors were observed to appear as increased amplitude signatures in the moderate time 

channels. These signatures were identified as discrete profile anomalies and marked for investigation. 

In addition, a 3D resistivity/conductivity model of the sections was constructed, from which more 

conductive areas were identified where the subtle increased amplitude anomalies were not readily 

identifiable in the profiles. 

Geomag was commissioned to complete three additional IP surveys over grid blocks in the Palito area 

in August 2011. The program involved surveying 11 line-kilometers that extended the 2010 survey 

grids to cover strike extents of the Piaui and Currutela prospect anomalies, 34 line-kilometers covering 

target zones in an area east of the Rio Novo river that were identified during the 2009 integration 

process, and 9 line-kilometers over the Jamanxim target derived from the 2011 VTEM program. A total 

of 53.25 line-kilometers was completed on 200 m spaced traverses across the three grid areas. The 

data was modeled using Zonge 2D Smooth Inversion modeling software to generate modeled sections 

and was merged with the modeled sections of the 2010 IP survey to generate a 3D model of the 

resistivity and chargeability. Several new anomalies were identified in the eastern survey block, in 

addition to extending the Currutela anomaly along both strike directions and extending the Piaui 

anomaly to the southeast. 

Most recently, in August and September 2016, Serabi initiated a down-hole EM survey on boreholes 

drilled in the 2010 and 2011 exploration drilling program. A total of 21 drill holes were surveyed in the 

Currutela, Piaui, Palito South and Copper Hill prospect areas by Geomag. The objective of the survey 

was to better locate the position of geophysical anomalies to aid in better targeting for future drilling 

campaigns. 

9.3 Exploration in the São Chico Area 
Under previous ownership, exploration work on the São Chico property has included surface trenching, 

channel sampling, ground EM, and diamond drilling by Gold Aura do Brasil Mineração Ltda (GOAB), 

and diamond drilling, sampling, and ground IP and airborne EM geophysical surveys by Kenai 

Resources Ltd (Kenai). Since Serabi acquired the property in 2013, two surface diamond drilling 

programs have been executed, along with regional geophysical surveying. 

9.3.1 Surface Geochemical Sampling 

In 2011, Exploration Alliance Ltd. (EAL) collected rock chip samples from outcrop exposed by artisanal 

miners north of the São Chico Mine. A total of 13 samples were collected and each sample weighed 

approximately 2 to 3 kg. Results showed that elevated gold was related to 1 m wide quartz veins 

hosted in saprolitic granodiorite.  

Further exploration work is warranted, as outcrop and vein structures are not exposed outside of 

artisanal workings.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

9.3.2 Geophysical Surveys 

In 2010, GOAB performed a ground EM survey in the São Chico area. Stations were established at 

12.5 (m) intervals along 50 m spaced lines, totaling 2.7 line-kilometers. Results of the survey defined 

a zone of high chargeability to the immediate south of artisanal workings and an area previously 

trenched by GOAB. A linear east-southeast striking zone of low chargeability was interpreted to 

represent a fault zone hosting mineralization, and a subparallel linear zone of low chargeability located 

approximately 70 m north of historic artisanal workings remains untested. 

Also in 2010, Kenai commissioned G3-JB Prado consultants and Geoprospector-Geophysical 

Solutions to perform a series of 38 dipole-dipole IP traverses. Dipoles were spaced at 5 m intervals 

along 100 to 200 m profiles, resulting total of 7,090 line-meters were completed across the area 

immediately south of the São Chico Mine corridor and areas considered prospective in the region. The 

survey reached a maximum penetration of approximately 35 m below the surface and was designed 

to locate shallow veins, however, was ultimately ineffective due to the saprolitic weathering profile and 

the presence of a conductive pisolite within parts of the survey area. 

In 2013, in parallel with extensive drilling, Serabi commissioned Geomag to complete a 44.95 line-

kilometer regional IP survey across the northern and eastern portion of the São Chico property. The 

survey was completed across 30 lines spaced 200 m apart using 25 m spaced receivers and 50 m 

spaced transmitter arrays. 

Work began on a ground IP survey in late 2016 to test newly acquired exploration areas and the 

potential for strike extensions of mineralization to the east and west of the São Chico Mine. At the end 

of 2016, a total of 30 km of a planned 100 km of traverses had been completed. Work was 

subsequently suspended, but is expected to restart during 2018. 

9.4 Exploration Strategy 
Serabi has been exploring the Palito Mining Complex since 2003 and have acquired an appreciation 

of the geology, geochemistry and geophysical signatures and controls on the gold mineralization within 

the Palito Mine and throughout the Palito Mining Complex area. 

Serabi have used the following process to facilitate exploration and the discovery of new deposits in 

the project area: 

 Ground selection – northwest-southeast structural corridor, with northeast-southwest breaks; 
 Remote sensing and remote geophysics, VTEM and magnetics; 
 IP and EM ground geophysics, and shallow geochemical sampling and/or drilling using auger 

or RAB; and 

 Diamond drilling based on integrated models and ranking. 

Serabi believe that exploration should focus on structural corridors parallel to, or extensions of the 

Palito trend and specifically where Palito Central Fault analogies exist. Topographic highs on the flanks 

are considered more prospective due to silicification of the country rock, making them more resistant 

to weathering.  

If funding permits, Serabi will undertake regional preliminary surface exploration activities where 

exploration data is limited on the Palito Mining Complex tenements to determine if target areas should 

continue to be held.

10 Drilling 
10.1 Palito Mine 

10.1.1 Introduction 

Prior to Serabi's acquisition of the Palito Mining Complex, RTDM completed six boreholes in late 1996. 

The drilling totaled 1,610.06 m and successfully intersected gold mineralization within the Palito Main 

Zone. However, due to the narrow nature of the mineralized veins and lack of large tonnage, the low-

grade potential did not allow for RTDM to move forward with development of the project. Serabi has 

since re-logged and re-sampled the core for confirmatory analysis and have incorporated this drilling 

into their database.  

All the drilling available at the Palito Mine is illustrated in Figure 10-1.

10.1.2 Core Drilling 

A total of 18,235 m of core drilling from surface was completed by Serabi during 2005. The bulk of the 

work was undertaken on and around the Palito Main Zone, where step-out drilling resulted in the 

discovery of a series of high-grade gold veins (collectively termed the Compressor Lode) and 

illustrated the potential of additional satellite orebodies parallel to the Palito Main Zone. Evaluation of 

soil geochemistry results, geophysical surveys and geology lead to diamond drilling at the Palito West 

and Bill's Pipe targets in late 2005, where high-grade gold mineralization was intersected. Further 

drilling at Palito, totaling 7,705 m of surface drilling and 6,406 m of underground drilling, was completed 

during 2006. Additional drilling was undertaken at nearby satellite prospects, resulting in a total of 

15,253 m drilled on the property in 2006. 

The early months of 2007 focused on preliminary evaluation of properties adjacent to the Palito Main 

Zone. The presence of mineralization at Chico da Santa and Palito West had already been established, 

and limited drilling of both prospects indicated potential to become small satellite mining operations. 

There were also indications that a series of mineralized structures parallel to the Palito Main Zone 

might exist over a much wider area. Pursuing this and following up on a strong gold-in-soil geochemical 

anomaly in the Ruari's Ridge area, an area of mineralized weathered outcrop (gossan) was 

discovered. A trenching program followed, which identified the presence of a high-grade mineralized 

structure extending over 600 m strike at surface. Follow-up drilling confirmed additional sub-parallel 

zones of gold-copper mineralization. Simultaneous drilling in the Chico da Santa area successfully 

identified two additional vein structures. A total of 27,494 m of drilling were completed over the Palito 

Mine area in 2007. 

Throughout the course of 2008, Serabi undertook an extensive drill program that was initiated in 

November 2007. Over 19,000 m of a planned 25,000 m was drilled prior to the program being 

suspended in the fourth quarter of 2008. During the first half of 2008, over 7,300 m of drilling were 

completed across the Palito Main Zone and Palito West deposits, targeting EM geophysical anomalies. 

Variable gold grades were encountered in massive sulfide and quartz vein-sulfide zones intersected 

during drilling. By the end of the program, five addition vein structures were identified at Palito West. 

At the Senna Zone (formerly known as Rauri's Ridge), drilling confirmed the presence of a significant 

and minable oxidized gold zone located immediately above the main Senna gold vein. 

A discovery and follow-up diamond drill program was conducted by Serabi from December 2010 to 

November 2011. The drilling was designed to be completed in two phases; the first phase was directed

at IP chargeability models with coincident resistivity or conductivity anomalies and additional 

geochemical, EM or structural interpretation support, and the second phase was aimed at infilling 

successful phase 1 targets and to further define existing intersections at Palito South. The Phase 1 

program saw 36 exploration boreholes totaling 8,214 m drilled over nine targets in the vicinity of the 

Palito operation, of which gold mineralization was intersected in seven. The two most prospective 

targets, Piaui and Currutela, were followed up with an additional 43 boreholes totaling 4,392 m during 

the phase 2 program, targeting shallow near surface potential. Of the 43 boreholes, 20 were drilled 

between Currutela and Palito (referred to as Palito South) and encouraging results were recorded, 

with bonanza gold and high-grade copper results returned. Positive results were also returned from 

the Piaui prospect where the remaining 23 holes were drilled. The drilling was undertaken over two 

areas of 600 m and 350 m strike length and intersected broad zones of intense chlorite-silica-sulfide 

alteration zones in excess of 40 m. 

In addition, an exploratory borehole intended to test the northwest continuity of the Palito Main zone 

inadvertently intersected gold mineralization at what is now known as the Espeto prospect. The bulk 

mineralized zone returned 17.06 m at 1.17 g/t gold from 84.25 m depth, including 0.88 m at 5.25 g/t 

gold and 0.61 m at 10.90 g/t gold. Multiple zones of hydrothermally altered granite, comparable to 

Palito and Currutela, were encountered and indicated potential strike extension of approximately 2 km 

between the Palito Mine and the southerly limit of the Currutela target.  

In late 2011, 20 shallow boreholes totaling 1,632 m were drilled at the Palito South prospect, in the 

area between the Espito prospect and Palito Mine. High-grade intersections were encountered in a 

number of boreholes including 0.72 m at 8.91 g/t gold, 0.90 m at 21.60 g/t gold, 1.40 m at 43.20 g/t 

gold, 0.81 m at 8.79 g/t gold and 0.93 m at 34.75 g/t gold. 

Exploration core drilling at Palito and the surrounding satellite prospects has been on hold since 2011. 

10.1.3 Reverse Circulation Drilling 

In 2006 and 2007, Serabi executed two RC drill programs with the intention of expediting the drill 

programs to provide a rapid turn-around for planning, and to assess the potential of the shallower 

saprolite and oxide mineralization in the near mine environment. Drilling services were provided by 

Wilemita Ltda in 2006 and by GeoLogica Sondagens 2007. The focus of the 2006 program was on the 

Bill's Pipe, Chico da Santa and Ruari's Ridge prospects, while the 2007 program was executed on the 

Chico da Santa prospect only. The use of the RC drilling method proved less effective than anticipated 

due to the depth of the regolith profile encountered and the abrasive nature of the granites. 

From May to early June 2009, a program of 393.6 m of RC drilling was conducted using Serabi's 

crawler underground drill rig to explore for shallow oxide mineralization in the vicinity of the existing 

Palito West and G3 south lodes. 

10.1.4 Rotary Air Blast Drilling 

Rotary air blast drilling (RAB) was contracted to Geologica Sondagens in 2009 to test a number of soil 

geochemistry anomalies in the Palito Mine area. The use of RAB drilling was again undertaken to 

expedite the assessment of soil geochemistry anomalies, however, it was limited by ground conditions 

and logistical issues and was a less effective and slower method than anticipated.  

RAB drilling was used as an exploration tool only, and the results are not included in the resource 

estimation.

10.1.5 Underground Drilling 

The utilization of a small underground drill rig for exploration drilling began in 2016 to assist in 

identifying additional resources at depth. This work is performed in addition to underground drilling that 

is performed on a month to month basis for mine planning purposes. A total of 3,740 m was drilled in 

2016 for short term mine planning and an additional 1,868 m for longer term resource modeling and 

resource growth purposes. This drilling was performed primarily within the Senna sector of the Palito 

Mine. 

10.1.6 Channel Sampling 

Face and back samples are routinely collected along development drives and mining fronts as grade 

control for the mining operation. Channel samples are marked by a geologist or mining technician and 

sampled in a continuous line using a hammer and chisel. Chips are transferred into a plastic bag and 

marked with the appropriate sample number and sealed.

10.2.2 Drilling 

Prior to acquisition of the property by Serabi, Kenai completed 22 boreholes totaling 3,235 m at the 

São Chico deposit in 2011. Drilling was planned to target the known mineralization of the Main Vein 

and Highway Vein, and to explore the along strike and down dip extensions of these zones and the 

potential for buried, sub-parallel vein structures. The results of the drilling indicated that the 

mineralization at São Chico strikes west-northwest over 540 m and remains open along strike and at 

depth. 

From May to October 2013, Serabi completed a diamond drilling campaign totaling 6,070 m over 38 

boreholes. The program initially targeted the Main Vein, where 21 infill and step out drill holes totaling 

4,950 m were completed. The program was supplemented by a ground geophysics IP survey, and the 

resulting anomalies were tested with 1,120 m of diamond drilling. A further five shallow boreholes 

totaling approximately 500 m was completed at the Highway Vein. Results from the 21 boreholes 

drilled into the Main Vein returned a series of high grade gold intersections including ten intercepts in 

excess of 100 g/t gold. The drilling intercepted a continuous zone of alteration and quartz sulfide veins 

beneath and along strike from the previous Kenai drilling campaign. Drilling at the Highway Vein 

resulted in four out of the five holes producing near surface mineralized intersections (less than 85 m 

down hole) in excess of 25 g/t gold. 

In 2015, following development on the São Chico main lode, Serabi conducted a surface drilling 

program of 42 boreholes totaling 7,204 m. The drill holes were planned to better refine the geological 

understanding of the major mineralized zones and attempt to extend the mineralized lodes defined by 

previous drilling. 

In late 2015, a small underground drilling rig was utilized for exploration drilling to better understand 

and evaluate the down dip continuation of the Main Vein. A total of 1,459 m was drilled in 2015 from 

30 holes, and a further 5,560 m was drilled in 2016 from 53 holes. 

10.2.3 Channel Sampling 

Historically EAL collected 17 underground channel samples from the back of the São Chico drive at a 

spacing of 2 to 5 m. Channels were cut 5 cm wide and 2 cm deep using a handheld electric circular 

saw. Two to six samples were collected per channel based on lithological contacts and included both 

wall rock and vein material where possible. Results indicated that elevated gold grades between 10.79 

and 254.50 g/t gold were consistently repeated over a strike length of 50 m over intervals of up to 1.5 

m wide. High grade gold was spatially associated with the shallow angle intersection of two vein sets; 

at this intersection mineralization comprised of brecciated quartz veins and strong chlorite-sericite 

alteration with semi-massive pyrite-galena-sphalerite in the breccia matrix. Sheeted quartz veinlets 

and quartz lenses exploiting en-echelon tension gashes crosscut the breccia. 

Following commencement of mine development on the São Chico main lode in 2015, channel samples 

were taken from both mine development drives and grade control within the stopes. As of March 2016, 

over 680 channel samples had been collected across five mine levels.

10.3 Drilling Procedures and Sampling Methodology 

10.3.1 Palito Mine 

At the Palito Mine, Serabi's survey department surveys surface and underground drill collar positions 

using total station and theodolite optical equipment. Down-hole surveys are performed using a Reflex 

E-Z shot tool that records azimuth and dip measurements at 30 m intervals down the hole. The surveys 

are recorded by the geology department and maintained in the Serabi database. 

Exploration drill core is half core sampled; one half is retained for future reference, while the other half 

of the core is placed in a plastic sample bag, identified with the appropriate sample number and sealed. 

Samples are placed into a larger 50 L bag, which is marked and sealed prior to dispatch to the 

laboratory. All underground core is whole core sampled and undergoes the same evolution as the 

exploration drill core. 

Drill core sampling is executed at the geological core logging facility at the Palito Mine site. All drill 

core is cut and sampled based on geological intervals that are no less than 0.5 m and no greater than 

1.2 m. If the interval exceeds 1.2 m, it is divided equally into sample intervals covering the zone of 

interest to no less than 0.5 m. If the interval is less than 0.5 m, the sample is extended to incorporate 

country rock and/or gangue material. 

Channel samples are collected using a similar protocol to diamond drill sampling, where a sample 

length between 0.5 and 1.2 m is achieved. Rock chips typically weighing 2 to 5 g are collected prior to 

being sent to the Palito Mine laboratory for preparation and analysis. 

Reverse circulation drill sampling is typically conducted at 1 m intervals for the entire hole, with the 

exception of the 2009 reverse circulation program in which samples were collected using a 1.2 m 

interval. 

10.3.2 São Chico Mine 

At the São Chico project, drill collars are typically located using a handheld GPS device with 4 m 

accuracy, and down-hole surveys are performed using a Reflex E-Z shot tool. 

Drill core is reconstructed and washed by the driller, and stored in wooden core boxes marked with 

the drillhole number, meterage and box number. Drill core is stored at the drill rig until mine staff 

transport it to the core logging facility at camp. Drill core undergoes geotechnical logging, meter 

marking, geological logging, and photographing prior to sampling.  

The entire drill hole is sampled, with sample intervals of 2 m unless the sample crossed a lithological 

boundary or change in alteration or mineralization. In such cases, the sample interval is determined 

based on lithology or alteration and maintained a minimum length of 0.5 m in order to ensure a 

sufficient enough sample weight. Each sample interval was recorded on the core box. Core was cut in 

half using a circular rock saw and jig, with one half left in the core box for future reference and the 

other used for sampling purposes. 

Since the acquisition of São Chico by Serabi, comparable drilling and sampling procedures to that at 

Palito are being undertaken at São Chico.

10.4 SRK Comments 
SRK is of the opinion that the drilling and sampling procedures used by Serabi are generally consistent 

with industry best practices. The resultant drilling pattern is sufficiently dense to interpret the geometry 

and the boundaries of mineralized domains with confidence. Samples were collected by competent 

personnel and the process was undertaken and supervised by suitable qualified geologists. SRK 

believes the samples are representative of the source material and that there is no evidence that the 

sampling process has introduced a bias.

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 
11.1 Sample Preparation and Analyses 

11.1.1 Surface Geochemical Samples 

Soil geochemistry from the 2003 exploration program was initially analyzed at Serabi's internal Palito 

laboratory using an aqua regia method and atomic absorption spectrometry finish to a detection limit 

of 100 ppb. Subsequent assessment and evaluation of the soil results in 2007 suggested that re-

analyses using a 10 ppb detection limit could define more subtle footprints of undiscovered 

mineralization and the available historic soil sample pulps were sent for analyses at the SGS Geosol 

laboratory in Belo Horizonte. After 2007, all soil sampling conducted away from the immediate Palito 

Mine area was analyzed at external laboratories using a 10 ppb lower detection limit. 

Samples collected during the 2008 stream sediment geochemistry program were also submitted to 

SGS Geosol of Belo Horizonte for analyses using a 10 ppb detection limit. 

11.1.2 Core Samples 

Palito Mine 

Historically, underground core which had a shorter turn-over period than regular surface core holes, 

were prepared primarily at the Palito Mine laboratory. The remainder were sent to either ALS Chemex, 

with preparation at Goiás and assaying at Brisbane, Australia, or to the SGS Geosol laboratory with 

preparation at Itaituba and assaying at Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Both external laboratories used standard 

30 g fire assay and aqua regia analysis for gold and copper and are certified commercial laboratories. 

Once an onsite analytical laboratory was established at the Palito Mine in 2005, samples of primarily 

quarter core were analysed via MIBK or DIBK for gold and aqua regia for copper. 

In 2007, the process of quarter and half core preparation at the onsite laboratory was abandoned, as 

a core preparation facility was established in Itaituba by SGS Geosol. Due to the limited capacity of 

the Palito laboratory to process exploration drill samples as a result of the increase in mine production 

and mill samples assuming a higher priority, improved turnaround time on analyses could be achieved 

with the addition of the preparation facility at SGS Geosol. In October 2007, under advice received 

from NCL, Serabi began sample preparation of half core samples at the onsite laboratory, and 

dispatched prepared samples to SGS Geosol for analyses. This process continued until February 

2008, when increased production of drill samples exceeded the preparation facilities of the Palito 

laboratory and all samples were again sent to SGS Geosol. 

Serabi utilized the services of SGS Geosol until the end of 2010 for all drill core samples comprising 

the mineral resource at that time. Sample preparation was performed at SGS's facility in Itaituba, while 

analysis was performed at their Belo Horizonte laboratory. With regards to the 2010 to 2011 drilling 

campaign, sample preparation was performed by Serabi at the Palito Mine laboratory, while analyses 

took place at Eco Tech Laboratory and ALS Minerals located in British Columbia, Canada. 

Sample preparation at the Palito Mine laboratory and SGS Geosol facility in Itaituba includes the 

following steps: 

 Samples dried at 110° Celsius; 
 Crushed to pass 2 mm screen; 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 60 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

 Riffle split; 1 kg split ground to a -150 mesh pulp; and 
 Collect 125 g of homogenized fraction; 50 g for sample analyses, remaining stored in a marked 

envelope for future reference. 

Samples which have been marked as having visible gold during the core logging stage follow slightly 

different sample preparation steps: 

 Entire sample crushed and ground to -150 mesh; 
 Sample passed through a 150 mesh screen; 
 Undersized material weighed and treated in the same way as a normal sample; 
 Oversized material weighed, pulverized, and treated as a separate sample; and 
 Both sample analyses reported separately; laboratory calculates weighted average and the 

single value is ascribed to the sample interval. 

At SGS, gold was assayed in 30 g aliquots by fire assay with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) 

finish. The gold value was calculated by comparison with a set of known gold standards. At the Palito 

Mine laboratory, samples are analyzed by aqua regia with AAS finish. 

São Chico Mine 

Under the ownership of Kenai, drill core samples were prepared at ACME in Itaituba, Brazil, and 

analyzed by ACME in Santiago, Chile, using 50 g gold fire assay. Samples were prepared using 

ACME's preparation code R200-1000, which includes the following steps: 

 Entire samples crushed to 80% passing 10 mesh; 
 Riffle split; 250 g sub-sample produced; and 
 Pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh. 

Samples were then transported from Santiago to ACME in Vancouver, Canada for analysis by aqua 

regia with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) finish. 

11.1.3 Reverse Circulation Samples 

At the Palito Mine site, reverse circulation drill samples were passed through a Jones Riffle Splitter, 

quartering the sample until a 2 kg sample was achieved. In cases where the sample was too moist to 

pass through the riffle splitter, it was sun or oven dried until it could be passed through the splitter. 

Samples were placed in plastic sample bags, identified with the appropriate sample number and 

sealed. They were then placed into larger 50 L bags, which were marked and sealed prior to dispatch 

to the laboratory. 

Samples were prepared and assayed by SGS Laboratories by 30 g fire assay for gold and aqua regia 

for copper. Alternatively, samples underwent a combination of preparation and analysis at the Palito 

laboratory by aqua regia for gold and copper, with pulps submitted to SGS for analysis by 30 g fire 

assay and aqua regia. 

11.1.4 Channel Samples 

Palito Mine 

At the Palito Mine, approximately two to 5 kg of chips from face and back channels is collected for 

sampling. The samples are delivered to the Palito laboratory where they are prepared and analyzed 

for gold and copper by aqua regia method.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

São Chico Mine 

Under the ownership of Kenai, rock chip and underground channel samples were prepared and 

assayed at SGS Geosol's laboratory in Vespasiano, Brazil using the following steps: 

 Entire sample dried and crushed to 75% passing 2 mm screen; and 
 250 g sub-sample pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh. 

Samples were then submitted for 50 g fire assay with AAS finish (SGS Geosol code FAA505) and 34 

element ICP-OES analysis following aqua regia digest (SGS Geosol code ICP12B). 

11.2 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 
Quality assurance and quality control programs are typically set in place to ensure the reliability and 

trustworthiness of exploration data. They include written field procedures and independent verifications 

of aspects such as drilling, surveying, sampling and assaying, data management, and database 

integrity. Appropriate documentation of quality control measures and regular analysis of quality control 

data are important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for the quality assurance program 

implemented during exploration. 

Analytical control measures typically involve internal and external laboratory control measures 

implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the sampling, preparation, and assaying. They 

are also important to prevent sample mix-up and monitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination 

of samples. Assaying protocols typically involve regular duplicate and replicate assays and insertion 

of quality control samples to monitor the reliability of assaying results throughout the sampling and 

assaying process. Check assaying is typically performed as an additional reliability test of assaying 

results. This typically involves re-assaying a set number of rejects and pulps at a second umpire 

laboratory. 

11.2.1 Palito Mine 

The analytical quality control program implemented at Palito includes the insertion of control samples 

within sample batches that are being submitted for assaying. Blanks and certified reference material 

are inserted alternately every 10 samples, and their results are monitored. The Palito and SGS Geosol 

laboratories report on their own internal standards and blanks by conducting duplicate pulp analyses. 

Serabi's current quality control program uses reference materials produced by Rocklabs of Auckland, 

New Zealand. A number of standards covering a wide range of grades are incorporated into all sample 

batches. 

Samples of pure quartz are used as blank samples in assay batches to monitor potential contamination 

during the sample preparation process. If the assay result of a blank sample returns a grade over the 

detection limit of 0.03 g/t gold, the entire batch is considered for re-analyses. 

Approximately 10% of the samples submitted are for quality control purposes. 

11.2.2 São Chico Mine 

The analytical quality control program implemented at São Chico is similar to that at Palito. Control 

samples are inserted into all sample batches submitted for assaying from the São Chico Mine. Drill 

core samples are submitted in batches of 20 and each batch contained 16 drill core samples, one 

blank, one certified reference material, one crush duplicate and one pulp duplicate.

Blanks and certified reference material results, however, were not reported on and therefore cannot 

be verified by SRK. 

11.3 SRK Comments 
In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by Serabi 

are consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate.

12 Data Verification  
12.1 Verifications by Serabi 

Exploration and production work completed by Serabi is conducted using documented procedures and 

involves detailed verification and validation of data prior to being considered for geological modeling 

and mineral resource estimation. During drilling, experienced mine geologists implement best 

practices designed to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the exploration data. 

As previously outlined, Serabi relies partly on the internal analytical quality control measures 

implemented by SGS and the Palito Mine laboratory, but also implement external analytical quality 

control measures comprising of inserting control samples in all sample batches submitted for assaying 

and requesting pulp and coarse reject duplicate samples. Quality control failures are investigated and 

appropriate actions are taken when necessary, including requesting re-assaying of certain batches of 

samples.  

With the objective of assessing the quality of sample preparation and the analytical accuracy and 

precision of the Palito Mine laboratory, a group of sub-samples were chosen by NCL Ingeníearia y 

Contrucción Ltda in 2012 to submit for retesting by the SGS Belo Horizonte laboratory. A total of 99 

coarse reject and 1,075 pulp reject sub-samples were collected. The conclusion of the study showed 

the Palito laboratory presented poor repeatability and demonstrated a moderate bias when compared 

with results from SGS for gold assays. The issue was found to be associated primarily with results 

below 0.7 g/t gold, related to a detection limit at the Palito laboratory being higher than expected. When 

values above this threshold were considered, the repeatability improved significantly and the bias was 

nearly eliminated. SRK understand that Serabi has implemented measures to remediate this issue. 

12.2 Verifications by SRK 

12.2.1 Site Visit 

In accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the Palito and São Chico operations from May 

12 to 15, 2017, accompanied by representatives of Serabi. The SRK team of qualified persons 

comprised of Glen Cole, PGeo, Eric Olin, PEng and Tim Olson, FAusImm. 

The site visit took place during active drilling and production activities. All aspects that could materially 

impact the integrity of the data informing the Mineral Resources (core logging, sampling, analytical 

results, and database management) were reviewed with Serabi staff. SRK interviewed mine staff to 

ascertain exploration and production procedures and protocols. SRK examined selected core and 

confirmed that the logging information accurately reflects actual core. The lithology contacts checked 

by SRK match that of the information reported in the core logs. SRK toured the underground operations 

and assessed the attributes of the vein mineralization. 

12.2.2 Verifications of Analytical Quality Control Data 

To assess the accuracy and precision of analytical quality control data, SRK routinely analyzes such 

data. Analytical quality control data typically comprises analyses from standard reference material, 

blank samples, and a variety of duplicate data. Analyses of data from standard reference material and 

blank samples typically involve time series plots to identify extreme values (outliers) or trends that may 

indicate issues with the overall data quality. To assess the repeatability of assay data, several tests 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

can be performed, of which most rely on certain statistical tools. SRK routinely plots and assesses the 

following charts for duplicate data: 

 Bias charts; 
 Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot; 
 Mean versus half relative deviation (HRD) plot; 
 Mean versus half absolute relative deviation plot; and 
 Ranked half absolute relative deviation (HARD) plot. 

Discussion 

SRK analyzed the available analytical quality control data of the Palito and São Chico operations to 

confirm that the analytical results are reliable for informing mineral resource estimates. Serabi provided 

analytical data as an Access database and as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and SRK aggregated the 

assay results for further analysis. Certified reference materials and blanks were summarized on time 

series plots to highlight the performance of the control samples, and duplicate assays were examined 

using bias charts, quantile-quantile, and relative precision plots. 

Palito Mine 

The pre-2016 database provided by Serabi for the Palito Mine contained standards with over 90 unique 

identification names. SRK investigated approximately one third of the standards, and only those which 

had a minimum of 10 associated assay results and accompanying certificates of analyses. SRK 

recommends that Serabi significantly reduce the number of reference materials in use, so that 

statistical analysis can be performed on sufficient populations of data to accurately assess laboratory 

performance over time.  

The performance of the control samples inserted with samples submitted for assaying at the Palito 

Mine laboratory prior to 2016 is below expectation. Several the assay results of standards are outside 

±2 times the standard deviation of the expected value (and often below two times the standard 

deviation), and can likely be attributed to applied analytical methods. The recommended values 

reported by Rocklabs is for samples analyzed by fire assay method, whereas the Palito laboratory 

uses aqua regia digestion. Samples sent to SGS Geosol underwent 30 g fire assay and show 

considerably improved results; examples of reference materials that have been compared by analytical 

method can be found in Appendix A. Control samples assessed from the 2016 dataset appear to 

demonstrate more consistent results, however, differences in analytical method is again likely 

contributing to the number of results outside ±2 times the standard deviation of the expected value. It 

is highly recommended that standards with certified values for the appropriate analytical method be 

used to properly monitor the performance of the Palito laboratory. 

Concerns of possible contamination during the sample preparation process or mislabeling of blank 

samples is noted in the pre-2016 dataset, however, only approximately 1% of blank samples are 

observed to be above the warning limit (defined as ten times the lower detection limit). Improvements 

have been made, as no blank samples in the 2016 dataset are observed to be above the warning limit. 

Serabi should continue to incorporate blank samples and monitor their performance on a regular basis. 

Duplicate assays of internal blanks and standards used by the analytical laboratories to which Serabi 

sent samples to in the pre-2016 dataset was also assessed. Rank half absolute difference (HARD) 

plots suggest that approximately 98% of the duplicate samples assayed for gold have HARD below 

10% and approximately 92% of the duplicate samples assayed for copper have HARD below 10%,

indicating extremely good repeatability of the sample results. No paired data was provided in the 2016 

dataset, however, Serabi has informed SRK that duplicate samples for the mine are now being 

collected. 

Serabi should continue to closely monitor the performance of the Palito Mine quality control samples 

and identify and investigate the cause of any significant outliers. 

São Chico Mine 

A number of paired data sets were provided to SRK by Serabi for São Chico samples assayed between 

2011 and 2015. They include field duplicate samples, pulp duplicate samples, duplicate laboratory 

samples, and crushed duplicate samples assayed at the Palito Mine Laboratory and a number of 

External Laboratories including SGS Geosol, ALS Chemex and ACME Laboratory. Overall, the data 

sets indicate that paired data results could be reasonably reproduced for the type of deposit being 

investigated. The paired data set showing poor reproducibility is that of pulp samples originally 

assayed by aqua regia at the Palito Mine laboratory and re-assayed by SGS Geosol using 30 g fire 

assay. Rank half absolute difference plots suggest that approximately 17% of the pulp duplicates have 

HARD below 10%, however, this is attributed to the different analytical methods being used at the 

laboratories and the results are therefore considered negligible. 

Blanks and reference material results were not reported, and therefore, no verification could be made 

on this dataset. SRK recommend that in future, Serabi ensures that results for all control samples be 

reported on to thoroughly monitor the performance of the Palito Mine laboratory.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing  

13.1 Palito Ore Testing and Procedures 
Metallurgical tests were carried out by AMMTEC Australia on behalf of Serabi Mining during the period 

from April 2004 through August 2005. The testwork conducted in 2004 was performed on three 

samples of Palito Mine ore that were identified as AmVeio 1, AmVeio 2, and AmVeio Oziel. Head 

analyses for these test samples are presented in Table 13-1 with gold grades ranging from 34.9 to 

76.0 g/t Au and copper grades ranging from 0.30% to 1.11% Cu. It is noted that the gold head grades 

of the test composites are all significantly higher than the grades of actual mined ore which ranged 

from about 5 to 12 g/t during the period 2005 to 2007.

13.1.1 Flotation and Cyanidation Testwork 

Testwork on these samples included three approaches to flotation, including bulk sulfide flotation, 

selective copper flotation followed by bulk sulfide flotation, and straight selective copper flotation. The 

results of these tests are summarized in Table 13-2. The selective copper flotation test conducted on 

test sample Am Veio 1 (which represented a copper grade closer to the copper grades likely to be 

produced from the Palito Mine) resulted in the recovery of 93.3% of the copper and 67.5% of the gold 

into a copper flotation concentrate that contained 14.2% Cu and 1,119 g/t Au. 

Cyanide leach testwork was conducted on the flotation tailings from the selective copper flotation tests 

(tests GS0114 to GS0116) and the results of these tests are summarized in Table 13-3. Cyanide 

leaching of the flotation tailing from the Am Veio 1 test sample resulted in the extraction of 61.6% of 

the gold contained in the flotation tailing. This represents an overall gold recovery from flotation 

followed by cyanide leaching of about 87.5%.

13.1.2 Gravity Concentration Testwork 

Knelson Research and Technology Centre, Canada, conducted a gravity recoverable gold (GRG) test 

on a sample of Palito mill feed ore. The results of the GRG test are shown in Table 13-4. The overall 

gold recovery after three stages of grinding was 43.3%, produced in a concentrate mass of 1.4%. The 

calculated head grade of the sample was 5.0 g/t Au with a final gravity tail grade of 2.9 g/t Au. A plot 

of cumulative gold recovery for each stage versus particle size is shown in Figure 13-1. Although very 

encouraging results were achieved by this testwork, gravity recovery was not included in the process 

plant flowsheet, due to concerns regarding the effect on flotation concentrate gold grades, and 

concentrate sales.

13.1.4 Historical Plant Production 

The results of metallurgical studies on Palito ore were used as the basis for constructing a process 

plant that included crushing, grinding, copper flotation and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) cyanidation of the 

copper flotation tailings. Historical plant production results for the period 2005 to 2007 are shown in 

Table 13-6. Overall gold recoveries (flotation + CIP) of 90% to 92% were reported from Palito ore 

containing 5.0 to 12 g/t Au. Copper recoveries of 81% to 94% into copper flotation concentrates 

containing 21% to 29% Cu were reported.

13.2 São Chico Ore Testing and Procedures 
Metallurgical studies were conducted by SGS Mineral Services- Lakefield (SGS) on samples of São 

Chico ore during 2012 and 2013. The results of these studies are fully documented in the following 

reports: 

 "The Recovery of Gold from the São Chico Gold Project", SGS, April 4, 2012; and 
 "The Recovery of Gold from the São Chico Gold Project", SGS, May 17, 2013. 

13.2.1 2012 Metallurgical Program 

The 2012 metallurgical program on São Chico ore was conducted to evaluate the processing 

characteristics of the São Chico ore and to develop a preliminary processing flowsheet. The program 

included ore characterization, as well as the evaluation of a number of processing options, including; 

gravity separation, flotation and cyanidation. 

Sample Characterization 

The metallurgical program was conducted on three metallurgical composites identified as N-1, N-2 

and N-3, which were blended in equal proportions to formulate a Master composite. Gold head 

analyses for these test composites are shown in Table 13-7 and the results of multi-element analyses 

on each composite are shown in Table 13-8. The master composite contained 57.5 g/t Au, which are 

significantly higher than ore grades of 6 to 10 g/t Au that are typical from the São Chico Mine. As such, 

the master composite cannot be considered fully representative. It is also noted that in contrast to the 

Palito ore, São Chico ore contains very little copper.

Gravity Separation Testwork 

The potential for gold recovery from the master composite by gravity concentration was evaluated at 

grind sizes of approximately 80% passing (P80) 100 and 75 µm with a Knelson MD-3 centrifugal 

concentrator as the primary gravity gold unit. The gravity concentrate produced from the Knelson 

concentrator was further upgraded on a Mozley mineral separator targeting an overall mass pull of 

0.1%. The results of the gravity concentration tests are presented in Table 13-10 where overall gravity 

gold recoveries of 21.6% to 28.4% into gravity concentrates containing 23,010 to 27,515 g/t Au are 

reported. The Knelson and Mozley tailings were combined for subsequent cyanidation testwork.

Cyanidation Testwork 

Cyanidation tests were conducted on master composite gravity tailing and whole-ore samples at grind 

sizes ranging from about P80 75 to 150 µm. Standard bottle roll test conditions included: 

 Slurry density:  40% solids (w/w); 
 pH:   10.5 to 11.0 (maintained with lime); 
 Cyanide Concentration: 0.5 g/L NaCN (maintained); and 
 Retention Time:  48 hours (with subsamples at 6 and 24 hours). 

The results of whole-ore cyanidation tests are summarized in Table 13-11 and the results of 

cyanidation tests on the gravity tailing are summarized in Table 13-12. Overall gold recoveries for both 

whole-ore cyanidation and gravity + cyanidation of the gravity tailing were similar at about 99%. Grind

ranged from about 0.71 to 1.85 kg/t with a definite trend for increasing consumption as the grind size

Flotation Testwork 

Flotation testwork conducted on the São Chico master composite is not presented since the São Chico 

ore is not being processed by flotation. 

13.2.2 2013 Metallurgical Program 

The metallurgical test program conducted by SGS in 2013 consisted of the following: 

 Extended gravity recoverable gold (E-GRG) testing to generate parameters necessary for 
gravity circuit design; 

 Gravity recovery testing using a Knelson centrifugal concentrator followed by upgrading on a 
Mozley table; and 

 Flotation optimization testwork. 

Subsequent to this test program, it was determined that the São Chico ore would be processed by a 

combination of gravity concentration and CIP cyanidation of the gravity tailings. As such, the extensive 

flotation testwork that was conducted is not considered relevant and is not presented. 

Sample Characterization 

The metallurgical test program was conducted on a single master composite that was formulated by 

blending 265 kg of sub-composite A with 65 kg of sub-composite B. Sub-composite A was created 

from three separate samples labeled N-4, N-5 and N-6, and sub-composite B was created from three 

separate samples labeled N-11.1, N-13.2 and N-14.2. Table 13-13 shows the gold head analyses for 

sub-composites A (8.59 g/t Au) and B (79.4 g/t Au), which were combined to formulate the master 

composite that contained 23.2 g/t Au and 30.8 g/t Ag. Table 13-14 shows the multi-element analyses

for the master composite. This composite is distinctly different from the São Chico composite that was 

tested by SGS in 2012 in that it contains significantly higher lead (3.52% Pb) and zinc (0.86% Zn). The 

reason for this difference is not known.

Gravity Recoverable Gold Testwork 

An extended gravity recoverable gold (E-GRG) test was conducted on the master composite to assess 

the amount of gravity recoverable gold in the sample and to generate data required for circuit modeling 

and design. The results of this test are summarized in Table 13-15 and show that the sample was 

highly amenable gold recovery by gravity concentration with a GRG value of 65.8.

Gravity Concentration Testwork 

A series of four 10 kg gravity concentration tests were run on the master composite. Each gravity 

concentration test was conducted at a grind size of P80 243 µm with a Knelson MD-3 centrifugal 

concentrator followed by upgrading of the Knelson gravity concentrate on a Mozley table. The results 

of these tests are presented in Table 13-16 and show that 23.4% to 27.5% of the gold was recovered 

into gravity concentrates ranging from 7,505 to 14,121 g/t Au. This is very similar to the gravity 

concentration test results that were performed during SGS's 2012 test program where 24.8% to 28.4% 

of the gold was recovered into the gravity concentrate.

At the present time, Serabi's process plant does not effectively detoxify the cyanide leach residues, 

and has undertaken studies to design an effective detoxification circuit that will consistently detoxify 

leach residues to <5 ppm CNWAD (weak acid dissociable cyanide). To this end, cyanide detoxification 

studies using the industry-standard SO2/Air detoxification process were conducted on leach residues

from Serabi's process plant by Testwork Desenevolvimento de Processo Ltda (Testwork), and the 

results are fully documented in their report, "Testes De Labortorio De Neutralizacao De Cianeto 

Utilzando Processo SO2/O2", October 12, 2015. The objective of the program was to define the process 

conditions required to reduce cyanide to <5 ppm CNWAD. The results of this test program were provided 

to Gekko Systems (Gekko) for review and are summarized in Table 13-17 and fully documented in 

their report, "Palito Gold Mine Cyanide Destruction Circuit Design Review and Process Design 

Criteria", February 17, 2016. 

Based on their review of Testwork's test results, Gekko concluded that tests T3 and T4 consistently 

achieved about 3 to 4 ppm CNWAD, in the detoxified leach residue indicating that the correct SO2 
addition is above 4.0 g SO2/g CN and that a design allowing additions of up to 4.5 g SO2/g CN is 

recommended to cope with natural variations. Based on their review, Gekko developed the process 

design criteria installation of an effective cyanide detoxification circuit at Serabi's process plant.

13.4 Sample Representativeness 
The samples of Palito and São Chico ore used for metallurgical testing and process development 

appear to have represented the mineral character of the ores, but the test samples tended to be much 

higher grade than the ore grades that would actually be mined. Additionally, the specific locations from 

where the samples used for metallurgical studies were taken were not identified in the documents 

reviewed by SRK. In spite of this issue, actual plant performance has been consistent with the results 

obtained from the metallurgical studies on the samples that were tested. 

13.5 Significant Factors 
The following significant factors have been identified: 

 Both the Palito and São Chico ores are highly amenable to conventional processing 
techniques to recover the contained metal values; 

 Palito ore is processed using a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, copper flotation and 
CIP cyanidation of the copper flotation tailings; 

 São Chico ore is processed using a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, gravity 
concentration and cyanidation of both the gravity concentrate and the gravity tailing; 

 Plant performance as presented in Section 17 is similar to the results predicted from the 
metallurgical test program, even though the metallurgical test samples cannot be considered 

fully representative of the ore actually fed to Serabi's process plant; and 

 Serabi has tested and designed a new cyanide detoxification circuit to replace the existing 
circuit which has not performed as planned.

14 Mineral Resource Estimate  
14.1 Introduction 

The Mineral Resources for the Palito Mining Complex comprise the Palito Mine and the São Chico 

Mine, both mined by underground mining methods. The Mineral Resource Statement presented herein 

represents the second and first mineral resource evaluation prepared by Serabi for the Palito and São 

Chico mines, respectively, in accordance with NI 43-101. A previous NI 43-101 Technical Report that 

documented the mineral resources for the Palito Mine was prepared in 2012 by NCL Ingeniería y 

Construcción Ltda from Chile. 

The mineral resource estimates prepared by Serabi for the Palito Mine considers core drilling and 

underground chip sampling by Serabi generated during the period mid-2002 to May 2017. For the São 

Chico Mine, the mineral resource estimates, also prepared by Serabi, considers core drilling and chip 

sampling by Serabi and previous operators during the period September 2011 to March 2017. The 

resource estimation work was completed by Serabi's mine geology department under the supervision 

of Mike Hodgson, CEO at Serabi and reviewed by Dr. David Machuca, Senior Consultant with SRK, 

and Glen Cole PGeo (APGO#1416), Principal Consultant with SRK. Mr. Cole is an appropriate 

independent Qualified Person as this term is defined in NI 43-101. The effective date of the Mineral 

Resource Statements is June 30, 2017. 

This section describes the resource estimation methodology and summarizes the key assumptions 

considered by Serabi. In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable 

representation of the global gold mineral resources found at the Palito Mining Complex at the current 

level of sampling. The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted 

CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines and are reported 

in accordance with NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have not demonstrated 

economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted 

into mineral reserve. 

The databases used to estimate the Palito and São Chico mines mineral resources were audited by 

SRK. SRK believes the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence 

the boundaries for gold mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support 

mineral resource estimation. 

Serabi used a traditional polygonal estimation method in 2D sections to evaluate the mineral resources 

of both mines. AutoCAD software was used to define the 2D longitudinal sections and the calculations 

were performed in Microsoft Excel.  

SRK generated parallel geostatistically-based three-dimensional mineral resource models in Datamine 

Studio, using an ordinary kriging estimator for the main mineralized structures of São Chico and the 

G3 vein at Palito for mineral resource validation purposes. 

14.2 Resource Estimation Procedures 
The resource evaluation methodology involved the following procedures: 

 Database compilation and verification; 
 Design / update of polygons in the 2D sections for each vein; 
 Data analysis and capping of grades;

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

 Identification of samples adjacent or within each polygon; 
 Calculations of area, average thickness, average grades and tonnage of each polygon; 
 Resource classification; 
 Assessment of "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" and selection of 

appropriate CoGs; and 

 Preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement. 

14.3 Resource Database 

14.3.1 Palito Mine 

The Palito database received on May 25, 2017 contains 582 surface drill holes (98,346.5 m, 27,763 

samples), 458 underground drill holes (27,766 m, 7985 samples), 74 reverse circulation holes 

(4,406 m, 4,050 samples), 328 rotary air blast holes (4,327 m, 1,943 samples), 22,598 channel 

samples taken from underground developments, 315 channel samples taken from chimneys, 

1,277 face samples taken from stopes for grade control purposes, and 2,452 surface trench samples. 

The database includes codes of 45 different sampled mineralized structures; however, the mineral 

resources estimation was completed only for 26 of them. The veins that were not considered in the 

current mineral resource estimates present low gold grades and are small, and poorly recognized.  

Table 14-1 contains the summary gold and copper grade statistics per sample types for all veins 

combined. Table 14-2 contains comparable statistics to Table 14-1, but combining all different data 

types for each of the 26 vein structures that are reported in the mineral resources statement. Only the 

data that were considered in the mineral resource estimation were included for the statistics in these 

two tables. Samples with no vein code taken in barren rock and samples within non-estimated 

mineralized structures are not considered in either table.

14.3.2 São Chico Mine 

The São Chico database received on May 24, 2017 contains 108 surface drill holes (16,747 m, 4,960 

samples), 168 underground drill holes (8,870 m, 1,925 samples), 3,222 channel samples taken from 

underground developments, and 684 face samples taken from stopes. Table 14-3 shows the data 

used for mineral resource estimation of the São Chico Mine. The data comprises the samples within 

the principal shear zone as well within other three minor mineralized structures called Highway, Julia 

and Vania. Copper mineralization generally occurs at grades too low for economic interest, therefore 

Serabi decided not to estimate copper mineral resources for the São Chico Mine. SRK agrees with 

this decision.

14.4 Data Analysis and Evaluation of Outliers 
SRK performed the capping analysis of raw gold assays within mineralized structures of both deposits 

per sample type. For Palito, each vein was analyzed separately, whereas for São Chico, only the 

samples within the principal shear zone were analyzed. Table 14-4 presents the summary capping 

statistics for all sample types combined within the different veins of Palito. Overall, 3% of samples 

were capped and the capping impact on the global gold mean is a reduction of around 23%. Copper 

grades in Palito, were capped in a block basis using the copper mean grade plus the standard as 

capping thresholds.

Table 14-5 presents the summary capping statistics for São Chico. Only those samples within the 

principal shear zone were used in the capping analysis. The resulting capping thresholds, however, 

were applied to the gold grades of the minor structures. No capping analysis was performed for copper 

grades in São Chico.

Compositing was not required in the mineral resources estimation of neither mine since gold and 

copper sample grades were weighted by the sample length in the estimation of the polygons average 

grades. 

14.5 Design of Polygons in 2D sections 
Mineral resource polygons or blocks are defined as parallelograms in 2D vertical sections projected 

perpendicularly to the strike of each vein. The polygons height is usually defined by the vertical 

separation between existing or planned mine levels or sublevels. Mine levels are separated vertically 

by 30 m, approximately, and sublevels tend to be located 15 m above levels. Polygons located outside 

existing mine levels tend to be much taller. In Palito the maximum polygon height is 166 m, whereas 

in São Chico it is 129 m. The length of polygons located between existing mine levels in both mines is 

30 m in average. 

Outside existing mine levels, polygons can be up to 400 m in length in Palito and up to 156 m length 

in São Chico. As discussed in Section 14.8, the largest polygons in both mines are normally classified 

as inferred resources. Polygons outside existing mine levels cover areas of the veins intersected by 

bore holes.  

The areas of individual polygons are corrected factors calculated as a function of the vein dip to 

account for the distortion resulting of the vertical projection of the vein plane. The dips of Palito veins 

vary from 76° to 90°, with an average of 86°. In São Chico, the average vein dip is 82°. Being that the 

veins in both deposits are almost vertical, the correction factors applied to the polygons areas results 

in an overall area increase of only 1%.  

14.6 Tonnage and Grade Estimation 
The corrected polygons areas are multiplied times average length of the channels and mineralized 

drillhole intersections to obtain the polygons volumes. The polygons tonnages are estimated using 

uniform density values of 2.70 and 2.71 for all polygons in the Palito and São Chico mines, 

respectively. 

The estimated gold grades for each polygon is calculated as length-weighted averages of the capped 

grades of channel samples in limiting mine levels and stope crowns, of drillhole intersections and, in a 

few cases, of surface trenches. The weighting of grades does not distinguish between different sample 

types. Samples taken from rotary air blast drill holes are not considered in the mineral resource 

estimation. Polygon copper grades are estimated in a similar way as gold grades, but only for Palito 

Mine. No modifying factor is further applied to the estimated mineral resources grades and tonnages.

14.7 Model Validation  
SRK audited the areas, volumes and estimated grades of the estimated polygons generated by Serabi 

for both the Palito and São Chico mines. In addition, as part of the auditing and validation process, 

SRK generated, in parallel, three -dimensional, geostatistically-based mineral resource models for G3 

vein in Palito and for the São Chico structure for benchmarking purposes. The modeled validation 

models match within 5% of the estimated contained gold metal content for Measured mineral 

resources in both models. 

An illustration of the modeled domains of the G3 Vein at Palito is shown in Figure 14-1, whereas an 

illustration of the modeled São Chico Mineralized structure is shown in Figure 14-2.

14.8 Mineral Resource Classification 
Tonnage and grade estimates for the Palito and São Chico mines were classified by Mr. Renan 

Quintanilla and Mr. Juan Rojas, respectively, according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014). Mr. Quintanilla and Mr. Rojas are both Serabi Mine 

Geologists. The mineral resources estimation and classification was reviewed by Dr. David Machuca 

from SRK, under the supervision of Glen Cole PGeo (Principal Consultant APGO#1416), an 

appropriate independent Qualified Person for the purpose of NI 43-101.

Mineral resource classification is typically a subjective concept. Industry best practices suggest that 

resource classification should consider the confidence in the geological continuity of the mineralized 

structures, the quality and quantity of exploration data supporting the estimates, and the geostatistical 

confidence in the tonnage and grade estimates. Appropriate classification criteria should aim at 

integrating these concepts to delineate regular areas at similar resource classification. 

Serabi is satisfied that the geological modelling honors the current geological information and 

knowledge. The location of the samples and the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support resource 

evaluation. The sampling information was acquired primarily by closely spaced channel samples taken 

from underground developments, and surface and underground core drilling and secondarily by 

reverse circulation drilling and surface trench samples.  

Generally, polygons for which mineralization has been exposed and sampled in one or more of their 

sides along underground workings such as mining levels, stope crowns and raises, are classified in 

the Measured Category within the meaning of the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 

Mineral Reserves. Polygons classified in the Indicated resources are next to Measured Mineral 

Resource polygons but their mineralization is defined by at least two borehole intersections spaced at 

50 m or less (Table 14-6). In São Chico, these polygons extend up to 15 m from their contact with a 

Measured Resource polygon. In Palito, their vertical extent from the limit with a Measured Mineral 

Resource polygon is generally about 30 m. Sometimes the Indicated Mineral Resource polygons in 

Palito may have heights of up to 50 m, if they are intersected by several closely spaced boreholes 

spanning the polygon area. With the aim to avoid abrupt changes in the mineral resource confidence, 

Indicated Mineral resources polygons were located between Measured and Inferred resources

polygons. Polygons classified as in the Inferred category contain borehole intersections than can be 

spaced by more than 50 m. Generally, their maximum extent is 60 m in the vertical and horizontal 

directions, but sometimes they can be larger if intersected by more than one borehole. The confidence 

in the estimates of these polygons is insufficient to allow for the meaningful application of technical 

and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability.

14.9 Mineral Resource Statement 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) defines a mineral 

resource as: 

"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in 

or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction. 

The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a 

Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and 

knowledge, including sampling." 

The "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the 

quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources are 

reported at an appropriate CoG that considers extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. To 

meet this requirement, Serabi considers that major portions of the Palito and São Chico deposits are 

amenable for underground mining extraction.

The polygonal quantities and grade estimates were reviewed by SRK to determine the portions of the 

Palito and São Chico mines having "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" from an 

underground mine, based on a CoG of 3.10 g/t gold at the Palito Mine and 2.85 g/t gold at the São 

Chico Mine, assuming a gold price of US$1,500/oz, and metallurgical gold recovery of 91% and 95% 

respectively. The reporting parameters were selected based on production experience on the project. 

Serabi considers that the polygonal estimates show "reasonable prospects for eventual economic 

extraction" and can be reported as a Mineral Resource. Serabi is unaware of any environmental, 

permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant issues that may 

materially affect the Mineral Resource. However, the Mineral Resource may be affected by further infill 

and exploration drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent Mineral Resource 

estimates. The Mineral Resource Statement may also be affected by subsequent assessments of 

mining, environmental, processing, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, and other factors. 

Condensed Mineral Resource Statements for the Palito and São Chico mines are tabulated in Table 

14-7 and Table 14-8 respectively. A detailed Mineral Resource Statement for the underground mining 

components of the Palito and São Chico mines are tabulated in Table 14-9 and Table 14-10 

respectively. The effective date of these Mineral Resource Statements is June 30, 2017.

14.10 Grade Sensitivity Analysis 
The mineral resources of the Palito and São Chico mines are sensitive to the selection of the reporting 

CoG. To illustrate this sensitivity, the measured plus indicated mineral resources quantities and grade 

estimates are presented at different CoGs in Table 14-10 and Table 14-11 for the Palito and São Chico 

mines, respectively. The reader is cautioned that the figures presented in Table 14-10 and Table 14-11 

should not be misconstrued with a Mineral Resource Statement. The figures are only presented to 

show the sensitivity of the polygonal estimates to the selection of CoG.  

Figure 14-3 and Figure 14-4 present these sensitivities as grade tonnage curves for the Measured and 

Indicated portions of Palito and São Chico mines, respectively.

15 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

15.1 Conversion Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 
Mineral resources are converted to mineral reserves using the assumptions, parameters and methods 

discussed in the following subsections. Mineral reserves are reported for a total of 17 veins at the 

Palito Mine, the locations of which are shown in Figure 15-1. At the São Chico Mine, mineral reserves 

are reported from one vein (the principal São Chico vein). 

 

Source: Serabi, 2017 

Figure 15-1: Palito Mine Veins Included in Mineral Reserves 

 

Some veins that contain Measured and Indicated mineral resources (refer to Table 14-9) do not host 

mineral resource polygons that could be converted to mineral reserves. This is primarily because of 

the application of mining dilution and the use of a CoG for mineral reserves that is higher than the CoG 

used for mineral resources. The CoG determination is discussed in Section 15.1.3.

15.1.1 Gold Price, Currency Exchange and Metallurgical Recovery Assumptions 

The gold price, currency exchange and metallurgical recovery assumptions for mineral reserves are 

shown in Table 15-1. Gold price was guided by the June 2017 monthly average price and the 3-year 

trailing average as of June 2017. Currency exchange (Brazilian Reals to U.S. Dollars) is based on the 

three-year trailing average exchange rate as of June 2017. Metallurgical recovery is based on the six-

month average plant recovery for January - June 2017.

Selectivity (i.e., resue blasting) is a technique whereby Serabi isolates and blasts waste rock in a 

development drift separately from the mineralized vein. This has the effect of excluding a portion of 

the waste from the mill feed. The selectivity percentages listed in Table 15-2 are based on Serabi's 

historic mining records. 

The minimum mining width of 0.9 m is applied to Measured and Indicated resources that will be 

extracted by shrinkage stoping. The minimum mining width for development drifts in ore is 3.0 m wide

by 3.0 m high. Dilution that is incorporated into the mineral reserves as a result of applying the 

minimum mining width criteria is referred to as planned dilution. 

Unplanned (external) mining dilution in the shrinkage stopes is applied as 0.1 m of overbreak on the 

hanging wall and footwall. A grade of zero g/t Au has been applied to the overbreak material. The 

overbreak allowance is based on Serabi's survey measurements of actual shrinkage stope widths 

relative to in situ vein widths. 

The resultant planned and unplanned mining dilution for each of the veins is shown in Table 15-3.

Mining recovery is accounted for initially by excluding the mineral resources that will not be mined 

because some material must be left in place as rib and sill pillars to maintain geotechnical stability 

around the shrinkage stopes. A further adjustment is applied to account for resources that will not be 

recovered for reasons that include under-blasting and failure of blasted ore to flow to the extraction 

level. In stopes that are less than 15 m high, a mining recovery of 95% is assumed. In stopes that are 

greater than 15 m high, mining recovery of 75% is assumed. Serabi's experience has been that 

shrinkage stopes greater than 15 m high experience challenges with ore flow and deteriorating ground 

conditions more frequently than stopes that are less than 15 m high. 

São Chico Mine 

At the São Chico Mine the following mining parameters were used to convert Measured and Indicated 

resources to mineral reserves: 

 No selectivity (i.e., resue blasting) was assumed; 
 The minimum mining width for both development mining in ore and longhole stoping is 3.5 m; 
 An overbreak/slough allowance of 0.50 m is applied to both the footwall and hangingwall of 

longhole stopes; 

 Mining recovery is accounted for initially by excluding the mineral resources that will not be 
mined because some material must be left in place as rib and sill pillars to maintain

geotechnical stability around the longhole stopes. A further adjustment (mining recovery of 

95%) is applied to account for resources that will not be recovered for reasons that include 

under-blasting and failure of blasted ore to flow to the extraction level. 

Based on the parameters listed above, the resultant average mining dilution is:  

 Average planned mining dilution due to the application of minimum mining width = 79%; 
 Average unplanned mining dilution due to overbreak/slough = 43%; and 
 Overall average dilution (planned plus unplanned) = 123%. 

15.1.3 CoG Calculation 

The CoG calculation for mineral reserves takes into consideration the gold price, currency exchange 

rate, and metallurgical recovery inputs detailed in Table 15-1, along with the operating costs that are 

presented in Table 15-4. 

Table 15-4: Operating Cost Basis for the CoG Calculation 

Unit Operating Costs Units Palito São Chico 
Mining R$/t-processed  259  248  
Processing R$/t-processed 164  162  
Corporate Office Support to Site R$/t-processed 33  39  
Royalties, CFEM, Treatment, Shipping, and By-Product Credits R$/t-processed 19  12  
Total Unit Cost R$/t-processed 474  460  
Total Unit Cost (US$:R$ exchange rate of 3.5:1.0) US$/t-processed 135  132  
Source: Serabi, 2017 

  

The operating costs presented in Table 15-4 are based on Serabi's actual reported costs for the period 

January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017. 

The CoGs for mineral reserves are therefore: 

 Palito Mine mineral reserves CoG: 3.70 g/t Au; and 
 São Chico Mine mineral reserves CoG: 3.45 g/t Au. 

For the mineral resources CoGs, the gold price was increased to US$1,500/oz. No other changes 

were made for the mineral resources CoG calculation, resulting in the following CoGs for mineral 

resources: 

 Palito Mine mineral resources CoG: 3.10 g/t Au; and 
 São Chico Mine mineral resources CoG: 2.85 g/t Au. 

15.1.4 Conversion Methodology 

Measured and Indicated mineral resources polygons were evaluated for conversion to mineral 

reserves based on the parameters and assumptions described in Section 15.1 herein. Proven mineral 

reserves are reported within the Measured classification domain, and Probable mineral reserves are 

reported within the Indicated classification domain. The steps used to adjust the eligible polygons for 

mining dilution and mining recovery are: 

(1) All Inferred polygons were excluded from consideration (i.e., only Measured and Indicated 

polygons were used); 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 99 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

(2) Rib and sill pillars were removed to maintain geotechnical stability around the planned stopes; 

(3) Minimum mining width was applied to stopes and development in ore (this step incorporates 

planned dilution); 

(4) Overbreak/slough was applied to the stopes (this step incorporates unplanned dilution); 

(5) Selectivity (i.e., resue blasting) was applied to ore development (Palito Mine only); and 

(6) Mining recovery was applied to the stopes. 

The adjusted polygons were then filtered based on the mineral reserves CoGs as specified in Section 

15.1.3. All polygons meeting or exceeding the mineral reserves CoG were evaluated for inclusion in 

the life-of-mine production schedule (Table 16-1). The scheduling evaluation included consideration 

of unique development requirements for each polygon (ramp access, footwall accesses, and 

ventilation infrastructure).  

Serabi has a limited quantity of surface stockpiles and historic flotation tailings which have been 

included as Proven mineral reserves (Table 15-5). These Proven mineral reserves are reported at a 

CoG of 1.95 g/t gold assuming a gold price of US$1,250/oz, a 3.5:1 Brazilian Real to U.S. Dollar 

exchange rate, and metallurgical recovery of 78%. 

The Palito and São Chico Mineral Reserves based on the mining and milling production schedule are 

presented in Table 15-5 and Table 15-6, respectively. 

Under NI 43-101 rules, producing issuers may exclude the information required in Section 22 

Economic Analysis on properties currently in production, unless the Technical Report includes a 

material expansion of current production. Serabi is a producing issuer, the Palito Mining Complex is 

currently in production, and a material expansion is not being planned. Serabi completed economic 

analysis for the Palito Mining Complex based on the Mineral Reserves stated herein. SRK reviewed 

Serabi's analysis and we have verified that the outcome is a positive cash flow that supports the 

statement of Mineral Reserves.

16 Mining Methods 

16.1 Current Methods 
Palito Mine 

Mining of the narrow, near-vertical gold veins at the Palito Mine is undertaken using the shrinkage 

stoping method. Shrinkage stoping blocks (usually 30 m high) are defined on the bottom by horizontal 

development mining along the vein at a cross-sectional dimension of 3.0 m high by 3.0 m wide. A 

vertical raise is then driven to the top of the stoping block and ladders are installed so that men and 

materials can access the stope on each subsequent lift as mining advances upward.  

Stope mining progresses vertically beginning with the drilling of 1.8 m sub-vertical holes using hand-

held pneumatic drills (stopers). The drill holes are loaded with explosives and the blasted ore is left in 

the stope except to the extent it is necessary to draw down the rock to leave an adequate distance 

between the working floor and the back. The ore left in the stope supports the walls and no installed 

ground support is typically required. Serabi extracts the broken ore via a series of crosscuts that are 

driven in waste from a footwall access. After a stope is mined to its full height, LHD units are used to 

muck the remaining ore from the stope. The LHD units load 20 t haul trucks, which then transport the 

broken ore to the surface. Figure 16-1 and Figure 16-2 show the shrinkage stoping method as it is 

used at the Palito Mine.

São Chico Mine 

Mining of the steeply dipping vein at the São Chico Mine is by longitudinal longhole stoping methods 

using sublevels that are spaced at a nominal 15 m. Because structural backfill is not available and 

because mining takes place on multiple adjacent levels, rib and sill pillars are used to separate the ore 

blocks and maintain geotechnical stability. The top and bottom of each stope block is mined with 

horizontal development using a drift cross-section of 3.5 m high by 3.5 m wide. Longholes are drilled 

between levels and blasthole rings are fired in the direction of a conventionally driven slot raise that is 

mined on one end of the stope. Ore is mucked from the longhole stopes using LHD units. The LHD 

units load 20 t haul trucks, which then transport the broken ore to the surface. Once the ore reaches 

the surface, it is transported by road (approximately 30 km one way) from the São Chico Mine to the 

processing plant at the Palito site.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

Although Serabi has used a minimum mining width of 3.5 m for the purposes of converting mineral 

resources to mineral reserves, the Company has demonstrated the ability to mine narrower than 3.5 

m with the longhole stoping method.  

Geotechnical 

Stope widths at the Palito Mine are typically narrow (0.9 m to 1.5 m wide) and the shrinkage method 

provides support for the stope walls until the last lift of the stope is completed and the ore is drawn 

down. Ground conditions are generally very good and ground support typically is not required in the 

stopes. However, because Serabi concurrently mines on vertically adjacent levels, 3.0 m thick 

horizontal sill pillars are left at the crown of the shrink stoping blocks in some instances. Similarly, 3.0 

m thick rib pillars are used to separate horizontally adjacent stopes. As discussed in Section 15, 

appropriate adjustments have been included in the resource to reserve conversion to account for 

Serabi's use of rib and sill pillars at the Palito Mine. 

At the São Chico Mine, longhole stopes are typically 3.5 m wide. Ground conditions are generally 

good, but stoping results to date show the potential for blasting overbreak and hanging- and footwall 

slough. Accordingly, the mineral reserves include an allowance of 0.5 m of overbreak/slough for both 

the hangingwall and the footwall. Because structural backfill is not available and because mining takes 

place on horizontally and vertically adjacent blocks, rib and sill pillars (both 3.0 m thick) are used to 

separate the ore blocks and maintain geotechnical stability. As discussed in Section 15, appropriate 

adjustments have been included in the resource to reserve conversion to account for Serabi's use of 

rib and sill pillars at the São Chico Mine.  

16.2 Mine Production Schedule 
The LoM production schedule based on Mineral Reserves is presented in Table 16-1. The average 

annual processing rate ranges between 264 t/d and 569 t/d (LoM average is 436 t/d). LoM primary 

development in waste (e.g., ramps, footwall accesses and raises) is 9,616 m for the Palito Mine and 

838 m for the São Chico Mine. Ore mining in the Palito Mine continues until November 2021 whereas 

mining in the São Chico Mine ends in June 2019.

17 Recovery Methods  

17.1 Processing Methods 
Serabi operates a 500 t/d plant to process ore from both the Palito and São Chico mines. Palito 

ore is processed through a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, copper flotation and carbon-

in-pulp (CIP) cyanidation of gold and silver values from the copper flotation tailing. The São Chico 

ore is processed in a separate grinding circuit that includes gravity concentration and intensive 

cyanide leaching of the gravity concentrate. The São Chico gravity tailing is combined and 

processed with the Palito copper flotation tailing in the CIP cyanidation circuit. In addition to Palito 

and São Chico ore, old flotation tailing stockpiles, which contain about 2.6 to 3.6 g/t Au, are 

processed by directly feeding this material into the CIP circuit. Gold and silver values extracted in 

the CIP circuit are adsorbed onto activated carbon. The "loaded" carbon is then eluted to remove 

the adsorbed gold and silver values into an upgraded solution that flows through electrowinning 

cells to recover gold and silver as a cathodic precipitate, which is then fluxed and smelted to 

produce a final doré product. A simplified process flowsheet is shown in Figure 17-1 and a list of 

major equipment is shown in Table 17-1.

17.2 Process Description 

17.2.1 Crushing 

Stockpiled run-of-mine (ROM) ore is fed to the crushing circuit at an average rate of 23 t/h using a 

front-end wheel loader. The ore is fed to a jaw crusher using a vibratory grizzly where it is crushed to 

a nominal size of 60 mm. A conveyor transports the primary crushed ore to a double-deck vibrating 

screen with a top deck screen size of 30 mm and a bottom deck screen size of 15 mm. The +30 mm 

material reports to the secondary crusher and the -30 mm+15 mm material reports to two tertiary 

crushers operating in parallel. The secondary and tertiary crushers are operated in closed circuit with 

the double-deck screen and are set to produce a product of less than 15 mm. The final minus 15 mm 

product is transported via a stacker conveyor to crushed ore stockpiles. 

Due to the high variability of the Palito and São Chico ROM ore, material from each front and stope in 

both the mines is crushed separately on a batch basis and stockpiled individually. The crushed ore 

product from each batch is sampled as it falls onto the product conveyor. After analysis of each sample, 

the separate stockpiles are blended using a front-end wheel loader in such a way as to produce a 

consistent mill feed blend. The ore is blended as it is loaded into trucks, which are then weighed and 

transported to mill feed stockpiles 

17.2.2 Grinding 

Palito and São Chico ores are transported and loaded into separate 200 t fine ore bins at the process 

plant. Both Palito and São Chico ore are weighed as they are conveyed to the grinding circuit and 

sampled every 30 minutes with automatic cross-cut samplers. Palito ore is fed to two ball mills (2.3 m 

diameter x 3.1 m long and 2.1 m diameter x 3.4 m long) operating in parallel and in closed circuit with 

250 mm diameter cyclones to produce a final ground product size of 80% passing (P80) 120 µm which 

is then conditioned and fed to the copper flotation circuit. São Chico ore is fed to one ball mill (2.1 m 

diameter x 3.4 m long) operated in closed circuit with a Falcon SB-750B centrifugal concentrator and 

a 250 mm diameter cyclone to produce a final grind size of P80 120 µm which is advanced directly to 

the CIP cyanidation circuit along with the Palito copper flotation tailing.  

17.2.3 Intensive Leaching 

The gravity concentrate produced from the São Chico ore with the Falcon centrifugal concentrator is 

discharged to a 4 t hopper and then leached in 800 kg batches in a Gekko In-line Leach Reactor 

(ILR150) for 24 hours. Leaching is accomplished in a cyanide solution that is maintained at a 

concentration 1.5% NaCN along with the addition 200 L of hydrogen peroxide per batch. The leach 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 112 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

solution from the ILR is circulated through a separate electrowinning cell (Como 600 x 600 x 9 

cathodes) located in the gold room to recover the contained gold as a cathodic precipitate. The doré 

produced from the São Chico gravity concentrate contains high levels of lead, which is the result of 

leaching oxidized lead minerals in the ILR. Although this has not been an issue with the refiner, Serabi 

is currently reviewing options for reducing the lead content of the doré produced from the São Chico 

gravity concentrate. 

17.2.4 Flotation 

The flotation circuit consists of two conditioning tanks followed by rougher, scavenger, and cleaner 

cells. A thionocarbamate collector (A3894) for selective copper flotation is added to the conditioner 

tank feed. Lime is added in the grinding circuit to maintain pH at 10 -11. Methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) 

is added, as needed, as the frother. 

The rougher-scavenger flotation circuit consists of two duplex cells, each with a capacity of 3.2 m3, 

which provide a flotation retention time of 10 to 12 minutes. The product from the first rougher cell is 

regarded as the rougher flotation concentrate and is advanced to one stage of cleaner flotation. The 

product from the remaining rougher-scavenger cells is regarded as scavenger concentrate, which is 

recycled back to the conditioning tanks at the head of the circuit. Rougher flotation concentrate is 

upgraded in one stage of cleaner flotation to produce a copper concentrate containing greater than 

20% copper and into which about 50% to 70% of the gold contained in the Palito ore is recovered. 

Scavenger tails are pumped to the CIP cyanidation circuit to recover the remaining gold values. The 

cleaner flotation concentrate is filtered in two Netzche filter presses, each with a capacity of 300 kg/hr. 

The filtered concentrate discharges directly from the filters into 1 t (wet) super-sacks. Typical moisture 

content of the concentrate is 7%. The bagged concentrate is shipped as 20 t lots for smelting. 

17.2.5 CIP Cyanidation 

The CIP cyanidation circuit consists of two 185 m3 mechanically agitated leach tanks and six 74 m3 

mechanically agitated adsorption tanks, which provide a total retention time of about 20 hours at a 

slurry density of 40% solids. Cyanide concentration is maintained at 250 ppm NaCN in the leach tanks, 

which is allowed to attenuate to about 100 ppm NaCN at the discharge of the adsorption tanks. The 

pH of the leach slurry is maintained at 10.5 to 11.0 with lime. Carbon in the adsorption tanks is 

maintained at a concentration of 20 g/L except for the first tank, which is maintained at a carbon 

concentration of 40 g/L to ensure that the tank continues to have carbon in it after loaded carbon is 

removed. 

Carbon is retained in adsorption tanks 1 to 6 by the use of inter-tank screens. Loaded carbon from 

adsorption tank 1 is removed every 12 hours and transferred to elution for removal of gold. After elution 

the barren carbon is returned to adsorption tank 6 and the carbon is advanced counter-currently to the 

pulp with the use of airlifts. 

17.2.6 Elution and Gold Refining 

Loaded carbon is passed over a screen and washed free of pulp with the pulp being returned to 

adsorption tank 1. The washed carbon is transferred to an acid wash column and washed with 2% 

hydrochloric acid solution. After acid washing the carbon is rinsed with water a number of times and 

then transferred to an elution column, with a nominal capacity of 1,500 kg. Elution is carried out by the 

Zadra process. Strip solution containing 2% caustic and 1% cyanide is heated to 1300 C and pumped 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 113 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

through the elution column, stripping the gold from the carbon. The pregnant solution then passes 

through an electrowinning cell where the gold precipitates onto steel wool cathodes. The barren 

solution from the electrowinning cell returns to a holding tank where it is recirculated back through the 

process until elution is complete. Each elution cycle is typically 24 hours. After elution the carbon is 

rinsed with water a number of times and then regenerated in a new carbon kiln. 

17.2.7 Carbon Regeneration 

A new 75 kg/hr Kemix carbon regeneration kiln was installed and made operational during December 

2016. This was a very important addition to the process as the carbon was being fouled by the flotation 

reagents and was losing ability to adsorb gold and was resulting in high soluble gold losses. The kiln 

is operated at 7500 C to ensure the complete removal of organic contaminants. 

17.2.8 Cyanide Detoxification 

Serabi has not been able to effectively detoxify the cyanide contained in the cyanide leach residue 

with the process that had originally been installed, and is currently designing a detoxification circuit 

based in the industry-standard SO2/Air process to reduce cyanide levels to <5 ppm CNWAD. The new 

cyanide detoxification circuit is expected to be operational by 2018 Q1. 

17.3 Consumable Requirements 
Process plant consumables are summarized in Table 17-2. The two major consumable items are 

sodium cyanide, representing almost 50% of the consumables cost, and grinding media, which 

represents about 20% of consumable cost. It should be noted that a carbon reactivation kiln was 

installed in December 2016 and that prior to this installation, carbon costs were relatively high due to 

excessive carbon fouling. During 2017, the process plant has been able to reactivate stockpiled carbon 

that had been fouled, and as such, new carbon has not been required during 2017.

17.5 Operating Results 
Serabi process plant production results for the period 2015 to 2017Q1 are presented in Table 17-4 

through Table 17-6. The following general observations can be made regarding plant production over 

this period: 

 Average reconciled Palito ore grade has declined from 8.514 g/t Au in 2015 to 6.54 g/t Au in 
2017 Q1;

 Average annual gold recovery from Palito ore has been consistent at about 91% during this 
period; 

 Average reconciled São Chico ore grade has increased from 6.88 g/t Au in 2015 to 9.35 g/t 
Au in 2017 Q1;  

 Average annual gold recovery from São Chico has increased from 87.1% in 2015 to 95.8% in 
2017 Q1; 

 In addition to Palito and São Chico ore, old flotation tailing stockpiles, which contain about 2.6 
to 3.6 g/t Au, are processed by directly feeding into the CIP circuit. Average annual gold 

recovery from the old flotation tailings has increased from 70.7% in 2015 to 84.4% in 2017 Q1.  

Metallurgical accounting of production from Palito and São Chico ores and the old flotation tailings is 

complicated by the fact that they are commingled in the CIP circuit. The basic metallurgical accounting 

procedure developed by Serabi includes the following: 

 Palito and São Chico ores are weighed separately by conveyor belt weightometers feeding 
the ball mills. 

 Palito and São Chico ore feed are sampled with automatic cross-cut samplers that are timed 
to take sample of the ball mill feed every 30 minutes to obtain ore feed grades to the process 

plant. All other sampling throughout the plant is performed manually. 

 Each ore source (Palito and São Chico) is processed through discrete parallel grinding circuits 
during which the tonnes of each source are recorded.  

 The Palito ore circuit proceeds to flotation following grinding, where gold recovered into the 
flotation concentrate is accounted to the Palito sourced ore.  

 The São Chico ore circuit includes a gravity gold recovery stage, where gold recovered by the 
gravity circuit is processed through an ILR (Inline Leach Reactor) and separate electrowinning 

cell and is accounted to the São Chico sourced ore.  

 Each of these circuits combine into the CIP (Carbon-In-Pulp) circuit along with old flotation 
tailings. Gold recovered by the CIP circuit is apportioned to each ore source according to the 

ratio of the assayed gold balance (mass x assayed feed grade of each source), measured and 

recorded on a daily basis. 

 Ore grades are reconciled based on actual gold production apportioned to each ore.

Table 17-7 shows a plant feed reconciliation analysis for the period from 2015 to 2017 Q1. Generally, 

reconciliation with measured plant feed grades has been poor. Since the beginning of 2016 Palito 

reconciled gold grades have been consistently about 7% to 20% lower than the measured plant feed 

grades. During this same period, the São Chico reconciled ore grades have been about 2% to 18% 

higher. In SRK's opinion there appears to be a bias in the ore feed sampling and/or the allocation of 

production between Palito and São Chico ores.

18.1.3 Process Support Facilities 

Serabi operates a 500 t/d plant to process ore from both the Palito and São Chico mines. Palito ore is 

processed through a flowsheet that includes crushing, grinding, copper flotation and carbon-in-pulp 

(CIP) cyanidation of gold and silver values from the copper flotation tailing. The São Chico ore is 

processed in a separate grinding circuit that includes gravity concentration and intensive cyanide 

leaching of the gravity concentrate.  

18.1.4 Camp 

Palito Mine 

There is full mining camp at the Palito Mine that consists of accommodation for 250 personnel, kitchen 

and dining facilities, offices, warehouses, maintenance facilities, and a guard house at the entrance to 

the site. Serabi provides a daily bus service for employees and contractors living in Jardim do Ouro 

and Moraes de Almeida. 

Fuel is stored on site in storage tanks with a capacity of 75,000 L of diesel. Fuel storage tanks are 

located in a contained fuel storage area. There is an explosives storage facility located away from 

the main offices.  

The mine has access to telephones, high speed broadband satellite internet, and radio 

communications. Serabi has built and operates a clinic and hospital at the Palito Mine. 

São Chico Mine 

There is full mining camp at the São Chico Mine that consists of accommodation for 100 personnel, 

kitchen and dining facilities, offices, warehouses, maintenance facilities, and a guard house at the 

entrance to the site. Serabi provides a daily bus service for employees and contractors living in Jardim 

do Ouro and Moraes de Almeida. 

Fuel is stored on site in storage tanks with a capacity of 35,000 L of diesel. Fuel storage tanks are 

located in a contained fuel storage area. There is an explosives storage facility located away from the 

main offices.  

The mine has access to telephones, high speed broadband satellite internet, and radio 

communications.  

18.1.5 Power Supply and Distribution 

Palito Mine 

Electrical power is provided from the local power grid though a 34.5 kV overland power line and by 

diesel generators to deliver approximately 1 million kWh/month. Electrical power from the grid normally 

costs about R$0.34/kWh, but during peak demand periods (6:30 to 9:30 pm Monday to Friday) grid 

power costs R$120-130/kWh. During these peak periods Serabi operates its own diesel generators to 

generate 380 V electrical power at an average cost of R$0.70/kWh. Serabi's power generator station 

includes the following:  

 Two Scania generators: 500 KVA each; 
 Four Scania generators: 700 KVA each; 
 Two Aggreko generators: 500 KVA each; and

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

 One Aggreko generator: 320 KVA. 

Diesel is stored in a 10 m3 diesel tank, which provides enough diesel for two days of continuous 

operation. Approximately 60% of Serabi's power needs are provided by on-site generators and 40% 

is provided from the grid. 

São Chico Mine 

The power requirement at São Chico is approximately 594 Kw (about 700 kVA), including the 

underground mine (437 kW), camp and village (94 kW) and surface support facilities (63 kW). The 

power is supplied by a diesel power house that includes three diesel gensets of 550 kVA (Maquigeral-

SDMO/Scania 47N) that operate in parallel with one as standby. 

18.1.6 Water Supply 

Water is an abundant resource in the area, and the current water supply system is not a limiting factor 

for operations at the Palito Mine or the São Chico Mine.  

The operation has a water supply system consisting of dams that contain water from the following 

sources:  

 Mine water that is pumped from the underground workings;  
 Recycled process water after neutralization and decantation; and  
 Rain water.  

The total process water requirement is 40 m3/hr, of which 80% is recycled from the tailings disposal 

areas (32 m3/hr) and 20% is from the fresh water dam (8 m3/hr).  

Fresh drinkable water for use in the camp is supplied by conventional water wells. The total fresh water 

consumption is approximately 60 m3/day.  

18.2 Tailings Disposal Area 
Mineral Reserves for both the Palito and São Chico mines will be processed by the Palito processing 

plant and tailings will be deposited into existing clay lined tailings disposal areas that are located 

adjacent to the processing plant. Figure 18-5 shows tailings disposal areas 14, 15, 16 and 17 (Bacia 

Rej. 14-17). Tailings deposition will alternate between tailings disposal areas 16 and 17 from June 30, 

2017 until the remaining capacity for those areas is exhausted. Thereafter, dry tailings will be removed 

from tailings disposal areas 16 and 17 and will be stacked on top of completed tailings disposal areas 

14 and 15. Tailings disposal areas 16 and 17 will then be re-used for tailings deposition until the 

remaining Mineral Reserves are processed.

18.3 Access Roads and Airstrip 
The Palito Mine is 4.5 km southwest of the village of Jardim do Ouro and approximately 15 km via 

road. Jardim do Ouro lies on the unsealed Transgarimpeira Highway some 30 km west-southwest of 

the town of Moraes de Almeida, which is located on the junction of the Transgarimpeira Highway and 

the BR 163 or Cuiabá – Santarém Federal Highway. Moraes de Almeida is approximately 300 km 

south south-east by road of the municipal capital and similarly named city of Itaituba. 

The São Chico Mine is 30 km southwest of the Palito Mine. It is accessed by road from the Palito Mine 

along the Transgarimpeira Highway. 

An airstrip, suitable for light planes, is currently fully operative and located at Palito Mine Site.

19.1 Contracts and Status 
Serabi has in place arrangements with a number of suppliers and customers to support its production 

operations and the sale of its gold. Of these most may be terminated at relatively short notice, the only 

exception being arrangements for the sale of copper /gold concentrate produced which is currently 

sold under a contract for a two-year period which commenced at the start of January 2018. 

Serabi sells its copper/gold concentrate to a trading group that operates with selected refineries. The 

Company is currently obliged to sell 100% of its production to this trading group for a two year period 

which commenced in January 2018. Shipments are made monthly. Prior to entering into this current 

arrangement Serabi undertook a process of requesting bids and made its selection based on past 

experience and pricing. Terms are in line with market norms. The shipment and logistics for delivery 

of copper/gold concentrate to Serabi customers selected refineries is managed by Axis Shipping who 

manage the inland road, river transport and arrange packing, export documentation and ocean freight.  

Serabi generally sells its gold doré to a Brazilian trading group with no long-term contract or obligation. 

Under the arrangements the gold is sold as an exported product and pricing is negotiated for each 

delivery of bullion based on prevailing spot prices. The trader handles the logistics of collection from 

the mine site, delivery to the refinery and final exportation, but the Company also has arrangements 

in place with Brinks for secure collection from the mine site and delivery to other customers when and 

if required. 

Serabi has sold gold doré to parties outside of Brazil and has a number of other customers keen to 

enter into arrangements to acquire the bullion produced by Serabi. The Company is therefore able to 

negotiate competitive terms with potential purchasers. Currently Serabi has a contract with Umicore, 

in São Paulo, an internationally recognized refinery, to undertake the refining of gold doré prior to 

exportation.  

Serabi currently has no hedging arrangements in place although as an arrangement fee with its lender 

Sprott Resource Lending Partnership ("Sprott"), it agreed in June 2017 to grant to Sprott call options 

over 6,109 oz exercisable at a price of US$1,320/oz up until December 31, 2019. 

Some of the mining operations undertaken by Serabi are specialized, particularly the highly selective 

stope mining activities at the Palito Mine. This is not a mining style that is widely deployed in Brazil 

and as a result there is a limited pool of skilled and experienced personnel in the country able to 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 126 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

undertake this work. The Company has an agreement in place with GAC Mining of Peru to source and 

supply suitably qualified and experienced stope mining personnel on a contract basis, to supplement 

the Brazilian workforce that undertake the same work and who are directly employed by Serabi. Serabi 

may vary with each roster period, the number and exact skills of the people that GAC are required to 

provide for that roster period. 

Serabi sources goods and services from a number of parties but in the region that it operates there 

can be limited suppliers available. Electricity is provided by CELPA a privately-owned company that is 

essentially a monopoly supplier in the region. Contracts terms are in place for the purchase of 

electricity with the last price adjustment agreed in 2015. 

Security services for both the Palito and São Chico sites are provided by Fortesan Vigilancia e 

Seguranca Ltda, a private contractor supplying both static and patrolling security staff.  

While many other supplies such as those for fuel, explosives, chemicals and other key materials may 

be sourced from a single supplier, Serabi has no other material long term contracts and regularly 

reviews its arrangements, product quality and pricing with suppliers.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 
Community Impact  

20.1 Environmental Study Results 
In 2006, an environmental impact assessment (Estudo de Impacto Ambiental or EIA) and its respective 

report of environmental impact (Relatório de Impacto ao Meio Ambiente or RIMA) were completed for 

the Serabi operations. These documents covered the environmental impacts, proposed measures of 

compensation, mitigation and control of the expansion of the Palito Mine production. 

The EIA included the following elements: 

 General project information (project description); 
 Characterization of the enterprise (project technical studies and information); 
 Environmental diagnosis (baseline conditions and characterization); 
 Evaluation of environmental impacts (impact assessment); 
 Environmental control plans (mitigation, monitoring and environmental controls); and 
 Conclusions. 

Environmental studies presented in the EIA included: 

 Biological studies, including fauna (mammalian, ichthyofauna (fish), avifauna (birds), 
herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians), and chelonians) and flora (Dryland Forest and 

Riparian Forest); 

 Abiotic, physical and socioeconomics studies during the periods of construction, operation and 
closure of the project; 

 Management plans for: Water Resources, Recovery of Degraded Areas (PRAD), Promotion 
of Local Development, Solid Waste, Environmental Emergency; and 

 Conceptual Mine Closure Plan. 

The EIA concluded that negative impacts to the environment would occur to various resources during 

construction and operations, but that these impacts could be effectively mitigated through the 

implementation of environmental protection measures and through proper monitoring. 

The Annual Environmental Information Reports (Relatorio de informação Ambiental Anual or RIAA) 

for Palito and São Chico  mines are presented each year to the Secretary of State for Environment 

and Sustainability (Sectretaria de Estado de Meio Ambiente e Sustentabilidade or SEMAS) with 

respect to the socio-environmental actions carried out during the previous year, and cover any specific 

commitments made to the environmental agency by the operator, as well as those agreements and 

obligations between the operator and other stakeholders in the project. Serabi provided SRK the 

RIAAs for years 2014, 2015 and 2016, which included:  

 Monitoring of water resources and air quality; 
 Programs related to the biotic environment; 
 Social and environmental schedule and actions; 
 Environmental performance and objectives to be pursued the following year; and 
 Proof of reporting protocols submitted to the environmental agency throughout the year.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

São Chico Mine operates under a Utilization Guide (Guia de Utilização) authorization. This allows the 

mineral exploration operation with underground experimental mining, with exploitation of up to 50,000 

t/year. For this type of activity, a formal EIA is not required. Nevertheless, Serabi intends to obtain an 

Exploitation Permit for São Chico. As such, in December 2016, Serabi filed a Consultation Letter with 

SEMAS in order to request information and guidance on the required environmental studies necessary 

to obtain this Exploitation Permit for São Chico Mine, which will be authorized through a simplified EIA-

RIMA process. As of the date of this report, SEMAS has not formally responded to this request with 

details on the required activities. 

20.2 Known Environmental Issues 
Documentation provided by Serabi and discussions during the site visit by SRK with site personnel 

indicate that groundwater and surface water quality (i.e., potential contamination by previous 

operators) may be an issue for consideration. Palito Mine site monitoring results include concentrations 

above Brazilian regulatory limits for copper, lead, nickel and manganese in Igarapé Palito creek, which 

is the monitoring point downstream of the mine site. São Chico Mine site surface water monitoring 

indicates similar levels of concentration exceedances in Igarapé São Chico creek for zinc, lead and 

manganese. The exact nature and source of these elevated concentrations is not currently known. 

The Palito Mine utilizes clay-lined tailings impoundments. Monthly groundwater monitoring data from 

the Palito Mine downgradient of the tailings impoundments have shown elevated concentrations of 

metals and the presence of cyanide (CN), potentially above regulatory limits. Current on-site analytical 

methods have difficulty achieving the detection limits needed for assessment against the regulatory 

limit, and Serabi has expressed a lack of confidence in the construction and development of the 

monitoring wells installed by the previous operator. As such, they have implemented a program to 

install new wells and refurbish the old wells, as well as new equipment and methodologies on site to 

more accurately and precisely analyze for cyanide in groundwater around the tailings impoundments. 

While the precise source of the groundwater impacts is not currently known, it could be an indication 

of potential seepage/leakage from the older tailings impoundments. In an effort to reduce CN 

concentrations within the tailings, Serabi has constructed an INCO SO2/Air Process Cyanide 

Destruction Plant which will be commissioned during the first quarter of 2018. This action is expected 

to result in commensurate reductions in CN concentrations in the underlying groundwater. 

Within the project boundary are areas of historical artisanal mining, which were known to employ 

mercury amalgamation as a beneficiation method. To date, no systematic characterization program or 

confirmatory sampling has been conducted in order to assess the potential for residual mercury 

contamination. Many of these former artisanal sites have been inundated by runoff and are currently 

underwater. 

At this time, these known environmental issues are not expected to materially impact Serabi's ability 

to extract the mineral resources or mineral reserves at either Palito or São Chico, though Serabi has 

not yet received the final approval/licensing from the regulatory agency for the current tailings dam 

facilities, although the application documentation has been submitted. 

20.3 Operating and Post-Closure Requirements and Plans 
Palito operates under a Plan of Environmental Control (Plano de Controle Ambiental or PCA) approved 

in 2008 by SEMAS. The PCA formalizes the environmental obligations of the operator that must be 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 129 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

carried out in order to minimize impacts during operations. Environmental control activities include 

described in the Palito PCA include: 

 Residues inventory and correct final disposal according to Residue Management Program; 
 Water resources management program; 
 Surface and ground water quality monitoring program; 
 Air quality monitoring program; 
 Effluents monitoring program; and 
 Climate and hydrological monitoring program. 

As noted above, the results of the prescribed monitoring programs are reported to the government in 

the annual RIAA. The mine appears to be fulfilling these requirements accordingly.  

São Chico operates under a separate PCA, which includes: 

 Reclamation of areas for erosion and sediment loading control; 
 Water resources management program; 
 Surface water quality monitoring program; and 
 Air quality monitoring program. 

According to the conceptual mine closure plan developed in late 2015, the post-closure requirements 

are planned for years 2025-2027, and include: 

 Monitoring of revegetation success;  
 Surface and groundwater quality monitoring; and  
 Slope stability and erosion monitoring.  

Serabi will be required to maintain a minimum staff (including site security personnel) for up to the 

fourth year after closure. 

20.4 Project Permitting Requirements 

The general framework for mine permitting and licensing in Brazil is presented and discussed in 

Section 4.3, and it not reiterated herein.  

The Serabi operations have been authorized under a series of licenses, as presented in Table 20-1. 

For each license, related conditions and/or obligations are also listed, along with the respective status. 

In September 2016, Serabi filed an application with SEMAS for an Operation License for both Dams 

16 and 17. SEMAS subsequently advised Serabi to present separate applications for these facilities. 

For Dam 16 (which was a raise modification to dams 12 and 13), the agency agreed that a modification 

to the existing LO should be sufficient. However, for Dam 17 (which is an entirely new structure), the 

agency requested that Serabi initiate an Installation License (LI) rather than an LO, thus requiring more 

and lengthier review. 

Serabi resubmitted both revised applications in accordance with SEMAS recommendations. According 

to information provided to SRK by Serabi in August 2017, the formal agency review of the revised 

permit applications is still ongoing, even though the capacity of Dam 16 was reached and the facility 

closed at the end of June 2017. Unable to wait for formal authorization on the Dam 17 revised 

application, Serabi proceeded with construction and has initiated disposal of tailings in this

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

impoundment, as the agency completes its review of the application. According to Serabi, SEMAS has 

inspected the operations on several occasions during this period, and is aware of the status of tailings 

disposal. To date, no formal notices of violation or cease and desist orders have been issued by the 

agency for either Dam 16 or Dam 17.

20.5 Post-Performance or Reclamations Bonds 
Brazil currently has legal requirements for closure and reclamation of mining projects, but does not 

have any requirements for the operator to provide a financial surety (e.g., trust fund, bond, letter of 

credit, insurance, etc.) for that reclamation. As opposed to a mine reclamation financial surety and/or 

bond, potentially polluting activities are obligated to register before the National Registry of Pollutant 

Activities, and consequently have to pay an environmental tax (Taxa de Fiscalização do IBAMA), which 

may vary in accordance with the potential of pollution. In the end, the company and it officers can be 

held criminally responsible for failure to adequately reclaim and remediate a mine site. 

As both Palito and São Chico Mine sites closure plans are only at a conceptual level, limited 

information regarding post-closure performance and reclamation activities is available.  

Post-performance for Palito will be based on periodical monitoring reports regarding revegetation and 

erosion control, water quality and slope stability, which shall be presented in a half-yearly basis 

according to the conceptual closure plan.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

According to the conceptual closure plan, areas that require reclamation include: 

 Palito Creek; 
 Senna Target Pits; 
 Waste Rock Piles; 
 Tailings and Water Dams; and 
 Landfill and Landing Strip. 

Post-performance for São Chico  mine site will be based on periodical monitoring reports regarding 

revegetation and erosion control, water quality and slope stability, which shall be presented in a half-

yearly basis according to the conceptual closure plan.  

According to the conceptual closure plan, areas that require reclamation include: 

 Waste Rock Piles; and 
 Areas used in the past for livestock pasture (campos sujos). 

20.6 Social and Community 
Since 2014, Serabi has developed and supported projects aimed at social promotion, economic 

development, citizenship recovery, protection of the environment, and expansion of access to various 

cultural and artistic manifestations, as well as programs for occupational health and safety of workers. 

Social and environmental programs have been developed in coordination with the communities 

deemed to be in the Directly Affected Area (ADA): Jardim do Ouro and São Chico; the Area of Direct 

Influence (AID), including the district of Moraes Almeida; and the Area of Indirect Influence (AII), which 

includes the municipalities of Itaituba, where the company is inserted, and Novo Progresso, from which 

Serabi obtains much of its labor, material supplies, and services. The programs have included: a dental 

clinic, improvements to local schools, provision of electricity and treated water, as well as planning for 

a new health clinic. 

In accordance with requirements established by the Ministry of Labor, Serabi annually updates and 

modifies its health and safety programs with new measures to prevent accidents and injuries, including 

employee awareness programs to promote safer operations. Serabi also has an active stakeholder 

engagement program. The following programs are currently maintained and developed by Serabi: 

 Prioritization in Hiring Labor and Local Suppliers; 
 Health and Safety of Employees; 
 Medical Control and Occupational Health Program – PCMSO; 
 Risk Management Program – PGR; 
 Promotion to Health and Social Welfare; 
 Sociocultural Initiatives; 
 Environmental Education for Communities; and 
 Improvements of Local Infrastructure. 

20.7 Mine Closure 
The most recent mine closure plans for Palito and São Chico were developed at the end of 2016. 

These are conceptual closure plans which assume that all facilities will be closed and all areas 

impacted by the enterprise activities will be reclaimed. The work breakdown for site closure includes

As a condition for the issuance of the LO, SEMAS required the reclamation of the Alvo Senna pit area. 

Serabi had been depositing inert ramp development rock from the Palito Mine in these former open pit 

areas. Figure 20-1 shows the area at Alvo Senna undergoing reclamation (north side). Figure 20-2 

shows the partially reclaimed south end of Alvo Senna.

Reclamation of Alvo Senna using waste rock is a slow process since the bulk of the waste materials 

generated from the underground mine workings are used as underground backfill, so only limited 

quantities can be used for surface backfilling. Based on its granitic composition, the waste rock used 

for surface backfilling is considered to be non-reactive (inert), though no geochemical characterization 

of the waste rock has been completed. Importantly, no evidence of reactivity was observed during 

SRK's site visit. 

20.7.1 Reclamation Measures during Operations and Project Closure 

Because Palito is currently operated as an underground mine, only a small amount of surface 

disturbance exists which requires concurrent reclamation during operations. The former open pit area, 

Alvo Senna, is no longer in operation. Reclamation of those pits is currently being carried out by Serabi, 

and is partially completed. Alvo Senna is being backfilled with inert ramp development rock from the 

underground mining operation; once full, it will be covered with soil and revegetated.  

São Chico is strictly an underground mine, with ore being sent to Palito for processing. No concurrent 

reclamation is planned for this location, with the exception of some early artisanal mining areas within 

the concession. 

20.7.2 Closure Monitoring 

For both Palito and São Chico, the conceptual closure plans do not specifically address monitoring 

during closure activities (which Serabi intends to continue from operations); rather, only post-closure 

monitoring is explicitly discussed. 

20.7.3 Reclamation and Closure Cost Estimate 

Based on the conceptual closure plans from 2016, Serabi estimates the reclamation and closure costs 

for the Palito Mine to be on the order of US$2,271,472 (Table 20-4).

Based on the conceptual closure plan from 2016, Serabi estimates the reclamation and closure costs 

for the São Chico Mine to be on the order of US$570,566 (Table 20-5).

Given the size and extent of the facilities, the known environmental issues surrounding potential 

surface water and groundwater contamination, and the potential need for more robust engineered 

closure covers on the tailings impoundments and waste rock piles, it is SRK's opinion that the 

estimated closure costs are generally appropriate. However, the costs may be higher if there is a need 

for surface and groundwater remediation and compulsory post-closure monitoring ordered by SEMAS.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions  

25.1 Geology and Mineralization 
Gold deposits in the Tapajós Gold Province can be broadly classified into three main types: 

 Mesozonal deposits; 
 Epizonal intrusion centered or intrusion related deposits; and 
 Alluvial, colluvial and supergene enriched saprolitic deposits. 

Tapajós deposits are structurally controlled, but host rock control is vital to understanding the metal 

precipitation process locally. Primary gold deposits occur as the first two categories of deposit types 

and are generally located in fractured and sheared host environments such as: 

 Quartz and quartz sulfide stock work and associated alteration hosted disseminated sulfide; 
 Quartz vein; 
 Quartz sulfide veins +/- selvedge alteration hosted disseminated sulfide; 
 Massive sulfide veins +/- selvedge alteration hosted disseminated sulfide; and 
 Disseminated sulfide within alteration. 

The mineralogy and textures of the deposits at the Palito Mining Complex are consistent with a model 

for an intrusion related mesothermal gold-copper mineralization. This relatively new classification of 

gold deposits is associated with granitic rocks and are best developed above and surrounding small, 

granitic intrusions. Mineralization styles can manifest as stockworks, breccia, skarns and lode style 

veins, and have a clear metal association zonation. 

25.2 Exploration Status  
Serabi has been exploring the Palito Mining Complex since 2003 and have acquired an appreciation 

of the geology, geochemistry and geophysical signatures and controls on the gold mineralization within 

the Palito Mine and throughout the Palito Mining Complex area. 

Serabi have used the following process to facilitate exploration and the discovery of new deposits in 

the project area: 

 Ground selection – northwest-southeast structural corridor, with northeast-southwest breaks; 
 Remote sensing and remote geophysics, VTEM and magnetics; 
 IP and EM ground geophysics, and shallow geochemical sampling and/or drilling using auger 

or RAB; and 

 Diamond drilling based on integrated models and ranking. 

Serabi believe that exploration should focus on structural corridors parallel to, or extensions of the 

Palito trend and specifically where Palito Central Fault analogies exist. Topographic highs on the flanks 

are considered more prospective due to silicification of the country rock, making them more resistant 

to weathering.  

25.3 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Both the Palito and São Chico ores are highly amenable to conventional processing techniques to 

recover the contained metal values, and plant performance on both Palito and São Chico ores has 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 142 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

been similar to results predicted from the metallurgical test programs. During the period 2015 - 2017 

(Q1):  

 Average annual gold recovery from Palito ore has been consistent at about 91%;  
 Average annual gold recovery from São Chico has increased from 87.1% to 95.8%; and 
 Average annual gold recovery from the old flotation tailings has increased from 70.7% to 

84.4%. 

25.4 Mineral Resource Estimate 
 The mineral resource estimates prepared by Serabi for the Palito Mine considers core drilling 

and underground chip sampling by Serabi generated during the period mid-2002 to May 2017. 

 The São Chico Mine mineral resource estimates, prepared by Serabi, considers core drilling 
and underground chip sampling by Serabi and previous operators during the period of 

September 2011 to March 2017. 

 The databases used to estimate mineral resources at Palito and São Chico were audited by 
SRK. 

 SRK believes the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence 
the boundaries for gold mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to 

support mineral resource estimation. 

 Serabi used a traditional polygonal estimation method in 2D sections to evaluate the mineral 
resources of both mines. AutoCAD® software was used to define the 2D longitudinal sections 

and the calculations were performed in Microsoft® Excel. 

 The polygonal quantities and grade estimates were reviewed by SRK to determine the portions 
of the Palito and São Chico mines having "reasonable prospects for eventual economic 

extraction" from an underground mine, based on a CoG of 3.10 g/t gold at the Palito Mine and 

2.85 g/t gold at the São Chico Mine, assuming a gold price of US$1,500/oz, and metallurgical 

gold recovery of 91% and 95% respectively. 

25.5 Mineral Reserve Estimate and Mining Methods 
 The Mineral Reserves have been estimated by Serabi personnel in a manner that is 

reasonable and appropriate for the narrow vein orebodies at the Palito and São Chico mines. 

 The selected mining methods (shrinkage stoping at the Palito Mine and longhole stoping at 
the São Chico Mine) are appropriate. 

 The Mineral Reserves conform to CIM definitions and comply with all disclosure requirements 
for Mineral Reserves set out in NI 43-101. 

 Based on the current Mineral Reserves at the Palito Mine, a total of 541 kt grading 8.63 g/t Au 
will be mined over a mine life of approximately 4.5 years (July 2017 to November 2021). 

 Based on the current Mineral Reserves at the São Chico Mine, a total of 90 kt grading 8.43 
g/t Au will be mined over a mine life of approximately two years (July 2017 to June 2019). 

25.6 Recovery Methods 
Reconciliation of Palito and São Chico ore grades with measured plant feed grades has been poor. 

Since the beginning of 2016 Palito reconciled gold grades have been consistently about 7% to 20% 

lower than the measured plant feed grades. During this same period the São Chico reconciled ore 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – Palito Mining Complex  Page 143 
 
 

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

grades have been about 2% to 18% higher. In SRK's opinion there appears to be a bias in the ore 

feed sampling and/or the allocation of production between Palito and São Chico ores. 

25.7 Project Infrastructure 
The Palito Mining Complex has well-developed site infrastructure that is adequate for the continuation 

of mining and processing operations in accordance with the LoM plan. 

25.8 Environmental Studies and Permitting 
Permitting and Regulation 

São Chico has initiated the process for revalidation of current Operational License, which expired on 

December 22, 2017. Serabi appears to be in possession of, and in compliance with all relevant 

installation and operational licenses and/or permits, though SRK did not conduct a detailed regulatory 

compliance audit as part of this review. The site has also started the process to modify operations from 

a trial mining to a regular mining (exploitation) as part of the revalidation of the existing LO. Those 

issues are minor with a low risk. São Chico is currently operating under Utilization Guidelines (Guia 

de Utilização - GU) which limits its ore exploitation to 50,000 t/year. Serabi shall obtain the mining 

concession for São Chico Mine and go through the regularization process (LP + LI + LO). 

At Palito, Serabi continues to wait for SEMAS to act on the installation and operational licenses/permits 

for Dam 16 and Dam 17. No cease and desist orders or notices of violation have been issued by 

SEMAS for this situation, though Serabi indicates that the agency routinely visits the operation and is 

aware of the conditions and operations at the site. In September 2016, Serabi initiated the licensing 

process to obtain operational licenses for both dams, and presented the required technical 

documentation; however, no response from SEMAS was received. Serabi has sought legal 

advice/assistance with respect to this issue and the lack of action by the regulatory agency. 

Potential Environmental Issues 

 The monitoring program at Palito is modified from time to time. It is SRK's opinion that the 
current plan may not be effectively characterizing the waters through the site-wide water 

balance (mine system).  

 Unfortunately, the site lacks appropriate background monitoring data to determine if some of 
the current surface water and groundwater exceedances are the result of historic artisanal 

mining, prior operators of the site, or the current operations.  

 The detection of cyanide in the downgradient monitoring well may suggest potential leakage 
from the clay-lined tailings impoundments, though Serabi is working toward improved 

groundwater sampling and analyses to increase their confidence in earlier results reported for 

the site. The installation of a cyanide destruction circuit will be complete in the first quarter of 

2018 and is expected to mitigate this issue. 

 The limited surface water monitoring data from São Chico suggests potential impacts to 
Igarapé São Chico Creek, most notably by the elevated concentration of zinc, lead and 

manganese as compared to upgradient samples. 

 Neither Palito or São Chico conducts geochemical characterization on tailings or waste rock 
materials which may be necessary to assess the current contamination issues as well as 

develop effective closure and potential remediation alternatives.

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

Mine Closure 

With respect to the conceptual closure plans, Serabi may want to consider the possibility of more 

robust and expensive engineered cover systems for the tailings (due to possible seepage to underlying 

groundwater) and waste rock piles, or the potential need for groundwater remediation. As such, the 

closure costs may be underestimated.  

25.9 Capital and Operating Costs 
The CoG calculation is based on recent actual operating costs and the calculated CoGs are 

reasonable and appropriate for both the Palito and São Chico mines. The sustaining capital costs as 

used in Serabi's economic analysis for the Mineral Reserves are appropriate for the remaining life of 

each mine.  

25.10 Economic Analysis 
SRK reviewed Serabi's economic analysis and we have verified that the outcome is a positive cash 

flow that supports the statement of Mineral Reserves.

26 Recommendations  

26.1 Recommended Work Programs 

26.1.1 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

SRK recommends that Serabi continue to investigate metallurgical sampling and accounting 

procedures in an effort to improve the variance between measured and reconciled ore grades. 

26.1.2 Mineral Resource Estimate 

SRK is of the opinion that there is an opportunity to further improve the data collection, verification and 

mineral resource estimation methodologies at both the both Palito and São Chico mines. Areas that 

could be reviewed include the following: 

 Upgrade the analytical assays QA/QC protocols 
 Upgrade and maintain documented mine geological procedure guidelines for all mine geology 

tasks, to be consistently implemented 

 Introduce a three dimensional geostatistically-based mineral resource estimation methodology 
to the operations 

 Provide geology and resource estimation modeling training to the resource geology staff at 
both operations. 

 The mine geology staff would benefit from training on relevant aspects of the National 
Instrument 43-101 reporting guidelines 

 Develop an automated grade control modeling system to enable more accurate mine planning 
processes and 

 Implement a practical model to mine to mill reconciliation system. 

There are several highly prospective exploration targets on the Palito property which require further 

drill testing. This could potentially add to the mineral resource inventory. 

26.1.3 Mineral Reserve Estimate and Mining 

 SRK recommends that Serabi investigate acquiring a cavity monitoring survey instrument to 
allow completed longhole stopes at São Chico to be accurately and safely surveyed. Accurate 

cavity surveys will allow Serabi to optimize drilling and blasting practices and will provide for 

a better understanding of overbreak/slough in the longhole stopes. 

26.1.4 Environmental Studies and Permitting 

Based on the assessment carried out on the documentation provided by Serabi and the site visit, SRK 

recommends the following additional work programs: 

 A more detailed surface water chemistry characterization and QA/QC implementation for both 
sites; 

 A more detailed groundwater chemistry characterization and QA/QC implementation for Palito 
site; 

 Characterization of acid-rock drainage (ARD) potential and metal leaching (ML) potential for 
waste rock and tailings materials;

TO/MLM Palito-SaoChico_43-101TR_510900-010_Rev09_MLM.docx January 2018 

 Based on the ARD/ML analyses, conduct an assessment of the potential for the underground 
workings to flood and cause localized groundwater contamination post closure; 

 Identify and sample suitable background study sites for both Palito and São Chico; 
 Prepare a more comprehensive site-wide water balance for the site, coupled with a 

geochemical mass balance exercise to evaluate the need for possible water treatment and 

concentration objectives prior to effluent discharge; and 

 Review and possibly update both Palito and São Chico mines closure plans and related costs 
(considering more robust cover systems and possible post-closure remediation requirements).

28 Glossary 
The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have been classified according to CIM (CIM, 2014). 

Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves 

have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as 

defined below.  

28.1 Mineral Resources 
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on 

the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for 

eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological 

characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 

evidence and knowledge, including sampling. 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 

quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence 

is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An Inferred Mineral 

Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and 

must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred 

Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 

densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the 

application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the 

economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable 

exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity 

between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than 

that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral 

Reserve. 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 

densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 

application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic 

viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 

and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of 

observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to 

either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proven 

Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 

28.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 

Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material 

is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that 

include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, 

extraction could reasonably be justified.

The reference point at which Mineral Reserves are defined, usually the point where the ore is delivered 

to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations where the reference point 

is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader 

is fully informed as to what is being reported. The public disclosure of a Mineral Reserve must be 

demonstrated by a Pre-Feasibility Study or Feasibility Study. 

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 

circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a 

Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve. 

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A 

Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors. 

28.3 Definition of Terms 
The following general mining terms may be used in this report.

Capital Expenditure All other expenditures not classified as operating costs. 
Composite Combining more than one sample result to give an average result over a larger 

distance.  
Concentrate A metal-rich product resulting from a mineral enrichment process such as gravity 

concentration or flotation, in which most of the desired mineral has been 
separated from the waste material in the ore.  

Crushing Initial process of reducing ore particle size to render it more amenable for further 
processing.  

CoG (CoG) The grade of mineralized rock, which determines as to whether or not it is 
economic to recover its gold content by further concentration.

Gangue Non-valuable components of the ore.  
Grade The measure of concentration of gold within mineralized rock.  
Hangingwall The overlying side of an orebody or slope.  
Haulage A horizontal underground excavation which is used to transport mined ore.  
Hydrocyclone A process whereby material is graded according to size by exploiting centrifugal 

forces of particulate materials.  
Igneous Primary crystalline rock formed by the solidification of magma.  
Kriging An interpolation method of assigning values from samples to blocks that 

minimizes the estimation error.  
Level Horizontal tunnel the primary purpose is the transportation of personnel and 

materials.  
Lithological Geological description pertaining to different rock types.  
LoM Plans Life-of-Mine plans.  
LRP Long Range Plan.  
Material Properties Mine properties.  
Milling A general term used to describe the process in which the ore is crushed and

equipment, supplies, ore and waste.  
Sill A thin, tabular, horizontal to sub-horizontal body of igneous rock formed by the 

injection of magma into planar zones of weakness.  
Smelting A high temperature pyrometallurgical operation conducted in a furnace, in which 

the valuable metal is collected to a molten matte or doré phase and separated 
from the gangue components that accumulate in a less dense molten slag phase.  

Stope Underground void created by mining.  
Stratigraphy The study of stratified rocks in terms of time and space.
