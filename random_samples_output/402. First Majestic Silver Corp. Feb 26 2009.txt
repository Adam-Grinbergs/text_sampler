3.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

First Majestic Silver Corp. (FMS) retained Pincock, Allen and Holt (PAH), a division of Australia-based 
Runge, Inc. to prepare a Technical Report for the silver/lead/zinc deposit of La Encantada Silver Mine 
located in the Municipality of Ocampo, Coahuila State, and México.  This report is an update of Technical 
Report Amended of March 19, 2008, which was prepared by PAH and published in SEDAR in March 28, 
2008.  This report is presented to document material change in La Encantada Silver Mine due to an 
increment of reserves (+183 percent) and resources (measured and indicated -17 percent and inferred 
+51 percent).  This report meets the requirements and is compliant with NI 43-101 and conforms to 
Form 43-101F1 for technical reports.  

La Encantada Silver Mine is owned and operated by Minera La Encantada, S.A. de C.V., wholly-owned 
Mexican subsidiary of FMS.  La Encantada Silver Mine consists of an industrial complex that includes 
underground silver/lead/zinc mining, a flotation ore processing plant, water wells and pipeline, airport, 
housing, camp facilities and a new cyanidation plant under construction to process silver tailings.  The La 
Encantada mine was operated by Peñoles for a period of about 25 years, until June 2002.  Desmín leased 
the property from Peñoles and operated the mine and processing plant from July 1, 2004 until November 
1, 2006 when Desmín was acquired by FMS.  During January to September, 2008 FMS has mined out 
178,480 tonnes at an average grade of 297 g/tonne Ag and 2.29 percent Pb. 

FMS owns mining rights that cover 2,237 hectares (5,227 acres) within 18 titled concessions and 3 
approved claim applications, in addition to 2 other applications under review by the Mines Department.  
Minera La Encantada has acquired, from the Ejido Tenochtitlán, Municipality of Ocampo, under 
expropriation regulations, surface land ownership of 1,343 hectares (3,319 acres) where mine, plant, 
housing, camp and associated facilities are installed.  It also owns the surface rights, installations and 
water rights for two water wells at El Granizo, which supply La Encantada water needs. 

Estimated proven and probable reserves and measured and indicated resources for La Encantada, as of 
September 30, 2008, are presented in Table 3-1.  These include proven and probable reserves of 5.2 
million tonnes at 208 g/tonne (6.7 oz) Ag, and 2.42 percent (53 lb/tonne) Pb, for a total contained silver 
equivalent, inclusive of Pb credit, of 35.5 million ounces.  These reserves include 4 million tonnes of 
tailings at an average grade of 168 g/tonne silver, estimated at a Cut-off Grade of 111 g/tonne silver. 

La Encantada reserves have been estimated at a Cutoff Grade of 250 g/tonne Ag only and 228 g/tonne 
Ag equivalent net of Pb credit.  The La Encantada proven and probable reserves in hard rock include 1.2 
million tones at an average grade of 343 g/tonne silver and 2.39 percent lead.  

During the period of January through September, 2008 FMS mined 178,480 tonnes of ore, which included 
70,000 tonnes from reserves, in addition of other minerals extracted from different areas of the mine for 
a total of 108,480 tonnes.  To September 30, 2008, the La Encantada exploration programs and 
underground development increased reserves by approximately 183 percent over the 2007 estimates.

These were estimated from the following areas:  Breccia Milagros, Azul y Oro, Breccia Keylor, Cuerpo 660 
E, Cola de Gallo, Bonanza, La Piedra, Breccia San Javier, Dique San Francisco, San Francisco, Jorobada, 
Rebaje 141, Rebaje and Ojuela Ampliación zones in addition to the Tailings Dam No. 1.  Most of these 
deposit areas remain opened for exploration and development; for instance, Breccia Milagros appears to 
represent a significant deposit, the full extent of which is still unknown to FMS. 

Measured and indicated resources to September 30, 2008 at La Encantada amount to 5.4 million tonnes 
at 176 g/tonne (5.7 oz) Ag and 1.40 percent (31 lb/tonne) Pb, for a total contained silver equivalent, 
inclusive of Pb credit, of about 33.1 million ounces.  These resources include 1.6 million tonnes of tailings 
at an average grade of 76 g/tonne (2.4 oz/tonne).  Preliminary testwork appears to indicate amenability 
and probable economic recovery of silver values from the tailings by cyanide leaching processing. 
Additional bulk testing is recommended to validate and confirm the resource.  These resources represent 
a decrease of about 17 percent over the resources estimated for 2007 in silver equivalent ounces to 33.1 
million, due to upgrade of tailings dam No. 2 to probable reserves. 

Additional inferred resources have been estimated by FMS at La Encantada.  The inferred resources 
require additional grade and tonnage information before they may be upgraded to indicated or measured 
resources.  They represent geologic potential to be further investigated.  La Encantada has estimated 
inferred resources that amount to about 2.6 million tonnes at an average grade of 220 g/tonne (7.0 
oz/tonne) Ag and 1.0 percent (22 lb/tonne) Pb, for a total estimated content of silver equivalent, inclusive 
of Pb credit, of about 20.0 million ounces.  This estimate represents an increment of 51 percent over the 
reported resources for 2007.  

During the La Encantada 2008 exploration drilling program a new mineralized zone was discovered at the 
1790 mine level.  This zone has been denominated the Buenos Aires zone and delineated with 15 drill 
holes resulting in about 536,000 tonnes of Indicated Resources at an average grade of 395 g/tonne Ag 
(7.2 million ounces of silver equivalent) and 560,000 tonnes of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 
339 g/tonne Ag (6.5 million ounces of silver equivalent).  Silver equivalent includes Pb credits.   

Processing flotation plant facilities have an installed capacity of 800 tonnes per day.  It includes all 
supporting facilities, including laboratory, maintenance, etc.  The metallurgical current plant average 
operating rate is about 800 tonnes per day.  About three quarters of the ore comes from the mine and 
the other quarter from upgraded waste dump rock that has been screened to reject the coarser lower-
grade fraction. 

FMS is presently building, on a site about 1-1/2 kilometers from the existing flotation plant, a cyandiation 
plant with a capacity of 3,500 tonnes per day.  The plant will process the ore and waste dump rock that 
is currently processed through the flotation plant in conjunction with reclaimed tailings.  The plant is 
scheduled to commence operation in April 2009.  PAH considers the FMS production and cost projections 
for this operation optimistic, but these parameters will only be clearly established when it has been in 
operation for six month or more.   



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 3.4 
90533  February 26, 2009 

The surface rights to La Encantada Silver Mine are mostly owned by Minera La Encantada (a wholly 
owned subsidiary of FMS).  According to La Encantada, there is a good working relationship with people 
of the Ejido Tenochtitlán from which the surface rights were purchased by La Encantada, and with the 
town of Múzquiz, since many of the inhabitants are employed in the exploration or mining operations.  No 
labor or access problems have been reported by La Encantada within the area. 

La Encantada was declared in suspension of activities by Peñoles in 2003.  In April 24, 2007 La 
Encantada presented a notification of reactivation of operations at the mine to the National Water 
Commission (C.N.A.), to SEMARNAT, to Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social, and to PROFEPA.  In 
accordance with legal opinion of October 31, 2008 by Mr. Carlos Galván Pastoriza, La Encantada mining 
operations are currently and have always been conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and 
regulations." 

PAH is not aware of any environmental liabilities in La Encantada mining district; most of the area 
covered by La Encantada concessions is mining and prospective land for mineral exploration and mine 
development.  Mr. José Luis Hernández Santibañez, Corporate Manager of Environmental and Permitting 
for FMS provided PAH with a document dated October 31, 2008 showing the list of Environmental and 
Operating Permits for La Encantada in current good standing. 

PAH believes that La Encantada reserve and resource estimates have been reasonably prepared and 
conform to acceptable engineering standards for reporting of reserves and resources.  PAH believes that 
the classification of the reserves and resources meets the standards of Canadian National Instrument NI 
43-101 and the definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM). 

The reserves and resources herein reported by La Encantada were reviewed by PAH and constitute part 
of an operation by Minera La Encantada, a Mexican subsidiary of FMS.  There is no significant technical, 
legal, environmental, political or other kind of restrictions; therefore, in PAH's opinion, these reserves and 
resources are exclusive of each category and may not be materially affected by issues that could prevent 
their extraction and processing. 

An economic analysis of La Encantada operation shows positive economics as measured by a cash flow 
model, and thus the postulated reserve position is accepted.  La Encantada Silver Mine shows a net 
present value of $67 million at a 10 percent discounted rate of return.  Table 3-2 presents a summary of

4.0 INTRODUCTION 

First Majestic Silver Corp. (FMS) retained Pincock, Allen and Holt (PAH) to prepare a Technical Report of 
exploration activities and results obtained to this date, which represent a material change in the 
resources and reserves for the silver/lead/zinc deposit of La Encantada Silver Mine located in the 
Municipality of Ocampo, Coahuila State, México.  This report is an update of Technical Report for the La 
Encantada Silver Mine, Coahuila State, México, prepared for First Majestic Silver Corp. dated March 19, 
2008, Amended by Pincock, Allen & Holt, Inc., and was published in SEDAR on March 28, 2008, and it is 
referred to as Technical Report Amended herein. 

The objective of this Technical Report is to provide FMS with a report that will follow existing regulations 
in Canada.  This report presents a material change of the property due a significant increment of reserves 
including some tailings (+183 percent) and resources (M+I=-17 percent and Inferred=+51 percent) over 
the estimates reported for 2007.  This report meets the requirements and is compliant with NI 43-101 
and conforms to Form 43-101F1 for technical reports.

8.0 HISTORY 

In 2003 Peñoles reported proven and probable reserves at the closing of La Encantada mine including 
485,000 tonnes at an average grade of 570 g/t Ag and 3.98 percent Pb.  FMS's exploration efforts are 
directed to explore other areas of interest within the extensive underground workings, validate these 
historical figures and advance development of additional exploration targets.  By June 2007, FMS 
reported NI 43-101 proven and probable reserves of 633,000 tonnes at an average grade of 315 g/tonne 
Ag, in addition to measured and indicated resources of 1.4 million tonnes at an average grade of 276 
g/tonne Ag, and about 1.5 Million tonnes of inferred resources at an average grade of 200 g/tonne Ag, in 
Technical Report Amended of July 24, 2007 published in SEDAR. 

The La Encantada aggressive exploration and development investments during 2007 resulted in 
additional proven and probable reserves estimated at 1.2 million tonnes for 2008 at an average grade of 
343 g/tonne (11.03 oz/t) and measured and indicated resources estimated at 9.4 million tonnes at an 
average grade of 173 g/tonne (5.6 oz/t), in addition to inferred resources estimated at 2.6 million tonnes 
at a grade of about 220 g/tonne (7.0 oz/t).  The 2008 reserves and resources represent a significant 
increment over the 2007 reported reserves (+183 percent) and resources of (M+I -17 and inferred +51 
percent).  Proven and probable reserves plus measured and indicated resources contain approximately 
68.7 million ounces of silver equivalent, while inferred resources may contain about 20.0 million ounces 
of silver equivalent. 

From the period of October, 2007 to September, 2008, FMS has mined and processed 178,480 tonnes of 
ore from La Encantada Silver mine at an average recovered grade of 297 g/tonne (9.5 oz/tonne) Ag, for 
a total of 1,704,300 contained ounces.  FMS's 2008 production consisted of about 70,000 tonnes of ore 
from the proven and probable reserves, in addition to ore extracted from different newly discovered 
areas during mine preparation and development activities, for a total of 108,480 tonnes.  Currently the 
plant is operating at an average rate of about 800 tonnes per day, while the mine continues to access, 
prepare new working phases and develop additional reserves and resources.

For details on mineralization at La Encantada Silver Mine please refer to Technical Report Amended of 
July 24 and published in SEDAR on July 25, 2007.  

No changes regarding mineralization characteristics of the La Encantada Silver Mine have occurred since 
last publication in Technical Report Amended.  However, the mineralized zones of the La Encantada mine 
have been further increased by discovery of a new mineralized zone denominated Buenos Aires. 

FMS exploration drilling program to investigate the Azul y Oro deposit resulted in interception of an 
unknown mineralized zone which comprises a series of NW-SE oriented veins and mineralized breccia 
zones containing high grade silver mineralization with lead and zinc.  These structures show variable 
widths of up to eight meters.  The Buenos Aires zone is located between the Azul y Oro and La Escalera 
breccia zones within the northeastern portion of the mine. 

Currently known projections of the Buenos Aires zone have been drilled from the mine levels 1870, 1790 
and 1635.  Preliminary drilling has determined some blocks of indicated and inferred resources which 
enclose approximately 850,000 tonnes containing some estimated 13 million ounces of silver equivalent 
in oxides. 

FMS is preparing underground access to the zone and additional drilling to upgrade the Buenos Aires 
resource base.

12.0 EXPLORATION 

12.1 Introduction 

La Encantada Silver Mine has been subjected to exploration programs from its discovery in the 1950s, by 
prospectors in the early stages and by Peñoles since the late 1960s to 2003.  FMS has developed an 
aggressive program of explorations including mine development and preparations for drilling from 
underground sites.  Additional diamond drilling is planned from surface locations, as well as geophysical 
surveying to investigate areas of interest and confirm other previously identified exploration areas.  

Exploration efforts carried out during the second half of 2007 through 2008 were primarily focused in 
proving and developing additional reserves and resources for La Encantada mine.  These resulted in a 
significant increment of both resources and reserves.  Major efforts were developed in the areas of 
Breccia Milagros, Bonanza, San Francisco, Intrusivo Milagros, Azul y Oro, and Cuerpo de Zinc at mine 
level N-1535 and in the sampling of the old dumps.  A long term exploration program was initiated to 
investigate the promising target at the La Escalera breccia zone.  A new exploration target was identified 
during the course of explorations to define the Azul y Oro mineralized zone.  The newly discovered zone, 
denominated Buenos Aires, is located between the Azul y Oro and the La Escalera breccia zones.  FMS 
exploration efforts have resulted in a material change of the La Encantada reserve/resource base.  These 
results, in addition to some tailings, show an increment of about 183 percent in proven and probable 
Reserves and a decrement of about 17 percent in measured and indicated resources over previously 
reported reserves and resources of October 31, 2007.  Additional inferred resources have resulted in an 
increment of about 51 percent.  These results have increased the ounces of silver equivalent contained 
for the La Encantada mine to about 69 million in proven and probable reserves plus measured and 
indicated resources.  Additional exploration may upgrade the inferred resources, currently estimated at 
about 20 million ounces of silver equivalent. 

Sampling of old dumps was also advanced and about 150,000 tonnes of screened material was 
measured, sampled and indicated during the period, in addition to screening and processing about 
42,000 tonnes.  Screening recovery of the dumps is about 40 percent in tonnage and grade enrichment 
from about 120 g/tonne Ag to about 160 g/tonne Ag.  Figure 12-1 shows the La Encantada Exploration 
Program.  

12.2 Exploration Programs 

FMS's program of underground exploration was designed to investigate the Milagros and San Javier 
breccia zones, as well as the San Francisco bedded deposits and the Bonanza area where numerous veins 
occur associated with the Bonanza dike.  The La Escalera breccia zone appears to be a significant target 
for exploration. 





   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 12.3 
90533  February 26, 2009 

During the period of September 2007, to September 30, 2008, a total of about 6,660 meters of core 
drilling was completed.  During the period of January to June, 2008 underground workings for exploration 
purposes were developed at the La Encantada mine, including about 1,490 meters of access ramps, 
drifts, and crosscuts, and about 850 meters of exploration tunneling for drill sites access.  This 
development resulted in a significant increment of resources and reserves at the various mine levels of 
the La Encantada Silver Mine, within the Stope 141, Stope 325, Breccia Milagros, Bonanza, Dique San 
Francisco, San Francisco, Jorobada, San Javier Extensión and Alto del Dique La Escondida areas.  

12.2.1 Geophysical Exploration 

FMS has designed an extensive 2008 program of exploration based on geophysical surveying to 
investigate the various identified anomaly areas, and to confirm other indicated potential zones.  This 
program was completed during the period of January to October, 2008, and includes about 50 km of lines 
to be measured by Natural Source Audio-frequency Magnetotelluric methods (NSAMT).  Readings were 
carried out along lines at 100m and 50m spacing according to geologic conditions, at 25m and 50m 
stations along the lines.  This geophysical method takes reading of resistivity and conductivity 
parameters.  The survey was conducted by Zonge Engineering and Research Organization from Tucson, 
Arizona.  The Report is in progress.  Some exploration targets have been identified and confirmed from 
previous research, including the most outstanding targets for investigation, such as the El Plomo, La 
Escalera Breccia zone and the Anomalous areas "A", "B", "C" and "D".  Figure 12-2 shows Geophysical 
Anomaly A – Line 3.  Figure 12-3 shows Geophysical Anomaly El Plomo – Line 4. 

12.2.2 Geochemical Exploration 

No geochemical sampling has taken place at La Encantada during 2008; however, FMS has designed a 
2009 exploration program that includes sampling for geochemical investigations in the areas of the 
geophysical anomalies.  This program is estimated to include about 500 samples.   

12.3 Drilling 

Drilling programs at La Encantada have been limited since the best exploration results may have been 
obtained through underground development.  Additionally, topographic conditions at the mine and 
irregular morphology of mineral concentrations make it difficult to plan for drilling.  Therefore, drilling 
from underground sites and mine workings has proven to be the most effective combination for 
exploration at La Encantada. 

During the period from September, 2007 to September 30, 2008, the La Encantada exploration team 
completed drilling from underground sites totaling 6,660 meters to investigate continuity and depth of 
the Azul y Oro, Breccia San Javier, and La Escalera mineralized structures.  These drill holes resulted in 
discovery of the Buenos Aires mineralized zone, extension and confirmation of some of San Francisco and 
Azul y Oro  mineralized zones.

Additional drilling was developed at the old Peñoles tailings dams to determine volume and grade of the 
two tailings dams.  Metallurgical testwork was carried out in some of the drilled tailings.  Grade, tonnage 
and metallurgical recovery estimates have resulted in additional resources for the La Encantada Silver 
Mine, since some of the silver contained by the tailings appears to be amenable for economic recovery by 
Cyanide Leaching processing methods.  The tailings drilling program included 15 drill holes totaling 168 
meters at the Tailings Dam No. 1, and 34 drill holes for a total drilled depth of 576 meters in Tailings 
Dam No. 2.  Trenches and surveying delimited additional tailings volume at the Presa No. 3.  Figure 12-4 
shows tailing samples. 

12.3.1 Exploration Drilling 

FMS exploration activities for La Encantada mine include three drill rigs for drilling from underground 
sites.  The program completed during 2008, consisted of a total underground development of 2,340m 
including drifts, crosscuts, raises, ramps and stopes development in addition to 5,000m of development 
carried out during the second semester of 2007.  Numerous drill sites have been prepared during 2008. 

Details of the exploration program developed and completed during 2008 are included in Table 12-1.  
This program resulted in a material change with significant additional Resources for the La Encantada 
mine.  Table 12-1 shows the exploration program completed during 2008.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The FMS exploration program for La Encantada includes an aggressive underground and drilling plan that 
has a high probability of success given the geological conditions of the mineralization at the mine.  In 
PAH's opinion the combination of direct exploration methods, drilling and underground development 
represents a good balance for exploration at La Encantada.  The program is directed to access projected 
known areas of mineralization as well as to investigate other adjacent and new promising areas that may 
result in an increment of the resource base and a higher level of reserves for the mine.  This has been

proven positive during the period of 2008 since the new Buenos Aires zone was discovered and resulted 
in additional resources containing approximately 13 million ounces of silver equivalent. 

The exploration program suggested by FMS for the La Encantada Silver Mine for implementation during 
the period of calendar year 2009 is presented in Table 22-1 including estimated costs.  This program 
consists of 7,195 meters of drilling, including 23 drill holes from underground sites, and 10,807 meters of 
underground drifting.  Table 12-2 shows the La Encantada exploration program for 2009. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In PAH's opinion, FMS's exploration program at La Encantada represents an aggressive exploration 
program with a high probability of success to upgrade the mine's reserve and resource base, and with 
high probability for discovery of additional mineralized zones, which would lengthen the mine's life.  PAH 
recommends implementation of the suggested program at an estimated cost of about $2.5 million.

13.0 DRILLING 

FMS continued with an aggressive drilling program at La Encantada during the period from September, 
2007 to September, 2008.  FMS has three drilling rigs to carry out the exploration drilling from 
underground sites.  FMS's program for 2009 includes 7,195 meters of core drilling from underground sites 
to investigate the La Escalera breccia, Buenos Aires and Azul y Oro targets from the 1870, 1970 and 1535 
mine levels.  Exploration drilling requires access and drill site preparation, which for the underground 
exploration is estimated to be approximately 10,800 meters of ramps, drifts, crosscuts and drill site 
construction.   

During the period of January through September 2008, drilling at La Encantada completed 29 drill holes 
for a total depth of 6,660 meters from underground locations.  This program resulted in additional total 
estimated tonnage of 850,000 tonnes of indicated and inferred resources at an average grade of about 
340 g/tonne (about 11 oz/tonne) Ag in oxides mineralization with lead and zinc.  

Fifteen drill holes were completed from underground access to investigate the Azul y Oro mineralized 
structure.  These drill holes also intercepted a new mineralized zone denominated Buenos Aires.  Some of 
these drill holes intersected some of the mineralized structures of the Azul y Oro zone confirming geologic 
continuity of the mineralization.  Additional resource and some reserve blocks were confirmed by the 
program.  Figure 13-1 shows the Buenos Aires Drilling and Figure 13-2 shows Underground Drilling for 
Azul y Oro and Buenos Aires zones. 

Details of FMS's 2008 and 2009 drilling program are presented in Tables 12-1 and Table 12-2.  Estimated 
costs for the 2009 program are presented in Table 22-1. 

FMS has defined future targets of exploration for drilling from surface.  These include confirmation of 
geophysical and structural anomalies, such as: 

 Breccia La Escalera 
 Anomaly A 
 Anomaly B 
 El Camello, etc. 

 
Exploration drilling from underground drill sites includes: 
 

 Buenos Aires 
 Azul y Oro 
 Bonanza Dike 
 San Javier 
 Breccia Milagros 
 La Escalera, etc.

PAH believes that this drilling program from surface and underground workings, in combination with 
underground development, is appropriate and well designed to explore promising targets.  Geologic 
potential exists to discover additional mineralized zones along the development workings.  Estimated 
budget for this program is included in Section 22 of this Report - Recommendations.  PAH recommends 
implementation of this program.  Figure 13-3 shows Buenos Aires Drill Core Intercept.  Figure 13-4 shows 
Buenos Aires High Grade Core.

14.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

PAH reviewed La Encantada's sampling program for the preparation of the Technical Report Amended 
dated July 24, 2007.  Full description of sampling method and approach by La Encantada's geologic crews 
is presented in the Technical Report Amended July 24, 2007.  Additionally, PAH also reviewed the La 
Encantada sampling procedures for this Technical Report and did not notice changes in protocols that 
may affect the results, other than improving in some areas, such as QA/QC with increasing number of 
filed duplicates for drilling and reserve blocks samples. 

The samples are brought into the La Encantada laboratory for preparation and assaying.  Duplicate 
samples are sent to Inspectorate Lab for assay checks.  Additional representative samples are sent to the 
La Encantada laboratory for density determinations.  For the period of 2008 FMS has assayed 38 
duplicate samples and 26 pulp samples at Inspectorate Lab in Reno, Nevada for comparison with assay 
results from the La Encantada lab.  A total of 28 representative samples for density were sent to the La 
Encantada Lab from the El Plomo, Bonanza, Breccia Milagros, San Javier and San Francisco zones.  

In PAH's opinion, the channel and core sampling and methods applied by La Encantada exploration and 
mining crews is done carefully and responsibility by well trained samplers.  The sampling appears to 
reconcile with silver/lead head assays for the processing plant, as well as with production and sales by 
Minera La Encantada.  The channel and core samples appear to properly represent the mineralization of 
La Encantada various deposits; therefore, they are acceptable for resource and reserve estimates.  Figure 
14-1 shows channel sampling.  Figure 14-2 shows a channel sample of Azul y Oro Veinlet.  Figure 14-3 
shows a channel Sample of Azul y Oro at Level 1790.

15.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

15.1 Sample Preparation 

PAH reviewed the La Encantada sample preparation for the Technical Report Amended dated March 18, 
2008.  FMS has not modified the sample preparation methods and procedures.  Details are presented in 
the Technical Report Amended. 

15.2 Laboratory Facilities 

PAH notes that the La Encantada laboratories generally appear to be adequate, with reasonable cleaning 
and organization.  The laboratory currently conducts about 800 samples by fire assay and AA per month, 
including exploration samples, development samples, and mill samples. 

More details on laboratory facilities are presented in Technical Report Amended of July 24, 2007. 

FMS's procedure for quality controls is by sending drill core, mine samples and/or pulps to an outside 
laboratory, usually Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada.  Samples of concentrates are regularly sent to 
Peñoles for check assays.  The laboratory duplicates pulp assays at about 1 sample for every 20 and it 
includes field duplicates, standard samples and introduction of blank samples.  

15.3 Check Assaying 

To evaluate sample quality control, the La Encantada personnel perform periodic check analyses on 
samples.  For the period from November, 2007 to September, 2008, La Encantada has sent 64 samples 
to Inspectorate Laboratories, an independent commercial laboratory in Reno, Nevada for duplicate 
analysis.  These include 38 channel samples from reserve blocks in addition to 26 core duplicates of pulps 
from the reserve blocks.  Results of the assays and graphs are presented in the following tables and 
graphs.  La Encantada Silver Mine is mining and processing mineralization contained in oxides, which 
presents highly variable metal concentrations due to its inherent genetic characteristics.  In this type of 
mineral occurrence, the comparison of assays may present high variations, depending on the mineral 
content of each sample.  High grade silver assays may present differences of up to 80 percent due 
probably to some nugget effect, while the middle range grade samples usually result in close assays.  In 
overall comparison, however, within a range of assays that represent very low to very high grades, the 
correlation is acceptable at an average of 74 percent for silver, and 100 percent for lead.  While the 
duplicates of pulp samples show a better correlation of 99 percent for silver and 98 percent for lead.   

Tables 15-1, 15-2 and Figures 15-1 and 15-2 show the assay results and graphs for samples of the La 
Encantada reserve blocks as duplicate samples and as duplicate pulp samples.  The comparison is 
between assays by the La Encantada mine's lab and Inspectorate Laboratories.  Figure 15-3 shows the 
Buenos Aires drill core.

percent respectively for lead and zinc.  Therefore, pulp duplicate samples assays show good sample 
preparation procedures at La Encantada.  PAH believes that the reproducibility of silver grades is 
acceptable, and it represents acceptable procedures and practices in the sampling preparation processes.  

La Encantada Silver Mine has implemented a strict program of Quality Control by introduction of blank 
and standard samples, as well as the insertion of field duplicate samples and pulp duplicates to keep a 
close control of the assay results.  PAH recommends continuing with current sample preparation and 
shipping processes, which show acceptable differences in assay checks. 

15.4 Conclusion 

Overall, PAH found that the results from the check assaying are excellent and acceptable for pulp 
duplicates, the mineralization in oxides may cause larger differences in assays due to its nature.  It is 
PAH's opinion that the sample methods and analyses are representative of the deposits at La Encantada 
mine, and that most of La Encantada's data was generated by procedures that were carried out according 
to accepted industry standards using accepted practices. 

PAH finds that the exploration, sampling, and laboratory analysis for La Encantada operation is being 
conducted by FMS in a reasonable manner consistent with standard industry practices.  In PAH's opinion 
the sampling results appear to be reasonably representative of the deposits mineralization and believes 
that they may be used with acceptable confidence in the estimation of the mineable reserves.

16.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

PAH has not taken independent samples from the surface or underground exposures of the mineral 
concentrations at La Encantada mine, as other Qualified Persons have previously sampled the 
mineralization as discussed in this report, and the production records are the most reliable data of 
mineralization contained in the ore deposits under development at the mine.  Peñoles developed and 
operated La Encantada mine for over 25 years producing over 80 million ounces of silver.  Peñoles is one 
of the leading Mexican mining companies and the world's largest silver producer.  

FMS has established in a short operating period a systematic procedure to verify data and quality control 
which is proving effective and accurate.  Assay data and information generated by the operation is 
transmitted manually; however, the entire paper trail is accessible and available for inspection. 

FMS initiated effective control of La Encantada operations since November 2006 when it took control of 
the mining operation.  La Encantada has established an active program of assay checks for samples and 
pulps of exploration, production and concentrates at the mine's lab in comparison to assays performed by 
Inspectorate Laboratories of Durango city and Reno, Nevada, and concentrate sampling and assaying 
program by a sales representative in the city of Torreón, Coahuila to check the assays reported by the 
MET-MEX Peñoles smelter. 

Table 16-1 presents a summary of concentrate assays for July, 2008 of shipments to MET-MEX Peñoles.  
This summary presents a comparison of assays by La Encantada lab and MetMex Peñoles.

The coefficient of correlation is excellent for all determinations, including weight (99 percent), silver (100 
percent) and lead (95 percent).  

Figure 16-1 shows correlation between silver assays of both laboratories.  

PAH believes that an adequate amount of checking has been conducted and that the results are 
representative of the mineralization and concentrates produced at La Encantada and shipped to the 
smelter. 

PAH's conclusion is that the results from check assaying are reasonable, including appropriate preparation 
procedures that the sampling results appear to be reasonably representative of the deposit mineralization 
and concentrates, and should be usable with acceptable confidence in the estimation of the mineable 
reserves.

17.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

No adjacent properties exist within the surrounding area of La Encantada.  The El Plomo mine was 
operated as an independent mine for a period of time during the early stages of La Encantada 
development; however, in 1983 it was purchased by Minera La Encantada and it has been part of La 
Encantada mine since then.  Underground developments of La Encantada and El Plomo were connected 
and established as one underground system.  No other mine exists nearby the La Encantada area. 

La Encantada mine is located at about 100km from the cities of Ocampo and Muzquiz, in Coahuila, 
México.   

La Encantada mine housing facilities include 180 single family houses, events center, hotel and three 
restaurants, elementary school facilities, secondary school by teleconferences, sport facilities for soccer, 
squash and bowling, apart from the administration offices and warehouses, etc.  Refurbishing of required 
facilities is in progress. 

FMS has consolidated ownership of the La Encantada mine area by acquiring all mining claims and 
additional concessions around the property.  Surface rights have also been acquired by La Encantada 
from the local "Ejido" (land community) under expropriation proceedings in accordance with the Mining 
Laws. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 18.1

18.0 METALLURGICAL TESTING AND MINERAL PROCESSING 

The ore processed at La Encantada is a complex mixture of oxide and sulfide minerals and is 
consequently difficult to process efficiently.  The principal economic minerals are as follows: 

 Argentite (Ag2S) 
 Acanthite (Ag2S) 
 Cerussite (PbCO3) 

 
The gangue is principally limestone and hematite with minor amounts of quartz, manganese, and zinc. 

The ore is relatively soft and friable making for easy crushing and grinding.  The ore processing method 
consists of crushing and grinding followed by two sequential flotation steps, the first consists of sulfide 
mineral flotation and the second is oxide mineral flotation.  The reason for floating the ore in two stages 
is because the reagents used for oxide flotation are detrimental to sulfide flotation.  Recoveries are poor, 
a reflection of the difficult mineralogy of the rock. 

A cyanide leach plant is currently under construction at La Encantada and plans are to place it in 
operation in April 2009.  The plant will process ore from the mine and waste dumps and from the three 
existing tailings containments: No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3.   

Metallurgical testwork has been conducted on cyanide leaching of old tailings and of flotation 
concentrate.  Results of the testwork are presented in Table 18-1 and 18-2, respectively. 

Table 18-1 shows that cyanide leaching achieves relatively good recovery, averaging 59 percent, from the 
lower-grade, lower-tonnage No. 1 Tailings, and relatively poor recovery, averaging 40 percent, from the 
higher-grade, higher-tonnage No. 2 Tailings.  Recovery from the composite sample, a mixture of fresh 
ore and Tailings No. 1 and No. 2, was good at 67 percent, though the sample is not particularly 
representative of what will be fed to the plant.   

Table 18-2 shows that cyanide leaching of one sample of flotation concentrate gave very good recovery, 
at 98 percent.  When the cyanide leach plant becomes operational, one option for the future plans is to 
eliminate flotation and instead, cyanide leach the ore and waste dump rock in the new plant following 
crushing and grinding in the existing mill.  Direct cyanide leaching the ore and waste dump rock is 
projected to be 78 percent in the FMS Cash Flow Model, which appears reasonable based on the results 
of leaching concentrate and old tailings; however, the testwork is limited but the results were comfirmed 
with historic testworks made by Penoles.  

One area of concern in the cyanide leaching plant is that the process water used at La Encantada is 
slightly saline and testwork conducted thus far has been with standard potable water.  It may well be 
that the use of plant process water will be of no consequence but, until this is tested, this uncertainty 
remains.

19.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

La Encantada uses conventional, manual methods, assisted by computer databases, to calculate the 
tonnage and average grades of the mineral resources and reserves.  FMS has initiated the compilation of 
all data to incorporate it into a database and create a geologic model in SURPAC software which has been 
acquired by the company.  FMS has reviewed and calculated resources and reserves for La Encantada to 
assess the current status of the property and to use it as a basis for future updated estimates.  FMS 
assumed control of La Encantada Silver Mine operation from November 2006.  FMS estimated the first 
resource/reserve base for the La Encantada mine as of May 31, 2007.  This estimate is an update of 
October 31, 2007, resource/reserve base and it incorporates exploration and underground development 
results for the mine.  During the current period, November, 2007 to September 2008, La Encantada 
mined a total of about 205,000 tonnes of ore, from which only 90,000 tonnes were mined out of the 
previously reported reserves and also increased the reserves during the period to about 5.2 million tones, 
including 4.0 million tones of tailings to be processed by cyanidation.  This resource/reserve update 
calculation has been estimated as of September 30, 2008. 

19.1 Introduction 

FMS estimated proven and probable reserves, as of October 31, 2007, amounted to 1.2 million tonnes at 
an average grade of 312 g/tonne Ag and 1.77 percent Pb.  Cutoff grade was estimated as 256 g/tonne 
Ag only, and 241 g/tonne Ag equivalent net of Pb credit.  The estimated reserves were included in the 
deposits of:  Breccia Milagros, Azul y Oro, Breccia Keylor, Cuerpo 660, Mantos 314, Chicotón Stope, San 
Francisco, La Piedra, Cola Gallo deposits and some dumps. 

FMS has implemented exploration programs based on drifting, drilling and channel sampling.  During this 
reported period, October, 2007 through September 2008, FMS has increased the silver contained in the 
resource/reserve base for the La Encantada mine by about 31 percent including proven and probable 
reserves and measured and indicated resources.  Additional inferred resources have been delineated and 
other exploration targets are under further investigations.  Additional resources and reserves were 
developed within the La Encantada mine in the Breccia Milagros, Bonanza, San Francisco, Azul y Oro and 
Jorobada deposits.  A new discovery was made during the drilling program of the Azul y Oro deposit, the 
Buenos Aires deposit, which has been currently estimated in additional resources for La Encantada in 
excess of 536,000 tonnes of Indicated Resources at an average grade of 395 g/tonne Ag (7.2 million 
ounces of silver equivalent) and 560,000 tonnes of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 339 
g/tonne Ag (6.5 million ounces of silver equivalent).  Silver equivalent includes Pb credits.  Dump 
materials and tailings dams have been sampled and measured resulting in additional reserves and 
resources for the La Encantada mine. 

19.2 Methodology 

Under the La Encantada mine's diverse geologic environment, the resource and reserve blocks have been 
defined at the various drift levels where sampling has found mineable ore within the mineralized zones.  



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 19.2 
90533  February 26, 2009 

The reserve tonnage and grade are based largely on channel samples along drifts, crosscuts and other 
mine workings.  Drilling from underground sites was initiated to explore the San Francisco, Breccia 
Milagros, San Javier and Azul y Oro mineralized structures to depth.  This program was completed with 
29 drill holes and a total depth of 6,660 meters.  FMS's surface drilling program has been on hold due to 
delay in delivery of geophysical exploration program report. 

Reserve and resource blocks range in length according to variable extensions of breccia or mineralized 
zones, and are from 50 to 150 meters in length along the mineralized structures.  The resource and 
reserve blocks are developed by drifting across breccia zones and structures.  Proven reserve blocks are 
projected up to 15 meters from the drift in which the channel samples were taken, and Probable blocks 
extending another 25 meters beyond the proven blocks where the geology and mine developments may 
allow. 

All adits, drifts ramps and access development headings are regularly surveyed by La Encantada staff.  
The mineralized zones are subdivided into vertical sections through the multiple horizontal levels, such 
that each vertical section has 10 meter horizontal separation from the immediately adjacent sections.  For 
reserve estimation, the cross sectional area of mineralization is drawn on each of these 10 meter spaced 
sections using Auto CAD software and the assayed sample lengths.  The volume of mineralization on 
each section is calculated for the mineralized zone extending 5 meters on either side of the section.  The 
density factor (specific gravity) is then input into the calculation, and tonnage is calculated based on the 
formula; Length (in meters) X Width (in meters) X Height (in meters) X Specific Gravity = tonnes of 
material. 

The density factor used to convert reserve block volumes into tonnes has been determined as a weighted 
average from ore samples representative of the various deposit areas.  The density tests were performed 
by Peñoles and by FMS.  Numerous samples have been sent to an external lab (Inspectorate Lab) for 
determination.  Currently FMS has carried out density tests of representative samples of the different 
deposits within the mine.  Breccia Milagros samples density determinations have reported an average of 
2.98, El Plomo area (3.07), Bonanza (3.14), San Javier (2.75) and Dique San Francisco (2.96).  La 
Encantada continues to follow a conservative approach by taking an average density of 2.70. 

PAH believes that, on average, the density for mineralization is reasonable.  PAH recommends that 
additional representative samples be taken periodically, as checks for bulk density determination, to 
ensure and properly adjust the application of an appropriate density factor as required.  

To estimate the average grade and thickness for each 10 meter section that crosses a reserve block, La 
Encantada composites all the sample grades in the drift that occur within 5 meters on either side of the 
section.  La Encantada has determined that the most appropriate filter for grade outliers is to assign a 
top grade of 1,000 g/tonne Ag to those samples.  The total length of samples in the composite is then 
divided by the total number of composites, giving the average width of the mineralization in the drift at 
that section.  Similarly, the average silver grade of the samples, weighted by length, gives the average 
silver grade for the drift at that section. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 19.3 
90533  February 26, 2009 

The tonnes and grade for each reserve block are then determined by combining the tonnes and grade 
results obtained for each 10 meter section that crosses the block.  The resource block tonnes and grade 
are tabulated by La Encantada personnel on a series of spreadsheet summaries. 

PAH notes that the sampling conducted across the mineralized zones for use in the reserve estimates is 
done with cutoff grade and width considerations, at a minimum mining width of 2.00m.  This minimum 
width typically includes zones within the structures that are above the cutoff grade, as well as sub-ore 
grade mineralization below the cutoff grade, in which case La Encantada eliminates these areas when 
possible.  

PAH also notes that in a few local areas, the drift is wholly enclosed by the mineralized structures and, 
unless there are some additional crosscuts or drilling, the vein width is taken as that measured across the 
confines of the drift opening.  PAH recommends that the true structure widths, measured by cross cuts 
and/or the drill holes, be used as much as possible in the blocks of reserve and resource estimation.  

The reserve blocks estimated by La Encantada are exclusive of the resource blocks. 

In PAH's opinion the reserve and resource block estimates carried out by La Encantada have been 
reasonably prepared and conform to acceptable engineering standards for reporting of reserves. 

19.3 Cutoff Grade Calculations 

PAH has used more conservative metal prices than those used by First Majestic, mainly because most 
pricing used by the company is much higher than current international pricing levels, and PAH has chosen 
more conservative pricing in view of the current international economic trends.  PAH's prices are about 
13.4 percent lower than First Majestic's prices.  A comparison of metals prices is shown in Table 19-1. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19.3.1      Underground Mine Cut-Off Grade 

For the current reserve, PAH has calculated breakeven cutoff grades for both the underground mine 
operations and also the dump recovery program.  The basic parameters applicable to the cutoff grade

in Section 25.8.2 of this report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Equating the parameters in the above table (U/G mine only), the breakeven cutoff grade for silver (CAg), 
based solely on silver for total operating costs (Table 25-13) and process recoveries anticipated is as 
follows: 
 
CMAg =Total operating costs/ (silver price X mill recovery X smelter payable metal) 

CMAg= $55.01/($12.00 X 0.60 X 0.95) = 8.04 oz Ag per tonne or 250 g Ag/t. 

However, there is a lead contribution for La Encantada ores.  Production of lead in the concentrates from 
the mine only throughSeptember 2008 is about 777.5 tonnes.  The calculation for lead contribution is as 
follows: 

 Revenues for Mine from lead (Rm) = Lbs lead in concentrates X payable from smelter X 
lead price: 

  Rm =777.5 t  X  2204.6 lbs/t  X  0.90  X $0.75 

  Rm = $1,157,002 

  Rm/ tonnes mined & milled = $1,157,002/ 136,326 t    = $8.49/t 

The silver equivalent of lead contribution = $8.49 /$12.00 = 0.71 oz Ag/t or 22 g Ag/t.

The adjusted mine cutoff grade  (CMAg) is then: 250 g Ag/t -22 g Ag/t = Ag = 228 g 
Ag/t. 

19.3.2 Mine Dump Recovery Cutoff Grade 

The basic parameters used for the cutoff grade calculations for the recovery of dump material are shown 
in Table 19-3 as follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Equating these parameters (dumps only), the breakeven cutoff grade for mining and processing of the in-
situ dumps, based solely on silver for the total operating costs (Table 25-14) and process recoveries 
anticipated, is as follows: 
 
CDAg = Total Operating Costs/ (silver price X mill recovery X smelter payable metal). 

CDAg = $40.98/ ($12.00 X 0.55 X 0.95) = 6.54 oz Ag/t or 203 g Ag/t. 

A lead contribution is also applicable for recovery of dump material.  About  

183 tonnes of lead in concentrates have been produced through September2008.  The calculation for the 
lead contribution is as follows: 

Revenues for lead from Dumps (Rd)= Lbs in concentrates X payable from smelter X lead 
price: 

  Rd = 183 tonnes X 2204.6 lbs/t X 0.90 X $0.75 

Rd = $272,323

  Rd per tonne of dumps processed = $272,323/42,155 = $6.46/t. 

Ag Equivalent per tonne = Rd/ Ag price = $6.46/$12.00 = 0.54 oz  Ag/t or 17 g Ag/t. 

Adjusted Cut-off Grade (CDAg) for dumps = 203 g Ag/t – 17Ag/t =  186 g Ag/t.  

19.3.3      Tailings Recovery Cutoff Grade 

First Majestic is constructing a new 3,500-tpd processing plant, principally for the recovery of silver 
values from the flotation tailings.  This plant will employ a grinding circuit with thickeners, counter-
current decantation and a Merrill-Crowe metals recovery system.  PAH has calculated a breakeven cutoff 
grade for the recovery of silver from the tailings, based on the parameters such as plant recoveries and 
operating costs set forth in First Majestic's metallurgical test-work reports, and that First Majestic will 
send silver-gold precipitates to La Parrilla unit, where bullion bars will be produced.  The basic 
parameters used for the Tailings Recovery cutoff grade estimation are shown in Table 19-4. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The cutoff grade for the tailings is calculated with the formula: 

CTAgt = Total Operating Costs/(Plant recovery X silver price X payable metal) 

 CTAg  = $17.00/(0.40 X $12.00 X 0.995) 

 CtAg = 3.56 oz Ag/t or 111 g Ag/t

19.4 Reserve Estimates 

PAH has reviewed La Encantada reserve update of September 30, 2008 along with factors for mining 
dilution and recovery.  In addition, the sampling methods, assaying procedures, compositing methods, 
data handling, cutoff grade application and grade calculations were reviewed.  Several reserve blocks 
were cross-checked to track data handling from the initial assays to the final tonnage and grade 
calculation to ensure that the stated methods and practices were observed. 

La Encantada has estimated mineable Reserves for the following deposits: 

 Breccia Milagros 
 Azul y Oro 
 Breccia Keylor 
 Cuerpo 660 
 Mantos 314 
 Breccia Chicotón 
 Cedritos 
 Cola Gallo 
 Bonanza 
 San Francisco 
 La Piedra, and 
 Stockpiles at the mine and at the plant patios. 

 
The total "in-situ" diluted hard rock Reserve at a minimum mining width of 2.00m, as reviewed by PAH, is 
1.209 million tonnes averaging 343 grams (11 oz) per tonne silver and 2.39 percent (53 lb/tonne) lead, 
for a total of 13.9 million contained ounces of silver net of lead credit.  Additional reserves were 
estimated from Tailings Dam No. 1, which contains about 4.0 million tones at an average grade of 168 
g/tonne (5.4 oz/tonne) silver at estimated at a Cutoff Grade of 111 g/tonne silver, to be reprocessed by 
cyanidation.  As discussed previously in the calculation methodology section, the proven ore category has 
been projected up to 15 meters from the drift sample data, while the probable ore category is projected 
another 15 meters beyond the proven ore. 
 
La Encantada has been processing pre-screened dump materials.  Results for the month of September 
2008 indicate that screened dumps yield about 40 percent of tonnage with increased silver grade from 
about 67 g/tonne to about 131 g/tonne; therefore, the dump materials have been included as an 
indicated resource due to silver content of an average grade below the cutoff grade.  Estimated 
recovered screened tonnage from the measured dumps is about 225,000 tonnes.  Table 19-5 presents a 
summary of La Encantada proven and probable reserves.  Figure 19-1 shows Buenos Aires resource 
blocks.  Figure 19-2 shows Breccia Milagros reserves.  Figure 19-3 shows Azul y Oro resource blocks.  
Figure 19-4 shows San Francisco Dike reserve blocks.

Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 19.13 
90533  February 26, 2009 

La Encantada deposits occur in breccia zones and faults or fracturing intersections that make wide and 
irregular deposits.  These generally present widths greater than 2.00m which is estimated to be the 
minimum mining width due to the mining equipment in use at the mine.  Therefore, mining dilution is 
only significant when the mining is developed along narrow structures.  Provisions have been taken to 
include the mining dilution for those areas. 

19.5 Resource Estimation 

Resource calculations by FMS at La Encantada are based on projections of the mineralized zones in the 
underground mine workings; 10m to 15m beyond the areas of reserves for the measured resources; and 
another 15m beyond the boundaries of the measured resources for the blocks of indicated resources. 
inferred resources are estimated by projecting up to 50m beyond the indicated resource block boundaries 
along mineralized structures, and another 15m beyond the blocks' width.  The estimated resource blocks 
may be limited by underground levels and previous mining extraction.  Longitudinal projections depend 
on the drift development along the mineralized zones and it may vary from about 50m up to 150m in 
length. 

La Encantada mineral resource estimates were applied only to adjacent blocks from the estimated 
reserves.  Resource estimates were made for blocks that include only oxidized mineralization, such as the 
Breccia Keylor, Azul y Oro, Breccia Milagros, Cuerpo 660, Cuerpo 660 W and San Francisco deposits.  
Sulfides mineralization is only estimated in the La Morena deposit.  Sulfides are only considered as 
resources because the processing facilities for the zinc circuit at the plant are not currently operating.  

The grade for these blocks is determined from the grade estimated for the adjacent reserve blocks, and 
sampling in mine workings and drill holes located within the block area. 

Geologic potential still exists within the mine's area to investigate targets that may result in additional 
resource development for La Encantada.  Exploration and full development of breccia zones, such as: 
Milagros, San Javier, Keylor, San Francisco and Azul y Oro may result in high-tonnage resource 
development.  The Breccia Milagros appears to be a significant deposit.  Other areas that appear to 
represent important targets for exploration are breccia La Escalera and the area west of the La Prieta 
deposit beyond the María Isabel fault.  This area appears to be downthrown to the west of La Prieta 
deposit, which represents the largest known deposit within La Encantada area.   

In addition to the reserves, La Encantada has estimated resources in blocks within the following areas: 

 Buenos Aires 
 Breccia Milagros 
 Azul y Oro area 
 Breccia Keylor 
 Cuerpo 660 E and W 
 Bonanza 
 Ojuelas Ampliación

Additional inferred resources have been projected in the Azul y Oro, Buenos Aires, Breccia San Javier, 
Bonanza, Intrusivo Milagros and San Francisco zones. 

La Encantada's estimate of measured and indicated resource blocks as reviewed by PAH, is shown in 
Table 19-6.  The measured and indicated silver resources consist of 5.4 million tonnes averaging 176 
grams (5.6 oz) per tonne silver, for a total content of 33.4 million ounces of silver equivalent.  This 
resources grade has been estimated "in situ", and the silver equivalent content is net of lead credit, at 22 
g/tonne Ag.  The tailings dams No.1 and No.2 and dumps material have been included as indicated 
resources.  This estimate is based on the following prices: Ag - $12.00/oz and Pb - $0.75 / lb. 

Table 19-6 is the measured and indicated resource estimate for La Encantada.  PAH notes that these 
resources are in addition to the previously reported reserves. 

La Encantada has estimated additional silver resources at a distance beyond the proven and probable 
reserves.  These additional resources lack sufficient drifting, raising, sampling, drill holes or old workings 
with production data, and are estimated at a lower degree of confidence than other reserve or resource 
categories.  PAH considers these additional resources to be of an inferred category and they are based on 
projections of presumed vein continuity ahead, above, and below current mining; and are based on very 
widely-spaced drill holes, surface sampling or old surface workings.  These resources are presented by La 
Encantada as inferred resources. 

Each reserve and resource category presented in this Report are exclusive of each other. 

The inferred resources need considerable grade and tonnage information before they can be "proved up" 
to "Mineable Reserves."  To date, La Encantada has demonstrated a continuity along about 4.0 
kilometers of strike length and down dip to about 700 meters; so it is reasonable to assume that in the 
future resources will continue to be converted to ore as additional drifting, crosscutting and raising define 
vein configurations, sampling and assaying determine the grade, and diamond drilling confirms vein 
extensions and fills in data gaps.  Inferred resources for La Encantada are presented in the lower portion 
of Table 19-6.  Inferred resources are exclusive of reserves and measured and indicated resources.

19.6 Conclusion 

PAH believes that these reserve and resource estimates have been reasonably prepared and conform to 
acceptable engineering standards for reporting of resources.  PAH believes that the classification of the 
reserves and resources meets the standards of Canadian National Instrument NI 43-101 and the 
definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM). 

The reserves and resources herein reported by La Encantada Silver Mine were reviewed by PAH and 
constitute part of an operation by Minera La Encantada, a Mexican subsidiary of FMS.  There are no 
significant technical, legal, environmental, political or other kind of restrictions; therefore, in PAH's 
opinion these reserves and resources may not be materially affected by issues that could prevent their 
extraction and processing.

20.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

La Encantada mine has been in operation for over 25 years.  Reported silver production for that period by 
Peñoles is about 80 million ounces of silver, in addition to significant lead content and minor gold.  This 
production was extracted from about 6 Million tonnes of ore. 

Historical mineral concentrations at La Encantada consist of mineralized breccia pipes (chimneys) and 
metasomatic zones, which typically contain up to 2.0 million tonnes; breccia zones that range up to 1.0 
million tonnes; vein deposits that may contain up to 0.5 million tonnes, and mantos or bedded deposits 
that may hold up to 50,000 tonnes of usually high grade concentrations. 

Major underground workings were developed by Peñoles at La Encantada, to connect the various parts of 
the mine, as well as to explore and mine mineralized zones within the Aurora limestone/dolomite 
formation.  These workings extend along a 4km-long mineralized structural zone, with access to mine 
levels at elevations of 1,535m to about 2,300m.  These connections are accessible by shafts and ramps. 

Through the underground development, numerous exploration targets have been projected, identified or 
discovered. 

At the closure of La Encantada mine by Peñoles in June 2002, several exploration targets remained to be 
investigated.  Some of these areas require significant development as well as drilling from underground 
locations, such as Breccia Milagros, Breccia San Javier, Bonanza zone, Mantos San Francisco, etc.  Other 
longer-term exploration targets may result in discoveries which may be as significant as those previously 
mined such as La Prieta and La Escondida, these areas are La Escalera, Ojuela and Cuerpo 660. 

Other important areas for future development by FMS are represented by primary sulfide mineralization 
located at depth, in proximity to the granodiorite intrusive stocks, such as Cuerpo La Morena, Cuerpos 
660 E and W, and Ojuela, which may enhance and extend La Encantada mine life. 

La Encantada exploration investigations have resulted in validation and a significant increment of previous 
reserve and resource estimates.  Proven and probable reserve estimates as of September 30, 2007 are 
about 70 percent higher than the reserves estimated for May 31, 2007, while measured and indicated 
resources were augmented nearly 500 percent, including tailings from previous Peñoles operations, which 
have been tested for processing by cyanidation.  Inferred resources are also increased by about 30 
percent.  Numerous additional exploration targets have been identified by La Encantada staff. 

During the exploration program for 2008, La Encantada exploration team discovered additional resources 
while drilling another target.  The new area has been denominated Buenos Aires and partially 
investigated with about 15 drill holes resulting in indicated and inferred resources containing about 
536,000 tonnes of Indicated Resources at an average grade of 395 g/tonne Ag (7.2 million ounces of 
silver equivalent) and 560,000 tonnes of Inferred Resources at an average grade of 339 g/tonne Ag (6.5 
million ounces of silver equivalent).  Silver equivalent includes Pb credits.  Additional drilling and 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 20.2 
90533  February 26, 2009 

underground development are in progress to further define the mineral deposit and upgrade the 
resources.    

In PAH's opinion, La Encantada has developed a highly successful exploration program based on 
underground development and drilling which has resulted in increasing resources and reserves and 
identifying other exploration targets; therefore, La Encantada investments in exploration and 
development have been well justified. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 21.1

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Recorded production in about 25 years by Minera La Encantada, S.A. de C.V. is approximately 6.0 million 
tonnes of ore at an average grade of Ag-418 g/t (13.44 oz/t) and Pb-9.83 percent (over 80 million 
ounces of silver and about 1.3 billion lbs of lead) until June 2002 when Peñoles shut the operation down.  
Mining and processing by FMS through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Desmín and Minera La Encantada, 
was approximately 175,000 tonnes of ore to October 31, 2007.  

Mineralization at La Encantada is a typical assemblage of metasomatic deposits with a high content of 
silver and lead.  This mineral assemblage has been affected by a long process of oxidation and secondary 
enrichment.  The most important mineralization consists of unconsolidated massive concentrations of 
oxides including hematite, limonite and other iron oxides as well as carbonates and sulphates, including 
the minor presence of zinc oxides.  Silver and lead represent the main economic minerals within the 
oxidized deposits at La Encantada.  Silver mineralization occurs as argentite and native silver.  Lead 
mineralization is present as carbonates (cerussite) and sulfates (anglesite) and other oxides. 

La Encantada mineral assemblage occurs within a range of about 435m in vertical extension (2035m to 
1600m asl).  Below the 1600m elevation, at the La Morena deposit in the SW portion of La Encantada 
area, primary sulfide mineralization has been identified.  This mineralization includes primarily sphalerite, 
galena and pyrite.  FMS has identified other regional areas of geologic interest.  These areas appear to 
represent potential exploration targets that may extend the mineralized system.  

FMS initiated preliminary drilling, during the period of June through October, 2007 while expecting new 
drill rigs to carry out a more comprehensive drilling program to investigate several targets.  Exploration 
investigations during this period by La Encantada staff have resulted in about 6.2 million tonnes of 
additional reserve and resource blocks within the mining areas.  These include dumps materials and 
tailings being investigated by FMS as resources.  A new mineralized zone located within the Azul y Oro 
and La Escalera breccia zones was recently discovered by diamond drilling.  Currently it is estimated to 
contain about 850,000 tonnes of silver mineralization containing about 13 million ounces of silver 
equivalent.  This area requires of additional drilling for upgrading the currently delineated resources.   

The mine was initially developed from the shafts as a conventional operation with rail haulage levels, and 
utilizing standard rail-bound loading and hauling equipment.  Subsequently, La Encantada mine has been 
converted to a mainly trackless operation, although rail haulage is still used on a few of the deeper levels 
of the mine.  

The main access to the current mine operations is a trackless adit at the 1,870 elevation.  This working 
has been enlarged to accommodate 20-t capacity highway-type dump trucks for ore and waste haulage 
from the mine.  Drifts and ramps are driven with cross-sectional area of about 3- X 3- meters, and the 
enlarged drifts and ramps to accommodate the larger dump trucks are about 4.5- X 5.0- meters in cross-
section.  Most areas of the mine are unsupported, but in a few places, rock bolts and wire mesh has been 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 21.2 
90533  February 26, 2009 

installed, and in other heavy ground areas, it has been necessary to install steel arches with timber 
lagging. 

A ramp system in the interior of the mine provides access for low-profile diesel mobile equipment up to 
the 2035 level and down to the 1710 level.  The portion of the ramp above the 1870 level is being 
enlarged to accommodate the highway-type dump trucks.  Mining operations at La Encantada mine are 
partially mechanized.  Drilling of headings for both development and stoping is accomplished using 
pneumatic hand-held jackleg machines.  Loading and tramming is done with diesel-powered, low profile 
front-end loaders (load-haul-dumps, or LHD's), and haulage is usually with highway-type diesel rear-
dump trucks, or battery powered rail haulage trains.   

The ore processed at La Encantada is a complex mixture of oxide and sulfide minerals and is 
consequently difficult to process efficiently.  The principal economic minerals are as follows: 

 Argentite (Ag2S) 
 Acanthite (Ag2S) 
 Cerussite (PbCO3) 

 
The ore is relatively soft and friable, which is easily crushed and milled.  The ore processing method 
consists of crushing and grinding followed by two sequential flotation steps.  The first consists of sulfide 
mineral flotation and the second is oxide mineral flotation.  Installed capacity at La Encantada is 800 tpd; 
however, it is currently operated at about 800 tpd.  Recoveries are modest, a reflection of the difficult 
mineralogy of the rock; operating costs are modest, a consequence of the softness of the rock. 

FMS are currently building a 3,500 tpd cyanide leach plant and plans are to switch from flotation 
processing to cyanidation of the mined ore and to process it in conjunction with reclaimed tailings that 
have accumulated on the site over the prior decades of operation.  There is some uncertainty as to the 
outcome of this plan since it is based on limited testwork.  The plant will go into operation in the second 
quarter of 2009 and actual results established by yearend.  

Peñoles estimated proven and probable reserves as of December 2002 amounted to 484,857 tonnes at 
an average grade of 570 g/t Ag and 3.98 percent Pb.  No cutoff grade was reported.  The estimated 
reserves were included in the deposits of: Bonanza, El Milagro, Estructuras Irregulares Bonanza, 
Estructuras Irregulares San Javier, Breccia San Javier, Ojuelas, San Francisco, and Azul y Oro deposits. 

FMS has initiated exploration programs based on drifting, channel sampling, drilling, geophysical 
investigations and some geochemical studies.  Peñoles reported (2002) reserve or resource blocks are a 
primary target for confirmation, validation and further exploration by FMS, as well as other promising 
areas of reserves. 

PAH has reviewed La Encantada Reserve update of October 31, 2007, along with factors for mining 
dilution and recovery.  In addition, the sampling methods, assaying procedures, compositing methods, 
data handling, cutoff grade application and grade calculations were reviewed.  Several reserve blocks 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 21.3 
90533  February 26, 2009 

were cross-checked to track data handling from the initial assays to the final tonnage and grade 
calculation to ensure that the stated methods and practices were observed. 

La Encantada has estimated mineable reserves for the following deposits: 

 Breccia Milagros 
 Azul y Oro 
 Breccia Keylor 
 Cuerpo 660 
 Mantos 314 
 Breccia Chicotón 
 Cedritos 
 Cola Gallo 
 Ojuelas 
 San Javier 
 La Morena, and 
 San Francisco 

 
The total "in-situ" diluted Reserve as of September 30, 2008, at a minimum mining width of 2.00m, as 
reviewed by PAH, is 5.2 million tonnes including 4.0 million tones of tailings, averaging 208 grams (6.7 
oz) per tonne silver and 2.42 percent (53 lb/tonne) lead, for a total of 35.5 million contained ounces of 
silver net of lead credit.  The tailings appear to be amenable for reprocessing by cyanidation; therefore, 
they have been included as probable reserves. 

In addition to reserves, the La Encantada holds measured and indicated mineral resources that include 
estimates for the following areas:  Azul y Oro, Buenos Aires, Breccia Milagros, Cuerpo 660, Cuerpo 660 W 
and Breccia Keylor deposits.  Sulfide mineralization is only estimated in the La Morena deposit.  Sulfides 
are only considered as Resources because the processing facilities for the zinc circuit at the plant are 
currently out of order.  Dump materials have been screened, concentrated, and processed in the flotation 
plant to fill operating capacity, and have been included as resources after screening.  Estimated resources 
for La Encantada Silver Mine total 5.4 million tonnes at an average grade of 176 g/tonne (5.7 oz/tonne) 
Ag and 1.40 percent (31 lb/tonne) Pb.  Measured and indicated resources to September 30, 2008, are 
estimated to contain about 33.1 million ounces of silver equivalent net of lead credit. 

In addition to measured and indicated resources, La Encantada has estimated about 2.6 million tonnes of 
inferred resources at an average grade of 220 g/tonne (7 oz/tonne) Ag and 1.0 percent (22 lb/tonne) Pb, 
for a total silver equivalent of 20.0 million ounces. 

To date, La Encantada has demonstrated a continuity along approximately 4.0 kilometers of strike length 
and down dip for about 700 meters; so it is reasonable to assume that in the future resources will 
continue to be converted to ore as additional drifting, crosscutting and raising define vein configurations, 
sampling and assaying determine the grade, and diamond drilling confirms vein extensions and fills in 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 21.4 
90533  February 26, 2009 

data gaps.  Geophysical investigations carried out during the period have confirmed previously delineated 
anomalous zones which require of a drilling program from surface sites. 

During the period of January to September 2008 the La Encantada mine operation totaled 178,480 
tonnes of silver mineralization which was extracted from previously estimated reserves (70,000 tonnes) 
and from other areas (108,480 tonnes) that were discovered during the development for extraction of the 
reserves.  

All reserve and resource blocks at La Encantada are exclusive of each category. 

PAH believes that these reserve and resource estimates have been reasonably prepared and conform to 
acceptable engineering standards for reporting of reserves and resources.  PAH believes that La 
Encantada Silver Mine classification of reserves and resources meets the standards of Canadian National 
Instrument NI 43-101 and the definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 
(CIM). 

An economic analysis of FMS's La Encantada Silver Mine indicates that the mine's reserve/resources may 
be extracted at a profit, and PAH did not identify any significant technical, legal, environmental, political 
or other kind of restrictions; therefore, in PAH's opinion these reserves and resources may not be 
materially affected by issues that could prevent their extraction and processing. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 22.1

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

La Encantada Silver Mine has been in operation since the 1950s, with intense extraction and processing 
operations from the early 1970s.  Its production, by Peñoles records, amounts to over 80 million ounces 
of silver and over 1.3 billion pounds of lead.  La Encantada is by no means exhausted; its geologic 
potential remains to be fully explored.  Several zones within the mine area have been identified that may 
contain significant mineralization, such as Breccia La Escalera, Breccia Milagros, Breccia San Javier and 
others that enable the operators to increase La Encantada's production.  Aside from the oxidized 
mineralization, there are sulfide deposits identified within the skarn areas at Cuerpo 660, La Morena and 
deeper areas under the La Prieta and La Escondida chimneys.  These areas require intense exploration 
direct methods, such as diamond drilling and drifting. 

FMS has initiated an aggressive program of exploration based on drifting and diamond drilling. 
Preliminary results of this program have resulted in a significant increment of resources and reserves for 
the La Encantada Silver Mine for the period between June and October, 2007.  For instance, the Breccia 
Milagros and the San Francisco areas have produced high grade ores through exploration development 
and appear to be developing into significant ore deposits. Exploration drilling for the Azul y Oro zone has 
intersected other mineralized zone located between the Azul y Oro and the La Escalera breccia zones 
denominated as Buenos Aires.  This zone consists of a series of mineralized structures containing high 
grade silver mineralization which full extension is being investigated.  

PAH agrees with the continued implementation of the exploration program and recommends additional 
support for exploration activities at La Encantada.  Positive results would develop resources into reserves 
and extend the mine's life. 

Care must be taken to prioritize the exploration targets since the area holds a broad potential for 
development and possible discovery of new ore bodies.  Potential high volume areas should have priority 
in the exploration program, since these large volume deposits could potentially help to lower mine 
operating costs. 

FMS has suggested an exploration budget of US$2.50 Million for 2009 at La Encantada.  If successful, this 
program may result in a significant increment of resources and additional reserves.  The program 
includes approximately 7,850 meters of drilling from underground sites and 5,000 meters from surface 
locations.  Underground exploration development in drifting, access ramps, crosscutting and drill sites 
preparation amounts to about 850 meters for the year.  The budget for this program also includes 
geochemical sampling of about 500 samples to validate geophysical exploration targets.  PAH believes 
that this exploration program, budget and exploration targets are reasonable for continued investigation 
the La Encantada geologic potential.  Table 22-1 shows the La Encantada exploration budget for 2009.  

PAH recommends that La Encantada follow budgeted capital-expenditure plans for the ore processing 
facilities.  With the exception of the funds budgeted to complete the cyanidation plant, the plan is generic 
with a fixed annual amount for ongoing capital expenditures. The estimated 2009 cost for completing the  



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 22.2 
90533  February 26, 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cyanidation plant is $8.2 million of the 21.5 million original budget and the ongoing annual ore-
processing-related capital expenditure estimate is $135,000. 

Much of the mines mobile equipment at La Encantada is very old and requires replacement.  FMS has a 
plan in place to replace some of the older mine equipment in the near future and has purchased some 
new units in 2008 and plans additional purchases in 2009. 

PAH has noted the possibility of significant ground movements that may affect the integrity of either or 
both the San Francisco and Maria Isabel Shafts, which are the major ore hoisting and service facilities for 
the mine.  In addition, the geotechnical studies should also include ground control methods at the mine 
and recommendations for improvement. The estimated cost of the initial geotechnical study will range 
from $150,000 to $250,000. 

PAH also notes that the ventilation system in the mine is inadequate and much improvement is needed.  
A comprehensive survey and study of the ventilation system and corresponding recommendations by an 
outside expert is recommended.  The estimated cost of the initial survey will be in the range of $100,000 
to $250,000. 

The Capital expenditures suggested for the plant and mine are scheduled to improve the operation and, 
through a successful exploration program, increase the mine's reserves and resources and therefore the 
mine life.   A summary of the PAH recommendation is found in Table 22-1.

25.0 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON               
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

25.1 Introduction 

La Encantada Silver Mine is located in the municipality of Ocampo in the northwestern part of the state of 
Coahuila, Mexico.  The mining district in which La Encantada is located is the David Contreras (La 
Encantada) district.  Mining has been carried out in La Encantada area since the early 1940s with some 
limited extraction of high-grade lead-silver oxides from the skarn deposits of the area.  Historically ore 
extraction in the district was done by underground methods, and this has been continued at La 
Encantada.   

In the early 1970s a 60/40 joint venture was formed between Lacana Mining of Canada and Industrias 
Peñoles to develop and exploit the silver-lead orebodies discovered at La Encantada.  The joint venture, 
operating under the name of Compañia Minera La Encantada, S.A. de C.V., sank two main production 
shafts for La Encantada project, the San Francisco and the Maria Isabel, and started exploitation of La 
Prieta high-grade silver chimney.  The operator constructed a magnetic separation plant to process the 
ore at project inception, but two years later, replaced the plant with a 1,000 tonnes per day differential 
flotation plant.  All products from this plant are concentrates, which were, and continue to be, marketed 
to the Peñoles Met-Mex smelter, located in the city of Torreón, Coahuila.  Peñoles, as the operator, 
worked the mine steadily from 1974 until 1986, when it was stopped due to poor profitability.  Peñoles 
restarted operations in 1990 after discovery of significant high-grade reserves. 

During the 35 years Peñoles operated the property, about 6.0 million tonnes of mainly oxidized silver-lead 
ores, which averaged about 418 grams Ag and 9.9 percent Pb per tonne, were mined and processed.  In 
2003, Peñoles leased the mine to a small company, Desmín, S.A. de C.V., who operated it from 2003 
until November 2006, when Desmín was acquired by First Majestic Silver Corporation (FMS) giving FMS 
control over the mine. FMS then acquired Minera La Encantada S.A. de C.V. (a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Peñoles) in March 2007 giving FMS complete ownership of the mine.  There was no hiatus in the mine 
production program through the acquisition period, and Desmín continued the operations until First 
Majestic took over in late November 2006.  First Majestic continued with Desmín's development and 
production programs after the acquisition.  FMS made several changes in early 2007, and current 
production is about 20,000 tonnes per month of oxidized silver-lead ores.  Mill feed is not only derived 
from the underground mine, but also from old dump material left by both Peñoles and Desmín; the split 
for the first nine months of FMS operations in 2008 is about 15,000 tonnes per month from the mine and 
6,000 tonnes per month from dump material.  Ore is campaign-milled at the site in the differential 
flotation plant, which was originally constructed by Peñoles in the 1970s.  The mine produces a silver-
lead concentrate, and paid metal production is currently in average for the period of January to 
September about 112,800 ounces of silver and 235,300 pounds of lead per month. 

The historic production from La Encantada has resulted in storage of about 5.0 million tonnes of mainly 
flotation tailings, which still contain significant silver values.  The company is currently constructing a 



Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 25.2 
90533  February 26, 2009 

3,500-tpd process plant in which the tailings will be reprocessed together with mine and dump ore, and 
silver and small amounts of gold will be recovered in a cyanide circuit with a Merrill-Crowe precious 
metals' recovery system.  FMS projects that 3.6 million ounces of silver will be produced per annum, of 
which 1.8 million ounces will be obtained from the old tailings and 1.8 million ounces will be obtained 
from processing mine ore and dump recovery ore.  The new plant is scheduled for startup in the second 
quarter of 2009.  

25.2      Mine Design and Production 

La Encantada mine has largely been developed below ore zones indicated from surface exploration work 
within a block about four kilometers long, 700 meters wide and 500 meters in height.  The mine was 
initially developed from shafts as a conventional operation with rail haulage levels, and utilizing standard 
rail-bound loading and hauling equipment.  Subsequently, La Encantada was converted to a mainly 
trackless operation, although rail haulage is still used on a few levels of the mine. The mine has been 
developed to the northeast of the shafts over a vertical range of about 400 meters from the surface 
(2,035 meters asl) to about the 1525 level (1,525 meters asl), where the water table has been 
encountered.  The mine has not been developed into the large prospective area to the southwest of the 
shafts, which is situated at the southwest boundary of the developed mine area. 

The San Francisco and María Isabel shafts were sunk by the Peñoles-Lacana joint venture, mainly for the 
development and extraction of the Escondida and La Prieta chimneys and these shafts continue to be 
used by the current operators.  The collar elevations of both shafts, which are situated only about 100 
meters apart, is 1,800 meters asl for the María Isabel, and 1805 meters asl for the San Francisco, and the 
depths of both are about 300 meters.  Both the San Francisco and María Isabel Shafts provide access to 
the deeper levels of La Prieta and Escondida areas of the mine.   

The southern-most María Isabel Shaft is L-shaped with a manway cut-out and it is equipped with two in-
balance 3.7-t capacity skips, and a man cage.  The man cage capacity is about 15 people.  The 
furnishings in the shaft are all constructed of steel, including dividers.  The guides for the ore skips are 
cables, and the guides for the man cage are steel H-beams.  The main air lines and electric power cables 
into the mine are installed in the manway compartment of the María Isabel Shaft.  The María Isabel ore 
hoist is a 500-hp Canadian Ingersoll-Rand 2-drum hoist, and the man-hoist is a Vulcan 125-hp 1-drum 
hoist.   

The rectangular San Francisco Shaft is set up for ore hoisting only, with only a small emergency manway 
located in a corner of the shaft.  The Shaft is fitted with two in-balance 4.8-t capacity skips, but has no 
man cage.  The main pumping station for the mine is located on the San Francisco Shaft, and the mine 
pump lines are located in the shaft near the emergency manway.  The San Francisco ore hoist is a 2-
drum 400-hp Canadian Ingersoll-Rand unit. 

The main access to the current mine operations the trackless Los Angeles adit at the 1,870 elevation.  
This working has been enlarged to accommodate 20-t capacity highway-type dump trucks for ore and 
waste haulage from the mine.  Drifts and ramps are driven at a cross-section of about 3 X 3 meters, and 



Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 25.3 
90533  February 26, 2009 

then enlarged to accommodate the larger dump trucks to about 4.5 X 5.0 meters in section.  Most ramps 
are driven at a maximum gradient of 15 percent.  Many areas of the mine are unsupported, but in a few 
places, shotcrete and/or rock bolts and wire mesh or combinations of the same have been installed.  In 
heavy ground areas, it has been necessary to install steel arches with timber lagging. FMS develops most 
of its short raises (<60 meters) by conventional methods, and most raises are driven at a cross-section 
area of about 1.5 X 1.5 meters. Historically long ore and waste pass raises, ventilation raises, etc. have 
been developed by raise boring contractors, and FMS will continue this policy as the need arises. 

A ramp system in the interior of the mine provides access for low-profile diesel mobile equipment up to 
the 2035 level and down to the 1635 level.  The portion of the main ramp above the 1870 level is being 
enlarged to accommodate the highway-type dump trucks. Peñoles established the 1790 main rail haulage 
level (from the María Isabel Shaft) to the stoping and exploration areas northeast of the shaft.  In 
addition a rail level was also developed at the 1635 level.  Both the rail levels are still in use.  A 
longitudinal section of the mine with major shafts, and levels are included in Figure 9-2 of this report. 

Mining operations at La Encantada mine are partially mechanized.  Drilling of headings for both 
development and stoping is accomplished using pneumatic hand-held jackleg machines.  Loading and 
tramming is done with diesel-powered, low profile front-end loaders (load-haul-dumps, or LHD's), and 
haulage is usually with highway-type diesel rear-dump trucks, or battery powered rail haulage trains.   

Before FMS acquired La Encantada from the previous operator, Desmín, little exploration and 
development work had been done in the mine.  Since taking over the operation in November 2006, FMS 
has undertaken an intensive exploration and development effort.  As stated above, some mine workings 
are being slashed out to accommodate highway-type dump trucks, but the advance for these is not 
included in the development totals. 

A diagram of typical drilling patterns for the different sizes of drifts and ramps driven in La Encantada 
Mine are shown in Figure 25-1. 

During the first 9 months of 2008, the average development advance is about 570 meters per month. 
About 146 meters per month are classified as exploration, and the remaining 424 meters per month are 
for stope preparation and other development.  The development totals for 2008 are shown in Table 25-1. 

The principal mining method employed at La Encantada is overhand mechanized cut-and-fill (Figure 25-
2), utilizing development waste for fill.  Ramps are driven in the orebodies and stopes are developed from 
sill drifts driven in the ore zones and slashed out the full width of the ore.  Stopes are drilled with 
jacklegs, and the main blasting agent is a commercial ammonium nitrate product, which is initiated with 
sausages of water-gel explosive primed with cap and fuse.  Rounds are fired with Ignitacord (B-cord) as 
the fuse initiator.  Stopes are mucked with rubber-tired 1.0- to 3.5 yd3 Load-Haul-Dump (LHD's) 
machines, which also tram the broken ore to ore passes or remuck stations.  Completed stope cuts are 
backfilled with development waste, which is passed through raises into the stope or trammed into the 
stope with the LHD units.

90533  February 26, 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A modification of overhand cut and fill stoping that has been adopted for extraction of some breccia pipes 
and chimney orebodies is post pillar stoping, which is essentially a room and pillar method, but on 
multiple horizons.  Post-pillar stopes in La Encantada mine are backfilled with waste, and are mined 
overhand progressing from the sill level to the next level above.  Most development ramps for post pillar 
stoping are developed in waste outside the orebody.  All other parameters for stoping the post pillar 
areas are the same as for a standard mechanized overhand cut and fill stope.  A diagram of a typical La 
Encantada post pillar stope is shown in Figure 25-3. 

Stope production is about 11,200 tonnes per month, and there are currently about 15 stopes in 
production.  The monthly mine production for 2008 is shown in Table 25-2. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Much of La Encantada mine development and stoping work is done by outside contractors, using 
company equipment.  Mucking and haulage operations are done with company crews, and maintenance 
and other mine services are also done with company personnel.  If the company does not have sufficient

personnel to operate the mobile mucking and haulage equipment, the contractors will operate the 
equipment for extra fees.  Ore haulage to the mine patios is done with contractor dump trucks, and ore 
transfers from the patios to the mill crusher bins are also done with outside contractors using their own 
trucks. 

FMS plans to eventually reinitiate extraction of La Prieta and La Escondida abandoned chimneys, which 
were first mined by caving methods by Peñoles in the early years of the mine operation.  The workings 
for the extraction of both chimneys caved in and were lost, with much waste rock material dumped into 
the glory-holes which had holed through to the surface.  The purpose of the waste rock was to stabilize 
the areas proximal to the chimneys.  Some ground movements have occurred in the form of concentric 
cracks around the ore boundaries of the chimneys, and since the chimneys are situated very near to both 
the main production shafts, ground movements could affect the stability of these installations.  In fact 
some cracks in the walls of hoist room of the San Francisco shaft have been noted, apparently as a result 
of caving of the chimneys.  Extraction of remnants left in these chimneys is technically possible, but 
should be delayed until the two shafts are no longer required for production or service.   PAH 
recommends that FMS commission an updated geotechnical study and evaluation of the old mining areas 
near the shafts, so that any potential problem will be revealed and mitigation steps taken. 
 
Mine ventilation is through natural air flows into and out of the mine.  The maximum intake airflow is 
about 40,000 ft³/min. (25 m³/sec.), which is actually air flowing into the upper part of the mine through 
old mine workings.  The maximum exhaust air flow is about 88,000 ft³/min. (54 m³/sec.) through the Los 
Angeles Adit level (1865 level), which is above most of the current active mining levels.  From Figure 25-
4 it can be appreciated that the air flows in most of the mine are very small.  Although aided by using 
auxiliary axial fans, there is much heat buildup and stagnant air in many of the active mine workings.  
This problem is compounded by the use of diesel mobile equipment in the mine.  The ventilation system 
requires a substantial up grade, and First Majestic should commission a ventilation study with 
independent experts, and then proceed to install major fan(s), booster fans and air-flow regulators to 
conduct much greater volumes of fresh air into the mine.  PAH recommends that FMS commission an in-
depth study of the ventilation system as a first step toward upgrading it.  

A separate mine dump recovery effort continues at the mine site.  This operation consists of the 
excavation and screening of old dump material from the previous operations, and transporting the 
screened product to the mill ore bins as supplemental mill feed material. The company uses a portable 
screening plant for the operation and the recovery operation is conducted by a combination of company 
operators and contractors.  This material has been viable if screened to remove coarse waste material, 
and screened material recovered and processed totaled 42,154 tonnes at an average grade of about 119 
gpt Ag during the first nine months of 2008.  A summary of the month by month screened dump material 
recovered and processed during the first nine months of the year is shown in Table 25-3. 

The mine currently operates on two 12-hour shifts per day, 7 days per week.  Crews currently work two 
weeks at site with one week off.   Both contractor crews and company personnel work the same shift 
schedule.  Most company and contractor personnel live in the town of Muzquiz, Coahuila, which is 





Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 25.10 
90533  February 26, 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated about 210 km on paved highways to the northwest of the La Encantada Mine.  The company is 
currently transporting many personnel to and from Muzquiz to the mine site in a company bus.  Peñoles 
constructed and maintained about 180 houses, as well as a primary school, stores and recreational 
facilities in the proximity of the mine site, and FMS has refurbished some of the housing and ancillary 
facilities to accommodate the workforce in company-controlled living quarters: presently much of the 
housing is occupied by contractor personnel, who are working on construction of the new 3,500-tpd 
cyanide plant.  

The current mine workforce as of September 30, 2008 totals 490 people including contractors.  There are 
currently 123 contractors on site, who are engaged in the new cyanide plant construction. A summary of 
personnel at La Encantada as of the end of September is shown in Table 25-4. 

The operations budget for the first 9 months of 2008 is for milling of 136,816 tonnes from the mine and 
53,734 tonnes from the old mine dumps.  The average grades to the mill are budgeted at 345 gpt Ag for 
the mine and 104 gpt Ag for the dumps.  The actual mine tonnes milled through the nine-month period 
total 136,327 tonnes and actual grades through the first 9 months of 2008 have averaged 352 gpt Ag.  
The actual mine dump tonnes removed and processed for the first 9 months of 2008 total 42,154 tonnes 
at an average grade of 119 gpt Ag.  A summary of the 2008 mining and milling budgets for both the 
underground mine and the surface mine dump recovery is found in Table 25-5. 

25.3 Mine Equipment 

Most of the mine equipment used at La Encantada was inherited from the previous operator; Desmín and 
Desmín acquired most it from Peñoles.  As can be appreciated from the table below, much of the mine 
mobile equipment fleet is very old, and FMS management has started a program of replacing much of the

older equipment in the fleet. In fact the company has a purchase agreement with a major supplier, 
Sandvik, to acquire new modern mobile mine equipment.  In addition to supplying the equipment, 
Sandvik contractually agrees to maintain it.  The 2008 mine capital expenditures program included 
purchase of mobile equipment units in several sizes, ranging from 1.0-yd3 to 3.5-yd3 capacity, of primarily 
diesel-powered LHD's.  A summary of La Encantada mine equipment is shown in Table 25-6.

the flotation section is provided in Figure 25-6.  The plant was constructed in 1973 and at that time 
incorporated magnetic separation.  In 1977 the plant was modified to convert it to flotation separation. 

Ore is from two sources: from the underground mine and from old mine dumps with the mine 
contributing about 71 percent of the feed while the processing of dump material accounts for the rest.  
The dump rock is screened ahead of the plant which results in upgrading the rock to about twice the 
grade of unscreened material.  Mine and dump ore are not mixed; they are campaign processed through 
the plant. 

The plant is a simple flotation plant in a single-line arrangement.  Crushing is accomplished using two 
stages of crushing closed on the second stage, and the ore is milled in a single ball mill closed with a 
cyclone.  The mill is rubber lined and is charged with 2-1/2-inch diameter grinding balls.  Sulfide minerals 
and oxide minerals are floated sequentially and both circuits incorporate just one stage of cleaning. 

Concentrates from both the sulfide and oxide circuits are combined in a concentrate thickener.  
Thickened concentrates are filtered on a pressure filter press and the filtered concentrate, which contains 
about 20 percent moisture, is sun dried on a concrete patio to about 10 percent moisture, then trucked 
to the Peñoles smelter at Torreón. 

Tailings are thickened and then pumped to a nearby tailings containment.  Tailings thickener overflow 
and the decant water from the tailings containment are pumped to a recycle-water tank and reused in 
the process. 

25.4.2 Cyanidation Plant 

La Encantada is currently building a 3,500 tonne per day cyanidation plant.  The plant is expected to 
commence operations in the April 2009.  Feed to the plant will be reclaimed tailings and the mined ore 
and waste dump rock currently processed in the existing flotation plant.  The crushing and grinding of the 
mined ore and waste dump rock will continue to be done in existing crushing and grinding equipment.  
The cyanidation plant will incorporate a mill for mild regrinding of reprocessed tailings.  

Principal parameters of the cyanidation plant are presented in Table 25-9 and a listing of the principal 
equipment is shown in Table 25-10.  A general flow diagram of the plant is provided in Figure 25-7 and 
the layout of the plant is shown in Figure 25-8.  

Tailings from the new plant will be pumped to new lined tailings containment in a small valley below the 
plant.  Decant water from the tailings will be pumped back to the plant and reused in the process. 

25.5 Infrastructure 

The infrastructure for La Encantada was very well developed by the previous operators, especially 
Peñoles.  The operations support facilities, located near the plant, include administrative offices, a 
medical clinic, warehouse, airstrip, assay laboratory, power generation plant, fuel storage facilities,

maintenance shops, mine compressor building, surface maintenance shop, mine dry, water storage tanks, 
employee hotel and dining hall, contractor offices and security guard shack.  The Maintenance 
Department operates from the surface shops, and also from an underground shop (840 level), located 
near the center of the mine.  Road maintenance is done with a fleet of company tractors, road grader 
and wheel loaders.  Dump trucks for ore haulage and road maintenance are largely vehicles contracted 
locally.  The company has a passenger bus for transporting operations personnel to and from the town of 
Muzquiz, where most employees have homes. 

The company also has a town constructed by Peñoles, and which is partially occupied at this time.  The 
town site has 180 housing units of which 80 percent are occupied.  There is also a kitchen/dining room 
for salaried staff and some contractor managers and visitors, a primary school, a church, a store, 
recreational facilities, etc.   

The electric power for the operation and supporting infrastructure is generated on-site.  The power 
generation plant consists of three General Motors 3,250 KVA diesel-powered motor generators.  In 
addition there are two 1,000 KVA CAT D399 motor-generator sets for site power, when the mill and 
process plant are idle.  Power consumption is presently about 800,000 kilowatt-hours per month.  The 
new cyanide leach plant will have its own generating plant. 

Potable water for the offices and employee housing is derived from a well in the mine, which penetrates 
below the water table.  The industrial water for the mine and plant is obtained from a series of wells 
located about 25 kilometers from the site.  A system diagram for the industrial water is shown in Figure 
25-9.  This water is pumped to and stored in a number of storage tanks located throughout the plant and 
mine site. 

Communications to and from La Encantada is via satellites, both for wireless internet information 
systems, and also for the telephone system.  Currently the telephone system has two lines.  La 
Encantada has a site radio system for instant communications between all Supervisors and Managers, 
and all surface vehicle operators also have radio communication capabilities. 

There is a FMS owned airstrip located in the broad valley to the northwest of the mine site.  This strip is 
suitable for light planes, and is used for flying in supplies, or for transporting mine personnel, visitors and 
others into and out of La Encantada, and other nearby locations.  The airstrip is 1,200 meters long, 17 
meters wide, and has a gravel surface. 

The site is connected with the national highway system and, although in a remote location, La Encantada 
is reasonably accessible.  The access to the mine from the town of Muzquiz, Coahuila, which lies to the 
northeast of La Encantada, accessible via a 45 kilometers of gravel road, and then another 170 kilometers 
on a paved highway to Muzquiz. 





 
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 25.23 
90533  February 26, 2009 

25.6 Product Marketing 

FMS has a purchase agreement with MET-MEX Peñoles located in the city of Torreón, State of Coahuila, 
México.  The purchase agreement establishes the obligation to sell all mineral production from La 
Encantada mine to the Peñoles smelter assuming other more competitive rates are not available to FMS.  
This, however, is the natural market for concentrates since the MET-MEX Peñoles smelter is the closest 
such facility for shipping La Encantada concentrates.  The contract between La Encantada and Peñoles 
for sales of bulk flotation concentrate is typical for this product.  

La Encantada purchase contract of concentrates with Peñoles includes typical conditions and related 
charges as follows: 

 Each lot is weighed upon receipt and sampled.  La Encantada also weighs and samples the shipments 
at the mine site. 

 Smelting charge per dry tonne of concentrate is $505.00. 
 Freight cost per tonne of concentrate is $29.00. 
 Refining cost per payable kilogram of silver is $48.23. 
 Payables by Peñoles are: 90 percent for contained silver, and all of the contained lead in excess of 3 

percent. 
 

25.7 Environmental Safety Review 

Minera La Encantada has been operating the La Encantada mine since the early 1970s with the necessary 
land-use and water extraction permits in effect for the operation.  FMS has purchase the land surface 
rights, under expropriation procedures from Ejido Tenochtitlán, where the camp, water wells, mine and 
plant installations are located to better manage the property.  Through the years and changes in the 
regulatory framework, La Encantada has been required to update the necessary operation permits. 

In April 24, 2007 La Encantada presented a notification of reactivation of operations at the mine to the 
National Water Commission (C.N.A.), to SEMARNAT, to Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social, and to 
PROFEPA.  La Encantada mine was declared in suspension of activities by Peñoles in 2003.   

PAH's environmental and safety review consisted of discussions with FMS' COO Ing. Ramón Dávila Flores, 
and mine manager and supervisors, Ing. Salvador Hernández, Manager of Operations and other 
personnel.  PAH visited the site to observe the current site safety and environmental conditions and to 
identify any potential liabilities having significant economic impacts, and a briefly reviewed file records 
provided to PAH during the site visit.  PAH's assessment was not intended as an environmental and 
safety compliance audit, although prudent practices were considered in the review.  In PAH's opinion, La 
Encantada is in compliance with regulatory requirements, which are current accoprding to Legal Opinion 
issued by Durango-based Legal Firm of Lic. Carlos Galván Pastoriza issued on October 31, 2008, and 
document on Environmental and Operating Permits issued by Mr. José Luis Hernández Santibañez, 



 
Pincock, Allen & Holt  REVISED 25.24 
90533  February 26, 2009 

Corporate Manager on Environmental and Permitting for FMS, in  a document issued on October 31, 2008 
showing current status and confirmation of the required permits and authorizations. 

In general, surface disturbance related to mining is limited to the access road to the mining levels, waste 
rock dumps at each portal, and auxiliary support areas.  Development waste rock is used for fill inside the 
mine and limits the size of waste rock dumps at the surface.  Most of these activities are carried out on 
land owned by La Encantada.  No acid rock drainage (ARD) is produced from the mine workings. 

PAH noted no visible evidence of ARD on the active and historic tailings deposition areas or spent heap 
leach pile.  The surface of the active tailings impoundment is wetted, which controls fugitive dust 
emissions. 

The grinding area, agitated leach tanks, wash thickeners, cyanide mix tank, and several other process 
vessels in the mill area have spill containment.  There are minimal stormwater control measures to route 
uncontaminated runoff away from the mill or to collect and contain stormwater runoff from around the 
mill site.    

La Encantada has good control of the storage of hazardous chemicals and lubricants at the mill site and 
has installed concrete pads and fenced areas for drums.  

Although Mexican environmental legislation is not explicit in the requirements for remediation, 
reclamation, and closure, the SEMARNAP expresses concern for the preservation and restoration of the 
environment and natural ecosystems in its environmental management guidance for industry.  In fact, 
SEMARNAP recommends that facilities establish and implement a program for remediation of spills and 
releases to the environment. 

La Encantada has not supplied to PAH the estimated costs for reclamation and mine closure of the mine 
or mill and tailings containment areas; however, PAH considers the costs will be low because La 
Encantada owns most of the surface rights where the installations and mine are located.   

PAH's estimate for the costs required to comply with and remediate the environmental issues for the 
project is approximately $150,000 in addition to the salvage value of plant and mine equipment.  These 
costs are based on PAH's experience in mining projects in México, and are not the result of detailed 
analysis.  Actual costs will depend on site conditions and impacts from the operation, regulatory 
requirements at the time of compliance, and corporate environmental management standards. 

25.8 Economic Analysis 

25.8.1 Capital Costs 

The FMS capital expenditures for January to September 2008 total $11.82 million.  The 5-year capital 
budget (2009 thru 2013) is $26.1 million including costs for construction of a new 3,500-tpd cyanide 
plant, existing mill and flotation plant upgrades, power plant upgrades, mine equipment additions and

25.8.2  Operating Costs 

La Encantada operating costs for the first nine months of 2008 have averaged $51.69 per tonne of ore 
processed, inclusive of dump material, which equates to a cost per ounce of silver of $9.09.  The costs 
include downstream concentrate freight and processing costs of about $21.54 per tonne milled or $3.35 
per ounce of silver recovered.  The average combined operating cost for 2008 has averaged about 
$51.69 per tonne milled.  A summary of the combined mine and dump recovery operating costs for the 
first nine months of 2008 is found in Table 25-13. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The average mine-only operating cost is $55.01 per tonne, and also includes costs for concentrate freight 
to the Peñoles' smelter and the downstream processing of the silver-lead concentrates.  The site-only 
operating cost for the mine generated ore has averaged about $33.47 per tonne, and the total cost per 
ounce of silver obtained from mine ore has averaged $4.43 per oz Ag for 2008.  The downstream 
concentrate freight and smelting and refining costs are $21.54 per tonne or $2.85 per oz Ag for the first 
nine months of 2008.   A summary of the mine-only operating costs is shown in Table 25-14.

The average costs for extraction and processing of the old dump material for the first nine months of 
2008 are $40.98 per tonne, or $14.88 per oz Ag produced.  The site-only cost for extraction, screening, 
milling and processing of the old mine dumps is $19.45 per tonne, or $7.06 per ounce.  Concentrate 
freight and downstream smelting and refining for the dump material have averaged an additional $21.54 
per tonne of ore extracted.  

Table 25-15 is a summary of the operating costs for the first nine months of 2008 for the dump recovery 
effort. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The company is currently constructing a 3,500-tpd mill and cyanide processing plant, mainly for 
reprocessing at least 5.0 million tonnes of old tailings, stored below the mine site.  The company 
developed a cost per tonne, and metallurgical recoveries for recovery of silver-and small amounts of gold 
from the old tailings material.  FMS plan to produce silver/gold precipitates in the plant, and are still 
evaluating shipping the precipitate to La Parrilla for smelting into bullion bars, or producing their own 
bullion bars at La Encantada. 

First Majestic has estimated the all-in direct operating costs for tailings recovery, reprocessing, ancillary 
services and downstream costs at about $17.00 per tonne processed.  A breakdown of this cost estimate 
is shown in Table 25-16. 

25.8.3  Economic Analysis 

A simplified production plan has been prepared by First Majestic, and is presented as Table 25-17 and a 
Life of Mine cash-flow is shown in Table 25-18.   First Majestic has predicated this cash flow on bringing 
the new 3,500-tpd mill and cyanide plant on stream during April 2009, after which the shipment of 
flotation concentrates to outside smelters will cease, and mine ore and old tailings will be processed in 
the new plant.  Bullion precipitates will be produced in the new plant and these will be shipped to La

Parrilla Mine for processing into bullion bars.  The First Majestic Life of Mine production plan, included in 
the cash flow, covers the period from January 2009 through December 2015.  However, the Proven and 
Probable ore reserves for the underground mine will be exhausted by 2013 at which time the production 
for the subsequent years will be extracted from the measured and indicated resources.  In the interim, it 
is expected that underground exploration will be advanced through both diamond drilling and drifting, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and those reserves will continually be added over time.  Likewise at planned production rates, the proven 
and probable reserve for the tailings recovery will be exhausted by 2014, and subsequently all production 
will be obtained from the underground mine. 

The basic parameters for the FMS cash flow involve the long-term silver price, which is projected as 
$12/ounce.  The average projected long-term gold price is about $708 per oz Au, while the lead price is 
projected at $0.75/lb.  No escalation was considered for operating costs and expenses.  Reclamation 
expenditures are considered spent in the last three years of the period. It can be seen from the table that 
a net present value for the project at a 15 percent discount rate is approximately $53.0 million, and the 
internal rate of return (IRR) is 120.6 percent 

The parameters for the plant recoveries in the 3,500-tpd mill and cyanidation plant are based on 
preliminary testwork.  Dumps included represent 89,000 tonnes plus 57,000 tonnes of Indicated 
Resources.  Plant operating costs used in the cash flow are calculated costs, and will not be confirmed 
until several months of actual operation have taken place.  Therefore; PAH has predicated cut-off grades 
for the mine and mine dump recoveries on the basis of the current operation; i.e., continuance of milling 
and processing operations (Milling and Flotation) as per current practice.    

Once the new plant is started up metallurgical parameters and operating and ancillary costs are well 
defined, First Majestic can revaluate the cut-off grades for the mine, mine dump recovery and tailing 
recovery based on actual operating data, and issue a new reserve/resources statement.  PAH would then 
proceed with an updated audit, based on the material change in the operation.

Sensitivity analyses were performed at different discount rates and the analysis shows robust economics 
for La Encantada, as follows: 

 Base Case @ 10 % discount   $44,143,983 million 
 Base Case @ 15 % discount   $36,334,243 million 
 Base Case @ 20 % discount   $30,019,406 million 
 Base Case @ 25 % discount   $24,851,240 million 
 Base Case @ 30 % discount   $20,574,641 million 
 TIR:     85% 

 
As expected, the project exhibits the greatest sensitivity to metal prices, followed by operating costs, and 
finally by capital costs.  Any variances in grade or metallurgical recovery will be equivalent to similar 
changes in metal prices, since all three factors impact the revenue stream equally.  In all cases, however, 
the La Encantada mine shows positive economics as measured by a cash flow exercise, except when the 
price of silver falls by 20 percent.  Therefore, the postulated reserve position is accepted. 

It can be seen from Tables 25-17 and 25-18 that there is sufficient after-tax operational cash flow in any 
year to adequately cover projected capital expenditures. 

The mine life, including tailings recovery, based on the proven/probable reserve position, is over 4.0 
years and covers production through 2013.
