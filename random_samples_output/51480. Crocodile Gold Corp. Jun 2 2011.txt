1 EXECUTIVE 	SUMMARY 	

	

1.1 PROJECT	DESCRIPTION			

	
The	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 (collectively,	 the	 "Properties")	 of	 Crocodile	 Gold	 Corp.	
("Crocodile	Gold"),	a	Canadian	 listed	(TSX)corporation,	comprise	a	group	of	mineral	 tenements	totaling	
approximately	 2,742km2	 in	 the	 Northern	 Territory,	 Australia	 which	 include	 an	 inventory	 of	 historical	
gold	discoveries,	historical	and	modern	gold	mines,	and	current	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	Reserves.	
	
The	 Properties	 have	 previously	 been	 individually	 identified	 but	 frequently	 referred	 to	 as	 the	Mount	
Bundy	Gold	Project	 (Mt	 Bundy)	 and	 the	Burnside	Gold	&	Base	Metals	Project,	 which	 includes	 the	
Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Pine	Creek,	Maud	Creek,	Yeuralba	and	Moline	projects.	Within	each	of	these	
project	areas	are	located	numerous	individual	historical	and	current	exploration	targets,	known	mineral	
prospects,	and	operating	localities.	
	
The	Tom's	Gully	Gold	(Mt	Bundy)	Project,	which	includes	the	Tom's	Gully	Gold	Mine	(underground)	and	
Mt	Bundy	(Rustlers	Roost)	Gold	deposits	is	located	about	90km	east	of	Darwin,	NT;	the	Burnside	Gold	&	
Base	Metals	 Projects	 are	 located	 approximately	 125–200km	 southeast	 of	 Darwin,	NT	 and	 includes	 the	
Brocks	 Creek	 Gold	 Mine	 (underground),	 and	 several	 open	 pit	 gold	 mines	 at	 Howley,	 Mottrams,	
Princess	 Louis,	 Fountain	Head	 and	 North	 Point,	 and	 the	 gold	 deposit	 at	 Cosmo	 Deeps,	which	 is	
currently	in	development.	The	Union	Reefs	and	Pine	Creek	projects	are	located	approximately	200km	
to	 the	south	of	Darwin	near	 the	 township	of	Pine	Creek.	The	Gold	processing	plant	 is	 located	at	Union	
Reefs.	The	Moline	Project	is	approximately	40km	to	the	west	of	the	Union	Reefs	plant.	Maud	Creek	is	to	
the	east	of	the	town	of	Katherine	and	around	105km	to	the	southeast	of	Pine	Creek.	The	Yeuralda	project	
is	a	series	of	small	contiguous	mineral	claims	45km	to	the	northeast	of	the	Maud	Creek	property.	
	
Since	the	publication	of	the	last	technical	report	Crocodile	Gold	has	mined	from	the	Howley,	Princess	
Louise,	North	Point	and	Brocks	Creek	deposits	and	processed	ore	through	the	mill	at	Union	Reefs.	During	
the	same	period	Crocodile	Gold	also	mined	material	from	the	Tom's	Gully	underground	mine	and	this	has	
been	stockpiled	at	the	mill	site	as	no	processing	has	taken	place	at	time	of	writing	this	report.	
	

1.2 GEOLOGY	&	MINERALIZATION 				

	

The	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 all	 fall	 within	 the	 Archaean	 to	 Palaeo‐Proterozoic	 Pine	 Creek	
Orogen,	 one	 of	 the	 major	 mineral	 provinces	 of	 Australia.	 	 The	 Pine	 Creek	 Orogen	 is	 a	 deformed	 and	
metamorphosed	sedimentary	basin	up	to	14	km	maximum	thickness	covering	an	area	of	approximately	
66,000	 km2	and	 extending	 from	 Katherine	 in	 the	 south	 to	 Darwin	 in	 the	 north.	 	 It	 hosts	 significant	
resources	of	gold,	uranium	and	platinum	group	metals	("PGMs"),	as	well	as	substantial	base	metals,	silver,	
iron	and	tin‐tantalum	mineralization.			
	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

	 	 Australia

The	Pine	Creek	Orogen	 comprises	 a	 series	of	 late	Archaean	granite‐gneiss	basement	domes,	which	are	
overlain	 by	 a	 fluvial	 to	marine	 sedimentary	 sequence.	 	 Several	 highly	 reactive	 rock	 units	 are	 included	
within	 this	 sedimentary	 sequence,	 including	 carbonaceous	 shale,	 iron	 stones,	 evaporite,	 carbonate	 and	
mafic	 to	 felsic	 volcanic	units	 of	 the	 South	Alligator	 and	Finniss	River	Groups.	 	 This	 sequence	has	 been	
subjected	to	regional	greenschist	facies	metamorphism	and	multiphase	deformation,	which	has	resulted	
in	 the	 development	 of	 a	 northwest	 trending	 fabric.	 	 Subsequent	 widespread	 felsic	 volcanism	 and	 the	
intrusion	of	granitoids	caused	contact	metamorphism,	in	aureoles	between	500m	and	2	km	wide,	which	
overprint	the	earlier	regional	metamorphism.		After	the	granitoid	intrusions,	during	regional	extensional	
deformation,	 an	 extensive	 array	 of	 northeast	 and	 northwest	 trending	 dolerite	 dykes	 intruded	 the	
metasedimentary	sequence.			
	
Gold	mineralization	within	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	is	preferentially	developed	within	strata	of	the	South	
Alligator	Group	and	 lower	parts	of	 the	Finnis	River	Group	along	 anticlines,	 strike‐slip	 shear	 zones	and	
duplex	 thrusts	 located	 in	 proximity	 to	 the	 Cullen	 Granite	 Batholith.	 	 Of	 particular	 stratigraphic	
importance	 are	 the	Wildman	 Siltstone,	 the	Koolpin	 Formation,	 Gerowie	Tuff,	Mount	Bonnie	 Formation	
and	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation.			
	
Many	of	the	known	gold	deposits	within	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen,	and	in	particular	those	within	Crocodile	
Gold's	 Burnside	 Gold	 Projects,	 show	 some	 association	 with	 regional	 northwest‐southeast	 trending	
structures	which,	at	least	in	part,	are	related	to	the	intrusion	of	the	Cullen	Batholith.	
	
Generally	 gold	 mineralization	 is	 associated	 with	 quartz	 veins	 that	 occur	 as	 stockwork	 veins,	 sheeted	
veins,	 discordant	 quartz	 veins	 in	 faults	 and	 shear	 zones	 and	 frequently	 as	 saddle‐reefs.	 There	 is	 a	
common	association	with	antiformal	structures.	
	
Gold	occurs	both	as	free	gold,	frequently	associated	with	pyrite	and	arsenopyrite,	and	as	refractory	gold,	
particularly	at	the	Maud	Creek	Gold	Deposit.	
	
The	Pine	Creek	Orogen	also	hosts	some	world	class	uranium	deposits,	occasionally	gold/PGM	rich,	and	
stratabound	gold	±	silver	rich	base	metal	deposits.	
	
The	 primary	 focus	 of	 Crocodile	 Gold's	 interest	 is	 gold;	 however,	 a	 large	 portion	 of	 the	 properties	 are	
subject	to	various	"farm‐out"	joint	ventures	with	uranium	explorers.		
	

1.3 EXPLORATION			

The	Properties	 have	undergone	 a	 lengthy	 exploration	 and	development	 history	 that	 has	 spanned	 over	
140	 years	 of	 historical	 prospecting	 and	 mining	 and	 several	 waves	 of	 modern	 exploration	 and	
development	in	the	1980s,	1990s	and	during	the	early	part	of	the	2000's.		

A	total	of	over	3.7	million	ounces	of	gold	have	been	produced	from	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	and	it	has	been	
estimated	 that	 in	 excess	 of	 3	 million	 ounces	 have	 been	 produced	 from	 the	 current	 Crocodile	 Gold	
Properties.	

It	is	estimated	that	over	750,000m	of	historical	drilling	have	been	completed.	During	late	2009	and	2010	
Crocodile	Gold	drilled	a	total	of	175,361	meters	of	Diamond,	RC	and	Grade	Control	drilling	into	deposits	
at	Tom's	Gully,	Burnside	and	Pine	Creek.	Exploration	RC	and	diamond	drilling	totals	just	under	105,000	
meters	in	over	1,500	drill	holes	(Table	1‐1	below).

In	recent	years	much	of	the	exploration	work	completed	has	focused	on	development	projects	and	very	
little	regional	or	even	"project‐scale"	exploration	has	been	completed.	 	Nevertheless,	on	every	property	
within	the	portfolio	there	are	"open"	areas	adjoining	or	beneath	known	mineralization,	with	little	or	no	
drilling.	Crocodile	Gold	is	currently	reviewing	all	tenements	to	assess	the	suitability	of	these	targets,	this	
will	 then	 form	 part	 of	 a	 ranking	 of	 all	 advanced	 and	 "green	 fields"	 targets	 to	 assist	with	 planning	 for	
exploration	going	forward.	

Although	 the	 deposits	 are	 all	 related	 to	 particular	 horizons	 within	 the	 stratigraphy	 and	 have	 strong	
structural	 associations,	 there	 does	 not	 appear	 to	 have	 been	 a	 large	 amount	 of	 geological	 mapping	 or	
structural	 investigation.	 The	 style	 of	 mineralization	 present	 normally	 lends	 itself	 to	 geochemical	
exploration;	however,	there	is	only	one	report	of	recent	soil	geochemical	surveying,	and	that	was	for	base	
metal	exploration.

1.4 MINERAL	RESOURCE 	ESTIMATES	

	

Mineral	Resource	estimates	for	all	defined	gold	deposits	within	the	Properties	were	last	reported	in	2009.	
Subsequently,	additional	drilling	at	several	of	the	projects	has	been	completed	and	also	some	mining	of	
portions	of	the	previously	defined	resources	has	taken	place.	Hence,	it	was	deemed	necessary	to	update	
the	current	Mineral	Resource	Statement	(Table	1‐4).	
	
The	Mineral	Resource	estimation	for	the	Tom's	Gully	Gold	Mine	was	updated	by	Hitchin	in	early	2011	to	
reflect	 a	 better	 understanding	 of	 the	 resource	 model	 resulting	 from	 underground	 development	 and	
underground	geological	mapping	as	well	as	muck	and	face	sampling	and	diamond	drilling.		
	
A	re‐optimization	of	the	Mount	Bundy	(Rustlers	Roost)	deposit	was	completed	in	early	2011	and	revised	
resource	statements	were	issued.	
	
The	 seven	 deposits	 that	 make	 up	 the	 Union	 Reefs	 Zone	 were	 subjected	 to	 additional	 resource	
investigations	 in	 late	 2010.	 The	 models	 themselves	 were	 reviewed	 but	 not	 up‐dated	 from	 historical	
estimations.	The	up‐grade	was	mainly	due	to	the	re‐optimization	of	these	deposit	models	allowing	them	
to	be	included	in	the	Crocodile	Gold	inventory.	
	
The	Cosmo	model	has	been	up‐dated	in	this	report.	Several	new	holes	have	been	drilled	into	the	eastern	
lodes	 which	 have	 added	 to	 the	 overall	 understanding	 and	 confidence	 in	 the	 estimation.	 The	 new	
estimation	 is	described	in	more	detail	below.	The	western	 lodes	has	not	been	up‐dated	to	this	point	as	
only	a	limited	number	of	holes	have	been	drilled	through	the	deposit	to	date.	During	2012	these	western	
lodes	will	be	drilled	further	to	update	the	resource.	
	
The	major	 focus	for	exploration	activities	 in	2010	was	around	the	Howley	deposit,	with	several	 tens	of	
thousands	of	meters	of	RC	drilling	being	completed	at	the	deposit	and	a	new	Mineral	Resource	estimated.	
Due	 to	 the	 size	 and	 different	 types	 of	 drilling	 (Howley	 with	 wider	 spaced	 exploration	 drilling	 and	
Mottrams	 with	 closer	 spaced	 grade	 control	 style	 drilling)	 the	 two	 resource	 models	 for	 Howley	 and	
Mottrams	have	been	separated	in	this	report.	
	
While	 Crocodile	Gold	 did	 not	 complete	 any	drilling	 into	 the	 Iron	Blow	deposit	 since	 itsownership	was	
transferred,	a	new	Mineral	Resource	estimation	was	completed.	This	model	is	reported	below.	
	
The	 North	 Point	 deposit	 has	 been	 a	 mining	 focus	 for	 the	 2010	 year	 with	 the	 oxide	 ore	 being	 a	 key	
contributor	to	the	Union	Reefs	plant.	While	some	drilling	is	reported	the	majority	of	the	area	covered	by	
this	drilling	has	been	mined	and	processed,	therefore	no	new	Mineral	Resources	will	be	reported	as	the	
information	available	from	previous	estimations	is	still	current.	
	
The	Princess	Louise	deposit	has	also	had	 limited	mining	during	2010.	This	mining	was	used	to	test	 the	
theories	 of	 the	 mineralization	 styles,	 therefore	 adding	 accuracy	 to	 the	 estimation	 process.	With	 extra	
drilling	completed,	a	new	estimation	is	included	in	this	report.	
	
The	Joint	Venture	relationship	between	Crocodile	Gold	and	Thundelarra	has	been	a	successful	one	since	it	
commenced	 in	 2009.	 In	 early	 2011	 Thundelarra	 released	 a	 new	Mineral	 Resource	 estimation	 for	 the	
Thunderball	deposit.	Crocodile	Gold	has	a	free	carried	30%	interest	in	this	deposit.		Thundelarra	is	in	the

process	of	planning	for	exploration	in	2011	which	will	continue	to	develop	the	Thunderball	deposit	with	
testing	at	depth	a	priority.	
	
Mineral	 Resource	 estimations	 are	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Canadian	 Institute	 of	 Mining,	
Metallurgy	 and	 Petroleum	 (CIM)	 Definition	 Standards	 –	 On	 Mineral	 Resources	 and	 Mineral	 Reserves	
(December,	2005)	as	incorporated	by	reference	in	NI43‐101.	

The	reported	Mineral	Resources	are	inclusive	of	the	Mineral	Reserves.		The	Mineral	Resources	have	been	
depleted	for	previous	mining	as	at	December	31,	2010.	The	Authors	believe	that	the	Mineral	Resources	
have	reasonable	prospects	for	economic	extraction,	in	so	far	as	technical	and	economic	assumptions	are	
concerned.	 The	 use	 of	 "Mineral	 Resource"	 or	 "Mineral	 Reserve"	 makes	 no	 assumption	 of	 legal,	
environmental,	socio‐economic	or	governmental	factors.	
	
Mineral	Resources	were	calculated	using	the	economic	parameters	as	set	below	in	Table	1‐3:	
	

 Bulk	Density	used	from	within	model	
 Gold	Price	$US1,000/ounce,	except	the	Brock	Creek	Deposit	where	a	price	of	$US975	was	used.	
 Exchange	rate	$A0.91:$US1.00	
 Recovery	90%	for	all	material	
 Ore	processing	costs	of	A$17/tonne	
 Wall	angles	40o	for	oxide	and	50o	below	oxide	
 Mining	costs	as	table	below	
 Models	then	optimized	within	generated	Learch	Grossman	Pit	optimized	shell	
 Applications	made	to	open	pit	resources

1.5 MINERAL	RESERVE 	ESTIMATES 	& 	MINING	STUDIES 		

In	 consideration	 of	 revised	 Mineral	 Resource	 estimations,	 updated	 Mineral	 Reserve	 estimations	 have	
been	 prepared	 for	 the	Howley,	 Brocks	 Creek,	 Cosmo,	Mottrams,	 Kohinoor,	 Cox,	 International,	 Gandy's,	
South	Enterprise,	Princess	Louise	and	North	Point	Gold	Deposits.	[Table	1‐4]	
	
All	Mineral	Reserves	 are	 classified	 as	Probable	Mineral	Reserves	 as	 they	 are	 converted	 from	 Indicated	
Mineral	Resources.	The	Mineral	Reserves	are	quoted	based	on	a	gold	price	of	$US1000/oz	gold	and	a	$A	
to	$US	exchange	rate	of	0.	91,	except	Brocks	Creek	which	was	optimized	at	$US975.		

All	mineral	resources	have	been	evaluated	as	part	of	the	overall	package	of	deposits	held	by	Crocodile	due	
to	the	available	synergies	of	using	existing	infrastructure	such	as	the	Union	Reefs	Mill.	
	
The	Mineral	Reserve	estimates	are	 the	 result	 of	 Feasibility	and	Life‐of‐Mine	Studies.	The	Cosmo	Deeps	
estimation	is	based	on	the	results	of	a	Feasibility	Study	carried	out	on	the	deposit.	

Details	of	 these	evaluations,	 including	cut‐off	grade	calculations,	requirements	 for	restarting	previously	
existing	 mines,	 discussion	 of	 planned	 mining	 methods,	 mining	 dilution	 and	 losses,	 metallurgical	
recoveries,	production	schedules,	environmental	considerations	and	financial	analyses,	including	mining	
and	processing	costs,	NPV	evaluations	and	sensitivity	analyses	are	included	in	Sections	17.14,	17.15	and

1.6 CONCLUSIONS	

	
Geologically,	Crocodile	Gold's	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	are	 located	 in	a	 favourable	geological	
setting	for	the	discovery	of	significant	gold	mineralization	and	+1million	ounce	gold	deposits,	this	region	
has	historically	produced	in	excess	of	3	million	ounces	of	gold.	Mineralization	styles	include	potential	for	
both	 high	 grade	 deposits	 which	 could	 support	 underground	 mining	 and	 widespread,	 lower	 grade	
mineralization	 which	 could	 be	 mined	 as	 open	 pit	 mines	 and	 treated	 by	 conventional	 CIL/CIP	 gold	
treatment	plants.	The	short	term	target	is	to	identify	deposits	close	to	the	operating	mill	at	Union	Reefs,	
which	could	offer	either	higher	grade	underground	or	lower	grade	open	pit	style	mining.	
	
Outside	 the	 current	 reserve	 base,	 more	 drilling	 is	 required	 at	 the	 other	 deposits	 before	 they	 can	 be	
included	in	the	Mineral	Reserve	inventory.	This	work	is	required	to	be	done	in	the	coming	years	to	supply	
the	 operations	 with	 alternative	 ore	 sources	 and	 types	 for	 the	 plant.	 It	 has	 been	 identified	 that	 a	 real	
advantage	can	be	obtained	through	blending	different	ore	sources,	particularly	oxide	and	fresh	ore	types.	
Therefore	it	is	critical	that	the	Company	keeps	identifying	oxide	ore	sources	to	use	in	the	plant.		
	
Through	the	current	review	of	all	Crocodile	Gold	deposits	it	has	been	identified	that	several	highly	ranked	
targets	exist	that	require	drilling	and	re‐evaluation,	deposits	such	as	Bon's	Rush,	Western	Arm	and	Bridge	
Creek	 that	 are	 close	 to	 existing	 infrastructure	 and	 could	 also	 supply	 significant	 tonnages	 to	 the	Union	
Reefs	Mill.	
	
There	has	also	been	identified	several	historical	and	previously	reported	Mineral	Resources	that	do	not	
qualify	 under	 the	 current	 NI43‐101	 requirements,	 which	with	minimal	 confirmatory	 drilling	 could	 be	
included	 in	 the	Mineral	 Resource	 inventory.	 These	 resources	 have	 been	 identified	 in	 the	 Government	
Report	on	Gold	Mineralization	in	the	Northern	Territory	and	include	deposits	such	as	(See	Figure	1‐2);	
	
	

 Ios	(Burnside)	
 Santorini	(Burnside)	
 Mt	Bonnie	(Burnside)	
 Sikonos	(Burnside)	
 Rhodes	(Burnside)	
 Quest	29	(Mt	Bundy)

FIGURE	1‐2	CROCODILE	GOLD	DEPOSITS	AND	TARGETS,	BURNSIDE	AREA	

With	respect	to	past	regional	exploration,	very	little	new	work	has	been	conducted	in	the	past	+10	years.	
Outside	 the	 recent	 aeromagnetic	 surveys	 conducted	by	Crocodile	Gold's	 joint	 venture	partner,	 no	new	
regional	 based	 exploration	 work	 has	 been	 identified.	 Crocodile	 Gold	 is	 currently	 working	 with	 a	
geophysical	consultant	to	review	and	report	on	all	open	file	and	publicly	available	geophysical	data,	this	
will	 assist	 with	 target	 generation	 and	 ranking.	 Also	 within	 the	 past	 year	 drilling	 on	 Thundelarra's	
Thunderball	Uranium	deposit	intersected	12m	@	4.96g/t	from	66m.	This	hole	is	drilled	outside	all	other	
known	mineralization,	and	suggests	there	is	high	potential	to	discover	other	significant	deposits	within	
the	tenement	package	that	is	held.	

1.7 RECOMMENDATIONS			

	
Crocodile	Gold	is	required	to	complete	an	audit	of	the	integrity	of	the	geological	database,	followed	by	a	
comprehensive	data	 compilation	program	which	will	 include	preparation	 of	 local,	 project	 and	 regional	
scale	 GIS	 platforms	 and	 preparation	 of	 hardcopy	 plans,	 sections,	 etc.	 With	 this	 process	 the	 future	 of	
Crocodile	Gold	can	be	planned	and	assured.	The	value	of	this	information	cannot	be	undervalued	as	the	
replacement	cost	of	several	decades	of	region	and	project	scale	exploration	would	be	excessive.		
	
All	 required	 and	 relevant	 data	 on	 each	 deposit	 is	 currently	 being	 collected	 and	 collated	 into	 a	 digital	
dataset.	This	includes	past	reports	and	reviews,	drill	hole	and	surface	geochemical	data,	metallurgical	and	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

[12]	
	

geotechnical	 studies,	 geophysical	 data,	 geological	 and	 mineralogical	 wireframes,	 surface	 and	
plans/sections.	This	data	will	 form	a	key	part	 in	 the	ranking	of	 the	deposits	and	will	offer	a	significant	
saving	as	replacement	of	this	data	is	expensive	to	collect	and	report.	
	
This	process	has	 also	begun	 for	 the	development	of	 a	 regional	dataset	 of	 geophysical	 and	geochemical	
data.	 This	 is	 also	 critical	 for	 the	 development	 of	 regional	 targets	 which	 will	 allow	 for	 the	 continued	
development	of	projects	for	Crocodile	Gold.	Without	the	regional	understanding	new,	economically	viable	
deposits	cannot	be	discovered.	
	
Continued	exploration	and	development	programs	will	be	required	 throughout	 the	 life	of	 the	Northern	
Territory	Gold	Properties.	The	dominant	portion	of	this	program	and	expenditure	will	be	for	drilling.	A	
three	pronged	basis	should	be	used	to	develop	targets	as	follows:	
	

 Those	deposits	which	offer	short	 term	production	which	can	be	quickly	brought	on	 line	by	the	
mining	team,	for	example	Rising	Tide	or	Union	Reef	deposits	

 Development	 of	 known	 resources	 which	 require	 limited	 drilling	 and	 can	 offer	 the	 mine	
production	team	another	ore	source	in	the	medium	term	

 Long	term	target	generation	and	ranking	to	bring	new	deposits	on	line	for	the	longer	term	benefit	
of	the	Company	

Comprehensive	 in‐fill	 drilling	 is	 required	 at	 all	medium‐term	production	projects,	 to	 assist	 short‐term,	
detailed	 mine	 planning,	 development	 and	 production	 and	 long‐term	 mine	 planning	 and	 resource	
augmentation.		
	
A	 thorough	 review	of	 the	 geology	 and	Mineral	Resources	of	 the	Cosmo	Deposit	 is	 being	 carried	out.	 A	
better	 understanding	 of	 the	 stratigraphic	 and	 structural	 controls	 within	 the	 mine	 environment	 is	
required	 so	 that	models	 can	be	more	predictive.	 This	will	 also	 assist	with	 target	 generation	 for	 future	
Mineral	Resource	upgrades.	
	
The	Cosmo‐Howley	Gold	Corridor	also	requires	a	thorough	review	and	follow‐up	drill	programs	to	assess	
the	potential	between	Cosmo	and	Howley	and	between	each	deposit	and	on	the	flanks	of	the	zone.	Two	
deeper	 holes	were	 drilled	 under	 the	Howley	 pit	which	 identified	mineralization	 at	 depth.	 These	 holes	
need	to	be	reviewed	to	assist	with	target	generation	in	this	area	as	deeper	holes	may	be	required	in	the	
future	to	identify	the	relationship	between	the	Howley	and	Cosmo	deposits.	
	
There	 is	 considerable	 potential	 for	 additional	 mineralization	 along	 strike	 and	 between	 deposits	 at	
Fountain	Head‐Tally	Ho	–	North	Point‐Princess	Louise	and	additional	exploration	work	is	required.	This	
was	highlighted	by	the	hole	drilled	by	Thundelarra	which	is	along	the	same	structural	corridor	that	North	
Point	and	Princess	Louise	deposits	both	sit	on.	
	
The	+40km	long	zone	from	Cosmo	to	the	north	of	Bon's	Rush	remains	an	excellent	regional	target	area	
and	also	requires	compilation	and	development	of	a	dedicated	exploration	program.	Only	limited	drilling	
has	been	identified	on	this	corridor	outside	the	already	identified	deposits.	The	structural	continuity	can	
be	identified	on	the	regional	geophysics	plans.	
	
The	Pine	Creek	and	Union	Reefs	projects	offer	excellent	opportunities	to	develop	either	lower	grade	open	
pit	mining	or	higher	grade,	 lower	tonnage,	underground	mining.	Several	historical	models	are	available	
and	 these	 are	 being	 reviewed	 and	 re‐worked	 in	 line	with	 current	 practice	 and	 the	 Company's	 current	
understanding	of	the	deposits.	There	is	significant	potential	to	find	additional	ore	at	both	projects	due	to	
the	proximity	to	the	Union	Reefs	mill.

The	 review	 and	 re‐assessment	 of	 Mineral	 Resources	 and	 Mineral	 Reserves	 will	 become	 a	 regular	
requirement	of	corporate	reporting	and	an	Annual	Mineral	Resource	&	Mineral	Reserve	Statement	will	be	
issued	by	Crocodile	Gold.	Consideration	needs	to	be	given	to	the	strategic	importance	of	Mineral	Resource	
to	Mineral	Reserve	conversions.	Currently	it	seems	that	48%	of	Measured	or	Indicated	Mineral	Resources	
for	the	current	Resource	base	are	converted	to	Mineral	Reserves.	Further	work	is	required	to	up‐date	the	
Reserve	base	when	new	resource	models	are	completed.	This	work	will	continue	during	2011.	

The	current	plan	is	to	gather	all	available	data	for	review	and	project/deposit	ranking,	using	identifiable	
indicators	such	as	net	smelter	returns,	proximity	 to	 the	process	plant,	drill	density,	potential,	access	 to	
infrastructure	 and	 the	 like.	 Once	 this	 is	 complete	 planning	 for	 exploration	 and	 resource	 development	
activities	will	be	much	more	efficient	and	cost	effective.	

1.8 EXPLORATION	&	DEVELOPMENT	PROGRAM	&	BUDGET	

The	 recommended	 exploration	 activities	 for	 Crocodile	 in	 the	 next	 12	 months	 are	 to	 complete	 the	
thorough	review	and	report	on	the	available	data	and	finalize	the	project	and	deposit	rankings.	
	
During	the	early	stages	of	this	process	the	deposits	at	Union	Reef	were	identified	as	the	highest	ranking	
due	to:	
	

 The	proximity	to	the	mill	
 The	fact	they	are	on	an	active	mining	lease	
 Only	limited	drilling	exists	below	the	mined	pits	
 The	potential	for	both	higher	grade	underground	and	lower	grade	open	pit	style	deposits	
 The	availability	of	past	miners	and	geologists	from	the	operations	

With	this	in	mind	Crocodile	Gold	is	currently	developing	an	exploration	program	to	assess	both	deposit	
styles	on	this	site.	 It	 is	planned	for	this	exploration	activity	to	begin	in	Quarter	2,	2011	with	the	aim	of	
being	able	to	supply	short	to	medium	term	ore	to	the	mining	team.	

This	exploration	activity	will	also	allow	Crocodile	Gold	the	time	to	finalize	the	project/deposit	ranking.	At	
this	early	stage	it	is	most	likely	the	higher	ranked	deposits	will	be	(in	no	particular	order);	

 All	new	resources	at	Union	Reefs	
 Herculies	(Moline)	
 Bridge	Creek	(Burnside)	
 Rising	Tide	(Burnside)	
 Western	Arm	(Burnside)	
 Quest	29	(Mt	Bundy)	

 Iron	Blow	Polymetalic	(Burnside)	
 Mt	Bonnie	Polymetalic	(Burnside)	
 Rhodes	(Burnside)	
 Yam	Creek	(Burnside)	

	
The	following	table	outlines	a	$30	million	exploration	program	over	3	years.	This	program	is	preliminary	
in	nature	and	additional	funds	will	be	required	to	drill	out	deposits	of	significance.	The	overall	objective	is	
to	significantly	increase	the	reserve	and	resource	base	for	Crocodile	Gold.

2.4 DEFINITIONS 		

	

In	this	report,	reference	to	the	"Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties"	(collectively	the	"Properties")	of	
Crocodile	Gold	refers	to	a	collection	of	"projects"	which	for	historical,	ownership,	tenement,	reporting	or	
purely	 logistical	 or	 geographic	 reasons,	 have	 previously	 been	 individually	 identified	 but	 frequently	
included	in	two	major	project	groups:	the	Burnside	Gold	&	Base	Metals	Project	and	the	Mount	Bundy	Gold	
Project.	The	Burnside	Gold	&	Base	Metals	Project	 includes	the	Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Pine	Creek,	Maud	
Creek,	 Yeuralba	 and	Moline	 projects.	 The	Mount	 Bundy	 Gold	 Project	 includes	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 and	Mt	
Bundy	deposits.	
	
Within	 each	 of	 these	 "project	 areas"	 are	 located	 numerous	 individual	 historical	 and	 current	 mineral	
prospects,	exploration	and	mining	localities.	

The	regional	coordinate	system	utilized	throughout	the	properties	is	the	Universal	Transverse	Mercator	
System	("UTM")	projection.	The	Global	Positioning	System	("GPS")	datum	is	WGS‐84,	Zone	52L.	Resource	
estimates	were	carried	out	on	the	local	grid	corresponding	to	each	individual	resource.	All	units,	unless	
expressed	otherwise,	are	in	the	Metric	System.	All	gold	assay	grades	are	expressed	as	grams	per	metric	
tonne	(g/t)	unless	otherwise	specified,	with	tonnages	stated	in	metric	tonnes.	Gold	metal	are	reported	in	
troy	ounces.	

Unless	otherwise	stated,	monetary	values	are	in	Australian	Dollars	($A).

4.2 MINERAL	RIGHTS,	MINING	LAWS	&	REGULATIONS 		

	

Mineral	Rights	in	the	Northern	Territory	of	Australia	are	governed	by	the	Mining	Act	(2007)	("Act").		
	
Exploration	for	minerals	and	the	extraction	of	minerals	and	extractive	minerals	(sand,	gravel,	rocks	and	
soil)	may	only	occur	by	miners	(holders	of	Miner's	Rights)	who	are	authorized	to	do	so	under	the	Act	by	
the	grant	of	a	mineral	title.		
	
The	Mining	Management	Act	(2008)	provides	for	the	management	of	operational	activities	on	exploration	
and	mining	sites.	
	
Exploration	and	mining	titles	on	Aboriginal	 freehold	land	are	subject	to	the	provisions	of	Part	IV	of	the	
Commonwealth	Aboriginal	Land	Rights	(Northern	Territory)	Act	and	the	NATIVE	TITLE	ACT.	
	
Administration	 of	 these	 acts	 is	 the	 responsibility	 of	 the	 Minerals	 and	 Energy	 Group	 of	 the	 Northern	
Territory	Department	of	Resources	(DoR).	
	

4.2.1 MINERAL	RIGHTS	

	
Mineral	Rights	in	the	Northern	Territory	of	Australia	are	governed	by	the	Mining	Act	(2007)	("Act").	The	
Minister	 for	 Mines	 and	 Energy	 is	 responsible	 for	 the	 Act	 which	 is	 administered	 on	 his	 behalf	 by	 the	
Northern	Territory	Department	of	Resources	(DoR).	
	
The	 Act	 provides	 a	 legislative	 framework	 for	 the	 management	 of	 the	 application,	 granting	 and	
maintenance	of	mineral	exploration	and	mining	titles	in	the	Northern	Territory.		The	primary	function	of	
the	 Act	 is	 the	 administration	 and	 regulation	 of	 exploration	 and	 mining	 titles.	 Originally	 the	 Act	 also	
contained	 provisions	 for	 the	 management	 of	 operational	 activities	 on	 exploration	 and	 mining	 sites;	
however,	these	provisions	were	more	recently	incorporated	into	the	Mining	Management	Act	(2008).	
	
Both	 the	Mining	Act	 and	Mining	Management	Act	are	supported	by	regulatory	 legislation,	the	NT	Mining	
Regulations	(2007)	and	NT	Mining	Management	Regulations	(2002),	respectively,	which	enable	the	DoR	to	
administer	the	industry.	
	
Other	 relevant	 legislation	 applicable	 to	 the	 exploration	 and	mining	 industry	operating	 in	 the	Northern	
Territory	includes:	

•		 Bushfires	Act	
•		 Environmental	Assessment	Act	
•		 Heritage	Conservation	Act	
 Aboriginal	Land	Rights	Act	
•		 Native	Title	Act	
•		 Northern	Territory	Aboriginal	Sacred	Sites	Act	
•		 Public	Health	Act	
•		 Territory	Parks	and	Wildlife	Conservation	Act	
•		 Waste	Management	and	Pollution	Control	Act	
•		 Water	Act	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	

[34]	
	

•		 Weeds	Management	Act	

	
A	major	policy	objective	of	the	Northern	Territory	Government	is	to	ensure	that	the	maximum	amount	of	
land	is	being	actively	explored	and	mined	at	any	one	time.	The	Act	includes	a	number	of	provisions	that	
attempt	 to	encourage	 the	active	exploration	and	mining	of	 commodities	as	well	 as	providing	equitable	
opportunities	to	access	land	for	large,	medium	and	small	enterprises.	
	
The	primary	vehicle	for	mineral	exploration	in	the	Act	is	the	exploration	license,	a	title	that	provides	for	
systematic	 exploration	 and	 regular	 reductions	 of	 the	 title	 area	 so	 as	 to	 provide	 for	 a	 turnover	 of	 land	
available	for	exploration	purposes.	
	
The	 Act	 also	 contains	 a	 number	 of	 title	 types	 for	 conducting	 mining	 activities.	 Titles	 such	 as	mineral	
claims	and	mineral	leases	are	two	such	titles.	Where	the	mining	of	material	 is	required	for	construction	
materials,	 such	as	 road	works	or	material	 for	concrete	manufacture,	 the	Act	provides	 for	 titles	 such	as	
extractive	mineral	permits	and	extractive	mineral	leases	to	be	issued.	
	
Apart	from	the	Act,	the	form	and	operations	of	the	mining	industry	are	shaped	by	a	variety	of	legislation	
and	 policies	 such	 as	 the	 Territory's	 Parks	 and	Wildlife	 legislation	 and	 Sacred	 Site	 legislation	 and	 the	
Commonwealth	Aboriginal	Land	Rights	(Northern	Territory)	Act	(ALRA)	and	the	Native	Title	Act.		A	 role	 of	
the	Act	is	to	ensure	that	it	is	compatible	with	these	and	other	relevant	legislation.	
	
Central	to	the	establishment	and	operation	of	a	resource	industry	in	the	Northern	Territory	is	the	ability	
to	 access	 land	 in	 a	 transparent,	 equitable,	 timely	 and	 cost	 effective	 manner.	 The	 NT	 Government's	
Multiple	 Land	 Use	 Policy	 means	 that	 all	 land	 is	 potentially	 available	 for	 exploration	 and	 mineral	
production.		
	
The	 ability	 to	deal	 in	 exploration	 and	mining	 titles	 is	 integral	 to	 a	 successful	mining	 industry.	The	Act	
provides	 for	 these	 transactions	and	 for	 a	 register	of	 legal	 transactions	 to	be	maintained	as	 a	matter	of	
public	record.	
	
Additionally,	the	Act	also	provides	mechanisms	for	the	consideration	of	comments	and	objections	to	the	
grant	of	titles	and	the	resolution	of	disputes	through	the	Mining	Warden's	Court.	
	
The	 legislation	 is	 also	 able	 to	 exclude	 land	 from	 the	 general	 provisions	 of	 the	 Act	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	
either	 temporarily	 or	 permanently	 prohibiting	 exploration	 and/or	 mining	 on	 a	 particular	 area	 or	 to	
provide	for	controlled	development	of	that	area.	
	

4.2.2 	TITLES	

	
Exploration	 and	 mining	 titles	 in	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 are	 administered	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	
provisions	 of	 the	Mining	Act	(2007)	("Act")	and	the	Mining	Regulations	(2007).	Applications	 for	mineral	
titles	are	made	in	accordance	with	the	Act	and	where	the	underlying	land	is	Aboriginal	Freehold	land	or	
land	that	is	subject	to	native	title,	the	applicant	must	also	follow	an	additional	process.	
	
The	Act	has	a	variety	of	 title	 types	 to	provide	 for	a	range	of	activities	 from	low	level	and	non‐intrusive	
exploration	to	major	mining	projects.		



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

	 	 Australia	

[35]	
	

	
The	principal	forms	of	mining	tenure	that	are	issued	under	the	Act	are	summarized	below	and	elaborated	
upon	in	the	section	following	(Table	4‐2):	
	

 Miner's	Right:	Authorizes	a	holder	to	prospect	for	minerals	using	nonintrusive	methods,	access	
land	for	assessment	purposes	and	to	apply	for	exploration	and	mining	tenements.	

 Exploration	 License	 (EL):	 Provides	 exclusive	 rights	 for	 the	 holder	 to	 undertake	 exploration	
activities	within	the	license	area	and	to	apply	for	a	mining	title.	

 Exploration	Retention	License	(ERL):	Grants	the	holder	the	right	to	retain	an	area	of	land	under	
title	where	 there	 is	 evidence	of	 an	economic	ore	body	which	 requires	 further	 assessment.	This	
assessment	 may	 involve	 the	 conduct	 of	 further	 exploration,	 feasibility	 studies	 or	 waiting	 for	
market	and	economic	conditions	to	change	before	production	commences.	

 Substitution	Exploration	License	(SEL):	The	holder	of	2	or	more	exploration	licenses	may	apply	
for	the	grant	of	an	exploration	license	in	substitution	for	those	exploration	licenses.		

 Mineral	Lease	(ML):	Provides	legal	title	for	the	mining	of	minerals.	Generally	used	for	substantial	
mining	 operations	 and	may	 be	used	 for	 constructing	 related	mining	 infrastructure.	 (Previously	
known	as	MLN)	

 Mineral	Claim	(MC):	Provides	legal	title	for	the	mining	of	minerals,	principally	for	small	miners.	
(Previously	known	as	MCN)	

 Extractive	Mineral	Lease:	Provides	 title	 for	 the	 larger	 scale	mining	 of	 extractive	minerals	 by	
quarrying	or	other	means.	

 Extractive	Mineral	Permit:	Provides	title	for	shorter	term	or	smaller	extractive	operations.	
	
Exploration	licenses	and	mining	leases	are	the	predominant	titles	in	the	Northern	Territory.		
	

4.2.3 EXPLORATION	LICENCES		

	
An	 exploration	license	 can	 be	 granted	 to	 explore	 up	 to	 500	 graticular	 blocks	 of	 land,	 or	 approximately	
1600	square	kilometers.	 	Exploration	licenses	may	be	granted	for	periods	of	up	to	six	years	and	may	be	
renewed	for	two	periods,	each	for	a	maximum	term	of	two	years.	Applications	for	renewal	must	be	made	
three	months	prior	to	the	expiry	of	the	exploration	license.		

Exploration	licenses	are	subject	to	regular	size	reductions.	Those	reductions	occur	at	the	end	of	the	first	
two	years.	The	 license	area	must	be	reduced	by	half	 its	original	size	and	again	each	year	thereafter.	As	
part	 of	 the	 annual	 review	 process,	 explorers	 are	 required	 to	 report	 annually	 on	 their	 exploration	
programs.		

Prior	to	commencing	any	operations,	explorers	are	required	to	obtain	an	authorization	under	the	Mining	
Management	Act.		
	

4.2.4 MINERAL	LEASES		

	
A	mineral	lease	can	be	up	to	4000	hectares	in	area	and	may	be	granted	for	the	period	of	 the	mine	with	
renewal	options.	The	Lessee	is	authorized	to	explore	and	mine	for	minerals	on	the	lease	area	subject	to	
other	legislation	such	as	the	Mining	Management	Act.	A	mineral	lease	may	be	issued	for	other	purposes	as	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	

[36]	
	

specified	 in	 a	 lease	 document	 such	 as	 constructing	 related	 infrastructure.	 A	mineral	lease	may	 also	 be	
issued	for	ancillary	purposes	in	conjunction	with	mining	of	minerals.		
	
The	Mining	Regulations	(2007)	provide	administrative	procedures	for	management	of	the	Act.	

4.3 ADMINISTRATION	

	
Exploration	and	mining	titles	in	the	Northern	Territory	are	administered	by	the	Titles	Division	within	the	
Minerals	 and	 Energy	 Group	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 Department	 of	 Resources	 (DoR).	 In	 addition	 to	
administering	 the	 Mining	 Act	 (2007)	 and	 Regulations	 (2007),	 the	 Division	 manages	 the	 procedures	
associated	with	the	Commonwealth	ABORIGINAL	LAND	RIGHTS	(NT)	ACT	and	the	NATIVE	TITLE	ACT.	
	
The	 Authorizations	 and	 Evaluations	 and	 Compliance	 Divisions	 of	 the	Minerals	 and	 Energy	 Group	 also	
administer	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Mining	 Management	 Act	 (2008)	 and	 Regulations	 (2002)	 for	
operational	activities	within	the	Northern	Territory.	These	activities	include	exploration	activities	such	as	
drilling	 and	bulk	 sampling	which	 are	defined	 as	 causing	 substantial	 disturbance.	 These	divisions	 grant	
authorizations	for	operational	activities,	manage	rehabilitation	securities,	regulatory	reporting	and	audit	
environmental	 performance.	They	 also	 conduct	 mine	 audits	 and	 inspections	 to	 ensure	 compliance	
with	Mining	 Management	 Plans	 and	 relevant	standards.		 Compliance	 issues	 relating	 to	 occupational	
health	and	safety	are	administered	by	NT	Worksafe.	

4.4 NEW	LEGISLATION	

	
In	response	to	the	release	of	the	Northern	Territory	Mining	Act	Recommendations	for	Change	in	March	
2008	the	Mineral	Titles	Act	was	drafted	and	assented	to	in	the	Northern	Territory	on	9	September	2010.		
The	Act	is	yet	to	commence,	however	it	is	widely	anticipated	that	this	will	occur	on	1	July	2011.		This	Act	
repeals	the	existing	Mining	Act.	
	
The	 stated	 purpose	 of	 the	Mineral	 Titles	 Act	 is	 to	 provide	 "streamlined	mining	 tenure	 processes	 and	
greater	accountability".		This	new	legislation	will	implement	significant	changes	such	as	the	phasing	out	
of	 several	 tenement	 types	 i.e.	 Mineral	 Claims	 and	 Substitute	 Exploration	 Licenses.	 	 DoR	 advise	 that	 a	
transition	 period	 will	 allow	 holders	 of	 these	 types	 of	 tenements	 to	 have	 them	 transferred	 into	 the	
appropriate	tenure	types	under	the	New	Mineral	Titles	Act.			
	
Where	possible,	Crocodile	Gold	is	currently	negotiating	with	DoR	to	proactively	and	progressively	change	
their	Mineral	Claims	and	Substitution	Exploration	Licenses	into	more	appropriate	tenure	to	align	with	the	
new	legislation	as	they	come	up	for	renewal.	

Recognizing	that	mining	 is	 important	to	the	Northern	Territory	because	it	 is	the	single	most	significant	
contributor	 to	 the	 Gross	 State	 Product	 (GSP),	 accounting	 for	 $A2.5	 billion	 in	 revenue	 each	 year	 and	
directly	 employing	over	 4,600	people,	 the	NT	Government	 supports	 the	 activities	 of	 the	NT	Geological	
Survey	 (NTGS)	 and	 has	 committed	 to	 a	 4	 year,	 $A14.4	 million	 program	 called	 Bringing	 Forward	
Discovery,	 an	 initiative	 that	 promotes	 the	 prospectivity	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 to	 explorers	 and	
investors.

4.6 AGREEMENTS	

	

4.6.1 JOINT	VENTURES	&	OPTION	AGREEMENTS	

	
The	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	are	subject	to	a	number	of	"farm‐in"	and	"farm‐out"	Joint	Venture	
and	Option	Agreements.	The	key	agreements	are	summarized	below;

	 	 Australia	

[40]	
	

	
4.6.2 	FARM‐IN	AGREEMENTS	

	
"Farm‐in"	 agreements	 provide	 for	 Crocodile	 Gold	 to	 explore	 on	mineral	 titles	 which	 are	 substantially	
controlled	or	owned	100%	by	third	parties	(Figure	4‐10).	
	
 Maud	Creek	Gold	Project	
	
Terra	Gold	Mining	Pty	Ltd	("TGM")	acquired	the	Maud	Creek	Project	tenements	in	2004	from	a	subsidiary	
of	Harmony	Gold	Mining	Company	Ltd	("Harmony").		The	outstanding	payments	for	this	purchase	include	
$A2.0	million	 cash	 due	within	 seven	 days	 of	 a	 decision	 to	mine	 at	 the	Maud	 Creek	 Project,	 and	 a	 1%	
royalty	on	 the	value	of	gold	produced	at	 the	Maud	Creek	Project	 in	excess	of	 the	 first	250,000	ounces.		
TGM	may	not	assign	or	transfer	any	of	its	rights,	interest	or	obligations	under	the	agreement	without	the	
prior	consent	of	Harmony	and	Harmony	has	lodged	a	caveat	against	the	Maud	Creek	Project	tenements	to	
secure	its	rights.			
	
In	addition,	 following	the	sale	of	 the	 freehold	title	over	 the	Maud	Creek	deposit	 in	mid‐2008,	Crocodile	
Gold	 has	 the	 perpetual	 and	 assignable	 right	 to	 apply	 for	 a	 mining	 tenement	 and	 perform	 any	mining	
related	activities	without	objection	or	claim	from	the	owner	or	occupier	of	the	freehold	titles,	being	NT	
Portion	4192	and	6336	(together	the	"Maud	Creek	Farm"),	irrevocable	and	unlimited	authority	to	use	a	
right	 of	 way	 (including	 road	 construction	 and	 power	 line	 erection)	 to	 access	 the	 Maud	 Creek	mining	
property,	mine	dewater	on	the	Maud	Creek	Farm	and	a	right	of	first	refusal	on	any	proposed	sale	of	the	
whole	or	any	portion	of	the	Maud	Creek	Farm.		
	
 Moline	Project	
	
The	 transfer	 of	 all	Moline	 Tenements	 has	 been	 completed	 outside	MLN1059	which	 is	 currently	 under	
review	by	Department	of	Revenue	due	to	an	outstanding	Royalty	payment,	at	time	of	writing	all	parties	
had	been	in	contact	with	the	department	and	the	matter	continues.	All	exploration	tenements	have	been	
transferred	 outside	 EL24173	 which	 was	 submitted	 on	 the	 same	 transfer	 document	 as	 MLN1059.	
Complete	Tenement	Management	is	acting	on	behalf	of	Crocodile	Gold	to	ensure	this	matter	is	resolved	
quickly,	 once	 approval	 is	 given	 by	 the	 Department	 of	 Revenue	 the	 tenement	 will	 be	 transferred	 to	
Crocodile	Gold.	Currently	Crocodile	Gold	is	handling	the	tenure	of	this	tenement	as	if	it	were	a	part	of	the	
Moline	 Group,	 therefore	 a	 MMP	 and	 Government	 Bonds	 have	 been	 determined	 and	 completed	 by	
Crocodile	Gold	for	MLN1059	even	though	the	transfer	has	not	been	completed,	and	this	will	ensure	the	
tenement	is	still	in	good	standing	when	the	transfer	is	complete.	
	
 Other	Agreements	
	
A	number	of	other	tenement	agreements	exist	 in	relation	to	particular	tenements	or	regions	thereof,	as	
set	out	below:		
 

Crocodile	Gold	owns	20%	of	certain	mineral	claims	(some	granted	and	others	applications)	in	the	
Yam	Creek	area	in	joint	venture	with	Robert	Biddlecombe.		Various	historical	agreements	govern	
the	relationship	between	the	parties,	including	royalty,	alluvial	mining	and	other	"area	of	interest"	
obligations.	It	is	believed	but	not	yet	confirmed	that	Mr.	Biddlecombe	may	have	sold	his	interest	
in	these	mineral	claims	Crocodile	Gold	intends	to	continue	the	arrangement	with	the	new	owners	
once	it	is	confirmed;		

 



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

4.7 SURFACE 	RIGHTS 	–	LAND 	ACCESS 		

	

4.7.1 	PASTORAL	LEASES	

	
The	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 are	 all	 located	 on	 pastoral	 leases.	 Holders	 of	 mining	 and	
exploration	 tenements	have	rights	of	access	 to	 their	 tenements,	 including	access	 through	neighbouring	
pastoral	 leases,	 and	 are	 not	 obligated	 to	 remunerate	 pastoral	 leaseholders	 for	 recovered	 minerals	
because	 by	 law	 they	 do	 not	 have	 any	 title	 to	 the	minerals	 on	 the	 tenements.	 However,	 as	 a	matter	 of	
commercial	 practice,	 mining	 companies	 and	 pastoral	 leaseholders	 often	 reach	 access	 agreements	
governing	their	activities	and	relationships.		
	
Tenements	 comprising	 the	 Mount	 Bundy	 Gold	 Project	 are	 located	 on	 pre‐existing	 Pastoral	 Leases	 as	
follows:	
 

 Old	Mt	Bundy	Station,	Perpetual	Pastoral	Lease	No.	1163,	(NT	Portion	4937)	
 McKinley	Station,	Perpetual	Pastoral	Lease	No.	1164,	(NT	Portion	4938)	

	
Tenements	comprising	the	Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Moline	and	Maud	Creek	Gold	Projects	are	 located	on	
various	pastoral	leases,	as	follows:		
 

 Ban	Ban	Springs	Station,	Perpetual	Pastoral	Lease	No.	1111	
 Mount	Ringwood	Station,	Pastoral	Lease	No.	718	
 Douglas	River	Station,	Pastoral	Lease	No.	903	
 Mary	River	West	Station,	Pastoral	Lease	No.	815	
 Jindare	Station,	Pastoral	Lease	No.	1058	
 Bonrook	Station,	Pastoral	Lease	No.	643		
 Pastoral	Lease	No.	1182	
 Crown	Lease	(Perpetual)	Nos.	1546	and	900.		

	
Relations	with	 each	pastoral	 lease	 owner	 and/or	 operator	 are	 reported	 to	 have	 been	harmonious	 and	
regular	 communications	 are	 reportedly	maintained	with	 the	 lease	 operators	 for	 the	 active	mining	 and	
exploration	areas.	No	formal	agreements	exist	with	the	pastoral	 leaseholders,	although	historically	past	
operators	prepared	draft	agreements	for	submission	to	the	pastoralists	at	various	points	in	time.

4.8 	OPERATING	AUTHORIZATIONS	

	
The	 mining	 regime	 in	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 is	 governed	 by	 the	Mining	Act	 (2007)	 and	 the	 Mining	
Management	Act	(2008).	In	accordance	with	this	legislation,	the	owner	of	an	exploration	license	or	mining	
lease	is	required	to	submit	an	annual	Mine	Management	Plan	(MMP)	to	the	NT	Department	of	Resources	
(DoR).	This	plan,	covering	key	aspects	of	mine	operation,	health	and	safety,	environmental	management	
and	 mine	 closure	 is	 assessed	 and	 audited	 by	 DoR.	 	 Upon	 approval	 of	 the	 MMP,	 an	 Authorization	 to	
Operate	for	a	12	month	period	is	issued	to	the	mining	operation.			Depending	on	the	status	of	operating	or	
exploration	activities	involved,	the	MMP	can	be	a	relatively	simple	or	detailed	document	akin	to	a	Notice	
of	Intent	(NOI).	
 
Crocodile	 Gold	 develops	 MMP's	 for	 all	 Mineral	 Leases	 as	 required	 under	 the	 Mining	 Act	 (2007),	 this	
process	is	ongoing	and	is	required	before	mining	can	commence.	In	places	where	the	MMP	has	expired,	
the	department	can	allow	mining	to	continue	while	the	new	MMP	is	approved.	Crocodile	Gold	is	currently	
developing	MMP's	 for	 the	Pine	Creek	and	Union	Reefs	mining	projects,	 at	 time	of	writing	of	 the	report	
these	were	well	progressed	but	not	final	or	approved.	

4.9 	MISCELLANEOUS	LICENCES 	&	ACCESS	

	
Access	to	the	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	is	generally	through	Crocodile	Gold‐managed	tenements	
and/or	access	roads.				
	
Several	 of	 the	 Properties	 are	 subject	 to	 infrastructure	 easements,	 including	 the	 Darwin	 and	 other	 gas	
supply	 pipelines,	 the	 Adelaide‐Darwin	 transcontinental	 railway	 line,	 telecommunication	 towers	 and	
overhead	electricity	power	supply	lines	and	equipment.			

4.10 	NATIVE	TITLE		

	
The	 majority,	 i.e. over	 96%, of	 the	 current	 Mineral	 Resource	 and	 Reserve	 base	 within	 the	 Northern	
Territory	Gold	Properties		lies	within	granted	mining	leases	for	which	Native	Title	has	been	extinguished.		
Hence,	 Native	 Title	 issues	 will	 not	 affect	 the	 development	 and	 operation	 of	 mining	 operations	 within	
these	project	tenements.	
	
No	sites	of	Aboriginal	or	other	historical	significance	have	been	located	or	documented	for	the	project	area.			
There	are	no	Native	Title	agreements	currently	in	place.			
 
Within	the	Burnside	Gold	Project,	 there	are	only	 two	areas,	 the	Kazi	and	Western	Arm	deposits,	where	
mineral	resources	have	been	identified	that	are	not	presently	located	within	granted	mining	tenure.		

The	Kazi	deposit	lie	within	granted	Substitute	Exploration	License	SEL25748	and	is	subject	to	MLA1152,	
dated	4/11/94,	whilst	 the	Western	Arm	deposit	 lies	within	MLA1135	 (formerly	Exploration	Retention	
License	 ERL97),	 dated	 6/8/93.	 Crocodile	 Gold	 has	 recently	 been	 in	 discussions	 with	 the	 relevant	
Aboriginal	Land	Council	for	the	Pine	Creek	region	and	the	Northern	Land	Council	regarding	Native	Title	
Agreements	for	these	deposits.

The	 Esmeralda	 deposit	 to	 the	 south	 of	 the	 Union	 Reefs	 mine	 site	 is	 also	 located	 on	 a	 mineral	 lease	
application	(MLA27999).	There	is	also	a	mineral	lease	application	to	the	east	of	Mt	Bundy	mine	site	on	the	
Mt	Bundy	Project	(MLNA1155).	None	of	the	reported	Mineral	Resources	are	located	on	this	application	
	
All	 tenements	underlying	 the	Tom's	Gully	Gold	Project	have	been	granted	apart	 from	one	mining	 lease	
application,	MLA	24828,	located	to	the	south	of	the	main	Tom's	Gully	mining	lease	area.			

4.10.1 	NATIVE	TITLE	PROCESS	–	SUMMARY	

	
Native	Title	 is	a	complicated	 issue	and	 the	Author	 is	not	an	expert	 in	 this	area;	 the	 information	below,	
which	 is	 extracted	 from	 Northern	 Territory	 Government	 websites	 and	 is	 provided	 for	 information	
purposes,	may	not	be	complete,	accurate	or	current,	and	is	presented	subject	to	the	disclaimer	provided	
in	Section	3.0,	above.		

4.10.2 EXPLORATION	AND	MINING	ON	NATIVE	TITLE	AFFECTED	LAND		

	
Application	for	exploration	and	mining	title	may,	depending	on	the	underlying	land	tenure,	be	required	to	
comply	with	the	Commonwealth	Native	Title	Act	prior	to	the	grant	of	a	title.		

Typically,	compliance	with	the	Native	Title	Act	is	required	where	an	application	is	over	Pastoral	Lease	or	
Crown	Lease	land.		

The	Native	Title	Act	provides	an	option	of	seeking	an	expedited	right	to	negotiate	procedure	for	the	grant	
of	 exploration	 licenses	 compared	 to	 the	 right	 to	 negotiate	 procedure	 that	 applies	 to	 mining	 tenure.	
Applicants	 may	 also	 enter	 into	 Indigenous	 Land	 Use	 Agreements	 (ILUA)	 with	 Native	 Title	 parties	 to	
facilitate	tenure	grant.		

4.10.3 	EXPEDITED	PROCEDURE		

	
In	 the	Northern	Territory,	applications	 for	 the	grant	of	an	exploration	 license	are	generally	required	to	
comply	with	 the	expedited	 right	 to	negotiate	procedure,	which	provides	a	 faster	 route	 for	 the	grant	of	
exploration	title	that	have	lower	impact.		

The	Native	Title	Act	defines	an	act	attracting	the	expedited	procedure,	as	one	that	is	not	likely	to	interfere	
with	 Indigenous	 community	 or	 their	 social	 activities,	 significant	 sites,	 or	 involve	major	 disturbance	 to	
land	or	waters.		

The	 expedited	 procedure	 is	 activated	 when	 the	 notification	 process	 includes	 a	 statement	 that	 the	
government	 "considers	 the	 act	 of	 granting	 the	 exploration	 license	 is	 an	 act	 attracting	 the	 expedited	
procedure".		

Registered	 Native	 Title	 claimants	may	 object	 to	 the	 inclusion	 of	 this	 statement	within	 the	 four	month	
notification	period.	If	the	objection	is	not	withdrawn	after	a	period	of	negotiation	the	matter	is	required	
to	 proceed	 to	 arbitration.	 In	 the	 Northern	 Territory,	 the	 National	 Native	 Title	 Tribunal	 (NNTT)	 is	 the	
arbitral	body,	which	handles	the	expedited	procedure	objection	inquiry.		

Agreements,	 which	 allow	 the	 objection	 to	 be	 withdrawn,	 may	 be	 reached	 at	 any	 stage	 during	 the	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	

[45]	
	

expedited	procedure.	The	Northern	Territory	Government	encourages	such	agreements.		

The	 Northern	 Territory	 Government	 has	 successfully	 used	 the	 expedited	 procedure	 for	 the	 grant	 of	
exploration	 licenses.	 This	 success	 is	 largely	 the	 result	 of	 additional	 conditions	 placed	 on	 exploration	
holders	 to	 further	 protect	 the	 rights	 and	 interests	 of	 Native	 Title	 holders	 and	 the	 requirement	 for	
exploration	license	holders	to	comply	with	Northern	Territory's	Aboriginal	Sacred	Sites	Act.		

4.10.4 	RIGHT	TO	NEGOTIATE	PROCEDURE		

	
Applications	 for	 all	 forms	of	mining	 tenure,	 on	which	development	may	occur,	 are	 required	 to	 comply	
with	the	right	to	negotiate	procedure.		

This	procedure	 is	commenced	by	a	public	notification	process	 in	which	details	of	 the	mining	 tenement	
applications	are	placed	in	a	Northern	Territory	and	an	Indigenous	newspaper.		

If	 a	 Native	 Title	 claim	 is	 lodged	 and	 registered	 within	 four	 months	 of	 the	 notification	 date,	 it	 is	 a	
requirement	 of	 s31(1)(b)	 of	 the	 Native	 Title	 Act	 that	 an	 agreement	 be	 reached,	 formalized	 by	 the	
execution	of	a	Tripartite	Deed	prior	to	the	grant	of	title.		

This	Deed	between	 the	Northern	Territory	Government,	 the	Native	Title	parties	 and	 the	 applicant	will	
generally	be	supported	by	an	Ancillary	Agreement	between	the	title	applicant	and	the	Native	Title	parties.		

A	feature	of	the	Native	Title	Act	is	the	requirement	for	negotiation	to	be	carried	out	in	good	faith.		

The	Northern	Territory	Government,	 through	 the	DoR	Titles	Division,	plays	an	active	part	 in	managing	
the	right	to	negotiate	procedure.		

If	 the	 negotiating	 parties	 are	 unable	 to	 reach	 agreement	 the	matter	may	 be	 referred	 to	 the	 NNTT	 for	
either	mediation	or	arbitration.		

4.10.5 	INDIGENOUS	LAND	USE	AGREEMENTS	("ILUA")	

	
Applications	for	exploration	and	mining	tenure	may	also	be	granted	where	the	applicant/s	and	the	Native	
Title	Representative	Body	enters	into	an	ILUA.		

There	are	a	number	of	ILUAs	registered	under	the	Native	Title	Act	for	exploration	and	mining	within	the	
Northern	 Territory.	 These	 are	 flexible	 agreements	 that	 can	 provide	 for	 various	 activities	 including	
exploration	and	mining	activities,	suitable	for	small	exploration	or	large	mining	projects.		

4.10.6 EXPLORATION	AND	MINING	ON	ABORIGINAL	FREEHOLD	LAND		

	
Some	44%	of	the	Northern	Territory	is	Aboriginal	freehold	land	and	subject	to	the	Commonwealth	Aboriginal	
Land	Rights	(Northern	Territory)	Act	1976	(ALRA).	Under	that	Act,	Land	Councils	administer	this	land	on	behalf	
of	the	traditional	owners.	There	are	four	Land	Councils	in	the	Northern	Territory,	the	Northern	Land	Council,	
the	Central	Land	Council,	the	Tiwi	Land	Council	and	the	Anindilyakwa	Land	Council.

4.10.7 	THE	MINING	ACT	PROCESS	

		
Applications	 for	 exploration	 and	 subsequent	mining	 titles	 on	 Aboriginal	 freehold	 land	 are	 required	 to	
comply	with	the	Northern	Territory	Mining	Act.	 It	 is	a	requirement	of	the	ALRA	that	a	miner	seeking	to	
explore	on	Aboriginal	freehold	land	initially	applies	for	an	exploration	license.		

Applications	 for	 exploration	 licenses	must	be	made	 through	 the	Department	 of	Regional	Development,	
Primary	 Industry,	 Fisheries	 and	 Resources	 (DoR)	 Titles	 Division	 office.	 Following	 receipt	 of	 an	
exploration	 license	 application	 the	 department	 will	 assess	 the	 application	 to	 ensure	 legislative	
compliance	 and	 the	 adequacy	 of	 the	 exploration	 proposals.	 The	 application	 is	 also	 subject	 to	 a	 public	
notification	process.	On	completion	of	this	initial	review	process,	the	Northern	Territory	Minister	for	DoR	
may	issue	consent	to	negotiate.	This	consent	activates	the	mining	processes	under	Part	IV	of	the	ALRA.		
	

4.10.8 	THE	ALRA	PROCESS		

	
Once	consent	is	issued,	the	applicant	is	required,	to	develop	and	lodge	an	exploration	proposal	with	the	
relevant	Land	Council	within	three	months.	These	proposals	must	contain	details	of	proposed	exploration	
activities	and	details	of	the	method	of	extraction	and	treatment	of	any	commodity	that	may	be	discovered,	
as	required	by	s41(6)	of	the	ALRA.		

Guidelines	on	developing	proposals	are	available	 from	the	relevant	Land	Council.	The	NT	DoR	has	also	
published	a	booklet	titled	Exploring	Country	to	assist	with	exploration	and	mining	agreements.	This	can	
be	accessed	on	line.		

Once	the	proposal	is	accepted	by	the	Land	Council,	the	parties,	the	applicant	and	the	Land	Council,	have	
an	 initial	 22	month	 negotiation	 period	 in	which	 to	 reach	 an	 agreement.	 During	 the	 process,	 the	 Land	
Council	is	required	to	consult	with	the	traditional	owners.		

The	consultation	process	may	include	the	convening	of	one	or	more	meetings	with	traditional	owners.		

Applicants	 are	 entitled	 to	 attend	 certain	 meetings	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 explaining	 and	 discussing	 the	
proposed	exploration	activities.		

The	 Department	 of	 Business,	 Economic	 and	 Regional	 Development's	 Indigenous	 Business	 Industry	
Services	Branch	 is	 available	 for	 guidance	on	how	 to	best	present	 this	material	 in	 a	 culturally	 sensitive	
manner.		

4.10.9 	REACHING	AGREEMENT		

	
When	an	agreement	is	reached,	it	is	a	requirement	of	the	ALRA	that	consent	is	given	by	the	Land	Council	
and	 the	Federal	Minister	 for	Families,	Community	Services	and	 Indigenous	Affairs.	The	Agreement	and	
the	consents	are	required	to	be	submitted	to	DoR,	following	which	the	exploration	license	can	be	granted.		

Following	grant,	the	department	administers	the	exploration	license	in	accordance	with	the	Mining	Act.

4.10.10 	NEGOTIATING	TIMEFRAMES	

Under	the	ALRA,	negotiation	towards	agreement	is	to	be	carried	out	within	prescribed	timeframes.		
	
If	an	agreement	is	not	reached	within	the	standard	negotiating	period,	there	is	provision	for	extension	to	
the	negotiation	period	by	agreement	between	the	Land	Council	and	the	applicant.	The	first	extension	is	
for	a	two	year	period,	followed	by	periods	of	one	year.	The	standard	negotiation	period	commences	upon	
lodgment	of	 the	proposals	with	the	Land	Council	and	ending	22	months	from	the	1st	 January	following	
the	date	of	lodgment.		

4.11 	ROYALTIES	

All	 tenements	within	the	Northern	Territory,	Australia	are	subject	 to	a	Northern	Territory	Government	
Minerals	Royalty	in	accordance	with	the	Northern	Territory	Mineral	Royalty	Act	1982	(as	amended).		This	
royalty	is	calculated	as	20%	of	the	"Net	Value"	of	mine	production	(royalty	increased	from	18%	on	the	1st	
of	 July	 2010),	 where	 "Net	 Value"	 equals	 the	 gross	 revenue	 from	 the	 relevant	 production	 unit	 less	 the	
operating	 costs	 of	 the	 production	 unit	 for	 the	 year,	 a	 capital	 allowance	 on	 eligible	 capital	 assets	
expenditure,	 eligible	 exploration	 expenditure	 and	 additional	 deductions	 as	 approved	 by	 the	 Northern	
Territory	Minister	for	Mines.	
	
Royalty	calculations	are	detailed	below:	
	
From	1	July	2010	the	Mineral	Royalty	Act	levies	royalty	at	a	rate	of	20	per	cent	(prior	to	1	July	2010	the	
rate	was	18	per	cent)	of	the	Net	Value	of	mineral	commodities	sold	or	removed	from	a	production	unit,	
regardless	 of	 the	 type	 of	 mineral	 commodity	 or	 whether	 the	 mine	 is	 situated	 on	 Crown,	 freehold,	
leasehold	or	aboriginal	land.	Net	Value	is	calculated	as	follows:	

Net	Value	=	GR	–	(OC	+	CRD	+	EEE	+	AD)		

where	–	

GR	is	the	gross	realization	from	the	production	unit;	
OC	represents	the	operating	costs	of	the	production	unit	for	the	royalty	year;	
CRD	is	the	Capital	Recognition	Deduction	on	eligible	capital	assets	expenditure;	
EEE	is	any	eligible	exploration	expenditure;	and	
AD	represents	additional	deduction	as	approved	by	the	Minister.	

 
A	 "production	unit"	 is	 a	 mining	 tenement	 of	 two	 or	 more	 mining	 tenements	 operating	 as	 part	 of	 an	
integrated	operation.	It	also	extends	to	other	facilities	(whether	or	not	adjacent	to	the	mining	tenements)	
that	are	essential	for	the	production	of	a	saleable	mineral	commodity.	
Net	 value	 for	 royalty	 is	 thus	 defined	 as	 the	 value	 of	 minerals	 sold	 or	 removed	 without	 sale	 plus	 an	
adjustment	for	assets	disposed	of,	less	
	

  

  All	operating	costs	directly	attributable	to	the	production	of	saleable	mineral	commodity	
including	certain	marketing	and	administration	costs,	except	income	tax,	royalty	and	
royalty‐like	payments;	

  
  An	allowance	for	capital	investments	called	Capital	Recognition	Deduction	(CRD).	CRD	is	

akin	to	depreciation	and	incorporates	an	interest	rate	factor	(based	on	the	Australian	
Federal	Securities	long	term	bond	rate	plus	an	effective	annual	premium	of	4	per	cent)	over	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	

[48]	
	

a	CRD	life	category	life	category	of	3,	5	or	10	years.	The	CRD	life	category	is	based	on	the	
period	over	which	depreciation	is	allowed	for	income	tax	purposes.		

  
  Approved	negative	Net	Value	from	previous	years,	which	can	be	carried	forward	provided	

the	production	unit	continues	to	operate,	if	approved	by	the	Department;	and	

    Any	additional	deductions	under	section	4CA	of	the	Act.	

Furthermore,	the	first	$50	000	of	Net	Value	is	not	liable	to	royalty.	This	exempts	a	number	of	small	mines	
from	royalty	payment	entirely.	

Royalty	is	payable	by	six	monthly	provisional	payments.	An	annual	return	detailing	the	actual	royalty	
payable	together	with	payment	for	any	additional	liability	must	be	lodged	within	three	months	after	the	
end	of	each	royalty	year.	Interest	applies	for	late	payment	and	further	penalties	may	apply	if	the	sum	of	the	
provisional	payments	is	less	than	80	per	cent	of	the	actual	royalty	payable.	
	
Other	 royalty	 payments,	 attributable	 to	 specific	 tenement	 or	 joint	 venture	 areas,	 are	 payable	 to	 prior	
property	 owners,	 both	 individuals	 and	 companies.	 These	 royalties	 have	 been	 summarized	 in	 various	
historical	reports	and	presentations	and	are	included	below.	However,	the	author	has	not	reviewed	or	
investigated	 individual	 title	 information	 and	 this	 information,	 which	 may	 not	 be	 complete,	
accurate	or	current,	and	is	presented	subject	to	the	disclaimer	provided	in	Section	3.0,	above.	

4.11.1 	BURNSIDE	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
 AngloGold	Ashanti	Australia	Limited	-	a	vendor	royalty	of	$A20	per	ounce	of	gold	produced	and	

sold	 from	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 underground	mine.	 Royalty	 payments	 have	 been	made	 under	 this	
Royalty	agreement.	
	

 Cyprus	 Amax	 Australia	 Corporation	 -	 a	 vendor	 royalty	 of	 1%	 of	 gold	 produced	 from	 certain	
tenements	 in	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 area,	 which	 includes	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 underground	mine;	 the	
royalty	becomes	payable	only	after	recovery	of	all	operating	and	capital	costs	 involved	with	the	
post‐1995	development	 of	 the	Brocks	Creek	 tenements,	 and	 therefore	nil	 or	minimal	 royalty	 is	
expected	to	be	paid.	Historical	records	in	relation	to	this	royalty	are	unavailable	and	it	is	unlikely	
that	liability	for	this	royalty	can	be	properly	ascertained.	

 Karen	 On	 (formally	 Ben	 Hall)	 and	Mary	 and	 Joseph	 Groves	 –	 a	 vendor	 royalty	 of	 3%	 of	 gross	
product	from	any	mining	operation	on	four	tenements	held	‐	Crocodile,	Goldin,	the	Tally	Ho	and	
Fountain	Head	area.	

4.11.2 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

 Vendor	royalty	of	$A4	per	ounce	of	gold	produced	from	certain	Pine	Creek	tenements,	payable	to	
a	privately	owned	company,	Silver	Coin	Mining	and	Prospecting	Pty	Ltd.	Silver	Coin	mining	 is	a	
company	 formed	 from	 local	members	 of	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Community,	 negotiations	 have	 started	
between	Crocodile	Gold	and	Silver	Coin	Mining.

4.11.3 	MAUD	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

 The	Maud	Creek	Project	is	subject	to	a	1%	ad	valorem	royalty	which	is	payable	for	any	future	gold	
production	above	250,000	ounces	derived	from	the	Maud	Creek	Project	and	a	1%	royalty	payable	
with	 respect	 to	mineral	 extraction	on	 certain	 tenements	which	 are	 located	outside	 the	 currently	
anticipated	mineral	extraction	areas.	This	royalty	is	payable	to	Harmony	Gold.		
	

 A	 vendor	 royalty	 of	 $5	 per	 ounce	 of	 gold	 produced	 from	mining	 operations	 conducted	 on	 eight	
tenements	 held	 by	 Crocodile	 Gold	 forming	 part	 of	 the	 Maud	 Creek	 Project	 is	 payable	 to	 Mt.	
Carrington	Mines	Pty	Ltd.		

4.11.4 	UNION	REEFS	GOLD	PROJECT	

 A	vendor	royalty	of	1.5%	if	mining	for	the	purposes	of	commercial	production	of	gold	commences	
on	 10	 tenements	 held	 by	 Crocodile	 Gold	 in	 the	 Union	 Reefs	 area	 is	 payable	 to	 Robert	 Michael	
Biddlecombe.	.		The	Royalty	is	not	payable	on	gold	mined	from	the	main	Union	Reefs	mining	lease	
(MLN1109)	but	leases	north	around	the	historical	Elizabeth	mine.	The	tenements	that	this	royalty	
apply	are	MCN's	734,	506,	507,	735,	738,	MLN's	779,	135,	779,	780,	882	and	856.	

4.11.5 	MOUNT	BUNDY	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
 The	Mount	Bundy	Gold	Project	is	subject	to	the	Rustler's	Roost	Mining	Pty	Limited	Royalty	for	1%	

of	 the	value	of	gold	produced	 from	MCN's	68‐91.	These	 leases	are	 located	around	the	Quest	29	
historical	mining	area	

	
The	Mount	Bundy	Gold	Project	has	historically	had	sufficient	carry	forward	deductions	such	that	no	NTG	
mineral	 royalty	 has	 been	 assessed.	 The	 future	 use	 of	 such	 deductions	 is	 fully	 dependent	 upon	 the	
ownership	 and	 form	 of	 operations	 going	 forward,	 as	 well	 as	 satisfaction	 of	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	
Northern	Territory	Mineral	Royalty	Act	1982	(as	amended).	

4.12 	ENVIRONMENTAL	CONSIDERATIONS	

	
The	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	lie	within	areas	which	have	been	subject	to	significant	historical	
mining	and	ore	processing	activities	 for	over	100	years.	This	historical	activity,	 like	many	mining	areas	
worldwide,	 has	 left	 permanent	 evidence	 of	 this	 activity	 on	 the	 physical	 landscape	 and	 the	 natural	
environmental	balance	may	also	have	affected.		
	
Location	of	 the	Properties	within	an	environment	characterized	by	 low	relief,	abundant	ephemeral	and	
permanent	drainage	and,	particularly	closer	to	the	coast	at	the	Mont	Bundy	area,	sizeable	billabongs	and	
wetlands	 and	 a	 monsoonal	 wet	 season	 with	 heavy	 rainfall	 requires	 careful	 management	 of	 water,	
particularly	discharge	water	from	mining	and	milling	operations.	
	
Acid	rock	drainage	is	an	issue	at	several	locations	and	various	systems	have	been	developed	to	carefully	
manage	this	issue.

Crocodile	 Gold	 has	 included	 environmental	 management	 as	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 its	 operations.	 All	
exploration	activities	and	mining	operations	have	been	performed	in	compliance	with	all	environmental	
regulations	 within	 a	 defined	 environmental	 management	 program.	 past	 operators	 reported	 that	
environmental	assessments	and	project	reviews	have	been	completed	as	required	and	were	thoroughly	
scrutinized	before	commencement	of	operations.		
	
Site	rehabilitation	and	reclamation	has	also	been	completed	in	a	number	of	locations.	.	This	is	currently	an	
active	part	of	the	mining	operations	with	waste	dump	rehabilitation	a	part	of	the	daily	mining	activities.	
Site	 rehabilitation	 is	 factored	 into	 the	operation	costs	 for	 the	earth	moving	contractor	and	 is	 therefore	
required	to	be	completed	as	soon	as	areas	become	available.	
	
All	recent	mining	operations	have	operated	in	accordance	to	Mine	Management	Plans	submitted	to	DoR,	
with	various	environmental	permits	in	place,	particularly	including	Waste	Discharge	Permits.	
	
Since	Crocodile	Gold	took	over	the	responsibility	of	the	tenements	in	November	2009	several	steps	have	
been	taken	to	ensure	the	environmental	sustainability	of	the	project.	Several	historical	issues	have	been	
noted	and	the	Company	is	in	the	process	on	ensuring	these	legacy	issues	are	managed.	An	example	of	this	
is	the	current	plan	for	Crocodile	Gold	to	develop	a	biological	acid	treatment	plant	for	the	Cosmo	area	to	
treat	low	pH	material	coming	from	the	old	Cosmo	waste	dump.	
	
There	 are	 currently	 no	 investigations	 of	 breaches	 of	 any	 regulatory	 regime	 nor	 are	 there	 any	 current	
sanctions	 or	 restrictions	 imposed	 by	 	 Government	 Departments	 	 The	 Territory	 Government	 has	 a	
constant	review	process	including	site	visits.	On	these	visits	they	inspect	current	and	past	mining	areas	to	
ensure	Crocodile	Gold	is	compliant	to	the	MMP's	approved	as	well	as	the	relevant	Mining	Act.	To	date	no	
major	issues	have	been	identified	or	recorded	against	the	Company.

Within	 the	 Burnside	 Gold	 &	 Base	 Metals	 Project	 area,	 the	 deposits	 which	 are	 most	 likely	 to	 have	
significant	future	environmental	concerns	are	Brocks	Creek	and	Cosmo	Deeps	underground	operations,	
and	the	Fountain	Head/Tally	Ho,	Rising	Tide,	Howley	Pit,	Mottrams	and	North	Point,	and	Iron	Blow	and

Cosmo	and	Howley	Pits	and	Cosmo	Deeps	
	
The	 mill	 site,	 stores	 area	 and	 core	 farm	 areas	 remain	 in	 use	 and	 will	 require	 rehabilitation	 on	 final	
closure.	Former	heap	 leach	pads	have	been	used	to	cap	the	Cosmo	Howley	waste	dump.	Future	mining	
activities	are	planned	at	Cosmo	Deeps	(which	underlies	the	Cosmo	Howley	open	pit)	and	the	Howley	area	
(which	 lies	 along	 strike	 to	 the	northwest	 of	 Cosmo	Howley).	 These	 areas	will	 need	 to	be	 rehabilitated

Cosmo	Deeps	operates	(as	part	of	the	overall	Cosmo	Howley	–	Brocks	Creek	operation)	with	an	approved	
Waste	 Discharge	 License	 (WDL	 180),	 which	 requires	 monitoring	 of	 surface	 water	 run‐off	 and	 the	
associated	passive	release	of	these	waters	during	the	wet	season.	The	Cosmo	open	pit	currently	contains	
some	5.5	million	cubic	meters	of	pH	3.8‐4.0	water.	Site	drainage	has	been	modified	to	 flow	into	a	Mine	
Water	 Dam	 in	 order	 to	 minimize	 contamination	 and	 allow	 passive	 discharge.	 Secondary	 dilution	 is	
employed	prior	to	controlled	release	during	high	rainfall	events	to	ensure	protection	of	the	environment.	
	
CGAO	proposed	to	use	the	oxide	waste	from	open	pit	mining	operations	at	the	Howley	zone	to	re‐contour	
the	Cosmo	waste	dump	in	order	to	significantly	reduce	the	quantity	of	acid	drainage	from	the	toe	of	the	
dump.		
	
Reclamation	bonds	are	in	place	to	cover	various	reclamation	and	rehabilitation	costs	for	smaller	open	pit	
mining	operations	at	Fountain	Head/Tally	Ho,	Howley	South,	and	North	Point	and	Princess	Louise	open	
pits.	A	small	reclamation	bond	is	also	in	place	to	cover	various	environmental	liabilities	associated	with	
regional	exploration	activities.	

4.13.2 	BROCKS	CREEK		

	
All	waste	dumps	at	the	Brocks	Creek	Project	Area	have	been	or	are	in	the	process	of	being	rehabilitated.	
The	previous	operators	had	partially	capped	the	historical	Faded	Lily	tailings	dam	with	the	oxide	waste	
rock	from	the	Rising	Tide	open	pit.	There	is	a	plan	in	the	future	to	use	this	tailings	dam	as	an	evaporation	
pond,	then	finally	cap	the	dam	in	approximately	2015.	
	
The	Brocks	Creek	tailings	dam	and	waste	dumps,	which	were	inherited	from	the	previous	owners,	are	in	a	
stable	form	and	are	rehabilitating	naturally	with	grass	cover	establishing	itself	around	the	perimeter	of	
the	tailings	dam.	Acid	drainage	is	not	an	issue	at	Brocks	Creek	although	previous	monitoring	has	shown	
there	 is	elevated	arsenic	 levels	 in	water	discharged	 from	the	Brocks	Creek	underground	mine.	No	acid	
drainage	emanates	from	the	waste	dumps.	
	
The	 Brocks	 Creek	 mine	 site	 operates	 with	 an	 approved	 Waste	 Discharge	 License	 (WDL	 180)	 that	 is	
combined	with	 the	Cosmo	Howley	WDL,	regarding	wastewater	discharge	 in	 the	wet	season.	A	monthly	
sampling	regime	is	employed	to	monitor	creek	flows	and	creek	water	quality.	
	
The	former	Brocks	Creek	CIL	processing	facility	covered	a	relatively	small	area.	This	area	has	largely	been	
rehabilitated,	with	only	the	plant	foundations,	office	buildings	and	some	scrap	metal	remaining.	

4.13.3 	UNION	REEFS	GOLD	PROJECT	

Union	Reefs	
	
The	area	surrounding	Union	Reefs	comprises	of	 a	number	of	open	cut	pits	and	underground	adits	and	
shafts.	Several	small	pits	have	been	bunded	and	currently	do	not	require	significant	rehabilitation.	
	
Water	is	regularly	monitored	and	the	site	has	a	Water	Discharge	License	(WDL	138‐1)	for	surface	runoff	
during	the	wet	season.	This	is	in	conjunction	with	the	Unions	Reefs	Gold	Plant	water	monitoring	program.

[52]	
	

The	Union	Reefs	gold	plant	was	re‐commissioned	in	December	2009	by	CGAO	after	being	placed	into	care	
and	 maintenance	 when	 the	 previous	 operators	 went	 into	 receivership.	 Rehabilitation	 of	 historical	
disturbances	 is	 substantially	 complete;	 recent	 and	 on‐going	 disturbances	 will	 be	 required	 to	 be	
rehabilitated	upon	completion	of	mining	and	processing.	
	
Tailings	 from	 the	processing	plant	 are	 treated	 and	 then	deposited	 in	 the	 former	Crosscourse	open	pit,	
which	is	estimated	to	have	capacity	for	tailings	at	an	assumed	rate	of	2.5Mtpa	for	the	next	20‐30	years.	
The	water	and	tailings	level	in	the	pit	is	regularly	monitored.	
	
The	 site	has	 an	 annual	Waste	Discharge	 License	 (WDL	138‐1)	 for	 surface	water	 runoff	 during	 the	wet	
season.	A	comprehensive	surface	water	monitoring	program	is	in	operation	at	this	site.		
	

4.13.4 PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
The	former	Pine	Creek	mining	operation	has	been	rehabilitated	and	is	in	compliance	with	NT	Government	
rehabilitation	 completion	 guidelines.	 All	 open	 pits	 at	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 project,	with	 the	 exception	 of	 the	
Enterprise	and	South	Gandy's	open	pits,	were	backfilled	and	rehabilitated	during	operations.	
	
A	monitoring	program	is	maintained,	particularly	over	the	tailings	dams,	southern	waste	rock	dump,	run‐
of‐mine	 ("ROM")	 pad	 (stockpile	 3)	 and	 the	 heap	 leach	 operations	 that	 were	 capped/repaired/	
rehabilitated	and	seeded	during	2001/02.	Work	is	planned	to	repair	some	remediation	undertaken	by	the	
previous	operators	on	a	small	section	of	one	WRD.		
	
A	water	monitoring	program	is	undertaken	as	per	the	requirements	of	the	WDL	166‐1,	which	is	a	license	
for	 passive	 discharge.	 A	 currently	 project	 is	 being	 undertaken	 to	 determine	 the	 effects	 of	 a	 passive	
discharge	on	the	downstream	environment.	This	is	according	to	the	WDL	166‐1.	
	
There	have	been	a	number	of	major	reports	previously	submitted	to	the	Northern	Territory	Government	
regarding	 the	 rehabilitation	 activities	 undertaken	 at	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 project.	 The	 rehabilitation	 work	
undertaken	has	been	widely	recognized,	having	won	an	award	for	environmental	excellence	in	2002.	In	
addition,	 the	 site	 was	 also	 selected	 by	 the	 Australian	 Centre	 for	 Minesite	 Environmental	 Research	
(ACMER)	national	study	of	Landscape	Functional	Analysis	as	an	index	of	rehabilitation	success	on	mines	
in	1997.	The	Pine	Creek	project	has	been	regularly	utilized	as	a	field	trip	venue	to	demonstrate	excellence	
in	environmental	management	for	conferences	and	seminars.	
	

4.13.5 MAUD	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
Previous	mining	activities	on	the	site	have	been	limited	to	open	pit	mining,	with	all	ore	transported	offsite	
for	treatment	elsewhere.	This	mining	activity	occurred	during	2000	and	the	proponent,	Katherine	Mining	
NL,	submitted	a	Public	Environmental	Report	to	the	Northern	Territory	Government,	which	was	subject	
to	scrutiny	by	the	Northern	Territory	regulatory	authorities	and	the	public.	
	
No	acid	rock	drainage	or	salinity	are	currently	experienced	at	Maud	Creek,	however	careful	attention	has	
been	 paid	 on	 the	 project's	 impacts	 on	 surface	 and	 ground	 water	 quality	 due	 to	 the	 proximity	 of	 the

Katherine	drinking	water	supply	scheme.	Low	concentrations	of	arsenic	have	been	previously	reported	in	
local	groundwater.		
	

4.13.6 	MOLINE	GOLD	AND	BASE	METAL	PROJECT	

	
Moline	 is	 currently	under	care	and	maintenance.	Historically,	 this	area	was	subject	 to	open	cut	mining	
with	4	major	ore	sources	and	up	to	20	small	pits.	There	are	four	major	water	storage	areas	and	drainage	
work	was	undertaken	by	CGAO	to	have	any	potential	overflow	from	the	pits	filter	through	an	ephemeral	
wetland	system	to	polish	the	water	prior	to	it	discharging	off	site.	
	
Moline	was	also	the	site	of	CGAO	first	bioreactor	trial	in	2010.	This	process	is	being	developed	to	be	able	
to	treat	Acid	Rock	Drainage	prior	to	being	released	from	site.	The	field	trial	showed	promising	results.	
	
Infrastructure	remaining	on	site	is	the	old	mess	building	(that	has	been	converted	to	a	caretaker's	home)	
and	mill	footings.	
	

4.13.7 	MOUNT	BUNDY	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
Tom's	Gully	
	
The	Tom's	Gully	Gold	Project	lies	within	the	catchment	area	of	Mt	Bundy	Creek,	which	flows	into	Hardies	
Creek	16km	downstream	and	 then	 into	 the	Mary	River	Conservation	Park.	The	 total	 catchment	area	 is	
117km2.		

The	upper	reaches	of	Mt	Bundy	Creek	are	typically	slightly	acidic	and	show	variability	in	dissolved	and	
suspended	 solids,	 including	 sulphates,	 aluminium,	 iron	 and	 manganese;	 however,	 the	 water	 quality	
always	remains	within	acceptable	stock	water	standards.	Downstream	of	the	project,	the	receiving	waters	
can	be	acidic	and	at	 times	may	contain	elevated	 levels	of	 some	metals,	which	 is	not	necessarily	due	 to	
mining	activities.	
	
During	 periods	 of	 high	 rainfall,	 high	 turbidity	 and	 suspended	 solid	 loads	 have	 been	 encountered	
upstream	and	downstream	of	the	project	site.	The	static	natural	groundwater	table	for	the	project	area	is	
5	 to	 25	meters	 below	 the	 surface	 and	 has	 been	 intersected	 previous	mining	 and	mineral	 exploration.	
Current	 usage	 of	 groundwater	 is	 restricted	 to	 stock	 watering.	 Groundwater	 from	 the	 project	 site	 is	
effectively	fresh	with	low	total	dissolved	solids	and	usually	meets	ANZECC	Stockwater	Standards.	
	
Acid	Rock	Drainage	has	been	 identified	at	Tom's	Gully,	 emanating	 from	both	oxide	and	sulphide	waste	
rock	dumps	created	during	open	pit	mining	activities	in	the	late	1980's	and	early	1990's.	Acidified	runoff	
and	 seepage	 water	 from	 the	 waste	 dumps	 is	 currently	 being	 controlled	 by	 a	 series	 of	 bunds	 and	
evaporation	ponds	to	minimize	uncontrolled	discharge	of	water	into	Mt	Bundy	Creek.	Previous	operators	
also	used	lime	to	treat	acidic	waters,	but	this	has	since	been	consumed	or	dissipated.	An	artificial	wetland	
has	since	been	constructed,	and	 it	 is	 reported	 that	 this	 removes	a	considerable	amount	of	metals	 from	
solution.	
	
A	groundwater	monitoring	program	 includes	routine	sampling	of	monitoring	bores	(wells)	and	surface	
drainage.

Vegetative	rehabilitation	of	historical	oxide	and	sulphide	dumps	created	by	previous	operators	had	been	
continued	 by	 the	 previous	 operator.	 There	 is	 significant	 tree	 and	 understory	 growth	 on	 both	 dumps.	
There	are	no	reports	of	dump	instability.	
	
Currently	the	site	is	in	care	and	maintenance	with	all	surface	water	being	pumped	back	into	the	pit.	
	
Rustlers	Roost	
	
Rustlers	Roost	mine	 is	 approximately	21km	upstream	of	Tom's	Gully	mine.	Rustlers	Roost	was	 a	heap	
leach	operation	that	operated	in	the	late	1990's	and	early	2000's.	
	
Oxide	material	 was	mined,	 crushed	 and	 stockpiled	 on	 leaching	 pads.	Waste	material	 was	 stockpile	 in	
typical	waste	rock	dump	formation.	
	
There	currently	has	not	been	any	significant	rehabilitation	of	 the	waste	rock	dump.	 leach	pads	or	 leach	
ponds.	
	
Surface	water	is	regularly	monitored.	
	
The	site	is	currently	being	placed	in	care	and	maintenance	since	CGAO	assumed	responsibility	for	the	site.	
	
Quest	29	
	
Quest	 29	 mine	 sits	 between	 Rustlers	 Roost	 and	 Tom's	 Gully.	 Quest	 29	 was	 a	 small	 oxide	 heap	 leach	
operation	operated	in	the	late	1990's.		
	
Three	 small	 pits	 supplied	 oxide	 ore	 that	 was	 mined,	 crushed	 and	 stockpiled	 on	 leach	 pads.	 There	
currently	 isn't	 any	 rehabilitation	 undertaken	 on	 the	 heap	 leach,	 leach	 pad	 and	 small	 amount	 of	
mechanical	infrastructure.	
	
Water	in	the	leach	ponds	is	regularly	monitored	and	water	is	managed	within	the	site	to	ensure	that	no	
water	is	discharged	to	the	environment.	
	
The	site	is	currently	being	placed	in	care	and	maintenance	since	CGAO	assumed	responsibility	for	the	site.	

4.14 ENVIRONMENTAL	MANAGEMENT 	PLAN	

Under	the	terms	of	the	Northern	Territory	Mining	Management	Act	2001,	existing	mining	operations	in	
the	Northern	Territory	are	required	to	submit	an	annual	Mine	Management	Plan	("MMP")	 to	DoR.	This	
plan	covers	key	aspects	of	mine	operation,	Occupational	Health	and	Safety,	environmental	management	
and	 mine	 closure.	 This	 plan	 is	 then	 assessed	 and	 audited	 by	 DoR.	 Upon	 approval	 of	 the	 MMP,	 an	
Authorization	to	Operate	is	issued	to	the	mining	operation.		
	
CGAO	 has	 submitted	 annual	 MMPs	 for	 all	 of	 its	 operating	 and	 exploration	 activities,	 and	 provided	
required	annual	reports	to	DoR	and	other	relevant	departments.	
 
CGAO	has	MMP's	in	place	with	the	NT	DoR	for	the	Properties	(Table	4‐4).

5 	ACCESSIBILITY, 	CLIMATE, 	LOCAL 	RESOURCES,	
	INFRASTRUCTURE 	& 	PHYSIOGRAPHY 	 	

The	Northern	Territory	is	the	least	populated	of	all	areas	in	Australia.	It	encapsulates	a	total	area	of	1.35	
million	 square	 kilometers	 and	 accounts	 for	 20%	of	 the	whole	 country;	 however,	 just	 182,000	 or	 1%	of	
Australia's	population	reside	there.		
	
The	 Territory	 varies	 considerably	 in	 topography,	 climate,	 and	 infrastructure.	 The	 "Top	End",	where	 the	
Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 are	 located,	 is	 home	 to	 the	 vast	 Aboriginal	 Arnhem	 Land	 which	
includes	 the	 Kakadu	 National	 Park.	 The	 region	 is	 dry	 between	 April	 and	 September,	 and	 wet	 between	
October	and	March.	During	the	wet	season	everything	is	green	and	there	is	no	dust;	however,	the	humidity	
and	temperatures	are	high	and	access	"off	road"	is	difficult.		

The	centre	is	extremely	arid,	with	greatly	varying	temperatures	and	is	known	as	the	"Red	Centre"	named	
because	red	is	the	predominant	color	found	in	the	soil.	

Darwin,	 Capital	 of	 the	Northern	 Territory,	 lies	 on	 the	 coast	 to	 the	 north	 and	 provides	 the	majority	 of	
infrastructure	support	and	services	for	the	mining	industry.	The	Stuart	Highway,	which	virtually	bisects	
the	 country,	 is	 the	 main	 road	 that	 leads	 from	 Darwin	 to	 Alice	 Springs	 then	 on	 to	 Adelaide	 in	 South	
Australia.	
	

	

5.1 	TOPOGRAPHY	

	
Generally	 the	 topography	 of	 the	 Property	 area	 is	 flat,	 locally	 gently	 undulating	 near	 the	 coast	 (Mount	
Bundy	Gold	 Project)	 and	 slightly	more	 elevated	 and	 locally	 rugged	 towards	Katherine	 at	 the	 southern	
extremity	of	the	Northern	Territory	Properties.	
	
In	 the	 vicinity	 of	 the	 Projects,	 elevations	 range	 from	 35m	 to	 50m	 above	 mean	 sea	 level.	 Drainage	 is	
generally	to	the	north	to	the	Timor	Sea	via	ephemeral	creeks,	streams	and	gullied	tributaries	to	Mary	and	
Alligator	River,	two	major	rivers	running	north	to	the	coast.		
 
Further	south,	the	local	area	of	the	Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Pine	Creek	and	Moline	projects	is	made	up	of	a	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

	 	 Australia	

[59]	
	

complex	 of	 landforms	 which	 include	 plains,	 peneplains,	 rises	 and	 low	 hills	 that	 are	 built	 of	
undifferentiated	 Palaeoproterozoic	 metasedimentary	 units.	 	 A	 series	 of	 east‐west	 trending	 hills	
comprising	granite	pavements	punctuate	the	plains	and	are	characterized	by	rocky	outcrops	and	sandy	
gravely	soils.		The	topography	of	the	area	varies	from	35m	to	300m	above	sea	level.	
 
Numerous	 ephemeral	 watercourses	 including	 the	 Adelaide,	 McKinley	 and	 Margaret	 Rivers	 drain	
northwards	to	the	Timor	Sea	across	the	Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Pine	Creek	and	Moline	project	tenements.	
	
In	 the	Maud	Creek	area,	 the	 terrain	 is	 flat	 lying	 to	undulating.	 	Ephemeral	streams	transect	 the	project	
area	and	drain	into	the	westward	flowing	Katherine	River	that	flows	all	year.		Land	units	occurring	within	
the	Maud	Creek	area	include:	
	

 rugged	terrain	with	slopes	15	to	40%	with	shallow	or	skeletal	soils;	
 hilly	terrain	with	slopes	5	to	15%	rocky	and	boulder	strewn	with	shallow	and	skeletal	soils;	
 gently	undulating	crests	and	upper	slopes	to	5%	with	shallow	rocky	soils;	
 undulating	terrain	with	slopes	5	to	10%	with	grey	and	brown	clays;	and	
 major	creeks	and	gullied	tributaries.	

	

5.2 	ACCESS	

	
Access	 to	 the	 Properties	 is	 from	 Darwin,	 capital	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory,	 which	 is	 an	 important	
communication	 and	 transportation	 centre,	 with	 a	 busy	 port	 and	 international	 airport	 providing	 daily	
services	to	other	Australian	capital	cities	and	several	Asia‐Pacific	destinations.		
	
The	Stuart	Highway,	the	area's	major	thoroughfare,	and	the	Adelaide‐to‐Darwin	transcontinental	railway	
line	bisect	Australia	in	a	north‐south	sense	and	provide	access	to	the	Burnside	Gold	Projects.	The	mining	
areas	and	Union	Reefs	plant	 sites	are	easily	accessed	via	good	all‐weather	 roads	and	 there	 is	 excellent	
road,	rail,	water	and	electric	power	infrastructure.			
	
The	 Arnhem	Highway,	 which	 links	 Darwin	with	 the	 uranium	mining	 centre	 of	 Jabiru	 and	 the	 Kakadu	
National	Park	passes	just	north	of	the	Tom's	Gully	Gold	Mine	and	provides	access	to	tenements	associated	
with	that	project.	
 
The	Burnside,	Union	Reefs	and	Pine	Creek	projects	all	lie	between	the	towns	of	Pine	Creek	and	Adelaide	
River	to	the	southeast	of	the	Northern	Territory's	capital	city	of	Darwin.	Access	is	gained	to	the	Burnside	
Project	 from	 Darwin	 by	 travelling	 for	 some	 160km	 along	 the	 sealed	 Stuart	 Highway,	 thence	 turning	
northeasterly	along	the	sealed	Fountain	Head	Road	for	some	12km.			

The	Union	Reefs	plant	is	 located	approximately	185km	southeast	of	Darwin,	15km	north	of	the	town	of	
Pine	Creek.	
	
The	 Maud	 Creek	 project	 area,	 located	 285km	 southeast	 of	 Darwin	 and	 approximately	 20km	 east‐
northeast	 of	 the	 township	 of	 Katherine,	 a	 regional	 centre	 with	 excellent	 infrastructure	 and	
communications,	is	accessed	from	Katherine	by	heading	south	along	the	bitumen	Stuart	Highway,	turning	
east	 onto	Ross	Road	 and	 then	 continuing	 in	 a	northeasterly	 direction	 along	 approximately	8km	of	 un‐
sealed	haul	road.		
	
The	Moline	 project	 is	 accessed	 along	 the	 bitumen	 Kakadu	Highway	which	 connects	 Pine	 Creek	 to	 the	
township	of	Jabiru.		Access	throughout	the	project	area	is	largely	via	gravel	station	tracks.

5.3 	CLIMATE	&	VEGETATION	

	
The	 "Top	End"	of	 the	Northern	Territory	has	a	 tropical	monsoon	climate	 characterized	by	 two	distinct	
seasonal	 patterns:	 the	 'wet'	 monsoon	 and	 the	 'dry'	 seasons.	 	 The	 wet	 season	 generally	 occurs	 from	
November	 through	 to	 April	 and	 the	 dry	 season	 between	 May	 and	 October.	 Almost	 all	 rainfall	 occurs	
during	 the	 wet	 season,	 mostly	 between	 December	 and	 March,	 and	 the	 total	 rainfall	 decreases	 with	
distance	from	the	coast.		Mining	operations	are	largely	unaffected	by	normal	seasonal	conditions.		
	
The	mean	daily	maximum	temperature,	as	recorded	at	Darwin	on	the	northern	coastline,	 is	31°C	in	the	
coolest	months	of	 June	to	August	and	33°C	in	the	hottest	months	of	October	and	November.	 	The	mean	
daily	 minimum	 temperature	 in	 Darwin	 range	 from	 approximately	 19°C	 (dry	 season)	 to	 25°C	 (wet	
season).		The	average	annual	rainfall	at	Darwin	is	1,713	mm.	
	
The	mean	daily	maximum	temperature,	as	recorded	at	Katherine,	is	31°C	in	the	coolest	months	of	June	to	
August	and	38°C	in	the	hottest	months	of	October	and	November.	The	mean	daily	minimum	temperatures	
at	 Katherine	 range	 from	 approximately	 13°C	 (dry	 season)	 to	 24°C	 (wet	 season).	 The	 average	 annual	
rainfall	at	Katherine	is	971	mm.	
	
During	 the	 wet	 season,	 high	 intensity	 rainfall	 events	 are	 common,	 resulting	 in	 local	 flash	 flooding	 of	
ephemeral	streams	and	watercourses.		Mining	operations	are	continuous	throughout	the	year;	however,	
increased	ore	stockpiling	is	undertaken	in	the	lead	up	to	the	wet	season	thereby	offsetting	the	reduced	
mining	movements	over	that	period.	Experience	has	shown	that	it	is	best	to	shut	down	ore	hauling	during	
periods	of	extreme	rainfall	as	damage	to	haul	roads	by	large	trucks	may	occur	quickly.	
	
The	annual	evaporation	rate	remains	high	throughout	most	of	the	Northern	Territory,	ranging	from	2,400	
mm	to	4,000	mm	per	annum.	Monthly	evaporation	exceeds	 rainfall	 for	eight	months	of	 the	year	at	 the	
coast	increasing	to	the	whole	year	inland.		It	remains	relatively	high	even	during	the	wet	season.	

Climate	 gradually	 moves	 from	 seasonally	 wet	 tropical	 in	 the	 north	 to	 arid	 in	 the	 south,	 with	
corresponding	changes	in	landscape,	with	areas	of	rocky	escarpment	and	plateau	which	break	a	low	relief	
in	the	north	and	rocky	ridges	in	the	south.	

The	Northern	Territory	has	a	diversity	of	vegetation	that	is	maintained	by	its	variety	of	climate	and	soils.	
Natural	vegetation	of	the	Properties	is	typical	of	savannahs	of	the	northern	part	of	Australia,	dominated	
by	Eucalypt	species	with	a	grassy	understorey	dominated	by	sorghum	species.	The	Northern	Territory	is	
the	only	area	in	Australia	that	does	not	have	conspicuous	temperate	flora.		

In	 the	 north,	 the	 vegetation	 is	 typically	 tropical	 savannah	 (eucalypt	 woodland	 and	 eucalypt	 open	
woodland	with	a	grassy	understory).	This	landscape	experiences	dramatic	seasonal	changes	with	intense	
growth	in	the	wet	season	(summer)	and	widespread	fires	in	the	dry	season	(winter).	Famous	worldwide	
for	the	tropical	wetlands	and	rugged	sandstone	escarpments	of	Kakadu	National	Park,	the	wetlands	are	of	
importance	 for	 conservation,	 providing	 breeding	 areas,	 habitat	 and	 refuge	 for	 important	 wildlife	
populations.	

From	 the	 north,	 a	 transition	 area	moves	 from	 eucalypt	woodlands	 into	 areas	 of	melaleuca	 and	 acacia	
forests	 and	 woodlands	 and	 south	 into	 the	 spinifex	 (hummock	 grasslands),	 Mitchell	 grass	 (tussock	
grasslands)	 and	 acacia	 woodlands	 and	 shrublands.	 The	 vegetation	 increases	 in	 diversity	 around	 Alice	
Springs	 with	 areas	 of	 mulga,	 mallee,	 chenopods,	 hummock	 grasslands,	 small	 pockets	 of	 eucalypt	
woodlands	and	salt	lakes.

The	 Mount	 Bundy	 Gold	 Project	 lies	 within	 the	 Darwin	 Coastal	 Region.	 This	 bioregion	 has	 gently	
undulating	plains	and	is	within	the	tropical	monsoonal	north	of	Australia,	with	a	distinct	wet	dry	season	
and	 high	 temperatures	 throughout	 the	 year.	 It	 includes	 the	 city	 of	 Darwin.	 Dominant	 vegetation	 is	
eucalypt	 open	 forests,	 tropical	 eucalypt	 woodlands/grasslands,	 melaleuca	 forests	 and	 woodlands	 and	
grasslands	group	on	the	floodplains.	Patches	of	the	mangroves	group	and	other	shrublands	are	present.	

Major	land	uses	are	traditional	Indigenous	uses,	nature	conservation	(including	parts	of	Kakadu	National	
Park	and	World	Heritage	Area	and	Litchfield	National	Park),	urban	and	other	intensive	uses	and	grazing.	
Approximately	85,000	hectares	have	been	cleared.		

The	Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Pine	Creek	and	Moline	project	areas	lie	within	the	Pine	Creek	and	Daly	River	
Bioregions.	 The	 Pine	 Creek	 Bioregion	 consists	 of	 hilly	 to	 rugged	 terrain	 and	 is	 within	 the	 tropical	
monsoonal	 belt	 of	 northern	 Australia.	 Dominant	 vegetation	 is	 tropical	 eucalypt	woodlands/grasslands	
with	some	eucalypt	open	forests,	melaleuca	forests	and	woodlands	and	rainforest	and	vine	thickets.	

The	 region	 has	 undergone	 some	 localized	 clearing	 and	 the	 major	 land	 uses	 are	 grazing,	 nature	
conservation	(including	parts	of	Kakadu	National	Park	and	World	Heritage	Area	and	Litchfield	National	
Park),	traditional	Indigenous	uses	and	other	intensive	uses	including	horticulture.		

The	Daly	Basin	Bioregion	consists	of	gently	undulating	plains	and	scattered	low	plateau	remnants	and	has	
a	 tropical	monsoonal	 climate	with	distinct	wet	and	dry	seasons	 and	high	 temperatures	 throughout	 the	
year.	Dominant	vegetation	is	tropical	eucalypt	woodlands/grasslands	and	eucalypt	open	forests.	Smaller	
patches	of	eucalypt	woodlands	and	melaleuca	forests	and	woodlands	are	present.	

The	major	land	use	is	grazing	on	native	pastures	and	traditional	Indigenous	uses	with	some	horticulture,	
grazing	 on	 modified	 pastures	 and	 nature	 conservation.	 The	 region	 has	 undergone	 some	 clearing	
(approximately	167,000	ha)	for	these	developments.		

The	Burnside,	Union	Reefs,	Pine	Creek	and	Moline	project	areas	are	characterized	by	tall,	open	eucalypt	
forests,	 typically	 dominated	 by	 Darwin	 woollybutt	 (Eucalyptus	 miniata)	 and	 Darwin	 stringybark	 (E.	
tetrodonta),	 and	 woodlands	 (dominated	 by	 a	 range	 of	 species	 including	 E.	 grandifolia,	 E.	 latifolia,	 E.	
tintinnans,	E.	confertiflora	and	E.	tectifica),	with	smaller	areas	of	monsoon	rainforest	patches,	Melaleuca	
woodlands,	riparian	vegetation	and	tussock	grasslands.			
	
The	vegetation	of	the	Maud	Creek	area	consists	largely	of	woodlands	and	open	woodlands	(predominant	
species	–	Eucalypts)	that	have	been	degraded	by	the	impacts	of	cattle,	buffalo	and	wild	donkeys.	No	rare,	
threatened	or	endangered	species	have	been	identified	in	the	area.	

5.4 	LOCAL	RESOURCES 	&	INFRASTRUCTURE	

	
Darwin	has	a	population	 in	excess	of	120,000	and	 is	 the	capital	city	of	 the	Northern	Territory.	 It	 is	 the	
administrative	 centre	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 government	 and	 a	major	 transportation	 hub,	 with	 an	
international	 airport	 and	 deep‐water	 port	 and	 the	 Adelaide	 to	 Darwin	 transcontinental	 railway	
terminating	at	the	East	Arm	port.		As	the	largest	city	in	the	Northern	Territory,	Darwin	also	has	excellent	
schools,	hospitals,	and	retail,	commercial	and	light	industrial	services.		
 
Darwin	 is	 rapidly	developing	 into	 a	 significant	 freight	 interchange	 for	 trade	with	 southeastern	Asia.	 	A	
considerable	proportion	of	 consumer	and	other	 goods	 reaching	 the	Northern	Territory	are	brought	by

[62]	
	

road	from	Queensland	or	South	Australia.	 	The	Stuart,	Arnhem,	Kakadu,	Barkley	and	Victoria	Highways	
ensure	high	service	levels	to	the	Darwin	region	from	the	Australian	capitals	and	other	regional	centers.			
	
Despite	 its	 low	 population,	 the	 area	 between	 Darwin	 and	 Katherine	 in	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 is	 well	
serviced	with	 infrastructure.	Significant	mining	operations	have	been	developed	in	the	area	 in	the	over	
past	30	years,	with	gold	ore	mining	and	processing	operations	conducted	within	or	in	close	proximity	to	
the	project	areas	at	Cosmo	Howley,	Brocks	Creek,	Pine	Creek,	Mount	Todd	and	Union	Reefs.		
	
Katherine	 is	 a	 regional	 centre	 with	 a	 population	 of	 approximately	 5,850	 and	 enjoys	 excellent	
infrastructure,	services	and	communications.		
	
The	 regional	 mining	 communities	 of	 Pine	 Creek	 (with	 a	 population	 of	 450)	 and	 Adelaide	 River	
(population	of	200)	support	the	Burnside,	Maud	Creek	and	Moline	gold	projects.	
	
The	 Arnhem	 Highway	 to	 the	 east‐southeast	 of	 Darwin	 provides	 a	 communication	 link	 to	 the	 Kakadu	
National	Park	and	Jabiru,	a	town	of	1,135	which	provides	accommodation	for	the	uranium	mines	in	the	
vicinity.	Accommodation	and	services	are	available	along	the	highway,	primarily	for	the	tourist	trade.	
	

5.5 	POWER	

	
Power	in	the	Northern	Territory	is	generated	and	distributed	by	the	Northern	Territory	Power	and	Water	
Authority	 ("NTPWA").	 	 The	 NTPWA's	 main	 gas	 turbine	 power	 station	 is	 located	 at	 Channel	 Island	 in	
Darwin,	which	is	capable	of	producing	254	megawatts	("MW").		A	19.5	MW	power	station	exists	at	Pine	
Creek	 and	 is	 interconnected	 to	 the	 132	 kilovolts	 ("kV")	 line	 from	 Darwin	 to	 Katherine.	 	 A	 66	 kV	 line	
connects	 the	Union	Reefs	processing	 facility,	Brocks	Creek,	Cosmo	Howley	and	 the	Cosmo	camp	 to	 the	
Pine	Creek	Township.		
	
Power	to	the	Tom's	Gully	minesite	is	also	sourced	from	the	NT	power	grid.	
	
Gas	 is	 supplied	 to	 the	 area	 via	 the	 Amadeus	 Basin	 to	 Darwin	 pipeline.	 Spurs	 off	 this	 pipeline	 service	
Katherine,	 Pine	 Creek	 and	 the	 Cosmo	 site.	 	 The	 recently	 completed	 Bonaparte	 gas	 pipeline	 also	 runs	
through	the	area,	connecting	with	the	Amadeus	pipeline	near	the	Fountain	Head/Tally	Ho	area.			
 

5.6 WATER	

	
The	Union	Reefs	processing	plant	sources	its	water	from	two	main	storage	dams	off	the	McKinley	River	
with	total	storage	capacity	of	some	1,970	million	liters.	 	In	addition,	the	Union	Reefs	Project	has	on‐site	
water	storage	capabilities	within	 the	 former	Crosscourse	open	pit,	which	 is	 currently	partially	 flooded.		
Pit	dimensions	are	1,300	m	by	600	m	by	240	m	deep.	Processing	plant	does	re‐cycle	some	water	from	the	
Crosscourse	pit	via	a	return	water	system.		
	
The	Burnside	project	receives	approximately	1,500	mm	in	rainfall	each	year.		The	Cosmo	accommodation	
camp	has	capacity	for	250	people	and	its	own	potable	water	bore	field	and	treatment	plant,	which	softens	
and	chlorinates	the	water	supplied	to	the	camp.		The	accommodation	camp	at	Pine	Creek	is	serviced	by	
scheme	water	managed	by	the	Pine	Creek	Community	Council.					
	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	

[63]	
	

At	Tom's	Gully,	water	for	the	camp	and	treatment	plant	is	sourced	from	six	mine	bores.	The	potable	water	
supply	is	sourced	from	Bore	P100	which	is	treated	by	reverse	osmosis	prior	to	being	available	as	potable	
water.	Shower	and	other	washing	use	raw	untreated	water	from	the	same	bore.	
	

5.7 	COMMUNICATIONS	

	
The	project	areas	have	 landline	telephone	communications	(Telstra)	as	well	as	satellite	and	microwave	
communication	 systems.	 	 Recent	 work	 has	 been	 done	 testing	 the	 suitability	 of	 a	 direct	 link	
communications	 system	 between	 sites,	 the	 outcomes	 of	 this	 study	 are	 pending.	 Mobile	 telephone	
coverage	under	the	Telstra	Next‐G	network	exists	throughout	a	large	area	of	the	mining	and	plant	sites	
and	standard	VHF	radio	communications	are	used	for	operational	purposes.			
 

5.8 	MINING	PERSONNEL	

	
The	Northern	Territory	Properties	are	located	within	an	area	that	has	a	strong	mining	tradition	and,	as	a	
result,	 the	 mining	 industry	 within	 the	 region	 is	 well	 understood	 and	 supported	 by	 the	 surrounding	
centers.	 	Mining	activities	have	a	direct	 impact	on	the	manufacturing,	service	and	hospitality	sectors	of	
the	 local	 economies	 immediately	 surrounding	 the	 Burnside,	 Union	 Reefs,	 Pine	 Creek,	Maud	 Creek	 and	
Tom's	Gully	projects,	with	mining	operations	at	Tom's	Gully,	Mount	Todd,	Maud	Creek,	Cosmo	Howley,	
Brocks	Creek,	Enterprise	and	Union	Reefs	gold	mines	previously	employing	significant	numbers	of	local	
residents.	
	
The	surrounding	provincial	centers	of	Pine	Creek	and	Adelaide	River,	which	occur	within	an	80	km	radius	
of	 the	 projects,	 provide	 good	 support	 facilities	 including	 housing,	 law	 enforcement,	 basic	medical	 and	
community	facilities.			
	
Further	afield,	the	Darwin	central	business	district	is	the	administrative	centre	for	the	Northern	Territory	
and	lies	1	to	3	hours	drive	from	the	project	tenements.		Mining,	engineering	and	consulting	firms	as	well	
as	 commercial	 assay	 laboratories	 are	 based	 in	 Darwin	 and	 other	 population	 centers	 in	 the	 Northern	
Territory	such	as	Pine	Creek.		
	
Crocodile	 Gold	 are	 involved	 with	 safety,	 management,	 mining	 engineering,	 geology	 and	 exploration,	
survey,	 stores	 control,	 processing	 and	maintenance,	 environmental	 and	permitting,	 and	 administration

6 HISTORY 	

	
Since	the	first	discovery	of	gold	in	1870,	the	Northern	Territory	has	produced	approximately	14.9	million	
ounces	 of	 gold.	 Of	 this	 total,	 an	 estimated	 3.7	million	 ounces	 have	 been	 produced	 from	 the	 Pine	 Creek	
Orogen	(Ahmad	et	al.,	2009).	 	There	are	about	eight	hundred	documented	gold	occurrences	of	potential	
economic	significance	and	a	resources	inventory	of	a	further	17	million	ounces	gold.

TABLE	6‐1	HISTORICAL	GOLD	PRODUCTION	–	PINE	CREEK	OROGEN	

	
There	have	been	three	significant	periods	of	exploration	and	gold	production.	Early	mining	(1870‐1915)	
was	 selective	 and	 concentrated	 on	 high	 grade	 (several	 10's	 of	 g/t	 Au)	 veins,	mainly	 in	 the	 Pine	 Creek	
Orogen.	During	this	period,	mining	was	from	highly	selective	shallow	pits,	shafts	and	narrow	adits	 that	
systematically	followed	the	auriferous	lodes.	These	old	mines	generally	were	confined	to	the	oxide	zone	
and	stopped	at	the	water	table.			
	
The	next	significant	phase	commenced	with	the	discovery	of	medium‐high	grade	(15‐20g/t	Au)	ironstone	
hosted	deposits	in	the	Tennant	Creek	inlier	in	1936,	with	production	peaking	during	1971‐75.	
	
The	 current	 phase	 of	 gold	 exploration	 and	 production	 commenced	 in	 1987	 and	 concentrated	 on	 bulk	
open	cut	mining	of	relatively	low‐grade	(2‐3g/t	Au)	ores.	
	

6.1 	BURNSIDE,	UNION	REEFS	AND	PINE 	CREEK	GOLD 	PROJECTS	

	
In	April	2002,	Hill	50	Ltd	("Hill	50")	and	Northern	Gold	NL	("Northern	Gold")	agreed	to	form	a	50:50	JV,	
the	Burnside	 JV,	 to	develop,	mine	and	explore	 the	 joint	assets	of	both	parties	 in	 the	Pine	Creek	region.	
Harmony	Gold	Mining	Company	Ltd	("Harmony")	subsequently	acquired	Hill	50.		
	
In	 August	 2004,	 the	 Burnside	 JV	 announced	 that	 it	 had	 acquired	 the	 Union	 Reefs	 Gold	 Project	 from	
AngloGold	Ashanti	Limited.		
	
In	late	September	2005,	Harmony	agreed	to	sell	its	interest	in	the	Burnside	JV,	including	the	Union	Reefs	
operations	to	Northern	Gold.		Shortly	thereafter,	GBS	Gold	announced	its	intention	to	make	an	off‐market	
take‐over	bid	for	Northern	Gold,	through	its	wholly	owned	subsidiary,	GBS	Gold	Australia	Pty	Ltd.

[66]	
	

By	mid‐January	2006,	GBS	Gold	had	acquired	Northern	Gold	and	its	associated	assets.	As	such,	Northern	
Gold's	interests	in	the	Burnside,	Union	Reef	and	Pine	Creek	projects	were	transferred	to	GBS	Gold.		
	
In	 September	 2008,	 GBS	 went	 into	 receivership	 and	 all	 mining	 operations	 were	 placed	 in	 care	 and	
maintenance.	During	the	following	months	the	decision	was	made	to	offer	the	tenement	package	up	for	
tender.	The	 tender	process	was	subsequently	won	by	Crocodile	Gold	who	 finalized	 the	purchase	of	 the	
assets	in	November	2009.	Mining	activities	began	soon	after	the	finalization	of	the	purchase	agreement.	
	

6.2 	MAUD	CREEK	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
Hill	50	acquired	the	Maud	Creek	project	from	Phoenix	Mining	Ltd	in	March	2001.		
	
In	 late	 2001,	 Harmony	 Gold	 Company	 Ltd	 launched	 a	 takeover	 bid	 for	 Hill	 50	 and	 by	 mid‐2002	 had	
successfully	completed	the	acquisition	of	the	company	and	all	its	assets	including	Maud	Creek.		
	
In	 December	 2004,	 Terra	 Gold	Mining	 Ltd	 ("Terra")	 entered	 into	 an	 option	 agreement	 to	 acquire	 the	
project	from	Harmony.		
	
In	 August	 2005,	 GBS	 Gold	 Australia	 Pty	 Ltd,	 a	 wholly	 owned	 subsidiary	 of	 GBS	 Gold,	 announced	 its	
intention	to	acquire	all	of	the	issued	share	capital	of	Terra,	including	its	interest	in	the	Maud	Creek	Gold	
Project.	 	The	acquisition	was	completed	in	January	2006	and	the	100%	interest	was	transferred	to	GBS	
Gold.		
	

6.3 	MOLINE 	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
An	option	agreement	dated	30th	October	2003,	and	a	Deed	of	Variation	dated	12	November	2004	gave	
GBS	Gold	subsidiary	Terra	Gold	Mining	Limited	the	option	 to	prospect	and	explore	 for	minerals	on	the	
tenements	during	the	option	period.	
	
In	August	2005,	GBS	Gold	announced	its	intention	to	acquire	all	of	the	issued	share	capital	of	Terra	Gold	
Mining	 Ltd,	 including	 its	 interest	 in	 Moline.	 	 The	 acquisition	 was	 completed	 in	 January	 2006	 and	 the	
100%	interest	was	transferred	to	GBS	Gold.

6.4.1 	TOM'S	GULLY	DEPOSIT	

	
The	Tom's	Gully	deposit	was	discovered	by	Mt	Isa	Mines	("MIM")	Ltd	subsidiary	Carpentaria	Exploration	
Company	Pty	Ltd	("CEC")	in	1986	during	stream	sediment	sampling	as	part	of	a	regional	reconnaissance	
exploration	program.	Surface	sampling	of	an	outcropping	quartz	vein	confirmed	the	high	gold	grade	and	
led	to	the	commencement	of	an	extensive	drilling	program	in	1987	which	resulted	in	delineation	of	the	
resource.

An	 open	 cut	 mine	 was	 subsequently	 developed	 and	 operated	 by	 Carpentaria	 Gold	 Pty	 Ltd	 ("CGPL")	
between	1988	and	May	1991.	 	The	CGPL	open	cut	extended	 to	a	depth	of	90	m	and	reportedly	yielded	
100,000	ounces	of	gold	from	330,000	tonnes	grading	9.35	g/t	Au	with	a	strip	ratio	in	excess	of	40	to	1.	
CGPL	commenced	a	decline	to	access	ore	reserves	down	dip	beyond	the	open	pit	to	a	depth	15	m	below	
the	base	of	the	pit	but	the	decline	was	subsequently	abandoned	in	difficult	ground	conditions	associated	
with	the	Crabb	Fault	on	the	eastern	edge	of	the	orebody.	
	
In	 1992,	 CGPL	 sold	 the	 mine	 and	 associated	 leases	 to	 Esmeralda	 Exploration	 Ltd	 ("Esmeralda")	 who	
removed	the	services	from	the	previously	developed	decline	and	allowed	the	pit	to	flood.			
 
Kakadu	Resources	NL	 ("Kakadu")	 acquired	Tom's	Gully	 from	Esmeralda	and	built	 and	commissioned	 a	
plant	to	re‐treat	the	tailings.	The	plant	was	commissioned	in	May	1995,	and	it	is	estimated	that	Kakadu	
treated	 some	 65,000	 tonnes	 of	 tailings	 at	 an	 overall	 recovery	 of	 about	 35%.	 This	 is	 the	 original	 plant	
which	has	been	partially	refurbished	on	site.			
 
In	 1995,	 Kakadu	 was	 placed	 in	 administration	 until	 December	 1996,	 which	 after	 a	 seed	 capital	
fundraising	and	a	new	Board	of	Directors	and	management,	was	re‐listed	on	the	ASX	as	Sirocco	Resources	
N.L.	The	Company	subsequently	changed	its	name	to	Renison	Consolidated	Mines	NL	("Renison")	in	late	
2002.		
	
Following	a	period	of	exploration	at	Quest	29,	Renison	had	delineated	sufficient	resources	to	consider	the	
development	 of	 an	 open	 cut	 mining	 operation.	 In	 early	 1999,	 the	 company	 submitted	 a	 Public	
Environment	Report	("PER")	based	on	open	cut	mining	at	Quest	29.	Higher	grade	ore	was	to	be	treated	at	
the	Tom's	Gully	treatment	plant	and	lower	grade	ore	at	a	to‐be‐constructed	dump	leach	facility	at	Quest	
29.		
 
Following	approval	of	the	PER,	the	company	added	a	crushing	circuit,	re‐commissioned	the	Tom's	Gully	
treatment	plant	and	commenced	mining	at	Quest	29	in	the	latter	part	of	1999.	Approximately	450,000t	of	
ore	was	mined	and	treated	at	either	the	Tom's	Gully	treatment	plant	or	the	Quest	29	dump	leach	facility.			
	
In	 2003	 and	 2004,	 Renison	 carried	 out	 extensive	 drilling	 to	 delineate	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 deposit	 down	
plunge	of	the	existing	open	pit	limits	allowing	a	substantial	resource	upgrade	to	be	defined.	This	formed	
the	basis	for	a	feasibility	study,	which	was	carried	out	in	2004	to	assess	the	viability	of	an	underground	
mining	operation	at	the	deposit.		
 
As	a	result	of	a	positive	outcome	from	the	study,	Renison	committed	to	the	development	of	the	project	in	
2005.	 The	 project	 development	 included	 upgrading	 of	 the	 on‐site	 treatment	 plant	 and	 a	 substantial	
underground	mining	operation.	Underground	mining	by	Renison	 for	 the	period	ending	31	March	2007	
produced	 63,300	 tonnes	 grading	 3.7	 g/t	 Au,	 at	 which	 point	 the	 operation	 was	 placed	 on	 care	 and	
maintenance.		
 
GBS	 Gold,	 through	 certain	 subsidiaries,	 acquired	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 Gold	 Project	 on	 25	 July	 2007	 from	
Renison.	 GBS	 Gold	 completed	 a	 feasibility	 study	 on	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 deposit	 in	 December	 2007	which	
supported	a	planned	35,000oz	gold	per	annum	for	3.5	years	at	a	grade	of	7.1g/t	Au	(Gerritsen,	2007).	GBS	
commenced	 underground	 mining	 operations	 in	 July	 2008	 but	 only	 minimal	 mine	 development	 was	
completed	 before	 mining	 was	 suspended	 in	 September	 2008	 following	 the	 company	 being	 placed	 in	
administration.	Total	gold	production	for	the	September	2008	quarter	is	reported	as	3,679oz	from	26,835	
tonnes	mined,	average	grade	4.36g/t	Au.

6.4.2 MOUNT	BUNDY	DEPOSIT	(RUSTLERS	ROOST)	

	
The	majority	of	the	drilling	carried	out	at	the	Rustlers	Roost	project	was	completed	prior	to	1997	
by	Valdora	Minerals	NL	(Valdora).	Limited	information	on	the	drilling	programs	was	recorded	in	Rabone	
1995,	and	1996.	Programs	of	RC	and	core	drilling	were	completed	by	VVI	in	2003.	These	comprised	6	RC	
and	3	core	holes	for	a	total	of	2,828m.	Full	details	of	the	holes	are	recorded	in	Goulevitch	2003	and	
Exploremin	2004a.	
	
The	full	database	contains	records	for	883	drill	holes,	however	the	method	of	drilling	(i.e.	diamond	core	or	
RC	etc.)	is	not	immediately	apparent	from	the	database.	A	total	of	63,617m	of	drilling	is	represented	in	the	
database.	
	
The	reported	resource	utilized	data	from	402	drill	holes	for	39,855m.	
	

6.5 	EXPLORATION	&	MINING	HISTORY	

	
Given	the	lengthy	historical	period	of	exploration	and	mining	which	has	occurred	within	the	Tom's	Gully	
Gold	Project	 and	 the	Burnside	Gold	&	Base	Metals	 Project	 areas,	 for	 gold,	 uranium	and	base	metals,	 a	
discussion	of	the	exploration	history	cannot	be	separated	from	the	contemporaneous	mining	activity.		
	

6.6 	BURNSIDE 	GOLD 	&	BASE 	METALS 	PROJECT		

	
Although	exploration	and	mining	within	the	Pine	Creek/Burnside	region	has	a	history	of	over	100	years,	
modern	exploration	which	led	to	the	most	significant	phase	of	mining	in	the	region	commenced	during	
the	mid‐1980's.	
	
The	 fragmental	 ownership	 history	 of	 the	 tenements	 and	 frequently	 incomplete	 exploration	 and	
production	records	make	compilation	of	detailed	statistics	difficult.	Nevertheless,	it	is	believed	that	over	
750,000	meters	of	drilling	has	occurred	within	the	project	areas	and	a	minimum	of	3	million	ounces	of	
gold	has	been	produced.	Portions	of	the	following	summary	are	taken	from	McKibben	et	al	(2008).

6.7 	BROCKS	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
Gold	was	discovered	at	Brocks	Creek	in	1871	and	at	Cosmo	Howley	in	1873	during	the	construction	of	the	
Adelaide	–	Darwin	overland	telegraph	line.	This	was	the	prelude	to	a	long	period	of	alluvial	working	by	
Chinese	miners	and	lode	mining	by	English	companies	and	Chinese	tribute	miners	until	1914.		
	
Balfour	(1981)	estimates	that	approximately	1,028	kg	of	gold	was	produced	from	the	Brocks	Creek	line	of	
workings	from	discovery	to	1914,		with	some	823	kg	produced	from	high	grade	gold	reefs	at	Zapopan;	the	
name	Brocks	Creek	and	Zapopan	seem	to	have	been	used	interchangeably	in	the	early	years.			Blanchard	
and	Hall	(1937)	estimate	that	about	71,000	t	of	ore	was	mined	along	the	Howley	Line	during	this	period,	
producing	about	24,000	oz	of	gold	at	a	recovered	grade	of	about	10	g/t	Au.

The	field	subsequently	declined	in	the	mid‐1910s	and	there	was	little	activity	in	the	area	for	the	next	60	
years	apart	from	limited	small	scale	mining	and	minor	exploration.		The	Brocks	Creek	and	Howley	areas	
were	explored	for	gold	and	base	metals	during	the	1970s	and	1980s	by	numerous	mining	and	exploration	
companies,	often	in	joint	venture.		Most	of	these	companies	carried	out	extensive	drill	testing	of	various	
costean	(trench)	intercepts,	IP	geophysical	and	soil	geochemical	anomalies	with	mixed	results.			
	
In	1975,	Dampier	Mining	acquired	an	exploration	license	over	the	Howley	line,	and	under	a	joint	venture	
with	Dampier	Mining,	Homestake	Gold	Mining	conducted	the	first	major	assessment	in	1977	to	1978.		
	
Zapopan	NL	commenced	working	the	alluvial	deposits	in	the	Fountain	Head	area	in	1985	and	ceased	in	
1989,	 recovering	more	 than	 10,104	 oz	 of	 gold	 from	 825,187m3.	 	 Dominion	Mining	 Ltd	 purchased	 the	
Fountain	Head	tenements	from	Zapopan	in	1993,	and	excavated	a	small	trial	pit.		
	
Several	 small	alluvial	 shows	 in	 the	Chinese	Howley	area	were	mined	between	1986	and	1990.	 	Mining	
operations	commenced	at	Cosmo	Howley	in	1987	with	gold‐bearing	ore	mined	from	the	Cosmo	Howley,	
Phantom,	Chinese	South,	Chinese	Howley	and	Big	Howley	pits.		All	mining	ceased	prior	to	April	1995.

TABLE	6‐4	ESTIMATED	HISTORICAL	GOLD	PRODUCTION.	BURNSIDE	GOLD	PROJECT	

NB:	After	McKibben	et	al,	2008;	Based	on	Dominion	and	Anglo	Gold	annual,	operating	and	closure	reports	
	

Northern	Gold	commenced	exploration	in	the	Burnside	area	in	1996	and	carried	out	several	exploration	
programs	 comprising	 geophysical	 surveys,	 soil/rock	 chip	 sampling,	 trenching,	 rotary	 air‐blast	 (RAB),	
reverse	circulation	(RC)	and	diamond	drilling,	resource	modeling	and	estimates.			
	
During	2002,	exploration	activities	focused	on	compilation	and	validation	of	data	in	relation	to	the	Cosmo	
Deeps	 underground	 resource	 and	 the	 re‐evaluation	 and	 reassessment	 of	 the	 near	 surface	 resources	 at	
Howley,	Western	Arm	and	Yam	Creek.	 	Acquisition	of	 detailed	 airborne	magnetic	 geophysical,	 Landsat	
and	SPOT	remote	sensing	and	GIS	topographic	data	provided	the	basis	for	a	structural	interpretation	and	
targeting	 definition	 over	 the	 Brocks	 Creek/Zapopan,	 Yam	 Creek	 and	 Woolwonga	 areas.	 	 Infill	 and	
extensional	 resource	 definition	 drilling	 at	 Brocks	 Creek/Zapopan,	 the	 commencement	 of	 the	 Brocks	
Creek/Zapopan	underground	decline,	 resource	modeling	of	 the	Cosmo	Deeps	mineralization	and	 initial	
Scoping	Studies	on	the	Cosmo	Deeps	underground	resource	were	all	undertaken.	
	
In	March	2003,	pre‐production	activities	within	 the	Burnside	Gold	Project	were	postponed,	pending	an	
improvement	in	the	gold	price	and	the	decline	into	the	Brocks	Creek/Zapopan	underground	deposit	was	
suspended	 at	 a	 vertical	 depth	 of	 approximately	 125	 m	 below	 surface.	 	 Activities	 completed	 in	 2003	
included	 an	 underground	RC/diamond	 drilling	 program	 at	 Brocks	 Creek/Zapopan,	 the	 redesign	 of	 the	
underground	 mine	 and	 the	 calculation	 of	 a	 new	 resource	 estimate.	 	 An	 RC	 drilling	 program	 of	 six

drillholes,	 undertaken	 to	 test	 the	 southern	 extensions	 to	 the	 Woolwonga	 open	 pit	 mineralization,	
intersected	narrow	widths	of	low	to	high	grade	gold	mineralization	at	shallow	depths.	
	
In	 2004,	 further	 underground	 and	 surface	 infill	 drilling	 of	 the	 Main	 and	 Central	 Lodes	 at	 Brocks	
Creek/Zapopan	was	 completed.	 	 Infill	 drilling	was	 undertaken	 to	 define	 high	 grade	mineralized	 zones	
within	the	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit	and	a	Scoping	Study	into	the	potential	for	Cosmo	Deeps	to	be	mined	as	
an	 underground	 gold	 operation	 was	 initiated.	 	 	 RC	 resource	 definition	 drilling	 was	 completed	 at	 the	
Fountain	Head	deposit	to	confirm	the	modeled	geology	and	to	infill	existing	resource	areas.			
	
In	early	2005,	 further	resource	definition	drilling	of	eight	RC/diamond	drillholes	was	completed	at	 the	
Cosmo	Deeps	deposit	with	the	aim	of	infilling	the	upper	levels	of	the	deposit	to	bring	the	resource	to	ore.		
Samples	from	the	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit	were	sent	for	metallurgical	test	work	at	Ammtec	Laboratories	in	
Perth,	Western	Australia.		This	test	work	demonstrated	that	the	Cosmo	Deeps	mineralization	is	amenable	
to	good	recoveries	through	the	Union	Reefs	processing	facility.		
	
Since	late‐2005,	past	operators	carried	out	exploration	and	resource	definition	drilling	programs	which	
have	led	to	the	updating	of	several	resource	models	and	optimized	mine	designs.		These	programs	were	
mainly	 focused	 on	 prospects	 within	 the	 western	 and	 southern	 portions	 of	 the	 Burnside	 project,	
principally	along	the	Howley	and	Brocks	Creek‐Zapopan	Anticlines.	
	
Following	initial	mining	and	pre‐stripping	activities,	production	mining	commenced	at	the	Fountain	Head	
and	Rising	Tide	open	pit	mines	and	the	Brocks	Creek	underground	mine	with	the	first	ore	deliveries	from	
these	mines	to	the	Union	Reefs	plant	occurring	in	October	2006.	
	
Brocks	Creek	underground	workings	are	accessed	by	a	footwall	placed	decline	(4.5m	x	4.5m)	descending	
at	a	1:7	ratio	with	the	access	portal	being	developed	from	the	shallow	historical	open	pit.	The	base	of	the	
decline	 is	 currently	 at	 the	 640Level,	 approximately	 570m	 vertical	 depth.	 Mechanized	 uphole	 retreat	
stoping	was	the	mining	method	utilized	by	GBS	Gold,	with	20m	sublevels	and	15m	vertical	stopes.	Prior	
to	suspension	of	mining	 in	September	2008,	monthly	production	was	at	an	annualized	rate	of	120,000‐
140,000tpa.		
	
Open	pit	mining	at	the	Rising	Tide	Deposit	was	suspended	in	October	2007	(2007	Production:	672,632t	
waste,	278,356t	ore	@	1.44g/t	Au	for	12,724	oz	Au).	Mining	at	the	Fountain	Head	Deposit	continued	until	
cessation	of	mining	in	August	2008,	with	2008	production	of	1,090,399t	waste,	470,127t	ore	@	1.68g/t	
Au	for	25,453oz	Au.	

	

6.8 	 UNION 	REEFS	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
Gold	 was	 discovered	 by	 prospectors	 at	 Union	 Reefs	 in	 December	 1873	 and	 since	 then	 approximately	
1,600	pits,	shafts,	adits	and	open	cuts	have	been	worked	to	a	depth	of	approximately	60	m	(Shields	et	al,	
1967).	 	Most	of	the	claims	were	held	by	Chinese	miners	until	1894.	 	Much	of	the	gold	recovered	during	
this	time	was	not	recorded	but	data	 for	the	period	1884	to	1910	show	production	of	48,000	oz	of	gold	
from	58,000	t	of	ore	for	a	recovered	grade	of	26	g/t	Au	(Hossfeld,	1936).		Very	little	work	other	than	small	
scale	mining	and	exploration	was	conducted	over	the	next	50	years.	
	
Drilling	during	the	1960s	by	the	Bureau	of	Mineral	Resources	identified	a	gold	resource	at	Crosscourse.	
This	was	followed	by	further	drilling	in	1969	and	1970	at	the	Crosscourse	and	Lady	Alice	North	deposits.		
Between	1984	and	1988,	25	exploration	holes	were	drilled	at	Ping	Ques	and	Crosscourse	deposits	which	
gave	encouraging	results	and	led	to	a	resource	estimate.		In	1988,	68	percussion	holes	were	drilled	along

	 	 Australia	

[72]	
	

the	northern	half	of	the	Union	and	Lady	Alice	 lines	of	mineralization.	 	No	further	work	was	carried	out	
until	1991	when	detailed	soil	sampling,	geophysical	surveying	and	percussion	and	diamond	drilling	was	
carried	out	within	the	Union	Reefs	leases.		By	1994	a	resource	had	been	defined	at	Crosscourse	and	Union	
North	that	led	to	the	completion	of	a	detailed	feasibility	study,	open	cut	mining	and	the	construction	of	a	
1.7	Mtpa	CIL	processing	plant.	
	
In	1997,	Union	Reefs	was	expanded	to	process	harder	fresh	rock	and	increase	throughput	to	2.5	Mtpa	and	
gold	production	from	87,000	to	120,000	oz	per	annum.		The	expansion	included	adding	two	leach	tanks	
and	 a	 tertiary	 crusher.	 	 Mine	 production	 was	 primarily	 from	 the	 Crosscourse,	 Union	 North,	 Prospect	
Claim,	Lady	Alice	and	Ping	Ques	deposits.	
	
In	1998,	exploration	drilling	 to	 the	north	of	 the	Crosscourse	open	pit	 identified	shallow	mineralization	
over	a	1.2	km	strike	length.	 	As	drilling	continued	in	this	area,	several	shallow	and	continuous	zones	of	
mineralization	 varying	 from	 5	 to	 15	m	 in	width	were	 defined	 over	 a	 700	m	 strike	 length	 at	 Alta	 and	
Orinoco.		A	new	mineralized	zone,	Dam	A,	was	identified	400	m	northeast	of	Union	North	and	extended	
for	more	than	300	m.		In	late	1998	and	early	1999,	head	grades	declined	as	mining	progressed	in	lower	
grade	areas	on	the	eastern	margins	of	the	Crosscourse	pit	and	at	Union	North.	
	
By	 2003,	 mining	 at	 the	 project	 was	 moving	 towards	 its	 final	 stages	 and	 was	 directed	 towards	 small,	
dispersed	remnant	resources	in	proximity	to	the	plant.		Total	gold	production	from	the	commencement	of	
operations	at	Union	Reefs	in	1994	to	June,	2003	was	estimated	by	AngloGold	to	be	879,824	oz.	
	
Union	 Reefs	 Operations	 Centre	 was	 opened	 in	 	 November,	 2006.	 Gold	 production	 commenced	 in	 late	
2006	with	 ore	 being	 sourced	 from	historical	 stockpiles,	 the	Brocks	 Creek/Zapopan	 underground	mine	
and	the	Rising	Tide	and	Fountain	Head	open	pit	mines.		The	Fountain	Head	mine	has	extracted	ore	from	
both	the	Fountain	Head	and	the	Tally	Ho	lodes.		Total	production	from	the	Union	Reefs	operations	until	
31	December	2007	was	1,084,000t	at	an	average	head	grade	of	2.43	g/t	Au	producing	80,092	oz	Au.	

6.9 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
Gold	was	 also	 discovered	 at	 Pine	 Creek	 during	 the	 construction	 of	 the	 Overland	 Telegraph	 in	 the	 late	
1860s.		However,	no	official	records	of	gold	production	were	kept	prior	to	1894.		Records	from	that	date	
until	 1915	 indicate	 production	 of	 2,300	 kg	 of	 gold	 from	 121,000	 t	 of	 ore	 (Hossfeld,	 1936).	 The	 field	
declined	 in	 the	 early	 1900s	 and	 there	was	 little	 activity	 in	 the	 area	 for	 the	 next	 80	 years	 apart	 from	
limited	small	scale	mining	and	some	government	assisted	exploration.			
	
Between	1906	and	1915,	eleven	government	sponsored	diamond	drillholes	were	collared.	Between	1916	
and	 1934	 only	 sporadic	 exploration	 work	 was	 carried	 out.	 	 Further	 investigation	 of	 the	 field	 was	
undertaken	in	1936	as	part	of	the	Aerial	Geological	and	Geophysical	Survey	of	Northern	Australia.		Some	
geophysical	 anomalies	 were	 located	 at	 that	 time;	 however	 no	 follow	 up	 work	 appears	 to	 have	 been	
carried	out.	
	
The	Enterprise	underground	was	reopened	in	the	early	1960s	and	was	worked	intermittently	for	almost	
two	decades.			
	
Modern	 exploration	 and	mine	 definition	 drilling	 of	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 gold	 field	 commenced	 in	 the	 early	
1980s	when	Goldfields	Exploration	Pty	Ltd	("Goldfields")	explored	for	gold	on	several	mining	tenements	
at	Pine	Creek,	under	a	joint	venture	with	title	holders,	Enterprise	Mines	NL	("Enterprise	Mines").		A	total

of	124	diamond	holes	for	12,187m	and	27	percussion	holes	totaling	1,045m	were	completed	during	1982	
to	outline	the	Enterprise	deposit.			
	
In	1984,	Goldfields	and	Enterprise	Mines	established	Pine	Creek	Goldfields	Ltd	 to	develop	and	manage	
the	mining	operations	based	on	the	Enterprise	deposit.		Mining	commenced	at	the	Enterprise	deposit	in	
October	1985	and	ceased	in	January	1993.				
		
There	are	no	available	records	dealing	with	historical	mining,	previous	gold	exploration	and	drilling	on	
the	Gandy's	Hill	prospect	prior	to	1983.		Between	1980	and	1994,	two	adits,	one	63m	and	the	other	25m	
long	were	driven	under	 the	east	side	of	Gandy's	Hill	some	20m	below	the	hill	crest.	 	Surface	rock	chip,	
dump	 sampling,	 an	 induced	 polarization	 geophysical	 survey	 and	 mapping	 was	 also	 completed	 at	 the	
Gandy's	prospect	followed	by	15	reverse	circulation	("RC")	holes	for	1,163m.		Between	1987	and	1989,	a	
number	 of	 RC	 drill	 programs	 were	 completed	 at	 Gandy's	 Hill	 and	 International	 prospects,	 totaling	
8,932.1m	and	8,581m	respectively.	 	The	North	Gandy's,	South	Gandy's	and	 International	deposits	were	
mined	 by	 open	 pit	 methods	 commencing	 in	 mid‐1993.	 Mining	 was	 completed	 at	 North	 Gandy's	 in	
November	1993	and	at	the	other	deposits	in	1994.		Mining	ceased	at	Pine	Creek	in	November	1994	when	
the	last	truckload	of	ore	was	hauled	from	the	South	Gandy's	pit.

6.10 	MAUD	CREEK	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
Interest	in	the	Maud	Creek	area	was	rekindled	in	the	1960s	during	an	assessment	of	the	mineral	potential	
of	 the	 Top	 End	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory.	 	 This	 study	 was	 prompted	 by	 the	 discovery	 of	 significant	
uranium	mineralization	in	the	nearby	South	Alligator	River	valley	in	the	mid‐1950s.		
	
The	Maud	Creek	project	was	owned	by	a	number	of	companies	until	the	acquisition	of	the	project	by	GBS	
Gold	in	December	2006.			Substantial	drilling,	between	66,000‐90,000	meters	of	RC	and	diamond	drilling,	
is	reported	on	the	project	area	between	1966	–	2006,	oriented	toward	gold	exploration.	
	
Between	 1966	 and	 1973	 several	 companies	 including	 Western	 Nuclear	 Australia	 and	 Magnum	
Exploration	NL	explored	the	area	for	copper,	gold	and	uranium.		IP	surveys	and	drilling	of	siliceous	and	
gossanous	 breccias	 intersected	 low,	 albeit	 anomalous,	 concentrations	 of	 copper	 and	molybdenum	 and	
numerous	pyritic	zones.			
	
The	 Northern	 Territory	 Geological	 Survey	 carried	 out	 IP	 surveys,	 soil	 sampling	 and	 petrographic	
investigations	in	the	late	1970s	as	part	of	an	assessment	of	an	extension	to	the	nearby	Katherine	Gorge	
National	Park.			
	
Magnum	Exploration	NL	explored	the	breccia	as	part	of	a	copper‐uranium	search,	drilling	seven	holes	and	
encountering	pyritic	material	with	 low	copper	values.	They	also	dug	 trenches	and	obtained	anomalous	
copper	and	molybdenum	values	but	did	not	assay	for	gold.		
	
During	1985	and	1986,	CSR	Limited	("CSR")	explored	the	area	in	attempt	to	locate	gold	mineralization	in	
the	 Lower	 Proterozoic	 dolerites.	 Work	 included	 airborne	 magnetic	 and	 radiometric	 surveys,	 stream	
sediment	sampling,	soil	sampling,	rock	chip	sampling,	petrographic	sampling	and	trenching.	
	
Placer	Exploration	subsequently	purchased	all	of	CSR's	Australian	mineral	assets	and	during	1989‐1990	
conducted	soil	and	rock	chip	sampling	and	initiated	the	first	drilling	of	the	Main	Zone	gold	mineralization	
at	Maud	Creek.		Additional	drilling	was	conducted	during	1990.		
	
Between	 1993	 and	 1997,	 Kalmet	 Resources	 NL	 ("Kalmet")	 completed	 a	 series	 of	 drilling	 programs	 at	
Maud	Creek.	Metallurgical	 testing	 of	 five	 high‐grade	RC	 samples	was	 completed	 and	 an	 environmental	
impact	 study	 was	 commissioned.	 	 Metallurgical	 studies	 showed	 the	 primary	 gold‐bearing	 sulphide	
mineralization	was	refractory	in	nature	and	bio‐oxidation	tests	were	initiated.	
	
In	 1997,	 Kilkenny	 Gold	 NL	 acquired	 Kalmet	 and	 undertook	 RC	 and	 diamond	 drilling.	 Further	
metallurgical	test	work	was	completed	including	pilot	scale	flotation	and	bio‐oxidation	program.	In	1998,	
Signet	Engineering	completed	a	full	feasibility	study	for	the	extraction	and	processing	of	oxide,	transition	
and	 primary	 ore	 from	 Maud	 Creek.	 	 A	 comprehensive	 draft	 Environmental	 Impact	 Study	 was	 also	
produced.	
	
AngloGold	acquired	rights	to	mine	the	oxide	zone	of	the	Main	Zone	deposit	at	Maud	Creek	and	treat	the	
ore	at	the	Union	Reefs	plant.	Mining	operations	were	conducted	during	2000.		
	
ASX‐listed	gold	producer	Hill	50	Gold	NL	acquired	the	Maud	Creek	project	in	March	2001	and	conducted	
an	 extensive	 review	 of	 previous	 exploration,	which	 identified	 five	 gold	 targets	within	 the	 property.	 	 A	
program	 of	 rock	 chip	 sampling	was	 conducted	 at	 the	 Runways	 prospect.	 	 Additional	 RC	 and	 diamond	
drilling	was	completed	at	Maud	Creek	and	surrounding	prospects.

In	December,	 2004,	 and	 prior	 to	 being	 acquired	 by	 GBS	 Australia,	 Terra	 Gold	Mining	 Pty	 Ltd	 ("TGM")	
purchased	an	option	to	acquire	the	Maud	Creek	project	from	Hill	50	which	by	that	time	had	been	acquired	
by	Harmony	Gold.	 	 In	 January	 2005,	 TGM	drilled	 a	 single	 combined	 percussion‐diamond	hole	 into	 the	
mineralized	 Main	 Zone	 to	 supply	 a	 limited	 quantity	 of	 sample	 for	 metallurgical	 test	 work	 purposes.		
Following	a	preliminary	due	diligence	examination,	in	May	2005	TGM	exercised	its	option	to	purchase	the	
Maud	Creek	project.		
	
In	2005,	four	holes	totaling	711	meters	consisting	of	406	meters	of	RC	pre‐collar	and	305	meters	of	HQ3	
diamond	drill	core	were	completed.		These	holes	were	designed	primarily	to	provide	additional	samples	
for	metallurgical	test	work.		
	
No	exploration	has	been	 conducted	by	Crocodile	Gold	 at	Maud	Creek.	The	only	mining	activity	 to	 take	
place	on	the	project	occurred	in	2000	when	the	oxide	cap	of	the	Main	Zone	was	mined	and	toll	 treated	
through	the	Union	Reefs	plant.	
	

6.11 	MOUNT 	BUNDY	GOLD	PROJECT	

	

6.11.1 	TOM'S	GULLY	DEPOSIT	

	
Initial	exploration	at	the	property	that	led	to	the	discovery	of	the	Tom's	Gully	deposit	was	carried	out	by	
Carpentaria	Exploration	Company	(CEC),	a	subsidiary	of	Mt	Isa	Mines	Pty	Ltd.	It	is	reported	that	stream	
sediment	 sampling	 in	 1986,	 as	 part	 of	 a	 regional	 reconnaissance	 exploration	 program,	 led	 to	 the	
discovery	of	an	outcropping	quartz	vein.	Surface	sampling	of	the	vein	confirmed	the	high	gold	grade	and	
led	to	the	commencement	of	an	extensive	drilling	program	in	1987.	
 
Geophysical	exploration	at	 the	project	has	been	 limited.	CEC	 is	 reported	 to	have	 tried	a	seismic	survey	
after	 commencement	 of	 open	 pit	 mining.	 Renison	 carried	 out	 an	 aeromagnetic	 survey	 as	 part	 of	 a	
government	program	in	2000,	but	the	results	were	not	considered	useful.	Renison	also	attempted	a	sub	
audio	magnetic	 (SAM)	survey	 in	2005.	Renison	reported	 that	some	 interesting	 features	were	 identified	
which	warranted	 follow	up	work.	 Initial	drilling	commenced	 in	April	1987	using	open	hole	percussion,	
reverse	circulation	and	diamond	core	drilling	methods.	Later	drilling	was	 limited	to	reverse	circulation	
and	diamond	core	methods	only.		
	
Exploration	and	resource	definition	drilling	at	Tom's	Gully	has	been	performed	during	the	management	
of	 CEC,	 Kakadu,	 Sirocco	 and	 Renison.	 The	 types	 of	 drilling	 were	 Percussion	 (open	 hole),	 Reverse	
Circulation	(RC)	and	Diamond	Core	(DD).	All	holes	were	drilled	from	surface	and	the	maximum	depth	of	
drilling	is	340m.		
	
Mining	at	Tom's	Gully	has	also	occurred	over	several	periods.		
	
An	open	cut	mine	was	developed	and	operated	by	Carpentaria	Gold	Pty	Ltd	("CGPL")	between	1988	and	
May	1991.		The	CGPL	open	cut	extended	to	a	depth	of	90	m	and	reportedly	yielded	100,000	ounces	of	gold	
from	 330,000	 tonnes	 grading	 9.35	 g/t	 Au	with	 a	 strip	 ratio	 in	 excess	 of	 40	 to	 1.	 CGPL	 commenced	 a	
decline	to	access	ore	reserves	down	dip	beyond	the	open	pit	to	a	depth	15	m	below	the	base	of	the	pit	but

the	decline	was	subsequently	abandoned	in	difficult	ground	conditions	associated	with	the	Crabb	Fault	on	
the	eastern	edge	of	the	orebody.	
	
In	 1992,	 CGPL	 sold	 the	 mine	 and	 associated	 leases	 to	 Esmeralda	 Exploration	 Ltd	 ("Esmeralda")	 who	
removed	the	services	from	the	previously	developed	decline	and	allowed	the	pit	to	flood.			
	
Kakadu	Resources	NL	 ("Kakadu")	 acquired	Tom's	Gully	 from	Esmeralda	and	built	 and	commissioned	 a	
plant	 in	May	 1995	 to	 re‐treat	 the	 tailings.	 It	 is	 estimated	 that	 Kakadu	 treated	 some	 65,000	 tonnes	 of	
tailings	at	an	overall	recovery	of	about	35%.		
	
Renison	 added	 a	 crushing	 circuit,	 re‐commissioned	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 treatment	 plant	 and	 commenced	
mining	at	Quest	29	in	the	latter	part	of	1999.	Approximately	450,000t	of	ore	was	mined	and	treated	at	
either	the	Tom's	Gully	treatment	plant	or	the	Quest	29	dump	leach	facility.			
	
In	 2003	 and	 2004,	 Renison	 carried	 out	 extensive	 drilling	 to	 delineate	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 deposit	 down	
plunge	of	the	existing	open	pit	limits	allowing	a	substantial	resource	upgrade	to	be	defined.	This	formed	
the	basis	for	a	feasibility	study,	which	was	carried	out	in	2004	to	assess	the	viability	of	an	underground	
mining	operation	at	the	deposit.		
	
As	a	result	of	a	positive	outcome	from	the	study,	Renison	committed	to	the	development	of	the	project	in	
2005.	 The	 project	 development	 included	 upgrading	 of	 the	 on‐site	 treatment	 plant	 and	 a	 substantial	
underground	mining	 operation.	 Underground	mining	 by	 Renison	 to	 the	 end	 of	 March	 2007	 produced	
63,300	tonnes	grading	3.7	g/t	Au,	at	which	point	the	operation	was	placed	on	care	and	maintenance.		
 
GBS	 Gold	 through	 certain	 subsidiaries	 acquired	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 Gold	 Project	 on	 25	 July	 2007	 from	
Renison.	 They	 completed	 a	 feasibility	 study	 on	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 deposit	 in	 December	 2007	 which	
supported	a	planned	35,000oz	gold	per	annum	for	3.5	years	at	a	grade	of	7.1g/t	Au	(Gerritsen,	2007).	GBS	
commenced	 underground	 mining	 operations	 in	 July	 2008	 but	 only	 minimal	 mine	 development	 was	
completed	 before	 mining	 was	 suspended	 in	 September	 2008	 following	 the	 company	 being	 placed	 in	
administration.		
	
During	2010,	development	recommenced	at	the	Tom's	Gully	mine,	during	the	same	period	work	began	on	
refurbishing	 the	mill	 to	 prepare	 for	 ore	 extraction	 from	 the	 underground	 operations.	 However,	 due	 to	
operational	 decisions,	 development	 at	 Tom's	 Gully	 was	 put	 on	 hold	 in	 August	 2010.	 Some	mineralized	
material	 had	 been	 removed	 during	 the	 development	 process,	 but	 a	 combination	 of	 face	 sample,	
underground	mapping	 and	 truck	 sampling	 suggested	more	 time	 and	 emphasis	 should	 be	 placed	 on	 ore	
extraction.	A	review	of	the	Tom's	Gully	resource	model	was	also	undertaken	in	late	2010	which	highlighted	
the	issues	with	mining	and	ore	extraction.	
	

6.11.2 	RUSTLERS	ROOST	

	
A	shallow	open	pit	was	excavated	at	the	Rustlers	Roost	deposit	to	a	depth	of	approximately	40‐	50m.	Oxide	
resources	of	4.71MT	at	1.05g/t	Au	(VVI,	2004)	were	mined	and	heap‐leach	treated	by	RRMPL	between	
1994‐1998	for	a	return	of	113,000	ounces	of	gold	(estimated	70%	recovery).	Plans	to	develop	the	primary	
resource	were	suspended	in	1997.	
	
The	ResEval	resource	model	was	completed	for	the	full	extent	of	the	deposit.	This	allowed	the	mined	
portion	of	the	deposit	to	be	obtained	by	intersection	the	model	with	the	final	pit	survey.	The	mineralization

6.12 	MOLINE 	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
Gold	was	discovered	in	the	Moline	area	by	Chinese	miners	in	1882	with	subsequent	mining	continuing	on	
an	intermittent	basis	until	1957.		There	are	discontinuous	workings	down	to	90	m	below	surface	and	an	
exploration	 drive	 at	 the	 120	m	 level.	 	 Historical	 stopes	 were	 generally	 less	 than	 2	 m	wide	 and	 were	
centered	on	narrow	high	grade	quartz‐pyrite	vein	mineralization.			Underground	mining	of	the	high‐grade	
(31g/t	Au)	oxidized	mineralization	continued	until	1957	produced	35,768oz	Au.	
	
Modern	 exploration	 for	 gold	 and	 base	metal	mineralization	within	 the	Moline	 area	 commenced	 in	 the	
early	1980s,	which	 led	 to	 the	definition	of	 three	main	mineralized	 trends;	namely	 the	Hercules,	Moline	
and	Tumbling	Dice	trends.		The	main	open	pits	of	Hercules,	School,	Moline	and	Tumbling	Dice,	along	with	
several	 smaller	 satellite	 pits,	 which	 were	 in	 operation	 from	 1989	 to	 1992,	 occur	 within	 MLN1059	 at	
Moline.	 The	main	pits	 of	Northern	Hercules	 and	Moline	produced	 the	 bulk	of	 the	ore	 and	were	mined	
down	 to	 the	 top	of	 the	sulphide	zone	 (60	 to	70	m	below	surface).	 	 Substantial	mineralization	was	also	
extracted	 from	 the	 School,	 Four	 and	 Tumbling	 Dice	 open	 pits	 and	 from	 16	 other	 small,	 shallow	 pits	
confined	to	the	oxidized	zone.			
	
Re‐treatment	of	tailings	in	1987	and	open	cut	mining	by	Moline	Mine	Management	Pty	Ltd	from	1988	to	
1991	recovered	a	 further	38,257oz	Au.	 	Metallurgical	problems	 in	 treating	 the	part‐oxidized	refractory	
gold	 mineralization	 were	 the	 main	 factor	 in	 the	 mining	 operation	 being	 closed	 down	 in	 1992.	 	 A	
metallurgist	 is	 noted	 to	 have	 evaluated	 the	 metallurgical	 problems	 and	 made	 proposals	 to	 improve	
recoveries	associated	with	non‐oxidized	mineralization.	
	
Since	the	cessation	of	mining	in	1992,	a	number	of	companies	have	carried	out	exploration	under	option	
within	the	project	area.		Exploration	activities	undertaken	since	this	time	included	deep	drilling	beneath	
the	Moline	and	tumbling	Dice	pits	and	geochemical	surveys	and	preliminary	RC	drilling	of	anomalies.			
	
Moline	Mine	Management	put	 out	 a	 statement	 of	 reserves	 and	 resources	 in	 early	 1992	 just	 before	 the	
cessation	of	operations.	There	is	no	supporting	documentation	for	these	reserves	and	resources	and	are	
thus	deemed	historical	in	nature.	Crocodile	Gold	cannot	rely	on	them	and	they	cannot	be	incorporated	in	
any	reserve/resource	statement.		
	
The	historical	reserves	and	resources	include:	
	
Proven	and	probable	mineable	reserves		 ‐	313,000	tonnes	grading	2.54	g/t	–	25,263	oz	
Indicated	resources	 	 	 	 	 	 ‐	308,000	tonnes	grading	2.71	g/t	–	26,839	oz	
	
These	estimates	require	verification	before	they	can	be	accepted	as	NI43‐101	compliant.

In	2007	past	operators	undertook	 regional	 soil	 sampling	programs	over	 three	areas	within	 the	Moline	
project	area.		The	program	over	the	southern	strike	extensions	of	the	Moline	group	of	mines	defined	an	8	
km	long	by	1	km	wide	anomalous	gold	zone.		Limited	drilling	by	GBS	Gold	is	reported	late	in	2006,	in	the	
vicinity	of	the	North	Hercules	pit	and	near	the	High	Chinese	prospect.	Detailed	drill	results	have	not	been	
sighted	but	are	reported	to	be	"disappointing",	with	one	geologist	recommending	no	further	work	on	the	
property.	 It	 is	 unclear	 if	 any	 of	 this	 drilling	 actually	 tested	 the	 large	 gold	 in	 soil	 geochemical	 anomaly	
reported	separately.	
	
Several	 holes	 have	 been	 drilled	 in	 and	 around	 the	Moline	 project,	 these	 holes	 remaine	 in	 storage	 for	
Crocodile	Gold's	use.	It	is	planned	in	early	2011	to	sample	this	core	for	metallurgical	testing.

7 GEOLOGICAL 	SETTING 	

	

The	 Precambrian	 rocks	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 have	 been	 subdivided	 into	 two	 principal	 orogenic	
provinces:	 the	North	Australian	Craton;	 and,	 the	Central	Australian	Mobile	Belt	 (Figure	7‐1).	Orogenic	
domains	 within	 the	 North	 Australian	 cratons	 include	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Orogen,	 the	 Tanami	 region,	 the	
Murphy,	 Tennant	 and	 Arnhem	 Inliers	 and	 the	 Northern	 Arunta	 Province.	 These	 underwent	 extensive	
orogenic	 movement	 and	 regional	 metamorphism	 between	 1880	 and	 1850Ma	 (Barramundi	 Orogeny)	
followed	by	transitional	tectonics	and	igneous	activity	from	1850Ma,	in	some	area	continually,	to	1800Ma	
(Ahmad	et	al,	2001).

7.1 	REGIONAL	GEOLOGY	

	
The	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 all	 fall	 within	 the	 Archaean	 to	 Palaeoproterozoic	 Pine	 Creek	
Orogen,	one	of	the	major	mineral	provinces	of	Australia	(Figure	7‐1,	Figure	7‐2,	Figure	7‐3,	Figure	7‐4).		
The	 Pine	 Creek	Orogen	 is	 a	 deformed	 and	metamorphosed	 sedimentary	 basin	 up	 to	 14	 km	maximum	
thickness	 covering	 an	 area	 of	 approximately	 66,000	 km2	and	 extending	 from	Katherine	 in	 the	 south	 to	
Darwin	in	the	north.		It	hosts	significant	resources	of	gold,	uranium	and	platinum	group	metals	("PGMs"),	
as	well	as	substantial	base	metals,	silver,	iron	and	tin‐tantalum	mineralization.			
	
The	 Pine	 Creek	 Orogen	 comprises	 series	 of	 late	 Archaean	 granite‐gneiss	 basement	 domes,	 which	 are	
overlain	by	a	fluvial	to	marine	sedimentary	sequence	(Figure	7‐5).		Several	highly	reactive	rock	units	are	
included	 within	 this	 sedimentary	 sequence	 including	 carbonaceous	 shale,	 iron	 stones,	 evaporite,	
carbonate	 and	 mafic	 to	 felsic	 volcanic	 units	 of	 the	 South	 Alligator	 and	 Finniss	 River	 Groups.	 	 This	
sequence	has	been	subjected	to	regional	greenschist	facies	metamorphism	and	multiphase	deformation,	
which	 has	 resulted	 in	 the	 development	 of	 a	 northwest	 trending	 fabric.	 	 Subsequent	widespread	 felsic	
volcanism	and	the	intrusion	of	granitoids	caused	contact	metamorphism,	in	aureoles	between	500	m	and	
2	km	wide	that	overprint	the	earlier	regional	metamorphism.		After	the	granitoid	intrusions	an	extensive	
array	of	northeast	and	northwest	trending	dolerite	dykes	intruded	the	metasedimentary	sequence	during	
regional	extensional	deformation.			
	
Gold	mineralization	within	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	is	preferentially	developed	within	strata	of	the	South	
Alligator	Group	and	 lower	parts	of	 the	Finnis	River	Group	along	 anticlines,	 strike‐slip	 shear	 zones	and	
duplex	 thrusts	 located	 in	 proximity	 to	 the	 Cullen	 Granite	 Batholith.	 	 Of	 particular	 stratigraphic	
importance	 are	 the	Wildman	 Siltstone,	 the	Koolpin	 Formation,	 Gerowie	Tuff,	Mount	Bonnie	 Formation	
and	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation	(Figure	7‐5)	
	
The	 Wildman	 Siltstone	 consists	 of	 medium	 to	 thinly	 bedded,	 to	 laminated	 fine	 grained	 pyritic	
carbonaceous	sediments	with	minor	sandstone	and	tuff	beds,	with	an	overall	thickness	of	approximately	
1,000	m.	
	
The	 Koolpin	 Formation	 consists	 of	 sulphidic	 and	 carbonaceous	 argillite,	 ferruginous	 chert,	 ironstone,	
silicified	 dolomites	 and	 phyllitic	mudstones	which	were	 deposited	 in	 a	 low	 energy	 environment.	 	 The	
contact	between	the	Wildman	Siltstone	and	the	overlying	Koolpin	Formation	is	partially	conformable	and	
partially	an	angular	unconformity.		The	Koolpin	Formation	varies	in	thickness	from	less	than	300	m	to	in	
excess	 of	 1,000	 m,	 but	 its	 overall	 thickness	 is	 difficult	 to	 determine	 due	 to	 the	 presence	 of	 several	
intrusive	sills	of	Zamu	Dolerite,	which	vary	from	several	meters	to	a	few	hundred	meters	in	thickness.	
	
The	 Burrell	 Creek	 Formation	 comprises	 a	 1,500	 m	 thick	 sequence	 of	 turbiditic	 sediments	 including	
greywackes,	 siltstones	and	mudstones.	The	Mount	Bonnie	Formation	 is	 a	 transitional	unit	between	 the	
Koolpin	 and	 Burrell	 Creek	 Formations,	 comprising	 greywacke,	 carbonaceous	 siltstone,	 chert,	 tuff	 and	
ironstone	and	with	a	variable	thickness	between	150	m	and	400	m	thick.

The	Gerowie	Tuff	(GTF)	is	up	to	400	m	thick	and	consists	of	tuff,	tuffaceous	chert	and	tuffaceous	siltstone,	
with	subordinate	amounts	of	laminated	cherts	and	carbonaceous	siltstones.	
	
Numerous	semi‐conformable	sills	of	pre‐orogenic	Zamu	Dolerite	intrude	the	Koolpin	Formation	and	the	
Gerowie	 Tuff.	 	 The	 post	 mineralization	 Burnside	 Granite	 and	 Mount	 Goyder	 Syenite	 intrude	 the	
sedimentary	sequence.	

	
Maud	 Creek	 lies	 in	 the	 southeastern	 part	 of	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Geosyncline.	 Proterozoic	 rock	 units	 in	 the	
Maud	 Creek	 area	 comprise	 the	 Tollis	 Formation,	Maud	Dolerite,	 Edith	 River	 Volcanics,	 and	Kombolgie	
Formation.	
	
The	Tollis	Formation	(part	of	the	Finniss	River	Group)	outcrops	in	the	centre	and	northwest	of	the	Maud	
Creek	area	and	 is	 the	most	prospective	rock	unit	 for	gold	mineralization.	 	 It	 is	 typified	by	 thin	 to	 thick	
beds	of	alternating	greywacke	and	mudstone,	tuff	and	minor	conglomerate,	altered	mafic	to	intermediate	
volcanic	rocks	and	banded	ironstone.		The	Maud	Dolerite	intrudes	the	Tollis	Formation	and	outcrops	as	
irregular	bodies	up	to	200	m	in	width.	
	
In	the	northern	portion	of	the	Maud	Creek	area,	felsic	volcanics	of	the	Edith	River	Group	unconformably	
overlie	the	Tollis	Formation	and	the	Maud	Dolerite	and	are	in	turn	unconformably	overlain	by	the	fluvial	
sediments	 of	 the	Kombolgie	 Formation.	 	 In	 the	 south	 and	west,	 the	Tollis	 Formation	 is	masked	by	 the	
Cambrian	Antrim	Plateau	Volcanics	and	the	Tindals	Limestone.

7.2.1 	BURNSIDE	GOLD	&	BASE	METALS	PROJECT	

The	stratigraphy	of	the	Burnside	Gold	&	Base	Metals	Project	area	is	dominated	by	the	Wildman	Siltstone	
of	the	Mt	Partridge	Group	and	units	of	the	South	Alligator	Group	and	the	overlying	Finniss	River	Group.		
This	 volcano‐sedimentary	 sequence	 has	 been	 moderately	 to	 tightly	 folded	 along	 several	 northwest	
trending	 axes	 within	 the	 project	 area,	 the	 most	 prominent	 of	 which	 are	 the	 Howley,	 Brocks	
Creek/Zapopan	and	the	Fountain	Head	Anticlines	and	the	Margaret	Syncline	(Figure	7‐6).	The	axial	plane	
of	 these	 folds	 is	 characterized	 by	 intense	 bedding‐parallel	 faulting	 and	 shearing	 along	 predominantly	
northwest	trends.	

	
FIGURE	7‐6	BURNSIDE	AREA	GEOLOGY	

	
The	Howley	Anticline	is	a	regionally	continuous	structure	which	extends	over	a	strike	length	of	some	30	
km.		The	fold	can	be	described	as	a	doubly	plunging	upright,	asymmetric,	tight,	non‐cylindrical	fold,	which	
plunges	north	in	the	vicinity	of	the	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit	and	to	the	south	in	the	Bridge	Creek	area.		The	
Howley	 Anticline	 hosts	 several	 zones	 of	 significant	 gold	 mineralization	 including	 the	 Cosmo	
Howley/Deeps,	 Chinese	 Howley,	 Big	 Howley	 and	 Bridge	 Creek	 deposits.	 	 This	 mineralization	 is	
predominantly	 associated	with	 quartz	 veining,	 brecciation	 and	 shearing	within	 interbedded	 ironstone	
and	carbonaceous	mudstone	units	of	the	Koolpin	Formation.

The	Brocks	Creek	‐	Zapopan	gold	mineralization	is	hosted	by	argillite	and	greywacke	units	of	the	upper	
Gerowie	 Tuff	 and	 lower	Mount	 Bonnie	 Formation.	 	 This	 sequence	 has	 been	 folded	 around	 the	 Brocks	
Creek	‐	Zapopan	Anticline,	a	tight	southeast	plunging	anticline	which	is	evident	over	a	strike	length	of	12	
km.	 	 The	 axial	 plane	 of	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 ‐	 Zapopan	 Anticline	 is	 largely	 coincident	 but	 slightly	
asymmetrical	to	the	Brocks	Creek	shear	zone.	
	
In	 the	Hayes	Creek	area,	 stratiform	gold	and	base	metal	mineralization	 is	hosted	within	 ironstone	and	
fine	grained	carbonaceous	 to	 tuffaceous	sedimentary	units	of	 the	Mount	Bonnie	Formation	which	have	
been	openly	folded	about	the	north‐northeast	trending	Margaret	Syncline	and	associated	parasitic	folds.

and	psammite	units	which	are	interpreted	to	represent	a	turbidite	sequence	deposited	in	a	deep‐water,	
high	energy	environment.	
	
The	 sedimentary	 sequence	 has	 been	 tightly	 folded	 about	 the	 northwest	 trending	 Lady	 Alice	 Anticline.			
The	 hinge	 zone	 of	 the	 Lady	 Alice	 Anticline	 has	 been	 sheared	 out	 and	 transposed	 by	 several	 bedding‐
parallel,	 steeply	 dipping	 shear	 zones,	 including	 the	 Lady	Alice	 shear	 and	 the	 regional	 scale	 Pine	 Creek	
Shear	 Zone.	 	 Bedding‐cleavage	 relationships	 suggest	 the	 Lady	 Alice	 Anticline	 is	 tight	 to	 isoclinal	 and	
plunges	40°	to	60°	to	the	north‐northwest.			
	

7.2.2 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
The	 Pine	 Creek	 project	 overlies	 members	 of	 the	 South	 Alligator	 and	 Finniss	 River	 Groups,	 which	 are	
bound	 to	 the	 east,	 south	 and	 west	 by	 the	 Cullen	 Batholith	 (Figure	 7‐8).	 	 This	 northwest	 trending	
metasedimentary	lobe	is	approximately	35	km	long	by	5	km	wide	and	has	been	deformed	by	numerous	
northwest	trending	folds	and	shears	associated	with	the	Pine	Creek	Shear	Zone.			
	
The	stratigraphy	of	the	Pine	Creek	project	is	dominated	by	meta‐sedimentary	units	of	the	Mount	Bonnie	
and	 Burrell	 Creek	 Formations.	 	 Principal	 rock	 types	 within	 the	 Enterprise	 mine	 sequence	 include	
greywacke,	siltstone,	shale,	mudstone,	chert	and	tuff	and	four	major	intervals	are	recognized:	
	

 a	50	m	thick	lower	mine	greywacke	(Mt	Bonnie	Formation);	

 an	18	m	thick	nodular	chert	(Mt	Bonnie	Formation);	

 a	65	m	thick	spotted	silt	(Mount	Bonnie	Formation);	and	

 the	+50	m	thick	upper	greywacke,	the	first	unit	of	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation.		
	

The	 structural	 setting	 of	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 project	 is	 dominated	 by	 the	 Enterprise	 Anticline,	 a	 simple,	
moderately	 tight,	 upright	 anticline	 with	 a	 northwest	 trending,	 steeply	 west	 dipping	 axial	 plane.	 	 This	
anticlinal	 fold	 has	 been	 displaced	 along	 its	 eastern	 limb	 by	 a	 moderately	 west	 dipping	 reverse	 fault,	
locally	known	as	the	Eastern	Fault	Zone.		Several	other	adjacent	folds	parallel	the	Enterprise	Anticline.	
	
Gold	 mineralization	 at	 Pine	 Creek	 is	 intimately	 associated	 with	 quartz‐sulphide	 veining	 along	 the	
Enterprise	Anticline,	typically	occurring	within	50	m	of	its	axis.		The	vein	density	is	greatest	within	20m	
either	 side	 of	 the	 fold	 axis	 and	 resembles	 a	 stockwork.	This	 veining	 is	 accompanied	by	pervasive	 vein	
margin	alteration	and	the	introduction	of	associated	sulphides	(pyrite,	pyrrhotite	and	arsenopyrite	with	
lesser	sphalerite,	galena	and	chalcopyrite)	in	the	enclosing	sediments.		The	veins	range	from	millimeters	
to	meters	 in	 thickness	 and	 from	 a	meter	 to	 tens	 of	meters	 in	 strike	 and	 down	dip	 length.	 	 In	 general,

7.2.3 	MAUD	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
The	Maud	Creek	project	area	is	 located	south	of	the	Edith	Falls	Basin.	The	rock	units	within	the	project	
area	are	the	Tollis	Formation,	the	Maud	Dolerite,	the	Edith	River	Volcanics,	the	Kombolgie	Formation	and	
the	Antrim	Plateau	Volcanics	(Figure	7‐9).	
	
The	Tollis	Formation	represents	the	uppermost	unit	of	the	El	Sherana	Group	and	unconformably	overlies	
the	Burrell	Creek	Formation.	The	Tollis	Formation	consists	of	inter‐bedded	greywacke,	siltstone,	phyllite	
and	tuffs.	Low	grade	metamorphism	is	associated	with	a	period	of	intense	folding	referred	to	as	the	Maud	
Creek	 Event	 (a	 minor	 tectonic	 phase	 of	 the	 Top	 End	 Orogeny),	 which	 has	 also	 affected	 the	 folded	
metasediments	of	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation.	
	
The	Maud	Dolerite	 intrudes	the	Tollis	Formation	and	crops	out	as	 irregular	bodies	up	to	200	m	across.	
Quartz	 veining	with	 associated	 gold	mineralization	 has	 been	 observed	within	 the	 intrusive	 and	 in	 the	
adjacent	sediments.

The	area	around	the	former	Moline	open	pits	is	dominated	by	two	main	sequences	of	metasediments	of	
the	South	Alligator	Group,	an	upper	sequence	of	thickly	bedded	greywackes	and	siltstones	of	the	Burrell	
Creek	Formation	and	a	lower	sequence	of	thinly	bedded	cherty	shale	and	carbonaceous	shales	of	the	Mt

low	 angles	 towards	 the	 southeast.	 	 These	 folds	 are	 intersected	 by	west	 dipping	 shear	 zones	 trending	
between	 northwest‐southeast	 to	 north‐south	 which	 host	 pyrite,	 gold	 and	 base	 metal	 mineralization.		
Steeply	 dipping,	 northwest	 trending	 shears,	 parallel	 to	 fold	 axial	 planes,	 are	 common.	 	 Some	 steep,

The	Mount	Bundy	Gold	Project	 is	 located	within	 the	Early	Proterozoic	Pine	Creek	 Inlier.	The	deposit	 is	
hosted	by	the	Wildman	Siltstone,	a	member	of	the	Mt	Partridge	Group.	The	Wildman	Siltstone	is	at	least	
1000m	thick	and	comprises	laminated	pelitic	sediments	with	minor	sandstone	and	quartzite.	
	
In	the	deposit	area,	the	Wildman	Siltstone	outcrops	as	banded	carbonaceous	siltstone	and	mudstone.	The	
sediments	 have	 been	 subjected	 to	 regional	 greenschist	 grade	 metamorphism	 and	 the	 later	 contact	
metamorphic	effects	of	the	nearby	post‐tectonic	Mt	Bundy	Granite	pluton	and	the	Mt	Goyder	Syenite.		
	
The	 Wildman	 Siltstone	 underwent	 a	 gentle	 tilting	 and	 erosion	 prior	 to	 the	 deposition	 of	 the	 South	
Alligator	Group	sediments.	The	region	was	 then	subjected	 to	a	major	 folding	episode	along	south‐west	
plunging	 fold	axes.	Gold	mineralization	 is	hosted	 in	a	planar,	 south	dipping	quartz‐sulphide	vein	which	
postdates	the	folding	event.

7.3.1 	BURNSIDE	GOLD	&	BASE	METALS	PROJECTS	

	
Gold	mines	within	the	Burnside	Gold	project	area	have	been	responsible	for	the	majority	of	the	historical	
gold	 production	 in	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Orogen	 (Figure	 7‐12).	Most	 of	 the	 recent	 and	 current	modern	 gold	
mines	were	 first	 located	by	early	prospectors	 in	 the	 late	1800s	and	alluvial	production	was	significant.	
Today	these	occurrences	and	mines	contain	the	bulk	of	Crocodile	Gold's		resources.	
	
Although	 there	 are	 many	 similarities	 amongst	 the	 deposits	 described	 below,	 with	 most	 having	 some	
structural	control,	each	is	uniquely	different	in	its	structural	setting	and	style	of	mineralization.

7.3.2 	COSMO	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
The	 Cosmo	 lodes	 are	 hosted	 within	 the	 Upper	 to	 Middle	 Koolpin	 Formation,	 which	 consists	 of	
interbedded	 siltstones,	 carbonaceous	 mudstones,	 banded	 ironstone,	 phyllites,	 dolerite	 sills	 and	
greywacke	units	(Alexander	et	al,	1990).	
	
Gold	mineralization	 is	 closely	 associated	with	 sulphides,	which	 in	 the	weathered	 zone	were	 altered	 to	
limonite,	goethite	and	hematite.	The	main	sulphide	minerals	are	pyrite	and	arsenopyrite,	with	traces	of	
sphalerite	and	chalcopyrite.	Pyrrhotite	occurs	below	depths	of	300m.		
	
Most	of	the	gold	mineralization	is	associated	with	quartz	veins,	breccias	and	shears,	with	higher	grades	
commonly	 hosted	 by	 BIF	 adjacent	 to	 discordant	 structural	 positions.	 Lower	 gold	 grades	 occur	 in	 the	
mudstone	 in	 similar	 positions.	 Ore	 grade	 intercepts	 are	 closely	 related	 to	 areas	 of	 elevated	 pyrite,	
pyrrhotite	and	arsenopyrite	within	the	greywacke	units.	
	
The	geometry	of	the	mine	sequence	and	gold‐bearing	lodes	is	controlled	by	a	north‐plunging	overturned	
anticline	(the	Howley	Anticline)	with	gold‐bearing	lodes	developed	on	the	sub‐vertical	eastern	limb	and	
on	 the	 moderately‐west	 dipping	 west	 limb.	 In	 the	 pit	 area	 the	 anticlinal	 fold	 plunges	 at	 about	 ‐45°	
towards	 the	 northwest	 (325°).	 This	 plunge	 is	 thought	 to	 shallow	 to	 grid	 north.	 However,	 current	
structural	modeling	indicates	that	this	may	be	due	to	faulting	and	vertical	displacement	of	the	northern

7.3.3 	HOWLEY	DEPOSIT	

	
Northwest	of	the	Cosmo	Gold	Deposit,	stretching	for	approximately	5km,	there	are	several	historical	gold	
deposits	 located	within	a	historically	 rich	alluvial	 gold	mining	 site,	 including,	 from	south	 to	north,	 	 the	
Howley	Pits,	Mottrams	and	at	the	northern	end,	the	Big	Howley	Pit	(Figure	7‐16).	
	
In	contrast	to	historical	mining	and	resource	evaluations	where	each	deposit	had	been	treated	separately,	
it	is	now	recognized	that	each	discrete	deposit	forms	part	of	a	larger,	more	continuous	geological	model	
and	 gold	 system	 Crocodile	 Gold	 has	 also	 conducted	 several	 deeper	 diamond	 holes	 below	 the	 known	
system,	these	holes	intercepted	some	mineralization	which	needs	to	be	investigated	once	the	new	Howley	
Model	up‐date	is	complete.	
	
The	 Howley	 Pit	 has	 been	 the	 major	 source	 of	 ore	 tonnes	 and	 ounces	 for	 Crocodile	 since	 mining	 re‐
commenced	in	November	2009.	A	total	of	around	1.26	million	tonnes	of	ore	was	mined	from	the	Howley	
area	 in	2010,	 this	represents	around	69%	of	 the	 total	ore	mined	by	 the	Company	 in	 this	 time.	Photo	1	
below	 shows	 the	 Howley	 pit	 during	 December,	 the	 pit	 has	 been	 developed	 from	 the	 1090mRL	 to	 the	
1050mRL.	
	
The	Howley	gold	mineralization	is	 located	about	2km	northwest	of	the	Cosmo	Deeps	project	 in	an	area	
where	gold	mineralization	is	developed	in	both	the	hinge	zone	of	the	anticline	and	on	the	steeply	dipping	
flanks	 of	 a	 shallow	 north‐plunging	 anticline	 within	 rocks	 belonging	 to	 the	 Proterozoic	 Gerowie	 Tuff

7.3.4 	MOTTRAMS	DEPOSIT	

	
The	 Howley	 Deposit	 tenements	 are	 within	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Geosyncline,	 a	 folded	 and	 metamorphosed	
sequence	of	Lower	Proterozoic	pelitic	and	psammitic	sediments,	with	interlayered	cherty	tuff	units	which	
are	deposited	over	a	granitic	gneiss	basement.	Mafic	sills	of	the	Zamu	Dolerite	(~1.87Ga)	intruded	lower	
formations	of	the	South	Alligator	Group	like	the	Gerowie	Tuff	Formation	(GTF).		
	
The	 project	 tenements	 straddle	 the	 NW	 striking	 and	 plunging	 axis	 of	 the	 Howley	 Anticline	 that	 is	
comprised	 of	 members	 of	 the	 South	 Alligator	 Group	 and	 semi	 concordant	 pre‐orogenic	 sills	 of	 Zamu	
Dolerite.		
	
The	 project	 area	 is	 an	 extensive	 auriferous	 zone	 hosted	 within	 the	 GTF	 which	 is	 a	 meta‐sediment	
metamorphosed	to	greenschist	facies.	The	GTF	has	since	been	conformably	intruded	by	the	Zamu	Dolerite	
and	 other	 smaller	 dolerite	 sills,	 folded	 to	 form	 the	Howley	 Anticline	 and	weathered	 to	 variable	 depths,	
around	20m.	During	the	folding,	the	brittle	Zamu	Dolerite	which	is	composed	of	the	inner	and	outer	zones	
was	fractured	and	later	filled	with	auriferous	fluids.

The	 Howley	 Anticline	 is	 a	 macroscopic,	 west	 convex	 acuate,	 asymmetric	 fold	 structure	 that	 has	 been	
mapped	over	a	distance	of	30km	from	the	Cosmo	Howley	gold	mine	in	the	south	to	Mount	Paqualin	in	the	
north.		
	
Within	the	Howley	Deposit	area	the	fold	has	a	slight	NW	plunge	of	10	degrees.	This	plunge	reverses	to	the	
south	in	the	Bridge	Creek	area.	Parallel	fold	axes	lie	east	and	west	of	the	Howley	structure.	Both	limbs	of	
the	Howley	Anticline	have	been	mined	by	shallow	underground	methods	and	recently	by	open	pit.		
	
Syn	to	Post‐orogenic	granitoid	intrusives	like	the	Burnside	Batholith	to	the	north	have	imparted	a	thermal	
metamorphic	aureole	on	 the	project	area.	Biotite‐garnet‐cordierite‐amphibolite	and	calc	silicates	are	 the	
end	members	of	this	event.	The	alteration	minerals	decrease	in	abundance	further	from	the	contact	zone. 
 
The	Howley	Deposit	area	is	composed	of	4	separate	resource	areas,	comprising	Howley	South	Extended,	
Howley	1,	2,	3,	Mottrams	and	Big	Howley,	each	of	which	have	slightly	different	geology	but	are	all	hosted	
by	the	Howley	Anticline.		
	
The	principal	mineralization	 for	 all	 four	 resource	 areas	 is	 hosted	by	 the	GTF	which	 is	 part	of	 the	 lower	
Proterozoic	 South	 Alligator	 Group	 that	 unconformably	 overlies	 the	 Koolpin	 Formation.	 The	 GTF	 is	
comprised	of	thinly	laminated	moderately	carbonaceous	meta‐pelites	(the	favorable	unit	of	mineralization	
at	Howley)	and	meta‐siltstone,	both	 to	a	 thickness	of	5	meters,	with	more	massive	 thin	beds	of	 tuff	and	
chert	 (Steven	 Bacigalupo‐Rose	 Geological	 Aspects	 of	 trial	 Mining	 at	 Chinese	 Howley	 and	 Big	 Howley	
December	1992).		
	
The	 Howley	 South	 Extended	 deposit	 is	 predominantly	 positioned	 within	 the	 Zamu	 Dolerite	 which	 is	
notable	 for	 its	 hard	 drilling.	 Higher	 grade	 gold	mineralization	 is	 located	 along	 the	western	 limb	 at	 the	
dolerite/sediment	contact	and	along	the	axial	plane	of	the	anticline.		
	
The	Howley	1,	2,	3	and	Big	Howley	deposits	are	 located	 in	the	Howley	Anticline	 in	the	GTF	as	the	Zamu	
Dolerite	 plunges	 underneath.	 The	 Mottrams	 deposit	 is	 centered	 on	 the	 western	 limb	 of	 the	 Howley	
Anticline,	immediately	northwest	of	Howley	1,	2,	3	deposits.	
	
Mineralization	at	the	Howley	South	Extended	deposit	is	developed	at	a	lower	stratigraphic	level	of	the	GTF	
compared	with	the	other	deposits	of	 the	Howley	Deposit	and	a	significant	amount	is	 localized	at	or	near	
the	contact	between	sediment	and	the	western	side	of	 the	 inner	Zamu	Dolerite.	Mineralization	near	 this	
contact	is	contained	within	a	2‐10m	thick	lode	and	is	continuous	along	strike	and	in	places	down	dip.	The	
extent	 of	 the	 down‐dip	 continuity	 is	 not	 sufficiently	 known	 due	 to	 the	 lack	 of	 drilling	 and	 it	 is	
recommended	that	more	holes	be	drilled	to	test	down	dip‐mineralization.		
	
Several	semi‐parallel	lodes	are	developed	deeper	within	the	dolerite	host.		
	
On	 the	eastern	 limb,	 steeper	 lodes	 controlled	by	axial‐planar	 shearing	are	present.	These	 structures	are	
intersected	intermittently	due	to	the	wide	drill	hole	spacing.		
	
Mineralization	 at	 the	Howley	1,	 2,	 3	 and	Mottrams	deposits	 occurs	 in	 lodes	within	 the	highly	deformed	
thrusted	and	folded	GTF.	The	fold	is	asymmetrical	and	relatively	open	with	bedding	at	‐60°	on	the	western	
limb	and	overturned	to	be	dipping	sub‐vertically	at	‐80°	on	the	eastern	limb.	Lodes	are	sub‐parallel	to	the	
bedding.

Mineralization	at	the	Big	Howley	deposit	occurs	in	lodes	located	within	the	vicinity	of	the	axial	plane	of	the	
Howley	Anticline.	There	are	3	types	of	lodes;	vertical	eastern	lodes,	central	lodes	which	dip	from	‐40°	to	‐
70°	to	the	west,	and	western	lodes	that	dip	about	‐60°	to	the	west.	All	these	lodes	are	within	the	GTF.	

7.3.5 	FOUNTAIN	HEAD	–	TALLY	HO	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

	
Gold	mineralization	in	the	Fountain	Head	deposit	is	hosted	by	units	of	the	Mount	Bonnie	Formation	of	the	
South	Alligator	Group	and	is	associated	with	quartz‐pyrite‐arsenopyrite	veins	(Figure	7‐18,	Figure	7‐19).	
These	 occur	 in	 dilatant	 zones	 in	 the	 axis	 of	 a	 shallow	 southeast	 plunging	 asymmetric	 anticline	 fold.	
Mineralization	 is	 hosted	 by	 sub‐vertical	 shear	 related	 stockworks,	 fracture	 zones	 in	 greywackes	 and	
saddle	 reefs	 at	 lithological	 contacts	 over	 a	 strike	 length	 of	 420	meters.	 	Most	 of	 the	 resource	 is	 in	 the	
hinge	zone	of	 the	anticline	with	 gold	grade	 rapidly	 tapering	off	down	dip	on	 the	 limbs.	Fracture	 zones	
within	the	hinge	zone	lie	parallel	to	the	axis	of	the	fold	and	have	acted	as	a	focus	for	fluid	channeling.			
	
The	Fountain	Head	area	was	 subject	 to	widespread	historical	 alluvial	mining	 activity	 and	 later	 intense	
systematic	exploration	drilling	campaigns.	A	small	trial	mining	open	pit	was	developed	in	1995.		The	Tally	
Ho	lodes	were	discovered	in	late	2006	through	an	initial	reverse	circulation	drilling	program	and	follow‐
up	diamond	core	program.	The	deposit	was	quickly	expanded	and	brought	into	production.		
	
Diamond	drilling	 carried	out	during	2008	 failed	 to	 intersect	 significant	 gold	 grades	despite	 recovering	
numerous	pieces	of	visible	gold	in	the	core.		Further	exploration	is	warranted	to	test	the	lode	extension	at	
deeper	 levels.	 	Figure	 	graphically	depicts	 the	geology	of	 the	deposits	and	the	potential	of	 the	Fountain	
Head	area.	Indications	are	that	there	are	high	grade	north	plunging	shoots	beneath	the	floor	of	the	Tally	
Ho	open	pit.		There	is	very	little	deeper	drilling	and	minimal	drilling	along	strike.

The	Yam	Creek	area	was	historically	one	of	the	better	known	bedrock	and	alluvial	gold	mining	areas	in	
the	Northern	Territory	following	the	discovery	of	gold	in	the	area	in	1872.	The	district	was	famous	for	its	
gold	 nuggets,	 the	 largest	 being	 700	 ounces	 (22.5	 kilograms).	 By	 1901,	 a	 three	 compartment	 shaft	 had	
been	sunk	at	North	Point	with	two	cross‐cuts	driven	west	at	42	meters	and	62	meters	as	a	prospecting	
exercise.		The	lodes	in	the	62	meter	crosscut	were	reported	to	average	5g/t	Au	over	a	width	of	20	meters.		
	
Further	south	at	Princess	Louise,	2,422	tonnes	grading	51g/t	Au	was	reported	as	having	been	produced	
in	 1891.	 	 Gold	 was	 recovered	 from	 east‐dipping	 (50°)	 quartz‐sulphide	 veins	 within	 a	 west‐dipping	
greywacke	unit,	4	meters	in	thickness.	The	shoots	were	reported	to	plunge	northerly	at	30°.			
	
The	host	rocks	comprise	silt‐greywacke‐mudstone	sediments	of	the	South	Alligator	Group	(Lower	Mount	
Bonnie	Formation).	These	are	overlain	by	Finniss	River	Group,	comprising	greywacke	(flysch)	sediments	
of	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation.	The	underlying	Gerowie	Tuff	and	local	sills	of	Zamu	Dolerite	are	exposed	
in	the	south	of	the	area	in	the	core	of	the	fold.	The	dominant	mineralized	structural	 feature	in	the	area	
comprises	 the	west	 limb	of	 the	Yam	Creek	anticline	 that	dips	west	at	50‐60°.	The	east	 limb	 is	 steep	 to	
overturned	and	the	axis	plunges	north	at	10‐30°.		
	
The	majority	of	mineralization	is	associated	with	quartz‐filled	tension	gash	veins	within	the	greywacke,	
controlled	 by	 the	 refracted	 cleavage	 pattern.	 	 The	 veins	 are	 best	 developed	 near	 the	 hanging	 wall	
(western)	contact	of	greywacke	and	mudstone,	occurring	as	an	echelon	vein	sets,	vein	thickness	varying	
from	stringers	to	over	one	meter	(Figure	7‐20).

7.3.7 	PAQUALIN	GROUP	GOLD	DEPOSITS		

	
The	Paqualin	group	of	gold	deposits	is	located	along	a	north	trending	line	located	about	5km	west	of	the	
Burnside	Granite	(Figure	7‐4,	and	Figure	7‐6).	
	
The	 geology	 of	 the	 Paqualin	 area	 is	 dominated	 by	 the	 regionally	 mineralized	 Howley	 Anticline	 which	
trends	north	through	the	centre	of	the	project	and	is	flanked	to	the	east	and	west	by	mineralized	parallel	
parasitic	anticline	structures.	 	In	the	Paqualin	area,	the	Koolpin	Formation,	Zamu	Dolerite,	Gerowie	Tuff	
and	Mt	Bonnie	Formations	of	 the	South	Alligator	Group	are	exposed	as	a	gross	domal	structure	on	 the	
Howley	Anticline,	which	plunges	north	at	Bon's	Rush	and	south	at	Bridge	Creek.		
	
The	Kazi	Deposit	 is	 located	 on	 the	 eastern	 limb	 of	 a	 north	 trending	 syncline	 immediately	 east	 of	 the	
Howley	Anticline	structure.	 	The	deposit	 is	almost	entirely	concealed	beneath	1‐5	meters	of	 silty	black	
soil	 alluvium.	 Regional	 and	 infill	 airborne	 and	 ground	 magnetics	 show	 that	 Kazi	 is	 associated	 with	 a	
moderate	to	strong	'bulls	eye'	magnetic	anomaly.		
	
Gold	 is	 developed	 within	 a	 moderately	 west‐dipping,	 north‐striking,	 tabular	 high	 grade	 lode	
approximately	200	meters	in	length,	within	the	hinge	and	east	limb	of	an	easterly	overturned	anticline.		
Gold	 mineralization	 is	 strongly	 associated	 with	 an	 en‐echelon	 quartz‐arsenopyrite	 vein	 system,	 sub‐
parallel	 to	bedding,	with	trace	amounts	of	pyrrhotite,	pyrite,	chalcopyrite,	galena	and	sphalerite.	Above	
this	 main	 lode	 is	 a	 series	 of	 lower	 grade	 and	 parallel	 hanging	 wall	 lodes.	 	 Oxide	 depletion	 of	 gold	 is	
outlined	by	the	drill	results	with	improvement	of	grades	and	continuity	of	the	main	lode	at	depth	in	fresh	
rock	below	approximately	20	meters.		
	
At	Bon's	Rush,	 gold	mineralization	 is	 hosted	within	 the	 hanging	wall	 of	 the	 Upper	 Zamu	Dolerite	 sill	
positioned	stratigraphically	between	the	carbonaceous	shale	from	the	Upper	Koolpin,	and	tuff,	shale	and	
chert	beds	from	the	Gerowie	Tuff	Formations.		
	
At	Bridge	Creek,	 stockwork‐style	 gold	mineralization	 extends	 over	 a	 strike	 distance	 of	 approximately	
1500	meters	in	length	and	50	meters	in	width,	and	lies	at	the	gradational	contact	between	carbonaceous	
mudstone	of	the	Upper	Koolpin	Formation	and	a	sequence	of	interbedded	volcanic	tuffs	and	pelitic	rocks	
in	 the	 overlying	 Gerowie	 Tuff,	 above	 and	 below	 a	 sill	 of	 Zamu	 Dolerite.	 	 The	mineralization	 has	 been	
interpreted	 to	 form	 classic	 "saddle	 reef"	 type	 lodes	 above	 and	 in	 the	 dolerite	 sill,	 and	 a	 steeply	
dipping/sub‐vertical	 lode	 system	 in	 the	 limbs	 of	 the	 fold	 and	 in	 the	 core	 of	 the	 fold	 hinge	 below	 the	
dolerite.		Best	mineralization	is	developed	in	the	hinge	zone	below	the	dolerite	within	the	carbonaceous	
mudstone.		
	
At	Western	Arm,	 the	main	mineralized	 zone	 is	 approximately	 1,200	meters	 in	 length	 and	 50	meters	
wide,	 and	 lies	 at	 the	 contact	 between	 a	 major	 sequence	 of	 greywacke,	 siltstone	 and	mudstone	 in	 the	
hanging	 wall	 (Mt.	 Bonnie	 Formation)	 and	 carbonaceous	 shale,	 sulphidic	 shale,	 tuffaceous	 mudstone,	
nodular	mudstone	(Gerowie	Tuff)	in	the	footwall.				
	
Gold	mineralization	 occurs	 as	 "saddle	 reef"	 style	 in	 a	 series	 of	 quartz‐sulphide	 stockwork	 lodes	 semi‐
conformable	to	bedding,	and	is	best	developed	in	mudstone	and	siltstone	units	in	the	hinge	and	eastern	
limb	positions	of	the	fold.	Limited	historical	drilling	has	intersected	high	grade	mineralization,	including	
16m	@	4.4g/t	Au	and	13m	@	3.4g/t	Au	within	a	25m	thick	supergene	zone.	Less	continuous	and	lower	
grade	 mineralization	 lies	 within	 the	 coarser	 grained	 greywacke	 units	 between	 the	 higher	 grade	
mineralized	mudstone	units.	These	 lodes	plunge	 shallowly	 to	 the	 south	 and	north	 at	 the	 southern	and	
northern	ends	of	the	main	mineralized	zone	respectively.

7.3.8 	BROCKS	CREEK	GOLD	MINE	

	
The	 Brocks	 Creek	 underground	mine	 (historically	 known	 as	 the	 Zapopan	mine	 and	 incorporating	 the	
historical	Faded	Lily	&	Alligator	 zones)	 is	 a	 stratiform,	meta‐sedimentary	hosted	quartz‐vein	 type	gold	
deposit,	formed	in	the	steeply	southeasterly	plunging	hinge	of	a	tight	anticline.	The	mineralized	sequence	
consists	 of	 argillite,	 often	 highly	 carbonaceous	 near	 its	 base,	with	 variable	 proportions	 of	 interbedded	
greywacke,	chert	and	tuff.	There	are	thin	BIF	beds	near	the	top	of	the	sequence	(Miller	et	al,	1998).	
	
Gold	 mineralization	 occurs	 within	 a	 number	 of	 bands	 of	 quartz	 as	 well	 as	 some	 bedding	 concordant	
quartz	 veins,	 along	 vein	margins	 and	within	 graphitic	 shears,	 and	 has	 a	 close	 affinity	with	 pyrite	 and	
arsenopyrite.	Ore	zones	may	have	up	to	10%	pyrite	and	5%	arsenopyrite	and	small	grains	of	visible	gold	
are	a	relatively	common	feature	of	higher	grade	zones.	
	
Four	lode	zones	have	been	identified:	
	

 5	Lode	 	 Iron	rich	carbonate	 	 10	‐	20cm	 			15g/t	Au	
 10	Lode	 Quartz	Reef	 	 	 	 0.2	‐	2.0m	 ~50g/t	Au	
 20	Lode	 Iron	rich	carbonate	 	 1.2	–	3.0m	 ~60g/t	Au	
 30	Lode	 Discontinuous	viens	 	 0.5m	 	 ~30g/t	Au	

	
The	 Lodes	 are	 folded	 and	 plunge	 southeast	 at	 approximately	 40°.The	 orebody	 is	 complicated	 by	 two	
faults	named	the	"North	Slide	fault"	and	"South	Slide	Fault".	The	two	"slide	faults"	determine	the	extent	of	
mineralization	of	the	lodes	The	intersection	of	the	slides	with	the	axial	fold	plane	splits	the	mineralization	
into	 three	 identifiable	 units,	 these	 being	 the	 Fissure	 Lode,	Main	 Lode	 and	 Central	 Lode	 from	 south	 to	
north,	respectively.		The	Main	and	Fissure	Lodes	strike	east‐west	and	dip	southwards	at	approximately	‐
55°	to	‐60°,	in	parallel	with	the	bedding	direction.	The	Central	Lode	is	located	along	the	hinge	zone	of	the	
anticline.

7.3.9 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

The	Pine	Creek	 area	 contains	 a	number	of	 historical	 gold	mines,	 including,	 from	north	 to	 south,	North	
Gandy's,	 International,	 South	 Gandy's,	 Enterprise,	 Czarina,	 South	 Czarina	 and	 South	 Enterprise.	 The	
Enterprise	Deposit	was	the	largest	mine;	the	most	significant	deposits	currently	outlined	within	the	Pine	
Creek	project	are	the	Enterprise	and	Czarina	deposits.	

	
FIGURE	7‐22	PINE	CREEK	GEOLOGY	

	
Open	 pit	 mining	 commenced	 in	 1985	 and	 continued	 through	 to	 1994	 by	 which	 time	 the	 project	 was	
owned	by	RGC	Limited.	During	 this	period,	a	 total	of	774,000	ounces	of	gold	were	produced	 from	12.3	
million	tonnes	grading	2.4g/t	Au.	Nearly	80%	of	this	production	was	from	the	Enterprise	pit.		
	
Gold	mineralization	is	hosted	within	a	thin,	southeast	trending	antiformal	lobe,	measuring	approximately	
35km	x	5km,	of	Mt	Bonnie	Formation	metasediments	within	Cullen	Granite	 (Cannard	et	 al,	1990).	The	
lobe	 lies	 within	 a	 trough	 defined	 by	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Shear	 Zone	 and	 bounded	 on	 the	 east	 by	 a	 steep	
westerly	dipping	reverse	fault,	the	Eastern	Fault	Zone.		
	
Gold	 mineralization	 consists	 of	 quartz‐sulphide	 veining	 with	 abundant	 pyrite,	 arsenopyrite	 and	
pyrrhotite.	Up	to	50%	of	the	gold	is	free	gold,	with	the	balance	occurring	as	inclusions	in	the	arsenopyrite.	
Most	 of	 the	 ore	 grade	 gold	 mineralization	 is	 within	 50m	 of	 the	 axis	 of	 the	 Enterprise	 Anticline.	
Mineralization	may	 typically	 be	 20	 –	 80m	wide,	 particularly	 in	 the	 intensely	 fractured	 and	 brecciated	
hinge	zone.	On	the	west	 limb,	mineralization	 is	bounded	by	a	single	massive	silt	bed	 in	the	middle	of	a

nodular	chert	unit	and	is	continuous	to	the	anticlinal	axis	for	widths	of	10	–	40m	over	the	length	of	the	
deposit.	Mineralization	 on	 the	 eastern	 limb	 is	 stratabound.	Mineralization	 is	 up	 to	 20	 ‐	 50m	wide	 but	
discontinuous	along	strike.	Generally	the	mineralization	has	been	described	as	a	"saddle‐reef"	style.

7.3.10 	UNION	REEFS	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

	
The	Union	Reefs	project	 contains	numerous	historical	workings	developed	over	 the	northwest	 striking	
Pine	Creek	Shear	Zone	and	the	associated	Union	and	Lady	Alice	Lines.	Known	gold	mineralization	extends	
over	a	length	of	3.5km,	400	meters	width	and	to	a	vertical	depth	of	300	meters.			
	
The	Lady	Alice	Line	follows	the	axis	of	the	Lady	Alice	Anticline,	with	the	majority	of	workings	developed	
on	the	western	limb	of	this	fold.	Mineralization	is	associated	with	quartz‐sulphide	veining,	comprising	1	
mm	to	2	meter	thick	lode‐style	veins	(in	sheared	pelites),	stockwork	veins	(in	greywacke)	and	sheeted‐
vein	systems	(in	thinly	interbedded	pelites	and	psammites).		
	
The	 three	 veins	 styles	may	 occur	 separately	 or	 coalesce.	 	 The	 lodes	 generally	 crop	 out	 as	 en‐echelon,	
northwest	plunging	lenses	parallel	to	near	vertical	shears	trending	010°,	330°	and	355°.		Steeply	plunging	
saddle	reefs	up	to	3	meters	thick	are	zoned	with	mineralized	vein	selvedges.		
	
Currently	 the	most	 significant	deposits	within	 the	Union	Reefs	project	are	 the	Esmeralda	and	Prospect	
Claim	 deposits.	 	 A	 small	 scale	 underground	 mining	 opportunity	 exists	 at	 Prospect	 Claim	 with	 access	
potentially	from	the	upper	benches	of	the	Crosscourse	open	pit.

7.3.11 	MAUD	CREEK	GOLD	MINE	

	
The	Maud	Creek	Project	 includes	 the	historical	Gold	Creek	Gold	Deposit	which	 is	 located	along	a	 steep	
easterly	dipping,	north‐south	trending	fault,	the	Gold	Creek	Fault,	which	forms	the	contact	between	lithic	
sandstone	and	siltstone	 to	 the	west	and	mafic	 tuff	 to	 the	east	 (Figure	7‐9)	 (Morrison	et	al,	1998).	Gold	
mineralization	is	associated	with	intense	quartz	veining	along	the	contact.	
	
Structural	 features	 such	 as	 shears,	 faults,	 associated	 brecciation,	 geological	 contacts	 and	 competency	
contrast	between	the	different	rock	types	principally	control	the	mineralization	associated	with	the	Maud	
Creek	deposit.		These	structures	include:		
	

 the	 graphitic	 Main	 Zone	 Shear	 overlying	 the	 sandstone,	 associated	 with	 the	 variably	 silicified	
sulphidic	carbonaceous	sediment;		

 the	interpreted	sub‐vertical	shear	zone	located	along	the	contact	of	the	sub‐vertical	dolerite;	and		
 the	 intersection	 of	 these	 two	 shears,	 where	 a	 broad	 zone	 of	 brecciation	 and	 associated	

mineralization	occurs.		

	
Widths	of	mineralization	are	usually	influenced	by	the	intensity	of	deformation	such	as	shearing,	faulting	
and	associated	brecciation.		This	may	range	from	several	meters	to	50	meters	in	true	width.		
	
The	principal	portion	of	the	deposit	is	250m	long,	up	to	57	meters	wide,	striking	north	and	dipping	at	60°	
to	the	east	(Figure	7‐29).	The	strike	extensions	of	this	mineralized	Main	Zone	lode	are	open	to	the	north	
where	previous	near‐surface	drilling	over	a	+800	meter	 strike	 length	has	 intersected	a	 similar	 style	of	
mineralization,	 though	 at	 lower	 grades	 and	widths.	 	 To	 the	 south	 the	mineralization	 is	most	 probably

truncated	and	off‐set	by	a	cross	fault.	Approximately	80%	of	the	mineralization	has	been	defined	in	the	
Main	Zone,	which	is	open	at	depth.		
	
The	orebody	 is	 typically	 oxidized	 to	15‐20m	depth,	 then	moderately	oxidized	 (Transition	Zone)	 to	25‐
30m	passing	abruptly	 to	 fresh	 sulphide	ore.	Primary	mineralization	 contains	up	 to	5%	 total	 sulphides,	
dominantly	pyrite	 and	arsenopyrite.	Arsenic	 levels	within	 the	higher	grade	gold	 zone	may	 range	up	 to	
2%.		
	
Test	work	has	shown	that	the	bulk	of	the	primary	mineralization	is	refractory	in	nature;	hence	recovery	
of	 the	 gold	 by	 conventional	 direct	 cyanidation	processes	 is	 not	possible	 (McKibben	 et,	 2008).	 The	 test	
work	identified	the	amenability	of	the	Maud	Creek	ore	to	gravity	and	floatation	concentration	followed	by	
a	 biological	 oxidation	 of	 the	 floatation	 concentrates	 prior	 to	 gold	 recovery	 through	 a	 conventional	
CIP/CIL	process.	
	
Past	 operators	 undertook	 various	 pre‐feasibility	 analyses	 on	 the	 Maud	 Creek	 project	 indicating	 the	
viability	of	the	project.		
	
The	shallow	Maud	Creek	open	pit	is	currently	full	of	water.

7.3.12 	MOLINE	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
The	Moline	Gold	Project,	located	approximately	50km	east	of	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant,	has	been	
the	 subject	 of	 extensive	 historical	 mining	 (Figure	 7‐31).	 Gold	 was	 discovered	 in	 the	 Moline	 area	 by	
Chinese	miners	in	1882	with	subsequent	historical	mining	continuing	on	an	intermittent	basis	until	1957.		
Modern	exploration	 for	gold	and	base	metals	mineralization	within	 the	Moline	area	 commenced	 in	 the	
early	1980s,	which	 led	 to	 the	definition	of	 three	main	mineralized	 trends;	namely	 the	Hercules,	Moline	
and	Tumbling	Dice	trends.

FIGURE	7‐31	MOLINE	GEOLOGY	

	
The	main	open	pits	of	Hercules,	School,	Moline	and	Tumbling	Dice,	 along	with	several	 smaller	 satellite	
pits,	which	were	 in	operation	 from	1989	 to	1992,	occur	within	 the	main	mining	 lease,	MLN1059.	 	The	
main	pits	of	Northern	Hercules	and	Moline	produced	the	bulk	of	the	ore	and	were	mined	down	to	the	top	
of	the	sulphide	zone	(60‐	70	meters	below	surface).	Substantial	mineralization	was	also	extracted	from	
the	 School,	 Four	 and	 Tumbling	 Dice	 open	 pits	 and	 from	 16	 other	 small,	 shallow	 pits	 confined	 to	 the	
oxidized	zone.				
	
Metallurgical	problems	in	treating	the	part‐oxidized	refractory	gold	mineralization	were	the	main	factor	
in	the	mining	and	processing	operation	being	closed	down	in	1992.		Since	cessation	of	mining,	a	number	
of	 companies	have	carried	out	exploration	under	option	within	 the	project	area.	 	Exploration	activities	
included	 deep	 drilling	 beneath	 the	 Moline	 and	 Tumbling	 Dice	 pits	 and	 geochemical	 surveys	 and	
preliminary	RC	drilling	of	anomalies.		
	
The	area	around	the	former	Moline	open	pits	is	dominated	by	two	main	sequences	of	metasediments	of	
the	South	Alligator	Group.	An	upper	sequence	of	thickly	bedded	greywackes	and	siltstones	of	the	Burrell	
Creek	Formation	and	a	lower	sequence	of	thinly	bedded	cherty	shale	and	carbonaceous	shales	of	the	Mt	
Bonnie	Formation.	Within	the	project	area,	metasediments	are	isoclinally	folded	about	axes	plunging	at	
low	 angles	 towards	 the	 southeast.	 These	 folds	 are	 intersected	 by	 west	 dipping	 shear	 zones	 trending	
between	 northwest‐southeast	 to	 north‐south	 which	 host	 pyrite,	 gold	 and	 base	 metal	 mineralization.	
Steeply	 dipping,	 northwest	 trending	 shears,	 parallel	 to	 fold	 axial	 planes,	 are	 common.	 	 Some	 steep

northeast	trending,	cross	faults,	are	also	present	(and	outcrop	in	the	west	wall	at	the	south	end	of	the	pit)	
and	postdate	the	mineralization.		
	
The	Hercules	shear	which	contains	the	Hercules	Reef	cross‐cuts	the	stratigraphy	and	trends	345°	in	the	
north	of	the	pit,	but	swings	to	trend	315°	(sub	parallel	to	stratigraphy	and	locally	known	as	the	Carolina	
Reef)	in	the	south	of	the	pit	and	continues	through	School	Pit.	This	structure	is	mineralized	over	3km	in	
strike	length	and	dips	steeply	(average	65°)	to	the	west.	Ore	shoots	pinch	and	swell	both	down	dip	and	
along	strike.	There	are	at	least	two	sub	parallel	but	weaker	mineralized	shears	in	the	hanging	wall.		The	
Hercules	pit	contains	three	ore	shoots	that	pitch	south	at	shallow	angles.	 	The	two	southern	shoots	are	
hosted	by	greywacke/siltstone	beds	within	a	synclinal	fold	plunging	to	the	southeast	across	the	pit,	while	
the	northern	shoot	is	contained	within	the	carbonaceous	shales	and	cherts.		
	
Limited	drilling	 took	place	 in	2006,	 in	 the	vicinity	of	 the	North	Hercules	pit	and	near	 the	High	Chinese	
prospect.	 Results	 of	 this	 drilling	 were	 not	 encouraging,	 therefore	 a	 deposit	 scale	 review	 would	 be	
required	before	more	drilling	is	conducted	as	it	is	unclear	if	any	of	this	2006	drilling	actually	tested	the	
large	gold	in	soil	geochemical	anomaly	reported	separately.	
	
At	 the	northwest	end	of	 the	project	 area	 lies	 the	old	Evelyn	base	metal	mine.	Unconfirmed	production	
figures	for	the	period	1966‐70	indicate	average	grades	of	6.1%	Zn,	5.8%	Pb	and	260/t	Ag.	It	is	estimated	
that	about	83,000	tonnes	were	produced	in	this	time	frame.	
	
There	are	indications	the	mine	was	also	in	production	in	the	1930's	for	a	short	period	of	time.	
	

7.3.13 	YEURALBA	PROJECT	

	
Six	mining	leases	make	up	the	Yeuralba	Project	area	which	is	largely	underlain	by	the	Maud	Dolerite	unit	
with	Trollis	Formation	rocks	to	the	east	and	west.	The	geological	environment	is	generally	similar	to	that	
at	the	Maud	Creek	deposit	located	to	the	southwest.	
	
A	copper	showing,	known	as	the	Copper	Flower	prospect,	is	located	at	the	north	end	of	the	land	position.	
Little	 is	known	about	this	mineralization	although	the	Northern	Territory	database	does	indicate	it	 is	a	
sedimentary	hosted	gossanous	banded	iron	formation	containing	copper	and	gold.	Significant	high	grade	
copper	samples	have	been	identified	in	the	region	including	some	small	scale	mining	operations.	
	
Research	of	available	files	and	a	site	visit	are	required	to	determine	the	overall	merits	of	this	property.	It	
should	 be	 noted	 that	 it	 is	 proximal	 to	 the	 Katherine	 Gorge	 area	 and	 extreme	 care	will	 be	 required	 in	
performing	any	work	in	the	area.

of	quartz,	sericite,	graphite,	biotite,	pyrite	and	andalusite	with	accessory	 tourmaline	and	rutile.	Locally,	
the	 sediment	 package	 dips	 southerly	 and	 the	 reef	 appears	 to	 be	 conformable	 with	 the	 sediments.	
However,	mapping	has	demonstrated	that	the	structure	cross‐cuts	the	fold	structures.	The	sediments	are	
generally	well	banded,	with	little	structural	fabric.	However,	within	1‐2m	of	the	reef,	a	deformation	fabric	
is	typically	present.	This	comprises	shearing	and	varying	degrees	of	brecciation,	with	the	fabric	parallel	to	
the	reef	orientation.	Similar	deformation	occurs	 in	the	vicinity	of	 the	Crabb	and	Williams	 faults	(Figure	
7‐34	and	Figure	7‐35).	
	
In	 the	 deposit	 area,	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 mineralization	 is	 hosted	 by	 a	 planar	 quartz	 sulphide	 vein	 which	
strikes	east‐west	and	dips	south	at	approximately	30°	near	the	outcrop	position	to	near	horizontal	some	
1,500	meters	 down‐dip	 (280	meters	 deep).	 	 Sheppard	 (1996)	 interpreted	 the	mineralized	 "reef"	 to	 be	
hosted	in	the	D2	thrust	fault	with	fluid	transport	to	the

the	thrust	acted	as	a	décollement	zone.	Field	relationships	and	micro‐fabric	studies	suggest	that	quartz	
and	sulphide	were	deposited	in	a	reactivated	thrust	during	wrench	shear	along	several	north‐northeast	
trending	faults	associated	with	emplacement	of	the	Mt	Bundy	pluton.	
	
The	quartz	reef	is	a	composite	structure	comprised	of	two	main	quartz	types:	(i)	euhedral	buck‐textured	
quartz	and	minor	comb‐textured	and	ribbon‐textured	milky	quartz,	and	(ii)	blue‐grey	cherty	quartz	and	
sulphides.		
	
The	milky	quartz	contains	abundant	graphitic	shale	slivers	or	partings,	1‐5mm	thick,	oriented	parallel	to	
the	reef	walls	and	very	minor	podiform	pyrite.	The	milky	quartz	occurs	over	the	entire	strike	length	of	the	
reef	 and	 is	 the	 sole	 type	 present	 in	 the	 western	 half.	 A	 stockwork	 of	 barren	 quartz‐pyrite	 veining	 is	
present	in	the	wall	rocks	up	to	20m	away	from	the	reef.	
	
The	 blue‐grey	 cherty	 quartz	 and	 associated	 pyrite,	 arsenopyrite,	 loellingite	 and	 gold,	 with	 minor	
pyrrhotite,	galena,	chalcopyrite	and	rare	sphalerite	comprise	the	sulphide	ore	shoots	within	the	eastern	
half	of	the	reef.	
	
The	mineralized	vein	or	reef	has	a	thickness	of	0.5	–	4m	and	a	strike	extent	of	800m	(2).	The	western	half	
of	the	reef,	towards	the	Williams	Fault,	carries	sub‐economic	gold	grades,	with	gold	values	rarely	>	0.2g/t	
Au;	however,	the	gold	grades	are	not	truncated	by	the	fault	but	rather	decrease	towards	it.			
	
Sulphides	may	comprise	10‐40%	of	the	ore,	with	a	ratio	of	pyrite	to	arsenopyrite	between	2:1	and	5:1.	
Gold	forms	as	electrum	particles,	is	included	in	arsenopyrite	associated	with	galena,	with	arsenopyrite	on	
crystal	faces	or	as	fracture	fillings	within	the	arsenopyrite.	Within	the	"ore	shoots"	gold	grades	typically	
vary	from	3g/t	to	30g/t	Au.		
	
No	significant	gold	mineralization	occurs	outside	of	the	defined	quartz‐sulphide	reef.	Within	the	open	cut	
the	 'central	 shoot'	 or	 main	 mineralized	 zone	 was	 located	 immediately	 west	 of	 the	 vertically	 dipping,	
south‐southwest	striking	Crabb	Fault,	which	is	the	main	structural	feature	along	the	eastern	margin	of	the	
deposit	(Figure	7.34	and	Figure	7‐35).	The	sub‐vertical	Williams	Fault	marks	the	western	margin	of	the	
portion	of	the	reef	mined	in	the	open	pit.	The	Williams	Fault	has	a	similar	orientation	to	the	Crabb	Fault	
with	a	vertical	throw	of	approximately	20m.	
	
Numerous	narrow	lamprophyre	dykes	have	been	intersected	in	drilling	and	are	visible	in	the	wall	of	the	
open	pit.	The	dykes	are	thought	to	be	sub‐parallel	to	the	Crabb	and	Williams	Faults.	The	dykes	are	locally	
well	mineralized	when	in	contact	with	the	reef.	Down‐dip	drilling	beyond	the	pit	extremities	has	located	
what	 is	 interpreted	 to	 be	 a	 series	 of	 echelon	 shoots,	 which	 mimic	 the	 orientation	 of	 the	 regional	
deformation,	plunging	along	220°.	
	
The	reef	has	not	been	located	beyond	the	eastern	contact	with	the	intrusive	Mount	Goyder	Syenite.

7.4.2 	MOUNT	BUNDY	(RUSTLERS	ROOST)	DEPOSIT		

	
The	following	information	is	derived	from	Payne	(2004)	who	obtained	the	information		from	Goulevitch,	
2004b:	
	
Gold	mineralization	at	Rustler's	Roost	 is	hosted	by	a	600	meter	 thick	water‐lain	 sequence	of	 interbedded	
sediments	 and	 volcanoclastics	which	 belong	 to	 the	 South	Alligator	Group	 of	Palaeo‐proterozoic	 age.	The	
sequence	can	be	subdivided	 into	six	distinct	stratigraphic	units	on	the	basis	of	dominant	rock‐types	which	
include	 laminated	 dolomitic	 carbonaceous	 chloritic	 pyritic	 siltstone‐shale	 and	 sulphidic	 laminated	 and	
nodular	chert	beds,	greywacke‐shale	of	turbiditic	origin	and	volcanoclastics	(pyroclastic	sub‐aerial	tuffs	and	
lapilli	tuffs,	epiclastic	tuffaceous	siltstones	and	tuffaceous	sandstones)	
	
Volcaniclastics	are	present	 in	all	of	the	 laminated	sequences	at	Rustler's	Roost	with	 increasing	abundance	
passing	down	 the	stratigraphy.	Coarser	grained	and	coarser	 textured	volcaniclastics	have	been	previously	
mislabeled	as	greywackes	which	accounts	 for	the	prominence	of	greywacke	units	 in	all	early	stratigraphic	
columns	for	Rustler's	Roost.	
	
The	lower	part	of	the	sequence	includes	the	Below	Dolly	Pot	Sequence	(>50	meters),	the	Dolly	Pot	Sequence	
(100‐120	meters)	and	the	Dolly	Pot	Cover	Sequence	(30‐40	meters).	These	units	are	comprised	of	a	mixture	
of	 laminated	 sediments	 and	 volcaniclastics.	Volcaniclastics	 dominate	 the	 upper	 and	 lower	 units	whereas	
laminated	sediments	dominate	the	intervening	Dolly	Pot	Sequence.

The	upper	part	of	the	mine	sequence	includes	the	Beef	Bucket	Sequence	(120‐150	meters),	the	Beef	Bucket	
Cover	 Sequence	 (130‐150	meters)	 and	 the	 Backhoe	 Sequence	 and	 is	 comprised	 of	 interlayered	 units	 of	
laminated	siltstone‐shale‐chert	(and	minor	volcaniclastics)	and	greywacke‐siltstone‐shale.	The	Beef	Bucket	
Cover	Sequence	is	comprised	predominantly	of	greywacke‐siltstone‐shale	of	turbiditic	origin	though	it	does	
include	a	 relatively	 thin	 laminated	 sediment	unit.	 In	contrast,	 the	Beef	Bucket	Sequence	and	 the	Backhoe	
Sequence	are	dominated	by	laminated	siltstone‐shale‐chert	with	minor	volcaniclastics.		
	
The	sedimentary	sequences	are	strongly	folded	about	north‐northeast	trending	regional	F1	fold	axes.		These	
folds	are	open	to	tight	in	style	and	plunge	consistently	to	the	south	at	approximately	35°.	
	
The	bulk	of	 the	gold	mineralization	at	Rustler's	Roost	occurs	on	 the	W‐SW	dipping	 fold	 limb	between	 the	
Backhoe	Syncline	to	the	west	and	Dolly	Pot	Anticline	to	the	east,	though	some	mineralization	in	the	Dolly	Pot	
Sequence	does	extend	east	across	 the	axis	of	 the	Dolly	Pot	Anticline;	and	 some	mineralization	 in	 the	Beef	
Bucket	and	Backhoe	Sequences	does	extend	to	the	west	limb	of	the	Backhoe	Syncline.	
	
A	strong	stratigraphic	control	on	the	gold	mineralization	at	Rustler's	Roost	was	recognized	very	early	and	
this	was	reinforced	by	later	exploration	and	mining.	But	just	how	tight	the	stratigraphic	control	has	only	just	
been	realized	as	a	result	of	core	drilling	undertaken	in	2003.	This	is	probably	due	to	the	fact	that	most	of	the	
early	 exploration	was	 in	 oxidized	 ground	 and	most	 of	 the	 exploration	 between	 1994‐1996	was	with	 RC	
percussion	drilling	with	minimum	sample	intervals	of	1	meter.	
	
Comparison	 of	 assay	 data	 from	 the	 better	mineralized	 holes	 in	 the	 2003	 core	 drilling	program	with	 the	
geology	 of	 the	 individual	 assay	 intervals,	 has	 revealed	 that	 in	 the	Beef	Bucket	 and	Dolly	 Pot	 Sequences,	
elevated	gold	results	(>0.5	g/t	Au	over	2	meter	intervals)	were	obtained	mostly	from	intervals	which	contain	
one	or	more	sulphidic	chert	beds.	These	are	generally	only	5‐20	centimeters	thick	and	less	commonly	20‐40	
centimeters	 thick	and	 comprise	only	10‐20%	of	 the	 sample	 interval.	There	 is	 little	 evidence	of	any	 other	
significant	sediment	host	to	mineralization	in	the	intervals.	
	
There	 is	 also	 evidence	 that	 the	 strongest	 gold	 mineralization	 in	 the	 laminated	 sediment	 sequences	 is	
spatially	and	genetically	associated	with	a	set	of	thin	(1‐3	centimeters),	widely	spaced	(1‐3	meters),	parallel,	
pyritic	quartz	veins	("sheeted	veins")	which	occur	widely	throughout	the	mine.	According	to	pit	mapping	and	
drill	 core,	 these	 veins	 dip	 to	 the	 SE	 at	 15‐25	 degrees,	 at	 least	 between	 the	 axis	 of	 the	 two	major	 fold	
structures.	
	
Significant	gold	mineralization	appears	 to	be	 truncated	at	 the	 south	 end	of	 the	deposit	by	 the	 east‐west	
trending	Sunset	Fault.		The	post‐mineralization	Broken	Nose	Fault	trends	NE‐SW	across	the	gold	deposit	and	
apparently	displaces	the	mineralized	units	dextrally	about	50‐70m	in	plan	view.		East	dipping	reverse	faults	
have	been	identified	in	the	walls	of	the	open	pit	but	the	relationship	of	these	to	the	gold	mineralization	has	
not	been	fully	characterized.	
	
Gold	mineralization	is	strongly	associated	with	pyrite	and	to	a	lesser	extent	with	arsenopyrite.		Coarse	grains	
of	gold	are	rare.

8 DEPOSIT 	TYPES 	 	

	
The	 contribution	 from	 gold	 deposits	 in	 Proterozoic	 sedimentary	 basins	 to	 total	 gold	 production	 has	
increased	markedly	over	the	past	two	decades,	both	globally	and	within	Proterozoic	basins	in	Australia.	
Consequently,	many	Proterozoic	basins	are	now	considered	high	priority	exploration	targets.	
	

8.1 	ORE	DEPOSIT	MODELS	

	
A	 variety	 of	 genetic	 models,	 ranging	 from	 magmatic	 through	 hydrothermal	 to	 syngenetic,	 have	 been	
postulated	 in	 the	past	 for	 the	 formation	of	 gold	deposits	 in	 the	Pine	Creek	Geosyncline.	Gold	and	base	
metal	mineralization	in	the	Pine	Creek	Geosyncline	is	commonly	associated	with	granite	 intrusions	and	
have	often	been	classified	as	high	temperature	contact	aureole	deposits.	A	secondary	host	rock	control	
has	 also	 been	 suggested	 due	 to	 the	 association	 of	 gold	 mineralization	 with	 carbonaceous	
metasedimentary	rocks.	
	
However,	much	of	 the	gold	mineralization	occurred	after	 the	main	 intrusive	event,	 the	 intrusion	of	 the	
Cullen	 Batholith,	 and	 the	 relationship	 of	 gold	 mineralization	 and	 carbonaceous	 rocks	 is	 not	 the	 most	
important	 control	 on	 mineralization.	 More	 recently,	 authors	 have	 argued	 that	 gold	 mineralization	 is	
structurally	 controlled,	 occurring	 in	 brittle‐ductile	 structures	 at	 the	 greenschist‐amphibole	 facies	
boundary	and	hence	has	an	epigenetic	origin	(Partington	&	McNaughton,	1997).	
	
In	 places,	 e.g.	 the	 Cosmo‐Howley	 area,	 duplex	 thrust	 folds	 with	 buckle	 folding	 or	 basin	 and	 dome	
structures	appear	to	be	more	significantly	mineralized.	The	presence	of	shear	systems	linking	anticlines	
higher	in	the	sequence	also	appears	to	have	provided	the	ideal	fluid	focusing	mechanisms	to	localize	gold‐
bearing	fluids.		
	
Accepting	 that	 gold	 deposits	 of	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 have	 a	 structurally	 controlled	 mesothermal	
setting,	then	on	the	basis	of	host	rock	and	mineral	association	they	can	be	divided	into	seven	types:	

 Gold‐quartz	veins,	lodes,	sheeted	veins,	stockworks,	saddle	reefs	(Pine	Creek	Orogen)	
 Gold‐ironstone	bodies	(Tennant	Inlier)	
 Gold	in	iron	rich	sediments	(Pine	Creek	Orogen,	Tanami)	
 Polymetallic	deposits	(Iron	Blow,	Mt	Bonnie)	
 Gold‐PGE	deposits	(South	Alligator	River	area)	
 Uranium‐gold	deposits	(Pine	Creek	Orogen,	Murphy	Inlier)	
 Placer		deposits	

	
Over	half	of	the	gold	occurrences	are	gold‐quartz	vein	deposits.	
	
Native	gold	is	the	main	ore	mineral	and	is	commonly	present	as	micron	sized	grains;	coarse	nuggets	are	
rare.	Gold	is	commonly	associated	with	pyrite,	arsenopyrite	and	pyrrhotite	and	in	places	with	minor	base	
metal	sulphides.	Quartz,	 chlorite,	sericite	and	carbonates	are	 the	common	gangue	minerals	 in	 the	gold‐
quartz	deposits.	
	
All	 gold	 deposits	 in	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 show	 some	 structural	 control	 at	 the	 regional	 and	 deposit	
scales,	with	most	deposits	within	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	trending	northwest‐southeast.	Base	metal	veins	
in	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	strike	significantly	differently	than	the	gold	veins,	suggesting	different	discrete	
mineralizing	events.

Most	deposits	 show	a	preference	 for	 competency	contrast	 situations	 in	dilatant	or	 low	pressure	zones,	
such	as	anticlinal	crests,	recurrent	shear	zones	and	necking	zones.	Gold	mineralization	is	invariably	late,	
occurring	after	orogenic	events.	
	
Common	factors	for	most	gold	deposits	include:	
	

 Gold	deposits	are	nearly	all	 in	 low‐grade,	 sub‐greenschist	 to	 lower	greenschist	 facies	regionally	
metamorphosed	sediments	(commonly	greywacke‐siltstone‐shale)	

 Anticlinal	hinges	and	shear	zones	are	generally	the	most	favourable	loci	
 Subsequent	to	regional	metamorphism	and	deformation,	the	metasediments	were	intruded	by	I‐

type	granite	and	the	gold	mineralization	are	within	the	contact	metamorphic	aureole	
 Fluid	 inclusion	data	 suggest	 the	 involvement	of	moderate	 to	high	 salinity	 fluids	 in	 temperature	

range	from	200	‐	300°C	
 Stable	isotope	data	suggest	a	magmatic/metamorphic	origin	of	these	fluids	

	
Five	main	types	of	mineralization	have	previously	been	recognized	within	or	in	proximity	to	the	Northern	
Territory	Gold	Properties.		These	are:	
	

 Sheeted	 and	 stockwork	quartz	 vein	 systems	 located	along	major	 anticlinal	hinges	 in	 the	Mount	
Bonnie	and	Burrell	Creek	Formations	and	to	a	lesser	extent,	the	Gerowie	Tuff.	 	Mineralization	is	
hosted	 by	 carbonaceous	 or	 sulphidic	 host	 rocks	 (Woolwonga)	 or	 along	 zones	 of	 competency	
contrast	 between	 greywacke	 and	 shale	 (Enterprise,	 Union	 Reefs,	 Goodall,	 Alligator,	 Faded	 Lily,	
Howley,	 Big	 Howley,	 Yam	 Creek	 and	 Fountain	 Head)	 or	 dolerite	 (Bridge	 Creek).	 	 Axial	 planar	
quartz	 veins	 have	 been	 identified	 in	 some	deposits	 (Enterprise	 and	Woolwonga).	 	 Stratabound	
quartz	reefs	occur	in	most	of	these	deposits,	and	may	develop	into	saddle	reefs	along	fold	hinge	
zones	(Enterprise,	Union	Reefs	and	Fountain	Head);	

	
 Sediment‐hosted	 stratiform	 gold	 mineralization	 and	 quartz‐sulphide‐vein‐hosted	 stratabound	

gold	mineralization	 in	 cherty	 ironstone	and	carbonaceous	mudstones	of	 the	Koolpin	Formation	
(Tom's	Gully,	Cosmo	Howley	and	Rising	Tide)	or	the	Gerowie	Tuff	(Brocks	Creek);	
	

 Stratiform,	 massive	 to	 banded,	 sulphide‐silicate‐carbonate	 mineralization	 in	 the	Mount	 Bonnie	
Formation	(Mt	Bonnie	and	Iron	Blow);		

	
 Sediment‐hosted	 stratiform	 and	 stratabound	 gold	 mineralization	 in	 cherty,	 dolomitic	 and	

sulphidic	 shales	 of	 the	Mount	 Bonnie	 Formation,	with	 sheeted	 quartz‐sulphide	 veins	 (Rustler's	
Roost);	and		

	
 Sheeted	or	stockwork	quartz‐feldspar‐sulphide	veins	hosted	by	Zamu/Maud	Creek	Dolerite	sills	

(Maud	Creek,	Howley	Howley	South,	Bridge	Creek	and	Kazi).	
	

Most	 gold	mineralization	 in	 the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	occurs	within	 the	 South	Alligator	Group,	 especially	
above	the	Middle	Koolpin	Formation,	and	in	the	lower	parts	of	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation.		Most	of	the	
fold‐associated	 deposits	were	 probably	 formed	 during	 intrusion	 of	 granitoids	 such	 as	 the	 synorogenic	
Cullen	Batholith	and	the	Burnside	Granite.	
	
The	most	important	regional‐scale	exploration	vectors	to	the	orogenic	style	of	gold	mineralization	are:

 The	position	of	 the	biotite	 isograd	 in	 the	contact‐metamorphic	aureole	of	 the	Cullen	granitoids.	
The	 biotite	 isograd	 needs	 to	 be	 mapped	 out	 carefully	 in	 areas	 of	 exploration	 interest	 and	
exploration	focused	on	the	biotite‐albite	epidote	contact‐metamorphic	zone	

	
 NNW‐NW	oriented	anticlinal	axes	appear	to	be	the	most	productive.	However,	exploration	cannot	

be	totally	restricted	to	anticlines	in	this	orientation,	as	other	anticlines	or	even	synclines	may	be	
mineralized	

	
 Strongly	 interbedded	 and	 contrasting	 rock	 types	 (e.g.,	 greywacke‐siltstone)	 particularly	 in	 the	

upper	parts	of	the	stratigraphy	in	the	Mount	Bonnie	and	Burrell	Creek	Formations	in	particular	
	

 Carbonaceous	 or	 iron‐rich	 lithologies	 in	 proximity	 to	 indications	 of	 gold	 mineralization.	 Such	
lithologies	 and	any	veins	within	 them	need	 to	be	mapped	out	 carefully	 to	help	 locate	potential	
trap	sites	for	economic	gold	mineralization.

8.2 	STRUCTURAL	MODELS	

	
Regional	structural	interpretations	have	attempted	to	create	a	structural	model	to	categorize	the	styles	of	
mineralization	found	in	the	Pine	Creek	Inlier	(Table	8‐1).	In	the	Burnside	Project	area	much	of	the	known	
mineralization	is	related	to	the	15km	wide	contact	aureole	around	the	Cullen	Batholith	(Figure	8‐2)	
	

	
	

FIGURE	8‐2	BURNSIDE	PROJECT	AREA	–	SIMPLIFIED	STUCTURAL	INTERPRETATION	AROUND	THE	CULLEN	
BATHOLITH	

Note:	magnetic	base	map	

	
Analysis	of	the	structural	regime	shows	that	the	better	mineralization	is	located	within	dilation	zones,	in	
the	hinge	zones	of	 antiform,	e.g.	Brocks	Creek	 (Table	8‐1‐	 (iii))	or	as	 stratabound	mineralization	on	 the	
flanks	 of	 anticlines,	 e.g.	 Cosmo,	Howley	 (Table	 8‐1	 –	 (iv)).	 Targets	with	 potential	 for	moderate	 tonnage	
orebodies	at	moderate	to	elevated	grades,	e.g.	Fountain	Head	(Table	8‐1	(ii))	and	Rising	Tide,	Kazi	(Table	
8‐1–	 (i))	 are	 located	 within	 compressive	 structural	 settings	 with	 multiple	 phases	 of	 deformation	 and	
mineralization	which	is	discordant	to	the	stratigraphy.

8.3 	GOLD‐URANIUM	MINERALIZATION	

	
Significant	gold	mineralization	is	associated	with	world	class	uranium	deposits,	particularly	in	the	South	
Alligator	River	 region	of	 the	eastern	Pine	Creek	 Inlier.	Bonanza	grade	gold	mineralization	was	reported	
while	mining	high	grade	pitchblende	mineralization	in	the	1950s	and	1960s	but	since	the	discovery	of	high	
grade	gold	mineralization	associated	with	the	Jabiluka	II	orebody	in	the	late	1970s	there	has	been	more	
attention	paid	to	this	style	of	mineralization.	
	
The	Jabiluka	uranium‐gold	deposit	is	located	20km	north	of	Jabiru,	to	the	east	of	the	Tom's	Gully	Deposit.	
In	1998,	North	Limited	reported	"resources"1	(non	NI43‐101compliant)	of	19.53	Mt	of	ore	grading	0.46%	
U3O8	and	a	gold	resource	(non	NI43‐101)	of	1.1Mt	at	10.7g/t	Au;	while	these	numbers	are	not	current,	they	
are	indicative	of	the	gold	grades	present	(Ahmad	et	al,	2001).		
	
Gold	has	also	been	located	at	the	Koongarra	and	Ranger	uranium	deposits	and	gold	and	platinum	group	
elements	have	also	been	located	at	Coronation	Hill	(Nicholson	&	Eupene,	1990).	
	
This	 mineralization	 is	 characteristically	 associated	 with	 the	 Early/Middle	 Proterozoic	 unconformity	
surface	or	with	 late	 orogenic	 acid	 volcanics	 and	 sediments	deposited	on	 that	 surface.	 There	 is	 a	 strong	
structural	 and	 stratigraphic	 control	 on	 the	 mineralization	 and	 an	 association	 with	 ferromagnesian	
metasomatic	alteration	(chloritization,	magnetitization,	hematitization).	
	
In	2009‐2010	Thundelarra	Exploration	reports	that	uranium	mineralization	at	the	Thunderball	deposit	in	
the	Pine	Creek	area	appears	to	be	shear	hosted	and	consists	of	massive	veins	and	disseminated	uraninite	
(pitchblende).	The	mineralized	zone	is	in	an	anticline	that	plunges	to	the	north	at	approximately	40°	and	
remains	open	down	plunge.	

	
NB:	(1)	The	resource	estimate	cited	is	sourced	from	the	reference	indicated,	is	believed	to	be	a	historical	estimate,	not	prepared	in	
accordance	with	 currently	accepted	guidelines	 for	 the	preparation	of	mineral	 resources	and	mineral	 reserves,	may	not	 comply	
with	NI43‐101	and	is	not	considered	by	either	the	Authors	or	Crocodile	Gold,	as	current	Mineral	Resources	or	Mineral	Reserves.	

8.4 	POLYMETALLIC 	DEPOSITS	

	
The	 know	 polymetallic	 deposits,	 which	 include	 the	 Iron	 Blow	 and	 Mount	 Bonnie	 contain	 interbedded	
pyritic	shale,	dolomitic	siltsone	and	tuff	of	the	Mount	Bonnie	Formation.	They	contain	significant	amounts	
of	zinc,	lead,	copper,	silver	and	gold.		
	
The	 largest	 base	 metal	 mine	 within	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Orogen	 was	 the	 Woodcutters	 mine	 located	
approximately	47	km	southwest	of	the	Tom's	Gully	Mine.	It	produced	4.65Mt	grading	12.3%	Zn,	5.6%	Pb,	
and	87	g/t	Ag	from	1985‐1999.	It	is	hosted	by	a	tight	anticlinal	fold	within	the	Whites	Formation(dolomitic	
shale).	The	anticline	is	faulted	along	its	axis	and	intruded	by	lamprophyre	dykes.	Several	thin	tabular	en	
echelon	bodies	of	sulphides	developed	over	a	strike	length	of	1.4km.	The	deposit	is	considered	epigenetic.	
There	are	possibilities	it	may	be	remobilized	from	an	initial	stratiform	zone.

8.5 	IRON	OXIDE 	COPPER	GOLD	STYLE 	DEPOSITS	

	

Although	no	specific	IOCG	type	deposit	has	been	identified	in	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	there	is	no	reason	why	
this	type	of	deposit	should	not	be		present.	There	has	been	increased	success	in	finding	uranium,	copper	and	
other	base	metals	and	some	thought	should	be	given	to	determining	if	the	IOCG	model	can	be	applied	in	this	
area.	Regional	geophysical	surveys	should	assist	in	identifying	such	targets.	Any	future	exploration	efforts	
should	keep	this	model	in	mind.

9 MINERALIZATION 	

	
Detailed	descriptions	of	 the	key	gold	deposits	within	 the	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	are	
included	 in	 Section	 7.2	 of	 this	 report.	 A	 brief	 summary	 overview	 of	 the	 mineralization	 style	 is	
presented	below.	

9.1 	BURNSIDE 	GOLD 	&	BASE 	METALS 	PROJECT	

	
The	 Burnside	 project	 contains	 numerous	 gold	 deposits	 that	 are	 scattered	 throughout	 the	 western	 and	
southern	 portions	 of	 the	 project	 area.	 	 For	 the	 purposes	 of	 this	 report,	 these	 deposits	 can	 be	 broadly	
divided	 into	 three	main	 groups,	 namely	 the	Howley	 Group,	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 ‐	 Zapopan	Group	 and	 the	
Hayes	Creek	Group.		
	

9.1.1 	HOWLEY	GROUP	DEPOSITS	

	
The	Howley	Group	deposits	comprise	the	largest	gold	deposits	of	the	Burnside	project	and	are	situated	in	
the	southwestern	portion	of	the	project	area.		The	Howley	Group	deposits	are	situated	along	the	northwest	
and	southeast	plunging	Howley	Anticline,	a	tight	to	inclined	antiform	that	extends	northwest	along	strike	
from	the	former	Cosmo	Howley	mine	for	approximately	24	km.		The	gold	mineralization	along	the	Howley	
Anticline	occurs	as	a	series	of	sub‐vertical	quartz	veins	within	axial	planar	structures	in	sedimentary	units	
of	the	Koolpin	Formation,	the	Gerowie	Tuff,	the	Mount	Bonnie	Formation	and	along	sheared	margins	of	the	
Zamu	Dolerite.			
	
There	appears	to	be	preferential	mineralization	of	iron	carbonate	(ironstone)	sedimentary	units	along	the	
Howley	Anticline.		Gold	mineralization	is	stratiform	and	is	structurally	controlled	by	thrust	faults	and	axial	
planar	cleavage.		
	
From	south	to	north,	the	significant	deposits	currently	defined	along	the	Howley	Anticline	include	Cosmo	
Deeps,	Howley	South	Extended,	Howley,	Mottrams,	Bridge	Creek,	Western	Arm,	Kazi	and	Bon's	Rush.			
	
Gold	mineralization	in	the	Mottrams	deposit	is	constrained	to	the	western	limb	of	the	Howley	Anticline	and	
is	contained	in	narrow	lodes.		
	
The	mineralization	is	contained	in	2‐5	cm	quartz	veins	that	strike	307°/70°	NE	(Mine	Grid).	These	are	en‐
echelon	 quartz	 veins	 that	 are	 oblique	 to	 the	 bedding	 related	 to	 cleavage	 	 associated	 with	 the	 Howley	
Anticline.	The	higher	density	veins	appear	to	be	constrained	to	distinct	1‐2m	wide	units	(density	would	be	
~2/1m).	The	surrounding	units	contain	quartz	veins	of	similar	orientations	and	dimensions	but	the	density	
is	 1/2m.	 These	 surrounding	 units	 have	 thin	 quartz	 veins	 that	 appear	 parallel	 to	 bedding.	 Lodes	 contain	
varying	degrees	of	quartz,	pyrite,	arsenopyrite,	minor	pyrrhotite	and	sericite	alteration.	

Bedding	throughout	the	pit	is	consistently	striking	002°‐007°/70°	west	(mine	Grid).	

The	 plunge	 of	 the	 mineralization	 is	 10‐15	 degree	 to	 the	 north,	 which	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 the	
Howley	trend	mineralization.

9.1.2 HAYES	CREEK	GROUP	DEPOSITS	

	
The	 Hayes	 Creek	 Group	 deposits	 are	 located	 in	 the	 southeastern	 portion	 of	 the	 Burnside	 Gold	 Project.	
Currently	the	most	significant	deposits	of	 the	Hayes	Creek	Group	comprise	the	Fountain	Head,	Tally	Ho,	
Yam	Creek,	North	Point	and	Princess	Louise	deposits.			
	

9.1.3 	IRON	BLOW	DEPOSIT	

	
The	Iron	Blow	Deposit	is	located	in	the	very	southeastern	part	of	the	Burnside	Gold	project	immediately	
south	of	the	Hayes	Creek	Group	Deposits.		The	deposit	occurs	on	the	western	limb	of	the	Margret	Syncline	
and	is	hosted	by	interbedded	siltstone,	slaty	shale	(both	pyritic	and	carbonaceous),	greywacke,	hornfels,	
chert	and	minor	conglomerate	and	carbonate	rocks	of	the	Mount	Bonnie	Formation.	
	
The	mineralization	 consists	 of	 a	massive	 sulphide‐carbonate‐silicate	 assemblage	with	 a	 distinct,	 bedding	
parallel	mineral	foliation.	Mineralization	occurs	within	steep	southeast	dipping	stacked	lenses,	separated	by	
several	meters	of	host	rock	which	may	show	evidence	of	hydrothermal	alteration.	Mineralization	generally	
occurs	 in	the	form	of	massive	sphalerite	and	pyrite,	whereas	chalcopyrite,	pyrite	and	galena	appear	to	be	
disseminated.	Replacement	 textures	were	noted	 locally.	Due	 to	 the	presence	of	pyrrhotite,	 the	 individual	
lenses	 are	 strongly	 magnetic.	 Strong	 carbonate	 alteration	 has	 consistently	 been	 observed	 immediately	
down‐hole	of	the	mineralized	zones.	
	

9.1.4 	MOUNT	BONNIE	DEPOSIT	

	
The	Mount	Bonnie	deposit	lies	on	the	eastern	limb	of	the	Margret	syncline	at	the	same	stratigraphic	level	as	
the	Iron	Blow	Deposit.	The	host	rocks	are	similar	to	those	at	Iron	Blow.	The	one	lense	defined	to	date	dips	to	
the	west	at	40°	and	 is	up	to	15	meters	 thick.	The	deposit	displays	a	distinct	 localized	magnetic	signature	
very	similar	in	character	to	the	Iron	Blow	Deposit.	Common	sulphide	minerals		in	non‐oxidized	domains	are	
dominated	 by	 sphalerite	 and	 also	 include	 galena,	 arsenopyrite,	 pyrite,	 chalcopyrite,	 pyrrhotite	 and	
tetrahedrite.	Near	surface	oxide	mineralization	mainly	consists	of	hematite	and	limonitic	clay.	A	chalcocite	
enriched	supergene	copper	zone	is	reported	to	underlie	the	oxide	zone.	
	

9.1.5 BROCKS	CREEK	–	ZAPOPAN	GROUP	DEPOSITS	

	
The	Brocks	Creek	–	Zapopan	Group	deposits	occurs	along	the	northwest	trending	Brocks	Creek	–	Zapopan	
Anticline	which	is	centrally	located	within	the	Burnside	Gold	Project.		The	Brocks	Creek	–	Zapopan	Anticline	
is	cut	at	a	 low	angle	by	 the	Brocks	Creek	shear	zone	and	 lies	within	 the	 thermal	aureole	of	 the	Burnside	
Granite.	 	Several	deposits	are	 located	along	 the	west‐northwest	 trending	Brocks	Creek	shear	zone	within	
steeply	dipping	quartz‐pyrite‐arsenopyrite	veins	hosted	by	rocks	belonging	to	the	Gerowie	Tuff	and	Mount	
Bonnie	Formation.		Currently	the	most	significant	deposits	of	the	Brocks	Creek	–	Zapopan	Group	comprise	
the	Brocks	Creek/Zapopan	underground	and	Rising	Tide	deposits.

9.2 	UNION	REEF	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
The	 Union	 Reefs	 project	 contains	 numerous	 historical	workings	 developed	 over	 the	 northwest	 striking	
Pine	Creek	Shear	Zone	and	the	associated	Union	and	Lady	Alice	Lines.		Known	gold	mineralization	extends	
over	a	length	of	3.5	km,	400	m	width	and	to	a	vertical	depth	of	300	m.		The	Lady	Alice	Line	follows	the	axis	
of	 the	 Lady	 Alice	 Anticline,	 with	 the	majority	 of	 workings	 developed	 on	 the	western	 limb	 of	 this	 fold.	
Mineralization	is	associated	with	quartz‐sulphide	veining,	comprising	1	mm	to	2	m	thick	lode‐style	veins	
(in	 sheared	 pelites),	 stockwork	 veins	 (in	 greywacke)	 and	 sheeted‐vein	 systems	 (in	 thinly	 interbedded	
pelites	and	psammites).		The	three	veins	styles	may	occur	separately	or	coalesce.		The	lodes	generally	crop	
out	as	en‐echelon,	northwest	plunging	lenses	parallel	to	near	vertical	shears	trending	010°,	330°	and	355°.		
Steeply	plunging	saddle	reefs	up	to	3	m	thick	are	zoned	with	mineralized	vein	selvedges.	
	
Pervasive	wall	rock	alteration	is	best	developed	in	psammites	and	typically	comprises	quartz‐muscovite‐
chlorite‐arsenopyrite‐pyrite±dolomite.	 Gold	 is	 also	 best	 developed	 in	 psammite,	 in	 part	 reflecting	 the	
increased	amounts	of	 veining	and	arsenopyrite	within	 the	psammite.	Veins	are	principally	 composed	of	
quartz,	 dolomite	 and	 chlorite.	 	 Primary	 sulphides	 are	 pyrite,	 arsenopyrite,	 galena,	 sphalerite,	marcasite	
and	pyrrhotite.	 	Gold	 is	present	as	small	 free	grains	and	submicroscopic	 inclusions	 in	sulphides.	 	Coarse	
visible	gold	is	largely	restricted	to	the	selvedges	of	larger	quartz	veins	and	is	present	as	single	grains	and	
clusters	to	5	mm	diameter	in	cracks	within	quartz	veins.			
	
Currently	the	most	significant	deposits	within	the	Union	Reefs	project	are	the	Lady	Alice,	Esmeralda	and	
Prospect	Claim	deposits.	
	

9.3 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
The	Pine	Creek	project	overlies	a	1	km	wide	by	6	km	long,	northwest	trending	belt	centered	500	m	to	the	
west	of	the	Pine	Creek	Township.		It	includes	numerous	alluvial	and	hard	rock	mine	workings	developed	
along	 and	 adjacent	 to	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Shear	 Zone.	 	 This	 shear	 zone	 is	 hosted	 by	 sheared	 and	 contact	
metamorphosed	greywacke	and	phyllite	units	of	 the	Mount	Bonnie	 and	Burrell	Creek	Formations.	 	This	
sequence	has	 been	 folded	 about	 the	 Enterprise,	 Czarina	 and	Kohinoor	Anticlines.	 	 The	 axes	 of	 all	 three	
anticlines	trend	320°	to	340°	and	plunge	15°	to	55°	to	the	southeast.	
	
Mineralization	 at	 Pine	 Creek	 is	 associated	 with	 veins	 of	 quartz	 or	 quartz‐sulphide,	 as	 well	 as	 being	
structurally	 controlled	with	 saddle	 reefs	 and	 discordant	 quartz	 veins	 in	 faults	 and	 shear	 zones.	 	Minor	
amounts	of	gold	are	also	disseminated	in	the	wall	rock	adjacent	to	quartz	veins.		Hossfeld	(1936)	listed	16	
saddle	 reefs	 comprising	 eight	 in	 the	 Enterprise	 Anticline,	 three	 in	 the	 Czarina	 Anticline	 and	 five	 in	 the	
Kohinoor	Anticline.		The	western	limb	of	these	reefs	is	usually	more	persistent	laterally	and	at	depth.			
	
The	 most	 significant	 deposits	 currently	 outlined	 within	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 project	 are	 the	 Enterprise	 and	
Czarina	deposits.

[133]	
	

Structural	 features	 such	 as	 shears,	 faults,	 associated	 brecciation,	 geological	 contacts	 and	 competency	
contrast	between	the	different	rock	types	principally	control	the	mineralization	associated	with	the	Maud	
Creek	deposit.	These	structures	include;	
	

 the	 graphitic	 Main	 Zone	 Shear	 overlying	 the	 sandstone,	 associated	 with	 the	 variably	 silicified	
sulphidic	carbonaceous	sediment;	

 the	interpreted	sub‐vertical	shear	zone	located	along	the	contact	of	the	sub‐vertical	dolerite;	and	
 the	 intersection	 of	 these	 two	 shears,	 where	 a	 broad	 zone	 of	 brecciation	 and	 associated	

mineralization	occurs.	
	

Widths	of	mineralization	are	usually	influenced	by	the	intensity	of	deformation	such	as	shearing,	faulting	
and	associated	brecciation.	This	may	range	from	several	meters	to	50	m	in	true	width.	
	
The	principal	 portion	of	 the	deposit	 is	 250	m	 long,	 up	 to	57	m	wide,	 open	 at	 depth,	 striking	north	 and	
dipping	at	60°	to	the	east.		The	strike	extensions	of	this	mineralized	Main	Zone	lode	are	open	to	the	north	
where	 previous	 near‐surface	 drilling	 over	 a	 >800	 m	 strike	 length	 has	 intersected	 a	 similar	 style	 of	
mineralization,	 though	 at	 lower	 grades	 and	 widths.	 To	 the	 south	 the	 mineralization	 is	 most	 probably	
truncated	and	off‐set	by	a	cross	fault.	
	
The	Main	Zone	mineralization	at	the	surface	outcrop	extends	for	150	m	strike	and	is	typically	10	to	20	m	
thick.	Approximately	80%	of	the	mineralization	has	been	defined	in	the	Main	Zone,	which	is	open	at	depth.	
	

9.5 	MOLINE 	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
Mineralization	 at	 Moline	 is	 found	 within	 two	main	 sequences	 of	 metasediments	 of	 the	 South	 Alligator	
Group.	Within	 the	project	 area,	metasediments	 are	 isoclinally	 folded	 about	 axes	 plunging	 at	 low	 angles	
towards	 the	 southeast.	 	 These	 folds	 are	 intersected	 by	 west	 dipping	 shear	 zones	 trending	 between	
northwest‐southeast	 to	 north‐south	 which	 control	 the	 ore	 shoots	 hosting	 pyrite,	 gold	 and	 base	 metal	
mineralization.			
	
The	Hercules	shear	which	contained	the	Hercules	Reef	cross	cuts	the	stratigraphy	and	trends	345°	in	the	
north	of	the	pit,	but	swings	to	trend	315°	(sub	parallel	to	stratigraphy	and	locally	known	as	the	Carolina	
Reef)	 in	 the	 south	of	 the	pit	and	continues	 through	School	Pit.	 	This	 structure	 is	mineralized	over	3	km	
strike	length	and	dips	steeply	(average	65°)	to	the	west.	 	Ore	shoots	pinch	and	swell	both	down	dip	and	
along	strike.	There	are	at	least	two	sub	parallel	but	weaker	mineralized	shears	in	the	hanging	wall.	
	
The	Hercules	pit	contains	three	ore	shoots	that	pitch	south	at	shallow	angles.		The	two	southern	shoots	are	
hosted	by	greywacke/siltstone	beds	within	a	synclinal	fold	plunging	to	the	southeast	across	the	pit,	while	
the	northern	shoot	is	contained	within	the	carbonaceous	shales	and	cherts.			
Mineralization	in	the	Hercules	Reef	is	in	dilational	breccia	zones	infilled	with	pyrite,	quartz,	country	rock	
fragments	and	variable	veinlets	of	sphalerite,	tetrahedrite,	arsenopyrite,	chalcopyrite	and	carbonates.	Gold	
occurs	as	fine	particles	(1	to	25	microns)	within	microfractures	in	pyrite	and	within	grains	of	sphalerite,	
pyrite	and	galena.	High	copper	grades	are	associated	with	higher	gold	grades.

[134]	
	

The	Evelyn	Deposit	 is	hosted	by	marble	and	calc‐silicate	hornfels	of	 the	Koolpin	Formation,	proximal	 to	
the	Allamar	Springs	Granite.	Mineralization	occurs	in	a	series	of	en	echelon	lodes	in	a	thick	marble	unit	at	
the	 base	 of	 the	 Koolpin.	 The	marble	 is	 interpreted	 to	 occupy	 the	 hinge	 area	 of	 a	 faulted,	 east	 trending	
anticline.		
	
The	tabular	lodes	dip	at	about	80°	to	the	east	and	are	up	to	4.5m	wide	and	80	meters	long.	They	are	noted	
to	pinch	and	swell	at	depth.	The	host	rocks	strike	290°	and	dip	to	the	north	at	50°.	

Primary	mineralization	consists	of	sphalerite,	galena,	pyrite,	minor	chalcopyrite,	arsenopyrite	and	rare	
pentlandite.		Pb,	Zn,	Ag,	Cd	and	Au	are	indicated	to	have	been	produced	from	this	small	deposit.	Oxidation	
in	the	area	is	reported	to	extend	to	depths	of	30	meters.	

Unconfirmed	production	figures	for	the	period	1966‐70	indicate	average	grades	of	6.1%	Zn,	5.8%	Pb	and	
260g/t	Ag.	It	is	estimated	that	about	83,000	tonnes	were	produced	in	this	time	frame	
	
There	are	indications	the	mine	was	also	in	production	in	the	1930's	for	a	short	period	of	time.	
	

9.6 	MOUNT 	BUNDY	PROJECT	AREA	

	

9.6.1 	TOM'S	GULLY	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
The	gold	mineralization	at	Tom's	Gully	is	confined	to	a	planar	quartz‐sulphide	vein	set	which	appears	to	be	
mesothermal	 in	 origin.	 The	 distribution	 of	 gold	 within	 the	 vein	 set	 is	 variable	 and	 pronounced	 higher	
grade	shoots	are	developed	within	the	vein	set.	These	have	been	the	focus	for	exploitation	of	the	deposit.	
	
The	 gold	 bearing	 reef	 comprises	 strongly	 laminated	 bands	 of	 quartz‐sulphide	 and	 lesser	 carbonaceous	
black	shale.	The	laminations	predominantly	occur	at	the	margins	of	the	reef.	The	mineralized	vein	or	reef	
has	a	thickness	of	0.5	–	4m	and	a	strike	extent	of	800m.	The	western	half	of	the	reef,	towards	the	Williams	
Fault,	carries	sub‐economic	gold	grades,	with	gold	values	rarely	>	0.2g/t	Au;	however,	the	gold	grades	are	
not	truncated	by	the	fault	but	rather	decrease	towards	it.			
	
Sulphides	may	comprise	10‐40%	of	 the	ore,	with	a	 ratio	of	pyrite	 to	arsenopyrite	between	2:1	and	5:1.	
Gold	forms	as	electrum	particles,	is	included	in	arsenopyrite	associated	with	galena,	with	arsenopyrite	on	
crystal	 faces	or	as	 fracture	fillings	within	the	arsenopyrite.	Within	the	"ore	shoots"	gold	grades	typically	
vary	from	3g/t	to	30g/t.		
	

9.6.2 	MT	BUNDY	(RUSTLER'S	ROOST)	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
Located	immediately	to	the	west	of	the	Tom's	Gully	Gold	Deposit,	the	Mt	Bundy	Gold	Deposit	is	a	sediment‐
hosted,	sheeted	and	stockwork	quartz‐sulphide‐vein	hosted	gold	deposit.		
	
The	host	sedimentary	units	predominantly	consist	of	shale	and	siltstone	with	minor	chert	and	greywacke.		
These	 units	 are	 strongly	 folded	 about	 tight	 north‐northeasterly	 trending	 southerly	 plunging	 folds.	 	 The	
deposit	is	located	at	the	nose	of	one	of	the	regional	south	plunging	anticlines.	Gold	mineralization	occurs

within	three	spatially	separate	stratigraphic	units,	primarily	on	the	western	 limb	of	 the	anticline,	over	a	
stratigraphic	thickness	of	at	least	300	m.	East‐west	trending	faulting	has	locally	offset	the	mineralization.	
Gold	occurs	as	 finely	disseminated	grains,	most	commonly	 in	cherty	quartz	 layers	where	stratigraphy	 is	
cut	by	quartz‐sulphide	veins;	coarse	gold	is	uncommon.

10.1 	THUNDELARRA	JV	

	
In	 September	 2009	 the	 Company	 announced	 drill	 results	 received	 from	 their	 joint	 venture	 partner	
Thundelarra	 Exploration	 Limited	with	 respect	 to	 the	 Thunderball	 Deposit.	 	 Assays	 include	 15	meters	 of	
1.5%	U3O8	including	1	meter	of	20.3%	U3O8	(448	lbs/t)	in	drill	hole	TPCRC019	which	represents	the	best	
intersection	 received	 to	 date	 and,	 according	 to	 Thundelarra,	 is	 among	 the	 highest	 grade	 uranium	
intersections	ever	announced	in	Australia.		
	
	Assays	from	the	four	reverse	circulation	drill	holes	completed	in	August	2009	at	the	Thunderball	uranium	
prospect	can	be	seen	in	the	following	table.

TABLE	10‐1	THUNDERBALL	DEPOSIT	DRILL	RESULTS	SEPTEMBER	2009	

 
Thundelarra	reports	that	mineralization	at	the	Thunderball	Deposit	appears	to	be	shear	hosted	and	consists	
of	massive	 veins	 and	 disseminated	 uraninite	 (pitchblende).	 The	mineralized	 zone	 is	 in	 an	 anticline	 that	
plunges	 to	 the	 north	 at	 approximately	 40°	 and	 remains	 open	 down	 plunge.	 The	 drilling	 to	 date	 has	
characterized	 the	 Thunderball	 deposit	 as	 having	 broad	 widths	 of	 stronger	 mineralization	 with	 visible	
secondary	uranium	minerals	overlain	by	anomalous	but	lower	grade	material	near	surface.	At	depth,	high	
grade	mineralization	has	been	 intersected	displaying	primary	uranium	minerals	within	a	well	developed	
shear	 zone.	 The	 drill	 results	 demonstrate	 this	 transition	 from	 shallow	 low	 grade	 uranium	 to	 high	 grade	
primary	mineralization	at	80	to	100	meters	below	surface.	Mapping	shows	that	the	mineralization	lies	close	
to	the	core	of	a	moderately	north‐northwest	plunging	anticline	in	Mt	Bonnie	Formation	metasediments.		
	
The	northern	area	of	the	Thunderball	area	has	returned	the	best	results	from	drilling	and	appears	to	have	
continuity	and	remains	open	at	depth.		
	
In	 early	 November	 2009	 additional	 assays	 were	 received	 from	 diamond	 drill	 hole	 TPCDD026	 which	
included	11	meters	of	3.4%	U3O8.	
	
In	December	2009	Thundelarra	announced	drill	results	that	included	12	meters	grading	6.185	ppm	U3O8	
(0.62%	U3O8)	 intersected	 in	drill	hole	TPCDD028	 from	161	meters	down	hole.	The	 intercept	consists	of	
multiple	shears	mineralized	with	blebby	disseminated	pitchblende.	The	hole	was	drilled	to	the	north	and

down‐plunge	from	the	high	grade	intercepts	reported	in	earlier	drill	holes	TPCRC019	and	TPCDD026	of	15	
meters	at	1.5%	U3O8	and	11	meters	at	3.4%	U3O8,	respectively.		
	
Drill	holes	TPCDD027	and	TPCDD030	tested	the	western	margin	of	the	Thunderball	prospect.	The	targeted	
structure	 hosts	 significant	 uranium	 levels	 in	 this	 area,	 although	 not	 as	 strongly	 mineralized	 as	 in	 the	
anticlinal	 core.	 The	 most	 northerly	 hole,	 TPCDD030,	 also	 intersected	 well	 developed	 mineralization	
returning	4.0	meters	grading	577	ppm	U3O8	at	 a	 shallower	depth,	 (Upper	Zone).	This	 is	 consistent	with	
several	other	holes	near	 the	northern	 limit	of	 the	drilling	and	suggests	 the	presence	of	a	second	 lens	of	
mineralization.

Overall,	seven	of	the	eight	holes	drilled	in	the	2009	program	produced	uranium	grades	in	excess	of	0.1%	
U3O8.	High	grade	uranium	was	defined	over	a	strike	length	exceeding	200	meters.		
	
Thundelarra	announced	that	eight	high	priority	uranium	targets	had	been	identified	by	interpretation	of	
data	from	a	detailed	low	level	airborne	radiometric	and	magnetometer	survey.	
	
The	 Thunderball	 uranium	prospect	 had	 previously	 been	 identified	 and	 is	 the	 only	 target	 that	 has	 been	
subject	to	extensive	drilling.	Highlights	of	previously	announced	drill	results	include:	
	

 1	meter	of	20.3%	U3O8	within	15	meters	of	1.5%	U3O8	
 4.6	meters	of	8.0%	U3O8	within	11	meters	of	3.4%	U3O8	
 12	meters	of	0.62%	U3O8	
 3	meters	of	0.66%	U3O8	

	
The	airborne	radiometric	and	magnetic	survey	is	the	most	detailed	survey	that	has	been	completed	to	date	
in	 the	 region.	 It	 has	 outlined	 new	 radiometric	 anomalies	 and	 has	 better	 defined	 several	 previously	
identified	targets.	The	survey	included	5,235	line	kilometers	spaced	at	25	meter	intervals	and	a	20	meter	
mean	terrain	clearance.	
	
A	plan	view	of	all	significant	intercepts	from	the	main	target	zone	at	the	Thunderball	deposit	can	be	seen

Assay	results	of	the	2010	RC	drilling	program	are	pending.	This	program	was	carried	out	over	three	target	
areas	that	displayed	either	anomalous	soil	geochemistry	and/or	anomalous	airborne	VTEM	responses	and	
/or	radiometric	anomalies.	
	
The	Anniversary	Breccia	target	area	is	located	in	the	Mt	Bundy	area		and	is	a	200m	long	zone	of	rubbly	and	
solid	 ironstone	breccia	exposure	which	shows	anomalous	uranium	up	to	100ppm.	 It	displays	 	moderate	
outcrop	and	had	never	been	previously	explored	for	uranium.	
	
In	2009	RJUL	drilled	35	RC	holes	for	a	total	of	4315m.	
	
Highlights	of	the	2009	RC	drill	results	from	the	Anniversary	Breccia	include	
	

 26m	@	339ppm	U308	and	2557	ppm	Cu	including	5m	@	597	ppm	U308	and	4780	ppm	Cu

TABLE	11‐1	COSMO	DRILLING	BY	CROCODILE	GOLD	

	
In	December	2009	Crocodile	Gold	 announced	 an	 exploration	program	at	 Cosmo	 consisting	 of	 	 five	 drill	
holes	spaced	approximately	100	meters	apart.	The	program	was	designed	to	achieve	five	intersections	into	
the	 central	 part	 of	 the	 projected	 down‐plunge	 extension	 of	 the	 currently	 known	 mineralization.	 The	
drilling	 tested	 an	 area	 400	 meters	 laterally	 to	 the	 north	 and	 600	 meters	 down‐plunge,	 of	 known	
mineralization.	
	
In	February	2010	the	Company	announced		initial	drill	results.		

	
 Hole	GFG01	 intersected	5.15	g/t	Au	over	22.33	meters	within	 the	previously	estimated	 Inferred	

mineral	 resource	and	below	the	previously	 Indicated	 lower	 limit	of	 the	4.0	g/t	Au	contour.	Hole	
GFG01	was	 designed	 to	 increase	 the	 confidence	 level	 in	 the	 current	 resources	 and	 increase	 the	
amount	of	reserves.	It	is	vertically	below	the	lower	limit	of	the	4.0	g/t	Au	contour,	suggesting	the	
potential	to	extend	high	grade	mineralization	at	depth.	

 Hole	CP005	intersected	the	Cosmo	mineralization	approximately	400	meters	north	of	the	resource	
outline.	 Mineralization	 encountered	 in	 CP005	 is	 the	 deepest	 intersection	 to	 date	 at	 Cosmo,	 a	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

[146]	
	

vertical	 depth	 of	 approximately	 850	meters	 below	 surface.	 CP005	mineralization	was	 contained	
within	an	82	meter	long	interval	that	contained	narrower	higher	grade	sections	including	3.64	g/t	
Au	over	3.00	meters,	and	2.64	g/t	Au	over	2.46	meters	separated	by	lower	grade	material;	

 Hole	 CP001	 was	 drilled	 100	 meters	 to	 the	 north	 of	 the	 resource	 area	 and	 intersected	 what	 is	
interpreted	 to	 be	 the	 Cosmo	mineralization	 over	 a	 91	meter	 interval	 that	 contains	 a	 number	 of	
higher	grade	intervals.		

 Holes	 CP001	 and	 CP005	were	 designed	 to	 test	 for	 lateral	 extensions	 of	 the	 Cosmo	mineralized	
horizons	to	the	north.	CP001	and	CP005	were	targeted	to	intersect	the	Cosmo	mineralization	100	
and	400	meters	north	of	 the	 current	 resource,	 respectively.	Based	on	historical	drill	 results,	 the	
Cosmo	mineralization	appears	to	plunge	steeply	northward.		

 Results	 indicate	 that	 the	high	grade	core	of	 the	Cosmo	system	is	still	open	at	depth	and	 indicate	
that	 the	mineralized	system	has	a	strike	extent	 in	excess	of	800	meters	and	remains	open	along	
strike	and	at	depth.	Outside	of	the	resource	area,	the	mineralization	also	potentially	remains	open	
up	dip,	with	some	particularly	high	grade	 intersections	near	surface	 including	50.00	g/t	Au	over	
3.00	meters	in	hole	GA041.

In	April	2010	Crocodile	Gold	released	further	drill	results	from	Cosmo	including:	

	
 Hole	 CP03W1	 returned	 4.9	 g/t	 Au	 over	 15.8	meters	 (true	width	 12.7metres),	 which	 included	 a	

higher	grade	interval	of	11.1	g/t	Au	over	4.8	meters	(true	width	3.9	meters).	Mineralization	in	this	
hole	is	within	the	Western	Lodes	and	is	located	more	than	300	meters	north	of	the	current	NI	43‐
101	 resources.	 It	 was	 at	 a	 vertical	 depth	 of	 approximately	 675	 meters	 and	 was	 the	 deepest	
intersection	of	the	Western	Lode	mineralization	to	date,	more	than	300	meters	below	the	base	of	
current	 resources.	 Very	 limited	 drilling	 has	 taken	 place	 between	 this	 intersection	 and	 existing	
resources	suggesting	the	potential	to	expand	resources.	Mineralization	remains	open	along	strike	
to	the	north,	at	depth	and	towards	surface.	

 Hole	GFG001W1	 intersected	4.3	 g/t	Au	over	15.4	meters	 (true	width	9.0metres)	 and	3.3	 g/t	Au	
over	7.50	meters	(true	width	5.0	meters).	The	 intersection	 is	approximately	80	meters	vertically	
above	the	intersection	in	hole	GFG001.					
	

Hole	 CP03W1	 was	 drilled	 as	 part	 of	 the	 step	 out	 drilling	 program	 designed	 to	 test	 for	 extensions	 of	
mineralization	and	was	 located	between	previously	reported	holes	CP01.	The	hole	was	to	 intersect	both	
the	Western	and	Eastern	Lodes	and	intersected	significant	mineralization	along	strike	and	more	than	300	
meters	to	the	north	of	the	currently	defined	limits	of	the	Western	Lodes,	with	an	intersection	of	4.9	g/t	Au	
over	15.8	meters	(true	width	12.7	meters)	which	included	a	higher	grade	interval	of	11.1	g/t	Au	over	4.8	
meters	(true	width	3.9	meters).	Limited	drilling	has	taken	place	in	the	area	from	the	northern	boundary	of	
the	Western	 Lodes	 resource	 to	 the	 intersection	 in	 CP03W1,	 consequently	 it	 is	 believed	 that	 there	 is	 a	
strong	 possibility	 of	 defining	 additional	 mineralization	 in	 the	Western	 Lodes	 to	 the	 north	 of	 currently

defined	resources.	Mineralization	also	continues	to	be	open	to	the	north	of	this	latest	intersection,	and	also	
at	depth	and	towards	the	surface.	

	
Hole	 GFG001W1	was	 a	 wedge	 hole	 from	 hole	 GFG001	 and	 was	 completed	 as	 part	 of	 the	 infill	 drilling	
program.	The	hole	intersected	the	Eastern	Lodes	mineralization	approximately	80	meters	vertically	above	
hole	 GFG001.	 Two	 significant	 intersections	 were	 obtained	 including	 4.3	 g/t	 Au	 over	 15.4	meters	 (true	
width	 9.0	meters)	 and	 3.3	 g/t	 Au	 over	 7.5	meters	 (true	width	 5.0	meters).	 It	 further	 demonstrates	 the	
continuity	of	the	inferred	resources	at	depth.

A	 new	 target	 for	 underground	 drilling	 and	 development	 was	 identified,	 south	 of	 the	 existing	 mineral	
resource	on	the	West	Lode	and	on	strike	with	the	Phantom	Pit.	A	number	of	intercepts	were	encountered	
in	hole	CP009W1,	the	uppermost	wedge	of	hole	CP009,	past	the	modeled	resource	lode	area	through	the	
Cosmo	anticline	core	into	what	is	thought	to	be	the	strike	extension	of	the	Phantom	lodes.	The	Phantom	
ore	body	was	previously	mined	in	the	adjoining	Phantom	Pit,	located	directly	to	the	south	of	the	existing	
Cosmo	 Pit.	 Initial	 interpretation	 of	 the	 Phantom	 lodes	 suggests	 that	 the	 Phantom	 lodes	 occur	
approximately	430	meters	below	surface	if	projected	in	the	section	containing	holes	CP009,	CP009W1	and	
CP009W2	approaching	the	surface	to	within	approximately	130	meters	or	approximately	60	meters	below	
the	existing	Cosmo	Pit	shell.	Additional	drilling	is	required	to		outline	the	mineralization.

The	West	Zone	Area	of	mineralization	is	estimated	to	be	located	up	to	200	meters	west	of	the	main	Howley	
mineralization	but	extends	closer	 to	 it	 towards	 the	north	(refer	 to	Figure	2:	Cosmo/Howley	Plan	View).	
The	West	Zone	Area	is	in	excess	of	100	meters	wide	but	is	not	currently	well	defined.	The	purpose	of	the	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	
	

[151]	
	

2010	exploration	program	was	 to	better	define	 this	area	and	 to	 investigate	 the	possibility	of	 increasing	
estimated	mineral	resources	in	order	to	justify	enlarging	the	Main	Pit.	
	
Substantial	near	surface	mineralization	was	encountered	in	a	number	of	holes.	Highlights	include	1.10	g/t	
Au	 over	 54	 meters	 in	 drill	 hole	 CSRC	 451	 which	 was	 mineralized	 for	 its	 entire	 length	 from	 surface.	
Narrower	 higher	 grade	 zones	were	 encountered	within	 the	wider	 intervals	 of	mineralization,	 including	
4.28	g/t	Au	over	6m.	
	
Crocodile	Gold	believes	that	these	results	demonstrate	excellent	continuity	of	the	West	Zone	Area	and	this	
area	is	the	principal	focus	of	the	updated	resource	estimate.	Mineralization	remains	open	to	the	south	and	
at	depth.	The	deepest	hole	in	the	program	was	only	150	meters	below	surface.	
	
The		program	also	identified	an	additional	zone	of	near	surface	mineralization	approximately	100	meters	
west	of	the	West	Zone	Area	with	intersections	of	up	to	0.50	g/t	Au	over	33	meters	in	hole	CSRC	459.	This	
suggests	the	mineralization	remains	open	to	the	west	and	that	the	mineralized	corridor	could	locally	be	in	
excess	of	500	meters	wide,	compared	with	the	previously	measured	400	meters	width.	
	
The	main	 aim	of	 the	 exploration	program	was	 to	 complete	 sufficient	 infill	 drilling	 to	 provide	 increased	
confidence	in	the	resources	to	be	mined.	Results	include	intersections	of	wide	mineralized	zones,	1.75	g/t	
Au	over	25	meters	in	drill	hole	CSRC	476	and	1.63	g/t	over	28	meters	in	drill	hole	CSRC	482.	A	number	of	
narrower	intersections	were	also	encountered	including	5.83	g/t	Au	over	6	meters	in	drill	hole	CSRC	482.	
	
The	majority	 of	 past	 drilling	 targeted	 an	 area	 less	 than	 100	meters	 below	 surface.	 The	 2010	 program	
tested	 for	 mineralization	 as	 deep	 as	 200	 meters	 below	 surface.	 Intersections	 at	 175	 meters	 vertical	
included	1.30	g/t	Au	over	15	meters	 in	drill	hole	CSRC	515	and	1.03	g/t	Au	over	15	meters	 in	drill	hole	
CSRC	517.	
	
The	two	kilometer	distance	between	the	old	Cosmo	open	pit	and	the	Howley	Main	Pit	was	not	previously	
drill	tested.	A	number	of	drill	holes	were	completed	on	widely	spaced	(200	meter)	sections	in	order	to	test	
for	mineralization	 in	 this	 area.	Drill	 hole	CEX	013	 intersected	1.03	 g/t	Au	over	15	meters	 at	 a	depth	of	
approximately	50	meters	below	surface,	and	approximately	800	meters	south	of	the	Main	Pit.		
	
In	May	2010	the	Company	announced	drill	results	from	the	Howley	trend.	
	
The	Howley	mineralization	occurs	within	an	anticlinal	structure	and	is	 located	 immediately	north	of	 the	
Cosmo	 pit	with	mineralization	 present	more	 than	 5	 kilometers	 to	 the	 north	 of	 Cosmo.	 The	majority	 of	
work	to	date	has	focused	on	the	west	limb	of	the	anticline	which	is	also	the	location	of	the	majority	of	the	
current	known	resources.	
	
The	bulk	of	the	existing	resources	at	Howley	are	less	than	100	meters	below	the	surface.	The	2010	drilling	
demonstrated	the	continuity	of	mineralization	to	a	vertical	depth	of	more	than	200	meters.	Hole	HSRC048	
intersected	2.41	g/t	Au	over	28	meters,	which	 included	8.50	g/t	Au	over	6	meters	and	1.03	g/t	over	43	
meters,	which	included	2.27	g/t	Au	over	8	meters.	Hole	HSRC046	intersected	1.12	g/t	Au	over	31	meters,	
which	 included	9.27	 g/t	Au	 over	 3	meters	 and	 1.39	 g/t	Au	 over	 17	meters.	 Both	holes	 intersected	 this	
mineralization	 at	 vertical	 depths	 in	 excess	 of	 200	 meters	 below	 surface.	 Mineralization	 continues	 to	
remain	open	at	depth.	
	
In	 the	 area	 between	 6000N	 to	 6500N,	 no	 resources	 have	 been	 defined	 due	 to	 an	 absence	 of	 previous	
drilling.	 	 A	 number	 of	 holes	 in	 this	 area	 intersected	mineralization	 indicating	 the	 potential	 for	 defining	
additional	resources.	 	Hole	HSRC059	intersected	1.46	g/t	Au	over	18	meters,	which	included	4.50	g/t	Au	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

[152]	
	

over	5	meters,	at	a	vertical	depth	of	more	than	150	meters.	Hole	HSRC055	intersected	1.27	g/t	Au	over	12	
meters	at	a	vertical	depth	of	approximately	125	meters.	
	
The	majority	of	historical	exploration	at	Howley	has	focused	on	the	west	limb	of	the	anticlinal	structure.	
The	 east	 limb	 has	 previously	 received	 little	 attention.	 This	 target	 area	 is	 considered	 a	 high	 priority	
exploration	area.	 In	the	area	to	the	east	of	 the	Howley	 	pit,	a	number	of	significant	historical	high	grade	
drill	 intersections	have	been	obtained.	In	many	cases	the	holes	were	incompletely	sampled.	Examples	of	
some	of	these	intersections	include	58.1	g/t	Au	over	2	meters	and	18.26	g/t	Au	over	7	meters	in	drill	hole	
CH063	at	a	depth	of	only	50	meters	below	surface.	
	
In	 the	 2010	 program,	 hole	 HSRC038	 intersected	 11.44	 g/t	 Au	 over	 5	 meters	 at	 a	 vertical	 depth	 of	
approximately	200	meters.	This	is	the	deepest	intersection	of	high	grade	mineralization	to	date	on	the	east	
limb,	 and	 is	 approximately	 100	 meters	 deeper	 than	 the	 previous	 deepest	 intersection	 in	 the	 area.	 It	
demonstrates	the	potential	of	this	area	to	outline	a	high	grade	resource.	
	
The	results	of	 the	2010	drilling	 indicate	 that	 the	 	Howley	mineralization	 is	part	of	a	 larger	gold	system.	
Identified	mineralization	 is	within	a	corridor	 that	 is	up	 to	500	meters	wide,	has	a	strike	 length	of	more	
than	3.5	kilometers	that	remains	open	to	the	north,	south,	east,	west	and	at	depth.	
	
In	early	July	the	Company	announced	further	drill	results	of:	

 near	surface	mineralization	of	8.93	g/t	Au	over	6	meters	in	hole	HSRC014;	
 Numerous	wider	mineralized	 intersections	 down	 dip	 from	 existing	 resources	 in	 hole	 HSRC150	

with	5.02	g/t	Au	(uncut)	and	4.78	g/t	Au	(cut)	over	9	meters,		
 in	hole	HSRC142	with	13.36	g/t	Au	(uncut)	and	7.46	g/t	Au	(cut)	over	5	meters,		
 in	hole	HSRC151	with	2.44	g/t	Au	over	7	meters		
 in	hole	HSRC147	with	22.7	g/t	Au	(uncut)	and	5.81	g/t	Au	(cut)	over	9	meters;	
 Higher	 grade	 intercepts	 continue	 to	 be	 intersected	 on	 the	 east	 anticlinal	 limb	of	mineralization	

with	up	to	12.17	g/t	Au	over	2	meters	 in	hole	HSRC127	at	a	vertical	depth	of	approximately	24	
meters;	

 Mineralization	continues	to	be	 intersected	 in	 the	West	Zone	Area	with	up	to	5.60	g/t	Au	over	6	
meters	in	hole	HSRC336	at	approximately	40	meters	below	surface;	

 Mineralization	extended	more	than	600	meters	north	of	existing	resources	with	6.14	g/t	Au	over	2	
meters	in	hole	HSRC238;		

 Mineralization	remains	open	to	the	north,	south,	west	and	at	depth.

TABLE	11‐9	DRILLING	COMPLETED	AT	BROCKS	CREEK	FOR	2010	

Surface	 drilling	 confirmed	 that	mineralization	 continues	 down‐dip	 for	 at	 least	 100	meters	 and	 remains	
open	at	depth.		
	
Results	from	seven	drill	holes	completed	from	underground,	returned	significant	grades	and	thicknesses.	
Intersections	included	14.4	g/t	Au	over	4.1	meters	in	hole	ZU725‐05,	13.0	g/t	Au	over	3.8	meters	in	hole	
ZU725‐07,	 and	 13.69	 g/t	 Au	 over	 3.13	 meters	 in	 hole	 ZU725‐03.	 These	 results	 confirm	 continuity	 of	
mineralization	in	the	current	resource	area	and	also	demonstrate	the	potential	to	upgrade	the	confidence	
level	of	these	resources	and	ultimately	to	increase	the	level	of	reserves.		
	
Extending	 resources	 at	 depth	 was	 carried	 out	 with	 surface	 diamond	 drilling.	 Due	 to	 the	 ore	 body's	
relatively	 small	 strike	 length	 of	 30	 meters,	 surface	 drilling	 required	 the	 application	 of	 specialist	
navigational	techniques.	Subsidiary	deflection	or	"daughter"	holes	were	completed	from	an	initial	primary	
hole.	
	
The	results	included	high	grade	mineralization	intersected	approximately	100	meters	down‐dip	from	the	
existing	resources	with	intersections	of	8.9	g/t	Au	over	3.3	meters	in	hole	ZEDDH004W4	and	15.3	g/t	Au

TABLE	11‐11	UNION	REEFS	DRILL	RESULTS	

	
This	first	drill	program	at	the	Prospect	Claim	Deposit	was	primarily	designed	for	environmental	assessment	
but	some	holes	did	target	higher	grade	mineralization	that	is	noted	as	steeply	dipping	zones	associated	with	
quartz	 stockwork	 veining.	 Two	 holes	 (URR002	 and	 URR005)	 were	 designed	 for	 geological	 and	
environmental	reasons	not	to	target	mineralization.	A	thorough	review	was	conducted	on	the	regional	and	
grade	control	drilling	in	and	around	the	Prospect	Claim	pit	and	it	was	noted	that	there	is	only	very	limited	
drilling	below	the	mined	pit,	even	though	the	mineralization	was	not	closed	off	at	depth.		

Interpretations	 indicate	 potential	 exists	 for	 extensions	 of	 mineralization	 in	 the	 area	 between	 the	
Crosscourse	and	Prospect	Claim	deposits.	The	mineralization	at	Crosscourse	is	contained	within	two	lenses	
–	 the	 E	 Lens	 (on	 the	Union	Mineralized	 Zone)	 and	 Ping	Que	 Lens	 (on	 the	 Lady	Alice	Mineralized	 Zone).

12 SAMPLING 	METHOD 	& 	APPROACH	

	
Two	main	sample	types	are	present	within	the	drillhole	database	relating	to	the	different	drilling	methods	
employed	over	the	history	of	the	Project	area,	including	RC	and	diamond	drillholes.	The	following	section	
describes	the	sampling	methodology	used	during	each	drilling	campaign.		
	

12.1 	REVERSE	CIRCULATION	DRILLING	SAMPLING	

	
The	geologist	sieves	and	washes	a	portion	of	each	1.0m	RC	sample	interval.	The	sample	is	then	inspected	to	
determine	 its	 geological	 attributes.	 Geological	 descriptions	 are	 entered	 directly	 onto	 standard	 logging	
sheets	 in	either	a	hard	copy	or	digital	 form	via	a	portable	computer,	using	standardized	geological	codes.	
Each	washed	sample	is	 then	stored	 in	a	chip	tray	which	is	 located	on	shelving	at	the	exploration	yard	for	
future	reference	if	required.	
	
RC	drillholes	are	typically	sampled	on	1.0m	intervals.	The	drill	cuttings	are	riffle	or	cone	split	to	produce	a	
final	 sample	 of	 approximately	 2	 to	 3	 kg.	 There	 is	 a	 	 systematic	 submission	 of	 duplicates,	 barren	 flushes,	
standards	and	blanks	into	the	sample	stream.		
	
At	 the	 completion	 of	 each	 hole,	 samples	 for	 assay	 are	 collected	 in	 large	 plastic	 bags	 in	 short	 intervals.	
These	are	sealed	on	site	and	stored	ready	for	dispatch	to	the	laboratory

[162]	
	

	

12.2 	DIAMOND	DRILLING	SAMPLING		

	
Geologists	 log	 each	 hole,	 paying	 particular	 attention	 to	 the	 degree	 of	 weathering,	 lithological	 contacts,	
structural	contacts,	alteration,	mineralization	and	geotechnical	information.	Drill	core	is	oriented	based	on	
the	orientation	marks	on	 the	 core	made	during	drilling.	 Zones	of	 core	 loss	 are	 identified	 and	marked	by	
inserting	marker	blocks	recording	the	exact	length	of	the	core	loss.		
	
At	the	completion	of	logging,	the	geologist	marks	the	core	ready	for	sampling	and	a	photo	was	taken	of	each	
tray,	 as	 a	means	 of	 checking	 intervals	 as	well	 as	 geological	 logs	 if	 required.	 Sample	 intervals	 are	 chosen	
based	 on	 lithological	 contacts	 or	 where	 there	 are	 significant	 changes	 in	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 gold	
mineralization,	 with	 no	 overlaps	 over	 geological	 boundaries.	 Sample	 boundaries	 are	 often	 pre‐existing	
breaks,	otherwise	the	half	core	was	cut	perpendicular	to	the	core	axis.		
	
A	 minimum	 sample	 size	 of	 0.2m	 and	 a	 maximum	 size	 of	 1.5m	 were	 cut	 using	 an	 Almonte	 automated	
diamond	saw.	The	core	was	cut	so	as	to	divide	the	mineralization	in	half	whilst	preserving	the	orientation	
line.	Some	drillholes	were	sampled	over	 their	entire	 length,	whereas	other	drillholes	were	sampled	 from	
20‐50m	into	the	hangingwall,	through	to	the	end	of	hole.		
	
Samples	were	dispatched	to	the	laboratory	on	a	regular	basis	during	the	drilling	campaign.		

At	the	completion	of	each	hole,	the	core	was	moved	to	a	secure	site	and	the	trays	shelved	for	future	
retrieval,	if	warranted.

13 SAMPLE 	PREPARATION, 	ANALYSES 	& 	SECURITY 	

	
It	 is	 believed	 that	 all	 analytical	 work,	 including	 sample	 preparation,	 analytical	 procedures,	 QA/QC	
measures	 and	 associated	 security	 and	 chain	 of	 custody	procedures	 have	 been	 completed	 in	 accordance	
with	 established	protocols	 routinely	 used	by	Crocodile	Gold,	 as	 described	 in	 Section	 12.0.	 All	 analytical	
work	 for	 the	 reported	drilling	was	 completed	 at	 either	 the	NAL	 laboratory	 at	 Pine	Creek,	NT,	 or	 at	 the	
NTEL	laboratory	in	Darwin,	both	of	who	are	well	known	to	the	Author	as	competent	assayers.	The	Author	
considers	that	these	procedures	and	protocols	are	of	acceptable	quality	and	are	broadly	consistent	with	
international	industry	"best	practice"	standards.	

13.1 	SAMPLE 	PREPARATION	

	
Two	 commercial	 laboratories	 were	 used	 throughout	 the	 Howley	 Pit	 Project	 drilling	 campaigns,	 with	
Northern	Australian	 Laboratories	 (NAL)	 in	Pine	Creek,	Northern	Territory	being	 the	 primary	 laboratory.	
The	umpire	laboratory	was	Northern	Territory	Environmental	Laboratories	(NTEL)	in	Darwin.	
	

13.2 		SAMPLE	SECURITY	

	
A	Crocodile	Gold	staff	member	is	stationed	on	the	RC	drill	rig	while	samples	are	being	drilled	and	collected.	
At	the	end	of	shift	samples	were	generally	transported	to	the	sample	collection	area	where	they	are	stored	
in	crates	as	they	await	transportation	to	NAL	in	Pine	Creek.	Samples	are	shipped	at	regular	intervals	so	they	
are	not	in	crates	for	any	length	of	time.	

In	terms	of	diamond	drilling,	the	core	is	collected	from	the	rig	and	transported	to	the	exploration	office	near	
the	Brocks	Creek	underground	mine.	The	drill	core	is	then	stored	in	the	core	shed	for	logging	and	sampling.	
The	core	shed	is	located	in	a	compound	with	security	fencing.	This	location	is	locked	up	when	no	Crocodile	
Gold	staff	member	 is	on	site.	Samples	are	cut	at	 this	 location	and	samples	 loaded	 into	Lab	crates	as	 they	
await	collection.	These	samples	are	then	transported	directly	to	the	lab	in	Pine	Creek	for	analysis.	

Once	assaying	is	complete	the	results	are	returned	in	digital	format	to	the	data	entry	personnel	employed	
by	Crocodile	Gold.	These	files	are	then	 loaded	directly	 into	a	Datashed	database.	Validation	occurs	at	 this	
stage	 with	 QAQC	 errors	 noted	 and	 fixed	 as	 loading	 is	 completed.	 Submissions	 outside	 given	 QAQC	
guidelines	 are	 rejected	and	not	 loaded	until	 resolved	by	 the	 lab.	The	Datashed	database	 is	 located	at	 the	
Exploration	office	and	the	software	is	a	SQL	database	with	in‐built	security	limiting	access	to	people	outside	
the	Company	network.	

13.3 LABORATORY	PROCEDURE	

	
Upon	 arrival	 at	 the	 laboratory,	 samples	 are	 sorted,	 reconciled	 against	 the	 accompanying	 paperwork	 and	
dried	on	racks	in	the	oven.	Each	sample	is	initially	crushed	in	a	jaw	crusher	to	the	size	of	10mm.	Following	
the	jaw	crusher,	each	sample	is	passed	through	a	roll	crusher	to	a	size	of	2mm.	Samples	are	riffle	split	into	
two	 sub‐samples	 –	 one	 sample	 is	milled,	whilst	 the	 other	 is	 retained	 as	 a	 coarse	 reject	 and	 returned	 to	
Crocodile	Gold.	The	sub‐sample	retained	for	analysis	is	milled	to	100μm	in	a	Keegor	mill.	Each	milled	pulp	
sample	is	further	split	to	provide	50g	for	fire	assay	(FA50).	The	remaining	sample	is	kept	as	a	pulp	sample

[164]	
	

for	 future	 analyses	 and	 returned	 to	 Crocodile	 Gold.	 After	 firing,	 samples	 are	 analyzed	 using	 AAS,	 with	
results	reported	in	ppm.		
	
Quality	control	procedures	include	blasts	of	compressed	air	to	clean	jaw	and	roll	crushers	between	samples,	
a	barren	flush	of	river	sand	to	clean	bowls	in	between	samples,	laboratory	duplicate	samples	undertaken	at	
a	rate	of	1	in	10	and	the	insertion	of	NAL	internal	standards	to	monitor	performance.	Wet‐screen	testing	has	
been	conducted	intermittently	at	a	rate	of	1‐2	times	per	week	on	a	few	samples.	The	laboratory	is	currently	
upgrading	their	facilities	to	conduct	wet‐screening	at	the	preferred	1:50	ratio	for	every	dispatch.

13.4 	QUALITY	ASSURANCE 	/	QUALITY	CONTROL	

	
Quality	 Assurance	 and	 Quality	 Control	 (QA/QC)	 procedures	 include	 insertion	 of	 control	 samples	
(standards)	and	barren	quartz	flushes	(BQF),	inter‐laboratory	pulp	checks	and	collection	of	field	duplicates	
from	 the	drill	 rig.	 Field	 duplicates	 are	 produced	 from	 splitting	 the	 original	 sample	 straight	 from	 the	 rig‐
mounted	cone	splitter.	Blanks	are	inserted	in	the	sample	stream.

13.5 	STANDARDS	

	
Certified	standards	are	submitted	to	the	laboratory	on	a	regular	basis.	A	standard	is	inserted	into	the	batch	
every	25	samples	(or	less).		
	

13.6 	BLANKS	

	
Blank	materials	included	in	the	sample	stream	were	derived	from	several	sources	including	barren	core,	
barren	coarse	rejects,	crushed	Bunbury	Basalt	(from	Gannet	Holding	Pty	Ltd,	referred	to	in	this	report	as	
"blank")	and	barren	quartz	flushes	(BQF	at	a	ratio	of	1:50.	BQF	material	was	included	in	most	batches	and	
was	incorporated	into	the	batch	after	an	ore	zone	and/or	at	the	geologist's	discretion.	
	

13.7 	DUPLICATE	ASSAYS 		

	
Relative	precisions	have	been	used	to	analyze	the	precision	of	duplicate	samples.	The	relative	precision	is	a	
measure	of	 dissimilarity,	 that	 is,	 if	 both	distributions	are	 exactly	 the	 same	 this	 value	will	 equal	 zero	and	
increases	as	the	distributions	become	more	dissimilar.		
	
In	this	report,	relative	precision	has	been	calculated	using	all	data	pairs	where	the	original	gold	assay	value	
is	in	the	range	of	≥0.5	and	≤5	ppm	Au.	This	is	to	remove	the	large	conditional	variance	of	errors	associated	
with	assay	determinations	near	both	the	lower	and	upper	analytical	detection	limits.		
	
Pulp	 duplicate	 fire	 assay	determinations	 typically	 have	 a	 relative	 precision	 value	 of	 around	10	 to	 15%,	
with	field	duplicate	(fire	assay)	data	around	30%	(Hardy	and	Hague,	2001).	
	

13.8 	OPINIONS 	ON	SAMPLING,	ETC	

	
The	results	from	the	QAQC	analysis	of	drilling	has	indicated	a	good	level	of	confidence	in	assay	grades	for	
use	 in	 the	 resource	model.	 The	 following	 recommendations	 for	 improvements	 in	 the	 current	procedures	
are:		

•	A	fail‐safe	system	of	including	standards	into	batches	before	being	sent	to	the	lab.		

•	An	immediate	follow‐up	with	the	laboratory	when	standards	fail.		

•	 Introducing	 continuous	 wet	 screening	 of	 samples	 to	 monitor	 particle	 size	 and	 to	 have	 these	 results	
			reported	by	the	laboratory.		
•	Conducting	an	analysis	on	barren	core	that	is	re‐used	to	serve	as	blanks	in	future	batches.

13.9 	GRADE	CONTROL	QAQC	

	
G.	 	Hunter	 	of	 I.L.S	Technical	Services	was	commissioned	by	 the	Geology	Manager	of	Crocodile	Gold	 to	
look	 at	 the	 large	 databases	 of	 assays	 accumulated	 over	 the	 past	 15	 months	 from	 drilling	 at	 various	
operations.	
	
The	two	laboratories	used	by	Crocodile	Gold	offer	different	preparation	techniques	with	a	30g	fire	assay	by	
NTEL	 and	 a	 50g	 fire	 assay	 by	NAL.	 Both	 laboratories	 do	 overflow	work	 for	 grade	 control	 and	 resource	
definition	drilling.	
	
Grade	control	drilling	originates	from	the	Howley	and	North	Point	pits.	Resource	definition	drilling	is	based	
on	samples	from	Howley,	Princess	Louise	and	Mottrams.	
	
The	 following	 summarizes	 Hunter's	 findings	 with	 respect	 to	 assay	 work	 from	 the	 two	 independent	
laboratories.		

 Significant	errors	in	all	samples,	irrespective	of	preparation	technique	and	sample	size	for	fire	
assay.	This	suggests	that	a	different	preparation/analytical	technique	should	be	used	to	reduce	
this	error	and	improve	confidence	at	ore	boundaries.	

 Preparation	schemes	at	both	laboratories	are	effectively	splitting	the	bulk	sample	in	half	after	
crushing,	milling	one	half	and	the	assay	results	from	duplicates	and	Au1,	Au2,	AuR1,	AuR2,	etc	are	
all	originating	from	that	milled	split.	This	applies	to	grade	control	and	resource	definition	samples.	

 Both	NTEL	and	NAL	laboratories	exhibit	the	same	characteristics	in	their	assays	of	Howley,	North	
Point	and	Princess	Louise.	On	average,	NAL	carries	a	slightly	higher	error	based	on	replicate	
analysis.	

 Grade	control	sampling	and	submissions	had	a	variable	insertion	rate	of	standards	and	blanks.	
 There	are	numerous	errors	in	the	databases.	Typographical	errors,	wrong	standards	recorded/sent	

to	lab,	obvious	swaps	in	the	databases.	These	errors	are	collaborative	from	both	the	laboratories	and	
the	database	operator.	

 The	laboratories	appear	to	have	different	philosophies	on	QC.	NAL	operate	at	nearly	double	the	
QC	rate	of	NTEL.	

 Both	laboratories	will	need	a	slight	improvement	on	reporting	results	after	QC	checking.	Outright	
errors	should	not	be	appearing	in	the	database	(standards	and	replicates).	

 Too	many	standards	are	in	use	which	appears	to	have	affected	results	significantly	and	
reduce	their	effectiveness	in	verifying	the	database.	

 Proper	control	charting	methods	should	be	applied	to	fire	assay	batches	that	indicate	standards	
outside	of	control	limits	(this	may	already	have	been	done,	but	these	standards	should	not	be	
appearing	in	reports/database).	

 Inserted	blanks	are	generally	reporting	well.	Problems	existed	with	contaminated	BQF	and	some	
obvious	misplacements	with	samples/standards	from	either/or	both	the	lab	and	submitting	staff	
members.	

 Only	two	monthly	QC	reports	were	received	from	NTEL	in	2010.	Both	of	these	indicate	a	
preparation	quality	that	doesn't	meet	requirements	(unless	clays	are	significant	in	the	
orebodies).	

 No	data	was	seen	from	NAL	on	preparation	quality.	
 The	site	laboratory	appears	to	be	operating	well	and	producing	consistent	results		
 Outsourcing	the	operation	of	the	site	lab	reduces	company	operational	input	and	management.	
 Crocodile	Gold	is	responsible	for	the	maintenance	of	all	site	laboratory	equipment	except	the	

servicing	of	the	GBC	instruments,	the	water	still	and	routine	calibration	of	balance/s.

13.10 	RECOMMENDATIONS	

	
•	 With	a	significant	fundamental	error	in	the	assay	returns	from	the	two	independent	laboratories,	

a	larger	sub‐sample	analytical	technique	may	be	better	suited	to	reducing	these	errors	and	
improving	analytical	precision.	A	100g	or	200g	accelerated	leach	technique	should	provide	this	at	
lower	operating	costs	and	improved	turnaround.	

•	 Finer	grinds	in	sample	preparation	may	also	reduce	errors	and	improve	precision,	but	this	may	
be	marginal.	The	processing	plant	is	operating	at	P80	of	75um	indicating	the	particle	size	in	ore.	

•	 It	is	possible	that	the	entire	laboratory	sample	can	be	milled	and	it	might	reduce	errors	on	a	large	
database,	but	this	will	also	achieve	longer	preparation	times,	higher	costs	for	little	benefit	with	
the	use	of	fire	assay	as	the	analytical	method.	

•	 Based	on	the	comparative	data,	there	would	be	no	significant	change	to	assay	result	reporting	
and	quality	if	the	grade	control	was	switched	from	NTEL	to	NAL.	

•	 To	corroborate	the	above	and	the	difference	in	the	two	preparation	techniques	used,	it	would	
be	prudent	to	randomly	select	known	problematic	areas	of	varying	grades	and	submit	these	as	
a	normal	sample	and	request	it	goes	through	preparation	as	normal	but	the	final	milled	split	
should	then	be	completely	wet	sized	and	assayed	for	Au	distribution	at	sizes	of	45um,	75um,	
106um,	150um.	

•	 Monthly	QC	reports	should	be	generated	inclusive	of	blanks,	internal	lab	standards,	replicate	
analysis,	preparation	quality	(1	in	50	at	least).	

•	 Crocodile	Gold	database	operators	must	check	all	blanks,	blind	standards,	lab	internal	
standards	on	control	charts	and	then	assess	if	the	rest	of	data	is	to	be	accepted.	

•	 It	is	suggested	that	the	selection	of	blind	standards	be	at	least	0.5ppm	apart.	The	standards,	
ideally,	should	be	vacuum	sealed	foil	packets	of	~50‐60g	with	no	identifying	label	apart	from	a	
simple	number.	

•	 Outside	of	cost	considerations,	there	appears	to	be	no	need	to	change	the	current	plant	site

14 DATA 	VERIFICATION 	

	
Crocodile	Gold	utilize	specialized	industry	computer	software	to	manage	its	drillhole	and	assay	database	
and	 employ	 dedicated	 personnel	 to	 manage	 the	 database	 and	 apply	 appropriate	 QAQC	 procedures	 to	
maintain	the	integrity	of	the	data.	
	
Previous	 consultants	have	 completed	various	database	 checks	which	have	not	 identified	any	 reportable	
errors,	which	would	have	raised	any	concerns	about	 the	 integrity	of	 the	data.	During	the	preparation	of	
this	report,	which	has	included	search	and	look‐up	of	assay	results,	generation	of	plans	and	sections	and	
estimation	of	mineral	resources,	the	Qualified	Persons	did	not	encounter	any	difficulties	with	the	database;	
hence	the	Authors	believe	the	historical	data/database	has	been	verified	to	a	sufficient	level	to	permit	its	
use	and	confidence	in	its	reliability.

15 ADJACENT 	PROPERTIES 	

	
There	 are	 several	 other	mines	 in	 the	Northern	 Territory	 and	 numerous	 historical	 gold,	 base	metal	 and	
uranium	occurrences	within	the	Pine	Creek	Inlier	and	at	any	time	some	of	these	prospects	may	be	subject	
to	various	stages	of	evaluation	or	development.		
	
Following	 is	 a	description	of	 some	of	 the	more	 relevant	properties	which	are	proximal	 to	 the	Northern	
Territory	 Gold	 Properties;	 however,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 note	 that	 this	 list	 is	 not	 complete.	 Information	
contained	herein	is	derived	from	public	sources,	generally	company	websites	and	has	not	been	verified	by	
the	 Author.	 All	 references	 to	 mineral	 resources	 and/or	 mineral	 reserves	 are	 reported	 to	 have	 been	
prepared	in	accordance	to	JORC	Code;	however,	the	Author	has	not	verified	this	information.

15.1 	SPRING	HILL	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
The	 Spring	Hill	 Gold	Deposit,	 currently	 held	 by	Western	Desert	Resources	 Ltd,	 lies	 in	 the	 historical	 Pine	
Creek	goldfield	to	the	south	of	the	Union	Reef	processing	facility.		The	deposit	is	hosted	within	greywacke	
and	 siltstone	 units	 of	 the	 Mount	 Bonnie	 Formation	 which	 occur	 with	 distinctive	 interbeds	 of	 hematitic	
siltstones	associated	with	layers	of	banded	granular	quartz	and	ironstone.			

	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties

[183]	
	

The	 Spring	 Hill	 deposit	 is	 estimated	 to	 comprise	 an	 Indicated	 Resource	 of	 3.6	 Mt	 at	 2.34	 g/t	 gold	 for	
approximately	274,000	oz	of	contained	gold	(McKibben	et	al,	2008).	

	

15.2 	MT	PORTER	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
The	Mt	Porter	Gold	Deposit,	located	15km	north	of	the	Union	Reef	gold	processing	plant	near	Pine	Creek,	is	
a	 sediment‐hosted	 stratiform	 gold	 deposit	 with	 quartz‐sulphide‐vein‐hosted	 stratabound	 gold	
mineralization	 associated	with	 cherty	 iron	 formation	 and	 carbonaceous	mudstone	mainly	 in	 the	Middle	
Koolpin	Formation	in	the	north‐northwesterly	trending	Mt	Porter	anticline.	

	
Stream	sediment	sampling	and	RC	drilling	of	gold	anomalies	located	by	earlier	work	of	Homestake	Gold	of	
Australia	 in	 1996‐1999	 by	 Arafura	 discovered	 the	 deposit.	 In	 recent	 years,	 Arafura	 has	 completed	 two	
drilling	campaigns	at	Mt	Porter.	The	2006	program	encountered	a	13	meter	intersection	grading	2.28	g/t	
gold	 to	 the	west	 of,	 and	beneath,	 the	 identified	 resource.	This	 represents	 a	 new	and	unexpected	 zone	of	
mineralization.	

	
The	Mt	Porter	project	contains	a	 JORC	compliant	resource	of	34,200	oz	of	gold	(355,000	t	@	3.0g/t	gold,	
using	a	1.7g/t	cut‐off	grade)	conducive	to	open	pit	mining.	(Source:	www.arafuraresources.com.au)	

	

15.3 	GLENCOE	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
Australasia	Gold	Ltd's	Pine	Creek	Project	 comprises	 a	 block	 of	mineral	 claims	 covering	 the	Glencoe	Gold	
Deposit.		The	deposit	displays	many	features	characteristic	of	the	quartz‐vein	hosted	style	of	mineralization	
similar	to	the	nearby	Enterprise,	Union	Reefs,	Tom's	Gully,	Woolwonga	and	Zapopan	deposits.		
	
The	 total	 of	Measured,	 Indicated	 and	 Inferred	 Resources	 at	 the	 Glencoe	 Deposit	 has	 been	 estimated	 at	
approximately	1.5	Mt	averaging	1.9	g/t	Au,	containing	approximately	90,000	oz	of	gold,	to	a	depth	of	100	
m	below	surface.	(Source:	www.australasiagold.com.au)	

	
The	Glencoe	deposit	was	drilled	to	a	maximum	depth	of	100	m,	and	bulk	sampled	during	the	1980s.		Some	
70,000	t	of	ore	are	recorded	as	having	been	excavated	from	four	shallow	trial	pits.		Each	of	the	four	shoots	
which	make	up	the	Glencoe	resource	reportedly	remains	open	at	depth,	particularly	 in	the	easterly	down	
plunge	extension	direction.	
 
The	Redbank	Mineral	Claim	located	three	km	to	 the	west	of	Glencoe	shows	high	gold	values	 in	the	near	
surface	gossan	zone	of	an	apparently	stratabound	gold	occurrence	(e.g.	a	costean	intercept	of	8m	averaged	
10.9	g/t	gold,	and	a	shallow	drillhole	intercept	of	8m	averaged	19.3	g/t	gold).	Limited	reverse	circulation	
(RC)	drilling	failed	to	locate	the	immediate	extensions	of	this	mineralization.

15.4 	FRANCES	CREEK	IRON	MINE	

 
The	Frances	Creek	Iron	Mine,	100%	owned	by	Territory	Resources		Ltd	(ASX:TTY),	is	located	20km	north	
of	 Pine	 Creek	 on	 the	 Stuart	 Highway,	 190	 km	 south	 of	 Darwin	 and	 about	 15km	 from	 the	 recently	
completed	Adelaide‐Darwin	rail	line.	
	
The	Frances	Creek	Mine	produces	high	grade	hematite	ore	for	export.		Mining	commenced	in	May	2007	and	
made	the	first	shipment	from	the	port	of	Darwin	in	September	2007.	The	company	exported	its	500,000th	
tonne	 of	 high	 grade	 iron	 ore	 in	May	 2008.	 Currently	 the	mine	produces	 at	 an	 annualized	mining	 rate	 of	
2mpta	 and	 is	 targeting	 2.5mtpa	in	 2009.	Mining	 is	 carried	 out	 using	 traditional	 methods	 of	 hydraulic	
excavator	and	dump	trucks.	The	product	is	crushed	and	screened	and	railed	to	the	Port	of	Darwin.	

Geologically,	 the	 area	 is	 underlain	 by	 lower	 Proterozoic	 folded	 sediments	 intruded	 by	 lower	 Proterozoic	
granitoids.	 The	 iron	 mineralization	 occurs	 in	 a	 strike	 fault	 breccia	 in	 the	 lower	 Wildman	 Siltstone	 and	
ranges	in	composition	from	hematite	to	goethite	and	limonite.		

The	main	iron	mineralization	at	Frances	Creek	is	known	over	a	distance	of	approximately	35	kilometers.	Of	
the	fifty	named	deposits,	13	located	on	the	southern	end	of	the	mineralized	belt	were	exploited	from	1967	
to	1974	for	a	total	production	of	around	6	million	tonnes.	As	at	February	2007,	total	resources	were	9.73	
million	tonnes	at	60.7%	Fe	with	4.81	million	tonnes	in	reserves.	Iron	ore	was	previously	mined	at	the	site	
until	1974.	(Source:		www.territoryresources.com.au)	
	
Territory	 Resources	 report	 that	 there	 are	 excellent	 prospects	 for	 iron	mineralization	within	 the	 project	
area.	Massive	hematite	continues	at	depth	below	the	floors	in	the	abandoned	pits	and	occurs	in	a	number	of	
unmined	deposits	drill‐evaluated	at	Frances	Creek	in	preparation	for	mining.

16 MINERAL 	PROCESSING 	& 	METALLURGICAL 	TESTWORK 	

16.1 	BURNSIDE 	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	

16.1.1 	UNION	REEFS	GOLD	PLANT	

	
The	Union	Reefs	gold	mine	was	 commissioned	 in	1994	by	Acacia	Resources	Ltd,	 an	entity	 spun	out	of	 the	
Shell/Billiton	 group.	 	 AngloGold	 Australia	 Ltd	 acquired	 the	 mine	 through	 its	 successful	 takeover	 bid	 for	
Acacia	 in	December	1999.	Until	 late	2000,	Union	Reefs	 formed	one	half	of	what	was	known	as	AngloGold's	
Pine	Creek	operations,	which	also	included	the	smaller	Brocks	Creek	project.		
	
The	Union	Reefs	CIL	treatment	plant	was	commissioned	with	a	throughput	capacity	of	1.25	Mtpa.	It	included	
a	gravity	circuit	to	extract	coarse	gold.		It	was	designed	by	Kinhill	and	commissioned	in	December	1994.		JR	
Engineering	carried	out	an	upgrade	 in	1998	that	 involved	the	 installation	of	a	 tertiary	crusher,	second	ball	
mill,	and	two	additional	leach	tanks.		
	
The	plant	currently	has	capacity	for	2.5Mtpa	and	is	configured	with	three‐stage	crushing	and	two	single‐stage	
milling	circuits.	 	Prior	to	the	plant	being	placed	on	care	and	maintenance	in	2003,	the	milling	rate	at	Union	
Reefs	was	typically	335tph	at	a	P80	of	75µm.	Plant	availability	was	typically	96‐98%.		
	
In	August	 2004,	 and	 before	 they	were	 acquired	 by	GBS	Australia,	 the	Burnside	 JV	 partners	 purchased	 the	
Union	Reefs	Gold	project	for	A$4	million	on	a	walk‐in,	walk‐out	basis.		
	
In	August	2006,	GBS	Australia	 recommissioned	 the	Union	Reefs	plant	 on	 the	 larger	 of	 the	 two	mills	while	
leaving	the	other	smaller	ball	mill	in	a	care	and	maintenance	state.		The	first	source	of	feed	material	was	low	
grade	 stockpiles	 from	 Cosmo	 and	 an	 alluvial	 tailings	 deposit	 from	 the	 Union	 Reefs	 site.	 	 Following	
commissioning,	ore	was	sourced	from	a	blended	mix	of	oxidized	and	fresh	underground	and	open	pit	mines.		
	
In	June	2010	Crocodile	Gold	announce	commercial	production	for	the	Union	Reefs	plant.	In	the	period	from	
December	2009	until	June	2010	the	plant	was	in	commissioning.	
	

16.1.2 	UNION	REEFS	PLANT	OPERATIONS		

	
In	the	open	pit	operations,	ore	is	broken	to	minus	1	meter	by	blasting.	Any	larger	rocks	produced	from	the	
blasting	 process	 are	 subsequently	 broken	 to	 suitable	 size	 by	 rock	 breaker.	 Run	 of	 Mine	 ("ROM")	 ore	 is	
transported	 by	 truck	 directly	 to	 the	 ROM	 feed	 bin	 or	 the	 ROM	 stockpile	 for	 storage	 before	 subsequent	
processing.		
	

ROM	ore	is	crushed	at	a	rate	of	up	to	2.5Mtpa	in	a	three	stage	crushing	circuit	incorporating	a	primary	jaw	
crusher	operating	in	open	circuit	and	a	secondary	and	tertiary	cone	crushers	operating	in	closed	circuit	with	
a	double	deck	banana	screen.	Crushing	circuit	product,	at	a	nominal	size	of	12mm	is	conveyed	to	the	grinding	
circuit	via	the	Fine	Ore	Bin	("FOB").		
	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	
	

[186]	
	

The	FOB,	with	a	live	capacity	of	2,500	tonnes,	provides	a	buffer	of	approximately	7	to	8	hours	between	the	
crushing	 and	 grinding	 circuits.	Ore	 is	 reclaimed	 via	 a	 slot	 feeder	 at	 a	 variable	 rate	 and	 is	 conveyed	 to	 the	
grinding	circuit.		
	
As	the	crushing	circuit	capacity	exceeds	that	of	the	milling	circuit,	crushed	ore	is	stockpiled	and	fed	back	into	
the	grinding	circuit	using	a	front	end	loader	into	an	emergency	feed	hopper	and	feeder	arrangement.		
	
Crushed	 ore	 is	 ground	 in	 the	 grinding	 circuit	 consisting	 of	 two	 ANI	 single	 stage	 rubber	 lined	 ball	 mills	
operating	in	closed	circuit	with	a	nest	of	Warman	cyclone	classifiers.	 	A	proportion	of	ball	mill	discharge	is	
directed	to	the	gravity	circuit	incorporating	four	Knelson	concentrators,	two	per	mill.	Knelson	concentrator	
tailings	report	back	to	the	mill	discharge	stream	whilst	the	concentrated	coarse	gold	is	sent	to	the	gold	room	
for	further	processing.		
	
The	remainder	of	the	mill	discharge	and	the	Knelson	concentrator	tailings	are	pumped	to	cyclone	classifiers.	
The	 coarse	 underflow	 fraction	 reports	 back	 to	 the	 ball	 mill	 for	 further	 grinding	 whilst	 the	 fine	 overflow	
fraction	(p80	75‐106µm)	gravitates	to	a	single	high	rate	thickener	for	density	control	before	being	pumped	to	
the	first	of	two	leach	tanks.		
	
Cyanide	is	added	into	the	two	leach	tanks	to	leach	the	gold	into	solution	before	the	material	gravitates	into	
the	CIL	circuit.		High	purity	oxygen	is	added	into	the	leach	tanks	from	the	Pressure	Swing	Absorption	plant	on	
site.		
	
The	CIL	circuit,	comprising	seven	leach/adsorption	contactors	is	gravity	fed	through	open	launders.	All	tanks	
were	agitated	and	aerated	and	are	fitted	with	hollow	shaft	mechanical	agitators.	Barren	slurry	exits	from	the	
last	CIL	tank	and	gravitates	to	the	residue	treatment	circuit.	Activated	carbon	is	pumped	counter	current	to	
the	process	slurry	to	recover	gold	from	solution,	achieving	the	highest	gold	on	carbon	loading	in	CIL	tank	1.	
Carbon	from	tank	1	is	pumped	to	the	elution	circuit.		
	
Tailings	slurry	is	mixed	with	incoming	return	water	to	decrease	the	cyanide	concentration	reporting	to	the	
tailings	dam.	Subsequent	to	this	dilution	stage,	the	tailings	slurry	is	dewatered	in	a	high	rate	thickener	to	±55	
%	 solids	 and	 pumped	 to	 the	 Crosscourse	 pit	 tailings	 facility.	 Process	 water	 is	 recycled	 back	 from	 the	
Crosscourse	pit.		
	
The	loaded	carbon	recovered	from	the	CIL	circuit	is	screened	to	remove	pulp	and	subjected	to	a	desorption	
stage	(split	AARL,	4	tonne	capacity)	to	remove	gold	as	an	auriferous	caustic‐cyanide	solution	from	which	the	
gold	is	recovered	by	electro	winning.	The	stripped	carbon	is	reactivated	in	a	vertical	kiln	and	returned	to	the	
CIL	circuit	for	reuse.		
	
Gravity	gold	recovered	in	the	Knelson	concentrators	 is	periodically	discharged	to	a	settling	cone	 located	 in	
the	gold	 room.	The	gold	 is	 then	 intensively	 leached	 in	 an	Acacia	 reactor	 and	 the	pregnant	 solution	electro	
won	onto	steel	wool.		
	
The	electro	won	gold	and	the	gravity	won	gold	are	calcined	in	an	electric	oven	and	smelted	separately	in	a	
gas‐fired	furnace	into	doré	bullion.	Bars	are	stamped	for	identification	and	dispatched	via	security	service	to	
AGR	at	Perth	International	Airport.		
	
Water	is	supplied	from	various	dams	strategically	located	to	maximize	catchment	of	run‐off	drainage.	A	dam	
constructed	on	the	nearby	McKinlay	River	provides	make	up	water	if	required.		
	

The	whole	plant	is	controlled	by	a	CITECT	process	control	system	over	an	Allen	Bradley	PLC.

TABLE	16‐2	UNION	REEFS	PROCESSING	PLANT	–	HISTORICAL	PERFORMANCE	

Note*:	Production	figures	shown	are	since	commercial	production	declared	on	June	1,	2010	
	
The	 performance	 of	 the	 plant	 following	 the	 commencement	 of	 commercial	 production	 by	 GBS	 Australia	
effective	1	April	2007	is	detailed	below.		Note	that	the	second	ball	mill	was	commissioned	and	used	only	from	
April	2008	onwards	as	the	monthly	throughput	increased	from	around	100,000‐110,000	tonnes	per	month	to	
above	200,000	tonnes	per	month.		
	
These	production	figures	were	achieved	on	a	variety	of	ore	types,	including	oxide,	sulphide	and	low‐grade	ores	
from	Union	Reefs,	Brocks	Creek,	various	open	pits	and	toll	milling	parcels	of	ore	from	Maud	Creek.		
	
The	historical	performance	of	the	Union	Reefs	plant	indicates	that	it	was	a	reliable,	efficient	and	low	cost	ore	
processing	 facility.	 It	has	previously	demonstrated	a	capability	 to	reliably	and	efficiently	process	 in	excess	of	
2.8Mtpa	of	free	milling	ore	from	a	blend	of	oxide,	transition	and	fresh	ore	types.	The	plant	also	has	a	high	level	
of	flexibility	and	can	be	operated	efficiently	at	a	lower	throughput	rate	with	the	use	of	only	one	of	the	installed	
ball	mill	circuits.		
	

16.2 	METALLURGICAL	TEST	WORK	

	

16.2.1 		 2010	HOWLEY	

	
Mineralogy	was	undertaken	on	a	sample	taken	from	the	Howley	pit	around	an	area	which	was	causing	high	
cyanide	 consumption.	 The	 mineralogy	 completed	 by	 Ammtec	 (Report	 A13118)	 did	 not	 show	 any	 of	 the	
constituents	 typically	 associated	 with	 high	 cyanide	 consumption	 i.e.	 secondary	 sulphide	 minerals	 such	 as	
pyrrhotite,	chalcocite,	etc.	This	unexpected	result	indicated	that	either	the	issue	was	operations	related	or	that	
the	initial	sampling	was	poor.	Given	that	Crocodile	Gold	have	subsequently	treated	ore	from	this	area	in	the	pit	
and	 have	 not	 seen	 any	 significant	 increase	 in	 cyanide	 consumption	 would	 lead	 one	 to	 conclude	 	 that	 the	
problem		was	operations	based.	
	

In	December	2010	a	Bond	Ball	Mill	Work	Index	was	carried	out	on	a	sample	from	the	International	Deposit	in	
the	 Pine	 Creek	 area	 by	 Ammtec	 (Preliminary	 Report	 A13227).	 Indications	 are	 that	 the	 International	 ore	 is

quite	resistant	to	size	reduction	in	the	with	a	BOND	BALL	MILL	WORK	INDEX	(Kilowatt	hours	/	dry	tonne)	of

Also	from	the	International	deposit	a	series	of	gravity	recovery	and	CIL	extraction	tests	on	three	ore	types	
were	carried	out	by	Ammtec	and	reported	in	reports	HS24423‐425	and	HS24420‐422.

16.2.2 		 COSMO		

	
In	 2005,	 two	 phases	 of	metallurgical	 testwork	were	 carried	 out	 on	 the	 Cosmo	Deeps	mineralization.	 This	
work	has	been	previously	reported	in	NI43‐101	technical	reports	.	
	

It	 is	 planned	 in	 2011	 to	 take	 some	 of	 the	 previously	 drilled	 diamond	 core	 and	 submit	 it	 for	 further	
metallurgical	testwork	including	gold	recovery	and	throughput	analysis.	Results	of	this	testwork	are	then	to	
be	reviewed	by	Crocodile	Gold's	independent	Metallurgical	consultant.	This	testwork	will	be	used	to	confirm	
previous	testwork	and	will	be	included	in	any	future	Mineral	Reserve	estimations.	The	actual	work	planned	is	
detailed	below:	
	
 Bond	Work	Index	Confirmation		
 Abrasion	Index	Determination	
 Grind	Size	Establishment	(P80	of	75um	&	90um)	
 Leach	Test	at	P80	of	75um	&	90um	for	Au	recovery,	lime	&	CN	consumption	using	oxygen	sparging	

	

16.2.3 	PINE	CREEK	

	
During	 the	 drilling	 of	 several	 environmental	 assessment	 drill	 holes	 at	 Pine	 Creek	 several	 samples	 were	
collected	 for	 metallurgical	 testwork.	 Samples	 of	 differing	 grade	 were	 submitted	 to	 assess	 the	 recovery	
through	a	bottle	roll	process.	The	process	is	outlined	below:	
	
 24	hr	bottle	roll	test	
 400	g	solids	(44.4%	solids)	
 500	ml	water	
 NaOH	to	pH	10	
 2.5kg/t	NaCN	(excess	added	to	ensure	cyanidation)	
 Grind	Size	~	70%	passing	75um	(i.e.	slightly	coarser	than	current	UR	grind)	

Results	of	 this	 testwork	 suggested	 recoveries	 in	 the	order	of	80%	would	be	achievable	at	 the	Union	Reefs	
Mill.	Further	testwork	will	be	required	but	the	figure	obtained	is	consistent	with	production	figures	from	the	
Pine	Creek	mining	reports.	
	
These	 samples	were	 then	 submitted	 to	 Ammtec	 for	 Bond	 Ball	Mill	 testwork.	 The	 results	 of	 this	 show	 the	
International	deposit	has	hard	fresh	ore	with	a	Ball	Mill	Work	Index	of	21.4	kilowatt	hours/dry	tonne	(see	
table	below)

16.2.4 	MOLINE	

	
In	late	2010	a	field	trip	was	taken	to	the	Moline	tenements	where	several	mineralized	samples	were	collect.	
Some	of	these	samples	assayed	significant	amounts	of	gold	and	theses	were	re‐submitted	to	the	lab	for	simple	
bottle	 roll	 testwork.	 The	material	was	most	 likely	 transitional	 in	 nature	 as	weathered	 sulphides	 could	 be	
identified.	The	results	of	this	bottle	roll	test	work	gave	an	indicated	recovery	of	83%.	Further	testwork	will	be	
required	before	a	final	recovery	figure	can	be	used	for	calculation	of	Mineral	Reserves,	but	the	initial	work	
suggests	it	is	feasible	to	extract	gold	with	a	CIL	process.		
	

16.2.5 	IRON	BLOW		

	
In	2008,		GBS	Gold	Australia	completed	a	short	drill	program	of	6	diamond	drill	holes	on	the	Iron	Blow	deposit.											
	
Approximately	24	kg	of	sample	was	selected	from	drill	hole	IBDH002	which	was	shipped	to	AMMTEC	Limited	
Laboratory	in	Perth.	
	
All	material	was	combined	and	crushed	to	<3.35	mm	and	blended	thoroughly	to	form	a	single	
composite.	Five	hundred	grams	were	removed	for	head	assay	and	the	rest	was	split	into	1	kg	
charges	for	flotation	test	work	and	grind	establishment.	
	
All	materials	were	kept	in	cold	storage.	
	
Five	flotation	tests	were	conducted	on	the	composite.	These	included	two	rougher	tests,	one	single	stage	
cleaner	and	two	split	cleaners.

3.	The	gold	in	the	ore	tended	to	follow	copper	and	not	iron.	Test	LS2476	and	LS2551	showed	that	by	plotting	
Au	 recovery	vs.	Cu	 recovery,	 the	 relationship	had	correlation	coefficients	of	0.9	 to	~1,	whilst	Au/Fe	 ranged	
from	0.58	to	0.87.	
	
4.	In	terms	of	lead	in	zinc,	having	a	split	cleaner	with	regrind	had	the	best	results	as	the	rougher	cleaner	had	
~16%	Zn	recovery	with	6%	of	the	lead	(LS2552),	however	overall	(including	the	scavenger	cleaners)	it	did	not	
perform	any	better	than	the	other	tests.	Conducting	differential	flotation	of	copper/lead	and	zinc	may	improve

17.1 	RESOURCES	

	
During	 2010	 all	 resource	 estimations	 were	 reviewed.	 Further	 work	 will	 be	 required	 on	 some	 of	 the	
resources	but	all	have	been	reviewed	as	being	suitable	for	reporting.	While	most	of	the	resource	figures	in	
this	 report	 have	 changed,	 the	 underlying	 models	 have	 not	 changed.	 The	 increase	 or	 decrease	 in	 the	
resources	contained	in	most	of	the	models	has	come	from	the	re‐optimization	of	the	estimates,	using	current	
gold	 prices	 and	 operating	 costs.	 The	 resource	 models	 were	 determined	 to	 be	 economically	 viable	 for	
extraction.	
	
However,	 new	 drilling	 have	 been	 completed	 at	 some	 deposits	 since	 Crocodile	 Gold's	 last	 Resource	 and	
Reserve	 statement	 in	 2009.	 These	 deposits	 have	 been	 re‐modeled	 during	 the	 current	 reporting	 period.	
These	 models	 have	 also	 been	 optimized	 in	 the	 same	 manner	 as	 the	 older	 estimates.	 Table	 17‐4	 below	
highlights	which	models	have	been	reviewed	and	re‐optimized,	and	those	which	have	been	re‐estimated	and	
optimized.	
	
The	optimization	process	for	each	open	pit	deposit	was	as	follows;	
	

 Model	imported	into	MineMap™	software	for	processing.	
o Model	was	optimized	using	the	Lerch‐Grossman	Pit	Optimizer.	 	This	optimizer	uses	several	

inputs	which	are	detailed	as	below:	
o Average	 density	 (SG)	was	 set	 as	 the	 oxide	 density	 value	 on	 unpopulated	 blocks.	 Assigned	

density	values	in	the	models	were	used	for	populated	blocks.	
o Cut‐off	profit	value	was	set	at	$A35.37/gram	which	is	equivalent	to	$A1,100	per	ounce	
o Process	 recovery	was	 set	 at	 90%	 for	 all	material	 types,	 this	 reflects	 the	 average	 recovery	

seen	through	the	process	plant	
o Fixed	 processing	 cost	 was	 set	 at	 $A17per	 tonne,	 this	 reflects	 the	 costs	 since	 commercial	

production	commenced	in	mid‐2010	
o Mining	costs	were	taken	from	the	current	contracted	rates	and	factored	to	a	tonnage	(rates	

normally	calculated	on	BCM's).	Examples	of	these	rates	can	be	seen	in	Table	17‐3	below	
o The	pit	wall	angle	was	also	utilized;	this	was	set	to	40o	for	material	mined	within	oxide	and	

50o	 for	material	mined	 below	 the	 oxide	 zone.	 These	 figures	 are	 generally	what	 is	 used	 in	
Crocodile	Gold's	current	mining	areas	but	will	need	more	detailed	review	before	mining	can	
commence	in	new	mining	areas.	

o When	all	these	parameters	are	added	to	the	optimizing	process,	an	LG	pit	shell	is	generated	
for	reporting.	

o For	 all	 optimizations	 of	 2010	 resources,	 this	 LG1100	 pit	 shell	 was	 then	 exported	 out	 of	
MineMap™	 and	 imported	 into	Micromine™	 software.	 At	 this	 point	 the	 resource	 estimation	
was	then	coded	for	material	above	the	pit	shell	and	below	the	current	surface	(which	could	
be	the	mined	surface)	

o This	coded	data	was	then	exported	into	Microsoft™	Excel	for	processing.	The	block	size	and	
cut‐off	 grade	was	used	 to	determine	 the	 tonnes	 and	 grade	 of	material	within	 the	 shell.	 All	
these	model	calculation	spreadsheets	have	been	saved	for	future	use	and	review.	

o The	optimized	numbers	were	then	entered	into	the	current	resource	statement	above	
o In	some	cases	the	resource	was	reduced	due	to	the	absence	of	optimizations	(e.g.	Esmeralda),	

for	others	the	resource	was	increased,	as	the	previous	optimization	was	at	a	much	lower	gold	
price	(e.g.	Pine	Creek	Deposits)

	 	 Australia	
	

[205]	
	

As	can	be	seen	in	Table	17‐6	above,	new	resources	have	been	estimated	for;	
 Tom's	Gully	
 Mt	Bundy	(purchased	by	Crocodile	Gold	after	last	resource	statement	released)	
 Howley	
 Mottrams	
 Brocks	Creek	
 Cosmo	
 Princess	Louise	
 Iron	Blow	

	

During	2010,	new	drilling	was	conducted	on	another	two	deposits,	namely	North	Point	and	Brocks	Creek.	It	
was	decided	to	use	the	original	model	for	North	Point	as	a	large	portion	of	the	drilling	completed	has	been	
conducted	in	the	mined	environment,	with	very	little	new	drilling	completed	outside	the	mined	area,	hence	
it	was	decided	not	to	update	the	resource	estimation	for	this	deposit.	

At	Brocks	Creek,	drilling	was	completed	in	late	2010	in	an	area	that	has	also	been	mined.		This	drilling	was	
completed	just	ahead	of	the	active	mining	areas.	The	resources	shown	in	Table	17‐1	are	in	fact	the	reserves	
as	estimated	from	the		grade	control	drilling	completed	during	the	year.	

The	Brocks	Creek	mine	 is	 coming	close	 to	 the	end	of	 its	economic	viability	and	 therefore	no	new	Mineral	
Resource	 estimation	 was	 conducted	 on	 any	 of	 the	 new	 drilling.	 	 Any	 mineralization	 defined	 outside	 the	
current	mining	areas	would	not	fulfill	the	economic	conditions	required	for	Mineral	Resource	estimation	and	
therefore	cannot	be	included	in	Table	17‐1,	hence	only	the	remaining	Mineral	Reserves	have	been	included.

17.3 	GREATER	HOWLEY	PROJECT	

	

In	November	2010	Crocodile	Gold	issued	a	revised	NI43‐101	compliant	resource	statement	for	the	
Howley	Project	 (formerly	known	as	 the	Chinese	Project).	 Indicated	and	 Inferred	resources	were	
reported	for	the	Howley	South	Extended,	Howley1,	2,	3	and	Howley	Western	lodes	using	a	0.7	g/t	
Au	cut‐off	grade.	Resources	for	the	Mottrams	and	Big	Howley	Deposits	were	adapted	from	a	NI43‐
101	report	written	by	Odessa	Resources	Pty	Ltd	titled	"Overview	of	the	Geology,	Mineral	Resources	
and	Mineral	Reserves	and	Exploration	Potential	 of	 the	Northern	Territories	Gold	Properties",	 July	
2009.	

The	 reader	 is	 referred	 to	 Ghazanfari,	 F.	 (2010)	 Resource	 Update,	 Howley	 Project,	 Pine	 Creek	
Geosyncline,	Northern	Territory,	Australia	Amended	43‐101	Technical	Report.	 November	 4,	 2010	
for	full	details	of	the	resource	estimations.	This	report	can	be	accessed	on	the	SEDAR	web	site.	

A	 new	 resource	 model	 has	 been	 completed	 for	 Howley	 since	 the	 November	 2010	 resource	
update.	Two	separate	areas	comprise	the	Howley	model,	namely	Mottrams	and	Howley.	 	These	
areas	have	been	modeled	separately	as	distinct	models.		The	Mottrams	area	has	been	defined	by	
extensive	close‐spaced	(5m	x	10m)	drilling	completed	during	2010.	Consequently,	this	model	has	
been	 compiled	 using	 a	 smaller	 block	 size	 than	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 Greater	 Howley	 resource	 area.	
Hence,	the	two	areas	are	listed	and	tabulated	separately	in	this	report.	Mottrams	is	currently	one	
of	the	main	mining	areas	at	Howley.	The	remainder	of	the	Howley	model	is	reported	below.	

	

17.4 	HOWLEY	DEPOSIT		

	

Mineralization	
	
Mineralization	at	the	South	Howley	deposit	is	developed	at	a	lower	stratigraphic	level	of	the	GTF	
compared	with	the	other	deposits	of	the	Greater	Howley	Project,	and	a	significant	amount	of	the	
mineralization	is	localized	at	or	near	the	contact	between	sediments	and	the	western	side	of	the	
inner	Zamu	Dolerite.	Mineralization	near	this	contact	is	contained	within	a	2‐10m	thick	lodes	and	
is	 continuous	along	strike	and	 locally	down‐dip.	 	 	The	extent	of	 the	down‐dip	continuity	 is	not	
sufficiently	known	due	to	the	lack	of	drilling	and	it	is	recommended	that	more	holes	be	drilled	to	
test	down‐dip	mineralization.	

Several	semi‐parallel	 lodes	are	developed	deeper	within	 the	dolerite	host.	On	 the	eastern	 limb,	
steeper	 lodes	controlled	by	axial‐planar	shearing	are	present.	 	These	structures	are	 intersected	
intermittently	due	to	the	wide	drill	hole	spacing.	Crocodile	Gold	drilled	several	holes	into	these	
zones	 to	boost	 confidence	 in	 the	mineralization.	 It	has	been	 identified	 that	 these	eastern	 lodes	
can	host	high	grade	gold	mineralization	but	the	strike	extent	of	this	higher	grade	mineralization	
is	 limited	and	difficult	 to	 trace.	Closer	spaced,	shallow	angle	grade	control	style	drilling	will	be	
required	prior	to	any	decision	to	mine.	

Mineralization	 at	 the	Howley	deposit	 occurs	 in	 lodes	within	 the	highly	deformed	 thrusted	 and	
folded	GTF.	 The	 fold	 is	 asymmetrical	 and	 relatively	 open	with	 bedding	 at	 ‐60°	 on	 the	western	
limb	and	overturned	 to	 be	dipping	 sub‐vertically	 at	 ‐80°	 on	 the	 eastern	 limb.	 	 	 Lodes	 are	 sub‐



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

	 	 Australia	
								

[208]	
	

parallel	 to	 the	 bedding.	 Grade	 control	 drilling	 has	 also	 shown	 that	 a	 significant	 amount	 of	
mineralization	occurs	 along	 the	 contact	 between	 the	Zamu	Dolerite	 and	 the	GTF.	This	 is	much	
more	prevalent	on	the	fold	hinge	axis	and	was	delineated	mainly	with	closer	spaced	grade	control	
drilling	during	mining.	

Mineralization	at	the	Old	Big	Howley	Pit	deposit	occurs	in	lodes	located	within	the	vicinity	of	the	
axial	plane	of	the	Howley	Anticline.			There	are	three	types	of	lodes;	vertical	eastern	lodes,	central	
lodes	which	dip	from	‐40°	to	‐70°	to	the	west,	and	western	lodes	that	dip	about	‐60°	to	the	west.	
All	these	lodes	are	within	the	GTF	but	unlike	South	Howley,	there	is	no	recognizable	marker	like	
the	Zamu	Dolerite.	

Mineralization	in	the	Western	lodes	consists	of	stacked	highly	folded	and	thrusted	sediments	and	
GTF	units	which	are	mineralized.	Ore‐bearing	lodes	are	concentrated	along	the	limbs	and	some	of	
the	erupted	hinge	zones.	

Gold	mineralization	 is	 broadly	 divided	 into	 eastern	 and	western	 domains	 based	 on	 structures	
relative	 to	 the	 Howley	 Anticline	 and	 is	 contained	 in	 narrow	 lodes.	 Gold	mineralization	 in	 the	
eastern	 domain	 is	 spatially	 related	 to	 mineralized	 structures	 within	 and	 proximal	 to	 the	 fold	
hinge	 of	 the	 Howley	 Anticline.	 Gold	 mineralization	 in	 the	 western	 domain	 is	 associated	 with	
shear	zones	parallel	to	the	fold	hinge	along	the	western	limb	of	the	Howley	Anticline.	Lodes	are	
generally	 structurally	 complex	 and	 pinch	 and	 swell	 in	 response	 to	 their	 intersection	 with	
competent	 and/or	 geochemically	 reactive	 lithological	 units.	 Lodes	 contain	 varying	 degrees	 of	
quartz,	pyrite,	arsenopyrite,	minor	pyrrhotite	and	sericite	alteration.	

	
Drilling	Methods	
	

RC	drilling	was	utilized	as	the	main	drilling	method	at	 the	Howley	deposit,	as	this	was	deemed	
appropriate	for	the	low	grade,	disseminated	style	of	mineralization	present.		During	2010,	limited	
diamond	 drilling	 was	 conducted	 in	 the	 Howley	 area	 with	 3	 holes	 drilled	 under	 the	 current	
Howley	 open	 pit.	 These	 holes	 were	 used	 to	 identify	 deep	 mineralization	 at	 depth	 below	 the	
current	pit.	

Various	generations	of	RC	drilling	were	used	in	the	recent	resource	estimation.	 	Crocodile	Gold	
used	RC	drilling	with	specific	controls	on	collar	 location	and	construction	to	assist	with	sample	
recovery	and	hole	depth.	All	holes	were	drilled	using	PVC	hole	collar	pipe	placed	at	a	depth	that	
covered	the	loose	overburden	to	ensure	the	collar	did	not	collapse.	This	generally	meant	that	all	
holes	were	 able	 to	be	drilled	 to	 the	 final	 required	depth	without	drill	 rods	becoming	 "bogged"	
(stuck).		All	samples	collected	were	generally	dry	as	the	RC	rigs	used	had	sufficient	air	pressure	
to	ensure	they	remained	dry.	At	any	time	when	a	wet	sample	was	collected,	this	was	recorded	in	
the	 drill	 log.	 These	 samples	 were	 left	 to	 dry	 before	 being	 split.	 Most	 samples	 collected	 by	
Crocodile	Gold	were	split	using	a	cone	splitter,	with	site	Crocodile	Gold	staff	ensuring	the	splitter	
was	kept	level	and	clean	at	all	times.	

All	RC	and	diamond	holes	drilled	were	surveyed	using	either	a	Eastman	single	shot	or	Reflex	Ezi‐
shot	 camera.	 	 All	 camera	 shots	 were	 recorded	 and	 stored	 in	 the	 Company	 database.	 Where	
possible	and	for	deeper	holes,	a	gyroscope	down‐hole	survey	was	conducted.		This	type	of	survey	
is	a	more	accurate	technique	and	can	be	used	to	check	the	quality	performance	of	the	downhole	
cameras.	No	significant	issues	were	identified	in	this	process.

[209]	
	

All	collar	locations	were	initially	surveyed	by	mine	site	survey	personnel,	and	then	the	drill	pads	
were	cleared	for	drilling,	with	the	location	peg	returned	once	the	site	was	cleared.	After	drilling,	
the	mine	survey	crew	would	then	re‐survey	the	collar	location.	At	times	when	the	site	Crocodile	
Gold	 survey	 team	were	unable	 to	 survey	 collar	pegs,	 a	 local	Darwin	Contractor	 (AusSurv)	was	
used	to	survey	the	collar	locations.	

All	collars	were	then	entered	into	a	database	and	validated.	At	this	stage,	if	significant	differences	
were	present	between	design	co‐ordinates	and	survey	pick‐ups,	 the	 surveyor	was	notified	and	
the	 hole	 collar	 was	 re‐surveyed.	 Once	 all	 survey	 and	 sample	 information	 was	 validated	 the	
drilling	pads	were	rehabilitated	with	the	collar	capped	and	the	drill	pad	cleaned	of	all	sampling	
materials.	

The	 sampling	 methodology	 used	 for	 RC	 drilling	 was	 to	 collect	 1m	 samples	 through	 the	 rig‐
mounted	cone	splitter.	The	sample	reject	(material	from	the	drillhole	not	collected)	was	bagged	
and	stored	in	case	further	samples	are	required.	At	a	given	interval	(usually	one	in	25	samples)	a	
duplicate	 field	 sample	 was	 collected	 by	 placing	 a	 second	 calico	 bag	 on	 the	 cone	 splitter.	 This	
collection	 of	 field	 duplicate	 samples	 assesses	 the	 suitability	 of	 the	 field	 sampling	 technique.	
Reviews	 of	 the	 field	 duplicate	 data	 suggests	 there	 are	 no	 serious	 concerns	with	 this	 sampling	
method.		

On	the	drill	rig	the	Crocodile	Gold	staff	member	would	also	insert	blind	standards	of	known	grade	
and	 also	 coarse	 blank	 standards	 for	 analysis.	 These	 QAQC	 samples	 are	 then	 analyzed	 at	 the	
laboratory	 together	 with	 the	 field	 samples.	 Once	 the	 assay	 results	 were	 obtained,	 they	 were	
checked	to	ensure	accuracy	of	the	laboratory.	

		

Specific	Gravity/Bulk	Density	Data	
	

During	 2010,	 Crocodile	 Gold	 used	 many	 of	 the	 pulp	 rejects	 for	 density	 analysis,	 in	 order	 to	
increase	 the	 coverage	 of	 density	 values	 throughout	 the	 Howley	 deposit	 and	 hence	 ensure	 an	
accurate	overall	density.		The	method	of	analysis	was	by	using	a	vacuum	pycnometer	on	sample	
pulp	rejects	from	the	laboratory.

TABLE	17‐7	SG	RESULTS	FOR	HOWLEY	DEPOSIT	

General	
	
Upon	completion	of	drilling	 in	October	2010,	 the	Crocodile	Gold	 team	worked	with	Geostat	on	
updating	 the	 geological	 and	 mineralogical	 interpretations	 of	 the	 Howley	 deposit.	 No	
comprehensive	 resource	 updates	 have	 been	 completed	 on	 the	Howley	 trend	 for	 several	 years,

mainly	due	to	the	complex	nature	of	the	mineralization	and	the	sheer	size	of	the	deposit.	It	was	
decided	that	the	model	needed	a	complete	update	for	several	reasons;	these	being:	

 The	poor	reconciliation	of	the	model	with	the	milled	grade.	During	the	time	that	the	
Howley	pit	supplied	the	majority	of	ore	to	the	mill,	the	model	performed	poorly,	suggesting	
fewer	tonnes	at	higher	grade.		It	was	not	possible	to	replicate	this	in	the	pit;	therefore	a	
new	interpretation	was	required.	

 The	wireframes	were	generated	using	a	lower	cut	of	0.7g/t	Au	which	is	identical	to	the	
lower	cut	for	Low	Grade	ore.		It	was	decided	that	this	lower	cut	should	be	lowered	to	
remove	the	possibility	of	artificially	influencing	the	model	at	high	grades.	

 A	greater	understanding	of	the	geology	and	structures	has	been	gained	through	the	past	14	
months	of	mining,	leading	to	improved	accuracy	of	the	new	interpretations.	

 The	deposit	had	not	been	interpreted	as	one	overall	package	for	many	years,	with	
wireframes	compiled	for	separate	areas	by	different	authors.		It	was	decided	to	generate	a	
new	set	of	wireframes	which	was	complete	from	north	to	south.	This	set	was	then	finalized	
and	validated	by	Geostat.	

 An	updated	set	of	wireframes	will	also	provide	a	new	and	current	set	of	information	to	the	
mining	team	to	assist	with	hole	planning	and	mine	scheduling. 
 

Geostat	 has	 been	 working	 since	 October	 2010	 on	 finalizing	 the	 geological	 and	 mineralogical	
wireframes.	 Since	 completion	 a	 new	 resource	 estimation	 has	 been	 generated	 and	 is	 reported	
below.	This	model	is	now	to	be	used	in	generating	a	new	reserve	base	in	the	Howley	Deposit	area.	

Geological	Interpretation	

Geological	 interpretations	 have	 been	 completed	 on	 the	 Howley	 deposit	 using	 downhole	
lithological	 logging	 and	 surface	 structural	 interpretations	 throughout	 the	 deposit	 area.	 These	
geological	 interpretations	 are	 critical	 due	 to	 the	 relationship	 between	 the	 Zamu	 dolerite	 and	
mineralization.	 As	 can	 be	 seen	 in	 Figure	 17‐1	 below,	 the	 structural	 complexity	 seen	 in	 the	
geological	 interpretations	has	been	 captured	 in	 the	 solid	modeling,	making	 it	possible	 to	more	
accurately	delineate	the	mineralogical	wireframes.

A	 total	 of	 205	wireframes	were	 delineated	 for	 the	 Howley	 deposit,	 using	 a	 0.4	 g/t	 Au	 cut‐off.	
Internal	waste	zones	within	 the	ore	 lodes	have	been	 incorporated	 for	continuity	down	dip	and	
along	strike	as	necessary.	The	0.4g/t	Au	lower	cut	was	chosen	as	this	threshold	was	deemed	to	
define	the	greatest	mineralization	continuity	without	being	too	low	in	this	large	dataset.	

The	wireframes	 in	 the	Howley	deposit	were	 compiled	using	 the	 in‐pit	mapping	 and	 geological	
data	where	available,	including	the	structural	models	generated	by	SRK	in	the	early	2000's.	SRK	
conducted	 an	 extensive	 mapping	 campaign	 of	 surface	 outcrops,	 with	 a	 complex	 pattern	 of	
transverse,	 transform	 and	 thrust	 faults	 identified	 and	 traced	where	 present.	 	 These	 structural	
models	were	subsequently	verified	by	in‐pit	mapping	by	Crocodile	Gold	staff	geologists.

Compositing	
 
Assay	 intervals	within	 the	resource	database	were	examined	 to	determine	 the	dominant	sample	
length.		Within	the	mineralization	wireframes,	95%	of	all	assays	comprise	an	interval	length	of	1m,	
and	 hence	 the	 assay	 data	 was	 composited	 to	 1m	 intervals,	 honoring	 drillhole‐wireframe	
intersections.			

Top‐cut	Applications	to	Composite	Data	
 
Composite	data	within	the	resource	database	was	assessed	for	the	need	of	a	top‐cut	to	be	applied	
to	data	prior	to	grade	estimation.		Top‐cuts	ranging	from	2g/t	Au	to	18g/t	Au	were	applied	to	
selected	lodes	where	the	coefficient	of	variation	was	high,	and/or	there	was	a	large	variance

Domaining	

Since	the	Howley	deposit	 is	represented	by	a	complex	overturned	 fold,	with	mineralization	sub‐
parallel	to	the	dolerite	units	within	this	fold	complex,	consideration	was	given	to	domaining	of	the	
deposit	as	to	enable	representative	variography	analysis	of	the	respective	lodes.	

The	Howley	deposit	was	divided	into	11	broad	zones,	on	the	basis	of	overall	lode	dips.		Figure	17‐5	
below	 illustrates	 the	 subdivision	 of	 lodes	 into	 the	 broad	 variography	 zones	 on	 a	 typical	 cross‐

Methodology	&	Results	

Variography	 analysis	 using	 log	 variograms	 was	 performed	 on	 composite	 data	 to	 provide	
variography	 parameters	 for	 the	 resource	 model.	 	 The	 11	 zones	 were	 used	 to	 determine	
variography	parameters	for	each	zone,	with	log	variograms	used	and	the	results	back‐transformed	
to	traditional	parameters.	 	It	was	not	possible	to	perform	variography	analysis	on	Zone	8,	due	to	
insufficient	data	levels.	

Mineralization	orientations	were	determined	for	each	zone	via	 interpretation	of	variograms	fans	
in	 the	horizontal,	 across‐strike	vertical	and	dip	planes.	 	Table	17‐9	 tabulates	 the	orientations	as

Block	model	creation	and	extents	
 
A	3D	block	model,	howley_feb2011.mdl	was	generated	using	Surpac	software	with	origin,	extents	
and	attributes	defined	below	in	Table	17‐11.	 	Parent	blocks	of	10m	x	4m	x	5m	size	(Y	x	X	x	Z)	
were	subdivided	 into	sub‐blocks	of	5m	x	1m	x	2.5m	 in	order	 to	 fill	 areas	adjacent	 to	wireframe	
boundaries.		The	wireframes	were	used	to	limit	the	blocks	available	for	grade	interpolation,	with	
block	centroid	locations	used	to	define	the	blocks	and	sub‐blocks	for	interpolation.	
	
Since	the	Big	Howley	area	of	the	Howley	deposit	is	located	500m	north	of	the	main	Howley	
deposit,	it	was	decided	to	create	a	separate	Surpac	block	model	for	this	area,	
bighowley_feb2011.mdl.	Table	17‐11	tabulates	the	origin	and	extents	of	this	area.		Attributes	in	this

Estimation	parameters	and	methodology	
	
Ordinary	kriging	using	parameters	derived	from	the	back‐transformed	log	variograms	was	used	to	
estimate	Au	grades	for	the	Howley	deposit.		The	skewed	nature	of	the	data	distribution	makes	this	
technique	ideal,	whereas	other	techniques	such	as	inverse	distance	interpolation	assume	a	normal	
distribution,	 which	 can	 lead	 to	 errors	 if	 the	 data	 is	 not	 cut	 appropriately.	 	 Inverse	 distance	
techniques	 also	 do	 not	 utilize	 the	 information	 obtained	 from	 the	 variogram	 in	 interpolation	 of	
blocks,	and	thus	the	spatial	correlation	between	composites	is	not	taken	into	account.			

Grade	interpolation	
	
Each	lode	was	treated	as	a	separate	hard	boundary,	restricting	the	grade	interpolation	to	drillhole	
data	located	within	each	lode.		A	minimum	of	4	samples	and	a	maximum	of	25	samples	were	used	
to	interpolate	grades	into	each	block.		A	discretization	array	of	5	(north)	by	2	(east)	by	5	(RL)	was	
used	to	refine	the	kriging	weights	for	each	model	block.	

Two	interpolation	passes	were	conducted	for	all	lodes.		Search	ellipse	parameters	were	guided	by	
variography	ranges,	with	40m	x	20m	x	10m	used	for	all	 lodes	in	the	initial	pass	of	 interpolation.		
For	the	second	interpolation	pass,	search	ellipses	for	all	lodes	were	expanded	to	80m	x	40m	x	20m.		
Only	 those	 blocks	 unfilled	 by	 the	 first	 pass	 were	 interpolated	 by	 the	 second	 pass,	 and	 grades	
estimated	 from	 the	 first	 interpolation	 pass	were	 left	 unchanged.	 	 All	 unfilled	 blocks	within	 the	
lodes	 after	 these	 interpolation	 passes	 were	 left	 un‐estimated	 and	 will	 not	 be	 included	 in	 the	
resource.	
 
Model	Validation	
	
The	Howley	block	model	was	validated	by	several	methods,	including	visual	validations	on‐screen,	
global	statistical	comparisons	of	input	and	block	grades,	and	local	grade/depth	relationships.		The	
model	 was	 validated	 visually	 by	 viewing	 vertical	 sections	 and	 plans	 of	 the	 block	 model,	 with	
spatial	 comparison	of	 interpolated	block	grades	against	 input	 composite	grades	 to	ensure	grade	
trends	were	represented	correctly.			
	
Global	statistical	validations	
	

Average	cut	composite	grades	were	statistically	compared	with	mean	block	grades	by	lode,	with	
summary	results	tabulated	in	Table	17‐13	below.

CLASSIFICATION	

 
The	Mineral	Resource	for	the	Howley	deposit	has	been	classified	in	accordance	with	the	NI43‐101	
guidelines.		Assessment	criteria	include	drillhole	spacing,	sample	locations,	sampling	density,	and	
lode	geometry,	reliability	of	data,	geological	confidence	and	grade	continuity.	 	The	Howley	model	
was	 classified	 using	 a	 combination	 of	 kriging	 variance	 and	 a	 depth	 threshold.	 The	 model	 was	
initially	 classified	 into	 Indicated	 and	 Inferred	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 kriging	 variance.	 	 Some	 isolated	
clusters	 of	 Indicated	 blocks	 were	 located	 at	 depth	 amongst	 Inferred	 blocks	 in	 areas	 of	 sparse	
drilling	 density.	 	 Hence,	 an	 RL	 threshold	 of	 975mRL	was	 used	 to	 further	 classify	 the	model	 by	
downgrading	Indicated	blocks	to	Inferred	below	this	threshold.		Some	grade	control	drilling	exists

Recommendations	

A	number	of	 recommendations	are	made	 in	 light	of	 the	completed	resource	model	 for	Howley,	
including	regular	model	updates	and	reconciliation,	density	and	PAF	interpolations,	and	further	
drill	testing.			

It	 is	 recommended	 that	 the	 Howley	model	 be	 regularly	 up‐dated	 using	 geological	 and	 drilling	
information	gathered	from	the	grade	control	operations,	and	regular	reconciliations	with	the	mill	
grade.		This	ongoing	update	process	will	allow	the	performance	of	the	model	to	be	analysed	on	a	
regular	basis.			

It	 is	 also	 recommended	 that	 the	 density	 and	 PAF	 results	 from	 sampling	 be	 interpolated	
throughout	the	deposit.	Interpolation	of	these	variables	is	possible	now	with	recently	increased	
data	levels,	and	will	allow	for	more	accurate	analysis	of	ore	tonnages	to	be	mined.		

It	 is	 recommended	 that	 regular	 density	 determinations	 be	 continued,	 particularly	 as	 mining	
progresses.	 	Density	determinations	using	the	vacuum	pycnometer	method	is	recommended	for	
all	 future	drillholes.	 	Within	the	pit,	 it	 is	recommended	that	grab	samples	be	taken	on	a	regular	
basis	per	bench	mined	and	locations	surveyed	to	verify	mined	tonnages.

Several	 areas	 exist	 within	 the	 Howley	 deposit	 that	 will	 require	 further	 drill	 testing.	 It	 is	
recommended	 that	 the	 mining	 team	 now	 take	 responsibility	 for	 this	 drilling,	 as	 it	 should	 be	
driven	by	the	mining	locations	required.	The	use	of	the	grade	control	rig,	when	not	required	for	
production	purposes,	will	make	it	easier	to	drill	smaller	definition	programs	as	necessary.	

	

17.5 	COSMO	DEPOSIT	

 
Regional	and	Project	Geology	
	

The	 Cosmo	 lodes	 are	 hosted	 within	 the	 Upper	 to	 Middle	 Koolpin	 formation,	 which	 consists	 of	
interbedded	siltstones,	mudstones,	phyllites,	dolerite	sills	and	greywacke	units.	

The	 greywacke	 units	 host	 the	majority	 of	 the	 known	 economic	mineralization.	 The	 entire	mine	
sequence	is	folded	into	a	tightly	plunging	anticline	(~45o	to	grid	North).	This	plunge	may	shallow	
to	grid	north;	however,	current	structural	modeling	indicates	that	this	may	be	due	to	faulting	and	
vertical	displacement	of	the	northern	portion	of	the	mine	sequence.	

The	mine	sequence	appears	to	represent	distal	cyclical	marine	deposition	with	three	identifiable	
stratigraphic	repeats.	These	repeats	are	defined	as	the	Outer,	Middle	and	Hanging	wall	sequences.		

There	are	 three	 faults	 identified	at	Cosmo	as	controlling	mineralization,	 these	are	named	F1,	F2	
and	F3.	 	F1	and	F2	are	steeply	north	dipping	and	cross‐cut	the	sequence.	They	appear	to	control	
the	main	mineralized	 shoots	 as	 north	 and	 south	 bounding	 features.	 F3	 strikes	 north‐south	 and	
divides	the	resource	into	upper	and	lower	domains.	F3	appears	to	be	axial	planar	and	further	to	
the	north	looks	to	be	responsible	for	mineralization	in	the	hanging	wall	of	the	main	shoots.	

Alteration	 is	 of	 the	 lower	 greenschist	 facies	 with	 some	 structurally	 related	 phyllite	 units	 and	
narrow	aureoles	of	higher	grade	contact	alteration	related	to	the	emplacement	of	the	dolerite	sills.	
The	carbonate	rich	greywacke	ore	host	units	are	thought	to	represent	a	mineralization	style	more	
closely	related	to	the	Telfer	deposit	(Newcrest	Mining	Ltd,	Western	Australia)	than	a	banded	iron	
formation.	

Ore	 grade	 intercepts	 are	 closely	 related	 to	 areas	of	 elevated	pyrite,	 pyrrhotite	 and	 arsenopyrite	
within	 the	 Greywacke	 units.	 The	 sulphides	 are	 often	 laminated;	 however,	 there	 is	 evidence	 of	
replacement	of	carbonate	minerals	(overgrowth)	within	the	lode	units.	

	
Mineralization	
	
Three	main	lodes	were	delineated	for	the	Cosmo	East	Zone	of	the	Cosmo	deposit,	corresponding	to	
an	 approximate	 20g/m	 Au	 cutoff.	 Previous	 interpretations	 were	 used	 as	 a	 guide	 to	 defining	
mineralization	within	this	East	Zone.	The	100	lode	is	located	in	the	hangingwall,	and	the	other	two	
lodes	(200	and	300)	within	the	footwall.		

Interpretation	 of	 previous	 drilling,	 including	 holes	 CNT007	 and	 CNT007W1	 has	 highlighted	 the	
presence	of	a	faulted‐off	sliver	of	the	100	lode.		The	strike	and	dip	of	this	sliver	has	been	projected	
up	 from	 the	100	 lower	 lode	with	 the	 up‐dip	 and	 strike	 extents	 limited	 by	 lack	 of	 drilling.	 	 This	
sliver	incorporates	three	historical	drill	holes	established	prior	to	Crocodile	Gold	ownership,	and	
was	previously	modeled	as	an	isolated	parasitic	fold.

In	previous	reporting	the	east	lodes	have	been	designated	the	100,	220	and	230	lodes,	from	east	
to	west	respectively,	with	the	100	being	the	primary	lode.	The	220	and	230	lodes	have	been	re‐
named	to	the	200	and	300	lodes	respectively,	to	simplify	nomenclature	for	the	mining	team	and	
to	afford	scope	for	logical	designation	of	minor	lodes	to	be	defined	in	the	future.	The	renaming	of	
these	lodes	does	not	reflect	any	change	in	current	thinking	with	respect	to	lode	relationships	and	
geometry.	

	

All	wireframing	was	conducted	 in	Datamine	with	sectionally	 interpreted	strings	generated	and	
snapped	to	drillholes	for	all	three	lodes,	and	linked	to	form	solids	and	validated.	 	Subsequently,	
these	 wireframed	 lodes	 were	 divided	 into	 an	 upper	 and	 lower	 zone	 separated	 by	 a	 zone	 of	
'inflexion'.	 	This	 inflexion	zone	 represents	an	area	of	 sub‐economic	grades	 and	also	 represents	
the	change	in	dip	from	the	upper	part	dipping	steeply	to	the	north‐east,	to	the	lower	part	dipping	
steeply	to	the	south‐west.	 	Figure	17‐9	illustrates	the	geometry	of	the	100	lode,	with	the	upper	
100	lode	in	light	red,	the	inflexion	zone	in	pink	and	the	lower	100	lode	in	dark	red.

intercepts	were	generated	and	the	wireframes	then	modified	to	correct	any	snapping	errors.

Crocodile	Gold	Drilling	2009‐2010	

Drilling	completed	by	Crocodile	Gold	in	2009/2010	comprises	a	total	of	12	parent	diamond	holes.	
All	holes	were	drilled	by	either	one	of	 two	contractors,	K&W	drilling	or	Grid	Drilling.	All	holes	
were	drilled	using	either	HQ,	HQ	triple	tube	or	NQ	diameters.	A	total	of	7,538.6	meters	of	drilling	
was	achieved	with	respect	to	the	parent	holes.

*	Note:	Some	of	the	Wedge	holes	have	total	depth	shown	from	surface	

All	 holes	were	 set	 out	 by	 the	mine	 site	 survey	 crew	prior	 to	 the	 drill	 pads	 being	 constructed.	
Holes	were	 then	re‐set	before	drilling	commenced.	At	 the	conclusion	of	drilling	 the	holes	were	
surveyed	by	the	mine	site	survey	crew.	

When	possible	all	holes	were	downhole	surveyed	using	a	Gyroscope	survey	instrument,	with	data	
collected	 at	 10	 to	 20m	 spacing	 down	 hole.	 During	 drilling	 each	 hole	 was	 surveyed	 using	 a	
downhole	camera	to	ensure	it	was	drilled	as	per	its	planned	orientation.	
	
Previous	Drilling	

Several	companies	have	held	the	Cosmo	deposit	over	the	years	with	Dominion	Mining,	Northern	
Gold	NL	(as	part	of	 the	Burnside	 Joint	Venture	with	Harmony	Gold),	GBS	Mining	and	Crocodile	
Gold	 all	 having	 drilled	 this	 deposit	 since	 the	 early	 1990's	when	mining	was	 completed	 on	 the	
main	Cosmo	pit.	
	
Within	 the	Cosmo	area	 there	are	a	 total	of	941	exploration	drill	holes	with	breakdown	by	drill	
type	 tabulated	 in	Table	17‐15	below.	Not	 all	 of	 these	holes	were	used	 in	 the	generation	of	 the	
resource	model,	particularly	 the	RAB	holes	which	were	drilled	 into	 the	Phantom	pit	which	has	
subsequently	been	mined.

A	density	of	2.93	t/m3	was	used	in	reporting	of	model	tonnages	and	grades	for	the	100	lode,	with	
2.88	t/m3	used	to	report	the	200	and	300	lodes.		These	densities	were	derived	from	a	total	of	103	
wax	 encapsulated	 mineralized	 samples	 taken	 from	 ½	 HQ	 drill	 core.	 	 170	 samples	 were	 also	
selected	 from	 various	 lithologies	 and	 lodes	 for	 air	 pycnometer	 testing	 to	 validate	 these	 wax

these	located	in	the	sulphide	ore	zone.	
 
General	
	
A	 geostatistical	 resource	 estimate	was	 completed	on	 the	Eastern	Lodes,	 comprising	 part	 of	 the	
underground	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit	 in	February	2011.	 	The	aim	of	 this	work	was	 to	update	 the	
geostatistical	kriged	resource	of	the	Eastern	limb	Cosmo	Deeps	underground	orebody,	using	the	
latest	available	drilling	data	and	a	greater	understanding	of	 the	deposit	geology.	No	up‐date	on	
the	 Western	 Lodes	 has	 been	 completed	 to	 date	 as	 only	 limited	 drilling	 has	 intersected	 the	
mineralization	on	this	lode.	It	is	planned	to	extensively	drill	this	lode	in	2011	which	will	result	in	
a	resource	up‐date	before	the	next	resource	release.	
	

The	work	undertaken	included	the	following:	
	

 Upload	and	validation	of	new	drill	hole	data	
 Compositing	of	Au	assay	intervals	and	data	declustering	
 Statistical	analysis	of	Au	composites 
 Geostatistical	(variography)	analysis 
 Kriging	neighborhood	analysis	
 Interpolation	by	ordinary	kriging	of	Au	composites 
 Validation	of	the	resultant	block	model 
 Classification	and	reporting	of	results. 

 
The	mineralization	on	the	western	limb	will	be	assessed	with	future	drilling	as	only	a	few	holes	
drilled	during	2010	intersected	this	zone.

Geological	interpretation	

For	this	model	update,	the	original	Cosmo	wireframes	were	modified	in	areas	of	new	drilling.		As	
only	 a	 limited	 number	 of	 new	 holes	 were	 drilled	 into	 the	 deposit	 since	 the	 last	 resource	
estimation,	this	was	deemed	to	be	appropriate.	The	wireframing	methodology	is	detailed	above	in	
the	Mineralization	section.	
	
Geological	modeling	 has	 also	been	used	 in	 generating	 the	 resource,	with	modeling	 of	 the	main	
marker	dolerite	unit.		The	majority	of	mineralization	delineated	in	the	Cosmo	deposit	is	spatially	
associated	 with	 the	 hanging	 wall	 of	 the	 dolerite	 contact.	 Figure	 17‐10	 below	 illustrates	 the	
orientation	of	the	Zamu	dolerite.

Sample	 intervals	 within	 the	 exploration	 database	 were	 examined	 to	 determine	 the	 dominant	
sample	length.		Over	66%	of	all	sample	intervals	were	1m	in	length,	thus	the	data	was	composited	
to	 1m	 intervals,	 honouring	 drill	 hole‐wireframe	 intersections.	 	 Visual	 inspection	 of	 the	 data	
showed	 the	 composites	 to	 be	 spatially	 clustered,	 and	 thus	 declustering	 was	 undertaken.		
Composites	were	assigned	declustering	weights	whereby	values	in	areas	with	more	data	received	
less	weight	than	those	 in	sparsely	sampled	areas.	Declustered	and	clustered	statistics	were	both	
run	within	the	exploration	drill	hole	database	for	all	constrained	composite	data	by	domain,	and	
are	presented	in	Table	17‐16.	No	other	mineralisation	indicators	were	used,	as	data	was	extracted	
from	within	wireframes.

DEPOSIT	

From	the	summary	statistics	above	it	is	observed	that	the	declustered	mean	grades	of	each	lode	
are	lower	than	those	for	clustered	data.		Location	composite	statistics	reveal	the	100	Upper	Lode	
to	have	the	highest	gold	grades	within	the	Eastern	Lodes	area	of	the	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit,	with	
an	uncut	average	declustered	grade	of	5.65	g/t	Au.		All	lodes	exhibit	elevated	coefficient	of	
variance	values,	in	particular	the	300	Lode,	indicating	the	need	for	an	appropriate	top‐cut	to	be	
applied	prior	to	estimation.	
	

The	distribution	of	composites	suggest	a	lognormal	distribution	for	each	lode	as	shown	by	
statistical	plots	in	Figure	17‐11	to	Figure	17‐16,	with	the	exception	of	the	220	Lower	Lode.	This	
lode	exhibits	a	mixing	of	populations,	with	a	lower	grade	population	below	1.5g/t	Au,	and	the	
main	population	centred	around	3.0g/t	Au.		This	mixing	of	populations	is	likely	attributed	to	the	
individual	ore	shoots	within	the	lode;	these	shoots	are	spatially	integrated	and	too	narrow	to	be	
domained	individually.

Top‐cut	applications	to	composite	data	

Composite	 data	 within	 the	 exploration	 database	 was	 assessed	 for	 the	 need	 of	 a	 top‐cut	 to	 be	
applied	to	data	prior	to	grade	estimation.		The	determination	of	a	high‐grade	cut	is	made	on	the	
basis	of	histograms,	probability	plots	and	ranked	data	values,	with	the	general	criteria	for	the	top‐
cuts	being	a	marked	change,	an	inflection	point,	or	pronounced	disintegration	at	the	higher	end	of	
the	probability	distribution,	or	a	clear	break	within	ranked	composite	data.	
	

Since	 gold	 composites	 exhibit	 several	 high‐grade	 extreme	 values,	 with	 the	 mean	 grade	 low	
relative	 to	 the	 spread	 of	 data,	 and	 with	 an	 elevated	 coefficient	 of	 variation,	 top‐cutting	 of	 Au	
composites	is	necessary	to	reduce	the	impact	of	extreme	values	on	estimation	of	Au	grades.	Using	
the	above	criteria,	a	top‐cut	of	40	g/t	Au	was	determined	for	the	100	Upper	Lode,	35g/t	for	the	
100	Lower	Lode,	30	g/t	Au	for	the	200	and	300	Upper	Lodes,	and	20g/t	Au	for	the	200	and	300	
Lower	Lodes.	 	The	 inflexion	zones	did	not	warrant	the	application	of	a	top‐cut	due	to	their	 low	
maximum	grades	and	low	coefficient	of	variations.

Variography	

Variography	 analysis	 using	 lognormal	 variograms	 was	 performed	 on	 cut	 clustered	 composite	
data	for	the	resource	model.		In	order	to	provide	sufficient	data	for	reliable	variography	analysis,	
the	Upper	Lode	composites	of	 the	100,	200	and	300	 lodes	were	combined	together	to	 form	the	
Upper	Lode	domain;	and	similarly,	all	Lower	Lode	domains	were	combined	together	to	form	the	
Lower	Lode	domain.		The	inflexion	zones	were	not	included	for	variography	analysis	due	to	their	
low	composite	numbers.	
	

The	Upper	Lode	domain,	striking	315˚	is	characterized	by	a	steep	dip	of	‐85˚	towards	045˚,	with	
an	 interpreted	plunge	of	 ‐60˚	 towards	324˚.	 	The	Lower	Lode	domain	revealed	a	strike	of	330˚,	
with	a	steep	dip	of	‐80˚	towards	240˚	and	plunging	‐59˚	towards	313˚.

Variograms	with	two	spherical	structures	were	modeled	in	each	principal	direction,	with	results	
tabulated	 in	 Table	 17‐18	 below.	 	 Modeling	 was	 performed	 on	 lognormal	 variograms,	 and	 the	
resulting	parameters	back‐transformed	to	traditional	parameters.		The	quality	of	variograms	was	
fair	to	poor,	due	to	the	irregular	spatial	distribution	of	assay	composites	within	the	lodes,	and	low	
data	levels.		 	 	Sectional	interpretations	of	the	lodes	are	often	based	on	composites	within	one	or	
two	drillhole	intercepts,	and	thus	there	exists	little	composite	data	to	test	the	continuity	in	each	of	
the	principal	directions,	particularly	down‐dip	and	across‐lode.

A	 kriging	 neighborhood	 analysis	 (KNA)	 was	 undertaken	 for	 all	 lodes	 with	 the	 aim	 of	
minimizing	 conditional	 bias	 issues	 and	 determining	 the	 optimal	 block	 size,	 maximum	
number	of	samples,	and	maximum	search	ranges	 for	use	 in	 the	block	model.	 	 	 	The	KNA	
results,	 the	 lode	 domain	 geometry	 and	 previous	 model	 parameters	 were	 all	 used	 as	 a	
guide	 in	 the	 determination	 of	 the	 final	 parameters.	 	 The	KNA	 analysis	 concluded	 that	 a

block	size	for	use	in	the	Cosmo	block	model.

Estimation	parameters	and	methodology	
 
Ordinary	 kriging,	 using	 parameters	 derived	 from	 the	 lognormal	 variograms,	 was	 chosen	 to	
interpolate	grades	into	blocks	for	all	lodes.		The	skewed	nature	of	the	data	distribution	makes	this

technique	 ideal,	 whereas	 other	 techniques	 such	 as	 inverse	 distance	 interpolation	 assume	 a	
normal	 distribution,	 which	 can	 lead	 to	 errors	 if	 the	 data	 is	 not	 cut	 appropriately.	 	 	 Inverse	
distance	 techniques	 also	 do	 not	 utilize	 the	 information	 obtained	 from	 the	 variogram	 in	
interpolation	 of	 blocks,	 and	 thus	 the	 spatial	 correlation	 between	 samples	 is	 not	 taken	 into	
account.	
	
A	total	of	three	kriging	passes	were	performed,	with	the	second	interpolation	pass	utilizing	a	50%	
expanded	search	ellipse,	and	the	third	interpolation	pass	doubling	the	initial	search	extents	in	an	
attempt	to	fill	any	remaining	unfilled	blocks.	Only	those	blocks	unfilled	were	interpolated	by	each	
subsequent	 pass,	 and	 grades	 estimated	 from	 the	 previous	 interpolation	 passes	 were	 left	
unchanged.	
	
Each	lode	was	treated	as	a	separate	hard	boundary,	restricting	the	Au	grade	interpolation	to	drill	
hole	 data	 located	within	 each	 lode.	 	 The	Upper	 Lode,	 Lower	 Lode	 and	 Inflexion	 domains	were	
treated	 as	 separate	 hard	 boundaries,	 also	 restricting	 grade	 interpolations	 to	 drill	 hole	 data	
located	within	each	domain.	 	 	Domains	were	divided	into	interpolation	sub‐domains,	these	sub‐
domains	were	were	 treated	 as	 soft	 boundaries,	with	 blocks	 in	 each	 sub‐domain	 able	 to	 utilize	
composites	from	adjacent	sub‐domains	if	they	were	located	within	the	search	ellipse.		A	minimum	
of	4	composites	was	used	to	interpolate	each	block	grade	for	all	lodes,	with	maximum	numbers	of	
samples	as	determined	in	the	KNA	analysis	above.		A	discretization	array	of	5	(north)	by	2	(east)	
by	5	(RL)	was	used	to	refine	the	kriging	weights	for	each	model	block.	
	
A	 search	 ellipse	 is	 used	 to	 select	 the	 samples	 to	 estimate	 a	 particular	 block,	 and	 is	 generally	
guided	by	the	maximum	range	parameters	modeled	in	the	variography.		Maximum	search	ranges	
were	 determined	 by	 the	 kriging	 neighborhood	 analysis	 above.	 Table	 17‐22	 lists	 the	 search	
ellipses	 used	 for	 each	 hard	 boundary	 domain	 within	 each	 lode.	 Larger	 search	 ellipses	 were	
required	for	the	lower	lode	interpolation	domains	than	for	those	domains	in	the	upper	lodes,	as	
these	 domains	 contain	 a	 lower	 density	 of	 composite	 data,	 with	 wider	 spacing	 between	
composites.

A	 good	 overall	 reconciliation	 exists	 between	 average	 input	 composite	 grades	 and	mean	 block	
grades,	 with	 block	 grades	 representing	 a	 smoothed	 version	 of	 composite	 grades.	 	 The	 upper	
lodes,	with	a	higher	sample	density	show	a	robust	reconciliation	between	composite	grades	and	
block	grades.		The	lower	lodes	show	more	variability	in	composite	grade	trends,	due	to	the	lower	
sample	 density.	 	 Below	 650mRL,	 the	 number	 of	 samples	 drops	 significantly,	 and	 thus	 isolated	
samples	beneath	this	depth	have	a	disproportionate	influence	on	block	grades.			
	
	
Grade/Depth	Validations	
	
Figure	 17‐17	 to	 Figure	 17‐22	 illustrate	 the	 grade/depth	 relationship	 for	 each	 hard	 boundary	
domain	within	 the	Eastern	Lodes	of	 the	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit.	 	Both	 input	 composite	data	 and	
model	 grade	 data	 were	 averaged	 within	 20m	 RL	 increments	 for	 each	 domain,	 and	 plotted	
together	with	the	number	of	composites	to	assess	the	reliability	of	the	block	model.		The	inflexion	
zones	were	not	plotted,	due	to	their	small	size	and	few	drill	hole	intercepts.	
	
Comparison	 of	 model	 grades	 with	 composite	 grades	 for	 the	 100	 lode	 above	 650mRL	 (Figure	
17‐17	 &	 FIGURE	 17‐18)	 illustrates	 a	 close	 reconciliation,	 with	 model	 grades	 attempting	 to	
reproduce	the	fluctuations	in	composite	grades.		The	model	displays	an	average	consistent	grade	
of	 just	 above	5g/t	Au	down	 to	 this	 level,	 in	 line	with	 the	 overall	 average	 composite	 grades	 for	
these	 depths.	 	 Below	 650mRL,	 an	 information/edge	 effect	 is	 produced	 by	 low	 numbers	 of	
predominantly	low‐grade	composites	influencing	a	large	number	of	model	blocks,	with	few	other	
composites	to	control	grade	interpolation,	resulting	in	a	low	block	grade	for	the	lode	at	depth.

The	grade/depth	relationship	for	the	200	lode	shows	a	good	correlation	within	the	Upper		Lode,		
with		a	 	smoothing		of	 	composite		grades		present		in		the		Lower		Lode	(Figure	17‐19	&	Figure

contributed	to	this	smoothing	effect,	with	the	high	variability	of	input	composite	data	difficult	to	
reproduce.	 	Again,	an	information/edge	effect	 is	present	at	depth,	with	the	model	attempting	to	
reproduce	 the	 high	 composite	 average	 grade	 of	 5.99g/t	 Au	 at	 610mRL,	 and	 tailing	 off	 on	 an	
elevated	trend.		More	composites	are	required	to	lift	input	data	levels	and	to	provide	more	robust

Classification	 of	 this	 model	 used	 the	 same	methodology	 as	 that	 for	 the	 original	 model,	 with	 a	
surface	 used	 to	 separate	 Indicated	 blocks	 from	 Inferred	 blocks.	 	 Below	 the	 respective	
classification	surface	for	each	lode,	few	drillhole	intercepts	are	located	within	the	lode,	with	less	
definition	 of	 the	 lode	 continuity	 by	 drilling.	 	 Blocks	 within	 lodes	 at	 these	 depths	 were	 often	
interpolated	by	composite	data	from	sole	drillhole	intercepts	without	supporting	composite	data	
along	 strike	 or	 down‐dip,	 and	 thus	 an	 Inferred	 category	was	 considered	 appropriate	 for	 these	
blocks.

Examination	of	 the	assay	database	 revealed	 sample	 intervals	of	 varying	 lengths,	with	a	dominant	
sample	length	of	1m	representing	46%	of	all	samples	within	the	lode	wireframes.	
	
Composites	 were	 generated	 in	 1m	 length	 intervals	 downhole	 from	 drillhole	 collars,	 honouring	
drillhole‐wireframe	intersections.	
	
Statistics	were	run	within	 the	drillhole	database	 for	all	constrained	uncut	composite	data,	and	are	
presented	in	Table	17‐25.	No	other	mineralisation	indicators	were	used,	as	data	was	extracted	from	
within	wireframes.	
	
	

	
TABLE	17‐25	UNCUT	AND	CUT	COMPOSITE	STATISTICS,	IRON	BLOW	DEPOSIT	

Grade	populations	within	the	Iron	Blow	deposit	were	analyzed	statistically	for	capping	of	grades.	Top	
cuts	were	determined	for	all	elements,	to	reduce	their	high	coefficient	of	variation	and	to	restrict	the	
influence	of	 extreme	grade	 values	during	 interpolation.	Top cuts	 for	 individual	 elements	are	 listed	
above	in	Table	17‐25,	together	with	cut	composite	statistics.	SG	composite	data	did	not	necessitate	a	
top	cut,	due	to	its	low	coefficient	of	variation	and	even	spread	of	composite	grades.	
	
Correlation	scatterplots	 for	Au,	Pb,	Zn,	Ag,	Cu,	and	As	were	compiled	using	combined	data	 from	all	
lodes	comprising	the	Iron	Blow	deposit.	The	correlation	coefficient	provides	a	measure	of	the	linear	
relationship	 between	 two	 variables,	 and	 it	 is	 generally	 accepted	 that	 a	 value	 of	 0.6	 and	 above	
indicates	some	meaningful	correlation	between	two	variables.	The	correlation	coefficient	can	have	a	
maximum	value	of	1,	 in	which	 the	 scatterplot	 is	a	 straight	 line	with	a	positive	 slope.	Table	 17‐26	
below	summarizes	the	correlation	coefficient	values	for	each	element	comparison.

A	 moderate	 correlation	 exists	 between	 base	 metal	 elements	 (Pb,	 Zn	 and	 Ag),	 with	 correlation	
coefficient	values	ranging	from	0.61	to	0.82.	 	No	relationship	exists	between	Au	and	other	elements,

Variography	
	
Variography	 analysis	 was	 attempted	 on	 combined	 composite	 data	 from	 all	 lodes;	 however	 the	
resultant	variograms	were	of	insufficient	quality	for	consideration	in	the	resource	model,	due	to	low	
data	levels.	
	
Block	Model	and	Grade	Interpolation	
	
A	 3D	 block	 model,	 ironblow_august2009.mdl	 was	 generated	 using	 Surpac	 software	 with	 origin,	
extents	and	attributes	defined	below	 in	Table.3.	Parent	Blocks	of	25m	 x	5m	 x	10m	 (along	 strike	 x	
across	 strike	 x	RL)	were	 subdivided	 into	 sub-blocks	of	6.25m	 x	1.25m	 x	2.5m	 in	order	 to	 fill	areas	
adjacent	 to	wireframe	boundaries.	The	solid	wireframes	were	used	to	 limit	the	blocks	available	 for	
grade	 interpolation,	 with	 block	 centroid	 locations	 used	 to	 define	 the	 blocks	 and	 sub‐blocks	 for	
interpolation.	
	

 
TABLE	17‐27	IRON	BLOW	DEPOSIT	BLOCK	MODEL	PARAMETERS 

Inverse	distance	squared	interpolation	was	used	to	estimate	element	grades	for	the	Iron	Blow	Project.	
The	interpolation	method	was	considered	to	be	appropriate	given	the	limited	number	of	holes	in	the	
resource	and	ability	to	raise	reliable	variograms	for	use	in	interpretation.	Each	lode	wireframe	was	
treated	as	a	 separate	hard	boundary,	 restricting	 the	grade	 interpolation	 to	drillhole	data	 located	
within	each	wireframe.

All	lodes	utilized	a	strike	of	010°,	and	a	dip	of	70°	towards	100°,	apart	from	lode	400	with	a	65°	dip,	
and	lodes	500	&	600	with	a	75°	dip.	No	plunge	was	used	for	the	search	ellipse	orientation.	
	
Two	interpolation	passes	were	conducted	for	all	lodes,	with	a	search	ellipse	of	60m	x	60m	x	12m	used	
in	 the	 initial	pass	of	 interpolation.	For	 the	 second	 interpolation	pass,	 search	ellipses	were	doubled,	
with	only	those	blocks	unfilled	by	the	first	pass	interpolated	by	the	second	pass,	and	grades	estimated	
from	 the	 first	 interpolation	pass	were	 left	unchanged.	A	 small	amount	of	blocks	were	 left	unfilled	
after	both	interpolation	passes,	and	it	was	deemed	appropriate	to	leave	these	blocks	unfilled.	
	
Model	Validation	
	
The	Iron	Blow	block	model	was	validated	by	several	methods,	including	the	following:	

•	on	screen	visual	validation	via	vertical	sections	and	plan	views,	showing	block	grades	
against	input	composites;	
	
•	global	statistical	comparisons	of	average	input	composites	and	tonnage‐weighted	block	grades;	

	 and	
	

•	local	grade/northing	relationship	plots.	
	

A	global	grade	validation	was	conducted	by	comparing	input	average	top‐cut	composite	grades	with	
mean	block	grades	by	lode,	with	results	tabulated	in	Table	17‐28.

TABLE	17‐28	IRON	BLOW	DEPOSIT	GLOBAL	VALIDATION	BY	ELEMENT	

Mean	block	grades	are	within	10%	of	average	cut	composite	grades,	indicating	a	reasonable	global	
reconciliation.	 Considering	 that	 most	 lodes	 have	 very	 few	 drill	 intercepts	 (sometimes	 only	 one	
intercept	as	in	lodes	500	&	600),	and	the	large	extrapolations	involved	during	interpolation	of	grades,	
this	reconciliation	indicates	a	representative	global	model	at	the	current	data	density.	
	
Model	 and	 composite	 grade/depth	 relationships	were	 compiled	 for	 all	 lodes	within	 the	 Iron	Blow	
deposi.	Both	 input	average	composite	data	and	mean	model	grade	data	were	averaged	within	20m	
horizontal	slices	for	each	element,	and	plotted	together	with	the	number	of	composites	to	assess	the	
reliability	of	 the	block	model.	Comparisons	of	model	grades	with	composite	grades	with	 respect	 to	
depth	for	all	lodes	illustrate	a	smoothed	representation	of	composite	grades	by	the	model.	The	sparse	
data	density	and	large	extrapolation	of	wireframes	below	drill	intercepts	has	resulted	in	composites	
at	 the	 lowest	depths	of	 the	resource	 influencing	 large	numbers	of	model	blocks	and	 thus	smoothed	
average	model	grades.	The	 results	 from	 the	 validation	 show	 that	 the	 resource	model	honours	 the	
underlying	composite	data	with	no	obvious	bias	at	a	global	scale.	
	
Resource	Classification	
	
Resource	blocks	within	the	Iron	Blow	deposit	have	been	classified	as	Inferred	on	the	basis	of	various	
criteria	 including	 drillhole	 spacing,	 sample	 locations,	 sampling	 density,	 wireframe	 geometry,	
geological	 confidence	 and	 grade	 continuity.	 The	 absence	 of	 variography	 analysis	 has	 precluded	 a	
potential	Indicated	classification	for	part	of	the	deposit,	as	well	as	the	lack	of	QAQC	documentation	
for	grade	 control	 samples.	The	 Iron	Blow	deposit	 is	defined	by	broadly	 spaced	drilling,	with	most	
lodes	 containing	 only	 one	 or	 two	 drill	 intercepts,	 and	 thus	 an	 Inferred	 classification	was	 deemed	
appropriate	for	this	deposit.

17.7 MOTTRAMS	DEPOSIT	

General	
	
A	geostatistical	resource	estimate	was	completed	by	Geostat	on	the	Mottrams	Project	in	November	
2010.	 The	 aim	 of	 this	 work	 was	 to	 update	 the	 geostatistical	 kriged	 resource	 of	 the	 Mottrams	
deposit,	 incorporating	 the	 latest	 available	 drilling	 assays	 and	 a	 greater	 understanding	 of	 the	
deposit	geology.	
	
Data	was	supplied	to	Geostat	by	Crocodile	Gold	geological	personnel	in	the	form	of	a	drillhole	
database,	and	a	3D	geological	model	of	the	wireframed	lodes.	
	
The	work	undertaken	included	the	following:	
•	Upload	and	validation	of	new	drillhole	data;	
•	Compositing	of	Au	assay	intervals	and	data	declustering;	
•	Statistical	analysis	of	Au	composites,	including	top‐cut	determinations;	
•	Geostatistical	(variography)	analysis;	
•	Kriging	neighbourhood	analysis;	
•	Interpolation	by	ordinary	kriging	of	Au	composites;	
•	Validation	of	the	resultant	block	model	
	
Surpac	mining	software	was	used	for	constructing	the	3D	block	model	and	subsequent	grade	
estimates.

Variography	

Variography	analysis	using	lognormal	variograms	was	performed	on	cut	composite	data	for	the	
resource	model.	 	 In	 order	 to	 provide	 sufficient	 data	 for	 reliable	 variography	 analysis,	 the	 four	
lodes	were	combined	together	into	a	single	domain.		Since	all	four	lodes	are	similar	in	strike	and	
dip,	this	was	deemed	appropriate.	
	

Interpretation	of	the	fans	in	the	horizontal	plane	reveal	a	0°	strike,	with	a	vertical	across‐strike	
interpretation	revealing	a	dip	of	‐70°	towards	270°.		A	plunge	of	‐9°	towards	357°	was	detected	in	
the	dip	plane,	and	the	principal	axis	was	set	to	this	direction.			
	

Variograms	with	two	spherical	structures	were	modelled	in	each	principal	direction,	with	results	
tabulated	 in	 Table	 17‐30	 below.	 	 Modelling	was	 performed	 on	 lognormal	 variograms,	 and	 the	
resulting	parameters	back‐transformed	to	traditional	parameters.		The	quality	of	variograms	was	
fair	to	poor,	due	to	the	irregular	spatial	distribution	of	assay	composites	within	the	lodes,	and	low	
data	levels.

	Variography		
	
From	 the	 statistical	 analysis	 above,	 the	 global	 statistics	 (average,	 variance	 and	 standard	
deviations)	for	zones	100,	400	and	500	are	very	similar	with	lots	of	data	in	each	zone.	These	zones	
were	combined	into	one	overall	domain	for	the	purpose	of	variography	analysis.			Zones	200	and	
300	have	few	samples	to	obtain	meaningful	variograms	so	these	zones	were	also	included	into	the	
domain	above.		
	
An	omni‐directional	variogram	was	extracted	to	obtain	the	nugget	value	and	a	value	of	2.1752	was	
obtained	with	an	overall	sill	value	of	3.1333	giving	a	high	nugget	of	approximately	70%	of	the	total	
sill	value.	This	shows	high	variability	in	the	grade	values	in	the	zones.		
	
The	direction	that	was	chosen	for	the	variogram	analysis	was	along	a	strike	of	20	degrees	(major)	
and	 a	 dip	 of	 ‐65°	 towards	 290°.	 A	 spread	 of	 10°	 was	 used	 with	 a	 spread	 limit	 of	 15m	 to	
approximate	the	width	of	the	mineralized	zones.		
	
Variograms	were	of	poor	quality.	Figure	17‐40	and	Figure	17‐41	 illustrates	 the	omni‐directional	
variogram	and	the	major/semi‐major	&	minor	variograms	respectively.

17.9 	UNION	REEF	DEPOSITS	

General	
	
The	Union	Reefs	Gold	Mine	is	located	approximately	185km	SE	of	Darwin,	NT,	at	latitude	1342'S,	
longitude	 13147'E	 and	AMG	 coordinates	 801,700E,	 8,482,000N.	 The	 tenement	 (MLN1109)	 and	
contained	resources	are	100%	owned	and	operated	by	Crocodile	Gold.	Crocodile	Gold	maintains	
100%	ownership	of	the	Union	Reefs	deposit	(MLN1109).		

	
Regional	and	Project	Geology	
	
Gold‐bearing	 lodes	of	 the	Union	Reefs	District	 are	 confined	 to	 the	300m	wide	Pine	Creek	 Shear	
(Figure	 17‐48).	 Economic	mineralization	 is	 related	 to	 a	 tightly	 interbedded	 sequence	 of	weakly	
carbonaceous	shale	and	greywacke.	Two	'lines‐of‐lode'	exist	and	the	most	productive	structure	is	
known	as	the	Union	Line	with	a	subordinate	structure	to	the	east	(mine	grid)	known	as	the	Lady	
Alice	Line.	The	 lodes	are	 typical	of	 those	 characterized	as	 'shear‐related'	but	 they	do	host	 small	
saddle	reefs	as	well.

FIGURE	17‐48	REGIONAL	GEOLOGY	OF	THE	UNION	REEFS	DEPOSITS	

Geologists	have	carefully	modeled	26	lodes	in	the	mine	area.	These	weakly	sulfidic	lenses	range	in	
width	from	1‐75m	and	in	strike	length	from	30‐200m.	The	down‐dip	extension	of	the	best	lode,	E‐
Lens	is	undefined	but	is	in	excess	of	300m.	Most	other	lenses	have	a	plunge	component,	usually	to	
the	 north,	 of	 100‐150m.	 The	 lenses	 are	 composed	 of	 quartz,	 carbonate,	 chlorite,	 sericite	 and	
broken	or	brecciated	wall	rock.	Most	major	veins	are	bedding	parallel	but	several	linkage	vein	sets	
occur	 and	 some	 areas	 are	 characterized	by	 sheeted	 vein	 sets	 and	deformed	 stockwork	 veinlets.	
Boudins	are	common.	Post	mineral	faulting	has	not	had	a	negative	effect	on	ore	block	mineability	
although	the	deformation	history	is	complex.

The	best	pathfinder	mineral	for	gold	is	arsenopyrite	but	pyrite,	pyrrhotite,	sphalerite,	galena	and	
sparse	 copper	 minerals	 are	 also	 present.	 The	 principal	 styles	 of	 sulfide	 mineralization	 include	
quartz‐visible	gold	banded	veining	(rare),	low	sulfide	auriferous,	pyritic	veining	(common),	weakly	
banded,	auriferous,	arsenopyrite‐pyrite	veining	(common),	low‐grade,	disseminated,	arsenopyrite‐
bearing	 breccias	 or	 mylonitic	 shears	 (localized),	 and	 small,	 semi‐massive	 base	 metal	 pods	
composed	of	 sphalerite,	 galena	and	pyrite	 (erratic).	The	wider	quartz	 lode	 contacts	 are	 feather‐
edge	 but	many	 of	 the	 narrow	 structures	 show	 diffuse	 contacts.	 Visual	 control	 during	mining	 is	
subtle	 in	 the	 stringy	 zones	 and	 in	 the	 areas	 of	 ramifying	 veinlets.	 Conditional	 Simulation	
techniques	 are	 used	 to	 smooth	 the	 composited	 data	 and	 create	 a	 mineable	 ore	 block	 markout	
during	the	grade	control	process.	–	Makar,	W.	And	Chen	Chow,	K.	(2003)	

 
Mineralization	
 
Gold	 mineralization	 is	 believed	 to	 be	 hypothermal‐mesothermal	 and	 involved	 a	 multi‐staged	
(sedimentary	preparation,	metamorphic	upgrading	and	hydrothermal	mobilization	generated	by	
heat	of	 the	batholith),	 long	term	process	as	represented	by	a	number	of	quartz	vein	generations	
(Klominsky,	et	al.,	1996).	

Gold	mineralization	 is	associated	with	quartz‐sulphide	veining.	The	 location	and	style	of	veining	
throughout	 the	 deposit	 is	 a	 complex	 interplay	 of	 structural	 and	 lithological	 controls.	 Three	 end	
member	vein	styles	are	recognized.	These	are:		

1. Lode	style	veins,	which	are	up	to	4	m	thick,	commonly	discontinuous,	pod‐like	and	hosted	
within	highly	sheared,	dominantly	shale	wall	rocks.	Lode	style	mineralization	displays	the	
largest	 amount	 of	 grade	 variability	 at	 Union	 Reefs	 and	 includes	 localized	 zones	 of	 high	
grade	gold.	The	majority	of	the	old	workings	at	Union	Reefs	are	located	on	these	systems.	

2. Stockwork	 vein	 systems,	 which	 are	 complex	 and	 largely	 restricted	 to	 greywacke	
dominated	horizons.	Stockwork	veining	is	typically	of	moderate	gold	grade;	and		

3. Sheeted‐vein	 systems,	 which	 are	 characterized	 by	 sub‐parallel	 vein	 sets	 that	 typically	
occur	in	thinly	interbedded	sequences	of	shale	and	greywacke.	Sheeted	veining	is	typically	
of	lower	grade.	

The	Crosscourse	zone,	which	hosts	the	majority	of	 the	gold	 in	the	Union	Reefs	mineralization,	 is	
dominated	by	 the	 stockwork	vein	 style	with	 lode‐style	 veins	 concentrated	 in	 the	Ping	Ques	 and	
Western	Lens	systems.	

Coarse	 gold	 is	 a	 characteristic	 feature	of	 the	mineralization	 at	Union	Reefs	 and	occurs	 as	 single	
grains	and	clusters	up	to	5	mm	across.	
	
Drilling	Methods	
	
Previous	Drilling	

Historically,	 drilling	 activities	 in	 the	 vicinity	 of	 Union	 Reefs	 dates	 as	 far	 back	 as	 1905,	 where	
diamond	 holes	 were	 first	 collared	 at	 Crosscourse	 and	 Millars.	 From	 1995	 to	 1998	Mine	 Based	
Exploration	activities	at	Union	Reefs	focused	on	ongoing	resource	definition	drilling	along	the	Pine	
Creek	Shear	zone,	greatly	improving	the	knowledge	and	geometry	of	ore‐bodies.	

A	 number	 of	 different	 drilling	 techniques	 have	 been	 employed	 to	 sample	 this	 deposit	 which	
include:

Union	Reefs	extends	over	a	strike	length	of	4.75km	and	is	defined	as	the	area	between	4550N	to	
9320N	and	4500E	to	5400E	(Mine	Grid).	Almost	all	of	 the	known	resource	areas	have	been	drill	
tested	down	to	an	approximate	20m	x	20m	grid.		

Geologists	logged	each	hole	paying	particular	attention	to	degrees	of	weathering,	lithological	and	
structural	 contacts,	 zones	 of	 alteration,	 mineralization	 and	 geotechnical	 information	 for	 pit	
stability	purposes.	

Prior	to	1996,	all	geological	and	geotechnical	 information	derived	from	drilling	was	entered	into	
spreadsheets	(paper	or	computer	form)	and	later	converted	into	digital	format.	Between	1996	and	
1997	data	were	 collected	by	mine	 based	 geologist	 using	HP200LX	Palmtops	with	 Field	Marshal	
software.		

Gold	 and	base	metal	 assays	were	 received	digitally,	 and	 results	merged	 into	 the	database	using	
Datashed	software.	In	1998,	new	hardware	and	software	was	implemented,	replacing	the	obsolete	
Palmtops	with	Pentium	Laptops	and	Field	Marshal	with	Drillpad	down‐hole	logging	software.	

	
Location	and	Survey	Control	

All	RC	and	Diamond	collar	coordinates	from	1991	to	September	2003	were	surveyed	using	EDM	
survey	equipment	with	known	local	grid	points.	Once	drill	holes	had	been	completed,	 they	were	
re‐surveyed	 to	 record	 accurate	 collar	 positions.	 Mine	 Surveyors,	 Microsurvey	 Ltd	 and	 GHD	
Surveys	 Pty	 Ltd	 provided	 much	 of	 the	 service.	 Survey	 techniques	 adopted	 prior	 to	 1991	 are	
unknown.	
	
Down‐Hole	Survey	

Down	 hole	 surveys	 were	 routinely	 conducted	 on	 all	 drill	 holes	 between	 1991	 to	 2003	 using	
Eastman	single	shot	cameras.	The	first	survey	was	taken	approximately	5m	below	the	collar,	then	
at	50m	intervals,	with	a	final	survey	taken	at	the	end	of	the	hole.	
	
Sampling	

Reverse	Circulation	Sampling	–	Post	1995	to	Pre	2001	

Sampling	 was	 carried	 out	 by	 the	 collection	 of	 drill	 cuttings	 at	 one	 meter	 (4m	 composites	 for	
sterilization	 programs)	 intervals,	 via	 a	 riffle	 splitter	 attached	 to	 a	 cyclone	 fixed	 to	 the	 drill	 rig.	
These	 were	 two	 tier	 riffle	 splitters	 containing	 12	 riffle	 compartments	 of	 40mm	 width,	 and	
producing	samples	typically	85%	finer	than	2mm.	All	RC	drilling	programs	vigorously	adhered	to	
the	following	sampling	procedures:	

Sample	bags	were	pre‐labeled,	indicating	designated	sample	number	and	related	depth.	

A	large	bag	was	hooked	up	to	the	75%	side	of	the	splitter,	and	a	smaller	pre‐numbered	bag	fixed	to	
the	25%	outlet	by	the	drillers	offsider.

[274]	
	

The	25%	split	always	provided	a	6‐8kg	split.	Excess	sample	was	re‐split	by	a	50:50	splitter.	The	
75%	split	(large	bag)	was	placed	in	numerical	order	near	the	vicinity	of	the	drill	hole.	

As	soon	as	the	bags	were	removed	from	the	splitter,	new	bags	were	attached.		

Wet	samples	were	speared	from	the	larger	bag	to	produce	a	4‐6kg	sample.	

Geologist	 and	 Field	 Assistants	 observed	 and	 checked	 sample	 quality	 and	 inspected	 samples	 for	
dampness.	Standards	and	blanks	were	inserted	as	required.	

Field	Assistants	sieved	and	placed	a	small	 representative	sample	of	each	meter	 in	chip	 trays	 for	
logging	by	geologists.	

Sample	 return	 hoses	 were	 kept	 clear	 of	 blockages.	 When	 blockages	 occurred	 the	 bags	 were	
removed	from	the	cyclone	until	full	circulation	was	restored.	

Reverse	Circulation	Grade	Control	Sampling	–	Post	2000	

Sampling	 was	 carried	 out	 by	 the	 collection	 of	 drill	 cuttings	 at	 one	 meter	 intervals,	 via	 a	 riffle	
splitter	attached	to	a	cyclone	fixed	to	the	drill	rig.	These	were	two	tier	riffle	splitters	containing	12	
riffle	compartments	of	40mm	width,	and	producing	samples	typically	85%	finer	than	2mm.	The	RC	
grade	control	drilling	program	adhered	to	the	following	sampling	procedures:	

Sample	bags	were	pre‐labeled,	indicating	designated	sample	number	and	related	depth.	

A	small	pre‐numbered	bag	was	fixed	by	the	drillers	offsider	to	the	25%	outlet	providing	a	3‐5kg	
split.		

As	soon	as	the	bags	were	removed	from	the	splitter,	new	bags	were	attached.		

Geologist	 and	 Pit	 Technicians	 observed	 and	 checked	 sample	 quality	 and	 inspected	 samples	 for	
dampness.	Standards	and	blanks	were	inserted	as	required.	

Sample	 return	 hoses	 were	 kept	 clear	 of	 blockages.	 When	 blockages	 occurred	 the	 bags	 were	
removed	from	the	cyclone	until	full	circulation	was	restored.	

Diamond	Sampling	–	Post	1996		

Predominantly	 HQ3	 core	 was	 drilled	 at	 Union	 Reefs	 between	 1996	 to	 1998.	 There	 were	 no	
diamond	holes	 drilled	 from	1999	 to	 present.	 Individual	 core	 drilling	 "runs"	were	 every	 1.5m	 in	
oxide	 &/or	 broken	 ground	 and	 3m	 in	 competent	 fresh	 ground.	 Core	 orientation	 marks	 were	
carried	out	every	6	to	9m	where	possible.	Prior	to	any	core	leaving	the	drilling	site,	the	following	
procedures	were	adopted:	

Depth	 markers	 were	 placed	 in	 trays,	 with	 trays	 clearly	 marked	 with	 hole	 ID,	 start	 and	 finish	
depths.	 Core	 loss	 zones	 were	 clearly	 marked.	 If	 applicable,	 core	 orientation	 marks	 were	
highlighted.	

Core	length	was	measured	and	validated	with	the	driller's	depth.	

Drill	 core	was	 then	 collected	and	 taken	 to	 the	 core	yard	 for	 further	 investigation.	The	 core	was	
orientated	 and	 logged	 for	 geology	 /	 geotechnical	 information	 by	 a	 geologist.	 All	 decisions	
pertaining	to	marking	the	core	for	sampling	lay	with	the	geologist.	Continuous	one‐meter	intervals	
had	been	 sampled	 in	 the	majority	of	 cases,	 though	 in	1998	 the	more	extensive	non‐mineralized	
intervals	were	ignored.	Core	was	then	split	in	half	using	a	diamond	saw	with	one‐half	placed	into	
pre‐labeled	sample	bags	for	analysis	and	the	remainder	kept	in	storage.

During	mine	closure	the	previous	owners	gained	permission	from	the	Department	of	Resources	to	
dispose	of	the	diamond	core,	no	core	now	remains	on	site.		

Analysis	

Prior	to	1996,	samples	produced	by	Acacia	and	Shell	Billiton	were	submitted	for	analysis	to	Amdel	
(Darwin)	 and	 Assaycorp	 (Pine	 Creek	 now	 NAL)	 laboratories.	 This	 involved	 supplying	 the	
laboratories	8‐10kg	samples,	which	in	turn	were	split,	crushed,	pulverized	and	assayed	using	the	
50g	fire	assay	charge	method.	All	samples	greater	than	0.20g/t	Au	were	analyzed	for	As,	Ag,	Cu,	Pb	
and	Zn	by	I.C.P.	

From	1996	 to	2001,	Amdel	 (Darwin)	conducted	all	 routine	assaying.	The	methodology	was	pre‐
determined	 by	 Amdel's	 standard	 policy	 in	 association	 with	 Union	 Reefs	 personnel.	 Samples	
weighing	 4‐6kg	were	 dispatched	 to	 Amdel	where	 they	were	 sorted	 against	 AngloGold's	 sample	
dispatch	 form.	 Amdel	 immediately	 reported	 any	 irregularities	 to	 AngloGold	 prior	 to	 analysis.	
Samples	were	dried	at	100C	for	6	to	8	hours	and	reduced	using	a	Mixermill	4000	or	LM5	until	95%	
passes	75	microns.	Minimum	pulverizing	time	is	3	minutes.	Samples	known	to	contain	coarse	gold	
particles	were	 isolated	 from	a	one‐kilogram	split	of	 the	 finely	pulverized	sample,	and	separately	
assayed.	From	the	pulverized	product	a	sub‐sample	approximately	300g	was	placed	into	geochem	
packets	 with	 the	 identical	 sample	 number	 displayed.	 The	 laboratory	 then	 analyzed	 the	 sample	
using	 50g	 fire	 assay	 analysis	 (The	 Analytical	 Control	 Scheme	 for	 Amdel	 is	 illustrated	 in	 UNION	
REEFS	2001	Resource	Statement	(Makar	et	al	2001).		

Post	 2001,	 ALS	 (Alice	 Springs)	 and	 NAL	 (Pine	 Creek)	 conducted	 all	 routine	 assaying.	 The	
methodology	used	by	ALS	was	the	same	as	Amdel's	(1996	–	2001)	methodology	mentioned	above.	
NAL	methodology	was	pre‐determined	by	NAL's	standard	policy	in	association	with	Union	Reefs	
personnel.	 Samples	weighing	 4‐6kg	were	 dispatched	 to	 Amdel	where	 they	were	 sorted	 against	
AngloGold's	 sample	 dispatch	 form.	 NAL	 immediately	 reported	 any	 irregularities	 to	 AngloGold	
prior	 to	 analysis.	 Samples	were	 crushed	with	 the	 use	 of	 a	 Rolls	 Crusher	 and	 split	 down	 to	 1kg	
which	was	pulverized	with	the	use	of	a	Keegor	Mill	until	90%	passes	100	microns.	The	pulverized	
product	was	mat	rolled	and	a	sub	sample	of	approximately	500g	was	placed	into	geochem	packets	
with	the	identical	sample	number	displayed.	The	laboratory	then	analyzed	the	sample	using	50g	
fire	assay	analysis,	the	relevant	flow	sheet	can	be	seen	above.	

Quality	 control	 procedures	 were	 in	 place	 throughout	 all	 aspects	 of	 analysis.	 The	 laboratory	
performed	the	following	steps	to	maintain	this:	

Replicate	 samples	 were	 analyzed	 to	 give	 an	 indication	 of	 homogeneity	 within	 the	 pulp	 and	 to	
determine	precision.		

Amdel,	 ALS,	 NAL	 and	 AngloGold	 blanks	 /	 standards	 were	 inserted	 into	 each	 batch	 of	 40–50	
samples.	These	provided	a	measure	of	contamination	and	accuracy.	

All	checks	reported	on	a	monthly	basis.	

Pulp	Re‐Analysis	

To	test	for	repeatability/homogeneity,	pulps	were	re‐fired	by	NAL,	with	results	reported	to	UNION	
REEFS	Geology.	UNION	REEFS	Geology	staff	also	selected	pulps	that	outlined	major	mineralization	
zones,	defined	for	each	month.	These	pulps	were	sent	to	Australian	Laboratory	Services	in	Perth,	
and	Amdel	Laboratories	Limited	in	South	Australia,	to	be	re‐	assayed,	compared	to	NAL,	to	test	for	
repeatability	 and	 homogeneity	 (i.e.	 Check	 assays).	 All	 pulps	 were	 wet	 screen	 tested	 to	 check	
quality	 of	 sample	 preparation	 and	 standard	 results	 tabulated.	 These	 results	 are	 reported	 in	
monthly	QA	QC	Reports

Specific	Gravity/Bulk	Density	Data	

In	situ	bulk	density	(SG)	determinations	were	estimated	using	the	water	displacement	method	on	
drill	core.	SG	data	derived	from	Fresh	and	Transitional	material	had	been	considered	reliable,	as	
rock	 competency	 and	 core	 recovery	 improved	with	depth,	 reducing	 the	 variability	 of	 results.	 In	
oxide	 zones,	 the	 same	 technique	 of	 water	 displacement	 was	 used,	 on	 hand	 picked	 sticks	 of	
competent	 core.	 This	 may	 have	 imposed	 a	 bias	 towards	 overestimation.	 Specific	 gravity	
measurements	 estimated	 using	 the	 water	 displacement	 method	 were	 calculated	 from	 the	
following	formula:	

SG		=		 WAD			.			
	 					WAS	‐	WWS	

	 Where		WAD		 =	Weight	of	dry	sample	in	air	

	 	 	 WAS		 =	Weight	of	saturated	sample	in	air	

	 	 	 WWS		 =	Weight	of	saturated	sample	immersed	in	water	

	
Method	

Determining	 WAD:	 For	 each	 meter	 of	 core	 requiring	 measurement,	 a	 0.2m	 piece	 of	 core	 was	
removed	from	the	tray	(prior	to	core	being	cut).	Core	affected	by	grease	or	drilling	fluid	was	not	
chosen.	Each	piece	of	core	was	placed	on	the	scales	and	its	weight	recorded.		

Determining	WAS:	The	sample	was	re‐weighed	in	air	allowing	minimal	drying.	

Determining	WWS:	A	container	of	water	with	sufficient	volume	to	immerse	a	0.2m	length	of	core	
was	placed	on	the	scales.	The	pieces	of	core	(in	a	wire	basket)	were	lowered	into	the	water	and	
when	the	weight	steadies	(after	the	sample	has	become	saturated)	the	weight	was	recorded.	

All	measurements	were	recorded	and	SG's	calculated	using	the	above	formula.		

	
Geological	Interpretation	

A	cross‐section	and	flitch‐plan	interpretation	of	all	the	Union	Reef	deposits	(Lady	Alice,	Union	
North,	Union	South,	Millars/Big	Tree,	Prospect	and	Esmeralda)	was	carried	out	employing	the	
following	steps:	

 The	 geological	 interpretation	 for	 the	 deposit	 was	 reviewed	 to	 determine	 continuity	
between	sections	and	down	dip.	

 In	 cross‐section,	 the	 interpreted	 ore	 outlines	 at	 nominal	 cut‐off	 grades	 (e.g..	 0.5g/t	 Au)	
were	wireframed	(Figure	17‐49).	

 The	 drillhole	 intersections	 contained	 within	 the	 cross‐section	 wireframe	 (both	
unexpanded	 and	 expanded)	 were	 exported	 to	 a	 separate	 subset	 drillhole	 file.	 For	
interpolation,	a	0.6m	dilution	skin	was	added	by	expanding	the	wireframe.	

 The	 drillhole	 data	 within	 the	 unexpanded	 cross‐section	 wireframe	 was	 converted	 to	 a	
series	of	nominal	horizontal	"assay"	bars	at	some	regular	interval	(e.g..	2.5m)	and	saved	as	
a	drillhole	file.

Model	validation	
	

Model	validation	was	performed	by	using	historical	mining	and	reconciling	the	inpit	mined	tonnes	
and	grade.	

Overall,	 ore	mined	 produced	 120%	 of	 the	 tonnes	 at	 78	%	 of	 the	 grade	 to	 produce	 94%	 of	 the	
ounces	compared	to	the	resource	model.	

In	 all	 pits,	 positive	 tonnage	 reconciliation	 was	 recorded	 in	 conjunction	 with	 negative	 grade	
reconciliations	against	the	reserve.		This	is	mostly	due	to	extra	"visual"	ore	being	mined	supervised	
by	geologists	and	pit	technicians.	The	majority	of	extra	ore	mined	was	grab	sampled	and	assayed	
and	 returned	grades	well	within	 the	0.6g/t	 cut‐off.	 	 In	 short,	 "ore"	which	was	not	delineated	by	
grade	control	was	mined	near	the	marginal	grade,	thus	reducing	the	"As	mined"	predicted	grade	
and	increasing	tonnes.	Results	showing	positive	call	factors	recorded	in	the	same	period	illustrate	
the	potential	for	ore/grade	misallocation	by	grade	control	(Figure	17‐50).		

As	 mentioned	 previously,	 throughout	 2003	 reconciliations	 figures	 have	 been	 offset	 by	 positive	
mine	 to	 mill	 call	 factors	 (Figure	 17‐50).	 January	 2003	 to	 July	 2003,	 mine	 to	 mill	 call	 factors	
averaged	119%,	whilst	ounce	reconciliations	have	averaged	95%.	This	 factor	 illustrates	 that	 the	
ounces	lost	between	Resources	and	Grade	control	are	made	up	in	ounces	recovered	from	the	mill.

FIGURE	17‐50	UNION	REEFS	RECONCILIATION	OF	MINED	VALUES	AGAINST	MILL	RECOVERY	

Classification	
 
The	 differentiation	 between	 Inferred,	 Indicated	 and	 Measured	 status	 was	 based	 upon	 the	
demonstrated	continuity	of	mineralization	both	between	drilled	sections	and	down	dip	projection.	
Utilizing	 interpretation	 parameters	 of	 2m	minimum	widths	 and	 2m	maximum	 internal	 dilution,	
the	subdivision	between	categories	was	broadly	as	follows:	

 Indicated	 ‐	 demonstrated	 continuity	 over	 several	 adjacent	 sections	 plus	 down	 dip	
continuity	over	several	holes.	This	is	typically	determined	over	a	grid	spacing	of	20	x	40	to	
40	x	40	(hole	spacing	x	line	spacing).	

 Inferred	–	where	mineralization	is	demonstrated	over	only	adjacent	sections	or	holes	and	
where	grid	spacing	is	greater	than	40	x	40.	Typically	requires	significant	additional	drilling	
to	demonstrate	continuity	

	The	confidence	in	continuity	was	determined	during	the	interpretation	stage	with	the	appropriate	
status	assigned	to	 the	 individual	ore	pods.	This	status	was	carried	through	 into	 the	block	model	
and	was	used	to	determine	Proved	and	Probable	Reserve	characterization.	–	Makar,	W.	And	Chen

A	number	of	 resource	statements	have	been	generated	 in	 the	past	 for	 the	Tom's	Gully	deposit.	
These	are	summarized	in	the	Odessa	2009	report	and	will	not	be	repeated	here.	
	
In	May	2009	a	Tom's	Gully	classified	Mineral	Resource	was	reported	above	a	cut‐off	of	3.65	g/t	
Au.	This	cut‐off	is	the	equivalent	of	5	grams‐meter	(grams	Au	x	meter).		
	
The	 following	 reports	 provide	 detailed	 accounts	 of	 the	 2009	 resource	 and	 reserve	 statements	
both	of	which	are	NI43‐101	compliant.	The	reader	is	referred	to	these	reports	for	any	details	with

Hitchins	 subsequently	 issued	 a	 new	 resource	 estimate	 in	 January	 2011	 in	 an	 unpublished	
Crocodile	Gold	report.		The	following	is	a	detailed	summation	of	his	resource	estimate.	
	

BLOCK	MODEL	

Resource	 estimates	 for	 narrow	 veins	 like	 Tom's	 Gully	 are	 often	 completed	 using	 the	 polygonal	
method.	 	This	method	has	a	 long	venerable	history,	but	there	 is	potential	to	overestimate	resources	
using	this	method	as	the	composited	grade	representing	a	polygon	may	not	be	representative	of	that	
polygon	being	either	too	high	or	too	low.		If	the	grade	for	that	polygon	is	too	high	then	the	polygon's	
influence	on	the	overall	resource	estimate	will	not	be	representative	.	

The	polygonal	method	is	also	very	labor	intensive	and	does	not	allow	for	much	in	the	way	of	changing	
parameters	and	evaluating	results.		The	Tom's	Gully	resource	has	been	estimated	using	a	block	model	
with	very	thin	domains.	 	The	vein	and	structure	 is	sufficiently	thick	to	allow	 for	a	moderately	sized	
block	model	that	can	be	manipulated	with	current	hardware	and	software.				

Surpac	software	was	employed	in	the	generation	of	the	resource.	

Chip	sampling	of	underground	 faces	 is	necessarily	 incorporated	 in	this	resource	and	 is	 interpolated	
along	with	the	diamond	drilling	results.			

The	vein	is	constrained	by	a	closed	and	validated	wireframe	of	the	Tom's	Gully	vein.		The	wireframe	
has	been	constructed	using	all	available	drill	hole	 intersections	and	chip	sample	results.	 	There	are	
cases	where	older	drill	holes	do	not	 corroborate	 the	 chip	 results	–	 these	have	been	 ignored	 in	 the	
construction	of	the	wireframe,	though	their	composites	are	extracted	within	the	wireframe	and	used	
in	the	resource	estimate.		The	location	of	the	chip	samples	have	been	surveyed	and	are	taken	as	being	
correct.	Chip	samples	therefore	take	precedence	to	surface	drilling,	which	may	not	be	as	accurately	
located.	

The	block	model	 is	 interpolated	by	 the	 inverse	distance	squared	 (ID2)	method	of	 interpolation.	 	An	
estimation	employing	ID2	can	adequately	limit	the	excessive	influence	of	unrepresentative	high	grade	
composites	by	forcing	the	grades	of	blocks	to	decrease	in	value	with	distance	from	the	intersection.		A	
single	pass	ID2	interpolation	was	used	at	Tom's	Gully.	Background	grade	of	the	vein	is	essentially	zero	
and	only	areas	of	higher	grade	and	drill	density	are	used	in	the	resource	estimate.	

Selected	areas	containing	greater	than	3.65	g/t	Au	at	1.0m	or	thicker	have	been	extracted	from	the	
block	model	as	 resources.	 	Areas	with	good	gold	grades,	but	 containing	narrow	widths	have	been	
excluded	 since	 they	are	unlikely	 to	be	mined.	 	These	areas	have	been	extracted	by	outlines	of	high	
accumulation	 (grade	 x	width).	 	Mineralization	 is	 categorized	as	 Indicated	and	 Inferred	Resources	
only	 (Table	 17‐43	 and	 Figure	 17‐51).	 	Mined	 areas	 have	 been	 extracted	 from	 the	 resource	 and	
tabulated	separately.

Capping	–	20	g/t	Au	for	both	muck	and	drill	core	samples	‐	performed	priory	to	compositing	

Lower	Cut‐off	grade	–	3.65	g/t	Au	

Compositing	 ‐	Composites	were	extracted	using	0.25m	length.	 	Composites	are	taken	within	the	
vein	 	 	wireframe	only.	 	Composites	start	at	 the	hangingwall	contact	and	proceed	to	 the	 footwall.		
Therefore,	the	last	composite	in	each	intersection	will	be	less	than	0.25	m	

Block	Size	‐	The	vein	at	Tom's	Gully	is	narrow	and	is	often	less	than	1.0	meter	in	thickness.		Chip	
and	 diamond	 drilling	 samples	 are	 widely	 variable	 in	 width	 and	 are	 often	 0.2	 to	 0.6	 meters	 in	
thickness.		A	vertical	(Z)	block	size	of	0.25m	has	been	chosen.		A	block	size		of	5	x	5	x	0.5	meters	
has	been	selected.			

Variography	 ‐	 variography	 does	 not	work	well	 on	 sinuous	 planar	 veins.	 	 Therefore	 any	 search	
ellipse	must	 be	 spherical	 in	 order	 to	 select	 all	 relevant	 sample	 composites.	 The	 vein	 system	 is

using	circular	searches	appear	adequate	in	providing	an	unbiased	picture	of	the	ore	shoots.				

Search	Parameters	 ‐	The	Tom's	Gully	vein	has	been	divided	 into	 two	domains	 labeled	 "Upper"	
and	 "Lower"	 (Table	 17‐44).	 	 These	 domains	 account	 for	 the	 curvature	 in	 the	 vein	 that	 occurs	
between	 4350N	 and	 4670N.	 	 Each	 domain	 employs	 a	 separate	 search	 ellipse.	 	 Different	 search	
distances	are	used	in	each	domain	due	to	marked	differences	in	drilling	and	chip	sample	densities.		
The	upper	domain	contains	a	denser	drill	pattern	while	 the	 lower	domain	 is	somewhat	sparsely	
drilled.

Interpolation	‐	Blocks	have	been	filled	using	the	inverse	distance	squared	method	which	has	the	
effect	 of	 limiting	 the	 area	 of	 influence	 of	 higher	 grades.	 	 Grades	 fall	 progressively	 away	 from	 a	
composite	 that	 avoids	 the	 smearing	 effect	 of	 kriging.	 	 A	 minimum	 of	 2	 samples	 is	 used	 to	
adequately	 fill	 Inferred	blocks	 in	 the	 southern	extent	of	 the	deposit	 a	 function	of	widely	 spaced	
drilling.		A	maximum	of	15	samples	is	used	for	the	interpolation	of	each	block.	

Data	have	been	declustered	using	the	discretization	option	in	Surpac	because	of	the	high	density	of	
chip	sampling	in	the	mined	areas.		This	has	been	checked	against	a	model	without	discretization	–	
the	differences	are	not	significant.	

Model	Validation	 ‐	The	block	model	was	validated	visually	 along	with	 intersections	with	grade	
intervals	shown	by	color.			
	
Diamond	Drilling	‐	There	have	been	multiple	phases	of	diamond	drilling	by	different	companies	
over	the	history	of	the	property.		A	few,	presumably	older	holes,	are	missing	geology	data	entirely.		
In	such	cases	the	vein	must	be	flagged	using	assays	only,	which	are	then	used	to	construct	the	vein	
wireframe.	 Many	 of	 these	 holes	 are	 likely	 reverse	 circulation,	 but	 the	 logs	 are	 unavailable.	 A	
number	of	holes	contain	only	very	limited	information	with	respect	to	the	vein.		The	geology	logs	
for	these	holes	appear	to	have	been	lost	over	time.		

Crocodile	Gold	completed	33	surface	holes	in	2009	and	2010,	which	were	logged	and	sampled	to	
appropriate	QA/QC	requirements.		These	holes	were	designed	to	fill	in	gaps	in	information	to	the	
south.	 	 	Many	of	 these	holes	 intersected	high	 grade	material.	 	Mining	of	 two	areas	 (Foxtrot	 and	
Delta	areas	in	mine	plan)	did	not	substantiate	the	grades	defined	by	drilling	though.		It	seems	the	
drilling	preferentially	intersected	stronger	mineralization	with	limited	influences.		

Intersections	 used	 in	 the	 resource	 estimation	 consisted	 of	 the	 structure	 including,	 quartz	 vein,	
quartz	 carbonate	 vein,	 quartz	 stringers,	 stockworks	 that	 are	 part	 of	 the	 vein	 system,	 and	 faults.		
During	mining	it	was	not	possible	to	selectively	mine	mineralized	quartz	since	it	was	quite	often	
intercalated	 with	 barren	 carbonate	 and	 faults.	 	 Faults	 containing	 breccias	 and	 gouge	 usually	
occurred	 in	 the	 hangingwall	 of	 the	 vein	 and	 within	 the	 vein,	 causing	 sudden	 changes	 in	 the	
elevation	 of	 the	 vein.	 	 Carbonates	 were	 usually	 found	 to	 be	 barren,	 while	 faults	 were	 highly

[286]	
	

variable	in	grade.		The	mineralized	vein	occurs	within	a	broad	vein‐fault	structure.		The	faults	are	
not	competent	ground	and	cannot	be	avoided	when	extracting	the	ore	either	during	split	shooting	
or	during	full	face	drifting.		The	fault	will	fall	in	with	the	ore	if	it	occurs	in	the	hangingwall.	

During	 face	sampling,	 it	was	not	uncommon	to	 find	higher	grade	gold	values	 in	 the	hangingwall	
and	 footwall	host	shales	which	were	usually	devoid	of	veining.	 	This	was	also	observed	 in	some	
drill	 intersections	such	as	holes	TGDDH014	or	TGDDH015	where	 the	wallrock	 in	 the	 immediate	
hangingwall	grades	21.69	g/t	Au	while	the	structure	grades	4.72	g/t	over	1.6	m.	The	most	extreme	
case	of	this	occurs	inTGDDH008	where	the	actual	structure	grades	0.06	g/t	Au	over	0.53	m	but	the	
hangingwall	carries	7.69	g/t	Au	over	11.64	m.		A	number	of	assays	in	the	hangingwall	range	from	
10‐20	 g/t	Au.	 	 The	 adjacent	hole,	 TGD376,	which	 is	 only	 23	meters	 away,	 does	not	 contain	 any	
hangingwall	 mineralization.	 	 Neither	 was	 hangingwall	 mineralization	 observed	 in	 the	 mine	
workings	which	occur	within	11	meters	of	the	above	noted	intersection.		

Where	this	occurs,	the	hangingwall	is	more	likely	to	carry	gold	grades	in	drilling	while	the	footwall	
in	face	samples	is	more	likely	to	carry	gold	grades.		The	discrepancy	is	caused	by	the	necessity	of	
keeping	the	vein	in	the	upper	portion	of	the	face	and	sampling	the	footwall	as	a	result.		This	is	an	
example	 of	 sample	 selection	bias.	Higher	 gold	 grades	 that	 can	be	 found	 in	 the	 host	 rock	 is	 a	
feature	 of	 many	 brittle‐ductile	 mesothermal	 type	 gold	 veins	 with	 high	 degrees	 of	
metamorphism.	 	While	contamination	during	sampling	of	 faces	is	a	concern,	since	it	also	
occurs	in	drilling	suggests	that	it	is	a	feature	of	the	deposit.		However,	the	grades	in	these	
host	rocks	are	often	very	discontinuous	and	not	usually	mineable	without	assay	control.		
For	this	reason,	gold	values	in	the	wall	rocks	in	contact	with	the	vein/fault	structure	are	
not	included	in	the	resource.	

Hole	 TGDDH009	 actually	 contains	 a	 barren	 breccia	 with	 5‐8	 g/t	 Au	 in	 both	 hangingwall	 and	
footwall	shales.	

Underground	Chip	Sampling	 ‐	 In	2010,	 a	 face	 sampling	 system	was	 initiated	with	 appropriate	
data	 tracking.	 	 Samples	were	 taken	by	geological	domain.	 	 Since	sampling	of	 flat	veins	 in	 jumbo	
established	 mine	 headings	 is	 difficult	 a	 procedure	 was	 initiated	 that	 required	 the	 use	 of	 long	
scaling	bars	to	knock	samples	from	the	face	and	collect	them	on	a	mat.		This	mat	was	shaken	out	
after	each	sample.	Sampling	in	the	main	drives	was	performed	from	a	basket	mounted	on	a	loader.	
Sampling	procedures	were	not	followed	rigorously.	 	However,	these	data	are	used	in	the	current	
resource	estimate.	

Muck	 Sampling	Reconciliation	 ‐	 A	 muck	 sampling	 procedure	 was	 initiated	 in	 2010.	 	 Bogger	
(underground	loader)	operators	were	instructed	to	take	one	muck	sample	for	each	truck.		Sample	
bags	were	appropriately	 labeled	and	 left	at	 the	ROM	for	pick‐up	by	the	samplers	and	geologists.		
Older	stockpiles	were	extensively	sampled.				

Sampling	of	trucks	and	grabs	of	surface	stockpiles	have	produced	a	global	capped	grade	of	2.44	g/t	
Au.	 	This	 is	at	odds	with	the	block	model	grade	 for	 the	mined	areas	at	7.08	g/t	Au	and	suggests	
almost	300%	dilution.	 	This	appears	reasonable	given	that	the	narrow	vein	was	often	mined	full	
face	using	a	two	boom	jumbo.	 	Given	that	the	vein	is	roughly	1m	wide	and	is	mined	3m	wide	or	
more	in	the	development	headings	–	this	amount	of	dilution	appears	very	reasonable.			

Resuing	or	split‐firing	was	employed	inconsistently	and	observations	of	the	mining	showed	a	great	
deal	of	metal	loss.

Table	17‐45	 is	an	example	of	 the	range	of	variability	of	assays	within	a	round.	 	These	represent	
bogger	operator	samples	–	one	sample	for	each	truck	for	a	single	round.			

	

	

TABLE	17‐45	MUCK	PILE	GRADE	VARIABILITY	

An	 addition	 test	 was	 performed	 where	 a	 small	 stockpile	 of	 known	 grade	 was	 moved	 and	
resampled.		Note	that	in	Table	17‐45,	the	grade	for	the	same	pile	dropped	from	7.38	g/t	Au	to	4.61	
g/t	Au	which	is	more	of	an	average	grade	for	the	mucks	overall.		

Table	 17‐45	 shows	 the	 effects	 of	 sampling	 bias.	 	 Gold	 is	 known	 to	 occur	 with	 sulphides	 –	
particularly	 arsenopyrite	 and	 pyrite	 to	 a	 lesser	 extent.	 	 Since	 sulphides	 are	 soft,	 gold	 will	
preferentially	occur	 in	 the	 fines.	 	As	muck	 is	 re‐handled	 it	will	become	better	mixed	 throughout	
and	will	usually	report	a	lower	grade	–	in	this	case	a	38%	reduction.		This	is	commonly	observed	in	
vein	type	deposits	that	contain	fine	gold.	
	
Face/Wall	Sample	Reconciliation	‐	It	is	apparent	that	the	resource	model	overestimates	the		
grade	at	Tom's	Gully	due	to	the	spotty	nature	of	the	overall	gold	distribution.		
	
An	analysis	of	the	comparison	between	the	Odessa	resource	calculation	and	the	current	resource	
for	 the	Alpha	Block	(Figure	17‐54)	has	been	completed.	 	The	Odessa	resource	was	based	on	the	
available	drill	holes	at	time	and	GBS	chip	sampling	–which	was	very	limited.			
	
Odessa	provided	both	a	kriged	and	an	inverse	distance	squared	resource	calculation.	An	outline	of	
the	high‐grade	 in	 the	Alpha	Block	was	drawn	 to	 constrain	 the	 resource	 for	 the	 area.	 	 The	 same	
constraint	outline	was	then	applied	to	the	current	resource	model.	 	Table	17‐45	summarizes	the	
results.	 	 These	 same	 results	 are	 visually	 displayed	 in	 Figure	 17‐55	 and	 Figure	 17‐56.	 	 The	
differences	 are	 extreme.	 	 Less	 than	half	 the	ounces	 remain	 in	 the	 current	 resource	of	 the	Alpha	
Block.	 	Note	 that	 the	distribution	of	 the	gold	 is	much	more	 erratic	 and	 the	grades	are	generally	
depressed	compared	to	 the	Odessa	resource.	 	These	differences	are	 interpreted	to	be	due	to	 the

nature	of	the	block	modeling	and	it's	assumption	of	continuity	of	gold	between	composites.	Higher	
grade	drill	holes	have	severely	limited	influence,	on	the	order	of	a	several	meters	at	best.	 	These	
observations	are	deemed	applicable	to	the	deeper	areas	of	the	Tom's	Gully	vein	where	no	mining	
has	taken	place.		In	fact,	mining	in	the	Foxtrot	Zone,	even	though	it	was	within	the	better	portions	
of	earlier	iterations	of	the	block	model,	has	not	reproduced	the	predicted	grades.		Grades	were	of	
lower	tenor	and	significantly	more	erratic.		It	therefore	appears	likely	that	the	resources	at	depth	
are	suspect	and	any	resource	method	one	brings	to	bear	on	it,	may	significantly	over‐estimate	gold	
grades.

Dilution	and	Metal	Loss	‐		Approximately	10‐15%	ore	loss	occurs	from	split‐shooting.	Part	of	the	
ore	vein	inevitably	falls	in	with	the	waste	near	the	brow.	Sometimes	the	entire	vein	falls	in	with	the	
waste	 because	 of	 the	 fault	 gouge	 at	 the	 upper	 contact	 of	 the	 vein.	 The	 vein	 can	 deviate	 rapidly	
causing	the	jumbo	to	over	correct	due	to	the	length	of	the	round	causing	both	dilution	and	ore	loss.		
Veins	are	rarely	ever	perfect	planes	and	tend	to	deviate	regularly.	
	
Essentially	the	equipment	utilized	was	too	large	to	mine	a	narrow	structure	such	as	is	present	at	
the	Tom's	Gully	deposit,	even	at	current	high	gold	prices.	
	
	
Conclusions	‐	All	past	resource	estimates	at	Tom's	Gully	are	suspect.	Reconciliations	with	the		
final	 results	 of	mining	 to	what	Odessa's	 resource	 indicated	display	 that	 there	 is	poor	 continuity	
between	drill	hole	intersections.		Despite	sufficient	holes	carrying	high	enough	gold	grades	for	any	
block	model,	contouring	program,	statistic,	or	visual	 inspection	to	assume	adequate	continuity	 it	
appears	 that	 the	 Tom's	 Gully	 deposit	 contains	 very	 discontinuous	 gold	 grades	 that	 cannot	 be

possibly	there	 is	 little	or	none.	 	This	may	hold	true	at	depth	as	well,	where	development	mining	
was	just	reaching	the	higher	grade	areas	,as	indicated	by	surface	drilling,	before	mining	operations

Code	 for	Reporting	 of	Mineral	Resources	 and	Ore	Reserves	 prepared	 in	 1999	by	 the	 Joint	Ore	
Reserves	Committee	(JORC).		
	
The	following	is	extrapolated	from	Payne	2004:	

"Exploration	and	grade	control	databases	were	provided	by	VVI.	For	the	exploration	data	separate	
Access	databases	 for	 the	 four	main	mineralized	areas	 (Dolly	Pot,	Beef	Bucket,	Backhoe	and	Sweat	
Ridge)	 were	 provided	 to	 ResEval	 by	 VVI.	 	 These	 databases	 were	 then	 merged	 to	 form	 a	 single	
database	for	the	Rustlers	Roost	project.	

The	GC	(grade	control)	data	was	contained	in	separate	databases	for	each	mining	level	in	each	of	the	
four	mineralized	zones.	

The	full	database	contained	records	for	883	drill	holes,	however	the	method	of	drilling	(i.e.	diamond	
core	or	RC	 etc.)	 is	not	 immediately	apparent	 from	 the	database.	 	A	 total	of	63,617m	of	drilling	 is	
represented	in	the	database.	

The	reported	resource	includes	402	drill	holes	for	39,855m.	

	Sampling	and	Assaying	Procedures	

Prior	to	2003,	diamond	core	drilling	was	undertaken	using	HQ	or	HQ	triple	tube	(63.1mm	diameter)	
coring.		High	quality	core	was	produced	with	a	total	recovery	rate	in	excess	of	95%.		Core	orientation	
marks	using	a	spear	were	made	on	all	angle	holes	and	the	core	fitted	back	together	prior	to	logging	
and	sampling.		The	core	was	sampled	at	1m	intervals.		All	core	was	cut	in	half	and	the	'south'	side	of	
the	core	submitted	to	the	laboratory	for	assay.	 	Assaying	was	completed	by	Assaycorp	at	Pine	Creek	
using	FA50	(50g	charge)	with	AAS	finish.	

RC	drilling	produced	 '..high	quality,	uncontaminated	dry	and	wet	percussion	chip	samples.'	(Rabone,	
1995).		RC	holes	were	sampled	at	regular	1m	intervals	and	sent	to	Assaycorp.	

All	holes	drilled	in	2003	(9	holes)	were	drilled	using	HQ	coring	(63.5mm	diameter).		Core	was	cut	in	
half	in	a	consistent	manner	with	respect	to	the	orientation	of	bedding	and	was	generally	sampled	as	
2m	composites.		Samples	were	then	sent	to	North	Australian	Laboratories	Pty	Ltd	(NAL)	in	Pine	Creek	
and	assayed	by	FA50	(50g	charge)	with	AAS	finish.	

	Quality	Control	

Quality	 control	data	has	not	been	 reviewed.	However	a	QA/QC	protocol	was	 included	 in	 the	2003	
drilling	program.	 	Quality	control	procedures	 for	drilling	prior	 to	2003	are	described	 in	reports	by	
Rabone	(1995,	1996).	

	Collar	and	Down	Hole	surveys	

Collar	surveys	 for	holes	drilled	prior	 to	2003	were	generally	completed	by	Qasco	Northern	Surveys	
Pty	Ltd	of	Darwin	with	some	holes	also	surveyed	by	Valdora's	mine	site	surveyors.	 	Collars	for	holes	
drilled	in	2003	were	surveyed	using	GPS.	

Down	hole	surveys	were	completed	by	 the	drilling	contractor	at	 the	 time	using	an	Eastman	or	Pee	
Wee	 single	 shot	 camera.	 	Holes	drilled	prior	 to	2003	were	 surveyed	at	 the	bottom	of	 the	hole	and	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

[291]	
	

depending	on	the	amount	of	hole	deviation,	one,	two	or	three	additional	surveys	back	up	the	hole.		For	
subsequent	drilling,	 surveys	were	 taken	at	 intervals	 ranging	between	25‐50	meters.	 	Vertical	holes	
were	not	surveyed	down	hole	to	reduce	costs.	

	Data	Excluded	From	Estimate	

Grade	 control	 data	was	 used	 as	 a	 guide	 to	 interpretation	 of	mineralization,	 however,	 	 no	 grade	
control	drilling	was	included	in	the	estimate.	

Six	drill	holes	(RDH31‐35	and	S20)	were	removed	from	the	resource	as	no	assays	were	provided	in	the	
database.	

DATABASE	VERIFICATION	AND	DATA	CHANGES	

Database	verification	was	not	carried	out	by	ResEval.	

Mineral	Resource	Estimate	

Geology	and	Resource	Interpretation	

Two	datasets	were	available	for	the	Rustlers	Roost	deposit.	One	comprised	a	database	of	all	available	
exploration	drilling.	From	 these	a	 set	of	 east‐west	drill	hole	 cross	 sections	were	 extracted	at	50m	
intervals.	All	holes	were	plotted	and	the	gold	assay	field	au_1	was	shown	along	with	the	geology	field	
LITHO.	 A	 slice	 through	 the	 pit	 survey	 dtm	 (EOMR9705.dtm)	 provided	 by	 VVI	 was	 also	 plotted.	
Previously	completed	geological	 interpretations	by	Exploremin	were	also	available	 for	use	with	the	
resource	interpretation.	

In	addition	to	the	exploration	holes,	a	series	of	grade	control	databases	were	provided	by	VVI.	Grade	
control	sampling	generally	comprised	5m	deep	vertical	blast	holes	sampled	at	2.5m	intervals.	Holes	
were	 drilled	at	 a	 staggered	 3.5m	 by	 3.5m	 pattern.	As	 an	 initial	 attempt	 to	 understand	 the	 grade	
distribution	at	the	deposit,	several	GC	flitch	plots	were	generated.	These	showed	the	2.5m	blast	hole	
samples	for	specific	mining	benches.	The	data	showed	quite	distinctly	the	different	mineralized	zones	
in	the	deposit.		

GC	ore	blocks	were	also	plotted	on	the	flitches.	These	generally	consisted	of	thin,	continuous	blocks,	
commonly	 less	 than	2m	wide.	 In	many	 cases,	 the	assay	data	 did	not	 support	 the	 geometry	 of	 the	
defined	block,	and	substantial	amounts	of	mineralized	values	were	omitted	from	the	blocks.	

A	 series	 of	 cross	 sections	were	 generated	at	25m	 intervals	 through	 the	GC	databases.	These	were	
plotted	and	grade	 contouring	of	 the	grade	 control	data	was	 carried	out.	The	 contouring	was	also	
extended	into	the	exploration	data	below	the	pit.	Initially	a	0.4g/t	cutoff	was	used	to	try	and	replicate	
the	 previous	 resource	model.	The	narrow,	discrete	 lodes	 shown	 in	 the	GC	 ore	 blocks	 could	not	 be	
reproduced.	 Instead	 it	 was	 necessary	 to	 delineate	 large	 pods	 of	 mineralization	 which,	 in	 the	
exploration	drilling	showed	quite	poor	continuity	at	the	0.4g/t	cutoff.	To	try	and	define	zones	with	
reasonable	 continuity	of	mineralization,	 it	was	necessary	 to	use	a	0.2g/t	 cutoff.	This	 resulted	 in	a	
substantial	"mineralization	corridor"	corresponding	to	the	sheeted	vein	set	described	 in	Goulevitch,	
2004b.	

The	mineralized	corridor	displayed	a	distinct	shallow	easterly	dip	in	the	southern	portion	(Backhoe	
area)	of	 the	deposit.	This	 clearly	 transgressed	 the	 stratigraphy.	Further	north,	a	 reasonably	 rapid

change	occurred	at	around	60550N,	north	of	which	the	western	portion	of	the	corridor	steepened	to	
sub‐vertical	and	then	steep	west	dipping.	This	was	especially	evident	north	of	the	Broken	Nose	Fault	
and	reflects	the	steep	north‐south	mineralization	of	the	Sweat	Ridge	deposit.		

Throughout	 the	 central	area	of	 the	deposit,	 the	 corridor	maintained	 the	 shallow	easterly	dip.	This	
represents	the	down	dip	portion	of	the	Dolly	Pot	and	Beef	Bucket	areas	and	encompasses	some	of	the	
better	developed	mineralization	below	the	pit	floor.	

Previously	defined	weathering	profiles	for	the	Rustlers	Roost	deposit	were	provided	to	ResEval	and	
these	were	used	in	the	estimation	to	divide	the	oxide,	transition	and	fresh	ore	zones.	
	
	Preparation	of	Wireframes	

The	 interpreted	 sectional	 outlines	were	manually	 triangulated	 to	 form	 three‐dimensional	models	
(3DMs)	as	shown	in	Figures	7.1	and	7.2.			

Separate	 wireframes	 or	 'domains'	 were	 formed	 to	 represent	 changes	 in	 strike	 and	 dip	 of	 the	
mineralization	 based	 on	 interpretation	 of	 grade	 control	 data	 and	 exploration	 drilling.	 Geological	
interpretations	provided	by	Exploremin	were	also	used	to	assist	in	the	definition	of	the	domains.

The	3DMs	 of	 the	mineralized	 zones	were	used	 to	 code	 the	database	 to	allow	 identification	 of	 the

was	 then	 used	 to	 extract	 2.0m	 downhole	 composites	 within	 the	 intervals	 coded	 as	 resource	
intersections.	

The	 composites	were	 checked	 for	 spatial	 correlation	with	 the	 objects,	 the	 location	 of	 the	 rejected	
composites,	and	zero	composite	values.		Individual	composite	files	were	created	for	each	object	in	the	
wireframe	models.

TABLE	17‐47		SUMMARY	STATISTICS	OF	RUSTLERS	ROOST	2M	RESOURCE	COMPOSITES	

As	expected,	the	data	is	positively	skewed	and	the	application	of	a	high	grade	cut	was	used	prior	to	
interpolation.	However	only	a	small	number	of	very	high	grade	samples	are	present,	so	the	effect	of	
high	grade	cutting	is	minimal.	An	interesting	feature	of	the	deposit	is	that	the	statistics	of	each	of	the	
zones	are	relatively	constant.	

	High	Grade	Cuts	

To	 assist	 in	 the	 selection	 of	 appropriate	 high	 grade	 cuts,	 the	 composite	 data	was	 imported	 into	
GeoAccess	 software	 and	 a	 log‐probability	 plot	was	 generated.	 The	 data	 showed	 an	 approximate	
lognormal	distribution	for	both	datasets.		The	plot	is	shown	in	Figures	7.3.

FIGURE	17‐58	PROBABILITY	PLOT	RUSTLERS	ROOST	2M	COMPOSITE	DATA	–	ALL	ZONES	

A	 number	 of	methods	 can	 be	 used	 to	 help	 select	 an	 appropriate	 high	 grade	 cut	 value.	 The	 97.5	
percentile	value	of	3.5g/t	 for	all	zones	was	considered	 to	be	 too	 low	and	no	distinct	change	 in	 the	
probability	plot	(Figure	17‐58)	was	observed	at	this	point.		However,	the	probability	plot	does	show	a	
distinct	break	and	an	inflexion	at	10g/t.	This	value	was	selected	as	the	high	grade	cut	(and	was	also	
used	in	the	previous	BLM	estimation).		The	effect	of	a	high	grade	cut	at	this	value	was	also	assessed	in	
the	resource	model.	

The	selected	cut	value	was	applied	to	2.0m	composite	data	and	resulted	in	25	values	being	cut.	The	
effect	on	the	mean	grade	of	the	composites	was	a	reduction	from	0.653g/t	to	0.647	g/t	between	the	
mean	and	cut	mean	values.	

	Geostatistical	Analysis	

Variography	was	attempted	using	the	2m	composite	data	from	inside	the	mineralization	wireframes.	
Poorly	 structured	 variograms	 were	 generated.	 The	 only	 directional	 variograms	 that	 showed	
reasonable	structure	were	in	the	east‐west	direction	and	were	considered	to	be	a	result	of	the	closer	
drill	spacing	in	that	direction.	Consequently,	the	drilling	is	considered	to	be	beyond	the	limits	of	the	
short	range	variability	of	the	gold	mineralization.		

Without	robust	variograms,	geostatistical	interpolation	methods	were	not	considered	appropriate,	so	
inverse	distance	to	power	2	(ID2)	interpolation	was	chosen	for	the	Rustlers	estimate	with	ellipsoids	
oriented	to	match	mineralization	directions	evident	in	the	GC	sample	data.	

	Block	Model	

A	block	model	was	created	using	Surpac	software	to	encompass	the	full	extent	of	the	deposit.		Block	
model	parameters	are	listed	in	Table	17‐48.	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	
								

[296]	
	

The	block	model	used	a	primary	block	size	of	10m	EW	by	20m	NS	by	5m	vertical	with	sub‐blocking	to	
5m	by	10m	by	2.5m.	The	parent	block	 size	was	 selected	on	 the	basis	of	approximately	50%	of	 the	
average	drill	hole	 spacing.	 	 	Sub‐celling	 to	10m	by	5m	by	2.5m	was	allowed	 to	ensure	 that	model	
honoured	the	wireframe	constraints.	

TABLE	17‐48	BLOCK	MODEL	PARAMETERS	MOUNT	BUNDY	DEPOSIT	(RUSTLERS	ROOST)	

	Grade		Interpolation	

It	was	evident	 from	 the	GC	sampling	and	ore	delineation	 that	different	portions	of	 the	deposit	had	
quite	 different	 geometry	 for	 the	 higher	 grade	 mineralization,	 even	 though	 the	 mineralization	
envelope	was	relatively	uniform.	As	noted	 in	Goulevitch,	2004b	and	by	other	authors,	 this	reflected	
the	 strong	 stratigraphic	 control	 on	mineralization.	 Therefore	 it	was	 necessary	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	
grade	interpolation	honoured	the	geometry	of	the	stratigraphy	in	the	different	areas	of	the	deposit.	
	
A	number	of	the	geological	features	interpreted	from	the	exploration	drilling	did	not	correspond	well	
to	 the	distribution	 of	 gold	 grades	and	were	 subtle	and	difficult	 to	 interpret	with	 confidence.	As	a	
result,	it	was	decided	to	use	the	geological	boundaries	and	spatial	boundaries	as	"soft	boundaries"	in	
the	interpolation	process.	This	meant	that	a	single	assay	file	was	created	for	the	entire	mineralized	
envelope,	and	was	used	to	interpolate	the	different	regions	of	the	deposit	without	further	constraints.	
	
The	interpolation	regions	and	interpolation	directions	are	shown	in	Table	17‐49	below.

2.27t/m3	for	the	oxide	mineralization	from	limited	data	derived	from	gamma‐gamma	logging	of	four	
shallow	percussion	holes	and	in‐pit	ISBD	sampling.	

The	BLM	estimate	used	an	average	bulk	density	of	2.46t/m3	for	all	the	mineralization.

Exploremin	 provided	 SG	 data	 to	 ResEval	 from	 the	 most	 recent	 drilling	 at	 Rustlers	 Roost.	 	 This	
involved	 taking	 285	 samples	 from	 9	 diamond	 core	 holes	 (RRDH051‐059).	 	 The	 data	 was	 sorted	
according	to	depth	in	relation	to	the	weathering	profile.		The	values	are	shown	in	graphical	form	in	
Figure	17‐60	below.	

	

	
FIGURE	17‐60	DENSITY	VALUES	FROM	RECENT	DIAMOND	DRILL	HOLES	

The	values	show	quite	high	variability	as	observed	by	Rabone.	However	the	average	values	from	the	
data	 for	 the	 different	 weathering	 types	 are	 consistent	 with	 previous	 data.	 The	 average	 values	
(rounded	 down	 to	 the	 nearest	 0.1)	 for	 the	 oxide	 (2.30t/m3),	 transitional	 (2.50t/m3)	 and	 fresh	
(2.70t/m3)	were	then	used	in	the	ResEval	estimate.	

Further	work	at	the	project	should	include	more	test	work	to	define	the	bulk	density	of	the	oxidized,	
transitional	and	fresh	rock,	both	mineralized	and	un‐mineralized.	

	Mineral	Resource	Classification	

The	Rustlers	Roost	deposit	is	large	tonnage,	low	grade	gold	deposit	which	when	modeled	using	a	very	
low	 grade	 cut‐off	 (0.2g/t)	 allows	 the	 drill	 hole	 intersections	 to	 be	 modeled	 into	 a	 coherent,	
geologically	 robust	 wireframe.	 	 Good	 consistency	 is	 evident	 in	 the	 thickness	 of	 mineralization,	
however	the	grade	distribution	appears	more	variable	with	higher	grade	zones	appearing	to	be	quite	
discontinuous.	

The	average	drillhole	cross	section	spacing	of	25‐50m	in	the	resource	area	is	considered	adequate	to	
define	 the	 resource	 zones	 in	 thickness,	 lateral	 extent	 and	 attitude	 with	 a	 reasonable	 degree	 of	
confidence.	 The	 detailed	 grade	 control	 sampling	 data	 also	 shows	 the	 same	 trends	 in	 grade	 and	
geometry	for	the	mined	portion	of	the	deposit.	ResEval	considers	that	the	confidence	level	is	sufficient	
to	categorize	the	majority	of	the	mineralization	as	an	Indicated	Mineral	Resource,	however	where	the	
drill	hole	spacing	became	consistently	greater	than	50m	(below	500mRL	east	of	1050mE	and	below	
450mRL	west	of	1050mE)	it	was	considered	that	the	drill	spacing	and	reduced	confidence	of	structure	
meant	that	this	area	was	classified	as	Inferred.	

The	resource	block	model	has	an	attribute	"class"	for	all	blocks	within	the	resource	wireframes	coded	
as	either	"ind"	for	Indicated	or	"inf"	for	Inferred.

FIGURE	17‐64	RUSTLERS	ROOST	GRADE‐TONNAGE	CURVE	

The	 ResEval	 Mineral	 Resource	 estimate	 represents	 a	 marginal	 increase	 in	 contained	 ounces	
compared	to	the	BLM	estimate	however	they	are	not	directly	comparable	as	the	BLM	estimate	was	
made	using	wireframes	constructed	from	0.4g/t	boundaries	to	a	depth	70‐100m	below	the	pit	floor,	
whereas	the	ResEval	estimate	used	0.2g/t	boundaries	for	wireframing	to	approximately	200m	below	
the	pit	floor.	 	The	BLM	estimate	is	also	reported	at	a	0.4g/t	cut‐off	whereas	the	ResEval	estimate	is	
reported	at	a	0.75g/t	cut‐off.	

Cutoff	Grade	

As	shown	in	Table	17‐52	and	Figure	17‐64,	the	reported	resource	is	highly	sensitive	to	cutoff	grade.	
The	 value	 of	 0.75g/t	 recommended	 by	 ResEval	 is	 based	 on	 that	 used	 at	 the	 Ravenswood	 Gold	
operation	in	Australia.	Ravenswood	operates	at	approximately	5	million	tonnes	per	annum	and	uses	
a	 direct	mill	 feed	 cutoff	 grade	 of	 0.8g/t.	The	mineralization	 at	Rustlers	 is	 not	 as	 hard	 as	 that	 at	
Ravenswood,	but	is	reported	to	have	some	metallurgical	complexity.	Therefore	a	cutoff	of	0.75g/t	was	
recommended.	

If	metallurgical	investigations	are	completed	as	part	of	a	planned	scoping	study	at	Rustlers,	a	likely	
economic	cutoff	grade	can	be	more	accurately	determined.	The	resource	should	be	re‐reported	at	the	
determined	cutoff	grade	once	it	is	available.	

	Model	Validation	

In	 order	 to	 check	 that	 the	 interpolation	 of	 the	 block	model	 correctly	 honoured	 the	 drilling	 data,	
validation	was	carried	out	by	comparing	the	interpolated	blocks	to	the	sample	composite	data	for	all	
zones	of	the	resource.	Validation	results	for	the	deposit	are	summarized	in	Figure	17‐65	and	Figure	
17‐66.

resource	calculation	for	the	Thunderball	uranium	deposit.	It	stated	the	following:	

"The	 resource	 estimate	 is	 based	 upon	 chemical	 assay	 data	 from	 16	 diamond	 and	 39	 reverse	
circulation	drill	holes	completed	at	Thunderball	since	the	deposit	was	discovered	by	Thundelarra	in

calculated	at	 lower	cut‐off	grades	of	200	ppm	U3O8	and	400	ppm	U3O8	 for	each	of	 the	two	parallel	
zones	of	mineralization,	as	presented	in	the	table	below.	See	Figure	17‐69:

Thunderball	has	returned	a	number	of	exceptionally	high	grade	drill	intercepts,	however	the	current	
drill	 hole	 spacing	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 insufficient	 to	 prove	 continuity	 of	 this	 very	 high	 grade	
mineralization.	Consequently	a	cautious	approach	has	been	taken	to	the	classification	of	the	resource	
and	 a	 top	 cut	 applied	 to	 limit	 the	 influence	 of	 the	 high	 grade	 intercepts.	 The	 4,000	 ppm	 top	 cut	
affected	 five	 data	 composites	 that	 had	 uncut	 average	 grades	 of	 up	 to	 76,000	 ppm	 U3O8	 and	
disproportionally	increased	contained	metal	by	200%.	The	uncut	model	comprises	775,000	tonnes	at	
an	average	grade	of	3,196	ppm	U3O8	for	5.5	million	pounds	of	U3O8	(400	ppm	U3O8	lower	cut).	
	
Geological	modeling	associated	with	the	resource	estimation	has	highlighted	the	potential	to	identify	
repetitions	of	 the	existing	mineralized	zones	at	Thunderball.	 In	particular	 the	contact	between	 the	
Gerowie	Tuff	and	Zamu	Dolerite,	approximately	70	meters	 stratigraphically	below	 the	Lower	Zone	
resource,	is	considered	a	priority	target.(Figure	17‐69)	
	
The	Thunderball	deposit	is	situated	on	Exploration	License	EL23431.	Thundelarra	has	a	70%	interest	
in	the	uranium	rights	on	EL23431	in	joint	venture	with	Crocodile	Gold	Australia	Pty	Ltd.

Mineral	Reserve	estimations	are	prepared	 in	accordance	with	the	Canadian	Institute	of	Mining,	
Metallurgy	 and	 Petroleum	 (CIM)	 Definition	 Standards	 ‐	 On	 Mineral	 Resources	 and	 Mineral	
Reserves	(December,	2005),	as	incorporated	by	reference	in	NI43‐101.		
	
All	 designs	 and	 interrogations	 were	 performed	 on	 Mine	 2‐4D	 V12.0	 software	 and	 schedules	
created	 using	 Earthworks	 Planner	 V2.0.	 	 Microsoft	 Excel	 2007	 was	 used	 for	 the	 spreadsheet	
reporting	and	some	financial	calculations.	
	
Data	validation	tools	have	been	used	on	block	models	to	ensure	that	wireframe	shapes	and	block	
models	used	in	the	calculation	of	mineral	reserves	are	not	corrupt	in	any	way.		This	is	performed	
by	comparing	the	model	volume	from	block	models	to	the	volume	calculated	for	the	wireframe	
shape.

Validation	 of	 the	 block	model	 included	 checks	 on	missing	 and	negative	 values	 to	 ensure	 these	
were	not	present	in	the	calculation	of	tonnes	and	grades.	
	
No	 Inferred	 Mineral	 Resources	 are	 included	 in	 the	 defined	 Mineral	 Reserves.	 	 The	 Inferred	
Mineral	Resource	material	has	been	depleted	from	the	block	models	used	for	the	calculation	of	
the	 Mineral	 Reserves.	 The	 reported	 Mineral	 Reserves	 are	 all	 classified	 as	 Probable	 Mineral	
Reserve,	as	they	relate	to	the	conversion	of	an	Indicated	Mineral	Resource.		
	
To	the	knowledge	of	Mr.	Gerritsen,	the	Mineral	Reserve	estimate	is	not	materially	affected	by	any	
known	environmental,	permitting,	legal,	title,	taxation,	socio‐political	or	marketing	issues.	

17.15 	CUT‐OFF	GRADE	CONSIDERATIONS	

The	economic	 cut‐off	 grade	 for	 each	deposit,	 shown	 in	Table	17‐55	above,	has	been	estimated	
based	 on	 historical	 mining	 and	 metallurgical	 recoveries	 and	 costs	 and	 forecast	 mining	
parameters,	 including	 production	 rates,	 mining	 and	 metallurgical	 recoveries,	 haulage	 costs,	 if	
applicable,	and	mining,	milling	and	administration	costs,	as	discussed	in	Section	23	of	this	report.	
	
Brocks	Creek	Gold	Mine	
	
The	cut‐off	grade	for	the	Brocks	Creek	deposit	is	based	on	the	anticipated	cost	of	production	for	
this	current	financial	year.		The	cut‐off	grade	has	been	applied	on	a	breakeven	case	with	margin	
built	 in	 to	 the	 gold	 price,	 being	 well	 below	 current	 spot	 price.	 	 The	 assumptions	 in	 the	
determination	of	this	cut‐off	grade	are	presented	in	the	table	below	(Table	17‐56).	
	
The	high	grade	and	sharp	nature	of	 the	ore	 ‐	waste	boundary	of	 the	Brocks	Creek	gold	deposit	
means	that	ore	grades	are	commonly	higher	than	the	cut‐off	and	breakeven	grades	shown.		There	
are	natural	cut‐offs	(ore	boundaries	that	are	higher	grade	than	those	calculated).

The	calculation	of	 the	cut‐off	grade	has	been	based	on	 the	anticipated	cost	of	production.	 	The	
cut‐off	grade	has	been	applied	on	a	breakeven	scenario	with	the	margin	being	the	upside	on	the	
estimated	gold	price.	The	current	spot	price	is	significantly	higher	than	the	price	used	in	reserves.	
The	assumptions	used	in	the	determination	of	the	cut‐off	grade	are	presented	in	the	table	below	
(Table	17‐57).	
	
The	cut‐off	grade	was	calculated	 from	the	historical	mining	costs	of	Brocks	Creek	for	Crocodile	
Gold	Costs	and	the	recently	awarded	Schedule	of	Rates	Contract	for	Cosmo	Mine.		
	
A	cut‐off	grade	of	2.7g/t	Au	was	calculated	for	the	Cosmo	Deeps	deposit.

Open	Pit	Cut	Off	Grades	
	
The	pits	have	been	designed	on	Optimization	 shells	using	 inputs	of	mining	 costs	 from	existing	
mining	contracts.		There	has	been	a	two	phased	approach	to	the	cut	off	grades	with	the	first	pass	
being	that	anything	higher	than	a	total	cut‐off	grade	for	that	deposit	being	used	to	design	the	pit.		
The	second	phase	 is	 that	anything	 that	 returns	a	margin	on	 the	haulage	and	processing	 that	 is	
mined	in	the	winning	of	ore	from	the	initial	cut‐off	grade	is	included	in	the	reserve	as	it	is	to	be	
mined	anyway	in	the	process	of	mining	the	pit	shell.		This	marginal	ore	as	mined	economically	for	
the	winning	of	ore	in	the	first	phase	cut	off	is	also	added	to	the	reserve	as	it	is	economic	as	the	
mining	is	paid	for	in	the	first	phase	and	it	returns	a	margin	on	processing	and	haulage.		
	
It	should	be	noted	that	the	marginal	cut‐off	grade	is	not	used	 in	the	design	process	and	is	used	
only	for	the	byproduct	economic	extraction	from	the	original	design.	(Table	17‐58).	
	
The	final	check	is	that	the	total	mining	of	the	pit	is	cash	flow	positive	which	can	be	seen	in	section

19 INTERPRETATION 	& 	CONCLUSIONS 	

	
The	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 of	 Crocodile	 Gold	 comprise	 a	 large	 tenement	 package	 in	 excess	 of	
2,700km²	 within	 which	 approximately	 3.5	 million	 ounces	 of	 gold	 have	 historically	 been	 produced	 and	 which	
contains	a	substantial	quantified	mineral	 inventory	of	gold	resources	[Measured	Mineral	Resource:	602,330t	@	
1.3g/t	gold	(24,300oz	gold);	Indicated	Mineral	Resource:	51,247,000t	@	1.9g/t	gold	(3,150,800oz	gold);	Inferred	
Mineral	Resource:	36,352,000t	@	1.8g/t	gold	(2,143,400oz	gold)].		
	
Probable	Mineral	 Reserves	 totaling	 7,699,000t	@	 2.7g/t	 gold	 (662,000oz	 gold;	 620,000oz	 gold	 recovered)	 are	
estimated	 for	 the	Howley,	Princess	Louise,	North	Point,	Kohinoor,	South	Enterprise,	Cox,	Gandy's,	 International	
and	 Mottrams	 open	 pit	 mines,	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 underground	 mine	 and	 the	 Cosmo	 deposit	 which	 is	 under	
development.	
	
A	 review	of	 the	 geology	 and	historical	 exploration	 activity	 of	 the	Properties	 and	 individual	 deposits	 identified	
indicates	 there	 remains	 good	potential	 to	 expand	existing	 resources	 and	 reserves	 and	 that	 the	properties	 also	
hold	considerable	upside	exploration	potential	for	gold,	as	well	as	base	metals	and	uranium.		
	
Targeted	 drilling	 programs	 have	 been	 identified	 to	 better	 define	 existing	 resources/reserves	 and	 to	 further	
evaluate	the	regional	potential	of	the	Properties.	
	
Mining	 by	 past	 operators	 has	 aided	 considerably	 in	 the	 reinterpretation	 of	 these	 orebodies	 and	 estimation	 of	
Mineral	Resources	 and	Mineral	Reserves	 and	has	provided	valuable	 information	on	dilution	and	grade	 control	
and	on	the	success	and	limitations	of	various	mining	techniques.	This	information	has	been	incorporated	in	the	
preparation	of	the	Mineral	Reserve	estimations	included	within	this	report	and	in	recommendations	for	changes	
in	management	and	mining	practices.	
	
Several	 additional	 studies	have	been	 identified	which	will	 advance	development	of	new	projects	or	potentially	
improve	the	economics	of	existing	mines.		
	

19.1 	REGIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS	

	
The	Pine	Creek	Orogen	has	historically	produced	 in	 excess	 of	 3.7million	 ounces	 of	 gold;	most	 of	 this	 total	 has	
come	from	mines	within	Crocodile	Gold's	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties.	
	
Gold	deposits	within	the	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	have	a	structurally	controlled	mesothermal	setting	
with	a	preference	for	competency	contrast	situations	in	dilatant	or	low	pressure	zones,	such	as	anticlinal	crests,	
recurrent	shear	zones	and	necking	zones.		
	
The	lower	parts	of	the	Burrell	Creek	Formation,	particularly	above	the	Middle	Koolpin	Formation,	are	the	most	
favourable	stratigraphic	position	for	gold	mineralization.	Most	gold	deposits	within	the	Pine	Creek	Orogen	trend	
northwest‐southeast.	Over	half	of	the	gold	occurrences	are	gold‐quartz	vein	deposits.	
	
Gold	mineralization	in	the	Pine	Creek	Geosyncline	is	commonly	associated	with	granite	intrusions	and	occurred	
after	the	main	intrusive	event,	the	intrusion	of	the	Cullen	Batholith.	
	
The	most	important	regional‐scale	exploration	vectors	to	the	orogenic	style	of	gold	mineralization	are:

 The	position	of	the	biotite	isograd	in	the	contact‐metamorphic	aureole	of	the	Cullen	granitoids.	The	biotite	
isograd	needs	to	be	mapped	out	carefully	in	areas	of	exploration	interest	and	exploration	focused	on	the	
biotite‐albite	epidote	contact‐metamorphic	zone	

	
 NNW‐NW	 oriented	 anticlinal	 axes	 appear	 to	 be	 the	 most	 productive.	 However,	 exploration	 cannot	 be	

totally	restricted	to	anticlines	in	this	orientation,	as	other	anticlines	or	even	synclines	may	be	mineralized	
	
 Strongly	interbedded	and	contrasting	rock	types	(e.g.,	greywacke‐siltstone)	particularly	in	the	upper	parts	

of	the	stratigraphy	in	the	Mount	Bonnie	and	Burrell	Creek	Formations	in	particular	
	
 Carbonaceous	or	 iron‐rich	lithologies	 in	proximity	to	 indications	of	gold	mineralization.	Such	lithologies	

and	any	veins	within	them	need	to	be	mapped	out	carefully	to	help	locate	potential	trap	sites	for	economic	
gold	mineralization.		

	
Regional	 structural	 interpretation	 has	 identified	 favourable	 mineralized	 structural	 corridors	 within	 the	 15km	
wide	contact	aureole	around	the	Cullen	Batholith	(Figures	21.1).

analysis	of	the	regional	magnetic	image	(Figure	19‐1)	shows	that	there	are	other	similar	structural	settings,	some	
of	which	have	some	evidence	of	gold	mineralization.	
	
Despite	the	long	history	of	gold	mining	within	the	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	there	was	no	evidence	of	a	
comprehensive	regional	exploration	compilation.	This	is	likely	due	to	the	previously	fragmented	ownership	of	the	
properties.	
	
Over	90%	of	Crocodile	Gold's	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	 is	held	 in	 some	 form	of	Exploration	License.	
Annual	 exploration	 expenditure	 commitment	 is	 approximately	 $A1.3million	 and	 annual	 property	 rent	 is	
$A350,000.		
	
Further	 evaluation	 of	 the	 regional	 potential	 of	 the	Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	will	 likely	 result	 in	 the	
continued	discovery	and	definition	of	additional	economic	gold	mineralization.

19.2 	BURNSIDE 	GOLD 	&	BASE 	METALS 	PROJECT	

	

19.2.1 	COSMO	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
The	 current	 resource	 estimate	 is	 based	 on	 a	 significant	 diamond	 drilling	 database	 that	 combines	 information	
from	exploration	campaigns.	
	
The	main	Eastern	and	Western	Lodes	are	still	open	at	depth	and	generally	have	been	drilled	on	a	widely	spaced	
drill	pattern,	as	evidenced	by	40%	of	the	mineral	resource	in	the	Inferred	Mineral	Resource	category.	Additional	
deep	 drilling	 would	 evaluate	 the	 greater	 potential	 of	 the	 deposit	 and	 substantial	 infill	 drilling	 would	 likely	
increase	 the	 mineral	 resource	 classification	 and	 allow	 more	 Mineral	 Resources	 to	 be	 converted	 to	 Mineral	
Reserves.		
	
Several	 reviews	 of	 the	 geology	 and	 resource	 expansion	 potential	 prepared	 by	 past	 operators	 have	 identified	
several	prospective	target	areas	(Sheehan,	2009):	
	

 Shallow	 lodes	 ‐	 south‐western	corner	of	Cosmo	Pit	–	Geological	mapping	of	 the	south‐western	pit	wall	
indicates	that	there	may	be	an	uplift	of	the	structure	in	this	area,	possibly	lifting	mineralized	structures	
towards	the	surface.	This	area	has	never	been	drilled	and	represents	a	reasonable	target	to	locate	near	
surface	mineralization	which	could	be	mined	by	a	small	pit	push‐back,	even	in	the	current	situation	with	
the	water	in	the	pit,	as	this	area	is	above	current	water	levels.	
	

 Eastern	Lodes	 ‐	The	Eastern	Lodes	are	open–ended	down‐dip	and	along	 strike	 to	 the	north,	providing	
good	potential	for	substantial	resource	increases.	
	

 Western	 Lodes	 –	 Drill	 intercepts	 of	 the	 Western	 Lodes,	 which	 are	 relatively	 under‐explored,	 have	
returned	 encouraging	 grades	 and	 true	widths	 similar	 to	 those	 returned	 from	 the	 Eastern	 Lodes.	 	 The	
western	Lodes	are	open	at	depth,	 in	some	cases	not	too	far	below	the	current	open	pit.	Deeper	drilling	
has	 intersected	 the	 Main	 Lode	 where	 the	 plunge	 of	 the	 lode	 appears	 to	 change,	 at	 a	 depth	 of	
approximately	700m	vertical;	however,	it	is	uncertain	if	this	change	in	plunge	affects	the	strike	continuity	
and	potential	mine	drive	lengths.	

	
Figure	19‐3	and	Figure	19‐4	illustrate	long‐sections	of	the	East	and	West	Lodes	respectively	of	the	Cosmo	deposit.		
Figure	19‐5	displays	the	respective	lodes	in	plan	view,	with	2010	drilling	traces.

19.2.2 	COSMO‐HOWLEY	GOLD	CORRIDOR	("HOWLEY	PIT")	

	
The	Howley	gold	deposit	is	located	about	2km	northwest	of	the	historical	Cosmo	Open	Pit	Mine	in	an	area	where	
gold	mineralization	 is	developed	in	both	the	hinge	zone	and	steeply	dipping	flanks	of	a	shallow	north‐plunging	
anticline	 within	 rocks	 belonging	 to	 the	 Proterozoic	 Gerowie	 Tuff	 Formation	 Gold	mineralization	 extends	 in	 a	
northwesterly	trending	corridor	for	over	5km,	encompassing	the	Howley	mines	and	open	pits	(Figure	19‐6).

FIGURE	19‐6		HOWLEY	TREND	GEOLOGY	FROM	AHMAD	ET	AL	2009.	

	
Past	 operators	 recognized	 that	 each	 discrete	 deposit	 forms	 part	 of	 a	 larger,	 potentially	 continuous	 geological	
model	 and	 gold	 mineralized	 system.	 Furthermore,	 they	 interpreted	 that	 these	 near	 surface	 deposits	 may	 be	
indicative	of	more	robust	gold	mineralization	at	depth.		
	
The	greatest	potential	for	finding	new	mineralized	structures	in	the	Howley	trend	is	to	the	North	of	the	previously	
mined	Big	Howley	Pit.	Limited	drilling	exists	in	this	area	and	with	minimal	cost	this	area	could	be	evaluated	and	
drilled	to	find	more	mineralized	material.	Several	phases	of	wide	spaced	drilling	have	identified	potential	targets	
along	the	Howley	trend	and	these	need	further	follow‐up	work.	
	
In	summary,	the	Cosmo‐Howley	corridor	is	arguably	one	of	the	most	prospective	areas	for	gold	in	the	Pine	Creek	
Geosyncline.	During	 2010	Crocodile	 Gold	 has	 conducted	 significant	 drilling	 in	 and	 around	 the	Howley	pits	with	
some	success.	The	focus	for	2011	will	be	to	extend	this	to	the	North	of	the	Big	Howley	pit	and	further	north	to	the	
Bridge	 Creek	 deposit.	 Only	 limited	 drilling	 will	 be	 planned	 in	 and	 around	 the	 Howley	 pit,	 this	 drilling	 will	 be	
completed	by	the	mining	team	as	required.	It	is	believed	that	sufficient	drilling	has	been	completed	in	the	Howley	
mining	 area	 for	 now	 until	 mining	 advances	 further,	 therefore	 any	 extension	 drilling	 can	 be	 conducted	 by	 the	
mining	resource	team	as	required.

19.2.3 	NORTH	POINT	AND	PRINCESS	LOUISE	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

	
These	deposits	occasionally	referred	to	in	various	references	as	the	"Yam	Creek	Deposits"	are	located	within	a	
zone	 of	 compressive	 stress	 southeast	 of	 the	 Cullen	 Granite	 intrusion	 (Figure	 19‐7	 below).	 As	 such,	 gold	
mineralization	 within	 these	 deposits	 is	 commonly	 associated	 with	 steeply	 dipping	 quartz‐sulphide	 (pyrite‐
arsenopyrite)	 veins	 within	 sheared	 and	 brecciated	 zones	 related	 to	 antiformal	 structures.	 They	 represent	
potential	 targets	 for	modest	 grade	 (1.5‐2.5	 g/t	Au)	deposits	 of	 20,000‐50,000	oz	 of	 gold.	 Persistent,	mappable	
higher	grade	veins	with	values	of	10‐20g/t	Au	may	enrich	lower	grade	material.	
	
During	 2010	 a	 small	 test	 pit	was	mined	 at	 Princess	 Louise	 to	 assist	with	 the	 resource	modeling.	 Close	 spaced	
drilling	from	surface	identified	good	intersection	of	mineralization	which	warranted	further	work.	During	mining	
these	 high	 grade	 zones	were	 identified	 as	 en‐echelon	 style	 quartz	 veins	 of	 higher	 grade	mineralization,	 these	
veins	were	located	within	the	general	structural	trend	of	the	greywacke.		
	
After	a	site	visit	a	small	adit	was	found	near	Princess	Louise	which	confirmed	the	nature	of	the	higher	grade	veins	
as	it	was	mined	sub‐parallel	to	the	veins	in	the	pit.	With	different	orientation	on	drilling	it	may	be	possible	to	test	
the	continuity	of	these	veins	as	a	potential	small	scale	underground	target.	
	
The	other	area	requiring	further	work	is	around	the	historical	Yam	Creek	pit	which	lies	to	the	south	of	the	current	
North	Point	pit	and	to	the	North	of	Princess	Louise.	Historical	mining	from	this	area	highlights	the	potential	for	
further	excavations;	this	area	has	historical	drilling	which	needs	to	be	reviewed.

Both	pits	formed	part	of	the	open	pit	operations	operated	by	GBS,	these	two	pits	were	mined	to	full	depth	and	still	
have	potential	for	future	mining.	At	this	stage	Tally	Ho	is	an	underground	target	with	Fountain	Head	more	of	an	
open	pit	target.	Only	limited	drilling	exists	below	Tally	Ho	so	future	assessment	drilling	would	be	required.	
	
This	is	particularly	the	case	for	the	higher	grade	Tally	Ho	and	Princess	Louise	veins	(Figure	19‐7).	Visible	gold	has	
been	identified	at	both	of	these	targets.

19.2.5 	PAQUALIN	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

	
The	Paqualin	group	of	deposits,	which	includes	the	Kazi,	Bon's	Rush,	Bridge	Creek	and	Western	Arm	Deposits,	
is	within	a	northerly	trending	zone	of	mineralization	to	the	west	of	the	Cullen	Granite	intrusion.	Mineralization	is	
hosted	within	the	Howley	Anticline,	forming	classic	saddle‐reef	style	mineralization.	
	
Although	Mineral	Resources	are	defined	 for	 these	deposits,	 little	work	has	been	done	on	 these	zones	 in	 recent	
years.	Like	many	of	the	deposits	within	Crocodile	Gold's	inventory,	they	all	appear	to	be	open	along	strike	and	at	
depth	 and	 require	 additional	 drilling.	 Interpreted	 supergene	 mineralization	 at	 Bon's	 Rush	 might	 make	 an	
attractive	target	for	low	strip	ratio	mining.	It	is	planned	in	2011	to	"modernize"	these	deposits	with	confirmatory	
drilling	and	re‐modeling.	This	work	should	commence	in	Quarter	2.	
	
Future	work	 on	 deposits	 such	 as	 Bon's	 Rush	 is	 required	 as	 they	 have	 had	 only	 limited	 drilling.	With	minimal	
drilling	 these	 deposits	 could	 be	 up‐graded	 to	 at	 least	 Indicated	 Resources	 and	 then	 brought	 into	 the	 Reserve	
statement.	This	process	is	essential	in	the	next	12	months	as	they	will	need	to	be	included	in	future	mine	planning	
due	to	the	time	taken	for	approvals	through	the	current	MMP	process.	
	

19.3 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
Saddle‐reef	style	mineralization	in	historical	gold	mines	in	the	Pine	Creek	area	is	located	within	several	massive	
silt	beds	on	the	east	and	west	limbs	and	within	the	fractured	and	brecciated	nose	of	a	broad	regional	antiform.	An	
infill	RC	drill	program	was	completed	at	 the	Czarina	and	South	Enterprise	deposits	 in	 late	2004.	 	The	program	
revealed	that	the	Czarina	gold	mineralization	continued	at	depth	below	the	base	of	the	Czarina	open	pit	and	that	
there	was	significant	scope	to	extend	the	defined	resources	at	South	Enterprise.	Limited	exploration	is	required	at	
this	stage	at	Pine	Creek	with	several	of	these	deposits	now	forming	part	of	the	Company's	Mineral	Reserve	base.	
There	 is	 potential	 for	 high	 grade	 underground	 potential	 at	 places	 such	 as	North	 Gandy's	which	 is	 a	 shallowly	
plunging	high	grade	shoot	style	deposit,	only	limited	drilling	at	depth	exists	and	most	pits	are	still	open	at	depth.	
	
There	 also	 exists	 hundreds	 of	 past	workings	 around	 the	 township	 of	 Pine	 Creek	 highlighting	 the	 potential	 for	
finding	new	deposits	yet	to	be	identified.	Some	historical	drilling	outside	current	resources	and	reserves	has	had	
significant	 mineralization	 identified	 which	 will	 require	 follow	 up	 drilling.	 These	 areas,	 such	 as	 Bashi	 Bazook	
which	lies	to	the	west	of	the	Kohinoor	deposit,	require	further	testing	with	drilling.	
	

19.4 	UNION	REEF	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

	
Crocodile	 Gold	 has	 determined	 that	 there	 is	 significant	 potential	 in	 the	 immediate	 vicinity	 of	 the	 Union	 Reef	
Deposits	 to	 expand	 resources.	 Longitudinal	 sections	 of	 the	 Lady	 Alice	 and	 Prospect	 Deposits	 indicates	 a	
significant	number	of	higher	grade	drill	intercepts.	Additional	interpretive	work	coupled	with	additional	drilling	
is	 required	 to	 determine	 if	 additional	 resources	 can	 be	modeled.	 The	 figures	 below	 display	 the	 areas	 at	 both	
deposits	that	require	additional	work	based	on	past	drilling	results.

Due	 to	 the	 proximity	 to	 the	 Union	 Reefs	 processing	 plant	 the	 economic	 restrictions	 on	 mining	 activities	 is	
considerably	less	than	those	for	other	deposits	at	further	distances.	Ore	could	be	mined	directly	to	the	plant,	thus	
resulting	in	reduced	mining	costs.	
	
The	Union	Reefs	area	also	has	limited	deeper	drilling	beneath	previously	mined	pits.	This	opens	the	potential	for	
both	open	pit	and	underground	targets.	Figure	19‐10	shows	the	extent	of	the	mineralization	left	in	the	highway	in	
the	north	of	Crosscourse	pit,	and	grades	indicate	potential	for	underground	mine	targets.	This	area	is	one	of	the

highest	ranked	deposits	due	to	its	location,	the	fact	it	is	on	a	granted	mining	lease	and	the	fact	only	limited	drilling	
exists	and	most	deposits	are	open	at	depth.

19.5 	MAUD	CREEK	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
The	Maud	Creek	Gold	Deposit	 represents	a	 significant	component	of	 the	overall	 resource	base	of	 the	Northern	
Territory	 Gold	 Properties;	 however,	 there	 has	 been	 little	 recent	work	 reported	 on	 the	 property	 and	 no	work	
completed	since	2005.	
	
Analysis	 of	 various	 sections,	 available	 for	 review,	 indicates	 there	 is	 significant	 upside	 exploration	 potential;	
various	reports	 indicate	 there	 is	a	small	quantity	of	remnant	oxide	mineralization	remaining	at	 the	base	of	 the	
existing	 open	 pit	 mined	 in	 2000	 and	 that	 there	 is	 potential	 to	 discover	 additional	 oxide	mineralization	 along	
strike	to	the	north	where	historical	drilling	defined	a	+800m	strike	length	of	similar	style	mineralization,	albeit	at	
a	lower	grade	and	width	than	within	the	historical	open	pit.	
	
The	current	resource	model	was	prepared	using	a	1g/t	Au	cut‐off,	which	is	considered	high	considering	current	
open	pit	gold	prices	and	mining	practices,	however	there	are	some	thoughts	that	Maud	Creek	may	be	more	suited	
to	underground	mining,	therefore	this	higher	cut‐off	grade	may	be	appropriate.		Analysis	of	the	existing	resource

model	indicates	past	operators	identified	a	core	area	within	the	resource	which	has	grades	in	excess	of	4.5g/t	Au.	
This	work	has	also	 identified	possible	high	grade	 shoots	within	 the	 current	 resource	model	which	are	open	at	
depth	 and	 has	 also	 identified	 a	 shallow	 position	 where	 there	 is	 potential	 for	 a	 similar	 high	 grade	 shoot	 at	 a	
shallower	position.	Mineralization	is	known	to	be	open	at	depth,	with	several	thick,	modest	grade	intersections	
reported.	
	
Further	 detailed	 structural	 interpretation	 of	 historical	 drilling	 information	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 further	 refine	
these	targets	for	drilling.	
	
The	exploration	potential	of	the	balance	of	the	property	away	from	the	defined	resource	has	not	been	adequately	
assessed.	Geological	mapping	has	apparently	identified	a	large	breccia	zone	in	a	similar	orientation	to	the	original	
discovery	 at	 the	 main	 Maud	 Creek	 deposit.	 	 There	 are	 other	 prospects	 identified	 at	 Chessman,	 O'Sheas	 and	
Runways	East.	Past	operators	had	recommended	a	3,500m	drilling	program,	but	due	to	the	location	of	the	area,	
this	is	a	lower	priority	deposit.	
	
A	review	of	 the	regional	geophysics	 is	also	required	at	Maud	Creek	 to	help	with	 the	 target	generation	of	other	
areas	on	the	lease	package.	This	should	be	completed	in	the	next	12	months	so	all	future	drilling	can	be	planned	
with	the	highest	possibility	of	success.	
	

19.6 	MOLINE 	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
Despite	some	small	scale	historical	gold	production	at	the	historical	Evelyn	(base	metals),	Hercules,	Moline	and	
Tumbling	Dice	mines,	 there	appears	 to	have	been	 little	modern	exploration	of	 this	project	group	and	 in	recent	
years	 it	 has	 not	 received	 much	 modern	 exploration	 attention.	 Conflicting	 reports	 indicate	 that	 GBS	 Gold	 did	
perform	 some	 exploration	 on	 the	 property,	 locating	 a	 large	 (8km)	 gold‐in‐soil	 geochemical	 anomaly	 and	
performed	some	diamond	drilling	to	test	beneath	the	Hercules	pit	and	at	the	High	Chinese	prospect,	apparently	
without	any	significant	gold	mineralization	reported.	
	
A	detailed	review	of	the	tenement	package	was	conducted	in	2005	by	Mattison	and	Orridge	which	highlights	the	
potential	 for	 both	 underground	 and	 open	 pit	 targets	 being	 developed.	 One	 of	 the	 main	 issues	 that	 disrupted	
previous	 mining	 activities	 was	 the	 potential	 for	 low	 recovery	 mineralization,	 with	 modern	 metallurgical	
approaches	and	 test	work	 this	problem	needs	 to	be	 re‐assessed.	There	 is	 a	 strong	possibility	 that	 these	 issues	
could	be	resolved	with	test	work	and	improved	processing	flow	sheets.	
	
There	 is	 an	 absence	 of	 reports	 of	 numerous	 gold	 and	base	metal	 occurrences	 on	 the	 property.	 Crocodile	Gold	
needs	 to	 dedicate	 some	 time	 and	 resources	 to	 a	 thorough	 review	 of	 all	 past	work.	 They	 also	 need	 to	 put	 the	
property	 into	 a	 sound	 geological	 context	 with	 respect	 to	 stratigraphy	 and	 structure.	 This	 can	 be	 partially	
accomplished	with	a	review	of	public	domain	geophysical	surveys	and	geological	maps.		
	

19.7 	MOUNT 	BUNDY	REGION	

	
There	 exist	 several	 known	 and	 noted	 exploration	 targets	 in	 the	 Mt	 Bundy	 region,	 namely	 the	 Zamu	 Dolerite	
deposit	 around	 the	 Quest	 29	 region.	 Significant	 drilling	 exists	 around	 this	 deposit	 which	 could	 be	 used	 in	
identifying	new	Resources.	These	could	be	significant	in	the	regional	sense	as	there	already	exists	a	mass	tonnage	
deposit	 (Mt	Bundy)	 and	high	grade	 (Tom's	Gully)	deposit	nearby.	This	with	 the	potential	 at	 the	Quest	29	area	
could	be	packaged	into	a	successful	mining	district.	This	could	be	done	with	limited	confirmatory	drilling.

19.8 	BASE 	METALS 	PROJECT	

	
Regionally	and	within	the	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	there	has	been	significant	base	metal	production,	
primarily	gold	±silver	rich	zinc‐lead‐(copper)	ore.	During	2008,	as	a	result	of	a	joint	venture	alliance	formed	with	
J.P.	 Morgan,	 GBS	 Gold	 expended	 a	 substantial	 portion	 of	 their	 regional	 exploration	 budget	 on	 base	 metal	
exploration,	particularly	at	the	Iron	Blow	and	Mount	Bonnie	Projects.	
	
Gold‐silver	rich	stratabound	zinc	mineralization	intersected	at	both	prospects	remains	open	at	depth	and	locally	
both	 properties	 have	 substantial	 exploration	 potential.	 The	 Evelyn	 deposit	 in	 the	 Moline	 area	 needs	 further	
investigation.	
	

19.9 	MINERAL	RESOURCES 	–	MINERAL	RESERVES	

	
From	an	analysis	and	review	of	various	geological	data,	tabulations,	reports	and	presentations,	the	Authors	are	
confident	that	recent	work	completed	by	Crocodile	Gold	which	forms	the	basis	for	Mineral	Resource	and	Mineral	
Reserve	estimations	contained	within	this	report	has	been	completed	in	a	diligent,	professional	manner,	following	
established	QAQC	protocols	and	taking	into	consideration	and	following	"industry	best	practice"	procedures.			
	
This	report	includes	updated	Mineral	Resource	and	Mineral	Reserve	estimations	(Section	17).	
	
A	continued	review	of	mining	activities	 through	reconciliation	with	the	mill	will	enable	 	 the	accuracy	of	all	 the	
Mineral	Resource	 and	Reserve	 estimations	 to	 be	 improved	 continually.	 	 This	will	 allow	 the	potential	 for	more	
Inferred	Resources	to	be	upgraded	to	higher	resource	categories	as	many	of	the	mineralized	systems	are	similar	
to	 those	 currently	 being	mined.	 It	 is	 also	 important	 that	 this	 technical	 report	 is	 up‐dated	 regularly	 to	 ensure	
accuracy,	this	will	also	include	depletion	from	mining.	This	process	will	also	allow	for	the	Mineral	Resources	and	
Mineral	Reserves	to	be	economically	reviewed	on	a	regular	basis.	
	
A	 substantial	portion	of	 the	 total	mineral	 resources	 remain	 in	 the	 Inferred	Mineral	Resource	 classification	and	
only	a	small	portion	of	the	total	mineral	resource	base	is	currently	classified	as	Mineral	Reserves.	Conversion	of	
Mineral	 Resources	 to	Mineral	 Reserves	 is	 not	 a	 certainty;	 however,	 it	would	 appear	 that,	 in	most	 cases,	 good	
geological	 continuity	 exists	 and	 establishment	 of	 additional	 Mineral	 Reserves	 is	 largely	 dependent	 on	 more	
closely	spaced	infill	drilling	of	Mineral	Resources.	

19.10 	DEVELOPMENT	&	OPERATIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS

19.11 	RECOMMENDATIONS	

	
The	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	of	Crocodile	Gold	 comprise	 a	 large	 tenement	package	with	 substantial	
historical	 gold	 production,	 defined	Mineral	 Resources	 in	 33	 gold	 deposits	 and	Mineral	 Reserves	 in	 a	 partially	
developed	underground	gold	mine	(Cosmo),	a	fully	operational	underground	mine	(Brocks	Creek)	and	four	open	
pit	mines	(Howley,	Mottrams,	Princess	Louise	and	North	Point),	plus	five	additional	deposits	in	and	around	Pine	
Creek	(Kohinoor,	Cox,	International,	Gandy's	and	South	Enterprise).	
	
The	Properties	have	demonstrated	exploration	potential,	both	to	expand	the	existing	resources/reserves	and	to	
locate	 new	 gold	 mineralization.	 The	 key	 to	 unlocking	 this	 potential	 is	 increased	 exploration	 and	 resource	
definition	 drilling.	 A	 three	 year	 Exploration	 Program	&	 Budget	 of	 $A30	Million	 is	 recommended.	 This	 budget	
should	be	considered	a	minimum;	as	additional	targets	are	developed	and	funds	become	available	this	budget	and	
program	can	be	expanded.	
	
The	immediate	focus	for	Crocodile	Gold	is	to	get	the	Cosmo	underground	mine	into	production	while	at	the	same	
time	keep	the	Union	Reef	Mill	 fed	with	ore	 from	open	pit	operations.	Full	production	at	Cosmo	is	projected	for	
2012.	
	
Additional	 resources	 for	 the	next	 few	years	are	projected	 to	come	 from	Howley,	 	Princess	Louise,	North	Point,	
International,	Mottrams,	 Brocks	 Creek,	 Cosmo	Deeps	 and	 Gandy's,	 these	 deposits	 are	 currently	 in	 the	Mineral	
Reserve	 Statement,	 future	work	 is	 required	 to	 increase	 the	 number	 of	 potential	 ore	 sources	 as	 this	 gives	 the	
Company	alternatives	during	the	wet	season.	
	
Priority	 for	 definition	drilling	 over	 the	 next	 few	 years	 should	 be	 confined	 to	 the	Burnside	Project,	 Pine	Creek,	
Union	Reef	and	Moline	Area	as	these	ore	sources	are	the	closest	to	the	operating	mill	at	Union	Reefs.		
	
Ongoing	detailed	compilation	of	all	historical	and	recent	data	is	essential	prior	to	formalizing	specific	drill	collar	
locations.	 All	 databases	 require	 auditing	 for	 completeness	 against	 historical	 "hardcopy"	 records	 and	 previous	
assessment	 reports.	 As	 required,	 new	 plans	 and	 sections	 should	 be	 prepared	 and	 local,	 project‐scale	 GIS	
platforms	must	be	created	to	compile	and	allow	interpretation	of	the	data.	Although	time	consuming,	these	low	
cost	items	have	the	potential	to	identify	new	targets,	change	current	interpretations	and	possibly	save	valuable	
drilling	funds	by	optimizing	drill	hole	locations.	
	
The	Properties	comprise	a	very	large	area	with	substantial	historical	gold	production	but	only	limited	conceptual	
regional	 exploration	 has	 ever	 been	 completed.	 Nevertheless,	 there	 are	 a	 number	 of	 already	 defined	 regional	
targets	 which	 require	 follow‐up	 investigation.	 Interpretative	 analysis	 of	 the	 existing	 database	 has	 and	 will	
continue	to	result	in	additional	regional	targets	being	identified.	These	targets	will	require	geological	evaluation	
followed	by	geochemical	or	geophysical	surveys	and	reconnaissance	drilling.	Any	anomalies	will	require	follow‐
up	RC	or	diamond	drilling.		
	
Many	of	the	known	gold	deposits	included	within	defined	Mineral	Resources	or	Mineral	Reserves	have	significant	
potential	to	be	expanded	and	the	overall	gold	inventory	will	likely	be	increased.	All	Mineral	Resource	and	Mineral	
Reserve	areas	are	considerably	under‐drilled	and	the	recommended	program	below	includes	substantial	infill	RC	
and	diamond	drilling.	
	
Drilling	of	near‐term	production	targets	at	Cosmo	will	increase	the	level	of	confidence	of	Mineral	Resources	and	
should	 quickly	 increase	 the	 Mineral	 Reserves	 for	 this	 project.	 The	 same	 can	 be	 said	 for	 the	 Lady	 Alice	 and	
Prospect	Claim	deposits	in	the	Union	Reef	Area

An	analysis	of	mining	by	past	operators	has	contributed	to	a	better	understanding	of	the	geology	of	the	deposits	
and	 aided	 considerably	 in	 the	 confirmation,	 and	 in	 some	 cases,	 reinterpretation	 of	 these	 ore	 bodies	 and	
estimation	of	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	Reserves.	
	
Experience	 gained	 from	 current	 and	 past	 mining	 operations	 has	 resulted	 in	 recommendations	 for	 changes	 in	
mining	practices	which	have	been	incorporated	in	the	preparation	of	the	Mineral	Reserve	estimations	included	
within	this	report.		
	
Evaluation	of	the	historical	development	plan	of	past	operators	has	also	identified	several	areas	where	changes	in	
development	 or	 management	 strategies	 could	 potentially	 improve	 the	 economics	 of	 existing	 mines	 or	 future	
development	projects.		
	
A	 prioritization	 of	 target	 areas	 for	 definition	 drilling	 needs	 to	 be	 formulated.	 Mining	 leases	 should	 take	
precedence	 over	 exploration	 leases,	 Open	 pit	 oxide	 resources	 of	 significance	 should	 take	 precedence	 over	
underground	 resources,	 non‐refractory	 resources	 should	 be	 targeted	 as	 refractory	 ores	 will	 require	 costly	
processing	equipment	and	long	time	lines.	The	distance	to	the	Union	mill	from	any	deposit	considered	for	mining	
also	needs	to	be	taken	into	account.		
	

19.12 	REGIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS	

	
Crocodile	 Gold's	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 contain	 a	 large	 number	 of	 significant	 historical	 gold	
occurrences	 including	 existing	 deposits	 with	 defined	 Mineral	 Resources	 and	 Mineral	 Reserves,	 and	 many	
prospects	and	deposits	with	extremely	good	potential	 for	expansion	of	existing	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	
Reserves.		
	
Much	 of	 the	 Property	 away	 from	 the	 defined	 deposits	 has	 had	 minimal	 exploration	 and	 the	 potential	 of	 the	
remainder	 of	 the	 Property	 has	 not	 been	 adequately	 evaluated.	 This	 should	 be	 done	with	 a	 detailed	 review	 of	
regional	geophysical	data	and	geochemical	sampling.	Work	needs	to	be	done	on	this	to	assist	with	regional	target	
generation.	
	
It	 is	 recommended	 that	 the	broader	exploration	potential	 of	 the	Property	be	evaluated	 to	 further	 enhance	 the	
mineral	potential	and	value	of	the	Property	and	Crocodile	Gold's	assets	through	discovery	of	significant	new	gold	
deposits.	Ten	percent	of	any	annual	exploration	budget	should	go	towards	"greenfields"	exploration.	
	
The	following	exploration	program	is	recommended:	
	

I	 Data	Compilation	&	Re‐assessment	
	

(i) Audit	existing	database	
(ii) 						Create	GIS‐based	compilation	&	interpretation	
(iii) Complete	 a	 regional	 scale	 geological	 and	 structural	 interpretation	 using	 available	 geological	

mapping	 and	 regional	 geophysical	 surveys.	 The	 ultimate	 objective	 of	 this	 task	 is	 to	 produce	 an	
interpreted	geological	map	 from	all	 available	geology	maps.	Geophysical	data	should	be	used	 to	
extrapolate	 known	 geology	 into	 areas	 that	 are	 unmapped	 or	 overburden	 covered.	 Plotting	 all	
known	deposits	on	the	final	product	geology	and	geophysical	maps	should	provide	valuable	clues	
as	 to	 controlling	 structures	 and	 favourable	 geology	 with	 respect	 to	 significant	 mineralization.

Previously	 unknown	 deposits	 and	 extensions	 of	 known	 deposits	 should	 materialize	 from	 this	
exercise.	

(iv) Develop	 an	 appropriate	 follow‐up	 field	 evaluation	 program	 which	 should	 include	 geological	
mapping,	appropriate	geophysical	surveys	and	geochemical	work.	

	

II	 Monitor	regional	exploration	activities	of	Thundelarra	and	Rum	Jungle	Uranium	
‐ 	

	
III	Consider	participation	in	NTGS	"Bringing	Forward	Discovery"	Geoscience	Programs,	particularly:	

‐ The	Geophysics	&	Drilling	Collaborations	program	to	fund	regional,	possibly	multi‐client‐style	
airborne	magnetic	and	radiometric	mapping	programs.	

	

IV	 Regional	Reconnaissance	Drilling	and	sampling	(30,000m	RAB;	5,000m	RC;	5,000m	diamond)	
‐ Provision	is	made	for	30,000m	of	RAB	drilling	to	test	geological,	structural,	geophysical	or	

geochemical	anomalies	
‐ Provision	is	also	made	to	follow‐up	anomalous	RAB	results	with	initial	RC	drill	testing	
‐ Regional	diamond	drilling	to	be	used	to	help	identify	structural	controls	on	mineralization	

on	newly	discovered	areas.	
‐ Investigate	suitable	regional	sampling	techniques	for	the	use	in	and	around	the	Burnside	

area,	particularly	the	area	to	the	north	of	the	Burnside	Granite	
	

19.13 	BURNSIDE 	GOLD 	&	BASE 	METALS 	PROJECT	

	
All	databases	require	auditing	 for	completeness	against	historical	 "hardcopy"	records	and	previous	assessment	
reports.	As	required,	new	plans	and	sections	should	be	prepared	and	a	local,	project‐scale	GIS	platform	should	be	
created	to	compile	and	allow	interpretation	of	the	data.	
	
Several	 reviews	 of	 the	 potential	 for	 further	 base	metal	 discoveries	 have	 been	 tabled	 over	 the	 years.	 All	 have	
highlighted	potential	future	targets.	These	are	also	noted	in	the	freely	available	MoDAT	database	which	includes	a	
list	 of	 all	 known	deposits	 in	 the	Northern	Territory.	This	 is	 an	 invaluable	dataset	 to	 assist	with	 future	deposit	
targeting.	The	dataset	also	highlights	pre	and	post	war	small	scale	base	metal	mines	which	are	located	throughout	
the	Company's	tenement	package.	

19.14 	COSMO	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	
The	Cosmo	Gold	Deposit	represents	a	significant	component	of	 the	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	Reserves	of	
Crocodile	Gold's	assets	and	near	term	future	mining	strategy.		
	
While	 development	 of	 the	 deposit	 is	 underway,	 a	 thorough	 review	 of	 the	 geology,	 historical	 drilling	 and	
interpretations	and	a	re‐assessment	of	the	mineral	resource	is	required	to	familiarize	geological	and	mining	staff	
with	the	deposit,	to	identify,	in	detail,	potential	opportunities	to	expand	and/or	improve	the	resource	and	to	plan	
further	drilling.

Additional	drilling,	over	and	above	that	already	completed	by	Crocodile	Gold,	should	be	used	to	upgrade	Inferred	
Mineral	Resources	to	Indicated	Mineral	Resources	and	to	add	additional	Inferred	Mineral	Resources.			
	
The	following	exploration	&	evaluation	program	is	recommended:	
	

1. Retain	 a	 structural	 geologist	 to	 examine	 all	 available	 geology	 from	past	mapping,	 present	 open	pit	 and	
underground	workings	and	drilling	in	order	to	either	confirm	the	present	structural	model	or	revise	it	to	
meet	new	interpretations.	

2. Systematically	 drill	 from	 surface	 and	 underground	 (once	 sufficient	workings	 are	 available)	 to	 increase	
confidence	in	the	resource	model	and	upgrade	resource	categories.	The	minimum	objective,	on	an	annual	
basis,	is	to	replace	mined	resources.	

3. Determine	the	depth	extent	of	the	Eastern	lodes.	Extensive,	systematic	drilling	will	be	required	
4. Determine	if	the	Western	lodes	provide	sufficient	grade	and	tonnes	to	be	mined	and	add	significantly	to	

the	resource	base.	Extensive	systematic	drilling	will	be	required.	
5. Assess	the	potential	through	underground	drilling	of	the	newly	identified	Phantom	lode	which	sits	in	the	

core	of	the	Cosmo	fold	hinge.	
6. Use	 the	mine	 development	 diamond	 drill	 rig	 to	 drill	 exploration	 holes	 as	 this	will	 greatly	 improve	 the	

angle	of	intersection	of	the	mineralization,	as	well	as	reducing	the	drilling	costs	when	compared	to	drilling	
from	surface.	

	

19.15 	HOWLEY	TREND	

	
Mapping	and	sampling	are	required	to	the	north	of	the	existing	Big	Howley	deposit	along	the	extensive	Howley	
trend.	Several	current	Mineral	Resource	exist	along	this	trend	however	only	limited	drilling	has	been	identified	
between	some	of	these	deposits.	On	a	quick	review	there	are	zones	of	higher	grade	intersections	that	will	require	
follow	up	assessment	and	possibly	drilling.	
	
The	overall	trend	is	some	25	kilometers	in	length	and	is	easily	identified	in	the	regional	geophysics;	there	are	3	
current	 resources	 and	 3	 historical	 resources	 located	 on	 this	 trend	 with	 potential	 for	 further	 discoveries.	 A	
thorough	review	of	the	regional	geophysical	dataset,	which	includes	a	close	spaced	AeroMagnetic	dataset	for	the	
Howley	trend,	needs	to	be	completed	 in	 the	coming	year.	This	will	assist	with	 identifying	new	deposits	on	this	
trend.	
	

19.16 	NORTH	POINT	AND	PRINCESS 	LOUISE 	GOLD 	DEPOSITS	

	
Significant	drilling	has	been	completed	on	these	deposits	over	the	past	12	months;	these	deposits	have	also	been	
a	key	part	of	 the	mining	activities	of	Crocodile	Gold	 in	 this	period.	While	 they	can	only	be	accessed	 in	 the	dry	
months,	the	oxide	nature	of	the	ore	has	assisted	in	the	mill	recoveries.	

The	location	of	these	deposits	being	close	to	existing	infrastructure,	such	as	the	haul	road	to	the	Union	Reefs	
plant.	The	region	needs	to	be	thoroughly	reviewed	for	potential	mineralization	in	locations	such	as	Yam	Creek	
which	is	located	between	both	the	Princess	Louise	and	North	Point	deposits.	Crocodile	Gold	needs	to	continually	
mine	oxide	stocks	to	assist	with	overall	recovery	in	the	mill.		Currently	there	are	limited	oxide	ore	sources	within	
the	Mineral	Reserve	statement	and	the	focus	is	to	replace	these	already	mined	oxide	stocks	each	year.	This	will	
assist	with	target	generation	and	ranking	each	year.

19.17 	PAQUALIN	GOLD	DEPOSITS	

	
Past	operator's	evaluations	of	the	Kazi,	Bon's	Rush,	Bridge	Creek,	and	Western	Arm	deposits	were	limited	to	
review	of	historical	exploration	work	and	had	not	defined	definite	exploration	programs	for	these	targets.	Given	
most	 of	 the	 drilling	 is	 historical,	 a	 brief	 compilation	 program,	 including	 an	 audit	 of	 the	 existing	 database	 and	
preparation	of	a	GIS	compilation	and	interpretation	is	required	before	a	more	comprehensive	evaluation	program	
can	be	recommended.	
	
The	following	evaluation	program	is	recommended:	
	

I	 Data	Compilation	&	Re‐assessment	
	

(i) Audit	existing	database	
(ii) 						Create	GIS‐based	compilation	&	interpretation	
(iii) Prepare	detailed	follow‐up	program	
(iv) Initiate	an	exploration	program	that	would	assess	the	open	pit	and	underground	mining	potential	

of	the	area	
	
These	 deposits	 have	 significant	 size	 which	 warrants	 future	 work	 to	 be	 completed.	 Limited	 drilling	 has	 been	
completed	and	shows	the	mineralization	to	be	open	both	along	strike	and	at	depth.	Significant	potential	exists	to	
increase	the	size	of	 the	deposits	with	minimal	drilling.	These	deposits	are	close	 to	 infrastructure	and	would	 fit	
with	current	mining	activities	located	at	the	Howley	open	pit	deposit	
	

19.18 	PINE	CREEK	GOLD	PROJECT	

	
A	 detailed	 review	 of	 past	 drilling	 outside	 the	 known	 Mineral	 Resources	 is	 required	 to	 assist	 with	 target	
generation.	Several	known	and	logged	historical	workings	exist	outside	the	Company's	Mineral	Resources,	these	
need	to	be	mapped	and	identified	to	assist	with	drill	planning	for	the	region.	This	is	a	low	priority	target	for	now	
until	mining	 activities	 begin	which	will	 assist	with	 the	process	 as	 a	mining	 team	will	 be	 able	 to	 help	with	 the	
activities	required	(such	as	surveying	and	field	recon).	Figure	19‐11	illustrates	the	current	exploration	targets	at	
Pine	Creek.

The	potential	for	underground	resources	needs	to	be	evaluated	beneath	a	number	of	the	open	pit	areas	including	
the	Lady	Alice	and	Prospect	Deposits	(Figure	19‐12).	A	combination	of	diamond	and	RC	drilling	is	recommended.	
Small	scale	high	grade	style	mineralization	is	one	of	the	high	ranked	target	types	and	from	the	historical	drilling	
targeting	 this	 type	 of	mineralization	 is	 a	 strong	 possibility.	 Pit	 cut‐backs	 are	 also	 possible	 as	 the	 past	mining	
activities	ceased	in	2003	and	since	then	there	has	been	a	significant	increase	in	gold	price.	This	economic	change	
may	make	it	possible	to	add	ounces	to	the	Reserve	Profile	close	to	the	mill.

The	Esmeralda	Deposit	also	requires	further	drill	testing	as	currently	the	Mineral	Resource	is	within	the	Inferred	
category.	Minimal	infill	drilling	would	be	required	to	increase	confidence	in	the	model	which	would	also	assist	in	
conversion	 to	Mineral	Reserves.	The	deposit	 is	 located	 approximately	6.5	 kilometers	 from	 the	Union	Reef	mill	
which	suggests	that	this	deposit	should	be	a	highly	ranked	target.

19.20 	MOUNT 	BUNDY	GOLD	PROJECT	

	

19.20.1 	TOM'S	GULLY	DEPOSIT	

	
Mining	at	Tom's	Gully	was	suspended	indefinitely	in	August	2010.	Detailed	muck	sampling	showed	that	ore	grades	
were	not	being	obtained	and	that	this	scenario	would	likely	continue	to	be	the	case	down‐dip	on	the	vein	where	
the	Odessa	and	the	2011	estimation	indicate	good	grades	with	a	high	degree	of	continuity.			
	
It	is	apparent	that	the	Tom's	Gully	deposit	is	not	economic	under	current	prices	and	utilizing	highly	dilutive	mining	
methods.		Dilution	and	metal	loss	are	high.		This	may	not	be	the	case	if	further	open	pit	or	underground	operations	
can	be	identified	in	the	region	to	supplement	the	ore	from	Toms	Gully.	This	should	be	the	regional	focus	for	the	Mt	
Bundy	project	as	packaging	all	these	deposits	together	will	assist	with	the	economic	viability	of	the	region.	
	
Crocodile	Gold	needs	to	focus	on	getting	the	Cosmo	Deposit	into	production	within	the	next	year.	Given	this	
priority	it	is	recommended	that	any	future	work	at	Mount	Bundy	be	put	on	hold	until	such	time	as	resources	in	
man	power	and	funding	are	available.	
	
The	following	evaluation	program	is	recommended:	
	

I	 Data	Compilation	&	Re‐assessment	
	
Audit	existing	database	

	 (ii)	 Create	GIS‐based	compilation	&	interpretation	
(i) Detailed	structural	re‐logging	of	existing	diamond	drill	core	
(ii) Review	any	available	trace	element	data,	particularly	As	and	Cu,	in	an	attempt	to	define	possible	

vectors	to	mineralization	in	the	vicinity	of	the	Crabb	and	Williams	Faults	(See	Sheppard,	1994)	

	

19.20.2 	MOUNT	BUNDY	DEPOSIT	

	
The	Mount	Bundy	deposit	represents	a	significant	asset	within	Crocodile	Gold's	property	portfolio.	A	refurbished	
processing	facility	is	available	at	the	Tom's	Gully	deposit	site,	however	significant	up‐grading	of	these	facilities	
would	be	required	for	processing	of	the	ore	as	the	throughput	available	at	Tom's	Gully	is	significantly	lower	than	
would	be	required	for	Mount	Bundy	ore.	The	overall	property	situation	needs	to	be	re‐evaluated	with	the	aim	of	
future	development	and	mining	once	the	Cosmo	deposit	is	in	commercial	production.		
	
The	Mount	Bundy	property	represents	a	significant	land	position	which	should	be	part	of	any	future	large	scale	
exploration	effort.

19.20.3 	QUEST	29	PROSPECT	

	
Historical	drilling	around	Quest	29	is	almost	sufficient	to	establish	a	Mineral	Resource,	with	limited	confirmatory	
drilling	which	would	be	required	to	assist	with	the	confidence	with	historical	drilling.	With	this	included	in	the	Mt

(iii) Review	&	re‐assess	property	prospectivity

Metallurgical	work	would	indicate	that	any	milling	facility	that	processes	the	Maud	Creek	ore	will	need	a	flotation	
circuit.	 This	 being	 the	 case	 then	 Crocodile	 Gold	 should	 consider	 combining	 its	 base	metal	 deposits	 and	Maud

modeling	will	be	required	to	bring	mineralization	into	resource	categories.	 If	significant	tonnages	are	indicated	
then	scoping	and	prefeasibility	work	will	be	required.		
	
Unless	 this	 concept	 is	 farmed	out	 to	 another	party	 then	 it	 is	 envisaged	 that	Crocodile	Gold	will	 not	 be	 able	 to	
tackle	this	work	for	several	years.	Required	resources	in	the	form	of	manpower	and	funding	will	be	significant	to	
tackle	such	a	 large	scale	project.	The	Company	should	be	aiming	 for	a	minimum	of	10	million	resource	 tonnes	
from	various	sources	to	make	this	project	attractive.	
	

19.22 	MOLINE 	GOLD 	PROJECT	

	
The	prospectivity	 of	 this	 property	 is	 uncertain	 (Figure	 19‐14).	 Its	 large	 size	 and	proximity	 to	 the	Union	Reefs	
processing	plant	makes	a	re‐assessment	worthwhile.	
	
The	following	minimal	evaluation	program	is	recommended:	

I	 Data	Compilation	&	Re‐assessment	
	

(i)	 Audit	existing	database	
(ii)	 Create	GIS‐based	compilation	&	interpretation	
(iii) Review	&	re‐assess	property	prospectivity	
(iv) Assess	the	current	situation	in	terms	of	stockpile	material.	It	is	currently	believed	mined	material	

stockpile	may	exist	at	Moline	ready	for	haulage	and	milling.	
	
Both	the	gold	and	base	metal	prospectivity	of	the	area	needs	to	be	assessed	as	there	are	a	significant	number	of	
higher	grade	base	metal	intersections	identified	in	the	previous	drilling.

19.23 	BASE 	METALS 	PROJECT	

	

19.23.1 	IRON	BLOW,	MOUNT	BONNIE	AND	EVELYN	DEPOSITS	

	
Regionally	and	within	the	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties,	there	has	been	significant	base	metal	production,	
primarily	 gold	 ±silver	 rich	 zinc‐lead‐(copper)	 ore,	 and	 within	 Crocodile	 Gold	 properties,	 gold‐silver	 rich	
stratabound	zinc	mineralization	has	been	intersected	at	both	the	Iron	Blow	and	Mount	Bonnie	prospects	both	of	
which	remain	open	at	depth.	
	
Locally	 both	 the	 Iron	 Blow	 and	 Mount	 Bonnie	 properties	 have	 substantial	 exploration	 potential	 and	 the	
surrounding	host‐rock	 sequence	 is	 largely	unexplored.	 	An	exploration	program	 that	 includes	 soil	 geochemical	
sampling,	 geophysical	 surveys	 in	 the	 form	of	magnetometer	and	 IP/resistivity	 surveys	and	geological	mapping	
are	required.			High‐resolution	aeromagnetic	survey	data	is	available	for	the	area	and	this	need	to	be	manipulated	
to	maximize	its	usefulness	in	defining	underlying	geology.	Test	lines	of	airborne	EM	utilizing	the	Geotech	VTEM	
system	have	indicated	that	these	deposits	produce	good	EM	responses.	
Compilation	of	historical	drilling,	underground	workings	and	open	pits	needs	to	be	completed	and	modeled	for	
both	deposits.	
	
Additional	drilling	to	infill	the	2008	drilling	at	Iron	Blow	would	allow	for	Indicated	resources	to	be	categorized.	
Drilling	 at	Mount	 Bonnie	would	 confirm	 historical	 drilling	 and	 allow	 for	 Inferred	 resources	 to	 be	 categorized.	
Attention	to	any	remaining	near‐surface	oxide	and	supergene	zones	should	be	strongly	considered.	
	
The	 Evelyn	 base	metal	 deposit	 and	 similar	 geological	 environments	 need	 to	 be	 evaluated.	 If	 this	 deposit	 does	
occur	 at	 the	 base	 of	 the	 Koolpin	 Formation	 and	 is	 considered	 to	 be	 stratabound,	 then	 this	 opens	 up	 a	 huge	
potential	for	other	base	metal	deposits	in	the	area..	
	
There	 are	 indications	 that	 copper	mineralization	 (disseminated?)	 exists	 in	 the	Mount	 Bundy	 (associated	with	
uranium)	and	Maud	Creek	areas	associated	with	brecciation.	These	occurrences	need	further	investigation.	
	

19.24 	MINERAL	RESOURCES 	–	MINERAL	RESERVES	

	
Although	an	analysis	and	review	of	various	geological	data,	tabulations,	reports	and	presentations	has	concluded	
that	recent	work	completed	by	Crocodile	Gold	which	forms	the	basis	for	Mineral	Resource	and	Mineral	Reserve	
estimations	 contained	 within	 this	 report	 has	 been	 completed	 in	 a	 diligent,	 professional	 manner,	 following	
established	QAQC	protocols	and	taking	into	consideration	and	following	"industry	best	practice"	procedures,	the	
Author	makes	the	following	recommendations	for	future	considerations:	
	

 Documentation	
There	currently	exists	numerous		reports	on	the	potential	exploration	targets	for	the	Company's	tenement	
package,	which		need	to	be	assessed	and	digitized	for	future	reference.		
	

 QAQC	
The	existing	QAQC	procedures	need	to	be	comprehensively	documented.	A	thorough	study	was	conducted	
by	an	independent	consultant	on	the	QAQC	results	for	the	Crocodile	Gold	drilling.	This	process	identified

[341]	
	

some	 areas	 for	 improvement	 but	 no	 significant	 issues	 have	 been	 identified.	 The	 areas	 of	 improvement	
have	been	noted	and	will	be	continually	monitored	going	forward.	
	

 Updating	of	Previous	Resource	Estimations	
Current	 Mineral	 Resource	 and	Mineral	 Reserve	 estimations	 require	 updating	 as	 economic	 and	mining	
parameters	 change.	 This	 should	 be	 reviewed	 on	 an	 annual	 basis.	 Several	 historical	 resources	will	 also	
require	 complete	 re‐working	 with	 our	 current	 understanding	 of	 the	 geology	 and	 controls	 on	
mineralization.	This	will	assist	with	improving	the	future	reconciliation	of	these	models.	

	
 Updating	of	Current	Mining	Studies	

Current	 Feasibility	 and	mining	 studies	 and	 plans	 require	 updating	 as	 new	 information	 or	 economic	 or	
mining	 parameters	 change.	 This	 should	 be	 reviewed	 on	 an	 annual	 basis.	 This	 should	 also	 include	 the	
continued	reconciliation	of	production	with	resource	models	and	the	mill.	

	
There	 is	a	 requirement	 to	 increase	 the	 level	of	confidence	of	 the	existing	 Inferred	Mineral	Resources	such	 that	
these	 resources	 may	 be	 re‐classified	 as	 Indicated	 Mineral	 Resources	 and	 exploration	 drilling	 programs	 will	
address	this	requirement.	
	
There	is	also	a	requirement	to	complete	the	necessary	mining	and	economic	assessment	of	individual	Indicated	
Mineral	Resources	to	convert	these	resources	to	Mineral	Reserves.	
	

19.25 	DEVELOPMENT	&	OPERATIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS	

	
An	 analysis	 of	 mining	 operations	 over	 the	 first	 14	 months	 of	 Crocodile	 Gold	 has	 contributed	 to	 a	 better	
understanding	 of	 the	 geology	 of	 the	 deposits	 and	 aided	 considerably	 in	 the	 confirmation,	 and	 in	 some	 cases,	
reinterpretation	of	these	orebodies	and	estimation	of	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	Reserves.	

 A	high	proportion	of	the	gold	mineralization	in	the	Howley	area	is	less	than	1.4g/t.	
 Gold	mineralization	in	the	Tom's	Gully	orebody	is	of	a	variable	nature	with	an	average	thickness	of	 less	

than	1.0m	versus	a	historically	interpreted	1.2m.		
 A	 thorough	 reconciliation	 process	 should	 be	 conducted	 on	 all	 deposit	 Resource	 Estimations	 against	

mining,	 grade	 control	 and	 mill	 performance.	 This	 process	 has	 been	 conducted	 in	 2010	 and	 will	 be	
reviewed	with	the	new	models	produced	in	2011.

20 	SUMMARY 	PROGRAMME 	& 	BUDGET 	

	
The	 geological	 program	 recommended	 above	 for	 Crocodile	 Gold's	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	 Properties	 can	 be	
divided	 into	 three	 target	 streams,	 listed	 in	 order	 of	 priority:	 (1)	 Detailed	 Mine	 Planning	 &	 Development,	 (2)	
Resource	&	Reserve	Conversion	&	Expansion,	and	(3)	Regional	Exploration.		
	
Although	the	initial	priority	is	that	work	which	is	required	to	assist	production,	i.e.	(1)	Detailed	Mine	Planning	&	
Development,	it	is	important	that	this	area	not	be	the	only	stream	to	be	addressed	to	the	detriment	of	the	other	
two	streams	as	this	would	have	detrimental	medium	to	long‐term	repercussions.	
	
Each	 stream	 is	 comprised	 of	 two	 broad	 categories	 of	 activity:	 (I)	 Data	 Compilation	 &	 Re‐assessment,	 and	 (II)	
Drilling.	
	
The	database	audit	and	GIS	compilations	should	be	completed	in	2011	and	will	likely	take	six	months.	The	review	
and	re‐assessment	of	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	Reserves	will	become	a	regular	requirement	of	corporate	
reporting	 and	 it	 is	 expected	 that	 an	 annual	Mineral	 Resource	 &	Mineral	 Reserve	 Statement	will	 be	 issued	 by	
Crocodile	Gold.	
	
Continued	exploration	and	development	drilling	programs	will	be	required	 throughout	 the	 life	of	 the	Northern	
Territory	Gold	Properties,	to:	
	

 assist	with	new	mine	development	and	detailed	mine	planning;		
 convert	 existing	 Mineral	 Resources	 to	 Mineral	 Reserves,	 to	 establish	 a	 minimum	 five	 year	 Mineral	

Reserve	base;	
 augment	existing	Mineral	Resources	and	Mineral	Reserves;	
 establish	new	Mineral	Resources;		and		
 Continue	 to	evaluate	 the	mineral	potential	of	Crocodile	Gold's	 large	 tenement	holdings.	This	will	assist	

with	 tenement	 turnover,	 therefore	 areas	 with	 low	 potential	 for	 discoveries	 can	 be	 returned	 to	 the	
Department	of	Resources	(DoR)	

 make	new	discoveries	
	
The	 shorter	 term	drilling	 program	 should	 assist	 detailed	mine‐scale	 planning,	 and	planned	open	pit	mining	 at	
Howley,	Mottrams,	Princess	Louise	and	International,	and	development	projects,	e.g.	Cosmo	Deeps,	Howley	Trend	
and	Yam	Creek.	Deposits	 in	 the	Union	Reef	 area	also	need	drilling	definition	programs	 implemented.	The	Pine	
Creek	deposits	need	very	little	work	and	are	now	in	fact	Mineral	Reserves;	these	have	been	included	in	the	life	of	
mine	plan	 for	Crocodile	Gold	going	 forward.	Other	deposits	such	as	Bridge	Creek	and	the	Union	Reefs	deposits	
need	to	go	through	this	process	in	the	short	term	to	assist	with	future	life	of	mine	planning.	
	
Drilling	costs	of	$A30/m	RAB,	$A1,00/m	RC	and	an	average	$A200/m	DD		have	been	used	in	estimates	below.	
	
An	 annual	 exploration	&	development	 (geological)	 budget	 of	 approximately	 $A10.0	million	 is	 proposed	over	 a	
three	year	period,	 this	will	be	dependent	on	success,	 therefore	 if	drilling	 is	successful	 in	 identifying	a	potential	
high	grade	Mineral	Reserve	on	an	active	Mineral	Lease	then	more	money	may	be	required	to	successfully	get	the	
deposit	into	the	mine	plan.	
	

A	plan	needs	to	be	developed	in	conjunction	with	Crocodile	Gold's	Strategic	Operation	Plan	to	prepare	a	detailed	
operational	plan	and	drill	schedule	for	the	exploration	and	development	programs,	this	will	include	items	such	as	
a	structural	interpretation	and	geophysical	reviews	of	all	historical	data.

23 ADDITIONAL 	REQUIREMENTS 	FOR 	TECHNICAL 	REPORTS 	ON 	
DEVELOPMENT 	PROPERTIES 	& 	PRODUCTION 	PROPERTIES 	

	

23.1 	INTRODUCTION	

	
The	Northern	Territory	Gold	Properties	of	Crocodile	Gold	contain	total	Probable	Mineral	Reserves	of	7.7M	tonnes	
(diluted)	 at	 an	 average	 grade	 of	 2.9g/t	 gold	 (662,000	 oz	 gold)	 (Error!	Reference	 source	not	 found.).	 These	
Mineral	 Reserves	 are	 distributed	 between	 Underground	 (Brocks	 Creek,	 Cosmo)	 and	 Open	 Pit	 (Howley,	 North	
Point,	Princess	Louise,	Mottrams,	Kohinoor,	Cox,	South	Enterprise,	Gandy's,	and	International)	deposits.	
	
Mineral	Reserve	Evaluations	
	
Each	 individual	 Mineral	 Resource	 has	 been	 determined	 and	 evaluated	 on	 a	 "stand‐alone	 basis";	 however,	
consideration	 has	 accounted	 for	 potential	 economic	 and	 operational	 synergies	 resulting	 from	 simultaneous	
development	of	several	of	the	deposits.	
	
Details	 of	 these	 evaluations,	 including	 requirements	 for	 restarting	 previously	 existing	 mines,	 discussion	 of	
planned	 mining	 methods,	 mining	 dilution	 and	 losses,	 metallurgical	 recoveries,	 production	 schedules,	
environmental	considerations	and	financial	analyses,	including	mining	and	processing	costs,	NPV	evaluations	and	
sensitivity	analyses	are	summarized	below.	
	
Strategic	Operating	Plan	
	
Crocodile	Gold	current	strategy	is	to	get	the	Cosmo	Project	operational	as	quickly	as	possible.	This	project	is	the	
highest	margin	 longest	 life	deposit	 currently	 in	 their	 inventory.	 	Other	deposits	will	 continue	 to	operate	 to	aid	
funding	the	development	of	the	Cosmo	Project.		The	Princess	Louise	and	North	Point	Pits	will	be	operated	when	
available	seasonally,	Brocks	Creek	completed	mining	operations	and	Howley	and	Mottrams	providing	the	balance	
of	the	mill	feed.	

Opening	projects	 in	 the	Pine	Creek	region	 is	planned	during	2012.	 	The	Company	will	also	begin	to	 look	at	 the	
deposits	that	are	near	the	Union	Reefs	Mill.			

Although	not	considered	as	part	of	the	economic	evaluations	of	the	current	Mineral	Reserves,	Crocodile	Gold	also	
plan	 to	 devote	 considerable	 effort	 to	 increase,	wherever	 possible,	 the	 current	Mineral	 Resources,	 discussed	 in	
detail	 in	 Sections	 17.1	 and	 17.2	 of	 this	 report,	 and	 Mineral	 Reserves	 within	 the	 Northern	 Territory	 Gold	
Properties.	

Continuation	of	Mining	

Information	gained	from	operating	experience	has		been	used	in	the	preparation	of	economic	parameters	for	the	
assessment	of	Mineral	Reserves.	The	last	14	months	of	operation	has	given	a	solid	history	to	base	cost	estimates	
and	operating	parameters.

	 	 Australia	
	

[356]	
	

The	deposits	of	Brocks	Creek,	Howley,	Mottrams,	Princess	Louise	and	North	Point	have	all	been	mined	during	the	
last	14	months.		Cosmo	is	in	a	development	phase	with	approximately	450m	of	development	completed	as	well	as	
all	portal	and	infrastructure	setup.		
	
Environmental	
	
Crocodile	Gold	have	indicated	they	will	apply	contemporary	methodology	to	measure	and	rate	environmental	risk	
probability	and	consequences	and	provide	 indicators	to	the	degree	of	risk	and	relative	priority	associated	with	
every	issue.	
	
Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	

 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	

 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	
	
Each	 potential	 impact	 will	 be	 measured	 and	 addressed	 holistically	 and	 at	 a	 site	 level	 to	 deliver	 the	 most	
appropriate,	effective	bio‐diversity	management	measures.		
	
The	key	environmental	 impacts	 identified	using	 the	risk	assessment	procedure	will	be	managed	by	 the	setting	
and	 application	 of	 environmental	 objectives	 and	 the	 setting	 of	 and	 reaching	 for	 environmental	 targets.	 Time	
frames	 for	 achievement	 of	 objectives	 and	 targets,	 accountabilities	 for	 achieving	 objectives	 and	 targets,	 and	
resources	 required	 to	 achieve	 objectives	 and	 targets	 are	 included	 in	 fundamental	 operations	 planning,	 and	
performance	 indicators	 for	 each	 objective	 nominated	 facilitated	 by	 effective	 and	 progressive	 management	
practices.		

Crocodile	Gold	plan	to	apply	environmental	diligence	in	the	form	of	an	extensive	environmental	management	
system,	driven	by	sound	environmental	policy,	and	a	detailed	environmental	management	plan.	The	
environmental	management	plan	will	incorporate	thorough	environmental	risk	assessment	enabling	the	accurate	
application	of	environmental	bonds.	The	posting	of	environmental	bonds	is	appropriated	by	the	submission	to	
statutory	authorities	of	detailed	mine	management	plans,	inclusive	of	environmental	management	plans,	which	
provide	a	transparent	insight	into	company	intentions,	planned	and	proposed	practices.	

Crocodile	Gold	will	establish	a	formatted	approach	to	remediation,	which	will	be	applied	as	a	planned	part	of	all	
exploration,	mining	and	processing	practices.	Remediation	will	be	established	as	a	measured,	controlled	cost	that	
is	appropriately	planned	and	applied	to	prevent	unwanted	bio‐diversity	and	operational	end	game	expenditure	
and	exposure.	A	similar	approach	will	be	applied	to	reclamation,	which	is	also	a	formatted	approach	to	the	
recovery	of	infrastructure	and	planned	to	be	applied	as	an	integral	part	of	fundamentally	budgeted	operations.	
	
Risks	
	
The	risks	associated	with	planned	development	projects	have	been	 included	below	 in	 the	discussion	of	mining	
studies	 relating	 to	 the	 definition	 of	 Mineral	 Reserves	 and	 commencement	 of	 mining	 are	 well	 advanced.	 The	
potential	risks	to	each	of	the	projects	due	to	their	status	or	factors	on	each	project	that	display	key	risks	to	the	



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp

[357]	
	

project	will	be	monitored	to	ensure	performance	is	as	the	expectations		detailed	in	this	reserve	estimate	are	also	
listed	in	sections	below.	
	
One	of	the	largest	ongoing	risks	to	any	mining	project	is	fluctuations	in	metal	price	and	currency	exchange	rates.	
These	 can	 be	 mitigated	 somewhat	 by	 hedging	 all,	 or	 a	 portion	 of	 the	 currency	 and/or	 gold	 prices.	 Although	
nothing	 is	 certain,	 it	 appears	 from	commentary	by	most	 experts	 that	 gold	prices	 should	 remain	 strong	 for	 the	
foreseeable	future.	
	
The	global	and	Australian	minerals	industry	was	booming	under	the	market	conditions	which	existed	until	early	
in	2008,	with	 shortages	of	 skilled	 labour	and	 technical	 staff	 both	nationally	and	 internationally.	 	The	ability	 to	
recruit	and	retain	suitably	experienced	personnel	was	a	key	issue	and	an	ongoing	challenge	for	companies	within	
the	industry.		As	a	result	of	these	shortages	there	was	upward	pressure	on	remuneration	and	greater	selectivity	
by	potential	employees	regarding	location	and	terms	and	conditions	of	employment.	 	A	period	of	slower	global	
market	conditions	has	reduced	the	pressure	on	all	aspects	of	recruitment,	availability	of	contractors	and	resulting	
operating	 costs.	 There	 appears	 to	 be	 a	 return	 to	 the	 boom	 conditions	 of	 2008	 beginning	 to	 emerge.	 As	 at	 all	
mining	 operations,	 there	 is	 risk	 that	 if	 suitably	 experienced	 personnel	 cannot	 be	 recruited	 and	 retained	 by	
Crocodile	Gold	and	its	contractors,	that	future	mine	production	plans	will	be	difficult	to	achieve.	This	is	a	factor	
that	Crocodile	Gold	will	need	to	monitor	closely	over	the	next	12	months.	
	
Financial	Analysis	
	
Economic	 analysis	 of	 the	 Mineral	 Reserves	 has	 utilized	 a	 gold	 price	 of	 $US1000	 per	 ounce	 and	 a	 $A	 to	 $US	
exchange	rate	of	0.91,	based	on	a	three	year	average	gold	price	as	of	31	Dec	2010	and	a	three	year	average	$A	to	
$US	exchange	rate	of	0.91.	
	
Net	Present	Valuations	(NPV)	have	been	completed	using	a	discount	rate	of	7.5%.	
	
Sensitivity	analyses	have	been	completed	on	variations	in	gold	price,	operating	costs	and	deposit	grades.	
	

23.2 	MINING	OPERATIONS	

	

23.3 	TOM'S	GULLY	GOLD	MINE	

Tom's	Gully	has	been	omitted	from	the	Mineral	Reserves	as	trial	mining	in	the	deposit	proved	that	the	ore	body	
was	far	more	variable	than	originally	thought.			
	
Crocodile	Gold	took	a	low	risk	strategy	to	Tom's	Gully	with	infill	drilling	and	some	development	taking	place	to	
further	define	the	ore	body.		It	was	at	the	conclusion	of	this	program	that	the	following	was	realized	

 Mineralization	was	not	always	bound	in	the	same	stratigraphy	
 The	mineralization	was	far	more	variable	than	originally	anticipated	
 Head	grades	realized	were	well	below	expectations	(Actual	3.5	g/t	Au	vs.	Planned	7g/t	Au)	

This	 led	 to	 the	suspension	of	mining	operations	at	 the	deposit	 in	 the	short	 term	and	hence	 the	 removal	of	 the	
deposit	from	Mineral	Reserves.

23.4 	BROCKS	CREEK	GOLD	MINE	

	

23.4.1 	INTRODUCTION	

	
The	 Brocks	 Creek	 underground	 gold	 mine	 has	 been	 operated	 by	 Crocodile	 Gold	 since	 the	 commencement	 of	
operations	in	November,	2009.	The	mine	has	operated	continuously	during	this	period.	
	
Ore	from	Brocks	Creek	is	trucked	to	the	Union	Reefs	Gold	Plant;	there	is	no	processing	plant	currently	at	Brocks	
Creek.	Surface	infrastructure	comprises	a	mine	office,	core	yard	and	associated	support	buildings.	
	
Mining	
	
Crocodile	Gold's	current	plan	is	that	the	Brocks	Creek	Gold	Mine	will	continue	to	be	operated	until	depletion	of	
the	Mineral	Reserve.		
	
Personnel	
	
Personnel	are	largely	sourced	from	Darwin	throughout	the	projects	life.	 	The	reopening	of	several	operations	in	
the	area	is	beginning	to	put	pressure	on	the	supply	of	personnel.		Initially	all	the	workforce	resided	locally;	some	
fly	in	/	fly	out	personnel	are	now	required	to	resource	the	mine.		
	
Mining	Equipment	
	
Mining	equipment	 is	supplied	by	 the	appointed	contractor.	A	 fleet	of	mechanized	equipment	services	 the	mine	
with	all	equipment	required	currently	in	operation.	
	
Capital	Costs	
	
There	 are	 no	 further	 Capital	 Costs	 associated	with	Brocks	 Creek	Mine	 as	 all	 infrastructure	 is	 in	 place	 and	 the	
remainder	of	the	Mineral	Reserve	will	be	depleted	over	the	next	6	months.	
	

23.4.2 	MINING		

	
Mining	Method	
	
Access	to	the	underground	workings	at	Brocks	Creek	is	via	an	approximately	4.5	m	by	4.5	m	decline.	The	decline	
descends	at	a	1	in	7	ratio	(Figure	23‐1).	The	mining	method	used	comprises	mechanized	uphole	retreat	stoping	
mining.	 As	 each	 access	 drive	 was	 developed	 and	 a	 program	 of	 orebody	 definition	 diamond	 drilling	 was	
undertaken	for	each	level.			
	
The	two	ore	bodies	for	extraction	are	the	Main	Lode	that	runs	east	‐	west	and	dips	at	59°	and	the	Central	Lode	
dipping	at	35°	and	running	north	‐	south.		The	access	drive	is	located	in	the	footwall	of	both	the	Main	Lode	and	the	
Central	Lode	and	a	drilling	program	is	used	to	accurately	define	the	ore	body	at	each	level.			



Technical	Report	 	 				Crocodile	Gold	Corp	
May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	
	

[359]	
	

	
The	planned	mining	will	retreat	from	the	east	to	the	west	end	leaving	rib/island	pillars	and	sill	pillars	as	required.		
The	retreat	mining	ensures	that	large	quantities	of	capital	are	not	locked	into	the	costs	of	the	decline	prior	to	ore	
extraction	is	required.		
	
All	stoping	is	planned	at	20	m	sub	level	intervals	with	approximately	15	m	vertical	stopes	with	the	remaining	4	
vertical	meters	from	development.	A	program	of	hanging	wall	stabilization	is	undertaken	by	grouted	cable	bolting	
and	rock	bolting	in	the	hangingwall	of	each	drill	drive.		Stoping	is	undertaken	by	uphole	drilling	and	blasting.			
	
Planned	production	holes	will	be	64	mm	 in	diameter.	 	Most	of	 the	mucking	will	be	done	using	 remote	 control	
allowing	loaders	to	work	in	the	open	stope	and	recover	all	blasted	ore.			
	
The	mined	ore	is	then	loaded	onto	an	underground	truck,	hauled	to	surface	and	stockpiled	at	a	nearby	ore	pad	
where	it	is	readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	processing	plant.	
	
Geotechnical		
	
Geotechnical	characteristics	of	the	Brocks	Creek	Mine	are	known	through	historical	mining.	In	addition,	regular	
geotechnical	reviews	are	conducted	by	Geotechnical	Consulting	Pty	Ltd.	
	 	
Hydrology	 	
	
Brocks	Creek	has	passed	through	aquifers	in	the	upper	levels.		Water	ingress	is	reducing	due	to	the	down	draw	of	
these	aquifers.	Current	dewatering	is	well	in	excess	of	groundwater	volumes	and	it	is	anticipated	that	inflows	will	
further	reduce	with	the	further	drawing	down	of	the	aquifer.	The	lower	levels	of	Brocks	Creek	are	essentially	dry	
with	only	the	water	table	and	surface	water	filtering	through	to	pump	stations	in	the	upper	levels.

Dewatering	 	
	
The	current	main	pump	stations	are	 sufficient	 to	handle	 the	water	produced	at	 the	mine.	 	 It	 is	 anticipated	 the	
extra	stages	of	these	Mono	pumps	will	be	added	with	depth.		
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Stope	Dilution	
	
Dilution	has	been	estimated	at	30%	for	all	production	sources.	This	is	the	equivalent	of	1	m	of	dilution	over	the	
average	 orebody	width.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	 has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	 dilution	which	 is	 considered	 conservative	 as	
there	are	quartz	 veined	 areas	with	 associated	mineralized	material	 in	 the	hangingwall.	These	quartz	veins	 are	
inconsistent	in	terms	of	width,	location	and	grade	and	are	hence	not	included	in	the	Ore	Reserve.			
	
Development	Dilution	
	
The	development	dilution	has	been	estimated	from	the	block	model	and	using	mine	design	shape.	 	A	minimum	
mining	width	of	3	m	has	been	assumed	for	the	equipment	planned	to	be	used	at	Brocks	Creek.	 	Where	the	ore	
body	narrows,	waste	in	the	footwall	will	be	mined	and	this	has	been	reported	as	the	grade	of	the	block	model	in	
this	region.	
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Main	Lode	
	
The	Main	Lode	ore	recovery	has	been	estimated	at	90%.		Underbreak	of	the	stope,	mucking	efficiencies	and	the	
requirement	 in	places	to	 leave	rib	pillars	 in	the	ore	body	as	required	for	hangingwall	stability	have	been	taken	
into	account	in	determining	a	recovery	factor	of	90%.		
	
Central	Lode	
	
The	Central	Lode	ore	recovery	has	been	estimated	at	85%	of	in‐situ	ore	to	be	recovered.		This	is	due	to	its	shallow	
dip	 of	 part	 of	 the	 Central	 Lode	 and	 proximity	 to	 the	 hinge	 of	 the	 anticline	 structure	 in	which	 the	 ore	 body	 is	
hosted.	 	The	Main	Lode	will	also	be	extracted	prior	to	extraction	of	 the	Central	Lode.	 	The	recovery	calculation	
also	takes	into	account	the	need	for	rib	pillars	(where	required)	in	the	Central	Lode.			
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
The	Brocks	Creek	ore	was	historically	treated	at	the	Union	Reefs	Gold	Plant.	Based	on	historical	reconciliations,	
the	average	gold	recovery	was	97%.	A	conservative	95%	recovery	 factor	 is	utilized	 in	 reserve	estimations	and	
cash	flow	models.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
Production	schedules	have	been	created	using	Earthworks	Planning	Software	(EPS).	Production	is	scheduled	at	
8,000	–	10,000t	per	month	(Figure	23‐2,	Figure	23‐3).

Environmental	Considerations	
Brocks	creek	project	is	an	underground	mining	operation	with	substantial	surface	infrastructure.	

	
Potential	Environmental	Impacts		

Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	

 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	

 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	
Impact	management	plan	

Potential	environmental	impact	management	programs	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	
Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	re‐vegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.

[364]	
	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	
Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	will	be	minimized	by	assessing,	identifying,	measuring	and	
controlling	acid	rock	drainage	from	mining	operations	utilizing	encapsulation,	diversion	of	any	potentially	
detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	methodologies.	
	
Risk	Analysis	
	
Potential	risks	which	could	affect	the	Brocks	Creek	Gold	Mine	include:	

 Geotechnical	performance	continuing	as	expected	
 Performance	of	mining	method	as	expected	
 Escalation	of	mining	costs	
 Geology	/	Drilling	of	further	resource	

	
Financial	Analysis	
	
Assumptions	
	
Economic	analysis	of	the	Brocks	Creek	Gold	Mine	is	based	on	the	following	assumptions:	
	
Gold	Price	
	
$US975/oz	
	
Exchange	Rate	
	
$A:$US::0.90:1	
	
Recovery	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery:	95%		
	
Cost	Estimates	
	
Mining	Costs	
	
Mining	 costs	 for	 the	 Brocks	 Creek	 underground	 mine	 are	 derived	 from	 historical	 costs	 and	 current	 mining	
contract.	In	addition	to	the	contractors'	costs,	the	costs	borne	directly	by	Crocodile	Gold	are	added	to	the	costs.		
These	are	items	such	as	fuel,	power	and	technical	services	for	the	operation.			
	
The	 total	 mining	 costs	 are	 estimated	 at	 $184	 per	 tonne.	 Total	 operating	 costs	 $221	 per	 tonne	 including	 all	
downstream	costs	from	the	mining	area	(i.e.	haulage,	milling,	administration	etc).			
	
The	Brocks	Creek	mine	is	70	km	by	road	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.		Ore	haulage	from	the	project	mine	
site	will	be	covered	by	a	recently	tendered	Haulage	Contract.	 	 It	has	been	assumed	that	the	cost	of	ore	haulage	
from	the	operating	mine	site	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant	will	be	$8.20/t	based	on	this	existing	contract.

[365]	
	

	
Processing	Costs	
	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	Brocks	Creek	mineral	reserve.		This	is	the	cost	
of	treating	ore	at	the	Union	Reefs	plant.	
	
Administration	Costs	
	
Administration	costs	have	been	estimated	at	$13	per	tonne	for	all	ore	produced	at	Brocks	Creek.	
	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
	
A	Gold	Royalty	of	$20	/oz	for	all	gold	sold	is	payable	to	AngloGold.	
	
Revenue	
	
Total	revenue	is	calculated	with	a	gold	price	of	$US975/oz	using	a	95%	mill	recovery	from	the	ounces	mined.		The	
total	revenue	is	estimated	at	$9.7M.			
	
NPV	Evaluation	
	
The	Net	Present	Value	of	the	project	at	a	discount	rate	of	7.5	%	per	annum	is	$0.4M	at	a	gold	price	of	$US775/oz.

The	following	tasks	are	required	prior	to	commencement	of	full	scale	production:	
	

 Dewatering	of	the	Cosmo	open	pit		

The	existing	Cosmo	open	pit	 is	130	m	deep	and	holds	approximately	5.7	million	cubic	meters	of	highly	
acidic	water.	

	
A	total	of	$8	M	has	been	estimated	for	the	dewatering	of	the	Cosmo	open	pit.	
	
As	 a	 result	 of	 heavy	 rains	 during	 the	 fourth	 quarter	 of	 2010,	 the	 water	 levels	 increased	 to	 a	 level	
necessitating	the	construction	of	a	water	treatment	plant	at	an	estimated	cost	of	$3	M.	
	

 Furthur	assessment	Crown	Pillar		

Approximately	3	Mt	of	acidic	tailings	have	previously	been	dumped	in	the	Cosmo	open	pit.	It	will	be	cost	
effective	to	remove	the	tailings	prior	to	the	commencement	of	mining.	
	
A	total	of	$8.8M	has	been	allowed	for	the	removal	and	containment	of	tailings	from	the	Cosmo	open	pit.	
	
The	Mineral	Reserve	has	been	calculated	based	on	the	removal	of	both	the	tailings	and	the	water	in	the	pit	
prior	to	mining.		
	

	
 Ventilation	

Currently	the	mine	is	ventilated	using	a	fan	and	duct	for	the	initial	development	of	the	mine.	
	
The	 current	 underground	 development	 plan	 proposes	 a	 mine	 portal	 within	 the	 southern	 wall	 of	 the	
Cosmo	open	pit.	 	Underground	mine	ventilation	will	need	to	be	established	and	it	 is	recommended	that	
0.05	m3/s/kW	of	diesel	power	be	installed.	Table	24‐2	summarizes	the	ventilation	equipment	required	at	
the	Cosmo	mine	site.			
	
At	full	operating	capacity,	the	mine	would	require	approximately	160	m3/s	air	flow.	Fresh	air	would	arrive	
via	the	decline	and	escape	ladder	way,	returning	via	return	air	rises	and	stopes	between	sub‐levels.	

	
The	 estimated	 cost	 for	 the	 installation	 of	 such	 a	 ventilation	 system	 is	 $500,000	 plus	 $150,000	 for	
electricals.	
	
During	the	initial	underground	development	interim	ventilation,	at	an	estimate	cost	of	$1.5	million,	will	be	
required	prior	to	the	permanent	ventilation	is	established.	
	

 Compressed	air	

A	 compressor	 will	 need	 to	 be	 established	 for	 compressed	 air	 to	 be	 reticulated	 through	 the	 mine.	 	 At	
commencement	of	underground	mining,	it	is	recommended	an	air	compressor	of	approximately	450	cubic	
feet	per	minute	at	7	bar	is	installed.			
	
The	estimated	cost	of	a	compressor,	a	dryer,	receivers	and	filters	for	compressors	of	this	size	is	$100,000.

 Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

It	is	estimated	that	the	pumping	capacity	required	to	dewater	the	Cosmo	underground	for	the	life	of	the	
mine	 is	 20l/s.	 This	 estimate	 is	 conceptual	 and	 needs	 to	 be	 confirmed	 or	 adjusted	 following	 detailed	
modeling.	 	 The	underground	dewatering	 cost	 is	 currently	 estimated	at	 $100,000	and	 is	 included	 in	 the	
$8.0M	cost	of	the	mine	dewatering	system.			
	

 Water		

The	estimated	cost	for	an	upgrade	of	the	underground	water	reticulation	is	$100,000.		
	

 Power	

Power	at	Cosmo	has	been	re‐established	by	connecting	to	the	PAWA	grid.		An	upgrade	of	transformers	is	
required	at	some	point	and	$455,000	has	been	estimated	for	this	project.	
	

Capital	Cost	

The	estimated	capital	costs	 for	 the	Cosmo	Deeps	underground	mine	are	summarized	 in	 the	 table	below	(Table	
23‐3).	 	 These	 are	 remaining	 set	up	 capital	 costs	 that	need	 to	be	 completed	 for	 the	operation	over	 the	next	12	
months.

In	addition	to	these	capital	purchases	the	ongoing	development	of	declines	and	installation	of	return	air	rise	will	
form	a	part	of	the	sustaining	capital.		These	are	covered	further	in	the	section	on	mining	costs.	
	
Mining	Method	
	
The	 Cosmo	Deeps	 Gold	 Deposit	 comprises	 three	main	mineralized	 lodes	which	 are	 considered	 independently.		
The	variation	in	thickness	and	grade	of	these	lodes	has	led	to	uneconomic	areas	by	isolating	stopes	in	each	lode,	
with	further	isolation	of	stopes	along	the	western	limb	of	the	anticline.	
	
The	mine	development	and	scheduling	have	been	designed	to	produce	ore	as	soon	as	possible	while	limiting	the	
number	 of	 pillars	 required	 within	 zones	 of	 economic	 ore.	 	 To	 maximize	 the	 resource	 recovery,	 two	 mining	
methods	have	been	considered	for	Cosmo.	They	are	down	hole	–	Stope	&	Fill	(Modified	Avoca),	which	will	be	the	
main	 stoping	 method	 and	 Uphole	 Bench	 Stoping	 which	 will	 be	 used	 for	 isolated	 stopes.	 	 The	 detail	 for	 each	
method	is	documented	below.	
	
Stope	&	Fill	Mining	(Modified	Avoca)			
	
Stope	and	fill	mining	is	sequenced	from	the	bottom	up,	which	delays	the	production	of	stope	ore	until	the	lowest	
development	drive	is	completed.	To	reduce	the	delay	of	developing	to	the	bottom	of	the	mine	before	stope	ore	is	
available,	sill	pillars	are	designed	at	intervals	along	the	mining	sequence	to	allow	earlier	ore	production.	The	sill	
pillars	provide	support	for	stoping	below	already	open	stopes.	The	location	of	the	sill	pillars	are	flexible	to	allow	
for	 variations	 in	 ore	 grade	 from	 the	 block	 model	 and	 for	 changes	 in	 scheduling	 due	 to	 the	 rate	 of	 decline	
development	or	ore	extraction.	Figure	23‐7	and	Figure	23‐8	outline	the	development	and	fill	sequence	for	Cosmo.	
	
In	 the	 case	of	 the	Cosmo	mine,	 stope	and	 fill	mining	provides	 for	 the	 stockpiling	of	 acid	producing	waste	 rock	
underground.	Existing	waste	dumps	at	Cosmo	will	be	reduced	in	size	as	the	fill	requirements	of	the	underground	
stopes	exceed	the	total	amount	of	waste	produced	by	mine	development.

Stope	Development		
	
Once	drill	drives	are	completed	above	and	below	the	stope,	drilling	of	production	holes	can	commence.	
	
The	first	production	ore	is	available	after	charging	and	firing	a	cut	off	rise	and	production	rings.

These	 stopes	 will	 be	 fired	 and	 extracted	 until	 the	 length	 of	 the	 open	 stope	 approaches	 a	 state	 of	 instability,	
followed	by	backfilling	to	support	the	walls	and	a	 further	series	of	stope	extraction	and	filling	until	 the	 level	 is	
complete.	The	next	level	up	is	extracted	from	the	top	of	the	previously	backfilled	stope.	
	
Waste	rock	previously	stockpiled	on	surface	will	be	returned	underground	for	backfilling	of	the	stopes.		It	will	be	
necessary	 to	 re‐establish	 loader	 access	 to	 the	 top	 of	 each	backfilled	 stope	 to	 allow	 the	 extraction	 of	 the	 stope	
above.	The	stoping	and	backfilling	sequence	continues	until	the	uppermost	stope	has	been	extracted	and	filled.	
	
Sill	Pillar	Development	
	
A	5	m	sill	 pillar	will	 remain	 intact	 between	each	block	of	 stoping	 and	 filling.	 	 The	 sill	 pillar	will	 be	 created	by	
drilling	an	uphole	stope	at	the	top	of	any	stope	and	fill	block	which	has	another	stope	and	fill	block	directly	above.			
	
Uphole	Bench	Stoping		
	
Uphole	bench	stoping	is	a	top	down	mining	method	which	produces	stope	ore	as	each	level	of	ore	development	is	
completed,	 leaving	permanent	 island	pillars	 in	 lower	grade	zones	within	the	stopes.	The	sequencing	for	uphole	
bench	stoping	is	presented	in	Figure	23‐9,	Figure	23‐10,	Figure	23‐11.	
	
Uphole	 bench	 stoping	 is	 used	 for	 isolated	 stopes	 and	 early	 ore	 production	 as	 ore	 is	 made	 available	 at	 the	
completion	of	 each	development	 level.	The	 location	of	 island	pillars	 is	 flexible,	 allowing	 their	 location	 in	 lower	
grade	and/or	less	stable	zones.	
	
In	the	case	of	the	Cosmo	Mine,	the	uppermost	lode	stopes	will	be	mined	using	uphole	bench	stoping	to	generate	
revenue	early	in	the	mine	life.	The	other	lodes	will	be	mined	using	uphole	benching	due	to	their	limited	size	and	
isolation.

Stopes	are	20	m	in	height	where	the	orebody	geometry	allows.	Production	holes	for	each	stoping	level	are	drilled	
up	from	each	level.	Production	ore	is	available	after	charging	and	firing	the	cut	off	rise	and	production	rings	once	
stoping	is	completed	on	any	level	directly	above.

The	mining	dilution	on	development	is	negligible.		Even	though	over	break	can	occur,	it	is	likely	to	be	inside	the	
orebody	and	hence	take	ore	from	the	planned	stope	shapes.	 	As	such	it	will	report	through	in	the	development	
activity.	
	
Mining	dilution	of	15%	at	a	zero	grade	has	been	estimated	for	this	mining	method	to	account	 for	dilution	from	
stope	walls,	dilution	of	rill	and	fill	dilution.		Fill	dilution	is	the	mixing	of	ore	and	waste	at	the	junction	of	the	in‐situ	
ore	and	the	waste	from	the	backfill.	Fill	dilution	will	come	from	the	digging	down	into	the	backfill	whilst	mucking	
in	the	stope.	
	
Uphole	Bench	Stoping	
	
Mining	dilution	of	10%	at	a	zero	grade	has	been	estimated	for	this	mining	method	to	account	 for	dilution	from	
stope	walls.	
	
The	mining	dilution	on	development	is	negligible.	 	Even	though	overbreak	can	occur,	it	is	likely	to	be	inside	the

activity.	
	
	
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Stope	&	Fill	Mining	(Modified	Avoca)			
	
The	mining	 recovery	 estimated	 for	 the	modified	 Avoca	mining	 is	 95%.	 	 The	 5%	of	 unrecovered	 ore	 has	 been	
allowed	for	mucking	difficulties	and	underbreak	on	footwall	and	hanging	walls	through	normal	operations.	
	
Uphole	Bench	Stoping	
	
The	 mining	 recovery	 for	 the	 uphole	 retreat	 mining	 is	 estimated	 at	 90%.	 	 The	 permanent	 pillars	 left	 will	 be	
approximately	5	%	of	the	resource.		The	remaining	5%	has	been	allowed	for	mucking	difficulties	and	underbreak	
on	footwall	and	hanging	walls	through	normal	operations.	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Metallurgical	recovery	is	estimated	at	95%	based	on	historical	testwork	and	production	records	from	the	Cosmo	
open	pit	operation.	
	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
After	an	initial	ramp‐up	period	of	approximately	three	quarters	dominated	by	development,	quarterly	production	
will	 range	 between	 1000,000	 to	 150000	 tonnes	 per	 quarter.	 (Figure	 23‐12,	 Figure	 23‐13).	 	 It	 is	 envisage	 the	
production	rate	will	then	stay	at	that	level	from	the	conversion	of	inferred	resources.

Environmental	Considerations	
Cosmo	deeps	project	is	an	underground	mining	operation,	which	allows	the	potential	for	substantial	surface	
infrastructure.	

Potential	environmental	impacts		

Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	
 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	
 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	

acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	
 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	
 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	
 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	

Impact	management	plan	

Potential	environmental	impact	management	programs	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development;	
Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD);	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna;	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure;	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance;	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality;	
Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	will	be	minimized	by	assessing,	identifying,	measuring	and	
controlling	acid	rock	drainage	from	mining	operations	utilizing	encapsulation,	diversion	of	any	potentially	
detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	methodologies.

mine	site	will	be	covered	by	a	new	haulage	contract.	 	It	has	been	assumed	that	the	cost	of	ore	haulage	from	the	
operating	mine	site	to	the	Union	Reef's	processing	plant	will	be	$8.20/t	based	on	this	existing	contract.	
	
Processing	Costs	
	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	estimated	as	the	cost	of	treating	the	ore	at	Union	Reef's	Processing	Plant	and	
was	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	Cosmo	Deeps	mine.		
	
Administration	Costs	
	
The	 Administration	 costs	 have	 been	 estimated	 by	 comparison	with	 a	 number	 of	 similarly	 sized	 operations	 in	
Australia.	The	total	Administration	cost	for	the	Cosmo	mine	is	estimated	at	$4	per	tonne	of	ore	produced.	 	This	
estimate	includes	all	overheads	that	are	not	specifically	costed	elsewhere,	such	as:	
	

 Accommodation	and	Messing	
 Insurances		
 Payroll	

	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
	
No	gold	royalty	is	applicable.	
	
Revenue	
	
Based	on	a	gold	price	of	$US1000/oz	and	a	95%	mill	recovery	from	the	ounces	mined,	total	revenue	is	estimated	
at	$440M.			
	
NPV	Evaluation	
	
The	NPV	of	the	Cosmo	project	is	$89	million	at	a	7.5%	discount	rate	based	on	a	gold	price	of	$US1000/oz	(

 Power	
Electrical	 power	 supply	 to	 the	 mining	 operations	 and	 associated	 infrastructure	 is	 via	 portable	 diesel	
generators.	Offices	and	amenities	are	located	on	the	main	grid	at	entrance	to	the	site.	

	
 Workshops	

Workshops	are	in	place	and	these	are	installed	and	maintained	by	the	contractor.	
	

 Office		
Administration	will	be	managed	from	the	existing	office	facilities	at	the	entrance	to	the	Mine	Site	adjacent	
to	Cosmo	Camp.	They	accommodate	management,	administration	and	technical	staff.	All	telephone,	data	
and	office	facilities	exist.			

	
 Camp	Facilities	

Employees	 and	 contractors	 conducting	work	 at	Howley	Mine	 Site	will	 be	 accommodated	 at	 the	 Cosmo	
Single	 Persons'	 Quarters	 (Cosmo	 SPQ).	 The	 Cosmo	 SPQ	 is	 5km	 from	 the	 minesite	 and	 consists	 of	
approximately	250	rooms,	a	swimming	pool,	gym,	recreational	areas,	wet	mess	and	barbeque	facilities.	

	
Some	 local	 personnel,	 however,	 	 opt	 to	 live	 in	 private	 residences	 in	 Pine	 Creek,	 Adelaide	 River	 or	
Katherine	and		commute	to	the	mine	sites.	

	
Capital	Costs	
	
There	is	no	significant	capital	required	for	the	project	as	is	already	operating.	
	
Mining	Method	
	
The	Howley	Pit	is	being	contractor	mined	using	drill	and	blast	and	load	and	haul	open	pit	mining	techniques.		The	
blasted	 ore	 will	 be	 excavated,	 loaded	 onto	 trucks	 and	 hauled	 to	 a	 nearby	 ore	 pad	where	 it	 is	 stockpiled	 and	
readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	
	
Detailed	grade	control	activities	such	as	drilling,	sampling	and	bench	mapping	will	minimize	mining	dilution	and	
maximize	ore	recovery.

Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

Groundwater	at	Howley	South	Extension	is	located	predominantly	within	fractured	rock	aquifers	associated	with	
fault	zones,	vuggy	quartz	veining	and	fracturing	within	dolerite	and	greywacke	units	of	 the	Koolpin	Formation.	
Groundwater	 levels	 are	 between	 4m	 and	 15m	 below	 ground	 level,	 depending	 on	 topography.	 Regionally,	
groundwater	flows	to	the	northeast,	towards	the	Stuart	Highway.	
	
During	mining	operations,	groundwater	will	be	intersected	below	the	water	table.	As	a	result,	groundwater	inflow	
to	the	open	pits	will	occur.	In‐pit	sumps	and	pumps	have	been	used	to	dewater	the	pit.	
	
Average	 groundwater	 inflows	 at	 Howley	 South	 Extension	 are	 estimated	 at	 3,980	 kL/day	 after	 30	 days	 and	
progressively	decrease	to	1,170	kL/day	after	one	year.	Long‐term	estimated	inflows	have	been	calculated	at	860	
kL/day.	 Season	 effects	 of	 the	wet	 season	 also	make	 large	 differences	 to	 dewatering	 requirement	with	 75%	of	
annual	pumping	occurring	during	this	period.	
	
Monitoring	 bores	 are	 in	 existence	 around	 the	 pit.	 The	 analyses	 indicated	 fresh,	 neutral	 to	 slightly	 alkaline	
groundwater.	
	
Geotechnical	

Geotechnical	Consulting	Pty	Ltd	(GCPL)	produced	the	Howley	(CHINESE)	SOUTH	STAGE	1	PIT	‐	GEOTECHNICAL	
SLOPE	DESIGN	Report	in	June	2008	(McEnhill,	2008).	
	
Recommendations	were	based	upon	 information	 interpreted	 from	10	resource	drillholes	 logged	geotechnically,	
structural	mapping	and	photography	of	the	old	Chinese	South	1	and	3	Pits,	and	slope	performance	observations	in	
the	old	Cosmo	and	Big	Howley	Pits.		
	
Modeling	 confirmed	 that	 incompetent	 tuff	 and	metasediment	 zones	 are	 interbedded	between	more	 competent	
dolerite	 sill	 intrusives.	 Dolerite	 sill	 intrusion,	 anticlinal	 folding	 and	 flexural	 slippage	 has	 resulted	 in	 brittle	
deformation	of	the	incompetent	stratum	producing	highly	fractured,	very	poor	quality	bedding	shear	zones,	inter‐
layered	with	more	competent	dolerite.	Ground	conditions	are	therefore	variable.	
	
The	slope	geometries	recommended	by	GCPL	for	each	of	the	Chinese	South	Stage	1	geotechnical	domains	can	be	
seen	on	Figure	23‐18.	These	recommended	slopes	should	form	the	basis	of	the	Stage	1	pit	design.	It	is	important	
that	the	Upper	450	Clay‐Oxide	Slopes	should	extend	to	the	"Base	of	Oxide"	dtm	available	from	Geology.	The	third	
and	fourth	bench	600	and	650	batters	on	the	east	wall	should	transcend	to	the	west	wall	550	and	600	over	the	
length	of	the	north	&	south	walls.	The	modeling	results	indicate	that	providing	no	unforeseen	adversely	oriented	
structures	are	encountered	and	slopes	are	 fully	drained,	 that	 the	 slopes	 recommended	are	expected	 to	 remain	
stable	for	the	duration	of	mining.

Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade.		
	
	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Previous	processing	of	Howley	South	Extension	ore	through	the	Union	Reefs	CIL	plant	over	the	 last	14	months	
has	 returned	 gold	 recoveries	 in	 the	 range	 of	 87%	 to	 92%.	 Ore	 recovery	 was	 assumed	 to	 be	 90%	 for	 the	
calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	Howley.	
	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	stripping	ratio	has	been	smoothed	as	much	as	possible	to	produce	approximately	70,000t	to	80,000t	of	ore	
per	month	(Figure	23‐19).

Environmental	Considerations	
	
The	Howley	project	is	an	open‐pit	mining	operation	that	will	be	serviced	by	remote	and	latterly	site	located	
processing	facilities.	

Potential	environmental	impacts		

Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	

 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	

 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	
Impact	management	plan	

Potential	environmental	impact	management	programs	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	
	
Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

	
Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.

	 	 Australia	
	

[389]	
	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	
	
Effects	 on	 soil,	 groundwater	 and	 surface	 water	 quality	 will	 be	 minimized	 by	 assessing,	 identifying,	
measuring	and	controlling	acid	rock	drainage	from	mining	operations	utilizing	encapsulation,	diversion	of	
any	 potentially	 detrimental	 flows	 to	 capture,	 discharge,	 treatment	 and	 flora	 and	 biological	 polishing	
methodologies.	

Risk	Analysis	
	

 Geotechnical	performance	continuing	as	expected	
 Performance	of	mining	method	as	expected	
 Escalation	of	mining	costs	
 Geology	/	Drilling	of	further	resource	
 Pit	scheduling	to	manage	stripping	ratio	
 Adverse	weather	conditions	during	the	wet	season	

	
Financial	Analysis	
	
Assumptions	
	
The	following	assumptions	have	been	made	in	regard	to	the	Howley	South	Extension	Gold	Deposit:	
	
Gold	Price	
	
$US1000/oz	
	
Exchange	Rate	
	
$A:$US::0.91:1	
	
Recovery	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery:	90%		
	
Cost	Estimates	
	
The	total	costs	of	the	Howley	project	are	estimated	at	$13.5M.		The	unit	cost	of	ore	treated	including	capital	is	$39	
per	tonne	of	ore	or	$764/oz.			
	
Mining	Costs	
	
Mining	costs	are	estimated	at	$11.17	per	tonne	for	the	Howley	Pit	based	on	the	Current	Mining	Costs	from	the	
Mining	Contractor	and	Crocodile	Gold	costs	of	mining.

Haulage	Costs	
	
The	Howley	South	Extension	mine	 is	approximately	70km	by	road	 to	 the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	A	new	
haulage	contract	has	been	tendered	and	the	cost	 for	haulage,	road	maintenance	and	 feeding	the	mill	 is	$8.20/t	
from	Howley	South	Extension.	
	
Processing	Costs	
	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	estimated	as	the	cost	of	treating	the	ore	at	Union	Reef's	Processing	Plant	and	
was	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	Howley	South	Extension	mine.		
	
Administration	Costs	
	
The	Administration	 costs	have	been	 estimated	 from	 first	principles	by	 calculating	 the	 total	 administration	and	
overhead	 costs	 for	 the	 sites.	 The	 total	 Administration	 cost	 for	 the	 Howley	mine	 is	 estimated	 at	 $4	 per	 tonne	
produced	or	$340	k	per	month.	 	This	estimate	includes	all	overheads	that	are	not	specifically	costed	elsewhere,	
such	as:	
	

 Accommodation	and	Messing	
 Insurances		
 Payroll	
 Central	Services	

	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
	
There	is	no	royalty	payable	on	the	Howley	South	Extension	Gold	Deposit.	
	
Revenue	
	
Based	on	a	gold	price	of	US$1000/oz	and	a	90%	mill	recovery	from	the	ounces	mined,	total	revenue	is	estimated	
at	$17.5M.			
	
NPV	Evaluation	
	
The	Net	Present	Value	of	the	project	at	a	discount	rate	of	7.5	%	per	annum	is	$3.95	Million	(Table	23‐5).

23.7.1 	INTRODUCTION	

	
The	North	Point	Gold	Deposit	 is	a	 seasonal	producer	 for	Crocodile	Gold.	 	 It	produced	during	 the	dry	season	 in	
2010.	Access	to	the	mine	with	heavy	equipment	is	impassable	during	the	wet	season	due	to	a	dry	weather	only	
access.	The	mine	will	have	 the	 remaining	ore	extracted	during	 the	2011	dry	 season.	 	 It	 is	 adjacent	 to	Princess	
Louise	Deposit	and	will	be	mined	in	conjunction	with	Princess	Louise.	
	

23.7.2 	MINING	

	
 Surface	infrastructure	

Temporary	workshop	areas	are	in	place	at	North	Point.		The	pit	needs	to	be	dewatered	at	the	end	of	the	
wet	season	with	1‐2	weeks	of	pumping	required	until		mining	can	recommence.

 Office		

Administration	 will	 be	 managed	 from	 the	 existing	 office	 facilities	 at	 the	 Howley	 Mine	 Site,	 and	 will	
accommodate	 management,	 administration	 and	 technical	 staff.	 The	 small	 nature	 and	 short	 life	 span	
doesn't	warrant	setting	up	any	infrastructure	on	site.		
	

 Camp	Facilities	
Employees	and	contractors	conducting	work	at	North	Point	Mine	Site	will	be	accommodated	at	the	Cosmo	
Single	 Persons'	 Quarters	 (Cosmo	 SPQ).	 The	 Cosmo	 SPQ	 is	 approximately	 25km	 from	 the	minesite	 and	
consists	of	approximately	250	rooms,	a	swimming	pool,	gym,	recreational	areas,	wet	mess	and	barbeque	
facilities.	
	
Some	local	personnel,	however	opt	to	live	in	private	residences	in	Pine	Creek,	Adelaide	River	or	Katherine,	
and	commute	to	the	mine	sites.	

	
Capital	Costs	
	
There	is	no	capital	required	for	the	recommencement	of	North	Point	as	it	was	mined	last	dry	season.	Some	minor	
road	works	are	envisage	after	the	wet	season,	less	than	$10,000	and	has	just	been	left	as	an	operating	expense.	
	
Mining	Method	
	
The	North	Point	Deposit	will	be	and	has	been	contractor	mined	using	drill	and	blast	and	load	and	haul	open	pit	
mining	techniques.		The	blasted	ore	will	be	excavated,	loaded	onto	trucks	and	hauled	to	a	nearby	ore	pad	where	it	
is	stockpiled	and	readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	
	
Detailed	grade	control	activities	such	as	drilling,	sampling	and	bench	mapping	will	minimize	mining	dilution	and	
maximize	ore	recovery.	
	
	
	
Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

An	estimated	24	liters	per	second	is	predicted	to	flow	from	groundwater	in	the	North	Point	pit.		This	will	reduce	
over	 time	as	 the	water	 table	 is	drawn	down.	 	This	combined	with	rainfall	and	access	constraints	will	make	the	
mining	of	North	Point	difficult	during	the	wet	season.	The	ground	water	flow	rates	are	at	a	low	head	as	the	pit	is	
relatively	shallow	and	is	well	within	pumping	capabilities.	
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade

Previous	processing	of	North	Point	ore	through	the	Union	Reefs	plant	in	2008	and	again	in	2010	returned	gold	
recoveries	in	the	range	of	90%	to	95%.	Reagent	consumptions	were	reported	as	low.	Ore	recovery	was	assumed	
to	be	92%	for	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	North	Point.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	schedule	has	been	based	on	extracting	 the	 remainder	of	Northpoint	ore	as	quickly	as	possible.	 	There	 is	 a	
total	of	3	months	of	mining	to	complete	the	North	Point	Pit.

	 	 Australia	
	

[396]	
	

	
Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	

Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	will	be	minimized	by	assessing,	identifying,	measuring	and	
controlling	 acid	 rock	 drainage	 from	 mining	 operations	 utilizing	 encapsulation,	 diversion	 of	 any	 potentially	
detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	methodologies.	

	
Risk	Analysis	
	
The	following	potential	risks	are	associated	with	the	North	Point	Deposit:	

 Geological	Model	Accuracy	and	Grade	Control	Requirements	
 Performance	of	mining	method	as	expected	
 Geology	/	Drilling	of	further	resource

Recovery	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery:	92%		
	
Cost	Estimates	
	
The	total	costs	of	the	North	Point	project	are	estimated	at	$2.5M.		The	unit	cost	of	ore	treated	including	capital	is	
$44	per	tonne	of	ore	or	$686/oz.			
	
Mining	Costs	
Mining	costs	are	estimated	at	$16	per	tonne	for	the	North	Point	Pit	based	on	the	historical	costs	and	the	Open	Pit	
Mining	Contract	with	G&K	Akers.	
	
Haulage	Costs	
The	North	Point	mine	is	85	km	by	road	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	The	North	Point	haulage	estimate	has	
been	derived	from	the	existing	contract.		A	cost	per	tonne	hauled	including	road	maintenance	and	the	ROM	pad	
loader	feeding	the	mill	is	$8.20	per	tonne.		
	
Processing	Costs	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	estimated	as	the	cost	of	treating	the	ore	at	Union	Reef's	Processing	Plant	and	
was	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	North	Point.		
	
Administration	Costs	
The	Administration	 costs	have	been	 estimated	 from	 first	principles	by	 calculating	 the	 total	 administration	and	
overhead	costs	 for	 the	 sites.	The	 total	Administration	cost	 for	 the	North	Point	mine	 is	 estimated	at	$4	per	ore	
tonne	 produced	 or	 $75k	 per	 month.	 	 This	 estimate	 includes	 all	 overheads	 that	 are	 not	 specifically	 costed	
elsewhere,	such	as:	
	

 Technical	Staff	/	Supervision	
 Accommodation	and	Messing	
 Insurances		
 Payroll	
 Central	Services	

	
	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
There	are	no	royalties	payable	for	the	North	Point	ore.	
	
Revenue	
	
Based	on	a	gold	price	of	$US1000/oz	and	a	92%	mill	recovery	from	the	ounces	mined,	total	revenue	is	estimated	
at	$4M.		Note	that	current	spot	prices	are	significantly	higher	than	this	and	the	short	term	nature	of	the	project	3	
months	could	aid	in	realizing	these	current	high	values.	
	
NPV	Evaluation	
	
The	Net	Present	Value	of	the	project	at	a	discount	rate	of	7.5	%	per	annum	is	$1.4M	(Table	23‐6).

23.8 PRINCESS	LOUISE 	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	

23.8.1 	INTRODUCTION	

	
The	Princess	Louise	Gold	Deposit	is	a	seasonal	producer	for	Crocodile	Gold.		It	produced	during	the	dry	season	in	
2010.	Access	to	the	mine	with	heavy	equipment	is	impassable	during	the	wet	season	due	to	a	dry	weather	only	
access.	The	mine	will	have	the	remaining	ore	extracted	during	the	2011	dry	season.		It	is	adjacent	to	North	Point	
and	will	be	mined	in	conjunction	with	this	pit.	
	

23.8.2 	MINING	

	
 Surface	infrastructure	

All	surface	infrastructure	is	in	place	with	ROM	Pads	and	waste	dumps.	 	The	waste	dump	will	need	to	be	
extended	during	2011	but	this	will	occur	in	conjunction	with	mining.		
	

 Office		
Administration	 will	 be	 managed	 from	 the	 existing	 office	 facilities	 at	 the	 Howley	 Mine	 Site,	 and	 will	
accommodate	 management,	 administration	 and	 technical	 staff.	 The	 small	 nature	 and	 short	 life	 span	
doesn't	warrant	setting	up	anything	on	site.		
	

 Camp	Facilities	
Employees	 and	 contractors	 conducting	work	at	Princess	Louise	Mine	Site	will	 be	 accommodated	at	 the	
Cosmo	Single	Persons'	Quarters	(Cosmo	SPQ).	The	Cosmo	SPQ	is	approximately	25km	from	the	minesite	
and	 consists	 of	 approximately	 250	 rooms,	 a	 swimming	 pool,	 gym,	 recreational	 areas,	 wet	 mess	 and	
barbeque	facilities.	
	
Some	local	personnel,	however	opt	to	live	in	private	residences	in	Pine	Creek,	Adelaide	River	or	Katherine,	
and	commute	to	the	mine	sites.	

	
Capital	Costs	
	
There	is	no	capital	required	for	the	recommencement	of	Princess	Louise	as	 it	was	mined	last	dry	season.	Some	
minor	road	works	are	envisage	after	the	wet	season	less	than	$10,000	and	has	just	been	left	as	operating	expense.	
	
Mining	Method	
	
The	Princess	Louise	Deposit	will	be	and	has	been	contractor	mined	using	drill	and	blast	and	load	and	haul	open	
pit	mining	 techniques.	 	 The	 blasted	 ore	will	 be	 excavated,	 loaded	onto	 trucks	 and	hauled	 to	 a	 nearby	 ore	 pad	
where	it	is	stockpiled	and	readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.

Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

Princess	 Louise	 is	 the	mining	 of	 the	 top	 of	 a	 ridge	 and	hence	 it	 is	 envisage	 that	water	 flows	will	 be	 very	 low.		
Dewatering	will	be	to	a	settling	/	evaporation	pond.	
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Previous	processing	of	Princess	Louise	ore	 through	 the	Union	Reefs	plant	 in	2008	and	again	 in	2010	returned	
gold	 recoveries	 in	 the	 range	 of	 90%	 to	 95%.	 Reagent	 consumptions	were	 reported	 as	 low.	 Ore	 recovery	was	
assumed	to	be	92%	for	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	Princess	Louise.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	schedule	has	been	based	on	extracting	the	remainder	of	Princess	Louise	ore	as	quickly	as	possible.		There	is	a	
total	of	4	months	of	 	mining	to	complete	the	Princess	Louise	Pit.	It	may	be	extended	with	further	grade	control	
and	resource	drilling	as	the	deposit	is	open	at	depth.

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

	
 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	

Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

	
 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	

The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

	
 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	

Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	

Effects	on	 soil,	 groundwater	 and	 surface	water	quality	will	 be	minimized	by	 assessing,	 identifying,	measuring	
and	controlling	acid	rock	drainage	from	mining	operations	utilizing	encapsulation,	diversion	of	any	potentially	
detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	methodologies.	

	
Risk	Analysis	
	
The	following	potential	risks	are	associated	with	the	Princess	Louise	Deposit:	

 Geological	Model	Accuracy	and	Grade	Control	Requirements	
 Performance	of	mining	method	as	expected	
 Geology	/	Drilling	of	further	resource

Recovery	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery:	92%		
	
Cost	Estimates	
	
The	total	costs	of	the	Princess	Louise	project	are	estimated	at	$9.3M.		The	unit	cost	of	ore	treated	including	capital	
is	$47	per	tonne	of	ore	or	$1040/oz.			
	
Mining	Costs	
Mining	costs	are	estimated	at	$19.10	per	tonne	for	the	Princess	Louise	Pit	based	on	the	historical	costs	and	the	
Open	Pit	Mining	Contract	with	G&K	Akers.	
	
Haulage	Costs	
The	 Princess	 Louise	mine	 is	 85	 km	by	 road	 to	 the	Union	Reefs	 processing	 plant.	 The	 Princess	 Louise	 haulage	
estimate	has	been	derived	from	the	existing	contract.	 	A	cost	per	tonne	hauled	including	road	maintenance	and	
the	ROM	pad	loader	feeding	the	mill	is	$8.20	per	tonne.		
	
Processing	Costs	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	estimated	as	the	cost	of	treating	the	ore	at	Union	Reef's	Processing	Plant	and	
was	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	Princess	Louise.		
	
Administration	Costs	
The	Administration	 costs	have	been	 estimated	 from	 first	principles	by	 calculating	 the	 total	 administration	and	
overhead	costs	for	the	sites.	The	total	Administration	cost	for	the	Princess	Louise	mine	is	estimated	at	$4	per	ore	
tonne	produced	or	an	average	$200k	per	month.	 	This	estimate	 includes	all	overheads	 that	are	not	specifically	
costed	elsewhere,	such	as:	
	

 Technical	Staff	/	Supervision	
 Accommodation	and	Messing	
 Insurances		
 Payroll	
 Central	Services	

	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
There	are	no	royalties	payable	for	the	Princess	Louise	ore.	
	
Revenue	
	
Based	on	a	gold	price	of	$US1000/oz	and	a	92%	mill	recovery	from	the	ounces	mined,	total	revenue	is	estimated	
at	$9.9M.		Note	that	current	spot	prices	are	significantly	higher	than	this	and	the	short	term	nature	of	the	project	
3	months	could	aid	in	realizing	these	current	high	values.	It	could	be	stopped	or	started	with	ease	if	there	were	
changes	in	Gold	price.	
	
NPV	Evaluation	
	
The	Net	Present	Value	of	the	project	at	a	discount	rate	of	7.5	%	per	annum	is	$0.5M	(Table	23‐7).

23.9 	MOTTRAMS	GOLD	DEPOSIT	

	

23.9.1 	INTRODUCTION	

	
The	Mottrams	 Gold	 Deposit	 commenced	 operations	 in	 December	 2010.	 	 It	 is	 directly	 adjacent	 to	 the	 Howley	
Operation	 and	 is	 mined	 in	 conjunction	 with	 this	 pit.	 The	 capital	 costs	 of	 this	 project	 due	 to	 shared	 Howley	
resources	were	very	small	when	initially	setup.	Mottrams	provides	valuable	mill	feed.	It	provides	modest	returns	
at	the	$1100/oz	gold	price	but	at	the	current	spot	price	is	a	solid	contributor.		It	has	the	ability	to	be	started	and	
stopped	with	gold	price	fluctuations.	
	

23.9.2 	MINING	

	
 Surface	infrastructure	

All	surface	infrastructure	is	in	place	with	ROM	Pads	and	waste	dumps.				
	

 Office		
Administration	 will	 be	 managed	 from	 the	 existing	 office	 facilities	 at	 the	 Howley	 Mine	 Site,	 and	 will	
accommodate	 management,	 administration	 and	 technical	 staff.	 The	 small	 nature	 and	 short	 life	 span	
doesn't	warrant	setting	up	anything	on	site.		
	

 Camp	Facilities	
Employees	and	contractors	conducting	work	at	Mottrams	Mine	Site	will	be	accommodated	at	the	Cosmo	
Single	 Persons'	 Quarters	 (Cosmo	 SPQ).	 The	 Cosmo	 SPQ	 is	 approximately	 25km	 from	 the	minesite	 and	
consists	of	approximately	250	rooms,	a	swimming	pool,	gym,	recreational	areas,	wet	mess	and	barbeque	
facilities.	
	
Some	local	personnel,	however,	are	expected	to	opt	to	 live	in	private	residences	in	Pine	Creek,	Adelaide	
River	or	Katherine,	and	will	commute	to	the	mine	sites.	

	
Capital	Costs	
	
There	is	no	capital	required	for	the	recommencement	of	Mottrams	as	it	currently	being	mined.		
	
Mining	Method	
	
The	Mottrams	Deposit	will	be	 and	has	been	contractor	mined	using	drill	 and	blast	 and	 load	and	haul	open	pit	
mining	techniques.		The	blasted	ore	will	be	excavated,	loaded	onto	trucks	and	hauled	to	a	nearby	ore	pad	where	it	
is	stockpiled	and	readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	
	
Detailed	grade	control	activities	such	as	drilling,	sampling	and	bench	mapping	will	minimize	mining	dilution	and	
maximize	ore	recovery.

Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

Mottrams	 is	 located	directly	 to	 the	north	of	 the	Howley	Mine.	 	 It	 is	anticipated	that	Mottrams	will	have	similar	
dewatering	requirements	to	Howley.		It	will	also	share	the	existing	infrastructure	with	the	Howley	Mine	such	as	
evaporation	dams.	
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade

FIGURE	23‐35	CROSS	SECTION	THROUGH	MOTTRAMS	PIT	

	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Previous	 processing	 of	Mottrams	 ore	 through	 the	Union	Reefs	 plant	 in	 2008	 and	 again	 in	 2010	 returned	 gold	
recoveries	in	the	range	of	90%	to	95%.	Reagent	consumptions	were	reported	as	low.	Ore	recovery	was	assumed	
to	be	92%	for	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	Mottrams.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	schedule	has	been	based	on	extracting	the	remainder	of	Mottrams	ore	as	quickly	as	possible.		There	is	a	total	
of	4	months	of		mining	to	complete	the	Mottrams	Pit.	It	may	be	extended	with	further	grade	control	and	resource	
drilling	as	the	deposit	is	open	at	depth.

Only	 minimum	 site	 infrastructure	 is	 required	 to	 safely	 and	 efficiently	 conduct	 mining	 at	 Gandy's.	 Additional	
facilities	 for	 staff	 and	 contractors	 are	 shared	 between	 the	 Brocks	 Creek,	 Cosmo	 and	 Gandy's	 mines	 and	
apportioned	costs	are	included	in	operating	cost	estimates	below.	
	

 Power	
Electrical	 power	 supply	 to	 the	 mining	 operations	 and	 associated	 infrastructure	 will	 be	 from	 NT	
PowerWater	 via	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Grid.	 Power	 lines	 are	 present	 on	 access	 roads	 from	 Pine	 Creek	 to	 the	
Crocodile	Gold		mining	tenements.	

	
 Workshops	

It	 is	envisaged	 that	service	 facilities	would	be	shared	between	 the	 individual	Crocodile	Gold	mine	sites.	
Mobile	 workshops	 will	 need	 to	 be	 erected	 for	 the	 servicing	 of	 equipment	 at	 points	 agreed	 to	 by	 the	
principal	and	the	contractor.		
	

 Office		
Administration	will	be	managed	from	the	existing	office	facilities	at	the	Brocks	Creek	Mine	Site,	and	will	
accommodate	management,	administration	and	technical	staff.	All	telephone,	data	and	office	facilities	exist	
at	the	Brocks	Creek	offices.		Part	of	these	office	facilities	will	be	allocated	to	the	contractor.			

	
 Camp	Facilities	

Employees	and	contractors	conducting	work	at	Gandy's	Mine	Site	will	be	accommodated	at	the	Pine	Creek	
Single	Persons'	Quarters	(Pine	Creek	SPQ).	The	Pine	Creek	SPQ	is	located	to	the	North	of	the	town	centre	
which	 is	approximately	1km	from	the	minesite.	The	SPQ	consists	of	104	single	air‐conditioned,	en‐suite	
rooms,	a	swimming	pool,	gym,	recreational	areas,	wet	mess	and	barbeque	facilities.	

	
Some	local	personnel,	however,	are	expected	to	opt	to	 live	in	private	residences	in	Pine	Creek,	Adelaide	
River	or	Katherine,	and	will	commute	to	the	mine	sites.

Mining	Method	
	
Gandy's	mine	will	be	contractor	mined	using	drill	and	blast	and	load	and	haul	open	pit	mining	techniques.	 	The	
blasted	 ore	 will	 be	 excavated,	 loaded	 onto	 trucks	 and	 hauled	 to	 a	 nearby	 ore	 pad	where	 it	 is	 stockpiled	 and	
readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	An	opportunity	exists	to	use	waste	rock	
produced	by	the	South	Enterprise	mine	to	rehabilitate	historical	mine	workings.	
	
Detailed	grade	control	activities	such	as	drilling,	sampling	and	bench	mapping	will	minimize	mining	dilution	and	
maximize	ore	recovery.

Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

No	hydrogeological	studies	have	been	undertaken	at	Gandy's,	however,	the	Enterprise	Mine	to	the	North,	which	
was	developed	 in	 the	 same	 geological	 structures	 and	under	 similar	 climatic	 conditions	without	 any	 significant	
water	problems.	
	
Geotechnical	

No	geotechnical	studies	have	been	undertaken	at	Gandy's,	however,	the	Enterprise	Mine	to	the	North,	which	was	
a	 much	 larger	 operation	 was	 developed	 in	 the	 same	 geological	 structures	 and	 at	 greater	 depth	 without	 any	
significant	structural	problems.	
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade.		
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Previous	processing	of	Gandy's	ore	through	the	Union	Reefs	Mill	is	expected	to	return	gold	recoveries	in	the	range	
of	87%	to	95%.	Ore	recovery	was	assumed	to	be	90%	from	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	South	Enterprise.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	schedule	has	been	based	on	an	average	of	549,000	 tonnes	or	244,000	BCM	of	material	moved	per	month.	
Approximately	75,000t	of	ore	is	produced	in	the	first	two	months	of	mining	while	the	North	wall	of	the	existing	
pit	 is	 stripped	 and	 waste	 stripping	 commences	 in	 the	 South.	 	 Ore	 in	 the	 North	 will	 be	 depleted	 before	 the	
Southern	waste	stripping	is	completed,	resulting	in	a	month	of	negligible	ore	production.	The	final	three	months	
of	mining	produces	402,000t	of	ore	(Figure	23‐43,	Figure	23‐44).

Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	
 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	

acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	
 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	
 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	
 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	

	
Impact	management	plan	
Potential	environmental	impact	management	programs	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	
Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	
Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	will	be	minimized	by	assessing,	identifying,	measuring	and	
controlling	 acid	 rock	 drainage	 from	 mining	 operations	 utilizing	 encapsulation,	 diversion	 of	 any	 potentially	
detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	methodologies.

Gold	Price	
	
$US1000/oz	
	
Exchange	Rate	
	
$A:$US::0.91:1	
	
Recovery	
	
Metallurgical	Recovery:	90%		
	
Cost	Estimates	
	
The	total	costs	of	the	Gandy's	project	are	estimated	at	$14.0M.		The	unit	cost	of	ore	treated	including	capital	is	$29	
per	tonne	of	ore	or	$612/oz.			
	
Mining	Costs	
Mining	costs	are	estimated	at	$1.83	per	tonne	for	the	Gandy's	Pit	based	on	the	June	2009	Open	Pit	Mining	tenders.	
	
Haulage	Costs	
The	Gandy's	mine	is	approximately	15km	by	road	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	A	new	haulage	contract	has	
been	tendered	and	the	cost	for	haulage,	road	maintenance	and	feeding	the	mill	is	$5.70/t	from	Gandy's.	
	
Processing	Costs	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	estimated	as	the	cost	of	treating	the	ore	at	Union	Reef's	Processing	Plant	and	
was	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	Gandy's	mine.		
	
Administration	Costs	
The	Administration	 costs	have	been	 estimated	 from	 first	principles	by	 calculating	 the	 total	 administration	 and	
overhead	costs	for	the	sites.	The	total	Administration	cost	for	the	Gandy's	mine	is	estimated	at	$5.87	per	tonne	of	
ore.		This	estimate	includes	all	overheads	that	are	not	specifically	costed	elsewhere,	such	as:	
	

 Technical	Staff	/	Supervision	
 Accommodation	and	Messing	
 Insurances		
 Payroll	
 Central	Services	

	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
There	is	$4/oz		royalty	payable	on	the	Gandy's	Gold	Deposit.		This	has	been	taken	off	all	revenue	calculations.

grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade.		
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Processing	of	South	Enterprise	ore	through	the	Union	Reefs	Mill	is	expected	to	return	gold	recoveries	in	the	range	
of	87%	to	95%.	Ore	recovery	was	assumed	to	be	90%	for	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	South	Enterprise.

Potential	environmental	impacts		
Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	
 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	

acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	
 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	
 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	
 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	

Impact	management	plan	
Potential	environmental	impact	management	programs	include:	

 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	
Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	
Effects	 on	 soil,	 groundwater	 and	 surface	 water	 quality	 will	 be	 minimized	 by	 assessing,	 identifying,	
measuring	and	controlling	acid	rock	drainage	from	mining	operations	utilizing	encapsulation,	diversion	
of	any	potentially	detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	
methodologies.

Development	Requirements	
	
Proposed	infrastructural	developments	for	the	International	mine	include	the	expansion	of	the	new	pit,	the	ROM	
Pad	and	waste	rock	dump.	
	
Ancillary	 mine	 plan	 components	 include	 haul	 roads	 connecting	 the	 pits	 and	 mine	 workings	 with	 waste	 rock	
dumps,	ROM	pads,	site	office	and	access	roads.

23.13 	COX 	DEPOSIT		

	

23.13.1 		INTRODUCTION	

	
The	Cox	deposit	will	share	infrastructure	with	other	Pine	Creek	deposits.		The	only	existing	infrastructure	in	the	
Pine	Creek	Leases	is	an	unused	core	storage	shed	and	the	Pine	Creek	office.		The	returns	on	Cox	are	break	even	at	
the	$1100/oz	gold	price	but	dramatically	improve	with	the	higher	current	gold	prices.		Cox	is	not	planned	to	be	
mined	in	the	next	12	months	as	higher	margin	ore	will	be	sourced	first.	
	

23.13.2 	MINING	

	
Development	Requirements	
	
Proposed	infrastructural	developments	for	the	Cox	mine	include	the	expansion	of	the	new	pit,	the	ROM	Pad	and	
waste	rock	dump.	
	
Ancillary	 mine	 plan	 components	 include	 haul	 roads	 connecting	 the	 pits	 and	 mine	 workings	 with	 waste	 rock	
dumps,	ROM	pads,	site	office	and	access	roads.	
	
Only	minimum	site	infrastructure	is	required	to	safely	and	efficiently	conduct	mining	at	Cox.		
	

 Power	
Electrical	 power	 supply	 to	 the	 mining	 operations	 and	 associated	 infrastructure	 will	 be	 from	 NT	
PowerWater	 via	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Grid.	 Power	 lines	 are	 present	 on	 access	 roads	 from	 Pine	 Creek	 to	 the	
Crocodile	Gold		mining	tenements.	

	
 Workshops	

It	 is	envisaged	that	service	facilities	would	be	shared	between	the	Pine	Creek	Crocodile	Gold	mine	sites.	
Mobile	 workshops	 will	 need	 to	 be	 erected	 for	 the	 servicing	 of	 equipment	 at	 points	 agreed	 to	 by	 the	
principal	and	the	contractor.	These	are	at	the	contractors	expense	
	

 Office		
Administration	will	be	managed	from	the	existing	office	facilities	at	the	Pine	Creek,	and	will	accommodate	
management,	administration	and	technical	staff.	All	 telephone,	data	and	office	 facilities	exist	at	 the	Pine	
Creek	offices.			

	
 Camp	Facilities	

Employees	 and	 contractors	 conducting	work	 at	 Cox	Mine	 Site	will	 be	 accommodated	 at	 the	Pine	Creek	
Single	Persons'	Quarters	(Pine	Creek	SPQ).	The	Pine	Creek	SPQ	is	located	to	the	North	of	the	town	centre	
which	 is	approximately	1km	from	the	minesite.	The	SPQ	consists	of	104	single	air‐conditioned,	en‐suite	
rooms,	a	swimming	pool,	gym,	recreational	areas,	wet	mess	and	barbeque	facilities.

Some	local	personnel,	however,	are	expected	to	opt	to	 live	in	private	residences	in	Pine	Creek,	Adelaide	
River	or	Katherine,	and	will	commute	to	the	mine	sites.	

	
Capital	Costs	
	
Initial	capital	costs	associated	with	recommencement	of	mining	are	shown	below	(Table	23‐15).

TABLE	23‐15	COX	GOLD	DEPOSIT	–	REQUIRED	CAPITAL	

	
Mining	Method	
	
Cox	mine	 will	 be	 contractor	mined	 using	 drill	 and	 blast	 and	 load	 and	 haul	 open	 pit	 mining	 techniques.	 	 The	
blasted	 ore	 will	 be	 excavated,	 loaded	 onto	 trucks	 and	 hauled	 to	 a	 nearby	 ore	 pad	where	 it	 is	 stockpiled	 and	
readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	An	opportunity	exists	to	use	waste	rock	
produced	by	the	Cox	mine	to	rehabilitate	historical	mine	workings.	
	
Detailed	grade	control	activities	such	as	drilling,	sampling	and	bench	mapping	will	minimize	mining	dilution	and	
maximize	ore	recovery.

Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

No	hydro‐geological	 studies	have	been	undertaken	at	Cox,	however,	 the	Enterprise	Mine	 to	 the	northwest	was	
mined	 in	 the	 same	 geological	 structures	 and	 under	 similar	 climatic	 conditions	 without	 any	 significant	 water	
problems.	The	Cox	deposit	also	is	situated	on	a	ridge	in	an	elevated	position.			
	
Geotechnical	

The	geotechnical	pit	slopes	have	been	based	on	the	historical	mining	in	the	region	in	the	same	rock	types.		These	
have	been	in	place	for	a	long	period	time	with	no	major	failures.		The	pit	slopes	will	be	reviewed	throughout	the	
project	by	the	Geotechnical	Engineer.		
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade.		
	
Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Previous	processing	of	Cox	ore	through	the	Union	Reefs	Mill	is	expected	to	return	gold	recoveries	in	the	range	of	
87%	to	95%.	Ore	recovery	was	assumed	to	be	90%	for	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	South	Enterprise.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	 schedule	 has	 been	 based	 on	 an	 average	 180,000	BCM	 of	material	moved	 per	month.	 The	 average	 40,000	
tonnes	of	 ore	will	 be	produced	per	month.	 	 The	operation	 is	 planned	 to	have	one	 excavator	 and	 a	 small	 fleet.		
(Figure	23‐60,	Figure	23‐61).	These	rates	have	been	based	on	productivities	at	other	Crocodile	Gold	Pits.

The	Cox	project	is	an	open‐pit	mining	operation	that	will	be	serviced	by	remote	and	latterly	site	located	processing	
facilities.	

Potential	environmental	impacts		

Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	
 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	
 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	

acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	
 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna.	
 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	
 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.	

Impact	management	plan	
Potential	environmental	impact	management	programs	include:	

	
 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	

Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	
Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	will	be	minimized	by	assessing,	identifying,	measuring	and	
controlling	 acid	 rock	 drainage	 from	 mining	 operations	 utilizing	 encapsulation,	 diversion	 of	 any	 potentially	
detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	methodologies.

23.14.1 	INTRODUCTION	

	
The	Kohinoor	deposit	is	located	directly	to	the	south	of	the	Cox	deposit.		It	is	anticipated	it	would	share	existing	
infrastructure	with	other	mining	in	the	region.		Kohinoor	has	higher	grades	than	other	deposits	in	the	area.				
	

23.14.2 	MINING	

	
Development	Requirements	
	
Proposed	infrastructural	developments	for	the	Kohinoor	mine	include	the	expansion	of	the	new	pit,	the	ROM	Pad	
and	waste	rock	dump.	
	
Ancillary	 mine	 plan	 components	 include	 haul	 roads	 connecting	 the	 pits	 and	 mine	 workings	 with	 waste	 rock	
dumps,	ROM	pads,	site	office	and	access	roads.	
	
Only	minimum	site	infrastructure	is	required	to	safely	and	efficiently	conduct	mining	at	Kohinoor.

 Power	

Electrical	 power	 supply	 to	 the	 mining	 operations	 and	 associated	 infrastructure	 will	 be	 from	 NT	
PowerWater	 via	 the	 Pine	 Creek	 Grid.	 Power	 lines	 are	 present	 on	 access	 roads	 from	 Pine	 Creek	 to	 the	
Crocodile	Gold		mining	tenements.	

	
 Workshops	

It	 is	envisaged	that	service	facilities	would	be	shared	between	the	Pine	Creek	Crocodile	Gold	mine	sites.	
Mobile	 workshops	 will	 need	 to	 be	 erected	 for	 the	 servicing	 of	 equipment	 at	 points	 agreed	 to	 by	 the	
principal	and	the	contractor.	These	are	at	the	contractors	expense	
	

 Office		
Administration	will	be	managed	from	the	existing	office	facilities	at	the	Pine	Creek,	and	will	accommodate	
management,	administration	and	technical	staff.	All	 telephone,	data	and	office	 facilities	exist	at	 the	Pine	
Creek	offices.			

	
 Camp	Facilities	

Employees	 and	 contractors	 conducting	work	 at	 Kohinoor	Mine	 Site	will	 be	 accommodated	 at	 the	 Pine	
Creek	Single	Persons'	Quarters	(Pine	Creek	SPQ).	The	Pine	Creek	SPQ	is	located	to	the	North	of	the	town	
centre	which	is	approximately	1km	from	the	minesite.	The	SPQ	consists	of	104	single	air‐conditioned,	en‐
suite	rooms,	a	swimming	pool,	gym,	recreational	areas,	wet	mess	and	barbeque	facilities.	

	
Some	local	personnel,	however,	are	expected	to	opt	to	 live	in	private	residences	in	Pine	Creek,	Adelaide	
River	or	Katherine,	and	will	commute	to	the	mine	sites.	

	
	
	
Capital	Costs	
	
Initial	capital	costs	associated	with	recommencement	of	mining	are	shown	below	(Table	23‐17).

TABLE	23‐17	KOHINOOR	GOLD	DEPOSIT	–	REQUIRED	CAPITAL	

	
Mining	Method	
	
The	Kohinoor	mine	will	be	contractor	mined	using	drill	and	blast	and	load	and	haul	open	pit	mining	techniques.		
The	blasted	ore	will	be	excavated,	loaded	onto	trucks	and	hauled	to	a	nearby	ore	pad	where	it	is	stockpiled	and	
readied	for	loading	and	road	haulage	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	An	opportunity	exists	to	use	waste	rock	
produced	by	the	Kohinoor	mine	to	rehabilitate	historical	mine	workings.	
	
Detailed	grade	control	activities	such	as	drilling,	sampling	and	bench	mapping	will	minimize	mining	dilution	and	
maximize	ore	recovery.

Dewatering	/	Hydrogeology		

No	hydro‐geological	studies	have	been	undertaken	at	Kohinoor,	however,	the	Enterprise	Mine	to	the	northwest	
was	mined	in	the	same	geological	structures	and	under	similar	climatic	conditions	without	any	significant	water	
problems.	The	Cox	deposit	also	is	situated	on	a	ridge	in	an	elevated	position.			
	

Geotechnical	

The	geotechnical	pit	slopes	have	been	based	on	the	historical	mining	of	Kohinoor.		These	have	been	in	place	for	a	
long	 period	 time	 with	 no	 major	 failures.	 	 The	 pit	 slopes	 will	 be	 reviewed	 throughout	 the	 project	 by	 the	
Geotechnical	Engineer.		
	
Mining	Dilution	
	
Dilution	 has	 been	 estimated	 as	 an	 addition	 of	waste	 equivalent	 to	 15%	 of	 scheduled	 ore	 production	 from	 the	
block	model.	 	 A	 zero	 grade	has	 been	 assumed	 for	 the	waste	 dilution	 resulting	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 scheduled	ore	
grade.		
	
Mining	Losses	
	
Mining	loss	has	been	estimated	at	5%	of	total	ore	produced	at	the	diluted	grade.

Metallurgical	Recovery	
	
Previous	processing	of	Kohinoor	ore	 through	 the	Union	Reefs	Mill	 is	 expected	 to	 return	gold	 recoveries	 in	 the	
range	of	87%	to	95%.	Ore	recovery	was	assumed	to	be	90%	for	the	calculation	of	ore	reserves	for	Kohinoor.	
	
Production	Schedule	
	
The	schedule	has	been	based	on	an	average	180,000	BCM	of	material	moved	per	month.	An	average	of	400,000	
tonnes	of	 ore	will	 be	produced	per	month.	 	 The	operation	 is	 planned	 to	have	one	 excavator	 and	 a	 small	 fleet.

Environmental	Considerations	
The	Kohinoor	project	is	an	open‐pit	mining	operation	that	will	be	serviced	by	remote	and	latterly	site	located	
processing	facilities.	

Potential	environmental	impacts		

Potential	environmental	impacts	indicated	include:	
 Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development.	
 Excavation	 and	 storage	 of	 potentially	 acid	 forming	materials,	which	may	have	 the	potential	 to	produce	

acid	rock	drainage	(ARD).	
 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	and	the	permanent	relocation	of	a	ghost	bat	colony.		The	ghost	

bats	relocation	would	need	to	be	carried	out	pre	mining.	
 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure.	
 Encroachment	on	archeologically	or	culturally	significant	sites.	
 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality.

May	2011	 	 Northern	Territory	Properties	
	 	 Australia	
	

[457]	
	

Clearing	of	land	for	exploration,	mining	and	process	development	is	inevitable.	Effective	research,	investigation,	
planning	and	management	will	provide	the	appropriate	revegetation	protocols	with	a	view	to	maintaining	or	
enhancing	pre‐event	bio‐diversity.	

	
 Excavation	and	storage	of	potentially	acid	forming	materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	
acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	

Materials,	which	may	have	potential	to	produce	acid	rock	drainage	(ARD)	will	be	identified	and	mapped	for	
managed	stockpile	storage.	Encapsulation	of	potentially	acid	forming	material	is	a	primary	consideration,	as	is	the	
development	of	potential	discharge	diversion	and	catchment	strategies,	which	will	allow	the	effective	control,	
storage	treatment	and	appropriate	reduction	of	risk	potential	products.	

 Temporary	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	
Any	displacement	of	flora	&	fauna	will	be	temporary,	as	systems	and	profiles	will	be	mapped	and	reinstated.	Where	
systems	can	be	enhanced	for	best	possible	practice	focus	will	reflect	appropriate	eco‐diversity.		

 Creation	of	water	inventories	in	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	
The	inevitable	creation	of	increased	site	water	inventories,	storage	facilities	and	infrastructure	will	be	managed	to	
minimize	impact	on	bio‐diversity.	Methodologies	including,	evaporation,	environmentally	sound	flood	irrigation	
and	wetland	development	and	enhancement	programs	will	ensure	water	inventories	are	maintained	at	
appropriate	levels	that	pose	positive	potentials	for	the	environment.	

 Encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	
Potential	encroachment	on	sites	of	archaeological	or	cultural	significance	will	be	avoided	by	effective	planning	and	
cultural	resource	management	policies	facilitated	by	research,	investigation	and	appropriate	consultation	with	
indigenous	custodians,	archaeological	and	anthropological	specialists.	

 Effects	on	soil,	groundwater	and	surface	water	quality	
Effects	 on	 soil,	 groundwater	 and	 surface	 water	 quality	 will	 be	 minimized	 by	 assessing,	 identifying,	
measuring	and	controlling	acid	rock	drainage	from	mining	operations	utilizing	encapsulation,	diversion	
of	any	potentially	detrimental	flows	to	capture,	discharge,	treatment	and	flora	and	biological	polishing	
methodologies.	

Risk	Analysis	
	

 Geotechnical	performance	continuing	as	expected	
 Performance	of	mining	method	as	expected	
 Geology	/	Drilling	of	further	resource	
 Pit	scheduling	to	manage	stripping	ratio

Cost	Estimates	
	
The	total	costs	of	 the	Kohinoor	project	are	estimated	at	$14M.	 	The	unit	cost	of	ore	 treated	 including	capital	 is	
$49per	tonne	of	ore	or	$880/oz.			
	
Mining	Costs	
Mining	costs	are	estimated	at	$	20	per	tonne	for	the	Kohinoor	Pit	based	on	existing	contracts	with	G&K	Akers.		It	
is	also	based	on	historical	Crocodile	Gold	costs	for	mining	for	fuel	and	overheads.		
	
Haulage	Costs	
The	Kohinoor	mine	is	approximately	15km	by	road	to	the	Union	Reefs	processing	plant.	A	new	haulage	contract	
has	been	tendered	and	the	cost	for	haulage,	road	maintenance	and	feeding	the	mill	is	$5.70/t	from	Kohinoor.	
	
Processing	Costs	
A	processing	cost	of	$16/t	has	been	estimated	as	the	cost	of	treating	the	ore	at	Union	Reef's	Processing	Plant	and	
was	used	in	all	cost	models	for	the	Kohinoor	mine.		
	
Administration	Costs	
The	Administration	 costs	have	been	 estimated	 from	 first	principles	by	 calculating	 the	 total	 administration	and	
overhead	costs	for	the	sites.	The	total	Administration	cost	for	the	Kohinoor	mine	is	estimated	at	$4	per	tonne	of	
ore.		This	estimate	includes	all	overheads	that	are	not	specifically	costed	elsewhere,	such	as:	
	

 Insurances		
 Payroll	
 Central	Services	

	
Taxes	&	Royalties	
	
There	is	$4/oz	royalty	payable	on	the	Kohinoor	Gold	Deposit.		This	has	been	taken	off	all	revenue	calculations.	
	
Revenue	
	
Based	on	a	gold	price	of	US$1000/oz	and	a	90%	mill	recovery	from	the	ounces	mined,	total	revenue	is	estimated	
at	$17.6M.			
	
	
NPV	Evaluation	
	
The	Net	Present	Value	of	the	project	at	a	discount	rate	of	7.5	%	per	annum	is	$3.4	Million	(Table	23‐18).

23.15 	MARKETS	

All	the	analysis	has	been	conducted	based	on	the	assumption	that	Crocodile	Gold	will	continue	to	sell	gold	on	the	
spot	market.		Crocodile	Gold	currently	has	no	forward	sales	agreements	for	their	products.		The	gold	price	used	in	
all	 calculations	 ($US975/oz	 for	 Brocks	 Creek	 and	 $US1,000	 for	 all	 other	 deposits)	 is	 at	 a	 discount	 to	 current	
market	prices	to	ensure	conservatism	in	the	estimate.	
	
Gold	doré	will	be	transported	via	a	recognized	security	service	from	the	gold	room	of	the	Union	Reef's	processing	
plant	to	the	gold	refinery	at	the	Perth	Mint	in	the	grounds	of	Perth	International	Airport,	Western	Australia.	
	
Contract	 payments	 and	 terms	 are	 typical	 of	 similar	 contracts	 for	 the	 refining	 and	 sale	 of	 doré	 produced	 from	
other	operations	elsewhere	in	Australia.	

23.16 CONTRACTS	

	
Currently	Crocodile	Gold	has	contracts	in	place	for	its	mining	and	with	key	suppliers	these	are	of	a	Schedule	of	
Rates	nature	i.e.	payment	for	quantity	and	hence	offer	a	relatively	fixed	mining	cost.	The	reagents	contracts	are	to	
ensure	supply	of	critical	reagents	and	consumables	
	

 G&K	Akers	–	Open	Pit	Mining	Contract	(2	year	with	option	of	3rd	‐14	months	completed)	
 GBF	Mining	–	Brocks	Creek	Mining	Contract	(to	completion	of	mine)

Although	a	lot	of	the	deposits	have	mine	life's	that	are	less	than	a	year	there	exists	Inferred	resources	at	each	of	
these	locations	and	resource	drilling	could	improve	the	mine	life	of	any	of	these	deposits.		Cosmo	is	currently	
longest	life	project.	

23.18 COMPARISON	OF	CURRENT	MINERAL	RESERVES	&	PLANNED	MINING	PRACTICES	
TO	HISTORICAL	MINERAL	RESERVES	&	OPERATIONAL	PRACTICES	AND	
PERFORMANCE	

An	analysis	of	the	recent	past	performance	has	contributed	to	the	understanding	of	the	deposits	which	have	been	
mined	and	 conclusions	derived	 from	 this	 information	have	been	 incorporated	 in	 the	 estimation	of	 the	Mineral	
Reserves	(Section	17.3	of	this	report)	and	forward	mine	planning,	where	relevant.

23.19 	EXTRACTION 	OF	MINERAL	RESERVES		

Crocodile	Gold	has	indicated	that	it	intends	to	mine	or	to	commit	capital	to	the	development	of	these	deposits;	no	
other	sources	of	production	are	currently	in	the	Company's	short	term	plan	for	mining.	Other	deposits	are	likely	
therigorous	geological	and	financial	modeling,	and	detailed	mine	planning	is	performed	on	the	deposits	prior	to	
mining.	

23.20 	CROCODILE	GOLD	MANAGEMENT 	STRATEGY	

Comments	 on	 Crocodile	 Gold's	 draft	 Strategic	 Operating	 Plan	 are	 summarized	 in	 Section	 23.1,	 above;	 and	
proposed	Crocodile	Gold	strategies	are	elaborated	upon	below:	
	

23.21 	AUSTRALIAN	BUSINESS	APPROACH		

Centralization	of	 all	 senior	management,	 operational	 and	project	 development	personnel,	 and	 financial	 service	
functions	in	one	office	close	to	the	mining	operations	will	reduce	costs	and	allow	for	more	timely	management	
and	financial	control	of	all	operations.	

The	financial	controls	that	Crocodile	Gold	will	have	in	place	include:	

 Budgeting	System	(Financial	Planning);	
 Authorization	System	through	which	levels	of	authorizaton	for	expenditure	will	be	controlled;	and	
 Purchase	Order	System	through	which	all	purchases	can	be	tracked	and	monitored.	

23.22 	PROJECT	DEVELOPMENT	&	GROWTH	STRATEGY	

Planning	Department	

Crocodile	Gold	have	recognized	a	requirement	for	a	dedicated	Planning	Department		to	provide	a	more	controlled	
development	and	growth	strategy	than	is	perceived	to	have	existed	during	the	GBS	Gold	operations.	

The	department	will	be	 led	by	a	 long	term	planning	manager,	medium	term	planner	and	site	based	short	 term	
Open	Pit	and	Underground	Planning	Engineers.	This	team's	job	will	be	to	work	closely	with	all	departments,	more	
specifically	the	Geology	Department,	Mining	Department	and	the	Financial	Department,	to	optimise	the	resources	
available	to	the	mine	and	ensuring	safe,	profitable	sustainable	plans.	

Cosmo	Deeps	

Crocodile	Gold	is	reviewing	the	historical	Cosmo	Deeps	Feasibility	Study	with	an	aim	to	develop	the	deposit	in	
2011,	potentially	as	a	low	cost	mine	capable	of	producing	80,000	oz/an.
