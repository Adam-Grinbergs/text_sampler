Cautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of 
Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources 

This technical report uses the terms 'measured resources', 'indicated resources' and 'inferred 
resources'. Viceroy advises United States investors that while these terms are recognized and 
required by Canadian regulations (under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure 
for Mineral Projects), the United States Securities and Exchange Commission does not 
recognize them. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of 
the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. In addition, 
'inferred resources' have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and economic and 
legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will 
ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of Inferred Mineral 
Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, or economic studies 
except for a Preliminary Assessment as defined under 43-101. United States investors are 
cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically 
or legally mineable.

TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 6

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

This technical report on the Blackwater Gold Project dated March 2, 2011 has been 
prepared by Geosim Services Inc. ("Geosim") at the request of Richfield Ventures Corp. 
("Richfield") and was filed by Richfield Ventures on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).  The report 
was written in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the 
Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101, Companion Policy 43-
101CP, and Form 43-101F1. In general, the information in this report is current as of 
February 8, 2010.  A mineral resource estimate is provided based upon the current 
geological interpretation and exploration results of the past two years. 

Following the completion of a business transaction on June 1, 2011 and pursuant to a Plan 
of Arrangement ("Arrangement"), New Gold Inc. ("New Gold") which is based in Vancouver 
B.C., Canada acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Richfield, and 
Richfield became a wholly owned subsidiary of New Gold, and ceased trading on the TSX 
Venture Exchange on June 1, 2011.  New Gold has requested that Geosim readdress this 
report to New Gold in order to support its own disclosure.  No changes have been made to 
this report beyond addressing it to New Gold, replacing references to Richfield with 
"Company" and re-dating it.  For the purposes of this report "Company" means New Gold 
and its wholly owned subsidiary Richfield, except for information and actions occurring 
before the Arrangement where references to the Company mean Richfield only. 

1.1 Introduction 

The Blackwater Gold project is on the northern flanks of Mt. Davidson in the Nechako 
Plateau approximately 110 km southwest of the town of Vanderhoof.  The Company 
acquired the property through option agreements with Silver Quest Resources and from 
private individuals in early 2009. 

Mineral claims presently comprising the Blackwater Gold Project are owned by three parties. 
52 of 60 claims are owned 100% by the Company.  The total area of the project tenures is 
23,670 hectares. The mineral tenures that contain the focus of 2009 drilling are under option 
agreement from Silver Quest Resources and from private individuals. 

1.2 Geology and Mineralization 

The property is within a structurally raised block termed the Nechako Uplift that juxtaposes 
older Jurassic arc related rocks (Hazelton and Bowser Lake groups) with younger Eocene 
extensional related rocks (Ootsa Lake and Endako groups).  This uplift provides a direct 
window into the volcanic, volcaniclastic, and sedimentary rocks of the Hazelton and Bowser 
Lake groups.  These stratified rocks are locally intruded by late Cretaceous felsic plutons 
such as the Capoose batholith. The widespread Eocene Ootsa Lake and Endako groups 
overlie these older volcanic and intrusive rocks. The entire package is capped by basalts of 
the Chilcotin Group. 

1.3 Project History 

The Blackwater Project area has been actively explored since the discovery of anomalous 
concentrations of silver, lead, and zinc in silt samples taken from streams draining the Mt. 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 7

Davidson area in 1973 by Granges Inc.  Historic work includes soil geochemistry, 
geophysics (VLF, magnetics and IP), and RC and diamond drilling. 

The Company's Blackwater Gold Project began in 2009 when the company recognized the 
bulk gold potential on the property. In March 2009 the Company optioned the Davidson and 
Dave claims from Silver Quest Resources and the Rozek family respectively. 

1.4 Drill Hole and Assay Database 

The Company's drill hole and assay database is administered from the Vancouver head 
office using Maxwell Geoservices products. Drill hole data logged in the field is entered into 
a LogChief database specifically tailored to the Blackwater Project. LogChief validates this 
data as it is entered, and the final logs are exported and transferred to the database 
administrator in Vancouver for import to DataShed, the master database. Additional data 
validation checks are carried out in DataShed and all logs are checked by the administrator. 

Assay certificates received from EcoTech Labs are delivered in a format specified by the 
Company to allow instant import to Datashed. 

The database is hosted on the Company's server which runs a RAID 5 configuration to 
protect the database from any drive failures. The database is backed up after every major 
data upload and also as part of a weekly backup of the Company's server.  Backups are 
stored off site to avoid any loss of data due to physical damage of the drives. 

1.5 Metallurgical Testing 

Preliminary metallurgical testing on samples from the Blackwater Gold Project was carried 
out on composites from three drill holes drilled in 2009. The work was carried out in early 
2010 by the Metallurgical Division of Inspectorate Exploration and Mining Services Ltd. in 
Richmond BC. 

The samples responded well to direct whole ore cyanidation tests with an average of 92% 
gold recovery across three tests at different conditions on each composite (9 tests in total). 
Accessory silver was recovered at an average of 47%. 

The three composites were also subjected to flotation testing to produce a bulk sulphide 
concentrate under three different grinding and reagent conditions. The samples also 
responded well to this test and the best recoveries obtained under one set of test conditions 
returned an average for the three composites of 94% of the gold and silver reporting to the 
bulk sulphide concentrate. 

The composites were also subjected to direct gravity concentration. The samples responded 
well with the three composites averaging 51% gold recovered into a gravity concentrate. 

1.6 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

Analytical and lithologic data from 77 core holes (25,263 m) was used to develop the 
resource model.  Only assays received since 2005 from 68 holes were used for grade 
interpolation.  Resource estimation was constrained by 3-dimensional solid models 
developed from geological and analytical data.  Grade estimation was carried out by 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 8

ordinary kriging using 5 metre downhole drill composites.  Gold grades were capped at 15 
g/t and Silver grades at 50 g/t prior to compositing.   The mineral resource was also 
constrained by an optimized pit shell using a gold price of $1000 per ounce.  Block 
dimensions were 10 by 10 by 10 metres.   The density values assigned to the main 
lithologies were based on 5,748 bulk density measurements of drill core. 

At a cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t gold, the Blackwater Gold deposit is estimated to contain an 
indicated mineral resource of 53 million tonnes averaging 1.06 g/t Au and 5.6 g/t Ag.  An 
additional 75 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t Au and 4.0 g/t Ag is classified as inferred (Table 
1-1).

Total Company 53,377 1.06 5.6 1.83 63,885 0.97 4.2 2.00 

1.7 Conclusions and Recommendations 

Drilling by the Company since August 2009 has outlined a large, low grade gold-silver 
deposit that extends at least 1040 metres along its longest dimension in an east-west 
direction and at least 580 metres N-S. The thickness of the presently defined zone ranges 
up to 350 metres. 

Results from preliminary metallurgical testing carried out in 2010 showed that the samples 
responded well to direct whole ore cyanidation tests with an average of 92% gold and 47% 
silver recovery.  Preliminary flotation tests suggest that up to 94% gold and silver may report 
to a bulk sulphide concentrate.  Direct gravity concentration tests gave average recoveries 
of 51% gold. 

Sample preparation, security and analysis meets or exceeds industry standards and is 
adequate to support a mineral resource estimate as defined under NI 43-101.  QA/QC with 
respect to the results received to date for the Company's 2009/2010 exploration programs is 
acceptable and protocols have been well documented.  The database contains all core data 
collected on the project to date and has been structured for resource estimation. 

At a cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t gold, the Blackwater Gold deposit is estimated to contain an 
indicated mineral resource of 53 million tonnes averaging 1.06 g/t Au and 5.6 g/t Ag.  An 
additional 75 million tonnes grading 0.96 g/t Au and 4.0 g/t Ag is classified as inferred. 

Two lower grade Au reference standards should be acquired as the ones presently in use 
are over twice the average deposit grade.

TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 15

To perform the exploration work that will cause a physical disturbance, the Company must 
first file, and receive approval of, a Notice of Work and Reclamation as required by Section 
10 of the Mines Act of the Province of British Columbia. The Company currently holds MX-
13-177 which expires 31-12-2012. 

5 Accessibility, Climate, Infrastructure and Physiography 
5.1 Accessibility 

The Blackwater Gold Project is readily accessible by vehicle from the Kluskus-Ootsa forest 
service road originating south of Vanderhoof.  At kilometre 146.5 along this road an 18 km 
mine road built in 1986 by Granges Inc. and improved by the Company provides direct 
easterly access to the property and camp location.  Driving time from Vanderhoof to the 
property is roughly 3 hours and vehicles should be radio equipped. 

Additional road construction and continuation of the mine road from camp in 1991 provides 
further access to the PEM grid and additional historic drill setups.  Helicopter access is from 
bases in Vanderhoof, Quesnel, or Prince George. 

5.2 Local Resources Infrastructure 

The area is very sparsely inhabited; three ranches are found in a 20 km radius. Services are 
available in Vanderhoof, a two and a half hour drive away. Prince George is the regional hub 
with air service from major centres. 

5.3 Physiography 

The Blackwater Gold Project is within the Nechako Plateau, the northernmost region of the 
Interior Plateau physiographic province.  The area is characterized by rolling north to 
northwest trending hills cut by small to medium sized drainages.  The Blackwater Gold 
Project is located on the northern flank of Mt. Davidson with its peak at 1860 m.  Elevations 
on the property range from 1490 to 1820; most current work is focused between 1520 and 
1620 meters.  An extensive veneer of glacial debris covers the project area and bedrock 
exposures are rare and are generally restricted to higher elevations. On the ridge of Mt. 
Davidson outcrop is spotty although there is plenty of broken rock. 

Vegetation in the project area is balsam fir and white spruce with lodgepole pine.   At higher 
elevations vegetation is less dense and dominated by subalpine fir and whitebark pine.  
Tree line is about 1600meters. 

5.4 Climate 

Climate is characterized by brief warm summers and long cold winters.  The area receives 
on average 33 cm of precipitation yearly and temperatures range from a minimum of -40°C 
in winter to a maximum of 32°C in summer.   Snowfall can attain 2 meters at higher 
elevations.   The exploration period is between mid-June and late October.  Year round 
diamond drilling is possible given a suitable supply of water and a winterized camp.

6 HISTORY 

The property was discovered in 1973 during a regional silt geochemical survey which 
located anomalous zinc and other metals in stream sediment east and north of the property. 
Between 1973 and 1985 a range of ground and airborne surveys were conducted to locate 
and delimit mineralization. The nature and volume of the work is detailed in Table 6-1. 
Drilling began in 1985 and was concentrated between 1986 and 1994 with a total of 6300 
metres completed during this period. A further 1332.6 metres of drilling was completed in 
the winter of 2005-06. The focus of the work during this period was on high grade vein 
targets which, at the time, were the only known gold targets in the Nechako Plateau 

The Company's Blackwater Gold Project began in 2009 when the company recognized the 
bulk gold potential on the property. In March 2009 the Company optioned the Davidson and 
Dave claims from Silver Quest Resources and the Rozek family respectively.

not reach target depths. Drilling focused on northern parts of the property. Results of this 
early drilling including drill logs, assays and core have not been located.  

During the 1986 season 34 percussion drill holes were completed for a total 1,524 metres. 
As with data for the earlier drilling, and despite thorough search, the drill logs and assays 
could not be located.  

During 1987 some 22 diamond drill holes (2617.13 m) were completed on the Gold and 
Silver Zones. Drill logs and assay data were filed for assessment and drill core is stored on 
the property. The core was relogged and the data were reviewed by the Company.  

In 1992, 788.5 metres were drilled in five holes focused mainly southwest of the Gold Zone 
and on the Dave claim. Logs and assays were filed for assessment and core is stored on 
the property.  This core was also relogged by the Company.  

Five holes were drilled in 1994 for a total 761.68 metres. The data was filed for assessment 
and the core stored. The data have been reviewed and the core relogged by the Company. 

Silver Quest Resources drilled five holes in 2005 for a total 938.65 metres and another two 
holes in early 2006 for 393.97 metres. The holes were widely dispersed. The later drilling 
focused on the Quest Zone (holes DAV 05-02, DAV 06-06 and DAV 06-07). Cumulative 
drilling to the end of 2006 was 5,810.79 metres in 44 holes. 

Location of historic drilling is listed in Table 6 2.  Significant intercepts are shown in Table 
6-2 Significant intercepts are shown in Table 6-3.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
7.1 Regional Geology 

The Blackwater Gold project is underlain by rocks of the Stikine Terrane within an uplifted 
block termed the Nechako uplift. The Nechako Plateau is an area of moderate relief 
between the Skeena Arch, and the Stikine and Cache Creek terrane contact 

The southern Nechako Plateau near the Blackwater property is underlain by Late Triassic to 
Middle Jurassic island and continental arc assemblages and epicontinental sedimentary 
strata (Diakow et al. 1997).  Near the Blackwater Gold Project, the volcaniclastic Hazelton 
Group represents the Stikine Terrane (Diakow and Levson 1997).  The Hazelton Group has 
a lower unit of felsic tuffs and sediments, named the Entiako Formation and an upper unit of 
felsic to mafic volcanic flows and volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks, termed the Naglico 
Formation (Diakow and Levson 1997).  Rocks of the Stikine Terrane in the southern 
Nechako Plateau are overlain by post-accretion Upper Jurassic volcaniclastic, sedimentary 
and mafic to felsic volcanic rocks of the Bower Lake Group (Diakow and Levson 1997).  The 
Hazelton and Bowser Lake groups in the area are collectively intruded by Late Cretaceous 
granitic to granodioritic plutons (e.g., Capoose batholith) exposed within the Nechako uplift.  

Rocks of the Hazelton and Bowser Lake groups are overlain by Upper Cretaceous and 
Paleocene continental volcanic arc intermediate volcanic rocks and related sedimentary 
rocks of the Kasalka Group (Diakow et al. 1997).  The Kasalka Group is a rock unit which 
occurs locally south of Natalkuz fault. Widespread Eocene volcanic arc related extensional 
felsic volcanic rocks and minor sedimentary rocks of the Ootsa Lake Group overlie the older 
rocks and are themselves overlain on higher ridges by basalt and andesite of the Eocene 
Endako Group (Diakow et al. 1997).   

The Bowser Lake Group is poorly exposed in the southern Nechako Plateau, except within 
Nechako uplift.  Nechako uplift is a structurally raised block bounded by the Natalkuz fault to 
the north and the Blackwater fault to the south (Diakow and Webster, 1994). Both faults 
juxtapose older rocks of the Stikine Terrane (e.g., Hazelton and Bowser Lake groups) with 
younger Cretaceous and Eocene rocks of the Ootsa Lake and Endako groups. This uplift 
provides a direct window through younger cover into older rocks (Diakow et al. 1997).The 
regional geologic setting is illustrated in Figure 7-1.

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

Quaternary glacial overburden, colluvial and fluvial deposits mask the majority of bedrock 
within the project area. Outcrop on the Blackwater property is sparse and limited to the peak 
and ridges of Mt. Davidson. Property geology is based on historic and 2009/2010 drill core 
interpretations. Figure 7-2 presents a sketch map of the project geology.  Interpreted 
geology is overlain on the regional geology as mapped by Diakow and Levson. The 
coloured area represents the gold gram*metre interpretation of mineralization as known on 
Feb 5, 2011.

The Blackwater Gold Project is underlain by intercalated volcanic and volcaniclastic felsic to 
intermediate lapilli and ash tuff, volcanic breccia, and andesitic flows.  These strata form a 
local wedge of laterally discontinuous strata. The Blackwater wedge is thought to dip 
generally northwest and is of limited aerial extent.  On the west the Blackwater wedge is 
faulted against younger massive felsic volcanic rocks of the Ootsa Lake Group. The fault is 
a north trending, presumed steep dipping structure. A similar relationship exists on the north 
side where Blackwater host rocks are also juxtaposed next to Ootsa Lake Group strata 
across an east-northeast trending fault. Although displacement across the faults is not 
known, the relative age of rocks across the two faults implies that the Blackwater block is a 
horst or high standing remnant west and north of which the Ootsa Lake Group has been 
dropped.  



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 23

East and south of the Blackwater block the relationship to the country rocks is unknown but 
presumed stratigraphic. Likely the Blackwater strata are underlain by Bowser Lake Group 
beds as at Capoose Lake. 

The Blackwater wedge includes felsic to intermediate volcaniclastic rocks that comprise two 
suites, massive grey and white lapilli tuff and massive dacite-andesite lapilli tuff.  The "black 
and white" lapilli tuff is characterized by subrounded dark grey dacitic-andesitic clasts and 
near-white rhyolite and siliceous clasts.  Clasts range to 20 cm, but are generally one to five 
cm across. The volcanic clasts are extremely fine grained massive and presumed to be 
felsic to intermediate composition based on colour and limited chemical data from historic 
work. The tuff is mostly matrix supported and layering is absent. The tuff matrix is very fine 
grained devitrified ash or recrystallized glass. Tuff fragments are welded to the groundmass 
and the rocks break across fragments, not around them. Dark reddish-brown anhedral 
equant, garnet crystal fragments up to a cm in diamter are seen as an accessory in the tuff 
and locally make up a percent or two of the rock. XRF data on the garnets indicates they are 
Mn-rich spessartine. 

The dacite-andesite tuff is massive and characterized by its dark grey angular dacite-
andesite lapilli in a dark grey very fine grained matrix of similar composition. Lapilli are up to 
15 cm across, angular and not rounded; the rock is mainly clast supported. The dacite-
andesite tuff fragments locally have oval quartz filled amygdules to 5 mm across and rarely 
pale grey to white subhedral short stubby plagioclase lath ghosts to 5 mm long. The dacite-
andesite tuff grades to dacite-andesite without fragments. This rock unit may be subvolcanic 
or subaerial but lacks evidence of surface reworking. 

Strata within the Blackwater wedge are laterally discontinuous over short distances. In 
sections it is impossible to trace units between drill holes even where holes are only 50 
metres apart. A general stratigraphic sequence for the Blackwater wedge remains elusive; 
the dacite-andesite is generally below the lapilli tuff and felsic volcanic rocks. 

Blackwater rocks are pervasively hydrofractured and silicified. Rocks are broken into small 
(2 mm to 10 cm) highly angular fragments. The fragments are "welded" together by very fine 
grained light to medium grey chalcedonic silica which fills the space between fragments. 
Examples of repeated hydrofracturing and silicification are common implying that this was a 
protracted process. The space generated by hydrofracturing varies widely even over 
distances of a few centimetres. Thus in one place the angular fragments almost fit together 
with only narrow cracks arating them. Centimetres away similar angular fragments have 
wider zones of siliceous cement between them. The amount of silica introduced through 
hydrofracturing and silicification may amount to 25% or more of the total volume of volcanic 
rocks. Hydrofracturing was driven by fluid overpressure of late magmatic and/or post 
magmatic fluid related to the volcanism. Silica between the fragments is thought to derive 
from the same fluid and to have been deposited as a result of sudden sharp fluid pressure 
decrease as a result of and immediately following hydrofracturing. 

Although intensely hydrofractured, the Blackwater wedge lacks recognized large scale faults 
or shear zones. Instead, extensive zones of broken rocks are seen in the mineralized zone. 
Rocks are broken into angular pieces a centimeter or more across and tightly packed but 
not cemented. Space between fragments may be occupied by a few tiny terminated clear 
quartz crystals but generally it is empty. The zones grade laterally into unbroken rock and 
are generally not bounded by planar surfaces. Fragment strain ratios are 1:1 and planar 
surfaces such as joints, slickensides or fabric are lacking. Evidence for displacement across 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 24

these broken sections is generally lacking and they appear to be simply broken zones. The 
shape of broken zones is highly irregular. The volume of broken rocks may amount to 15% 
of the volume of the Blackwater wedge. Broken zones are interpreted as late stage 
hydrofactured zones when little silica remained in the fluid to cement fragments and/or when 
the system was close enough to surface to allow fluid escape. 

The minimum age of Blackwater volcanic rocks is inferred from a concordant U-Pb zircon 
age of 67 Ma from a felsic dyke sampled from historic drill hole 92-35 (Friedman et al. 2001) 
and from two K-Ar ages of 70.2 and 68.1 Ma on related rocks.  These authors interpret that 
the ages represent the age of felsic magmatism and, more importantly, the age of precious 
metal mineralization. This age falls within the mineralization age bracket of 74-66 Ma for the 
Capoose prospect.  This age is suspect because it is unclear from current evidence what 
was sampled to obtain these results. However, if this age does define the age of 
mineralization the Blackwater and the Capoose properties likely represent mineralization 
associated with the waning stages of Bulkley suite magmatism (Friedman et al. 2001); 
volcanism and mineralization can be correlated with the Kasalka Group.  

On the peak and ridges of Mt. Davidson are outcrops of massive felsic lapilli tuff assigned to 
the Ootsa Lake Group. This rock is generally darker grey than rocks drilled on the property, 
clasts are larger and plagioclase porphyry dominates. This unit is also characterized by 
fresh, black stubby euhedral doubly terminated quartz crystals up to a mm across which 
commonly make up a few percent of the rock.   

At lower elevations near the Kluskus Road, bedded tuffs and sediments of the Jurassic 
Naglico Formation are observed.

8 DEPOSIT TYPE 

What is known of the Blackwater deposit is exclusively from drilling. Host rocks are not 
exposed but are thought to occupy a roughly 5 square kilometer area east of a north 
trending fault which juxtaposes younger Ootsa Lake Group strata and south of a similar fault 
north of which the same relationship is hypothesized.  

Blackwater has the characteristics of, and is considered to be, a low sulphidation epithermal 
gold-silver deposit. Mineralization occurs in stratigraphically chaotic volcanic rocks of Late 
Cretaceous age emplaced through and on Hazelton Group strata. The rocks are extensively 
hydrofractured and silicified and shot through with fine grained pyrite and other sulphide 
minerals. Gold is mainly associated with the sulphide minerals as gold grains between 5 and 
50 microns across. 

Figure 8-1 illustrates the hypothesized relationship of the mineralized volcanic rocks to 
surrounding strata.

9 MINERALIZATION 

A total of 21 polished thin sections were prepared from samples taken from 2009 drill core 
and were submitted to Vancouver Petrographics Ltd.  The sections were described and 
interpreted by Dr. John Payne by reflected and transmitted light petrographic methods.  
Sample selection was based primarily on gaining a representative suite containing; 1) the 
dominant lithologies and alteration assemblages described and used in core logging and, 2) 
all the different styles of sulphide mineralization observed with different gold grades. The 
purpose of this study was to understand the nature of the host volcanic and volcaniclastic 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 27

sequence and the nature of gold and base metal mineralization.  This study was ultimately 
intended to assist with lithologic correlation between drill holes.   

A second petrographic study of 21 drill core samples from 2010 drilling was carried out by 
Vancouver Petrographics Ltd who report as follows: 

"The samples submitted can be subdivided into five different suites. The first suite of 
samples are volcaniclastic lithologies and the nomenclature used in this report 
follows the suggestions reported in McPhie et. al. (1993). The components of the 
deposits are generally poorly sorted, polymict lithic fragments with a grain-size 
ranging from mudstone to breccia. Only sample 20 showed evidence of volcanic 
derived lithic fragments, such as microstructural evidence of the compaction of the 
lithic fragments under high temperature conditions and possibly devitrified 
spherulites. In the same sample, the coexistence of rounded and angular fragments 
indicates syn-eruptive re-sedimentation of primary deposits. 

The second group of samples show a more intense alteration and they are possibly 
the altered equivalent of the volcaniclastic lithologies described above. Alteration 
products include clay, quartz and white mica, albite, chlorite and tourmaline 

The third group of samples show flow microstructures and a possibly rhyo-dacitic 
composition.  

The fourth group are porphyritic andesites with differing alteration products. One 
sample is altered by a biotite-white mica-quartz-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite 
assemblage and another sample is altered by a weak to subtle clay alteration." 

Material from BW 59 was tested by Inspectorate Labs Metallurgical Division and reported by 
Karla Clayton. She reports that: 

"The principle (sic) minerals observed in the BW-59 Drill Hole Composite were 
non-opaque phases (90.02% average by optical analysis), which X-ray diffraction 
analysis indicates consist primarily of quartz (39.1% average), micas (27.9% 
average), orthoclase (17.0% average), clays (8.3% average), and minor calcium 
sulfates (1.8% average) and carbonates (0.5% average). The divergence in 
agreement between optical and XRD analysis is due mainly to the inability of 
XRD to detect amorphous limonite and subsequent overstating of the remnant 
phases; XRD analysis reflects only those components that are crystalline. Pyrite 
(3.96% average), iron oxides (limonite, hematite, magnetite and goethite, 3.88% 
average) and pyrrhotite (1.14% average) were the principle opaque phases. Ore 
minerals included sphalerite (0.77% average), chalcopyrite (0.23% average), 
cubanite (0.03% average), and traces of tetrahedrite, chalcocite and dioptase. 
Chalcopyrite and cubanite were occasionally tightly intergrown. Sphalerite rarely 
alters to bianchite. Principle other minerals included tetrahedrite, chalcocite, 
dioptase, rutile and ilmenite (traces of each), with a few particles of graphite 
observed. Dioptase and bianchite are only partially observable by reflected light 
microscopy, and a transmitted light study would better quantify their presence." 

Twenty-one samples were submitted to Eco Tech labs in 2009 for whole rock 
lithogeochemical analyses.  The aim of this study was to constrain the geochemical 
fingerprint of the host volcanic rocks by providing insight into the tectonic affinity, 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 28

geochemical classification, and petrological evolution.  Sample selection was primarily 
based on gaining a representative suite of volcanic rock types observed during the 2009 drill 
program.  Below is a brief summary of an internal report that details the results of the 
lithogeochemistry study. 

Owing to the intensity of silica and clay alteration only immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, Y, 
Nb, Th, Zr etc) are used for volcanic rock classification and geochemical modeling.  For 
example, the classic TAS diagram plots Blackwater rocks as andesite, dacites, and rhyolites 
because of increasing SiO2 concentrations.  On the basis of lithologic observation we know 
that SiO2 is largely secondary therefore discriminating on the basis of SiO2 is highly 
suspect. Blackwater volcanic rocks are geochemically classified as andesites on the basis of 
a revised Zz/TiO2 vs. Nb/Y plot (Figure 9-1) using only immobile elements. The trend 
observed in the TAS diagram is likely a result of silica alteration.  On a chondrite normalized 
REE (rare earth element) spider diagram (Figure 9-1) a pronounced negative Eu anomaly is 
observed in most samples and indicates that feldspar was conserved during melting and 
resides in the source.  This has implications for the mineralogy of the source and therefore 
the potential of a feldspar porphyritic source is plausible.  Also, the fractionated pattern 
observed in the plot (e.g., depletion of heavy REEs to light REEs) is indicative of garnet 
residing is the source as heavy REEs preferentially reside in garnet during partial melting.  
Garnet is commonly observed as clasts in Blackwater volcaniclastic rocks and based on 
geochemistry it is likely that they originated from the source.  The commonly used tectonic 
discrimination diagrams for felsic volcanic rocks (e.g. Figure 9-1; Rb vs. Y+Nb diagram) plot 
Blackwater rocks as volcanic arc related.  These diagrams have little use for distinguishing 
volcanic rocks in this area as all volcanic rocks of Jurassic to Eocene age have an arc 
affinity (Diakow et al. 1997).  Furthermore, there has been little geochemistry published in 
literature on volcanic rocks in the Nechako Plateau therefore distinguishing between 
Jurassic and Cretacous/Eocene volcanism on the basis of this limited geochemistry is not 
presently attempted. 

In a plot of Au vs. SiO2 (Figure 9-1) it is observed that rocks with the highest SiO2 content 
are not necessarily correlated with higher gold content.  The samples that yielded the 
highest gold assays are mostly confined to SiO2 concentrations of 63.5-66%.  This indicates 
that gold precipitation is likely associated with hydrothermal alteration but not necessarily 
restricted to the most intense phase of alteration.  This implies that the primary target at 
Blackwater is also proximal to the siliceous pipes where the intensity of silica alteration is 
somewhat weaker.

10 EXPLORATION 

The Blackwater Gold Project was discovered in 1973. Since then a wealth of data has been 
collected on the property by the various operators. These data are publicly available where 
filed for assessment. For example, complete soil geochemical data were collected over the 
property. Ground total magnetic field data were also collected. A pole-dipole IP survey was 
carried out as part of the pre Company work. These data have been digitized, synthesized 
and reinterpreted and are used to help guide the current work on the property. 

10.1 Geophysical Surveys 

During 2010 the Company contracted Quantec Geoscience Ltd of Toronto to conduct a 17.5 
line kilometer deep focus IP survey on five 3.5 km long north-south lines spaced 400 m 
apart. Results of the survey have been reported and interpreted in terms of drill data. 
Excellent correspondence is seen between chargeability and known mineralization and the 
IP data helps guide the drilling. 

Figure 10-1 is a view looking northwest across the IP survey area showing chargeability 
variation across the project.  Figure 10-2 is a plot of the chargeability data through the 
centre of the mineralized zone.  The high near-surface zone between 2500 and 3500N 
coincides with the gold mineralization.

11 DRILLING 

The Company began drilling at Blackwater in August 2009 and during that year drilled 18 
holes for a total 3,368.58 metres. During 2010 the Company drilled a further 58 holes for a 
total 21,585.56 metres as detailed in the Table 11-1. Following completion of work 
requirement for the option agreements on the Davidson, Dave and Jarrit claims the 2010 
drilling focused on the Dave and Jarrit claims.  The drill hole layout is illustrated in Figure 
11-1.

Figure 11-1 Drill hole plan 

  

The tables below list the significant intervals intercepted during the 2009/2010 drill programs based 
on a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au.  The minimum width reported is 10m and up to 5m internal dilution 
was accepted.  The mineralized zone is irregular and not tabular in shape and true thickness cannot 
be determined and was not used as a factor in the resource model.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Drill core is transported from drill to camp by all-terrain vehicle.  Core is logged in a specially 
built core handling facility. Logging includes geotechnical, magnetic susceptibility, specific 
gravity and portable XRF chemistry measurements at regular intervals. Lithology is logged 
and the core prepared for systematic sampling of one metre intervals. Core sawing and 
sampling are the last steps in core handling. 

Logged data is inserted into LogChief in tables designed specifically for this project.  
Logging was carried out by Chris Leslie, Riyan Abraham, Nimmi Dhada, Scott McBride and 
Todd Wikjord.  Chemical composition was measured directly on core using a portable XRF 
(X-ray fluorescence) analyser (Niton Xl3t) at 25cm intervals.  This work was performed by 
Brian Kornichuk, Geoff Ranson, Jonathan Lodge, and Aaron McMillan.  Magnetic 
susceptibility and conductivity were measured at 10 cm increments along the core with a 
handheld conductivity and magnetic susceptibility meter (GDD MPP-EM2S+Probe).  This 
data was stored internally and was downloaded to an excel spread sheet. Brian Kornichuk, 
Geoff Ranson, Jonathan Lodge, and Aaron McMillan performed this task. 

Recovery and RQD (Rock Quality Designation) were measured and recorded in LogChief.  
An RQD measurement is the cumulative length of core pieces longer than 10cm in a run 
divided by the total length of that run.  Recovery and RQD measurements were performed 
by geotechnical staff including, Brian Kornichuk, Geoff Ranson, Jonathan Lodge, and Aaron 
McMillan.  Core recovery for the 2009/2010 drilling averaged 88% and the median core 
recovery was 95%.  Poor core recovery often occurs in the crumbled chloritic and crumbled 
siliceous units.  Together, these lithologies account for about 7% of the total drill meterage 
and it is not believed that this materially impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. 

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

Sampling for analysis is done systematically on one meter sample composites. Intervals are 
measured and marked on the core boxes where sample tags are stapled at the beginning of 
each interval.  Core is sawed in half lengthwise using a diamond saw. Half the core is 
placed in standard heavy poly sample bags with the pre-printed sample tag in a zip log 
baggy; the whole is then closed with zip ties. The remaining half core is kept for reference in 
the core box stored on site at the Company's camp.  Core sawing and sampling were 
performed by Company employees Devin Grinder, Tom Morrison and Kerry Bunnah. 

A standard sample, a blank sample, or a duplicate sample is inserted into the sample 
stream every tenth sample. The certified reference standards used were purchased from 
supplied by CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd., an independent laboratory in Langley, BC. 
The standards were selected to match the precious metal content range and material type at 
Blackwater as closely as possible at the start of the exploration program.  However, the 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 41

certified gold grades of the standards used in the 2010 program were significantly higher 
than the average grade of around 1 g/t and this should be corrected in future programs. 

For shipment to the lab, four samples are placed in rice bags with sample ID numbers on 
each bag and sealed with numbered banker's security tags.  Between preparation and 
shipment, a period up to four days, the rice bags with samples are stored at site in a secure 
area behind the core cutting area. 

Samples are transported to Prince George by truck. The driver waits with the samples in the 
truck until pick up for shipment by ACE Courier.  Samples including the blanks, standards 
and duplicates, are shipped by bonded courier to Eco Tech Stewart Group Laboratories 
("Eco Tech") in Kamloops, BC. 

Eco Tech was used as the primary analytical laboratory and has an ISO 9001:2008 
certification.  Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd., an ISO 9001 registered facility located in 
Vancouver, BC is used as a secondary laboratory and every thirtieth reject is routinely sent 
to Acme for rechecks. 

In the lab standard sample preparation procedures were used. A multi element (28 
elements) package with aqua-regia digest (nitric and hydrochloric acids) ICPOES finish 
coupled with a 30g fire assay with an AA finish was used for multi element and gold 
analyses respectively.  Overlimit ICP analyses of Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn were performed on 
analyses that returned grades of Ag >30g/t, and Cu, Zn, Pb >1%. 

The Company's drill hole and assay database is administered from the Vancouver head 
office using Maxwell Geoservices products. Drill hole data logged in the field is entered into 
a LogChief database specifically tailored to the Blackwater Project. LogChief validates this 
data as it is entered, and the final logs are exported and transferred to the database 
administrator in Vancouver for import to DataShed, the master database. Additional data 
validation checks are carried out in DataShed and all logs are checked by the administrator. 

Assay certificates received from Eco Tech Labs are delivered in a format specified by the 
Company to allow instant import to Datashed. 

The database is hosted on the Company's server which runs a RAID 5 configuration to 
protect the database from any drive failures. The database is backed up after every major 
data upload and also as part of a weekly backup of the Company's server.  Backups are 
stored off site to avoid any loss of data due to physical damage of the drives. 

It is the author's opinion that sample preparation, security and analysis meets or exceeds 
industry standards and is adequate to support a mineral resource estimate as defined under 
NI 43-101. 

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
14.1 Historic Drilling 

No records exist regarding QA/QC practices prior to 2005.  The 2005 assessment report by 
Silver Quest states the following: 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 42

Routine duplicate samples were inserted into the sample stream about every 
20 samples. Blank samples were inserted into the sample stream about every 
40 samples. 

A microdiorite sill rock unit was used for the blank samples in the sampling 
program. This blank rock was collected from diamond drill holes that 
intersected the sill during historical diamond drilling on Southern Rio's 3Ts 
property, located about 20 km southwest of the Davidson property. Laboratory 
results show that the ten blank samples contain from zero to 30 ppb gold and 
zero to 0.3 ppm silver, therefore no contamination within the laboratory is 
indicated by the blank sample results. 

Duplicate samples were obtained by quartering the drill core sample from the 
selected interval (splitting one half of the core into two quarters). The two 
quarter-core samples were then submitted to the assay laboratory as a 
duplicate pair. Nineteen duplicate pairs were analyzed. 

In addition, nineteen sample pulps from Eco Tech Laboratory were shipped to 
Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. for check analyses.  

No assessment report was filed in 2006 but it is believed that the same protocol was used 
for the two core holes completed during that season. 

14.2 Standards 

As noted above standards are inserted systematically into the sample stream. Every tenth 
sample is a standard, a blank or a duplicate. 

The standards used during the 2009 and 2019 drill programs were used to monitor 
laboratory performance.  The certified values and "Between Laboratory" two standard 
deviation limits are shown in Table 14-1. 

Table 14-1 Certified reference standard values 
Year Standard Au g/t (Fire Assay) Ag g/t Zn % 

2009 CDN-PGMS-14 0.259 ± 0.034 g/t   
2009 CDN-GS-11A 11.21 ± 0.87 g/t   
2009 CDN-GS-3E 2.97 ± 0.27 g/t   
2010 CDN-GS-3F 3.10 ± 0.24 g/t     
2010 CDN-GS-7B 6.42 ± 0.46 g/t     
2009 CDN-ME-1 0.87 ± 0.09 g/t 39.3 ± 4.6 g/t 0.347 ± 0.028 % 
2010 CDN-ME-2 2.10 ± 0.11 g/t 14.0 ± 1.3 g/t 1.35 ± 0.10 % 

Upon receipt of the assay data the standards are carefully examined and compared with 
accepted values. For standards a result within two standard deviations from the mean of the 
certified standard were deemed to pass. No unacceptable standard verification results were 
found in 2010 and one was found in 2009. Five instances were found where a blank was 
inserted into the sample stream instead of a standard. Five cases of misclassified standards 
being inserted were also noted. 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 43

The average standard grades from Eco Tech compared closely with the certified grades 
except for CDN-GS-3E where the average grade of 78 samples was almost 10% higher 
(3.26 vs 2.97 g/t).  Examination of the CRM certificate revealed one of the round robin tests 
returned similar levels so the certified value may not be completely reliable.  When 
performance limits were adjusted for the bias the results were deemed acceptable with one 
failure (Figure 14-1). Use of this standard was discontinued at the end of 2009. 

Sample sequence charts from the 2010 drill program are illustrated in Figure 14-2 to Figure 
14-5.

14.3 Duplicate Samples 

Assay results for duplicates were compared to those for the original sample and statistical 
plots were prepared for comparison.  A total of 789 field duplicate results were examined; 
27% of which were duplicate half core with the remainder quarter core duplicates.  Two of 
the samples were suspected of being misclassified and excluded from statistical analysis.  
No significant sample bias was evident in the statistics (Table 14-2) or scatterplot (Figure

The Thompson-Howarth plot for Au in the field duplicates is shown in Figure 14-7.  The 
precision values for the core duplicates measure the cumulative error in the sampling, 
preparation and analytical processes. At the 95% confidence level and at 0.5 g/t Au, the 
precision values indicate about a ± 10% error.  This is considered low for gold deposits 
which can often have greater than a ± 20% cumulative error.

14.4 Blanks 

Blanks used in this project and inserted into the sample stream derive from outcrop of a 
barren granodiorite exposed about 10 km north of the mineralized zone. Before use as 
blanks 13 samples of this material were analyzed at was analyzed at Eco Tech Stewart 
Group Laboratories.  

Upon receipt of the assay data the blanks are carefully examined and compared with 
accepted values. Assay results for blanks were uniformly below or at detection limit for gold. 
For other elements the blanks show good consistency giving confidence that the same 
material was being used in each instance. 

14.5 Site Visit 

The author visited the site on December 13, 2010.  The purpose of the visit was to review 
the geology and mineralization encountered in the drill holes completed to date.  In addition, 
drilling, sampling, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), sample preparation and 
analytical protocols and procedures, and database structure were reviewed. 

Four samples of drill core were collected and submitted for assay.  Results were consistent 
with those from the intervals in which they resided (Table 14-4). 

Six drill hole collar locations were also verified by GPS readings. 

Table 14-4  Assay results from samples collected during site visit

BW-87B BW0087 146.5 0.603 146-147 0.75 

14.6 Conclusions 

QA/QC with respect to the results received to date for the Company's 2009/2010 exploration 
programs is acceptable and protocols have been well documented.  A lower level of QA/QC 
exists for the seven drill holes completed between 2005 and 2006 but it is believed to be 
sufficient to support a resource estimate.  Data from holes drilled between 1981 and 1994 
have no documented QA/QC information and they are not deemed acceptable for use in 
resource grade estimation. 

The author recommends acquiring some lower grade Au standards as the ones presently in 
use are over twice the average grade of the deposit.  Two standards of approximately 0.4 
and 1 g/t gold levels would be appropriate.

16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Preliminary metallurgical testing on samples from the Blackwater Gold Project was carried 
out on composites from three drill holes drilled in 2009. The work was carried out in early 
2010 by the Metallurgical Division of Inspectorate Exploration and Mining Services Ltd. in 
Richmond BC. 

The composite samples are of drill core from BW 43, BW 46 and BW 59. Samples are of 
selected sections from the three drill holes and represent different rock and alteration types; 
the samples are of drill core sawed in half lengthwise. 

The samples responded well to direct whole ore cyanidation tests with an average of 92% 
gold recovery across three tests at different conditions on each composite (9 tests in total). 
Accessory silver was recovered at an average of 47%. 

The three composites were also subjected to flotation testing to produce a bulk sulphide 
concentrate under three different grinding and reagent conditions. The samples also 
responded well to this test and the best recoveries obtained under one set of test conditions 
returned an average for the three composites of 94% of the gold and silver reporting to the 
bulk sulphide concentrate. 

The composites were also subjected to direct gravity concentration. The samples responded 
well with the three composites averaging 51% gold recovered into a gravity concentrate.

17 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
17.1 Exploratory Data Analysis 

The sample database for the Blackwater project contains results from 113 core holes drilled 
between 1987 and 2010.  Seventy-four of these have been drilled since the start of 2009. 
Four core holes drilled between 1981 and 2006 were not sampled or records have been 
lost.  No analytical data was available for 33 RC holes completed in 1981 and their precise 
locations are uncertain.  Due to lack of QAQC and survey information, holes drilled prior to 
2005 were not used for statistical analysis or grade estimation. 

Cumulative frequency distribution for the Au and Ag samples within a 0.3 g/t gradeshell 
domain is illustrated in Figure 17-1 and Figure 17-2.  Sample populations are highly skewed 
approaching log normal distribution with no significant bimodality evident.    

Au and Ag show a weak positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.3) and a linear 
regression yields a very low R2 value of 0.03 (Figure 17-3). 

Basic statistics are shown in Table 17-1.

17.2 Outlier Analysis 

Before compositing, grade distribution in the raw sample data was examined to determine if 
grade capping or special treatment of high outliers was warranted. Cumulative log 
probability plots were examined for outlier populations and decile analyses was performed 
for Au within the zone domains. As a general rule, the cutting of high grades is warranted if: 

• the last decile (upper 10% of samples) contains more than 40% of the metal; or 
• the last decile contains more than 2.3 times the metal of the previous decile; or 
• the last centile (upper 1%) contains more than 10% of the metal; or 
• the last centile contains more than 1.75 times the next highest centile. 

For the Blackwater zone domain the last decile for Au contains 59% of the metal content 
and 25% is contained in the top centile. After reviewing the probability distribution it was 
decided to cap grades near the 99th percentile level at 15 g/t.  This cap grade affects 84 
samples. 

For Ag the last decile contained 53% of the metal and the upper centile contained 19%.  A 
cap grade of 50 g/t was selected which approximates the 99th percentile level. A total of 99 
samples assayed above this threshold for Ag. 

CPP plots and cap grade levels are illustrated in Figure 17-4. 

Figure 17-4 Cumulative log probability plots for Au and Ag 

 

Analysis of statistics for the various lithologies reveals that all rock types can contain 
significant levels of Au (Figure 17-5).  Examination of contact profiles throughout the 
mineralized zones showed that lithologies were not principal controls of mineralization and 
that the use of hard boundaries for grade estimation were not justified.

17.3 Deposit Modeling 

Due to the irregular and chaotic nature of the lithologic contacts it was not possible to create 
valid wireframe solids based on sectional or level plan interpretations.  Alternative methods 
considered were nearest neighbour interpolations and indicator kriging to assign lithologic 
codes to the block model and to generate a gradeshell domain to constrain grade 
estimation.   

Core drilling has defined a continuous zone of +0.3 g/t Au mineralization that extends at 
least 1040 metres along its longest dimension in an east-west direction and at least 580 
metres N-S. The thickness of the zone ranges up to 350 metres. This zone was modeled as 
an isosurface using Leapfrog3D© software at a level of 0.3 g/t Au. The Au data was 
composited to 5m intervals and put through a log transform and modeled using ordinary 
kriging with a maximum search distance of 100 metres. A moderate anisotropy of 1.5:1 was 
imposed parallel to the main trend of the zone (plunging 0° towards an azimuth of 100°).  
The resulting solid was imported to Gemcom Surpac© software and clipped to the bedrock 
surface.  Isolated solids based on intercepts from single drill holes were eliminated.  An 
indicator kriging run was also carried in Surpac out using a 0.3 g/t Au threshold as a 
comparison and blocks with a 50% probability of containing grades above this level were 
compared with the solid model.  The general geometry of the solid model correlated 
reasonably well with the 50% level of the indicator kriged model. 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 55

Lithologic shapes were generated using indicator kriging with intercepts of the modeled 
lithology being assigned a value of 1 and all others a value of 0.  The 0.5 level was then 
used as a threshold for generating the solid models.  Several lithic tuff lithologies that had 
similar characteristics and densities were combined for block assignments as listed in Table 
17-2.  The block lithologic code assignments are illustrated in Table 17-2 and the block 
model lithologic coding is shown in cross section in Figure 17-6.

17.4 Compositing 

Fixed length downhole composites of Au and Ag were generated using 5 metre intervals 
within the zone domain.  Samples were capped prior to compositing at levels of 15 g/t for Au 
and 50 g/t for Ag.  Statistics for composites are summarized Table 17-3.  The combination of 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT

capping and compositing reduce the coefficient of variation for Au from 3.26 in the raw 
sample data to 1.29.

average SG grades for each modeled lithology were assigned to the corresponding blocks

parameters and anisotropy.

17.7 Block Model and Grade Estimation Procedures 

A block model was created in Gemcom-Surpac Vision© software using a block size 10 x 10 
x 10 m.  Block model extents are summarized in Table 17-5.

The model blocks were first coded by the partial percent within the zone domain and below 
topography.  Lithologic codes and SG values were then assigned as described in Sections 
17.3 and 17.5.  

Au and Ag grades within the zone domain were estimated in three passes using both the 
ordinary kriging method and inverse distance to the third power (ID3).  Search parameters

17.8 Mineral Resource Classification 

Resource classifications used in this study conform to the following definition from National 
Instrument 43-101: 

Mineral Resource 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or 
natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial 
minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 
reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological 
characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge. 

Measured Mineral Resource 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that 
are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

Indicated Mineral Resource 



TECHNICAL REPORT – BLACKWATER GOLD PROJECT 

GeoSim Services Page 64

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to 
allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and 
grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 
assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

In order to meet the requirements of NI43-101 with respect to reasonable prospects of 
economic extraction, by open pit mining methods, a 45°wall slope Lerchs Grossman pit was 
generated to constrain the resource within the block model.  Metal prices assumed were 
$1000/ounce for gold with recovery of 92%. Combined processing, G & A, and ore mining 
costs were assumed to be $12.79/tonne.  Base waste mining costs were assumed to be 
$2.00/tonne.  

Consideration was given to classifying blocks estimated in the1st kriging pass as 
'measured'.  However only about 1% of the blocks estimated in the first 2 passes qualified 
and this was deemed too small a figure to report at this stage. 

Blocks were classified as indicated if they were estimate in the 1st or 2nd kriging pass and 
were within a boundary limit surrounding the area of recent grid drilling.  Blocks within this 
boundary were also classified as indicated if they were estimated in the 3rd pass but had a 
composite within 40 m of the block centroid (half the maximum variogram range).  All other 
estimated blocks were classified as inferred.  Block classification is illustrated in Figure 
17-19 and Figure 17-20.

17.9 Model Validation 

Model verification was initially carried out by visual comparison of blocks and sample grades 
in plan and section views. The estimated block grades showed reasonable correlation with 
adjacent composite grades.

GeoSim Services Page 66

Block grades were also estimated using ID3 and nearest neighbour methods. A comparison 
of global mean values within the gradeshell domain shows a reasonably close relationship 
with samples, composites and block model values (Table 17-7).

Swath plots were generated to assess the model for global bias by comparing Kriged, ID3 
and nearest neighbour estimates on panels through the deposit. Results show a reasonable 
comparison between the methods, particularly in the main portions of the deposit indicated 
by the bar charts (Figure 17-21 to Figure 17-23).

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Blackwater has the characteristics of, and is considered to be, a low sulphidation epithermal 
gold-silver deposit. Mineralization occurs in stratigraphically chaotic volcanic rocks of Late 
Cretaceous age emplaced through and on Hazelton Group strata. The rocks are extensively 
hydrofractured and silicified and shot through with fine grained pyrite and other sulphide 
minerals. Gold is hosted mostly associated with the sulphide minerals as gold grains 
between 5 and 50 microns across. 

Drilling by the Company since August 2009 has outlined a large, low grade gold-silver 
deposit that extends at least 1040 metres along its longest dimension in an east-west 
direction and at least 580 metres N-S. The thickness of the presently defined zone ranges 
up to 350 metres. 

Results from preliminary metallurgical testing carried out in 2010 showed that the samples 
responded well to direct whole ore cyanidation tests with an average of 92% gold and 47% 
silver recovery.  Preliminary flotation tests suggest that up to 94% gold and silver may report 
to a bulk sulphide concentrate.  Direct gravity concentration tests gave average recoveries 
of 51% gold. 

Sample preparation, security and analysis meets or exceeds industry standards and is 
adequate to support a mineral resource estimate as defined under NI 43-101.  QA/QC with 
respect to the results received to date for the Company's 2009/2010 exploration programs is 
acceptable and protocols have been well documented.  The database contains all core data 
collected on the project to date and has been structured for resource estimation. 

At a cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t gold, the Blackwater Gold deposit is estimated to contain an 
indicated mineral resource of 53.5 million tonnes averaging 1.064 g/t Au and 5.6 g/t Ag.  An 
additional 74.85 million tonnes grading 0.97 g/t Au and 4.1 g/t Ag is classified as inferred.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Two lower grade Au certified reference standards should be acquired as the ones presently 
in use are over twice the average deposit grade. 

A preliminary economic assessment should be initiated.  Results of the PEA should be used 
as a basis for making additional detailed recommendations for: 

• Further metallurgical test work 

• Infill and additional definition drilling  

• Geotechnical drilling 

• Site investigation 

• Infrastructure development 

• Environmental baseline studies 

• Mining method evaluation 

• Processing option tradeoffs and resource characterization
