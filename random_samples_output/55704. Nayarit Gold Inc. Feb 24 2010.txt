Summary (Item 3) 
Property Description and Location 
The Animas/Del Norte Zone (Animas/Del Norte), which is a part of the Orion Project (Project), 
lies in the prolific Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), which hosts numerous multi-million ounce 
gold-silver deposits.  It is one of the larger contiguous concessions in the Sierra Madre, 
composed of more than +110,000ha.  The Project is located on the SE flank of the Sierra Madre, 
approximately 110km north–northwest of Tepic, the state capital of Nayarit, México, 150km 
southeast of Mazatlan, Sinaloa, and 40km south–southeast of the town of Acaponeta.  The area 
has excellent nearby infrastructure including a railroad, the Pan American Highway and a major 
power transmission line.  The terrain is gently rolling hills, which will allow for ease of 
construction as the project is pushed towards production. 

Gold mineralization at Orion is epithermal in character and hosted in a series of east-west 
trending breccia zones and mineralized quartz veins.  The geochemical suite identified at Orion 
also suggests there has been little erosion, providing significant evidence that if additional ore is 
present it has not been removed. 

Ownership 
Nayarit Gold Inc. has incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary in Mexico, Nayarit Gold de 
México, S.A. de C.V., to directly hold the titles to the concessions and to operate in Mexico, and 
holds a 100% interest in the concessions, located in the municipalities of Acaponeta, Tecuala and 
Rosa Morada, in the state of Nayarit.  Nayarit Gold Inc. has acquired by agreement dated 
January 30, 2004, the rights to the mineral concessions with the titles held directly by its wholly-
owned Mexican subsidiary, Nayarit Gold de México, S.A. de C.V. 

Geology and Mineralization 
The Orion project is located along the western edge of the SMO, a north-northwest trending 
volcanic plateau.  The SMO extends over 2,000km from the U.S. – Mexico border to southern 
Nayarit State where it is overlain by the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt.  Orion is between the 
boundary between the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Coastal Plain of the Pacific Ocean. 

The geology of the area is characterized by Early to Mid-Tertiary volcanic rocks locally cut by 
shallow, fine-grained to porphyritic intrusive rocks.  This assemblage is typical of the SMO, and 
extends through eastern Sonora, and western Chihuahua, western Durango, Sinaloa and Nayarit 
States. 

The northern portion of Nayarit Gold's concessions includes a number of epithermal veins, 
which are developed along east-west fracture systems.  Mineralized veins form two discrete 
mineralized corridors separated by about 2km from one another.  The southern mineralized 
corridor includes the Animas/Del Norte veins system, as well as the Pantaleona, San Francisco 
and La Estrella veins, which generally dip to the north.  The La Estrella structure is a northwest 
striking splay off the Del Norte vein.  The northern corridor includes the El Rey, La Escondida, 
El Carmen, Bonanza 1 veins, which generally dip to the south and includes the previously 
producing Bonanza mine, which is in a mining concession controlled by Minerales Vane internal 
to Nayarit Gold's land package.

The mineralized zones at Animas/Del Norte consist of a series of 2 to 4m wide discrete quartz 
veins within a zone of dense quartz stockwork and breccias, averaging 12m wide and reaching 
widths greater than 25m.  Epithermal textures ranging from colloform banding in chalcedonic 
quartz to cockade texture in crystalline quartz are common.  Nayarit Gold personnel have 
observed that two different mineral assemblages occur in the veins and that one assemblage is 
more favorable for high-grade mineralization.  An early district wide event resulted in the 
formation of crystalline quartz and pyrite, observed in all the known veins in the district.  This 
event is characterized by well-crystallized pyrite and low silver: gold ratios.  The event is gold 
dominant and does have potentially economically mineable grades in several drillholes in the La 
Estrella area.  A later event, characterized by very finely crystalline to chalcedonic quartz, is 
accompanied by very fine pyrite, acanthite/argentite, light colored sphalerite and very minor 
chalcopyrite and galena.  Dark, sulfide rich bands (ginguro bands) and breccia fragments 
containing remnants of such bands are common.  This event has high silver:gold ratios and is the 
dominant style of mineralization observed in the Animas/Del Norte and Pantaleona areas, and is 
less well developed in the San Francisco area.  Only traces of the younger fine-grained 
quartz/argentite event have been observed at La Estrella.  The more favorable silver rich event is 
present along the northern mineralized corridor, but has not been identified in significant 
volumes along at El Rey, La Escondida and Bonanza 1.  It is noted that along the northern vein 
system, the Bonanza mine appears to have this latter mineral assemblage well developed on 
rocks taken from the dumps. 

Exploration 
The Project was likely explored during the Spanish Colonial times during the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries, during which period numerous mines throughout Western Mexico, 
including the State Nayarit, were operated.  It is estimated that less than 2% of the property has 
been explored, although in recent months Nayarit has increased its target generation effort in 
light of the success with the discovery of the Animas/Del Norte system, which is Nayarit's first 
significant discovery.  Nayarit Gold has been exploring the Orion project since 2004. 

Preliminary Economic Assessment Results 
SRK performed conceptual trade-off studies for a number of different project scenarios using 
different combinations of open pit mining, underground mining, heap leaching, CCD/Merrill-
Crowe plant, and flotation plant with various process alternatives for the flotation concentrate. 

Open pit mining indicated a high stripping ratio and other issues, which combined to make it 
relatively unattractive when compared to underground mining alternatives, and an underground 
mining scenario was selected for the PEA.  Selection was made of a milling and tank leaching 
option for processing, based on economic evaluations and potential upside in precious metal 
prices. 

The mill will be fed at a throughput rate of 750t/d of ore.  Annual throughput is based on 92% 
mechanical availability of the mill over 365 days, resulting in an annual throughput of 252kt of 
ore.

Hydrogeology 
SRK undertook a preliminary (scoping) level hydrogeology program in August 2009. 

Based on the results of the study, the geologic formations evaluated within the proposed mine 
area did not exhibit hydraulic conductivity values that would suggest a potential for large, long-
term groundwater inflows to the proposed underground ramp system, or the necessity of 
implementation of active dewatering system.  Similarly, the groundwater elevation data provided 
by Nayarit also indicated that the hydraulic conductivity values within the mine area are 
relatively low based on the difference between the high and low measured water levels.  Water 
levels suggestive of a high permeability would be relatively uniform across the site (significantly 
less than the actual measured differences in the water levels). 

Groundwater chemistry does not suggest a potential problem with the quality of mine water 
discharge, however, results indicate further groundwater sampling should be undertaken. 

Mineral Resources and Reserves 
SRK considers that portions of the Orion gold-silver deposits are amenable for underground 
mining methods.  After analysis of processing and mining options, and trade-off studies to 
determine the most attractive project economics, SRK has concluded that extraction of portions 
of the Orion deposit by open pit methods is no longer an attractive option. 

Underground resources are stated above a 2.0g/t gold equivalent cut-off contained within grade 
shapes generated using Leapfrog™ software, and reflect a reasonable break-even cut-off based 
on current cost and metallurgical recovery estimates.  Gold equivalents were calculated using a 
silver-gold ratio of 60:1, with metallurgical recovery and net smelter returns assumed to be 
100%. 

SRK has estimated the mineral resources for the Orion Project (including Animas/Del Norte, La 
Estrella and San Francisco areas) as an Indicated Mineral Resource of 1.107Mt grading 3.66g/t 
Au and 309.24g/t Ag, containing 314koz AuEq.  An additional 0.181Mt grading 3.33g/t Au and 
94.52g/t Ag containing 28koz AuEq oz has been classified as Inferred Mineral Resource. 

The mineral resources are reported in accordance with CSA NI 43-101 and have been estimated 
in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserves Best Practices" guidelines.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral 
resource will be converted into mineral reserves. 

There is no reserve statement in the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) since it is 
preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too 
speculative, geologically, to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 
them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  Therefore, the term "mineable resource" is used in 
lieu of "reserves" to describe mineable quantities.

Underground Mining 
Underground mine design work in this PEA is based on Indicated and Inferred resources located 
in the Animas/Del Norte area only.  Resources within the La Estrella and San Francisco areas are 
currently considered to be too limited in extent and distant from the Animas/Del Norte area to 
support separate underground operations. 

The available geotechnical information indicates that a sublevel longhole stoping method with 
backfill would be successful in obtaining a high extraction ratio in the economic portion of the 
orebody.  A moderate amount of geotechnical data was gathered during the geological core 
logging process.  In general terms, it appears that relatively poor ground conditions can be 
expected in the near surface areas of the orebody in both the hangingwall and footwall.  
Although these areas are currently planned for longhole mining, it may be necessary to use a cut-
and-fill methodology in these areas in order to reduce dilution that may result from large 
unsupported spans.  The orebody is generally more competent than the hangingwall and 
footwall. 

The mine design process involved preparing mineable stope wireframes based on an economic 
cut-off grade applied to an equivalent gold grade block model.  The stope wireframes were 
evaluated against the block model for volume, tonnage and grade.  Dilution and recovery were 
added to the designed tonnage to account for unplanned stope dilution and pillar loss.  The 
production schedule was prepared for a production rate of 750t/d, with a contractor mining on a 
10-hour per shift, 2-shift per day, 7-day per week operating schedule. 

At the PEA level it was considered suitable to apply a longhole method with 15m sublevel 
spacing and backfill.  A more thorough geotechnical assessment will be required for the next 
level of study, which will include orientated core, triple tube geotechnical drilling and re-logging 
of selected existing drillholes. 

Access and infrastructure development was designed to support the sublevel longhole stoping 
method, and sized based on mining equipment and production rate requirements. 

The main ramp access development starts to the north of the orebody close to the process plant 
site.  The first section of the ramp runs south and crosses through the orebody taking advantage 
of a barren section.  Once in the orebody footwall, the ramp spirals up and down to access all the 
stope areas.  The main ramp has a cross section of 4.5m wide x 4m high and a total length of 
3,480m, which includes a 15% contingency for remuck bays, safety bays, and sumps. 

Waste development used to access the sublevels has 15m spacing throughout the orebody.  The 
waste development has a cross section of 4m wide x 4m high and a total length of 5,680m, which 
includes 10% contingency in addition to the design.  Ore development on the sublevels was 
designed with a cross section of 4m x 4m and a total length of 4,890m. 

The mine design process results in a mineable resource of 1.18Mt (diluted) at a silver grade of 
267g/t and a gold grade of 2.79g/t.  Before process recovery, the orebody contains 106,000oz 
gold and 10.15Moz silver.  This estimate is based on a cut-off grade of 2.6g/t gold equivalent and 
on applying 95% mining recovery to the designed wireframes, in addition to 15% unplanned 
waste dilution. 

Mechanized development mining will be undertaken using a combination of single and twin-
boom drill jumbos.  It is estimated that two jumbos, one twin-boom and one single-boom could 
undertake all the development work, however it is likely that a contractor would bring a third

machine to act as backup.  The majority of the development occurs in the first two years and 
development will reduce significantly in Years three to five. 

Development mucking will be undertaken by 6yd LHD's dumping into 27t trucks which will 
haul the waste rock to a stockpile on surface.  When stoping commences, most of the waste 
material will be transfered directly to stopes for backfilling. 

Ground support will be in the form of 1.8m split sets and #9 wire screen.  Drilling for ground 
support will be undertaken by the development jumbos or using hand held drills from a scissor 
lift.  Backfill material will be a combination of cemented rock fill (CRF) and waste fill (WF). 

During the first year of operation most of the development waste will be stockpiled on surface.  
Once stoping operations commence, the waste stockpile will be reclaimed as backfill.  A simple 
CRF plant will be built whereby trucks full of waste will drive under a cement slurry loadout, the 
slurry will be dumped directly onto the waste in the truck and driving the truck underground and 
dumping into the stopes will mix the CRF.  A ratio of approximately 50%CRF to 50%WR will 
be utilized in the backfilling process. 

The Main Ramp will be the intake air supply for the mine.  Two exhaust ventilation raises with 
surface mounted fans are envisaged to provide to provide a negative pressure ventilation system. 

Processing and Metallurgy 
The Animas/Del Norte deposit is a gold and silver property with the recoverable metal values 
split between the gold and silver.  Preliminary mineralogical investigations and indicative 
metallurgical testwork have been undertaken and have indicated that the material is relatively 
easy to process and that high precious metal recoveries can be achieved. 

Metallurgical testwork on the Animas/Del Norte material was undertaken for Nayarit by SGS at 
their facilities at Durango, Mexico.  Testwork has focused on investigating and developing 
conceptual flowsheets and the initial investigations were focused on the treatment of milled ore.  
Metallurgical testwork investigations included direct cyanide leach, gravity concentration, and 
flotation including leaching tests on the gravity tails and on flotation concentrates and tailings.  
Other testwork has been conducted. 

Various processing alternatives indicated merit, although the milling and cyanidation method 
(tank leaching), based on existing testwork, resulted in the highest precious metal recoveries.  
This has been shown to achieve recoveries of around 92% for gold and 88% silver (based on the 
anticipated high feed grade).  This was the selected processing method for this PEA. 

Ore would be received from the mine and processed in one stage of crushing to be suitable as 
mill feed.  Crushed ore will be stored on a stockpile of two days live capacity.  From the 
stockpile ore will be reclaimed by vibrating feeders.  Ore will be routed to a grinding circuit 
(single stage SAG mill operating in closed circuit), thickening, and (cyanide) leaching with large 
mechanically agitated tanks.  The leach product will pass to a series of four counter current 
decantation (CCD) thickeners.  The pregnant solution will go to a Merrill-Crowe precipitation 
circuit.  Precipitated gold and silver will be recovered from solution for acid digestion, 
dewatering and smelting.  The final product will be a doré bar containing mainly silver, which 
will be dispatched for refining.  Washed tailings from the CCD circuit will be detoxified for the 
destruction of residual cyanide and discharged to tailings storage.

Tailings 
SRK developed a scoping level Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) design (north of the mine and 
with an arroyo diversion channel), to account for the following: 

• 1.2 Million tonne (Mt) conventional slurry tailings storage, assuming an average dry 
density of 1,200kg/m3 and flat (0%) tailings surface slope; and 

• The TSF Impoundment would be constructed with a synthetic barrier (compacted soil and 
geomembrane composite liner system) system to inhibit seepage losses to the 
environment. 

Infrastructure 
The following are the other main infrastructure items required for the Project: 

• Upgrading of several kilometers of dirt road from El Resbalón to the Project site with a 
ford crossing, and construction of a proper access road from nearby El Motaje to the 
Project site (approximately 1km); 

• Construction of a bridge crossing for access from the underground mine portal (south of 
arroyo) to the mill area (north of arroyo) including traffic of loaded mining trucks; 

• Construction of a power line from the 115kV line, part of the National Powerline Net, 
located approximately 3km to the west of the Project, and a step-down substation; 

• Water supply wells and water distribution; 

• Fuel storage facility (tanks within a bermed and lined containment area); 

• Small quarry (to provide backfill material for the mining operations); 

• Gatehouse and site fencing; 

• Construction camp (during construction period); 

• Administration building and changehouse/mine dry; 

• Maintenance workshop and warehouse; and 

• Assay laboratory facility. 
Environmental and Permitting 
The Animas/Del Norte project is developed under norms and regulations that SEMARNAT 
addresses under the Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente 
(LGEEPA, which is the acronym in Spanish of the General Law for Ecological Equilibrium and 
Environmental Protection).  Given the nature of the project, an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) is required to comply with this Environmental Law.  Nayarit Gold and its 
consultants are in progress preparing the EIA, and it is expected to be submitted in mid-March 
2010. 

Specific reclamation objectives for the Animas/Del Norte project will include: 

• Reduction of long-term erosion potential through use of engineered slopes and best 
management practices (e.g. achievement of a natural land form);

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 5, 2010 
Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

• Management of surface water run-on in a manner that promotes clean diversion of 
surface water and reduces the potential for erosion in reclaimed areas; and 

• Placement of appropriate soil cover materials or amendments on the tailings and stockpile 
facilities to achieve dust control objectives. 

At present, the reclamation and closure cost estimate is a budgetary figure of US$2.1million.  
This estimate will vary based on the final Mine Plan of Operations and the conceptual level 
closure plan for the property. 

Project Economics 
The indicative economic results summarized below are based upon work performed by SRK.  
The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered 
too speculative, geologically, to have the economic considerations applied to them that would 
enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the conclusions 
reached in the PEA will be realized.  Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not 
have demonstrated economic viability. 

Table 1 shows LoM capital costs.  Estimated initial capital is US$35million.  An additional 
US$20million will be required to meet sustaining capital requirements, including US$14million 
attributed to underground mine development.  LoM capital will therefore be about 
US$56million.

Table 2 summarizes LoM operating costs.  Over the LoM, operating costs will be about US$65/t 
of ore milled.  These costs do not include capitalized mine development.

The financial results of this report are based upon work performed by SRK and has been 
prepared on an annual basis.  All costs are in Q4 2009 US constant dollars. 

The analysis results, shown in Table 3, indicate an NPV of US$35million at an 8% discount rate 
with an IRR of 38%.  Payback will be in 2.25 years from the start of production.

The following provides the basis of the SRK LoM plan and economics: 

• Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources are included; 

• A mine life of five years, at a designed plant throughput rate of 750t/d; 

• An overall average metallurgical recovery rate of 92% Au and 88% Ag over the LoM; 

• A cash operating cost of US$320.27/AuEq oz; 

• Mine closure cost, included in the above estimates is US$2million; and 

• The analysis does not include provision for salvage value. 
The project is slightly more sensitive (about 10%) to market price given the relatively small 
resource and the inherent high costs associated with underground mining.  The project exhibits 
virtually similar sensitivities to capital and operating costs.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
The scope of this study was intended for the use of Nayarit to further the evaluation of the 
Animas/Del Norte Project by providing a mineral resource estimate, (with classification of 
resources in accordance with the CIM classification system), and a preliminary assessment of the 
economic evaluation of the property.  It is SRK's opinion that the resource model described in 
this report can be used for preliminary economic evaluation, and is appropriate for assessing 
project viability, and determining suitable advancement of the Project.  The PEA results justify 
advancing the Project to a Pre-Feasibility Study. 

Some additional drilling is anticipated, and metallurgical, hydrogeological, and environmental 
studies have been undertaken, or are still in progress.  Geotechnical and other studies could be 
implemented in the near future.  Current studies show that the Animas/Del Norte deposit can be 
mined by conventional underground mining methods, and processed by well-established 
processing techniques. 

The Project is not remote, as readily available services (including power) and land transportation 
routes are close to the Project site.  Based on field observations, available geologic data, 
metallurgical testwork, hydrogeology study, preliminary tailings study, available environmental 
data and other PEA work, SRK's opinion is that there are no serious flaws to the Project. 

The objectives moving forward should be focused on progressing the project through a Pre-
Feasibility Study, and pending positive economic results at that stage, onto a Feasibility Study. 

SRK acknowledges that a significant amount of exploration and development level work has 
been previously conducted.  The following work programs are recommended: 

Exploration and Development 

• Construct 3-D geologic models, using existing logged lithology data for the Animas/Del 
Norte-Pantaleona, La Estrella and San Francisco areas; 

• Conduct additional geochemical and mapping studies on surrounding concessions, in 
order to rank and define drill targets to potentially increase resources; 

• Conduct infill drilling to assess underground mining potential at the Pantaleona, La 
Estrella and San Fransisco zone to potentially increase underground resources; and 

• Implement more rigorous QA/QC protocols for future sampling programs, and actively 
monitor results. 

Geotechnical - Mining 
SRK recommends that a minimum of three core holes be drilled using a triple tube sampling 
barrel for geotechnical characterize the in-situ materials.  Geotechnical logging should be carried 
out at the drill rig by a trained geotechnical engineer or geologist prior to boxing and 
transportation of the core. 

Core samples should be collected during the program for laboratory strength testing at a 
frequency of approximately 30m, or more frequently where significant rock type or strength 
changes are encountered.  A laboratory testing program consisting of uniaxial and triaxial 
compressive strengths will be necessary to characterize intact rock strengths.

Geotechnical - Tailings 
SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the pre-feasibility level TSF 
design: 

• Trade-off studies for alternate locations for the next level of evaluation; 

• Confirmation of containment requirements from a permitting and environmental risk 
perspective; 

• Detailed topographic survey in areas where necessary to fill in detail to +/- 2m accuracy; 

• Field investigation including field reconnaissance; geotechnical program (boreholes and 
test pits); and hydrogeology study of the impoundment area; 

• Tailings characterization.  Laboratory test work should be done to confirm tailings design 
assumptions (densities and water contents); 

• Pre-feasibility level engineering (sideslope design, slope stability, water balance, etc); 
and 

• Diversion channel investigations as required. 
Hydrogeology 
SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the pre-feasibility level 
hydrogeology program: 

• Additional packer isolated airlift testing from individual intervals in three new 
geotechnical holes proposed to be drilled to determine the hydraulic properties of rocks 
and structures that may be encountered within the underground mine footprint to pre-
feasibility requirements; 

• Installation of 3 standpipe piezometers in these geotechnical holes for long term 
groundwater monitoring; 

• Groundwater sample collection and analysis as part of the planned geotechnical (and 
other) future drilling activities; and 

• Numerical 3-D hydrogeological modeling to estimate groundwater inflow rates and 
potential dewatering requirements for the proposed underground mine, and associated 
environmental impacts. 

Underground Mining 
SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the pre-feasibility level 
reserve estimation and mine design program: 

• Identify geotechnical regions for the economic portion of the mineralization based on the 
results of the geotechnical drilling program and re-logging of selected core drillholes; 

• Determine maximum excavation sizes for development (supported) and longhole stoping 
(unsupported) for each geotechnical region; 

• Update mine design based on geotechnical regions; 

• Optimize development layout;

feasibility level standards; 

• Further investigations to optimize plant design and operations, specifically use of 
alternative oxidants or additives to possibly improve leach kinetics, particularly for silver; 

• Settling and filtration tests (for solid liquid separation to produce a clear solution from 
which silver and gold are precipitated); 

• Further investigation into gravity recovery options including treatment of the gravity 
concentrate; 

• Investigations of ore variability and continuous closed circuit tests (determination of 
build-up of metals or other products in recycled solids and solution streams); 

• Investigations into heap leach testing of crushed ores including fine crushing and 
agglomeration; 

• Further investigations into flotation performance to investigate grade recovery data and 
ore variability.  This would include batch and locked cycle testwork. 

• Investigation of deportment and potential build up of copper in the solution circuit and 
the effect on reagent consumptions and precious metal recoveries; and 

• Investigation into the possible recovery of cyanide associated with copper in the plant 
tails for possible reuse in the circuit could be investigated. 

General 

• Complete preparation of the EIA and submit to SEMARNAT in mid-March 2010; 

• Complete a Pre-Feasibility Study to further advance the Project; and 

• Conduct pre-feasibility level trade-off studies between heap leach, gravity, CCD and 
flotation processing, or a combination thereof, to optimize project economics.

1 Introduction (Item 4) 
SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) was commissioned by Nayarit Gold Inc. (Nayarit or 
Company) to prepare a National Instrument 43-101 compliant (NI 43-101) Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (PEA) of the Animas/Del Norte Zone (Animas/Del Norte) which is a part 
of the Orion Project (Project), located in the Motaje mining district in the Municipality of 
Acaponeta, Nayarit, Mexico.  The Orion Project is owned by Nayarit Gold Inc. that incorporated 
a wholly-owned subsidiary in Mexico, Nayarit Gold de México, S.A.de C.V., to directly hold 
100% interest in the titles to the concessions and to operate in Mexico.  The report also mentions 
other exploration projects held by Nayarit as part of the Orion Project.  This assessment is a 
preliminary view of the Project concept and includes a preliminary economic analysis.  There is 
no certainty that the conclusions reached in the PEA will be realized. 

1.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose of the Report 
This PEA is intended for the use of Nayarit for the further development and advancement of the 
Project towards the pre-feasibility stage.  It provides a mineral resource estimate, a classification 
of resources in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 
(CIM) classification system and an evaluation of the property.  This PEA includes the potential 
mining of Inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the 
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 
reserves.  Therefore, the term "mineable resource" is used in lieu of "reserves" to describe 
mineable quantities in this report. 

This report meets the requirements for NI 43-101 and conforms to Form 43-101F1 for technical 
reports.  The Resource and Reserves definitions are as set forth in the Appendix to Companion 
Policy 43-101CP, Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) - Definitions 
Adopted by CIM Council, November 2005. 

1.2 Reliance on Other Experts (Item 5) 
SRK's opinion contained herein is based on information provided to SRK by Nayarit throughout 
the course of SRK's investigations, which in turn reflect various technical and economic 
conditions at the time of writing.  Given the nature of the mining business, these conditions can 
change significantly over relatively short periods.  Consequently, actual results may be 
significantly more or less favorable. 

This report includes technical information that may require subsequent calculations to derive 
sub-totals, totals and weighted averages.  Such calculations inherently involve a degree of 
rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error.  Where these occur, SRK does not 
consider them to be material. 

1.2.1 Sources of Information 
The sources of information include data and reports supplied by Nayarit personnel, as well as 
documents included/referenced in Section 20 References, as well as relying on personal 
experience with the subject deposit.  SRK used its experience to determine if the information 
from previous reports was suitable for inclusion in this PEA and adjusted information that 
required amending.  Revisions to previous data were based on research, recalculations and 
information from other projects.  The level of detail utilized was appropriate for this level of 
study.

provide its clients with conflict-free and objective recommendations on crucial judgment issues.  
SRK has a demonstrated record of accomplishment in undertaking independent assessments of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, project evaluations and audits, technical reports, and 
independent evaluations to bankable standards on behalf of exploration and mining companies 
and financial institutions worldwide.  The SRK Group has also worked with a large number of 
major international mining companies and their projects, providing mining industry consultancy 
service inputs. 

This PEA has been prepared based on a technical and economic review by a team of consultants 
sourced principally from the SRK Group's Denver, US office.  These consultants are specialists 
in the fields of geology, exploration, mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation and 
classification, underground mining, mineral processing and mineral economics. 

Neither SRK nor any of its employees and associates employed in the preparation of this report 
has any beneficial interest in Nayarit.  SRK will be paid a fee for this work in accordance with 
normal professional consulting practice.

2 Property Description and Location (Item 6) 
2.1 Property Location 
The Animas/Del Norte Zone is part of the Orion Project, located in the Motaje mining district in 
the Municipality of Acaponeta, Nayarit, Mexico (as shown in Figure 1-1).  The co-ordinates of 
the project site are 22°25' north latitude; 105°16' west longitude. 

The Project lies in the prolific Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), which hosts numerous multi-
million ounce gold-silver deposits.  The Project is one of the larger contiguous concessions in the 
Sierra Madre, composed of more than +110,000ha.  The Project is located on the SE flank of the 
Sierra Madre, about 125km south of the famous Tayoltita district, which has reserves reported to 
be +20Moz AuEq. 

The Project is located approximately 110km north–northwest of Tepic, state capital of Nayarit, 
México, 150km southeast of Mazatlan, Sinaloa.  The Project is well situated having excellent 
infrastructure including a railroad, major power transmission line and the Pan American 
Highway passing through it.  The terrain is gently rolling hills which will allow for ease of 
construction as the project is pushed towards production. 

2.2 Mineral Titles

All of the mining concessions described in Section 2.2 of this document are effective and free of 
any liens or encumbrances whatsoever. 

2.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 
Mining and exploration activities in Mexico are regulated for environmental issues by the Ley 
General de Equilibrio Ecológico y Protección al Ambiente (LGEEPA) through several legal 
instruments.  The Orion exploration project was initially following the Norm NOM-120-
SEMARNAT-1997 for exploration projects.  Nevertheless that Norm applies for exploration 
projects, the environment surrounding the exploration location is different to the one described in 
the referred Norm.  This issue makes the project to be regulated by different norms and 
instruments.  An Informe Preventivo was generated to comply with the regulations. 

2.5.1 Required Permits and Status 
Given the nature of the project, authorities identified that an Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA), rather than an Informe Preventivo, is required to comply with the LGEEPA.  
SEMARNAT notified Nayarit Gold of this resolution by the official document Oficio No. 
138.01.00.01/2307/09 dated in June 16, 2009. 

2.5.2 Compliance Evaluation 
Nayarit Gold and its consultants are in progress preparing the EIA, progress is advanced, and it is 
expected to be submitted in mid-March 2010.  The EIA must comply with 18 considerations 
given in the document titled Respuesta a Informe Preventivo, which states why the EIA is 
required.  The referred document also gives four resolutions as bases for the completion of the 
permitting process through the elaboration and approval of an EIA.  Activities in the exploration 
project will restart once the mentioned approval is obtained.

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography (Item 7) 

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
Topography at the Motate Carrizo is characterized by moderate relief, with elevations ranging 
between a maximum of 620m above sea level (masl) at Cerro Verde northwest of El Carrizo, to 
minimums on the order of 60masl in the valley west of the range between El Cangrejo and 
Zavala.  In the area of the Project, the elevation varies between 100masl and 300masl.  The main 
topographic features of the area are the northwest–trending La Estrella ridge, Cerro Verde, Cerro 
La Pedregosa northeast of La Estrella, El Salto de Tecapán and Cerro El Vigía south of La 
Estrella.  The principal drainage is the Tecapán stream, which cross cuts the range from south of 
the El Carrizo ranch in the east to the El Cangrejo ranch in the west and joins the San Francisco 
River, which flows to the west to an estuary on the coast. 

In the area of the concessions, more than 40 different species of plants have been identified and 
can be generally grouped as oak tree forests and sub-caducifolia and sub-perennifolia scrub trees 
and bush forest.  The northern slope of the Pedregoso ridge is primarily a forest of different 
species of oak trees of which the Yellow Oak (Quercus magnoliifolia), is predominant.  Other 
varieties of Quercus include Q. Castanea, Q. Glaucoides and Q, splendens.  The Southern slope 
and lower parts of the Pedregoso ridge are characterized by species of subcaducifolia and sub-
perennifolia scrub trees and bush forest with a predominance of Cuapinol (Hymeanea courbaril), 
Guanacastle (Enterolobium cyclocarpum) Achiote (Apeiba tibourbou), and Rasca la vieja 
(Curatella americana).  The main use of vegetation in the region is for human consumption, 
wood for fuel, fence poles, furniture making and a few edibles.  It has been observed in some 
reports that local vegetation has partially been altered due to forest fires, as well as deforestation 
resulting from agriculture and the raising of cattle. 

3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
The general climate in the region is warm and sub-humid with a distinct rainy season between 
June and September, which commonly extends through October.  The predominant wind 
direction is southeast to northwest.  Average annual rainfall is in the order of 1,307mm of which 
92% falls from July to September.  A secondary winter rainy season is commonly present in 
January to February.  The annual mean temperature is 26.7°C, with a range between 13.6 and 
28.4°C.  The climate classification is Aw2 (Koppen).  Exploration work can be carried out year-
round at the Project. 

3.3 Physiography 
The Orion project is located on the western flank of the SMO, a mountain range that comprises 
the central spine of northern Mexico.  The north-northwest-trending SMO is composed of a 
relatively flat-lying sequence of Tertiary volcanic rocks that forms a volcanic plateau.  The SMO 
gives way to the west to an extensional terrane that represents the southward continuation of the 
Basin and Range Province of the western United States, and then further west to the coastal plain 
of western Mexico.  The property lies at the boundary of the Mexican Basin and Range Province 
and the coastal plain.  The Orion project area is hilly, but not mountainous, with densely 
vegetated, steep-sided slopes.  The hills are cut by a number of intermittent streams (arroyos) 
that flood in the June to September rainy season.

3.4 Access to Property 
Access to the Project site is from Tepic, state capital of Nayarit, Mexico via 220km of multi-lane 
paved toll road to Acaponeta near the Nayarit–Sinaloa state border (Figure 2-1).  Approximately 
12km south of Acaponeta at km 123, a 3.5km long all-weather gravel road to the east, leads to 
the town of El Resbalón, with a population of of approximately 900.  Primary access to the 
Project is located 10km to the east, towards the El Motaje ranch, where a secondary dirt road 
passes northward towards the La Estrella mineralized area.  A second access road connecting the 
Motaje ranch and the La Estrella zone has been maintained by Nayarit Gold since 2005. 

3.5 Surface Rights 
According to Mexican legislation, surface rights are not part of mining concessions and requires 
that specific purchase or rental agreements with property owners must be fulfilled.  At 
Animas/Del Norte, La Estrella, San Francisco and most of the northern exploration targets within 
the Orion Project surface rights are held by the Indigenous Community of San Blasito and 
annexes of the Acaponeta municipality based in the village of Motaje, southeast of La Estrella.  
Nayarit Gold has established private agreements with local communities to obtain permission for 
exploration activities.  In all cases, the main responsibility agreed to by Nayarit Gold is to give 
priority to the local population for the non-specialized jobs created by the advancement of the 
Project, provide them with mandatory Social Security registration and assist with mobile 
equipment support for improvement of access roads to the neighboring communities. 

3.5.1 San Blasito Community 
Surface rights are held by the "Comunidad Indígena San Blasito y sus Anexos" based in Motaje,

3.6 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
The Project is about 110km northwest of Tepic (the state capital of Nayarit, Mexico) which has 
excellent infrastructure including a railroad, major power transmission line and the Pan 
American Highway. 

Acaponeta (22km from site) has a population of approximately 18,000.  Various infrastructure 
including hotels, hospitals, schools, telephone, telegraph, mail, and other public services are 
available there.  Services in Acaponeta also include pre–college preparatory and college-level 
technological schooling and branches of the State University.  Technological training is 
primarily focused on the agricultural and cattle raising industries (CET Institute).  The nearby 
town of El Resbalón has a population of approximately 900.  Public services in El Resbalón 
include electrical power, public lighting, water, trash collection, health services and police.  
Basic health services are available at Motaje and El Resbalón, while 12 primary–level health 
services centers and two regional hospitals are located within the municipality. 

The area surrounding the site is generally sparsely populated and includes some cattle raising and 
cultivation of market crops, which make up most of land use.  Agricultural produced from the 
area includes corn, beans, nuts, sorghum, avocados and a variety of other fruits and vegetables.  
Local activities in the municipality of Acaponeta include agriculture with 18,000ha of corn,

3.6.1 Access Road and Transportation 
Highway 15 is located 7.5km to the southwest of the Project and the Guadalajara–Nogales TFM 
railway is located 5km to the southwest, at the town of El Resbalón.  Upgrading of the dirt road 
from the Project site to El Resbalón will be required.  A ford for crossing a stream (near El 
Resbalón) for heavy loads (mainly during construction) would also be needed. 

The closest population center is Acaponeta, where local produce including coffee, beans, 
tomatoes and corn flour is transported for distribution.  A 1,000m long, unpaved fixed wing 
airstrip and two bus depots for local and external transportation are also available in Acoponeta.  
The closest railway station is located at Acaponeta.  The closest deep-sea port is located in 
Mazatlan, Sinaloa. 

3.6.2 Power Supply 
A major 115KV line, part of the National Powerline Net, is located approximately 3km to the 
west of the Animas/Del Norte site area.  Major power stations are located in Mazatlán (208MW) 
and Tepic (960MW).  The closest main substation to the Project site is located in Acaponeta.  
Therefore, in order for the Project to utilize power from the existing nearby power lines a new 
substation would need to be constructed. 

Low voltage (110V to 220V) residential electrical power services are available at El Resbalón 
and El Motaje through local 13.2kV power lines. 

3.6.3 Water Supply 
Water for industrial mining and mineral processing purposes is not readily available, and will 
need to be sourced from nearby water wells that will be required to be drilled. 

3.6.4 Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 
There are currently no buildings or facilities at the Project site, other than an exploration drilling 
camp.  A project office and small camp is located in the town of Acaponeta.  Drill core and 
samples are stored at Nayarit's secure facilities in Acaponeta. 

3.6.5 Camp Site 
The current exploration drilling camp site is on the south side of the Project site.  A small camp 
capable of accommodating eight professional staff is located in the town of Acaponeta.  A 
construction camp would be required to be built near the Project site.  Permanent facilities will 
be constructed to meet the requirements of the Project. 

3.6.6 Tailings Storage Area 
There is no tailings storage facility (TSF) currently on the property.  Conventional TSF sites are 
being investigated, as are alternative methods of tailings disposal. 

3.6.7 Waste Disposal Area 
There is no waste disposal facility currently on the property.  Waste disposal sites are currently 
being investigated. 

Waste from development of the underground access decline will be placed near to the planned 
underground mine portal, and will all be used subsequently as stope backfill material.  A small 
quarry will be required to provide waste material for backfill, and will be located above the 
planned underground mine area.

3.6.8 Manpower 
Unskilled labor is widely available in the region; and the current unemployment rate is moderate.  
Skilled laborers and mining professionals would need to be sourced from outside the region.  It is 
expected that some of the labor will be provided by engaging contractors (such as a mining 
contractor).

4 History (Item 8)  
4.1 Past Exploration and Development 
The Orion project area lies within the Motaje mining district in the Municipality of Acaponeta, 
Nayarit, Mexico.  The district is reported to have had moderate but unknown quantities of gold 
and silver production dating from Spanish colonial times, possibly as early as the late 1500's.  
Many small adits and superficial workings along the district's two main mineralized structural 
trends, the La Estrella – Animas - Pantaleona and the El Rey - La Escondida - Bonanza trends, 
attest to past mining activity. 

The Acaponeta region was originally inhabited by Totorame, Cora, Zayahueco and Tepehuano 
indigenous people belonging to the Aztatlán Kingdom, conquered by Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán 
in July 1530 and Christianized by Franciscan friars, who constructed XVI and XVII Century 
monuments in Acaponeta. 

During the Colonial Period prior to 1821, gold–silver mining activities took place in the area, 
most probably in the San Dionisio–Bonanza mines east of the Project area.  It was not until 1919 
that mining activities resumed at Bonanza, but they were soon suspended due to the Mexican 
Revolution of 1910-1921.  Several small operations were active in the area recently.  All of these 
are within Nayarit Gold's concessions with the exception of the property controlled by Minerales 
Vane, SA de CV. 

A small-scale, 5t/d plant operated between 1955 and 1970 in the Motaje District.  Mr. Roberto 
Adachi and father in law of Evodio Prado of Escuinapa, Sinaloa carried out limited mining at La 
Estrella.  He constructed a small 5t/d flotation plant by the Acaponeta River; with metallurgical 
recoveries of for La Estrella material was reported as "good", (+90% M. Portree, L. Villanueva, 
pers. comm.)  A small operation by was constructed by Minera Nayaloa in the Bonanza mine 
area, 4.7km east of La Estrella, and 15,000t of material was produced from the Motaje District in 
1973.  The Las Ánimas mine in Motaje was operated by Alfredo Parra of Guadalajara around 
1998.  Minerales Vane , S.A. de C.V. is carrying out small scale mining of 1500t/m (in 2007) at 
the Diablito high grade mine in the neighboring Las Lumbres District, located 16km southwest 
of La Estrella.  COREMI, under a services contract with Mr. Evodio Prado, carried out 
exploration activities at the La Estrella area in 1984, that included surface and underground 
surveying and geological mapping and 223m of drifting and sampling with the purpose of 
defining resource/reserve blocks.  Approximately 360t of waste dump material were shipped to 
the Comisión de Fomento Minero "La Minita" process plant.  (Coremi, 1985). 

Mineral exploration was carried out in the Motaje District in the 1980's by Industria Minera 
México, S.A. and Industrias Peñoles, S.A. drilled the Bonanza and Morena veins during the 
years 1985-1987.  COREMI also carried out exploration and sampling of the underground 
workings at La Estrella in 1986. 

Anecdotal information from local sources indicates that Minera Caopas entered and explored the 
San Francisco area in 1986–1987, completing 21 drillholes and carrying out some development 
drifting and cross cutting and minor stoping at La Sebastiana mine. 

Recent mineral exploration in the Orion Project area has been primarily conducted by Minera 
Lac de México, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Lac Minerals (USA), Inc. and by Nayarit Gold - 
Minera Portree.

Lac Minerals (Minera Lac) conducted an exploration program at the La Estrella and Orión 
concessions between 1993 and 1994, which was discontinued immediately following the merger 
of Lac Minerals with American Barrick, Inc.  Reconnaissance mapping and sampling by Lac 
Minerals covered the La Estrella and Orión concessions over an area of approximately 2,000ha, 
with additional detailed mapping, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveying over a 
central area covering 4km2 at La Estrella.  Minera Lac's exploration files were made available to 
Nayarit Gold for review. 

Lac Minerals carried out a reverse circulation-drilling program in 1994 at the Orion Project: 
drilling 2,461m in 21 holes with an average depth of 117m. 

4.2 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 
COREMI (May 1986) reported "Proven and Probable Reserves" of 74,361t with an average 
grade of 7.62g/t Au and 2.0g/t Ag contained in two blocks at La Estrella.  This estimate is not 
current and comparison cannot be made to accepted CIM Definition Standards and is reported 
here for informational purposes only.  It is also unknown if these blocks were partially mined-out 
later.  This reported historical "reserve" inventories cannot be considered a mineral resource or a 
mineral reserve under CIM guidelines as economic parameters used to derive the estimates do 
not reflect accurately the current economics of exploiting these deposits.  Furthermore, 
procedures and data used have not been reviewed and verified by a Qualified Person and 
therefore cannot be classified as a mineral resource under Canadian Securities Administrators NI 
43-101 guidelines.  In all cases, insufficient documentation exists that would allow SRK to 
classify this historic reserve estimate into the categories as currently defined by CIM guidelines. 

The Orion project was the subject of a previous technical report (NI-43-101 Technical Report on 
Resources, December, 2009) which considered a combination of potentially minable open pit 
and underground resources (Table 4.2.1).  Based on further analysis of processing and mining 
alternatives and results of economic trade-off studies the open pit alternative is not considered to 
be a preferred alternative.  Therefore, this report addresses the potential underground mining of 
the Animas/Del Norte zones.

5 Geologic Setting (Item 9) 
5.1 Regional Geology 
The Orion project is located along the western edge of the SMO, a north-northwest trending 
volcanic plateau.  The SMO extends over 2,000km from the U.S. – Mexico border to southern 
Nayarit State where it is overlain by the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt.  The SMO separates the 
southward extension of the Basin and Range Province of the southwestern United States into two 
parts.  Sedlock et al. (1993) suggested calling these two areas of extension the eastern and 
western Mexican Basin and Range provinces.  Orion is located on the boundary between the 
SMO and the Coastal Plain of the Pacific Ocean. 

Cenozoic igneous rocks in northern Mexico, including the SMO, are generally thought to reflect 
subduction-related continental arc magmatism that slowly migrated eastward during the early 
Tertiary and then retreated westward more rapidly, reaching the western margin of the continent 
by the end of the Oligocene (Sedlock et al., 1993).  The eastward migration is represented in the 
SMO by the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene "lower volcanic series (LVS)" or Nacozari Group, of 
calc-alkaline composition.  In Chihuahua and Durango, the LVS includes over 2,000m of 
predominantly andesitic volcanic rocks, with some interlayered ash flows and associated 
intrusions.  Rhyolitic ignimbrites and flows, with subordinate andesite, dacite, and basalt, formed 
during Eocene and Oligocene caldera eruptions.  In the central part of the Sierra, these volcanic 
rocks form a one-kilometer-thick unit that unconformably overlies the LVS andesitic rocks and 
constitutes the "upper volcanic supergroup (UVS)" of the SMO (Sedlock et al., 1993).  The UVS 
is also commonly referred to as the upper volcanic series, or Yecora Group.  The ignimbrites are 
gently dipping to flat lying.  Both major units are thinner in northern Nayarit in the Orion Project 
area.  All mineralized host rocks in the project area of andesitic, dacitic or rhyolitic composition 
are considered part of the LVS.  Flat lying ignimbrites and possibly rhyolitic intrusive rocks are 
considered part of the UVS.  The coastal plain is underlain by similar volcanic rocks to those 
found in the Sierra Madre.  Much of the coastal plain is thinly covered by Pleistocene to 
Holocene littoral sediments deposited by wave action, storms or Aeolian processes.  A 
generalized geologic map adapted from maps by the Servicio Geologico Mexicano is shown in 
Figure 5-1. 

The geology of the area is characterized by Early to Mid-Tertiary volcanic rocks locally cut by 
shallow, fine-grained to porphyritic intrusive rocks.  This assemblage is typical of the SMO, and 
extends through eastern Sonora, and western Chihuahua, western Durango, Sinaloa and Nayarit 
States.  Age dates from nearby study areas in Nayarit State (El Indio, El Zopilote, Santa Maria 
del Oro) suggest that the UVS ignimbrites are younger than those described in Chihuahua and 
Durango and have ages ranging from 20 – 22 Ma (Camprubi, Ferrari, et al, 2003).  Rock textures 
and composition are similar to the main SMO, but felsic units are more abundant in the LVS 
rocks than is observed in the LVS rocks. 

The northern portion of Nayarit Gold's concessions includes a number of epithermal veins, 
which are developed along east-west fracture systems.  Mineralized veins form two discrete 
mineralized corridors separated by about 2km from one another.  The southern mineralized 
corridor includes the Animas/Del Norte veins and the Pantaleona, San Francisco and La Estrella 
veins, which generally dip to the north.  The La Estrella structure is a northwest striking splay off 
the Del Norte vein.  The northern corridor includes the El Rey, La Escondida, El Carmen,

Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

Bonanza 1 veins, which generally dip to the south and includes the previously producing 
Bonanza mine, which is in a mining concession controlled by Minerales Vane internal to Nayarit 
Gold's land package. 

Stratigraphic displacement indicates that a graben exists between the Animas/Del Norte vein 
system and the El Rey – Bonanza vein system.  Younger rocks outcrop between the two 
structural zones and somewhat older rocks outcrop to the north of El Rey – Bonanza and to the 
south of Animas/Del Norte.  Other regional structure is manifested by a large number of parallel 
NW trending fracture sets that are apparent on both satellite and aerial photos, but which have 
not been definitively correlated with fault structures in the field.  These NW trending fractures 
may post date mineralization. 

5.1.1 Host Rocks 
The northern part of the Orion project is underlain by a thick sequence of andesite flows and 
pyroclastic rocks belonging to the LVS, sandwiched between rhyolite pyroclastic rocks near the 
base of the stratigraphic section and the UVS rhyolites at the top of the stratigraphy.  Andesite 
dikes penecontemporaneous with the mineralization occur within and parallel to mineralized 
fault structures.  A rhyolite dike, which is relatively unaltered, parallels the main mineralized 
zone from San Francisco in the west to Animas/Del Norte in the east. 

5.1.2 Alteration 
Argillic alteration is common in both the Upper Volcanic Series ignimbrites and in the LVS 
andesites.  Near mineralized zones at the Orion project, argillic alteration develops first as 
selective alteration of feldspar which are altered to white clay.  More proximal to veins, the 
argillic alteration becomes pervasive and destructive of original rock textures.  No PIMA work 
has been done to identify the clay minerals. 

Silicification occurs within the veins and within a few centimeters to perhaps a few meters from 
the vein boundaries.  Rock fragments in vein breccias are commonly silicified, but the wallrock a 
few meters outside of the vein boundaries are usually propylitically or argillically altered. 

Quartz veining is the most diagnostic feature of the deposits.  Quartz veins and multiple event 
vein/breccias develop true widths up to 30m.  Textures in the veins vary from crystalline quartz 
to fine grained sugary quartz to chalcedony.  Colloform bands and cockade texture are common. 

Acid sulfate alteration is well-developed at the La Estrella prospect.  This alteration type is 
characterized by white clay (kaolite, +- alunite) replacing the original texture of the rock.  
Similar alteration occurs at the Yago project 50km south of Nayarit Gold's southern claim 
boundary. 

5.1.3 Structure 
Prominent northwest trending structural features are apparent on both topographic maps and 
satellite imagery.  One of these features is interpreted to be a range bounding fault with the 
western side down dropped.  This structure lies just west of the La Estrella prospect and marks 
the western limit of major relief in the northern part of the Orion project.  It is postulated that 
these NW trending structures are among the youngest in the district and are likely post mineral.  
The principal mineralized structures strike east west and are interpreted to have a significant 
component of normal movement, with subordinate left lateral movement.  Left lateral flexures in 
these structures form dilatant zones and permeable fluid pathways where ascending mineralizing

solutions have deposited gold and silver.  Portions of the district are characterized by northeast 
trending mineralized structures.  Neighboring small mines and exploration projects (Los 
Lumbres, La Nueva Victoria and Yago) all have mineralized veins, which occur along northeast 
trending structures. 

5.2 Project Geology 
5.2.1 Animas/Del Norte Geology 
Animas/Del Norte is the southernmost of two major mineralized corridors defined at the project, 
each more than 4km long.  This zone extends from the La Estrella and San Francisco areas east 
through Animas/Del Norte and further east to Pantaleona.  The wall rocks are andesite porphyry 
to the south of the Del Norte vein (Atc) and andesite lithic tuff (Atcl) north of the vein.  The 
juxtaposition of these units suggests at least 100m of dip slip movement along the vein.  
Evidence for minor left lateral movement is also observed.  The Animas and Del Norte veins 
develop their greatest widths along a left lateral flexure within the district scale east-west quartz 
vein system.  This bend in the structure is evident on the accompanying geologic map (Figure 5-
1) and affects a parallel rhyolite dike as well as the quartz veins.  The dilational zone related to 
this structural bend is approximately 600m long and corresponds to the most highly mineralized 
portion of the Del Norte vein. 

The Del Norte vein strikes 282° and dips 75 to 80° to the northeast.  The vein is strongly 
brecciated, and displays evidence of post mineral brecciation.  This late brecciation results in 
recessive weathering the vein, and the vein does not form prominent outcrops.  This is likely the 
reason why the vein was not discovered by earlier workers in the area, and remains unmined to 
date.  The Del Norte vein varies in true width from 5 to over 30m in drill intercepts.  The surface 
outcrops seldom exceed 3m in width. 

The Las Animas vein lies about 40m south of the Del Norte vein and is near parallel in strike.  
Host rocks on both sides of the vein are andesite porphyry (Atc).  The Las Animas vein strikes 
270° and dips 60 to 70° to the south.  The vein has been traced on surface for more than 500m 
along strike.  The vein is moderately brecciated and locally forms more resistant outcrops than 
the Del Norte vein.  This vein was subject to very small-scale mining activity as recently as the 
late 1990's.  One hundred meters south of the Las Animas vein a rhyolite dike 15m wide 
parallels the Animas/Del Norte vein.  Limited drill intersections indicate that this dike is 
relatively unaltered and has a near vertical dip. 

5.2.2 Pantaleona Geology 
The Pantaleona zone is located 800m east-southeast of the Animas/Del Norte area and is hosted 
within the same structure.  Mineralization at Pantaleona is also hosted within the northwest and 
east-west trending fracture systems.  Stockwork zones at Pantaleona reach widths of up to 30m.  
Andesite wall rocks (Atcl) at Pantaleona are present in the hanging wall of the vein.  The 
footwall of the vein is andesite porphyry (Atc) to a depth of about 200m.  Rhyolitic rocks (Rtl) 
located below this level are not considered equally favorable for mineralization. 

5.2.3 San Francisco Geology 
The San Francisco zone is located 1,500m west of the Animas/Del Norte area and probably 
represents the western extension of the Del Norte vein.  Host rocks to the north of the vein at San 
Francisco are andesite, and to the south of the vein, andesite overlies sandstone (SS) which in

turn overlies Rtl rocks.  Clay alteration is dominant, possibly due to weathering of pyrite 
developed several meters on either side of the vein and silicification is developed along the vein 
margins.  Historic mining along this vein reached a depth of only 40m below the surface.  The 
San Francisco vein strikes 275° and dips 80° north.  The vein ranges from 2m to 8m in width. 

5.2.4 La Estrella Geology 
The geology of the La Estrella area has been described in the previous Technical Report 
authored by Beher Dolbear de Mexico.  The target area is underlain by andesite porphyry (Atc) 
and fine-grained andesite (Af) which appear to be textural variations within a thick andesitic 
sequence.  The rocks are intensely argillized to a soft, white rock making it difficult to identify 
the protolith.  This is interpreted to be acid sulfate alteration in the steam-heated zone at the very 
top of a low-sulfidation type system, similar to alteration observed across the rest of the project 
area.  The La Estrella structure is related to and splays off from the Animas/Del Norte structure.  
The structural zone ranges from 8 to more than 20m in width, strikes from 290 to 305° and has 
steep dips to the north.  This structural zone consists of a broad zone of strong silicification and 
brecciation with a series of narrow quartz veins internal to the structural zone.  This target 
structure was the focus of Nayarit Gold's exploration program from 2005-2007.  Significant 
potential exists at depth at the La Estrella target. 

5.2.5 El Rey, La Escondida, El Carmen, Bonanza 1 Geology 
The other major mineralized corridor recognized within the Orion project is hosted within the 
Escondida - Bonanza structure.  This structure is located 2,200m north of the discovery area and 
has been mapped along a strike length of more than 4,200m parallel to Animas/Del Norte.  Host 
rocks are similar to the andesite porphyry at observed at Animas/Del Norte.  In the La Escondida 
area the structural zone has been mapped up to 25m wide.  The main zone strikes 285°, and dips 
60 to 70° south.  The main mineral assemblage observed along this vein is quartz plus well 
crystallized pyrite.  Exploration areas along the Escondida-Bonanza structure that have been drill 
tested include El Rey, La Escondida, El Carmen and Bonanza 1.  There are a number of historic 
workings along this major structure including adits and a shaft at El Rey and a number of 
workings in the El Carmen area.  The Bonanza mine is a historic producer dating back to Spanish 
colonial times.  Significant mineralization similar in mineralogy, texture and silver: gold ratio to 
the Animas/Del Norte veins has been observed on the stockpile of the Bonanza mine.  The 
importance of these observations is that they demonstrate that other ore shoots similar to the Del 
Norte ore shoot may exist along the La Escondida structure.

6 Deposit Type (Item 10) 
6.1 Geological Model 
Gold and silver mineralization documented at the Orion Project has characteristics that 
correspond to models for low to intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins.  This group of gold 
deposits is one of the world's major sources of gold and silver.  The deposits at Animas/Del 
Norte can also be described as polymetallic silver-gold deposits (Corbett and Leach, 1998). 

The mineralized epithermal veins, stockworks and breccias observed at the Project have formed 
during multiple hydrothermal episodes.  The majority of epithermal deposits in Mexico have a 
poly-phase and multi-episodic character, and are the product of several phases or stages of vein 
formation, not all of which are associated with silver-gold mineralization.  Multiple episodes of 
brecciation and variations in vein texture and mineralogy indicate a long-lived complex 
hydrothermal system was present at the Orion project. 

The characteristics observed at Animas/Del Norte that are associated with low 
sulfidation/intermediate sulfidation models include:

7 Mineralization (Item 11) 
The mineralized zones at Animas/Del Norte consist of a series of 2 to 4m wide discrete quartz 
veins within a zone of dense quartz stockwork and breccias, averaging 12m wide and reaching 
widths greater than 25m.  Epithermal textures ranging from colloform banding in chalcedonic 
quartz to cockade texture in crystalline quartz are common.  Nayarit Gold personnel have 
observed that two different mineral assemblages occur in the veins and that one assemblage is 
more favorable for high-grade mineralization.  An early district wide event resulted in the 
formation of crystalline quartz and pyrite, observed in all the known veins in the district.  This 
event is characterized by well-crystallized pyrite and low silver: gold ratios.  The event is gold 
dominant and does have potentially economically mineable grades in several drillholes in the La 
Estrella area.  A later event, characterized by very finely crystalline to chalcedonic quartz, is 
accompanied by very fine pyrite, acanthite/argentite, light colored sphalerite and very minor 
chalcopyrite and galena.  Dark, sulfide rich bands (ginguro bands) and breccia fragments 
containing remnants of such bands are common.  This event has high silver:gold ratios and is the 
dominant style of mineralization observed in the Animas/Del Norte and Pantaleona areas, and is 
less well developed in the San Francisco area.  Only traces of the younger fine-grained 
quartz/argentite event have been observed at La Estrella.  The more favorable silver rich event is 
present along the northern mineralized corridor, but has not been identified in significant 
volumes along at El Rey, La Escondida and Bonanza 1.  It is noted that along the northern vein 
system, the Bonanza mine appears to have this latter mineral assemblage well developed on 
rocks taken from the dumps. 

7.1 Hydrothermal Alteration 
Regional propylitic alteration occurs in intermittent zones throughout the district and increases in 
intensity with proximity to the veins.  This alteration type is characterized by chloritization and 
disseminated pyrite in the andesite lithic tuffs, and as disseminated pyrite and epidote rims on 
plagioclase phenocrysts in the porphyritic andesite. 

Proximal to the mineralized portion of the Del Norte vein, there is a well-developed zone of clay 
alteration (clay bloom).  This argillic alteration extends several tens of meters north of the vein 
into the wall rock.  This alteration is easily observed in outcrop, but does not appear to persist at 
depth, and it is likely that this alteration is due to surface weathering of pyrite.  Although the 
cause of the alteration is not well understood well-developed clay blooms are considered very 
favorable indicators for silver-gold mineralization. 

At the La Estrella prospect, there are large areas characterized by acid-sulfate kaolinite-alunite 
alteration and silica alteration.  Both these styles of alteration occupy areas of relatively higher 
relief on the property and are interpreted to have formed near the original surface or at the paleo-
water table of the hydrothermal system.  In areas of erosion beneath these alteration styles, 
exposed quartz veins exhibit classic low-sulfidation (intermediate-sulfidation) epithermal 
textures, such as banded and crustiform chalcedony and crystalline quartz.  It has been suggested 
by some workers that the acid alteration observed at La Estrella is related to a high-sulfidation 
type epithermal system, but it is considered more likely that the alteration represents the highest 
levels of a typical low-sulfidation system, (H. Stewart, Pers. Comm, 2009).

7.2 Surrounding Rock Types 
The northern part of the Orion project is underlain by a thick sequence of andesite flows and 
pyroclastic rocks sandwiched between rhyolite pyroclastics near the base of the stratigraphic 
section and the UVS rhyolites at the top of the section.  A summary of the principal units, in 
approximate stratigraphic order from youngest to oldest is provided below. 

Rtcl – Rhyolite ignimbrites of the UVS:  A thick sequence of sub-horizontal welded and non-
welded tuffs and pyroclastic breccias.  The welded units have well developed eutaxitic texture.  
The non-welded units are generally well bedded.  Rhyolites cap the highest hills in the project 
area and are, for the most part, younger than mineralization.  Unit includes database codes: RL, 
RTC, RTCL. 

dR – Rhyolite porphyry:  Attributed to the UVS.  Large 2-5mm phenocrysts of quartz occur in a 
finely crystalline groundmass which includes clear feldspar.  This unit is emplaced as a dike 
paralleling the Del Norte vein extending from San Francisco to the west to the east limit of the 
Del Norte vein (not including Pantaleona).  The dike is up to 10m wide and is very resistant to 
erosion, forming steep cliffs along the south side of the Animas hill.  This unit includes database 
codes: R, RP. 

dA – Andesite:  This unit is part of the LVS.  Fine-grained and moderately to strongly magnetic.  
The unit is emplaced as narrow 1-5m dikes interpreted to be sub-parallel to the mineralized Del 
Norte vein system.  The unit has not been observed in outcrop.  This unit is in the database as AF  
distinguishing the dikes from the AF bedded unit is difficult and based on sectional 
interpretation. 

Atcl:  Andesite crystal-lithic tuff.  This unit is part of the LVS, and outcrops in the hangingwall 
(north side) of the Animas/Del Norte and Pantaleona veins.  It is considered to be the most 
favorable host rock.  The unit is dark grey to brown in color and has abundant feldspar 
phenocrysts and minor quartz phenocrysts.  Lithic lapilli of andesite make up 3-5% of the rock.  
The groundmass is grainy and appears slightly porous.  The rock is well fractured, especially 
when silicified.  This unit is represented by database codes ATCL, AL, ATL, B, AV. 

Af:  Andesite, fine-grained.  This unit is part of the LVS.  This unit has a fine-grained to 
aphanitic groundmass and very fine-grained plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts.  The unit appears 
to interfinger with the Atc unit.  Af has been observed in drillholes beneath the Atcl unit in the 
hangingwall (north side) of the Del Norte vein.  This unit is in the database as AF. 

Atc:  Andesite porphyry.  This unit is part of the LVS.  This unit is appears to underlie the Atcl 
unit, but contact relations have not been observed.  The andesite has a medium-grained 
groundmass and abundant phenocrysts of subhedral to euhedral plagioclase feldspar up to 7mm 
long in size.  This unit is extensive throughout the project area and comprises the majority of the 
footwall rock (south side) of the Del Norte vein.  This unit is represented by database codes: 
ATC, AP, A. 

SS:  Volcaniclastic sandstone or well-bedded tuff.  This unit is part of the LVS.  Brown to 
reddish in color, this rock is composed of moderately silica cemented coarse grained, sub angular 
volcaniclastic particles.  It occurs in thin-bedded outcrops that locally exhibit weak cross 
bedding.  This unit outcrops in the San Francisco area.  This unit is represented by a database 
codes: SS.

Rtl: Rhyolite lithic tuff - This unit is part of the LVS.  A welded pyroclastic unit ranging from a 
lithic lapilli tuff to volcanic breccias composed of rhyolite fragments.  This unit forms the base 
of the known stratigraphy.  This unit includes database codes RT and RTL. 

Other codes in the database are:  QAL–alluvium, GOUGE–fault gouge, VC–quartz vein, 
VACIO–open space and DCP–dacite porphyry. 

7.3 Relevant Geological Controls 
The principal geologic controls on mineralization at Animas/Del Norte are a favorable, dilatant 
structural flexure and favorable host rocks.  The highest-grade mineralization for gold and silver 
in the Animas/Del Norte veins is localized in a 200m vertical range from 100m above sea level 
to 100m below sea level.  This favorable horizon is interpreted to be a zone of fluid mixing 
which was probably the principal mechanism of metals deposition.  Evidence for mixing of an 
oxidizing, acid fluid with a reduced, near neutral pH fluid is observed in two overprinted mineral 
assemblages.  A mineral assemblage including argentite/ginguro, light colored sphalerite and low 
temperature quartz locally alternates with a mineral assemblage including hypogene hematite 
(evidence of an oxidizing fluid) and kaolinite (evidence of a low pH fluid).  The hematite and 
kaolinite are best developed in zones with very high gold and silver grades. 

A major bend in the mapped veins crossing the Animas hill is known as the Animas/Del Norte 
Flexure.  This structural bend affects a parallel rhyolite dike 50m south of the veins as well as the 
Animas and Del Norte veins.  Most movement on the faults hosting the veins was normal dip slip 
movement, but a small component of left lateral movement formed a dilatent, permeable zone.  
The widest and highest grade portions of the Animas/Del Norte deposit are in and adjacent to 
this structural flexure. 

The ATCL unit is an andesite lithic tuff with a sufficiently competent matrix to fracture well, and 
is favorable for mineralization.  This rock occurs in the hangingwall of the Del Norte vein 
throughout the vertical extent of the favorable horizon.  The rock unit is also present in the 
hangingwall at Pantaleona and is likely to occur at depth at La Estrella.

8 Exploration (Item 12) 
Nayarit Gold has been exploring the Orion Project since 2004.  Results presented here are a 
combination of data compiled from exploration programs conducted by Nayarit Gold's previous 
management and the exploration and development drilling program conducted by current 
management. 

8.1 Animas/Del Norte 
The Animas and Del Norte areas host the majority of the mineral resources that are the subject of 
this report.  These areas lie almost entirely within the El Magnifico II concession staked by 
Nayarit Mexico on open ground.  When the claim was staked in 2005, Nayarit Gold did not have 
the rights to the surrounding San Juan F-I concession and so did not focus exploration efforts on 
the adjacent El Magnifico II claim which was entirely surrounded by the Minera Caopas/Minera 
Huajicari concessions now optioned to Nayarit Gold.  Nayarit Gold management decided to first 
map and complete a soil-sampling program over the Animas hill and then to drillholes directed at 
the Animas vein.  Drillholes were extended by the company far enough to reach the Del Norte 
vein.  Three hundred thirty seven soil samples were collected on north–south lines spaced 40m 
apart with samples every 25m along the lines.  Drillholes were originally targeted to cut the 
Animas vein, but reached far enough to cut the Del Norte vein as well.  Drillhole OR-07-030, the 
discovery hole, returned 19.47m averaging 2.82g/t Au and 201.66g/t Ag.  Additional holes were 
drilled from south to north before the Company realized that the Del Norte vein dips to the north.  
Subsequent drillhole collars were relocated and drilled from north to south from the hanging wall 
side of the vein, in order to better intersect the true thickness of the vein. 

8.2 Escondida – Bonanza Structure 
A number of targets lie along the Escondida–Bonanza structure located about 2km north of and 
semi-parallel to the Animas/Del Norte structures.  This major structural zone has been traced for 
4,800m along strike, and a series of NW striking splays in the El Carmen area add an additional 
2,600m of strike length.  Complex zones of structural intersections occur at El Rey, El Carmen, 
El Carmen-Bonanza and Bonanza 1.  A structurally less complex zone, but with a very wide 
section of veining and stockwork lies along the same structure and is known as La Escondida. 

8.2.1 Bonanza 1 and El Carmen Bonanza Intersection 
The eastern portion of the Escondida – Bonanza structure is known as the Bonanza 1 target area.  
This target lies immediately west of the past producing Bonanza mine, controlled by Minera 
Vane SA de CV.  The area is underlain by andesite porphyry (Atc) on both the north and south 
sides of the vein.  Over 950m of vein strike length have been mapped on Nayarit Gold's 
concessions.  Immediately west of the Bonanza 1 target is the structurally complex El Carmen-
Bonanza intersection.  Over 1,200m of veins have been mapped in this intersection zone.  
Andesite porphyry (Atc) is the principal host rock in the area.  The rock is moderately to strongly 
clay altered for several meters on both margins of the veins.  The district scale Escondida- 
Bonanza structure crosses this target area, and a number of northwest striking, northeast dipping 
veins splay off this main vein.  An unnamed northeast striking vein, which is interpreted to be a 
dilational zone formed between the Escondida-Bonanza the El Carmen structures and forms a 
triangular zone with the other two structures.  The Escondida-Bonanza structure varies from 3m 
to 15m in width, strikes approximately east–west and dips steeply (65°–75°) to the south.  The El

Carmen structure varies from 0.5 to 3m in width, strikes approximately 300° and dips steeply to 
the northeast.  A splay developed on the north side of the main Bonanza 1 vein dips north and 
has been the focus of limited drilling.  Clay alteration, possibly due to weathering of pyrite, is 
well developed for a few meters to a few tens of meters adjacent to the vein margin.  This target 
has been evaluated using geologic mapping, chip channel sampling in lines spaced 
approximately 30 to 50m along the veins, a soil sample grid and two, limited core drilling 
campaigns. 

Rock Sampling – Bonanza 1 and El Carmen – Bonanza Intersection 
A total of 471 rock chip samples have been collected by Nayarit Gold in the Bonanza 1 and El 
Carmen-Bonanza Intersection areas.  Samples were collected in continuous chip lines, but are 
not as rigorously collected as true channel samples.  Sampling to date has been conducted across 
the El Carmen structure and the La Escondida structure west of the intersection, but has not 
adequately focused on the structural intersection zone.  Of these samples, 60 returned values >= 
0.5g/t Au equivalent, with 32 samples returning values >= 0.5g/t Au, and 39 samples returning 
values >= 30g/t Ag.  Sample locations with assay results and drill collar locations are provided in 
Figure 8-1. 

Soil Sampling – Bonanza 1 and El Carmen – Bonanza Intersection 
A total of 230 soil samples were collected along north-south oriented lines spaced 80m apart on 
25m intervals along each line.  Samplers were instructed to dig down to the color change at the 
base of the B soil horizon or a minimum of 30cm deep.  Samples were screened to -80 mesh in 
the field and analyzed by fire assay/AA for gold and by four acid digestion and ICP for silver 
and multi-element geochem.  The results of this soil sampling, which covers the Bonanza 1 and 
El Carmen-Bonanza Intersection targets are provided in Figure 8-2.  Multiple sample anomalies 
along multiple sample lines confirm the El Carmen-Bonanza Intersection area as an attractive 
untested drill target. 

Drilling – Bonanza 1 and El Carmen – Bonanza Intersection 
A total of 10 core holes totaling 2,405.81m have been completed in the El Carmen-Bonanza 
Intersection area.  A table showing collar locations, orientation and total depths of these holes is 
provided in Table 8.2.1.1.  Tabulated intersection assay results are provided in Table 8.2.1.2.  
Drilling at El Carmen Bonanza Intersection has not confirmed the soil sampling anomalies, and 
it is questionable whether the drillholes were properly oriented as the vein may dip to the south, 
instead of to the north as previously interpreted.  At least two holes oriented south to north from 
the south side of the Escondida-Bonanza structure are planned in the future.

8.2.2 El Carmen 
The El Carmen area has been tested by surface chip channel sampling and by four diamond core 
drillholes.  Two holes were drilled in 2008 and another two were completed in 2009.  Collar 
information for these holes is provided in Table 8.2.2.1, with assay results are provided in Table 
8.2.2.2.  Individual assays in the drillholes are strongly anomalous, but significant grades over 
potentially mineable widths were not encountered in these drilling programs. 

The El Carmen area is a continuation of a vein that splays off to the northwest from the main 
Escondida–Bonanza structure.  Host rocks are primarily andesite porphyry (Atc), with fine-
grained andesite (Af) outcropping along a portion on the south side of the vein.  The rocks are 
bleached, and locally clay altered for several meters ob both margins of the vein.  The structure 
at El Carmen ranges between 0.5m to 5m in width, and strikes approximately 300°, and dipping 
steeply to the northeast.  It is reported that 300m of underground drifting was completed along a 
vein 4m wide at El Carmen (Holcapek, 1992). 

Surface Sampling 
A total of 282 rock chip samples have been collected in the El Carmen area.  Some of the 
samples are located outside of the currently mapped area.  Of the samples collected.  Seventy-
nine returned values >= 0.5g/t Au equivalent, 37 samples returned values >= 0.5g/t Au and 56

8.2.3 La Escondida 
The La Escondida structure is a continuation of the Escondida-Bonanza structure to the west of 
the El Carmen-Bonanza intersection.  This structure has andesite porphyry on both the hanging 
wall and footwall.  A number of old mine workings and prospect pits have been excavated into 
the vein.  There are several minor bends and flexures mapped along the structure, which displays 
a maximum mapped width of 30m. 

Surface Sampling 
A total of 472 surface rock chip samples have been collected at La Escondida.  The area covered 
by sampling extends beyond the area shown in Figure 8-4, which displays sample locations and 
drillhole collar locations.  Most samples were collected as chip – channels across the structure on 
lines spaced approximately 30m.  Of the samples collected, 153 returned values >= 0.5g/t Au 
equivalent, 115 returned values >= 0.5g/t Au and 41 returned values >= 30g/t Ag. 

Drilling 

Seven diamond core holes have been completed totaling 1,685.2m, targeting two structural 
flexures in the La Escondida area.  Drill collar locations and sample locations are shown in 
Figure 8-5.  Drillhole collar information is provided in Table 8.2.3.1, .with tabulated intersection 
assay results shown in Table 8.2.3.2.

8.5 Lazaro Cardenas 
Lazaro Cardenas is located 22km to the south-southwest from the Animas/Del Norte area.  The 
Lazaro Cardenas area was actively explored with drillholes at the same time that Nayarit Gold 
drilled OR-06-030, which is considered the discovery hole for the Animas/Del Norte deposit.  
The area is underlain by rhyolite ignimbrites of the Upper Volcanic Series (UVS).  The rocks are 
iron stained and locally silicified, and a large area of clay alteration and silicification has been 
observed locally along structures ranging from 1 to a maximum of 3m wide. 

8.5.1 Surface Sampling 
A total of 128 surface samples have been collected over several prospecting campaigns in the 
Lazaro Cardenas area.  Of these samples, 13 are channel samples, 87 are rock chip grab samples 
and 28 are float samples.  Of the rock chip and channel samples, 42 samples returned values >= 
0.5g/t Au equivalent, 31 samples returned values >=0.5g/t Au and 23 samples returned values >= 
30g/t Ag. 

8.5.2 Trench Sampling 
A total of 10 trenches were excavated to bedrock at Lazaro Cardenas.  A total of 462 continuous 
channel samples 2m long were collected along these trenches.  Trench locations showing assay 
results and drillhole locations are provided in Figure 8-8. 

8.5.3 Drilling 
Between 2006 and 2007, a total of 7 diamond drillholes were drilled at Lazaro Cardenas for a 
total of 1,360m.  Collar information for drilling at Lazaro Cardenas is provided in Table 8.5.3.1, 
with tabulated assay results provided in Table 8.5.3.2.

8.6 Rosa Amarilla 
The Rosa Amarilla target is located 19km south of the Animas/Del Norte discovery area.  There 
are several old prospects in the area which were developed along quartz veins and stockwork 
zones in altered andesite.  Veins have been mapped along a strike length of approximately 800m, 
dipping 55 to 65° to the northeast and reaching widths of 8m.  A zone to the northwest of the 
area mapped and drilled in 2009 has been identified as a separate anomalous area, with both gold 
and silver values observed in rock chip samples. 

8.6.1 Surface Sampling 
A total of 262 rock samples have been collected from the Rosa Amarilla area.  Most samples 
were grab samples from outcrops.  Sixty-five of these samples returned values >= 0.5g/t Au 
equivalent assays.  Forty-two samples returned values >0.5g/t Au and 44 samples returned values 
>= 30g/t Ag.  The highest values were observed in the Benita area which returned a number of 
significant silver results, including one sample value of 31.8g/t Au and 3,140g/t Ag.  Sample 
results are shown on Figure 8-9. 

8.6.2 Drilling 
Two core holes were drilled at Rosa Amarilla in 2009.  The first hole intersected a stockwork 
zone from 11.3m to 30.75m with anomalous gold and silver values.  The second hole was 
abandoned before reaching the target.  Collar information for these holes is provided in Table 
8.6.2.1, with assay results shown in Table 8.6.2.2.

8.6.3 El Frontal 
The historic El Frontal mine is located 22km southeast of the Animas/Del Norte discovery area.  
Host rocks in the area are rhyolite ignimbrites of the Upper Volcanic Series.  The contact with 
the underlying andesites is observed to be close to the level of portal.  The andesites are 
considered to be the most favorable host rock.  The main vein strikes northeast and dips 
southeast.  Widths up to 2.5m can be observed on the underground mine map.  The mine is 
reported to have conducted 1.5km of underground development (COREMI, 1994), but is caved 
200m in from the portal.  A total of 89 channel samples from both veins and wallrocks were 
collected in the underground workings by Nayarit Gold.  This reconnaissance program 
encountered mineralization up to 6.18g/t Au and up to 179g/t Ag.  It is likely that the main stopes 
located in the inaccessible portions of the mine, have much higher-grade mineralization.  Further 
assessment of the El Frontal area in planned in the future.  Sample results are shown on Figure 8-
10. 

8.6.4 El Chinacate 
The El Chinacate prospect is located 28km southeast of the Animas/Del Norte discovery area.  
This prospect was visited in 2009 as a follow up to positive sample results from samples brought 
to Nayarit Gold by local prospectors.  Host rocks at El Chinacate are andesite and andesite lithic 
tuff that strike to the northwest and dip gently to the northeast.  Alteration is limited to weak 
bleaching in wall rock within a few meters of the veins.  Veins thicknesses were observed from 
0.5 to 1m, wide and were traceable for hundreds of meters. 

8.7 Las Camillas 
The Las Camillas prospect is located 22.5km south from the Las Animas/Del Norte discovery 
area in the Municipality of Teponohuaxtla.  The area is underlain by rhyolite ignimbrites of the 
Upper Volcanic Series which are cut by a series of northeast striking quartz veins.  The veins 
have been traced for 250m of strike length along a line of old prospects.  Vein thicknesses range 
from 0.5 to 1.2m.  Argillic alteration has affected the rhyolites throughout the entire area.  Fifty-
six rock chip samples have been collected from the Las Camillas area.  Sample results are shown 
on Figure 8-11.

8.8 El Junco 
The El Junco prospect is located 6.4km to the northwest of Animas/Del Norte.  The area was 
brought to Nayarit Gold's attention by local prospectors, who reported a small 2m deep adit.  A 
narrow structure strikes 300° and dips steeply to the northeast.  Ten grab samples were collected 
in two visits to El Junco.  The highest values were from a 10cm quartz vein that returned 4.81g/t 
Au and 2.8g/t Ag.  Follow up sampling did not identify any wider zones of mineralization. 

8.9 La Paloma 
The La Paloma prospect is located 16km south of the Animas/Del Norte area.  Surface pits 
excavated up to 10m wide follow a 1.5m wide quartz vein over a strike length of more than 
100m.  A second prospecting area is located 100m to the southwest.  The total length of this zone 
is at least 200m long.  The vein strikes 30° and dips steeply to the southeast.  Nine samples have 
been collected, with two rock chip samples returning values between 32 and 60g/t Ag and one 
sample from a mine dump returning a value of 0.08g/t Au and 1,820g/t Ag.  Only the dump 
sample indicates that the area merits a follow up visit. 

8.10 Future Exploration Work 
The Orion Project remains virtually unexplored outside of the main showings brought to the 
company's attention by the Nayarit Mining Monograph (COREMI, 1994) and local prospectors.  
The exploration potential to discover other mineralized zones similar to those observed at 
Animas/Del Norte is considered excellent.  Future work should focus on examining and 
documenting known prospects, with concurrent work focused on systematic, district-wide 
exploration.  Target areas which have already been identified should be advanced by soil sample 
grids, geologic mapping and alteration mapping using a PIMA spectrometer.  Specific programs 
which should be immediately implemented are outlined following this section. 

8.10.1 Prospect Evaluation 
Nayarit Gold will continue the program of examining known prospects and developing a 
catalogue and ranking system in order to prioritize work efforts.  Mapping, sampling and 
completion a brief geological report by staff geologists may identify prospects that can be fast-
tracked to drillhole targeting. 

8.10.2 Regional Stream-Sediment Geochemistry 
A regional stream sediment sampling program is being planned for 2010.  Before fieldwork is 
started, drainage basins will be traced out on the project topographic maps and/or satellite 
images.  Sampling sites will then be selected based on these basin maps.  Samples will either be 
pan concentrated in the field or large volumes (two 5gal buckets full) of sediment will be 
transported to the core processing facility for pan concentration.  Pan concentration has been 
shown to be effective by the orientation survey completed in late 2008. 

8.10.3 Soil Sampling at Specific Targets 
Soil sample grids on lines spaced 80m apart with samples every 25m along the lines should be 
collected over the El Carmen target to the northwest of the existing El Carmen – Bonanza soil 
grid.  Similar programs should be carried out over the Lazaro Cardenas target and the La Paloma 
target.  Results should be evaluated for multiple sample anomalies that demonstrate anomalous

8.10.4 Geologic Mapping 
Geologic mapping combined with surface geochemistry is the most cost effective way to 
evaluate whether a target merits drill testing.  Programs of detailed mapping (1:2,000 scale) at 
the El Carmen-Bonanza intersection should determine if the existing drilling was mis-oriented 
(possibly drilled in the footwall of the veins) and where dilatant sections of vein indicated by 
flexures in the vein or structural intersections are located.  Mapping from the Bonanza mine to 
the east across the Reese claim should focus on the eastern extension of the Escondida – 
Bonanza structure.  Mapping should be extended to the east and southeast from the limits of 
existing mapping at San Judas where current map coverage ends within 500m of the Las Animas 
hill.  Other targets that should be mapped at 1:2000 include Rosa Amarilla (Benita prospect), La 
Paloma, and Camillas.  The specific goal of mapping at Camillas is to determine whether the 
veins identified by reconnaissance mapping can be extended into areas with known favorable 
andesite host rocks. 

8.10.5 Alteration Mapping and PIMA 
Alteration mapping supported by PIMA or other short wave infrared spectrometer work should 
be carried out over the La Estrella target.  This program will confirm whether the acid-sulfate 
alteration observed at the La Estrella target is high in the system above potential mineralized 
zones as hypothesized by current management, or whether the acid sulfate alteration is related to 
a high sulfidation epithermal event, as has been suggested by some workers. 

8.11 Interpretation 
The Animas/Del Norte has been extensively explored using a variety of surface and drillhole 
sampling techniques, underground development and limited production has been generally 
confirmatory.  Based on a review of the information provided to SRK by Nayarit, and 
information available in the public domain, SRK is of the opinion that both the current and 
historic regional, property specific exploration of the Animas/Del Norte, and adjacent properties 
was conducted in a professional manner, and that interpretations derived from these studies are 
accurate for use as a basis for resource estimation.

9 Drilling (Item 13) 
9.1 Type and Extent of Drilling 
Two hundred fifty-four diamond core holes, ten reverse circulation holes and eight holes started 
with reverse circulation and finished with core have been drilled by Nayarit Gold on the Orion 
Project.  A total of 61,839.6.m of drilling have been completed to date.  Nayarit Gold's database 
includes information regarding hole diameter, indicating which portions of each hole were 
drilled by reverse circulation, HQ diameter core or NQ diameter core.  Of the total meters 
completed to date, 55,782m were used for the resource estimate and 8,005m were drilled on 
targets outside of the resource area. 

All drilling conducted since 2007 was carried out by HD Drilling, S. de R.L., based out of 
Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico.  All diamond core drilling was completed using two Zynex A5 drills 
and one older Longyear 38.  Drilling was carried out in two shifts per day and average drill 
production was 52m per 12-hour shift.  Reverse circulation drilling was done with a large buggy-
mounted Schramm 650 with a 950 psi/350 cfm air compressor and an auxiliary booster 
compressor. 

Drill roads and drill pad construction was completed with two D-7 Caterpillar tractors operated 
by Construcciones Cihuacoatl, S.A. de C.V. of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.  The cats generally 
worked 8 hours per day, but one cat was on call 24 hours per day as needed by the drill crews. 

9.1.1 Procedures 
All drill collar sites were targeted by Nayarit Gold.  Sites were located in the field using 
handheld GPS units and drill pads constructed using a D-7 Caterpillar tractor.  Drill alignment 
was established on the drill pads using a handheld Brunton compass before the rig was moved 
onto the pad, and alignment and inclination checked by the rig geologist before drilling 
commenced.  For the diamond core drilling programs, all drill operations were carried out by the 
drill contractor's personnel.  Nayarit Mexico rig geologists visited the drill a minimum of two 
times per day and were required to be present at the rig when difficult drilling or bad ground 
conditions were encountered.  Core was retrieved from the drill string using conventional 
wireline techniques.  Core was removed from the core tube by HD drilling personnel, and 
carefully placed in plastic core boxes.  Filled core boxes were removed from the drill site twice 
daily (early morning and evening) by Nayarit Mexico personnel and transported the secure core 
logging facility in Acaponeta, Nayarit, 40km from the Project site.  For the reverse circulation 
drilling programs, the Company rig geologist was present at the drill during all drilling 
operations.  All drillhole collar locations have been surveyed using differential GPS, and have 
down hole surveys to measure hole deviation at approximately 50m intervals taken with a Reflex 
EZ Shot digital survey tool.  All project coordinates are maintained in WGS 84 UTM zone 13R. 

At the core logging facility, the core is cleaned and the broken core pieces reassembled to a best 
fit.  For logging and sample interval marking, the core is laid out on workbenches.  A technician, 
under supervision of the drill geologist, completes a hardcopy geotechnical log of the core 
including recovery and RQD.  The drill geologist then logs the core and creates a hardcopy 
geologic log including a graphical representation of rock type, vein orientation, and mineralized 
zones and a detailed descriptive log including rock type, alteration, structure, mineralization and 
vein density/percentage.  All core is digitally photographed, and an example of the resultant 
photographs is provided in Figure 9-1.

9.2 Results 
Drill core was split into intervals ranging from 0.1 to 14.35m, with an average interval length of 
0.95m after logging by the site geologists.  Split core was transported to Laboratory Group 
(ALS) located in Hermosillo, Sonora Mexico for sample preparation and then the pulps were 
sent to Vancouver, British Columbia for analysis.  Geology (lithology, structure, alteration, 
RQD) logs have been reviewed for several drillholes.  

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling and survey methods employed during the Nayarit drill 
programs are well documented, and that the procedures used meet or exceed industry standards.  
SRK recommends that additional geotechnical information be collected for all future core-
drilling programs.

10 Sampling Method and Approach (Item 14) 
10.1 Sample Methods 
Core is transported from the drill site to Nayarit Mexico's secure core logging facility in 
Acaponeta by company personnel.  Core box numbers are checked and core is cleaned and re-
assembled by technicians prior to measurement of total core recovery.  Technicians measure total 
core recovery, RQD, fracture characteristics and rock strength as estimated using the method 
from as 1726 geotechnical site investigation code 1993.  After re-assembly and geotechnical 
logging geologists complete a geological log of the core and mark the sample intervals directly 
on the core.  Geologists are instructed to collect sample lengths with a minimum length of 0.5m 
and a maximum length of 1.5m sample with a nominal 1m interval adjusting based on rock type 
changes so that wall rock is not mixed with vein material, except in cases of small, isolated 
veins.  Sample intervals are adjusted to vein and breccia zone boundaries and rock type changes.  
Sample intervals are marked on the core and adjacent to the core in the box.  A cut line is drawn 
along the length of the core by the geologists.  All sampled core is sawn in half and returned to 
the box.  After sawing core samples were collected by technicians always taking the left hand 
side of the core and leaving the right hand side in the box.  Samples have an approximate 4kg 
weight.  Samples were shipped to Laboratory Group (ALS) located in Hermosillo, Sonora, 
Mexico for sample preparation and then the pulps were sent to Vancouver, British Columbia 
using a commercial freight service contracted by ALS Chemex.  All core handling from retrieval 
from the core tube through washing, re-assembly, geotechnical and geologic logging and 
sampling is done under the supervision of Nayarit Mexico geologists.  Nayarit Mexico has 
implemented a QA-QC procedure as described in Section 11.2. 

10.2 Factors Impacting Accuracy of Results 
The sample intervals were selected in a careful manner, in order not to mix mineralized vein 
intervals with adjacent wall rock intervals.  Although the distribution of gold and silver in 
epithermal vein systems is typically erratic, the consistent systematic selection of the same of the 
core split minimizes selection bias, and SRK is of the opinion that the sampling and resultant 
analytical results are accurate and suitable for use in resource estimation. 

10.3 Sample Quality 
Given the nature of mineralization, SRK is of the opinion that the sampling protocols employed 
by Nayarit during past drilling campaigns are to industry standard and appropriate for the deposit 
type. 

10.4 Sample Parameters 
Samples were typically collected along ~1m intervals, with assayed sample lengths in the 
database ranging from 0.1 to 14.35m, with an average sample interval of 0.95m.  SRK considers 
that the sampling parameters are appropriate, given the nature of mineralization and the mining 
method under consideration. 

10.5 Relevant Samples 
With the exception of some or the pre-Nayarit drillholes, which intersected the vein systems at 
inappropriate angles (drilled south to north rather than north to south), SRK is of the opinion that

the drillholes adequately intersect the veins in a near true thickness orientation, and are suitable 
for use in resource estimation.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
(Item 15) 

Samples are shipped from Nayarit Gold's core processing facility in Acaponeta, Nayarit to ALS 
Laboratory Group (ALS) located in Hermosillo, Sonora Mexico.  Sample shipment from the 
Project to this facility is part of the service provided by ALS and is contracted by ALS to a third 
party shipping company.  At ALS Hermosillo, samples are entered into the Laboratory 
Information Management System (LIMS) and prepared for analysis.  Once sample preparation is 
completed, the sample pulps are shipped on to ALS Vancouver for analysis by Fire Assay and 
inductively coupled atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). 

ALS Hermosillo and ALS Vancouver are in compliance for the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 
through February 12, 2011 (ALS Laboratory Group, 2009).  ALS Vancouver is accredited 
through the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for Metallic Ores and Products Mineral 
Analysis testing for several techniques including Fire Assay with an Atomic Absorption (AA) 
finish, Fire Assay with a gravimetric finish and ICP-AES using a four acid digestion.  This is 
under CAN-P-1579 Guidelines for the Accreditation of Mineral Analysis Testing Laboratories 
and CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025) General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and 
Calibration Laboratories.  This accreditation is valid through May 18, 2013 (Standards Council 
of Canada, 2009). 

Samples are in the custody and control of Nayarit Gold, the shipping contractor or ALS at all 
times. 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods 
On arrival at ALS Hermosillo, samples are inventoried, weighed, assigned a barcode and entered 
into the LIMS.  Once these activities are completed the samples are prepared for as follows: 

• Samples are dried in a drying oven 

• The entire sample is crushed to 90% passing -2mm; 

• A 1,000g split is pulverized to 85% -75 microns; and  

• This pulp is sent to ALS Vancouver for analysis. 
In Vancouver, the sample is analyzed for Au using Fire Assay (FA) with a 50g charge and an 
AA finish.  Detection limits for this analysis are from 0.005 to 10g/t Au.  Over limits where Au 
exceeds 10.0g/t are re-analyzed using a 50g charge FA with a gravimetric finish.  This technique 
has detection limits of 0.05 to 1000 g/t Au.  Silver is determined as part of the multi-element 
package discussed below.  Silver over limits, which are analyses greater than 100g/t Ag, are re-
analyzed by ICP-AES using a four acid digestion.  Samples that exceed 1,500g/t Ag are re-
analyzed by FA using a one assay ton charge with a gravimetric finish.  Over limits for Cu are 
those analyses that exceed 10%.  These are re-analyzed by a four acid digestion with an ICP 
finish.  Detection limits for this method are 0.01 to 40%.  

Prior to 2007, samples were analyzed using a multi-element package designated ME-ICP41m by 
ALS Chemex.  This is a suite of 34 elements including Ag and Hg.  The sample is prepared by 
dissolving a 5g aliquot of the pulp using aqua regia and analyzing it using ICP-AES.  The 
elements and their detection limits for this multi-element package are listed in Table 11.1.1.  
Ranges are listed in parts per million (ppm) unless otherwise noted.

Since 2007, samples were analyzed using a multi-element package designated ME-ICP61 by 
ALS Chemex.  This is a suite of 33 elements including Ag.  The sample is prepared by 
dissolving a 5g aliquot of the pulp using a four acid "near-total" digestion and analyzing it using 
ICP-AES.  The elements and their detection limits for this multi-element package are listed in 
Table 11.1.2.  Ranges are listed in parts per million (ppm) unless otherwise noted.

ALS Chemex returns all pulps and coarse rejects to Nayarit Gold.  Pulps and rejects are stored in 
the company warehouse in Acaponeta, Nayarit.  It is Nayarit Gold's intention to discard all 
coarse rejects collected through the end of 2008 upon completion of preliminary metallurgical 
studies and publication of this technical report. 

11.2 Quality Controls and Quality Assurance 
Prior to May 2008, Nayarit Gold's Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) sample program 
consisted of blank and field duplicate samples.  After this date, Nayarit Gold implemented a 
program that included blank, duplicate and standard samples. 

Approximately 10% of all samples submitted to ALS Chemex are for QA/QC purposes.  These 
samples are inserted into the sample stream at the following frequencies: 

• Blanks = three per 100 samples; 

• Field Duplicates = three per 100 samples; and 



Nayarit Gold Inc.  11-3

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 5, 2010 
Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

• Standards (after May 2008) = four per 100 samples. 
Blanks are inserted randomly within the 100-sample interval, but are specifically placed in 
mineralized zones.  Field duplicates are inserted at 30 sample intervals within the 100 samples.  
One standard is inserted every 25 samples rotating through each one of the four standards in use 
by Nayarit.   

11.2.1 Standards 
Nayarit Gold has used seven different certified standards since 2008, but are currently using four 
standards in its QA/QC program.  These include three from CDN Resource Laboratories, Ltd. 
(CDN Resource) located in Langely, British Columbia, Canada and four from ROCKLABS 
located in Auckland, New Zealand. 

Because of the method used to certify standards purchased from CDN Resources, the 
recommended value and "Between Lab" two standard deviation (2σ) can be used directly as a 
performance range to monitor accuracy from individual analysis.  Table 11.2.1 lists the CDN 
Resources standards with recommended values and 2σ.

ROCKLABS standards have a recommended value and a 95% confidence level.  This requires 
the user to monitor the analytical results and calculate an average performance and standard 
deviation based on the laboratory specific data.  Table 11.2.1.2 lists the ROCKLABS standards

ROCKLABS standard SP27 or and CDN Resources standards CDN-SE-2 and CDN-HZ-2 were 
used during 2008.  Use of standard CDN-HZ-2 was discontinued by Nayarit Gold after two 
analyses and has not been graphed.  Nayarit Gold is currently using CDN Resources standard 
CDN-HC-2 and ROCKLABS standards OxC58, OxF65 and OxN49.  Standards OxC58, OxF65 
and OxN49 are gold standards while the other seven are gold and silver standards. 

Standards Used by Nayarit Gold During 2008  
For ROCKLABS standard SP27, there was one under limit failure for Au and two over limit 
failures for Ag.  In general, this standard performed slightly higher than the average value for Au 
but well within the limits for analysis.  The Ag analyses for SP27 had greater variability and two 
over limit failures in the first 14 analyses.  Later analyses were predominantly lower than the 
average value for Ag.  Graphs for ROCKLABS standard SP27 are shown in Figure 11-1. 

CDN Resources standard CDN-SE-2 had three over limit and 11 under limit failures for Au and 
20 over limit and four under limit failures for Ag.  The standard performed within limits for Au 
during most of 2008, becoming more variable just before Nayarit Gold discontinued using CDN-
SE-2.  The Ag analyses was more variable than Au and initially performed lower that the 
recommended value, then higher than the recommended prior to Nayarit Gold discontinuing use 
of CDN-SE-2.  Graphs for CDN Resources standard CDN-SE-2 are shown in Figure 11-2. 

The CDN Resources standard CDN-HZ-2 recommended Au value was noted as provisional.  
Nayarit Gold used this standard twice and both times the Au value was high and outside the 
performance limits.  The Ag results were within the performance limits for both the analyses. 

Standards in Use by Nayarit Gold (2008-2009) 
The CDN Resources standard CDN-HC-2 had 34 over limit and 42 under limit failures for Au 
out of 358 analyses.  This represents a combined 21% failure rate for Au analyses.  Overall, the 
standard performed lower than the recommended value.  The average analysis of the sample 
population was slightly lower at 1.66 g/t Au than the recommended value of 1.67g/t Au for 
CDN-HC-2.  This standard had 40 over limit failures representing a 14% failure rate for Ag 
analysis.  Analyses for Silver were higher than the recommended value overall.  Figure 11-3 
shows the graphs for CDN Resources standard CDN-HC-2 for Au and Ag. 

The ROCKLABS standard OxC58 averaged 0.201g/t Au and has a 2σ of ±0.017g/t Au for the 
sample population.  ROCKLABS standard OxC58 had two over limit and two under limit 
failures in 41 analyses or a failure rate of approximately 9.7%.  This is shown in Figure 11-4.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 5, 2010 
Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

ROCKLABS standard OxF65 averaged 0.787g/t Au and has a 2σ of ±0.07g/t Au for the sample 
populations.  There was one over limit and two under limit failures in 38 samples.  This is a 
failure rate of approximately 7.9%.  This is shown in Figure 11-4. 

ROCKLABS standard OxN49 averaged 7.384g/t Au and has a 2σ of ±0.58g/t Au for the sample 
population of 58 analyses.  OxN49 had two under limit failures or an approximate 3.4% failure 
rate.  This is shown in Figure 11-5. 

11.2.2 Field Duplicates 
Field duplicates inserted into the sample stream by Nayarit is the remaining half of the core.  The 
frequency is three duplicates every 100 sample.  Because of this, no core is retained for 3% of 
the core drilled.  However, photographs and logs serve as a record for these intervals.  A wooden 
block is placed in the core box to hold the place of the core taken for the duplicate sample.  
These duplicates serve as a check on the variability of the sample media and aid in determining 
the minimum acceptable sample size.   

There were 15 failures for Au above 1g/t and 40 failures for Au analysis in excess of 0.185g/t 
Au, which is the lower limit of standard OxC58.  If 0.185g/t Au is used for a failure limit then 
this represents a 5% failure rate.  There were 54 failures for Ag analysis in excess of 2.5g/t Ag 
out of 797 samples.  This limit is based on 5x the detection limit.  This represents a 7% failure 
rate for Ag in the field duplicate population.  These may represent a nugget effect in these 
samples.  Re-analysis of the sample pair failures would assist in identifying why the failure 
occurred.  Plots of the duplicate pairs indicate that in general duplicates are performing slightly 
lower than the original sample.  Figures 11-6 and 11-7 show scatterplots of the field duplicates 
pairs for Au and Ag respectively and Figures 11-8 and 11-9 show relative percent difference for 
Au and Ag respectively. 

11.2.3 Blanks 
Three coarse blanks are submitted per every 100 samples.  The blank material is collected 
locally, coarsely crushed to -2.5cm and inserted into the sample stream at regular intervals.  A 
series of 15 samples of this blank material were submitted to ALS Chemex to test suitability of 
this material as a standard.  Analyses of the 15 samples returned less than detection limit results 
for both Au and Ag indicating that this is an appropriate material for use as a blank. 

Blank failures are those blank analyses that exceed 5x the lower detection limit for the element 
of interest.  For Au all analyses above 0.025g/t are considered failures.  The analysis for Ag has 
changed during Nayarit Gold's work at the Project from ME-ICP41m to ME-ICP61.  These have 
different lower detection limits for Ag.  The lower detection limit for Ag analysis using ME-
ICP41m is 0.2g/t and for ME-ICP61 0.5g/t making the failure limit 1.0g/t and 2.5g/t respectively. 

There were 13 blank failures in 1,073 analyses for Au or a failure rate of approximately 1%.  For 
Ag analysis, blank failures were between 2% and 4% depending on whether 1.0g/t or 2.5g/t was 
used as failure limit.  If the higher limit is used there were 19 failures and if the lower limit is 
then there were 47 failures.  Of the 19 failures that exceeded 2.5g/t, 17 exceeded 3g/t with four 
exceeded 10g/t.  Nine of the Ag failures were coincident with Au failures.  This indicates either 
an issue with the blank QA/QC material or sample preparation problems.  The sample 
preparation problem could originate either when the blank is prepared for insertion or at ALS 
Chemex's preparation laboratory.  Both sources of contamination should be investigated.

11.2.4 Pulp Duplicates 
Two batches of pulps from samples have been check assayed by SGS Minerals (SGS) in 
Lakefield Ontario, Canada using similar techniques to those used by ALS Chemex for the main 
population of samples.  The first set of pulp duplicates was submitted in February 2009 and 
represented 5% of the mineralized samples in the drill database at that time.  It was noted that 
this did not adequately check for potential problems with low-grade samples. 

Under the direction of SRK, a second set of 309 pulp duplicates was submitted in July 2009 and 
included samples representative of mineralized and non-mineralized material.  The results of this 
second submission is discussed in Section 12.2. 

11.3 Interpretation 
There were a number of failures for analyses of standard CDN-HC-2.  Failure rates for Au 
analyses was 21% and for Ag was 14%.  This may indicate a problem with the analytical 
technique or with the standard itself.  The analytical procedures selected by Nayarit Gold are 
appropriate for this standard and there appears to be adequate testing for certification.  Overall, 
the standard performed low for Au and high for Ag.  Nayarit Gold should monitor this standard 
re-analyzing failures as they occur and should this standard continue to perform poorly, 
discontinue use of this standard. 

The ROCKLABS Au standards performed slightly better with a 9.7% failure rate for OxC58, a 
7.9% failure for OxF65 and a 3.4% failure for OxN49.  All standard failures should be 
investigated through re-analysis to determine the reason for the failure.  Re-analysis should 
include several samples above and below the failed standard at a minimum and may need to 
include the entire batch of samples where the failure occurred. 

Field duplicates had a 5% failure rate for Au and a 7% failure rate for Ag.  This may represent a 
nugget effect in these samples.  Re-analysis of the sample pair failures would assist in identifying 
why the failure occurred.  Duplicate failures must be re-analyzed to determine why the failure 
occurred. 

There were 13 blank failures in 1,073 analyses for Au or a failure rate of approximately 1%.  For 
Ag analysis, blank failures were between 2% and 4% depending on whether 1.0g/t or 2.5g/t was 
used as failure limit.  If the higher limit is used, there were 19 failures and if the lower limit is 
then there were 47 failures.  Of the 19 failures that exceeded 2.5g/t, 17 exceeded 3g/t with four 
exceeded 10g/t.  Nine of the Ag failures were coincident with Au failures.  This indicates either 
an issue with the blank QA/QC material, sample preparation problems or sample mix-ups.  A 
sample preparation problem could originate either when the blank is prepared by Nayarit Gold 
for insertion or at ALS Chemex's preparation laboratory.  Sample mix-ups are suspected for the 
samples over 10g/t Ag.  Blank failures should be investigated by re-analysis of the entire batch 
of samples where the failure occurred. 

SRK is of the opinion that the number of QA/QC samples inserted into the sample stream as 
outlined above are appropriate for the type of deposit and analytical technique used.  However, 
SRK recommends the inclusion of pulp duplicates as part of the standard QA/QC program.  SRK 
also recommends continuous monitoring of all QA/QC samples during analytical programs.  
Failures in QA/QC samples must be re-analyzed immediately upon discovery to determine why 
the failure occurred.  Failures in QA/QC can be the result of sample mix-ups, sample collection

and preparation issues or analytical problems.  SRK also recommends the development and 
certification of site-specific standards for gold and silver for use in QA/QC programs.

12 Data Verification (Item 16) 
SRK independently verified the digital assay database provided by Nayarit by comparing a 
random 10% of the database against the original analytical certificates provided directly from 
ALS Chemex.  The 10% random assay comparisons were conducted using the identical sample 
intervals for gold and silver, randomly selected by silver grade ranges.  SRK notes that all Ag 
and Au results reported as below detection were recorded in the provided database at half 
detection limit, which is a customary procedure.  SRK is of the opinion this to be a conservative 
and defendable approach.  No errors were identified in the 2,500 samples checked for Ag or Au. 

12.1 Behre Dolbear – Check Sample and Assay Program 
Behre-Dolbear conducted an extensive check sample and re-assay program in 2007.  SRK has 
reviewed the results of this program, and is of the opinion that the QA/QC protocols 
implemented by Nayarit prior to 2007 are adequate, and that the results of ALS Chemex are 
reliable. 

12.2 SRK 2009 Check Sample and Assay Program 
Under the direction of SRK, Nayarit Gold submitted a set of 309 pulp duplicates in July 2009 
and included samples representative of mineralized and non-mineralized material.  These 
samples were submitted to SGS.  Duplicate failures are those analyses that do not plot within 
±10% of x=y slope on a scatterplot.  There were 84 samples that exceeded ±10%.  However, 
only two of these exceeded 0.185g/t Au.  This represents a failure rate of 0.6%.  Silver analysis 
had 13 samples that exceeded 2.5g/t Ag representing a 4% failure rate.  The sample failures 
should be re-analyzed to determine why the failure occurred, but overall the analysis shows good 
sample correlation for pulps.  Scatterplots for Au and Ag are shown in Figures 12-1 and 12-2 
respectively. 

12.3 Quality Control Measures and Procedures 
The quality control measure and procedures, as described in Section 11, meet or exceed industry-
accepted practices for the insertion of field pulps, standards and duplicates.  SRK recommends 
the inclusion of pulp duplicates as part of the standard QA/QC program for the Project. 

12.4 Limitations 
The database prepared by Nayarit Gold relies on the implementation of industry best practices 
implemented by the company and its predecessors during the various drilling campaigns, as well 
as from professional assayers.  SRK has independently verified a portion of the digital database, 
and has handled the data with utmost regard to accurate transfer and preservation of source 
information, but does not assume responsibility for the quality of the source data.

13 Adjacent Properties (Item 17) 
The following section is partially excerpted from the 2007 Behre Dolbear Report.  Changes to 
standardizations have been made to suit the format of this report.  Edits to text are annotated 
by the use of square brackets or reference to SRK. 
SRK has not conducted a detailed review of public information concerning adjacent properties, 
the authors of which are not known to have any relationship to SRK nor Nayarit Gold.  The 
information has not been verified by SRK; and the technical information is not necessarily 
indicative of the mineralization at the Orión Gold Project properties that are the subject of this 
technical report.  Figure 13-1 shows the location of the properties described below. 

13.1 Bonanza Area 
One of the mine areas close to La Estrella, approximately 4.7km east, is the Bonanza vein, an 
east-west bearing epithermal structure characterized by strong silicification, quartz brecciation 
and stockwork that has a known strike length of more than 2.6km showing widths in the order of 
3.0m and as much as 25.0m locally. 

The Bonanza vein is reported to outcrop for almost 2.6km of which 400m fall into the Bonanza 
claim, concessioned to Minera Nayaloa and/or Augusto Vallejo (reportedly under dispute) and 
2,200m into the neighboring Bonanza I claim, concessioned to Nayarit Gold. 

Historical Mineral Resources as reported by Peñoles in 1987 were on the order of 182,600t at 
3.06g/t Au and 308g/t Ag (SIPSA, 1987).  It is of interest to note that DH B-3 intersection of 
10.92g/t Au is associated with oxide mineralization within a porphyritic intrusive and that 
mineralization is different to La Estrella, showing high-grade silver values.  Reportedly, after 
Peñoles exploration, Minera Nayaloa carried out a small operation mining out 15,000t of ore. 

13.2 Motaje Area 
The Motaje District is characterized by a series of east-west trending, 0.4 to 3.0m wide veins, 
located approximately 1.5 to 3.0km southeast of La Estrella.  The Consejo de Recursos 
Minerales (Coremi) reports limited sampling with gold-silver values and no information is 
available for Industrial Minera México (IMMSA)'s exploration results. 

Local information gathered in the Motaje town indicates that Minera Caopas entered and 
explored the area in 1986–1987, drilling 21 drillholes and carrying out cross-cutting, some 
development drifting and minor stoping at La Sebastiana mine. 

13.3 Las Lumbres Area 
Minerales Vane, S.A. de C.V. is carrying out, at a small scale of 1,500t/m (in 2007), the 
exploitation of the Diablito high-grade mine in the neighboring Las Lumbres Mining District, 
located 16km southwest of La Estrella.  The diluted milling grade is in the order of 5g/t Au, 
700g/t Ag, and is reportedly producing at a cash cost of US$125 per tonne.  Vane Minerals 
reported JORC compliant Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 110,077t at an average 
grade of 7.20g/t Au and 747g/t Ag and Inferred Resources of 31,200t at an average grade of 
2.10g/t Au and 461.7g/t Ag.  Vane had plans to build a crushing plant and floatation mill close to 
the mine site with a 100t/d capacity.

14 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
(Item 18) 

The Animas/Del Norte deposit is a gold and silver property with the recoverable metal values 
split between the gold and silver.  Preliminary mineralogical investigations and indicative 
metallurgical testwork have been undertaken and have indicated that the material is relatively 
easy to process and that high precious metal recoveries can be achieved.  Further investigations 
are required to be able to optimize the recovery flowsheet. 

Although there are significant levels of sulfide minerals, the main sulfide mineral is pyrite with 
very low levels of other base metal sulfides, which could possibly be recovered into a saleable 
concentrate.  Preliminary indicative metallurgical testwork has indicated that, despite the sulfide 
levels the Animas/Del Norte material is not particularly refractive in relation to the recovery of 
the precious metals, and the material is amenable to treatment by direct cyanidation.  Recoveries 
of around 90% have been achieved by cyanidation of milled ores, although cyanide 
consumptions are indicated to be moderate.  Flotation has also been indicated to be reasonably 
effective although does not appear to result in increased precious metal recovery, or reduction in 
reagent usage and operating costs.  In addition, the flotation tails contain levels of potentially 
recoverable precious metals. 

Initial metallurgical tests were undertaken mainly on milled ore, although further tests on 
crushed ore have been undertaken using column leaching with a view to evaluating the 
application of heap leaching to the Animas/Del Norte material.  Rolling bottle tests have been 
reasonably successful achieving recoveries of around 60 to 65% at crush sizes down to < 5mm. 

14.1 Ore Characteristics, Mineralogy and Anticipated Plant Feed 
14.1.1 General 
The Animas/Del Norte material is indicated to contain levels of sulfide minerals up to >10%, 
mainly as pyrite.  Silver is understood to occur mainly as the sulfide mineral argentite.  The 
occurrence, association and grain size of the gold has not been investigated with only limited 
information available on the silver deportment. 

14.1.2 Mineralogical and Chemical Characteristics 
Mineralogical investigations have been undertaken by SGS Lakefield in Canada and have mainly 
been focused on an assessment of the main gangue and precious metals and the deportment of 
the sulfide minerals within the ore, which is understood to be mainly pyrite.  Four mineralized 
drill core intersections were selected for mineralogical investigation.  These samples were 
subject to QEMSCAN evaluation and analysis.  The main minerals were indicated to be quartz, 
mica, feldspar, chlorite and carbonate along with pyrite.  The determination of the main minerals 
is presented in Table 14.1.2.1.

In general, the information generated in the QEMSCAN investigation is relatively limited and 
while liberation data is available on the pyrite related to the other main minerals, limited 
information is available on the grain size, deportments and associations of gold and silver. 

Chemical analyses have indicated relatively low levels of other base metals sulfides with the 
exception of pyrite; copper (<0.05% Cu), lead (generally <0.1% Pb) and zinc (generally < 0.01% 
Zn - one sample 0.43%).  Level of potentially problematic elements such as arsenic, antimony 
and mercury are indicated to be very low. 

No diagnostic investigations have been undertaken and hence limited information is available on 
the quantities of precious metals liberated, associated and locked in the different sulfide minerals 
and locked in gangue minerals for different grade samples. 

Although the mineralogical investigations identify that copper occurs as the primary sulfide, 
chalcopyrite, there is limited evidence of the presence of secondary copper minerals which could 
be expected to result in elevated cyanide consumption figures in leaching.  In the metallurgical 
testwork, in the few tests where copper has been monitored in the leachate, elevated dissolved 
copper levels are indicated, which are shown to be significantly higher than silver levels in 
solution. 

Further mineralogical investigations are recommended with regard to the grain size, association 
and deportment of the gold and silver.  Also some diagnostic analysis is recommended to 
determine the precious metals associated with sulfides etc for different gold and silver grades in 
the feed samples, as well the speciation of the copper minerals. 

14.2 Metallurgical Testwork 
Metallurgical testwork on the Animas/Del Norte material has been undertaken for Nayarit by 
SGS at their facilities at Durango, Mexico.  Testwork has focused on investigating and 
developing conceptual flowsheets and the initial SGS investigations were almost exclusively 
undertaken on the treatment of milled ore.  Metallurgical testwork investigations included direct 
cyanide leach, gravity concentration using a Knelson concentrator, and flotation including 
leaching tests on the gravity tails and on flotation concentrates and tailings.  Other testwork 
included investigations into the preliminary determination of milling parameters. 

Further investigations including the potential treatment of crushed ore at coarser sizes to 
investigate the amenability of the Animas/Del Norte material to heap leaching have subsequently 
been initiated and preliminary tests are being undertaken at the laboratory of Minera Santa Rita, 
at the El Chanate Mine (Capital Gold Corporation) near Caborca, Mexico.  These latter tests 
were targeted at low-grade samples, which are possibly below the cut-off grade for treatment 
incorporating milling, and for which heap leach could be applicable, although heap leaching 
could also be suitable to the higher grade feed from underground mining.  Further bottle roll tests 
have therefore been undertaken by SGS on crushed and fine crushed material on material more 
similar to the typical mined ore. 

14.2.1 Samples Tested 
The same drill core reject samples, as used for the mineralogical investigations, were selected for 
investigations into cyanide leaching.  Analyses of the more significant metals and elements of 
these samples are presented in Table 14.2.1.1.

Although the location of the samples evaluated for mineralogy and metallurgical response are 
known spatially, it is not known how representative these samples are of the overall orebody.  It 
is noted that the metal grades vary significantly for the different samples tested.  In the next 
phase of the investigation, ore variability from across the orebody and at depth needs to be 
further assessed. 

14.3 Results of Metallurgical Testwork 
14.3.1 Cyanide Leach 
Leach tests were conducted in rolling bottles and investigated the effect of: 

• Grind size - 60, 70 80 and 90% < 200 mesh (75µm; 

• Cyanide strength - 750, 1,250, 2,000 and 3,000ppm; and 

• Oxidant additions - Litharge (PbO) – 75g/t, PbNO3 – 250g/t. 
Leach tests were undertaken for 96 hours. 

As could be expected, leach recoveries generally improved at the finer grind sizes and higher 
cyanide concentration particularly the silver recoveries.  SGS recommended an optimum grind 
size of 80% < 75 micron and an optimum cyanide strength of 2,000ppm. 

The addition of oxidant, particularly litharge, improved leach recoveries although generally not 
significantly.  Leach kinetics were not increased with the addition of oxidants compared to the 
reference test at 2,000ppm cyanide with oxidants. 

The leach test results are summarized in Figures 14-1 to 14-7.

Figure 14-7 presents gold and silver recoveries again measured cyanide consumption for the 
different samples based on the results of the tests at different cyanide strength.  Cyanide 
consumptions for the tests investigating different grind sizes were significantly higher for similar 
recoveries. 

With the exception of the very high grade sample 674954 (42.6g/t Au / 4770g/t Ag), acceptable 
leach recoveries were achieved at cyanide consumptions of 3 to 5 kg/t, while the required lime 
addition was 5kg/t. 

The kinetics for gold leaching are noted to be relatively fast with the majority of the recoverable 
gold achieved within 24h.  However, the kinetics for silver are significantly slower with 72 to 96 
hours required to achieve close to optimum recovery. 

Typical leach curves for gold and silver are presented in Figures 14-8 to 14-11. 

Leach kinetics for the higher-grade samples were noted to be generally slower than for the other 
samples; see Figures 14-10 and 14-11. 

Further investigations are recommended into the use of alternative oxidants during leach 
including oxygen and peroxide in a possible attempt to increase leach kinetics. 

14.3.2 Gravity Recovery 
Testwork was undertaken on relatively high-grade samples (5 to 16g/t Au and 230 to 1370g/t 
Ag).  A Knelson concentrator was used to generate a primary concentrate at a feed grind size of 
80% < 600 micron.  The tests only succeeded in recovering 50 to 55% of the precious metals into 
a concentrate of around 30% of the feed mass.  The upgrade ratios between the gold and silver 
grade in the feed and in the concentrate were generally only around 1.5 to 1.65 for gold and 1.25 
to 1.5 for silver. 

No attempts were made to upgrade the concentrate by further cleaning on a shaking table or 
other gravity device nor to produce a lower mass pull concentrate by increasing the amount of 
material fed to the Knelson. 

Tests were undertaken on leaching the gravity tails at different grind sizes.  While these 
succeeded in recovering 93 to 97% of the gold and 75 to 90% of the silver, they did not result in 
lower reagent consumption when leaching the gravity tails compared to leaching the milled feed. 

The gravity tests are seen to be of rather limited use as the production of a high-grade 
concentrate was not attempted and hence the leaching of a concentrate was not undertaken. 

14.3.3 Flotation 
Flotation was successful in recovering 85 to 90% of the precious metals into a rougher 
concentrate at around 10% mass pull, although it is noted that 75% of gold and 60% of the silver 
in the rougher flotation tails are still recoverable by cyanidation. 

Upgrade of the rougher concentrate by cleaning achieved 80 to 85% overall recovery of the 
precious metals into a concentrate at 3 to 5% mass pull.  Cyanidation of the cleaner concentrate 
resulted in recovery of 95% of the gold and 90% of the silver into solution with the addition of 
oxidants.  Cyanide consumptions of 10 to 20kg/t were required to leach the cleaner concentrates 
and achieve the target recoveries.  Results of the flotation tests are presented in Table 14.3.3.1.

No testwork was undertaken on the possible further treatment of the rougher concentrate. 

14.3.4 Leaching Tests At Coarse Size 
The laboratory of Minera Santa Rita (El Chanate Mine of Capital Gold Corporation) undertook 
bottle roll tests on a lower grade composite sample at crush sizes of 80% passing ½", 3/8" and 
¼" and a pulverized sample as reference.  The results are presented in Table 14.3.4.1.

The results for the leach curves are shown in Figures 14-12 and 14-13 for gold and silver 
recoveries.  Some anomalies are apparent which require further investigation. 

Percolation Column Test 
The laboratory of Minera Santa Rita undertook a single column test on the low-grade composite 
samples.  The test was undertaken in a column 150mm diameter by 2,380mm high on material 
nominally 80% < ¼" (100% < ½" / 95% < 3/8").  4kg/t of lime was added to the column charge 
although the material was not agglomerated using cement prior to irrigation.  An irrigation rate 
of 3.5 l/m2/h was applied. 

Leach curves are presented in Figures 14-14 and 14-15.  Metal recoveries are presented based on 
the head assays for gold and silver, although final results will be calculated from the back-
calculated head grades once the tests are complete and the column strip and sampled.  The 
extraction of copper into solution is shown in Figure 14-15. 

14.3.5 SGS Additional Bottle Roll Tests 
It was proposed that improved leach recoveries could be obtained by employing finer crushing 
and operating a heap leach with (drum) agglomerated fine material.  SGS were therefore 
requested to undertake some preliminary tests on material crushed to - ¼" (6.35mm) and -20 
mesh (2mm).  The tests were undertaken on two different composite samples, OR-09-183 and 
OR-09-184, which had previously also been used for the flotation testwork. 

The results are shown in Table 14.3.6.1.

14.3.6 Other Metallurgical Testwork 
Preliminary tests have been undertaken into milling parameters including determination of Bond 
Work Index (BWI) and basic SAG milling indices, as shown in Tables 14.3.71 and 14.3.7.2 
respectively.

No work has been undertaken on settling or filtration parameters, although it is noted in the 
leaching testwork that the material is generally difficult to settle. 

14.3.7 Discussion of Metallurgical Testwork 
The absence of other recoverable base metals and the non-refractory nature of the material tested 
indicate that the production of a saleable concentrate containing the majority of the precious 
metals is metallurgically possible, but not necessarily the optimum treatment route for the 
Animas/Del Norte ore.  It is also indicated that the flotation tails contain residual levels of 
precious metals recoverable using cyanidation.  Direct cyanidation either after milling in a tank 
leach system or by heap leach would therefore seem to be the most effective process. 

Reagent consumptions in tank leaching are relatively high at 3 to 5kg/t NaCN and 5kg/t CaO, 
and leaching kinetics especially for silver are relatively slow requiring an extended leach time.  
The optimum grind appears to be around 70 – 80% < 200 mesh (75 micron).  The high cyanide 
consumption appears to be related partially to the dissolution of copper, which is shown where it 
has been monitored, to report in the leach solution after cyanidation.

While seen to be reasonably successful, flotation does not result in all the recoverable precious 
metals reporting into the concentrate, and leaching of the flotation tails does not result in 
significantly improved overall recoveries, nor reduce overall reagent consumption or improve 
leach kinetics.  Similarly gravity concentration is seen to be marginally effective, although does 
not increase overall recoveries or reduce the conditions for leaching the gravity tails, compared 
to the whole milled ore. 

Although testwork on crushed ore and heap leaching has not yet been investigated in detail, this 
process route may be viable.  However, precious metal recoveries are only indicated to be 
moderate (around 50 to 65% for gold and silver) particularly considering the high head grade 
from underground mining, although it is indicated that significantly lower cyanide consumptions 
are required to achieve these recoveries compared to milling and tank leaching. 

The high silver:gold ratio indicates that the optimum route for precious metal recovery after 
leaching is likely to be precipitation from solution, following solid liquid separation in the case 
of milling and tank leaching. 

14.3.8 Further Investigations Recommended 
The work undertaken to date has been relatively preliminary and further investigations are 
recommended to optimize the treatment plant design and operating parameters, specifically the 
use of alternative oxidants or additives to possibly improve leach kinetics, particularly for silver. 

Preliminary testwork undertaken into heap leach recovery at coarse crushed ore has been 
undertaken mainly in basic bottle roll tests with only one low grade samples tested in a 
percolation column test.  Recoveries around 65% have been indicated.  However the possible 
treatment of Animas/Del Norte material at finer crush sizes (with agglomeration) to possibly 
improve recoveries without the incurred expense of milling and tank leaching has been proposed.  
This could be investigated further.  If successful, the testing of larger samples in small scale 
percolated columns is proposed to investigate design and operating parameters. 

As the potential milling flowsheet is likely to require solid liquid separation to produce a clear 
solution from which the silver and gold can be precipitated, settling and filtration tests are 
required in the next phase of the investigations. 

Further investigations are recommended into gravity recovery of a high-grade concentrate, which 
can be intensively treated in an attempt to improve overall precious metal recoveries. 

Limited investigations have been undertaken into ore variability and into continuous closed 
circuit test to investigate the buildup of metals or other products in recycled solids and solution 
streams. 

Further tests should also investigate the deportment and potential build up of copper in the 
solution circuit and the effect on reagent consumptions and precious metal recoveries.  The 
recovery of cyanide associated with copper for possible reuse in the circuit could also be 
investigated. 

14.3.9 Processing Method Selection 
Various alternative potential mining plans and treatment options were considered, and indicative 
capital and operating costs were investigated along with forecast metal recoveries for these 
options.  These considered different ore feeds from the different mining methods (open pit and 
underground mining) and different treatment rates.

The findings are summarized in Section 17.1.1.  In summary, various processing alternatives 
indicated merit, although the milling and cyanidation method (tank leaching) resulted in the 
highest precious metal recoveries. 

The selected processing method for this PEA consisted of crushing, grinding (single stage SAG 
mill operating in closed circuit), thickening, and (cyanide) leaching with large mechanically 
agitated tanks.  The leach product will pass to a series of four counter current decantation (CCD) 
thickeners.  The pregnant solution will go to a Merrill-Crowe precipitation circuit.  Precipitated 
gold and silver will be recovered from solution for acid digestion, dewatering and smelting.  The 
final product will be a doré bar containing mainly silver which will be dispatched for refining.  
The mineral processing is further discussed and described in Section 17.4.

Nayarit Gold Inc.  15-1 
Orion Project, Del Norte Zone   NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 5, 2010 
Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

15 Mineral Resources (Item 19) 
The mineral resource estimate was prepared by Jeffrey Volk, CPG, Principal Resource Geologist 
with SRK, and independent of Nayarit Gold.  Gold and Silver grade estimations were made from 
a three-dimensional block model based on grade assignments using commercial mine planning 
software (Vulcan® v7.5 build 627).  The project limits are based in the UTM coordinate system 
using a parent block size of 2 x 2 x 2m, and sub-blocking at a 1 x 1 x 1m size at Animas/Del 
Norte, and a parent block size of 3 x 3 x 3m sub-blocking to a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5m size for La 
Estrella and San Francisco.  Three individual block models were constructed for the Animas/Del 
Norte, La Estrella, and San Francisco mineralized zones. 

Gold and silver mineralization at Animas/Del Norte, La Estrella and San Francisco is constrained 
within veins, stockworks and breccias, confined by hanging wall and footwall andesitic and 
rhyolitic rocks.  Drillholes are predominantly angled, averaging -50o to the south.  Polymetaillic 
gold-silver mineralization tends to exhibit relatively constant dips of 79-85° to the NNW (005 to 
025O).  The exception to this is the Animas vein, which has been interpreted as a south dipping 
(~200o) structural zone.  Drilling tends to be on an average of 25-40m spacing in the Animas/Del 
Norte zone, and 50-100m in the La Estrella, San Francisco and Pantaleona zones along the strike 
of the veins within the deposits.  The majority of drilling occurred during the period 2005-2009. 

SRK generated the resource estimate based on composites derived from drillhole sample assay 
results.  The updated Animas/Del Norte, grade estimation was constrained by a 1.5g/t Au 
equivalent grade solid generated by Leapfrog™ Software.  The San Francisco and La Estrella 
estimates were not updated from the previous iteration, which was  constrained by a 0.3g/t Au 
equivalent 3-D manually interpreted grade solid.  No geologic model was utilized for resource 
estimation.  Grade interpolation was based on the geology, drillhole spacing and geostatistical 
analysis of the data.  Blocks in the resource model were classified by their proximity to the 
sample locations and number of drillholes.  SRK finds the resource model and resource 
classification to be acceptable for resource reporting under CIM guidelines. 

15.1 Drillhole Database 
A drillhole database was provided to SRK by Nayarit in Microsoft Access format.  The database 
consists of drillhole collar, survey, assay, lithology, geotech and QA/QC data, and was found to 
be well organized and comprehensive.  At total of 272 collar records were provided, comprising 
a total of 61,839.61m of drilling.  The drillholes range between 42.5 to 609.45m in length, with 
an average length of 227.35m.  All raw data was imported into Vulcan for statistical analysis, 
compositing and grade estimation. 

15.2 Geologic Modeling and Topography 
Although detailed geologic logging information is available for all drillholes in the drillhole 
database, none of these data have been utilized for 3-D geology/structure interpretation.  SRK 
recommends that the detailed geologic logging data be utilized for construction of a 3-D geologic 
model, for use in future resource estimation and data analysis. 

In order to assess the continuity of mineralization at Animas/Del Norte at a higher cut-off, SRK 
generated Leapfrog™ grade solids at a nominal 1.5 g/t Au equivalent cut-off.  Leapfrog™ allows 
for the rapid generation of 3-D solids and provides a reliable basis for use in resource estimation 
in situations where manually generated shapes are not possible.  SRK verified these resulting

shapes in section and plan by comparing to the underlying 1m composite data, and found that the 
Leapfrog shapes reasonably represented distribution of grade above a 1.5 g/t Au equivalent cut-
off. 

SRK was provided with a number of 0.3 g/t Au equivalent grade solids constructed by Nayarit 
Mexico geology staff for the previously estimated San Francisco and La Estrella models, based 
on cross-sectional interpretations using the raw assay data.  SRK modified these shapes to better 
reconcile in plan and section and used these as constraining boundaries for grade estimation.  A 
summary of number of solids and total volume for each model area is provided in Table 15.2.1.

Model Area Number of Grade Solids Total Volume (m3) 
Animas/Del Norte Leapfrog Solid 467,341.05 
La Estrella 1 1,209,879.60 
San Francisco 4 1,270,321.86 

 

Topographic data was provided to SRK by Nayarit in digital (DXF) format.  The provided 2m 
topography was generated from 1m IKONOS satellite images processed by Photosat 
Information, Ltd. of Vancouver, BC Canada.  The images were captured in the spring of 2009.  
Ground control was by differential GPS and total station based on the elevation of a Mexican 
Government control point at the PP (Point of Beginning) at La Estrella. 

15.3 Exploratory Data Analysis 
Statistical analysis of the gold and silver raw assay data was conducted in order to assess grade 
distribution as a function of lithology.  As was previously described, most of the metal occurs 
within quartz veins and andesitic rocks, on a grade*thickness basis.  Summary statistics of gold 
and silver data grouped by lithology are provided in Table 15.3.1 and 15.3.2, respectively.

The raw assay dataset was inspected for the presence of high-grade outlier values that could 
adversely impact grade estimation.  After review of log probability plots, the raw data were 
capped using the levels indicated in Table 15.3.3.  All raw data were capped prior to 
compositing.  Log probability plots for Au and Ag are provided in Figure 15-1 and Figure 15-2, 
respectively.

Au 25.0 13 99.91 7.59 
Ag 2000 17 99.94 5.67 

 

15.4 Compositing 
All capped raw assay data was composited into 1m lengths for Animas/Del Norte and into 1.5m 
downhole lengths for the La Estrella and San Francisco areas.  All composites were back-flagged 
by the block model to assign individual codes for each of the various grade shapes for retrieval 
during grade estimation. 

SRK conducted manual composite calculations to verify the downhole compositing results from 
Vulcan for several holes, and found them to be identical. 

15.5 Specific Gravity 
The database file provided by Nayarit included 301 bulk density determinations with drillhole 
ID, depth of the sample, density and lithology.  The density values were averaged by lithology 
excluding a single outlier value.  Table 15.5.1 provides a summary of average density by rock 
type.  As no geologic model currently exists to allow assignment of density by lithology, an 
average density of 2.556gm/cm3 was assigned to all model blocks for use in tonnage 
calculations.  SRK recommends that future resource estimates incorporate the development of a 
3-D geologic model to facilitate assignment of density based on lithology.

15.6 Variogram Analysis and Modeling 
SRK conducted extensive directional variogram analysis using the 1.5m gold and silver 
composite data contained within the grade solid boundaries.  Due the erratic nature of

mineralization, directional variograms were characterized by relatively high nugget/sill ratios, 
and short total ranges.  SRK was unable to produce meaningful variograms for defining in search 
parameters and anisotropy for use in grade estimation, 

SRK also generated 3-D omni-directional correlograms to assess spatial continuity using the 
exhaustive composite dataset.  An example 3-D correlogram is provided in Figure 15-3.  This 
correlogram displays a high nugget:sill ratio and a relatively short range of ~100m. 

15.7 Block Model Limits 
Sub-blocked models were created in Vulcan for each of the three model areas, with the origins, 
extents and block sizes provided in Table 15.7.1 through Table 15.7.3:

Vulcan sub-blocked models were created for each of the three model areas, filling the 1.5g/t Au 
equivalent grade shapes at Animas-Del Norte and the 0.3g/t Au equivalent grade shapes at San 
Francisco and La Estrella.  The model was also back coded with percent below the current 
topographic surface, in order to constrain grade estimation.  The block models were rotated so 
that block edges coincided with the average orientation of strike of the veins. 

15.8 Grade Estimation 
Gold and silver grades were estimated by inverse distance weighing (ID3) using a nested search 
strategy.  The 1.0m (Del Norte/Animas) 1.5m (San Francisco and La Estrella) composite data 
were retrieved by individual grade solids for use in grade estimation.  A nearest neighbor 
estimate was also conducted for each of the zones, for use in model validation.  As variographic 
analysis results were inconclusive in terms of defining a meaningful search anisotropy, SRK

elected to use the average strike and dip of the individual grade solids as a basis for search 
orientation.  Identical search strategies were utilized to estimate both gold and silver grades.  
Composite selection criteria and search parameters are provided in Table 15.8.1 through Table

15.9 Model Validation 
The results of the modeling process were validated using several methods.  These include a 
thorough visual inspection of the model grades relative to the underlying drillhole composite 
grades, statistical comparison of the block model grade distributions with the underlying 
composite data, comparisons with the nearest neighbor model above a zero Au equivalent cut-
off, and grade distribution comparisons with the nearest neighbor models using swath plots. 

15.9.1 Visual Inspection 
A detailed visual inspection of the block model was conducted in both section and plan, 
comparing block grades with the underling composite data.  This included confirmation of the 
proper coding of blocks within the respective grade solids as well as accurate coding below the 
topographic surface.  Example level plans and cross-sections through the three block model 
areas, showing block grades, grade zone triangulations, composite data, and resource pit outline 
(where applicable) are provided in Figure s 15-4 through Figure 15-9. 

15.9.2 Statistical Verification 
SRK has conducted statistical comparisons between the block model grade distributions and the 
underlying composite data distributions.  These comparisons show that although the block grade 
distribution is smoothed relative to the composite data, the block tonnage, grade and contained 
metal above cut-off and between incremental cut-offs closely matched that of the underlying 
composite data.  Histogram comparisons between gold and silver composites and block model 
grades are provided in Figures 15-10 through 15-15 for the three model areas. 

15.9.3 Comparison of Grade Interpolation Methods 
For comparative purposes, additional gold and silver models were generated using nearest 
neighbor (NN) interpolation methods using identical composite data.  The results of these models 
are compared to the inverse distance models above a zero Au equivalent cut-off grade for each of 
the three model areas.  Overall, there is very good agreement between the inverse distance 
models and their corresponding NN models (Tables 15.9.3.1 through 15.9.3.3).  The percent 
differences in total contained Au equivalent ounces between the inverse distance and nearest 
neighbor models varied between, -4.73% and +7.41% for blocks classified as indicated and 
inferred resources, with total contained Au equivalent metal displaying a difference of -3.68% in 
the ID3 model as compared to the NN model.  These results are reasonable, and increases the 
confidence in the overall resource estimate.

15.10 Resource Classification 
The mineral resources at the Orion project are classified in accordance with the CIM standards 
for mineral resources and mineral reserves (December 2005).  The classification parameters are 
based on distance to nearest composite data and number of composites utilized to inform block 
grades, and are intended to encompass zones of reasonably continuous mineralization. 

During the grade estimation process, distance to closest composite, average distance and number 
of drillholes used to estimate the block were also stored in the block model.  Using these values 
as a basis, blocks were classified as follows: 

• Measured Mineral Resources –SRK chose not to classify any mineral resources as 
Measured Mineral Resources, based on the lack of documented production history; 

• Indicated Mineral Resources – blocks in the model estimated using a minimum of two 
drillholes that are at maximum block-sample separation distance of 40m; and 

• Inferred Mineral Resources – blocks in the model not meeting the criteria for indicated 
resources but are within a maximum block-sample separation distance of 160m from a 
drillhole internal to the grade solids, or external to the grade solids within a maximum 
distance of .30m from a drillhole (Animas/Del Norte-Pantaleona only). 

15.11 Mineral Resource Statement 
SRK has estimated the mineral resources for the Orion Project as an Indicated Mineral Resource 
of 1.107Mt grading 3.66g/t Au and 309.24g/t Ag, containing 314koz AuEq.  An additional 
0.181Mt grading 3.33g/t Au and 94.52g/t Ag containing 28koz AuEq oz has been classified as 
Inferred Mineral Resource. 

The mineral resources are reported in accordance with CSA NI 43-101 and have been estimated 
in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserves Best Practices" guidelines.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral 
resource will be converted into mineral reserves.  The estimate of this resource was completed by 
Jeffrey Volk, CPG, an independent Qualified Person, as this term is defined in NI 43-101.  The 
effective date of this resource estimate is February 1, 2010 and based on drillhole data provided 
to SRK up to July 18, 2009. 

The mineral resources are reported at cut-off grades to reflect the "reasonable prospects" for 
economic extraction.  SRK considers that portions of the Orion gold-silver deposits are amenable 
for underground mining methods.  After analysis of processing and mining options and trade-off 
studies to determine the most attractive project economics, SRK has concluded that extraction of 
portions of the Orion deposit by open pit methods is no longer the preferred alternative. 

Underground resources are stated above a 2.0g/t gold equivalent cut-off contained within grade 
shapes generated using Leapfrog™ software, and reflect a reasonable break-even cut-off based 
on current cost and metallurgical recovery estimates. 

Gold equivalents were calculated using a silver-gold ratio of 60:1, with metallurgical recovery 
and net smelter returns assumed to be 100%. 

The mineral resources statement for the Orion project is presented in Table 15.11.1.

Open Pit Mining Alternative 
Potential open pit mining operations for the Animas/Del Norte Project would be characterized by 
a high stripping ratio pit (approximately 21:1, waste to minable resource) comprised of multiple 
vein gold/silver mineralization situated in a moderate topographical relief.  Open pit mining 
would also be challenged by periods of heavy rainfall, limited waste dump space, and limited 
mine life. 

An open mine plan would be driven by the provision of waste rock early on for tailings dam 
construction and process production rate requirements.  Minable resources would require 
selective mining techniques given the relatively thin and dipping orientation of the 
mineralization leading to possible grade control and dilution issues. 

A preliminary open pit design was determined to be approximately 600m along strike, 300m 
wide and 120m deep with a volume of 9.8Mm3.  The pit limits were designed to be within the 
path of the adjacent main arroyo, although a partial diversion channel for the arroyo was 
incorporated into the design.  The pit design was broken into two phases for scheduling 
purposes, with 15m wide ramps, triple benches (to a 15m height), 10m berms and a maximum

in-pit haul road grade of 10%.  Ramp widths were sized at 15m for two way hauling and 10m for 
one way hauling near the pit bottom.  This would limit the size of mining equipment used. 

Positioning of waste dumps would be limited to areas excluded for infrastructure development, 
without future exploration potential, and outside of any major water channels.  This situation 
generally leaves an area to the north of the deposit for locating waste dumps.  However, due to 
the positioning of such a proposed waste dump, the waste haulage costs from the open pit would 
be above normal due to the waste hauls being almost all uphill for the loaded portion of those 
hauls. 

One scenario was also evaluated whereby both open pit mining and underground mining would 
occur, but this was not found to be economically attractive. 

Analysis of the Whittle™ pit optimization results for the best-case mining scenario (nested pit) 
shows distinct "steps" in the ratio between mineralized resources and waste mining required in 
expansion of the pit shapes.  This suggests the mineralization is located in three distinct zones 
and implies the resource may have been somewhat under-drilled from an open pit perspective.  
Generally, orebodies that outcrop at surface (as does Del Norte) normally have a smooth 
stripping ratio profile increase for successive expansions of the pit (and which is not seen in this 
case).  The topography is not severe enough to cause the significant step-like increases in 
stripping ratios noted. 

Nevertheless, the present reality of a high stripping ratio and the other issues noted, combine to 
make open pit mining relatively unattractive economically when compared to the underground 
mining alternatives.  This was reflected in the conceptual trade-off studies for the open pit 
project scenarios.  For these reasons an underground mining scenario was selected for the PEA. 

Processing Method Alternatives 
The recoverable values in the Animas/Del Norte material are shown to be split between gold and 
silver with the contribution of silver around 40% more than gold.  The plant therefore has to be 
designed for the high silver feed grade. 

Conceptual treatment flowsheets were developed by SRK from the initial preliminary testwork 
into milled ore performance and from additional testwork on coarse-crushed material.  Three 
basic alternative concepts were considered in the conceptual evaluations; two incorporating 
cyanidation and a further flotation alternative.  The two basic cyanidation alternatives included 
milling with tank leaching, and heap leaching.  Because of the high silver levels, the proposed 
leaching flowsheets are focused on the effective recovery of silver with the lower grade gold 
following the silver into bullion product. 

The various alternative potential mining plans and treatment options (shown in Table 17.1.1) 
were initially considered, and indicative capital and operating costs were investigated along with 
forecast metal recoveries for these options.  These considered different ore feeds from the 
different mining methods (open pit and underground mining) and different treatment rates.  In 
summary, all three processing alternatives have some merit although the milling and cyanidation 
route results in the highest precious metal recovery.  A downside of this process route is the 
relatively high initial capital expenditure and operating costs compared with other possible 
alternatives. 

Issues with the Animas/Del Norte Project from a processing perspective concern the limited 
resource quantity and relatively high operating costs associated with a low production rate and

Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

indicated reagent consumptions.  The optimum treatment approach is therefore mainly an 
economic problem, particularly related to metal recoveries, initial capital costs and short life of 
mine. 

The proposed mining plan selected was underground mining, which resulted in a relatively high 
predicted feed grade to the plant at a gold equivalent feed grade of around 6.9g/t (AuEq).  This 
justified the selection of a high recovery milling and tank leaching option, especially if there is 
potential for the identification of additional resources and reserves in the area. 

Following in this section, the three basic initial process alternatives are discussed.  Additional 
details on the selected milling and tank leach alternative are given in Section 17.4.  In the initial 
conceptual assessment phase all three basic processing options were indicated as viable. 

Both direct cyanidation and flotation were shown from testwork to be effective in treating the 
Animas/Del Norte ore.  Based on the preliminary testwork, direct cyanidation using milling and 
tank leaching was shown to achieve the highest recoveries of precious metals (around 92% for 
gold and 88% silver).  Given the anticipated high feed grade this would seem to be the optimum 
flowsheet metallurgically. 

Heap leaching could be effective in treating the Animas/Del Norte material and would result in 
lower initial capital costs, but could only be expected to achieve lower precious metal recoveries 
of around 65%.  Heap leaching may be effective on low grade material from an open pit mining 
operation that is too low-grade to justify the cost of milling.  However, heap leaching was also 
evaluated as a primary treatment option for the all the identified resources (both from open pit 
and underground mining options) due to the lower estimated capital and operating costs. 

Flotation of a sulfide concentrate could be effective in producing a low volume product 
containing the majority of the precious metal, which could initially go for toll treatment (or sale) 
and would result in lower capital and operating costs compared to milling with tank leaching.  
Either a flotation rougher or cleaner concentrate can be produced.  In the longer-term it would be 
more effective to treat the concentrate on site, as was evaluated in the flotation process 
alternatives incorporating intensive cyanidation using processes and equipment such as the 
Gekko™ In-line leach reactor (ILR).  The Gekko™ ILR process involves an intense cyanidation 
of the flotation concentrates in a rotary reaction vessel.  However, all of the milling with flotation 
and concentrate treatment methods resulted in lower overall metal recoveries when compared to 
direct cyanidation using milling and tank leaching. 

Gravity concentration could be effective in possibly improving overall recoveries, particularly 
for the flotation route where the gravity concentrate could be added to the flotation concentrate.  
Gravity concentration has currently been excluded from the circuit until further testwork 
demonstrates advantages, although could possibly result in the early production of precious 
metals from the circuit and reduced lock up in the process. 

Indicative capital costs for the different treatment options were generated.  Initial capital and 
operating costs were estimated from in-house database information, and operating costs 
calculated based on first principles using consumption and other data from the metallurgical 
testwork.  Further comparisons were undertaken against other plant cost estimates and published 
data from recently completed studies and projects in Mexico.  Where costs were not available for 
the proposed production rate at Animas/Del Norte, or were considered to be outdated, they were

Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

factored accordingly.  The alternative mining and treatment options were compared using a 
series of economic models. 

In summary: direct cyanidation using milling and tank leaching was shown to achieve the highest 
metal recoveries, but had the highest capital and operating costs; flotation and concentrate 
treatment methods resulted in lower metal recoveries, but had lower capital and operating costs; 
heap leaching produced the lowest metal recoveries, but had the lowest capital and operating 
costs.  Milling and tank leaching, and the flotation alternatives had generally comparable overall 
economic results using base case metal prices (taking into account the level of accuracy of the 
studies with available data).  Compared to milling and tank leaching, heap leaching indicated a 
higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR), but a lower Net Present Value (NPV), and showed an 
inferior response to higher metal prices.  Direct cyanidation using milling and tank leaching 
achieved the highest metal recoveries, was economically comparable to the flotation alternatives 
at base case metal prices, and indicated a superior upside response to higher metal prices.  
Therefore, the latter was selected as the processing alternative. 

17.1.2 Conceptual Alternative Treatment Processes 
Further details of the conceptual Heap Leaching and Flotation alternatives are provided here. 

Heap Leaching 
For the heap leach alternative the feed material would be initially crushed and agglomerated 
prior to stacking.  The stacked material would be irrigated with cyanide solution.  A preliminary 
flowsheet would consist of the following process steps: 

• Ore receipt and primary crushing; 

• Primary crushed ore buffer storage; 

• Secondary and tertiary closed circuit crushing using vibrating screens; 

• Agglomeration with cement in a drum agglomerator; 

• Stacking using conveyors, trucks and stacker; 

• Irrigation with cyanide solution; 

• Use of pregnant, barren and emergency (storm runoff) solution ponds; 

• Pregnant solution clarification, Merrill-Crowe precipitation and recovery of precious 
metals; 

• Acid digestion; and 

• Precious metal smelting to doré.

The optimum heap leach parameters are still to be established, although for the evaluation the 
above parameters were assumed.  In the preliminary column testwork the material was not 
agglomerated, however on a large scale heap this would be typically applied on a feed crushed to 
80% < 6mm depending of the level of fines generated in the crushing circuit and the percolation 
performance on the heap. 

Milling and Flotation 
A preliminary flowsheet would consist of the following process steps: 

• Primary crushing; 

• Crushed ore storage; 

• SAG or ball milling and hydrocyclone classification; 

• Rougher and scavenger flotation; 

• Cleaner flotation; and 

• Dewatering of the cleaner concentrate. 
Future on-site treatment of the cleaner concentrate could be considered and this would include 
intensive cyanidation using a Gekko™ in-line reactor (ILR), or equivalent unit, with direct 
electrowinning of precious metals from the leachate after clarification. 

The optimum comminution configuration (SAG milling or fine crushing and ball milling) is still 
to be investigated and evaluated, and this is also influenced by the availability of second-hand 
plant and equipment.

Milling and Tank Leaching 
Details on the milling and tank leach alternative are given in Section 17.4. 

17.1.3 General Operations 
As previously discussed, an underground mining scenario was selected for the PEA in order to 
feed a mill at a throughput rate of 750t/d of ore.  Annual throughput is based on 92% mechanical 
availability of the mill over 365 days, resulting in an annual throughput of 252kt of ore. 

A site layout is presented in Figure 17-1.

Underground mine design work in this PEA is based on Indicated and Inferred resources located 
in the Animas-Del Norte area only.  Resources within the La Estrella and San Francisco areas are 
currently considered to be too limited in extent and distant from the Animas-Del Norte area to 
support separate underground operations.

The available geotechnical information indicates that a sublevel longhole stoping method with 
backfill would be successful in obtaining a high extraction ratio in the economic portion of the 
orebody. 

The mine design process involved preparing mineable stope wireframes based on an economic 
cut-off grade applied to an equivalent gold grade block model.  The stope wireframes were 
evaluated against the block model for volume, tonnage and grade.  Dilution and recovery were 
added to the designed tonnage to account for unplanned stope dilution and pillar loss.  The 
engineering mine design was carried out using Maptek Vulcan 8.0 software. 

Access and infrastructure development was designed to support the sublevel longhole stoping 
method and sized based on mining equipment and production rate requirements. 

The production schedule was prepared for a production rate of 750t/d using Minemax iGannt 3.6 
software. 

17.2.2 Selection of Mining Method 
Cut-off Grade Calculation 
The cut-off grade calculation for underground mining is shown in Table 17.2.2.1.  The mining 
cost is based on recent contractor quotes for a similar project in Mexico.  The cost includes ore 
development, longhole drilling, blasting, mucking, hauling, backfill preparation and placement 
and mine support services.  All main ramp and orebody access development costs are assumed to 
be capitalized. 

Table 17.2.2.1: Underground Cut-off Grade Calculation 

Parameter Amount Unit 
Mining cost 32.57 $/t 
Process and tailings cost 25.86 $/t 
Admin cost 6.35 $/t 
Total Cost 64.78 $/t 
Gold price 850 $/oz 
Average mill recovery 90% 
Refinery charges 3.00 $/oz 
Net oz value 847.0 $/oz 
Cut off grade 2.6  g/t 

 

Process plant costs are based on the milling and tank leaching option described in Section 17.4.  
Tailings costs are based on conventional slurry storage and a compacted soil dam overlain with 
an HDPE geomembrane to inhibit seepage to the environment. 

Administration costs are based on SRK experience with similar projects in Mexico. 

The gold price was an estimated projection of the gold price at the commencement of the mine 
design process.  All silver grade values were converted to gold equivalence for mine design 
purposes, using a silver to gold price ratio of 60:1. 

The average mill recovery of 90% is based on a gold recovery of 92% and a silver recovery of 
88%.   

The cut-off grade applied to determine the potentially mineable resource is 2.6g/t-AuEq.

Geotechnical Design  
A moderate amount of geotechnical data was gathered during the geological core logging 
process.  SRK has summarized this data for the immediate 5m of the orebody hangingwall, the 
orebody and the immediate 5m of the orebody footwall.  The orebody was defined in the 
geotechnical assessment as the mineralized zone above the 2.6g/t-AuEq grade. 

Figure 17-2 shows the Rock Quality Designation (RQD) results for the footwall, orebody and 
hangingwall.  The limit of the mineralization and economic mining area is shown overlaying the 
RQD results. 

In general terms, it appears that relatively poor ground conditions can be expected in the near 
surface areas of the orebody in both the hangingwall and footwall (blue shading).  Although 
these areas are currently planned for longhole mining, it may be necessary to use a cut-and-fill 
methodology in these areas in order to reduce dilution that may result from large unsupported 
spans.  The orebody is generally more competent than the hangingwall and footwall. 

Figure 17-3 shows the results of "field-guide" estimated rock strength.  These results closely 
match the RQD results with the orebody generally estimated as stronger than the hangingwall 
and footwall. 

At the preliminary assessment level it was considered suitable to apply a longhole method with 
15m sublevel spacing and backfill to the project.  A more thorough geotechnical assessment will 
be required for the next level of study which will include orientated core, triple tube geotechnical 
drilling and re-logging of selected existing drillholes. 

17.2.3 Stope Design 
Figure 17-4 shows a view of the resource estimation block model filtered to show only blocks 
above the cut-off grade.  This model formed the basis of the stope design.  The model was sliced 
at 15m horizontal intervals and on each level the economic ore was outlined in a manner suitable 
for practical application of longhole mining. 

Figure 17-5 shows the stope design process for three 15m levels.  The first three slices show the 
economic outlines on each level, the next diagram shows an isometric view with the construction 
lines for the stopes.  The final diagram shows the final stope triangulations. 

Note that the brown colored shapes indicate stopes that will be mined using a longitudinal 
method and the blue colored shapes will be mined transverse.  The criteria used to differentiate 
between transverse and longitudinal stopes in this study was 10m economic orebody width. 
Longitudinal mining ore development access was planned for areas of the orebody where the 
thickness was less than 10m.  Areas greater than 10m wide will be mined from footwall accesses 
and ore development that runs perpendicular to the strike of the ore. 

Figure 17-6 presents the final stope design with the block model above cut-off grade overlain.  
The design encompasses the majority of the material above cut-off but some small, narrow 
and/or distant blocks have been excluded from the design. 

17.2.4 Development Design 
Figures 17-7 and 17-8 show the main ramp access development starting to the north of the 
orebody close to the process plant site.  The first section of the ramp runs south and crosses 
through the orebody taking advantage of a barren section.  Once in the orebody footwall, the

ramp spirals up and down to access all the stope areas.  The main ramp has a cross section of 
4.5m wide x 4m high and a total length of 3,480m, which includes a 15% contingency for 
remuck bays, safety bays, and sumps that have not been designed in detail. 

Figure 17-9 shows the waste development used to access the sublevels at 15m spacing 
throughout the orebody.  The waste development has a cross section of 4m wide x 4m high and a 
total length of 5,680m, which includes 10% contingency in addition to the design. 

Figure 17-10 shows the ore development on the sublevels.  The ore development was designed 
with a cross section of 4m x 4m and a total length of 4,890m. 

Figure 17-11 shows a compilation of the complete stoping and development design. 

17.2.5 Mineable Resources 
The mine design process results in a mineable resource of 1.18Mt (diluted) at a silver grade of 
267g/t and a gold grade of 2.79g/t.  Before process recovery, the orebody contains 106,000oz 
gold and 10.15Moz silver. 

This estimate is based on a cut-off grade of 2.6g/t gold equivalent and on applying 95% mining 
recovery to the designed wireframes in addition to 15% unplanned waste dilution. 

17.2.6 Mining Operations 
Development 
Mechanized development mining will be undertaken using a combination of single and twin- 
boom drill jumbos.  Twin boom jumbos will be used primarily in the waste access development 
where the advance will be under survey control.  Single boom jumbos will be utilized primarily 
in ore development under geological control. 

It is estimated that two jumbos, one twin-boom and one single-boom could undertake all the 
development work, however it is likely that a contractor would bring a third machine to act as 
backup.  The majority of the development occurs in the first two years and development will 
reduce significantly in Years three to five. 

Development mucking will be undertaken by 6yd LHD's dumping into 27t trucks which will 
haul the waste rock to a stockpile on surface.  When stoping commences, most of the waste 
material will be transferred directly to stopes for backfilling. 

Ground support will be in the form of 1.8m split sets and #9 wire screen.  Drilling for ground 
support will be undertaken by the development jumbos or using hand held drills from a scissor 
lift. 

Drilling 
Longhole drilling will be undertaken by mobile or crawler mounted down-hole hammer drills.  
Electrical infrastructure will be provided to power the drill and on-board compressor. 

Blasting 
Longhole stopes will be blasted using standard blasting techniques depending on the ground 
conditions, drill spacing and presence of ground water.

Mucking and Hauling 
Stope mucking will be by using 6yd LHD's loading into 27t trucks, which will haul to the mill 
stockpile on surface, and will be capable of remote control operation to protect the operators. 

Backfill 
Backfill material will be a combination of cemented rock fill (CRF) and waste fill (WF).  A total 
of 299,000t of waste rock will be produced through the underground development process.  The 
total quantity of fill required for the life of the operation is 608,000t.  The difference of 309,000t 
will be quarried locally and transported to the backfill plant. 

During the first year of operation most of the development waste will be stockpiled on surface.  
Once stoping operations commence, the waste stockpile will be reclaimed as backfill.  A simple 
CRF plant will be built whereby trucks full of waste will drive under a cement slurry loadout, the 
slurry will be dumped directly onto the waste in the truck and driving the truck underground and 
dumping into the stopes will mix the CRF.  A ratio of approximately 50%CRF to 50%WR will 
be utilized in the backfilling process. 

Trucks backhauling backfill material to the stopes will dump the fill in muck bays, from where it 
will be transported to and dumped into the stopes using remote control LHD's. 

17.2.7 Production Schedule 
The development and stoping schedule is shown graphically on Figure 17-12.  The schedule is 
based on the following assumptions:

provide the 117m3/s required to ventilate the mine.  The two ventilation raises will be sited such 
that one serves the north mining block and the other serves the south mining block.

17.3  Hydrogeology 
The underground mine may be developed up to a depth of 300 to 400m below ground surface.  
The deposit is associated with a near vertical, 30m wide fault zone consisting of quartz veining 
and stockworks.  The measurement of hydraulic properties of rocks and structures that may be 
encountered within the underground mine footprint were considered critical to the accurate 
prediction of long-term groundwater inflow rates and associated environmental impacts.  As a 
result, SRK undertook a preliminary (scoping) level hydrogeology program in August 2009 with 
the following objectives: 

• To test the hydraulic characteristics of exposed rocks within a limited number of drill 
holes, and develop a vertical distribution, or profile, of horizontal hydraulic conductivity 
(Kh) values in each corehole; and  

• Characterize the groundwater chemistry, if possible. 
One new (OR-09-271) and three existing (OR-08-114, OR-09-232, OR-09-244) coreholes were 
used to evaluate the hydraulic properties of the formations, structures and surface hydrological 
features within the area of the proposed mine.  Corehole OR-09-271 was drilled to a depth of 
296m below ground surface and the remaining existing coreholes ranged in depths from 96m to 
330m.  With the exception of OR-09-271 (vertical), the existing coreholes were drilled at angles 
ranging from 50 to 60° from horizontal.  Hydraulic airlift tests were conducted in the new 
corehole in a continuous sequence, and in existing coreholes as overlapping intervals to provide 
profiles of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kh) of the coreholes with depth. 

Prior to testing, each existing corehole was cleaned of debris by running HQ diameter drill rods 
and core bit to the total depth at each location using a Boart Longyear drill rig.  The airlift 
"pumping" method of testing is described in SRK's hydrogeological report. 

Measured values of Kh were varied in a range of 4.7x10-4m/d to 2x10-2m/d with geometrical 
mean of 2.2x10-3m/d and average value of 3.3x10-3m/d 

Groundwater samples were collected from each airlifted corehole during the test, which exposed 
the maximum amount of rock, or in the test interval, which included the highly fractured ore 
zone.  The samples were specially collected and preserved under standard chain-of-custody 
procedures.  Water quality measurements including pH, conductivity, and temperature were 
collected periodically during airlifting and when the groundwater sample was collected.  The 
groundwater samples were submitted to Laboratorio Technoambiental S.A. de C.V in Chihuahua 
Mexico, and analyzed. 

Groundwater sample chemistry results were relatively consistent between boreholes with the 
exception of OR-09-271, which exhibited a sulfate concentration an order of magnitude lower 
and a slightly higher total alkalinity than the remaining coreholes. 

Generally, the water level contours mimic the shape of the topography with the groundwater 
level high located within the approximate center of the proposed mine area. 

Based on the results of the study, the geologic formations evaluated within the proposed mine 
area did not exhibit hydraulic conductivity values that would suggest a potential for large, long-
term groundwater inflows to the proposed ramp system, or the necessity of active dewatering 
measures.

Similarly, the groundwater elevation data provided by Nayarit also indicated that the hydraulic 
conductivity values within the mine area are relatively low based on the difference between the 
high and low measured water levels.  (Water levels suggestive of a high permeability would be 
relatively uniform across the site (significantly less than the actual measured differences in the 
water levels). 

Groundwater chemistry does not suggest a potential problem with the quality of mine water 
discharge.  However, based on a review of the data provided by the laboratory, the results 
indicate further groundwater sampling should be undertaken. 

17.4 Processing 
As previously discussed, selection was made of a milling and tank leaching option for 
processing, based on economic evaluations and potential upside in precious metal prices.  In this 
section the selected process alternative is presented.  The plant will be designed for the high 
silver feed grade, with the gold following the silver to bullion. 

17.4.1  Milling and Tank Leaching 
Based on the preliminary testwork, direct cyanidation using milling and tank leach has been 
shown to achieve the highest recoveries of precious metal recovery (around 92% for gold and 
88% silver), and based on the anticipated high feed grade, would seem to be the optimum 
flowsheet metallurgically.  However, the initial higher capital cost and limited life-of-mine, 
result in a reduction of advantages in the high recovery using the milling and tank leaching, but 
due to the higher recoveries a preference for the milling and tank leach option is justifiable. 

SRK developed a conceptual plant design for the milling and tank leaching route which was used 
to develop indicative capital and operating costs.  A preliminary schematic flowsheet for the 
milling and tank leaching route is presented in Figure 17-13 and consists of the following 
process steps: 

• Primary crushing; 

• Crushed ore storage; 

• SAG milling and hydrocyclone classification; 

• Thickening; 

• Cyanide leach in mechanically agitated tanks; 

• Four-stage CCD washing of the leached solids in thickeners; 

• Pregnant solution storage and clarification; 

• Package Merrill Crowe precipitation and precious metal recovery circuit; 

• Acid digestion of the precipitate; 

• Precious metal smelting to doré; and 

• Tailings detoxification and disposal. 
Ore would be received from the mine and processed in one stage of crushing to be suitable as 
mill feed.

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 5, 2010 
Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

Crushed ore will be stored on a stockpile of two days live capacity.  From the stockpile ore will 
be reclaimed by vibrating feeders and route to a single stage SAG mill operating in closed circuit 
with a cluster of hydrocyclones.  The cyclone underflow will return to the mill while the over 
flow will be thickened in a high rate thickener to around 55% solids.  The thickener underflow 
will be routed to the leach while the overflow is returned to the milling circuit. 

Leach will consist of a series of large mechanically agitated tanks operating in series with an 
overall leach residence time will be 96 hours.  Cyanide will be added to the leach circuit. 

Leach product will pass to a series of four counter current decantation (CCD) thickeners.  
Overflow solution from the first thickener (pregnant solution) will pass to storage while the 
underflow slurry will pass through the other thickener stages to be washed of dissolved precious 
metals. 

The pregnant solution will be clarified in pressure filters and the clarified solution will pass to 
the Merrill Crowe precipitation circuit.  In the Merrill Crowe circuit the solution will be de-
aerated and the precious metals will then be precipitated from solution using zinc powder which 
is dosed into the reactor vessel.  The precipitated gold and silver will be recovered from solution 
onto pre-coated filters with the filter cake periodically removed for acid digestion, dewatering 
and smelting.  The final product will be a doré bar containing mainly silver, which will be 
dispatched for refining. 

The washed solid tails from the CCD will be treated for the destruction of residual cyanide and 
dispatched to the tailing storage facility.  Recovered water from the TSF will be returned to the 
plant to be used as wash water. 

17.4.2 Plant Design Parameters 
The following preliminary design parameters were selected to establish the plant design used for 
the estimation of indicative capital and operating costs in the PEA.  The plant throughput is

17.4.3 Flowsheet Variations 
SAG milling has been proposed in the initial evaluation as a way of simplifying the comminution 
circuit and possibly reducing the capital cost of a new plant.  However, an alternative is the use 
of fine crushing and ball milling, which may realize capital and operating cost savings, 
particularly if packaged, or second hand plant or equipment were to be available. 

17.4.4 Tailings Storage Facility 
A conceptual Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) layout was developed by SRK for a 1.2Mt slurried 
TSF, and is shown in Figure 17-14.  (Alternative locations were also identified.)  The TSF layout 
was developed using the following assumptions: 

• Conventional slurry tailings storage, assuming an average dry density of 1,200kg/m3 and 
flat (0%) tailings surface slope; and 

• The TSF Impoundment would be constructed with a barrier system to inhibit seepage 
losses to the environment, consisting of a low permeability compacted soil, overlain by 
an 80mil HDPE geomembrane. 

A PEA level estimate was developed for the slurried TSF option.  Assumptions included the 
following: 

• SRK developed a stage capacity curve for the conceptual slurried TSF layout, and 
estimated a cost for a 1.2Mt TSF; 

• Over-excavation (unsuitable foundation material) was estimated at 20% of the 
embankment volume; 

• The embankment volume was estimated from a stage-capacity curve of the impoundment 
area; 

• Regrading within the impoundment limits was estimated at 15% of the embankment 
volume; 

• A 300mm thick low permeability compacted soil, overlain by an 80mil HDPE 
geomembrane; 

• A granular drainage liner 600mm thick was estimated within 30% of the impoundment 
footprint to facilitate solution recovery and tailings consolidation; 

• A diversion channel was assumed around the TSF perimeter.  This was based on an 
estimate and was not based on site specific rainfall, peak runoff calculations; and 

• Freeboard was estimated at 2m and did not consider any water balance or wave run-up 
calculations. 

17.5 Infrastructure 
The following additional infrastructure items will be required for the Project: 

• Upgrading of the dirt road from El Resbalón to the Project site.  A ford crossing a stream 
(near El Resbalón) for heavy loads (mainly during construction) will be constructed.  
Construction of a proper access road will be required from nearby El Motaje to the 
Project site (approximately 1km);

Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

• Construction of a suitable bridge crossing to provide access from the underground mine 
portal (south of arroyo) to the mill area (north of arroyo).  This bridge will need to be 
able to take the weight of loaded mining trucks.  It will also provide access for other 
traffic; 

• Construction of a power line from the 115kV line, part of the National Powerline Net, 
located approximately 3km to the west of the Project, and a step-down substation; 

• Site fencing (safety and security); 

• Water supply wells and water distribution (for process and fire fighting requirements); 

• Sewage treatment facility; 

• Waste disposal facility; 

• Fuel storage facility (tanks within a bermed and lined containment area); 

• Underground decline waste storage area (to store waste rock before use as backfill); 

• Small quarry (to provide backfill material for the mining operations); 

• Gatehouse (security); 

• Construction camp (during construction period); 

• Administration building (with communications/office equipment); 

• Changehouse/mine dry; 

• Maintenance workshop and warehouse; and 

• Assay laboratory facility. 

17.6 Project Implementation 
The Project would proceed through a Pre-Feasibility Study and a Feasibility Study and 
depending on successful outcomes at each stage a formal decision to go ahead with Project 
Implementation would be made.  Given successful project financing, the Project would 
commence with various work contracts arranged, including EPCM contracts for the project 
infrastructure and the processing plant.  A mine contractor would be retained for mine 
development.  Construction contracts would include: construction camp; access road upgrading; 
site road development; arroyo bridge construction; power line and substation; water supply; 
general site earthworks; tailings dam; site buildings; communications; and other facilities. 

The timing for starting development of the mine access in relation to infrastructure and plant 
construction would be developed in detail at the Feasibility Study stage.  A plant could be 
constructed and operational by the first half of 2012 (with a milling tank leach option). 

This allows for six months to undertake further metallurgical testwork and to prepare a Pre-
Feasibility Study.  The execution of detailed Feasibility Study suitable for raising project finance 
could be expected to take 6 to 8 months.  It is therefore possible that project approval could be 
obtained by early 2011.  Project execution from the start of design through to plant 
commissioning would typically take 12 to 15 months depending on equipment supply and other 
constraints, with production starting towards the end of the first half of 2012.

No major constraints are envisaged with project execution and plant related to topography, plant 
access or climatic conditions, although certain construction work components will need to be 
appropriately scheduled around the annual rainy season period. 

17.7 Markets 
Gold markets are mature and with reputable smelters and refiners located throughout the world.  
Demand is presently high with prices for gold showing a remarkable increase during the past 
year-London Final price averaged just under US$973/oz for 2009.  Recent spot market prices for 
gold have been generally above US$1,050/oz. 

Markets for doré are readily available.  Nayarit will be able to ship its doré to any of a variety of 
refiners. 

17.8 Contracts  
Nayarit is not currently in production and has no operational sales contracts in place at the 
moment.  Should the project go into production, an agreement for the refining of silver and gold 
doré will be put into place.  For the purpose of this PEA, the cost of refining has been estimated. 

Certain drilling activities are anticipated, and drilling contracts may be put into place in the near 
future. 

17.9 Environmental Considerations and Permitting 
The Animas/Del Norte project is developed under norms and regulations that SEMARNAT 
addresses under the Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente 
(LGEEPA, which is the acronym in Spanish of the General Law for Ecological Equilibrium and 
Environmental Protection).  Given the nature of the project, an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) is required to comply with this Environmental Law.  Nayarit Gold and its 
consultants are in progress preparing the EIA, progress is advanced, and it is expected to be 
submitted in mid-March 2010. 

17.9.1 Closure Cost Estimate 
The conceptual mine site Closure Cost Estimate (CCE) is based on the available information 

generated at scoping level.  The areas considered in the CCE are the following: 

• Mine, which covers site clean-up, entrances, yards and rock dump areas;  

• Plant and infrastructure, covering site clean-up, demolition and decontamination of 
machinery and equipment, buildings, roads, power lines, pipelines and other issues such 
as miscellaneous tools; 

• Tailings, which include encapsulation, site rehabilitation, and monitoring; and 

• The PEA level cost estimate was developed for all the facilities and projected use of 
areas.  SRK has estimated that the cost would be about $1.6million, plus a 30% 
contingency of $0.5million, totaling $2.1million. 

17.9.2 Remediation 
The CCE was developed making the following assumptions: the TSF will cover an area of 15ha, 
processing plant 4ha, waste rock area 1ha, office and workshops 0.7ha, and roads 1 hectare.  A

contractor will be in charge of the closure plan operation, and only underground mine works will 
be developed.  No waste rock will be left on surface, and no town site will be developed. 

17.9.3 Closure Cost Model 
The model of the conceptual level cost estimate was developed for the areas above mentioned.  
Costing assumptions considered that the TSF will be encapsulated with materials covering 1m 
thick.  Some cost for monitoring, mainly water near the TSF, are included in the CCE.  
According to the mine plan, closure activities will start in year 2015, and management costs are 
also included.  Finally, cyanide decontamination cost of machinery and equipment is included. 

A contingency was estimated to be 30% of the total closure costs and was provided to reflect 
uncertainties associated with area dimensions and assumptions made; topography and 
topographic accuracy; the accuracy of available data; operating changes during the life of mine 
affecting economic structure of the project; site specific contractor costs; and 
escalation/variations in contractor unit prices. 

17.9.4 Reclamation 
Specific reclamation objectives for the Animas/Del Norte project will include: 

• Reduction of long-term erosion potential through use of engineered slopes and best 
management practices (e.g., achievement of a natural land form); 

• Management of surface water run-on in a manner that promotes clean diversion of 
surface water and reduces the potential for erosion in reclaimed areas; and 

• Placement of appropriate soil cover materials or amendments on the tailings and stockpile 
facilities to achieve dust control objectives. 

At present, the reclamation and closure cost estimate is a budgetary figure of $2.1million.  Most 
of the numbers in the estimate presented in the cost model are given in Mexican Pesos, except as 
otherwise indicated.  The exchange rate used is MX$12.5 per US$1.  SRK has estimated that the 
cost would be about $1.6million, plus a 30% contingency of $0.5million, totaling $2.1million.  
This estimate will vary based on the final Mine Plan of Operations and the conceptual level 
closure plan for the property. 

17.10 Taxes and Royalties 
The current Animas/Del Norte underground mine plan is not on ground to which any royalties or 
net profits interest apply.  The Animas/Del Norte area is located within the El Magnifico F II 
mining concession (not Orion). 

17.11 Capital Costs 
PEA level capital costs were estimated using in-house database information.  Capital costs for 
the mill (counter-current decantation and MC circuit etc.) based on recently completed studies 
and projects in Mexico and Central America were applied.  The capital costs presented are to a 
PEA level of accuracy and are expected to be within ±40%.  Given the preliminary nature of the 
study, a contingency of 30% has been applied to all capital costs to account for exclusions in the 
estimate.  All costs are in 4Q 2009 US dollars. 

LoM capital costs are shown in Table 17.11.1.  Initial capital is estimated to be US$35million.  
An additional US$20million is sustaining capital, of which US$14million will be attributed to

underground mine development, will be required.  LoM capital will therefore be about 
US$56million.

17.11.1 Mining 
Initial mine capital; estimated to be US$2million is minimal given that Nayarit will contract 
mining functions.  Sustaining capital will consist mostly of capitalized development costs, which 
will also be performed by contract miners.

17.11.2 Processing 
Process plant capital, shown in Table 17.11.3 is estimated to be US$19million.  This value has 
been estimated using as a basis, other similar plants currently built or planned in Mexico and 
Latin America.   

Given the currently anticipated short mine life, there is no provision for ongoing capital.

17.11.3 Tailings Storage Facility 
A PEA level cost estimate was developed for the slurried TSF option.  Costing assumptions 
included the following: 

• Engineering was estimated to be 1% of the total construction costs; 

• EPCM costs were estimated to be 5% of the total construction costs; 

• Owner costs were estimated to be 5% of the total construction costs; 

• Closure costs were allowed for as part of a separate estimate (as environmental costs); 

• Pumping and piping costs were considered to be included with the process operating 
costs; and 

• Contingency was estimated to be 30% of the total construction costs and was provided to 
reflect uncertainties associated with: 

- Level of design and assumptions, 
- Inclusion of only high level costing items, 
- Topography and topographic accuracy, 
- Additional embankment height required to account for tailings slope and freeboard, 
- Seepage recovery within the embankment, including solution management, in 

addition to seepage monitoring wells, 
- Solution recovery (barges, pumps, etc) within the impoundment; 
- Site specific contractor costs, and 
- Escalation/variations in contractor unit prices. 

SRK has estimated that the LoM capital costs would be about US$3.6million, construction and 
engineering costs of US$0.9million, plus a 30% contingency of US$1.3million.  Costs are shown 
in Table 17.11.4.

17.11.4 Infrastructure 
Infrastructure costs, totaling about US$9million are typical for an operation of this magnitude 
and location.  No sustaining costs are anticipated, given relatively short mine life of the Project.

17.11.5 Owner's costs 
Owner's costs include about US$4.3million in initial capital and US$2million for mine closure 
and reclamation at the end of the mine life in year 5. 

The estimate includes provisions to complete a Feasibility Sudy, and supporting investigations 
such as water/hydrogeology, environmental baseline, and geotechnical studies.  Also included 
are provisions associated with detailed engineering and construction activities along with first 
fills, spares and commissioning costs.  A small provision for corporate overhead allocation to the 
project is also included.

17.11.6 Payback 
Payback of the initial capital investment will occur during the second quarter of the third year of 
operation.   

17.12 Operating Costs 
PEA level capital costs were estimated using in-house database information.  Capital costs for 
the mill (counter-current decantation and MC circuit etc) based on recently completed studies 
and projects in Mexico and Central America were applied.  The capital costs presented are to a 
PEA level of accuracy and are expected to be within ±40%.  Given the preliminary nature of the 
study, a contingency of 30% has been applied to all capital costs to account for exclusions in the 
estimate.  All costs are in 4Q 2009 US dollars.   

LoM operating costs are shown in Table 17.12.1.  Over the LoM, operating costs will be about 
US$65/t of ore milled.  These costs do not include the cost of mine development, as these costs 
are capitalized.

17.12.1 Mining 
Mine operating costs will average US$32.57/t-ore over the LoM.  An additional US$8.57/t-ore is 
attributed to development costs.  Development costs include: 

• 3,479m of main ramp development at US$1,050/m; 
• 5,677m of stope access at US$950/m; and 
• 600m of ventilation raises at US$1,800/m.

Power costs are shown in Table 17.12.6.  Power consumption is estimated given the current 
understanding of the ore characteristics as described elsewhere in this report as well as other 
existing operations in Mexico. 

The estimate is based upon a power rate of US$0.08/kWh to be purchased from the local utility.

17.13 Economic Analysis 
The financial results of this report are based upon work performed by SRK and has been 
prepared on an annual basis.  All costs are in Q4 2009 US constant dollars. 

17.13.1 Model Inputs 
The financial model, shown in Exhibit 17.1, is presented on an unleveraged, pre-tax basis.  
Assumptions used are discussed in detail throughout this report and are summarized in Table 
17.13.1. 



Nayarit Gold Inc.  17-26 
Orion Project, Del Norte Zone   NI 43-101 Preliminary Assessment 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 5, 2010

Table 17.13.1:  Model Parameters 
Description  Value 
Mine Life 5 years 
Ore Milled 1,182kt 
Gold Recovered 98koz 
Silver Recovered 8,929koz 
Gold-Equivalent  246koz 
Gold Price US$900/oz 
Silver Price US$15/oz 
Income Tax 30% 
Discount Rate 8% 

 

A 2 to 3-year pre-production period is required to allow for permitting, detailed engineering, and 
due diligence/financing.  The mine will have an estimated life of five years given the mineable 
resource described in this report and the assumed 750t/d nominal production rate. 

Market price of assumptions of US$900/oz gold and US$15.00/oz silver provide the basis for 
projected revenues.  Refinery costs are assumed at US$3.00/oz for gold and US$0.20/oz for 
silver.  Transportation and insurance of doré is estimated at US$1.00/oz (Au and Ag). 

17.13.2 LoM Plan & Project Financials 
The base case economic analysis results, shown in Table 17.13.2, indicate an NPV of 
US$35million at an 8% discount rate with an IRR of 38%.  Payback will be in 2.25 years from 
the start of production. 

The following provides the basis of the SRK LoM plan and economics: 
• Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources are included; 
• A mine life of 5 years, at a designed plant throughput rate of 750t/d; 
• An overall average metallurgical recovery rate of 92% Au and 88% Ag over the LoM; 
• A cash operating cost of US$320.27/AuEq ounce;  
• Capital costs of US$56million, comprised of initial capital costs of US$35million, 

sustaining capital over the LoM of US$21million; 
• Mine closure cost, included in the above estimates is US$2million; and 
• The analysis does not include provision for salvage value.

17.13.3 Sensitivity 
Sensitivity analysis for key economic parameters is shown in Table 17.13.1.  The project is 
slightly more sensitive (about 10%) to market price given the relatively small resource and the 
inherent high costs associated with underground mining.  The project exhibits virtually similar 
sensitivities to capital and operating costs.

18 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 21) 
It is SRK's opinion that the resource model described in this report can be used for preliminary 
economic evaluation, and is appropriate for assessing project viability, and determining suitable 
advancement of the Project.  The PEA results justify advancing the Project to a Pre-Feasibility 
Study. 

18.1 Field Surveys 
From 2005 to 2009, Nayarit has conducted surface mapping, surface sampling, diamond drilling 
and RC drilling on the Project.  The surface mapping and sampling was focused on the local 
mineralized structures and surrounding rock types.  The results of this work delineated 
anomalous gold and silver zones along WNW, NW and E-W striking veins zone traceable for up 
to 500m.  These structures have been drill tested by 254 diamond core holes, 10 reverse 
circulation holes and 8 holes started with reverse circulation and finished with core drilling by 
Nayarit Gold on the Orion Project.  A total of 61,839.6.m of drilling have been completed to 
date.  The drillholes were carefully logged, sampled and analyzed using ICP-MS, AA and Au 
fire assay methods.  The exploration work conducted by Nayarit Gold meets current industry 
standards.  The exploration drilling program has been well planned and carried out in a prudent 
and careful manner.  All drill core and RC chip logging and sampling has been conducted by 
trained and professional personnel.  Nayarit Gold has made a concerted effort to ensure good 
sample quality and has maintained a careful chain of custody and ensured sample security from 
the drill rig to the assay laboratory. 

18.2 Analytical and Testing Data 
SRK is of the opinion that the analytical work performed by ALS-Chemex on the Project was of 
high precision and accuracy, and suitable for use in resource estimation.  The assay methodology 
is of industry standard, and is the recommended analytical technique for gold and silver analysis.  
Nayarit Gold has implemented an industry standard QA/QC analysis of duplicate check assays 
on drill core since the 2005 drilling program.  This consisted of three 1/2 core field duplicates for 
every 100th sample and insertion of blank material for every three out of 100 samples.  Certified 
reference standards were also inserted at a frequency of four out of every 100 samples.  Duplicate 
analyses were conducted on existing pulps selected by a SRK for approximately 1% of the 
sample database.  The results of the QA/QC analysis verified the original assay results and 
indicated no assay bias. 

In order to further develop the Animas/Del Norte project further metallurgical testwork to 
develop and confirm the potential treatment options is required, including the development of 
costs to pre-feasibility level. 

18.3 Exploration Conclusions 
The drilling programs adequately define the zones of gold and silver mineralization and are 
acceptable to support the resource estimation that is the subject of this report.  The deposits 
remains open in several directions and further infill/step out drilling is warranted to better 
delineate the limits of mineralization.  Exploration potential in other portions of the currently 
held concessions is considered excellent, and SRK is of the opinion that the delineation of 
additional resources is likely.

18.4 Resource Estimation 
The resource estimation is based on information from 272 holes for a total of 61.839.6m.  Grade 
solids models were constructed for the three resource areas based on 0.30g/t Au equivalent.  The 
model blocks are based on a parent cell of 3m x 3m x 3m in the x, y, z directions, respectively, 
sub-blocked to 1.5m x 1.5m x 1.5m.  All block grade estimates were conducted using 1.5m 
downhole composites (and 3m downhole composites for the Animas/Del Norte-Pantaleona 
model area external to the grade solids).  An inverse distance weighing algorithm (ID3) was 
employed to the gold and silver grade estimation.  The results of the resource estimation 
provided a CIM classified Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource.  The quality of 
the drilling and data is very good and the Mineral Resource was classified mainly according to 
the general drillhole spacing. 
18.5 Other Relevant Information 
The scope of this study was intended for the use of Nayarit to further the evaluation of the 
Animas/Del Norte Project by providing a mineral resource estimate, a classification of resources 
in accordance with the CIM classification system and a preliminary assessment of the economic 
evaluation of the property. 

Some additional drilling is anticipated, and metallurgical, hydrogeological, and environmental 
studies have been undertaken, or are still in progress.  Geotechnical and other studies could be 
implemented in the near future.  Current studies show that the Animas/Del Norte deposit can be 
mined by conventional underground mining methods, and processed by well-established 
processing techniques. 

The Project is not remote, as readily available services (including power) and land transportation 
routes are close to the Project site.  Based on field observations, available geologic data, 
metallurgical testwork, hydrogeology study, preliminary tailings study, available environmental 
data and other PEA work, SRK's opinion is that there are no serious flaws to the Project. 

The objectives moving forward should be focused on progressing the project through a Pre-
Feasibility Study, and pending positive economic results at that stage, onto a Feasibility Study. 

18.5.1 Opportunities 
The following opportunity aspects are noted: 

• The ore material is relatively easy to process by alternative different treatment methods, 
which can be brought closer to optimization at the pre-feasibility stage; 

• The feed grade from underground mining is quite high at almost a gold equivalent grade 
of 7g/t (AuEq), and can support reasonably high operating costs; and 

• The relatively short LoM at five years can potentially justify the use second-hand plant 
and equipment (or use light duty equipment with limited life) to reduce capital costs. 

18.5.2 Risks 
The following risk aspects are noted: 

• The limited minable resources available and relatively short LoM;

• The optimum treatment method does not clearly stand out, and could possibly be affected 
by additional mineable resources incorporated into the mine plan; and 

• The presence of cyanide soluble copper, which could result in higher reagent 
consumptions, higher operating costs and have possible affects on precious metal 
recoveries.

19 Recommendations (Item 22) 
19.1 Recommended Work Programs 
SRK acknowledges that a significant amount of exploration and development work has been 
conducted on the Orion project concessions, and results to date warrant additional work efforts, 
which generally summate to advancing the Project to a Pre-Feasibility Study.  The following 
work programs are recommended: 

Exploration and Development 

• Construct 3-D geologic models, using existing logged lithology data for the Animas/Del 
Norte-Pantaleona, La Estrella and San Francisco areas; 

• Conduct additional geochemical and mapping studies on surrounding concessions, in 
order to rank and define drill targets to potentially increase resources; 

• Conduct infill drilling to extend known mineralization up-dip in the Animas/Del Norte-
Pantaleona area; and 

• Implement more rigorous QA/QC protocols for future sampling programs, and actively 
monitor results. 

Geotechnical - Mining 
SRK recommends that a minimum of three core holes be drilled using a triple tube sampling 
barrel for geotechnical characterize the in-situ materials.  Geotechnical logging should be carried 
out at the drill rig by a trained geotechnical engineer or geologist prior to boxing and 
transportation of the core.  The following parameters are recommended to be recorded for each 
core run: 

• General lithology; 

• Core recovery and rock quality designation (RQD); 

• ISRM (1978) intact rock strength and weathering indices; 

• Discontinuity frequency and characteristics; and 

• Discontinuity Orientation. 

Core samples should be collected during the program for laboratory strength testing at a 
frequency of approximately 30m, or more frequently where significant rock type or strength 
changes are encountered.  A laboratory testing program consisting of uniaxial and triaxial 
compressive strengths will be necessary to characterize intact rock strengths. 

Geotechnical - Tailings 

SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the pre-feasibility level TSF 
design:  

• Trade-off studies.  Alternate slurried TSF locations could be considered as part of the 
next level of evaluation;

Orion_Del_Norte_NI_43-101_PEA_189000.040_MG_021.doc  

• Containment requirements.  The current design has assumed that a synthetically lined 
seepage barrier will be required and this should be confirmed from a permitting and 
environmental risk perspective; 

• Detailed topographic survey.  A topographic survey of the area should be performed to an 
accuracy level of +/- 2m where necessary to fill in to that level of detail.  The area should 
be sufficiently large to account for the diversion channels and any borrow areas; 

• Field investigations.  Field investigations should be performed for the tailings 
impoundment area, including the characterizing of the embankment foundation 
conditions and potential borrow areas.  These investigations would include a field 
reconnaissance to confirm the geology and any geologic hazards within and adjacent to 
the impoundment area; a geotechnical program including boreholes along the 
embankment centerline, and test pits within the impoundment area; and the hydrogeology 
of the impoundment area; 

• Tailings characterization.  Laboratory test work should be done to confirm tailings design 
assumptions, such as the densities and water contents; 

• Sideslope configuration.  As part of the conceptual study, sideslope configurations were 
assumed.  Site specific peak ground accelerations should be established for the site, so 
that a pseudo-static stability analysis could be done to confirm the sideslopes required 
from a stability perspective; 

• Pre-feasibility level engineering.  Perform additional analyses to support a pre-feasibility 
level study for the water balance, slope stability, etc.  As the water balance, and process 
water available for makeup water, is sensitive to the assumptions regarding precipitation 
and storm events, this should be evaluated in more detail; and 

• The freeboard and diversion channel assumptions should be confirmed. 
Hydrogeology 
SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the pre-feasibility level 
hydrogeology program: 

• Additional packer isolated airlift testing from individual intervals in three new 
geotechnical holes proposed to be drilled to determine the hydraulic properties of rocks 
and structures that may be encountered within the underground mine footprint to pre-
feasibility requirements (total 16 testing intervals); 

• Installation of 3 standpipe piezometers in these geotechnical holes for long term 
groundwater monitoring; 

• Groundwater sample collection and analysis as part of the planned geotechnical (and 
other) future drilling activities; and 

• Numerical 3-D hydrogeological modeling to estimate groundwater inflow rates to the 
proposed underground mine and potential dewatering requirements for the proposed 
underground mine, and associated environmental impacts.

Underground Mining 
SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the pre-feasibility level 
reserve estimation and mine design program: 

• Identify geotechnical regions for the economic portion of the mineralization based on the 
results of the geotechnical drilling program and re-logging of selected core drillholes; 

• Determine maximum excavation sizes for development (supported) and longhole stoping 
(unsupported) for each geotechnical region; 

• Update mine design based on geotechnical regions; 

• Optimize development layout; 

• Detailed backfill design including a trade-off study between CRF and paste fill. Note the 
paste fill option would significantly reduce the size of the tailings impoundment but 
would increase both the capital and operating cost of the backfill system; 

• Ventilation system design; 

• Mine dewatering system design; and 

• Underground electrical infrastructure system design. 
Processing 
The investigations undertaken so far are indicated only to be to a preliminary indicative nature 
and further investigations are required to investigate the forecast capital and operating costs in 
further detail and to complete a more detailed evaluation into the optimum process route for the 
Animas/Del Norte material.  This may be influenced by possible increase in the amount of feed 
material available to the plant. 

In order to further develop the Animas/Del Norte project a Pre-Feasibility is required.  This 
would involve further metallurgical testwork to develop and confirm the potential treatment 
options including the development of costs to an accuracy of +/- 20 to 25%. 

SRK recommends that the following be performed as part of the pre-feasibility mineral 
processing program: 

• Conduct additional process testwork to adequately assess process amenability to pre-
feasibility level standards; 

• Further investigations to optimize plant design and operations, specifically use of 
alternative oxidants or additives to possibly improve leach kinetics, particularly for silver; 

• Preliminary testwork undertaken into heap leach recovery at coarse crushed ore has been 
undertaken mainly in basic bottle roll tests with only one low-grade sample tested in a 
percolation column test.  Recoveries around 65% have been indicated.  However, the 
possible treatment of material at finer crush sizes (with agglomeration) to possibly 
improve recoveries (without the incurred expense of milling and tank leaching) has been 
proposed; 

• Settling and filtration tests (for solid liquid separation to produce a clear solution from 
which silver and gold are precipitated);

• Further investigation into gravity recovery options and treatment of gravity concentrate; 

• Further investigations into flotation performance to investigate grade recovery data and 
ore variability.  This would include batch and locked cycle testwork; 

• Investigations of ore variability and continuous closed circuit tests (determination of 
build-up of metals or other products in recycled solids and solution streams); 

• Further investigations into flotation performance to investigate grade recovery data and 
ore variability.  This would include batch and locked cycle testwork; 

• Investigation of deportment and potential build up of copper in the solution circuit and 
the effect on reagent consumptions and precious metal recoveries; and 

• Investigation of recovery of cyanide associated with copper in the plant tails for possible 
recovery and reuse in the circuit could be investigated. 

General 

• Complete preparation of the EIA and submit to SEMARNAT in mid-March 2010; 

• Complete a Pre-Feasibility Study to further advance the Project; and 

• Conduct pre-feasibility level trade-off studies between heap leach, gravity, CCD and 
flotation processing, or a combination thereof, to optimize project economics.

21 Glossary 
21.1 Mineral Resources and Reserves 
21.1.1 Mineral Resources 
The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (December 2005).  
Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the 
Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated 
Resources as defined below. 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 

21.1.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined.

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.

Sedimentary: Pertaining to rocks formed by the accumulation of sediments, formed by the erosion of other rocks.   
Shaft: An opening cut downwards from the surface for transporting personnel, equipment, supplies, ore and 

waste.   
Sill: A thin, tabular, horizontal to sub-horizontal body of igneous rock formed by the injection of magma 

into planar zones of weakness.   
Smelting: A high temperature pyrometallurgical operation conducted in a furnace, in which the valuable metal 

is collected to a molten matte or doré phase and separated from the gangue components that 
accumulate in a less dense molten slag phase.   

Stope: Underground void created by mining.   
Stratigraphy: The study of stratified rocks in terms of time and space.

Executive Summary  

This report presents the results obtained in the different metallurgical studies ran on the three series of 

samples from Nayarit Gold, S.A. de C.V.  The description of the three series of samples is as follows: 

I. 5 Reject Samples: Dynamic Leaching 

II. 3 Drill Hole Samples (Free Au): Gravity Concentration (Knelson) and Dynamic Leaching 

III. 3 Drill Hole Samples: Bulk Flotation, Dynamic Leaching and SPI and BWI determination. 

The main objective in this study was to determine the sensitivity of the different samples to the processes 

described. 

I. Reject Samples:  

Four reject samples were received from Nayarit Gold, S.A. de C.V. and sent to this laboratory by Mr. Hall 

Stewart; with the purpose of performing a metallurgical study.  The following are the head assays:

Conclusions: 

1. The samples in general terms had good solubility with sodium cyanide. 

2. The greater extractions take place during the first 24 hours of treatment in the case of Au, while 

for Ag there has to be a longer leaching time to achieve the greater extractions (72 to 96 hours).

3. The use of oxidizers accelerates the dissolution of values of Au/Ag during the first hours of 

treatment (24 to 48 hours); however, at the end of the test the extractions obtained render similar 

results with or without the use of oxidizers. 

4. The reagent consumption was moderate for three of the four samples (672592, 674228 and 

674229), as shown in the table above. 

5. Sample 673854 showed a greater consumption of reagent, due to the high head grade. 

6. The initial pH handled was 11 to 11.5; however, it was notorious that hours after it fell abruptly to 

10.7, so it was constantly monitored. 

7. It is very important to mention that samples 672592, 673854 and 674228 presented difficulty to 

settle. 

8. Sample 339396 shows good results to leaching with NaCN, in spite of the low head grades.  

9. The consumption of NaCN is moderate (1.65 kg/t), as well as for CaO (2.92 kg/t). 

Recommendation: 

1. For sample 673854, we recommend running more tests using concentrations higher than >3000 

ppm, given its high grade of Ag. 

II. Three Hole Samples (Coarse Au) 

Three hole samples were received from Nayarit Gold, S.A. de C.V., sent to this laboratory by Mr. Hall 

Stewart; with the purpose of performing a metallurgical study.  The following are the Head Grades of the 

different holes.

The results obtained determined that none of the holes has coarse Au, which typically presents problems 

when leached with NaCN. 

Gravity Concentration - Leaching Tests 

For each hole sample a gravity concentration test was run, using for that a Knelson concentrator, with the 

intention of determining the sensitivity of the samples to a pre-concentration process of Au/Ag values. 

Knelson tails were leaching with sodium cyanide.

Sample 673854 (Addendum)  

Initially this sample was leached but the extraction of Ag was low (81%), probably due to the high ore 

grade (4770 g/t). The aim was to determine the sensitivity of the sample to a Knelson concentration.  

The amount of sample had already been exhausted during the performance of the dynamic leaching 

tests, therefore the client provided more sample for the running of the new tests. 

With the purpose of confirming the Head Grade, the new sample was analyzed again.

Conclusions 

1. In the Knelson concentration tests, the best recovery was achieved for Au.  

2. The hole sample 677962 was the one with the best concentration out of the three. 

3. The leaching of the residues from the Knelson tests showed good solubility for Au and Ag; 

however, the reagent consumption was high, very possibly due to the fact that a high 

concentration of cyanide was used (3 g/L). 

4. Overall recoveries combining both processes were favourable for the three hole samples.  

Recommendations 

1. The samples show good response to the concentration with a Knelson concentrator, so it would 

be convenient to run more tests to optimize results. 

2. The consumptions of NaCN in the Knelson tails leaching are high; however, these can be 

reduced/optimized if we run tests with smaller concentrations. 

3. It is advisable to carry out a Dynamic Leaching study, not going through a Knelson concentration. 

III. Three Hole Samples

Conclusion 

1. In Flotation Tests, it is not necessary to have a fine particle size (75μ). A K80 =100M (150μm) 

provided good results for Holes OR-09-184 and OR-09-186, while a K80 = 150M (106μm) was 

better for Hole OR-09-183. 

2. The results obtained in flotation show high grades of Au/Ag in the concentrates; the recoveries 

were favourable as well. 

3. The leaching of concentrates had a good response, however the consumption of reagents got to 

be very high: 

                                                NaCN: ~9 to 16 kg/t      CaO: ~6.5 to 12.5 kg/t  

4. The maximum Au/Ag extractions are obtained after practically a leaching time of 72 hours.  96 

hours are not necessary. 

5. The use of oxidizer importantly increases the extraction of Ag (~8%); however the consumption of 

NaCN is higher, increasing from 25 to 40%; while the consumption of CaO falls up to 50% in 

general terms.  For Au, there is practically no variation.  

6. We recommend not using oxidizers.  The final results of the leaching of concentrates were: 

7. The global recoveries combining the Flotation-Leaching processes are very favourable for the 

three hole samples:

Recommendations 

1. Flotation: we suggest performing more tests to optimize parameters, as it is possible to improve 

degrees of concentrates and recoveries.

2. The performance of a cyclic test at laboratory level is recommendable to know the relation in 

weights and grades of all stages of the circuit and the performance of the Mass Balance.  

3. To perform Knelson concentration tests, with the purpose of observing the amenability of the hole 

samples to this process, so as to obtain a pre-concentration. 

4. For the stage of Leaching of Flotation Concentrates, we recommend running further assays using 

a greater NaCN Concentration >5000 ppm. As the head grades are high because they come from 

a concentrate.   

Grindability Tests 

Bond Ball Mill Index (BWi) 

The tests to determine the Bond Index (BWI) were performed with a cut mesh of 100 (150 μ) for the three 

hole samples.  The results of the test are summarized in the following table.
