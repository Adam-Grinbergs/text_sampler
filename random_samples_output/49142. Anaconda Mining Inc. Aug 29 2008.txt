1.0   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Mr. Lewis Lawrick, President of Anaconda Mining Inc. (Anaconda), a Toronto based, publicly 
trading company which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol "ANX", has 
retained Michael Easdon (Reg. Prof. Geologist) to prepare a report in compliance with the 
requirements of National Instrument 43-101F1 which describes the work performed on the San 
Gabriel Iron Project, Chile, and the results which have been obtained to date. This work was 
designed to explore for, and if warranted, to develop one or more potential mineral deposits 
within the San Gabriel Iron Project area, Region II, Chile. The author has also been asked to 
review the 2008-2009 exploration program and comment on its appropriateness for future 
development of the project, if he believes that the property continues to be of merit and warrants 
continuing exploration. 
 
The San Gabriel Property is located on the western side of the Coast Range and approximately 
60 kms to the north of town of Diego de Almagro and approximately 70 kms northeast of the port 
town of Chañaral. The property lies approximately 6 kms west southeasterly of the Teresa del 
Colmo and 30 kms southwest of the Altamira and Franken (IOCG) Iron Oxide-Copper-(Gold) 
deposits (mines). The San Gabriel Property is approximately centered on UTM coordinates 
7,031,000N and 405,500E or (Lat. 26o 50' 20" and Long. 69o 57' 04') at the extreme south of the 
Province of Antofagasta, Region II, Chile. Access to the project from Copiapo (210 kms to the 
south) is via paved highway and all-weather gravel roads. Housing facilities are not readily 
available and a camp and facilities will have to be constructed at such time as an operation may 
be planned. To date no significant water source has been detected within the property. However, 
there is the possibility that water may be purchased in the future from one, or more, mining 
companies that might be shutting down their operations in the future. A major power line is 
located within 15 kms to the west of the property. Rail facilities may be available within 15 kms to 
the east to transport any mined product, and the port town of Chañaral may have suitable 
facilities for loading and shipping any mined product. Supplies can be obtained from Copiapo, 
Antofagasta and Santiago as needed. Copiapo and other nearby towns have well trained and 
experienced miners and a more than adequate workforce is available. 
 
On June 15th, 2007, Anaconda entered into an Option to Purchase Agreement with the owner of 
the mining concessions which underlie the San Gabriel Property. The Option to Purchase 
comprises escalating payments to a total of US $2,400,000 over 49 months; there are no 
minimum work commitments. The initial payment of US $20,000 was made in June 2007 and the 
second payment of US $45,000 was made in June 2008. Once the full option payment price has 
been paid Anaconda will own the San Gabriel Property free and clear with no over-riding 
royalties due on production. Anaconda has also acquired 22 exploration concessions and 
currently controls a total of 4,700 hectares.   
 
Anaconda completed the first phase of drilling at the San Gabriel Project in May 2008 and 
anticipates initiating the second phase of exploration and development in the forth quarter of 
2008.   
 
To date, and since inception (May, 2007), a total of approximately US $3,100,000 has been 
spent at and on behalf of the San Gabriel Project.   
 
Prior to the acquisition of the San Gabriel Property by Anaconda, the property had been part of a 
larger package of ground held by Rio Tinto and which included the Teresa del Colmo specularite-



  2

copper (IOCG) mine. Drill sites and occasional piles of drill cuttings (with magnetite) at the San 
Gabriel Property attest to the fact that they were exploring within the area, and that apparently 
they had not discovered the copper bearing targets for which they were looking.  
 
During the period September-October, 2007, Anaconda drilled 5 diamond drill holes some of 
which intersected significant intervals of magnetite bearing material in the San Gabriel Zone. In 
November, 2007 Anaconda contracted Argali Geofisica to conduct a detailed magnetometer 
survey across the property. This survey served to outline the three principal zones drilled to date 
– the San Gabriel (Main), Esperanza and Antonia zones. This work also outlined a number of 
other magnetically anomalous zones which have yet to be tested. In January, 2008, Anaconda 
initiated a major drilling campaign which allowed for the delineation of Indicated Resources at the 
San Gabriel and Esperanza Zones and an Inferred Resource at the Antonia Zone. A total of 
17,568 meters of Reverse Circulation (71 holes) and 2,190.95 meters of Diamond Drilling (11 
holes) were drilled between September 2007 and May, 2008.   
 
Anaconda took four (1.5 tonnes each) bulk samples from an outcropping portion of the 
Esperanza Zone which samples were used to initiate very preliminary bulk scale metallurgical 
tests. This preliminary test work, which is now not considered to be representative of the bulk of 
the Esperanza deposit, suggests that the near surface material has a high hematite content, as 
well as a high phosphorous content. Preliminary Davis Tube testwork on drill hole cuttings at the 
Esperanza Zone suggests that the magnetite content increases to 50 – 60% within 10 meters of 
the surface, and that the phosphorous content decreases significantly at the same time. 
 
 Davis Tube tests on samples taken from the San Gabriel and Esperanza Zones suggest that at 
a -325 mesh grind the potential to produce a high grade, low contaminant, concentrate is good. 
The Davis Tube tests also suggest that the magnetite recoveries for the San Gabriel Zone 
material will be on the order of 96-97%. Because of the depth to the top of the San Gabriel Zone, 
no bulk tests have been performed to determine if a high quality "lump" (+ 6mm) product is 
feasible; selected portions of high grade magnetite at the San Gabriel Zone should be cored to 
obtain samples which can be tested for the "lump" product suitability. The analyses that have 
been performed on the drill hole material (head), plus the analyses performed on the Davis Tube 
magnetite concentrates, for the San Gabriel Zone suggest that contaminants will not be a 
problem. Approximately 300 kgs of drill core taken from the San Gabriel Zone were recently sent 
to the SGA metallurgical test laboratory in Germany for in-depth metallurgical studies. 
  
The current exploration and development concept is based on the results of the recently 
completed work and studies. The emplacement of the magnetite mineralization at the San 
Gabriel Property appears to be associated with either, or a combination of, 
metasomatic/hydrothermal magnetite mineralizing events, or high level intrusions of magnetite 
magmas into Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous volcanics and volcaniclastic rocks to produce 
variably metasomatic magnetite bearing aureoles as roof pendants in the Lower Cretaceous 
dioritic rocks of the Coastal Batholith. The higher grade magnetite core occurs as a dike-fed 
lopolith at the San Gabriel Zone, and possibly at the Esperanza Zone. The resource at the 
Antonia Zone appears to be associated with a moderately dipping brecciated structural system.  
Geologic mapping/drilling is required to establish the nature of the other magnetically anomalous 
zones that were outlined during the magnetometric survey. The magnetite occurrences, which 
typically strike northwesterly, are structurally controlled, and in fact may be occurring within 
dilational zones  related to a through going fault system which is a splay off of, and to the east of, 
the principal Atacama Fault System which is located approximately 15 kilometers to the west.

There have been at least two pulses of intrusion, or deposition, of magnetite at the San Gabriel 
Zone and probably at the Esperanza Zone. The first pulse may be magmatic, and the second 
pulse the result of hydrothermal brecciation and the introduction of hydrothermal magnetite as 
breccia fill. The primary (igneous) magnetite is frequently very coarse grained and crystalline. 
Various types of magnetite occurrences have been defined including– a massive phase, a vein 
phase, a stockwork phase, and a disseminated magnetite phase developed in the 
metasomatised volcanoclastic country rock. Typically, the disseminated material carries grades 
less than 20% FeT and most probably does not comprise a potential resource. 
 
Luis Olcay and Martin Perez, SBX contracted geological consultants, estimated the resources for 
the San Gabriel Zone utilizing vertical cross sections developed at 100 meter intervals. The 
resources estimated for the Esperanza Zones utilized vertical cross sections developed 
principally at 30m intervals. Additionally level plans developed at 50 meter intervals were 
constructed for the San Gabriel Zone to confirm the geologic interpretation and the resource 
estimations. The resources estimated for the Antonia Zone are based on 3 angle holes drilled at 
100 meter spacing along the trend of the magnetic anomaly. The estimated resources developed 
for the San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia Zones were generated using a minimum 20% FeT 
cut off grade. The cross-sections were generated using a combination of assay and geologic 
data, and were developed at right angles to the approximate trends of the mineralization as 
indicated by the magnetic interpretation and the surface drilling, and to the extent available, 
utilizing detailed geologic mapping and bulldozer trenching (at Esperanza). Dr. Eduardo Magri, 
who is considered to the a "Qualified Person" per NI-43-101CP by virtue of his being a Fellow in 
the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (SAIMM), and by virtue of his statistical and 
ore reserve calculation expertise, verified that variograms prepared for the San Gabriel Zone 
confirmed that the drilling hole spacing utilized was suitable for the preparation of Indicated 
Resources. The author has verified the estimated resources utilizing independently generated 
cross sections and confirmed that the tonnages and grades of the San Gabriel Zone had been 
properly prepared and that they are verifiable. The author likewise confirmed that the Indicated 
and Inferred Resources estimated for the Esperanza and Antonia Zones, respectively, were 
properly done and that these estimates are reasonable and verifiable.

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  An 'Inferred Mineral 
Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be 
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but

not verified, geological and grade continuity. It can not be assumed that the Inferred Mineral 
Resources will be upgraded to an Indicated Resource as a result of continued exploration. 
Furthermore, it can not be assured that either the Indicated or the Inferred Mineral Resources will 
be converted to a "Reserve" category at such time as feasibility studies are initiated. 
 
The results of the check work (assays) that has been performed by the author, and along with 
that check work performed by Anaconda [the insertion of duplicates, assaying composited 
samples and comparing the results against the calculated grade, comparing the atomic 
absorption spectrographic (AAS) total iron assays vs. volumetric iron assays plus a significant 
number of external laboratory check (AAS) assays], confirms that the quality of the work that has 
been performed by the Geoanalitica Assay Laboratory is acceptable. The author, while confident 
that the quality of the check work that has been performed to date is acceptable, recommends 
that Anaconda utilize more rigorous Quality Assurance/Quality Control work, and that they initiate 
routinely inserting blanks and standards as well as duplicates in the sample stream.  
 
Based on the data that has been generated to date at the San Gabriel Project, the author 
concurs with Anaconda's recommendation that additional work is warranted at the San Gabriel 
Property, and that the San Gabriel Property continues to be a property of merit.  
 
Anaconda has budgeted $2.5 million for exploration at the San Gabriel Property for the Phase II 
Exploration program to be initiated in September, 2008. The Phase II program will include: 
approximately 10,000 meters of RC drilling for infill drilling at the San Gabriel Zone to allow for 
the categorization of Measured Resources, and to upgrade the resources and resource 
categorization at the Antonia Zone; drill 6 BQ core-size diamond drill holes to procure 
metallurgical samples at San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia Zones; additional metallurgical 
testing; and, to fund a preliminary economic assessment of the project. Geological mapping is 
planned for the Area 4 Sector with the objective of defining possible drill targets. Concurrently, 
the potential to sell a "lump" product in the Chilean market should also be researched 
 
This report is considered to be valid effective through to August 28th, 2008.

3.0    RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
The author has relied upon information provided by Mr. Antonio Ortuzar Jr., a Director of 
Anaconda and an attorney with Baker Mackenzie Chile. This information includes a description of 
the purchase option agreement into which Anaconda entered and on data that generally 
describes the concession dimensions and coordinates, exploration and mining rights, obligations, 
and that the appropriate option payments have been made to the underlying owner and that 
these payments are current. The author has relied upon information provided by Ms. Evelyn 
Rumman, SBX contracted mining property expert, which confirms that the appropriate 
concession payments have been properly paid and that the concessions which were filed for by 
Anaconda are current. The author is not competent to comment on the ownership of the mining 
rights. The author did not conduct an in-depth review of mineral titles and ownership; 
consequently, the author does not express an opinion on this subject. Furthermore, the author 
does not accept any responsibility for errors pertaining to this information. 
 
The author has further relied on reports and data provided by SBX which describe the work that 
SBX has performed on behalf of Anaconda at San Gabriel. The author has confirmed that the 
property has been variously tested by reverse circulation and diamond drilling, and that a bulk 
metallurgical sample was taken at the Esperanza Zone. The author has relied on reports which 
describe and interpret the geophysical work which was performed over the property. The author 
has relied on the metallurgical report and data that were prepared by Metallurgical Consultant 
Nelson Rojas. Mr. Rojas is a graduate Mining/Metallurgical Engineer who has worked for Cia 
Minera del Pacifico S.A. (CMP) and Cia de Acero del Pacifico S.A. (parent company of CMP) for

procedures and generated data, and has prepared statistical analyses confirming that the 
procedures being employed are correct and proper and that the analytical results that have been 
generated are reliable. Dr. Magri also reviewed and reported on the results and conclusions 
arrived at with regard to the SG tests that were conducted and on the relationships between the 
SG work and the Fe content of the San Gabriel resources. Dr. Magri also provided the 
variography which affirmed that the drill hole spacing used for the San Gabriel Sector deposit 
was statistically acceptable, and that it was appropriate to term the estimated resources in the 
San Gabriel Zone as being Indicated Resources where so stated.

4.0   PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
4.1  LOCATION: The San Gabriel is located in northern Chile, approximately 1,000 kilometers 
north of Santiago, the capital city of Chile, and about 210 kilometers north of the city of Copiapo. 
San Gabriel lies at an approximate mean elevation of 1,300 meters, and is approximately 
centered UTM coordinates 7,031,000N and 405,500E (Figure 4.1) at the extreme south of the 
Province of Antofagasta, Region III. The property is easily accessible by paved and maintained 
dirt road from Copiapo and through the town of Diego de Almagro, from Chañaral and from 
Taltal. Anaconda has created a number of access drill roads within the property. Figure 4.1 
details the access to property from Copiapo, Taltal and Chañaral. 
 
4.2 DESCRIPTION: The San Gabriel Property (Figure 4.1) comprises 2 separate groups of 
north-south, east-west oriented concessions which comprise a total area 4,700 hectares (Figure 
4.2). The westerly concession block consists of 9 concessions and covers 2,500 hectares. These 
concessions comprise the Cotorras (1-5 and 11-14) exploration concessions (Area 4) which were 
filed on behalf of Anaconda, and are held in the name of Evelyn Rumman, SBX land person. The 
easterly group of concessions which host the variously drilled San Gabriel, Esperanza and 
Antonia iron (magnetite) targets, comprise the optioned Cactus (1-3) mining concessions and the 
Gabriel 4-7 second tier concessions which are in the process of being converted to mining 
concessions. The originally optioned concessions (2,200 hectares) have been expanded by 
Anaconda's acquisition of the Cotorras 6-10 concessions. Figure 4.2 includes a table listing the 
coordinates of the limiting corners of the 2 blocks of concessions. 
 
The Cactus 1-3 mining concessions have been surveyed and monumented according to the 
Chilean mining regulations. The author identified certain monuments which attest to the fact that 
at least some of the concessions have been surveyed; however, the author has not verified, nor 
confirmed, that the concessions have been properly surveyed and monumented and has relied 
on Anaconda for this information. The author has relied on Evelyn Rumman, land status expert, 
for information with regard to the filing and current status of the concessions. Per the mining laws 
of Chile, mining concessions can be held in perpetuity provided that the appropriate annual 
payments have been made. There are no requirements that the property be put into production 
within some specified time frame. 
 
The total annual cost to maintain the San Gabriel concessions in good standing and as currently 
constituted is 174.6 UTMs, or 1/10 of a UTM/hectare. An UTM (Unidad Tributaria Mensual) as 
used in this section of this report (only) is inflation adjusted non-monetary unit which at May 27th, 
2008 was valued at CH $35,085. At May 27th, 2008, and March 31, 2008 when the appropriate 
payments were made to maintain the concessions in good standing through February, 2009, this 
cost was CH $6,125.600 or US $12,900 (at an exchange rate of CH $472.82/USD). In so far as 
the application for mining concessions process is an extended one, the property payments that 
apply to these concessions are variable and are also dependent on the proportion of the 
payment that is due to the end of the fiscal (mining property-wise) year, or March 30 of each 
year.

There are no other surface uses designated for the land which has been acquired for 
mining purposes at the San Gabriel Property, and the owner(s) to the mining rights 
therefore has first right to the use of the surface, subject to the appropriate permitting. The 
owner, and likewise Anaconda, has full legal rights to any water that may be found within 
the Property. 
 
4.3   OPTION/PURCHASE SUMMARY: Anaconda, through its Chilean subsidiary 
Inversiones La Veta Limitada, has acquired the rights to explore and develop San Gabriel 
as described in the following paragraph.  
 



  14

Anaconda entered into an Option to Purchase Agreement with Sr. Branko Luis Rodríguez 
Bakulic per public document dated June 15th, 2007 which has been properly and legally 
registered in Taltal. Anaconda agrees to acquire a 100% interest in the San Gabriel 
concessions in exchange for the scheduled cash payments described below for a total of 
US $2,400,000. Anaconda has up to 49 months in which to exercise its option, by which 
time, and as indicated below, it must exercise the option or the property reverts to Sr. 
Rodríguez.  
 
The author has reviewed the Option to Purchase document which is summarized below: 
 
• $20,000      - on signing; this amount has been paid;  
• $45,000      - payable by June 15, 2008;  
• $115,000    - payable by June 15, 2009; 
• $500,000    - payable by June 15, 2010;    
• $1,720,000 - payable by June 15, 2011; 
 
At the point that the total option-purchase payments have been made, 100% ownership of 
the property will be legally transferred to Anaconda. There are no over-riding or production 
royalties due subsequent to the final payment.  
 
The Option Agreement is further stated to convey water rights, as well as all surface 
easements that typically accrue to mining concessions in Chile; Sr. Rodriguez has 
furnished Anaconda with a general guaranty mortgage which assures against Mr. 
Rodriguez entering into any kind of outside agreement which might be prejudicial to 
Anaconda's interests. Sr. Rodriguez further agrees to transfer to Anaconda any additional 
concessions that he might apply for in the future and which fall within the defined area of 
interest, and which is defined by the perimeter of the property. The author understands 
that Anaconda reserves the right to transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of the acquired 
Rodriguez concessions and rights at any time to another person, provided the terms of the 
agreement continue to be met. 
  
Anaconda's land person has stated that the appropriate property payments have been 
made, and that the Sr. Rodriguez concessions are in good standing. The author has 
viewed copies of the documents that confirm that the appropriate property payments were 
made.  
 
Anaconda's Chilean land status expert has also confirmed (and as reviewed by the author) 
that the appropriate property payments have been made for the balance of the 
concessions that were acquired by Anaconda i.e. the Las Cotorras concessions. 
 
4.4.    ENVIRONMENTAL: There are no known environmental concerns at this time with 
regard to the work that has been performed at San Gabriel. Under Chilean environmental 
regulations, as they apply to mining exploration activities, Anaconda will not be required to 
initiate environmental permitting until it initiates actual development (as opposed to 
exploration) work on the property; it is anticipated that Anaconda will have no difficulty in 
obtaining the requisite work, and other permits, to develop and mine the property at the 
appropriate time. However, it is Anaconda's intention to initiate an environmental review 
with the objective of filing an Environmental Declaration. This Declaration will provide a  



  15

 
baseline on which to base permitting requirements in the future. Chile is a mining oriented 
country where mining is viewed favorably.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
5.1 ACCESS: Access from Santiago is by the paved Pan-American Highway for 
approximately 450 kms by 4-lane toll highway to La Serena and then by approximately 350 
kms of two-lane paved highway to Copiapo. The Atacama International airport, located 
approximately 40 kms NW of Copiapo, offers daily commercial flights by LanChile and Sky 
Airlines to Santiago and other Chilean cities. The San Gabriel Property can be easily 
accessed from Copiapo by road and is located approximately 210 road-kms from Copiapo 
(Figure 4.1). Access to the property (2.5 hours) is via paved Hwy 31 (becoming Ruta C-17) 
to Diego de Almagro (150 kms) and then a further 60 kms by well maintained dirt road. 
The highway is accessed from the center of Copiapo by heading SE through Copiapo 
towards Tierra Amarilla 8.7 kms and turning left (north) out of Copiapo and towards Inca 
de Oro/Diego del Almagro and continuing to San Gabriel. San Gabriel can also be 
accessed from Chañaral located 70 kms to the southwest, or from Taltal located 75 kms to 
the northeast (Figure 4.1). 
 
The Project area is located 20 kms to the west of the J.J. Perez train station and rail line 
which is operated by the FerroNor Company. The railroad runs between Calama where 
Codelco ships concentrates thru Diego de Almagro and to the Potrerillos Smelter located 
at El Salvador. Codelco operates the rail line which runs between El Salvador through 
Diego de Almagro and to Chañaral where Codelco has port facilities for shipping copper 
cathodes. 
 
5.2    CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY: The San Gabriel Project is located in the 
Atacama Desert where precipitation averages < 1 mm/mo and ranges from 0 – 5 mm. 
Vegetation is essentially nonexistent. The average annual temperature is on the order of 
15o C and ranges between 0o C to 20o C in the winter months and 10o C to 35o C during the 
summer months. Mining/processing activities can be performed on a year round basis.  
 
The San Gabriel property lies towards the western side of the Coast Ranges (Coastal 
Cordillera) and the Andean Cordillera to the east, and at a mean elevation of 
approximately 1,300 meters.  
 
5.3     LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE: The Central Chile power grid, 
which runs between Copiapo and Caleta Paposa, is located approximately 20 kms to the 
west of the property. Experienced mine and plant personnel can be sourced from Copiapo, 
Diego del Almagro and other parts of Chile. Minor amounts of water were encountered in 
Anaconda DD RSGA-14 (+70m) where the hole intersected a structure; however, a 
significant source of water has not been developed on the property.  There is the 
possibility that water may be purchased in the future from one, or more, mining companies 
that might be shutting down their operations in the future. Potable water will most likely 
have to be brought in from Diego de Almagro. Most major mine supplies can be obtained 
in Copiapo or trucked in from Santiago, La Serena, or Antofagasta. Codelco has port 
facilities at Chañaral located approximately 70 kms to the southwest. There is adequate 
ground within and around the San Gabriel concessions to easily accommodate any 
potential mining operation, including the plant site, waste and tailings dumps.

6.0   PROJECT HISTORY 
 
6.1   RECENT EXPLORATION: Circa 1997, Rio Tinto explored the area in and around 
what is now the San Gabriel Property as part of a regional exploration program conducted 
in northern Chile to test the Coastal Cordillera for potential large tonnage Iron Oxide 
Copper Gold (IOCG) with an emphasis on the discovery of significant copper targets. This 
work is generally known to have typically included magnetics and RC drilling.  
 
Evidence on the ground indicates that at least 3 of the Rio Tinto drill holes tested 
Anaconda's San Gabriel zone while the other holes appear to have tested the margins of 
the magnetic anomalies at the Esperanza and Antonia zones. Although the bulk of the drill 
cuttings from the past exploration have been removed or covered, some magnetite bearing 
cuttings were identified by Anaconda. The Rio Tinto drill hole locations have been 
identified, but the drill hole numbers were not evident. The Rio Tinto data has not been 
made available to Anaconda. 
 
6.2   PRIOR OWNERSHIP: The land that now comprises the San Gabriel Property was 
acquired by the underlying vendor, Mr. Branco Luis Rodriguez, in 2005 and 2006.  The 
author does not know the ownership history of the property prior to when it was acquired 
by Mr. Rodriguez. 
 
6.3   PRODUCTION: Anaconda has identified at least three locations where very small 
scale prospecting activity (shallow trenches) has exposed and possibly removed very 
minor amounts of copper oxides which are locally associated with narrow magnetite veins.

7.0   GEOLOGY 
 
7.1 REGIONAL AND LOCAL GEOLOGY: The San Gabriel Project lies within a 
Mesozoic back-arc volcanic-sedimentary sequence of rocks at the southern end of the 
Lower Cretaceous Cerro del Pingo dioritic-granodioritic Coastal Batholith. The San Gabriel 
Project is located 15km to the east of the crustal-scale Atacama Fault System (AFS). Two 
very similar andesitic back-arc sequences of possibly different ages are inferred to be in 
contact along fault splays of the AFS in the general area of the project. The location of this 
contact, which lies between the Jurassic La Negra Formation and the Lower Cretaceous 
Punta del Cobre Formation and which has not been pinpointed accurately (dependant on 
the regional map being referred to) is either slightly to the east or to the west of the project 
area (Naranjo and Puig 1984, Godoy and Lara 2003).  
 
The Cerro del Pingo Batholith has been variously dated at between 124 and 111Ma. In the 
area of the San Gabriel Project it consists of irregular stocks, which represent the southern 
limit of a major body 110km long with a maximum width of 40km (Figure 7.1). Other 
elongate stocks of similar age occur within the AFS to the south of San Gabriel (the Sierra 
Pastenes and Las Tazas Plutons).  
 
The volcanic rocks in the area overlie, and are faulted against, a Paleozoic to Lower 
Jurassic basement of sediments and intrusive bodies. The main exposures of the 
Paleozoic (Devonian-Carboniferous) basement rocks occur along the coast. However, 
several windows located further inland expose the older basement rocks through the 
Mesozoic sequences as basement highs, or as up-faulted blocks (horsts). The basement 
window closest to the project area consists of the Capitana Pluton and older sediments. 
Age dates for the Capitana Pluton are in the 205-199Ma range (Triassic to Lower 
Jurassic). The Capitana Pluton outcrops as a crescent shaped body within the AFS where 
it (the AFS) changes direction approximately 14km west of the project area. 
 
The AFS is a broadly developed north-south zone of multiple faults and complex array of 
fault splays which is traceable for 500km from the City of La Serena in the south to the port 
town of Taltal approximately 50km north of San Gabriel and then continuing northward 
past Antofagasta. The project area lies on a set of NNW trending fault splays at a point 
where, to the south, these swing NNE forming an arcuate set, roughly paralleling and 
accentuating a flexure in the main fault zone, and where the Triassic Capitana Pluton is 
exposed. 
 
The first stage of drilling at San Gabriel was largely based on the definition of three (the 
San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia Zones) significant magnetic anomalies which occur 
within a 1,200m radius and which have been confirmed as magnetite bearing deposits.  
 
While the specific geological setting for each of the deposits is slightly different with 
regards to the mineralization controls and host rock type, the setting in general is similar 
and is described as follows. 
 
The host rocks for the mineralization are mainly contact metamorphosed and 
altered/metasomatised andesite flows and associated pyroclastic volcanics with minor 
distal-type sediments, which most probably include calcareous units. The flows and flow 



  19

breccias are porphyritic, often with oriented feldspar phenocrysts. The associated intrusive 
rocks, dioritic to tonalitic stocks and dykes, are also mineralized to a lesser extent. Un-
metamorphosed intrusions are scarce, and it is therefore likely that mineralization occurred 
as a late phase related to the emplacement of these bodies, and/or possibly the 
mineralization is related to a later intrusive event which has yet to be recognized. A set of 
andesitic porphyry dykes are mapped which appear to be pre- to syn-mineralization. A 
minor set of aplitic to granitic dikes are also recognized which appear to have undergone 
weak metamorphism and which carry disseminated magnetite crystals and which may be 
late-syn-mineralization. 
 
Mineralization consists of disseminations, veins, sheeted veinlets-stockworks, breccias 
and massive bodies of magnetite. Hematite and copper and iron sulfides are rare. The 
grade of the magnetite bearing material tends to increase in the areas of stronger 
metasomatism, and usually where there is a coarse grained actinolite – epidote 
association, which has destroyed the original host rock texture. Ghosts of clasts are 
common in this mineralized rock and it is probable that it was, in large part, originally a 
volcanic breccia. Massive andesite flows are generally better preserved texturally, as a 
result of possibly being less permeable to the mineralizing/altering solutions. 
 
The central core, at least at the San Gabriel Zone is probably magmatic magnetite which 
has intruded the metamorphosed volcaniclastic rocks in the form of a "lopolith" with a near 
vertical fault/feeder conduit located towards its southwestern terminus. The magnetite 
magma has served to metasomatise the surrounding previously metamorphosed and 
strongly metasomatised rocks. Additionally, the magmatic magnetite has subsequently 
been hydrothermally brecciated with a second phase of hydrothermal magnetite being 
deposited as matrix fill and as veinlets. The core of the Esperanza Zone mineralization is 
also probably magmatic magnetite with an underlying feeder pipe.  
 
Structural controls of mineralization are clear at the district scale where the NNW trend of 
the Atacama Fault Zone is reflected in the orientation of the three main geophysical 
anomalies and the dominant structural lineaments on satellite images. In the field, poor 
outcrop, particularly in the mineralized areas, makes detailed structural analysis difficult. 
Bedding is rarely measurable, though a shallow easterly dip is recognized in landscape 
and, rarely, in outcrop.

7.2   PROJECT GEOLOGY 
 
7.2.1   Lithology: As shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3, the country rocks in the project area 
consist of andesitic lavas, breccias and minor tuffs and associated sediments of the 
Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatic arc which are intruded by the Lower Cretaceous Cerro del 
Pingo plutonic complex.  
 
The rock units that have been recognized at San Gabriel – surface and drill holes – are as 
listed below: 
 
1. Porphyritic andesite lavas and breccias; 
2. Fine porphyritic andesite or basaltic andesite flows; 
3. Volcanic breccias of autobreccia and mass flow origin; 
4. Lapilli tuffs and volcanic conglomerates; 
5. Diorite intrusions, generally fine and occasionally very fine grained; 
6. Granodiorite intrusions, medium to fine grained; 
7. Andesitic porphyry dikes; 
8. Aplite to granite dikes and apophyses; 
9. Strongly metamorphosed/metasomatised (original texture-destroyed) rocks;          

these has been divided into actinolite, epidote and magnetite dominant 
varieties; 

10. Calc-silicate rock including garnet-bearing skarn, which probably represent 
original calcareous sediments; 

11. Hornfels - very fine grained metamorphic rock of probable fine volcanic origin; 
12. Massive magnetite and magnetite-cemented crackle to jigsaw breccia; 
13. Fault breccias.

7.2.2 Metamorphism and metasomatism (Alteration): The rocks in the project area were 
affected by some degree of thermal contact metamorphism, while the mineralization is 
associated with an overprinting metasomatic event which involved the introduction of Fe-Ca-Na 
fluids.  
 
Contact metamorphism is evident principally as weak to strong development of hornfels 
(dominantly pyroxene hornfels) in the volcanics and the local development of skarn-type 
mineralogies in calc-silicate rocks. Intrusive rocks are affected to a lesser extent. 
 
The metasomatic development is strong in the vicinity of the massive and vein magnetite, 
generally masking contact metamorphic features, as it affects the intrusives and volcanics alike. 
It consists of actinolite - epidote and magnetite with apparently minor apatite.  It shows a clear 
relationship with the magnetite mineralization, around which a consistent zonation has been 
recognized by the SBX geologists. 
 
The following secondary (metamorphic/metasomatic/hydrothermal alteration) minerals have 
been identified from preliminary petrographic work performed on 27 samples, which are listed in 
their approximate order of importance: clays (generally major and widespread presence); 
sericite; actinolite; calcite; chlorite; albite; epidote (not common except in veins with magnetite); 
pyroxenes; and, tourmaline. 
 
A late metasomatic phase which has been recognized at San Gabriel has a specularite-
magnetite-chalcopyrite-epidote-(sericite-tourmaline) association. This is not volumetrically 
significant and is found mainly in the area of Esperanza – Antonia, where it is located along NW 
vein-fault structures hosted, in part by, porphyritic dike rocks. It is also well developed on the 
border of the Esperanza magnetite body. 
 
Apatite, scapolite and the products of potassic alteration (secondary potassic feldspar and 
biotite), which are commonly found in areas of IOCG mineralization were not recognized in the 
sample set submitted for preliminary petrography. In general the pattern of 
metamorphism/metasomatism/alteration as described above appears to be a variation on those 
described in the literature of Chilean iron ore and IOCG deposits in general.  
 
7.2.3   Mineralization: The iron mineralization occurs in a transitional series of five dominant 
forms:  
a. massive magnetite lenses, pods and irregular bodies; 
b. magnetite-cemented breccias; 
c. massive  magnetite veins;  
d. sheeted veinlet to stockwork systems; 
e. disseminated magnetite; 
f. other types of iron mineralization. 
 
a. Massive magnetite lenses, pods and irregular bodies comprise essentially coarsely crystalline 
magnetite. This mode of occurrence has been observed only occasionally in the diamond drill 
core, where it has a similar coarsely crystalline habit to vein fill magnetite; this massive 
magnetite is considered to probably be magmatic i.e. intrusive magnetite.  
 



  25

b. Magnetite-cemented breccias: Matrix-supported breccias, where generally angular wall rock 
clasts are set in a cement of massive magnetite, make up most high grade material. Some re-
brecciation (breccia-in-breccia texture) implies multiple brecciation events and increasing 
magnetite content. In these zones clasts are often diffuse "ghosts", due to partial assimilation by 
the magnetite-rich fluids. The matrix-supported breccias are thought to grade outwards to clast-
supported breccias with crackle and jigsaw textures (little rotation or rounding of wall-rock clasts 
and with generally less than 40% magnetite cement). These are the dominant textures in the 
low grade material. They tend to occur on the borders of cores of clast-supported breccias and 
appear to grade out to actinolite-epidote-chlorite breccias with disseminate and veinlet 
magnetite.   
 
c. The massive magnetite veins are typically formed with well developed crystal faces radiating 
from the wall rock at which there is a sharp contact and with no alteration extending into the wall 
rock as is typically seen in hydrothermal vein systems i.e. this is suggestive of intrusive diking. 
This style of mineralization is poorly developed in the project area; it may contribute to grade 
within the zones of breccia mineralization. 
 
d. The sheeted veinlets to stockwork systems are best developed flanking veins and bodies of 
massive magnetite. However, they can occur some distance away from the principal deposit or 
prospect. The "stockworks" are most commonly composed of two intersecting sheeted 
magnetite veinlet sets with one set being dominant. The maximum width of the veins that are 
developed within the stockwork is generally less than 20cm and with individual veinlets 
averaging 4mm. The width and intensity of this style of veining varies considerably dependant 
on the distance from the main vein and probably with lithology. 
 
e. The disseminated magnetite is generally fine grained and is widespread in the wall rocks of 
the mineralized bodies. The iron content of this style of mineralization is generally less than 20% 
and therefore does not constitute a major resource. The disseminated magnetite type of 
mineralization appears to be generally high in contaminants (unfavorable elements) which fact 
contributes to this style of mineralization being an unlikely resource. 
 
f. Other types of iron mineralization include hematite as martitized magnetite and as apparently 
primary specular hematite. The distribution of the former has not been well defined aerially, as it 
does not appear a major component of the system. It occurs locally near the surface at 
Esperanza and has rarely been recognized in drilling. Specular hematite (specularite) is present 
in a few areas, marginal to magnetite mineralization, and generally in association with the very 
limited copper mineralization that has been seen at San Gabriel. This specularite-copper 
association is a structurally controlled late event which is not well developed. Between the 
Antonia and Esperanza Zones a line of old pits marks a series of veins which carry very weakly 
developed specularite-copper plus minor (crystalline) magnetite in, and adjacent, to an andesite 
porphyry dyke. 
 
The main resource at both San Gabriel and Esperanza appears in large part to be a mix of 
relatively massive magnetite and magnetite breccia. The drill hole sections that have been 
constructed for the San Gabriel and Esperanza deposits demonstrate that the highest Fe 
grades at both prospects often occur in the upper levels which suggest the formation of possible 
lopolith (magmatic origin) or "ponding" of fluids (hydrothermal origin) under an impermeable or 
otherwise non-breachable roof.  



  26

 
7.2.4   San Gabriel Zone: A significant body of magnetite has been developed contained in 
volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks adjacent to and flanking a fine-grained diorite intrusive. The 
massive and vein magnetite mineralization is hosted within the strongly actinolite and epidote 
and frequently brecciated host rock.  The bulk of the main mineralization does not out crop and 
only the edges of the mineralization are locally exposed as fine magnetite veining/veinlets in the 
intrusion. The intrusive is found on three sides of the mineralized body and the drilling shows 
two dyke-like intrusive bodies at approximately the center of the deposit. A sharp transition 
occurs from relative unaltered granodiorite/tonalite to a more veined and metasomatised diorite 
at the northern side of the San Gabriel deposit. Massive andesite flow units which are found 
above and below the main mineralization, as well as andesite units which outcrop to the south 
and east, are only weakly affected by the metasomatism and mineralization. This suggests that 
the mineralization may be preferentially located in the more favorably permeable units, possibly 
andesitic pyroclastics, or that these were structurally weaker and that the magmatic magnetite 
could intrude, and structurally deform, the volcaniclastics thereby resulting in the apparent 
"lopolith" intrusive shape of the deposit. Furthermore, and in view of the fact that the 
volcanic/volcaniclastic sequence appears to be largely enveloped by intrusive, it is possible the 
host rocks at San Gabriel - and the mineralization – comprise a roof pendant in the intrusive.  
 
A steep NW-trending fault which is suggested by drill sections has an inferred down-throw to the 
east. This fault coincides with a mapped image lineament and aligns with parallel structures at 
the Esperanza Zone. 
 
Figure 7.4 is a representative geological cross section taken through Section SG-06 and which 
shows the "lopolithic" shape of the deposit, as well as the probable magnetite feeder dike.

7.2.5   Esperanza Zone: The mineralization at the Esperanza Zone is located within a massive 
fine grained (basaltic) andesitic flow sequence with apophyses of dacite-andesitic porphyry in 
the vicinity.  Mineralization crops out in an area 100 by 40m within a strongly actinolite-epidote-
gypsum alteration assemblage. In drill sections, the main magnetite core is interpreted to be a 
mushroom-shaped body (lopolith) surrounded by a breccia zone of actinolite-epidote-
specularite-apatite  which is up to 10m thick and which forms a funnel-shaped envelope, and 
which has been termed a "contact breccia".  The body is characterized by a sharp grade cut-off 
upward and to the NE. A NW fault is likely to explain the latter and this may define the border of 
brecciation. To the NW and SE, mineralization deepens and weakens along a fault zone which 
is part of the San Gabriel-Esperanza structural corridor. The mineralization, which is getting 
weaker, also tends to deepen towards the SW without any apparent structural control. 
 
Significant pyroclastic and epiclastic units have not been recognized in the Esperanza Zone. 
The mineralization, which is hosted within a massive flow unit, appears to be fundamentally 
controlled by a strong hydrothermal event which is developed in a northwesterly trending 
structural zone. Granodiorite-diorite dykes, which have been logged in the drill cuttings, but 



  28

have not been recognized at the surface, are similar in composition to small stocks located to 
the west. 
 
The annular contact breccia and tabular zones of similar associations within the andesitic 
sequence often show stronger specularite with traces of copper oxides than the core magnetite 
areas. Elsewhere, including minor workings between Esperanza and Antonia, a specularite-
magnetite-copper association, which is late in the mineralization sequence (post andesite 
porphyry dyke), probably indicates multiple mineralization events at Esperanza. 
 
Figure 7.5 is a representative geological cross section taken through Section SG-06 and shows 
the possible "lopolithic" shape of the Esperanza deposit, as well as the probable magnetite 
feeder dike.

7.2.6   Antonia Zone: As at the San Gabriel Zone, no significant mineralization crops out at 
Antonia, and many of the holes are collared in shallow alluvium. The RANTA-02 (Figure 7.6), 03 
and 04 RC holes, which were drilled to test the (north) easterly magnetic anomaly of two 



  29

northwesterly trending, parallel, relatively narrow magnetic anomalies, have initially been 
interpreted to have intersected a strongly structurally controlled, vein-like breccia body 
averaging between 20m and 40m true thickness which allowed the interpretation of an Inferred 
Resource.  The balance of the drilling (5 RC holes) which in part tested the (south) westerly 
magnetic anomaly returned only generally low Fe values (<20% FeT). To date no attempt has 
been made to model the source of the southwestern magnetic anomaly detected in the Antonia 
Zone. The host rocks appear to be strongly metamorphosed and metasomatised epiclastic 
units, with calc-silicate/skarn mineralization being recognized within this recrystallized and 
porphyroblastic sequence. Meta-dioritic intrusions appear to be present, though these are not 
easily distinguished from the former. A strongly metasomatised diorite stock occurs to the SE of 
the eastern anomaly, where it also appears as a 6m dyke in a low-grade section of RANTA-2. 
Recognizable andesitic lavas occur only on the periphery of the outcropping areas but are 
interpreted as important as hosts of mineralized zones.  
 
7.2.7 Area 4: To date, the only work that has been performed in the Area 4 Sector located in the 
concessions located approximately 4 kms to the west of the principal San Gabriel mineralization 
has been the magnetometer survey. No geological mapping or other preliminary sampling work 
has been conducted here. 
 
7.3 METALLOGENY: The author, in conjunction with the SBX geologists, considers that the 
San Gabriel iron mineralization is located within the Lower Cretaceous Metallogenic belt as 
defined by Maksaev, (2001). This Lower Cretaceous Belt hosts a number of  Iron Oxide-
Copper-Gold (IOCG) deposits such as Candelaria and large iron (magnetite-apatite) deposits, 
such as El Romeral and Carmen, which are closely associated with the trans-tensional (sinistral 
strike-slip) tectonics of the Atacama Fault System. This system of iron deposits extends from ~ 
50 kms south of La Serena to ~ 60 kms northeast of Chañaral, or ~500 kms. The Lower 
Cretaceous Metallogenic Belt of Maksaev extends for ~1600 km (or ~ 200 kms to the north of 
Antofagasta and to ~250 kms south of Santiago. It probably has a maximum width of 50 kms. 
This belt is composed of a combination of copper rich and iron (copper deficient) rich IOCG 
deposits, as well a few porphyry Cu-Au deposits (e.g. Andacollo), stratabound copper deposits 
(e.g. El Soldado), and Cu-Au bearing vein systems (e.g. Las Palmas).  
 
On a more local basis, the San Gabriel area includes iron-rich (specularite>magnetite) copper 
deposits such as Teresa del Colmo, Altamira, and the Franken deposits. These deposits appear 
to be associated with the same Lower Cretaceous (112 ma) granodioritic-dioritic intrusives of 
the Coastal batholith complex that are associated with the San Gabriel magnetite mineralization.  
 
The fact that the mineralization occurs in, or close to, the contact of these stocks and that most 
of the iron and iron-copper mineralization, including the world class Candalaria IOCG deposit 
(230 kms to the south of the Project), are hosted in Lower Jurassic or Cretaceous rocks, 
strongly favors a Cretaceous age of mineralization.

 7.4 Project Geophysics: During January, 2008, SBX, on behalf of Anaconda, contracted 
Servicios Geofisicos en Mineria e Ingeniera Ltda (SEGMI) to complete a gravimetric survey 
across the San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonio sectors of the property. The instrumentation 
utilized was a LaCoste & Romberg Model G Series No. 463 gravity meter, which is stated to 
have a precision of 10-3 gals, with a drift of ~1 milligal/mo. A total of 291 stations were read 
(plus 6 repeat reading for drift control). The instrument was calibrated utilizing Station IGSN 71 
(Copiapo) of the Chilean national gravity network system.  Readings were taken at 500m 
centers per the following: 
 
San Gabriel – 89 reading on 8 lines between 4000m and 5000m long oriented at N45W; 
Esperanza   – 96 reading on 8 lines between 3500m and 6000m long oriented at N45W; 
Antonia       – 103 reading on 11 lines between 2000m and 5500m long oriented at N45W. 
 



  31

SEGMI concluded that there was a sufficient density contrast between the magnetite bearing 
bodies at each of the zones versus that of the background density to define anomalous high 
density (magnetite bearing) zones as shown in Figure 7.7.  The results obtained from magnetic 
survey conducted in 2007 prior to the gravity survey suggest that the gravity anomalies are 
offset from the magnetic anomalies. This conclusion has been further substantiated by the 
drilling. There is the possibility that using a 3D Inversion algorithm similar to that used for the 
magnetic work (as discussed below) may improve the quality/results obtained for the gravity 
survey. A second possible cause for the offset (gravity vs magnetic) anomalies might be the fact 
that the magnetic survey was conducted at station intervals which were considerably closer than 
that of the gravity survey.

During November, 2007, Argali Geofisica E.I.R.L. was contracted by La Veta to perform a 
magnetic survey across the San Gabriel Property with the objective of outlining zones of 
magnetite mineralization. A total of 215 line-kms was surveyed on the San Gabriel grid. The 
ground magnetic survey, utilizing a GEM systems GSM-19 v7.0 walking "rover" magnetometer, 



  32

was conducted along lines spaced at 40m intervals. Magnetic readings were taken continuously 
at one second intervals, or approximately at 0.5-1.5m intervals, along north-south oriented lines. 
The survey control was maintained by the incorporation of a high quality GPS system into the 
magnetometer such that complete and detailed UTM coordinates and elevation data were taken 
simultaneously with each magnetic reading.  A base station magnetometer (GEM systems 
GSM-19) was set up to take magnetic readings every 4 seconds thereby measuring variations 
in the earth's magnetic field. The "rover" unit was synchronized with the base station 
magnetometer so that the data could be corrected for the diurnal magnetic field variation. Both 
the magnetometer and the GPS system were measured twice a day at a checkpoint which 
confirmed that the instrumentation was performing properly and that the readings were properly 
replicating. Argali states that the repeatability of the magnetic readings was excellent and 
generally within 2 nT, and that the GPS UTM coordinate repeatability was generally within 2m of 
the average value. Argali had to make a small correction re their GPS coordinates vs. the 
coordinates generated by the standard topographic grid survey performed by SBX and which 
was used to spot the drill hole locations – this correction was 00m East and 20m North. 
 
The magnetic data was variously processed to generate the following types of magnetic data 
maps: total magnetic field, pole reduced, analytic signal, vertical derivative, horizontal 
derivatives (dX and dY), and a 3D model of the magnetic susceptibility which fits the observed 
total filed magnetic data.   
 
Per Argali (and as confirmed by both geologic mapping and drilling) magnetite occurs near the 
surface over a large portion of the San Gabriel Project, and therefore the resultant magnetic 
anomalies are very strong. Argali further state that "a number of the anomalies which are narrow 
suggest shallow veins or pods of magnetite. Other anomalies which are strong and wide are 
characteristic of large deposits of high grade magnetite". The following generally describes the 
magnetic interpretation for the three principal magnetite bodies (Zones) and which are depicted 
in Figure 7.7 above. 
 
San Gabriel Zone: This zone (deposit) is represented by the northwest trending magnetic 
anomaly approximately centered on E388,400 and N7,132,000 which is characteristic of a large 
body of massive magnetite with dimensions of +800m along strike, a possible +100m width at 
depth, and a very "significant' depth extent - 500m or more, and with a potential for "50-100 
million tons". A 3D inversion manipulation of the magnetic data suggests that grades of 20% - 
45% Fe could be associated with the mineralization. The drilling that was performed here has 
generally confirmed this interpretation. 
 
Esperanza Zone: This anomaly or zone which is centered on E390,700/ N7,133,100 is included 
in a summarized listing of "narrow lenses or veins" which include zones which are  centered 
roughly at E389,900E/N7,1313,100 to E389,600/N7,133,100 (or to the north of the San Gabriel 
zone) as well as at E389,800/N7,131,850; E389,600/N7,132,250; and, E390,750N7,133,530 in 
the Argali report. Argali states that each of these zones strike roughly NW and are expected to 
host limited amounts of shallow mineralization on a smaller scale than that seen at San Gabriel.  
 
Antonia Zone: This zone is represented by the northwest trending magnetic anomaly 
approximately centered on E390,100 and N7,133,100. This anomaly does not exhibit the 
"typical dipolar anomaly characteristic of high grade magnetite with significant depth extent". 
When the data was pole-reduced the anomaly showed a distinct dipolar anomaly with an 



  33

elliptical magnetic 'high' and a mirroring magnetic 'low' to the southwest. Argali considered that 
this anomaly could "represent an excellent Fe target, if remnant magnetism is causing the 
unusual anomaly shape". Argali recommended that the pole-reduced 'high' be drilled and that 
the drilling be extended into the 'low' anomaly.  
 
Area 4: Figure 7.8 depicts the "reduced to the pole" magnetic anomaly for this sector. To date 
the anomalies which generally show up as a combination of northwesterly trending linear 
anomalies or as semi-circular highs (reds and lavender colors) which generally show trends 
varying from northerly to westerly and rarely northeasterly have to date not been field checked. 
The stage II exploration program anticipates geologically mapping and hopefully verifying and 
explaining these anomalies.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPE AND MINERALIZATION 
 
The deposit/mineralization type at San Gabriel comprises the iron-rich, copper-deficient end-
member of the IOCG systems that characterize the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile and 
southern Peru and which constitute part of the Jurassic-Cretaceous volcano-plutonic arc. The 
IOCG deposits are developed in, or intimately associated with, major arc-parallel extensional 
and trans-tensional fault systems which have developed in conjunction with the subduction of 
the oceanic plate beneath the continental margin. These occurrences/deposits show close 
relationships with the plutonic (dioritic to granodioritic) complexes and broadly coeval fault 
systems, such as the Atacama Fault System which was initiated in the Upper Jurassic-Lower 
Triassic.  
 
IOCG-type deposits and mineralization can occur in various forms and include veins, 
hydrothermal breccias, contact (intrusive) magmatic breccias, replacement mantos, calcic and 
mafic skarns as well as composite types which may incorporate any or all of the preceding 
types. The deposit styles that to date has been identified at San Gabriel include massive and 
sheeted magnetite veins (Antonia), hydrothermal breccias, magmatic magnetite, replacement 
mantos and/or mafic skarns (San Gabriel and Esperanza). Higher grade zones may be 
magmatic or associated with zones of increased brecciation. At this time, it is not clear if this 
brecciation is largely a primary feature of the andesitic host rocks (andesite 
breccias/agglomerates), or more of a tectonic-hydrothermal feature. The mineralization appears 
to have a spatial/genetic relationship with the occurrence of dioritic stocks as well as aplitic and 
granitic dikes. 
 
Obtaining a clear understanding of the mode of occurrence/geology of the mineralization at San 
Gabriel has been somewhat complicated by the fact that the bulk of the magnetite 
mineralization that has been defined within the property occurs in low lying areas between hills 
of outcropping country rock and is covered by varying depths of colluvium/alluvium. 
Furthermore, most of the drilling has been performed using reverse circulation techniques which 
generate rock cuttings (typically >2-4 mm in size) and which has made more difficult the 
interpretation of rock types, structures, etc. The limited diamond drilling that has been performed 
both within and peripheral to the San Gabriel (3 holes) and peripheral to the Esperanza (2 hole) 
zones has allowed for a better identification of the variably altered host rocks, the degrees of 
contact metasomatism, hydrothermal activity, mineralogy, and recognition of breccias styles.  
 
The principal metallic mineralization at San Gabriel is magnetite. Minor amounts of martized 
magnetite (hematitized) and very weak hematite developed in fractures and trace to very minor 
amounts of chalcopyrite bearing veinlets with peripheral specularite and pyrite have been 
identified locally. Non-metallic alteration minerals identified to date include: actinolite, epidote, 
calcite, rutile, garnet, wollastonite, diopside, and tourmaline. SBX is in the process of having 
additional petrographic studies performed on selected specimens to obtain a better 
understanding and identification of the mineralogy and petrology of the host rocks, alteration 
assemblages and mineralization.

9.0   MINERALIZATION 
 
9.1 MINERALIZATION TYPE: As discussed in Section 8 (Deposit Type and Mineralization) 
the Fe mineralization at San Gabriel is predominantly magnetite. The bulk of the Fe 
encountered at San Gabriel occurs in northwesterly trending, gently to moderately dipping, 
lenses or horizons within meta-andesitic to basaltic-andesitic volcanics/volcaniclastics and 
which are now variably converted into Fe-skarns. The metamorphism/metasomatism of the 
host/country rocks decreases outwards from the massive magnetite mineralization cores. The 
more massive and higher grade intervals of Fe may comprise volcanic-sedimentary units which 
were either more permeable or have been subjected to greater degrees of 
metasomatism/brecciation and which resulted in the more complete emplacement/ replacement 
by the magnetite. An alternative interpretation is that the nearly massive magnetite is magmatic, 
and that portions of the San Gabriel and Esperanza deposits may represent injections of such 
magmatic magnetite. In such a case the skarnification of the surrounding rocks may be, at least 
in part, related to the emplacement of the magnetite. SBX considers that there have probably 
been two pulses of Fe mineralization. Petrographic studies, which have been requested, will 
assist in confirming the origins of the magnetite. The lower Fe grade material (lower magnetite 
content) comprises intervals of more, or less, magnetite as disseminations, stockworks and as 
inter-fragment matrix fill. In some instances the magnetite crosscuts earlier fragments/crystals of 
magnetite suggesting hydrothermal brecciation and a second phase of mineralization. The 
curvilinear contacts of the magnetite lenses, as defined by the 20% FeT contours, in conjunction 
with an increase in higher temperature metamorphism, as exemplified by the presence of 
epidote, actinolite and diopside, suggests increasing proximity to an intrusive body i.e. heat 
source and the potential source of hydrothermal/magmatic Fe plus the very minor copper 
mineralization. Geological mapping at San Gabriel has led to the observation that, at least at the 
surface, the more massive andesitic flows show lower levels of contact 
metamorphism/metasomatism (Section 7. Project Geology) 
 
Per the magnetometer survey interpretation, and as observed in the scattered outcrops, the 
magnetite also occurs as discontinuous 1-2m wide veins and/or as sheeted centimeter wide 
veins hosted in the andesitic volcanics and dioritic stocks. The magnetite mineralization is 
frequently associated with dioritic stocks and aplitic-granitic dikes.  
 
The San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia zones, all of which trend northwesterly, host the 
mineralization that has been defined to date, with the San Gabriel deposit being very 
substantially larger than either the Esperanza or Antonia deposits. The work that has been 
performed to date in the three separate zones has allowed the estimation of a mineral resources 
in each of the zones as described in Section 17, Mineral Resources Estimates.  
 
1. San Gabriel: Iron mineralization (+20% FeT) has been defined (37 drill holes – 13,853.1) 
over a strike length of 800m, which shows widths of between 100 and 200m and attains 
thicknesses of 80 – 250m. The depth to the top of the mineralization ranges between 50m and 
120m. The mineralization strikes northwesterly and generally dips at approximately 40o to the 
southwest. The southeast end of the San Gabriel deposit is defined by sub-vertical cylindrical 
feeder pipe. The grades contained within the 20% FeT contour range to a high of +70% FeT.  
2. Esperanza: The iron mineralization (+20% FeT) has been defined (31 drill holes – 4,111.9m) 
over a strike length of 180m, an approximate width of 120m, and attains thicknesses of 60m. 



  37

The top of the Esperanza mineralization ranges from surface at the SE end to >80m to the NW. 
The southeast end of the Esperanza deposit is also defined by sub-vertical, cylindrical feeder 
pipe. The mineralization strikes northwesterly and generally dips at approximately 40o to the 
southwest. Other subvertical structures which are 30-60m wide may also have acted as feeders 
to the system. The grades within the 20% FeT contour range to a high of 70% FeT. 
 
3. Antonia: The Antonia Sector consists of two northwest trending magnetic anomalies: 
 
• the Antonia East anomaly, which is 350m long was tested with 3 holes (754m)  defined a 
steeply dipping mineralized structure 20 - 45m wide with an average value of 32% FeT using a 
25% FeT cutoff. This mineralization is open at depth. 
 
• The Antonia West anomaly, which is 700m long, was tested with 5 drill holes (1048m) 
which returned intervals with values < 30% FeT.  No resource estimate was performed for the 
Antonia West mineralization. 
 
9.2   TARGET AREAS: The remaining magnetic anomalies to be explored within the San 
Gabriel Property have been interpreted (Argali, 2007) to comprise magnetite veins (and/or 
stockworks) which are probably of limited potential. However, if a mining operation were to be 
initiated at San Gabriel, these anomalous zones may warrant further definition and development 
and which might constitute easily accessible additional mine feed to a nearby operation.  
 
Anaconda filed concessions at the Area 4 Sector, located approximately 4 kms to the east of 
the San Gabriel Sector (Figure 7.8), and based on the results of the ground magnetic survey 
performed by Argali (2007). Anaconda has budgeted for an initial exploration program at Area 4 
which will be developed pending a to-be completed analysis of the anomalies obtained in this 
sector by Argali, and as included in Section 20 – Recommendations and Budget. Prior to 
initiating any drilling in this zone, the ground would to be geologically mapped.

10.0 EXPLORATION  
 
Anaconda acquired the San Gabriel Project concessions in 2007 as a result of generative work 
performed by SBX (Albrecht Schneider, Martin Perez and Luis Olcay) and which potential was 
offered to Anaconda. The initial interest in the area was sparked by preliminary research based 
on a 2002 digitized aeromagnetic map (1:50,000) which was derived from analogue data 
generated by an aeromagnetic survey flown by the IIG in 1972. This research highlighted a 
magnetic anomaly over the San Gabriel Project area which suggested the existence of a 
substantial body of magnetite. This anomaly has characteristics similar to that of other known 
iron deposits located further to the west which are developed in association with the Atacama 
Fault System. Work by SBX established that a large portion of the ground is alluvium covered 
and that a company (Rio Tinto) had previously drilled approximately 15 RC holes. On further 
investigation some remnant RC cuttings piles were discovered which carried significant 
quantities of magnetite. 
 
In September-October 2007, Anaconda drilled 5 DD holes in the San Gabriel Sector which work 
confirmed the existence of a magnetite bearing deposit. In November, 2007, Anaconda 
commissioned (Argali) to perform a detailed ground magnetic survey of the San Gabriel 
Property (refer to Section 7.4 Project Geophysics) to better refine drill targets and which 
resulted in the definition of at least 3 significant  anomalous sectors (San Gabriel, Esperanza 
and Antonia) as discussed in Section 7.4, and which have been variably drilled. The balance of 
the drilling that has been performed to date was completed between January and May, 2008. 
During Feb., 2008 Anaconda commissioned (SEGMI) to perform a gravimetric survey, which 
work, in general terms, aided in better defining the higher grade (denser) magnetite cores of the 
(magnetic) anomalies previously identified in the three principal sectors in San Gabriel. 
Anaconda has contracted SBX Consultores to manage, perform and report on all of the work 
that has been done at San Gabriel. 
 
As at the date of this report, a total of 76 drill holes (19,756.95m) have been completed in the 
three sectors, of which 2190.95 meters constitute diamond drilling and 17,566 meters constitute 
reverse circulation drilling. Table 10.1 summarizes the drilling that has been performed at San 
Gabriel by Anaconda.

Anaconda has prepared a second phase drill budget totaling $2,500,000 which fuund infill drill at 
the San Gabriel and at the Esperanza Zones to convert the estimated Indicated Resources to 
the Measured category and to upgrade the resource at the Antonia Zone. Additional work is also 
planned to test the northerly trending extension of the Esperanza deposit, as indicated by the 
magnetic anomaly and to test other magnetically anomalous areas, including the Area Four 
Sector located in the westerly set of concessions.

11.0 DRILLING 
 
As outlined in Section 10 Exploration, Anaconda initiated a preliminary 5 RC hole drill program 
during the period August-September, 2007 at San Gabriel and within the San Gabriel Zone. A 
total of 17,562m was drilled in 71 inclined RC holes and 2,190.95m in 5 DD holes in the San 
Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia zones. Drill holes lengths in the RC holes varied between 100 
and 460m and averaged approximately 208m. Drill hole lengths in the DD holes varied between 
344.05 and 523.9m and averaged approximately 438m. 
 
Sociedad Perforaciones e Ingeniera Chile Ltda of Santiago, Chile (PerfoChile) performed the 
reverse circulation and the diamond drilling at San Gabriel. PerfoChile is personally known to 
the author and is generally known and respected within the mining industry.  
 
When the author visited the property and subsequent to the drilling, a few of the drill hole collars 
that were observed were not identified, although most of the drill holes had short pieces of open 
plastic tubing embedded in a cement block. In a few instances the tubing was not properly 
aligned per the indicated and surveyed (down-the-hole) orientation. The author recommends 
that Anaconda consistently and properly identify the holes and that the plastic tubing be properly 
oriented, capped and encased in a cement block. 
 
The RC holes were all drilled using a 5.5" bit. The DD holes were drilled to ~ 400m using an HQ 
(63.5mm) diamond bit and then (as needed) reduced to an NQ (47.6mm) bit. All of the drill holes 
(RC and DD) were sampled at 2 meter intervals. The DD core recoveries were stated to be in 
excess of 98%; the author measured selected core intervals and confirmed recoveries of 99% to 
100%.  
 
As a result of the highly variable SG of the material being drilled i.e. granodioritic-dioritic-
andesitic-mafic skarn + high to low grade magnetite bearing rocks, or SGs ranging between ~ 
2.8 and 4.9, estimating recoveries for the RC drilling is complicated. However, some spot 
checks of the estimated volume multiplied by the estimated SG vs. actual weight of the 2-meter 
intervals confirm that the RC recoveries were typically +95%, or very acceptable.  
 
All drill holes greater than 100m in length were down-the-hole deviation surveyed by Comprobe 
Ltda. using a non-magnetic Humphrey Surface Recording Gyroscope. The deviation results 
were used to correct for any drift in both inclination and azimuth in the plotting of drill hole 
sections and level maps, etc. 
 
Tables 11.1 summarizes those drill results for the San Gabriel drilling by zone where intervals 
8m (or greater) and averaging a minimum of 20% FeT were obtained. Figures 10.1, 10.2 and 
10.3 show the drill locations for all of the holes that have been drilled to date at the San Gabriel 
Project. 
 
The San Gabriel Zone was mostly drilled on 100 meter centers, with a few of the holes being 
spaced at 50 meters and along 9 lines oriented at N30oE and over an 800m interval. Most of the 
holes were drilled at N30oE and at a -60o inclination. This drilling confirmed the magnetic/gravity 
interpretations which indicate that the variably tabular mineralization/deposit trends 
northwesterly and dips gently to the SW. The current interpretation of the drill results (geology 



  45

+mineralization) indicates that the mineralized body is tabular to "lopolithic" in form and in part 
shows varying dips (25-60oSW) as a result bifurcations of the mineralization.  It is the author's 
opinion that the drilling, as performed to date within the San Gabriel Zone has been properly 
done and that bulk of the drill holes have properly tested the mineralization as it is currently 
understood. The drilling that has been performed to date supports the estimation of Indicated 
Mineral Resources at the San Gabriel Sector. Additional drilling will be required to upgrade the 
resource category. 
 
The Esperanza Zone was drilled principally at 30 meter centers along 6 N30oE oriented sections 
with the holes inclined at -60 to 70oNE and over a length of 180 meters. Four holes, located to 
the northwest of the principal mineralization, were drilled at intervals of 100m or greater. The 
drilling was conducted as the southeast end of a northwest trending magnetic anomaly where 
the magnetic inversion data indicated the presence of a body with high magnetite content. The 
drilling confirmed the magnetic/gravity interpretations which indicate that the 
mineralization/deposit trends northwesterly and dips moderately to the NE. The interpretation of 
the drill results (geology + mineralization) indicates that the mineralized body is tabular to 
lenticular and dips at ~ 45-50oSW. It is the author's opinion that the drilling that was performed 
within the Esperanza Zone has been properly done, and that the drilling has properly tested the 
mineralization, and that this drilling supports the estimation of Indicated Mineral Resources. 
 
The 4 holes that were drilled to the northwest and beyond the principle focus of drilling at the 
southeast end of the Esperanza Zone magnetic anomaly returned values which indicate that the 
mineralization is relatively discontinuous and that additional drilling will be required to determine 
if additional resources can be generated beyond those defined to the southeast. Holes DEZA04 
and REZA03 returned intervals of <20% FeT over 8m; holes REZA05 and DEZA02 returned 
intervals as indicated in Table 11.1.  
 
The Antonia East anomaly was tested with 3 inclined (-60o) holes drilled to the southwest, and 
the Antonia West anomaly with 5 widely spaced inclined (-60o) holes also drilled to the 
southwest. The very limited and widely spaced (100 meters) drilling performed at Antonia East 
defined a magnetite bearing vein (structure) approximately 250 meters long which trends at 
N50oW and dips at 70oNE. Per the magnetic data, the mineralization weakens, or terminates, 
within 20-30 meters on either side of the limiting drill holes (Figure 10.3). The author concurs 
that the drilling as performed and interpreted reasonably allows for the estimation of the Inferred 
Resource as defined. The drilling performed at the Antonia East anomaly failed to define 
significant material grading >20% FeT, and no further work is recommended here.

The intercepts provided in Table 11.1 using a 20% FeT cutoff were compiled by the author and 
derived from spreadsheets prepared by SBX. The author (as indicated in Section 14, Data 
Verification) has checked a substantial percentage of the original assay data compilation and 
confirms that it has generally been correctly and accurately performed - both the transference of 
assays (received from the laboratory) by SBX to the spreadsheets, and then to the drill holes 
which were utilized to generate the cross sections used to develop the Estimated Mineral 
Resources as detailed in Section 17. No high grade assays were cut because the magnetite 
content, and therefore the percentage FeT, can be visually estimated and the grade generally 
confirmed. 
 
The estimated true widths of the mineralized drill hole intercepts were derived by measuring the 
indicated true width (i.e. at right angles to the interpreted dip) of the +/>20% FeT intervals as 
interpreted in the cross sections developed by SBX, and which were utilized to generated the 
mineral resource estimations for each of the Zones.

12.   SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Because the bulk of the mineralization at San Gabriel is under colluvial cover, SBX only cut and 
channel sampled one trench in the Esperanza Zone. Sixty-seven samples were taken at 4 
meter intervals over a distance of 268 meters. This sampling returned an interval which assayed 
31.5% FeT over 124 meters, with values ranging from 6.1 to 60.6% FeT.  
 
As previously described in Section 10 and 11, the San Gabriel Property has been relatively 
extensively drilled - 3 DD holes and 34 RC holes in the San Gabriel Sector, 2 DD holes and 29 
RC holes in the Esperanza Sector, and 8 RC holes in the Antonia Sector. 
 
At the time of the author's visit to the property, the drilling had been recently terminated so that 
the author was unable to review actual drill sampling procedures. However, the author has 
extensively reviewed work that SBX has performed on behalf of other companies and the author 
is confident that the procedures that SBX states that it used for taking the drill samples (as 
described following) were properly followed.  
 
SBX, on behalf of Anaconda, has initiated a very controlled/defined QA/QC system whereby the 
integrity of the drill core/cuttings is fully maintained and the material is handled only by SBX-
contracted personnel from the moment that it exits the drill. At no time is an officer, director, or 
associate of the issuer involved in the handling of the DD core or RC cuttings.  
 
The sampling methods employed by SBX are industry-standard methods for handling drill core 
and cuttings. The samples were taken at two meter intervals for both the diamond drill core and 
the cuttings. It is the author's opinion that the sampling intervals and methods that have been 
utilized for both the core and the cuttings are appropriate to test the type of mineralization under 
investigation and in fact is the system used by the principle iron producer in Chile. The author 
does not believe that there are any factors which have resulted in sample biases.  
 
Once the diamond drill core is extracted from the core barrel, the drilling company places the 
core into a wooden core box, where it is washed off and cleaned as necessary, and the length 
of the core run is measured by both the driller and an on-site SBX geologist or trained geo-
technician "geotech" to confirm the recovery. The geologist/geotech also notes the RQD (rock 
quality designation as a total and a percentage) and FF (fracture frequency) geotechnical 
characteristics of the interval on a per-meter basis. The core is then transferred to 3-channel 1 
meter long galvanized pressed metal core trays which are then capped and wired. Once the 
target depth is reached it is the sole responsibility of the project geologist to determine if the drill 
hole is to be continued or abandoned.  
 
The RC samples are typically collected at a 2 meter intervals in the RC drill rig cyclone at which 
point the interval is unloaded into a plastic sack which is passed (manually) twice through a 
mechanical riffle splitter with the enter sample being rerun so as to properly homogenize the 
sample. The homogenized sample is then passed through the splitter at least twice so as to 
generate two twin samples weighing approximately 10 kgs each. The remaining material is 
disposed of at the drill site. The onsite geologist does a preliminary log of each interval and 
collects a representative sample of the interval in properly marked and identified plastic "chip" 
trays, provided there is sufficient light. Otherwise, the geotech will collect the representative 



  50

cuttings "chips" during the evening shift so that the material is readily available for the geologist 
to complete the pre-log.  
 
Because of the fact that the higher magnetite content intervals weigh considerably more than 
the low magnetite or barren intervals, those intervals with higher magnetite are collected from 
the cyclone at 1-meter intervals with each two meter interval being thoroughly mixed and 
homogenized through the splitter and then the standard two (twinned) samples are prepared. 
The samples are collected in clear plastic bags which are identified with twin numbered 
cardboard sample tags which are inserted into the wrapped top of the sample bags and the 
bags staple sealed. Duplicate cuttings samples (i.e. for duplicate assaying) are inserted at a rate 
of approximately 5% per drill hole. This duplicate sample is inserted sequentially (numerically) 
such that there is no way that the laboratory can identify that a duplicate has been inserted. 
When the assays are received from the laboratory (in both electronic excel format and as a 
printed certificate) the duplicate sample assay and number are manually removed from the 
sequential assay listing (excel) and placed in a column adjacent to the original assay for easy 
comparison - refer to Section 13. 
 
The author understands that SBX has not collected, nor measured, the dust that exits the 
cyclone flue. Because of the very different specific gravities of the barren and lower grade 
material vs. the higher grade material, there exists the possibility that the samples are being 
slightly biased, either positively or negatively. The author recommends that in a subsequent RC 
drill program the dust be collected throughout at least one drill hole and that the grade and 
volume of this material be determined so as to calculate what, if any, effect this dust loss might 
be causing. An alternative would be to use a double cyclone thereby largely eliminating dust 
losses. 
 
The drill core and the RC samples were hauled on a daily basis to Anaconda's secure Copiapo 
storage, sample preparation and logging facility in trucks (2) which are rented by SBX and which 
are driven by SBX contracted personnel. The drill core which is halved with a diamond rock saw 
is marked for sawing by a geologist such that each sample sent for assay is representative of 
the interval. The remaining half of the core is returned to the core box for final logging and 
storage. 
 
Table 11.1 lists the relevant mineralized (+20% FeT) composited intervals for the drilling 
completed in each of the sectors, provides the high and low assays included in each composite, 
and shows the estimated true widths of the intervals listed based on the drill hole section 
interpretation of how the mineralization is occurring over the selected interval.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
13.1 General: On May 29 and 31, 2008, the author visited the Anaconda sample preparation 
and storage facility in Copiapo.  This facility is completely fenced in, has a single locked gate 
entry, and has 24 hours/day security.  An SBX contracted person always lives within the facility. 
The core is stored on racks within a locked warehouse and the twinned cuttings samples are 
stored outside of the warehouse and under a tarp covered area. Un-authorized personnel would 
have difficulty entering.  
 
Anaconda, through SBX, has initiated a rigorous Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
("QA/QC") program for the San Gabriel Project. This program is designed to ensure that all of 
the samples (DD core and RC cuttings) taken at the San Gabriel Project site are fully 
maintained and handled only by SBX contracted personnel from the moment they are collected 
at the drill site until they have been delivered to the laboratory processing facility. At this time, 
the three entities that have received samples from San Gabriel are the CIMM and Geoanalitica 
analytical laboratories, and the metallurgist, Nelson Rojas in La Serena. Additional check 
samples (rejects/pulps/duplicates) have been sent to other laboratories for additional check or 
confirmation work, as detailed in Section 14 – Data Verification. 
 
SBX is very conscientious about its sample preparation, security and storage procedures and 
therefore maintains a tight control on all sample collection, transportation, processing and 
storage.  At no time, or in any aspect, is an officer, director or associate of the issuer 
(Anaconda) involved in any aspect related to the sample collection through to the sample 
preparation and shipping to the laboratory.  
  
SBX personnel were at the drill rig at all times when it was in operation and the core/cuttings 
were boxed/split and bagged under SBX supervision and control.  The core and cuttings, which 
are transported to the Copiapo process and storage facility on a daily basis, are maintained at 
the drill site until they are packed and loaded for transportation.  SBX maintained two trucks to 
ship samples from the project site to Copiapo and then to La Serena. Prior to shipping, a 
geologist at the drill site prepares a shipping slip which details the samples that are being 
transported to Copiapo.  As the samples are being unloaded on arrival at the 
storage/processing facility in Copiapo, the samples are compared against the original shipping 
slip which is then signed, approved, and filed. At Copiapo, the core is temporarily stored on 
racks prior to being marked up for sawing, and the duplicate (twin) cuttings samples are stored 
under cover in appropriately identified (by drill hole number) piles for possible future use, e.g. 
check sampling or metallurgical testing. The sample transport truck then continued to La Serena 
(Geoanalitica) with the RC cuttings samples and whatever core samples were ready and 
prepared for shipping. A new shipping slip is prepared for the samples that are transported from 
Copiapo (or which continue from the project site) to La Serena. On arrival at the laboratory in La 
Serena the samples being received are compared against the shipping slip and the shipping slip 
is signed and approved by Geoanalitica and this slip is filed on the return trip to Copiapo. The 
laboratory rejects are routinely returned to Copiapo for storage, while the pulps are retained by 
the laboratory for a period of time in the event additional check work is required.  SBX indicates 
that at this time the bulk of the drill pulps are still being held by the laboratory. 
 
The diamond drill core which is received in Copiapo is marked by the geologist for the sampling 
interval (routinely every two meters) and for halving with a diamond rock saw. If the core had not 



  52

been pre-logged at the drill site, the geologist then pre-logged the core, aligned the core 
(thereby re-aligning fractures and/or breaks in the core) so that the core is a straight as possible 
and in its original position and drew a straight line lengthwise to best assure that the sawed (in 
half) sample was representative of the entire 2 meter interval. The technician, after sawing the 
sample, places one half of the sawed sample in a sequentially numbered (with cardboard 
sample tags) plastic bag which is securely stapled to properly ensure that no portion of the 
sample can be lost in the shipment process. The remaining half was replaced in the core tray 
and re-stacked. Subsequent to the termination of the drilling program the core was completely 
and properly re-logged. Selected 10-15 cm intervals of the sawed core have been submitted for 
thin section studies.  
 
As detailed in Section 13.5, seventy-one (71) representative whole-core samples of (barren and 
at various grade (FeT) intervals) and three samples from the Esperanza trench were taken for 
density determinations at the University of Chile in Santiago. These samples were subsequently 
analyzed for % FeT which allowed for the generation of a SG:Grade curve for use in the 
resources estimations.  
 
At no point in the DD hole sequence did SBX insert standards, duplicates or blanks. Although 
the core drilling performed by Anaconda at San Gabriel constituted 15% of the total drilling 
performed, this drilling only represents 7% of the total (+20%) iron intercepts obtained. 
Therefore, it is the author's opinion that, at this point, the failure to insert duplicates, blanks, or 
standards at some point in the core sample stream does not materially impact on the reliability 
of the results returned by the core drilling at this time. In a general sense, the values returned by 
the core drilling where +20% FeT material was obtained, and in conjunction with that returned in 
adjacent RC holes, appear to correlate well. However, the author recommends that any future 
core drilling be subjected to proper QA/QC methodology. The sawed core samples should be 
sent to the lab for sample preparation and the crushed samples returned to Anaconda where 
the blanks, standards and duplicates would be inserted and the samples appropriately and 
sequentially re-numbered.  
 
As indicated in Section 12 (Sampling Method and Approach), SBX inserted approximately 5% 
(and ranging from 3 to 10%) duplicate samples into the RC cuttings sample stream. This was 
achieved by slipping the duplicate into the sample stream sequentially utilizing a pre-numbered 
sample bag system. However, no standards or blanks were included into the sample stream. 
The author recommends that future RC drilling be subjected to improved QA/QC methodology 
and that blanks and standards be inserted.  
 
SBX, on behalf of Anaconda has elected to use the Geoanalitica laboratory in La Serena 
because of the very extensive and positive past experience that SBX has had with Geoanalitica 
in other projects. Geoanalitica employs personnel who have had past experience in the 
processing of samples for assaying for iron. Geoanalitica is an ISO9000:2001 certified 
laboratory. A number of major mining companies including Barrick, Codelco and Antofagasta 
Minerals utilize Geoanalitica's services. 
 
 A compilation of the duplicates entered into the RC cuttings sample stream for the San Gabriel 
Zone sampling and which were statistically compared against the original (primary) result (298 
sample pairs) indicates that Geoanalitica was consistent in the assays results generated and 
that this work shows: 



  53

• a correlation coefficient of +0.99; 
•  medians of 14.1% FeT for the original sample assay vs. 14.1% FeT for the duplicate RC 
sample assays.  
• Standard deviations of 13.6 for the original sample assay vs. 13.7 for the duplicate RC 
sample assays. 
 
Figure 13.1 is a scatter plot for the original vs. duplicate RC assays.

confirms that their results are repeatable with a correlation coefficient of +0.99 and medians of 
13.7% FeT for the original sample assay vs. 13.8% FeT for the laboratory duplicate assay.  
 
A compilation of the duplicates entered into the RC cuttings sample stream for the Esperanza 
Zone sampling and statistically compared against the original (primary) result (70 sample pairs) 
indicates that Geoanalitica was consistent in the assays results generated and that this work 
shows: 
 
• a correlation coefficient of +0.99; 
• medians of 22.9% FeT for the original sample assay vs. 23.2% FeT for the duplicate RC 
sample assays.  
• Standard deviations of 18.99 for the original sample assay vs. 19.05 for the duplicate RC 
sample assays.

Barren quartz was utilized to clean the crushers every 10th sample and every second quartz run 
(or after every 20th sample) the quartz was inserted into the assay stream to check for potential 
contamination resulting from: a) the previous high grade iron bearing samples; and/or b) from 
the crusher/pulverizing machines. The FeT content of the quartz which had passed through the 
crusher/pulverizing machines varied from 0.4 – 1.6% FeT and averaged 0.8% FeT. This check 
work (Magri, E. 2008) demonstrated that the laboratory was generally adequately cleaning the 
crusher/pulverizing machines, and that the quartz  was being only minimally contaminated by 
the iron bearing samples.  
 
Test work conducted by the Geoanalitica for barren quartz samples which have been passed 
through the crusher/grinding circuit indicate that the resultant Fe contamination is on the order 
of 0.1% FeT. This amount of contamination might generate a grade error of 0.5% FeT for a 
deposit estimated to grade 20% FeT i.e. this effect is not considered to be material. Figure 13.3 
demonstrates that the Fe assay for the quartz following the prior drill hole sample assay does 
not spike, and that therefore the iron contamination of the quartz sample is a cumulative effect. 
If it is assumed that the bulk of the Fe contamination of the quartz is the result of the 
transference of Fe from the samples, then the net effect is for a very slight decrease in the 
overall assayed grade of the sample, and hence the estimated resource.

13.2 Sample Collection: The drill sample (core and cuttings) collection techniques have been 
previously addressed in Section 12 (Sampling Method and Approach).  SBX has requested that 
the laboratory advise if a sample has arrived in a damaged condition. If such is the case then 
SBX has a back-up sample that it forwards for assay, and the compromised sample is disposed 
off.  
 
13.3 Sample Preparation: The following summarizes the sample preparation procedures used 
(protocols) by Geoanalitica:  
 

1. Reception: the samples at reception are weighed and assigned a computer generated 
bar code number which will computer-chart the progress of the sample through the 
sample preparation stages to the final assay;  

2. The samples are dried with circulating air (105oC) for at 2-3 hours ,or as needed, while 
being continuously mechanically stirred; 

3. The sample is then passed through a Rocklab primary crusher and reduced to 90% 
passing -10 (Tyler) mesh; the oversize is transferred to a secondary crusher and 
crushed to 100% passing -10 mesh. 

4. Clean quartz is passed through the primary crusher after every 10th sample and the 
quartz is analyzed after every 20th sample; 

5. The -10 mesh sample is then passed through a Lab Tech Hebro rotary splitter and 2 - 
250 gram and a 500 gram samples are generated. One of the 250 grams samples is 
provided to the client along with the reject and the second 250 grams samples is 
retained by the laboratory; the 500 gram sample is retained  for continued processing; 

6. The -10 mesh 500 gram is then passed through a ring pulverizer (Lab Tech) to 95% 
passing -150 mesh and passed through a Lab Tech splitter to generate 2 - 250 gram 
splits which are put in Kraft-type envelopes on which are pasted identical sticker bar 
codes  (with the original sample number as well as the company name). The envelopes 
are then placed in boxes "A" and "B", with the "A" box samples continuing through the 
assay process, and the "B" box samples goes into storage. The boxes are labeled with a 
bar coded sticker which identifies the company, the contained samples (numbers from 
and to). Three laboratory standards (4 - 66% FeT) are inserted into the "A" box at this 
point; 

7. The samples are passed out of the sample preparation facility and to the assay lab 
where 0.1 to 0.11 grams of sample are weighed out on an electronic scale (0.001 grams 



  56

sensitivity); the sample continues to be bar code computer tracked; the weighed 
samples are placed into appropriately labeled plastic vials.  

 
13.4 Analyses: Geoanalitica performs its assaying in "batches" of 50 samples – 41 client 
samples and 5 lab duplicates, 3 standards and 1 blank (quartz) samples as internal quality 
controls. The following summarizes the Atomic Absorption Spectrographic (AAS) assay 
technique utilized by Geoanalitica to assay for FeT in the drilling (head) samples:  
 
- FeT: 0.1 grams of sample are digested in an acid bath (HCl-HNO3-HClO4-HF) and the 
resultant product AAS assayed; the % error for higher grade (+20% FeT) material is estimated 
at +1% FeT and at 0.1% FeT for lower grade material; the detection limit is 0.1% FeT.  
 
The following details the protocols for the Geoanalitica assay techniques used to volumetrically 
assay for % FeT, SiO2, Al203, P and S in the magnetite concentrate recovered by the Davis 
Tube (DT) magnetic concentrator, and/or in the head samples. The material used for the DT test 
must be ground to 80% (+2%) passing -350 mesh. To recover sufficient magnetite in the DT test 
a charge of 10 grams of material is used if the material contains +40% FeT, or 20 grams if it 
contains < 40% FeT. The DTT is then activated with 2 alternating polarizing, electrically driven 
magnets which are located on opposite sides of the tube, while water simultaneously pulses 
through the DTT and expels the barren material. The magnetite is concentrated between the 
magnets. When no more barren material is being expelled by the water transiting the DTT, the 
magnets are turned off and the magnetite concentrate is recovered, weighed, and analyzed for 
% FeMag (iron contained in the recovered magnetite), %FeT, and any contained deleterious 
elements. Additional elements which are analyzed for, or which are in the process of being 
analyzed for, in the magnetite concentrate include Na, Cr, Zn, As, Cu, Ni, Co, V and Ti. 
a. Total (volumetric) Iron (FeT): ~0.4 grams (weighed on an analytical balance - 0.1 mg 
precision) of sample is dissolved in an acid bath comprising the following solutions - 
hydrochloric acid (HCl, d = 1.19 g/ml or ~ 37%); stannous chloride (SnCl2)- 10% by volume; 
saturated (50g/l) mercuric chloride (HgCl2); 0.2% by volume barium diphenylamonsulfonate; 
and, potassium dichromate (5.4 g/l); the sample is dissolved in 20 ml of HCl with a few drops of 
SnCl2 and the container covered and heated to 90oC, or just below boiling, for ½ hour; SnCl2 is 
again added a drop at a time until there it is slight (reddish) discoloration and a final drop is 
again added; ~150 ml of distilled water is then added and the solution allowed to cool; 5 ml of 
5% HgCl2 is added and then after 5 minutes ~ 25 ml of HCl and a few drops of barium 
diphenylamonsulfonate are added to the solution. The resultant solution is titrated with 
potassium dichromate and the quantity of potassium dichromate is used to calculate the % FeT. 
The detection limit for the FeT assay is 0.05%. 
b. Aluminum and Silica (Al and Si): 0.1 grams of sample is mixed with 0.5 grams Na2CO3 
and 2.5 grams of Na202 in a zirconium crucible and heated to a cherry red; the resultant bead is 
then washed and dissolved in 250 ml - 10% (by volume) solution; and, the contained element 
percentages are AAS measured; the detection limit for Al is 0.2%; that for Si in the head sample 
is 0.4%, and in the DT magnetite concentrate 0.2%. The factor to convert Si to SiO2 is 
2.139195, and Al to Al203 is 1.889548. 
c.   Phosphorous (P): dissolve ~ 500mg of sample in 10 ml of HCl, bring the solution to a boil, 
add 5 ml HNO3 and 10 ml of HClO4 and heat at 250oC until the until fumes cease;  cool to where 
crystal are formed and re-dissolve 5 ml of the product in 5 ml of HNO3 10ml of 10% of HClO4 
amnd heat to 250oC until while fumes cease. Cool until crystals are formed and transfer to a 250 
ml vessel with distilled water and homogenize; take aliquots of 5 ml of the product and 25 ml of 



  57

the magnetite (DDT product) concentrate  and transfer to a 100 ml container and add 10 ml of 
10% Na2O5S2 solution, heat in a water bath at 100oC for 10 mintes, and add 25 ml of molbidate 
of ammonia dissolved in sulfuric acid and reheat in a 100oC bath for 10 minutes, re-cool and 
add distilled water to the resultant product and measure P content by AAS.  
d.  Sulfur (S) – code LECO001: ~200mg of sample in a mixture of copper oxide, anhydrous          
sodium sulfate, sodium hydroxide, quartz and glass wool, and cellulose in a crucible is heated to 
1350oC in an oxygen current, and the resultant SO2 is analyzed for the sulfur content utilizing an 
ELTRA CS-800 analyzer. The detection limit for S assay is 0.01%. 
c. The elements (Na, Cr, Zn, As, Cu, Ni, Co, V and Ti) are variously analyzed for by 
digesting the sample in an acid bath (HCl-HNO3-HClO4-HF) and AAS analysis of the resultant 
product.  
 
13.5 Specific Gravity: SBX contracted the University of Chile Engineering Department to 
perform density or Specific Gravity (SG) tests on 71 selected pieces of core (each 12 - 25 cms 
in length and weighing 109 – 498 grams) plus 3 taken from the trench at the Esperanza zone. 
The core samples were taken at varying depths and FeT grades from drill holes DSGA-07 (15 
samples), DSGA-11 (49 samples) and DSGA-15 (6 samples). The tests performed utilized 
standard wax-coating techniques which resulted in SGs ranging from 2.33 to 4.92, and with FeT 
grades ranging from 3 – 68% FeT.  Figure 13.4 graphs the relationship between the FeT grades 
and the SGs of the samples tested. It is the author's opinion that the tests as performed, and as 
charted, provide a suitable basis for the proper estimation of the tonnages of the iron bearing 
material at the different grades utilized.  
 
It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation methods being employed and the analytical 
techniques being utilized are appropriate and to industry accepted standard practices.  The 
sample security that has been employed to date both in the field and at the Copiapo storage 
facility is adequate and acceptable. Anticipated future RC drilling should incorporate the use of 
both blanks and standards. The author has earlier recommended that appropriate the QA/QC 
be applied to future diamond drill sampling, with the insertion of duplicates, blanks and 
standards into the re-numbered sample stream after the crushed sample and the pulps have 
been prepared.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Data used in this report were obtained from Anaconda and were variously examined at the 
Anaconda core/cuttings storage facility and office in Copiapo, and in the SBX offices in 
Santiago. The author visited the San Gabriel Project site on May 30, 2008, and the sample 
preparation/storage facility in Copiapo on May 29 and May 31, 2008. Records, reports, maps 
and sections were reviewed in SBX's Santiago office as required subsequent to June 1, 2008. 
The Geoanalitica assay facility in La Serena was visited on June 27, 2008 and at which time 
meetings were also held with Nelson Rojas, Anaconda's consulting engineer who has 
performed the initial magnetite recovery tests on material taken from the Esperanza Zone. The 
author did not witness the drilling in operation, nor any of the sample taking or handling as a 
result of the fact that the drilling had been terminated prior to his being contracted to prepare 
this Technical Report.  
 
Records of analytical controls, basically the duplicate RC samples which were inserted into the 
sample stream at the drill site, were reviewed at both the Copiapo Sample Preparation facility 
and in SBX's Santiago office after the initial visit to Copiapo. All of the assay values were 
examined in SBX's Santiago office. This examination, along with the visit to the Geoanalitica 
laboratory in La Serena, was sufficient to determine that analytical procedures follow industry 
acceptable levels and that sample assaying was done in an established and ISO9000-2001 
accredited laboratory. 
 
14.1 Assaying: The author selected 6 drill hole sample rejects (Table 14.1) which were located 
at the storage facility in Copiapo with the objective of generally checking the sample 
preparation, homogenization and replication of the grades. The samples comprised 5 duplicate 
(twin) RC drill hole sample and 1 DD hole laboratory reject. The ~10 kg RC duplicates, and DD 
reject, were carefully homogenized twice through a sample splitter and then split down to 1.0 to 
2.7 kg samples which were inserted into numbered (author) plastic sample bags which were 
stapled shut. Both the splitter and the pans were always air blown and/or brushed dust free prior 
to processing the next sample. The author was present from the time the original rejects were 
collected, opened, split down, and the newly generated check sample re-numbered and stapled 
closed. The author then personally shipped the samples to Geoanalitica in La Serena with 
instructions that the results be submitted directly, and only, to him. The results of this check 
work and comparisons with the original results are listed in Table 14.1.

              The SBX samples were assayed for using 4-acid digestion and AAS; the author's 
samples were assayed for volumetric FeT. This initial, non-statistically valid, and very  limited 
check work which compared assays which were generated utilizing two different chemical 
techniques very generally confirmed that the work being by Geoanalitica was acceptable. 
Subsequently, and as described below, the FeT methods originally used were compared 
against composited intervals utilizing the volumetric technique which clearly established that the 
FeT results originally generated (AAS) were valid and  the FeT (AAS) assaying, as performed 
by Geoanalitica, is reliable and can be reasonably duplicated. 
 
Additional external check work (Andes Analytical Assaying - AAA, Santiago) for AAS FeT 
performed on 97 drill hole sample pulps has further confirmed the initial results generated by 
Geoanalitica, as documented in Table 14.2. Additional assay check work utilizing volumetric 
FeT assaying for the same 97 samples which is being performed by AAA have not been 
completed to the date of this report. Figures 14.1 is a scatter plot of the Geoanalitica vs AAA 
results which demonstrates that AAA confirms the Geoanalitica results.  The data has a 
correlation coefficient of 0.99, which is acceptable.

Anaconda sent 51 composited samples at grades ranging from <4% to 69% FeT to a laboratory 
in Minnesota with the objective of confirming the Davis Tube test work performed by 
Geoanalitica (Section 13). The 51 composited samples (RC and DD  rejects) were carefully 
homogenized and split to generate 3 (~500 grams) equivalent samples, of which one sample 
was sent to Midland Research Facility in Minnesota in the US for Davis Tube test work and FeT 
(volumetric) assaying of the recovered magnetite. The second set of samples was sent to AAA 
for additional check assaying, and the third set was re-submitted to Geoanalitica to reconfirm 
the quality of their own work. The assay and test results are pending.

A statistical evaluation of the (~5%) duplicate RC samples taken throughout the drill program at 
San Gabriel and over a broad range of values clearly demonstrates that Geoanalitica is 
consistent in its assaying and that the results obtained to date can be relied upon. Figure 14.2 is 
a Scatter Plot of paired duplicate FeT assays from the Reverse Circulation drill samples which 
are plotted along a regression line.  It shows that 99 percent of all samples lie along the 
regression line and which again confirms repeatability of the FeT values in the coupled samples. 
Furthermore, as demonstrated in Figure 13.3, the assaying of the quartz used to clean the 
crusher/grinding equipment at 10 sample intervals demonstrates that there is no significant FeT 
contamination of the drill hole samples.

The conclusions that can be drawn from this evaluation are as follows: 
 
• In general, and across a broad range of iron values, the Geoanalitica analyses for % FeT are 
reproducible (the samples generally cluster along the 1:1 line). 
• Despite the fact that Anaconda did not insert blanks and standards in the first phase drill program at 
San Gabriel, it is the author's opinion that the results are reliable and that the additional and extensive 
check work that Anaconda has subsequently performed adequately confirms this conclusion. However, 
Anaconda in the future should prepare and insert blanks and standards into the drill sample stream. 
• Anaconda did not insert any kind of check samples (blanks, standards ort duplicates) for the DD core 
samples that were submitted for assay. However, the results obtained are reproducible and generally 
correlate with the results obtained from the RC drilling. The author recommends that selected and 
representative sections of iron bearing core be quartered (sawed) and assayed as duplicate checks. This 
work would also serve as a check on the core orientations when prepared for sawing by the geologist. All 



  62

future DD drilling should implement proper QA/QC procedures for the proper confirmation of the core 
sample assay results. 
14.2 Drill Logs: The author check logged selected barren through mineralized intervals of the 
Anaconda DD and RC holes and determined that the pre-logging had been perfunctorily 
performed, and that it was most probably not useful for a proper interpretation of the geology, 
including metamorphism and/or metasomatism, alteration, structures and occurrence. This has 
subsequently been corrected and the logging has been properly performed. However, the initial 
estimation of the magnetite mineral content was generally properly done thus allowing for a 
degree of confirmation of the assay results being obtained, and which also assisted in the 
construction of preliminary interpretative cross sections. The cross sections have since been 
modified to reflect the geological interpretation that has been developed as a result of the 
improved knowledge of the geology.  
 
14.3 Specific Gravity Tests:  As indicated in Section 13, Anaconda took density measurement 
on 74 samples of Fe bearing material at grades ranging from ~ 3 - 68% FeT and established 
that the SG of the material ranges from 2.3 to 4.92 and that ~90% of the samples fall within + 
2.5% of the regression curve along which a mean density vs. grade can be selected. This 
conclusion is further supported by the calculated correlation coefficient (grade vs. SG) of 0.89, 
which supports the conclusion that the regression curve may be used to calculate reliable 
grade/tonnage (resources) figures.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
16.1 General: Anaconda initiated preliminary metallurgical tests on material taken from San 
Gabriel Zone, using Davis Tube Tests (DTT) to magnetically separate magnetite from samples 
composited over selected drill hole intervals, the methodology for which is described in Section 
13.4 Analyses. This preliminary laboratory scale testing was conducted with the intent of 
estimating magnetite recoveries of material assaying <20-70% (FeT), as well as to determine 
the levels of deleterious elements (contaminants) which might be contained in the magnetite at 
the grind (-325 mesh) utilized for the Davis Tube Tests.  
 
Contemporaneous with the DTT work, a metallurgical sample was taken by compositing bulk 
samples (1.5 tonnes each) extracted from four separate areas of outcropping magnetite bearing 
material at the Esperanza Zone. The intent in taking this material was to perform preliminary 
metallurgical tests on material that was readily accessible within the San Gabriel Project area. 
Pilot scale magnetic separation tests were conducted on this material at 2 different crush sizes 
and utilizing different magnetic drum concentrator rotation rates. Subsequently, Davis Tube 
tests were run on drill cuttings taken from the REZA-01 RC hole located in the proximity of 
where the material was taken for the bulk test.  
 
16.2 Davis Tube Testing: The bulk of the DTT work that has been conducted to date has been 
done on 68 composited cuttings and core samples from the San Gabriel Zone. The work 
generated the following data: 
 
• The % FeT in the DTT magnetite concentrate ranges between 66% and 70.4% and 
averages 69%; the theoretical maximum % FeT in magnetite is 72%, and therefore on average 
the DTT concentrates contain only 3% impurities, principally as SiO2 and Al2O3; 
• No significant impurities were obtained in the DTT magnetite concentrates from any of the 
zones. 
 
16.3 Esperanza Zone Pilot Scale Metallurgical Tests: Anaconda extracted 4 - 1.5 ton 
samples from outcropping to near surface material at 4 separate points within a 100m x 100m 
area which was transported to La Serena for preliminary pilot plant test work.  
 
The alluvium and near surface oxidized material to an approximate depth of 1 meter was 
removed and separated to produce a clean and representative sample. The material was drilled 
and blasted to generate blocks not greater than 15". The blasted material was thoroughly mixed 
using a front-end loader, separated into 4 separate sub-samples weighing 1.5 tons each, and 
transported to La Serena.  
 



  65

Two sets of tests were run on the samples taken (EM-0108), where by the first test comprised 
the magnetic concentration of material which had been crushed to 100% passing -1½" in 3 
stages, with the magnetite bearing material being rotated at 23 RPM, 28 RPM and 42 RPM. In 
the second test, the material was crushed to -100% passing 1" and the material variously tested 
for recoveries at the same RPMs as used in the first test.  
 
The following data has been translated and summarized by the author from a report prepared 
by Sr. Nelson Rojas (refer to Section 3 – Reliance on other Experts). The author assumes no 
responsibility for the accuracy or the contents of this report. 
 
Mr. Rojas has characterized the magnetite recoveries based on the results obtained from the 
last recovery stage i.e. a rotation rate of the magnetic drum of 42 RPM for the +1/4" fraction and 
for the -1/4" fraction. 
 
The difference in the magnetite recovery (FeMag) for the two grinds tested is minimal at 89.8% 
for the 1.5" material and only slightly improved at 92.3% for the 1.0" material. The head grades 
for the contaminants tested indicated that at least initially P, S, Al2O3 and SiO2 are high. 
Subsequent testing for contaminants in both the "lump" (=/> 6mm) magnetite and magnetite 
fines (< 3mm) indicates that these continued to remain high, and that the contaminants are only 
reduced to below generally market acceptable levels at the grind used for the DT (-325 mesh) 
tests (<0.05% P and < 1% SiO2).

Mr. Rojas considers that the Fe (magnetite) is readily separated and acceptably concentrated at 
the test crush sizes utilized, and that the contaminants S, SiO2 and Al2O3 are likewise readily 
acceptably reduced and removed with the waste. He further states that the magnetite product at 
these crushes meet specifications of two Chilean producers/users of Fe. However, the P 
content of the concentrates remains excessive, and he considers that additional assaying 
should be performed to determine areas within the Esperanza zone that may contain lower and 
acceptable levels of P.  
 
Mr. Rojas has recommended that additional test work utilizing dry crushing techniques should 
be performed with the objective of producing a pre-concentrate magnetite product which can 
then be variously tested to produce a high quality, low contaminant, 80% passing -325 mesh 
"pellet feed" product using a wet grind/magnetic separation technique.  Per Section 16.2, 
preliminary DTT tests on drill hole cuttings taken from the Esperanza zone indicated that such a 
product was feasible.  
 
SBX recently sent approximately 300 kgs of split core taken from Drill Hole No. DSGA-11 to the 
SGA test laboratory in Hanover, Germany for extensive and detailed metallurgical testing. Fifty 
nine samples, all of which assayed >20% FeT and up to 40% FeT, were sent in separate 
sample bags each containing two meters of the core.  
 
Subsequently, Mr. Rojas performed preliminary magnetic separation tests using the above 
described equipment on six 100 kg reject composites taken at 10m interval from RC hole REZA-
14, with the samples starting at 10-20m through to 60-70m. Prior to being magnetically 
concentrated, the head grade for each interval was assayed for % FeT (volumetric) and 
contaminants, and then the DTT magnetite concentrate was assayed for contained FeT and 
contaminants. The magnetic concentrate product of the magnetic concentrator belt was then 
screened, and the +6 mm and –6 mm material assayed for Phosphorous and FeT as shown in 
Table 16.3. The very preliminary conclusions that can be drawn from the assay work is that this 
test work suggests that the levels of contaminating phosphorous can be significantly reduced 
(most typically by approximately 50%) at a depth of 10 meters and below. Additional test work of 
this nature is required before firm conclusions can be drawn as to the quality of coarser product 
that may be produced at the Esperanza Zone.

17.0   MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
17.1   Mineral Resources: Mineral resources for the San Gabriel Iron Project mineralization 
were announced in a News Release by Anaconda Mining Inc., dated August 14th, 2008.  SBX 
consultants Martin Perez and Luis Olcay, geologists with extensive and widespread expertise in 
preparing resource estimations, were contracted to prepare an initial estimation of the resources 
that are considered to have been defined by the initial 2007-2008 drilling program conducted at 
the San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia Zones of the San Gabriel Iron Project. Eduardo Magri, 
PhD. and a Registered Engineer, was contracted by Anaconda to statistically evaluate the drill 
results that were generated for San Gabriel Zone and to confirm that the drill spacing as used 
was appropriate to estimate Indicated Resources. Dr. Magri's conclusions were based on the 
development of, and the results indicated by variograms. Dr. Magri who is independent of SBX 
and Anaconda is considered to be a Qualified Person under NI 43-101CP guidelines by virtue of 
his experience, education, and registration as a Fellow in the South African Institute of Mining 
and Metallurgy (SAIMM). The information used by Perez/Olcay for the resource estimations was 
supplied by SBX. The resource estimations were performed using cross sections. The 
geological interpretations and assumptions applied in the cross sections were verified, and 
confirmed, by the development of level plans and both of which were generated manually 
utilizing the geologic and assay data.  
 
17.2   Data: The data used was derived from 76 drill holes representing 19,756.95 meters of 
drilling, and approximately 8,699 drill sample assays.  The resources developed for the San 
Gabriel Zone are based on 5,987 samples taken from 37 holes drilled at 100 meter centers 
along 9 sections; 9 holes were drilled at 50 meter intervals in-between the principal 100 meters 
spaced sections with the objective of confirming the geological interpretation.   
 
The resources developed for the Esperanza Zone are based on 1,984 samples taken from 31 
holes drilled. Twenty-eight of the 28 holes were drilled on 30 meter centers, and along 4 
sections.   
 
The approximate surface dimensions of the San Gabriel and the Esperanza Zones are 800 
meters long x 100 - 200 meters wide and 500 meters x ~ 100 meters wide, respectively.   
 
The inferred resources estimated for the Antonia Zone are based on 209 samples taken from 
the RANTA 02, 03 and 04 holes which were drilled at 100 meters intervals along the 
northwesterly trend of the magnetic anomaly.  
 
The data utilized for the resource estimations comprise: 
 
• Excel spreadsheets which contain the complete database for all of the holes drilled since 
the start of the project in 2007.  This included the raw assay and trace element data, collar 
location data, down-the-hole surveys, geological drill logs, geotechnical information and specific 
gravity results.  



  69

• Drill hole location plans and sections. 
 
 
 
 
17.3   Geologic Model, Method, Procedures: The geologic models developed for the San 
Gabriel and Esperanza Zone deposits were based on a combination of drill hole data, assay 
data and the limited surface geologic material available as a result of the very extensive 
colluvial-alluvial cover:  
 
• Lithological boundaries were divided into three groups: 1) massive moderate-high grade 
magmatic magnetite; 2), high grade hydrothermally brecciated magmatic magnetite with 
magnetite breccia fill; and 3) porphyry intrusives or basement rock. 
• Topography was obtained from files derived from a combination of controlled remote 
sensing imagery and ground surveying. 
• The resource-grade categories were generated based on the average grade of material 
based on 5% FeT increments and beginning at a cut-off grade of 20% FeT (e.g. the 20% - 25% 
FeT interval) and increasing cut-off grade increments to a cut off grade of 40% FeT. 
• The assay data that has been used to estimate the resources comprise the assays 
which were derived using AAS. The comparative assay check work that has been performed to 
date and which compares the iron grades derived by AAS with those derived by volumetric 
analyses indicate that there is an excellent correlation between the two methods and the author 
therefore considers that the use of the AAS generated assays is appropriate (to date) at the San 
Gabriel Project. 
• The resultant grades were contoured per the average grade of the interval and taken 
half way to the next drill hole in the section and half way (or not greater than 50 meters) towards 
the next section. The minimum length of any drill hole interval used to generate an average 
grade (20% or greater FeT) was 8 meters. 
• Variograms which were constructed for the magnetite mineralization at the San Gabriel 
Zone confirmed that the holes drilled at 100 meters intervals were suitable to estimate Indicated 
Resources. The resources estimated for the Esperanza Zone mineralization were based on 
holes drilled at 30 meter centers, which allowed for these resources being conservatively 
categorized as Indicated; the author considers that pending variography for this Zone will 
establish that these resources probably warranted being categorized as Measured Resources. 
• Seventy-four Specific gravity (SG) measurements were obtained for magnetite bearing 
rocks at grades ranging from approximately 3% to 68% FeT. This work determined that the SGs 
ranged from 2.3 to 4.92 (i.e. increasing SG with increasing FeT (magnetite) content. Plus 90% 
of the samples taken for the SG studies fall within + 2.5% of the regression curve which was 
generated to establish and confirm the correlation between SG and the FeT grade of the rock, 
and which therefore allows that a specific mean SG value vs. % FeT can be selected for a 
specific FeT grade. The appropriate SG was then used to estimate the tonnage of material 
represented by the area generated about the average FeT grade of the drill hole interval.  
• Assays for various types of contaminants, including P, SiO2, Al2O3, S, etc., which were 
performed on magnetite concentrates derived from the Davis Tube tests indicate that the -325 
mesh magnetite from the San Gabriel and Esperanza Zones carries very low levels of such 
contaminants. 
 
17.4 Mineral Resource and Classification: To date, no economic evaluation has been 



  70

carried out on the San Gabriel Project estimated resources; therefore, no mineral reserves have 
been calculated.  Mineral resources that are not reserves do not have economic viability.

It is the author's opinion that the resources as estimated to date have been reasonably 
prepared, and that projected computer (Gemcom) generated estimations will continue to 
support this current estimation.  
 
An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  An 'Inferred Mineral 
Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be 
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, 
but not verified, geological and grade continuity. It can not be assumed that the Inferred Mineral 
Resources will be upgraded to an Indicated Resource as a result of continued exploration. 
Furthermore, it can not be assured that either the Indicated or the Inferred Mineral Resources 
will be converted to a "Reserve" category at such time as feasibility studies are initiated. 
 
Figures 17.1, and 17.2 are representative cross-sections developed for San Gabriel and 
Esperanza Zone deposits which were used to generate the resource estimations; the grade 
intervals are based on a combination of the drill hole geology (rock type-mineralization) and the 
assays results.

18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
Northern Chile is subject to occasional earthquakes which occasionally are very strong 
registering +6 on the Richter Scale. The author was unable to find any records with regards to 
earthquakes in the immediate vicinity of the San Gabriel Property. However, historically 
earthquakes on the order of +6 on the Richter Scale have been recorded in the general area 
and westwards towards the coast. 
 
The author is not aware of other factors which may influence the results of this report.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Anaconda initiated exploration at San Gabriel in September, 2007, and since then has 
completed over 19,700 meters of drilling in the San Gabriel, Esperanza and Antonia Zones of 
the San Gabriel Project.  This work has resulted in the initial definition of estimated resources 
within the three zones, which, using a cut off grade of 20% FeT, are as follows:  
 
• San Gabriel Zone: Indicated Resources - 53.6 million tonnes grading 31% FeT;  
• Esperanza Zone:   Indicated Resources -   4.3 million tonnes grading 41% FeT; 
• Antonia Zone:        Inferred Resources   -   2.6 million tonnes grading 29% FeT. 
 
The drilling, in conjunction with the magnetic data, that has been performed at the San Gabriel 
and Antonia Zones suggests that there is limited potential to expand these resources 
significantly; however, the magnetic inversion data for the Esperanza Zone suggest that the 
Esperanza may swing northerly and that there is a potential to double, or better, the resource 
potential along this extension.  
 
As a result of the originally close-spaced drill pattern which was executed at the Esperanza 
Zone i.e. 30 meter centers, it is the author's opinion that the (indicated) resources which have 
been drilled out to date require only statistical verification that the spacing is adequate to 
reclassify them as Measured Resources.  
 
The magnetic data that has been generated for the balance of the eastern block of the San 
Gabriel concessions suggest that there may be a potential to develop one, or more, small, but 
easily accessible, deposits which could contribute material to a potential operation in the event 
that the principal San Gabriel Zone were to be put in to production. 
Likewise, the magnetic data that has been generated for the westerly block of the Cotorras 
concessions at the San Gabriel Project suggests that there are at least 3 targets that warrant 
detailed geologic mapping which would be followed up by trenching, sampling and preliminary 
drilling, if warranted. 
 
It can not be assumed that Inferred Mineral Resources will be upgraded to Indicated or 
Measured Resources, or that the Indicated Resources will be upgraded to Measured 
Resources, as a result of continued exploration. Furthermore, it can not be assured that 
any of the Inferred, Indicated or Measured Mineral Resources will be converted to a 
"Reserve" category at such time as feasibility studies are initiated. 
 
Mineralization at the San Gabriel Project is hosted in a variety of rocks, the most significant of 
which are the metamorphosed-metasomatised Upper Jurassic andesitic volcanic/volcaniclastic 
rocks which may be occurring as a roof pendant in Low Cretaceous dioritic intrusives of the 
Coastal Batholith. Magnetite as veins, stockworks and sheeted vein systems is also hosted in 
the dioritic intrusives.  
 
Very preliminary metallurgical testing at the Esperanza Zone suggests that the immediate near 
surface material (to 10 meters depth) may not be amenable to generate a "lump" product as a 
result of having high levels of phosphorus. However, test performed incorporating drill hole 
samples suggests that at depths below 10 meters, crushing and magnetically concentrating the 
plus/minus 6mm fraction may generate a saleable product.  Davis Tube test work on drill hole 



  77

material taken from the San Gabriel and Esperanza Zones indicates that material ground to -
325 mesh generates a product which carries low levels of contaminants and which suggests 
that a marketable product could be prepared for making "pellet" feed. Selected high grade 
magnetite intervals from the San Gabriel Zone, Esperanza and Antonia should be cored with the 
objective of testing the San Gabriel Zone resources for the possible of generation of "lump" 
feed. Marketing studies should be conducted concurrently to determine if there is an adequate 
market for such material in Chile, or elsewhere. 
 
To date a total of approximately US $3.1 million has been spent on exploration at the San 
Gabriel Project. The first phase of the exploration program was completed in May, 2008. Based 
on the positive results that were generated in the Phase I Exploration Program, Anaconda has 
budgeted US $2.5 million for the Phase II Exploration Program which is scheduled to start in the 
forth-quarter of 2008. The objectives of the Phase II Program are to upgrade the resource 
categories at the San Gabriel and Antonia Zones, potentially increasing the resource where the 
west end Esperanza Zone swings northerly, and to map a number of the remaining un-tested 
magnetic anomalies that have been defined in the two sets of concessions that comprise the 
San Gabriel Project, and that might warrant drilling at a later stage. In additional Anaconda 
intends to drill 6 BQ DD holes with the objective of continuing metallurgical testing at the 3 
principal zones.

20.0     RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET 
 
After reviewing the exploration data that has been generated for the San Gabriel Project, it is 
the author's opinion that continued exploration and development of the San Gabriel Project, 
including in-fill and development drilling, and metallurgical testing in the San Gabriel and the 
Antonia Zones is warrant. In addition, it is the author's opinion that follow-up exploration, 
including mapping, trenching and sampling, is warranted on the additional un-tested magnetic 
anomalies which were defined by the geophysics. If this continued exploration returns favorable 
results, then the anomalies should be drilled.  
 
The San Gabriel Iron Project is of sufficient merit to warrant the following proposed exploration 
and development Program Budget which is designed to advance the definition of the iron at 
Anaconda's San Gabriel Iron Project.  
 
Anaconda has budgeted US $2.5 million for the Phase II exploration campaign at its San 
Gabriel Iron Project.  The Phase II program will include approximately 10,000 meters of RC 
drilling for infill drilling at the San Gabriel Zone to allow for the categorization of Measured 
Resources, drilling 6 diamond drill holes (BQ core) for metallurgical samples at the San Gabriel 
(4), Esperanza (1), and Antonia (1) Zones and, as well as to upgrade the resources and 
resource categorization at the Antonia Zone, and which will include additional metallurgical 
testing. The budget also includes initiating the environmental permitting process and the 
preparation of a preliminary economic assessment. Geological mapping is planned for the Area 
4 Sector with the objective of defining possible drill targets. The program is projected to begin in 
the forth quarter of 2008. 
 
Reverse circulation drilling and surface sampling and assaying costs are budgeted at US 
$900,000. Core Drilling (BQ) for metallurgical sampling is budgeted at US $500,000. 
 
Staff-related costs, including salaries, room, board, and travel, are budgeted at US $200,000.  
Mobile equipment costs, including bulldozers for road building and maintenance, as well as light 
and heavy trucks, are budgeted at US $200,000.   
 
Continuing metallurgical studies, the initiation of environmental studies, and a preliminary 
economic assessment are budgeted at US $300,000.  
 
The Chilean value-added tax (IVA) of 19%, or approximately US $400,000, is included in the 
budget. 
 
The proposed Phase II exploration program is considered by the author to be appropriate for 
this property considering the stage of development of the San Gabriel Iron Project and the 
success that the company has attained to date.

	a. Total (volumetric) Iron (FeT): ~0.4 grams (weighed on an analytical balance - 0.1 mg precision) of sample is dissolved in an acid bath comprising the following solutions - hydrochloric acid (HCl, d = 1.19 g/ml or ~ 37%); stannous chloride (SnCl2)- 10% by volume; saturated (50g/l) mercuric chloride (HgCl2); 0.2% by volume barium diphenylamonsulfonate; and, potassium dichromate (5.4 g/l); the sample is dissolved in 20 ml of HCl with a few drops of SnCl2 and the container covered and heated to 90oC, or just below boiling, for ½ hour; SnCl2 is again added a drop at a time until there it is slight (reddish) discoloration and a final drop is again added; ~150 ml of distilled water is then added and the solution allowed to cool; 5 ml of 5% HgCl2 is added and then after 5 minutes ~ 25 ml of HCl and a few drops of barium diphenylamonsulfonate are added to the solution. The resultant solution is titrated with potassium dichromate and the quantity of potassium dichromate is used to calculate the % FeT. The detection limit for the FeT assay is 0.05%.
