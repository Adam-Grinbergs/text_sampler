DISCLAIMER 

This disclaimer is an integral component of this Technical Report. It should be read in its entirety and 

must accompany every copy made of the Technical Report. 

This Technical Report has been prepared for Carpathian Gold Inc ("Carpathian") by NCL Brasil Ltda 

("NCL"). The Technical Report is based on information and data supplied to NCL by Carpathian and other 

parties and where necessary NCL has assumed that the supplied data and information is accurate and 

complete. 

The Technical Report is to the standard of a scoping study only and relies on assumptions regarding the 

process flow sheet, design criteria, engineering and cost. The Technical Report is not intended to be a 

definitive assessment of the financial viability of the project and further analysis of resources, reserves, 

metallurgical test work, geotechnical and plant engineering and costing are required for that purpose. 

The results of further work may indicate that the assumptions in this Technical Report need to be 

revised or reviewed. 

In accordance with the preliminary nature of the report, NCL has used estimates and approximations 

based on its experience and expertise. Where NCL has used estimates and approximations, it does not 

warrant the accuracy of those amounts. It should also be noted that all estimates and figures contained 

in the Technical Report will be prone to fluctuations with time and changing industry circumstances. 

The Technical Report should be construed in light of the methodology, procedures and techniques used 

to prepare the Technical Report. 

Sections or parts of the Technical Report should not be read or removed from their original context. 

Recognizing that Carpathian has legal and regulatory obligations, NCL has consented to the filing of the 

Technical Report with the Toronto Stock Exchange and its publishing on the SEDAR filing System.

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

1. SUMMARY 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 

Carpathian Gold Inc (Carpathian) commissioned NCL Brasil Ltda. (NCL) to undertake a 

Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Riacho dos Machados (RDM) Gold Project , 

located near the town of Riacho dos Machados in the northern region of Minas Gerais State, 

Brazil, and to prepare a Technical Report (TR) as defined in Canadian National Instrument 43-

101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and in compliance with Form 43-101F1. 

The PEA study was completed by NCL which led a consortium of consultants and specialists 

assembled by Carpathian for the Study. NCL was responsible for the preparation of the overall 

study as well as open pit mine design, mine capital cost, mine operating cost, and economic 

models. Other members of the consortium included: Golder Associates Brasil Consultoria e 

Projetos Ltda. that was responsible for the geotechnical and hydrological studies, the tailing 

impoundment, tailings dam and waste management design, and fresh water containment 

design, Tecnomin Projetos e Consultoria Ltda that was responsible for the design and costing 

for the process plant and infrastructure, and YKS Services Ltda. responsible for all aspects of 

the environmental and social impact, and permitting process for the project. The Study is 

based on an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate completed in July 2009 by NCL together 

with Carpathian staff. 

1.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, ACCESS AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Riacho dos Machados Property comprises one mining concession, twelve exploration 

licenses and one application for an exploration license, totalling 22,994.70 hectares of area. 

Almost the totality of the estimated mineral resources is located within the mining concession 

with 1000 hectares of area. A smaller part of the resource is located in an exploration license, 

immediately south of the mining license.  

In December 2007, Carpathian signed a Letter of Intent outlining terms for a Definitive 

Purchase Agreement whereby Carpathian would acquire 100% interest in the RDM Gold 

Project. The agreement was with Zoneplan Limited and Repalla Inc. (collectively the 

"Vendors") who then was the owner of the project through Melbourne Ventures Fund LLC 

through its wholly-owned subsidiary Mineração Riacho dos Machado Ltda. (MRDM). The 

Definitive Purchase Agreement was signed on October 30th, 2008, thus completing the 

transfer of the properties.  

The project is located approximately 145 kilometers by road northeast of the city of Montes 

Claros (population 336,000) in Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil.  

Access to the Project from Montes Claros is by 130 kilometres of paved road and 15 kilometres 

of all-weather gravel road. The nearest town is Riacho dos Machados (population 11,000) 

about 25 kilometres NE from the Project.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

The Project area consists of rolling hills, locally steep and drained by sparse intermittent 

streams. Elevations range from 770 to 900 metres a.s.l. 

The climate is tropical and semi arid with two seasons: a dry winter and a rainy summer, with 

the rains occurring between November and March. Annual rainfall is about 1,100 mm. 

The prevailing vegetation is a scrub brushy and low growth trees with open grassy areas. The 

area mainly supports eucalyptus tree farming and subsistence cattle ranches. 

1.3 HISTORY 

The Riacho dos Machados mine was discovered by DOCEGEO, the exploration branch of 

Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), a major Brazilian mining company recently re-named as 

Vale, through regional geologic investigations along the north-south trending eastern margin 

of the Sao Francisco Craton. In 1986, DOCEGEO discovered a surface gold oxide deposit known 

as the Ouro Fino Deposit, while investigating gold anomalies on highly metamorphosed 

volcano-sedimentary rock sequences of probable Archean age. Area. No gold had been 

previously produced in this region. 

The RDM Mine opened in 1989 as an open pit oxide ore gold operation with the ore processed 

by crushing and heap leaching with cyanide. It operated until 1997, producing 155,000 ounces 

of gold from 3.2 million tonnes of low-grade oxide ore (1.89 g Au/t) mined to an approximate 

depth of 30-60 metres. Exploration continued in the district until 1997 when the mine was 

closed as a result of low gold prices and the lack of interest of CVRD for gold.  

From 1997 to 2008 the property was submitted to reclamation activities by Vale, attending the 

requirements of the Minas Gerais environmental agencies. No exploratory or mining activity 

occurred during this period. 

In 2008 Carpathian started exploration activities following the Letter of Intent with the 

previous owners. From August to November 2008 it drilled 64 holes for 11,277 m and re-

sampled the core of 100 drill holes drilled previously completed by CVRD. Other exploration 

activities were also put in place to explore and evaluate the potential of satellite areas and the 

south and north extension of the RDM deposit. 

1.4 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

The mine is situated near the eastern margin of the São Francisco Craton, which is a tectonic 

unit affected by the Brasiliano–Pan-African event (locally denominated Brasiliano). The region 

is made up of Palaeoproterozoic granite–gneisses and amphibolites, Mesoproterozoic 

Espinhaço Supergroup units (continental rift-related rocks and shallow-water marine 

sequences), Neoproterozoic glacial units of the Macaúbas Group, Neoproterozoic shallow-

water, carbonate-bearing Bambuí Group and Brasiliano granites. The RDM deposit occurs in a 

shear zone hosted in the volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Riacho dos Machados Group. 

The local geology is composed of the following lithostratigraphic units:  



 3

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

1. basal migmatite gneiss complex with associated bodies of basic rocks; 

2. metavolcano-sedimentary rocks of the Riacho dos Machados Group (RMG), host to 
gold mineralization;  

3. supracrustal rocks of the Macaúbas Group  

4. granitic intrusives.  

The volcano-sedimentary sequence which hosts the mineralization is composed of the 

following units:  

1. Biotite (quartz-oligoclase-sericite) schist with staurolite and garnet  

2. Quartz-feldspar schist  

3. Quartz-muscovite schist— This unit is the principal host for the gold mineralization at 
the Riacho dos Machados Mine.  

4. Quartz-sericite/muscovite-biotite/chlorite schist. 

The gold mineralized body occurs as 'stacked' tabular horizons that are mostly concordant 

with the principal rock foliation (ductile shear zone with S-C mylonites). These tabular zones 

typically consist of a main zone (2-10 m true thickness) occasionally accompanied by with 

thinner footwall and hanging wall zones (1-5 m true thickness each) separated by 3-10 m of 

unmineralized rock. Mineralization at the RDM Mine occurs in a belt of hydrothermally-altered 

rock developed along a district-scale shear zone that extends almost 30 kilometres along strike 

in a N20°E strike direction and dips 40-45° east. The metamorphism is typical amphibolite 

facies mineral association (garnet-staurolite) which is progressively altered to greenschist 

facies assemblage (chlorite-muscovite) associated with mineralization. Gold mineralization is 

associated with disseminated sulphides (pyhhrotite, arsenopyrite and pyrite) within zones of 

greenschist facies alteration assemblages with some deformed quartz veinlets. Weathering 

and oxidation of sulphides occurs to depths ranging from 30-60 metres below the surface. 

1.5 EXPLORATION  

The exploration consisted initially of geological reconnaissance mapping and sampling, 

including stream sediment sampling and soil geochemistry (1978 to 1981) until the discovery 

of the mineralization. From 1982 to 1987, geological mapping, heavy mineral geochemical 

sampling and a regional airborne geophysical magnetic and electromagnetic surveys were 

performed, leading to the definition of four targets. The Ouro Fino target was defined as 

higher priority, with detail soil sampling defining a pronounced gold and arsenic anomaly that 

was followed up with a trench sampling and mapping campaign. Positive results led to shallow 

reverse circulation and diamond drilling which identified the target as a potentially viable oxide 

gold deposit after which, several drilling campaigns were performed totalling 339 drill holes 

(32,364 metres). The initial exploration and mining focus was on the weathered oxide gold 

mineralization which was later followed by exploration to evaluate the sulphide mineralization 

which included deeper drilling and the excavation of a 117 m deep shaft, followed by 730 m of 

galleries developed along the orebody. Mapping, channel sampling, underground drilling and

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

metallurgical sampling and test work were performed utilizing samples extracted from these 

workings. 

In 2008 Carpathian drilled 64 holes totalling 11,277 m and re-sampled the core of 100 drill 

holes previously drilled by CVRD, for zones identified as mineralized. Carpathian's objective is 

to evaluate the sulphide gold mineralization below the shallow open pits and along strike. 

1.6 METALLURGY SUMMARY 

The metallurgical test work performed by SGS in 2008 showed that approximately 90% of the 

gold can be recovered from the ore by utilizing a conventional crush, grind, CIL, and ADR 

process plant. The maximum gold extraction was achieved after 24 hours of leaching at a P80 

particle size of 74 microns. The cyanide consumption for the test work was about 1.8 kg 

cyanide per tonne of ore; however, as is generally the case once a project goes into a 

production scenario it can be anticipated that the cyanide consumption for the plant operation 

could be lower than the test work results and could be in the order of 1.2 to 1.5 kg sodium 

cyanide per tonne of ore. The work index of the sulphide ore ranges from 14.5 to 16.0 kWh/t 

as determined by the test work performed by Vale on the underground mineral samples. 

1.7 MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATION 

The results of a total of 166 diamond drill holes were utilized to prepare the July 2009 

Resource Estimate for the RDM deposit. This resource estimate was completed in 

conformance with NI 43-101 reporting guidelines. This resource estimate incorporates 

Carpathian's 2008 drilling results (64 dillholes for 11,277 m) and re-sampling of CVRD drill-core 

(102 drill holes, for 5,515 m of core re-sampled) that were available as of March 1
st

, 2009. 

All routine sample preparation and analyses used in this estimate were performed by ALS 

Chemex Brasil (ALS), near the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A comprehensive Quality 

Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program involving the use of coarse blanks, pulp blanks, 

standards and crusher-reject duplicates was instigated. The QA/QC programs meet or exceed 

standard industry practices. 

Prior to mineral resource estimation, NCL conducted data verification consisting of a site visit 

and database verification and audit of a minor portion of it, selected randomly. NCL found the 

database to be acceptably accurate and error free to be used in mineral resource estimation. 

To determine appropriate in-situ bulk density values, a total of 81 measurements were 

collected both related to lithologies, grades (mineralized and un-mineralized) and oxidation 

(weathering) to be representative of the deposit. The assigned value for the sulphide 

mineralization is 2.77 g/cm
3
 and for oxidized (weathered zone) 2.32 g/cm

3
. 

Geologic interpretation of cross-sections and plans along with Exploratory Data Analysis was 

used to make 3-d geologic solids. Within these geologic solids, 3-d grade-shells were 

interpreted and built. NCL utilized the GEMCOM® software for 3-d variography studies, grade 

interpolation of block models using ordinary kriging and validation procedures. In addition, an

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

open pit optimization program (Whittle FX) utilizing a gold price of US$ 800 per ounce, industry 

standard operating costs and 90% gold recovery was utilized to constrain the open pit 

resources. The cut-off grade of 0.30 g Au/t was used for the open pit resource estimate, both 

in the construction of the grade shell and also for the definition of mineral resource blocks 

contained within the Whittle envelope. Mineral resources below the open pit resource 

envelope were defined utilizing a cut-off of 1.0 g Au/t both for the grade shell and for the 

blocks to be considered mineral resources. A basic engineering analysis was used to exclude 

from the underground resource the zones that presently appear to be too isolated or low 

grade to justify development below the open pit resource, considering also a 20 metre thick 

crown pillar. The cut-off grade and other parameters chosen for the definition of the 

mineralized material with reasonable prospects of being economic (as per the CIM definition 

for mineral resources) were determined by giving consideration to the characteristics of each 

mineral zone, envisioned mining methods, approximate mining and milling costs derived from 

internal studies as well as comparables with similar deposits and results from early 

metallurgical test work. 

As of May 18
th

, 2009, the effective date of the resource estimate, resources amenable for open 

pit mining are estimated as 4.54 million tonnes in the measured and indicated categories 

grading at 1.84 g Au/t and 15.16 million tonnes grading 1.56 g Au/t in the inferred category. 

The underground resource amounts to 0.20 million tonnes indicated resource grading 3.31 g 

Au/t and 2.73 million tonnes inferred resource grading 2.84 g Au/t. The open pit resources 

include 762,700 ounces of gold in the inferred category and 268,800 ounces gold in the 

measured plus indicated categories. Combined open pit and underground resources include 

1,012,400 ounces gold in the inferred category and 290,200 ounces in the measured plus 

indicated categories. A table of grade and tonnage for various cut-off grades is presented in 

Section 17.

Table 1.7-1: Mineral Resources Table for the Riacho dos Machados Project 

Carpathian's drill program in 2008 focused on the mineralized shear zone for depths that could 

be mined with an open pit mining method. Historical drilling by CVRD demonstrates gold 

mineralization continues at depth below the open pit resource and is open. This widely spaced 

deep drilling is utilized to model the mineralized shear zone at depth and extending the 1 g 

Au/t gold cut-off grade shell to incorporate these drill holes resulted in 12 million tonnes of 

mineral termed 'geologic potential' at an estimated grade of 2.9 g Au/t (not a classified 

resource as per CIM Guidelines due to widely-spaced drillhole intercepts). This geologic 

potential is not included in the underground resources shown in Table 1.7-1. Additional drilling 

will be required to upgrade this geologic potential to a resource classification. 

1.8 PRELIMINARY MINING STUDIES 

This study is based on the current resource estimates, including Inferred Mineral Resources. 

The reader is cautioned that the open pit mining study is a preliminary assessment and it 

includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the 

economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral 

reserves. There is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized. No Mineral 

Reserves have been estimated. 

The mining study utilizes an owner operated conventional open pit mining methods with 

backhoe excavators, haul trucks, and auxiliary mobile equipment to support a mining 

operation that will produce a nominal 2.19 million tonnes per year of ore for the process plant 

and 25 million tonnes per year of waste. Optimization work led to the current pit design which 

is based on a final pit depth corresponding to a Whittle Pit Shell utilizing a gold price of 

US$ 704 per ounce. The final pit contains 15.2 million tonnes of ore at a mill feed head grade 

of 1.65 g Au/t and 159.5 million tonnes of total material, for a life of approximately 7.1 years.

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

This type of mining method is common in Brazil, so the project proponent has a significant 

local knowledge base from which to structure its open pit operation. Included in these 

operations will be normal drilling, blasting, loading and hauling activities, along with the 

supporting functions of dewatering, grade control and equipment maintenance. An average 

operating mining cost of US$1.15 per tonne of material has been applied for the pit 

optimization. The estimate of total mining costs for the life of mine is calculated to be US$1.16 

per tonne of material mined. 

The run-of mine (ROM) ore will be hauled from the open pit with 40 tonne haul trucks and 

dumped directly into the hopper that feeds the jaw crusher at a rate of 6,000 tonnes per 

calendar day or 2.19 million tonnes per year. Three stages of crushing and screening will be 

utilized to produce mineral with a P100 particle size of 19 millimetres. A storage silo will 

receive the final product of the crushing plant from where the material will be fed at a 

measured rate into a single stage ball mill. The final slurry product from the ball mill circuit will 

contain mineral particles with a P80 particle size of 74 microns and this product will feed a CIL 

storage tank at a slurry density of about 35% solids by weight. The pulp will be fed from the 

storage tank to the first or second of six CIL tanks containing a weak cyanide solution where 

the gold will be extracted from the mineral. Carbon particles contained in the CIL tanks will 

adsorb the gold to recover the gold from the solution. The carbon will be advanced counter 

currently to the slurry flow so that the loaded carbon in the first or second CIL tank will contain 

the highest concentration of gold. Fresh or recycled carbon will be added in the sixth tank. The 

loaded carbon will be advanced from the first or second CIL tank to a holding bin in the ADR 

plant from where it will be reclaimed and fed into the acid wash and stripping circuits to 

remove the gold from the carbon. The hot strip solution will flow from the pressurized strip 

vessel into a electrowinning circuit to recover the gold on cathodes. From time to time, the 

gold will be removed from the cathodes to be processed in an induction furnace to produce 

gold bars for sale. The production of gold bars will range from 8,000 to 9,000 ounces per 

month. 

In addition to the open pit study, a portion of the underground mineral resources directly 

below the open pit were reviewed as to their possible economic potential. A preliminary 

desktop analysis was carried out and indicated that a total of 4.0 million tonnes at 2.57 g Au/t 

for 332 thousand contained ounces, down to elevation 420 (approximately 250 m below the 

bottom of the open pit), could be considered as underground mineable resources.  The 

preliminary analysis indicates that this underground area needs to be further drilled out and 

evaluated as it can extend to the overall project life and further increase the NPV and the 

economics and cash flow of the project. 

The mining method proposed for this underground component of the gold mineralization is 

sublevel open stoping. Stopes will be 100% backfilled and no rib or sill pillars will be left except 

where geological structures dictate otherwise. A mining rate of 2,000 tonnes per day, 

equivalent to 730,000 tonnes per year, was selected. For the current recognised extension of

A simple cash flow financial model was created by NCL, based on its experience, utilizing the 

mine production schedule, associated gold grades, gold recoveries estimated from the 

preliminary metallurgical test program, and capital and operating costs as set out above. 

Base case gold price was a constant US$850 per ounce for all the life of mine, provided by 

Carpathian. 

The study entails a 6,000 tonnes per day to an industry standard carbon in leach and ADR, 

producing a total of 726 thousand ounces of gold over the mine life of 7.11 years. 

A constant tax rate of 15.25% was applied, including Federal incentives because of the region 

where the project is located, and royalties of 2% of revenue. 

The tax and government incentives for the project development were provide by Carpathian 

and have not been validated by NCL. The negotiations have not been finalized with the 

government and its agencies so that these values may change and any changes will be noted 

and included in the feasibility study. 

NCL has considered the cash flow on a 100% equity basis, i.e. no account has been taken of 

financing arrangements and associated costs.

1.10 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 

Conclusions 

NCL concludes that: 

• The mineable resource is estimated at: 15.2 million tonnes with an average mill feed head 
grade of 1.65 g Au/t at an average stripping ratio for the life of mine of 8.9 to 1 (not 

considering the preproduction period). 

• The project economics show a robust project with an after tax IRR of 27% and an NPV5 of 
US$ 99.7 million at a gold price of US$ 850 per ounce and an after tax IRR of 32% and an 

NPV5 of US$ 123.3 at a gold price of US$ 900 per ounce. 

• The total cost (not including capital re-payment and royalty) is US$ 428 per ounce 
(US$ 455 per ounce including royalty payment) and including capital re-payment is 

US$ 604 per ounce. 

• The mineral throughput rate at 2.19 million tonnes per year will generate an LOM average 
gold production of 102,000 ounces. 

• The preliminary calculations for the underground mine show a robust operation and will 
add value to the overall project economics. 

• The schedule to obtain the necessary Preliminary License (LP) and the Instillation License 
(LI) is reasonable.  With the LP, scheduled for Late October/early November of 2009, 



 11

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Carpathian can begin site work on the project. The LI is scheduled to be obtained during 

the 1
st

 quarter of 2010. 

The mineral resources here described are located mainly within the mine concession, with a 

small portion within the exploration permit, both properties of MRDM. It is reasonable to 

assume that Carpathian will comply with all legal and environmental requirements to open the 

mine and have been complying with environmental monitoring of the mine area since the 

acquisition of the project. The drilling work completed by Carpathian for the NI 43-101 

resource was performed in an orderly manner, using industry standards. Assumptions adopted 

for the re-sampling of the Vale drill core are adequate and should not incur any significant 

error. 

The limits of the deposit may be expanded through drilling along the shear zone which hosts 

the mineralization and additional mill feed could be obtained from exploration on several 

targets highlighted by the previous studies by Vale. The potential for new discoveries on the 

property is seen as significant, which could thereby increase the projected life of the proposed 

operation. 

Capital cost engineering estimates have been completed to an accuracy of +/-15% for a 

2.19 Mtpa open pit and industry standard carbon in leach and ADR (adsorption, desorption, 

and recovery) plant followed by a detoxification process prior to placing the tailings in an 

impoundment area. Based on the positive outcome of PEA an estimated US$125.5 million 

capital will be required to develop the project, including pre-stripping of 15 million tonnes and 

sustaining capital. The initial capital requirement for the project is US$112.9 million. 

The process of completing the engineering cost estimate to an accuracy of +/-15 is complete 

and to date, nothing of a material nature has arisen that would significantly affect the overall 

capital cost engineered estimate. 

Other than the tax incentives and other incentives that need to be further verified and refined 

during the feasibility study and assuming the successful category upgrade of the inferred 

resources at its respective grade, all other components of the PEA study are considered to be 

±15%, given that quotes, transportation, implementation costs, and others were obtained for 

the project considering the relatively short time frame required for its implementation. 

Recommendations 

Based on the positive results of the PEA, NCL recommends the following:  

 

• Perform additional drilling to upgrade the mineral resources within the open pit to 
reserves. 

• Prepare a feasibility study. 
• Optimize the open pit mining and production plan during the development of the 

feasibility study.

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

• Evaluate that portion of the underground resource that may be upgraded to an 
underground reserve with drilling as well as optimization plans to incorporate that 

mineralization into the overall project during the open pit operation. 

• Perform additional drilling to test high priority targets near the mine, including the south 
and north extensions of the mineral zone. 

• Complete the geotechnical and hydrological studies, including boreholes, for the open pit, 
water retention dams, process plant area, and water wells.  

• Perform dynamic and static acid rock drainage tests so that the results can be incorporated 
in the feasibility study. 

• Obtain the LP so that site works can begin before the end of 2009. The water retention 
dams are important structures to construct for the capture and retention of water during 

the wet season of November to March.  

• Perform additional metallurgical test work to confirm the 2008 test results. Power 
consumption and cyclone densities should br checked during the feasibility study. Finer 

grinds should be investigated to confirm extra 2-3% gold recovery that is suggested from 

existing data. 

• Prepare and submit the documentation for clearing and grubbing for the high priority 
areas: open pit mine, water retention dams.  

• Commence the acquisition of the key and long lead equipment and machinery. 
• Commence early acquisition of contractors to begin development of the water retention 

dams and impoundment areas. 

• Complete the acquisition of additional surface rights over the project area and convert 
that small portion of the open pit that currently lies within an exploration license adjacent 

to the current mining concession. 

• Complete the negotiations with the governments to maximize the incentives for the 
project development.  

The following activities necessary to complete a feasibility study need be carried out: infill 

resource definition drilling, geotechnical and metallurgical studies, and EIA-SIA work, and the 

acquisition of the LP and LI permits for the project.  

The total cost of the work program to be performed for the development of the feasibility 

study, including EIA, SIA activities, geotechnical work, update resource/reserve and in country 

costs is estimated at US$ 7.0 million of which US$ 3.2million is allocated for the resource 

definition drilling, which is currently underway as of the date of this report.

4.4 SURFACE RIGHTS 

In Brazil, surface rights are distinct from mining rights and must be acquired separately. The 

authors have been advised by Carpathian that the single Mining Concession on the Riacho Dos 

Machados Project comes with surface rights ownership for 266.6 hectares at the RDM mine 

site, which will allow future mining operations to proceed quickly with no royalty, as the 

mineral rights owner and surface rights owner are the same. In addition, Carpathian has 

informed NCL that a further approximately 310 hectares of surface-right ownership contiguous 

with the previous surface rights has been acquired by Carpathian in early 2009, for a total area 

of 476.6 hectares. The 12 areas of the Exploration Licenses and the single Application for 

Exploration License, carry no surface ownership rights and access to the properties and 

reclamation of disturbed areas must be negotiated with the individual surface owners. This is 

commonly not a significant encumbrance as Brazil's Mining Code sets the limits of 

compensation to be paid to the surface owner. A detailed summary of the Brazilian Mining 

Code as regards the rights and obligations of Exploration License holders concerning Surface 

Rights is provided in an appendix at the end of this report. 

4.5 ROYALTIES 

Certain royalties are levied on mineral production in Brazil in accordance with Federal law. The 

current statutory royalty imposed by the federal government on gold properties is 1% of sales 

proceeds less sales tax, transportation and insurance costs. In addition to the government 

royalty, a royalty must be paid to the landowner if the surface rights do not belong to the 

mining titleholder. This landowner royalty is equal to one-half the government royalty, which 

in the case of gold would amount to an additional 0.5%. The RDM Gold Project comes with 

surface rights ownership for a 266.6-hectare area at the RDM mine site, so any mineral 

production from that portion of the project area will carry no landowner royalty. 

Carpathian informs NCL that the RDM Gold Project additionally carries a 1% royalty on gold 

and a 2% royalty on other metals payable by Mineração Riacho dos Machado to Mineração 

Brilhante Ltda.

5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 

The Riacho dos Machados Project is approximately 145 kilometers by road northeast of Monte 

Claros in the northern part of Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Monte Claros 

(population 336,000) is the region's largest industrial city, offering full service facilities and 

daily commercial air flights to the major Brazilian cities of Belo Horizonte (560 km from 

project), Brasília and Salvador. Access to the Project from Monte Claros is by 130 kilometers of 

paved road and 15 kilometers of all-weather gravel road (Figure 5.1-1). The nearest town is 

Riacho dos Machados (population 11,000) about 25 kilometers northeast from the Project.

5.2 CLIMATE, PHISIOGRAPYHY, FLORA AND FAUNA 

The climate is tropical with an annual average temperature of 24.2ºC and a rainfall of about 

1,100 mm per year (Figure 5.2-1). The vegetation of the region is mainly cerrado (low shrubs 

and small trees with savannah type grasses) with areas of transition between cerrado and 

caatinga (Figure 5.2-2 and Figure 5.2-3). 

The Project is within the Espinhaço Mountains (Serra do Espinhaço) that divide the São 

Francisco and Jequitinhonha river basins. The terrain consists of rolling hills, locally steep and 

drained by sparse intermittent streams, mainly active in the wet season. Elevations range from 

770 to 900 metres above sea level.

5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

During the years when CVRD operated the Riacho dos Machados mine (also known as the Ouro 

Fino Mine), labour was provided from the nearby towns of Riacho dos Machados and 

Porteirinha. Infrastructure remaining in place at the mine site includes an active 13.8 kilovolt 

power line and right-of-way, a 120-metre deep exploration shaft (2.8-metre diameter) with 

head frame, warehouses, housing facilities and various other buildings, including core storage. 

The old open pits and underground workings are now filled with water, and the waste dumps 

and leach pads have been reclaimed and re-vegetated. Cyanide monitoring stations remain in 

place. The Mining Concession remains in-place with a 'suspension for re-evaluation' status. 

More widely, and within the state of Minas Gerais, many mining related services are available 

ranging from drilling and mining contractors to technical geological and engineering consulting 

firms which operate at world-class standards.

6. HISTORY 

The Riacho dos Machados mine lies in a scantly explored area with no previous mining 

production in the area prior to the gold discovery by Vale. It was discovered through regional 

geologic investigations along the north-south trending eastern margin of the Sao Francisco 

Craton. The only other known mineral deposit in the area is a small unmined massive sulphide 

deposit (Salobro) about 30 kilometres north of the mine, but the nearest producing mines are 

150 kilometres north in the greenstone belts of the Capim and Urandi-Licino de Almeida areas 

and 300 kilometres south in the Iron Quadrangle. 

6.1 PROJECT EXPLORATION 

In 1976, the Brazilian government in partnership with Prospec S.A. and Companhia Vale do Rio 

Doce ("CVRD) completed a geological mapping study covering parts of several states in 

southeastern Brazil including the northern part of Minas Gerais State. The large Eastern 

Tocantins River and Western Sao Francisco River region which includes the current Riacho Dos 

Machados Project area. Based on the results of this regional geological program, DOCEGEO, 

the exploration branch of CVRD, initiated a geological reconnaissance program in northern 

Minas Gerais in 1978 in order to identify geological environments potentially favourable for 

gold and base metals mineralization associated with the region's greenstone belt sequences.  

DOCEGEO'S reconnaissance in this region, referred to as the Riacho Dos Machados Project, 

focused on several highly metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary rock sequences of probable 

Archean age exposed in a basement window through low-grade metamorphic Proterozoic-age 

supracrustal rocks. In 1986, DOCEGEO discovered a surface oxide gold oxide deposit known as 

the Ouro Fino Deposit. This discovery was subsequently opened in 1989 as the Riacho dos 

Machados Mine open pit oxide gold heap-leach operation. Exploration continued in the district 

until 1997 when the mine was closed as a result of low gold prices and the changing of focus of 

CVRD to iron ore and base metals.  

As mentioned in the item 4.3 (Title Agreements and Ownership), the mineral rights of the 

exploration area, including the mining concession covering the Riacho dos Machados mine, are 

currently held by Mineração Riacho dos Machado Ltda, which is a 100% property of 

Carpathian, as NCL was advised. 

The following is a chronological summary of the exploration work carried out by 

DOCEGEO/CVRD in the Project area: 

1978 to 1981 — Geological reconnaissance mapping and sampling, including stream sediment 

sampling and soil geochemistry. This work identified several arsenic and gold anomalies 

including the Ouro Fino and Passagem Nova targets. 

1982 to 1987 — Follow up work focused on the Ouro Fino target and greenstone sequence. 

Geologic mapping at 1:25,000 scale, heavy mineral geochemical sampling of major drainages, 

reconnaissance rock sampling and mapping, and petrographic studies were all carried out

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

during this period. Additionally, a regional airborne geophysical magnetic and electromagnetic 

(EM) survey that was flown in 1984-1985. These programs identified four principal target 

areas: Ouro Fino, Passagem Nova, Malhada Vermelha (Mato da Roca) and Rochedo . 

Detailed soil sampling initiated in 1985 over the Ouro Fino target area delineated a 

pronounced NNE-SSW trending gold anomaly, 1,700 m long x 100 m wide and carrying up to 

7.65 g/t gold. This soil anomaly together with results in follow-up trenching marks the 

discovery of the Ouro Fino gold deposit.  

The Ouro Fino anomaly trend was subdivided into five blocks — I, II, III, IV, and V (from south 

to north) — and then mapped, sampled and trenched in detail. More than 1,700 soil samples, 

almost 100 rock chip samples and more than 3,700 trench channel samples along the anomaly 

trend. The trenches were each 2 to 3 metres long and spaced 25 to 50 metres apart. In blocks 

III, IV and V, this trenching together with shallow diamond core and reverse circulation (RC) 

drilling, was used to define the oxide gold zone later was later mined in the Riacho dos 

Machados open pit operation.  

 
1988 to 1994 — Based on results of the Ouro Fino target drilling and evaluation program, 

CVRD determined the shallow oxide gold zone was a viable gold deposit. Drilling was initiated 

in 1987 and continued until 1993-1994. Several drilling phases were completed, including: (a) 

RC drilling to define the oxide gold reserve definition and test other exploration targets, (b) 

diamond core drilling to explore and deeper sulphide mineralization, and (c) underground 

drilling in the south part of the open pit area to further define the deeper sulphide gold zone. 

A total of 339 drill holes (32,364 metres) were drilled. An additional 102 shallow holes (± 50 

metres depth) are also mentioned as having been drilled to help define the oxide gold ore 

reserve. Details of the drilling completed on the Riacho dos Machados Project are provided in 

Chapter 11 of this report. 

 

1994 to 1998 — Concurrent with mine development and mining (discussed in Section 6.2 

below), CVRD/DOCEGEO conducted exploration with two objectives:  

• Find additional near-surface oxide gold resources in outlying areas within a 30-
kilometer radius of the mine.  

• Define and evaluate sulphide gold resources extending below the Riacho dos 
Machados Mine oxide gold open pit operation. 

Most of the outlying shallow targets examined during this period appear to require further 

work. The results of the exploration on these targets are discussed in the Exploration Chapter 

of this report. The results of the sulphide gold resource exploration are discussed in the 

following Section 6.3 of the current History Chapter.

6.2 OPEN PIT MINING 

CVRD began the Riacho dos Machados mine operation in 1989. Oxidized gold ore was mined 

and processing by cyanide heap-leach until 1997 when operations ceased. The mine began as a 

hillside mine and eventually developed into an open pit 1,350 metres long x 110 metres wide x 

80 metres deep. It opened with an estimated reserve of 2.7 million tonnes of ore averaging 

2.22 g Au/t, but the production over life of the mine was 3.2 million tonnes of ore at an 

average head grade of 1.74 g Au/t. The larger tonnage and lower grade are attributed to a lack 

of mining selectivity due to unexpected hardness of the rock. The average waste to ore strip 

ratio over the life of the mine was 2.14. The ore was processed by heap leaching with an 

alkaline solution of sodium cyanide and adsorption in activated carbon columns. The leaching 

cycle for each 6 metre high ore pile was 2 months, including cyanidation, washing and 

neutralization. According to the historical records, the average gold recovery over the life-of-

mine was 86%.  

6.3 UNDERGROUND EXPLORATION 

During the open pit operation, CVRD did considerable exploration to evaluate potential 

beneath the shallow oxide gold zone for a non-oxidized sulphide gold deposit that might be 

amenable to an underground mining operation. This work, consisting of deep surface drilling 

combined with underground sampling and drilling, resulted in defining a sulphide gold 

resource. Studies of the metallurgy, mining and economics of this underground resource were 

subsequently carried out by CVRD's exploration team and SUTEC (Superintendencia de 

Tecnologia da CVRD) with assistance from Minere Engenharia Ltda., Paulo Abib & Kilborn Ltda., 

and Sermin Serviços de Mineração Ltda. during the period 1993 to 2001.   

6.3.1 Deep Diamond Drilling Program 

Several campaigns of diamond core drilling — identified as F, SUF, SU and FD — were used to 

evaluate the deep gold mineralization below the open pit. DOCEGEO carried out the "F" 

campaign, CVRD carried out the other campaigns. The "F" campaign, initiated in 1987, was

designed to examine the continuity of the surface oxide gold mineralization defined by surface 

trenching and previous drilling. This campaign consisted of 140 drill holes spaced 50 to 150 

metres apart in four long sections. A fifth section consisting of 5 deep holes was done to test 

continuity of mineralization down to the 540 m level, approximately 360 metres below the 

bottom of the open pit (elevation of 800 metres). Of the 145 total holes drilled in the "F" 

campaign, 86 holes (13,849 metres) were used to evaluate the deeper underground 

mineralization; 77 of these were vertical holes (12,925 metres) and 9 were inclined (-60°, 924.5 

metres, -60°). 

The "SUF" campaign was a detailed pre-mining evaluation of the oxide surface reserves. Of the 

102 core holes drilled in this campaign, only 7 holes (359 metres) were used in the 

underground resource evaluation; 2 of these were vertical (190 metres) and 5 were inclined 

(169 metres, -60°). 

The "SU" campaign consisted of core holes drilled from underground galleries and were used 

to guide the heading and openings of the underground workings. A total of 64 holes were 

drilled (2,330 metres) of which 10 holes (436 metres, variable orientation) were used in the 

underground resource evaluation.  

The "FD" core holes, drilled in 1992 to 1994, were the last to be drilled on the Project. They 

were designed to provide in-fill detail to the previous drilling and to extend the mineralization 

between the 540 m and 250 m levels, approximately 360 to 550 metres beneath the bottom of 

the open pit. A total of 27 holes were drilled (9,138 metres) of which 18 holes (2,932 metres) 

were vertical and 9 holes (6,206 metres) were sub-vertical (-75° to -85°).  

6.3.2 Underground Exploration Development 

A program of underground exploration was launched in 1993 and 1994 to examine and verify 

the deeper gold mineralization beneath the southern portion (block III) of the open pit. Block 

III was chosen for this program because of the amount of available information and its regular 

structural and geologic features. The work consisted of a vertical access shaft and a series of 

underground exploration galleries, as described below: 

Exploration Access Shaft — Access for the underground exploration was via a 117-metre deep 

vertical shaft (2.8-metres diameter) located 80 metres east of the open pit (local coordinates 

9774N-5219E). The shaft bottomed at the 730 m level, approximately 60 metres below the 

bottom of the open pit. A 16-metre tall metal head frame is still in place on the property at the 

site of the shaft. The winch and hoist (no longer in place) were reportedly capable of moving 

260 tonnes of material per day.  

Underground Galleries — A total of 730 metres were excavated from the 730m level 

underground, including the level gallery, crosscuts and drifts. The workings averaged 2.5 

metres wide x 2.2 metres high, sufficient for the use of LHD equipment. The mineralized zone 

was reached from the bottom of the shaft at the 730 m level via a 65-metre long crosscut 

tunnel. From that point, a drift tunnel tending approximately N20°E was driven 199 metres 

north and 267 metres south along the mineralized zone. Short crosscut tunnels were made at 



 26  

 

 

26 

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

various places along the drift for additional sampling and drill stations. A total of 64 directional 

core holes (33 mm diameter) totaling 2,330 metres were drilled from these underground 

workings. The workings were mapped and sampled from hanging wall to footwall across the 

mineralized zone with 8-centimeter wide channels spaced 2.0 metres apart along the zone. 

The length of each sample varied from 0.3 to 1.0 metres depending on geological criteria. 

Metallurgical Sampling — Six bulk samples from various parts of the underground workings 

were collected and submitted for metallurgical testing. Initial test work was completed in 1994 

with follow-up work completed in 1995-1996. Results of this work are described in Chapter 16 

of this report. 

6.4 HISTORICAL UNDERGROUND RESOURCE ESTIMATION 

During the period 1994 to 1998, CVRD conducted or commissioned a number of pre-feasibility 

studies regarding the metallurgy, mining methods and capital-operating costs for the 

underground sulphide gold resource. In 1996, CVRD completed a mineral resource estimate for 

the sulphide gold zone in conjunction with a preliminary economic assessment for an assumed 

underground mining operation.  

The resource calculation was done manually by polygonal methods in long section, typical of 

methods then used to estimate resources in thin tabular bodies such as shear-controlled 

deposits or vein systems. A geologic model of the mineralization occurring as several steep 

plunging shoots with an average strike of 142° and dip of 38° was built using drill and 

underground data plotted on a series of close-spaced cross-sections. The parameters used 

include the following: 

a) Minimum grade cutoff of 2.0 g Au/t 
b) Minimum thickness cutoff of 1.50 metres 
c) Ore density of 2.8 g/cm3 
d) Resource area limited to maximum 550 metres vertical extent (from the pit 

bottom at 800 metre elevation to 250 metre elevation). 

CVRD categorized the resource as Measured, Indicated and Inferred according to the following 

criteria: 

Measured Resource — Restricted to the area from the base of the open pit (800 

metres elevation) to 30 metres below the 730 m underground drift — a total vertical 

range of approximately 100 metres. 

 

Indicated Resource — Includes blocks located at the base of the open pit (800 metres 

elevation) to the 500m level with information from the open pit mining and diamond 

core drill holes which lies outside the area of influence of the 730m level gallery drifts. 

 

Inferred Resource — Represents mineralization intersected in drill holes between the 

500m and 250m elevation levels.

• Access — An inclined ramp (-15°) was determined to be the most feasible means to 
gain access to the underground deposit, although access via a vertical shaft showed 

some economic advantages at depths below the 500m level. 

• Mining method — Cut-and-fill with hydraulic filling was shown to be appropriate for 
the type of equipment envisioned and for either an inclined ramp or vertical shaft 

scenario. 

• Ore processing — Metallurgical tests (summarized in Chapter 16 of this Technical 
Report) indicated that a substantial portion of the gold is enclosed in quartz and in 

sulphide minerals, requiring the ore to be crushed to minus 2 mm to allow efficient 

recovery by cyanide heap leaching. Cyanide column leach tests suggested gold 

recoveries for this material would be 81%. In 24-hour cyanide bottle roll tests of much 

finer grind (–200 mesh = 0.074 mm) recoveries up to 92.8% were achieved. The work 

suggested that a CIP process could be used for gold extraction, but this option was 

rejected by CVRD as being too expensive at the time. 

• Economic analysis — CVRD did an economic evaluation based on: (a) an 11.4-year 
underground mine producing 340,000 tonnes of ore per year; (b) an assumed geologic 

resource of 3.77 million tonnes with a head grade of 4.61 g Au/t; (c) mining dilution of 

10%; and (d) ore processed by cyanide heap-leaching. Initial capital costs were 

estimated to be approximately US$15 million and operating costs were assumed to be 

about the same as CVRD's other comparable operations, approximately US$25/tonne.  

• Roscoe Postle Associates (RPA) was contracted by Verena Minerals Corp. in 1996 to 
reassess CVRD's evaluation for a possible purchase of the RDM Mine from CVRD. In 

evaluating the sulphide resource, RPA reduced the head grade to 3.50 g Au/t believing 

that the CVRD grade was over-estimated by 20% and the dilution factor was under-

estimated by 10%. RPA based this on a reconciliation of historical production vs. 

reserves in the oxide gold operation and a comparison of underground sampling 

grades vs. drill-indicated gold grades.  

• Using only slightly higher initial capital costs and operating costs than in the CVRD 
evaluation, and based on a gold price of US$386/ounce, the RPA analysis indicated 

that the RDM operation, using a heap leach processing scenario, would generate only 

a very slight profit (IRR of 0.38%), and using a CIP processing scenario it would operate 

at a loss.

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY AND TECTONIC EVOLUTION 

The Riacho Dos Machados Gold Project occurs in the north-south trending Araçuaí Fold-Thurst 

Belt along the eastern margin of the São Francisco Craton, a major Archean-age basement 

block that underlies more than one million square kilometers in eastern Brazil (Figure 7.1-1). 

The Araçuaí Fold Belt is 15 to 45 kilometers wide and comprised of a series of metavolcanic-

metasedimentary rocks of late Archean to late Proterozoic age which were deposited in a 

broad intracontinental to oceanic rift-type basin that existed between the São Francisco 

Craton and the Congo Craton (now part of Africa). Subsequent closure of this rift basin by 

prolonged continental collision strongly deformed the rock strata and the units were 

metamorphosed, folded, intruded and thrust westward against the São Francisco Craton 

forming the Aracuai Fold-Thrust Belt during the late-Protereozoic Brasiliano orogeny. (Alkmim, 

et.al., 2001, Monterio, 2004). Mineralization along the Araçuaí Fold Belt is thought to be the 

result of hydrothermal fluids generated by syntectonic igneous and metamorphic activity. 

Immediately east of the Aracuai Fold Belt occurs a North-south trending structural window 

(300km long) cored by an Archean-aged migmatites (Porteirihna Complex) and flanked by 

apparent décollemont structures and Proterozoic supracrustal sequences (Espinhaco and São 

Francisco Supergroups) forming a regional antiformal structure (Figure 7.1-1). This structural 

window has been termed the Guanambi-Corretina Block by Barbosa (1996) or the Porteirinha 

Complex by DOCEGEO (1994). At the Riacho dos Machados Mine, basement gneissic-granitic 

rocks are interpreted to be overthrust westward on the supra-crustal rocks of the Riacho dos 

Machados group as part of the Brasiliano-Pan-African event. The tectonic superposition of 

basement rocks over supracrustal sequences is described along the entire eastern border of 

the Sao Francisco Craton with mineral occurrences known along this lineament.  

The major Precambrian rock sequences included in the Araçuaí Fold Belt, in order of oldest to 

youngest, are as follows: 

• Porteirinha Complex — (also known as the Córrego do Cedro metamorphic complex) 
Archean age granite-gneiss and migmatite basement complex, includes minor meta-

mafic intercalations and tight N-S folds, part of a poorly understood tectonic block 

immediately east of the São Francisco Craton;  

• Riacho dos Machados Group — Late Archean to Early Proterozoic age strongly 
metamorphosed volcanic-sedimentary rock sequence comprised of mafic to ultramafic 

rocks with mica schist and quartz-feldspar schist; this sequence contains a local rock 

sequence, the Ouro Fino Sequence (discussed in Section 7.2, below) which is the 

principal host for gold deposits in the Riacho dos Machados Project;  

• Paciencia Intrusive Suite — Early to Middle Proterozoic age bodies of granite, quartz 
monzonite, quartz-diorite, diorite and gabbro which intrude the Riacho do Machados 

Sequence; syn-to-late metamorphic deformation;

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

• Espinhaço Supergroup — a thick supracrustal sequence of Middle Proterozoic age 
moderately metamorphosed sedimentary-volcanic rocks, mainly sericitic quartzite, 

phyllite, conglomerate and schistose felsic volcaniclastics;  

• Salinas, Macaúbas and Bambuí Groups — sequences of Late Proterozoic age weakly 
metamorphosed sedimentary rocks, variably consisting of slates, meta-siltstones, 

phyllites, meta-arenites, quartzite (locally iron rich) and greenstone. 

  

Riacho dos Machados Group (RMG)- The supracrustal late-Archean to early-Proterozoic rocks 

of the RMG are hosted within the Córrego do Cedro Archean gneissic-dome complex. The RMG 

is highly sheared and exhibits sheared contacts. The protoliths for the RMG are interpreted 

predominantly as meta-sedimentary (metapelite), meta-volcanic and undifferentiated Meta-

volcanosedimentary Units host the Ouro Fino Gold Deposit. 

• The meta-sedimentary Unit is dominated by pelitic schists (quartz-biotite) with variable 
portions of plagioclase, garnet, staurolite and kyanite. Quartzofeldspathic schists occur 

in subordinate proportions and are composed essentially of plagioclase, quartz, 

phlogopite and microcline, according to Fonseca (1993) this lithology type corresponds 

to a metamorphosed volcanoclastic rock. 

• The undifferentiated meta-volcanosedimentary unit consists of intercalated 
metasediments and metavolcanic rocks in the form of titanite-bearing amphibolites 

and chlorite-talc-tremolite-, garnet-biotite-chlorite- and carbonate-serpentine-

chlorite-tremolite schists. Fine-grained amphibolites and mafic/ultramafic schists are 

also intercalated with the metapelites and shearing has produced schistose rocks 

predominantly composed of chlorite and muscovite.

The principal hosts for mineralization in the Ricacho dos Machados Project are locally mapped 

as the Ouro Fino Sequence and comprise part of the regional Riacho dos Machados Group 

described in Section 7.1, above. Based on 1:2,500-scale geological mapping in conjunction with 

drill hole logging, the Ouro Fino Sequence is subdivided into four distinct lithological units as 

follows: 

a) Biotite (quartz-oligoclase-sericite) schist with staurolite and garnet — This is 

a medium to coarse-banded unit (bands up to metres thick) consisting of 

chloritized biotite (25-30% including 5-15% muscovite), moderately to strongly 

sericitized oligoclase (15-30%), and quartz (35-40%). Staurolite and garnet 

occur in separate bands. The staurolite clasts (up to 1 cm or more in size) are 

moderately to strongly sericitized and occasionally chloritized. Other Accessory

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

minerals include tourmaline, rutile, apatite, ilmenite and epidote, with rare 

zircon and carbonate crystals. Petrographic studies suggest the protolith 

(original rock) for this unit was a pelitic sediment. 

b) Quartz-feldspar schist — This unit has a more restricted occurrence the other 

units in the central-north portion of the area, consists of quartz, sericitized and 

kaolinized oligoclase (40-47%), phlogopite mica (2-8%), microcline (3-5%), and 

muscovite (altered from phlogopite). The schist is gray (white when 

weathered) and has sparse fine-grained pyrphyro-clastic texture within 

moderate to well developed mylonitic foliation. The protolith is considered 

to have been a felsic volcaniclastic rock. 

c) Quartz-muscovite schist — This unit is the principal host for the gold 

mineralization at the Riacho dos Machados Mine. It is considered to have 

formed by hydrothermal activity in a shear zone from potassic alteration of the 

biotite schist and quartz-feldspar schist units. The rock is white to clear 

greenish in color (yellowish-white when weathered) and consists 

predominantly of approximately equal, but variable, amounts of quartz and 

muscovite. Chlorite is also present in variable amounts, together with small 

amounts of siderite or calcite and up to 5% sulphide minerals occurring as 

pyrrhotite, pyrite, arsenopyrite and rare chalcopyrite, sphalerite. 

d) Quartz-sericite/muscovite-biotite/chlorite schist — This unit is probably a 

transition zone lithologic unit formed from the partial hydrothermal alteration 

of the biotite schist and quartz-feldspar schist units. Contacts with the other 

units are gradational. 

7.3 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY 

The regional geology map patterns of the Riacho dos Machados Group (RMG) consists 

intercalated bands or beds up to 6 kilometers long within the gneissic basement and elongated 

north-south, parallel to strike of the Araçuaí Fold Belt. The mica schists of the RMG, which host 

the gold mineralization, demonstrate a well developed planar foliation with mylonitic shear 

fabrics common throughout the mine area. The predominant shear fabric and foliation strike 

20° and dip 35-45° southeast. Previous workers have suggested gold mineralization occurs 

within a shear zone of 200 m wide bounded by generally concordant thrust faults dipping 

between 30° and 40° toward 115° (Belo, 1992 in Fonesca, 1993). In general the lithological 

contacts are parallel to these thrust faults with wall rocks consisting of biotite schist, gneisses, 

and granitic rocks. Rock units along the shear zones are silicified, sericitized and sulphidized. 

Gold mineralization occurs as distinct tabular zones concordant with metamorphic and shear 

foliation with a present know continuous strike extent of 2,000 m at the mine site. Geologic 

mapping and a linear trend of anomalous Arsenic-in-soil extends northward from the mine for 

a further 10 km along structural strike.  

Three major thermal-tectonic events are recognized in the area: a) Archean, b) Middle 

Proterozoic (Transamazonic), and c) Late Proterozoic (Brasiliano). The oldest event is related to 



 34

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

migmatization of the gneissic basement rocks (Porteirinha Complex), the second event possibly 

resulted in the structural deformation of the Riacho dos Machados sequence, and the third 

event resulted in thin-skinned décollemont tectonics and development of the west-verging 

Araçuaí fold-thrust belt . 

Gold mineralization at the Ouro Fino Mine (terminology from previous workers, in other parts 

of this report referred to as the Riacho dos Machados deposit) is spatially related to highly 

sheared rocks of the RMG group of rocks. In Brazil, many gold deposits are hosted in shear 

zones that commonly impart distinct structural controls to gold mineralization. A structural 

and alteration study as the topic of a Ph.D. dissertation by R.N. Monteiro (unpublished, 1996), 

under the supervision of W.S. Fyfe at the University of Western Ontario, provides information 

on the structural architecture and relation to gold mineralization at the Ouro Fino Mine. 

Importantly, Monteiro's structural-mapping field work was completed when the open pit was 

active providing fresh exposures. The following is summarized from Monteiro et al. (2004). 

Planar elements mapped include well developed mylonite S-C fabrics; plots of C planes as 

maximum down-dip vectors shown an overall average of 111°/49°. Monteiro notes a 

progressive counter-clockwise rotation of the C-plane dip vectors from 119/50 (Area III), 

112/46 (Area IV) and 82/50 (Area V) from south to north (Figure 7.3-1). The S-C pair intersects 

at 45 towards 143. Quartz veinlet surfaces generally follow the C surface. Linear elements 

mapped include mineral stretching lineations of staurolite with two main concentrations: one 

at 45/146 (plunge/trend) and the other at 45/123. Monteiro notes that in shear-zones with 

monoclinic fabric (ie steady-state stress-strain ellipse) the stretching lineation should be 

perpendicular to the S-C pair however; changing stress-strain fields can cause migration of the 

S-C pair. In addition, the 55-78 rake of stretching lineation over the C surface is interpreted to 

represent a complex shear zone behaviour consistent with transpressional convergence. 

Folds range from crenulations to outcrop scale (several metres). Crenulations are considered 

third-order parasitic folds related to first-order larger folds. Three main intersection lineation 

styles related to these third-order folds are recorded with their average spatial orientations of 

Li (3) 39/139; Li(2) 39/124 (less evident); and Li(3) 10/195 – 02/030. A steronet plot that 

includes all intersection lineations forms a girdle that mimics the spatial orientation of the 

average C surface. Field observations suggested these crenulation sets cross-cut each other. 

Vergence of the crenulation sets is left-lateral and reverse toward the Sao Francisco Craton. 

Second-order intra-folia folds are rarely observed. The measured first and second-order folds 

are comparable with the crenulation orientations of Li(1) and Li(3) respectively. Microscopic 

observation notes gold-bearing arsenopyrite preferentially occurs along crenulation axes. 

Analysis and interpretation of structural features and kinematic indicators suggests an 

estimated vector of tectonic transport of 300-325°, with a shear-zone displacement and 

vergence of left-lateral and reverse toward the Sao Francisco Craton developed over a slightly 

oblique thrust-reverse ramp. The estimated tectonic transport vector is in agreement with that 

defined for the overlying cover rocks of the Araçuaí fold-and-thrust belt suggesting that the

fabric elements overprinting biotite mylonites may have been produced during the Brasiliano 

reactivation of the basement shear zones. 

In Monteiro's study, a key objective was to compare mapped structural fabrics of the shear-

zone hosted Ouro Fino gold mine and compare with gold-grade distribution utilizing 3-D 

variography of the mine-site assay database. This would allow evaluation of structural controls 

on gold-grade distribution. For this part of the study, two adjacent contiguous areas were sub-

domained within Area III, termed Z1 (south) and Z2(north) with each area including a sampled 

area of 200 m N-S, 100 m E-W, and 100 m Z. A total of 5,728 sample assays are used including 

881 from drill holes. Monteiro use this data to model best-fit ellipsoids. Monteiro considered 

two ranges, a small range (short distance) and the sill range (maximum reliable distance). 

Evaluation of the best-fit search ellipsoids from the sill range highlights the following: 

Anisotropy is only moderate with the length-ratio of long-to-intermediate axes approximately 

1.5 for both domains and 2) a sub horizontal and strike parallel direction is a prominent trend 

in gold grades, even if this direction is the principal axis in domain Z1 and the intermediate axis 

in domain Z2. The results of 3-d variography of mine-site gold assay data from two contiguous 

structural subdomains in Area III is presented in the Table 7.3-1. Best-fit search ellipse for the 

longer range (sill) are presented. D1, D2, and D3 correspond to principle, intermediate, and 

minor axes respectively. L1/L2 represents the length ratio between D1 and D2. Axes 

orientation is listed as trend direction/plunge. 

Area III Sub domains D1 D2 D3 L1/L2 

Z1C(sill) 34°/11° 134°41° 292°/42° 1.45 

Z2C(sill) 113°/67° 12°/05° 280°/22° 1.57 

Table 7.3-1: Results of 3-d Variography of mine-site gold assay data  

Monteiro compared the geometry of the best-fit search ellipses with the mapped structural 

fabrics in these two domains. Monteiro concludes that in sub-domain Z1, the major 

mineralization vector (long axes) plots near the sub-horizontal intersection lineation (Li(3)) and 

along the direction of the C surface (Figure 7.3-2). This is consistent with the subhorizontal 

fabric relating to the micro-, meso-, and macro-scale astmmetric folds within the shear-zone. 

The intermediate mineralization vestor plots near a cluster of structural fabrics including 

stretching lineation, mineral lineation and other sets of intersection lineations (Li(1) and Li(2)). 

In sub-domain Z2, the same general pattern was observed however, the major mineralization 

vector plots near the prominent cluster of structural fabric elements while the intermediate 

vector plot near the shallower dipping folds and crenulations (Li(3)). In both cases the 

ellipsoids are conformable with the C surface (Figure 7.3-2). 

These results suggest the gold mineralization is closely related to the structural fabric. 

Particularly, the C-plane spatial orientation seems to have been the main percolation duct in 

which the mineral and stretching lineation orientations, along with the intersection lineations 

(Li(1) and Li(2)) greatly facilitated fluid flow along shear surfaces. The striking coincidence of 



 36

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

sub-horizontal intersection lineation (Li(3)) with the major mineralization vector in sub-domain 

Z1 and the intermediate mineralization vector in sub-domain Z2 indicates this structural fabric 

played a key role in mineralization trapping (Figure 7.3-2). In sum, the main mineralizing fluid 

upflow was possibly upward along the thrust movement direction with lateral escape along 

interconnecting sub-horizontal structural fabric. Monteiro notes the mine geologists previously 

did not recognize a sub-horizontal structural control and rather, relied fully on the stretching 

lineation. 

Brittle deformation at the Riacho dos Machados gold deposit is limited to poorly defined cross-

faults which may have anomalous geochemistry but do not host gold mineralization. These 

cross-structures may however be important in compartmentalization of ductile deformation.

model interprets fluid upflow along lineations in the C-surface plane with traps at li(3) fold 

hinges (Monteiro et. al. 2004).

nearby a cluster of linear elements in the C-surface and the intermediate axis with the li.

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

The deposit at Riacho dos Machados Gold Project is considered to be a classic orogenic gold 

deposit type in a sheared and deformed Archean to Proterozoic age greenstone belt sequence 

comprised of metamorphosed volcanic-sedimentary rocks units intruded by slightly younger 

post-tectonic igneous bodies. 

According to Goldfarb et al. (2005), the term orogenic gold deposit is used for a class of 

deposits that were formed during compressional to transpressional deformation processes at 

convergent plate margins in accretionary or collisional orogens. The single most consistent 

characteristic of this type of deposit is their association with deformed metamorphic terrains 

of all ages. Observations from preserved Archaean greenstone belts and most recently-active 

Phanerozoic metamorphic belts throughout the world indicate a strong association of gold and 

greenschist-facies rocks, however some significant deposits occur in higher metamorphic-

grade terrains. Pre-metamorphic protoliths for the auriferous Archaean greenstone belts are 

predominantly volcano-plutonic terrains of oceanic back-arc basalt and felsic to mafic arc 

rocks; terrains dominated by clastic marine sedimentary rocks that were metamorphosed to 

metagreywacke, slate, phyllite, and mica schist. Studies carried out in the Riacho dos 

Machados area (Fonseca et al. 1997) concluded that the gold deposit is classified as a 

mesothermal orogenic gold type in view of its key characteristics.  

Orogenic gold deposits are among the most important sources of gold production in the world. 

The geology of the Riacho dos Machados area and its gold occurrences are strikingly similar to 

many other gold-bearing greenstone belts throughout the world. "Orogenic gold deposits" 

collectively account for more than 20 percent of the world's total gold production.  

This class of mineralization is normally controlled by first-order faults that act as conduits for 

the auriferous fluids; and second- and third-order faults are the sites of mineral deposition 

(Robert et al., 2005). Additional favourable areas with low or minimum mean stress zones 

include regional fault intersections, areas of regional uplift or anticlines, and zones of 

competency contrast, such as along granitoid margins (Robert, 1989; Vearncombe et al., 1989; 

Groves et al., 2000). In compressional regimes, reverse faults in these zones have the highest 

degree of disorientation and the highest levels of fluid overpressure, making them most 

susceptible to a high fluid flux and the deposition of gold (Sibson et al., 1988). 

The mineralization generally classified as "mesothermal," means it is thought to have formed 

under relatively high temperature at considerable depth in the earth's crust by hydrothermal 

and/or metamorphic processes. The deposits of this type may have great vertical extents 

(down-plunge), commonly two kilometers or more. In many deposits, the gold occurs in fissure 

veins, veinlets, stockworks and altered wall rock. 

The mineralization at Riacho dos Machados gold deposit is a sheet-like mineralized horizon 

controlled by a shear zone dipping 36° in which occurred hydrothermal alteration with gold 

precipitation. A linear fabric dominated by intersection and mineral lineation seems to control 



 39  

 

 

39

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

mineralization and represents the direction of minor variability in grade and thickness 

throughout the area.  

All the targets in the property area have similar characteristics to the Riacho dos Machados 

deposit and are explored considering these features. However, at the Passagem Nova Target 

the mineralization is characterized by injections in the form of quartz/sulphide veinlets with 

kaolin. These veinlets are late kinematics and occur in volcanic rocks altered in the green schist 

facies, intensely propylitized. The Au/Cu, mineral paragenesis, the proximity of dioritic 

intrusive rocks sin to late kinematics related to Paciência Suite and the intense propylitization 

eventually with tourmaline and hematite, could serve to establish a genetic vinculum between 

the mineralizing event and the intrusion of granitoids. 

Still a third type of mineralization occurs in the region of Riacho dos Machados in a target 

named Salobro, which is not included in the Mineração Riacho dos Machados block of areas. It 

is located about 30 Km to north of Riacho dos Machados mine and is also hosted in the Riacho 

dos Machados Group. The Salobro type mineralization is characterized by zones of massive 

sulphide intercalated in metavolcanic intermediate/acidic rocks with associated chemical 

metasediments, near the Paciência Suite. The mineralization is formed mainly by pyrite and 

pyrrhotite, with chalcopyrite and subordinated sphalerite. The sulphide interval, including 

disseminated portions, reaches deca-metric thicknesses. The massive portions are 

characterized by breccia type aspect, including centi-metric fragments of chloritic rock. Locally 

the massive sulphide intercepts orthogonally the banded sulphide portions, indicating clearly 

the existence of more than one phase of sulphidation.

9. DEPOSIT GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

9.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Mineralization at the Riacho dos Machados (RDM) Mine occurs in a belt of hydrothermally-

altered rock developed along a district-scale shear zone that extends almost 30 kilometers 

along strike in a N20°E strike direction and dips 40-45° east. The mineralization has a typical 

amphibolite facies mineral association, which is progressively altered to greenschist facies 

assemblage. The gold mineralized body, considering the a marginal cut-off of 0.3 g/t, occurs as 

'stacked' tabular horizons that are mostly concordant with the principal rock foliation (shear 

zone). These tabular zones typically consist of a main zone which may be sided by a thinner 

footwall or hanging wall zones, separated by 3-10 m of unmineralised rock (Figure 9.1-1 and 

Figure 9.2-1). Continuity along strike and at depth is good with gold mineralization occurring 

continuously over 2000 m strike length at RDM and up to 1000 m down dip. Previous workers 

at RDM have noted individual mineralized bodies containing >2.0 g/t gold pinch-and-swell 

along this zone, ranging from 20 to 150 metres in length, 1 to 5 metres or more in width, and 

plunge S40°E at an angle of -38° (Fonseca, et. al., 1997 and various CVRD documents). 

However, a structural study by Monteiro et. al. (2004) concludes a sub-horizontal strike-

parallel control is also very important (Section 7.2). 

9.1 ALTERATION 

At RDM, amphibolite-grade garnet-staurolite-biotite schist is retrograde altered to greenschist 

facies proximal to the mineralized shear zones within a broader – 200 m wide – mylonitic zone.  

Petrochemical studies completed by E. da Fonseca et. al. (1998) at RDM concluded the range 

of mica schists represent retrograde reactions of a common protolith at varying fluid:rock 

ratios during late-stage shearing and uplift. Mass balance analysis indicated the following the 

following elements were added to the biotite schist; K₂O, SiO₂, S, LOI, and H₂O and the 

following elements were depleted; CaO, Na₂, and MgO with the following stable; FeO and 

Fe₂O₃. 

The proximal alteration is characterized by intense bleaching and K-metasomatism with 

consumption of the iron-magnesian silicates such as biotite, garnet and staurolite giving place 

to sericite, muscovite, quartz, sulphides and gold precipitation. Outward, chlorite is an 

intermediate alteration phase grading to biotite only. The alteration halo ranges from a total of 

20 m thick to 50-60 m thick and symmetric around a sulphide+gold mineralized zone which 

commonly but not always correlates with the advanced alteration product of a quartz-

muscovite schist. Carpathian drill core logging has recognized and recorded a zonation of 

alteration as follows (xxx = logging code) from the core outward: 

Quartz-muscovite schist (qmx) -� chlorite-muscovite-quartz schist (cmx) �chlorite-biotite-

quartz schist (cbx) �biotite-feldspar schist (bx).  



 41

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

In general sulphide content and gold-mineralization correlates with the qmx and cmx; 

however, exceptions are not uncommon where sulphides and gold occur in the cbx and rarely 

in the bx. Alteration is fairly homogenous with little variation along strike, however, where the 

shear crosses the localized quartz-feldspar schist (part of Area IV and V) the leucocratic nature 

of the host rock suppresses chlorite formation.

Mineralization occurs in the hydrothermal/shear zone and gold grades are closely related to 

the sulphide content, especially arsenopyrite. Gold occurs as microscopic native-gold grains 

(typically finer than 400 mesh) at contacts between recrystallised quartz grains, muscovite 

grains and as inclusions in arsenopyrite, and less commonly in pyrrhotite, quartz-veinlets, 

tourmaline, and pyrite (Fonseca, E. da, et.al., 1998). Monteiro et. al. (2004) notes native-gold

occurrences in euhedral arsenopyrite in micro-structural traps (pressure-shadows) as possible 

evidence for late introduction of gold into the shear-zone. 

Detailed drill-core logging and reporting by Carpathian indicates the following minerals and 

features are correlated to gold mineralization (Note, these minerals/features occur as 

assemblages): 

High Importance to low importance: Arsenopyrite (both anhedral and euhedral needles) � 

pyrrhotite � abundant quartz veinlets (sheared into foliation plane) � pyrite � crenulation 

folding � tourmaline viens (fine-grained massive intergrown). 

The arsenic content of the mineralization is quite high with an average of ≥ 3,935 ppm As for 

samples > 1.0 g/t gold (note, some samples over detection limit). Silver contents are very low 

with the average Ag/Au ratio = 0.5 for samples > 1.0 g/t gold. Antimony, Copper, lead, and zinc 

are mostly non-anomalous. 

The spatial association of hydrothermal alteration and its relationship with shear zone as well 

the ore grade distribution is shown in the cross section in Figure 9.2-1 below.

10. EXPLORATION 

10.1 CARPATHIAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM 2008 TO PRESENT 

Concurrent with, and following the business acquisition of the Riacho dos Machados Gold 

Project by Carpathian on October 30th, 2008 (See Section 4.2), the following work programs 

were initiated and completed at the RDM Mine-site: 

• Compilation and computerization of historic CVRD data from hard-copy format. This 
includes exploration and drilling data from 423 drill holes completed between 1989 

and 1993 (Ruff 2008). 

• Carpathian diamond drilling program completed 64 drill holes between August 1st and 
October 29th 2008 for a total of 11,277 m. 

• Carpathian re-sampling of CVRD drill core from on-site storage facility. A total of 102 
drill holes were re-sampled (5,144 m) through the mineralized sections. 

• A thorough QA/QC program was implemented for evaluation of precision and accuracy 
of assay lab sample preparation and analyses. 

• Surveying control included all Carpathian drill collars, and downhole surveying. In 
addition, for validation purposes, 46 CVRD drill collars were located and surveyed for 

comparison with CVRD documents. 

• Geologic interpretation and modelling of Carpathian detailed core logging and assay 
results (Stefanini, 2008). 

The objective of these work programs was for project evaluation (Ruff, 2008) and for 

completing the present NI 43-101 compliant, Resource Estimate focusing on the sulphide-

bearing gold mineralization below the shallow historic open pits. This is addressed in detail in 

Section 17 of this report. The results of this Resource Estimate were released in May, 2009. 

Carpathian has initiated an infill drilling program (15,000 to 20,000 metres) in June 2009 to 

upgrade resource categories. 

Carpathian has converted the 12 application for Exploration Licenses to Exploration Licenses in 

late 2008 (Section 4.3). An exploration work program is planned for these licenses to evaluate 

targets generated by CVRD and described below (Section 10.3). For this work, Carpathian has 

acquired Ikonos Satelite image coverage with 1 metre of spatial resolution. In addition, maps 

of regional airborne magnetic and radiometrics where acquired over the area. 

This program is planned to include geological recognition in the whole area with mapping and 

chip sampling (2000 samples), about 25km
2
 of soil sampling and an initial drilling campaign 

with 40 diamond drill holes in the known targets. 

10.2 COORDINATES AND DATUM 

The Riacho dos Machados Gold Project (RDM) lies within the UTM Zone 23 South using the 

SAD 69 Datum which refers to the 1967 International Ellipsod (SGR-67). The project is centered 



 44  

 

 

44 

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

approximately at 16° 10´ South and 43° 07´ West. During the exploration phase and ore-

definition phase, DOCEGEO/CVRD established a local grid with grid north rotated 19° East of 

true-North to match the strike trend of the mineralized RDM shear-zone and surrounding 

tectono-stratigraphic trend.  

This grid covers an area of about 6000m in a NNE-SSW direction and a width ranging from 

900m to 3000m in a WNW-SES direction. The extent of this grid covers the RDM mine, the 

targets of NW, Confisco, and Mombuca to the north of the RDM mine, and the South target to 

the South of RDM mine. This main local grid has a base line established at line 5000E with 

survey monuments. 

All historical survey data in the mine-area (including drillhole collars) is reported in local-grid 

coordinates. In 2008 Carpathian re-established and validated the local grid and thus all surface 

survey data refers to the local-grid. 

In 2008, Carpathian contracted the Company SETA, specialized in topographic surveying, to 

establish 8 geodesic marks, with coordinates in UTM system (Sad 69) to work as reference to 

convert the local grid coordinates to UTM coordinates system and shown in Table 10.2-1. 

 

Table 10.2-1: Local-grid to UTM reference points 2008. 

In addition, a rotational transformation has been established based on the calculated rotation 

origin point of the local grid and a spreadsheet have been developed for easy application by 

technicians. This point of origin for rotation is shown in Table 10.2-2.

10.2.1 Magnetic declination 

Historic information from CVRD indicates a magnetic declination of 20° to the west has been 

used at the RDM Gold Project. In the original CVRD drill logs, azimuth of the holes were 

recorded in three different columns as Magnetic North (MN), True North (TN) and Local Grid 

North for the RDM mine (LGN).

The exploration targets of Manguinha (to the NW of RDM mine) were covered by another local 

grid oriented 358.5°E from True North (or 21.5↑8 from main local grid. The Manguinha grid is 

2040m in NS direction and 1150m in WE direction. The exploration target of Piranga was 

covered by a third local grid oriented 003°E from true North (or 17° from main grid) and 

extends for 1800m NS by 600 WE. These three local grids are shown in CVRD archive file 

SQRM008.  

10.3 HISTORICAL EXPLORATION 

The historical exploration activities by CVRD in the Riacho dos Machados Project area were 

briefly summarized in the History Chapter of this report. Those activities resulted in the 

discovery of the Ouro Fino gold deposit (later renamed the Riacho dos Machados Mine) and 

also the discovery of a number of outlying gold targets which have not yet been completely 

tested (Figure 10.5-1). Because most of these outlying areas remain viable exploration targets 

and fall within the ground covered by the 12 Exploration Licenses included in the current 

Riacho dos Machados Project, we present the results of the historical exploration in this 

Exploration Chapter. For continuity of discussion, the exploration target summaries in this 

Chapter also include results of the drilling that was done on the targets.  

 

10.4 TARGETS ON THE RIACHO DOS MACHADOS SHEAR ZONE 

The Riacho dos Machados Shear (RDMS) is a 14-kilometer long mineralized structure cutting 

metasediments of the Riacho dos Machados Group. It strikes 20–30° and dips 70° east. The 

Riacho dos Machados Mine extends for 1,300 metres along strike near the southern end of the 

RDMS and is marked by coincident gold and arsenic soil anomalies which were later verified by 

shallow surface trenches. Soil geochemistry and geologic mapping indicate the RDMS shear 

extends for at least another 8 kilometers (and possibly 12 kilometers) to the north beyond the 

mine. At least six exploration targets have been identified and tested with trenches and 

shallow drilling on the RDMS structure (Figure 10.5-2), as described in the following: 

RDM Mine South Extension — A 660-metre extension of mineralization on the RDMS south of 

the mine was tested with surface trenches and 54 shallow RC drill holes (29 metres average 

depth) on drill fences spaced 25 metres apart. Several holes intersected shallow, but 

apparently discontinuous, oxide gold mineralization. Some mineralized intercepts of selected 

drill holes from the RDM Mine South Extension exploration drilling are as follows:

RDM Mine— The RDM Mine exploited shallow oxide gold mineralization to a depth of 80 

metres or less. The sulphide gold mineralization, which extends to depth beneath the oxide 

gold zone, was explored in detail by CVRD as described in the History Chapter of this report. 

The sulphide mineralization persists to a depth of approximately 360 metres below the bottom 

of the open pit and remains open at greater depth.  

An area 500 metres west of the mine was tested with five shallow RC drill holes, one of which 

intersected 2 metres of 1.12 g Au/t at 2.0 metres depth. This shallow oxide mineralization, 

which may be controlled by a cross-structure or splay off the main shear zone, has apparently 

not been followed up.  

RDM Mine North Extension — A 365-metre extension of mineralization on the RDMS north of 

the mine was tested with 27 shallow RC drill-holes (42 metres average depth) on drill fences 

spaced 25 to 50 metres apart. Several holes intersected shallow, but apparently discontinuous, 

oxide gold mineralization. Mineralized intercepts of selected drill holes from the RDM Mine

with 15 shallow RC holes (60 metres average depth). One hole intersected 1 metre of 

2.65 g Au/t at 30.5 metres depth. No further work has been done. 

Manguinha Target Area — The Manguinha target is along a cross-structure (80° strike) 2.5 

kilometers north of the Rio dos Machados Mine and west of the Confisco Target. Soil sampling 

found gold anomalies (104 ppb and 665 ppb) with coincident arsenic anomalies. Results of

trenching across the anomaly trend were disappointing, but seven closely spaced RC drill holes 

(56 metres average depth) encountered anomalous to high-grade gold mineralization over a 

30- to 50-metre area. The three best intercepts in this limited drilling program are as follows:

Confisco Target — The Confisco Target, east of the Manguinha target, is 3 kilometers long and 

is underlain by a sequence of weakly metamorphosed chlorite schists, amphibolites, meta-

chert, iron formations, meta-rhyolites and manganiferous rocks. The rocks have well-

developed mylonitic foliation developed by simple shearing and are intruded and cut by 

apophyses of granite, pegmatite veins and numerous quartz veins. 

Five zones of soil geochemical anomalies were identified in reconnaissance and were followed 

by trenching and drilling. Two of twelve trenches along 300 metres of strike intersected 

significant gold over narrow intervals — 1 metre with 3.27 g Au/t and 1.5 metres with 

25.26 g Au/t, plus three separate 1-metre zones containing 6.43 g Au/t, 1.23 g Au/t and 

1.55 g Au/t. The target was tested with 5 RC drill holes (69 metres average depth), of which 4 

hit significant gold mineralization (>1.0 g Au/t). The mineralized intercepts in these holes are as 

follows:

10.5 TARGETS SOUTH OF THE RIACHO DOS MACHADOS MINE  

Three targets south of the Riacho dos Machados Mine — Piranga Sul, Mato da Roça (1, 2, and 

3), and Araçá — have geology and mineralization quite similar to the promising Passagem 

Nova target and may therefore be worthy targets for further exploration (Figure 10.5-3). The 

Mato da Roca 2, 3 and Araçá targets also contain permissive metasediments of the Riacho dos 

Machados Group, which are the host rocks at the Riacho dos Machados Mine.  

Piranga Sul Target — Explored with soil geochemistry, geological mapping and drilling. Dioritic 

rocks have been metasomatically altered in shear zones. Soil geochemistry and two shallow RC 

drill holes had no significant gold values. 

Mato da Roça 1 Target — Explored with soil geochemistry, geological mapping and trenching. 

Rocks consist of Archean basement, quartz-feldspar-amphibole schist which has been 



 48  

 

 

48

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

tectonically intercalated and intruded by granite and diorite, and laterite cover. Soil 

geochemistry defined four gold anomalies, one of which was examined by four surface 

trenches. Two of the trenches intersected significant gold mineralization over narrow intervals 

— 0.5 metres with 2.24 ppm, 0.9 metres with 1.38 ppm, and 1.1 metres with 1.98 ppm Au. 

Mato da Roça 2 Target — Explored with soil geochemistry and geological mapping. Rocks 

consist of quartz-biotite-schists intercalated with quartz-feldspar-amphibole schists belonging 

to the Riacho dos Machados Group and granitic rocks. Soil geochemistry identified three soil 

gold anomalies. 

Mato da Roça 3 Target — Explored with soil geochemistry and geological mapping. Rocks 

consist of quartz-biotite-schists and quartz-tourmaline veins. Soil geochemistry had no 

significant gold, arsenic or zinc values.  

Araçá Target — Explored with soil geochemistry and geological mapping. Rocks consist of 

metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Riacho dos Machados Group. Two soil gold 

anomalies areas were identified — 150 and 300 metres long — containing up to 281 ppb and 

223 ppb gold, respectively. The anomalies are coincident with a banded iron formation (BIF). 

The Rochedo target is 15 kilometers north of the Riacho dos Machados mine, immediately 

north of the Confisco target. The host rocks are silty slates, quartzites, carbonaceous meta-

pelite and meta-diamictites. This area has structural features characterized by a shear zone 

with more than 2 kilometers displacement, corresponding to the contact between 

diamictites/quartzites and carbonaceous pelitic rocks, marked by sericitization, silicification 

and pyritization, and delineated by airborne and ground EM geophysical surveys. Results of RC 

drilling to evaluate the shear zone were inconclusive. 

10.5.1 Passagem Nova Target 

An exception to the homogenous alteration and mineralization system at the Riacho Dos 

Machados Mine is the Passagem Nova target area 10 kilometres east of the mine. At Passagem 

Nova, the mineralization is characterized by injections of quartz sulphide veinlets and veinlet 

stockworks associated with kaolinite. The mineralization occurs in metavolcanic rocks adjacent 

to a dioritic intrusive body, probably belonging to the Paciencia Intrusive Suite. The country 

rocks surrounding the intrusive are intensely propylitized and mineralized with tourmaline, 

hematite and quartz sulphides veinlets containing gold and copper minerals.  

The Passagem Nova target is underlain by mafic to ultramafic volcanic rocks of uncertain age 

(possibly Archean?) intercalated to the north with meta-cherts, iron formations, and 

carbonaceous schists. Late diorites and granites of the Paciencia Intrusive Suite intrude this 

volcanic sequence. The target area is cut by shear zones related to thrust faults and is 

dissected by younger, steep dipping faults.  

The target was explored with stream sediment geochemistry, soil geochemistry, geophysics, 

trenches, and geological mapping. Two mineralized gold zones, 50 metres long and 7 metres 

wide, were found with an average grade of about 3.0 g Au/t. The lateral extent of these zones 



 49  

 

 

49 

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

has not yet been determined. Soil samples collected to extend mineralization to the south 

found two gold anomalies — 170 ppb gold and 1,326 ppb gold.  

The Passagem Nova mineralization is associated with a 30-metre wide zone of mylonitized 

ultramafic rocks with intense hydrothermal propylitic alteration. Quartz/iron-oxide veining 

occurs in a silicified zone containing gold and copper mineralization and is associated with 

kaolinite veins. Gossans are locally present; these contain limonite and micro-crystalline silica 

associated with local malachite and rare preserved casts after pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and 

ilmenite. 

The target was tested with 31 RC drill holes, of which apparently only 2 holes were analyzed or 

assayed. Both of these holes intersected significant mineralization — 1 metre of 12.5 g Au/t 

and 1 metre of 4.3 g Au/t — demonstrating some continuity of mineralization.  

Despite being the outlying target having probably the largest amount of historical exploration 

work, Passagem Nova remains one of the most interesting, if not promising, targets for further 

exploration. The occurrence of gold and copper, together with anomalous amounts of zinc, 

within a mafic-ultramafic sequence intruded by granite is a very different setting from the 

RDMS hosted mineralization to the west. These are favorable lithologies, strongly altered and 

strongly mineralized.

11. DRILLING 

11.1 INTRODUCTION 

Approximately 51,764 m of drilling have been completed on the project since 1987. Most of 

drilling has been concentrated on the RDM mine site and its Southern extension (43,699m), 

however smaller reconnaissance programs have been drilled by VALE/DOCEGEO on a few 

exploration targets (8065m). A summary of drilling is provided in Table 11.1-1. Location of 

historical drill holes and Carpathian drill holes is shown on Figure 11.1-1. 

For the Resource Estimate, the main topic of this report (Chapter 17), assay data from 

Carpathian drilling in 2008 and Carpathian re-sampling of CVRD diamond drill holes is utilized.

11.2 HISTORICAL DRILLING 

The historical drilling which was done by CVRD, the only previous explorer and operator of the 

Project, is summarized in the History chapter (Chapter 6) of this report, and the results of that 

drilling are discussed in the Exploration chapter (Chapter 10). What follows in this chapter is a 

discussion of logistics, statistics and other general information regarding those historical 

drilling programs and activities. 

DOCEGEO, the exploration branch of CVRD, discovered the Ouro Fino Gold deposit (later 

renamed the Riacho dos Machados Mine) through a generative exploration program in 1986 in 

an area without previous mining or exploration activity. Most of the drilling on the project was 

focused on this deposit, with some reconnaissance drilling of outlying targets carried on before 

and during the mining operation, which closed in 1997. This reconnaissance drilling targeted 

shallow oxide gold mineralization proximal to the operating mine for potential mine-feed.

Several drilling phases were completed during the period 1987 to 1994. No further drilling was 

completed on the project until Carpathian's drilling program in August, 2008. 

11.2.1 Drilling Statistics 

Drilling programs on the Riacho dos Machados Project included:  

a) Shallow RC drilling to define oxide gold reserves at the Ouro Fino deposit and to 

 explore a number of outlying targets;  

b) Diamond core drilling to define deeper sulphide mineralization beneath the Riacho 

 dos Machados Mine; and  

c) Underground exploration core drilling in the south part of the open pit mine.  

A total of 282 holes totalling 30,845 metres were drilled at the Riacho dos Machados (RDM) 

Mine, and 215 holes totalling 9,633 metres were drilled on various exploration targets. All of 

the historical drill holes are within the Mining Concession and the 12 areas of Exploration 

License Applications included in the Riacho dos Machados Gold Project land package acquired 

by Carpathian.  

The surface and underground drilling campaigns carried out at the RDM are summarized in the 

History Chapter 6 of this report and the results of drilling carried out on the various outlying 

exploration targets are included in the Exploration Chapter 10.  

11.2.2 Drilling Techniques 

Core holes with an "F" prefix (surface diamond drilling) were collared with HQ-size core (76 

mm diameter) in the saprolite and weathered rock and reduced to NQ-size core (54 mm 

diameter) after the hole intercepted fresh rock. The shorter holes in this series ranged from 30 

to 80 metres depth with the deeper holes from 300 to 416 metres depth. The "FD" series core 

holes were drilled in the same manner as the "F" holes except the core was reduced to BQ-size 

(36 mm diameter) below the 540m level. The shorter holes in this series ranged from 95 to 150 

metres depth with the deeper holes from 700 to 900 metres depth. The "SU" series core holes 

were drilled from the underground workings with AQ-size core (33 mm diameter). These holes 

ranged from 10 to 90 metres length. 

Most of the RC drill holes were less than 50 metres in depth to a maximum of 80 metres 

depth. Given the climate and local water table, it is assumed that the bulk of these holes were 

drilled under 'dry conditions'. However, no RC drill holes were used in the present resource 

estimate. 

11.2.3 Drillhole Survey 

Drill holes were surveyed for deviation in dip and azimuth using a Tropari survey instrument, a 

down hole single shot instrument with azimuth determined magnetically (the rocks in the area 

are not strongly magnetic). The "FD" holes that were drilled below the 540 metres, were 

surveyed using a Reflex-Fotobor DDI, a mechanical-optical instrument. Except for the deep drill 

holes ("FD" series, in particular FD-31 to FD-39), Carpathian has not obtained any records of 



 56

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

the down-hole surveys for the CVRD drill holes. The data appears to have been lost by CVRD 

during a series of archive moves. Nevertheless there are many old sections, cross sections and 

longitudinal sections, in which the trace of the drill holes represent deviations recorded in the 

original down-hole surveys. For the drill holes with no survey records, Carpathian used these 

sections as a basis to simulate the down-hole surveys. The changing of dip estimation was 

based on the cross sections for different sectors of the deposit and the azimuth estimation was 

based on the pierce point registered in the longitudinal section. Therefore Carpathian assumed 

that the drill holes deviate following a local pattern along the dip and made sure that the ore 

zone was not displaced with regards to the azimuth recorded in the longitudinal section. A 

spreadsheet containing all the geometric parameters necessary to simulate the behavior of the 

each drill hole was developed by Carpathian, resulting in deviation reports for the drill-hole 

database. The final result shows that the simulated deviations are very similar to those 

observed in the new holes that have been drilled during the current campaign. This along with 

utilizing pierce-points from CVRD long-sections, serve to validate the derived method. These 

drill holes were then re-sampled and utilized in the current Resource Estimate (Chapter 17). 

NCL has reviewed the technique used and concurs with the method used to restore the 

missing information. 

11.2.4 Drilling Data Base 

The historical files containing drill collar and survey information are in good state. All 

exploration data around the mine, including drill holes, trenches and soils are in a local grid, 

oriented 20°E from true north. The original geologic drill logs — which contain sample 

numbers, gold assay results, collar coordinates and hole orientation — for all core and RC 

holes drilled in the mine area are available in paper format and have been captured by 

Carpathian into an electronic database. The database includes 33,527 m of drilling, 256 m of 

underground channel sampling, and a total of 29,663 assay entries. The geology logging 

requires some further sorting or classification to be highly useful as it contains a confusingly 

large number of lithology codes.  

11.3 CARPATHIAN DRILLING 

Carpathian completed a first phase of diamond-drilling at the Riacho Dos Machados mine 

between July 28
th

 and October 29
th

 2008. As shown on Figure 11.1-1, drilling was performed on 

30 east-west oriented (090°) 50 to 100m spaced sections, over an area of approximately 400m 

east-west by 1740m north-south; (orientations are with respect to the local grid). The southern 

extension, which extends to the south for about 460m from the edge of the existing open pit, 

was only drilled to test the continuity of the mineralization and the drill sections comprise only 

one or two holes.

11.3.1 Drilling Statistics 

The total average depth of the drilling was 176 metres with holes drilled vertically or dipping to 

the West. The shorter holes in this series ranged from 70 to 120 metre in depth and the 

deeper holes from 200 to 350 metres in depth. This campaign consisted of 64 holes identified 

with an "FRM-" prefix, the collar information for these holes are listed in Appendix 1 and are 

shown in the Figure 11.1-1. The program was planned to check previous CVRD information, to 

expand the known limits of the mineralization and to increase the information density 

especially in the shallower part of the deposit for future open pit optimization. This drilling was 

conducted by Servitec Sondagem Geológica with MACH 320 and MACH 1200 drill rigs, 

produced by Maquesonda of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A photograph of MACH 1200 drill rig 

operating at RDM Gold Project is shown in Figure 11.3-1. 

 

Figure 11.3-1: Diamond drill rig operating on the RDM Mine-site September 2008. 

11.3.2 Drilling Techniques 

All holes were drilled from surface, collared with HQ-size core (76 mm diameter) in the 

saprolite and weathered rock and reduced to NQ-size core (54 mm diameter) after the drill 

hole intercepted fresh rock. Each run of the drill rigs are approximately 3 metre and the 

average core recovery in each hole ranged from 84 to 99% with a total average of 95%.  

The drill holes locations are previously defined by geologists using cross sections, longitudinal 

sections and maps. Points are checked in the field to ensure about the possibility to drill at the 

given position therefore drill pads and access are provided using D-6 tractors when needed. To 

drill inclined holes a CPN technician stretches a cord between two stakes along the azimuth 

direction so the drill rig is aligned with it. Dip inclinations are determined using the clinometer 

of a Brunton compass over the drill mast.  

After the completion of the drill hole, the absolute collar location is determined by a 

Carpathian technician using a Topcon Total Station model 102N. In the 2008 drilling program 3 

holes were surveyed for deviations in dip and azimuth using the REFLEX Maxibor, 35 holes

were surveyed with REFLEX Ez-Shot instruments and 26 holes were surveyed with Pewee 

instruments. The Peewee and Ez-Shot measurements are done every 30 metres and Maxibor 

measurements are done every 3 metres. The use of magnetic instruments for the downhole 

survey is believed to be reliable as the rocks in the area are not strongly magnetic.

12. SAMPLING METHODS AND APPROACHES 

For the Resource Estimate, the principle topic of this report (Chapter 17), assay data from 

Carpathian drilling in 2008 and Carpathian re-sampling of CVRD diamond drill holes in 2008 is 

utilized. The original CVRD assay results lack QA-QC control suitable for a NI43-101 Resource 

estimate. The sampling method and analysis of Carpathian drill hole sampling and the CVRD 

drill core re-sampling are the same. 

12.1 CARPATHIAN CORE HANDLING, LOGGING, SAMPLING 

At the drill rig, the drilling contractor removes the core from standard core barrels, cleans, and 

places into labeled wooden boxes. The drillers use wood core-blocks with imprinted metal tags 

marking drill-run depth from-to, drill length, and recovered length. When received from the 

drilling contractor, the drill core is photographed. An example of the core photos with 

identification of hole, box and depths is shown in Figure 12.1-1. 

The drill core is then logged by a geologist into a standardized paper form incorporating a 

project-specific coding scheme developed by Carpathian based on the historical CVRD drilling 

results and detailed re-logging examples. Within the mineralized zone, geologic logging is 

completed in detail at a metre by metre scale recording the following information: 

• Lithology 
• Alteration intensity 
• Sulphide content and proportions of sulphide mineral types 
• Abundance of quartz veining (typically sheared in the mineralised zone) 
• Structural measurements and notes (ie. Crenulation folding) 
• Additional mineralization features (ie. Tourmaline veins) 
• Weathering state 

During core logging, the geologist marks in the boxes the beginning and end of the interval to 

be sampled and note in the log sheet the samples and QAQC identifications to be inserted. 

Sampling is done within the known ore zones and surrounding altered rock, however extra 

hydrothermal alteration zones and intervals with abundant sulphides are also sampled if 

occurring. Adjacent to the mineralized zones, sampling brackets approximately 10 metres on 

each side. Sampling is conducted on a metre by metre basis. The material outside the 

mineralized zones is considered waste and not sampled. 

Samples are collected by a trained sampler under the supervision of a technician or a 

geologist. The core is split lengthwise using a diamond core saw in the competent zones and a 

specially designed scoop in the highly weathered zones. The sample is placed in a plastic bag 

with a sample tag. The plastic sample bag is further marked in two places on the outside with 

the sample identification. The sample bags are then sealed and sent to the laboratory for 

physical preparation and chemical analysis. The laboratory is internationally recognized and 



 60

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

industry standard sample preparation and analytical techniques are used (Chapter 13). The 

remaining core is archived for future reference.  

Prior to cutting and sampling core, all core is logged for geotechnical features on a separate 

logging form by a geotechnician. This logging includes recovery, RQD, maximum length, 

hardness, fracture surfaces and fracture fills. 

  

Figure 12.1-1: Example core-photograph from Carpathian 2008 drill program at the RDM Mine-site 

12.2 CARPATHIAN RE-SAMPLING OF HISTORICAL HOLES 

All of the core from the Project is believed to be stored on-site. An inspection of the core 

storage facility in one of the buildings at the mine site shows it to be a secure, solid enclosed 

structure protected from the elements. The core is stored in labelled wood boxes in good 

condition. A review of core from selected drillhole intercepts indicates the core is in good 

condition. The rock in the intervals we examined appears to be competent and the core 

recoveries were apparently quite good. The driller's marking blocks are clear and concise. 

Sample number tags are loosely inserted, but markings on the boxes clearly indicate top and 

bottom directions of the samples. 

Validation of historical drill core integrity was enabled through comparison with original paper 

geologic logs with sample numbers and assays. Carpathian re-sampling compares reasonably 

well with original assay results, reflecting the same mineralized intervals with adequate 

similarity in grade and thickness, although on a sample per sample comparison, the differences 

may be significant. The comparison between the population of historical assays compared with 

the population of re-sampling assays show similar statistical behaviour, as demonstrated in the 

Figure 12.2-1.

Carpathian re-sampled 102 of the historic CVRD drill holes using proper QA-QC procedures 

(Chapter 13) for use in the current Resource Estimate. The re-sampling program was carried 

out on a metre by metre basis through the mineralized zone and surrounding altered rock. For 

the "F" and "FD" series drill holes, either HQ or NQ-size core (76 and 54mm, respectively), the 

re-sampling utilizes mostly quarter-core samples. For the deeper "FD" core and for the "SU" 

series, with BQ and AQ-size core (36 and 33mm respectively), half-core is being re-sampled. 

The sample is placed in a plastic bag with a sample tag. The plastic sample bag is further 

marked in two places on the outside with the sample identification. The sample bags are then 

sealed and sent to the laboratory for physical preparation and chemical analysis. The 

laboratory is internationally recognized and industry standard sample preparation and 

analytical techniques are used (Chapter 13). The remaining core is archived for future 

reference. 

 

Figure 12.2-1: Comparison Carpathian resampling vs CVRD results 

12.3 HISTORICAL SURFACE SAMPLES 

DOCEGEO/CVRD collected numerous soil samples, surface rock chip and trench samples from 

the Riacho dos Machados Project; results of this sampling are discussed in the Exploration 

Chapter of this report. Maps showing the sample location and analytical results were reviewed 

in the office at the Riacho Dos Machados mine site. It appears most of the surface sampling 

was focused on areas exhibiting relatively conspicuous mineralization or alteration. Many 

details regarding size of the samples, methods, etc. are not known, however it is apparent that 

much of the sampling represents channel samples taken along trenches and across outcrops. 

NCL has not utilized any surface samples in the resource estimation. 

12.4 CVRD/DOCEGEO HISTORICAL DRILL SAMPLES 

The drill core consists of both NQ-size (47.6 mm diameter) and BQ-size (36.5 mm diameter) 

core. The core was logged by a geologist, the sample intervals marked, and then sawed in half

with a diamond-blade rock saw. A one-half split of the core for each interval was then bagged, 

labeled and sent for assay to either DOCEGEO's own laboratory in Araci, Bahia State, Brazil or 

CVRD's laboratories in Santa Luzia, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Apparently no blanks, standards 

or blind duplicates were introduced into the sample/analytical stream prior to sending them to 

the laboratory. A mixture of analytical techniques were used during the different drilling 

campaigns. Original assay lab reports are not available and assays hand-entered on geologic 

logs form the source of the historic drill assay database. The remaining one-half split of core 

was returned to the original core box and retained for archival purposes.  

This drill core was stored on-site under secure, sheltered conditions in well labeled wood 

boxes. A review of core from selected drill hole intercepts indicates the core is in good 

condition. Competent core and good recoveries are typical. The driller's marking blocks are 

clear and concise. Sample number tags are loosely inserted, but markings on the boxes clearly 

indicate top and bottom directions of the samples. The good integrity of this historic drill core 

and the recorded assays has been validated through Carpathian's re-sampling program 

(Section 12.2). Drill cuttings from the RC drilling were not archived.

13. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY  

This chapter addresses the sample preparation, analyses, and security of Carpathian samples 

collected and submitted during the 2008 drilling campaign for use in the Resource Estimate 

presented in Chapter 17. All samples were drill-core and followed the same protocols of 

sampling, sample preparation, and analyses for both Carpathian drill holes and the re-sampling 

of CVRD drill core. For information regarding historic CVRD analytic procedures, the reader is 

referred to the Technical report prepared by BK Associates (February, 2008). 

The principle laboratory utilized by Carpathian for all sample preparation and analyses used in 

the current Resource Estimate is ALS Chemex Brazil, near Belo Horizonte, an independent 

laboratory which complies with the requirements of the international standards ISO 9001:2000 

and ISO 17025:2005. Industry standard sample preparation and fire-assay procedures were 

used (Section 13.2 and 13.3). 

Carpathian routinely inserts several types of QA/QC samples in laboratory submittals to 

evaluate lab precision and accuracy (Section 13.4). The secondary laboratory utilized by 

Carpathian for all check assays is the SGS-Geosol Brazil, near Belo Horizonte, which complies 

with the requirements of the international standards ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025:2005. 

Industry standard fire-assay procedures were used. 

13.1 SAMPLE CUSTODY AND SECURITY 

Samples are collected by a trained sampler under the supervision of a technician or a geologist 

with QA/QC samples inserted within a sequential numbered sequence and recorded. Prior to 

shipment to the laboratory, samples are stored in a secure locked room. Samples are shipped 

by truck from RDM site directly to ALS Chemex in Belo Horizonte using the transporting 

company TNT Transportes LTDA. The laboratory provides an on-line interface to their 

database, named Webtrieve, in which the client can track samples, access results and 

download certificates. In this manner, after arriving in ALS lab and checked with the 

submission sheet, each sample is weighted and receives a new code with barcode labels that 

are attached to them. If any problem is identified with the samples, ALS would specify the 

discrepancies to the geologists on site. The rejects and the prepared pulps are stored in the 

ALS lab and returned to the RDM site in the next available transport. 

A new core-shed was constructed at site to adequately store the core boxes from Carpathian 

drilling; this building is also used for geotechnical and geological logging and sampling. 

13.2 CARPATHIAN SAMPLE PREPARATION 

All samples used in the current Resource Estimate are from drill-core and were prepared at the 

internationally recognized ALS Chemex laboratory near Belo Horizonte. The laboratory utilizes 

industry standard drying ovens, jaw crushers and pulverizers which are well ventilated for dust 

control. 



 64

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

 The equipment consists of one large drying oven with automatic temperature control, one jaw 

crusher, and six 5 kg capacity LM5 pulverisers. Each of these has forced air extraction and 

compressed air for cleaning the crushers and pulverisers.  

The preparation protocol for Carpathian samples is as follows:  

• Coding: an internal laboratory code is assigned to each sample at reception and any 
discrepancy with the sample submittal are notified to Carpathian 

• Weighing: all samples are weighed 
• Drying: the samples are dried for as much as 24 hours 
• Crushing: the entire sample is crushed in a jaw crusher to obtain >70% passing 2 mm 
• Pulverization: 1 kg split of -2 mm crushed sample is obtained using a riffle splitter 

which is pulverised to achieve better then 85% passing 75 microns 200 mesh). A 150 to 

200 g sample was collected from the pulveriser 

• Storing and submitting: The coarse rejects, pulps and pulp rejects are stored on site for 
30 days and then returned to Carpathian.  

Sieve checks are conducted regularly by ASL Chemex (every 15 to 20 samples). A sterile rock is 

passed through the crushers and pulveriser to clean the equipment on a regular basis. In 

addition ALS Chemex completes the following internal QA/QC protocols during sample 

preparation: 

In addition to the sieve tests, ALS Chemex completes the following QA/QC protocols during the 

sample preparation: 

• Pulp blank: 1 inserted every 20 samples 
• Certified Reference Material (CRM): 2 inserted every 20 samples (3 CRMs in use 

ranging between 0.20 and 6.87 g Au/t) 

• Pulp duplicates: 1 every 20 samples 

All pulps are automatically labelled with the job number, sequence number, and sample 

number. Duplicate samples are returned to Carpathian along with the other pulps. 

13.3 CARPATHIAN SAMPLE ANALYSES 

All sample analyses utilized in the current resource estimate utilized industry standard 50 g fire 

assay, AAS finish, method for gold assay at the principle laboratory, ALS Chemex, Belo 

Horizonte. In addition, all samples were analyzed for a multi-element suite using ICP-AES from 

ALS Chemex, Lima, Peru. 

Sample decomposition is made by fire assay fusion and the analytical method used is atomic 

absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The prepared samples (50g) are fused with a mixture of lead 

oxide, sodium carbonate, borax, silica, mixed with 6 mg of gold-free silver and then cupelled to 

yield a precious metal bead. The bead is digested in 0.5 ml dilute nitric acid in the microwave 

oven. 0.5 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid is then added and the bead is further digested in 

the microwave at a lower power setting. The digested solution is cooled, diluted to a total

volume of 10 mL with de-mineralized water, and analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy 

against matrix-matched standards. For ICP-AES analytical method the sample decomposition 

uses HNO3-HCLO4-HF-HCL digestion, HCL Leach. The prepared sample (0.25 g) is digested with 

perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids. The residue is topped up with dilute 

hydrochloric acid and the resulting solution is analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic 

emission spectrometry. Results are corrected for spectral inter-element interferences. The 

detection limit and ranges and assaying methods are listed in Table 13.3-1 for each element. 

 

Table 13.3-1: Assaying Methods and detection limits used for 2008 drill and re-sampling program 

13.4 CARPATHIAN QA/QC PROCEDURES 

Carpathian routinely inserted five different types of quality control-assurance materials in 

assay submittals to monitor laboratory precession and accuracy. Approximately 4% of each 

quality control material is inserted at random intervals into the sampling number sequence by 

logging geologist (for total of 20% quality control samples). This procedure is used for all 

submitted samples by Carpathian including the re-sampling of CVRD drill core. The types of 

quality control samples inserted in routine submittals are: 

• pulp blank, 4.6% of the 10,677 assayed core samples;  
• coarse blank, 4.9% of the 10,677 assayed core samples;  
• certified reference material (CRM), 4.9% of the 10,677 assayed core samples;  
• pulp duplicate, 2.3% of the 10,677 assayed core samples;  
• coarse duplicate, 3.3% of the 10,677 assayed core samples.  

For CRM's, pulp blanks and pulp duplicates, approximately 60g of material is weighed and 

placed into a small plastic bag, sealed and submitted to the laboratory with the rest of the 

sample shipment in the sequence. The CRM used in the project are supplied by Rocklabs, for 

high grade standard (178 samples @ 8,573 ppm Au), medium grade (176 samples @ 4,086 

ppm Au) standard and low grade (173 samples @0,597 ppm Au). The pulp and coarse 

duplicates are obtained from the sample rejects returned from the lab. The coarse blank is

obtained from crushed granite obtained from a single outcrop in the vicinity of the mine site 

and known to be absent of gold mineralization. 

A secondary independent laboratory, SGS-Geosol near Belo Horizonte, (ISO Certified) was used 

to perform check assays on returned pulps from the primary laboratory. Approximately 3% of 

the prepared pulps (287 samples) returned from ALS has been re-submitted to be analyzed 

using standard 50 g fire-assay AAS-finish for gold. Correlation between the two laboratories is 

considered excellent, given the nuggety nature of the mineralization: The correlation 

coefficient is 0.98. 

13.4.1 Review of QA/QC Results 

Below are plots of the following QA/QC sample results, along with the analysis of the results: 

• Pulp Blank 
The analysis of 496 pulp blank samples (4.6% of the samples included in the regular 

submission batches) did not show any appreciable Au cross-contamination during the 

assaying process at ALS Chemex.  

 

 

Figure 13.4-1: Scatter plot of Pulp blank 

• Coarse Blank 

The analysis of 355 coarse blank samples (4.9% of the valid samples, included in the regular 

submission batches) yielded five minor contamination events for Au. NCL is of the opinion that 

no appreciable cross-contamination was produced during the preparation process at ALS 

Chemex.

• Pulp Duplicates 

Carpathian used 255 Pulp Duplicates returned from the primary laboratory, ALS Chemex, and 

sent to the secondary laboratory, SGS. To verify the consistency between the two sets of 

results, NCL used the scatter plot and the HARD graph. This is the acronym for Half Average 

Relative Difference. The limit recommended by NCL for gold is to have less than 20% of 

samples with more than 20% of relative difference. And the parameters which best reflect a 

good similarity between two duplicates in the scatter plot are the R
2
 , preferably close to 1, 

and the equation of the linear curve which best fits the cloud of distribution. In the equation 

y= ax + b, a needs to be as close to 1 as possible, and b close to 0, in order to define good 

repeatability.  

The HARD graph, Figure 13.4-4, demonstrates that the duplicates are below the hurdle of less 

than 20% of samples with less than 20% difference. The R
2
 of 0.9692 and the equation y = 

1.0517x - 0.0265 are indicative of good quality.

Carpathian submitted during the 2008 campaign 166 samples of the low grade standard (S1), 

172 samples of medium grade (S2), and 177 samples of high grade (S3), representing in total 

4.8% of the valid samples included in the regular submission batches. Most of the assays were 

within the AV±2*SD range or very close to those limits, without appreciable bias. Accuracy 

plots for Au were plotted (Figure 13.4-7, Figure 13.4-8, Figure 13.4-9), where the Mean Values 

obtained for each standard were plotted against the corresponding certified value. For each of 

these graphs, the certified value (as defined by the average of the values reported by the 

standard maker) and the limits of AV±2*SD are marked by coloured lines. 

 The accuracy plots provide information about the overall accuracy for the studied element. 

Except for a short interval for the high grade standard, the graphs yielded an acceptable 

overall accuracy. On the basis of these results, NCL concludes that the Au accuracy at ALS 

Chemex during the exploration campaign was acceptable.

13.5 DATABASE CONTENT AND INTEGRITY 

Carpathian has entered all of their downhole geological and geotechnical data (including 

relevant historical data) into a combination of Excel® and Micromine® databases. The 

Micromine database is the 'master' database and was maintained by a single, experienced 

Resource Geologist (a Carpathian employee). Micromine database has the typical features of 

relational databases including validation procedures and specific QA/QC applications for

exploration-resource data. GIS software is used for relevant historical maps, satellite imagery 

and historical CVRD autocad drawings. Drillhole sampling data is recorded on-site and entered 

into standardized Excel spreadsheets. Assay data are not manually entered on site because 

they are digitally sent from the laboratory to Carpathian and imported via 'merging'into the 

Micromine database and via 'cut-and-paste' into the Excel spreadsheets. Carpathian visually 

reviews assays on the signed paper certificate against that in the digital databases. 

Select geological data from the geological logs are entered from the hardcopy logs into Excel 

spreadsheets by the geologist, subsequently imported into the Micromine data. Downhole 

survey data is entered from hardcopies supplied by the drill contractor. Drill hole collar survey 

data are not manually entered because they are digitally sent by the surveyor to Carpathian 

and imported into Excel spreadsheets. 

Carpathian presents the data in up-to-date drill sections. Section interpretations are reconciled 

to level plans and longitudinal sections to ensure that domains (solids) are properly 

constructed and interpretations are sound. Sections and levels are reviewed on a regular basis 

to ensure that all holes have crossed the target where planned, and that sufficient data density 

exists to make an appropriate interpretation. 

13.6 SPECIFIC GRAVITY MEASUREMENTS 

Specific Gravity measurements were made on core from holes executed by CPN on 

representative intervals. The samples were submitted to test work of specific gravity were 

collected from drill cores measuring between 12 and 15 centimeters long, at least a half core 

was used, with a diameter of 50.8 mm (NQ2). 

A total of 81 samples were collected, being 36 representing the ore and 45 the waste rock, 

both related to lithologies, grades, and intensity of weathering in order to be representative of 

the deposit. 

The test work was done for ALS Chemex laboratory and the following procedures were 

adopted: The core sample was weighted and then slowly placed into a bulk density apparatus 

which is filed with water is collected into a graduated cylinder and measured. From the data, 

the bulk density is calculated: 

Density= weight of sample (g)/ volume of water displaced (cm³) 

In some cases the core were coated with paraffin before analysis. The paraffin wax density was 

compensated for when determining the final density value. 

The results were investigated for possible outliers and only 3 were found, thus it was discarded 

and a simple average of the results according to the zone where the samples were collected 

were used to estimate SG. No interval of oxide ore was intercepted in the present campaign, 

therefore waste oxide measurements were used for this purpose, escalating by 1% to account 

for the increased sulphide content. The average density value for fresh gold mineralized

14. DATA VERIFICATION  

14.1 DATA EXAMINATION 

The overall integrity and internal consistency of the database was checked when preparing the 

data for estimation. As commented previously, only assay data from the Carpathian campaign 

was verified, and from the CVRD campaign, the collar and survey information was verified. NCL 

checked the computerized records (drillhole collars, down the hole surveys, assays, and 

geologic coding) against original information for three holes selected randomly from the 

Carpathian campaign. NCL reviewed all the records of them, not finding any discrepancy with 

the original records. 

Very little adjustment was necessary, following the visit, to adjust some items of the database 

found incorrect. All problems were corrected with the prompt help of the site personnel. 

In general, the database is considered adequate and in accordance to international standards. 

Carpathian continues to maintain an orderly database and filing systems with all the relevant 

information separated by drill hole. 

14.2 SITE VISIT 

The QP responsible for this report, Carlos Guzmán, realized a site visit from June 25
th

 to June

st

 2008, becoming familiarized with the geology, the local 

conditions and exploration methodology used. 

Issues related to the available information were discussed at the project site and in several 

other meetings at the Carpathian Brazil's Head office or NCL office, both in Belo Horizonte. 

14.3 VERIFICATION SAMPLING 

No verification sampling was performed by NCL, who considered the verification sampling 

executed by BK associates for the last technical report, 2009, enough to corroborate the 

campaign used for the resource estimation.

16. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

16.1 HISTORICAL OXIDE GOLD PRODUCTION 

Rocks at the RDM Mine are intensely weathered to variable depths of 30 to 80 metres below 

which they transition quickly into fresh rocks of the sulphide gold zone. The ore from the oxide 

zone was mined by open pit methods, crushed to –1/2 inch and placed in 6 metre high pads 

where gold was leached over a 75 to 90-day period with cyanide solution and then adsorbed 

from solution with activated carbon in a series of columns. After being stripped from the 

carbon and recovered by electrowinning, the gold was smelted on site to produce gold bullion. 

The sodium cyanide (NaCN) reagent consumption in this process was a reasonable 200 g/t. 

Over the life of the operation, 2.9 million tonnes of ore with an average grade of 1.74 g Au/t 

were processed on the leach pads, from which 4.4 tonnes of gold were recovered for an 

average recovery rate of 86%. Recoveries declined near the end of the operation as a result of 

the ore becoming harder, less oxidized and becoming increasingly mixed with sulphide 

mineralization.  

16.2 HISTORICAL STUDIES OF SULPHIDE GOLD MINERALIZATION 

CVRD completed communition and metallurgical test work on several samples as part of their 

pre-feasibility study of the non-oxidized sulphide gold mineralization below the RDM Mine 

open pit. In 1994, they collected six bulk samples of 16 tonnes each, ranging in grade from 1.57 

to 4.78 g Au/t (average 3.25 g Au/t) and spaced over a 380-metre strike length from the 

exploration underground-development drift, approximately 70 m below the bottom of the 

south open pit in Area III. The samples ranged from 1.57 to 4.78 g Au/t and averaged 

3.25 g Au/t. These samples were sent to Superintendencia de Tecnologia Centro de Pesquisas 

(SUTEC), the metallurgical branch of CVRD for metallurgical study including major element 

analyses, mineralogy, gold grade vs. crushed grain size analysis, gravity concentrate, and 

cyanide-leach gold recoveries for various size fractions. The purpose of the study was to assess 

the possibility of heap-leach and CIP vat leach for gold recovery of the sulphide-bearing ore. 

The test work showed that gold mineralization in the deeper sulphide responded reasonably 

well to cyanide extraction. In column leach tests of the six samples, gold recoveries averaged 

67% for a –2mm crush size and 71% for –1mm crush. A high pressure Roller Press crusher was 

used to optimize gold extraction from one sample to 81% for the –2 mm crush size. In bottle 

roll tests on the same samples, gold recovery averaged 81% for a –0.074mm (–200 mesh) grind 

and was increased with an even finer grind. Reagent consumptions were low. The test work 

was not optimized for CIP vat leach conditions, and a review of this test work in 1996 by 

Roscoe Postle and Associates tentatively concluded that gold recoveries from a production 

plant would be in the range of 84% to 88%.

16.3 CARPATHIAN METALLURGY TESTING 

Carpathian envisions an industry-standard, crushing, grinding (single-stage ballmill), CIL 

(carbon in leach) circuit with and ADR (adsorption, desorption, and recovery) process plant to 

extract and recover gold from the sulphide and oxide mineralization at the RDM Gold Project. 

To evaluate this process, three composite drill core samples were submitted to the SGS-Geosol 

Metallurgical laboratory in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, for grinding and cyanide leaching test work. 

Results from this test work were presented to Carpathian in a report dated January 15, 2009 

entitled "Leaching Kinetics of Three RDM Samples". 

Three composite drill core samples of approximately 50 kg each were collected from 

Carpathian's 2008 drilling campaign. These samples are all in sulphide gold mineralization from 

three discrete along-strike zones from south to north as follows: Met-3 from Area III; Met-4 

from Area IV; and Met-5 from Area V. 

The following is summarized from the SGS-Geosol report to Carpathian "Leaching Kinetics of 

Three RDM Samples" dated January 15
th

, 2009. 

16.3.1 Metallurgical Test Samples 

One of each of the 2 kg sub-samples was pulverized to 100% below 106 microns (150 mesh). 

Three aliquots of 50 grams were then separated with a splitter from that material and sent to 

chemical analyses for gold (fire assay / atomic absorption), silver (multi-acid digestion / atomic 

absorption), iron (XR fluorescence) and sulfur (infra red / Leco). Table 16.3-1 shows the global 

assays of the samples in triplicate. 

 

 

Table 16.3-1: Global Assays of Test Samples 

16.3.2 Grinding 

Each sample was crushed to 100% passing 1.70 mm (10 mesh). A 2 kg split was charged into a 

10x10 inch ball mill to evaluate time required to reach standard size of P80 75 microns (200 

mesh). The table and graphs below show the results of the grind time versus P80 of 74 microns 

test work.

16.3.3 Cyanide Leaching Kinetics 

Six kilogram of each mineral sample were ground at a pulp density of about 62.5% solids (by 

weight) in a batch mill to achieve a P80 particle size of 75 microns. The ground material was 

then transferred to a stirred tank where water and lime were added to adjust the solids to 44% 

(by weight) and the pH to 10 respectively. Four aliquots of 2.23 kg wet (1 kg dry) were then 

siphoned to their respective bottles for leaching with cyanide. Three bottle roll leach tests 

were performed to determine the leach kinetic curves of each mineral zone, while the fourth 

bottle roll test was used for CIL test work i.e leaching with carbon. 

Test work to determine the leaching kinetics was conducted in triplicate, starting with a total 

cyanide concentration of the 1000 ppm in the liquor (time zero). The liquor was sampled after

monitored by titration with silver nitrate and rodanine indicator. An aliquot of 100 ml of liquor 

was then separated for chemical analysis of gold and replaced with fresh cyanide solution, 

whose concentration was adjusted to maintain a minimum of 100 ppm free cyanide in the 

bottle. Titration results are shown in Figures 4 to 6. The pH in the bottle was also monitored 

and maintained at 10.5 using milk of lime. The following graphs show the extraction of gold

16.3.4 Cyanide Leaching with Carbon (CIL) 

CIL test work was conducted using one bottle roll per sample at the same conditions of the 

kinetic tests, except for the addition of 30 grams of carbon (Carbomafra 141-S 8x30) to the 

feed. Prior to the test work, the carbon was screened at 300 microns (48 mesh) to eliminate 

the fines. Leaching was conducted for 72 hours, after which the bottles were completely 

emptied and the contents filtered to separate the liquor from the solids. An aliquot of 100 ml 

of the liquor was sent to chemical analysis; the remaining volume was used for wet screening 

the solids at 212 microns (70 mesh) to capture the gold bearing carbon. 

Free cyanide concentration was monitored by titration with silver nitrate and rodanine. 

Cyanide consumption during the CIL test work followed the same trends observed in kinetic 

tests. The obtained gold recoveries were: Met-3 with 91.9%; Met-4 with 91.6%; and Met-5 

with 88.6% (Table 16.3-6).

16.3.5 Conclusions 

The conclusions that can be reached based on the test work are the following: 

1. The grinding tests show that the P80 particle size of 75 microns for the mineral samples 

can be achieved with a standard grinding circuit. 

2. The test work shows consistent results with gold extractions between 88.4% to 92.3% for 

leach tests without carbon and 88.6% to 91.9% for leach tests with carbon. 

3. The maximum gold extraction was achieved after 24 hours of leaching when the ore was 

ground to a particle size of P80=75 microns. 

4. The cyanide consumption at 1,800 ppm was consistent for the all the leach tests. 

No test work to improve the gold extraction by optimizing the parameters of the test work was 

performed; however, this will be examined during the development of the feasibility study 

when additional metallurgical test work will be performed. 

Additional test work is being performed, as of the date of this report, to confirm the results of 

the 2008 test work plus optimization tests. Seven samples were collected as follows from drill 

core that were within the open pit mine as per the mine plan:  three samples extracted from 

the upper and three samples from the lower mineral zones for the pit areas II (south), III 

(central), and IV (north) and one oxide sample extracted from the pit area III.  The seven 

samples will be subjected to the same test procedure as the 2008 test work plus composites of 

each of the three pit areas will be prepared to determine the gold extraction at a finer P80 

particle size of 53 microns. Previous test work by Vale indicated that an additional 3 -5 % gold 

extraction could be obtained with a finer grind.  

A carbon loading test will performed to determine the quantity of carbon that needs to be 

added to the CIL tanks to avoid gold losses in the tailing solution.

16.4 PLANT DESIGN 

The processing operation will include crushing the ore to minus 19 mm and processing it in an 

industry standard carbon in leach and ADR (adsorption, desorption, and recovery) plant 

followed by a detoxification process prior to placing the tailings in an impoundment area. 

The following corresponds to a description of all the different stages of the process for a 6,000 

tonnes per day treatment capacity. 

Figure 16.4-1 through Figure 16.4-7 below correspond to the process flow sheet developed by 

Tecnomin for the project. Each of the figures corresponds to a different stage of the process. 

Figure 16.4-8 and Figure 16.4-9 correspond to two different alternatives for the plant layout. 

The definitive location for the plant will be decided during the feasibility study.

16.4.1 Crushing Circuit 

The open pit run of mine (ROM) ore with a maximum size of 1.0 metre diameter will be 

transported by truck and discharged into the 60 tonne capacity feed hopper at the jaw crusher 

plant or onto an ROM ore 5,000 tonne stockpile. A variable speed 1,500mm wide by 6,000mm 

long apron feeder driven by a 30kW hydraulic system will reclaim the ore from the hopper at 

313 tonnes per hour and discharge the ore onto a 2,400mm wide by 4,800mm long vibrating 

grizzly screen fitted with a 8kW drive. The oversize material will discharge off the grizzly into 

the 1,250mm by 950mm primary jaw crusher fitted with a 160 kW drive. The undersize from 

the grizzly will discharge onto the 1.00m wide by 22m long transfer conveyor fitted with a 

7.5kW drive. The product at a size of 80% passing 150 millimetres will discharge from the jaw 

crusher and will combine with the grizzly screen undersize. The primary crushed material will 

discharge from the conveyor onto a 1.00m wide by 72m long conveyor that will discharge into 

the vibrating screen feed box to feed onto the single deck 1,500mm wide by 4,000mm long 

primary vibrating screen driven with a 4 kW motor. 

The undersize product at a size of 100% passing 19 millimetres from the primary vibrating 

screen will discharge onto the mm 1.00m wide by 112m long conveyor fitted with a 8kW drive 

that will transport the product to the fine ore bin. 

The oversize product from the primary vibrating screen will discharge directly into the HP500 

or equivalent secondary standard cone crusher driven with a 355 kW motor. The crushed 

product at a size of 100% passing 50 mm will feed onto a 1.00m wide by 87m long transfer 

conveyor that will discharge onto 1.00m wide by 54m long secondary screen feed conveyor 

fitted with a 8kW drive. The conveyor will discharge the material onto the double deck 

secondary 3,100mm wide by 6,400m long vibrating screen driven with a 60 kW motor. The 

secondary screen undersize product at a size of 100% passing 19 mm will discharge onto the 

fine ore bin feed conveyor and combine with the primary screen undersize product.  

The secondary screen oversize product will discharge directly into the tertiary HP500 or 

equivalent cone crusher driven with a 355 kW motor. The tertiary crusher product will 

discharge onto the transfer conveyor and the product will combine with the primary screen 

oversize material. The transfer conveyor will feed onto the secondary screen feed conveyor via 

a chute where the material where the material will combine with the secondary crusher 

product. 

The ore from 5,000 tonne fine ore storage bin will be reclaimed with four 0.500m by 4m long 

belt feeders fitted with variable speed drives at a total rate of 266 dry tonnes per hour and 

discharge the ore onto the 1.00m wide by 82m long grinding mill feed conveyor. 

The fine ore will discharge from the primary mill feed conveyor and mix with water and 

reagents to enter the 6m diameter by 9m long (EGL) ball mill fitted with a 6,000 kW drive. 

The area around the crushing plant and storage bins will have sufficient access to be able to 

clear the area of spills with a small front end loader such as a Bobcat.

16.4.2 Grinding Circuit 

The grinding circuit will comprise a single ball mill that will be in closed circuit with 20 inch 

diameter classifying hydrocyclones. Ore at a feed rate of 266 dtph will be mixed with water 

and reagents to produce a slurry with a pH of 10.5 and a density of 72% solids by weight. The 

slurry will feed directly into the fixed speed 6m diameter by 9m long primary ball mill with a 

6,000kW drive complete with an air operated clutch. A mixture of grinding media comprising 

four, three, and two inch diameter steel balls will be utilized to reduce the particle size of the 

fresh ore from 100% passing 19mm to 80% passing 74 microns. The slurry will discharge from 

the primary ball mill into the grinding mill pumpbox. The slurry will be pumped to the 

hydrocyclones with a 16 by 14 slurry pump fitted with a 220kW drive system. The cyclone 

underflow at a density of about 72% solids by weight will feed directly by gravity from the 

cyclone cluster into the primary grinding mill thereby closing the grinding circuit. 

The cyclone overflow discharge slurry at about 40% solids by weight that will contain the fine 

ore particles will be transported via a gravity feed pipeline to the agitated storage tank at the 

head of the carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuit.  

Sumps in the grinding area will reclaim slurry spills and transport the spills to the grinding mill 

pumpbox for processing. Sufficient access will be provided in the design so that ore spills at the 

feed end of the primary mill can been cleared with a small loader. 

16.4.3 Carbon-In-Leach 

The cyclone overflow slurry will feed a 6 square metre horizontal moving trash screen to 

remove the extraneous material prior to the slurry entering the CIL storage13m dia by 15m tall 

tank. The screen oversize material containing the trash will discharge directly into a portable 

holding bin. The CIL holding tank will have sufficient live capacity to store about 4 hour of 

production slurry so that the leaching can continue in spite of minor stoppages of the grinding 

circuit. The slurry will be pumped from the holding tank into the first CIL tank with a 10 by 8 a 

variable speed pump fitted with a 56kW drive. Six CIL mechanically agitated tanks will be 

arranged in a nested counter current flow pattern and will provide 24 hours of retention time 

to dissolve the gold contained in the ore with a weak cyanide solution. Fresh cyanide solution 

and milk of lime will be added into the first CIL tank to achieve a cyanide concentration of 

about 200 ppm (WAD cyanide) and a pH of 10.5. The slurry of the first CIL tank will flow by 

gravity into the second tank. The slurry of the second CIL tank will flow into the third CIL tank 

and so on until the slurry discharges from the sixth or last tank onto the carbon safety screen. 

Each of the CIL tanks will contain activated carbon at a concentration of about 25kg per cubic 

metre of slurry. The carbon contained in the CIL tanks will be advanced to the next tank in line 

by pumping slurry with the carbon in a counter current fashion to the slurry flow. The carbon 

advance sequence will begin at the sixth tank. The gold content or loading of the carbon in the 

sixth CIL tank will be the lowest and the gold content of the carbon of the first CIL tank will be 

the highest. Slurry containing the loaded carbon of the first CIL tank will be pumped from the 

CIL tank with horizontal 6 by 4 pump fitted with a 30 kW drive to a loaded carbon recovery

screen. The screen overflow containing the loaded carbon will be washed with spray water 

after which the loaded carbon will discharge into the loaded carbon holding bin. The screen 

undersize containing the ore slurry will flow by gravity to be returned to the first or second CIL 

tank. 

Each of the CIL tanks will be fitted with a slurry bypass system so that maintenance can be 

performed on the equipment without stopping the CIL circuit. In the event that the first CIL 

tank needs to be bypassed, the slurry from the holding tank will be pumped directly into the 

second CIL tank. In addition, the slurry of the second tank containing the loaded carbon will be 

pumped to the loaded carbon recovery screen as per description above. 

In the event that the sixth tank is stopped, the slurry of the fifth tank will flow directly via the 

bypass piping to the carbon safety screen to recover the transient carbon from the slurry as 

per description below. 

The CIL tanks will contain carbon retention screens to avoid uncontrolled flow of carbon from 

one tank to another. 

The slurry of the sixth or last CIL tank will discharge by gravity onto a carbon safety screen. The 

screen oversize material containing any transient carbon will be washed with water and 

discharge by gravity into a portable holding bin. The screen underflow will discharge directly 

into a CIL tailing pumpbox from where it will be pumped with 10 by 8 pump fitted with a 30 

kW drive to the first mechanically agitated tank of the cyanide destruction system.  

Low pressure air at a total flow rate of about 3,000 cfm and a pressure of 20 psi will be added 

to the CIL tanks via spargers located near the bottom of the tank to provide oxygen to the 

process that is required for the leaching the gold. The sparges will be designed to enable each 

of the sparges to be removed without stopping the air flow to the tanks or the agitation of the 

slurry in the tanks. 

Reagent addition systems will be installed to ensure that the correct concentration of reagents 

in the tanks is maintained to achieve maximum extraction of the gold. 

16.4.4 Cyanide Destruction 

The cyanide destruction system will comprise two mechanically agitated 10m dia by 11.5m tall 

tanks. The slurry containing about 200 ppm WAD cyanide will be pumped from the CIL tailing 

pumpbox into the primary reactor where air, lime, and metabisulphite will be added. Copper 

sulphate solution may be added to achieve a concentration of about 5 ppm or as required to 

accelerate the reaction rate for the cyanide destruction. The discharge from the first tank will 

flow directly into the second tanks where the same chemicals at a lower dosage rate will be 

added to complete the reaction. The discharge from the second reactor will flow directly into 

the final tailing pumpbox and will be transported to the tailing impoundment area. 

16.4.5 Adsorption, Desorption and Recovery Plant (ADR) 

Two tonnes of loaded carbon will be transferred with a 50mm by 50mm recessed impellor 

pump fitted with a 5 kW drive from the loaded carbon bin to the carbon acid wash tank. A

weak solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl will be pumped with 50mm by 50 horizontal pump 

fitted with 5 kW drive into the bottom of the carbon acid wash tank. The overflow stream at 

the top of the acid wash tank will flow by gravity back to the acid wash holding tank from 

where the solution will be recycled to the acid wash tank. Fresh acid will be added to the acid 

wash holding tank to maintain the correct concentration of free acid that is required for the 

process. When the acid wash is complete, the acid solution will be drained into a neutralization 

tank where milk of lime or caustic solution will be added to neutralize the solution to a ph of 

8.0. The neutralized solution will be pumped with a 50mm by 50mm horizontal pump fitted 

with a 5 kW drive to the final tailing pumpbox where it will be mixed with the final tailings and 

transported to the impoundment area. A weak solution of caustic soda will be pumped to the 

acid washed carbon to neutralize the remaining acid contained in the carbon. When the pH of 

the solution discharging from the acid wash tank reaches 8.0, the neutralization cycle is 

complete. Fresh caustic solution will be added to the neutralized solution and the neutralized 

solution will be re-used. Excess solution will be bled from the system into a pumpbox from 

where the solution will be pumped to the final tailing pumpbox.  

The acid washed loaded carbon will be transferred from the holding bin into the vertical 

pressure strip vessel with a 50mm by 50mm horizontal recessed impellor pump fitted with 5 

kW drive. The water utilized to transport the carbon will drain from the pressure vessel into 

the floor sump via Johnson screens. After the water has drained, the pressure vessel will be 

closed and hot strong cyanide solution at a will be pumped into the strip vessel to remove the 

gold from the loaded carbon. The hot cyanide solution will discharge from the strip vessel into 

a pressurized electrowinning (EW) tank where the gold contained in the solution will be plated 

onto the cathode blanks. The hot solution will discharge from the EW tank and be recirculated 

through the direct fired heat exchanger to increase the fluid temperature to the design strip 

temperature. The stripping process will continue until the gold content of the strip solution 

discharging from the vessel achieves a tenor of less than one ppm. Normally, 3 to 5 bed 

volumes (BV) are used to complete the stripping cycle. When the stripping cycle has been 

completed, a hot water wash will be pumped into the strip vessel to remove the remaining 

cyanide solution. The wash cycle will be complete when the cyanide (WAD) content of the 

solution discharging from the strip vessel achieves a concentration of less than 5 ppm. The hot 

water wash will be stored in a holding vessel and will be re-used in the ADR process. 

The gold will be recovered from the strip solution in the electrowinning cells and the gold will 

be removed utilizing a high pressure wash contained within a locked sealed tank. The water 

containing the gold will be pumped from the cathode wash tank with a 50 by 50 pump driven 

with a 7.5 kW motor to a filter press to recover the gold. The water discharging from the filter 

press will be returned to the cathode wash tank to ensure that no gold is lost. The EW and gold 

filtration system will be within a secured system to prevent gold losses. 

16.4.6 Tailing Disposal and Impoundment 

The treated tailing will discharge from the cyanide destruction circuit into a pumpbox fitted 

with 10 by 8 pumps driven by 30kW motors from where the tailing will be pumped to the 



 97

tailing dam. During periods of dam construction to increase its height, the tailing will be 

processed with hydrocyclones to remove the fines that will discharge from the cyclone 

overflow onto the upstream slope of the tailing dam and drain into the impoundment area. 

The coarse sands will discharge from the cyclone underflow onto the top of the dam and will 

be spread with a dozer and compacted with a vibrating roller compactor. 

When no dam construction is being performed, the tailing will discharge directly onto the 

upstream dam face via spigots in strategic locations placed along the dam face to provide an 

even distribution of the tailing into the tailing impoundment area. The reclaim water system 

that will include a barge complete with pumps will be located at a point farthest from the 

tailing discharge points to provide sufficient residence time in the impoundment area to allow 

the solids to settle so that a clear supernatant is available to the pumps for reclaim. The 

reclaim water will be transported with 10 by 8 pumps fitted with 50kW motors to the process 

water tank located in the process plant area. 

The supernatant treatment and seepage pond will be utilized as an emergency system to allow 

excess water to be drained from the impoundment area to avoid overflowing the dam. The 

discharge from the ponds will be of sufficient quality to be able to meet the CONAMA 

standards for discharge of effluents, if discharge is required. The ponds will be utilized to 

capture any water that seeps through the dam structure and this water will be returned to the 

impoundment area via sump pumps.

17. MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 

NCL has been retained by Carpathian to complete the initial NI 43-101 compliant Mineral 

Resource Estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Riacho dos Machados 

Property, and to produce a supporting Technical Report in accordance with the guidelines set 

out in NI-43-101, companion policy NI43-101CP and Form 43-101F1. NCL completed 

estimation of Mineral Resources in May, 2009, which resulted in the News Release published 

on May, 18th, 2009. The NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report for the Resource Estimate 

entitled "Mineral Resource Estimate for the Riacho dos Machados Gold Deposit, Minas Gerais, 

Brazil" dated July 2009, has been completed and filed on the SEDAR electronic file reference 

system. The following section and related geology sections have been taken from this report 

and presented herein. The Mineral Resource Estimate presented herein is based upon the 

results of 11,277 metres of diamond drilling, re-assaying of 5515 metres of old CVRD drill 

holes, study and compilation of historical data. Carpathian has initiated a follow-up drill 

program which is currently in progress as of September 2009. 

The reader is cautioned that the developed preliminary assessment includes inferred mineral 

resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 

applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no 

certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized. No Mineral Reserves have been 

estimated. 

17.1 SOFTWARE USED 

The modelling and geostatistics analysis of the deposit was carried out using two different 

software packages: Gemcom (kriging and block model construction, modelling and exploratory 

data analysis, model validation) and GSLIB (variography and exploratory data analysis).  

17.2 DATA BASE 

Data was supplied by Carpathian in Excel format, exported from Micromine® database, 

consisted of drilling information with assays, survey, collar and lithology, and in DXF format, 

exported from Micromine®, for the solids representing the grade shells and the surfaces 

representing topography and weathering limits. The drilling information supplied consisted 

only of diamond drill holes. The drill holes database was validated using the standard tools 

from GEMCOM and Excel. All the problems detected were reported to Carpathian and were 

corrected. The methodology used by Carpathian for data entry and validation was checked and 

found to be robust.  

The general statistics, from assay data used in the present estimation is given in the table 

below.

The data from CVRD are related to the results of re-assaying of the remains of Carpathian re-

sampling and assaying of the split drill core over selected intervals from drill core stored on-

site. Selection of sampling intervals was based on CVRD core logs and assay results and 

Carpathian's core review. 

17.3 3D MODELLING 

Two groups of wireframes representing the mineralized zone were interpreted and prepared 

by Carpathian and revised by NCL. These were built and reconciled from interpreted hard-copy 

drill-hole cross sections and plan views of geologist interpretation of alteration, lithology, and 

mineralization features. 

One of them is intended to represent the mineralization amenable for open pit mining, with a 

cut-off of 0.3 g Au/t. The reason for choosing this value is that the deposit has a relatively good 

continuity using this threshold, in addition, the low costs of open pit mine production which 

possibly should allow the mining of low grades. Eleven lenses (individual solids) were 

modelled. They were grouped in three veins: the main vein, a footwall vein and a hanging wall 

vein. They were considered as separate entities for evaluation purposes. For example, the 

main vein was estimated using only samples considered as contained within the solid of the 

main vein. Hereinafter this group is called the OP model. 

The other group was built to support the estimation of mineral resources amenable by 

underground mining, using a 1 g Au/t grade shell. A single mineralized zone was considered for 

the different lenses, meaning that the grade of a sample from one lens may influence the 

grade on a different lens. Four different lenses were interpreted by Carpathian. This model is 

called the UG model. 

Three surfaces were also provided by Carpathian: 

• Topographic surface 
• Surface separating the oxide (weathered) from the mixed material 
• Surface separating mixed from fresh material 

17.4 SELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES 

To represent the mineralization, the samples contained within the solids were selected and 

marked according to the vein, and according to the weathering state: oxide, if above the 

oxidation surface; mixed, if below the oxidation surface and above the fresh rock surface; and 

fresh, if below the fresh rock surface. As the interpretation lines were constructed using the 



 100

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

resource called "snapping" (i.e. the lines are tied to the sample position in 3D, and not on its 

projection to a section plane), the selection using the solids marked the samples considered as 

internal to the mineralization zones. 

17.5 OUTLIER ANALYSIS 

The Figure 17.5-1 represents the probability graphs that were used to define the threshold to 

cap the outliers of the studied population. The objective is to limit the influence of very high 

values on the interpolation of grades. If the high values stay in the expected position (a straight 

line in the high end of the probability graph) they may be considered part of the population 

and used in the estimative. Otherwise, they may be capped, to have their value reduced to a 

selected threshold. A common threshold is the one where 99% of the samples have grade less 

than that, but it depends on many other factors, like the adherence of the kriging values to the

17.6 COMPOSITING 

Compositing, i.e. transforming the samples to a fixed length in order to have all values at a 

similar support, is a necessary step before interpolation of results. After a statistical analysis of 

the length of the original samples, 1.0 m was chose for testing. The 1.0 m compositing was 

selected because this value best represent the mode of the samples and its variograms. Almost 

99% of the distributions of lengths have 1m length, therefore choosing this length for 

composition would preserve the detail obtained in the sampling, while still having a good 

statistical agreement between samples and composites. The tables below depict the basic 

statistics of the composites divided by populations, as explained in the item 17.8.

17.8 POPULATION ANALYSIS 

NCL investigated the possibility of separating in different populations. Three different 

populations were used in Open Pit, separated in oxide, mixed and fresh rock. Different 

populations were not used to underground model. The Figure 17.8-1 depicts the accumulated 

histogram for these three populations. 

The other separation made necessary for better estimation of the deposit was the division of 

the OP model between the three main vein classes: the main vein, the footwall vein and the 

hangwall vein. In reality the statistical behavior of the gold in these veins is similar, but the 

study of the vertical section led to the conclusion that the estimate reflects better the drilling 

samples if the veins are treated as separated entities. The Table 17.6-2 reflects the basic 

statistics of these veins.

17.9 VARIOGRAPHY 

Two different types of software were used to carry out the anisotropy analysis, GSLIB and 

GEMCOM. A fan of variograms was studied, analyzing the anisotropy in intervals of 15°, along 

the plane of the mineralization. The best continuity was found along the azimuth 108°, dip -

35°, considering the local system of coordinates.  

Semi-variograms were also tested, but the standard correlograms showed better structure in 

most situations. Therefore, only correlograms were used for variogram modeling.

17.10 KRIGING STRATEGY 

Initially, the stationarity of the deposit was investigated through a moving window technique. 

The conclusion is that the deposits are non-stationary i.e. the average and variance change 

according to the position in the deposit; therefore simple kriging cannot be used. It was 

decided to use ordinary kriging instead. 

Three passes were used. The first pass was used to define measured, the second initial pass 

were used to define the indicated resources. The inferred blocks were used the last pass. The 

underground model the first and second initial passes were used to define the indicated 

resources.

17.11 BLOCK MODEL CONSTRUCTION 

The sequence of block model construction in the GEMCOM software is the following: 

1. Print the orezone code from modeled solids into blocks  

2. Print the densities into blocks according to the lithology 

3. Kriging of the Au grades 

4. Extract the blocks above surface 

5. Classify the resources into measured, indicated and inferred

17.12 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

The classification methodology adopted by NCL follows: 

• Measured resources: blocks that have at least two mineralized intercepts in the 

neighbourhood, considering a distance corresponding to 90% of the variance (D90). The rock 

code of these intercepts must be same as the block being classified, and the intercepts must 

be from three different octants, to force the requirement of two different intercepts.  

• Indicated resources: blocks which have at least two mineralized intercepts in the 

neighbourhood, considering two times the D90 distance. The rock code of these intercepts 

must be same as the block being classified, and the intercepts must be from three different 

octants, to force the requirement of two different intercepts. The indicated blocks were 

classified using the second kriging pass. For the UG model, the first pass also defined indicated 

resources. An additional criteria was used in order to take into account the fact that the old 

pits are indicative of mineralization. For the area more intensely mined, the topography was 

subtracted by 20m, and the inferred blocks located above this surface, for the main vein, were 

upgraded to indicated resources. 

• Inferred resource: blocks estimated using a neighbourhood up to five times the D90 

distance. A single mineralized intercept may be used to estimate inferred resources. 

17.13 MODEL VALIDATION 

To verify the results of the estimation, a set of checks were performed on the model for each 

area: 

• Visual validation of grades and the classification, comparing with the drilling. 

• Comparison with the previous sections and tabulations 

• Comparison between the floating window average grade of composites and 
kriged values (Figure 17.13-1, Figure 17.13-2 and Figure 17.13-3). 

 

In all tests the models were considered consistent and robust.

17.14 RESOURCE REPORTING CRITERIA 

The basic criteria followed in this estimation are as follows: 

• Cut-off based on costs and recovery taken from average industry values under 
similar conditions as the Riacho dos Machados project. 

• The open pit optimizer software "Whittle" was utilized to define the portions 
of the OP block model with reasonable prospects of being economical by open 

pit methods.

• All blocks of the OP model above 0.3 g Au/t cut-off and above the Whittle 
envelope were considered resources. 

• The blocks of the UG model below Whittle envelope were investigated to 
define the portions with reasonable prospects of being economical. The 

relationship between expected resources and distance to infrastructure was 

used to define which zones could support the capital necessary to develop the 

accesses. Inside these zones, blocks above 1 g Au/t cut-off were considered 

resources. 

 

Parameters selected by NCL and used for Whittle optimization and cut-off definition are as

17.16 EXPLORATION POTENTIAL 

Carpathian asked NCL to estimate the exploration potential in the area of the mine. To do this, 

NCL evaluated the volume of the wireframe that was not considered for the mineral resources 

evaluation due to insufficient sampling. The wireframe interpreted by Carpathian's geologists, 

if depleted by the estimated mineral resources, would represent around 12 million tonnes, 

located in depths that would require underground mining for eventual economic extraction. 

The average grade of the samples possibly representative of this volume was also estimated, 

to appreciate the potential of this material. The result is 2.9 g/t, using the average of around 

80 composites. 

This estimate should be used for exploration purposes only, and is not NI 43.101 compliant.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

18. OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

18.1 PRELIMINARY MINING STUDY 

A mine plan was developed for RDM Gold Project to process 2.19 million tonnes of ore per 

year with a peak total material rate of 27 million tonnes per year, and eight years mine life. 

Run of mine (ROM) ore transported by haul trucks to the crusher circuit at the process plant 

where the mineral will be treated in a standard gold extraction and recovery plant. The mine is 

scheduled to work seven days per week or 365 days per year. Each day will consist of three 8-

hour shifts. Four mining crews will cover the operation. Included in these operations will be 

normal drilling, blasting, loading and hauling activities, as well as the supporting functions of 

dewatering, grade control and equipment maintenance. 

The study is based on operating the RDM mine with excavators of 6.7 cubic metre capacity and 

conventional trucks each with a capacity of 40 tonnes for the ore in 3 metre passes, and for 

the waste in 6m benches. This type of equipment is able to develop the required productivity 

to achieve an annual total material peak movement of 27 million tonnes and also have good 

mining selectivity with the minor excavators as defined by the grade control activities. 

18.1.1 Pit Optimization and Mine Design 

Whittle Four-X pit optimization software was applied in conjunction with Gemcom for the 

mining model preparation and actual optimization runs. 

The economic parameters assume a nominal 2.19 million tonnes per year treatment plant 

throughput rate. This rate has been determined as optimal, based on the project's potential 

mineral inventory, its capital requirements and operating cost profile. 

Whittle Pit Optimization Model Construction 

The Whittle Four-X model development was carried out using Gemcom software. Whittle Four-

X uses the amount of metal in a block for assessment, rather than the block's grade value. The 

process calculates the grade from the supplied tonnage and metal content, which are provided 

for each model block. The metal content for each block is calculated using the grade derived 

from the resource estimate. 

Base Parameters 

Table 18.1-1 summarises the base case economic parameters used for Whittle Four-X 

economic shells analysis and mine design. 

The mining cost estimate for the pit optimization process is based on NCL estimate developed 

for similar projects in Brazil. The estimated average life of project mining cost was separated 

into various components such as fuel, explosives, tyres, parts, salaries etc. according to similar 

current operations in Brazil. This resulted in the mining cost estimate of approximately 

US$1.15 per tonne shown in Table 18.1-1.

Whittle Four-X Economic Shells Results 

Table 18.1-2 shows the results of the final optimization run. Pit shells were generated for 

several gold prices, from US$160/oz to US$960/tonne. Figure 18.1-1 through to Figure 18.1-5 

show graphically those results. 

Physically analysing the obtained shells, three sectors can be identified, named as north pit, 

central pit and south pit. The three of them join together in the final geometry. 

Pit 35, obtained for a gold price of US$704 per ounce, was then the selected shell used for final 

pit design. Pit 35 defines a more comfortable scenario, with a strip ratio lower than 10 to 1 and 

incremental costs at about US$700 per ounce. 

It is important to note that the parameters shown in Table 18.1-2 are initial estimates, done at 

the beginning of the project, for the purpose of starting the design process. They are not the 

final economic parameters developed for this study, which are discussed in Section 18.11.

The road width of 20 metres is to accommodate the selected 40 tonne trucks. NCL used the 

10% road gradient, which is common in the industry for these types of trucks. The last three 

benches were designed with a ramp of 15m wide. 

The current mine plan is designed with 6m benches stacked to 12 metres (i.e. double 

benching) for the fresh rock material. Mining costs for this report are based on blasting 12m 

benches for the waste zones and 6m for the ore, to assure a good selectivity. As a high strip 

ratio is expected, this differential drilling and blasting operations don't seem to be difficult, as 

large areas are going to be 100% waste. 

To improve selectivity at the edges of the ore zone, the 6m slice can be mined in two 3m 

passes. In these cases, double sampling will be required for grade control purposes. 

Figure 18.1-6 shows the final pit design. There is a single exit on the east side of the pit which 

gives access to the ROM-pad area, primary crusher and to the waste storage areas. The final 

pit is 1850m long in the north-south direction and 550m wide in the east-west direction. The 

pit bottom is at the 634 metre elevation. The highest wall is about 250 metres on the south-

east side. The total area disturbed by the pit is about 88 hectares.

Mining Phases 

NCL designed a set of five mining phases, or pushbacks, by analysing the Whittle Four-X series 

of nested shells. Bottom pits were selected to project them to surface, applying the overall 

slopes recommendation. These phases are not operational designs as the final pit, because de 

accesses need to be improved. Detail operational designs must be carried out during the 

feasibility study stage of the project. Figure 18.1-7 shows the phases outlines on bench 796. 

Phases 1 and 2 target the ore in the highest grade and lowest strip ratio in the northern and 

southern area of the mine, down to 754m elevation and 748m elevation respectively. 

Phase 3 joins the north pit with the south pit and deeps the pit to 718m elevation at the 

centre, expanding up to final configuration in the north portion. 

Phase 4 expands to final configuration the northeast and the south, going down to 700m 

elevation. 

Phase 5 corresponds to the final expansion at the centre and deeps down to the final 

configuration at 634m elevation.

18.1.2 Pit Contained Resources 

Table 18.1-4 summarises the contained resources for the final pit at several different gold cut-

off grades, and Table 18.1-5 is for the individual mining phases. The tables include measured, 

indicated and inferred resources using the updated May 2009 block model. 

According to the cautionary statement required by NI 43-101, it should be noted that this 

assessment is preliminary in nature since it includes inferred mineral resources that cannot be 

categorized as reserves at this time and as such there is no certainty that the preliminary 

assessment and economics will be realized.

Table 18.1-5: Resources Contained in Mining Phases at Various Cut-Off Grades 

At the marginal cut-off grade of 0.41 g/t gold, calculated from the economical and 

metallurgical parameters detailed in Table 18.1-1, the final pit contains 15.2 million tonnes of 

ore at 1.65 g/t gold and 159.5 million tonnes of total material. 

18.1.3 Mine Production Schedule 

A mine production schedule was developed to show the ore tonnes and grades, tonnes of 

waste material and tonnes of total material by year for the life of the mine. The distribution of 

ore and waste contained in each of the mining phases was used to develop the schedule, 

assuring that criteria such as continuous ore exposure, mining accessibility, and consistent 

material movements were met. 

NCL used an in-house developed system to evaluate several potential mine production 

schedules. Required annual ore tonnes and user specified annual total material movements 

are provided to the algorithm, which then calculates the mine schedule. Several runs at various 

proposed total material movement schedules and different operating cut-off grades for the 

year were carried out to determine an efficient production schedule strategy. It is important to 



 122  

 

 

122 

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

note that this program is not a simulation package, but a tool for calculation the mine schedule 

and haulage profiles for a given set of phases and constraints that must be set by the user. 

The mine plan developed by NCL does not include any special provisions for dilution because 

the resource block model is considered to be already diluted. 

NCL considered a 100% ore mining recovery due to the identified sharp contacts between ore 

and waste and because the main ore zone has been well delineated. Nevertheless, careful 

grade control must be carried out during mining to minimize misplaced ore due to the 

inclination of the orebody. 

Ore control efforts will require taking advantage of all the experience of selective mining to 

assure the ore classes are properly selected and processed. These efforts should include the 

following standard procedures: 

• Implement an intense and systematic program of sampling, mapping, laboratory 
analyses, and reporting. 

• Utilize specialized in-pit, bench sampling drills for sampling well ahead of production 
drilling and blasting. 

• Use small excavators and benches no higher than 6 metres (as presently planned) to 
selectively mine ore zones. 

• Maintain top laboratory staff, equipment, and procedures to provide accurate and 
timely assay reporting. 

• Utilize trained geologists and technicians to work with excavator operators in 
identifying, marking, and selectively mining and dispatching crusher ore, ROM, and 

waste. 

As previously detailed, 0.41 g Au/t corresponds to the marginal cut-off that defines the 

separation between ore and waste. NCL used an operational cut-off, higher than the marginal 

cut-off, as a strategy to improve the grade of the plant feed during the first two years of 

production. This strategy couldn't be extended for a longer period of time because of the 

increase of the total material mined. The material with grades between the marginal cut-off 

and the operational cut-off was considered to be stockpiled for later rehandling. 

Table 18.1-6 and Table 18.1-7 show the final production schedule. Table 18.1-6 shows the 

mine production of ore and low grade ore for each mining year. The schedule is based on 

2,190 ktonnes of ore per year for plant feed. The low grade ore is defined as material between 

0.41 g Au/t and the operating cut-off grade for the year. The table also shows the total 

material movement from the mine by year, which peaks at 27 million tonnes per year during 

commercial production. The limit on the ore production is the number of benches it is possible 

to mine in a year in any single phase. 

The preproduction period requires the mining of 15 million tonnes of total material to expose 

sufficient ore to provide reliable source of ore for the start of commercial production in Year 1.

The preproduction period will require approximately 12 months to complete. The ore mined 

during preproduction will be stockpiled near the crusher to make up part of Year 1 plant feed. 

The plant feed schedule is shown on Table 18.1-7. It shows that Year 1 ore consists of material 

mined during preproduction and Year 1.

The study is based on operating the RDM mine with backhoe excavators each of 6.7 cubic 

metre capacity and 40 tonne conventional haul trucks. This size is consider small for a project 

of this size, i.e. peak monthly material movements of 2.25 million tonnes (27 million tonnes 

per year); however, the current situation at mines in Brazil is that contractors are using this 

type of equipment at lower costs for material movement up to about the same mining rate.

The advantage of the smaller equipment is that it is fabricated in Brazil and does not have the 

large transportation costs and import duties associated with large offshore equipment and 

spare parts. This aspect, combined with availability of spare parts, low local labour rates and 

same type of fleets currently operating in other projects, make the use of this equipment an 

attractive alternative to traditional larger capacity open pit mining equipment. 

This fleet will be complemented with drilling rigs for 4 ½" diameter blast holes for ore and 6" 

diameter for waste.  

Auxiliary equipment includes bulldozers (type CatD9T), motor graders (type Cat160M), front 

end loader (type L580), water truck. 

Mine equipment requirements were calculated based on the annual mine production 

schedule, the mine work schedule, and equipment annual production capacity estimates, and 

maintenance downtime. 

Table 18.1-8 provides a summary of the peak number of units required for preproduction and 

commercial production. Table 18.1-9 provides the fleet requirements by year during the mine 

life. This represents the equipment necessary to perform the following duties: 

• Construct haul and access roads to the initial mining areas as well as to the crusher, 
waste storage areas, and leach pads. Construct additional roads as needed to support 

mining activity. 

• Perform the preproduction development required to expose ore for initial production. 

• Develop new mining faces for ore extraction. 

• Mine and transport ore to the crusher. Mine and transport waste material from the pit 
to the appropriate storage areas. 

• Maintain all the mine work areas, in-pit haul roads, external haul roads, and maintain 
the waste storage areas. 

• Load and transport topsoil to topsoil storage areas.

18.1.5 Mine Personnel 

Mine personnel includes all the salaried supervisory and staff people working in mine 

operations, maintenance, and engineering and geology departments, and the hourly people 

required to operate and maintain the drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, and mine support 

activities. 

Salaried Staff 

Mine salaried staff requirements over the project life are shown in Table 18.1-11. The staff 

consists of 9 persons for preproduction, 41 persons for Year 1, and 46 from Year 2 through 

Year 8. 

Of the 46 persons assigned for Years 2 through 8, 13 are in mine operations, 11 in mine 

maintenance, 14 in mine engineering, and eight in mine geology.  

Annual costs for the personnel, including fringe benefits, are shown on Table 18.1-11. The 

personnel costs used for this project correspond to actual Brazilian costs used by NCL during 

2008 and 2009 for similar projects. Exchange rate 1.95 R$/US$ was considered.

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Hourly Labour 

Mine total hourly personnel requirements are shown in Table 18.1-12. The required number of 

personnel is 133 during preproduction. The maximum number of persons during commercial 

production is 276 in Year 4. Year 7 personnel requirements reduce significantly due to 

reduction of pit operations. 

Table 18.1-12 also shows the annual cost for hourly personnel, including fringe benefits. The 

personnel costs used for this project correspond to actual Brazilian costs used by NCL during 

2008 and 2009 for similar projects. Exchange rate 1.95 R$/US$ was considered. 

As shown on Table 18.1-12, the majority of persons in mine operations are equipment 

operators. The number of operators for major equipment was calculated based on equipment 

operating requirements. 

Additional mine persons are assigned to perform the following tasks: 

• Pumpman. Set pumps and pipe as required and use small excavators for building 
sumps. 

• General labourer. The general labourer is an unskilled worker who assists with many of 
the mine support activities such as moving and setting pumps, road maintenance, 

general mine cleanup, etc. 

There is not an allowance for blasting personnel in the estimate. Blasting will be performed by 

a contractor and the personnel costs are included in the price of the service. 

Table 18.1-12 also shows the number of maintenance personnel required for each time period. 

It can be seen that the ratio of maintenance personnel to operations personnel is about 36% to 

45% during the mine life, except for the last two years where the maintenance crew remain 

the same and the operators were reduced. The number of operators is quite high and they will 

assist with some routine maintenance activities for the equipment which they are assigned to. 

Operators will be trained to assist with lubrication, filter replacement, and tire replacement 

and assist the mechanics with repairs. Also, most of the equipment will only have 25,000 to 

30,000 hours at the end of the mine life so that this should result in minimal maintenance 

costs and maintenance personnel requirements. 

An additional allowance in the manpower is required to cover vacations, sick leave, and 

absenteeism (VS&A). The 6% VS&A allowance is based on 30 vacation days plus 6 sick days out 

of 356 scheduled days per person per year.

18.1.6 Mine Capital Cost 

The estimated mine capital cost includes the following items: 

1. Mine major equipment. 

2. Mine support equipment. 

3. Shop tools. 

4. Initial spare parts. 

5. Engineering and geology equipment. 

6. Mine preproduction development expense. 

This estimate does not include the following mine physical structures: 

1. Fuel and lubricant storage facilities.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

2. Explosive storage facilities. 

3. The mine shop, offices, and warehouse. 

It is anticipated that the vendors will provide storage for fuel, lubricants, and explosives as part 

of their contract of work and that the prices for these items are included in the delivered price. 

The mine shop and warehouse are included in the infrastructure capital cost prepared by 

Tecnomin for this study. 

Table 18.1-13 summarizes the mine capital costs by category for initial capital period. The 

initial capital period is the 24 months period from preproduction (12 months) through Year 1. 

Mine preproduction development of US$ 17.0 million during "PP" is based on the estimated 

mine operating costs during the preproduction period. Details of this calculation are discussed 

in Section 18.1.7. 

Mine equipment includes all the items on Table 18.1-131 except preproduction development. 

Initial mine equipment capital is US$ 16.2 million during PP and Year 1. Sustaining capital is 

required because mine fleet increase and replacement of hauling trucks during Year 5 and 

amounts to US$ 12.4 million. 

An equipment salvage credit is also shown on Table 18.1-13 and Table 18.1-14. This amounts 

to US$ 7.6 million over the project life. The salvage value was set to 30%, because of the low 

operating hours, for all of the equipments at the end of the useful life. This credit occurs when 

replacement is required, but most was allocated at the end of mine life in Year 8 (Table 

18.1-15). 

Table 18.1-14 also shows the equipment unit prices used for this study. The following is noted: 

1. Base equipment prices are shown in constant 1st quarter 2009 US dollars in the 

year in which the equipment is required. It is assumed that payment for the 

equipment is made at the time of delivery. 

2. The costs for major equipment are based on quotes obtained by NCL for this 

project during the first quarter of 2009. 

3. The capital costs shown include delivery to the site and assembly. 

4. Exchange rate of 1.95 Brazilian Real per every US dollar was considered for 

mine equipment, when applicable. 

5. A contingency is not included in the mine capital cost. It is likely that final 

negotiated sales prices, with fleet discounts, will be somewhat lower than the 

budget quotes used for this study.

18.1.7 Mine Operating Cost 

Mine operating costs were developed from the recommended equipment requirements 

presented in Section 18.1.4 and the personnel requirements presented in Section 18.1.5. The 

mine operating costs include all the parts, supplies, and labour costs associated with mine 

supervision, operation, and maintenance. Table 18.1-16 summarizes the total mine operating 

costs. Total cost, unit cost per total tonne of material, and unit cost per ore tonne are shown 

for the preproduction development period and for commercial production years.

 Table 18.1-16: Summary of Total and Unit Mining Costs 

The preproduction period costs on Table 18.1-16 are the source for the mine development 

cost of US$ 17.0 million that is reported as preproduction development. This amounts to 

US$ 1.135 per total tonne of material during this period. 

Total mine operating cost during commercial production is US$ 168.7 million. This amounts to 

US$ 1.168 per total tonne of material and US$ 11.108 per ore tonne during this period. 

Operating hours were calculated from estimated productivities for the selected mine 

equipment, summarised in Table 18.1-17. Hourly costs were also estimated for the mine 

equipment, summarised in Table 18.1-18.

Table 18.1-18: Summary of Hourly Costs 

Table 18.1-19 presents the mining costs in total dollars by the various cost centres (drilling 

blasting, loading, etc.) for each year. Table 18.1-20 presents a similar summary in dollars per 

total tonne. 

The following factors are considered for the operating cost calculations: 

1. Local unit costs for consumable items such as diesel fuel and blasting agents. 

2. Local hourly labour rates and fringe benefits were used. 

3. Local costs for tires and spare parts were used. 

4. Constant exchange rate of 1.95 Brazilian Real per US dollar. 

The general activities that are included in the operating cost estimate are as follows: 

1. Construct the initial out-of-pit mine access roads from the pit area to the ore 

crusher, waste storage areas, and stockpile areas. 

2. Removal and storage of the topsoil within the pit area. 

3. Preproduction development required to expose ore for initial production. 

4. Mine and transport ore to the crusher area. Loading and transport ore from the 

stockpile area to the crusher. Mine and transport waste material from the pit to 

the waste storage areas. 

5. Maintain all the mine work areas, in-pit haul roads, and external haul roads. Also 

maintain the waste storage areas.

18.1.8 Underground Mining Potential 

Additional mineral resources, not included in the designed open pit of this study, named as 

underground resources amount to 5.1 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 2.89 g Au/t, 

according to the tonnage and grade curve detailed in Table 18.1-21. Note that tonnages of

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Table 18.1-21 exclude the material within 20m below the open pit, considered at this stage as 

unrecoverable resources because of the necessity of a crown pillar for any possible 

underground alternative. 

A preliminary desktop analysis was carried out for this mineral resource by applying typical 

numbers for underground mining, ore recovery of 80% and dilution of 15%. A total of 

4.0 million tonnes at 2.57 g Au/t and 332 thousand ounces contained, down to elevation 420, 

(approximately 250 m below the bottom of the open pit) were estimated as with potential for 

underground mining (Figure 18.1-8). Even though the mineral resource extent is down to level 

75, because of the current number of drill holes for the underground resource, the tonnages 

and continuity below 420 level do not support the require vertical development and further 

work will be required to evaluate that portion of the mineralization. 

It should be noted that the 5.1 million tonnes only represents that portion of the underground 

resources that can be accessed directly from beneath the open pit and does not include all of 

the potential underground mineral resources referred to in Section 17.16. 

Caution: The underground mining preliminary assessment that is preliminary in nature, it 

includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the 

economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorised as mineral 

reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realised.

Figure 18.1-8: Underground Mineable Resources – Vertical Distribution 

Mining Method and Production Rate 

The underground mining method proposed is sublevel open stoping. Stopes will be 100% 

backfilled and no rib or crown pillars will be left except where geological structures dictate 

otherwise. A mining rate of 2,000 tonnes per day, equivalent to 730,000 tonnes per year, 

seems to be reasonable for the total estimated mineable resources and consistent with 

Taylor's Law and McCarthy and Tatman optimum rate of vertical depletion. 

For the current recognised extension of the orebody and the selected production rate, the 

underground project will have a life of mine of 5.5 years. 

Capital Expenditure 

Based on NCL experience on similar projects, an initial capital of US$ 40 million is estimated for 

mine development and plant expansion, during a two years period for implementation; plus 

US$ 17.5 million for sustaining capital, mainly for development to deepen the mine. 

• US$ 35 million for initial mine development, infrastructure and mine equipment 

• US$ 5 million for plant expansion 

• US$ 17.5 million for mine development, US$ 3.5 million per year during 5 years. This is 
equivalent to 1,750 metres of development per year at a unit cost of US$ 2,000 per 

metre. 

Underground Operating Cost 

Operating costs for underground have been estimated as US$ 20.7 per tonne, which adding to 

the estimated US$ 8.05 per tonne for processing and US$ 1.25 per for G&A, gives a total 

operating cost of US$ 30 per tonne. 

The estimate has been derived from comparison to underground mines of similar sizes in Brazil 

and Chile.

Economical Analysis for the Underground Operation 

The economic analyses are preliminary and based on costs and mining methods derived from 

in-house information from other similar operations in Chile and Brazil. A simple cash flow 

model was prepared to analyse the economics of the underground mining potential, 

considering the following assumptions: 

• Gold price at US$ 900 per ounce 
• 2% royalties 
• 90% metallurgical recovery 
• US$ 10 per ounce for freight, insurance, refining 
• 5% discount rate 
• Constant year average grade of 2.57 g/t 
• Capital expenditure and production ramp-up schedules as detailed in Table 18.1-22.

Conclusions 

From the Tables and Figures above the following can be concluded and recommended: 

• Adding an underground mining component to the project can add further value to the 
project, even with the worst estimated operating cost scenario. 

• The base case, considering a total operating cost of US$ 30 per tonne, gives a a stand 
alone pre-tax NPV5 of US$ 56.4 million and an IRR of 35.2%, if implemented together 

with the open pit operation. 

• NCL recommends to improve the confidence of the underground mineral resource by 
completing a detailed drilling program to outline this resource and upgrade the 

resource category and confidence level 

• Following the resource drilling, it is recommended that the potential underground 
scenario be evaluated during the feasibility study or post feasibility study to determine 

the best timing to bring this resource into operation during the open pit mining time 

frame and whether or not it is suitable to expand the plant an additional 2,000 tpd to 

accommodate this extra production or to maintain the plant production rate at 6,000 

tpd and feed a higher grade material to the process plant.

18.2 GEOTECHNICAL STUDIES 

The Riacho dos Machados open pit mine stopped operation shut down on March of 1997. 

There were five continuous pits areas along a total extension of 1350 metres, with 110 metres 

of width and a maximum depth of 80 metres, aligned in the direction N20ºE, with individual 

slopes projected to have 10 m of height, with an angle of 45º for the face slope in the footwall 

(SBC, 2003). 

In many places collapses took place, as can be observed in several internal memorandums 

prepared by Vale. Most of the times the collapses took place in the footwall, along the 

schistosity of the rock and the conjugation of this schistosity with sub-parallel faults (F1). In the 

hanging wall the collapses were more restricted, limited to one or more faults. 

The actual mean inclination of the individual slopes is between 30° and 40°, less than 45° 

executed in the projects. The collapses caused this smaller inclination that is compatible with 

the foliation dip. 

A preliminary study was prepared according to the following stages:  

• Analysis of historical data. 

• On site inspection. 

• Definition of the geomechanical model and the failure mechanisms. 

• Determination of the strength parameters on the basis of secondary data. 

• Stability analyses. 

• Preliminary definition of the global slope angles and bench design. 

•  

18.2.1 Structural Geology 

The predominant structure in the mine area is defined by a shear zone, marked by prominent 

milonitic foliation with Sc forms associated. The milonitic foliation presents an average 

direction N20°E/40°SE, containing mineral lineation with mean attitude S38°E/38°. Faults (F1), 

sub-parallel to the schistosity are also common. 

From-cores observations, the dip of the orebody smoothed out with depth. In brittle zones, 

faults occur perpendicular and parallel to the milonitic foliation (SBC, 2003). 

A compilation of the results of structural data reported from internal memorandums of the 

Vale and SBC (report of 2003). Results are presented in Table 18.2-1and Figure 18.2-1

18.2.2 Geomechanical Characterization 

Until 1997, the mining was developed down to the elevation 800m in rock which predominant 

strength and weathering degree is the R2/R1 W4/W5 of low geomechanical strength. Almost 

all the slopes are in the same type of weathered material, with the exception of the horizons 

nearest to the surface, which are more weathered.  The open pit developed for the PEA has a 

final depth to the elevation of 630 metres so that there is a variey of rock types encountered 

for the pit slopes beginning with weathered material.  As a result of the rock type variation, it 

will be necessary to understand better the geomechanical characteristics of the rock mass and 

types at depth by performing characterization studies including tests in the laboratory of the 

drill core.

18.2.3 Geomechanical Characterization of Drill-Core 

Carpathian has carried out geomechanical description of the drill core from their drilling 

program in the third quarter of 2008.  During a site visit in June, Golder Associates evaluated 

the descriptive methodology used by Carpathian for the drill core as per the following 

Three random drill holes were chosen (FRM 16, FRM 39 and FRM 44) to check the logging 

description. It was observed that the data was coherent, in other words, the rock with the 

strength parameter identified as R0 has similar characteristics of strength in all the three drill 

holes; however, the classification appeared to differ slightly from the standard. The rock 

described with R0 strength would be better classified as R2, the rock described as R2 would be 

better classified as R3 and the rock described as R3 would be better classified as R4. 

The description for weathering, RQD and fracturing are in accordance with industry standard 

methods. The characterization suggested by the International Society for Rock Mechanics 

(1981), is presented in Table 18.2-2 and Table 18.2-3 and the Bieniawski classification (1989) is 

presented in Table 18.2-4and Table 18.2-5.

18.2.4 Strength Parameters 

The Hoek-Brown classification method, named as GSI (Geological Strength Index) and the 2000 

update of his failure criterion was used to determine the preliminary geomechanical 

parameters of the various rock masses. The estimate of the properties of a rock mass based on 

this criteria consists of estimating (laboratory results can also be used) the uniaxial 

compression strength of the intact rock and the material constant, called "mi", which is 

relative to friction properties of the intact rock.  The most important component of this system 

for rock mass classification is the process of reduction of the strength constant of the intact 

rock and the "mi", originated from laboratory tests or estimated, to values of the in situ rock 

mass 

A quick analysis of the drill cores with rock classes according to the RMR and the observation 

of photos of the drill core provided the information for classification according to the 

corresponding GSI. With the application of the GSI tables, the geomechanics parameters were 

estimated for the rock masses. 

The GSI was based on the values of RMR (Table 18.2-6), obtained by the relation: 

GSI = RMR1989 – 5 as initial reference.

For the joints it was considered a friction angle of 25°, greater than the value of 20° used by 

the SBC in his study of 2003. 

18.2.5 Failure Mechanism 

The variation of the schistosity and of the anastomosing faults (F1's) attitudes along the dip 

and the direction is the principal condition for the failures that occurred in the mine slopes 

(SBC, 2003). Normally the dip is situated between 30° and 35° in the deeper portions of the 

mine (on average 50 m deep) and between 40° and 50° near to the surface. The direction can 

vary 20° to 30° in short distances. 

The direction of the schistosity has decisive influence on the stability of slopes, as a sharp 

change of this direction with the direction of the slope causingunstable wedges. Folding 

patterns in a dome-basin type situation where the axes has inclination between 30° and 35° 

can also contribute to destabilization. 

Anastomosing faults, named as F1, derived from shear, can also cause destabilization. These 

faults  are subparallel to the schistosity. Locally, present lower dip or discordance directions at 

about 20° to 30° within the slope is enough to compromise the stability of an area. These 

failures occur indiscriminately in all rock mass and are unpredictable and can make it a 

constant risk to the slopes. 

Other faults and associated fractures with the direction of schistosity contribute to the 

formation of wedges, mainly the fault with NW direction and dip to SW (N15°W / 40°SW). This 

feature occurred in Area III of the previous mining operation, where there were two  

significant failures. 

Based on geo-structural and geotechnical characteristics and on geometric configuration of the 

slope, it was considered that the following types of failure may occur. 

Circular Failure

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Occurs throughout the rock mass, where geological structures have lower prevalence for this 

type of failure mechanism. The mobilized strength parameters are of the rock mass. 

Plane Failure  

The mobilized strength parameters are a result of discontinuity. This type of failure can occur; 

however, it is necessary that the plane of discontinuity dips into the pit at an angle lower than 

the slope angle. Additionally, it is necessary that this plane direction to be parallel or sub 

parallel to the face of the slope. 

Wedge Failure  

The case of wedge failure is similar to the plane failure. However, in this case is the line of 

intersection between the two planes, which define a wedge, should be less than the angle of 

the slope to meet the requirement geometric / kinematic slip. 

Plane-Wedge Failure  

Plane-rotational failures, landslides combined by foliation and the rock mass may occur. In this 

case the foliation is parallel or sub parallel to the direction of the face of the slope, with dip 

into the pit.  

The failure may be given by the foliation (the top) coupled with rotational failure on bottom 

along the rock mass. The strength parameters involved are of the schistosity at the top and the 

bottom of the rock mass. 

18.2.6 Ground Water Conditions 

In this study, as there is very little ground water in the region, it was considered that the slope 

will be in a drained condition. 

18.2.7 Stability Analysis 

This study includes rotational, plane-rotational, plane and wedge failures analysis. 

For the analysis of global stability, considering rotational and plane-rotational failures,   the 

limit equilibrium method of "Bishop Simplified" and "Spencer" incorporated into the software 

Slide, Rocscience, CA was used. An  anisotropic strength model of material properties due to 

the schistosity was also utilized. 

In the study of stability, a minimum Safety Factor (SF) of 1.30 was established. 

Plane and wedge bench failure kinematics analysis was carried out through the Kinematic 

Bench Design, developed by Golder, which allows an analysis of cumulative frequency of 

failures. In the study, a 25% accumulated frequency of failure with FS <1 is considered 

acceptable.. 

These kinematic analysis, however, take into account only the friction angle of the 

discontinuities, therefore their results were used only for the most weathered rock mass. For 

the fresh rock, theSwedge program was used that also allows the entry of parameters of 

cohesion in the discontinuities.

Results of Limit Equilibrium Analysis 

A back-analysis of the actual west slope was done first , because of several failures that 

occurred in the past. An anisotropic distribution of the rock mass strength, simulating a 

condition of greater weakness of the rock mass in the plane of the schistosity was used. The 

geometry of the west slope varies between 30° and 32°, with a regional trend showing a slope 

angle of around 38°. The result of the analysis (Golder Report - RT-001_099-515-3012_00-B - 

Appendix D) was consistent with the strength parameters estimated. 

Also, stability analyses were carried out for the total height of the slope design, about 250m, 

for both the west and the east wall. 

The results, which figures are presented in the Golder Report  (RT-001_099-515-3012_00-B -

Appendix C  - Figures 4 to 6) that show the overall angles have safety factors (SF) exceeding 

1.30. 

 

Results of kinematic analysis of bench failure 

The analyses that were performed for plane and wedge bench failure showed that the 

condition of a wedge failure is more frequent in the west wall. Analyzing the graphs of 

cumulative frequency of failure, and considering a limit of approximately 25% to these failures, 

the slope face angle of the west wall should be close to the values of 37° and for the east wall 

should be around 55° (Golder Report - RT-001_099-515-3012_00-B -Figures 1 to 4, Appendix 

B). 

This type of analysis was conducted primarily for the slopes in the weathered zone (Class V / 

IV), where the planes of the discontinuities have lower strength. 

Results of wedge failure analysis using Swedge 

The analysis results for the transition zone and fresh rock showed that the rock could support 

greater face angles, as can be  seen in the Golder Report  - RT-001_099-515-3012_00-B - 

Appendix E. 

Results of wedge failure analysis using Swedge 

Considering the results of the three types of analyses above, the following slope geometry 

shown in Table 18.2-8 could be obtained.

18.2.8 Waste Storage 

A waste storage capacity analysis was carried out for a total requirement of about 100 million 

cubic metres, taking into account  a possible mine expansion in later years.. Seven locations 

were identified, in which many layouts were tested to achieve the required storage capacity. 

Waste storage characteristics are presented in Table 18.2-9

Table 18.2-9: Waste Storage Options 

Based on the alternatives and capacities of the table above, and the volume requirement 

according to the mine plan, several options were selected for the waste storage. Golder 

recommends the following two alternatives: 



 149

• Alternative 1: PDE-1 and PDE-2. Total volume 115.5Mm3 (Figure 18.2-2) 

• Alternative 2: PDE-1 and PDE-3. Total volume 110.0Mm3 (Figure 18.2-3) 

 

 

Figure 18.2-2: Waste Dumps – Alternative 1 

 

Figure 18.2-3: Waste Dumps – Alternative 2 

During the site inspection, waste storage foundation conditions were viewed. Waste storae 

will be placed over residual soil comprising granites/gneiss/schists (PDE-1), schists (PDE-2, PDE-

3, PDE-6 e PDE-7) e and granite-gneiss (PDE-1, PDE-4 e PDE-5), and no problems are expected  

in terms of the geotechnical stability for waste storage areas. 

The waste dumps design criteria are listed below: 

• Slope angle among berms: 2H:1V (26.6º); 



 150  

 

 

150 

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA.

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

• Bench maximum height: 10 m; 
• Berm width: 6 m; 
• Overall slope angle: 2.6H:1V (21.0º). 

Golder recommends Alternative # 1 as the preferred option for waste storage  considering that 

the two storage areas are both located on the east side of open pit, which is the same side of 

exit haul road from the open pit. 

18.2.9 Tailings Dam 

The volume of tailing expected to be produced during mine operation was estimated to be 

14.2 million cubic metres (dry mass). For now, it was estimated an additional water storage 

volume of 2.0 million cubic metres is required for estimate the tailing pond spillway and dike 

crests. 

During site inspection, from June, 2
nd

 to 3
rd

, 2009, two potential areas for tailings disposal were 

identified that could achieve the total impoundment requirement: Mumbuca and Olaria 

creeks. Future dikes locations were inspected and the following observations were made: 

• No soft soil was identified in the dam areas. 

• Some rock outcrops were found in the valley. 

• Residual soil from granite/gneiss rock was found in the creeks and shoulders. 

These locations present good foundation conditions for both dams. However, nothing can be 

said for now in terms of foundations treatment such as grouting that is quite common in 

situations where shallow fractured rock is found, as there is no geotechnical information, 

which will be required. 

Tailings dam options characteristics are presented in Table 18.2-10.

Table 18.2-10 analysis shows that storage to dike volume ratio of BR-01 option is much higher 

than BR-02 option, which leads to the conclusion that it is more effective in terms of storage 

for the same volume of compacted earth dike. In addition, it has smaller maximum height and 

dike volume. Golder suggests BR-01 option as the tailings dam location. 

It is also important to say that it was observed during site inspection that Olaria creek 

watershed, where BR-01 option is located, seems to be much more impacted by human 

activities than Mumbuca creek watershed. This fact seems to make option BR-01 also more 

attractive than BR-02 option.

18.3 HYDROLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY 

18.3.1 Regional Hydrology 

A set of five aquifer systems with similar lithological and hydrogeological characteristics were 

identified in the watershed as follows to conceptualize aquifer like conditions: 

• Detrital Cover System, which encompasses all surface aquifers which are associated with 
the weathering layer, saprolite, elluvium, colluviums and tertiary and quaternary ages 

cover aquifers. Weathering layer aquifers have variable thicknesses and are 

heterogeneous with characteristics of original bedrock. The top aquifers are related to the 

final stage of erosive processes and are made of sandy or clayish sediments, or even 

gravel. 

• Pelitic System, which is a fractured aquifer, storing water in pelitic or psamitic rock. They 
constitute clays, siltstone, arkose and thin banded of the arenite, stone comprising 

limestone and clay, and limestones. 



 152

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

• Quartzitic System, which includes storage in quartizic fractured aquifers associated with a 
bunch of geological units, mainly in Schists-Gneisses-Migmatites and Gneisses-Granites 

Associations. 

• Schistose System, which comprises water storage in a set of fractured zones, including 
schistous rock aquifers. Lithotypes most representatives are mica-schists, diamictites, 

phyllites, meta-conglomerates, calc-schists, meta-graywacke and sericitic quartzites. 

• Gneiss-Granitic System, which belongs to the class of fractured type aquifer, has a wide 
domain. Gneiss and Granitic rock occurs with many associations. 

Water productivity for the aquifer system was estimated according to COPASA-MG and 

Hidrosistemas database (1995). In accordance with this study, Porteirinha city, located about 

30 kilometres from RDM, has 93 wells registered while the city of Riacho dos Machados, 

located 15 kilometres from RDM mine site has 22 wells registered, for a total of 115 wells in 

the area, many of them belonging to COPASA-MG, for use as potable water. 

At Porteirinha city, the deepest well is 154 m while the shallowest well is 21.7m of depth and 

the average depth of the wells is 87 m. At Riacho dos Machados city, teh average depth of the 

wells is 73 m. 

Predominant aquifer systems in installed wells are the Gneiss-Granitic and the Schistous 

Systems (48 wells), representing 41.7% of the occurrences. The Pellitic System is represented 

by 23 wells drilled in limestone, and when predominant the karstic-fractured aquifer type 

represents around 20% of the occurrences. Detritic System represents 4.3% of the drilled wells 

(5 unities), generally installed in the weathered layer, having small depths. The 34% remaining 

wells have no information about the installed lithology. 

The observed productivity in wells installed in fractured aquifers (gneiss rocks) show a mean 

value of 3.5 m
3
/h, varying between 0.14 m

3
/h and 24.0 m

3
/h, the same is observed when the 

wells are installed in granite rock, and occasionally achieve a water pumping rate of 10.3 m

In the schists, the observed mean flow value is 6.8 m
3
/h, with a maximum of 23.8 m

3
/h. 

Observed mean productivity is about 5.5 m
3
/h. 

The main groundwater reservoir is located in karstic-fractured and fractured aquifers but 

predominantly in the first case, which covers approximately 2/3 of the Verde Grade river 

watershed in its western portion, located a long distance from the mine site. 

Generally, wells were drilled with initial diameter of 10" to 12" in weathering rocks. For fresh 

rock the diameter of 6" (the most frequent) or 8" was used. Static water level varies among 

1.4m and 80 m. Around 43.5%of registered wells have depth greater than 30 m. Drawdown 

produced in pump tests varies among 1,0 m and 74,1 m, with value mean 27 m, regarding that 

this information refers to 24h duration tests at the most.

Generally, groundwater flows from higher topographic portions to the net of surface drainage 

of the basin, constituting the base flow. The directions of flow converge for the principal lines 

of the net of drainage of the Gorutuba river watershed. 

Areas which predominate the fractured aquifer type are characterized by peneplane, 

sedimentary cover and a weathering layer of clayish composition and generally have low 

permeability and less favorable conditions for re-charge.  

In the Water Management Plan of Verde Grande River Watershed (TECNOSOLO and EPTISA, 

1996), there were estimated volumes for groundwater and aquifer storage capacities. 

Hydrograph of fluviometric gauges were analyzed and the results were fed into 

aSACRAMENTO model. The main aspects observed in the work are as follows: 

• Groundwater represents a significant part of total water flow, summing up to 30 % of the 
mean annual surface water flow of Verde Grande river watershed; 

• Aquifer storage capacity is relatively small, less than annual groundwater flow volume, 
which limits its regularization capacity to the order of the hydrological year (October to 

September);  

• This limitation is noted in the driest years, in which groundwater is significantly reduced, 
affecting directly the base line flow rate. 

18.3.2 Mine Hydrogeology 

Local hydrogeological characterization was carried according to secondary data (MDGEO, 

2005; MULTIGEO, 2008). In September of 2004, in the dry season, MDGEO completed an 

inventory of water occurrences at the mine site and the neighbouring area. In accordance with 

this study, water springs represent indirect contributions to Piranga stream, since they are 

punctual and subjected to infiltration and evaporation, dry bed or with small puddles of water. 

The register of springs in the influence area of the mine included the hydrological basins of the 

Piranga stream (17 registers) and of the Ribeirão stream (16 registers). Tubular wells, manual 

wells and the shaft water level were also evaluated.  

Analysing inventory points along the Piranga stream watershed, five are just inside its drainage 

channel and are dry, showing only puddles of water. Close to the stream, there were four 

registered wells. At Manga creek, left margin Piranga's tributary, a water intake for human 

supply was observed.. 

Towards the southern portion of the mine, the Piranga's right margin unnamed tributary has 

watersprings about 300 m east of the old open pit area III. . This creek also had a  dry bed at 

the time of inspection.. Dike 02 creek is Piranga's right margin tributary that begins close to 

mine entrance and was also dry at the time of inspection. 

In the Ribeirão stream watershed, into which the Mumbuca and Olaria creeks flow, there were 

three water occurrence points registered along it and at the confluences of the Mumbuca and 

Olaria creeks. During the dry season, the Ribeirão stream usually shows only puddles of water.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

The Olaria and Mumbuca creeks were inpsected by the Golder for possible location of the 

tailings dams, and it was observed that the beds were both dry, even though it had rained just 

a few hours before. 

The Olaria creek has its springs inside the old Pit area IV, which is now closed. In this 

watershed, 8 water occurrences were registered, including a security dike, one spring, two 

dikes, two manual wells and two monitoring wells. The spring is approximately 15 m 

downstream from the security dam and the monitoring wells are about 30 m and 60 m 

downstream. There is also a well which supplied the mine office and cafeteria. 

The Mumbuca creek is composed of three main tributaries. Dike 3 were installed at west 

tributary, while the other ones had their springs under waste dump areas and just downstream 

to old open pit  VPit , and all flow to the Dike 1 reservoir. At the time of inventory, Mumbuca 

creek was flowing, however during Golder's site visit it was dry. 

According to MDGEO (2004), most of the tributaries of the Piranga stream were dry, although 

in some points, water flow rates in a range from <<0,1 L/s to 9 L/s.  At the Ribeirão stream 

watershed, water flow rates were estimated at <<0,1 L/s to 1,4 L/s. 

Installed wells shown a mean flow of 9.0m3/h, except one which showed a flow of almost 60 

m3/h (near to the RDM mine), operated by COPASA-MG. One of the main characteristics of the 

wells is that the wells are situated in the schistous rocks. Wells static water levels were 

observed in range from 2.10 m to 13.0 m in depth and observed wells water drawdown among 

14 m and 50 m in depth. Wells mean depth is about 78 m. 

18.4 INFRASTRUCTURE  

18.4.1 Gold Transport 

The gold produced at the mine will be bullion with each bar weighing about 15 to 20 kilograms. 

It is anticipated that each two weeks, the gold will be shipped from the mine site to Belo 

Horizonte by helicopter or airplane. A security company will take possession of the gold bars at 

the refinery and transport them by armoured car to the aircraft for shipping to Belo Horizonte. 

The production rate of gold is estimated to be about 8,000 to 9,000 ounces per month for the 

life of mine. 

18.4.2 Power Supply 

The electrical power will be supplied to the project via a 34.5kV line beginning at Janauba, 

some 35 km of right of way. The upgraded power line will follow the same route as the existing 

13.8kV power line that currently supplies electrical power to the project site. 

The power distribution will be provided in three voltages: 34.5 kV, 6.6kV, and 460 volt for 

equipment with motors less than 225 kW. 

The electrical demand for the operations is estimated at 9.5 MW.

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Substations will be installed at Janauba and the project site. The power consumption will be 

measured at the Janauba substation. 

18.4.3 Water Supply and Management 

The majority of the water for the operations will be obtained from the recycle of the tailing 

supernatant at a rate of 148.5 m
3
 per hour. The fresh water will obtained from water storage 

ponds at a rate of about 200 m
3
 per hour of which 88.5 m

3
 per hour will be make-up water for 

the process and 40 m
3
 per hour for the ADR plant, 37 m

3
 per hour for dust control at the 

crushing plant, and 20 m
3
 per hour for potable water. Water for dust control of the roads will 

be obtained from the fresh water supply system. 

Two water compacted earth retention dams will be constructed to capture rain and run-off 

water during the rainy season that will be used for the fresh water supply. 

The flow sheet that shows the water distribution is shown in Figure 18.4-1. A detailed water 

balance will be prepared for the feasibility study. 

18.4.1 Communications 

The operations will have full internet and intranet services to be able to communicate 

between the different areas of operations plus the corporate offices.  

A direct dialling PABX telephone system will be installed so that the receptionist at the 

administration office can handle and re-direct the incoming calls. An internal phone system 

will installed to provide communications from remote areas of the operations as well as areas 

within tunnels such as the ore reclaim tunnel. 

Remote cameras will be located in strategic locations to monitor the process and refinery 

areas. Flat screen monitors to observe the operations will be located in the control room as 

well as in the offices of key managers. 

An emergency automated call system will be installed to be able to call directly to the hospital, 

clinic, or police. 

18.4.2 Truck workshop 

A five bay truck maintenance work shop plus a lubrication bay will be available to service and 

maintain the mobile mine equipment. An equipment wash bay will be installed to clean the 

equipment before servicing the equipment. 

The truck maintenance shop will be designed to handle the mine mobile equipment and will be 

equipped with an overhead crane with two hoists. 

In addition to the work shop, a mobile mechanic's truck will be available to provide minor 

servicing and urgent repairs to the field equipment. 

A fuel truck will be available to provide fuel to the large mobile equipment in the field. 

Work shops will be incorporated in the design of the crushing and process plants to be able to 

service the equipment.

18.6 PROPOSED PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

The project schedule shows that the feasibility study development, engineering and design, 

construction, and start-up of the facilities will require about 22 months to complete, beginning 

with the development of the feasibility study. It is intended that the mine pre-production will 

commence in about April 2010. 

During the execution of the feasibility study, orders for long lead and key equipment and 

machinery will be placed and contracts for the water retention dams will be issued for bid. The 

water retention dams are required to be constructed early so that the run-off from the spring 

and summer rains can be captured and used for construction, commissioning, and start-up of 

the operations. Since the project is a brown field site, the schedule is achievable. 

The key activities to be completed are the following: 

• Acquire the Preliminary License (Licensa Previa - LP) by end of October – early 
November 2009. 

• Acquire the Installation License (LI) by February 2010. 
• Perform a resource update based on the results of the new drilling campaign by 

December 2009. 

• Complete the feasibility study by end of January 2010. 
• Construct the water retention dams by November/December 2009. 
• Begin detail engineering in Nov 2009. 
• Issue request for proposals for equipment purchases and earth moving contracts in 

November 2009. 

• Acquire key senior people beginning in October 2009. 
The acquisition of the LP and LI is well advanced and should be obtained within the proposed 

schedule. 

Some of the detail engineering work such as geotechnical, mine planning, flow sheet 

finalization, facility layouts, tailing and water retention dams will be conducted in parallel with 

the completion of the feasibility study so that the overall project schedule for early completion 

can be achieved. 

The site earthworks and the development of the open pit will begin in parallel with the 

execution of the detail engineering as soon as sufficient detail design and engineering are 

completed to begin the tasks.  

The development of the project including design and engineering, project management, and 

schedule and cost control will be performed by an integrated team comprising people from 

Carpathian, design and engineering firms, construction companies.

18.7 MARKETS 

18.7.1 Industry Trends and Prices 

As advised by Carpathian, the gold price to be used for the base case cash flow analysis is 

$850/oz for the life of the project, which approximately corresponds to the average prices of 

2007, 2008 and 2009. 

High Low Average 

2006 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $725 $525 $604 

2007 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $841 $608 $695 

2008 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1023 $693 $872 

2009 (through August 31, 2009) . . . . . . . . . . $964 $932 $949 

To determine the adequacy of the gold prices used for cash flow analysis, a review was 

completed of prices used in recent resource calculations by major gold producers. 

Based on recent information from the world gold institutions, the prediction for the price of 

gold for the next few years is to stabilize between $US925 – US$1,000 per ounce with spikes as 

high as $US1,200 per ounce because of the global financial problems and the possibility of high 

inflation rates caused by huge amounts of capital injection by central banks. 

18.7.2 Sale Strategy 

RDM Gold Project will produce gold bars containing some 90-95% gold. These bars will be sold 

to banks or other financial institutions in Brazil and off-shore on spot price basis to capture the 

highest value possible for the gold. 

18.8 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

18.8.1 Multigeo Preliminary Environmental Appraisal 

On January 16, 2008, the Brazilian company Multigeo carried out a preliminary appraisal of 

the environmental aspects of the RDM Gold Project that included: 

• Searching for useful information on FEAM and DNPM net sites, in the literature, as well as 
the office of Santa Elina. 

• Mine site visit for visual evaluation of its current conditions specially focussed on 
rehabilitation works performed. 

• Searching and examining all documents that are part of the administrative dossier at 
FEAM to know the environmental process history. 

• Critically analyzing all the information gathered and preparing a report, highlighting the 
liabilities and non-compliance, if any were found. 

• Including in the report, a brief summary and comment on a move-forward permitting 
strategy for the RDM Gold Project, under the assumption that Carpathian would like to 

beign the minesite development as soon as possible. A general timeline for the permitting 

process will be presented.

The following pages are extracted from the MULTIGEO report. The full Multigeo document is 

part of the Appendices. 

"CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION 

RDM Gold Mine, situated in the municipality of Riacho dos Machados, north of Minas Gerais 

State, was operated by VALE (Companhia Vale do Rio Doce) from 1989 to 1997. After mining 

about 3.21 Mt of oxidized ore, producing 4,825 kg of gold, VALE closed the mine and performed 

several rehabilitation measures.  

The rehabilitation program was submitted to the State Environmental Agency (FEAM), which 

kept its implementation under surveillance.  

Rehabilitation measures carried out included:  

• Reshaping of remaining mining landfarms;  

• Drainage system installation;  

• Revegetation;  

• Maintenance program;  

• Water monitaring program;  

• Acid mine drainage generation reduction;  

• Arsenic removal from contaminated water.  

Concerning the four first groups of measures listed above, the rehabilitation program was 

successful, reaching the objectives of integrating the site to the surrounding landscape, 

ensuring geotechnical stability of the slopes, controlling the erosion processes. The area is fully 

tree-covered with Brazilian and exotic species. The maintenance program, focused mainly on 

the drainage structures, erosion prevention and vegetation, as well as the monitoring program 

are being kept". 

The remedial work that was performed by Vale to stop the ARD caused by the sulphidic ore in 

the heap leach piles, as per the report of Multigeo, was effective since there was no ARD after 

the treatment was complete. This can be seen below on the following pages that show the 

analyses of the water samples taken in 2008 and 2009. The results show that the quality of the 

water is within the standards as set by the ministry of the environment CONAMA (Conselho 

Nacional do Meio Ambiente). Samples of the various rock types of the orebody and waste 

were extracted so that acid – base accounting tests could be performed to determine the 

neutralization potential of rocks of the orebody. Of the eight samples extracted from the drill 

core within the pit limits, seven showed acid neutralization potentials of 18 to 61 tonnes CaCO3 

equivalent, with one sample showing an ARD potential to generate 20.54 kg H2SO4 per tonne 

of material. Based on these results, a blending program of the waste rock to utilize the 

neutralization capacity of the waste rock to counter the rock that shows ARD potential will be 

developed by RDM and an ARD expert to eliminate the ARD problem. Vale did not utilize a 

blending program to avoid the ARD generation during the operation of the heap leach and 

waste rock storage.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

The RDM Gold Project is located within a semi-arid area and has two seasons: the rain season 

from November to March and the dry season from April to October. During the dry season, 

there is no precipitation so that some of the sampling points are dry or contain very little 

amount of water. 

During the execution of the feasibility study, static and dynamic acid ARD tests will need to be 

conducted for the rock types of the ore and waste to confirm the acid-base accounting 

analyses. The sulphidic ore that caused the ARD in the Vale heaps is the ore that will be 

processed in the CIL plant to recover the gold. The tailing from the CIL plant will be treated in a 

cyanide destruction circuit prior to discharge to the tailing impoundment area so that the pH 

of tailing product will be in the range of 9.0 to 10.5. The high pH of the final tailing will negate 

the generation of ARD in the tailing impoundment area.  

It is important to note that the mine exploration shaft and associated underground galleries 

located in the mineral zone will be mined as part of the open pit operations 

All drainage from the open pit and future underground workings plus the drainage from the 

waste rock stockpiles as well as the drainage from the site of the facilities will need to be 

transported to the tailing impoundment area by pumping and gravity. 

18.8.2 Principal Environmental Baseline Findings 

Environmental and socio-economic studies has been carried out to compose the 

Environmental Impact Assessment of the RDM Gold Project. Such studies included preliminary 

assessment of water availability and climate regime, geological, geomorphological and soil 

characteristics, noise assessment, flora and fauna studies and evaluation of socio-economic 

aspects related to the project. 

Government statistics show that the region of Riacho dos Machados as an impoverished region 

with very little opportunity for work. The area is mainly supported by subsistence cattle 

ranching and plantations of eucalyptus trees for use in the steel industry as charcoal. 

The population of the town of Riacho dos Machados is about 9,719 inhabitants, according to 

DATASUS projection for the year of 2009. Most of the people (about 90%) live in the town, but 

some live on farms. The population density is only 7.12 habitants/km
2
. 

According to the City Hall, 110 professionals work for municipal services of education and 80 

professionals work for the state schools. There is no information about the other occupations. 

Services in the town of Riacho dos Machados are very limited. Schools are available, but there 

is no hospital. Two doctors, hired by Riacho dos Machados come to the village twice a week to 

provide basic medical care. 

Water usage and availability was also identified as a key environmental aspect of the project, 

since the region is located in a semi-arid region. Then, water supply will need to be done 

involving different sources: groundwater wells, surface water, mine dewatering and tailing 

water reuse.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

RDM Gold Project is located at a transition zone between the typical Brazilian savannah called 

"Cerrado" and the semi-arid biome named "Caatinga". Natural environment´s characteristics 

are closer to Cerrado biome, including sparse areas of bedrock known as "Campos Rupestres" 

and some relevant areas of a deciduous forest ("Mata Seca"), which is protected by law. 

Cerrado formations are very disturbed, mostly due to burning practices frequently associated 

to charcoal production (see comments on socio-economic aspects). Alternative locational 

studies resulted in the protection of the most relevant formation found in the baseline studies 

– the Mata Seca forest. 

In total, 107 tree species were sampled, 2 of them listed as threatened species by IBAMA, 2 are 

considered threatened by Minas Gerais State and 4 species found at Mata Seca are considered 

"very rare" at the state of Minas Gerais by Oliveira-Filho (2006). 

Fauna studies registered 106 species of birds (28 endemic), 77 species (10 endemic) of anurans 

and lizards (herpetofauna), 21 of mammals (8 threatened) and 185 species of fish (18 

threatened). 

Locational alternatives study allowed to preserve most relevant areas for conservation of 

biodiversity occurring in the context of the site, avoiding direct impacts from the mine project. 

Monitoring and restoration programmes will focus on measures to enhance wildlife quality on 

preserved areas, including "Reserva Legal", a portion of land that must be kept intact in rural 

areas according to brazilian legislation. 

18.8.3 Summary of Main Environmental and Social Issues for the Project 

As supported by the baseline studies, main environmental and social issues are the following: 

- Water availability and usage: the region has low water availability, and its uptake and 

use is a key matter of concern. RDM Gold Project will demand considerable volumes of 

water, and the project will be required to build a water reservoir. As a result, the 

Piranga stream will become perennial, and farmers from the surroundings areas will 

also benefit from this structure. 

- In terms of ecological impacts, the RDM Gold Project has typical mining impacts. Since 

the area has a background of disturbance, impacts are acceptable and attention must 

be paid for the remnant areas to be preserved, where important flora and fauna 

elements must be monitored and conservation efforts must be carried out. 

- Social concerns include dust and noise disturbance and potential social conflicts due to 

new people (migrators) coming to the town of Riacho dos Machados. Common 

protection measures as noise abatement systems and road watering to avoid dust 

suspension must be adopted to avoid / minimise these impacts. The social programs to 

be carried out as part of the RDM Gold Project will enable the mitigation of 

undesirable social conflicts.

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

- Local economic growth will be very significant and the project will play a key role at 

local economy, likely becoming the larger employer and user of local and regional 

services, thus responsible for a considerable part of the local economy. 

18.8.4 Socio-economic Potential Impacts 

The RDM Gold Project requires additional land acquisition for the complete set of structures 

previewed. As a result, around 12 families will need to be relocated to other areas and NCL 

understands that MRDM is currently in the process of making arrangements to acquire this 

ground. 

In the pit area there is a cemetery that also will demand attention and relocation efforts. 

Other socio-economic negative potential impacts concerned by population are noise and dust 

emissions from the site, and possible disturbs caused by migrators (people) who possibly will 

come to live in the city. 

The perspectives of new jobs will attract migrators to the area, however, the prospect of new 

jobs and the improvement on the local economy are welcomed by most of the residents of the 

town of Riacho dos Machados. Direct and indirect jobs and all demands created by RDM Gold 

Project will result into a very positive impact for the ecomony of the town, actually strongly 

dependent of local, state and federal social projects and public jobs. 

The RDM Gold Project will hire the majority of the operational people from the region, mainly 

as unskilled workers and will complete its workforce with skilled, experienced workers from 

other regions. Transportation service to the operation will be provided for the people from 

Riacho dos Machados and Porteirinha.  

Some improvements to the town of Riacho dos Machados and the nearby communities will be 

made possible through the development of the RDM Gold Project. The project is committed to 

provide assistance to the community. This assistance will include programs such as: 

environmental, hygiene and health education, sustainable businesses, improvements to the 

municipal medical system and promotion of mine visits for students from Riacho dos 

Machados and Porteirinha, and the region. 

18.8.5 Closure and Abandonment Stage 

The RDM facilities will require closure and abandonment measures upon completion of mining 

and processing, which will be based on the following conceptual plan: 

- Facilitating the return of the land use to grazing and wildlife habitat. 

- Minimizing the potential for long term environmental liability. 

- Complying with Brazilian federal and state norms. 

The detailed closure plan will be prepared during the feasibility study stage. The objective of 

the plan will be to return the land to its pre- mining use while protecting the environment, 

reducing long-term monitoring, maintenance, and potential liabilities. It is expected that the 

water retention pond will remain as is to be able to provide water to the region.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

The overburden salvage program will focus on the collection and storage of suitable topsoil for 

rehabilitation material to be used at the end of the operating life. To control the erosion and to 

maintain the nutrient levels for later reclamation activities, the topsoil storage piles will be 

fertilized and re-vegetated using legumes, grasses and native plant species. 

An annual amount of R$ 1,000,000, equivalent to US$51,282, plus an amount of US$ 3.0 

million for final closure and abandonment are included in the cost estimates for the project. 

The following points summarize the reclamation goals included in the EIA: 

- Open Pit Mine 

At the end of the operation, some of the pit area will be transformed into a lake, since the 

underground water infiltration and surface water run-off will partially fill the pit. The parts of 

slopes and benches which are not submerged under the lake will be prepared and covered 

with topsoil and re-vegetated with a mixture of local grasses and legumes. Berms and fencing 

will be constructed around the outside perimeter of high pit walls. 

- Waste Rock Dumps 

Waste dumps have been designed to contain a total of about 150 million tonnes of waste rock. 

Upon completion of the waste disposal, the slopes and berms will be prepared, graded, and 

covered with topsoil and a mixture of local grasses, shrubs, trees, and legumes will be seeded. 

Diversions and sediment control facilities will be designed and constructed in areas susceptible 

to erosion and sediment loading. Acid generating waste rock is not expected to occur because 

of the natural blend of the waste rock. Settling ponds will be constructed to allow 

sedimentation of solids from the drainage of waste pile storage areas. These areas will be 

graded, covered with topsoil and re- vegetated with indigenous plant species. 

- Mill and Ancillary Facilities 

The mill, truck shop, laboratory and other facilities will be dismantled, with salvageable 

equipment sold and inert construction waste buried in the tailings impoundment. All 

foundations will be buried in-place and the building sites will be graded and re-vegetated with 

fruit and indigenous seedlings. Topsoil will be applied in areas where it is necessary to ensure 

successful re-vegetation. 

- Tailing and Water Retention Ponds 

About 80% of the tailing impoundment and dam surfaces will be re-vegetated and the other 20 

percent will be transformed into a lake. The surface will be graded and prepared by 

distribution of limestone, litter and organic fertilizer. In Brazil, litter is called "Serapilheira", 

meaning an organic material (humus) that is found on the ground of forests. It is composed of 

a mix of leaves, fruits, seeds and branches. 

- Servitude Area and Margin of Creeks 

As required by the State Forest Law, during operation a part of the servitude area at the 

project site will be re-vegetated using native species.

- Natural Habitat And Forest Conservation 

Carpathian has followed a precautionary approach to natural resource management to ensure 

opportunities for environmentally sustainable development by maintaining protected areas as 

per the Brazilian norms. 

Educational activities for the initiative on environmental knowledge and natural habitat 

conservation will be sponsored by Carpathian/MRDM for pre-school up to first grade children, 

in accordance with acquired commitments to the community. 

- Legal Forest Reserves 

The project will acquire sufficient ground of a suitable quality to be able to re-locate the legal 

forest reserve at the open pit area to another area that will not be impacted by the operation.

18.9.3 Plant and Infrastructure Capital Cost 

Plant and infrastructure capital costs were provided to NCL by Tecnomin and Carpathian, 

based on their experience no similar projects, applying a number of factors to the quantities 

obtained from preliminary layouts developed for this study. 

Processing Plant 

Tecnomin prepared a detailed mechanical equipment list for the processing plant. The 

equipment costs were obtained from vendor's quotes for major equipments, such as crushers, 

feeders, mills, screens, agitators, pumps, air compressor, tanks, and thickeners, etc. For other 

minor items Tecnomin used values from similar recent projects. 

For the Aicd Wash Dessorption / Carbon Reactivation / Refinery the capital costs were 

obtained from Summit Valley. 

The total mechanical equipment capital cost amounts to US$ 24.6 million. 

According to Tecnomin experience, the mechanical equipment capital cost represents 35% of 

the total capital cost of the plant. Tecnomin assigned different weights to other items involved 

in the processing plant construction. The capital cost for this other items was estimated by 

applying the assigned weight and equipment list capital cost, as detailed in Table 18.9-3. 

Additional details on Tecnomin estimate are provided as an Appendix (Section 24.4) 

It was estimated by Carpathian and Tecnomin that the total capital cost of the plant will be 

distributed as 80% of the total during the preproduction, or construction period, and the 

remaining 20% during Year 1 of commercial production.

US$51,282, plus an amount of US$ 3.0 million for final closure and abandonment are included 

in the cost estimates for the project. 

18.9.6 Contingency Provisions  

Contingency provisions were estimated by Tecnomin as 15% of the plant capital cost, as 

detailed in Table 18.9-3. 

18.9.7 Federal Incentive on Reinvestment 

The Re-Investment fund is a fund that can be utilized to purchase new equipment, increase 

capacity, environmental reclamation, etc. The government contribution to the fund is the 30% 

of the federal income tax. The Company will contribute to the fund so that when new 

equipment is purchased, etc, money is withdrawn from the fund such that 50% of the value of 

the purchase or contract is taken from the federal portion of the Re-Investment Fund and 50% 

of the value is taken from MRDM's portion of the fund so that MRDM pays only 50% of the 

value of purchase or contract. 

The incentive considered to the project amounts to US$ 7.8 million, corresponding to 50% of 

the total estimated sustaining capital, including closure costs. 

The tax and government incentives for the project development were provide by Carpathian 

and have not been validated by NCL. The negotiations have not been finalized with the 

government and its agencies so that these values may change and any changes will be noted 

and included in the feasibility study.

18.10.2 Processing Operating Cost Criteria 

The following criteria was applied by Tecnomin for the processing operating cost estimate: 

• The manpower estimate was according to organization chart, previously detailed in 
Section 18.5 (Figure 18.5-3). The applied salaries were according to similar operations in 

Brazil. 

• Power consumption was calculated in kWh per year, using the estimated unit consumption 
for each drive and efficiency factors, and the estimated operating hours per year. A power 

cost of US$0.075/kWhr was used, based on costs of other similar projects. 

• The consumables and reagents for the plant are typical for a gold processing plant and the 
consumption rates were based on test work plus other gold operations.  Annual 

consumption rates were calculated by multiplying the consumption rates by the total 

annual tonnage processed as per the mass balance.  Unit prices for reagents and other 

consumables were obtained from suppliers plus other gold operations.  

• The maintenance costs are based on other similar projects. Maintenance includes 
mechanical, electrical and instrumentation spares maintenance and any specialised 

contract labour. The electromechanical manpower was included in the general manpower 

for the plant. 

• The estimated processing cost amounts to US$ 8.05 per ore tonne feed to the plant, 
according to Table 18.10-2 below.

Carpathian provided an expense of R$ 400,000 per month (Brazilian reais), based on current 

gold operation in Brazil. This amount corresponds to US$ 2.46 million per year, or US$ 1.12 per 

ore tonne feed to the plant. 

18.11 ECONOMIC EVALUATION 

18.11.1 Taxes and Royalties 

The project was evaluated on the assumption that the available tax incentives will be granted 

to the project. These incentives are applicable because the project is situated in a Brazilian 

region considered as of priority interest due to its contribution to regional development. 

Taxation criteria were applied as follows: 

Income Tax Incentive: The regular income tax rate corresponds to 25% of the taxable profit. A 

project considered to be of priority interest is entitled to a reduction of 75% in the effective 

Income Tax rate. A constant rate of 6.25% was used for the whole period. 

CSLL – "Contribuição Social sobre o Lucro Líquido": A constant rate of 9% of taxable profit was 

applied. 

Finally, constant total tax rate of 15.25% was applied, including Federal incentives because of 

the region where the project is located. 

Certain royalties are levied on mineral production in Brazil in accordance with Federal law. The 

current statutory royalty imposed by the federal government on gold properties is 1% of 

revenues proceeds less sales tax, transportation and insurance costs. This royalty is named in 

Brazil as CFEM – "Compensação Financeira pela Exploração de Recursos Minerais". 

Carpathian informs NCL that the RDM Gold Project additionally carries a 1% royalty on gold 

and payable by MRDM to Mineração Brilhante Ltda. (previous owners). 

The tax and government incentives for the project development were provide by Carpathian 

and have not been validated by NCL. The negotiations have not been finalized with the 

government and its agencies so that these values may change and any changes will be noted 

and included in the feasibility study.

18.11.2 Base Case 

A simple cash flow financial model was created by NCL, based on its experience, utilizing the 

mine production schedule, associated gold grades, gold recoveries estimated from the 

preliminary metallurgical test program, and capital and operating costs as set out above. 

Base case gold price was a constant US$850 per ounce for all the life of mine, provided by 

Carpathian. 

The study entails a 6,000 tonnes per day to an industry standard carbon in leach and ADR, 

producing a total of 726 thousand ounces of gold over the mine life of 7.11 years. 

A constant tax rate of 15.25% was applied, including Federal incentives because of the region 

where the project is located, and royalties of 2% of revenue. 

The tax and government incentives for the project development were provide by Carpathian 

and have not been validated by NCL. The negotiations have not been finalized with the 

government and its agencies so that these values may change and any changes will be noted 

and included in the feasibility study. 

NCL has considered the cash flow on a 100% equity basis, i.e. no account has been taken of 

financing arrangements and associated costs. 

Economical parameters used for the evaluation are shown in Table 18.11-1.

18.11.3 Sensitivity Analysis 

The project's sensitivity to changes in revenue, operating costs, discount rate and tax rate was 

tested with the following observations (Table 18.11-4 through Table 18.11-6): 

• When the gold price was increased to a constant US$ 950 per ounce, NPV after tax at a 
5% discount rate rises by US$ 47.3 million to US$ 147 million and the IRR rises from 

27% to 37%. 

• The project NPV only became negative for the combination of 50% increase on total 
operating cost and gold prices lower than US$ 800 per ounce. Same result if it is before 

or after tax. 

•  A 31% increase in the tax rate, from the Base Case 15.25%, decreases the NPV in a 6%, 
from US$ 99.7 million to US$ 93.4 million, and the IRR decreases from 27.1% to 25.8%.

18.12 ONGOING DRILL PROGRAM 

At the date of this report, Carpathian is running a phase II drilling program focused in the 

conversion of the inferred resources obtained in the present study into indicated and 

measured classification. This campaign is an in-fill drilling to improve the data density to open 

mining depths and to test its extensions along strike. These holes are planned to range in 

depth between 50 to 300 metres. A total of 15,000 to 22,000 m of drilling is planned for this 

purpose. Initial results of this drilling program are not yet available.

20. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

20.1 GEOLOGY AND RESOURCES 

The gold mineralization at the RDM Gold Project is shear-zone hosted in a metamorphic 

sequence of Archean to early Proterozoic in age. At the RDM mine site the shear-zone strikes 

20° and dips 35° to 45° to the east. Geologic features at RDM have many similarities with 

Orogenic, or 'lode gold' type deposits associated with first or second order regional scale 

structures in collision orogens. 

In 2008 Carpathian drilled 64 holes totalling 11,277 m and re-sampled the core of 100 drill 

holes performed previously by Vale, for zones identified as mineralized. Carpathian's objective 

is to evaluate the sulphide gold mineralization below the shallow open pits and along strike. 

The results of a total of 166 diamond drill holes were utilized to prepare the July 2009 

Resource Estimate for the RDM deposit. This resource estimate was completed in 

conformance with NI 43-101 reporting guidelines. This resource estimate incorporates 

Carpathian's 2008 drilling results  and re-sampling of CVRD drill-core  that were available as of 

March 1
st

, 2009. 

As of May 18
th

, 2009, the effective date of the resource estimate, resources amenable for open 

pit mining are estimated as 4.54 million tonnes in the measured plus indicated categories 

grading at 1.84 g Au/t and 15.16 million tonnes grading 1.56 g Au/t in the inferred category. 

The underground resource amounts to 0.20 million tonnes indicated resource grading 3.31 g 

Au/t and 2.73 million tonnes inferred resource grading 2.84 g Au/t. The open pit resources 

include 762,700 ounces of gold in the inferred category and 268,800 ounces gold in the 

measured plus indicated categories. Combined open pit and underground resources include 

1,012,400 ounces gold in the inferred category and 290,200 ounces in the measured plus 

indicated categories. 

20.2 MINING 

Mining studies have been completed using the resource estimate as of May 18
th

,2009, 

including: 

• Pit optimization using Whittle 4X to determine the ultimate pit limits and identify a 
sequence of intermediate mining phases. 

• Five mining phases have been proposed, together with a detailed final pit design  to 
allow for access ramps and working areas required for the selected mining equipment. 

Bench and overall pit slope design was based on recommendations by the 

geotechnical consultants (Golder Associates). 

• Two waste storage areas were designed according to geotechnical recommendations. 

• Pit contained resources inventory amounts to 15.2 million tonnes of ore at a mill feed 
head grade of 1.65 g Au/t and 159.5 million tonnes of total material. Inferred mineral

resources have been included that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 

categorised as mineral reserves. No Mineral Reserves have been estimated. 

• Development of the mine production schedule and plant feed schedule, based on the 
pit contained resources inventory, for a processing rate of 6,000 tonnes per day and a 

life of mine of 7.11 years, for an average annual production rate of 102,012 ounces of 

gold. 

• Identification of suitable mining equipment types and calculation of mining fleet 
requirements. The operation is based on 6.7 cubic metre backhoe excavators, matched 

to 40 tonnes conventional haul trucks. 

• Total material movements, loading cycles and haul profiles were taken into account in 
defining equipment numbers. 

• Estimation of mine capital and operating costs. Capital costs consider owner-operator 
mining, and include provision for preproduction mining. Replacement and additional 

equipment purchase costs have been included over the life of mine. 

• The operating cost estimate is dominated by equipment operating costs (fuel, tires, 
labour, and maintenance). Blasting, administration/management and services were 

also included. It was assumed owner maintenance for the mining fleet. 

In addition to the open pit scoping study, underground mineral resources were identified with 

an attractive economical potential. A preliminary desktop analysis was carried out for this 

underground potential, estimating a total of 4.0 million tonnes at 2.57 g Au/t and 332 

thousand ounces contained, down to elevation 420 (approximately 250 m below the open pit), 

as underground mineable resources. 

The mining method proposed for the underground is sublevel open stoping. Stopes will be 

100% backfilled and no rib or sill pillars will be left except where geological structures dictate 

otherwise. A mining rate of 2,000 tonnes per day, equivalent to 730,000 tonnes per year, was 

selected. For the current recognised extension of the orebody and the selected production 

rate, the underground project can have a life of mine of 5.5 years. 

20.3 METALLURGICAL INFORMATION AND PROCESS DESIGN 

Carpathian envisions an industry-standard, crushing, grinding (single-stage ball mill), CIL 

(carbon in leach) circuit with and ADR (adsorption, desorption, and recovery) process plant to 

extract and recover gold from the sulphide and oxide mineralization at the RDM Gold Project. 

To evaluate this process, three composite drill core samples were submitted to the SGS-Geosol 

Metallurgical laboratory in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, for grinding and cyanide leaching test work. 

Results from this test work were presented to Carpathian in a report dated January 15, 2009 

entitled "Leaching Kinetics of Three RDM Samples". 

The conclusions that can be reached based on the test work are the following:

1. The grinding tests show that the P80 particle size of 75 microns for the mineral 

samples can be achieved with a standard grinding circuit. 

2. The test work shows consistent results with gold extractions between 88.4% to 92.3% 

for leach tests without carbon and 88.6% to 91.9% for leach tests with carbon. 

3. The maximum gold extraction was achieved after 24 hours of leaching when the ore 

was ground to a particle size of P80=75 microns. 

4. The cyanide consumption at 1,800 ppm was consistent for the all the leach tests. 

Additional test work is being performed, as of the date of this report, to confirm the results of 

the 2008 test work plus optimization tests. 

20.4 GEOTECHNICAL STUDIES 

The existing five continuous pits areas at RDM Gold Project, along a total extension of 1350 

metres, with 110 metres of width and a maximum depth of 80 metres, aligned in the direction 

N20ºE, with individual slopes projected to have 10 m of height, with an angle of 45º for the 

face slope in the footwall. 

A preliminary study was prepared according to the following stages:  

• Analysis of historical data. 
• On site inspection. 
• Definition of the geomechanical model and the failure mechanisms. 
• Determination of the strength parameters on the basis of secondary data. 
• Stability analyses. 
• Preliminary definition of the global slope angles and bench design. 

20.5 HYDROGEOLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL INFORMATION 

The hydrological studies that were performed for the study showed that sufficient water can 

be captured during the rain season and stored behind a water retention dam to satisfy the 

fresh water needs of the project.  The water flow in the streams of the region are unreliable 

and intermittent with high water flows in the rain summer season and dry stream beds in the 

winter season. 

To augment the supply of the fresh water, wells will be installed for the project to provide a 

supply for potable water and as an additional source of make-up water for the process plant, if 

required.  The study shows that the predominant aquifer systems of the installed wells of the 

region are located in the Gneiss-Granitic and the Schistous Systems (48 wells), representing 

41.7% of the wells. The Pellitic System is represented by 23 wells drilled in limestone, and 

when predominant the karstic-fractured aquifer type represents around 20% of the 

occurrences. Detritic System represents 4.3% of the drilled wells (5 unities), generally installed

in the weathered layer, having small depths. The 34% remaining wells have no information 

about the installed lithology. 

The observed productivity in wells installed in fractured aquifers (gneiss rocks) shows a mean 

value of 3.5 m

In the schists, the observed mean flow value is 6.8 m3/h, with a maximum of 23.8 m
3
/h. 

20.6 POWER SUPPLY 

The electrical power will be supplied to the project via a 34.5kV line beginning at Janauba, 

some 35 km of right of way. The upgraded power line will follow the same route as the existing 

13.8kV power line that currently supplies electrical power to the project site. 

The power distribution will be provided in three voltages: 34.5 kV, 6.6kV, and 460 volt for 

equipment with motors less than 225 kW. 

The electrical demand for the operations is estimated at 9.5 MW. 

Substations will be installed at Janauba and the project site. The power consumption will be 

measured at the Janauba substation. 

20.7 WATER SUPPLY 

The majority of the water for the operations will be obtained from the recycle of the tailing 

supernatant at a rate of 148.5 m
3
 per hour. The fresh water will obtained from water storage 

ponds at a rate of about 200 m
3
 per hour of which 88.5 m

3
 per hour will be make-up water for 

the process and 40 m
3
 per hour for the ADR plant, 37 m

3
 per hour for dust control at the 

crushing plant, and 20 m
3
 per hour for potable water. Water for dust control of the roads will 

be obtained from the fresh water supply system. A detailed water balance will be prepared for 

the feasibility study. 

20.8 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES 

As supported by the baseline studies, the main environmental and social issues are the 

following: 

- Water availability and usage: the region has low water availability, and its uptake and 

use is a key matter of concern. RDM Gold Project will demand considerable volumes of 

water, and the project will be required to build a water reservoir. As a result, the 

Piranga stream will become perennial, and farmers from the surroundings areas will 

also benefit from this structure. 

- In terms of ecological impacts, the RDM Gold Project has typical mining impacts. Since 

the area has a background of disturbance, impacts are acceptable and attention must 

be paid for the remnant areas to be preserved, where important flora and fauna 

elements must be monitored and conservation efforts must be carried out. 



 195

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

- Social concerns include dust and noise disturbance and potential social conflicts due to 

new people (migrators) coming to the town of Riacho dos Machados. Common 

protection measures as noise abatement systems and road watering to avoid dust 

suspension must be adopted to avoid / minimise these impacts. The social programs to 

be carried out as part of the RDM Gold Project will enable the mitigation of 

undesirable social conflicts. 

- Local economic growth will be very significant and the project will play a key role at 

local economy, likely becoming the larger employer and user of local and regional 

services, thus responsible for a considerable part of the local economy. 

20.9 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

The project schedule shows that the feasibility study development, engineering and design, 

construction, and start-up of the facilities will require about 22 months to complete, beginning 

with the development of the feasibility study. It is intended that the mine pre-production will 

commence in about April 2010. 

The key activities to be completed are the following: 

• Acquire the Preliminary License (Licensa Previa - LP) by end of October – early 
November 2009. 

• Acquire the Installation License (LI) by February 2010. 
• Perform a resource update based on the results of the new drilling campaign by 

December 2009. 

• Complete the feasibility study by end of January 2010. 
• Construct the water retention dams by November/December 2009. 
• Begin detail engineering in Nov 2009. 
• Issue request for proposals for equipment purchases and earth moving contracts in 

November 2009. 

• Acquire key senior people beginning in October 2009. 

20.10 PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT STUDY RESULTS 

The total estimated initial capital cost of the project is US$112.9 million which comprises 

US$ 79.7 million for plant, infrastructure and owner's cost. The capital allowance for the pre-

strip is an additional US$17.0 million and US$ 16.2 million for mine equipment. 

Adding sustaining capital, closure, salvage credit and Federal incentive for sustaining capital, 

the total capital cost for the life of the project amounts to US$ 108.1 million. 

Mine operating costs were estimated as an average of US$ 1.165 per total material mined. 

Processing operating cost was estimated as US$ 8.05 per ore tonne feed to the plant. 

The total estimated cost (not including capital re-payment or royalty) is US$ 428 per ounce 

(US$ 455 including royalty) and including capital re-payment is US$ 604 per ounce.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

A simple cash flow financial model was created by NCL, based on its experience, utilizing the 

mine production schedule, associated gold grades, gold recoveries estimated from the 

preliminary metallurgical test program, and capital and operating costs. 

Base Case net present value (NPV) at a 5% discount rate, after-tax NPV is US$ 99.7 million, 

generating an IRR of 27.1% after-tax. For a US$ 900 per ounce gold price, NPV after-tax is 

$123.3 million and 32% IRR. 

As outlined above in Section 18.1.8,   adding an underground mining component to the project 

can add further economic value to the project and mine life extesnion even with the worst 

estimated operating cost scenario. NCL recommends to improve the confidence of the 

underground mineral resource by completing a detailed drilling program to outline this 

resource and upgrade the resource category and confidence level. 

Following the resource drilling, it is recommended that the potential underground scenario be 

evaluated during the feasibility study or post feasibility study to determine the best timing to 

bring this resource into operation during the open pit mining time frame and whether or not it 

is suitable to expand the plant an additional 2,000 tpd to accommodate this extra production 

or to maintain the plant production rate at 6,000 tpd and feed a higher grade material to the 

process plant.

21. RECOMMENDATIONS 

Based on the positive results of the PEA, NCL recommends the following:  

• Perform additional drilling to upgrade the mineral resources within the open pit to 
reserves. 

• Prepare a feasibility study. 
• Optimize the open pit mining and production plan during the development of the 

feasibility study. 

• Evaluate that portion of the underground resource that may be upgraded to an 
underground reserve with drilling as well as optimization plans to incorporate that 

mineralization into the overall project during the open pit operation. 

• Perform additional drilling to test high priority targets near the mine, including the south 
and north extensions of the mineral zone. 

• Complete the geotechnical and hydrological studies, including boreholes, for the open pit, 
water retention dams, process plant area, and water wells.  

• Perform dynamic and static acid rock drainage tests so that the results can be incorporated 
in the feasibility study. 

• Obtain the LP so that site works can begin. The water retention dams are important 
structures to construct for the capture and retention of water during the wet season of 

November to March.  

• Perform additional metallurgical test work to confirm the 2008 test results. Power 
consumption and cyclone densities should br checked during the feasibility study. Finer 

grinds should be investigated to confirm extra 2-3% gold recovery that is suggested from 

existing data. 

• Prepare and submit the documentation for clearing and grubbing for the high priority 
areas: open pit mine, water retention dams.  

• Commence the acquisition of the key and long lead equipment and machinery. 
• Commence early acquisition of contractors to begin development of the water retention 

dams and impoundment areas. 

• Complete the acquisition of additional surface rights over the project area and convert 
that small portion of the open pit that currently lies within an exploration license adjacent 

to the current mining concession. 

• Complete the negotiations with the governments to maximise the incentives for the 
project development.  

The following activities necessary to complete a feasibility study need be carried out: infill 

resource definition drilling, geotechnical and metallurgical studies, and EIA-SIA work, and the 

acquisition of the LP and LI permits for the project.

24. APPENDICES 

24.1 LEGAL ISSUES 

Mining Regulation in Brazil 
 
The following summarizes the Brazilian Mining Regulatory Environment as provided 
by Veirano Advogados, Attorneys at Law, Brazil: 

 
Pursuant to the Constitution, the Federal Government owns all mineral resources existing either in the soil or 
subsoil of Brazil. Accordingly, any exploration or exploitation of mineral resources, except for mineral 
substances used exclusively in construction (e.g. sand or gravel), substances subject to governmental 
monopoly (e.g. nuclear minerals) and substances extracted from mines patented prior to July 16, 1934, require 
a grant of concession by the Federal Government.  

These concessions consist essentially of prospecting or mine digging permits (permissões de lavra 
garimpeira), exploration licenses (autorizações de pesquisa or Alvarás) and mining concessions (concessões 
or portarias de lavra) and are granted by the Ministry of Mines and Energy ("MME") through its National 
Department of Mineral Production ("DNPM").  

The DNPM has general discretion to reject any application failing to meet the relevant geographical, 
geological, technical or procedural criteria, and an application may be refused should it be determined that the 
exploration or mining activities involved are harmful to the public or to interests that outweigh the usefulness 
of exploration or exploitation of the deposit.  

Granting concessions and all other administrative acts of either the MME or the DNPM concerning 
concessions are published in the Official Gazette, which circulates throughout Brazil. Decisions by the 
DNPM affecting concessions may be challenged before the MME, and decisions by the MME are subject to 
review by the courts.  

Under current Brazilian law, companies in which foreigners hold a direct or indirect interest of 51% or more 
of the total capital stock may not perform mining or mining-related activities in areas situated within 150 km 
from Brazil's borders. 

Exploration Licenses  

Exploration licenses are granted by the DNPM and entail a preliminary stage, authorizing lab and field work 
to perform the necessary geological, geophysical, geochemical survey, excavation, outcropping, drilling and 
other exploration activities. These must be successfully completed for the holder to be granted a mining 
concession.  

Before exploration can start, an exploration license must be obtained. Brazilian mining law defines 
exploration as the work required to identify a mineral deposit, estimate its value and determine the economic 
feasibility of its exploitation. 

The application for an exploration license must be submitted to the DNPM containing information, among 
other things, on the substances to be explored, a scale map, and a description of the geographical features of 
the area and a working plan, including an exploration budget.  

Applicants must pay an application fee (currently around US$100.00) and are given a period of 60 days after 
filing to supply any additional information required.  

Valid applications protect the applicant's priority. Strictly speaking, applications are not transferable, although 
in practice they are often negotiated by mining industry players. 

Exploration licenses may be granted either to Brazilian individuals or mining companies (i.e., companies 
organized in Brazil, under Brazilian law, whose articles or by-laws authorize them to engage in mining 
activities, plus filing these documents with the DNPM), and may be transferred from their holder to another 
Brazilian individual or mining company.  

There is no limit on the number of exploration licenses or mining concessions that may be granted to or held 
by any given individual or mining company.

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Once the exploration license is granted, its holder must start exploration work within 60 days of the grant, 
unless justification for the delay is shown. Once work begins, it may not be interrupted for more than 3 
consecutive months or 120 non-consecutive days or stop without justification.  

Under Brazilian mining law, the holder of an exploration license has a right of way to secure his undisturbed 
access and peaceful use of the land specified in the license, for the purpose of carrying out the exploration 
work. However, the holder is liable to the surface landowner for payment for use of the land and for any 
damages resulting from the work (sees section 4.2.4).  

As a general rule, mineral substances extracted during exploration may be removed from the licensed areas 
only for analysis and tests, although in special circumstances, the mining and sale of commercial quantities of 
mineral substances may be authorized by the DNPM during exploration. 

The term of an exploration license varies from 1 to 3 years depending on the nature of the mineral substance. 
A license for exploration of metalliferous substances and diamonds, for example, will be granted for 3 years. 
As a rule, exploration licenses are extendable for 1 additional like or shorter period, with justification. The 
holder of an exploration license must pay an annual fee throughout its life. Currently, this fee is 
approximately US$0.36 per hectare per year of the original period and approximately US$0.55 per hectare per 
year of any extension. An exploration license gives the holder an exclusive right to search for the minerals 
specified, or other minerals eventually found in the area if specified in the license.  

The maximum area of an exploration license varies from 50 to 2,000 hectares depending on the nature of the 
mineral substance involved. The total area for the exploration of metalliferous substances and diamonds, for 
example, may not exceed 2,000 hectares. However, mining companies may be granted licenses covering 
areas of up to 10,000 hectares for exploration of metalliferous substances and diamonds, among others, if 
these areas are located within a region defined as the Statutory Amazon Region or of highly-difficult access. 

On conclusion of the exploration work, a detailed report must be submitted to the DNPM characterizing the 
ore or mineral substances and feasibility of exploitation as per specified standards. Submission of the final 
exploration report is required, irrespective of the results of exploration, except in cases of force majeure or if 
the holder of the exploration license files an abandonment notice with the DNPM prior to elapse of 1/3 of the 
original term of the license. Review of the report by the DNPM takes on average 6 months to one year and its 
approval provisionally entitles the holder of the license to apply for and be granted the corresponding mining 
concession. 

Mining Concessions 

Granting a mining concession requires the successful completion of a number of preliminary stages prior to 
granting the concession itself. These include obtaining an exploration license for the corresponding area and 
completion of its exploration with positive results. 

On approval of the final exploration report by the DNPM the holder of the license has 1 year to apply for the 
corresponding mining concession. This one-year term may be extended for 1 additional year, with 
justification.  

Application for granting a mining concession is made to the MME and must contain detailed geological and 
geophysical information on the license areas in question, including: 

(i) a description of the mineral deposits to be exploited; 

(ii) a description of the mining field's topographical location and indication of  neighboring concession areas; 

(iii) a map of the area to be mined, indicating its boundaries and properties affected by the proposed mining, 
with the names of the respective surface landholders; 

(iv)  reference to any easements that may be required; 

(v) a working plan for exploitation including a description of the mining method, scale of production and 
processing facilities; and 

(vi) proof of sources and availability of sufficient funds to work the mine. 

On receipt of an application for a mining concession, the DNPM reviews it, then forwarding it for final 
review by the MME, with its recommendation for grant or refusal. The procedures associated with reviewing 
an application for a mining concession, its grant and other ancillary steps, such as publication in the Official 
Gazette and registration with the DNPM, normally take up to 2 years. The prospective right to receive a 
mining concession (based on approval of the final exploration report by the DNPM) and the mining 
concession itself are transferable from their holder to a mining company.

CARPATHIAN GOLD INC NCL BRASIL LTDA. 

PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

After the concession is published in the Official Gazette, the mining company has 90 days to apply to the 
DNPM for investiture in effective possession of the corresponding mineral deposit, for which a fee, currently 
at approximately US$185.00, must be paid. Following this application, the mining company has 6 months to 
start the preparatory work contemplated in the mine working plan, counted from publication of the concession 
in the Official Gazette. Mining concessions for the same mineral substance granted to the same mining 
company may be consolidated into one sole mine, as long as the concessions address the same lode or are 
situated in the same mineral zone. 

Once mining has started, it may not be interrupted without authorization from the DNPM for longer than 6 
consecutive months; otherwise the concession may be revoked. The holder of a mining concession is required 
to file annual reports with the DNPM containing information on the working of the mine. A mining 
concession may be maintained in full force and remain effective until depletion of the mineral deposits 
existing within the concession area.  

No fees are due to the DNPM for the mining concession. All mineral substances extracted from the area of 
the mine as per the working plan are owned by the mining company and may be freely disposed of in regular 
trading. Under Brazilian mining law, the owner of the surface land where the mine is located is entitled to a 
statutory royalty equal to half the state royalty, the severance fee due on mineral substances extracted from the 
mine area, ranging from 0.2% to 3%. In practical terms, the landowner's statutory royalty is equivalent to a 
royalty on net sales revenue. This royalty may be reduced or even eliminated by contract. 

 

Transferability of Mining Rights 

Generally, exploration licenses and mining concessions may be totally or partially assigned to individuals or 
companies that meet the requirements laid down in law for the grant of such entitlements. Assignment of 
mining rights is subject to the DNPM's prior approval, which is usually granted as a matter of course. 
Mining concessions may be leased to third parties by their holder. Mining rights (exploration licenses or 
mining concessions) and mines may provide collateral for business deals.  

Reclamation and Closure 

A plan for the reclamation of mine sites and mine closure must be included in the project's environmental 
impact report, which must be submitted to the relevant environmental agency for approval. This plan 
must include: (i) identification and analysis of the environmental impacts of the mining activity 
performed; (ii) aspects related to the area's landscape and topographical formation; (iii) an environmental 
monitoring program; (iv) updated topographical maps; (v) a report on the area's potential use; (vi) maps, 
photographs and diagrams of the areas for reclamation; and (vii) technical and financial schedules for the 
reclamation and closure programs. 

 

Surface Rights 

Once, an Exploration Application has been converted to an Exploration License, then only the mineral 
rights would be obtained and not the surface rights. 

In accordance with the Brazilian Mining Code, exploration license holders shall be allowed to perform 
the related exploration work, as well as any required construction or service ancillary to such exploration 
work, on land in private or public domains included in the area covered, provided that the license holders 
pay rent to the landowners for the occupation of the land and compensation for any loss or damage 
caused. With respect to public land, the holder of the license is exempted from paying for its occupation. 
However, it must still pay compensation for damages to the property. 

The fair value for the rent and compensation must be determined either amicably or in court. The 
general principles of the Brazilian Mining Code provide that: 

• the rent should not exceed the maximum net income of the property to be used; 

• the compensation should not exceed fair market value of the part of the property to be occupied; 
• rent and compensation may be higher if the exploration or mining activity damages or prevents 

agricultural and grazing activities; and 

• the net income of the properties shall be assessed by comparison with the net income of 
properties located in its surroundings.

RIACHO DOS MACHADOS GOLD PROJECT 

Should the exploration license holder fail to produce an agreement with the respective landowner and 
attach it to the files at the DNPM then the DNPM shall notify the competent judge for the region where 
the area is located, who shall in turn initiate a court proceeding to determine rent and compensation 
within 15 days. In practice, this time schedule may be longer. A court proceeding would then take place 
in the case where no agreement is reached by the parties up to the point in which the judge would 
determine the amounts to be deposited as a court guarantee by the license holder and then the judge 
would order the landowner to accept such amounts and to allow access to the areas under dispute. 

The Brazilian Constitution also provides that States, Municipalities, Federal Districts and the agencies of 
the direct federal administration are entitled to receive royalties for the exploitation of the mineral 
resources by holders of mining concessions (including extraction permits, which are exceptional 
authorizations to exploit experimental quantities of minerals during the exploration phase). The rate of the 
royalty is set at a maximum of 3% (generally 1% for gold) over the net income arising from the sale of 
the mineral product obtained after the last stage of processing and before its industrialization. For the 
purposes of calculating the royalty, "net income" means all earnings arising from sales, less taxes on sales 
of the mineral product, transportation and insurance costs. 

On top of the federal or state royalty the law also guarantees a mining concession holder access to the 
respective area and in turn, a landowner royalty is due. The royalty is calculated at 50% of the total 
amount of federal royalty (2% for base metals). This royalty is usually the subject of negotiations with the 
landowners during either the exploration or the exploitation phase. 

In order to avoid problems with landowners, some companies pursue the option to acquire the land of the 
mining area. In such case however, a proper due diligence must be carried out before entering the real 
estate purchase and sale agreement. 

For the current mining concession a royalty of 2% has been established to cover state and other royalty 
payments. No agreement has yet been reached for the other land as it has not yet been established as an 
exploration license as of the date of this report.
