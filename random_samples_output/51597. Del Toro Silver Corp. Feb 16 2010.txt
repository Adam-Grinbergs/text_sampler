1.0  SUMMARY 
 
This summary report describes the Dos Naciones Project property of Candev Resource 
Exploration Inc. (Candev), north-central Sonora State, Mexico.  The writer has read 
National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101, and this report has been prepared in 
compliance with that instrument and form.  The writer fulfills the requirement to be a 
"qualified person" for the purposes of NI 43-101. 
 
The Dos Naciones property is located approximately 140 km north northeast of the city 
of Hermosillo, in north-central Sonora, Mexico and is approximately 75 km southwest of 
the important Cananea mining district.  The Dos Naciones property is comprised of one 
mineral concession that covers approximately 2,391 hectares. 
 
The Dos Naciones Project property is accessible via gravel roads that provide good 
access to all parts of the property.   About 3 hours is required to drive from Hermosillo to 
the property.  The climate within the property area is semi-arid, typical of higher 
elevations in the Sonoran desert; seasonal rains occur between April and July.   
 
Northern Sonora is one of the most important mining areas in Mexico.  A variety of 
different types of mineral deposits have been mined within the region, including porphyry 
copper deposits at Cananea and Nacozari, Carlin-type gold deposits at Santa Gertrudis 
and Amelia, and gold-silver veins at Klondike and Las Chispas (Heylmun, 1996).  Silver- 
and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined in at least two places on the Dos 
Naciones property, at Josefina and at the Dos Naciones occurrence area.  Historic 
workings on the Dos Naciones property include pits and short adits excavated to extract 
copper from skarns.   
 
The Dos Naciones Project property area is within the Cananea district of northern 
Sonora.  A wide variety of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks of various ages 
occur in the region; the geologic history of this region is relatively complex.   
 
Extensive sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Jurassic age occur within the property 
area.  These include rhyolite and sandstone of possible Early Jurassic age and younger 
sandstone, siltstone, argillite and minor limestone of Late Jurassic age; andesite flows 
are locally interstratified with the Late Jurassic sedimentary rocks.  Late Jurassic 
sandstone hosts most of the gold and silver occurrences northeast of Cucurpe (Figure 
3).   The stratified rock units are intruded by granodiorite of Late Cretaceous and Early 
Tertiary age; this intrusive rock unit is known as the Laramide Batholith.  Skarns within 
the property area have likely formed as a result of infiltration metasomatism involving 
magmatic hydrothermal fluids from the nearby granodiorite stock.   
 
The economic mineralization encountered to date on the Dos Naciones Project property 
is quartz veins containing lead, silver and minor gold.  In addition, skarn or calc-silicate 
rocks at Dos Naciones locally contain gold, silver and copper.  Thus, there have been at 
least two episodes of gold and silver mineralization at the Dos Naciones property.  The 
geological setting of the Dos Naciones property is favourable for economic porphyry 
copper deposits. 
 
The results of geochemical rock sampling show that economic concentrations of silver 
and gold occur in quartz veins from two separate areas within the Dos Naciones 
property.  Limited historic production has occurred from these veins.  The results of 



geochemical rock sampling also show that copper-iron skarns within the Dos Naciones 
property also contain gold and silver.  Skarns have also been mined within the property 
area. 
 
The results of the writer's geochemical rock sampling confirmed the results of historic 
sampling on the property. 
 
The Dos Naciones property hosts different styles of significant metallic mineralization.   
 
Economic concentrations of silver and lead occur in quartz veins at both the Josefina 
and the Dos Naciones occurrence areas within the property.  Economic concentrations 
of copper occur in skarn within the property area.  Skarn in the property also contains 
silver and gold.  There have been at least two episodes of gold and silver mineralization 
at the Dos Naciones property.   
 
The geological setting of the Dos Naciones property area is favourable for bulk-tonnage 
porphyry copper deposits, and for skarn-hosted deposits.  Porphyry copper deposits 
have been mined in the region at Nacozari and at Cananea (Bushnell, 1988).  In addition 
to the porphyry-style mineralization, skarn-style copper deposits have also been mined 
at Cananea (Meinert, 1982). 
 
The aeromagnetic low within the central part of the Dos Naciones property may indicate 
the presence of silica- or clay-altered rocks, both of which are often associated with 
porphyry copper style mineralization.  In the writer's opinion, the geological setting of the 
Dos Naciones property is favourable for the occurrence of porphyry copper deposits. 
 
Recommendations and budget 
 
A staged exploration program is recommended.  Phase One of the proposed exploration 
program would consist of detailed geological mapping, hand trenching and prospecting.  
This work would be directed towards better-delineating the mineralized veins at Josefina, 
and at the Dos Naciones occurrence area.  The sedimentary and volcanic rocks within 
the property should be mapped in an attempt to determine whether or not there is a 
stratigraphic control to skarn formation; perhaps skarns form where faults intersect 
particular, mappable stratigraphic units.   
 
The existing results of geochemical skarn sampling should be reviewed to determine if a 
property-scale metal zoning pattern is present within the skarns at Dos Naciones. 
 
The area of the aeromagnetic low should be geologically mapped.  The objective of the 
mapping will be to look for late igneous dykes which often occur in wallrocks nearby 
igneous intrusions.  In addition, any clay-altered or silica-altered rock within the area 
should be mapped, and the intensity of the alteration should be noted because both 
clay-altered and silica-altered rocks occur around the periphery of porphyry copper 
deposits that are associated with intrusive rock units.  Porphyry copper mineralization 
can occur within these alteration envelopes.   
 
The Phase One program is estimated to cost $ 53,500 U.S. 
 
If areas of igneous dykes or clay-altered or silica-altered rock are mapped within the 
area of the aeromagnetic low, then induced polarization (IP) surveying should be done to 



test for the presence of sulphide mineralization associated with the altered rocks.  The IP 
surveying would be part of Phase Two exploration work on the Dos Naciones property. 
 
A Phase Two program of diamond drilling of 500 m is recommended to test the 
mineralized vein structures at Josefina.   Additional diamond drilling may be required to 
test mineralized quartz vein structures in the Dos Naciones occurrence area. 
 
The Phase Two program is estimated to cost $ 174,000 U.S. 
 
If the Phase Two IP surveying indicates the presence of chargeability anomalies, then 
two or three diamond drill holes should be drilled to test for sulphide mineralization.  
Sulphide minerals occurring as disseminated and as veinlets can produce chargeability 
anomalies.  Porphyry copper deposits are characterized by both disseminated and 
veinlet sulphides.  The Phase Three program is estimated to cost $ 180,000. 
 
The total cost of the Phase One, Phase Two and Phase Three programs, including a 
contingency, is estimated to be $450,000 U.S. 
   
 
 



2.0  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
This summary report describes the Dos Naciones Project property of Candev Resource 
Exploration Inc., north-central Sonora State, Mexico.  This technical report is written at 
the request of Mr. Mark McLeary, President of Candev Resource Exploration Inc. 
(Candev), and is intended for public disclosure.   
 
This technical report summarizes and describes historical work conducted on the Dos 
Naciones Project property to date, and makes recommendations for future work on the 
property. 
 
This report is based on private unpublished reports, upon information provided by 
Candev and upon published governmental maps and geological reports pertaining to the 
Dos Naciones Project property region.  The authors of those records were not 
necessarily "Qualified Persons" within the context of National Instrument 43-101.  The 
writer has attempted to accurately portray the content of those records in this technical 
report. 
 
The writer David Pawliuk has previous experience in the Dos Naciones region, having 
visited a mineral property about 38 km north of the Dos Naciones property during 2004 
(Pawliuk, 2004).  The writer personally visited the Dos Naciones Project property on 
March 9, 2009, to examine the geology of the property and to collect geochemical rock 
samples from the property area. 
 
The writer has read National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F, and this report has 
been prepared in compliance with that instrument and form.  The writer fulfills the 
requirements to be a "Qualified Person" for the purposes of NI 43-101. 
 
The writer checked the historic geological mapping of the main mineralized areas during 
traverses of the property area; the historic geological mapping was found to be accurate.  
 
No legal search of mineral tenure (ownership) was made by the writer during the 
preparation of this report.  However, the writer examined copies of the mineral 
concession title document, as well as the legal title opinion document.  These papers 
indicate that the concession is registered in the name of Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V., 
and also indicate that the title to the concession is valid.  The information pertaining to 
the property ownership and the legal title opinion was obtained from Candev.   The writer 
disclaims responsibility for this information.   
 



3.0  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The Dos Naciones Project property is located approximately 140 km north northeast of 
the city of Hermosillo, in north-central Sonora, Mexico (Figure 1).  The Dos Naciones 
mining property is located approximately 75 km southwest of the important Cananea 
mining district (Figure 1).   The Cananea district produced more than 2.27 billion kg of 
copper, in addition to lead, zinc and molybdenum, between 1900 and 1982 (Meinert, 
1982).  The Dos Naciones property is comprised of one mineral concession, or lote, that 
covers approximately 2,391 hectares (Figure 2).  The Dos Naciones mineral concession 
measures approximately 5 km east-west by 5 km north-south; it surrounds the "CRUZ" 
concession, which covers an area of 100 hectares. 
 
The writer has examined a legal title opinion document pertaining to the Dos Naciones 
property.  The title opinion document was prepared by Alfonso Gonzalez Uribe, Partner, 
Cornejo, Mendez, Gonzalez Duarte, S.C., a Mexican law firm.  A copy of the legal title 
opinion document forms Appendix A.  The mineral concession that forms the Dos 
Naciones property was staked by Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V. (Minera Alta Vista), a 
Mexican company that is a subsidiary of Yale Resources Ltd.   Mineral concession Dos 
Naciones, number 230649, was registered September 28, 2007 and expires September 
27, 2057.  The concession is registered by the Government of Mexico in Book 366 Page 
155 Act 309.  This exploration concession covers an area of 2930.8269 ha, and is 
currently registered in the name of Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V.  Fifty percent (50%) of 
the concession is held by Candev and Minera Alta Vista holds the remaining 50% of the 
concession.   
 
The Dos Naciones mineral concession lies within the municipalities of Opodepe and 
Cucurpe, Sonora.    Payments of $12,146 pesos are paid every semester, i.e., twice per 
year, to the Government of Mexico in order to maintain the rights to the mineral 
concession.  
 
The Dos Naciones mineral concession is illustrated in Figure 2. 
   
4.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND  
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Dos Naciones Project property is located in north-central Sonora, Mexico 
approximately 60 km southeast of the town of Magdalena de Kino, or 140 km north 
northeast of Hermosillo (Figure 1).  The Dos Naciones Project property is accessible via 
a gravel road that leads to Rancho Los Janos; this gravel road leads southward from the 
paved road between Magdalena de Kino and the village of Los Janos.  The turnoff 
southwards to Rancho Los Janos is about 10 km east of the village of Cucurpe.  Four-
wheel-drive roads extend southwards beyond the ranch buildings and provide good 
access to all parts of the property (Figure 4).  About 3 hours is required to drive from 
Hermosillo to the Dos Naciones property.   
 
There is a turf airstrip about 850 m long within the northeast corner of the concession 
area (Figure 4).  However, this airstrip has been de-activated by erecting fence posts at 
intervals along the length of the airstrip, in order to prevent it's use.  
 







There is an electrical powerline extending north from the village of Cucurpe to the Mina 
Santa Gertrudis, a former gold-producing mine located about 45 km north of the Dos 
Naciones property.  Cucurpe is about 20 km northwest of the Dos Naciones property.   
 
The climate within the property area is semi-arid, typical of higher elevations in the 
Sonoran desert.  Seasonal rains occur between April and July.  The local ranchers have 
constructed dams along creek drainages within the property area, to collect runoff water 
for their livestock.    
 
Local accommodation is available on the property; the rancher has several rooms and a 
bunk house for hunters that visit the area in January of each year.  These 
accommodations could be made available during the rest of the year.  Additional 
accommodation can be found at a hotel on the eastern outskirts of Cucurpe.  Limited 
supplies are also available at Curcurpe.  Magdalena de Kino is the nearest community 
with fuel and full services.  Magdalena de Kino is situated along the Pan-American 
Highway about 85 km south of the United States border at Nogales.   
 
The Dos Naciones Project property area forms part of the Sierra El Jucaral, a north 
northwest trending mountain range on the western fringe of the Sierra Madre de 
Occidental.  Elevations range between 1,140 and 1,690 m a.s.l. within the property area.  
The hillsides are moderately steep and thinly forested by scrub oak trees.  There are 
local brushy areas along creek valleys, but most of the property area is open and grass-
covered between the oak trees.   
 
Rock outcrop is exposed over about 10 to 20 per cent of the Dos Naciones Project 
property area. 
 
5.0  HISTORY 
 
North-central Sonora has undergone intermittent exploration since the time of the copper 
discoveries at Nacozari in 1660 and at Cananea in 1760 (Heylmun, 1996).  Northern 
Sonora is one of the most important mining areas in Mexico.  A variety of different types 
of mineral deposits have been mined within the region, including porphyry copper 
deposits at Cananea and Nacozari, Carlin-type gold deposits at Santa Gertrudis and 
Amelia, and gold-silver veins at Klondike and Las Chispas (Heylmun, 1996; Figure 1).  
 
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined in at least two places on the Dos 
Naciones property, at Josefina and at the Dos Naciones occurrence area. 
 
Historic workings on the Dos Naciones property include pits and short adits excavated to 
extract copper from skarns.   
 
 5.1 Dos Naciones Occurrence Area 
 
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Dos Naciones occurrence 
area, in the southwest corner of the Dos Naciones property.  The writer found a metal 
stamp used for crushing galena-bearing quartz vein material at this site during his 
property visit.  From the appearance of the metal stamp and other metal debris at Dos 
Naciones occurrence area, the writer estimates that the most recent activity there was at 
least 40 years ago.     
 



There is a 30 m deep shaft excavated within granitic intrusive rock at the Dos Naciones 
occurrence area; this shaft is labelled Shaft # 2 on Figure 4a, which shows the geology 
and sampling at the Dos Naciones occurrence area.   
 
From the size of the mine dump piles, the writer estimates that at least 1,000 tonnes of 
vein material has been mined at Dos Naciones occurrence area.   
 

 There has been limited historic mining of the copper- and iron-bearing skarns at the Dos 
Naciones occurrence area.  One skarn body in this area extends across 100 m by 20 m, 
and the other skarn body is 180 m long by 75 m wide.  
 

 5.2 Josefina Area 
 
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Josefina area at the 
central part of the Dos Naciones property.  From the appearance of the mine dump at 
Josefina, the writer estimates that the most recent activity there was at least 10 years 
ago.  From the appearance of the mine dumps at Josefina, the writer estimates that 
about 50 tonnes of vein material has been mined at Josefina. 
 
There are at least three quartz veins within the Josefina area.  These veins dip steeply to 
the northeast and extend for at least 250 m along strike (Figure 4b).  These veins are 
from 0.5 m to 3.0 m wide; a shaft 2.5 m deep has been excavated within one of these 
quartz veins.   
 
5.3 La Espanola 
 
La Espanola area is on the eastern side of the Dos Naciones property (Figure 4).  Here, 
the writer saw a reverse circulation drillsite that appears to be several years old.  Minera 
Alta Vista has determined that six drillholes have been completed in the La Espanola 
area (Vidales, 2008).  Anecdotal evidence suggests that these holes were drilled during 
the 1990's by Penoles, the largest mining company in Mexico.  The results of this drilling 
are unknown to the writer.  Minera Alta Vista is currently seeking additional information 
pertaining to these drill holes.  
 
The most recent known exploration work on the Dos Naciones property was geological 
mapping and geochemical rock sampling by Minera Alta Vista, S.A. de C.V., a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Yale Resources Ltd.  The geochemical rock sampling was mainly 
done in areas of historic workings within the property area (Vidales, 2008).  Results of 
this work indicated that economic concentrations of silver and lead are present in quartz 
veins which occur at two places on the property. 
 
  



6.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The Dos Naciones Project property area is within the Cananea district of northern 
Sonora.  The Cananea district was mapped by Teran Martinez et al. (1999) of the 
Servicio Geologico Mexicano at 1:250,000 scale; most of the description of the 
geological setting that follows is taken from their map with marginal notes.  A wide 
variety of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks of various ages occur in the 
region; the geologic history of this region is relatively complex.  The geology of the Dos 
Naciones property region is presented in Figure 3.  
  
The oldest rock units within the property region are gneisses of Early Proterozoic age 
that belong to the Bamori Metamorphic Complex, which formed as a result of the 
Mazatazal Orogeny (Teran Martinez et al., 1999).  These gneisses occur about 15 km to 
the south, and to the southeast, of the Dos Naciones property area (Figure 3).  Granite 
of Proterozoic age is also exposed south of the property.   
 
Areas of Cambrian age quartzite have been mapped within the Dos Naciones property.  
 
The next youngest rocks are extensive sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Jurassic age.  
These include rhyolite and sandstone of possible Early Jurassic age and younger 
sandstone, siltstone, argillite and minor limestone of Late Jurassic age; andesite flows 
are locally interstratified with the Late Jurassic sedimentary rocks.  Late Jurassic 
sandstone hosts most of the gold and silver occurrences northeast of Cucurpe (Figure 
3).  Slate and quartzite of possible Middle Jurassic age were mapped by Teran Martinez 
et al. (1999) in an area about 12 km north of Dos Naciones (Figure 3). 
 
Limestone and shale of Cretaceous age overlie the Late Jurassic sedimentary rocks to 
the west of the Dos Naciones property (Figure 3).     
 
The stratified rock units are intruded by a large body of granodiorite and granite of Late 
Cretaceous and Early Tertiary age known as the Laramide Batholith (Teran Martinez et 
al., 1999).   
 
Cretaceous-aged limestone and shale are overlain by Tertiary rhyolite to the east of Dos 
Naciones (Figure 3).     
 
Tertiary conglomerate covers much of the property region, especially the sides of the 
wide, northerly trending valleys (Figure 3).     
  
Regional deformation has resulted in numerous faults crosscutting the Dos Naciones 
Property area (Figure 3).   Most of these faults have likely been reactivated at different 
times.  Regional-scale, northerly trending normal faults indicate that east-west crustal 
extension has occurred since the Tertiary Period. 
 
7.0  DEPOSIT TYPES AND EXPLORATION MODEL 
 
The economic mineralization encountered to date on the Dos Naciones Project property 
is quartz-galena veins and copper-iron skarns.   
 
Skarn or calc-silicate rocks locally contain gold, silver, copper and iron within the 
property area, as at both the east and west sides of the Dos Naciones occurrence area 











(Figure 4a).  The skarns here likely formed as a result of infiltration metasomatism 
involving magmatic hydrothermal fluids from the nearby granodiorite stock.  Most major 
skarn deposits have formed in a similar manner (Ray and Webster, 1991a; Meinert, 
1993).  The skarns at the Dos Naciones occurrence area are the result of alteration of 
the wallrock sediments, and so are classified as exoskarns.  The skarn formation here is 
likely controlled by the faults which extend through these skarns; the faults acted as a 
conduit for the magmatic hydrothermal fluids that formed the skarn.   
 
Figure 5 depicts an example of fault-controlled mineralization within skarn.   Faults and 
fractures can localize gold and silver mineralization within skarns (Ray, 1995).  The fault 
at the western Dos Naciones occurrence area has been reactivated since the skarn 
formation, and a discontinuous quartz vein has been emplaced along this fault.  Smaller, 
late quartz veins up to 25 cm wide crosscut skarn at this area; these quartz veins are not 
emplaced along faults.    
 
Another fault-controlled, magnetite-bearing exoskarn is present at eastern Dos Naciones 
occurrence area (Figure 4a).  The best sulphide mineralization here occurs adjacent to 
the fault, which has been re-activated after the skarn formed, similar to the fault on the 
west side of the Dos Naciones occurrence area.  This fault dips at about 55 degrees to 
the northeast. 
 
Figure 6 is a schematic cross section of a porphyry copper mineralizing system.  The 
figure shows that copper-bearing skarns, lead-silver quartz veins and stockwork/breccia 
porphyry copper-gold mineralization can all occur within various parts of a regional scale 
porphyry copper system.  Copper-bearing skarns and lead-silver veins occur within the 
Dos Naciones property; these types of mineralization often occur around the periphery of 
porphyry copper systems (Thompson, 1995).  In the writer's opinion, there is good 
potential for an economic porphyry copper deposit to occur within the Dos Naciones 
property area. 
 
A regional scale aeromagnetic low feature occurs within the Dos Naciones property area 
(Figure 3; (Servicio Geologico Mexicano, 1998).  The aeromagnetic map shows an ovoid 
magnetic low within the south-central part of the property area.  Because skarns within 
the property area contain magnetite, skarns will be indicated by magnetic highs.  A 
magnetic low can indicate an area where the rocks have been affected by either silica or 
clay mineral alteration.  These kinds of wallrock alteration are typical of porphyry copper 
deposits (e.g., Drummond and Godwin, 1976).    
 
8.0  MINERALIZATION 
 
The economic mineralization encountered to date on the Dos Naciones Project property 
is quartz veins containing galena, silver and minor gold.  In addition, skarn or calc-
silicate rocks at Dos Naciones locally contain gold, silver and copper.  Thus, there have 
been at least two episodes of gold and silver mineralization at the Dos Naciones 
property. 
 
The geological setting of the Dos Naciones property is favourable for economic porphyry 
copper deposits. 
 
 5.1 Dos Naciones Occurrence Area 
 



Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Dos Naciones occurrence 
area, in the southwest corner of the Dos Naciones property.     
 
There is a 30 m deep shaft excavated within granitic intrusive rock at the Dos Naciones 
occurrence area; this shaft is labelled Shaft # 2 on Figure 4a, which shows the geology 
and sampling at the Dos Naciones occurrence area.  No vein is exposed in the sides of 
the shaft opening, and the writer did not attempt to enter the shaft.  The size and attitude 
of the mineralized vein in these underground workings is unknown.  However, the vein is 
at least 30 cm wide, because vein quartz pieces up to 30 cm in diameter were found in 
the dump pile.  The mineralized vein may possibly occur along the contact between the 
argillite wallrock and the intrusive granodiorite.  A short quartz vein crosscutting argillite 
is exposed downslope of the old workings, near the contact with the intrusive 
granodiorite; this vein dips to the southwest (Figure 4a).  The old mine workings at the 
Dos Naciones occurrence area are spaced over a distance of about 250 m on surface, 
indicating that the mineralized silver-lead quartz vein here extends at least 250 m along 
strike.  
 
From the size of the mine dump piles, the writer estimates that at least 1,000 tonnes of 
vein material has been mined at Dos Naciones occurrence area.  A select sample, 
number E51556, of the better-mineralized vein material from this dump collected by the 
writer contains 221 parts per million (ppm) or 221 g/t silver, 4.44% lead and 0.636% zinc 
(Figure 4a; Appendices B and C).  Historic sample 464311 of select material from the 
same dump contained 88 g/t silver, 1.75% lead and 1% zinc (Vidales, 2008). 
 

 The writer collected rock sample E51557 at the skarn outcrop area on the west side of 
the Dos Naciones occurrence.  This sample is a continuous chip sample across 0.75 m, 
collected from the same general area as historic sample 464307, within the central part 
of the skarn outcrop area (Figure 4a).  The writer found no markings to indicate the 
locations of the historic sample sites within this skarn outcrop area, so the results of 
these two samples cannot be directly compared.  Instead, the results of sample E51557 
give an indication of the tenor of mineralization within a typical portion of the skarn.  
Sample E51557 contains abundant iron oxide, and about 1% combined disseminated 
malachite and azurite.  This sample contains 9,850 ppm (0.985%) copper, 42.7 g/t silver, 
0.315 g/t gold, 577 ppm lead and 607 ppm zinc (Appendices B and C).  Historic sample 
464307 contained 3.32% copper, 126 g/t silver, 0.185 g/t gold, less than 2 ppm lead and 
370 ppm zinc across 2.0 m (Vidales, 2008).  The skarn here is crosscut by a fault 
striking 140 degrees and dipping 46 to 50 degrees to the southwest.  This fault probably 
acted as a conduit for the hydrothermal fluids that formed the skarn; most of the skarn 
occurs in the fault hangingwall.  The fault was later reactivated.  A discontinuous quartz 
vein up to 25 cm wide occurs along this fault.  The fault and associated quartz vein are 
approximately parallel the quartz vein exposed to the east, which crosscuts argillite near 
the granodiorite / argillite contact downslope to the south of sample site E51556 (Figure 
4a).   The skarn outcrop area at the western side of the Dos Naciones occurrence area 
extends across about 100 m by 20 m.  
 

 The writer collected rock sample E51558 at the skarn outcrop area on the east side of 
the Dos Naciones occurrence area (Figure 4a).  This sample is medium brown, fine 
grained, moderately fractured skarn crosscut by irregular magnetite veinlets up to 7 cm 
wide that form 3 to 4% of the rock volume; the skarn contains limonite and malachite 
(Appendix C).  The rock is intensely weathered; no sulphide minerals were seen.  
Sample E51558 is a continuous chip sample across 1.7 m between marks showing the 



limits of historic sample 464324.  Sample E51558 was collected to check the results of 
historic sample 464324; sample 464324 is noted as having a width of 1.8 m.  Sample 
E51558 contains 7.3 g/t silver, 0.287 g/t gold, 0.785% copper, 102 ppm lead and 317 
ppm zinc across 1.7 m (Appendices B and C).  Historic sample 464324 contained 9.5 g/t 
silver, 0.150 g/t gold, 1.22% copper, less than 2 ppm lead and 322 ppm zinc across 1.8 
m (Vidales, 2008).  The eastern skarn at Dos Naciones occurrence area extends across 
about 180 m by 75 m. 

  
 5.2 Josefina Area 

 
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Josefina area in the 
central part of the Dos Naciones property.   
 
There are at least three quartz veins within the Josefina area.  These veins dip steeply to 
the northeast, extend for at least 250 m along strike, and are open along strike and at 
depth (Figure 4b).  A short shaft has been excavated within one of these quartz veins. 
 
The writer collected rock sample E51559 from a mineralized quartz vein at Josefina, as 
a check on the results for historic sample 464345.  The quartz vein here is milky white 
with traces of light brown limonite along weathered fracture surfaces; no sulphide 
minerals were seen.  The vein dips at about 60 degrees to the east.  This vein is almost 
certainly emplaced along a fault; there is a 6 or 8 cm wide band within the central part of 
the vein that is finely banded on a mm scale.  The vein quartz is sugary and sandy within 
this band, indicating movement after the vein was emplaced.  The quartz vein formed 
during at a series of pulses; there are at least seven distinct bands within the vein; each 
of these bands is marked by subhedral quartz crystals lining open spaces within the 
vein.  The bands are up to 4 cm wide.  Open cavities within the vein locally are up to 10 
by 25 by 8 cm across. 
 
Sample E51559 contains 22.3 g/t silver, 0.044 g/t gold, 0.354% lead and 137 ppm zinc 
across 1.8 m.  Historic sample 464345 from the same site contained 39 g/t silver, less 
than 0.005 g/t gold, 0.40% lead and 69 ppm zinc.   
 
5.3 La Espanola 
 
La Espanola area is on the east side of the Dos Naciones property (Figure 4).  Here, the 
writer saw a reverse circulation drillsite that appears to be several years old.  Minera Alta 
Vista has determined that six drillholes were completed in the La Espanola area during 
the 1990's.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that these holes were drilled by Penoles, the 
largest mining company in Mexico.  The results of this drilling are unknown to the writer.  
Minera Alta Vista is currently seeking additional information pertaining to these drill 
holes.  
 
 
 







9.0  EXPLORATION 
 
The most recent exploration work on the Dos Naciones property was geological mapping 
and geochemical rock sampling by Minera Alta Vista (Yale Resources Ltd.).  The results 
of their work are detailed below. 
 
 Dos Naciones occurrence area 
 
Yale Resources Ltd. collected seven chip samples across the eastern skarn at Dos 
Naciones occurrence area during 2008.  These chip samples range from 1.70 m to 2.50 
m wide.  These seven samples contain from 0.51% to 1.51% copper, from 2.3 g/t to 29.9 
g/t silver, and from 0.04 g/t to 0.43 g/t gold (Yale Resources Ltd. news release dated 
October 29, 2008). 
 
Yale Resources Ltd. also collected seven chip samples across the western skarn at Dos 
Naciones occurrence area.  These chip samples range from 2.00 m to 3.30 m wide.  
These seven samples contained from 0.48% to 3.32% copper, from 0.8 g/t to 126.0 g/t 
silver, and from 0.01 g/t to 0.22 g/t gold (Yale Resources Ltd. news release dated 
October 29, 2008). 
 
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have been mined at the Dos Naciones occurrence 
area.  Select samples of better-mineralized material from the mine dumps contained 
256.0 g/t silver with 4.45% lead, and 182.0 g/t silver with 3.29% lead and 0.61 g/t gold 
(Yale Resources Ltd. news release dated February 10, 2009).  The old workings are 
now collapsed, but an examination of the workings on surface indicates that the vein(s) 
were mined on two different levels.  
 
 Josefina Area 
 
Silver- and lead-bearing quartz veins have also been mined at the Josefina area, in the 
central part of the property.  A select sample of better-mineralized material from the mine 
dump contained 591.0 g/t silver with 12.6% lead (Yale Resources Ltd. news release 
dated February 10, 2009).   
 
 La Espanola Area 
 
Two skarn areas are known within the La Espanola area in the east-central part of the 
Dos Naciones property (Figure 4).  Two chip samples from the southern skarn assayed 
0.98% and 1.90% copper, 0.10 g/t and 0.15 g/t gold, and 17.3 g/t and 38.6 g/t silver; 
both samples were collected across 2.0 m (Yale Resources Ltd. news release dated 
October 29, 2008).  The southern skarn extends across an area of about 260 m by 125 
m. 
 
Yale Resources Ltd. collected four chip samples from the northern skarn area at La 
Espanola.  These chip samples range from 1.0 m to 2.0 m wide.  These four chip 
samples contained from 0.78% to 1.19% copper, from 0.21 g/t to 0.35 g/t gold, and from 
10.5 g/t to 26.8 g/t silver (Yale Resources Ltd. news release dated October 29, 2008).  
The northern skarn extends across an area of about 100 m by 50 m. 
 
Minera Alta Vista has paid semi-annual taxes to the Government of Mexico to maintain 
the mineral concession. 



 
 
10.0  SAMPLE METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
The writer collected four geochemical rock samples from the Dos Naciones Project 
property area on March 9, 2009.   Three of these samples were collected from Dos 
Naciones occurrence area, and one from the Josefina area (Figures 4a and 4b).   
 
11.0  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
The rock samples were bagged, and the bags were sealed by the writer.  The samples 
were then transported via truck from Dos Naciones property to Minera Alta Vista's 
offices at Hermosillo, Sonora.  The samples were delivered to ALS Chemex Laboratories 
in Hermosillo on March 10, 2009 by the writer.  The writer maintained custody of the 
samples from the time the samples were collected until the samples were delivered to 
ALS Chemex Laboratories facility at Hermosillo.   
 
The rocks were analyzed for gold by geochemical fire assay, solvent extraction and 
atomic adsorption spectrometry.  A subsample of 30 gm was assayed.  The rock sample 
was also analyzed for silver, mercury, arsenic, antimony and 46 other elements by aqua 
regia acid digestion ICPMS.   
 
A certificate of analysis forms Appendix B.  The rock sample descriptions are presented 
in Appendix C. 
 
12.0  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
The results of geochemical rock sampling show that economic concentrations of silver 
and gold occur in quartz veins from two separate areas within the Dos Naciones 
property.  Limited historic production has occurred from these veins.   
 
The results of geochemical rock sampling also show that copper-iron skarns within the 
Dos Naciones property also contain gold and silver.  Skarns have also been mined 
within the property area. 
 
As outlined above in the section on mineralization, the results of the writer's geochemical 
rock sampling confirmed the results of historic sampling on the property by Yale 
Resources Ltd. during 2008. 
 
13.0  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The west central side of the Dos Naciones mineral concession is adjoined by the "La 
Pitayita" mineral concession (Figure 2).  In addition, the Dos Naciones mineral 
concession completely surrounds the "Cruz" mineral concession, which covers an area 
of 1.0 km2 within the western part of the Dos Naciones mineral concession (Figure 2).   
 
Mineral concession "Grande" covers the ground to the north and west of the Dos 
Naciones mineral concession (Figure 2).   
 
Yamana Gold Inc. (Yamana) is proceeding with advanced development on their 
Mercedes/Klondike project located about 22 km northeast of the centre of the Dos 



Naciones mineral concession; Klondike is plotted on Figure 3.  Yamana has delineated 
proven and probable reserves of 2.6 million tonnes grading 7.1 g/t gold and 72 g/t silver 
within epithermal veins.  Yamana has obtained a positive result from a pre-feasibility 
study of the Mercedes project, and is planning for a six-year mine life, using a mining 
rate of 1,500 tonnes per day (www.yamana.com/Operations/OtherProjects/Mercedes).     
 
14.0  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
No mineral processing nor metallurgical testing were performed during the preparation of 
this report. 
 
15.0  MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
The Dos Naciones mineral concession is an early-stage exploration property.  No 
mineral resource estimates can be made at this time.  
 
16.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA 
 
It is the writer's opinion that there is no additional information or explanation necessary 
to make this technical report understandable and not misleading. 

 
17.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Dos Naciones property hosts different styles of significant metallic mineralization.   
 
Economic concentrations of silver and lead occur in quartz veins at both the Josefina 
and the Dos Naciones occurrence areas within the property.  The main mineralized vein 
structures extend for at least 250 m along strike at Josefina; these veins are likely 
emplaced along northwesterly trending, northeast dipping fault structures.  The 
mineralized veins at Josefina are open at both ends.  The attitude of the mineralized vein 
structure(s) at the Dos Naciones occurrence area is unknown, but these veins may dip 
to the southwest.   Old workings are found over a distance of about 250 m at the Dos 
Naciones occurrence area, indicating that the mineralized vein(s) here probably have a 
strike length of at least 250 m.   
 
Extensive areas of skarn occur within the Dos Naciones property at the La Espanola 
area, and at the Dos Naciones occurrence area.  These skarns contain economic 
concentrations of copper, silver and gold.  Skarns often form around the periphery of 
porphyry copper mineralization systems (e.g., Figure 6).  
 
Quartz veins locally occur along faults that crosscut skarns, as in the Dos Naciones 
occurrence area.  A lead- and silver-bearing quartz vein occurs along a fault that strikes 
130 degrees and dips 55 degrees to the northeast at the east side of the Dos Naciones 
occurrence area; this vein is approximately parallel the mineralized quartz veins at 
Josefina. 
 
There have been at least two episodes of metallic mineralization at the Dos Naciones 
property: within the skarns and within the mineralized quartz veins. 
 

http://www.yamana.com/Operations/OtherProjects/Mercedes


The geological setting of the Dos Naciones property area is favourable for bulk-tonnage 
porphyry copper deposits.  Porphyry copper deposits have been mined in the region at 
Nacozari and at Cananea (Bushnell, 1988).   
 
In addition to the porphyry-style mineralization, skarn-style copper deposits have also 
been mined at Cananea (Meinert, 1982).  In the writer's opinion, the Dos Naciones 
property has the potential to host economic skarn-style copper-silver mineralization, as 
well as economic porphyry copper deposits.  Mineralized skarns occur at the widely 
separated Dos Naciones occurrence area, and at the La Espanola area, within the 
property.   Both of these skarn areas likely formed as a result of metasomatic alteration 
by hydrothermal fluids from the central granodiorite intrusion within the Dos Naciones 
property.  These skarns extend for areas up to 260 m by 125 m across on surface, and 
are open at depth; the skarns may join at depth in both the La Espanola area, and at the 
Dos Naciones occurrence area. 
 
The aeromagnetic low within the central part of the Dos Naciones property may indicate 
the presence of silica- or clay-altered rocks, both of which are often associated with 
porphyry copper style mineralization.  In the writer's opinion, the geological setting of the 
Dos Naciones property is favourable for the occurrence of porphyry copper deposits. 
 
18.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
A staged program of recommended exploration for the Dos Naciones project property is 
outlined below. 
 
Further geological mapping and geochemical rock sampling should be done at the Dos 
Naciones property as a Phase One program.  This work should be done with the 
objective of developing diamond drill targets. 
 
Hand trenching, stripping, sampling and detailed geological mapping should be done 
along the mineralized quartz veins at the Josefina area.  Hand pits should be excavated 
at intervals of about 25 metres along the surface projection of the veins.  The better-
mineralized portions of the quartz veins will contain more galena, and so will likely be 
more recessive weathering than the less well mineralized parts of the veins.   
 
Once the better-mineralized sections of the veins at Josefina have been mapped and 
sampled, a series of diamond drill holes can be planned to test the veins at depth. 
 
The area around the quartz vein exposed at central Dos Naciones occurrence area 
should be stripped of overburden.  Detailed geological mapping of the vein should be 
done to attempt to determine the geological controls on vein emplacement.  Hand 
trenching and stripping should also be done in a few places across the contact between 
the intrusive granodiorite and the wallrock argillite.  The mineralized quartz-galena veins 
in this area were likely emplaced along or near the intrusive contact, but the mineralized 
veins are not exposed on surface.  A detailed examination of the intrusive contact may 
provide information regarding the setting and the attitude of the mineralized veins.    
 
The sedimentary and volcanic rocks within the property should be mapped in an attempt 
to determine whether or not there is a stratigraphic control to skarn formation.  The writer 
observed faults crosscutting the larger skarns within the property area; perhaps skarns 
form where faults intersect particular, mappable stratigraphic units.   



 
The existing results of geochemical skarn sampling should be reviewed, with the 
objective being to determine if some skarns are more favourable, i.e., contain more 
precious metals, than other skarns.  Elevated concentrations of bismuth, arsenic, cobalt 
and tellurium are often associated with precious metal-bearing skarns (Ray and 
Webster, 1991).  There may be a property-scale metal zoning pattern present within the 
skarns at Dos Naciones. 
 
The area of the aeromagnetic low as shown on Figure 3 should be geologically mapped.  
This aeromagnetic low indicates the possible presence of an underlying intrusive rock 
unit.  The objective of the mapping will be to look for late igneous dykes which often 
occur in wallrocks nearby igneous intrusions.  In addition, any clay-altered or silica-
altered rock within the area should be mapped, and the intensity of the alteration should 
be noted.  Both clay-altered and silica-altered rocks occur around the periphery of 
porphyry copper deposits that are associated with intrusive rock units.  The intensity of 
alteration usually increases towards the intrusive contact, and porphyry copper 
mineralization can occur within these alteration envelopes.   
 
A Phase Two program of diamond drilling of 500 m is recommended to test the better 
mineralized vein structures at Josefina.  The proposed holes should be spaced at about 
50 metre intervals.   The objective of this drilling program is to determine the attitude, 
thickness and grade of the better-mineralized parts of the Josefina veins.  This Phase 
Two program is estimated to cost $ 90,000 U.S. 
 
Additional diamond drilling may be required in Phase Two to test mineralized quartz vein 
structures in the Dos Naciones occurrence area in the southwest part of the property.  
The drilling here will be contingent on determining the attitude of the mineralized quartz-
galena veins from detailed geological mapping of the proposed hand pits at this target 
area.  A Phase Two program of diamond drilling of 300 m is recommended to test for the 
mineralized vein structures at Dos Naciones.  The objective of this drilling program 
would be to determine the location and attitude of the previously-mined quartz-galena 
veins.  The Phase Two diamond drilling in this area is estimated to cost $ 54,000 U.S.   
 
If areas of igneous dykes or clay-altered or silica-altered rock are mapped within the 
area of the aeromagnetic low, then induced polarization (IP) surveying should be done to 
test for the presence of sulphide mineralization associated with the altered rocks.  The IP 
surveying would be part of Phase Two exploration work on the Dos Naciones property, 
and is estimated to cost $ 30,000.  Porphyry copper deposits are characterized by the 
presence of sulphide minerals as disseminated grains and as veinlets.  Sufficiently 
abundant sulphides can be detected as chargeability anomalies by IP surveying.  If the 
IP surveying indicates the presence of chargeability anomalies, then two or three 
diamond drill holes should be drilled to test for copper mineralization.  These holes can 
be spaced 500 metres apart, and would be part of a Phase Three program on the 
property.  The Phase Three program is estimated to cost $ 180,000 U.S.

ROCK SAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS 
 



Rock sample descriptions 
 

Sample number  Description
 
E51556  Select sample from dump pile.  GPS position 0542919E /   

  3337450N +/- 5 m (WGS 84 datum used for Dos Naciones sample 
  sites).   Select sample of better-mineralized, milky white quartz  
  vein containing clots of subhedral galena up to 6 or 7 mm across.   
  Material sampled from dump pile to south of Tajo #2 shaft.  Shaft  
  itself excavated to a depth of about 30 m in greyish pink granite.   
  No vein material visible in walls of shaft at surface.  Therefore  
  attitude of the mineralizedd vein is not apparent.  Vein possibly  
  along granite/wallrock contact at depth here. 

 
E51557  GPS position 0542428E / 3337402N +/- 14 m.  Continuous chip  

  sample across 0.75 m width from same general location where  
  historic sample 464307 plotted on sampling map provided by  
  CanDev; however, no old sample marks remain at this site.  I  
  cleared-off 2 to 3 cm of weathered rock from outcrop surface  
  before collecting sample. Skarn.  Abundant iron oxide; about 1%  
  combined disseminated malachite (mostly) and azurite.  Traces  
  epidote coating up to 60% of steep fracture surfaces; epidote  
  coating only about 0.5 mm thick along fracture surfaces.     

 
E51558  GPS postion 0543336E / 3337321N +/- 7 m.  Continuous chip  

  sample across 1.7 m between marks showing limits of historic  
  sample 464324.  Medium brown, fine grained, moderately   
  fractured skarn.  Irregular magnetite veinlets up to 7 cm wide form  
  3 to 4% rock volume.  Limonite and malachite observed.  No  
  sulphide minerals seen but rock is intensely weathered.  Note that  
  historic sample 464324 noted as having a width of 2.0 m but my  
  measurement (using folding ruler) of sample width is 1.7 m.  

 
E51559  GPS position 0544610E / 3338786N +/- 9 m.  Continuous chip  

  sample across 1.8 m, which is width of exposed vein.  Quartz vein 
  with traces light brown limonite along weathered fracture surfaces.  
  No sulphides seen.  Vein strike about 010 degrees dip 60 degrees 
  to the east.  Vein is emplaced along fault.  There is a band 6 or 8  
  cm wide within central portion of vein that is banded on a mm  
  scale; the vein quartz here is sugary, granular, sandy material  
  versus solid quartz elsewhere.  Quartz vein overall is banded on  
  cm scale; there are at least 7 distinct bands with subhedral quartz  
  crystals lining the sides of open spaces within the vein.  Largest  
  open cavity seen is about 10 cm by 25 cm by 8 cm in size.   
  Josefina area.
