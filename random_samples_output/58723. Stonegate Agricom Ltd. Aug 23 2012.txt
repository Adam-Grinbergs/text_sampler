1.0   SUMMARY 

Stonegate Agricom Ltd. (Stonegate) is a Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based mining 
development company.  Stonegate is a Toronto Stock Exchange (stock symbol TSX:ST) listed 
company in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral resource properties to 
production in Canada, the United States of America (USA), and internationally.  Agapito 
Associates, Inc. (AAI) was commissioned by Stonegate to provide an independent Qualified 
Person's (QP) review and National Instrument (NI) 43-101 Technical Report (TR) on behalf of 
their subsidiary, Paris Hills Agricom Inc. (PHA), on the wholly owned Paris Hills Phosphate 
Project (the Property) located near the town of Bloomington in Bear Lake County, Idaho, USA.   

This report incorporates information from a maiden NI 43-101 report prepared for Rocky 
Mountain Resources Corp. (RMP), and three subsequent NI 43-101 reports prepared for 
Stonegate (AMEC Americas Limited [AMEC] 2010; AAI 2011; AAI 2012a).  The purpose of 
this report is two-fold: (1) the Mineral Resource for the principal mining target, the Lower 
Phosphate Zone (LPZ), has been updated to include seven new exploration drill holes,1 and (2) a 
maiden Mineral Resource is stated for a secondary mining target, the Upper Phosphate Zone 
(UPZ), based on assay results from 29 exploration holes.   

Stonegate developed plans for room-and-pillar mining in the LPZ as part of a Preliminary 
Feasibility Study (PFS) published in March 2012 (AAI 2012b).  LPZ Mineral Reserves were 
stated in the PFS and associated TR (AAI 2012a), and are carried forward in this report.  
Stonegate anticipates completing a Feasibility Study (FS) of room-and-pillar mining in the LPZ 
by the end of 2012.  No plans currently exist for mining in the UPZ. 

PHA acquired rights to the Property from RMP on 4 November 2009.  Stonegate has 
since acquired additional mineral leases which are described in Item 4.1—Mineral Surface and 
Land Tenure. 

Stonegate completed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on 28 April 2010.  

1.1 Location, Access, and Infrastructure  

The Property is located in Bear Lake County, Idaho, 3.2 kilometers (km) west of the 
towns of Paris and Bloomington.  

Adequate surface rights have been obtained to support mining operations on the Property, 
but additional rights may be required for processing facilities, waste management, and 
infrastructure.  Sources for water and electric power have been locally developed, but rights or 
agreements will need to be secured.  The Union Pacific Railroad (UP) provides freight services 
to Bear Lake County from an office located in Montpelier.  The track through Montpelier 
connects into the UP system at Pocatello, Idaho and Green River, Wyoming.  

Paris Hills is located in the state of Idaho, USA, a state with a reputation of being a 
"business friendly" jurisdiction.  Idaho was ranked 33rd out of 79 jurisdictions evaluated in the 

                                                           
1 Seven new drill holes added since March 2012:  PA106A, PA142A, PA159, PA165, PA171, PA183, and PA184.

 1.2  Tenure and Surface Rights  

The Property encompasses an area of approximately 1,008 hectares (ha).  Property 
holdings consist of 3 patented lode mining claims and 21 contiguous fee parcels (some with 
federal mineral reservations) covering portions of Sections 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 21 and 22 of 
Township 14 South, Range 43 East (T14S, R43E) in Bear Lake County.  The Property comprises 
federal, state, and private land holdings with various property rights and royalty agreements in 
place.   

PHA has secured the rights to conduct exploration for phosphate and metalliferous 
minerals on all parcels comprising the Property through federal and state exploration permits and 
private agreements.  Reasonable prospects exist for PHA to obtain the required permits and 
approvals to conduct mine operations. 

1.3  Geology  

Phosphate and vanadium beds of the Western Phosphate Field occur within the Permian 
Phosphoria Formation.  Permian rocks in and adjacent to the Western Phosphate Field consist of 
a chert-mudstone-phosphorite facies in eastern Idaho and southwestern Montana.  These beds 
intertongue with a sandstone facies toward the northeast and a carbonate facies toward the east 
and south.  Further east and south the interval is represented by red bed facies dominant in 
eastern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado.  

The phosphate and vanadium-rich mineralized beds occur in the horizontal limb and 
upturned to overturned limb (referred to as the "upturned limb") of the Paris Syncline.  The 
mineralized beds plunge northwest between 12 and 20 degrees (°) along the west-dipping, north-
plunging horizontal limb of the syncline.  The horizontal limb contains the principal resource 
target.  A significant portion of the mineralization is contained in the steeply dipping, upturned 
limb of the syncline.  The mineralization is hosted in the Meade Peak Member of the Permian 
Phosphoria Formation which is currently mined in open pits 50 km to the north near Soda 
Springs by the three major Idaho phosphate producers.  The PHA phosphate is of similar 
character to that being mined at Soda Springs.   

The target phosphate mineralization is contained in two zones (beds) termed the UPZ and 
LPZ, which range in depth from outcrop to more than 1,000 meters (m) deep.  The LPZ is the 
principal mining target for producing a direct ship phosphate ore (DSO) of high grade.  The UPZ 
is thicker, but of overall lesser grade which would require processing to achieve a marketable 
product and for that reason, remains a longer term target. Vanadium is contained in the 
Vanadium Zone (VZ) located immediately below the UPZ.  Mineralization in the upturned limb 
has a strike length of over 3 km on the Property.

1.4  History  

Historical work on the Property area began with location of a claim in Little Canyon in 
1903 at the future site of the Consolidated Mine.  The property changed ownership several times 
before being acquired by Solar Development Company, Ltd. (Solar) in 1930.  Solar sunk a 61-m 
decline and ran two lateral drifts totaling 1,066 m of underground development.  A total of 
3,175 tonnes (t) of phosphate ore were shipped.  The Property was optioned to Wyodak Coal 
Manufacturing Company (Wyodak) in 1942, after which little activity occurred until Earth 
Sciences, Inc. (ESI) acquired the holdings from the remaining landowners in 1973.  

The Paris Canyon Mine was formed by two homestead patents granted by the United 
States General Land Office (GLO) in 1901 and 1913.  Up to 54,000 t of phosphate was produced 
by 1919.  By 1925, the total underground workings comprised 915 m of tunnels, drifts, winzes, 
and crosscuts.    

Early work in the Consolidated and Paris Canyon Mines noted the presence of vanadium 
along with the phosphate.  Vanadium became an important strategic material during World 
War II.  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) began exploration work in the Paris-
Bloomington area in 1942 focusing in Paris, Bloomington, and Little Canyons.    

During the 1970s, ESI assembled a project area of approximately 1,660 ha which 
included the old Consolidated Mine, the Paris Canyon Mine, the Bloomington Mine, and the 
Bear Lake Mine.  From 1973 through 1977, ESI conducted exploration and development work, 
consisting of rotary and core drill holes, surface trenches, and two test mines.  

 In 1972, ESI drove a test drift 45 m on an outcrop in Bloomington Canyon.  In 1973, the 
drift was extended to the west and north until a major fault was encountered at approximately 
215 m from the portal.  An offset drift was driven 60 m east to intercept the VZ.  In 1975, 825 m 
of workings were developed in the UPZ for bulk metallurgical testing.  Approximately 38,000 t 
of phosphate ore and waste were mined.  ESI activity continued through the late-1970s.  ESI held 
much of the property package until it was relinquished in the early 1990s. 

In August 2008, RMP assembled a property position comprising 856 ha which included 
the sites of the former Consolidated, Bloomington Canyon, and Paris Canyon Mines.  RMP 
completed six reverse circulation (RC) drill holes on the southern end of the Property.  The 
purpose of the drilling was to confirm the results reported by ESI to form the basis for an NI 
43-101 TR. 

A total of 53 historical exploration holes were drilled by ESI and RMP, comprising 15 
RC holes (3,594 m), 15 core holes (3,031 m), 10 undefined holes (1,888 m), and 13 holes with 
no records.  

PHA and RMP executed an agreement on 24 September 2009 where PHA acquired the 
collective interests of RMP, including all federal, state, and private agreements.  The agreement 
was executed on 4 November 2009 granting PHA control of the core Property.  PHA 
subsequently expanded the Property to include additional federal leases and private properties.

Vanadium mineral reserves on the Property were reported as early as 1944 by Wyodak in 
conjunction with the USGS and United States Bureau of Mines (USBM).  ESI reported 
vanadium and phosphate reserves in 1976–77 following their exploration drilling program.  The 
historical reserves, while technically important, are not compliant with NI 43-101 standards. 

1.5  Exploration  

PHA acquired the holdings from RMP in September 2009 which included the interests to 
all Mineral Lease Agreements, rights to the State of Idaho exploration permits, a federal lease, 
and rights to a federal prospecting permit application.  Since acquiring these holdings, PHA has 
secured the transfer of the Mineral Lease Agreements and reissued the State of Idaho exploration 
permits.  PHA applied for approval to drill on the federal phosphate lease and was granted 
permission in September 2011.  PHA applied for and was granted approval for a federal 
prospecting permit and a federal exploration license in October 2011.  Also, PHA entered into 
five mineral lease agreements expanding the original RMP property boundary in 2011 and 2012.   

PHA commenced a drilling program in September 2010 and continued to drill and assay 
through 19 July 2012 for this report.   

Drilling was contracted to Major Drilling Group International Inc. (Major) who were 
mobilized out of Salt Lake City, Utah, for both RC and core drilling activities.  Exploration 
drilling on the federally controlled (United States Bureau of Land Management [BLM]) portion 
of the Property occurred in October and November 2011, following approval by BLM and 
issuance of exploration permits. 

A combined total of 25,985 m have been drilled in 85 holes, approximately 8,405 m of 
which were cored.  A total of 39 holes were used in the current LPZ resource estimate.  Twenty-
nine holes were used to evaluate the UPZ resource estimate.  The criteria for holes used in the 
resource estimate are (1) greater than 90 percent (%) core recovery through the phosphate zone 
and (2) assays completed by one of the two reliable, independent, and industry-recognized 
laboratories.  The idealized 90% core recovery criterion was later lowered to 85% as a practical 
response to difficult drilling conditions so that critical information from several holes could be 
included in the resource estimate.  Fourteen drill holes were lost due to difficult ground 
conditions.   

 The early drilling campaign achieved poor core recovery and produced incomplete data 
sets.  This was later addressed with the introduction of a strict protocol and procedure.  If core 
recovery was less than targeted, holes were re-drilled.  All holes were re-logged, re-measured, 
and depth-corrected to gamma geophysical logs.  Where previous sampling made reconstruction 
difficult or impossible, photographic records were reviewed to determine core recovery. 

Initial testing by ALS Chemex's (ALS) Vancouver laboratory revealed bias in the 
phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) assays and erratic results in some secondary quality parameters, 
prompting the decision to switch laboratories in June 2011.  A detailed sample protocol was 
designed for the retesting and ongoing testing.  IAS EnviroChem (EnviroChem) of Pocatello, 
Idaho, and Thornton Laboratories Testing & Inspection Services (Thornton) of Tampa, Florida, 
were selected for re-assaying pulp samples and samples from new holes with greater than 90% 
core recovery.  Both laboratories have phosphate testing experience.  Results of the two

laboratories showed strong agreement.  Standards and blank reference material confirmed 
reliability and showed good accuracy and precision at both laboratories. Following the PFS, 
Envirochem was designated the primary lab and Jacobs Engineering S.A. (Jacobs) as the 
secondary lab.  This was largely due to Envirochem's proximity to the project site and quicker 
assay turnaround time, and not due to quality issues with Thornton.  Jacobs performed duplicate 
testing at a rate of 5%. 

Based on a review of the exploration program, the QPs are confident that early problems 
of core recovery, sampling, and assay bias have been resolved and that the exploration dataset 
used in this resource estimate meets the criteria for use under NI 43-101.  PHA's quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program is designed with aggressive duplication and 
insertion.  Procedures are well documented and have been followed accordingly. 

Five trade seismic lines were acquired for reprocessing to assist in interpretation of 
regional structure.  RPS Boyd PetroSearch (Boyd) reprocessed two-dimensional (2D) seismic 
trade lines, one on a north-south line and four on east-west lines.  Structure on top of the Rex 
Chert Member, LPZ, and the Wells Formation was mapped and tied into historical fault trends.  
The preliminary analysis confirms the structural dip of the strata previously identified from the 
drill holes and shows various faults crossing the Property, including major normal faults which 
bound the deposit near the eastern property line.  The age and the quality of the raw data 
precluded detailed depth or structural mapping.  

PHA's exploration plans going forward include infill and step-out drilling to upgrade 
remaining portions of the LPZ and UPZ classified as Inferred Mineral Resources in the 
horizontal limb to Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources (M&I), and drilling along the 
western margin of the deposit to define the LPZ and UPZ Mineral Resource contained in the 
upturned limb.  The upturned limb is presently identified as an Exploration Target.  

1.6  Metallurgical and Processing  

Preliminary metallurgical testing was conducted by Jacobs Engineering S.A. (Jacobs) in 
2011 and 2012, an independent, industry-recognized Florida-based process engineering firm.  
Tests were conducted on composite core samples from the LPZ and UPZ.  Jacobs' phosphoric 
acid pilot plant demonstrated that merchant grade phosphoric acid (MGA) and granular 
fertilizers could be produced from the LPZ material without beneficiation, supporting the 
potential for producing DSO from the LPZ if targeted grades can be achieved during mining.  
Both monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) granular fertilizers 
were produced from concentrated phosphoric acid.  Testing of the UPZ determined that some 
beneficiation would be required to produce marketable phosphate rock.  No testing was 
completed for the VZ.  Additional ore characterization and fertilizer test work is planned. 

1.7  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates  

Mineralization on the Property occurs in the UPZ, VZ, and LPZ, which together cover a 
plan area of 778 ha of the 1,008-ha Property.  The Mineral Resource estimate for the principal 
mineralized target, the LPZ, is based on core drilling and chemical analyses on core from 39 
exploration holes drilled by PHA in 2010–2012.  The Mineral Resource estimate for the 
secondary mineralized target, the UPZ, is based on chemical analyses on core from 29 of the 



NI 43-101 Technical Report, Paris Hills Phosphate Project, Bloomington, Idaho, USA 
Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd.

exploration holes.  The UPZ and LPZ contained in the upturned limb and VZ are characterized 
as Exploration Targets for which estimates of mineralization are based on historical, NI 43-101 
non-compliant exploration data collected prior to PHA's exploration program.   

The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Leo J. Gilbride, P.E., Senior Consultant 
with AAI, member of the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc., and a QP for 
this TR.  The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of 15 August 2012. 

1.7.1 Mineral Resources  

Mineral Resources were estimated using a kriged gridded-seam computer geologic model 
constructed with Carlson Mining 2011 Software™.  Mineral Resource classifications are based 
on the technical methodology of the Sedimentary Phosphate Resource Classification System of 
the USBM and the USGS (Geological Survey Circular 882, 1982).  The Mineral Resource 
calculations are compliant with Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 
Best Practice Guidelines for Industrial Minerals.  

Table 1-1 summarizes the LPZ phosphate Mineral Resource for the Property.  The 
Mineral Resource assumes a minimum LPZ composite cutoff grade of 24.0% P2O5 and a 
minimum bed thickness of 0.5 m, targeting a DSO concentrate in excess of 29.5% P2O5.  Drill 
holes show that the LPZ thickness2 ranges from 0.8 to 2.9 m with composite grades ranging from 
24.5% to 34.2% P2O5.  The LPZ typically ranges between 1.6 and 2.0 m thick in the area of 
interest for mining, and averages 1.7 m thick across the entire Property.  Phosphate resource 
tonnages are based on an average dry bulk density of 2.6 tonnes per cubic meter (t/m3) derived 
from 36 laboratory bulk density tests on representative LPZ core. 

The LPZ M&I Resource expanded by 7.5 million tonnes (Mt) compared to the previous 
26 March 2012 estimate due to the addition of seven new exploration holes.  The net Inferred 
Mineral Resources dropped from 8.1 to 4.6 Mt as a result of the additional drilling and upgrading 
to the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource categories.  Average quality parameters 
remained substantially unchanged with the exception of magnesium oxide (MgO) content.  The 
average P2O5 grade of the Inferred Mineral Resource improved slightly from 29.3% to 29.9% as 
a result of favorable grades to the north.  Average MgO content for the Resource increased from 
approximately 0.28% to 0.43%, largely as a result of elevated concentrations of MgO 
encountered in hole PA162.  The high MgO content was confirmed by chemical analysis at a 
second laboratory.  PA162 is located on the western margin of the deposit near the upturned 
limb. 

Table 1-2 summarizes the UPZ phosphate Mineral Resource for the Property.  The 
Mineral Resource assumes a minimum UPZ composite cutoff grade of 20.0% P2O5 and a 
minimum bed thickness of 1.5 m.  In 29 core holes, the UPZ thickness ranges from 2.6 to 5.7 m 
with composite grades ranging from 20.2% to 31.4% P2O5.  Phosphate resource tonnages are 
based on an assumed average dry bulk density of 2.6 t/m3.  If mined, the UPZ will require 
beneficiation to produce a saleable product.

1.7.2 Mineral Reserves 

Mineral Reserves were estimated for the LPZ via a PFS commissioned by PHA that 
established economic viability for the Property.  Mining was not considered in the UPZ, although 
mining in the UPZ may be evaluated in the future.  A gridded-seam geologic model was 
combined with a room-and-pillar mine projection layout to develop timing maps, tonnage, and 
ore grade estimates for the eastern flat limb of the Property.  Table 1-3 summarizes the LPZ 
phosphate Mineral Reserves. 

Approximately 10 Mt of crushed phosphate rock concentrate averaging 29.4% P2O5 are 
projected to be mined and direct shipped without further processing.  The QP's have reviewed 
the PFS and consider it to be reasonable in its methodology and conclusions. 

The Mineral Reserves represent a mineable subset of the 22.3-Mt LPZ M&I Resource 
defined in the 26 March 2012 TR (AAI 2012a).  Since March 2012, the LPZ M&I Resource has 
expanded by approximately 7.5 Mt.  The additional M&I Resource will not be upgraded to a 
Mineral Reserve until the supporting FS is completed, which is currently expected to be at the 
end of 2012. 

1.7.3 Exploration Targets 

Table 1-4 summarizes the Exploration Targets for the Property. 

Insufficient exploration information is available to support the estimation of an NI 43-101 
Mineral Resource in the upturned limb of the Paris Syncline, although it is expected to contain 
significant mineralization.  Historical trenching along outcrop and historical test mining confirm 
the persistence of mineralization in the upturned limb; however, no exploration drill holes 
penetrate the upturned limb and no information is available at depth. 

While copious historic data exist for demonstrating the presence of mineralization in the 
VZ in the horizontal limb of the Paris Syncline, the quality of those data is substandard for 
application to NI 43-101 Mineral Resource estimation and all estimates of mineralization are 
classified as Exploration Targets until sufficient data can be acquired. 

 The Exploration Targets, as stated, are conceptual in nature and there has been 
insufficient exploration to define them as Mineral Resources, and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource under NI 43-101.  The 
Exploration Targets are not being reported as part of any Mineral Resource or Mineral 
Reserve. 

1.8  Conclusions  

 The Paris Hills Property contains significant phosphate mineralization in sufficient 
quantities and of sufficient grade to be attractive for mining under current market conditions, 
notwithstanding the risk inherent to proving and developing any mining property.  Vanadium 
represents upside mining potential.  Geologic continuity in the mineralized beds is strong 
throughout the Property.

 The Property is suited to underground mining because of the depth to mineralization.  
Limited mineralization near outcrop has the potential to be surface mined.  Room-and-pillar 
and/or longwall mining are considered the best prospective methods for mining the beds in the 
 

relatively flat-lying horizontal limb.  The upturned limb of the syncline is likely best suited to 
cut-and-fill mining, shrinkage stoping, or another similar method, considering its high-angle 
geometry and providing that geomechanical conditions prove favorable for economic extraction. 
 

PHA has developed a PFS which concludes that underground mining of the LPZ in the 
eastern limb of the Property is economic.  Table 1-5 summarizes the economic analysis for the 
project.

 Principal risks associated with developing the Property are geologic and market-side risk.  
Ground conditions during mining are anticipated to be similar to coal mining, which can vary 
considerably.  The phosphate material and surrounding strata are comprised of phosphorite, 
mudstones, shales, and limestones of varying strength and weatherability.  Potential exists for 
weak roof, rib, and/or floor conditions.  This can be exacerbated by groundwater.  Groundwater 
exists throughout the mining horizon and over much of the Property, and will be addressed 
through a series of dewatering wells.  While weak and wet conditions are not necessarily outside 
the range of ordinary bedded deposit mining conditions, risk arises from the potential for out-of-
seam rock diluting the LPZ DSO product.  Depending upon degree, dilution can result in lower 
product prices and exclusion from some markets unless beneficiation is incorporated. 
 
 Current assessment of the deposit shows characteristics well within market specifications 
for P2O5, minor element ratio (MER), and calcium oxide (CaO)/P2O5.  Fertilizer testing 
confirmed the ability to make DAP and MAP.  Blending to control quality parameters will likely 
be necessary to control specifications for a consistent product to the market.  
  

Deleterious trace elements, including uranium (U), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and 
cadmium (Cd), were preliminarily reviewed for possible effects to marketability and cost of 
mitigation.  Bed composite uranium levels in the LPZ vary between approximately 50 and 90

parts per million (ppm) and 60 and 100 ppm in the UPZ, which, even without beneficiation, are 
low by comparison with the Moroccan and domestic benchmarks which typically range between 
120 and 140 ppm.  Arsenic, selenium, and cadmium levels vary widely from well below to well 
above benchmark levels.  Where higher levels of these trace elements are encountered in the 
LPZ, the DSO phosphate rock may or may not incur some pricing penalty.  Beneficiation of the 
UPZ phosphate rock is expected to improve trace element levels. 

1.9  Recommendations 

   The LPZ warrants evaluation of the base case, direct ship, room-and-pillar mining 
scenario and associated tradeoffs at the FS level to advance the Paris Hills underground mine 
(the Project) to development.  In July 2012, Stonegate commissioned an FS of this scenario and 
its associated tradeoffs.  The FS is slated for completion in December 2012.  Recommendations 
for the FS and ongoing project development are as follows: 

 Geology/Exploration—Complete (1) a limited number of holes for improving structural 
definition in areas suspected of hosting faults and/or landslide features, (2) a limited 
number of infill exploration holes to elevate the remainder of the horizontal limb LPZ 
and UPZ to an M&I Resource, and (3) step-out drilling to define the eastern fault-bound 
limit of the deposit and western limit of the horizontal limb.  Between six and ten deeper 
holes to the north and two to four shallow holes to the southeast are suggested for 
improving geologic definition; however, none are considered critical for advancement of 
the Project through the FS.  Estimated cost is $1.5 to $2 million. 

 Seismic Surveying—Conduct a high-resolution 2D or three-dimensional (3D) seismic 
survey which is recommended for final mine design.  Estimated cost is $1.5 million to 
$2.0 million. 

 Geotechnical—Conduct 2D or 3D numerical modeling for finalizing mine design.  
Complete additional bulk density and in situ moisture testing of the LPZ and UPZ 
material.   Complete in situ stress measurements for characterizing stress conditions.  
Estimated cost is $30,000 to $100,000. 

 Mining Design and Equipment—Refine room-and-pillar mine plans.  Develop mine-
specific equipment requirements/modifications with manufacturers and obtain quotes.  
Conduct methane desorption testing.  Estimated cost is $400,000 to $500,000. 

 Processing—Conduct a second phase of fertilizer testing.  Estimated cost is up to 
$250,000. 

 Project Permitting and Regulatory Agencies—Proceed with environmental and other 
regulatory requirements, collect baseline data, and consult with key agencies.  Estimated 
cost is $1.5 million to $3.0 million. 

 Utilities—Establish rates for the FS.   

 Hydrogeologic, Groundwater, and Rock Geochemistry Analysis—Continue 
groundwater data collection, conduct pumping tests, install monitoring wells, develop a

water well injection plan, and refine the surface and groundwater balance.  Conduct a 
whole rock elemental analysis.  Estimated cost is $2 million to $3 million. 

 Marketing—Continue marketing development to refine and pinpoint marketing 
alternatives.  Estimated cost is $50,000 to $100,000. 

 Community and Government Relations—Continue to foster stakeholder support. 

 Risk Management—Develop a risk management plan and conduct a risk matrix 
analysis.  Estimated cost is $30,000 to $50,000. 

Total estimated cost of the recommended tasks ranges from $7 million to $11 million.    

Additional recommendations for exploration and development are identified below.   
These tasks are forward-looking and independent of the LPZ FS: 

 Upper Phosphate Zone—Complete a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) of 
room-and-pillar mining in the horizontal limb of the UPZ.  Estimated cost is $100,000 to 
$300,000. 

 Vanadium Zone—Analyze the VZ to evaluate the upside potential of V2O5 coproduction 
with phosphate mining.  Estimated cost is $30,000 to $100,000. 

 Upturned Limb Phosphate Resource Estimate—Conduct an exploration drilling 
program on the upturned limb and generate an NI 43-101 compliant TR resource estimate 
of the upturned limb.   Estimated cost is $1 million. 

 Northern Exploration—The phosphate resource remains open to the north at potentially 
mineable depths warranting exploration.  Numerical modeling is recommended for 
evaluating mining potential under deep cover exceeding 1,000 m.  Estimated exploration 
cost is $500,000 to $1 million. 

 Land—Continue with the acquisition of key properties needed for the surface facilities 
and infrastructure.  Estimated cost is $2.5 million to $3 million.

2.0   INTRODUCTION 

AAI was commissioned by Stonegate to provide an independent QP review and updated 
NI 43-101 TR for their subsidiary, PHA, on the wholly owned Paris Hills Phosphate Property 
located near the town of Bloomington in Bear Lake County, Idaho, USA.  This report 
incorporates information from an original NI 43-101 TR prepared for RMP and three subsequent 
NI 43-101 TRs prepared for Stonegate (AMEC 2010; AAI 2011; AAI 2012a).   

PHA acquired rights to the Property from RMP, a wholly owned subsidiary of RMP in 
November 2009.   

Stonegate completed an IPO on 28 April 2010, and currently trades on the Toronto stock 
exchange under the symbol ST.  

The purpose of this TR is two-fold:  (1) the Mineral Resource for the principal mining 
target, the LPZ, has been updated to include seven new exploration drill holes, and (2) a maiden 
Mineral Resource is stated for a secondary mining target, the UPZ, based on assay results in 29 
holes from exploration drilling program.   

 
Mineral Reserves for the LPZ were calculated for a detailed room-and-pillar mine plan 

documented in a PFS completed in March 2012 (AAI 2012b).  The Initial Project Capital3 (IPC) 
cost for the mine plan is $149.2 million.  During the IPC period, the maximum negative 
cumulative cash flow is $134.3 million, occurring in Project Year 2.  Revenues generated during 
the IPC total $232.5 million.  The Life-of-Project capital is estimated at $238.7 million.  The 
average life-of-mine operating cost is estimated at $72.99/t.  The net present value (NPV) of this 
cash flow pre-tax is $241.8 million and after-tax is $179.5 million, indicating an economically 
viable project.  The pre-tax internal rate of return (IRR) is 31% and the after-tax IRR is 27%.  
See Table 2-1 for cash flow assumptions used in the economic analysis.

The mining method employed will be room-and-pillar with partial pillar extraction, using 

heavy-duty coal-type continuous miners.  A dilution allowance for mine roof and floor dilution is 
included in the Reserve estimate.  The estimated mine life is 14 years with a total of 10 Mt run-
of-mine (ROM) ore produced. 
                                                           
3 Initial Project Capital (IPC) is the capital from start of construction until the last scheduled production unit is 
installed.  The IPC is from Project Year –2 to Project Year 3, a 5-year period.

The shipped product is ROM crushed phosphate rock concentrate (ore).  An independent 
market study was conducted by CRU Strategies (CRU).  CRU concludes that an assumed sales 
price of $160/t freight on board (FOB) shipping point for PHA phosphate rock would be 
appropriate. CRU also estimates transportation costs to potential customers would be 
approximately as follows:  by truck, Idaho $11/t; by truck to Montpelier, Idaho and then rail to 
USA west coast ports in Washington or Oregon $21/t; Edmonton, Alberta $31/t; Louisiana $47/t; 
and Florida $57/t. 

 
The LPZ room-and-pillar mine plan is being evaluated as part of a FS commissioned by 

Stonegate in July 2012.  The FS is anticipated for completion in December 2012.  The FS will 
incorporate additional resource and updated pricing information.

County.  The total area of the Property is approximately 1,008 ha (based on the Geographic 
Information System [GIS]) (Figure 4-2). 
 
4.1 Mineral and Surface Land Tenure 

4.1.1  Mineral Rights 

The Property consists of 3 patented lode mining claims and 21 contiguous fee parcels 
(some with federal mineral reservations) covering portions of Sections 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 21 
and 22 in T14S, R43E.  Taxes payable to the Bear Lake County Treasurer on patented lode 
mining claims and fee parcels are due annually by December 20th if paid in full, or the first half 
by December 20th and the second half by June 20th for the preceding tax year.  A complete listing 
of all patented mining claims and fee parcels under agreement is provided in Table 4-1.  Codes 
used in Table 4-1 are summarized in Tables 4-2 and 4-3. 

PHA provided a summary of legal agreements in effect on the Property.  

The Property is located within surveyed townships and boundaries using aliquot parts and 
private surveys of segregated fee parcels.  The State of Idaho maintains a Geographic Coordinate 
Database that is used for referencing and orienting parcel boundaries in Universal Transverse 
Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  The Property is located on the USGS Preston 1:100,000 scale 
topographic map and the USGS Paris 1:24,000 scale, 7.5 minute series quadrangle map.  It is

Idaho are within the Property boundary.  RMP's lease with ESI was transferred to PHA in 2009 
as described in the PHA and RMP Agreement Item below. 

 The federal phosphate lease was granted in consideration of an annual advance rental in 
the amount of approximately US$2.50 per hectare due the anniversary date each year the lease is 
in effect.  The federal phosphate lease is subject to the royalty provisions described in the 
subsection Phosphate Royalty Calculation.  Should the burden of the federal royalty and 
overriding ESI royalty cause PHA to abandon the lease prematurely or prevent mining of a 
marginally economic or low-grade deposit, the BLM may order ESI to suspend or reduce the 
overriding royalty to as low as 1%. 
 

On 29 October 2010, PHA applied for approval to drill on the federal phosphate lease.  In 
accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the BLM prepared an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) to analyze the proposed exploration plan, referred to as the 
Paris Hills Prospecting and Exploration Drilling Environmental Assessment (EA# DOI-BLM-
ID-I020-2011-0018-EA).  The BLM approved the exploration plan and granted permission to 
begin exploration drilling activities under the lease on 13 September 2011. 

Federal Prospecting Permit  

On 19 May 2008, RMP applied for a federal phosphate prospecting permit (IDI-036172) 
covering portions of Section 21, T14S, R43E (99 ha).  Upon issuance of a prospecting permit, 
the BLM must issue an EA or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prior to commencement 
of exploration activities.  Prospecting permits are granted in consideration of an escalating 
annual advance rental in the amount of US$0.50 per acre (approximately US$1.25 per ha), due 
the anniversary date each year the permit is in effect.  The permit may be converted to a non-
competitive mineral lease upon satisfactory showing of a valuable mineral during the life of the 
permit.  Upon issuance, the prospecting permit is effective for 2 years, but may be extended up to 
an additional 4 years at the discretion of the BLM.  The minimum bond amount required to hold 
a prospecting permit is US$1,000.  

If the prospecting permit is converted into a mineral lease, then a royalty is paid on all 
minerals mined and removed from those areas.  Royalty rates vary by commodity, and a 
description of the royalty calculation for phosphate and associated or related minerals is provided 
in the subsection Phosphate Royalty Calculation.  In deposits or zones where vanadium is

Agapito Associates, Inc. 

geologically classified within phosphate zones as an "associated or related mineral," federal 
royalty rates as applied to phosphate would also be calculated for vanadium.  In deposits or 
zones where vanadium is geologically independent of phosphate and has not been otherwise 
reserved, royalties to private mineral owners would apply.  

PHA acquired the rights to the federal phosphate prospecting permit application in 2009 
as described in the PHA and RMP Agreement Item below.  The BLM re-serialized the 
application as IDI-036773 and approved the prospecting permit effective 1 October 2011 for a 
period of 2 years.  

Federal Phosphate Exploration License  

On 7 June 2011, PHA applied for a federal exploration license (IDI-037055) to drill on a 
14.1-ha tract of BLM land in Section 21, T14S, R43E.  In accordance with NEPA, the BLM 
prepared an EA to analyze the environmental impacts of the proposed exploration plan.  The 
BLM approved the exploration plan and granted the exploration license effective 1 October 2011 
for a period of 2 years.  

Phosphate Royalty Calculation  

Both the federal government under the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR)4 
and State of Idaho use the formula in Table 4-4 for calculating phosphate lease production 
royalties, as codified at 43 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §3504.21 and published in the 
Solid Minerals Payor Handbook—Royalty Management Program (United States Department of 
the Interior [USDOI] 1997).  The "Unit Value" figure, provided annually by the ONRR, is 
multiplied by the percentage P2O5 and the 5% royalty rate to obtain the rate applicable to each 
dry short ton of ore shipped during any given month of production.  The current Unit Value 
(applicable through 01 August 2012) is $1.3505.

Idaho Exploration Permits  

On 30 June 2008, RMP was granted three exploration permits by the State of Idaho 
Department of Lands (IDL), covering portions of Sections 15, 16 and 22 in T14S, R43E.  The 
permits specifically provide for the mineral exploration of phosphate and metalliferous minerals 
(including silver, zinc, lead, nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, vanadium, gold and all other 
metalliferous minerals).  Each of the permits is granted in consideration of an annual permit fee

of US$500, due by January 31st of each year the permit is in effect.  According to the terms of 
the permits, the permits may be converted to preferential-right mineral leases upon satisfactory 
showing of an economic mineral resource of paying quality and quantity.  The IDL permits are 
due to expire on 31 December 2013.  

If the exploration permits are converted to mineral leases, then a royalty is paid on all 
minerals mined and removed from the permit areas.  Royalty rates vary by commodity, and a 
description of the royalty calculation for phosphate and associated or related minerals is provided 
in the subsection Phosphate Royalty Calculation.  Upon mineral lease conversion, rental fees can 
be used as a credit against production royalty during a given lease year.  

Ward Bros. Dairy Agreement  

On 9 August 2008, RMP entered into a mineral lease agreement for surface and mineral 
rights covering portions of Sections 9, 15 and 16 in T14S, R43E from Ward Bros. Dairy, an 
Idaho general partnership, for a series of annual payments as advances upon a 5.0% gross 
production royalty.  The payments and minimum expenditures required on the claims are shown 
in Table 4-5.  PHA acquired the rights to the Ward Bros. Dairy agreement in 2009 as described 
in the PHA and RMP Agreement Item below.  All payments under the agreement were current at 
the time this report was prepared. 

On an annualized basis, PHA has agreed to reimburse Ward Bros. Dairy for any damage 
to improvements on the property and if exploration activities prevent agricultural use of the 
surface.  The agreement also prohibits open pit and strip mining activities without the prior 
written consent of the owners.  

Ward Family Agreement  

On 9 August 2008, RMP entered into a mineral lease agreement for surface and mineral 
rights covering portions of Section 21, T14S, R43E for a series of annual payments as advances

4.2  Existing Environmental Liability 

The property position includes the former Bloomington Canyon Mine, Consolidated 
(Little Canyon) Mine and Paris Canyon (McIlwee) sites.  In 2002, the BLM, United States Forest 
Service, IDL, and Idaho Department of Environmental Protection (IDEP) jointly conducted a 
preliminary assessment and risk screening assessments for selected orphan mine sites, including 
the Bloomington Canyon Mine and Consolidated Mine locations.  The risk evaluation process 
consisted of reviewing the resulting site data in terms of site conditions, areas of impact, 



NI 43-101 Technical Report, Paris Hills Phosphate Project, Bloomington, Idaho, USA 
Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd. 
15 August 2012   Page 33

potential for continued releases and regional risk-based action.  The resulting recommendations 
were directed at addressing localized release pathways and associated ecologically sensitive 
risks, and addressing public safety concerns such as the presence of open adits, portals, or mine 
shafts.  A number of recommendations for the two sites were made for further sampling, site 
investigation, waste consolidation, erosion control and reclamation improvements.  

In 2004, the same working group conducted a follow-up assessment with respect to 
reclamation of the recommended sites from the 2002 assessment.  Additional recommendations 
for the Bloomington Canyon Mine and Consolidated Mine sites were made for grading, top 
soiling, seeding, adit closure, and clean-out of sediment at an estimated total cost of US$65,000.  
These activities have not yet commenced. 

PHA has assumed all, or portions of, the remaining reclamation liability associated with 
ongoing exploration activities.  RMP was bonded at US$30,000, which allows for drilling 
disturbance on the lands under the three exploration permits from IDL.  This bond was replaced 
by PHA upon reissuance of these permits to PHA by IDL.   

PHA is presently fully bonded under the approved exploration plan for disturbance on the 
federal phosphate-reserved lands.

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES,  
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

Access to the Property is provided by county-maintained roads in the canyons of 
Bloomington Creek and Paris Creek. These are all-weather roads that are cleared of snow 
throughout the winter.  From these roads, access onto the Property is gained via two-track 
unimproved trails, used primarily by ranchers to manage grazing of cattle.    

Bloomington Canyon Road and Paris Canyon Road both intersect with Rte 89, in the 
towns of Bloomington and Paris, respectively.  Paris is the oldest settlement in Bear Lake 
County and remains the county seat.    

5.2 Climate 

The climate in southeastern Idaho is influenced by topographic features and prevailing 
westerly winds from the Pacific Ocean.  Temperature and precipitation amounts are strongly 
dependent on elevation, with higher elevations experiencing lower temperatures and higher 
amounts of rain and snow.  In winter, although temperatures are moderated by Pacific Ocean air 
currents, temperatures can sink to less than –17.8 degrees Celsius (°C) for periods lasting several 
days.  Mean temperatures at the Property are expected to be similar to those at Conda, Idaho, 
which are reported to be around 10°C in summer and –5°C in winter.   

Snow cover usually begins in November or December and may stay until April or May.  
Freezing temperatures persist into May, and frost can occur any month of the year at elevations 
above 1,981 m.  Precipitation amounts range from 25 centimeters (cm) in Bear Lake Valley to 51 
to 76 cm over the Property, and up to 114 cm near the peaks of the Wasatch/Bear Lake Range.  
More than half of the precipitation falls between October and March, commonly in the form of 
snow, particularly at the higher elevations.  Thunderstorms are common and occur several days 
each month between June and August.  The growing season averages 80 days at Montpelier.    

These weather patterns are expected to limit field activities for exploration and 
development to the months of April through October.  Winter weather would also impact 
activities during any construction period for the project, but facilities would be designed for all-
weather operation and weather would be expected to have only minor impact on the ultimate 
mine operation.  

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Montpelier is 19 km north of Bloomington on Rte 89.  Montpelier is the largest 
population and commercial center in Bear Lake County.  In Montpelier, Rte 89 intersects with 
US Highway 30.  From this intersection, the driving distance to interstate highways is as follows: 
I-15 at McCammon, Idaho, 100 km; I-15 at Brigham City, Utah, 150 km; and I-80 at Green 
River, Wyoming, 160 km.  

Bear Lake County Regional Airport serves the general aviation needs of the local 
communities.  The airport is located between Paris and Montpelier.  Commercial air service is

available in Pocatello, Idaho and Idaho Falls, Idaho to the northwest, Jackson, Wyoming to the 
northeast, and Salt Lake City, Utah to the south.  

The UP provides freight services to Bear Lake County from an office located at 149 S. 
12th Street in Montpelier.  The track through Montpelier connects into the UP system at 
Pocatello, Idaho and Green River, Wyoming.  

Adequate surface rights have been obtained to support mining operations on the Property, 
in the form of the leases from ESI, the Ward Family, Ward Brothers Dairy, Thomas Ranch, and 
the Bee family, as well as exploration permits from the State of Idaho, as more fully described in 
Item 4 of this report.  Additional rights may be required for processing facilities, waste 
management, and infrastructure.  Additional work is required to more accurately identify these 
needs.  

Electric power for the Property is available through a 69-kilovolt (kV) PacifiCorp power 
line located approximately 2.4 km east of the town of Bloomington.  The power line runs north-
south along the Powerline Road which borders the west side of the Bear Lake National Wildlife 
Refuge.  PacifiCorp has indicated that there is sufficient power available to meet the estimated 
30-megavoltampere (MVA) power load estimated for an underground mine operation.    

Water rights in the Bear Lake Basin are fully subscribed.  Property water needs, 
encompassing mine, process and potable water will need to be secured through a purchase or 
exchange transaction with a local water rights holder.  

Experienced surface mining personnel are available in the immediate area.  Many local 
residents have worked in the phosphate mining and processing operations presently active 50 to 
65 km to the north in Soda Springs, Idaho.  

5.4 Physiography 

 The Property is perched in the foothills of the Bear River Range on the west side of Bear 
Lake Valley.  Elevation at the west side of the valley, below the Property, is between 1,815 m 
and 1,822 m.  The elevation rises abruptly from 1,966 m to 1,981 m, and the topography changes 
to gently rolling slopes across the Property.  The highest point on the Property lies to the 
northwest at just over 2,073 m elevation.  West of the Property, the elevation increases to high 
peaks exceeding 2,895 m elevation.  Paris Peak, at 2,918 m, lies 8 km west of the town of Paris.  

Canyons that bound the Property on the south (Bloomington) and north (Paris) are deeply 
incised, with walls rising steeply from the eponymous creeks to the project site above.  

 Predominant vegetation is of the mountain shrub type, with some grasslands at the lower 
elevations.

6.0    HISTORY 

6.1 Property and Ownership Changes  

 Portions of the following descriptions of land ownership  and exploration history were 
excerpted by AMEC (2010) and reproduced in this report from the USGS publication titled "A 
History of Phosphate Mining in Southeastern Idaho" by William H. Lee, located under USGS 
Open-File Report 00-425 (2000).  

6.2 Exploration and Development  

6.2.1 Paris Canyon/McIlwee Mine  

 On 6 November 1901, Margarette Grandi, widow of Pietro Grandi, received a homestead 
patent from the BLM GLO for the E½SE¼ of Section 8, T14S, R43E.  On 8 November 1913, 
Mrs. Grandi received another homestead patent from the GLO for adjacent acreage in Sections 8 
and 17.  These two contiguous patents formed what would become the Paris Canyon Mine.  

 In 1913, phosphate exploration work began in Paris Canyon on the northwestern portion 
of the current Property.  The first test shipments of phosphate occurred in the summer of 1915 to 
Los Angeles, California and to Anaconda, Montana.  

 In 1917, the Property was purchased by the Western Phosphate Mining and 
Manufacturing Company of Salt Lake City, Utah.  The mine became the second producing 
phosphate mine in Idaho with the first shipment of ore in October 1917.  This company 
reorganized in 1920 as the Western Phosphate Company under the leadership of James A. 
McIlwee, who was a significant shareholder.  It was about this time that the mine started to be 
called the McIlwee Mine.  Up to 1919, the mine produced an estimated 54,430 t of ore, and in 
1920, reports were made of a full trainload shipment of ore bound for Hawaii and Japan.    

 In 1921, the Western Phosphate Company filed for bankruptcy and as a result James A. 
McIlwee purchased the mine and formed a new company known as the Idaho Phosphate 
Company.  The name was later changed to the McIlwee Phosphate Company and, subsequently, 
the McIlwee Idaho Phosphate Company.  By 1925, total underground workings consisted of 
915 m of tunnels, drifts, winzes, and crosscuts.  In the intervening years, the company had 
installed a 270 tonne per day (tpd) mill, offices, a drying plant, living quarters for workers, and a 
railroad spur from the village of Paris.  The mine closed in 1926 as a result of a downturn in the 
phosphate market.  No estimates of total production are available.  

 The Property was leased to the Metals Reserve Company from 1942 to 1950 and then 
sold to L.W. McGann, the former president of the McIlwee Idaho Phosphate Company.  In 1973, 
the McGann holdings were sold to ESI.  

6.2.2 Consolidated/Little Canyon Mine  

 Historic work on the Property began with location of a claim in Little Canyon in 1903.  In 
1908, this original claim was replaced by three lode claims.  On 25 April 1908, three prospectors

named Joseph Oakey, G. W. Nebeker, and G. Spongberg located three lode mining claims.  
These three claims, Star Nos. 1, 2, and 3 were located for phosphate rock.  The locators sold the 
three lode mining claims to the United States Phosphate Company of Michigan in 1914 or early 
1915.  The company applied for a patent to the three claims on 1 May 1916, and received that 
patent on 20 July 1917.  The company was unsuccessful in mining phosphate from the claims, 
but did note the presence of vanadium in the phosphate rock.   

 The company transferred on 31 July 1922 by quit claim deed the three patented claims to 
Francis A. Jeffs.  In the latter part of 1930, Solar acquired the property by lease and option from

Jeffs.  Solar, (a subsidiary of Consolidated Mining and Smelting, Co. Ltd., of Trail, British 
Columbia, Canada) installed an inclined shaft 60 m deep and two lateral drifts with a total of 
1,066 m of underground work.  During the first 2 months of 1932, Solar shipped 3,175 t of 
phosphate ore to the Consolidated facility in Trail, Canada where it was converted to triple 
superphosphate (TSP) that was marketed as "Elephant Brand" fertilizer.  This was the last 
shipment of ore, and no record of total shipments is available.  The lease and option held by 
Solar was returned to Jeffs sometime around 1938.  

 The property was optioned to Wyodak in 1942 and was later acquired from remaining 
landowners by ESI in 1973.   

6.2.3 Bloomington Canyon Mine 

 Until the time of Wyodak's interest in the region, the property encompassing the 
Bloomington Canyon Mine was little explored or developed.  The property remained idle from 
1943 to 1961.  

 Ruby Company (J. R. Simplot Co.) applied for a competitive phosphate lease from the 
BLM in 1961.  A phosphate lease sale was held on 7 June 1962 with Ruby Company as the high 
bidder.  A phosphate lease, I-012982, was issued to Ruby Company on 1 July 1962 for Lot 4 and 
the SW¼SE¼ of Section 21, T14S, R43E.  Ruby Company did not develop the lease, and in 
1973 assigned the lease to ESI.  

 On 1 November 1984, ESI's federal phosphate lease was assigned to the Conda 
Partnership, an established phosphate mining company.  The Conda Partnership did no 
development on the federal lease in Bloomington Canyon and on 1 April 1993, assigned the 
lease back to ESI.  

6.2.4 Bear Lake Mine  

 On 17 December 1914, Walter H. Lewis applied to the GLO for an enlarged homestead 
entry for the NE¼SE¼ and S½SE¼ of Section 5 and the N½NE¼ and SE¼NE¼ of Section 8, 
T14S, R43E (97 ha).  Mr. Lewis gained a patent to the property on 1 September 1919.  The 
phosphate on this property was reserved to the USA.  

 Mr. Lewis contracted to sell his homesteaded lands to a new phosphate mining company 
called the Bear Lake Phosphate Company in 1920.  The same year, Congress passed and the 
President signed the Mineral Leasing Act (41 Statute 437) (BLM 2007), thereby creating a 
means to issue leases for the development and mining of federal phosphate and other minerals.  
The company made application to lease the federal phosphate lands upon passing of 
implementing regulations and the lease was granted on 21 February 1921, being the first federal 
phosphate lease issued in Idaho. 

 The property was sold in 1926 to Keystone Phosphate Company, which resulted in 
litigation regarding transfer of ownership and lack of payroll.  Subsequently, the fee property 
was transferred to Agricultural Potassium Phosphate Company of California and the federal lease 
was assigned to Mary Stucki.  The lease was terminated in 1938.

 Several prospecting permit applications were made in the intervening years between 1938 
and present.  None were issued, with the exception of a successful 1970 prospecting permit 
which was rejected upon application to convert to a preferential right lease in 1995 by ESI.  
While ESI apparently controlled property in the immediate vicinity of the historic Bear Lake 
Mine, this property is not part of the area presently controlled by PHA.  

6.2.5 Other Mines  

 Phosphate mining activity in the Montpelier Mining District of southeastern Idaho 
commenced in 1903 with location of claims at the site of the Waterloo Mine.  The Waterloo 
Mine site is located in Bear Lake County, approximately 6.4 km east of the town of Montpelier.  
The mine was operated sporadically by the San Francisco Chemical Company from 1904 until 
permanent closure in 1960.  Utilizing both underground and open pit methods, production is 
estimated at 1.1 Mt of phosphate ore during its 56-year life.  The Waterloo Mine was the first 
producer of phosphate from the Western Phosphate Fields of Idaho-Wyoming-Utah.  

 Other mines in the Montpelier Mining District, which produced small quantities of 
phosphate during the period 1910s through 1940s, include the Bennington Canyon Mine 4.8 km 
north of Montpelier, the Bear Lake Mine located in Sleight Canyon 3.2 km west of the town of 
Paris, and the Home Canyon Mine located in Montpelier Canyon just north of the Waterloo 
Mine.  The largest producer was the Home Canyon Mine with a total of 18,150 t of phosphate 
ore shipped.  

6.2.6 WWII and Renewed Interest in Vanadium  

 During World War II, interest in the Paris-Bloomington phosphate deposits was renewed 
as a potential source of vanadium.  Early work in the Consolidated and Paris Canyon Mines had 
noted the presence of vanadium in the phosphate beds.  Vanadium became an important strategic 
material supporting the war effort and Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes withdrew extensive 
areas of public land in the western phosphate deposits that contained vanadium.  The USGS 
began exploration in the Paris-Bloomington area in 1942.   

 In 1943, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) assigned the task of developing 
the vanadium deposit to its sub-agency, the Metals Reserve Company (MRC).  The MRC 
purchased 204 ha and leased another 576 ha in the area, and then contracted with Wyodak (a 
subsidiary of Homestake Mining Company) as the agent to conduct exploration, development, 
and operation.  Work was focused in Paris Canyon, Bloomington Canyon, and Little Canyon.  
During 1942 and 1943, Wyodak advanced nearly 760 m of underground workings:  Paris 
Canyon, 221 m; Consolidated Mine (Little Canyon), 152 m; and Bloomington Canyon, 366 m.  

 Extensive sampling work was conducted on the properties, and metallurgical work 
developed a process for extraction and recovery of vanadium from the deposit.  Work was 
stopped by MRC as the shortage of vanadium was satisfied from other sources.  

6.2.7 Earth Sciences, Inc. Work  

 During the 1970s, ESI assembled a project area of approximately 1,659 ha in Bear Lake 
County, Idaho, which apparently included the old Consolidated Mine, the Paris Canyon Mine,

the Bloomington Mine, and the Bear Lake Mine.  The property consisted of privately held 
phosphate leases, state mineral leases, federal leases, prospecting permits, or applications and fee 
holdings.  Note for clarity, the property that PHA presently controls is approximately 992 ha and 
is coincident with the southern portion of the former ESI property, where the phosphate and 
vanadium beds are closest to the surface and actually crop out in Bloomington Canyon, Little 
Canyon, and Paris Canyon.  

 In 1973 through 1977, ESI conducted exploration and development work on the property. 
Major work consisted of 47 rotary and core drill holes (Tables 6-1 and 6-2) and two underground 
workings.  Insufficient information is known to determine true thickness of the intercepted beds 
from drill holes.  No assay information has been found for 14 missing drill holes as indicated by 
gaps in the sequential drill hole numbering.  The missing drill holes are ESI-04, -06, -07, -09, 
-11, -12, -13, -14, -16, -17, -19, -20, -40, and -46.

beds.  Drill holes within the green circle are located on privately held land and are not subject to 
federal royalties for phosphate production. 

 Of the 34 drill holes completed, 14 have assays for both the UPZ and LPZ (beds), 19 
have assays for the UPZ, and 15 have assays for the LPZ.  Vanadium assays have been located 
for 20 of the 34 drill holes.

 In 1972, ESI drove a tunnel 46 m deep on an outcrop in Bloomington Canyon.  In 1973, 
the tunnel was extended to the west and north until a major fault was encountered at 
approximately 215 m from the portal.  An offset drift was driven 58 m east to intercept the VZ.  
Vertical samples from the ribs of the oolite and shale horizons were assayed for vanadium 
approximately every 3 m, and, at every 15 to 30 m, openings were extended into the upper 
lower-grade vanadium siltstone for sampling.  This 275 m working is known as the 1974 tunnel.  

 In 1975, 825 m of workings were driven in the Upper Phosphate Bed for bulk 
metallurgical testing.  Approximately 38,100 t of phosphate rock and waste were mined in a 
6-month period.  The purpose of the 1975 tunnel was to test various continuous mining 
machines, determine mining conditions, and provide bulk samples for testing.  

 Metallurgical testing was conducted by ESI from 1974 through 1977 to determine 
optimal processing methods.  This work led to various initial feasibility studies on processing 
schemes developed for producing a phosphate rock product as well as a vanadium product for 
sale.  Two different processing flowsheets were developed for the property: one for treating 
phosphate rock with minimal vanadium present and a second method for treating the feed with 
higher grade vanadium present.  A preliminary engineering design report was completed for the 
treatment of the phosphate rock.  An initial feasibility study was completed on the processing of 
the feed with higher grade vanadium present.  

A lot of 18,150 t of Bloomington phosphate rock from the underground bulk sampling 
was shipped to the Stauffer plant in Leefe, Wyoming for a bulk processing test.  The target was 
to produce 10,890 to 12,700 t of beneficiated calcined product for a production test at the 
Western Co-op Fertilizers Ltd. (WCFL) fertilizer plant in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada.  Early 
results from the Stauffer plant showed that the Bloomington rock caused the fluid bed roasters to 
overheat and the trial was suspended.    

 Figure 6-3 shows in plan view the extent of the 1974 and 1975 test mining. 

 ESI actively continued through the late-1970s, and much of the property package was 
held until the early 1990s before it was relinquished.  

 RMP became interested in the property in 2007.  With permission of the present land 
owners, the phosphate and vanadium beds in outcrop were sampled around the perimeter of the 
property.  By August 2008, RMP had assembled a property position comprising 856 ha which 
included the sites of the former Consolidated, Bloomington Canyon, and Paris Canyon Mines. 

 In September and October 2008, RMP completed six drill holes on the southern end of 
the property.  The purpose of the drilling was to confirm the results reported by ESI to form the 
basis for an NI 43-101 TR for the property.  The drill holes were completed using an RC rig.  
The drilling, sampling, and assaying procedures and results of the program are more fully 
described in subsequent items of this report.

6.3 Historical Reserve 

6.3.1 Historical Phosphate Reserves  

 In 1976, ESI reported phosphate reserves for the property.  ESI estimated that Measured, 
Indicated, and Inferred Reserves (MII) of the UPZ had an average grade of 25.2% P2O5 and an 
average thickness of 4.4 m.  The LPZ had an average MII grade of 30.4% P2O5 and an average 
thickness of 2.1 m.  The average P2O5 grade for the 276 Mt of MII is 26.8%.  Reserve was 
classified as Measured if it was within 400 m from the nearest drill hole.  Reserve was classified 
as Indicated if it was within 800 m, but more than 400 m from the nearest drill hole.  Inferred 
Reserves included all phosphates beneath the entire Paris-Bloomington property (1,659 ha), 
minus Proven and Probable Reserves.   

 The Paris-Bloomington property included 804 ha outside the RMP land holding.  A bulk 
density of 2.84 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) was used to calculate reserve tonnes.  The 
key assumptions of commodity price, metallurgical recovery, and operating costs used to derive 
these estimates were not documented to the extent that they could be verified by a QP as required 
under CIM Definition Standards of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2010), 
incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.  In addition, the equivalence of Reserve categories to the 
categories set forth by the CIM Definition Standards could not be adequately determined.   

 In 2010, AMEC reclassified all of the historical MII Reserves on the RMP land holding 
as Inferred Mineral Resources until sufficient confirmation drilling could be completed to verify 
historical drill hole intercepts and assays, and until appropriate feasibility studies could be 
undertaken to define reserves.  The historical phosphate reserve tonnages are listed in Table 6-2.  
The historical estimates are relevant only for the purpose of demonstrating a potential for 
phosphate mineralization on the Property.  A QP has not done sufficient work to classify 
the historical estimate as current Mineral Reserves and the historical estimates cannot be 
relied upon as if they were current Mineral Reserves.   

6.3.2 Historical Vanadium Reserves  

 In January of 1944, a historical vanadium reserve estimate was developed for the Paris 
property (equivalent to the current RMP land holdings) by Wyodak in conjunction with the 
USGS, USBM, and MRC (Walker 1944).  Proven Reserves were 0.5 Mt at 0.93% vanadium 
pentoxide (V2O5), Probable Reserves were 3.6 Mt at 0.90% V2O5, and Possible Reserves were 
45.4–63.5 Mt at 0.6–1.0% V2O5.  Table 6-3 lists the average V2O5 and P2O5 grade and thickness 
of the three vanadium-rich layers.  The key assumptions of commodity price, metallurgical 
recovery, and operating costs used to derive these estimates were not documented to the extent 
that they could be verified by a QP and they included the category of Possible Reserve that is not 
recognized under CIM Definition Standards of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2010), 
incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.  In addition, the equivalence of reserve categories to the 
categories set forth by the CIM Definition Standards could not be adequately determined.  
AMEC reclassified all of the historical Proven, Probable, and Possible (PPP) Reserves as 
Inferred Mineral Resources until sufficient confirmation drilling could be completed to verify 
historical drill hole intercepts and assays, and until appropriate feasibility studies could be 
undertaken to define reserves.  The historical estimates are relevant only for the purpose of 
demonstrating a potential for vanadium mineralization on the Property.  A QP has not

done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current Mineral Reserves and the 
historical estimates cannot be relied upon as if they were current Mineral Reserves.   

In 1977, ESI developed an historical reserve for the lower (shale or coaly-shale) 
vanadium bed (see Table 6-4).  ESI stated a Proven Reserve for the lower vanadium bed (1) in 
the horizontal limb of 4.9 Mt averaging 0.88% V2O5 (De Voto 1977) and (2) the upturned limb 
of 0.7 Mt averaging 1.27% V2O5, totaling 5.6 Mt averaging 0.93% V2O5.  The total historical 
PPP Reserve of the lower vanadium bed was stated to be 40.1 Mt throughout the 1,659 ha Paris-
Bloomington property.

ESI did not estimate vanadium grade for Probable or Possible Reserves.  A bulk density 
of 2.29 g/cm3 was used for tonnage calculations.  In the horizontal limb, the stated Proven 
Reserve was classified as within 305 m horizontally of a sample point (a drill hole, a trench, or 
underground workings) and to a depth of 152 m.  

The key assumptions of commodity price, metallurgical recovery, and operating costs 
used to derive the estimates were not documented to the extent that they could be verified by a 
QP and they included the category of Possible Reserve that is not allowed under CIM Standards 
on Mineral Resources and Reserves—Definitions and Guidelines (2010), incorporated by 
reference in NI 43-101.  In addition, the equivalence of reserve categories to the categories set 
forth by the CIM Definition Standards could not be adequately determined.  AMEC reclassified 
all of the historical reserves on the RMP land holding as Inferred Mineral Resources until 
sufficient confirmation drilling could be completed to verify historical drill hole intercepts and 
assays, and until appropriate feasibility studies could be undertaken to define reserves.  The

historical estimates are relevant only for the purpose of demonstrating a potential for 
vanadium mineralization on the Property.  A QP has not done sufficient work to classify 
the historical estimate as current Mineral Reserves and the historical estimates cannot be 
relied upon as if they were current Mineral Reserves.

7.0   GEOLOGIC SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

Phosphate and vanadium-rich mineralized beds occur in the horizontal and upturned to 
upturned limb of the Paris Syncline.  The mineralized beds plunge northwest between 12° and 
20° along the west-dipping, north-plunging horizontal limb of the syncline.  The horizontal limb 
contains the principal resource target and additional mineralization is contained in the steeply 
dipping, upturned to upturned limb of the syncline.  The mineralization is hosted in the Meade 
Peak Member of the Permian Phosphoria Formation which is currently mined in open pits 50 km 
to the north near Soda Springs by the three major Idaho phosphate producers.  The PHA 
phosphate is of similar character to that being mined at Soda Springs.   

The Property is located near the center of the Western Phosphate Field which constitutes 
the most extensive phosphorite beds in the USA (McKelvey et al. 1959) and extends across 
Montana, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming (Service 1966).  The geological setting and mineralization 
is summarized by AMEC (2010), in AAI (2011), and again in this document.   

The target phosphate mineralization is contained in two zones (beds), the UPZ and LPZ, 
which range in depth from outcrop to more than 1,000 m deep.  Vanadium is contained in a zone 
located immediately below the UPZ.  Mineralization in the upturned limb has a strike length of 
over 3 km on the Property. 

7.1  Regional Stratigraphy 

Phosphate beds of the Western Phosphate Field occur within the Meade Peak Member of 
the Permian Phosphoria Formation (Richards and Mansfield 1912).  The Phosphoria Formation 
consists of a chert-mudstone-phosphorite facies in eastern Idaho and southwestern Montana 
(Service 1966).  These beds intertongue with a sandstone facies towards the northeast and a 
carbonate facies toward the east and south, the Permian-Pennsylvanian Grandeur Tongue and 
Wells Formation, respectively.  Further to the east and south the interval is represented by red 
bed facies dominant in eastern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado (McKelvey et al. 1967).  

 The Phosphoria sediments of southeastern Idaho were deposited in the Cordilleran 
geosyncline under marine conditions.  The distribution of the Meade Peak Member and its 
shoalward facies suggests that it was deposited in a large ocean embayment similar to the present 
Arabian Sea (McKelvey et al. 1959, p. 25).  The various facies of the formation were largely 
determined by water depth, and exhibit systematic facies changes.  From west to east or from 
deepest to shallowest water, the principal sequence is black mudstone, dark dolomite and 
phosphorite, chert, limestone, and sandstone.  Phosphatic beds and associated black shales of the 
Meade Peak Member in southeastern Idaho are representative of the intermediate facies.  
Shallower water chert beds comprise the upper Rex Chert Member of the Phosphoria Formation 
(Sheldon, Maughan, and Cressman 1967).  The rock sequence from the upper part of the 
Pennsylvanian Wells Formation to the middle of the Rex Chert Member of the Phosphoria 
Formation in southeastern Idaho represents a nearly complete cycle of marine transgression and 
regression (McKelvey et al. 1967, p. 17) and forms regionally continuous deposits in both areal 
extent and thickness.   

 Phosphate abundance in the Phosphoria Formation of the Western Phosphate Field is 
more than six times greater than that in the sea today (Sheldon 1989).  Increased sedimentation

and deposition of phosphorite and organic matter in the Phosphoria Formation formed as 
upwelling of nutrient-rich waters in the Phosphoria Sea resulted in high rates of biotal 
productivity (Sheldon, Maughan, and Cressman 1967; Sheldon 1989).  

7.2 Regional Structure 

  The Phosphoria Formation of the Western Phosphate Field outcrops along a series of 
imbricate thrusts in an area tens of kilometers wide within the Rocky Mountain Fold- and 
Thrust-Belt (Armstrong and Oriel 1965 and Figure 7-1). The thrust-belt extends from southern 
Montana into northern Utah and ranges from late Jurassic to early Cretaceous in age.  The thrusts 
are progressively younger from west to east and the upper plates of the thrusts moved to the 
northeast.  Continued compressional forces acting in the same direction as the original thrusting 
folded the thrust surfaces into a series of sub-parallel north-northwest trending anticlines and 
synclines.  During later stages of Laramide deformation, the thrusts were cut by east-trending 
steeply dipping tear faults.  Extensive block faulting associated with basin and range deformation 
during Tertiary time formed the north-trending graben valleys in southeastern Idaho and adjacent 
parts of Utah and Wyoming.  The Property is located along the west side of the Bear Lake 
Graben and is bounded on the west by a segment of the Paris Thrust.  
 
7.3 Property Geology 

A generalized geologic map of the Property is shown in Figure 7-2 (McKelvey and 
Strobell 1955, Sheet 1) as modified by PHA.  

7.3.1 Stratigraphy 

Lithologic units present within the Property are described below and are shown in the 
stratigraphic section illustrated in Figure 7-3.  

Qal Quaternary alluvium includes unconsolidated boulder conglomerate, gravels, 
sand, landslide debris and shallow soil of Quaternary to Recent age.  These 
deposits unconformably overlie all older units at various localities throughout 
the Property.  Thicknesses range from a few feet to over 60 m in places.  

Trd The Dinwoody Formation is Triassic in age and, as observed from drill 
cuttings, is predominantly medium-gray siltstone.  The Dinwoody Formation 
is absent due to erosion immediately north of Bloomington Canyon and 
progressively increases in thickness northward and westward into the axis of 
the Paris Syncline. The thickness can be over 600 m, but is generally about 
200–275 m. 

Ppr The Rex Chert Member of the Permian Phosphoria Formation is 
predominantly dark gray to black chert in unoxidized drill cuttings and brown 
to gray chert in the outcrop.  The Rex Chert Member conformably overlies the 
Meade Peak Member of the Phosphoria Formation. The chert locally forms 
resistant outcrops at the head of Little Canyon and both south and north of the 
Paris Mine at Paris Canyon.  The Rex Chert is missing from the extreme 
southeastern part of the Property because of pre-Tertiary erosion.  The normal

 Rex Chert section averages about 76 m thick where penetrated by both ESI 
and RMP drill holes. 

Ppm The Meade Peak Member of the Phosphoria Formation includes black locally 
carbonaceous and petroliferous mudstone, phosphorite and black shale with 
minor chert and limestone.  Within the Property, it averages about 60 m in 
thickness and includes two high-grade phosphate beds along with a persistent 
vanadiferous shale horizon.  The Meade Peak Member is poorly exposed in 
outcrop because of recessive weathering of the relatively non-resistant shale 
beds.  Frequently, chert fragments derived from erosion of the overlying Rex 
Chert also obscure Meade Peak Member outcrops.  The Meade Peak Member 
locally overlies the Grandeur Tongue of the Park City Formation and the 
Wells Formation with apparent conformity observed from drill hole 
penetrations within the Property. 

PPw The Pennsylvanian Wells Formation consists of sandstone, red beds and 
carbonate beneath the Grandeur Tongue Member (PPg) of the Park City 
Formation.  The upper siliceous limestone rocks that make up the Grandeur 
Tongue Member were formerly assigned to the upper part of the Wells 
Formation (McKelvey, et al. 1959).  The Wells Formation crops out in Little 
Canyon where it weathers to a yellowish color and forms semi-resistant 
outcrops.  Where observed in drill cuttings, the upper 6 m of the formation is 
mostly light gray siliceous limestone to yellowish to white calcareous 
siltstone. 

7.3.2   Structure 

 Structure of the Property is dominated by the north-trending Paris Syncline (Service 
1966).  The western upturned to steeply dipping limb is exposed immediately east of the Paris 
Thrust.  The eastern limb is gently west-dipping to horizontal and extends into the subsurface 
beneath most of the Property.  The horizontal limb of the Paris Syncline plunges about 15° north 
as shown in Figure 7-4 and dips about 12° west as shown in Figure 7-5. 

The steeply dipping upturned limb crops out in Little Canyon and strikes north where it is 
well exposed south and north of Paris Creek.  Locally, the upturned limb exposes the Meade 
Peak Member of the Phosphoria Formation.  The Consolidated Mine in Little Canyon and the 
Paris Mine along Paris Creek were developed in phosphate beds of the upturned limb.  The 
brittle Rex Chert is shattered adjacent to the upturned limb where observed in outcrop in Little 
Canyon and on both sides of Paris Canyon.  

The eastern limit of the Property is defined by a series of north-trending normal faults 
that comprise the western margin of the Bear Lake Valley graben.  This fault zone is largely 
covered by landslide debris and down-slope wash.  Structurally the fault zone defines the eastern 
limit of potentially economic beds of phosphate and vanadium which are progressively down-
dropped to the east.  

Other structural elements include the steeply dipping, east- to southeast-trending 
Consolidated Fault and the northeast-trending Spring Wash Fault (Figure 7-2).  These faults are

likely tear faults developed during thrust-related deformation.  Beds of the horizontal limb are 
significantly offset by these faults and produce significant displacement of a portion of the north-
trending upturned limb of the Paris Syncline.  

 Several small faults with displacement of a few meters were observed in workings during 
ESI's mining in the horizontal limb immediately north of Bloomington Canyon.  These small 
faults generally trend easterly and appear to decrease in frequency eastward away from the 
upturned limb of the Paris Syncline.  

7.3.3 Mineralization 

 Phosphorite is a general term for sedimentary rock containing significant amounts of 
phosphate minerals as well as other constituents such as quartz, feldspar, clay minerals and 
organic matter.  Guldbrandsen (1967) provides a description of the mineral composition of 
phosphorites from the Phosphoria Formation.  Fluorapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, is the primary phosphate 
mineral.  Principal elemental substitutions within the fluorapatite crystal lattice are sodium (Na), 
strontium (Sr), uranium (U), thorium (Th), and rare earths for calcium (Ca); carbon trioxide 
(CO3) and sulfate (SO4) can substitute for phosphate (PO4).   

At PHA, three stratiform-bedded zones within the Meade Peak Member of the 
Phosphoria Formation are of potential economic interest.  These are from top to bottom:  

 Upper Phosphate Zone (UPZ) occurs approximately 3 m below the contact with the Rex 
Chert.  Based on historical evaluation of outcrops, trenches, underground workings and 
drill penetrations, this bed averages about 4.6 m thick and averages between 21% and 
25% P2O5.  

 Vanadium Zone (VZ) (three beds) which lies immediately below the UPZ and, based on 
historical reports, averages between 3.4 and 3.8 m thick with an average V2O5 grade of 
0.74% to 0.92%.  The vanadiferous zone includes three lithologic types with different 
vanadium grades.  Pertinent information for each bed is summarized in Table 7-1.  

 Lower Phosphate Zone (LPZ) occurs about 1.5 m above the Meade Peak contact with 
the underlying Wells Formation and approximately 50 m below the VZ.  This bed ranges 
1.1–2.9 m thick and averages overall about 25.0% P2O5.   Resource grades were subject 
to a cutoff of greater than or equal to 24% resulting in much higher average grade 
(Item 14).

The vanadiferous zone averages about 13% P2O5 based on ESI's drill results.  

In addition to the three beds described above, there are significant intervals ranging from 
3 to 15 m thick, which average 10% to 15% P2O5, located between the VZ and the LPZ. 

The mineralized beds described above occur in both the upturned limb and the horizontal 
limb of the Paris Syncline.  Grades and thicknesses in both the upturned limb and the horizontal 
limb of the anticline are similar, although improvement in grade is noted in areas where the 
phosphorite has been weathered.  This is largely due to driving off contaminants such as calcium 
carbonate in the weathering process, thereby concentrating grade.  That process may be by 
chemical or mechanical means and may occur due to areal and sub-areal exposure and faulting. 

The majority of the mineralization occurs in the horizontal limb which underlies most of 
the Property.  Continuity of mineralization in both limbs of the Paris Syncline is anticipated to be 
good based on depositional environment and widespread mining of phosphate beds of the Meade 
Peak Member in southeastern Idaho, western Wyoming, and northeastern Utah.  Within the 
southern one-third of the Property, drill hole penetrations have generally verified continuity of 
both grade and thickness of the three primary mineralized zones.  

Variations between adjacent drill intercepts are likely more influenced by a combination 
of structural complications than from primary sedimentary concentrations of P2O5 and V2O5.  

Mineralization in the upturned limb has a strike length of over 3.2 km and extends from 
the surface to a depth exceeding 300 m, depending on location along the north-trending strike of 
outcrops.  Depths of the horizontal limb range from surface along the north side of Bloomington 
Canyon to estimated depths of 915 to 1,035 m at Paris Canyon. 

Elemental substitutions within the fluorapatite crystal lattice may represent deleterious 
material or, where in sufficient concentration, might be recovered as a byproduct.  Deleterious 
trace elements, including uranium, arsenic, selenium, and cadmium, were preliminarily reviewed 
for possible effects to marketability and cost of mitigation.  Trace element assays performed by 
ALS laboratories were examined in 16 early exploration holes in the southern part of the 
Property.  Notably, the ALS assay values for P2O5 and the primary oxides were later rejected 
during the exploration program for excessive measurement bias.  In spite of this, ALS' assays 
remain the principal source of trace element data and are considered meaningful for 
characterizing order-of-magnitude levels of trace elements in the phosphorite beds until 
additional testing can be completed. 

Uranium and its radionuclide of concern, radium (Ra), do not have an impact on the 
ability to transform phosphate rock into fertilizers, but concern exists about potential health 
hazards during the manufacture of the fertilizer and, particularly, its byproducts.  Radium mainly 
reports to the phosphogypsum byproduct of fertilizer production and can be a significant gamma 
radiation source.  Acceptable uranium limits vary throughout the market.  Morocco, the largest 
international exporter, produces phosphate rock with uranium levels on the order of 120 ppm.  
US mines produce rock with uranium levels on the order of 140 ppm.  At Paris Hills, bed 
composite uranium levels in the LPZ vary between approximately 50 and 90 ppm and 60 and 
100 ppm in the UPZ, which, even without beneficiation, are low by comparison with the 
Moroccan and domestic benchmarks.

Arsenic limits are variable.  High-purity igneous deposits in Russia and Finland typically 
range between 3 and 5 ppm, while the most commonly consumed rock concentrates range 
between 10 and 15 ppm.  A 20-ppm arsenic limit is considered readily acceptable.  Arsenic 
levels in the DSO LPZ rock vary between approximately 7 and 40 ppm.  Composite arsenic 
levels in the UPZ range between approximately 10 and 70 ppm and may reduce considerably 
with beneficiation. 

Phosphate rock is desirable at cadmium levels typically less than 50 ppm.  Cadmium 
levels in the LPZ range between approximately 5 and 130 ppm and 50 and 215 ppm in the UPZ.   

Selenium is a primary issue with Western US phosphate rock mining where the selenium 
is hosted in the overburden and can become mobile due to oxidation when exposed to air.  
Selenium levels less than 10 ppm are considered readily acceptable in marketed rock and 
typically range between 1 and 5 ppm.  Igneous deposits typically fall below 2 ppm, whereas 
sedimentary deposits can range as high as 9 ppm, such as Tunisia Gafsa rock.  Moroccan 
phosphate rock selenium levels are typically in the 4 to 5 ppm range, which is considered the 
typical benchmark acceptance level.  Selenium levels in the LPZ range between approximately 2 
and 65 ppm and 4 and 110 ppm in the UPZ.   

Where higher levels of arsenic, cadmium, and selenium are encountered in the LPZ, the 
DSO phosphate rock may or may not incur some pricing penalty.  Beneficiation of the UPZ 
phosphate rock is expected to improve trace element levels. 

7.4 Hydrogeology 
 
 Groundwater data for the Project are available from a site-specific study and from 
regional sources.  A preliminary hydrogeologic investigation for the project was completed in 
2011 by Whetstone, details of which may be found in the PFS (AAI 2012b).  Hydrogeologic 
information specific to the geology has been summarized here.  The study involved packer 
permeability testing and installation of VWPs in four exploration boreholes:  PA020, PA070, 
PA117 and PA162.  VWPs were installed in three additional exploration boreholes during the 
first half of 2012:  PA106A, PA142, and PA184.  Groundwater monitor well drilling is currently 
in progress.  The regional hydrogeologic setting of the Southeast Idaho Phosphate District has 
been described in numerous reports, most notably Ralston et al. (1977, 1980, and 1983); Winter 
(1980); and Whetstone (2003 and 2009).  

The groundwater model was prepared in two parts:  an initial steady-state model to 
simulate the pre-mining groundwater flow system and a transient model to simulate time-
dependent dewatering requirements as a function of mine development.  The model domain 
encompassed an area of 46 square kilometers (km2) in and around the Project area. 

7.4.1 Regional Hydrogeologic Framework  

 Groundwater flows from recharge areas at higher elevations discharging in areas at lower 
elevations.  Intermediate- to regional-scale groundwater flow systems occur in all bedrock units 
at PHA with the exception of the Tertiary Wasatch and the Triassic Thaynes Limestone 
Formations and the Meade Peak Member of the Phosphoria Formation.  The Wasatch Formation 
and Thaynes Limestone are of limited areal extent and thickness, and do not have the potential to

host significant groundwater systems at the Project.  The Meade Peak Member is a regional 
aquitard, and except where faulted or fractured, separates regional groundwater flow in the Wells 
Formation from intermediate-scale groundwater systems in the overlying units (Ralston et al. 
1977; Winter 1980). 

 The Triassic Dinwoody Formation is water-bearing in the Project area and typically 
supports groundwater flow systems with short- to intermediate-length flow paths.  Groundwater 
also occurs in the Rex Chert and can be moderately to highly permeable over a widespread area 
(Whetstone 2003 and 2009).  Regional hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storage data 
for the Dinwoody Formation and Rex Chert are summarized in Table 7-2.

 The Wells Formation occurs below the potential mining horizon in the LPZ and is a 
regional-scale aquifer that participates in inter-basin transfers of groundwater (Ralston et al. 
1977 and 1983; Winter 1980).  Groundwater in the Wells Formation may be confined in the case 
where it is capped by the Meade Peak Member or unconfined, where in proximity to outcrop or 
where the Meade Peak is absent or fractured.  Flow is primarily parallel to bedding planes.  
Permeability perpendicular to bedding is much lower.

Data in Table 7-2 indicate that permeability varies widely in bedrock, typical of fracture 
flow systems.  By removing bias that may have been present in well testing (Whetstone 2009; 
Arcadis 2010), numerical modeling of groundwater flow in the region suggests an average 
hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-6 centimeters per second (cm/sec), for the Meade Peak Member. 

7.4.2 Hydrogeologic Characteristics of Project Area 

 Depth to groundwater in the Project area ranges from about 50 to 270 m below ground 
surface (bgs).  VWP data indicate a northwesterly flow direction with an approximate gradient of 
0.023 to 0.056 in the Rex Chert and 0.003 to 0.005 in the Wells Formation.  On the southern side 
of the Consolidated Fault, relatively high downward vertical gradients exist between the Rex 
Chert and the Wells Formation (1.1 meter per meter [m/m] at PA020 and 0.77 m/m at PA117). 
These gradients suggest that the Meade Peak Member has low vertical hydraulic conductivity 
and that the Consolidated Fault is a barrier to lateral groundwater flow.  On the northern side of 
the Consolidated Fault, vertical gradients are lower (0.03 m/m at PA070 and 0.10 m/m at PA162) 
and suggest that the Meade Peak Member may have higher permeability in this area, possibly 
due to fracturing.

8.0   DEPOSIT TYPES 

The Permian Phosphoria Formation within the Western Phosphate Field (Richards and 
Mansfield 1912; McKelvey and Carswell 1956; Service 1966) contains phosphate, vanadium, 
and associated trace metals that formed within a shallow and restricted basin (up to 300 m deep) 
named the Phosphoria Sea off the western coast of the Pangea continent approximately 250 
million years ago (Hein 2004).   

Phosphate- and vanadium-rich beds were derived from detritus of organic matter 
produced during coastal upwelling, which accumulated on the basin floor without being diluted 
by carbonates and/or terrigenous deposition (Hein 2004).  It is believed that low relief and an 
arid climate to the east minimized input of terrigenous sediments, and that water temperature and 
oceanic conditions prohibited formation of marine carbonates (Hein 2004).  Most known world 
reserves of phosphate are believed to be sedimentary marine. 

Depositional conditions of the Meade Peak Member produced bedded deposits 
characterized by continuity of grade over large distances.  Marine phosphate deposits are known 
for their large size and the Meade Peak Member has been mapped for a distance of greater than 
200 km. 

Various other metals including selenium, zinc, silver, uranium, and molybdenum occur at 
anomalous levels within the Meade Peak Member.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

Drilling, gamma logging, geochemical sampling, and outcrop measurements are utilized 
in exploration and investigation of the mineral deposits.  Evaluation of this Property has been 
accomplished by:  

 Review of published literature  

 Review of historical exploration results including work done by the USGS, state agency 
reports, and private company reports, primarily ESI and RMP 

 Review of the AMEC (2010) NI 43-101 TR on Stonegate's Paris Hills Phosphate Project 
Idaho, USA, 1 February and data used in that report 

 Seismic analysis of 2D seismic trade lines purchased by PHA 

 Exploration drilling with downhole gamma surveying conducted by PHA from 
September 2010 to June 2012 

 Chemical analyses on core samples by commercial laboratories  

 Analyses and check of assay results 

Drilling and resulting assay work are the bulk of contemporary exploration work and are 
described in detail in Items 10 and 11. 

Available historical data, while conforming to industry standards consistent with the time 
it was generated, are not acceptable for use in this resource evaluation.  Drill hole intercepts, 
trenching samples, and assay results generated from historical data used by AMEC (2010) were 
reviewed but could not be independently confirmed.  A detailed explanation of that data is found 
in AMEC (2010), AAI (2011), and is highlighted in Item 6.2 of this report.  The larger dataset 
included 47 holes drilled and assayed by ESI in the 1970s.  Twenty-two of those holes penetrated 
the Meade Peak Member and were utilized by RMP.  In addition to the drill holes, ESI drove two 
tunnels and collected trench samples.  Assays of drill holes, tunnel, and trench samples were 
mostly performed in-house and were not confirmed by Certificates of Analysis.  RMP rotary-
drilled six confirmation holes offset to ESI holes in 2008; only two penetrated the UPZ and LPZ.  
Historic drilling and trenching by ESI and RMP are shown in Figure 9-1.  

 In its Inferred Mineral Resource estimate, AMEC (2010) located and used assay and 
sample results for 17 historic drill holes as well as trench and adit assay results.  Those data are 
not used to evaluate this resource; however, they provide useful constraints for understanding the 
subsurface geologic structure and for planning new drill holes.   

PHA acquired the holdings from RMP in September 2009 which included the interests to 
all Mineral Lease Agreements, rights to the State of Idaho exploration permits, a federal lease, 
and rights to a federal prospecting permit application.  Since acquiring these holdings, PHA has 
secured the transfer of the Mineral Lease Agreements and the State of Idaho has reissued these 
exploration permits.  An exploration program was filed with the BLM and the State of Idaho on 
29 October 2010 (Stone 2010).  In that program, 62 drill holes, for a combined total of 22,021 m, 
were proposed on BLM-owned property.

PHA applied for approval to drill on the federal phosphate lease and was granted 
permission in September 2011.  PHA applied for and was granted approval for a federal 
prospecting permit and a federal exploration license in October 2011.  Also, PHA entered into 
five Mineral Lease Agreements expanding the original RMP property boundary in 2011 and 
2012.  See Item 4.1—Mineral Surface and Land Tenure for details. 

PHA commenced a drilling program in September 2010 and continued to drill and assay 
through 10 November 2011 for reporting in AAI (2011) and through 10 February 2012 for AAI 
(2012a).  This report includes drilling and assay data to 19 July 2012.   

To estimate an M&I NI 43-101 compliant resource, PHA has drilled to delineate the 
phosphate mineralization within the Property boundary.  AAI recommended a drilling spacing of 
0.4 km for Measured and 0.8 km for Indicated Resources in areas of the eastern horizontal limb.  
Closer-spaced drilling was recommended in the vicinity of suspected faults, the upturned 
(upturned) limb, and at the southern boundary of the Property, which is desired for local 
structural definition.  Initial exploration plans and recommendations set out by AMEC (2010) 
were to set drill hole spacings between 150 m and 300 m.   

PHA's exploration plans going forward include infill and step-out drilling to upgrade 
remaining Inferred portions of the LPZ and UPZ in the horizontal limb to M&I, and drilling 
along the western margin of the deposit to define the LPZ and UPZ Mineral Resources contained 
in the upturned limb.  The upturned limb is presently identified as an Exploration Target.  

9.1 Seismic 

Five trade seismic lines were acquired for reprocessing to assist in interpretation of 
regional structure (see Figure 9-2).  Boyd reprocessed 2D seismic trade lines, one on a north-
south line and four on east-west lines.  Structure on top of the Rex Chert Member, LPZ, and the 
Wells Formation was mapped and tied into historical fault trends.  The preliminary analysis 
confirms the structural dip of the strata previously identified from the drill holes and shows 
various faults crossing the Property, including major normal faults which bound the deposit near 
the eastern property line.  The age and the quality of the raw data preclude detailed depth or 
structural mapping. 

9.2 Gamma Logging 

 After drilling was completed for each hole, downhole profiles of gamma radiation were 
obtained with a Mount Sopris 5MXA-1000-120 Matrix Logger with a 2PGA Poly Gamma probe.  
Depending on hole depth, either a 500-m cable winch or a 1,000-m cable winch was used to 
lower the probe.  Gamma emissions in counts per second (cps) were recorded as the probe was 
lowered through the drill pipe from the top of the hole to below the base of the Meade Peak 
Member.  Natural gamma radiation occurs as the result of radioactive decay of uranium.  Studies 
have shown a close correspondence of uranium to apatite concentrations in the Phosphoria 
Formation (Hale 1967).  This relationship was reportedly due to uranium within the apatite, 
substituting for calcium, rather than concentration in the matrix.  At PHA, gamma logs provide 
distinctive signatures for the UPZ and LPZ as well as other lithological changes and marker 
beds.      The gamma log profiles provide a means to consistently correct drillers' depths, identify

representative sample ranges, and to identify lithological and structural variations across the 
Property area.  Figure 9-3 shows gamma profiles in cps for two example drill holes.  Holes 
PA103 and PA 105A highlight the use of gamma to define various intervals within the Meade 
Peak Member on the Property. 

9.3 Sampling 

Within the core warehouse, the geologist determined the core sample intervals to be  
approximately 0.3 m.  Five early drill holes were core sampled at intervals greater than that; the 
largest sample interval was 0.6 m.  

Each sample was carefully marked and double-checked by a senior geologist.  Individual 
marked samples were removed from the core box, shrink-wrapped in plastic (to hold the softer, 
more fractured segments together), and cut wet with a masonry core saw.  Core samples were 
placed in plastic bags with appropriate sample identification for shipment to the assay laboratory.  
The samples were typically half core with the other half left in the core box for reference.  If the

sample was too soft or fragmented to cut, the whole core was sent; in that case, the laboratory's 
first split was placed back into the core box for reference.  If a core duplicate was required then 
the core was quartered.  Dry core cutting had been done with a rotary tool, resulting in excessive 
breakage of the core.  Wet core cutting methods replaced the dry methods to assist in holding the 
core together.  The dry core cutting procedure was completed on eleven LPZ resource holes. 

A pre-determined quantity of QA/QC samples (standard reference materials [SRMs], 
blank materials, duplicates and secondary lab checks) was included with each batch of samples. 

All samples were documented with proper chain-of-custody and security-sealed before 
shipment to the assay laboratories.  Upon delivery and return, the chain-of-custody documents 
were signed by both site and laboratory personnel unless the samples were sent by commercial 
means.  In that case, the commercial chain-of-custody procedures were used.  The samples were 
sent to two phosphate industry-recognized laboratories for analysis:  EnviroChem in Pocatello, 
Idaho and Thornton in Tampa, Florida.  Sample preparation was completed only by 
EnviroChem. 

Analytical results from the assay laboratories were reported electronically to senior 
personnel in both spreadsheet form and a secure Assay Certificate form.  The results were 
combined with the gamma log adjusted drill hole intervals and transferred to a master database 
that was managed by a qualified technical person.  All QA/QC results were checked; if the 
established criteria were not met, then the entire batch was reanalyzed. 

Initially, samples were sent to ALS for sample preparation in their Elko, Nevada facility 
and then to Vancouver, British Columbia for assay.  After review of the PHA inserted standards, 
it was decided the assay results from ALS would be discarded and samples would be submitted 
for reanalysis at new laboratories. 

9.4 Survey 

A designated person arranged for the survey of all drill hole collar locations and 
downhole deviations.  

A.A. Hudson and Associates, an Idaho-licensed Professional Land Surveyor (PLS), 
surveyed the hole locations and elevations.  Hole northing and easting locations are NAD83 
UTM Zone 12 coordinates in meters.  Elevations are North American Vertical Datum of 1988 
(NAVD88), also in meters. 

Major ran a single-shot, downhole survey tool to determine hole deviation below the 
casing, and a geophysical logging contractor, International Directional Services (IDS) used a 
gyroscopic deviation survey tool within the cased portion of the holes.  Three of the deeper holes 
in the northern portion of the Property were surveyed exclusively by IDS.  This practice is 
ongoing with all deep holes.  Downhole survey deviations were not obtained for five drill holes, 
and the holes were assumed to be vertical.

10.0 DRILLING 

Drilling was contracted to Major for both RC and core drilling activities.  Drilling for the 
PHA project commenced on 23 September 2010 with Major with a 24-hour, 7-day-per-week 
schedule.  Due to wet conditions during the spring thaw and resulting difficulty accessing the 
drill hole locations, drilling was temporarily suspended in 2011 and 2012 for a few weeks in 
March and April.   Exploration drilling on the federally controlled (BLM) portion of the Property 
occurred in October and November 2011 following approval by BLM and issue of exploration 
permits.  Groundwater monitor drilling commenced in June 2012 and is ongoing.  

The early drilling campaign achieved poor core recovery and produced incomplete 
datasets.  This was later addressed with the introduction of strict QA/QC protocols and 
procedures.  If core recovery was less than targeted, holes were re-drilled.  All holes were 
re-logged, re-measured, and depth-corrected to gamma geophysical logs. Where previous 
sampling made reconstruction difficult or impossible, photographic records were reviewed to 
determine core recovery. 

After drilling resumed in spring 2011, all coring was by split-tube methods and a 
geologist was present at the drill site during coring at all times.  The split-tube coring and the 
on-site presence of geologist staff resulted in accurate recovery and rock quality designation 
(RQD) measurements as well as improved core description and handling procedures.   

PHA implemented a drilling incentive based on core recovery rather than footage, 
resulting in improved recovery.  The larger PQ-3 core also resulted in improved recovery and 
provided a larger core for sampling and test work; consequently, it became the primary core size.  
HQ-3 was used for specialty testing (hydrological) or where depth restrictions dictated.  Solid-
tube methods were no longer used.  

Table 10-1 summarizes all 85 PHA exploration holes drilled between September 2010 
and 17 July 2012.  Seven new exploration core holes were completed since drilling results were 
previously reported in the 26 March 2012 TR:  PA106A, PA142A, PA159, PA165, PA171, 
PA183, and PA184.  The drill hole locations are shown in Figure 10-1. 

The criteria for exploration holes used in the resource estimate are (1) greater than 90% 
core recovery through the phosphate zone of interest and (2) assays completed by one of the two 
reliable, independent, and industry-recognized laboratories.  The idealized 90% core recovery 
criterion was later lowered to 85% as a practical response to difficult drilling conditions so that 
critical information from two holes in the UPZ and four holes in the LPZ could be included in 
the resource estimate.   

Of the 85 holes drilled, 39 holes satisfied core recovery and assay criteria and were used 
in the resource estimate for the LPZ.  In addition, LPZ thickness was estimated from the gamma 
and core logs of a fortieth hole, PA159, and that thickness was used in the geologic model, 
although core recovery was inadequate for assay.  Twenty-nine holes were used for the resource 
estimate of the UPZ.  Fourteen drill holes were lost due to difficult ground conditions.  Holes 
used in the resource estimates are identified in Table 10-1.

Tables 10-2 and 10-3 describe the total RC and core footages of holes used in the LPZ 
and UPZ resource estimates.  The tables also account for the remainder of holes excluded from 
the resource estimate.  The "Drill Hole Status" in the tables indicates the reason for exclusion. 

A total of 85 holes comprising 17,579 m of RC and 8,405 m of core have been drilled by 
PHA.  The LPZ resource is based on 39 holes which produced 5,674 m of core. The UPZ 
resource is based on 29 holes which produced 4,693 m of core.  Most holes used in the resource 
encountered both the UPZ and LPZ, although the UPZ was not always sampled.  A total of 24 
holes contributed to both the UPZ and LPZ resource estimates.

10.1 Reverse-Circulation Drilling 

 The type of rotary RC rig used on the property was a Schramm T685WS.  There were up 
to two rigs drilling concurrently during the exploration program. 

RC is a method of drilling that conveys cuttings to the surface through the inside of the 
drill rods.  At PHA, this method was used for drilling a hole through the upper formations with 
pre-collars (temporary casing) prior to coring with a wireline coring rig through the lower 
formations.  Casing sizes depended on the size of the subsequent desired core diameter size, 
either HQ or PQ.  HWT casing, with an 11.4-cm outer diameter and 10.2-cm inner diameter, was 
installed for HQ, and PWT casing, with a 14-cm outer diameter and 12.7-cm inner diameter, was 
installed for PQ core.  The diameter of the hole is nominally 5.1 cm greater than the outer 
diameter of the casing. 

Samples of the RC cuttings (rock chips) were caught in a sieve.  After each 3.1-m 
advance, the drill crew transferred a representative portion of the cuttings from the sieve to a 
chip tray.  Chips that remained in the sieve were discarded and the sieve was placed back into the 
cuttings discharge stream.  The chip tray is a plastic box with 20 compartments, each measuring 
approximately 2.5 cm wide × 5.0 cm long × 3.0 cm high.  A filled chip tray represents 61 m of 
RC drilling.  The RC chip samples were monitored by a geologist to note any compositional and 
structural variations, clast and grain-size distributions, formation contacts, and to determine the 
depth at which RC drilling should stop.  Typically, this was at or near the top of the Meade Peak 
Member.  Filled chip trays were transferred by the geologist from the drill site to the PHA office 
where the chips were logged.  Each 3-m interval was carefully reviewed and described with 
notes on any visible structural details (e.g., slicken lines, veining, etc.).  A microscope was used 
to assist with the detailed observations. 

RC drilling was occasionally used to determine the extent of the deposit boundaries along 
erosional features.  These features were referred to as subcrop holes. 

10.2 Wireline Diamond Bit Core Drilling 

 Three different wireline core rigs were used on the Property including a Boart-Longyear 
LF 90, LF140, and LF 230.

Two methods of wireline core drilling have been used for the Project: solid-tube and 
split-tube.  The nominal core and hole diameters are listed in Table 10-4. 

 

Table 10-4.  Core and Hole Diameters    

Core Bit  Core Diameter     
(mm [inches]) 

Hole Diameter   
(mm [inches]) 

Method 

HQ 63.5 (2.5) 96.1 (3.8) solid-tube 
HQ-3 61.1 (2.4) 96.1 (3.8) split-tube 
PQ-3 83.0 (3.3) 122.6 (4.8) split-tube 

 

 Both solid- and split-tube coring are accomplished using an outer core barrel (drill pipe) 
with a diamond bit on the end.  For solid-tube coring, a single solid core tube is lowered to the 
bottom of the core barrel where it locks into place to receive the core.  With split-tube coring, the 
core tube has an inner split tube (hence, smaller diameter core).  As the drill pipe is rotated, the 
bit cuts the rock so that a cylindrical core of rock feeds into the core tube.  The core tube is either 
1.5 m or 3 m long.  After the completion of a core run, an overshot is lowered on a wireline cable 
though the drill pipe to retrieve the core tube.  After the overshot attaches, the core tube is pulled 
from the hole.  

 Drill hole locations were selected based on accessibility and then by resource sphere of 
influence.  The size, capability, and availability of rigs determined drilling order, with larger rigs 
used for deeper drilling in the northern part of the Property.  

10.3 Current Exploration Procedures 

The drilling targeted two high-grade phosphate horizons (UPZ and LPZ) within the 
Meade Peak Member of the Permian Phosphoria Formation.  Typically, RC methods were used 
to the base of the Rex Chert Member and then core methods were used through the Meade Peak 
Member where samples were obtained from the UPZ and LPZ.  The UPZ lies near the top of the 
Meade Peak Member, from approximately 1 to 6 m below the Rex Chert contact.  The LPZ lies 
near the base of the Meade Peak Member separated from the UPZ by approximately 58 m.  
Coring is completed approximately 6.1 m into the underlying Permo-Pennsylvanian Wells 
Formation. 

RC cuttings were collected on 3-m intervals for logging throughout the upper formations.  
Core was sampled for assay approximately 3 m above and 3 m below the UPZ and 
approximately 3 m above and 1.5 m below the LPZ.  Coring was done in either 1.5-m or 3-m 
runs and sampled at 0.3-m intervals or less, respecting geology boundaries.  Coring was 
completed using either solid-tube or split-tube core barrels, with the latter being the preferred 
and current method because of improved RQD. 

 Initially, HQ (solid-tube) diameter core was used for all drilling.  In January 2011, the 
larger PQ-3 (split-tube) diameter core was introduced for geotechnical sampling and logging 
purposes.  The PQ-3 resulted in improved core recovery and provided a bigger sample for 
assaying and test work.  Since January 2011, all holes were drilled with PQ-3 core unless drilling 
depths dictated that split-tube HQ-3 is used.  When PQ-3 or HQ-3 core tube was brought to the

surface, the inner split core tube was hydraulically extruded from the outer core tube.  One-half 
of the split tube was removed and the driller's helper delivered the other half with the core to the 
geologist. 

The geologist (with help from a geo-technician) verified the cored intervals, determined 
the core recovery and RQD, photographed the core in the split tube, logged the core's geology 
and geotechnical characteristics.  The core was placed into a plastic sleeve, transferred to core 
boxes, labeled and transported to the core warehouse.  The core warehouse is a secured facility 
and locked when not in use.  The geologist was also tasked with preparing a daily report, calling 
the drill hole for completion, and was present at the core rig for all drilling operations. 

After the core drilling was completed, the geologist logged the hole with a gamma ray 
logging tool.  Gamma log profiles were compared to drilling depths, and assay results and depths 
were adjusted to the gamma log if necessary. 

Solid-tube core handling procedures were different from split tube.  The driller's helper 
placed the core in the core boxes directly from the solid-tube core barrel and labeled the core 
boxes with drill footages and core run intervals.  The boxes were kept at the drill site under 
supervision of the driller until they were delivered to the core warehouse by either a Major or 
PHA employee.  The solid-tube method resulted in additional mechanical breaking of the core, 
resulting in a poorer RQD.  Photography and determinations of core recovery and RQD were 
done in the core box.  The geologist was not always present at the drill rig during drilling 
operations.  

 Drilling was planned in two phases to be completed on approximately 304.8-m centers 
and infill drilling at approximate 152-m centers.  Drilling was completed from surface to the top 
of the Meade Peak Member by RC and followed by core drilling in HQ (63.5-millimeter [mm] 
core diameter).  HQ coring was initially used for all core that was to be assayed for resource 
estimation.  In January 2011, PQ-3 (split-tube with 83.0-mm core diameter) was added for 
geotechnical sampling and logging.  Because of improved core recovery and quality with PQ-3 
core, subsequent resource definition holes were also drilled with PQ or PQ-3.  HQ-3 (split tube 
with 61.1-mm core diameter) coring was used for hydrogeological and PQ-3 for metallurgical 
testing.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS, AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling 

The geologist (or geo-technician) supervised the collection of all core at the drill site and 
the transfer of the core boxes to the core warehouse following chain-of-custody procedures.  The 
core warehouse is located in the yard of the PHA office in Bloomington, Idaho.   

During the sampling process, the geologist referred to core recovery, gamma log and 
descriptive core logs to mark sample intervals through the UPZ and LPZ, then made corrections 
to core logs as necessary.  The core to be sampled was photographed in the core box with sample 
markers in place.  Sample books with preprinted sample numbers were used to record the 
project, hole number, date, sample interval, a brief soil/rock description, and the appropriate 
sample suffix.  A sample suffix was provided for each sample to track the type of sample and to 
designate how it should be processed at the laboratory.  The following suffix codes were 
assigned: 

 A—Pulp:  Sample for analysis only, crushing and grinding not necessary. Also used for 
QA/QC standard material pulps. 

 B—Coarse Reject:  Already crushed from previous sample preparation, grinding is 
needed to produce pulp.  Also used for QA/QC quartz and blank sample. 

 C—Quarter Core:  Required crushing and grinding to produce pulp sample.  Used for 
duplicate core samples.  Remaining half core was retained in the core box. 

 D—Half Core:  Required crushing and grinding to produce pulp sample.  Remaining half 
core was retained in the core box. 

 E—Whole Core:  Required crushing and grinding to produce pulp.  Used for sampling of 
soft or fractured core impossible to cut into half core.  No core was retained in the core 
box, but the first split coarse reject was placed back in the core box when returned from 
the laboratory. 

 Sampling proceeded with the following steps: 

1. A preprinted sample number tag was chosen for each core sample and the tag placed 
inside the sample bag.  This sample number was then written on the sample bag.  Note 
that the sample number is unique and independent of the drill hole identification or drill 
hole intervals.   

2. QA/QC blanks and standards were put in appropriately tagged and labeled sample bags. 

3. Whole core "E" designated samples were placed in appropriately tagged and labeled 
sample bags. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report, Paris Hills Phosphate Project, Bloomington, Idaho, USA 
Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd. 
15 August 2012   Page 73

4. Core samples designated as "C" or "D" were shrink-wrapped in plastic, then wet cut with 
a masonry saw.  Either quarter- or half-core samples were placed in the appropriately 
tagged and labeled sample bags. 

All of the bagged samples were laid out in numerical order and the chain-of-custody form 
was checked as each sample was placed in a grain sack.  A uniquely numbered security zip tie 
was immediately placed on each grain sack.  The security seal number was recorded on the 
chain-of-custody form.  The security seal remained in place until it was checked and removed at 
the laboratory. 

11.2 Sample Preparation and Assaying 

Initial assay samples from the drilling program were processed by ALS in Canada with 
sample preparation carried out at ALS in Elko, Nevada from November 2010 to May 2011.  
Following a review of ALS' assay results against the PHA inserted SRM and check assays at 
Jacobs laboratory, it was determined that ALS analysis showed high bias in samples with higher 
P2O5 percentages (greater than 30%).  The SRM run through the ALS lab reported uniform, but 
unacceptably higher grades (+1.8% P2O5) than the certified grade, particularly in samples of high 
P2O5 percentages (greater than 30%).  This review showed consistency, but not precision, 
suggesting calibration issues.  ALS was not prepared to investigate further or re-test without 
additional compensation, so the alternate laboratories were selected. 

While ALS was not audited, there was no reason to believe that sample preparation was 
flawed or contaminated in any way.  ALS has a documented sample preparation procedure.  This 
point is critical as the ALS pulps from holes that met the criteria for inclusion in the resource 
model were re-assayed by the new laboratories.  All related blank material was re-assayed by the 
new laboratories and showed no contamination. 

The SRM submitted was a Florida phosphate rock (AFPC Check #22).  The blank 
material submitted was construction silica sand with only trace amounts of P2O5.  In later testing, 
a Western US phosphate rock SRM (694) was introduced to use with Check #22.  Additional 
blank material was also introduced in the QA/QC program and consisted of foundry silica sand 
and coarse crystalline quartz.  

EnviroChem and Thornton are both independent of the issuer under the criteria set forth 
by NI 43-101. 

Initially neither laboratory was named as the primary laboratory for the P2O5 analysis, but 
a very high percentage of duplicates between the two were completed.  Total assayed samples 
(not including standards, checks, duplicates and blanks) were 32% duplication overall and 
approximately 60% duplication within the LPZ.  Testing and re-testing was almost exclusively 
in, above, and below the LPZ.  The results of the testing showed agreement between the two 
laboratories with high accuracy and precision.  Where testing was in duplicate, results were 
averaged for use in the resource model.

 EnviroChem was tasked with all sample preparation and P2O5 analysis.  A flow diagram 
of the sample preparation method is shown in Figure 11-1.  EnviroChem has a documented 
Quality Assurance Plan.  Determination of P2O5 percentages was made using the Association of 
Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Quimociac gravimetric method.

Following testing at EnviroChem, samples were sent to Thornton for assay.  The 
methodology for P2O5 determination was colorimetric.  Thornton also tested and reported for 
metal oxides (CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, Na2O, K2O), acid insoluble, and organic matter as 
carbon (C).  Thornton is recognized as an independent referee and control testing laboratory for 
all types of fertilizer analyses and certification.  Thornton uses approved Association of Fertilizer 
and Phosphate Chemists (AFPC) methodologies and is a member of AFPC and AOAC. 

Following the March 2012 PFS, Envirochem was designated the primary lab and Jacobs 
as the secondary lab.  This was largely due to Envirochem's proximity to the project site and 
quicker assay turnaround time, and not due to quality issues with Thornton.  Jacobs performed 
duplicate testing at a rate of 5%.

11.3 Quality Assurance/Quality Control Program 

 Shortly after the assay results were received from the laboratory, they were combined 
with the drill hole intervals (gamma log adjusted) to create an assay database.  These results were 
copied from the laboratory spreadsheets to the assay database matching the unique sample 
identifiers from the drill hole intervals to the unique sample identifiers from the laboratory.  The 
database was checked for data entry errors against the laboratory's assay certificates. 

Once the assay database was created, the data were reviewed for quality assurance for all 
SRMs, blanks, duplicates, and secondary laboratory checks.  

 Based on a review of the exploration program, the QPs are confident that early problems 
of core recovery, sampling, and assay bias have been resolved and that the exploration dataset 
used in this resource estimate meets the criteria for use under NI 43-101.  PHA's QA/QC 
program is designed with aggressive duplication and insertion.  Procedures are well documented 
and have been followed accordingly.  An additional independent audit was conducted by AAI on 
a witnessed drilled core in January 2012. 

 The QA/QC insertion rates and monitoring criterion for P2O5 are shown in Table 11-2.

Results of the P2O5 analysis met or exceeded the planned insertion rates and monitoring 
criteria.  PHA's QA/QC program was designed with aggressive duplication and insertion.  In 
actuality, the insertion rate for the holes used in the resource model was much higher.  In general, 
insertion for each zone (LPZ and UPZ) was two blanks, two SRMs, and two core duplicates.  

Results were also verified by the laboratories according to their own internal procedures, 
including additional insertion of SMRs and duplicates. 

All results were monitored as soon as they were received and checked against control 
charts for laboratory precision and bias.  If any of the above quality control analysis failed the 
criteria established, then the laboratory was notified immediately and the entire laboratory batch 
was reanalyzed. New results were sent to the PHA senior staff and the entire procedure was 
repeated. 

Three types of blank material with very low amounts of P2O5 were inserted into the assay 
program to monitor contamination during sample preparation.  These included (1) a silica 
construction sand purchased at a local hardware store, (2) a silica sand purchased from a foundry 
in Salt Lake City, Utah, and (3) a coarse quartz material purchased from a mine in Arkansas.  
The silica construction sand was used during ALS' sample preparation and the foundry silica 
sand and coarse quartz material were used during EnviroChem's sample preparation.  The blank 
materials were each sent to three different phosphate industry-recognized labs in Florida for 
round-robin analysis.  This analysis showed trace P2O5 amounts and confirmed their use as a 
blank material.  Monitoring of the blanks showed no significant contamination occurred during 
sample preparation. 

Figures 11-2 through 11-5 show control charts for the two laboratories with the Florida

Figure 11-6 compares Thornton to EnviroChem check pulp duplicate pairs for P2O5 in the 
LPZ and the lower-grade bounding roof and floor material.  The duplicate tracking demonstrates 
strong agreement between laboratories. 

Figure 11-7 shows generally good agreement between the core reject duplicates from 
Thornton and EnviroChem, with the exception of approximately 3% of duplicates falling 
substantially outside the ±10% tolerance.  The outliers were introduced as a result of testing 
completed between March and June 2012.  No outliers of significance existed prior to June 2012.  
Stonegate is investigating the outlier anomalies.  The reliability of testing is not considered 
compromised by the small proportion of outliers. 

Figures 11-8 and 11-9 show good agreement between the Thornton-EnviroChem 
duplicate pairs for the coarse reject and pulp duplicates, respectively. 

Analysis was also completed for metal oxides (CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, Na2O, K2O), 
acid insoluble, and organic matter as carbon (C) for further characterization of the phosphate 
beds.  This analysis was only done at Thornton with no secondary lab checks.  Monitoring 
procedures were the same as P2O5, except the criteria for monitoring was relaxed from the 
"certified mean value ±2 × standard deviations" to the "certified mean value ±3 × standard 
deviations."  If no certified values existed, then the average mean values were compared to each 
other and reviewed for outliers.  

 It was noted by Thornton that SRM694 did not follow AFPC methods during its 
certification.  A round-robin analysis was completed for CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 for this 
SRM by three phosphate industry-recognized labs in Florida to determine if adjustment to the 
mean values and standard deviations was needed for monitoring.  After reviewing the round-
robin results, adjustments to the certified values were made for Fe2O3 and Al2O3 only.  No round-
robin analysis was completed for K2O or Na2O.  Results for Na2O met the QC criteria; however, 
the results for K2O showed a low bias.  It is likely that this bias is due to the difference between 
the method used for SRM694 during certification and the AFPC method.  This assumption is 
valid based on similar adjustments made to Fe2O3 and Al2O3.  As such, K2O results were not 
compared to certified values; only the average mean values were compared to each other and 
reviewed for outliers. 

 Results for Na2O showed a low bias compared to the SRM-22.  The bias was explained 
by Thornton as follows: PHA submitted the SRM694 (Western US phosphate rock) as an 
external QC sample since it best matches the matrix of the PHA samples.  As such, all results 
were "drift" corrected (via instrument software) to match the value ranges of SRM694.  This 
correction was done across all compounds analyzed (CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, Na2O, K2O) at 
the same time; individual corrections were not done.  As a result of this overall correction, a low 
bias was realized for SRM-22. 

Organic carbon testing revealed a systematic low bias in results from Jacobs.  A total of 
44 samples were sent to Jacobs as secondary lab checks on the primary lab (EnviroChem) 
between February and June 2012.  An additional 21 samples were tested at Jacobs in July 2012.  
Four of the samples and SRM694 were also tested at Thornton in July 2012 for comparison 
between all three labs.  Comparative testing revealed that Jacobs systematically under-

reported organic carbon content when a 0.4-gram (g) aliquot was tested due to incomplete carbon 
activation during titration.  Jacobs achieved results consistent with EnviroChem and Thornton 
when the aliquot was reduced from 0.4 to 0.1 g, thereby increasing the ratio of potassium 
dichromate to carbon and improving carbon activation.  Consequently, Jacobs' organic content 
measurements were excluded from the resource model.   

Organic content in the resource model is based exclusively on measurements from 
Thornton and EnviroChem.  Limited comparative data indicate small to moderate differences 
between Thornton and EnviroChem, particularly at higher organic contents (above 4%).  
Although both labs operate within AFPC tolerances and satisfy SRM checks at lower organic 
carbon contents (typically less than 1.7%), procedural differences are thought to be responsible 
for the spread of results between labs at higher organic contents.  Results from both labs are 
considered valid and applicable for resource estimation and are used in the resource model.  
Stonegate is conducting a detailed evaluation of lab procedures and industry practice to identify 
the preferred method of testing, if any. 

All other results passed the criteria described above. 

11.3.1 Densities 

Independent density testing was completed by AAI and Jacobs.  Average bulk density 
in situ for the LPZ was 2.6 t/m3 on a dry basis.  There were 36 dry and 62 wet bulk density tests.  
For the dry density lab results, a statistical variation of 2.58% ±0.31 in the 95% confidence level 
was reported.  Test results were reviewed and showed good agreement.  AAI maintained 
complete chain-of-custody documentation. 

11.3.2  Chain of Custody 

 In early stages of the drilling campaign, the documented chain of custody was weak, but 
now it is well documented.  Drill core was transferred from the drill site to the core warehouse 
according to the chain-of-custody procedure.  The core warehouse is located within the Property 
and has limited access and is locked when there is no activity.  Samples were always in the 
control of PHA employees, contractors, or service companies paid to transport or process the 
samples.  Chain-of-custody documentation was prepared before transport to the laboratories for 
each dispatch of samples or pulps and when archiving core to the warehouse. 

11.3.3  Adequacy 

 The QPs are confident that procedures for sample preparation, security, and analysis for 
assays used in this resource estimate meet the criteria for use under NI 43-101.  Audit and 
observation showed procedures are being followed by technical and administrative staff.

12.0  DATA VERIFICATION 

Site visits were made to the PHA location by QPs Leo Gilbride and Vanessa Santos.  Leo 
Gilbride visited the location on 6–7 January and 23–25 May 2011.  Vanessa Santos visited the 
location on 23–27 May, 5–8 July, 29–30 August 2011, and 20–22 July 2012.  Vanessa Santos 
also visited the current laboratories to confirm testing procedures and industry-recognized good 
practice.  Assay data from the master database supplied to AAI were checked at random against 
Certificates of Analysis with 100% agreement.  An independent audit of a drilled core was 
performed in January 2012 by AAI. 

12.1 Historical Data 

AAI was supplied digital (scanned) and hard copies of available historical data, including 
select assays from ESI's 1970s drilling, trenching, and test mining sampling program and RMP's 
six confirmation rotary holes from September and October 2008.  While copious historical data 
exist, the quality of those data is substandard for application to NI 43-101 compliant Mineral 
Resource estimation. 

ESI and RMP typically reported RC sample intervals ranging from 0.6 to 1.5 m long, or 
greater, resulting in the introduction of oftentimes significant out-of-seam dilution into the 
samples representing the zones of interest.  This was reflected in the generally lower grades and 
thicker beds reported by ESI and RMP.  Although the historical RC results confirm 
mineralization and provide useful structural information, the data cannot be resolved to quantify 
the higher grade portion of the zones sought for base case mining. 

Concern also existed with the reliability of the RMP and ESI data.  No blank standards 
were used and only limited check assays were submitted by ESI.  ESI submitted SRMs; 
however, no certifications for the standards could be located.  In the absence of certifications, it 
is not possible to identify potential assay bias.  Notably, SRMs revealed significant bias with 
ALS' assays during the initial phase of PHA's 2011 exploration program.  Corrective action was 
required.  The ESI historical records showed excessive variability in the P2O5 standard assay 
results (high standard deviations), indicating unreliable laboratory precision. 

Duplicate P2O5 results from ESI's laboratory were available for 66 samples.  The QPs 
considered that good precision has been maintained if 90% of the pulp duplicates agreed within 
±10% (pair difference divided by pair mean).  Only 48% of the ESI duplicates met the ±10% 
criterion.  By comparison, 97.4% of PHA's 231 EnviroChem-Thornton P2O5 duplicates from the 
2011–2012 drilling campaign satisfied the ±10% criterion.  The disparity detracts from the 
reliability of the historical ESI data. 

It is the opinion of the QPs that the historical data are unreliable for NI 43-101 resource 
estimation.  The QPs consider the historical data reliable for indicating the qualitative presence 
of mineralization, demonstrating geologic continuity, and for use in structural modeling. 

12.2 Current Exploration 

AAI reviewed all data from the current exploration program used in this resource 
estimate.  A high standard of integrity was required in view of early problems with core

Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd. 
15 August 2012   Page 84 
 

Agapito Associates, Inc. 

recovery, sampling, and laboratory assay bias.  In this case, data was included only if core 
recovery was greater than 85%, and in many cases, recovery was greater than 95%.  An original 
90% core recovery threshold was later lowered to 85% as a practical response to difficult drilling 
conditions so that critical information from several holes could be included in the resource 
estimate.  All holes were re-logged, re-measured, and corrected to gamma geophysical logs.  
Where previous sampling made reconstruction difficult or impossible, photographic records were 
reviewed to determine core recovery.   

All ALS testing for phosphate was rejected due to over-reporting of P2O5 in the samples 
and standards.  Pulps of approved holes were submitted to EnviroChem and Thornton with 
aggressive insertion of standards, laboratory duplicates, pulp duplicates, and coarse reject 
duplicates as well as blanks.  In both cases, the assaying compared well within and between the 
laboratories. 

12.3 Site Visits 

Multiple site visits were made by AAI to review the project parameters and procedures.  
These visits included trips to the drill rig, field and surrounding areas, core warehouse, and 
administrative offices.  The QPs observed fresh core on the drill rig, observed field logging by 
PHA geologists, and examined boxed core in PHA's storage facility to confirm log records.  
Random selections of core were examined and confirmed in multiple holes.  Extensive 
interviews were conducted with technical, administrative and senior personnel, including 
consultants to the project.  Procedures and protocol were reviewed and refined until they 
conformed to industry standards of best practice.   

12.3.1 Site Reviews 

 12.3.1.1  AAI's January 2011 Site Review—AAI's initial visit to the Property was in 
January 2011.  At that time, AAI reviewed exploration activities and existing drill cores.  Based 
on those discussions, AAI recommended revision of drilling density for M&I classifications to 
be 0.4 km for Measured and 0.8 km for Indicated Resources in areas of the eastern horizontal 
limb.  Closer-spaced drilling was recommended in the vicinity of faults, the upturned limb, and 
at the southern boundary of the Property which is required for local structural definition.  In 
addition, AAI made recommendations on procedures to improve the quality and integrity of the 
data being collected. 

 12.3.1.2  AAI's May 2011 Site Review—During AAI's visit to the property in May 2011, 
a detailed review of the exploration dataset provided by PHA was completed.  This review 
revealed some weaknesses in procedure.  AAI determined that core recovery must be 90% or 
above.  At 90%, data shows variability at less than the statistical uncertainty of the actual 
composite P2O5 grade, through either the UPZ or the LPZ than was introduced by the less-than-
complete core recovery through the phosphate zone.  The level of uncertainty is derived from the 
variability of individual assays within the respective phosphate zone.  High core recovery is 
necessary to minimize uncertainty, particularly in the LPZ where tight P2O5 content tolerances 
will control the feasibility of a direct-ship mining scenario.   

An issue of sampling related to core recovery revealed the potential for stretching core 
over the missing intervals.  A notable example was PA002, which was the first hole to be 



NI 43-101 Technical Report, Paris Hills Phosphate Project, Bloomington, Idaho, USA 
Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd.

Agapito Associates, Inc. 

sampled in October 2010, where short samples were stretched to cover the 1.5-m core run 
interval.  Subsequent holes were sampled by more experienced individuals and sample stretching 
was not a continuing problem.  However, with the solid-tube coring methods, there was 
difficulty assigning footage to the lost core intervals. 

The core recovery issue induced a reevaluation of the assays and data, which is detailed 
in the following discussion.  PHA decided to discard the assays from ALS and re-assay at new 
laboratories.  PHA also decided to concentrate the re-assaying on the LPZ, which is typically of 
higher grade, for initial development of the Property.  This would be an unbeneficiated 
phosphate rock product averaging greater than 29% P2O5 and suitable for direct shipment.  In the 
future, work will be done to evaluate the UPZ for potential development. 

With new documented procedures, all drill hole data were reviewed and core was 
re-logged, with a focus on the LPZ, to assess recovery percentages.  Depths were corrected to 
gamma logs.  Review was by senior personnel and any changes to the database were documented 
and approved.  In the case of core that could not be reconstructed due to previous sampling, 
photographic records were used.  

12.3.1.3  AAI's June 2012 Site Review—AAI visited the Property in June 2012 to 
observe sampling procedures for the UPZ.  The review confirmed that Stonegate was adhering to 
its sampling protocol and that the quality of sampling was acceptable and equivalent to that 
practiced in the LPZ. 

12.4 Audits 

 Visits were made to both current laboratories to observe procedure and practice.  The 
EnviroChem laboratory was visited on 29 August 2011 and the Thornton laboratory was visited 
on 17 August 2011.  Both labs are well-recognized in the industry and utilize well-recognized 
and referenced assay methodologies and QA/QC procedures.  In both cases, detailed tours of the 
facilities were made and all levels of personnel were interviewed.  EnviroChem lacked 
documented internal procedures for sample preparation, but management and personnel were 
consistent in reporting and execution.  Thornton did not document its own internal procedures, 
but again followed well-recognized testing methodologies.  Chain of custody, sample receiving, 
and results reporting were consistent for both labs.  PHA's own QA/QC results were reviewed 
and showed high accuracy and consistency within and between the labs. 

12.4.1   Certificates of Analyses 

AAI conducted random data integrity checks on the Certificates of Analyses provided by 
the testing laboratories by checking against the master database for accuracy and concluded the 
information to be reliable. 

12.4.2  Certified Survey 

A.A. Hudson and Associates, of Preston, Idaho, LPS, provided documents of Certified 
Survey for the hole locations and elevations.  These documents were not checked against actual 
field locations; rather AAI has relied on the expertise and licensure of the surveyors.  However, 



NI 43-101 Technical Report, Paris Hills Phosphate Project, Bloomington, Idaho, USA 
Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd. 
15 August 2012   Page 86 
 

Agapito Associates, Inc. 

the survey locations were used in the construction of maps and the locations matched the drill 
pad locations when compared to actual drill sites. 

12.4.3 Independent Audit 
           
          To further confirm agreement between the collected data at the drill and assay data within 
and between the testing laboratories, an independent audit was conducted.  While not typically 
conducted for industrial minerals projects, this type of audit requires an independent party (AAI) 
to take possession of core at the drill site, sample and assay at the complete discretion of the 
independent party to confirm the integrity of the assay as well as to independently compare the 
agreement between labs.  AAI collected the cored LPZ, 2.2 m above and 1.3 m below for PA 
Sub-Adit 4 at the drill site.  AAI maintained strict chain of custody and transferred the samples to 
AAI labs located in Grand Junction, Colorado where the core was logged, sampled following 
PHA's procedures, and sent for assay.  Blanks, standards, and duplicates were inserted by AAI.  
The samples were sent to Jacobs' laboratories in Lakeside, Florida where the samples were 
prepped and assayed.  Jacobs also inserted duplicates for check samples.  A total of 29 samples 
were analyzed.  The split core was retrieved from AAI labs by PHA and sent to EnviroChem in 
Pocatello, Idaho.  Whole core was sample-prepped at Jacobs when the core was too brittle or 
broken to be cut in half.  In that case, Jacobs sent the sample split to PHA for subsequent 
analysis at EnviroChem.  Agreement between the labs was within normal limits.  Certificates of 
Analysis confirmed reported assay values. 
 
12.5 Adequacy 

 Based on a review of the exploration program, the QPs are confident that early problems 
of core recovery, sampling, and assay bias have been resolved and that the exploration dataset 
used in this resource estimate meets the criteria for use under NI 43-101.  PHA's QA/QC 
program is designed with aggressive duplication and insertion.  Procedures are well documented 
and have been followed accordingly.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

In 2011, metallurgical testing of the UPZ and LPZ was completed by Jacobs, an 
independent, industry-recognized Florida-based process engineering firm.  Jacobs' phosphoric 
acid pilot plant program demonstrated that MGA and granular fertilizers could be produced from 
the LPZ without beneficiation.  Testing of the UPZ determined that some beneficiation would be 
required to produce marketable phosphate rock concentrate from the UPZ.  No testing was 
completed for the VZ.  

13.1 Lower Phosphate Zone 

In 2011, PHA commissioned Jacobs to complete ore characterization, density 
determinations, and bench-scale beneficiation tests to establish the unit operations required to 
produce an acceptable grade of concentrate at a targeted recovery.  Core samples from several 
PHA drill holes were sent to Jacobs' Lakeland, Florida laboratory for characterization and 
testing.  The LPZ was chemically analyzed and determined to be of sufficiently high P2O5 
content that beneficiation testing was not warranted.  The LPZ was evaluated instead for 
producing phosphoric acid and phosphatic fertilizers. 

A bulk sample of LPZ, obtained by compositing cores from 15 of 16 drill holes, was 
dried and ground to pass 35 mesh.  Table 13-1 lists the core holes used in the LPZ composite 
sample.  The sample was processed in the firm's Phosphoric Acid Pilot Plant.  The composite 
sample included the entire LPZ and no internal strata were rejected prior to the phosphoric acid 
pilot plant run.

The pilot plant program consisted of a series of day runs followed by a 90-hour 
continuous run.  The day runs gradually brought the reactor contents up to operating conditions

from an all water startup.  The continuous run was initially plagued by control problems due to 
excessive reactor foaming, but after the foam was eliminated and the control stabilized, the 
continuous run produced a high-quality phosphoric acid by operating the reactor at 26% P2O5 
strength with a low level of excess sulfate.    

 During the stabilized operating period (run hours 40 through 90), the overall P2O5 
recovery was high at 97%, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) usage was low at 2.43 t H2SO4/t P2O5, and the 
slurry filtration rates were acceptable at 5.2 t P2O5/square meters per day (m

2·day).  The filter 
acid produced was a bright green, but due to the amount of organic material present in the feed, 
both defoamer and flocculent additions were required to process the ore (Jacobs 2011b).  

 Several portions of 26% P2O5 filter acid were concentrated to MGA.  The concentrated 
acid deepened in color, but remained green and showed no signs of organic charring.  When 
clarified after 24 hours of aging, the MGA concentrated to 55% P2O5 produced a sludge that 
contained only 4.2% P2O5 at a rate of 1.6% by weight (Jacobs 2011b).    

 Two granular ammonium phosphates (MAP and DAP) were produced from the 
concentrated acid.  The DAP produced from clarified MGA was analyzed at 18.7:50.3:0 and the 
MAP produced from non-clarified MGA analyzed at 11.8:56.1:0.  Both products were light 
green in color, typical for western US rock, exhibited good crush strengths in the 2.7 to 3.2 
kilogram (kg) range, and exceeded commercial specifications for grade.  Due to the amount of 
organic material present in the feed, both defoamer and flocculent additions were required to 
process the ore, and this should be anticipated during commercial operation.  Photographs of the 
MAP and DAP products are shown in Figures 13-1 and 13-2. 

13.2 Upper Phosphate Zone 

Jacobs received UPZ core samples from the following drill holes:  PA001, PA004, 
PA006, PA010, PA012, PA014, PA016B, PA023, PA089, and PA109.  The UPZ samples from 
the first four holes were identified as "weathered" material, while the samples from the last six 
holes were referred to as "unweathered" material based on proximity to the outcrop and the 
anticipation of exposure to weathering effects.  Typically, weathered phosphate ore contains less 
CaO and MgO than unweathered ore and is enriched in P2O5.  The samples were tested for bulk 
density using a displacement method, chemically analyzed, and subjected to preliminary 
beneficiation testing.   

On a dry basis, testing yielded an average bulk density of 2.47 t/m3 for unweathered UPZ 
material compared to 2.35 t/m3 for weathered UPZ material (Jacobs 2011a).  The decrease in 
density is attributed to increased porosity caused by weathering. 

The general experience is that unweathered material does not respond well to the 
conventional washing plants used in the western US.  Unweathered ore typically can be 
processed if it is sufficiently high in grade, or if it is blended sparingly with weathered ore. 

Calcination of unweathered ore, followed by slaking and desliming, is one possibility for 
producing a marketable quality of phosphate rock, but it is not practiced by any of the operating 
western US phosphate mines.  Another possibility is grinding, desliming, and flotation.  
Currently, the Simplot phosphate mine in Vernal, Utah uses this process.

Industry experience shows that weathered ore typically can be processed by a relatively 
simple washing process involving crushing, grinding, and desliming.  Most of the gangue 
minerals are rejected while the slimes and phosphate rock suitable for producing phosphoric acid 
and phosphatic fertilizers can be recovered.  

Preliminary testing by Jacobs of PHA unweathered UPZ material (–3 mm) indicated that 
dry de-dusting was ineffective and that no size fraction appears suitable as commercial quality 
phosphate rock.  The wet desliming process, although more effective than dry de-dusting, did not 
successfully upgrade the unweathered UPZ material tested.  Similarly, calcination, slaking, 
attrition, and desliming were generally ineffective and no commercial-quality phosphate rock 
concentrate was produced for the conditions tested. 

Carbonate flotation, following grinding and desliming of the unweathered UPZ material, 
did yield acceptable quality phosphate rock and recovered about 70% of the P2O5.  The two tests 
performed produced concentrates of about 30% P2O5, with CaO/P2O5 ratios of 1.44 to 1.50 and 
an MER of 0.06 and 0.07.  Crushing and grinding to pass 14 Tyler mesh, followed by washing, 
indicated that desliming at 200 Tyler mesh can produce a suitable concentrate with +30% P2O5, a 
CaO/P2O5 ratio of approximately 1.36, and an MER of approximately 0.08.  Drying of the 
concentrate may be required (Jacobs 2011a). 

Preliminary implications for the weathered UPZ material is that it should respond well to 
crushing, closed-circuit grinding, desliming, and concentrate dewatering.  Possibly the 
concentrate would have to be dried.  

  In response to the encouraging flotation test results conducted in 2011, follow-up 
beneficiation test work was completed by Jacobs and reported in the "Beneficiation Status 
Report 2" (Jacobs 2012).  Drill core samples tested were UPZ material from drill holes PA012, 
PA014, PA023 and PA109.  Twenty-three bench-scale flotation tests were performed to examine 
beneficiation of 600/74 micron (µm) (28/200 mesh) flotation feed.  Heavy liquid separation tests 
were also performed on three size fractions from two of the drill holes (PA023 and PA109).   

 The conclusions of that test program were as follows: 

 The CaO/P2O5 ratio is a good indicator of the extent of UPZ weathering and determining 
when calcite flotation is required for upgrading phosphate ore to marketable grade (+30% 
P2O5). 

 A CaO/P2O5 ratio < 1.60:  Grind to 600 µm (28 mesh), wash, and deslime to produce a 
600 × 74 µm (28/200 mesh) concentrate which will be +31% P2O5. 

 A CaO/P2O5 ratio > 1.60:  Grind to 210 µm (65 mesh) and deslime at 20 µm (600 mesh) 
to produce a marketable concentrate (+31% P2O5). 

 Flotation testing on the deepest and highest CaO/P2O5 ratio samples (PA023 and PA109) 
achieved a +31% P2O5 concentrate at 58% overall P2O5 recovery.  

 The phosphate rock concentrate produced from flotation testing would be suitable for 
producing phosphoric acid, MAP and possibly DAP.

As a result of this follow-up testing, a conceptual flowsheet for beneficiation of UPZ material 
was developed.  Figure 13-3 illustrates the conceptual flowsheet for processing the three 
phosphate ore types at PHA (LPZ DSO, UPZ weathered ore, and UPZ unweathered ore).    

 The recommended unit operations for processing of PHA weathered UPZ ore includes 
crushing to –25 mm (1 inch), closed-circuit rod mill grinding to pass 80% less than 600 µm 
(28 mesh), scrubbing and desliming at 74 µm (200 mesh) (washing plant), and concentrate 
dewatering using vacuum filtration and flash drying to an acceptable moisture content.   Overall 
P2O5 recovery would be in the order of 85%.   

 For unweathered UPZ material, this beneficiation process would include crushing to –
225 mm (1 inch), closed-circuit rod mill grinding (1st stage), scrubbing and desliming at 74 µm 
(200 mesh), followed by a 2nd stage ball mill grinding to 80% less than 150 µm (100 mesh), 
desliming at 20 µm (600 mesh), followed by reverse flotation of calcite, and finally dewatering 
of the final concentrate with vacuum filtration and flash drying.  This would produce an MGA 
concentrate of at least 31% P2O5 with low CaO/P2O5 and MER ratios.  Overall, P2O5 recovery 
would be on the order of 60% to 75%, with higher recovery on partially weathered UPZ ore, and 
trending to lower recovery rates with the highest calcite content (> 2.0  CaO/P2O5 ratios) with the  
deepest and least weathered UPZ ores. 

It is recommended that future beneficiation testing on unweathered UPZ ore focus on 
optimizing grind size and flotation parameters such as reagent dosages in order to maximize 
concentrate grade and overall P2O5 recovery rates.  Other beneficiation testing might also include 
dewatering testing on the concentrate and tailings product with a focus on developing high-
density or dry tailings concepts for the eventual development of the UPZ.

14.0   MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The mineral resource for the Paris Hills Property comprises the UPZ, VZ and LPZ, which 
covers a plan area of 778 ha within the 1,008-ha Property.  The resource estimate for the 
principal mineralized target, the LPZ, is based on core drilling and core chemical analyses from 
39 exploration holes drilled by PHA from September 2010 through June 2012.  A separate 
resource estimate for the UPZ is based on assayed intercepts from 29 of the exploration holes.  
The upturned limbs of the LPZ and UPZ, as well as the VZ, are defined as Exploration Targets, 
for which estimates of potential mineralization are based on historical, NI 43-101 non-compliant 
exploration data collected prior to PHA.   

 
Item 14.1 describes a generalized "base case" underground room-and-pillar mining 

scenario which justifies reasonable prospects for economic extraction for LPZ and UPZ Mineral 
Resource estimation.  A separate detailed room-and-pillar mine plan was developed for 
justifying Mineral Reserves in the LPZ, as summarized in Items 15 through 22.   

 
The mineralization occurs in folded beds (i.e., zones) in two domains: (1) a gently 

dipping horizontal limb and (2) upturned limb.  The beds dip approximately 12° to 20º to the 
northwest (N50ºW) in the horizontal limb.  The horizontal limb has been the principal target of 
exploration drilling in 2010–2012 and comprises the best defined Mineral Resource on the 
Property.  Although no drilling has been conducted in the upturned limb, it is projected to 
contain substantial mineralization based on shallow, small-scale historical mining and limited 
surface trenching.  The horizontal limb LPZ and UPZ phosphate resources are discussed in 
Items 14.2 and 14.3, respectively.  The Exploration Targets in the upturned limb and VZ are 
discussed in Items 14.4 through 14.6. 

 
This Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Leo J. Gilbride, P.E., Senior Consultant 

with AAI, member of the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration, Inc., and QP for this 
TR.  The mineral resource estimate has an effective date of 15 August 2012. 

 
14.1  Base Case Mining Scenario 
 
14.1.1  Horizontal Limb 
 

Underground room-and-pillar mining is defined to be the base case mining scenario in 
the horizontal limb of the deposit.  PFS-level project economics have been developed for base 
case mining in the LPZ, as discussed in Items 16 through 22.  The PFS analysis demonstrates 
strong economic potential for mining the LPZ resource.   

 
Although no detailed economics have been developed for mining in the UPZ, the similar 

character of the bed to the LPZ implies reasonable economic potential.  The UPZ is nominally 
twice as thick as the LPZ, corresponding to similar or lower mining costs than the LPZ.  The 
P2O5 grade of the UPZ is lower than that of the LPZ which will result in higher beneficiation 
costs.  Preliminary estimates developed by AMEC (2010) limit beneficiation costs and confirm 
the general economic potential of the UPZ resource.

14.1.2  Upturned Limb 
 

No base case mining scenario is identified for potential extraction in the upturned limb, 
which is identified as an Exploration Target.  Reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
cannot be assumed based on the limited data available in the upturned limb.  Numerous mining 
methods may be viable for the steeply dipping zones in the upturned limb depending upon 
favorable geologic conditions, ranging from open pit mining near surface to underground cut-
and-fill mining, or shrinkage stoping at depth. 
 
14.2  Lower Phosphate Zone—Horizontal Limb 
 
14.2.1  Methodology 

 
Figure 14-1 shows the elevation contours for the LPZ and the locations of the 39 

exploration holes used in the LPZ resource estimate relative to the Property boundary and the 
mineralized area.  The limit of the resource is defined to the south by Bloomington Canyon 
where the zones outcrop or subcrop along the north canyon wall and to the west by the position 
of the upturned limb, beyond which to the west there is no occurrence of the host Meade Peak 
Member.  The resource area is bound to the north and east by the Property boundary.  The 
resource persists several kilometers east of the Property, but is ultimately truncated by major 
normal faulting along the western margin of the Bear Lake Valley graben.  The resource remains 
open to the north beyond the Property boundary at increasing depth.   

 
The western limit of the horizontal limb, where it transitions into the upturned limb, is 

estimated from the location of the outcrop of the upturned limb.  The limit is based on a 
horizontal offset to the east of the Meade Peak Member outcrop.  The horizontal offset is scaled 
according to depth to the horizontal limb and ranges from approximately 80 m near Bloomington 
Canyon to more than 250 m near Paris Canyon.  The offset definition is considered conservative.  
Potential exists for the horizontal limb to extend as much as 200 to 400 m, or more, further to the 
west depending upon the abruptness of folding and the degree of overturning.  Additional 
drilling near and through the upturned limb is required for determining the western limit of the 
horizontal limb with certainty.  

 
LPZ sample assays for 39 exploration holes drilled in 2011–2012 were compiled by PHA 

in a computer-based Microsoft Excel™ spreadsheet and provided to AAI for resource modeling.  
Although core recovery was inadequate for assay, the LPZ thickness was estimated from the 
gamma and core logs of a fortieth hole, PA159, and that thickness was applied to the geologic 
model for improved definition along the eastern margin of the deposit.  Values within the assay 
database were spot-checked against assay certificates and found to be of sufficient accuracy for 
resource modeling.  Drill hole collar coordinates were surveyed by a LPS and provided in UTM 
NAD83 coordinates.  Downhole directional survey data were available for 35 holes.  Downhole 
survey data were not collected for five of the holes, which were assumed to be true vertical. 

 
 Seam correlations were made using Carlson Mining 2011 Software™ (Carlson 2011), an 
industry-recognized commercial-grade geologic and mine modeling software system that runs 
within AutoDesk Inc.'s AutoCAD 2011©.  Strong continuity of the LPZ and other zones was

evident in all reporting holes across the Property.  LPZ tops and bottoms were picked from the 
sample assays and, in some holes, corroborated against natural gamma logs prepared by PHA. 
 
 The core was ordinarily sampled and assayed on 0.30 m lengths.  PHA geologists 
attempted to split samples at lithologic contacts at the top and bottom of the LPZ to increase 
assay resolution wherever possible. 

 
Quality parameters were composited as length-weighted averages of the individual assays 

over the LPZ thickness.  The composite thickness was subject to a composite grade cutoff of 
24.0% P2O5 and a composite thickness cutoff of 0.5 m.  In holes where sharp grade contacts were 
not present at the top and/or bottom of the LPZ, zone thickness was determined by maximizing 
thickness while maintaining a 29.5% P2O5 or better DSO composite grade.  The composite true 
vertical thicknesses and coordinates for the LPZ intercepts were adjusted according to the bed 
local dip and downhole survey data.  Composite values for the drill holes used in the resource 
estimate are summarized in Table 14-1. 

 
The drill hole composites were applied to a gridded-seam model using Carlson Mining's 

Geology Module 2011 for calculating the resource tonnage and grade parameters.  The flat-lying 
portion of the LPZ in the "horizontal limb" was gridded into a single layer of 20-m-square blocks 
of variable vertical thickness representing the local thickness of the zone.  Block thickness values 
were estimated from neighboring drill holes (point data) using a kriging algorithm.  Ordinary 
kriging was selected because it provides the most reliable, statistically unbiased estimator where 
sufficient spatial data are available.  A kriging model was also developed for estimating the P2O5 
grade in each block. 

 
Semivariograms of zone thickness and P2O5 grade were generated from the LPZ 

composite data.  No significant directionality was observed in the data.  Omni-directional 
semivariogram models developed for the resource calculation are listed in Table 14-2.  The LPZ 
semivariogram models are shown as blue lines in Figure 14-2.  The maximum number of data 
points used for estimation was limited to the closest 10 points within a radius of influence (ROI) 
of 1,609 m.  

 
The kriging model was compared against four other model types:  inverse distance 

squared (ID2), nearest neighbor (polygonal), linear interpolation (triangulation), and least 
squares.  The kriging model was within 5.5% of the other models in terms of tonnage, with all 
other models being higher, and within 1% in terms of average P2O5 grade.  The agreement of 
results supports the validity of the kriging model. 

 
Figures 14-3 and 14-4 are contour maps of the modeled thickness and P2O5 grade 

contours for the LPZ. 
 
Grids were also created for top and bottom elevations of each seam based on drill hole 

intercept elevations.  A polynomial algorithm, based on fifth-order polynomial smoothing of a 
linear interpolation estimator, was used for grid estimation.  Seam conformance was invoked in 
the algorithm which forced the prescribed sequence of stratigraphy at all grid locations, thus 
improving structural accuracy in areas with weaker drill hole control.  Seam overburden (depth)

and interburden thickness grids were created by subtracting the respective grids.  The ground 
surface elevation grid used for the depth calculations was generated from a commercially 
available USGS 7.5-minute digital elevation model.  The 3D structure represented in the model 
is illustrated in Figure 14-5. 
 

Phosphate tonnages are based on an average dry bulk density of 2.6 t/m3 derived from 36 
laboratory bulk density tests conducted by Jacobs on representative LPZ core drilled in 2011.  
Tests support a 95% confidence interval of 2.58±0.31 t/m3 for dry bulk density in the LPZ.  A 
dry bulk density of 2.6 is considered reasonably representative for mine planning purposes.  The 
average as-received moisture content ranged from dry to 10.1% by weight and averaged 2.5% 
among 49 tests.  Core was sealed in plastic sleeves in the field to preserve moisture. 

Secondary phosphate quality parameters were modeled using an ID2 algorithm.  
Secondary quality parameters modeled include Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, MER,

5 Na2O, K2O, CaO, 
CaO:P2O5 ratio, acid insoluble content, and organic carbon.   

 
Quality grids were also calculated using an ID2 algorithm for 0.15 m layers extending to a 

depth of 0.6 m beyond the LPZ into the roof and floor.  The roof and floor grids were applied to 
estimating out-of-seam dilution as part of the Mineral Reserves analysis. 

 
14.2.2  Definitions and Applicable Standards 
 
 For this report, AAI, in accordance with NI 43-101, has used the definition of "resource" 
and "reserve" as published in the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (CIMDS) that were adopted 27 November 2010 (CIM 2010).  In this standard, a 
Mineral Resource is defined as 
 

… a concentration of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic material in or 
on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade of quality that 
it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, 
grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are 
known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

 
 Mineral Resources are subdivided into classes of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, with 
the level of confidence reducing with each class, respectively.  Phosphate resources are reported 
as in situ tonnage and are not adjusted for mining losses or mining recovery. 
 
 A Mineral Reserve is defined as "… the economically mineable part of a Measured or 
Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study…" 
 
 CIMDS states that for the reporting of industrial mineral resources and reserves, issuers 
are to use the above definitions.  CIM provides further guidance on reporting practice under Best 
Practice Guidelines for Industrial Minerals adopted by CIM Council on 23 November 2003 
(CIM 2003).

14.2.3 Phosphate Resource 
 

The Mineral Resource classifications applied to this resource estimate are based on the 
technical methodology of Sedimentary Phosphate Resource Classification System of the USBM 
and the USGS (Geological Survey Circular 882, 1982).  The Mineral Resource calculations are 
compliant with CIM Best Practice Guidelines for Industrial Minerals.  The resource 
classifications of Sedimentary Phosphate Resource Classification System (USGS 1982) are 
summarized as follows: 

Phosphate Measured Resources—Quantity is computed from dimensions 
revealed by outcrops, trenches, workings, or drill holes; grade and (or) quality are 
computed from the results of detailed sampling.  The sites for inspection, 
sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so 
well defined that size, shape, depth, and phosphate content of the resource are 
well established. 
 
Criteria for classification:  The delineation of measured resources is the function 
of industry and often is proprietary.  No criteria have been set in this paper for this 
resource class.  The criteria generally used in industry are a sampling density of 
more than 64 boreholes per square mile.  

Phosphate Indicated Resources—Quantity and grade and (or) quality are 
computed from information similar to that used for measured resources, but the 
sites for inspection, sampling, and measure are farther apart or are otherwise less 
adequately spaced.  The degree of assurance, although lower than that for 
measured resources, is high enough to assume continuity between points of 
observation. 
 
Criteria for classification:  At least four boreholes or measured stratigraphic 
sections per square mile or no more than 800 m between holes.  

Phosphate Inferred Resources—Estimates are based on an assumed continuity 
beyond measured and (or) indicated resources for which there is geologic 
evidence.  Inferred resources may or may not be supported by samples or 
measurements.  
 
Criteria for classification:  At least one hole or measured stratigraphic section per 
square mile or no more than 1,600 m between boreholes. A greater distance 
between holes may be used if, in the considered judgment of the resource 
geologist, geologic inference allows. 
 
The reference to "64 boreholes per square mile" (equivalent to a spacing of 200 m 

between holes) as an implied criterion for Measured Resources generally applies to definition 
drilling in advance of open pit mining.  In the QPs' opinion, a spacing of 400 m between holes is 
considered sufficient for achieving the level of geologic confidence commensurate with a 
Measured Resource in this deposit.  This is supported by a high degree of geologic continuity, 
relatively uniform structure in the horizontal limb, and limited grade and thickness variability in

the LPZ across the Property.  While seismic and drill hole data indicate the presence of some 
post-depositional faulting in the horizontal limb, bed continuity is evident across the faults. 

 
Table 14-3 summarizes the resource classifications applied to the LPZ resource defined 

in terms of equivalent radial distance (or radius of influence) around a drill hole.  The radii are 
constructed around the point of intercept of the phosphate bed, which may differ from the hole 
collar location due to directional deviation during drilling.

Table 14-4 summarizes the LPZ Mineral Resource for the Property.  The resource 
classification areas are shown on the map in Figure 14-6. 
 
 The estimated LPZ in situ phosphate grade and secondary quality parameters are 
relatively consistent over the Property and of sufficient quality for the manufacture of marketable 
fertilizer products.  The LPZ is of high enough P2O5 grade, on average, to support the possibility 
for mining a direct ship product (without the need for beneficiation).  Direct ship mining depends 
substantially on the ability to control out-of-seam dilution with underground mining and 
tolerance in the market for quality variances caused by out-of-seam dilution. 
 
 No discount has been applied to the resource for possible undiscovered geological 
features, including faults, scours, and other structural disturbances, which may or may not 
preclude economic mining.  Limited seismic work, surface lineament analysis, and exploration 
drilling indicate the possibility of faulting and/or landslide features at some locations.  The 
presence of such structures at the prospective LPZ mining horizon and the extent to which these 
features could impact mining is undefined at the current stage of exploration.  Because potential 
impacts to extraction depend upon the mining method employed and mine plan, quantitative 
discounting for structural features is deferred to the reserves analysis which addresses a specific 
mining method and mine plan.  Undiscovered geological features are acknowledged as a 
qualitative risk factor at the resource level. 
 
14.3  Upper Phosphate Zone—Horizontal Limb 
 

The UPZ resource was calculated following the same methodology described for the LPZ 
(Item 14.2).  The UPZ resource is based on the 29 holes shown in Figure 14-7.  Composite 
assays for the exploration holes applied to the resource model are summarized in Table 14-5.  
Modeled UPZ structure is shown in Figure 14-7.

Figure 14-8 presents the semivariograms of zone thickness and P2O5 grade for the UPZ 
drill hole composites.  No significant directionality was observed in the data.  The omni-
directional semivariogram models developed for the resource calculation are summarized in 
Table 14-6.  The maximum number of data points used for estimation was limited to the closest 
ten points within a radius of influence of 1,609 m.  

 
Figures 14-9 and 14-10 are contour maps of the modeled thickness and P2O5 grade 

contours for the UPZ. 
 
Table 14-7 summarizes the resource classifications applied to the UPZ resource.  The 

UPZ Mineral Resource is presented in Table 14-8.  The corresponding resource classification 
areas are shown on the map in Figure 14-11. 
 
 The UPZ thickness and in situ quality are relatively consistent over the Property.  The 
quality of the UPZ is not sufficient, on average, to support the possibility for mining a direct ship 
product and some beneficiation will be required to produce a saleable product. 
 
14.4  Lower Phosphate Zone—Upturned Limb 
 

The upturned limb is expected to contain significant phosphate mineralization.  However, 
insufficient exploration information is available to support the estimation of a Mineral Resource. 
Three historical trench samples along the outcrop in Little and Paris Canyons confirm the 
persistence of the LPZ in the upturned limb.  No drill holes penetrate the upturned limb.  Seismic 
analysis to date has produced no useful information about the geometry of the upturned limb.  
The degree of structural deformation, geometry of folding, and impacts to the character and 
mineability of the LPZ at depth and updip are not adequately understood.  In the opinion of the 
QPs, these unknowns introduce sufficient geologic uncertainty to preclude estimating a Mineral 
Resource, particularly to the north where the upturned limb reaches depths of more than 1,000 m. 

 
 Expectations are that the mineralized beds of interest persist through the upturned limb.  
An estimate of potential mineralization is made based on the character of the mineralization in 
the adjacent horizontal limb and the estimated geometry of the upturned limb.  The LPZ is 
projected to contain between 7 and 10 Mt of phosphate mineralization over its approximately 
3-km strike length across the Property.  The tonnage range accounts for potential thinning or 
thickening of the LPZ due to structural deformation, as well as a range of folding possibilities 
from upright to overturned.  The average grade is projected to range between 28.0% and 32.0% 
P2O5, similar to that in the horizontal limb and assuming a 28.0% P2O5 composite cutoff.  
Localized enrichment from weathering effects is likely near the outcrop. 
 

 Table 14-9 summarizes the projected LPZ Exploration Target in the upturned limb.  
Actual tonnes and grade could be more or less than projected because of the recognized geologic 
uncertainties.   

 
 The reader is cautioned that the LPZ-Upturned Limb Exploration Target is 
conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define it as a Mineral 
Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a

Like the LPZ, the UPZ is anticipated to persist in the upturned limb.  The UPZ 
Exploration Target in the upturned limb is projected to contain between 14 and 20 Mt of 
phosphate mineralization averaging between 21.0% and 25.0% P2O5, assuming a 20% P2O5 
cutoff.  Table 14-10 summarizes the UPZ Exploration Target.  The ranges of the estimate reflect 
uncertainty associated with key assumptions, including the geometry and potential for economic 
extraction in the upturned limb, possible variability of laboratory measurements, density, and 
possible dilution introduced by RC drilling.

The reader is cautioned that the UPZ Exploration Target is conceptual in nature 

and there has been insufficient exploration to define it as a Mineral Resource, and it is

under NI 43-101.  The Exploration Target is not being reported as part of any Mineral 
Resource or Mineral Reserve. 

 
14.6  Vanadium Zone 
  

The QPs consider there to be significant vanadium and phosphate mineralization 
contained in the VZ.  The VZ was not targeted for exploration or coring as part of PHA's 2011 
exploration program, although extensive drilling and limited test mining in the VZ was 
conducted historically by others.  The historical VZ exploration data are considered unreliable 
for use in estimating an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource. 

 
AMEC (2010) estimated that the VZ contains on the order of 39.9 Mt of mineralization 

averaging 0.79% V2O5 and 9.7% P2O5 in the horizontal and upturned limbs combined, assuming 
a 0.50% V2O5 cutoff.  The QPs consider the estimate sufficient for use as the basis of an 
Exploration Target.

The VZ Exploration Target, including the horizontal and upturned limbs, is projected to 
contain between 32 and 44 Mt of phosphate mineralization averaging between 0.70% and 0.80% 
V2O5 and 8.0% and 11.0% P2O5, assuming a 0.50% V2O5 cutoff.  Table 14-11 summarizes the 
VZ Exploration Target.

15.0   MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

 A PFS for room-and-pillar mining in the horizontal limb of the LPZ at the Paris Hills 
Project has been completed by Stonegate in accordance with NI 43-101 standards and CIMDS 
PFS definition.  The methodology used was to determine a suitable mining method based on 
deposit type, geologic structure, ore zone thickness and ore grade, equipment types, and 
marketing requirements. 

 The reserves stated in this Technical Report are based on the PFS completed in March 
2012 and remain unchanged as reported in the March 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report. 

 The mining method selected in the PFS is the underground room-and-pillar method, with 
partial pillar extraction,6 similar to coal, trona, and potash mining (USA).  This method has the 
highest chance to develop an underground mine with the productivity and grade control 
necessary to produce a direct ship crushed ROM ore (phosphate rock concentrate) at capital and 
operating costs necessary to make the project economical.  This mining method fits the following 
parameters: 

 Geologic type    Moderate (some faulting) 
 Deposit type    Underground mining 
 Seam dip    15° to 19° 
 Ore zone thickness Variable  
 Minimum mining height 1.5 m 
 Product    Crushed ROM phosphate rock concentrate (ore) 

 
 Mineral Resources were converted to Mineral Reserves on the basis of a PFS 
commissioned by PHA.  Mine projections were developed based on the deposit parameters, 
geotechnical analysis, and equipment constraints.   

 Mine production scheduling and ore grade determination were modeled using Carlson 
Mining 2011's Underground Mining Module (Carlson 2011).  Carlson, historically referred to as 
SurvCADD™, is the predominate mine planning software used by US underground operators in 
bedded seam deposits, including coal and trona, and is well suited for planning in the horizontal 
limb of the Paris Hills phosphate deposit. 

 Mine projections were developed in AutoCAD 2012™ based on the LPZ resource model 
grids discussed in Item14.2.  The resource model grids describe true bed thickness, elevation, 
depth of cover, dip, and the following quality parameters:  P₂O₅, Fe₂O₃, Al₂O₃, MgO, K₂O, 
CaO, CaO/P₂O₅, Na₂O, MER, acid insolubles, and organic carbon content.   

 The mine layout was limited to M&I resources in accordance with the definition of 
Mineral Reserves under NI 43-101.  Mining was additionally constrained by the property 
boundary, the projected western limit of the horizontal limb, outcrop and subcrop locations along 
Bloomington Canyon, and major fault projections.  The mine projections are shown in 
Figure 15-1. 

                                                           
6 Also called retreat mining, second mining, and depillaring.

 Mine timing was developed in Carlson based on bed volumetrics, production rates at each 
miner (unit) section, work schedules, and recovery factors for primary and secondary mining.  
Each miner section was scheduled by year for the life of the mine.  

 Production data from the Carlson model were compiled and post-processed in an Excel 
spreadsheet.  Out-of-seam dilution was calculated based on bed thickness and a minimum mining 
height of 1.5 m.  Dilution tonnes considered the average cross-dip of the entries (12.5° on 
average) relative to the maximum inclined working angle of the mining equipment (8.5°).  
Except for thick areas, some mining of the roof and/floor is required in the corners of each entry.  
The bed cross-dip versus equipment limit angle effect on dilution is illustrated in Figure 15-2.  
An algorithm was developed in Excel to compute the optimal geometry of mining for 
maximizing grade and tonnes based on the grade of the immediate roof and floor.  An additional 
0.15 m of roof material was assumed to fall out, on average, from above the miner cut before the 
installation of roof support based on anticipated weak roof conditions.  The final head grade and 
mined tonnes were calculated as the mixture of rock cut in-seam and out-of-seam, and fallout 
from the roof.   

 Results were summarized in the form of monthly, annual, and life-of-mine production for 
economic analysis. 

 Mine tonnage, timing, and ore grade were determined, a capital and operating cost budget 
was prepared, and a pre-tax and after-tax cash flow analysis was conducted to determine 
economics.  A marketing study was commissioned by PHA (CRU 2012).  In addition, project 
environmental and permitting requirements were identified and preliminary geotechnical and 
hydrologic studies were conducted. 

 See Figure 14-7 for the M&I Resource areas that were converted to Proven and Probable 
Reserves.  Figure 15-3 shows the mine projections, surface topography, and depth of cover for 
the underground mine.  Figure 15-4 shows the LPZ thickness and P2O5 grade (core hole, 
undiluted). 

 Table 15-1 states the M&I tonnage converted to Proven and Probable Reserves tonnage.  
No Inferred tonnes are included in the M&I tonnes or Proven and Probable Reserves.   

 Various risks are associated with mining the Reserves which are independent of geologic 
confidence.  Mineral reserves could be adversely affected by mining conditions, notably steep 
dip, weak strata, and groundwater inflows.  Ore grade could be adversely affected by mining 
conditions and continuous miner operator differentiation of LPZ vertical extents.  Permitting 
delays would adversely impact the Project implementation schedule but should not impact 
Mineral Reserves.  Legal challenges to BLM leasing would reduce available Mineral Reserves.  
Reduced productivity would increase operating and capital costs, adversely affecting Project 
economics.  Unfavorable court decisions on permit challenges could result in not receiving 
necessary permits. 

 The QP has reviewed the PFS and is satisfied that the CIMDS' modifying factors have 
been adequately addressed; therefore, all measured tonnes are presently classified as Proven 
tonnes.

16.0   MINING METHODS 

 As stated in Item 15, the mining method selected for the March 2012 PFS was the 
underground room-and-pillar method with partial pillar extraction.  This method was selected 
because the deposit is a tabular, strata-bound deposit, suitable for mining by heavy-duty type 
coal mining equipment in the LPZ ore bed with bed thickness averaging about 1.8 m. 

The underground mine will use the room-and-pillar mining method with partial pillar 
extraction.  Pillars will be sized for 30-m centers closer to surface, increasing to as much as 60 m 
in the deeper reaches of the mine.  The mine will feature drum-type continuous miners, shuttle 
cars, roof-bolting machines, feeder-breakers, and mobile roof supports (MRS) for production 
equipment.  At full production, a total of six continuous miners will be employed in three 
supersections on development and as three, single, continuous miner sections on retreat.  The 
annual production is targeted at a nominal 1.0-million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) design mining 
rate.  Underground ore haulage is by a combination of 1,067-mm- and 1,524-mm-width belt 
conveyors.  Electrical power for the underground mine is provided by a 12,470-volt (V) 
distribution system, with appropriate step-down transformers located throughout the mine 
workings for the mobile and stationary electrically powered equipment.  Mine drainage water 
will be pumped to the surface and treated prior to reuse or injection via wells. 

The ramp-up of mining production will take 3 years to reach the designed mining rate of 
1.0 Mtpa.  It is assumed that there will be 2 years of site development prior to initiating 
phosphate rock production.  The mine life is estimated to be 14 years, producing a total of 
10.0 Mt of phosphate rock ore at an average grade of 29.4 % P2O5 (diluted).  Figure 16-1 shows 
the mine schedule for advance mining, and Figure 16-2 shows the mine schedule for retreat 
operations.  Table 16-1 summarizes production and ore grades by year. 

 Geotechnical analysis indicates that mine ground support can be achieved with resin-
anchored rockbolts, metal straps, and wire mesh.  Supplemental support can be provided with 
cable bolts, trusses, timbers, and cribs.  Steel sets may be needed for limited areas in long-life 
entries. 

 Groundwater hydrologic analysis indicates that dewatering in advance of mining will be 
required at rates up to 60 cubic meters per minute (m3/min).  This water will be direct injected 
into the ground away from the mine site to prevent returning inflows. 

 Mining dilution factors include 0.15 m of out-of-seam dilution when the LPZ thickness is 
less than approximately 2 m.  Below this bed thickness, the targeted mining height will be 1.5 m.  
Above about 2 m, the minimum mining height will be increased so that the mining height plus 
0.15 of out-of-seam dilution will still be less than or equal to the LPZ height, which prevents 
falling material from diluting the mined material.   

 Underground mine development is minimal, with less than 30.5 m of drift entry mined in 
rock.  Thereafter, all mining is in ore. 

Underground mining production equipment consists of the following:

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

The mine's product will be marketed as crushed phosphate rock concentrate (ore).  
Beneficiation of the mined LPZ phosphate ore will not be required due to the high grade of 
mined phosphate rock ore (29.4% P2O5), a grade suitable for ammonium phosphate fertilizer 
production.  For this reason, the only processing of LPZ phosphate ore that is required is to 
prepare the ROM ore to a suitable crushed size for transport to potential phosphate rock 
customers. 

A contract portable crushing facility is planned to prepare the ROM phosphate rock ore 
delivered from the underground mining operations.  ROM phosphate rock will be conveyed from 
the underground mine at a size no greater than 250 mm to and crushed to –12 mm.  Marketing 
efforts will identify specific crush size requirements prior to finalizing a proposal for contract 
crushing of mined phosphate rock ore.  

 A minimal amount of water (75.7 to 189.3 liters per minute [lpm]) will be needed for 
controlling crusher generated dust.  Crusher electrical energy requirements are anticipated to be 
less than 1,000 kilowatts (kW).  No other process materials other than normal routine 
maintenance materials are required.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

Phosphate commonly refers to the compound P2O5 which is found in sedimentary and 
igneous deposits in various locations around the world.  The largest end use for phosphate rock is 
the fertilizer industry with an estimated 88% of 2010 total consumption.  Phosphate is one of the 
three key nutrients (the others being nitrogen and potassium) that are essential to healthy plant 
growth.  There is no substitute for phosphate in plant nutrition, and phosphate rock is the only 
world-scale raw material available for the production of the fertilizers required for food 
production. 

Commercial grades of phosphate rock vary from about 27.5% to 36.6% P2O5, with a 
grade of about 30% or higher being typical.  The grade of most mined ore is below the 
commercial-grade range and, therefore, requires processing or beneficiation before it can be used 
or sold.  But some mined ore is of high enough grade that it requires only crushing before being 
sent direct to market.  Such high-grade ores are referred to as Direct Ship Ore (DSO).  

The majority of the phosphate rock (80% to 85%) produced in a given year is consumed 
in vertically integrated downstream processing operations associated with the mine.  These 
operations typically manufacture phosphoric acid, which is used to produce fertilizer end-
products such as DAP, MAP, and TSP.  Phosphate rock is also used to manufacture non-
phosphoric acid derived products like single super phosphate (SSP) and a small amount is used 
by farmers for direct application to the soil. 

Phosphate rock prices are primarily influenced by the market for its primary derivatives, 
namely phosphate fertilizers, which in turn are influenced by a number of factors at various 
points in the value chain, including crop prices, agricultural practices, government policies, and 
weather conditions.  

The long-term fundamentals for phosphate fertilizer demand and prices are positive in the 
period 2010 to 2020.  The relatively high concentration of supply in the international rock market 
is dominated by the Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) (Morocco) and will continue to 
enable miners to increase their share of the phosphate fertilizer margins as the market allows.  

The PHA phosphate rock exhibits superior characteristics versus many of the rock 
concentrates currently consumed, and the phosphate content is typical of currently consumed 
products.  A number of vertically integrated rock consumers, particularly those in the southeast 
US, consume rock that grades below 30% P2O5, which would suggest that the grade of PHA rock 
concentrate (likely to be around 29.5%) would meet the grade requirements of potential buyers. 
In addition, none of the impurities in the PHA concentrate are likely to prevent the product from 
being amenable to consumption within the plants of these operations. 

PHA has received a third-party marketing study (CRU 2012) in support of a PFS.  The 
QP has reviewed the third-party marketing study and confirms that it discusses the relevant 
topics of market demand, pricing, transportation, and competition.  The QP confirms that the 
market study's findings support the assumptions used for this TR.  

CRU concludes in its study that an assumed sales price of $160/t FOB shipping point for 
PHA phosphate rock would be appropriate.  CRU also estimates transportation costs to potential

customers would be approximately as follows:  by truck, Idaho $11/t; by truck to Montpelier, 
Idaho and then rail to US west coast ports in Washington or Oregon $21/t; Edmonton, Alberta 
$31/t; Louisiana $47/t; and Florida $57/t.

20.0  ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING  
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACTS 

20.1 Environmental and Permitting  

 Phosphate mining, processing, and site remediation and reclamation are governed under 
state and federal requirements to protect the health of the public as well as the health of the 
environment.  The following summarize the federal, state, and local permitting requirements that 
are necessary for the proposed PHA underground mine.  Table 20-1 identifies the existing 
permits held by PHA.  Table 20-2 identifies the regulatory authority permits, approvals, and 
notices that may be required to develop the Property, and other related comments.

 PHA's  permitting and mining strategy  is to initially mine on state and private lands then 
to mine on  federally leased land.  This strategy is expected to allow ample time for the federal 
NEPA process while allowing mining to commence.  Table 20-3 lists the federal environmental 
permits for the Project. 

20.2 Idaho Exploration Permits  

On 30 June 2008, RMP was granted three exploration permits by the IDL, covering 
portions of Sections 15, 16, and 22 in T14S, R43E.  The permits specifically provide for the 
mineral exploration of phosphate and metalliferous minerals (including silver, zinc, lead, nickel, 
cobalt, platinum, palladium, vanadium, gold and all other metalliferous minerals).  Each of the 
permits is granted in consideration of an annual permit fee of US$500, due by January 31st of 
each year the permit is in effect.  The permits may be converted to preferential-right Mineral 
Leases upon satisfactory showing of an economic mineral resource of paying quality and 
quantity.  The IDL permits are due to expire on 31 December 2013.  

If the exploration licenses are converted to Mineral Leases, then a royalty is paid on all 
minerals mined and removed from the permit areas.  Royalty rates vary by commodity, and a 
description of the royalty calculation for phosphate and associated or related minerals is provided 
in the subsection Phosphate Royalty Calculation (Table 4-4).  Upon Mineral Lease conversion, 
rental fees can be used as a credit against production royalty during a given lease year.

Section 404 Permit 
 

Section 404 permit would likely 
be required for the discharge of 
dredged or fill material into 
navigable waters of the US, 
including wetlands.  Jurisdictional 
waters of the US evaluation 
would likely be needed for permit 
application.  If the discharge is 
into jurisdictional waters of the 
US, then a 404 permit application 
would be necessary. 

Within 15 days of receiving 
complete permit application, a 
public notice would be issued with 
a 15- or 30-day comment period. 
The proposal is then reviewed by 
the USACE, local, state and federal 
agencies, special interest groups 
and the general public.  After the 
comment period, the USACE 
would review all of the comments 
and consult with the other federal 
agencies where appropriate. The 
USACE may ask for additional 
information at this time and the 
public hearing may be conducted if 
one has been specifically requested 
and a decision has been made that 
there is a need. The USACE makes 
every effort possible to process 
Individual Permit applications 
within 120 days of the date of the 
complete application is submitted. 
Process may be merged with the 
BLM NEPA process for 
expediency.

20.3 Community Impacts 

The construction of a new phosphate mine in Bear Lake County will have a significant 
positive impact on the local economy.   At least 300 permanent direct jobs will be created by the 
construction of the mine when at full production (1.0 Mtpa) and it is estimated that four times as 
many indirect jobs will be created as a result of the PHA mine going into production.  

A new 6-km access road will be constructed which will connect to Rte 89 between the 
towns of Paris and Bloomington.  Access deceleration and acceleration lanes will be constructed 
at the point of access to enable safe turn-off and access to the new mine access road.  The access 
road will be completely paved with asphalt to avoid fugitive dust emissions from vehicular 
traffic.  The road will be built to a standard to permit safe passage of heavy trucks to and from 
the mine.  Where a creek is crossed, culverts or small bridges will be constructed to a standard 
required for unobstructed flow of existing creeks.  

Transport of phosphate rock concentrate north on Rte 89 from the mine will be required 
at a rate of 1.0 Mtpa using 36-t capacity bottom-dump tandem trailer trucks.  Transport trucks 
used for phosphate rock haulage are proposed to operate normally during daylight hours from 
8:00 ante meridian (a.m.) to 7:00 post meridian (p.m.) Monday through Saturday.  Safe travel 
through the towns of Paris, Ovid, and Montpelier is important to minimize the impact to these 
communities.  PHA will work closely with Bear Lake County and town councils to ensure the 
impact of frequent phosphate rock haulage transport is minimized to the benefit of these 
communities.  

20.4 Reclamation and Closure 

 The Project will be required to post reclamation bonds per the BLM and State of Idaho 
rules and regulations (BLM 1992; 43 CFR Part 3595, Protection Against Mining Hazards 2011).  
Also, reclamation of the proposed mine would need to be in accordance with IDL (1992) "Best 
Management Practices for Mining in Idaho."  No tailing structures are planned so it is not 
required that a surety bond be posted.  Reclamation costs of $2.4 million net of salvage are 
included in the project economics.

21.0   CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

 The room-and-pillar mine plan is the basis for determining project economics.  The mine 
planning process provides the production timing which determines the capital and operating cost 
estimates.  The PFS capital and operating costs were developed from a combination of sources, 
including specific and budgetary vendor quotes, published estimating sources, and information 
from recent similar projects.  The summary identifies the IPC and sustaining capital (equipment, 
rebuilt and replacement capital).  Excluded from the costs are current year exploration and 
permitting costs, and corporate overhead.  
 

The capital and operating costs in this Technical Report are based on the PFS completed 
in March 2012 and remain unchanged as reported in the 26 March 2012 NI 43-101 Technical 
Report. 
   
21.1 Operating Costs 
 
 Operating costs are expressed in terms of dollars per dry tonne and are unique to the 
mining method.  Operating costs include a direct and indirect component.  Ongoing recurring 
costs as part of the normal mining operation are direct costs.  These items are dependent upon the 
production rate of ore and include labor, materials, power, and fuel.  Indirect or fixed costs 
(within a relevant range) are independent of the rate of production and include such items as 
mine site administration.  Mine advance equipment, normally capitalized for book accounting 
purposes, is expensed per the United States Internal Revenue Service's "receding face theory," 
which allows for full cost deduction for income tax calculation. 
 
 Operating cost is projected from a detailed labor schedule and detailed receding face 
schedule (i.e., belt conveyor advance and retreat) based on various cost sources, ranging from 
vendor quotes to operating mine surveys.  Table 21-1 shows the average life-of-mine operating 
cost. 
 
21.2 Capital Costs 
 

Capital costs are developed from the list of equipment and infrastructure necessary to 
produce the ore at the rates designed in the mine production timing.  A detailed capital 
equipment list was developed and is summarized by major category in Table 21-2.  The 
summary identifies the IPC, defined as the time from project approval to the last planned mine 
production unit is commissioned, and sustaining capital, which is the equipment and rebuilt and 
replacement capital. 
 
 The IPC expenditure will be $149.2 million which will extend over a 5-year period from 
Project Year –2 to Project Year 3.   Included in this figure are $16.7 million of cost contingency 
and $6.5 million of working capital expenditures.  Cost contingency and working capital 
represent 11.2% and 4.4% of the total initial capital expenditures planned.  In addition to the 
initial capital expenditures, there will be $89.5 million of sustaining capital expenditures planned 
over a 12-year period from Project Years 4 through 15.  Included in this figure is $7.4 million of 
cost contingency, representing 8.3% of total sustaining capital expenditures planned.  Total

capital expenditures will therefore be $238.7 million spanning a 17-year period.  This amount 
includes $24.1 million of cost contingency and $6.5 million of working capital, representing 
10.1% and 2.7%, respectively, of total planned capital expenditures for the Project.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS  
 

The overall project economic evaluation was completed in the form of an NPV analysis 
of the revenues less the costs as they apply to the mine production timing.  The net value of the 
present worth of the cash flow at an 8% annual rate of return was determined.  The IRR and 
payback period were also calculated from the start of production.   

 
The economic analysis in this Technical Report are based on the PFS completed in March 

2012 and remain unchanged as reported in the 26 March 2012 NI 43-101 Technical Report. 
 
22.1 Assumptions 
 
 The principal assumptions in the economic analysis are presented in Table 22-1.  The 
sales price was established by CRU (2012). 
 
 

Table 22-1.  Cash Flow Assumptions 

Item Value 
Sales price freight on board (FOB) shipping point $160/t 
Discount rate 8.0% 
Fourth quarter 2011 USD  
Zero interest expense 
Land and exploration costs not included 
Corporate overhead not included 
Tonnage sold in year produced 

 
 
22.2 Cash Flow 
 

The forecasted cash flow on an annual basis, including the annual production schedule 
for the life of the project, is included in Table 22-2.  The Project has 2 years of capital 
expenditures for construction prior to initiating production (revenue stream) of phosphate rock.   
The Project will generate annual and cumulative negative cash flows through Project Year 2.  In 
Project Year 3, positive cash flow will be achieved and sustained for the balance of the Project 
life.  The peak negative cash flow for the project will be $134.3 million in Project Year 2; 
however, initial capital expenditures will continue into Project Year 3.  Therefore Project Year 3 
initial capital expenditures will be financed from Project cash flow.  Project financing 
requirements for development will correspond with the peak negative cash flow amount of 
$134.3 million in Project Year 2. 

 
 The NPV of this cash flow pre-tax is $241.8 million and after-tax is $179.5 million, 
indicating an economically viable project.  The pre-tax IRR is 31% and the after-tax IRR is 27%.  
The results of the analysis of the cash flow are presented in Table 22-3.  
 
 The payback period is the start of production (Project Year 1) as the first year of the 
payback period.   The payback period is 4.6 years for pre-tax and 5.3 years for after-tax.

22.3  Sensitivities 
 
 A sensitivity analysis was completed using 10% positive and negative change in the 
variants of phosphate price, capital costs, operating costs, and tonnage produced.  The after-tax 
NPV using a discount rate of 8% was determined by changing the variants one at a time.  The 
results are shown in Table 22-5.  In all cases, the NPV remains greater than $100 million.  The 
change of the NPV with change in the variant indicates that the project is most sensitive to sales 
price and least sensitive to capital cost.

24.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1  Phosphate Pricing and Marketing  
 
24.1.1  Uses of Phosphate Rock  
 

The main use of phosphate rock concentrate (also referred to as phosphate rock) is for the 
production of fertilizer.  In 2010, more than 90% of USA phosphate rock mined was used to 
manufacture wet-process phosphoric acid used as an intermediate feedstock in the manufacture 
of granular and liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizers.  The balance of the phosphate rock 
mined in 2010 (approximately 10%) was used for the manufacture of animal feed supplements, 
for the direct application to soil and for elemental phosphorus production.  Elemental phosphorus 
is used to produce phosphorus compounds for a variety of food-additive and industrial and 
agricultural applications.   

 
24.1.2  Substitutes  
 

There are no substitutes for phosphorus in agriculture.  
 
24.1.3  Ores and Geographic Location of World Reserves  
 

Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary marine phosphorites.  The 
largest sedimentary deposits are found in northern Africa, China, the Middle East, and the USA. 
Significant igneous occurrences are found in South America, Canada, Russia, and South Africa.   
 
24.1.4  Major Producing Countries  
 

In 2010, mine production was dominated by the USA, China, and Morocco (including the 
Western Sahara), which together accounted for 66% of the world total.  Table 24-1 shows 
estimates by the USGS of production data per country over the period 2009 to 2010 and current 
phosphate reserve estimates.   
 
24.1.5  Historical Prices  
 

Unlike many other mineral commodities, no standard domestic or world price for 
phosphate rock exists.  Average ranges of world prices are published in various industry trade 
journals based on a sample of transactions.  Average annual prices were generally under US$50 
per tonne until 2006 when rising world demand for agricultural nutrients triggered a sharp 
increase.  The price for phosphate rock concentrate containing 31% to 33% P2O5 FOB Morocco, 
which is a widely followed benchmark in the fertilizer industry, peaked at more than US$500 per 
tonne in 2008. 
 
 Subsequently, during the world economic recession, the Moroccan price fell to just under 
$100 per tonne before recovering along with fertilizer demand in 2010; the price currently is 
approximately US$200 per tonne.

24.1.6  Current Demand  
 
The USA is a leading consumer, producer, and supplier of phosphate fertilizers.  

Domestic consumption of phosphate rock concentrate was 30.5 Mt in 2010.  There were no sales 
of domestic phosphate rock reported by producers.  All USA phosphate rock mining companies 
are vertically integrated, having one or more fertilizer plants, usually located near the mine.  
 

According to the USGS, Mosaic was the leading USA company with about 56% of 
domestic phosphoric acid production capacity and 13% of world capacity.  In 2010, the company 
operated four wet process phosphoric acid plants and four fertilizer plants in Florida and one of 
each in Louisiana.  PCS had phosphoric acid and fertilizer production facilities near its mines in 
Florida and North Carolina.  In Idaho, Simplot sent ore from its Smoky Canyon Mine by slurry 
pipeline to its fertilizer plant in Pocatello, Idaho; Simplot sent ore by pipeline from the Vernal 
Mine in Utah to its plant in Rock Springs, Wyoming.  

 
Three companies—Agrifos Fertilizer Inc., Pasadena, Texas; Mississippi Phosphates 

Corp., Pascagoula, Mississippi; and PCS Nitrogen, Inc., Geismar, Lousiana—manufactured wet-
process phosphoric acid using imported phosphate rock from Morocco.  Agrifos and Mississippi 
Phosphates produced phosphate fertilizer products for domestic and export markets.  PCS sold 
some merchant-grade phosphoric acid to Innophos Holdings, Inc., which had a nearby facility, 
for upgrading into high-purity acid for technical- and food-grade applications.

Monsanto operated the only elemental phosphorus plant in the USA in Soda Springs, 
Idaho.  The company used elemental phosphorus to manufacture phosphorus trichloride, which 
was used as a chemical intermediary for the production of glyphosate-base herbicides. 

24.1.7  Current and Future Supply 
 

The USA produces most of phosphate rock concentrate that it uses, with production in 
2010 totaling 25.8 Mt, according to the USGS.  Imports of phosphate rock concentrate, mainly 
from Morocco and Peru, were 2.4 Mt. 

 
Domestic phosphate rock production in 2010 came from twelve active mines 

(Table 24-2).  The phosphate industry is concentrated in Florida in the counties of Hamilton, 
Hardee, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Polk.  In 2010, seven mines, representing 65% of domestic 
annual production capacity, were active in Florida.  The Mosaic Company operated five mines, 
and CF Industries, Inc. and PCS Phosphate Co., Inc each operated one mine.  In Beaufort 
County, North Carolina, PCS operated a large integrated production facility that included a mine 
and a plant producing animal feed, fertilizer, and phosphoric acid.  In the Western Phosphate 
Field in Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming, four mines were active in 2010; three in Idaho and 
one in Utah.  In Idaho, phosphate rock was mined in Caribou County by Nu-West Industries, Inc. 
(a subsidiary of Agrium Inc., Calgary, Alberta, Canada), P4 Production, LLC (a subsidiary of 
Monsanto Co.), and J.R. Simplot Co. Simplot also operated the Vernal Mine in Uintah County, 
Utah.

 The future supply of phosphate rock for the US market is expected to continue to rely on 
the current operating mines.  There are several new mines planned in Florida as replacements for 
existing mines.  However, public opposition to existing mining and a government review of the 
permitting process for new mining in Florida has slowed the permitting process.  Court 
injunctions stopped production for a period at Mosaic's South Fort Meade Mine in 2010 and also 
in 2011.  In 2011 in Idaho, Monsanto obtained environmental permits for a new mine to replace 
its existing mine.

In the rest of the world, new mines are planned in the years ahead in a number of 
countries, including China and Morocco.  Recently, Saudi Arabia's Ma'aden fertilizer complex 
began operating using phosphate rock produced at a new mine estimated to have the potential to 
produce 5 Mtpa of phosphate rock.

25.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 The Paris Hills Property contains significant phosphate mineralization in sufficient 
quantities and of sufficient grade to be attractive for mining under current market conditions, 
notwithstanding the risk inherent to proving and developing any mining property.  The LPZ 
represents the principal mining target.  The UPZ represents a secondary mining target.  
Vanadium represents upside mining potential.   

Within this Technical Report, only the Mineral Resources were updated due to additional 
drilling and assaying.  The LPZ resource was updated with the addition of seven new holes 
drilled since the March 2012 PFS and the UPZ resource was added as a new Mineral Resource, 
upgraded from an Exploration Target.  The Mineral Reserves, mine plan, capital and operating 
costs, and economic analysis remain unchanged as reported in the PFS and the 26 March 2012 
NI 43-101 Technical Report.  

The PFS analysis concludes that the LPZ room-and-pillar Project is economical.  The 
crushed ROM phosphate rock concentrate product should be salable.  The PFS determines that 
steady-state annual production rates of 900,000 t to 1.0 Mt with an average life-of-project ore 
grade of 29.4% P2O5 should be achievable given the mining assumptions used in the PFS.    
Annual ore grade ranges between 28.6% and 31.9% P2O5.  Other primary ore grade parameters 
are within acceptable limits for phosphate rock concentrate markets.  Minor elements have not 
been fully evaluated. 

There is sufficient data from the exploration program to support the geologic 
interpretations of the mineral deposit on the PHA property that were used in the PFS.  
Determinations of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves were based on Carlson Software's 
Geologic Module (Carlson 2011) and the mine projections, scheduling, and production tonnes 
and ore grade were based on Carlson's Underground Mining Module (Carlson 2011).  This 
software is a commonly used mine planning software for bedded (tabular) deposits.  Exploration 
Targets were identified for future consideration. 

 Adequate preliminary design, permitting requirements, hydrogeologic, and marketing 
analyses were conducted to support establishing Project mining methods, mining equipment, and 
infrastructure requirements at the PFS level.  Estimates of capital and operating costs were 
obtained to determine the LPZ is an economically viable project, given the assumptions 
identified in the PFS.  Ten percent economic sensitivities were analyzed on market FOB mine 
price, capital and operating costs, and annual production levels to determine the degree of impact 
each has on the Project's economics, and also the combined impact.  The sensitivity analyses 
concluded that the Project is economical with all scenarios evaluated generating positive NPV 
values. 

 Several geologic factors make the mining operation technically challenging.  Likewise, 
permitting requirements are key to Project scheduling.   

 Additional drilling is required to expand the reserves on the Property.  Additional 
geotechnical information and analysis is required to refine the mine plan, and operating and 
capital costs to the FS level.  Further analysis and research is necessary for hydrogeology, project 
permitting, and meeting regulatory requirements.

26.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 

 The LPZ continues to warrant evaluation of the base case, direct ship, room-and-pillar 
mining scenario and associated tradeoffs at the FS level7 to advance the Paris Hills Underground 
Mine Project to development.  In July 2012, Stonegate commissioned an FS of this scenario and 
its associated tradeoffs.  The FS is slated for completion in December 2012.  Recommendations 
for the FS and ongoing project development are as follows: 

26.1 Geology/Exploration  

The Property is substantially drilled and the deposit generally well defined.  Limited 
additional drilling is recommended for refining the technical understanding in some parts of the 
deposit prior to mining, particularly areas suspect of hosting faults and/or landslides.  Also, a 
limited number of infill exploration holes should be completed to elevate the remainder of the 
horizontal limb LPZ and UPZ to an M&I Resource.  Step-out drilling is further recommended to 
define the eastern fault-bound limit of the deposit and western upturned limit of the horizontal 
limb.  Between six and ten deeper holes to the north and two to four shallow holes to the 
southeast are suggested for improving geologic definition; however, none are considered critical 
for advancement of the Project through the FS. 

 Estimated cost is $1.5 to $2 million. 

26.2 Seismic Surveying 

Two- or three-dimensional high-resolution seismic surveying is recommended for 
identifying faulting, landslides, scours, and other structural features of significance to mining.  
The tradeoff between 2D and 3D costs and technical value requires evaluation.  Even though the 
resolution is similar, 3D seismic surveying is preferred from a technical perspective for enhanced 
structural understanding, which is critical for final mine planning for this Project.  The seismic 
survey program is recommended prior to final mine planning and development. 

Estimated cost is $1.5 million to $2.0 million. 

26.3 Geotechnical 

Substantial geotechnical testing has been completed in the LPZ over the Property.  Two- 
and/or three-dimensional geomechanical modeling is advised for finalizing feasibility design.   

Additional bulk density and in situ moisture testing of the LPZ and UPZ material is 
recommended.  In situ stress measurements are recommended for characterizing stress conditions 
relevant to mine design and ground control.  Sigra oriented horizontal stress testing should be 
reevaluated if suitable strata can be identified. 

Estimated cost is $30,000 to $100,000.

26.4 Mining Management, Design and Equipment 

PHA should refine the room-and-pillar mine plans based on the results of structural 
geology and geotechnical analysis.  Potential refinements to mine scheduling to enhance ore 
grade and improve economics should be investigated.  Additional in-depth section productivity 
and belt conveyor analysis should be undertaken.   

PHA should visit major equipment vendors and discuss mine-specific requirements and 
equipment modifications necessary for mining conditions at the Project site.  PHA should obtain 
new pricing quotations based on specific models and options.  

Sufficient detailed design engineering for infrastructure facilities should be completed to 
increase the capital and operating cost confidence to a FS level. 

 Conduct methane desorption testing on at least one core hole. 

 Estimated cost is $400,000 to $500,000. 

26.5 Processing 

Conduct a second phase of fertilizer testing for the LPZ (variability testing). 

Estimated cost is up to $250,000. 

26.6 Project Permitting and Regulatory Agencies 

 Proceed with environmental and other regulatory requirements per the following 
activities: 

 Continue and expand environmental baseline studies. 

 Update and expand to a Traffic Study the Rte 89 traffic assessment in support of the mine 
access road. 

 Review NEPA requirements based on the specific Project elements. 

 Consult with key agencies on the development of a study plan for collecting hydrological 
and hydrogeological data. 

 Form an informal task group comprising representatives from each of the key agencies to 
review the baseline data program and groundwater/geochemical modeling exercises. 

 Select a permitting strategy and initiate the operating permit process. 

PHA should conduct Project review meetings with all potentially involved regulatory 
agencies to ensure that permitting and plan requirements are understood.  These include 
applicable federal, state, and local agencies.  Areas to be discussed in detail include: 

 MSHA mine plan and approval requirements, including dams and sediment pond 
designs 

 Clean Water Act 401 and 404 permits

Prepared for Stonegate Agricom Ltd.  
15 August 2012   Page 159 
 

Agapito Associates, Inc. 

 County conditional use permits 
 Sanitary sewage treatment plant permits 
 IDEP requirements 
 EPA requirements 
 IDWR requirements 
 Idaho Transportation Department requirements 
 Other local agencies  

 
Estimated cost is $1.5 million to $3.0 million. 

26.7 Utilities 

PHA should consult with public utilities to establish rates for the FS. 

26.8 Hydrogeologic, Groundwater, and Rock Geochemistry Analysis 

 Improve the hydrogeologic and groundwater data base and technical understanding with 
the following activities: 

 Continue monitoring groundwater levels in the Rex Chert and Grandeur Tongue/Wells 
Formation at installed VWP locations. 

 Finalize the groundwater monitoring plan and install four to five monitoring wells to 
provide water level, water quality, and permeability data for the Project area.  The wells 
should target the Rex Chert and Grandeur Tongue/Wells Formation. 

 Conduct a pumping test to improve confidence in permeability estimates for the Wells 
Formation.  The test location targets the Consolidated Fault.  Data from the pumping test 
will be used to refine mine inflow estimates. 

 Continue to evaluate sites for infiltration basins and injection wells for mine water disposal. 
Develop a plan for injection wells and any testing to support a groundwater injection 
system. 

 Refine the surface and underground water balance to define pumping, piping, pond 
retention, and water treatment requirements for the mine dewatering and groundwater 
injection systems. 

 Finalize the geochemistry characterization plan and initiate testing for whole rock 
elemental analysis, acid-base accounting (ABA), synthetic precipitation leaching 
procedures (SPLP), and column leaching tests.  Geochemical testing should focus on the 
potential mining horizons and the adjacent wall rocks that may be produced as ore or mine 
rock and is intended to generate baseline data for permitting.  Evaluation of minor elements 
is part of that scope. 

Estimated cost is $2 million to $3 million.

26.9 Marketing 

Continue marketing development with negotiations to define and pinpoint phosphate rock 
marketing alternatives. 

Determine the preferred transportation method and required infrastructure.  If rail 
transport is required, update the rail loadout option to align with the UP's 30% design stage and 
pursue further engineering design and commitment to UP pending market evaluations. 

Estimated cost is $50,000 to $100,000. 

26.10 Community and Government Relations 

 Continue to foster stakeholder support for development of the Paris Hills Project.  
Specifically, continue with community meetings to inform the public at local and state levels of 
project development and plans. 

26.11 Risk Management 

 Develop a risk management plan and conduct a risk matrix analysis on all identified risk 
categories and major subcategories.   

 Estimated cost is $30,000 to $50,000. 

 The total estimated cost of the above recommended tasks ranges from $7 million to 
$11 million.    

26.12 Other Work 

 Additional recommendations for exploration and development are identified below.   
These tasks are forward-looking and remain independent of the LPZ FS: 

 Upper Phosphate Zone—Complete a PEA of room-and-pillar mining in the horizontal 
limb of the UPZ.  Estimated cost is $100,000 to $300,000. 

 Vanadium Zone—Analyze the VZ to evaluate the upside potential of V2O5 coproduction 
with phosphate mining.  Estimated cost is $30,000 to $100,000. 

 Upturned Limb Phosphate Resource Estimate—Conduct an exploration drilling 
program on the upturned limb and generate an NI 43-101 compliant TR resource estimate 
of the upturned limb.   Estimated cost is $1 million. 

 Northern Exploration—The phosphate resource remains open to the north at potentially 
mineable depths.  Future exploration to the north off the Property is warranted.  
Numerical modeling is recommended for evaluating mining potential under deep cover 
exceeding 1,000 m.  Estimated exploration cost is $500,000 to $1,000,000. 

 Land—Continue with the acquisition of key properties needed for the surface facilities 
and infrastructure.  Estimated cost is $2.5 million to $3 million.
