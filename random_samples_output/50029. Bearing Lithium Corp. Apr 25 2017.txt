1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Bearing Resources Ltd. ("Bearing") is a TSX-V listed junior exploration company. Bearing 

is proposing to acquire 100% of the common shares of Li3 Energy Inc. ("Li3") and 100% 

of LI3's interests in the salar de Maricunga lithium brine project ("Maricunga project") in 

northern Chile. Li3 is an OTCB-listed junior exploration company. As a result of the 

acquisition of Li3, Bearing will assume Li3's 17.7% interest in the salar de Maricunga Joint 

Venture project ("Maricunga JV"), described in more detail below.  

 

LI3 has been exploring on the salar de Maricunga since 2010. LI3 acquired its original 

interest in mineral tenements on the salar de Maricunga by way of acquisition of a 60% 

interest in the Litio 1-6 tenements ("Litio 1-6 claims") on May 20, 2011. These tenements 

total 1,439 ha.  

 

On August 25, 2011, LI3 announced a strategic partnership with POSCO Canada Ltd. 

("POSCAN"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of POSCO, a South Korean multinational 

company. The strategic partnership provided for POSCAN to invest an initial $US 8 million 

in LI3 by way of purchase of common stock, and follow-on investment rights plus rights for 

POSCAN and LI3 to test POSCO's proprietary direct lithium extraction and lithium 

carbonate production technology using brine from Li3's Maricunga property. As a result of 

the initial investment, POSCAN obtained a 30% interest in LI3. 

  

Subsequent to the initial POSCAN investment, Li3 undertook an exploration program on 

the Litio 1-6 tenements in 2011-12 and completed a program of geophysical exploration, 

sonic core drilling (6 holes to 150 m), reverse circulation drilling (915 m), Relative Brine 

Release Capacity ("RBRC") testing, brine sampling, trenching, air lift testing and 

development of pumping wells (2 wells to 150 m). A resource estimate was completed in 

May, 2012 under the direction of the author and resources estimated in accordance with 

the CIM Best Practice mineral resource estimation guidelines of the Canadian Institute of 

Mining and Metallurgy ("CIM"), the requirements outlined in the Ontario Securities Staff 

Notice 43-704, and the CIM Best Practice Guidelines for Reporting Brine Resources and 

Reserves as prepared by the author.  

 

The current report is designed support the disclosure of the 2012 historic resource 

estimate for Litio 1-6 tenements as a current resource mineral in conformance with the 

requirements of NI 43-101. 

 

The Maricunga JV will prepare an updated resource estimate when the results of the 

2016/7 field program become available by June 2017.

1.2 Property History 

LI3 has been exploring on the salar de Maricunga since 2010. LI3 acquired its original 

interest in mineral tenements on the salar de Maricunga by way of acquisition of a 60% 

interest in the Litio 1-6 tenements ("Litio 1-6 claims") on May 20, 2011. These tenements 

total 1,439 ha.  

 

On April 16, 2013, Li3 acquired 100% of SLM Cocina 19-27 de la Sierra Hoyada de 

Maricunga (the "Cocina claims"), a Chilean-based company. The Cocina tenements 

comprise 450 ha immediately to the north and adjacent to the Litio 1-6 claims. The Cocina 

claims were originally registered under the 1932 Chilean mining code and are 

"grandfathered" with respect to lithium production under current Chilean mining law and 

regulations. 

 

On November 5, 2013 Li3 announced an agreement with Minera Salar Blanco SpA 

("MSB") for MSB to acquire 51% of Li3' Chilean subsidiary Li Energy SpA (the holder of 

the Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 claims) in return for specified funding of Li3's exploration 

program. Property interests were transferred to a new company Minera Li SpA ("Minera 

Li"), held 51% by MSB and 49% by Li3. Minera Li held in turn a 60% interest in the Litio 

1-6 claims and a 100% interest in the Cocina 19-27 claims. Separately, individuals 

associated with MSB held a 36% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims. A 4% interest in the Litio 

1-6 tenements is held by private individuals in Chile. The current ownership structure of 

the tenements is illustrated in Figure 1.1:

In 2015, MSB on behalf of Minera Li and Li3, undertook a program of geophysical work 

across the whole of the salar de Maricunga and long term pumping tests on two wells (P1 

and P2) located on the Litio 1-6 claims which had been drilled by Li3 during its 2011-12 

exploration program. . 

  

In 2016 MSB, Lithium Power International Ltd ("LPI"), an ASX-listed junior exploration 

company, and Li3 agreed to a merger to form a new company ("Newco") whereby LPI 

would become the operator and 50% owner (upon completion of required exploration and 

development expenditures totalling $US 15 million) of assets comprising the Litio 1-6 

claims, the Cocina 19-27 claims, three concessions (San Francisco, Despreciada and 

Salamina) previously held under option by MSB, which option was purchased and 

exercised by LPI in 2016, and other tenements at Salar de Maricunga held by MSB and 

used for an exploration camp and planned area for evaporation ponds and process plant. 

MSB will hold 32.37% of Newco and Li3 will hold 17.67% of Newco. Newco will hold 96% 

of the Litio 1-6 claims, 100% of the Cocina claims and 100% of the San Francisco, 

Despreciada and Salamina claims ("Salar de Maricunga JV Tenements"). Both MSB and 

Li3 participate on a free carry basis in property exploration until the completion of a 

Definitive Feasibility Study ("DFS") on the project.  

 

On January 31, 2017 Bearing announced the signing of a definitive agreement and plan 

of merger with Li3 Energy under which Bearing agreed to acquire 100% of the common 

shares of LI3 and 100% of Li3's interest in the Maricunga JV project for consideration of 

16 million shares of Bearing plus the assumption of certain debts/liabilities of LI3 to a 

maximum of US$ 2 million. This transaction will represent a fundamental change in the 

nature of Bearings' business, which has been gold exploration. Bearing will form a wholly-

owned subsidiary which will merge with Li3 and in which Li3 will be the surviving entity as 

a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bearing. Shares of Li3 common stock will be converted to 

common shares in Bearing based upon an aggregate of 16 million Bearing common 

shares issuable for the Li3 common stock.

1.4  Conclusions  

The Maricunga tenements held by Li3 and being acquired by Bearing are located 

approximately 160 km northeast of Copiapo in the III Region of northern Chile at an 

elevation of approximately 3,760 masl. The original Li3 project tenements (as of 2012) 

comprise 1,439 ha as six mineral claims known as Litio 1- 6 located in the northeast 

section of the Salar de Maricunga. The  Cocina 19-27 tenements (450 ha) were acquired 

in 2013.  Adjacent tenements held by LPI and MSB make up an additional 2,575 ha. These 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

1-6 | P a g e  
 

comprise the San Francisco, Salamina and Despreciada tenements on the salar (675 ha) 

and the Blanco and Camap tenemenets (1,900 ha), all of which were acquired between 

2014 and 2015. Thus the total tenement package comprising the Salar de Maricunga JV 

tenements is 4,464 ha, of which Bearing will hold an effective 17.7% interest.  

 

The Maricunga basin comprises a large drainage basin with an area of approximating 

2,200 km2. It is structurally controlled to the west by mountains which have been raised by 

inverse faults that expose a basement sequence ranging in age from Upper Paleozoic to 

Lower Tertiary.  To the southeast, the basin limit coincides with the Chilean-Argentine 

frontier, which is defined by a line of volcanic complexes with elevations up to 6,749 m 

(Nevada Tres Cruces) and a range of ages between 26 Ma and 6 Ma. Some of the volcanic 

complexes are associated with the characteristically auriferous mineralization of the 

Maricunga Belt. The eastern limit of the basin is marked by the Cordillera Claudio Gay, a 

North-South trending mountain chain resting on a basement of Middle to Upper Paleozoic 

rocks and exposing deformed volcanoclastic sequences of Upper Oligocene to Lower 

Miocene rocks which represent remnants of the volcanic arc preserved on the margins of 

the Maricunga basin. 

 

The Salar de Maricunga is located in the northern part of the Maricunga basin and covers 

some 140 km2.  The Salar is surrounded by alluvial deposits on the north, east and south, 

and by volcanic deposits on the west.  

 

Salar de Maricunga is classified as a mixed type salar of the Na-Cl-Ca/SO4 system. The 

brines from Maricunga are solutions saturated in sodium chloride with total dissolved 

solids (TDS) of 26% (316 g/L) as an average, although in most areas exceeding 27%. The 

average density is 1.200 g/cm3. The lithium content in the brine typically exceeds 1,200 

mg/L. The other components present in these brines, which constitute an aqueous 

complex system and exist also in other natural brines in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile are 

the following: K, Li, Mg, Ca, SO4, HCO3 and B, which below pH 7 exists predominantly as 

un-dissociated H3BO3. Interesting values of strontium (mean of 290 mg/L) also have been 

detected by ICP analysis in the Maricunga brine. Table 1.2 provides an overview of the 

key components and ratios for the Maricunga brine for the Litio 1-6 claims.

The Salar itself is in-filled with alternating sequences of evaporates and clastic sediments. 

The salar exhibits a typical halo structure for a semi-mature salar with clastic sediments 

on the periphery, transitioning to a halite nucleus. As is typical for such mixed-type salars, 

clastic sediments underlie and interbed with the halite.  Results of drilling carried out on 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

1-7 | P a g e  
 

the Litio 1-6 tenements indicate the presence of an upper mixed halite sequence that 

consists of highly fractured-to-massive halite beds and halite mixed with clay and silt-sized 

sediments with a combined thickness from 3 m to 66 m.  This upper zone is underlain by 

a sequence of silt and clays that are inter-bedded with coarser grained sands, gravels, 

conglomerates, and volcanic ashes.   The deepest hole drilled in 2011 on the Litio 1-6  

property to 192 m did not insect bedrock. Drilling in 2016 by LPI on the Cocina 19-27 

tenements showed a similar lithologic profile to the Litio 1-6 tenements. Drilling undertaken 

in 2016/17 by LPI on the Cocina claims shows the clastic zone extends to at least 360 m 

depth. Drilling by LPI in 2016/17 on the San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina 

tenements indicates the lithology is dominated by fine-to-coarse grained sands, with some 

overlying halite beds and that coarse grained, highly porous sediments extend to depths 

of at least 360 m from surface. 

 

Li3's 2011 exploration drilling campaign was designed to carry out drilling on a specified 

grid to allow the estimation of measured "in-situ" brine resources over the Litio 1-6 mineral 

claims in Salar de Maricunga.   The drilling method selected was based on the need to 

allow for the collection of continuous core from which "undisturbed" samples at specified 

depth intervals could be prepared for laboratory porosity analyses and for the collection of 

depth-representative brine samples at specified depth intervals without possibility of 

contamination by drilling fluids.  

 

Six sonic boreholes were completed to a depth of 150 m. Undisturbed samples were 

collected from the sonic core at three meter intervals for porosity analyses (318 samples).  

Brine samples were collected during the sonic drilling at three meter intervals for chemistry 

analyses (431 primary main samples and 192 QA/QC samples).  All sonic boreholes were 

completed as observation wells on completion of drilling. 

 

A total of 915 m of exploration RC drilling was carried out for the collection of chip samples 

for geologic logging, brine samples for chemistry analyses and airlift data to assess 

relative aquifer permeability. The RC boreholes were completed as observation wells for 

use during future pumping tests. Two test production wells were installed to a total depth 

of 150 m each for future pumping trials, which were completed in 2015. 

A seismic tomography survey was carried out (23 line km) to help define basin lithology 

and basin geometry. Six test trenches were completed to a depth of 3 m to carry out 

shallow pumping trials.  24 hour pumping tests were carried out in each trench. 

 

Results of drainable porosity (specific yield) testing carried out by Daniel B Stephens 

Laboratory in the USA as part of LI3's 2011 exploration program indicate that the upper 

halite mixed zone on the Litio 1-6 claims has an average drainable porosity of 3.4 percent, 

the sand mix units have an average porosity of 6.1 and the silt –clay mixed layers 1.2 

percent. Results of six pumping tests carried out in 2011 on the upper halite mix zone 

within the Litio 1-6 claims indicate average specific yield values of 20 percent and an 

average hydraulic conductivity of 89 m/d, indicative of very permeable conditions in the 

upper brine aquifer. Pumping test data (P1 and P2 wells) from 2015 on the Litio 1-6 claims 

indicates pumping rates of 35 L/sec – 37 L/sec are possible from the lower aquifer zone, 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

1-8 | P a g e  
 

while pumping tests completed in 2016/17 on the Cocina 19-27 claims (P4 well) show 

pumping rates of 25 L/sec from the lower aquifer zone.  

 

Table 1.3 summarizes the resource estimate for the Litio 1-6 mineral claims in Salar de 

Maricunga. This estimate is based on the results of the 2011 exploration program 

completed by Li3 and supervised by the author. Based on drilling and exploration results 

of the 2011 campaign the brine deposit remains open in all directions beyond the 

boundaries of the Litio 1-6 claims and at depth. No changes in the available data and 

analysis have occurred since 2012, as confirmed by the December 27, 2016 site visit by 

the author. The author has confirmed the 2012 data and analysis is appropriate for use in 

a resource estimate.

Results of airlift testing during the RC exploration drilling program and pumping tests on 

test trenches indicate that future brine production can be achieved through a combination 

of production wells and open trenches. The analyses of brine chemistry indicate that the 

brine is amenable to lithium and potash recovery through conventional solar evaporation  

technology.   It is believed that through the application of proprietary technology developed 

by one of Li3's strategic partners (POSCO), lithium recovery from the Maricunga brine can 

be significantly enhanced. Pilot scale test work undertaken in 2012/13 demonstrated 

lithium recoveries in excess of 70%. 

 

Exploration work undertaken in 2015 and in 2016/2017 by MSB and LPI has confirmed 

that the high lithium brine grades established on the Litio 1-6 claims from the 2011 

exploration program extend beyond the limits of the Litio 1-6 claims to the other tenements 

held by the LPI-MSB-Li3 joint-venture. Pumping tests data obtained from the 2015 and 

2016/2017 exploration programs confirms high pumping rates can be achieved on the Litio 

1-6 tenements and on the adjacent Cocina 19-27 tenements. The available data indicate 

the upper halite zone can be represented by an unconfined aquifer, while the lower mixed 

clay/halite/gravel zone is best represented by a semi-confined/confined aquifer. Brine 

grades show consistent values in excess of 1,000 mg/L lithium. The available data indicate 

high pumping rates and high lithium brine values are likely to extend to the San Francisco, 

Despreciada and Salamina tenements comprising the balance of the Maricunga project.   

 

LPI has completed preliminary evaporation tests on brine obtained from well P1 on the 

Litio 1-6 tenements. The brine was subjected to pond evaporation tests using a ten pond 

system. Test work commenced in Q4/16. Results to date (LPI press release dated Feb. 

24, 2017) show the brine was evaporating at good rates with brine concentration 

increasing from an initial 1,260 mg/L lithium to 6,300 mg/L lithium over a 3-month period, 

with associated precipitation of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl). The 

available data confirmed the calculated evaporation pathway based on the 2011/12 test 

work and the potential to produce a high grade concentrated lithium brine suitable for 

subsequent lithium carbonate production.  

 

1.5 Recommendations 

It is recommended Bearing participate in technical planning discussions related to future 

exploration activity for the salar de Maricunga JV project. No other exploration 

recommendations are provided in the current Technical Report as the exploration 

programs are under the management and control of LPI, with Bearing maintaining a free 

carry interest in the project until completion of a Definitive Feasibility Study, expected in 

2018.

As discussed in Section 1.3, above, LPI, MSB and Li3 are proposing to form a joint-venture 

to combine their respective tenements on Maricunga (see Figure 1.2). The properties 

comprising  the JV are illustrated in Figure 1.3. Bearing, by way of the acquisition of Li3, 

will hold a 17.7% interest in the overall Maricunga JV project. Table 1.1 details the 

tenement contributions of the JV participants. 

 

Existing infrastructure 

Local infrastructure at the salar includes National Highway 31 and an electrical power line 

running parallel to the highway. There is a customs post at the north end of the Salar which 

is staffed on a 24-hour basis. The customs post is located approximately 30 km from the 

border with Argentina. Copiapo is located approximately 160 km west from the property. 

A full range of mining related services is available in Copiapo.  

 

History 

SLM Litio, a Chilean company, acquired the Litio 1 – 6 concessions in 2004. Numerous 

other claim holders, including Codelco and SQM, have extensive holdings on the Salar 

adjacent to and to the south of the Litio 1-6 claims. Li3 acquired a 60% interest in the Litio 

1-6 concessions effective May 20, 2011.  

 

Li3 acquired a 100% interest in the Cocina 19-27 claims on April 16, 2013.  

 

On November 5, 2013 Li3 announced an agreement with Minera Salar Blanco SpA 

("MSB") for MSB to acquire 51% of Li3' Chilean subsidiary Li Energy SpA (the holder of 

the Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 claims) in return for specified funding of Li3's exploration 

program. Property interests were transferred to a new company Minera Li SpA ("Minera 

Li"), held 51% by MSB and 49% by Li3. Minera Li held in turn a 60% interest in the Litio 

1-6 claims and a 100% interest in the Cocina 19-27 claims. Separately, MSB held a 36% 

interest in the Litio 1-6 claims, with 4% being retained by private individuals. 

 

In 2016 MSB, Lithium Power International Ltd ("LPI") and Li3 agreed to a merger to form 

a new company ("Newco", now Minera Salar Blanco) whereby LPI would become the 

operator and 50% owner of assets comprising the Litio 1-6 claims, the Cocina 19-27 claims 

and three concessions (San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina) previously held under 

option by MSB. MSB will hold 32.37% of Newco and Li3 will hold 17.67% of Newco. Newco 

will hold 96% of the Litio 1-6 claims, 100% of the Cocina claims and 100% of the San 

Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina claims ("Salar de Maricunga JV Tenements"), as 

well as tenements known as Blanco and camp. These latter tenements are located off the 

salar proper and are held as areas for construction of the evaporation ponds, process 

plant and camp facilities. Both MSB and Li3 participate on a free carry basis in property 

exploration until the completion of a Definitive Feasibility Study ("DFS") on the project by 

LPI. 

 

On January 31, 2017 Bearing announced the signing of a definitive agreement and plan 

of merger, effective January 27, 2017, with Li3 Energy under which Bearing has agreed 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

1-12 | P a g e  
 

to acquire 100% of the common shares of Li3 and 100% of Li3's  interests in the salar de 

Maricunga JV project and property. Bearing will form a wholly-owned subsidiary which will 

merge with Li3 and in which Li3 will be the surviving entity as a wholly-owned subsidiary 

of Bearing. Shares of Li3 common stock will be converted to common shares in Bearing 

based upon an aggregate of 16 million Bearing common shares issuable for the Li3 

common stock, plus assumption of a maximum of $US 2 million in debt owed by Li3. 

 

Geology and mineralization 

The Salar de Maricunga is an intermediate type salar of the Na-Cl-Ca/SO4 system.  

Maricunga compares favourably to other salars within the Chilean-Argentinian altiplano 

region as illustrated by Table 1.6 and Figure 1.3.

Exploration status 

The Maricunga project is classified as an Exploration Project.  

Mineral resources 

Historical resource estimates for the property have been based on surface sampling and 

shallow drilling. These estimates are detailed in Tables 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5. The historical 

results show high lithium values in excess of 1,000 g/L and good potassium values. A due 

diligence report on the Maricunga prospect prepared by the author (Hains, 2010) for Li3 

classified Maricunga as a "Property of Merit" worthy of additional exploration. 

 

Mineral resources on the Litio 1-6 concessions as of March 17, 2017 are detailed in Table 

1.7. The author has confirmed the historic data used for the resource estimate and 

considers the data suitable for use in a resource estimate in conformance with the 

requirements of NI 43-101.  

 

There are no mineral resource estimates for the Cocina 19-27 concessions, nor for the 

San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina claims forming part of the salar de Maricunga 

JV Tenements.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 
2. The Qualified Person for this Mineral Resource estimate is Donald H. Hains, P. Geo.  
3. The current resource estimate is based on data available as of April 17, 2012.  No additional 

exploration data having been obtained, and the original data having been confirmed by a Qualified 
Person, the 2012 data are considered suitable for use in a resource estimate. 

4. This estimate has been prepared in conformance with the requirements of NI 43-101 
5. No cut-off grade is applicable to brine resources, as discussed in CIM Best Practice Guidelines for 

Resources and Reserve Estimation for Lithium Brines.  
6. Numbers may not add due to rounding 

 7. Calculated using a conversion factor of 5.32, Li to LCE 
 

Mineral reserves 

No mineral reserves have been estimated for the any of the concessions comprising the 

salar de Maricunga JV Tenements.  

 

Mining method 

Results of airlift testing during the RC exploration drilling program and pumping tests on 

test trenches indicate that future brine production can likely be achieved through a 

combination of production wells and open trenches. 

 

Mineral processing 

No mineral processing flow sheet has been developed for the project. Test work completed 

to date indicates conventional solar evaporation methods will be used for brine 

concentration, followed by conventional brine purification and precipitation of lithium as 

lithium carbonate as practiced elsewhere in Chile. 

 

Project infrastructure 

Project infrastructure for development of the project has not yet been defined. 

 

Market studies 

Third party market forecasts project a robust demand for lithium and lithium derivatives.

Environmental, permitting and social considerations 

The Maricunga JV project manager, LPI, is currently undertaking various studies related 

to environmental, permitting and community relations. The impact of the results of these 

studies on the project is unknown. 

 

Capital and operating cost estimates 

Preliminary capital and operating cost estimates for development of the project were 

prepared in 2014 to demonstrate the Litio 1-6 tenements had reasonable prospects for 

eventual economic extraction. These estimates have been reviewed and a determination 

made that the estimates remain valid. 

 

Known Legal, Environmental, and Political Risks 

Exploitation of lithium brine resources in Chile is regulated by the Chilean government. At 

the present time, the Chilean government specifies that any new lithium brine production 

be undertaken in partnership with the state. Lithium production will be controlled through 

the issuance of concession licenses for stated volumes of production at terms to be 

specified in the contracts.  

 

It is to be noted that mineral tenements held under the 1932 mining code, such as the 

Cocina 19-27 tenements, and the San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina tenements 

held by LPI and forming part of the Maricunga JV, are not subject to special concession 

licenses

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Objectives 

This report (the "Report") was commissioned by Mr. Jeremy Poirier, Chief Executive 

Officer of Bearing Resources Ltd.  This report has been prepared in conformance with the 

requirements of National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects 

and the associated Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1 of the Canadian 

Securities Administrators (modified June 24, 2011) and the associated Best Practice 

Guidelines for Industrial Minerals and Mineral Processing as issued by the Canadian 

Institute of Mining and Metallurgy ("CIM").  The Report also includes technical judgment 

of appropriate additional technical parameters to accommodate certain specific 

characteristics of minerals hosted in liquid brine as outlined in Ontario Securities 

Commission Staff Notice 43-704 and the CIM Best Practice Guidelines for Reporting Brine 

Resources and Reserves as prepared by the author. The current resource estimate 

detailed in this report is for lithium and potassium contained in brine within the Litio 1-6 

tenements to be held by Bearing as a result of the acquisition of LI3.  

 

2.2 Sources of information 

The information, conclusions, opinions, and estimates contained in this Report are based 

on:

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location and property dimensions 

The Maricunga property is located approximately 160 km northeast of Copiapo in the III 

Region of northern Chile at an elevation of approximately 3,800 masl. Figure 4.1 shows 

the location of the Project.  The property is more particularly described as being centered 

at approximately UTM Zone 19 493000 E, 7025000 N (PSAD '56 datum). The property as 

of 2017 comprises 1,438 ha as six mineral claims known as Litio 1 through Litio 6 and 450 

ha known the Cocina 19-27 claims. The claims are located in the northeast section of the 

Salar de Maricunga (Figure 4.2) 

 

4.2 Tenure 

The Li3 Litio 1-6 property acquired by Bearing is held as six mineral concessions (minas) 

registered under the names Sociedades Legales Mineras ("SLM Litio") LITIO 1 de la Sierra 

Hoyada de Maricunga, LITIO 2 de la Sierra Hoyada de Maricunga, LITIO 3 de la Sierra 

Hoyada de Maricunga, LITIO 4 de la Sierra Hoyada de Maricunga, LITIO 5 de la Sierra 

Hoyada de Maricunga y LITIO 6 de la Sierra Hoyada Maricunga. Each of the claims is 

subdivided into minas of varying size. The Cocina 19-27 property is registered under the 

name Sociedades Legales Mineras Cocina 19-27 de la Sierra Hoyada de Maricunga and 

comprises 9 pertenencias (claims) of 50 ha each. (Table 4.1 and Figure 4.2).  The 

properties are held as Exploitation Mining Concessions.  

 

The Litio 1-6 tenements are governed by the 1982 mining law, while the Cocina 19-27 

tenements are governed by the 1932 mining law and are thus available for lithium 

production without reference to current Chilean government policy respecting lithium brine 

development.

The Litio 1-6 claims are legally incorporated and registered, with the claims being 

published in the national register.  Baker and McKenzie Attorneys at Law in Santiago, 

Chile prepared a legal opinion dated March 13, 2012 respecting the Litio 1-6 tenements 

listed in Table 4.1 which states that:  

 
"The Mining Projects Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by the parties 
thereto and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of all parties, enforceable 
against them in accordance with their terms.  

 
All titles of the Mining Tenements (set out Table 4.1) are in good standing, with all the 
corresponding licenses being duly paid, and there are no encumbrances on such Mining 
Tenements." 

 

No formal legal title opinion has been obtained with respect to the Cocina 19-27 claims. 

Li3 has represented that the Cocina claims are in good standing, are duly registered and 

that Minera Li Energy holds good title. The author has reviewed canon payment receipts 

and certified copies of claim registration files and is satisfied as to title ownership for both 

the Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 tenements. 

 

The property consists of an area in the northeast of the nucleus of the salar and thus all 

of the property can be considered to be mineralized. The property is bordered on the north 

and east by a national highway which provides access to Argentina. An electrical power 

line runs parallel to the highway. There are no known environmental liabilities associated 

with the property.  

 
Annual canon payments (concession fees) on the individual minas are due by the end of 

March in each year. Receipts for canon payments indicates all are current. Canón 

payments total CLP 2,410,552 ($US 3,654) per annum. 

 
On November 5, 2013 Li3 announced an agreement with Minera Salar Blanco ("MSB") for 

MSB to acquire 51% of Li3' Chilean subsidiary Li Energy SpA (the holder of the Litio 1-6 

and Cocina 19-27 claims) in return for specified funding of Li3's exploration program. 

Property interests were transferred to a new company Minera Li SpA, held 51% by MSB 

and 49% by Li3. Minera Li held in turn a 60% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims and a 100% 

interest in the Cocina 19-27 claims. Separately, individuals associated with MSB held a 

36% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims. The remaining 4% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims is 

held by several individuals.

In 2016 MSB, Lithium Power International Ltd ("LPI") and Li3 agreed to a merger to form 

a new company ("Newco") whereby LPI would become the operator and 50% owner of 

assets comprising the Litio 1-6 claims, the Cocina 19-27 claims and three concessions 

(San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina) previously held under option by MSB. MSB 

will hold 32.37% of Newco and Li3 will hold 17.67% of Newco. Newco will hold 96% of the 

Litio 1-6 claims, 100% of the Cocina claims and 100% of the San Francisco, Despreciada 

and Salamina claims ("salar de Maricunga JV Tenements"). Both MSB and Li3 

participate on a free carry basis in property exploration until the completion of a Definitive 

Feasibility Study ("DFS") on the project. 

 

The current tenement package and tenement status comprising the Maricunga JV project

4.3 Permits 

Li3 obtained the necessary permits from the Servicio Nacional de Geologia y Mineria 

(Sernageomin) of the III Region in Copiapo on May, 20 2011 to initiate exploration 

activities on the Litio 1-6 claims for an indefinite period of time. The Cocina claims are fully 

permitted for exploration and are available for production subject to submission of the 

required environmental permits.  

4.4 Royalties 

The Chilean government is currently reviewing a future royalaty and permitting regime for 

lithium production. The Maricunga Project JV fully owns its mineral concessions and will 

not be exposed to additional royalty payments to Corporación Fomento a la Producción 

(CORFO), the Chilean state holding company.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Maricunga property is accessed from the city of Copiapo via National Highway 31. 

Highway 31 is paved for approximately one-half of the distance and is a well maintained 

gravel surface road thereafter. National Highway 31 extends through to Argentina via the 

Paseo San Francisco. Access to Maricunga from the city of El Salvador is via a well 

maintained gravel surface highway. Occasional high snowfalls in the mountains may close 

the highways for brief periods during the winter. 

 

5.2 Climate 

5.2.1 Temperature 

The climate at the property is a dry, cold, high altitude desert with cold, dry winters and 

warm, dry summers.  Summer temperatures range from 100C – 200C, with the winter 

daytime temperatures averaging approximately 40c – 00C. The average annual 

temperature at Salar de Maricunga is estimated at 5 – 6 0C as shown in Figure 5.1 (DGA 

2009). 

 

Long-term historical temperature data are not available for the immediate Project area.  

The DGA maintained Lautaro Embalso meteorological station (1,110 masl) located 160 

km southwest of the Project area has average monthly temperature records available for 

the period of 1966 through to date.   

 

A weather station at the Marte Lobo Project site located in the southern extension of the 

Maricunga basin at an elevation of 4,090 masl, (30 km to the south of the Project) has 

average monthly temperature records available for the period between January 1997 and 

December 1998.  Table 5.1 shows average monthly temperature data for the Marte Lobo 

Project (Golder Associates 2011) while Figure 5.1 provides an isotherm map for the salar 

de Maricunga region.

5.2.2 Precipitation 

Precipitation in Salar de Maricunga may occur during the months of January and February 

as a result of "Bolivian winter" effects and during the months of June through September.  

The intensity of these annual rainfall patterns are significantly influenced by the El Nino-

Southern Oscillation. 

   

The nearest long-term historical precipitation records for the Project are available from 

DGA maintained meteorological stations at Las Vegas (70 km northwest) at an elevation 

of 2,250 masl and Pastos Grande (60 km WSW) at an elevation of 2,260 masl.  No long-

term historical precipitation records are available for the III Region above 2,500 masl 

elevation. Table 5.2 provides summary information of the Las Vegas and Pastos Grande 

stations.

Additional rainfall records are available from selected weather stations that are part of the 

"Pilot System for the III Region" operated by the Catolica University of Chile (PUC) in 

conjunction with the DGA.  Table 5.3 provides summary information for the Maricunga and 

Pedernales Sur weather stations.

Figures 5.2a and 5.2b show monthly precipitation records for the Marigunca and 

Pedernales Sur weather stations for the 2007/8 period.  It is believed that these data are 

representative of a relative dry year (DGA 2009).   

 

Precipitation records collected at the Marte Lobo Project weather station during the 

1997/1998 period show an annual cumulative precipitation (rainfall and snowfall water 

equivalent) of 451 mm (Golder Associates 2011).   Further analyses of rainfall records of 

the III Region indicate that the 1997/8 cumulative precipitation coincides with a 100 year 

precipitation event.  Additional precipitation data collected at the Marte and Lobo stations 

between 2009 and 2010 are shown in Figure 5.3. 

 

Average annual precipitation estimates were prepared as part the "Balance Hidrico de 

Chile" (DGA 1987).  Figure 5.4 shows an isohyet map for the Salars de Maricunga and

EDRA (1998) carried out a hydrogeological investigation for the Salar de Maricunga and 

Piedra Pomez areas and described the following precipitation – elevation relationship: 

 

P = 0.038H – 53  

Where: 

P is average annual precipitation (mm); and H is elevation (masl)   

 

Using this correlation the average annual precipitation for Salar de Maricunga is estimated 

at 90 mm.  

 

The DGA (2006) carried out a hydrogeological investigation for Salar de Maricunga in 

which the following precipitation – elevation relationship was developed: 

 

P = 0.1H – 300  

Where: 

P is average annual precipitation (mm); and H is elevation (masl) 

 

Using this correlation the average annual precipitation for Salar de Maricunga is estimated 

at 75 mm.  

 

MSB installed a weather station in Salar de Maricunga in 2016 to validate the results of 

previous precipitation studies and third party data sets.  As of December 27, 2016, the 

weather station is in operation at UTM (PSAD '56) 492071E, 7037978 S (Zone 19J), 

approximately 12 km north of the Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 claims (Figure 5.5)

5.2.3 Solar Radiation 

Solar radiation is the most important energy input for evaporation.  Long-term solar 

radiation data are not available for Salar de Maricunga directly.  Regional solar radiation 

estimates are shown in Figure 5.6 and suggest that solar radiation in Salar de Maricunga 

falls in the range of 1,700 – 1,900 KWh/m2 per year. 

 

Partial solar radiation data are available from the Marte Lobo Project site and are reported 

in AMEC (2011).  Table 5.4 shows monthly records solar radiation records in Watts/m2 for 

the Marte and Lobo stations.

The weather station installed on site is collecting local suite-specific solar radiation data in 

support of the evaporation tests that are currently in progress. 

 

5.2.4 Evaporation 

The DGA (2009) has developed a relationship between elevation and average annual pan 

evaporation based on pan evaporation records from some 40 stations across the I, II, and 

III Regions of northern Chile as shown in Figure 5.8.  Based on this correlation the annual 

average pan evaporation rate for Salar de Maricunga is estimated at 2,400 mm. 

 

FIGURE 5.8: ELEVATION VERSUS AVERAGE ANNUAL PAN EVAPORATION 
 

 
Source: DGA 2009 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

5-10 | P a g e  
 

A similar relationship between elevation and average annual pan evaporation has been 

described by Houston (2006) as follows: 

MAEpan   =  4364 – (0.59*A) 

Where:  MAEpan is mean annual pan evaporation (mm) and A is elevation (m) for 

stations above 1,000 masl.  

 

Using this correlation the mean annual pan evaporation rate for Salar de Maricunga is 

estimated at 2,150 mm.   

 

Houston (2006) further describes the effects of brine density on mean annual pan 

evaporation rates as: 

MAEpan = 10026 – 6993D; where D is fluid density 

 

Applying this to Maricunga brine (D = 1.2 g/ml), the annual average brine pan evaporation 

rate is estimated at 1,600 mm. 

 

The DGA (2008) described the monthly distribution of average annual pan evaporation 

based on observations made from records (1977-2008) of the Linzor (4,096 masl) and 

Inacaliri (4,000 masl) stations in the II Region of northern Chile.  Figure 5.9 summarizes 

this monthly distribution of the annual average pan evaporation (Golder Associates 2011). 

 

FIGURE 5.9:  MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION OF AVERAGE ANNUAL PAN 
EVAPORATION

The DGA (2009) carried out a detailed field investigation program in Salar de Maricunga 

to establish evaporation rates as a function of soil type and depth to groundwater.  Table 

5.5 summarizes the findings of this investigation.

The Maricunga JV project has installed several Class A evaporation pans (fresh water and 

brine) at the weather station and a series of test evaporation ponds adjacent to the camp 

site. These test pans and ponds are designed to validate previous evaporation studies 

and confirm evaporation pathways for lithium brine concentration.  

 

5.3 Local Resources 

Local resources are absent at the salar. Copiapo is a major regional mining center and 

drilling contractors, drilling equipment and supplies and other required exploration tools 

and equipment and heavy mining equipment and machinery are available. 

 

5.4 Infrastructure 

Local infrastructure at the salar include National Highway 31 and an electrical power line 

running parallel to the highway. There is a customs post at the north end of the salar that 

is staffed on a 24 hour basis. 

 

Copiapo is a major city and provides a full range of services. Copiapo is serviced by daily 

scheduled air service with connections to Santiago and other major cities in Chile, as well 

as service to Argentina and Bolivia. The port of Caldera is located approximately 80 km 

west of Copiapo. The port has excellent dock facilities for general cargo, liquid fuel 

unloading and bulk cargo. The port of Chañaral is located approximately 250 km from the 

salar. 

 

5.5 Physiography 

The hydrographic basin of Salar de Maricunga (Figure 5.10) covers 2,195 km2 in the 

Altiplano of the III Region.  The average elevation of the basin is 4,295 masl while the 

maximum and minimum elevations are 6,749 masl and 3,738 masl respectively.  The Salar 

itself is located in the northern extent of the hydrographic basin and covers 142.2 km2 

(DGA 2009).The salar nucleus and the Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 tenemenets sit at an 

elevation of approximately 3,760 m asl. 

   

Previous hydrological studies have included the Piedra Pomez basin to east in the 

Maricunga watershed.  This study does not include the Piedra Pomez basin and follows 

the 2009 DGA convention as shown in Figure 5.10.  

 

The principal surface water inflow into the lower part of basin occurs from Rio Lamas which 

originates in Macizo de Tres Cruces.  Average flow in Rio Lamas (at El Salto) is measured 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

5-12 | P a g e  
 

at 240 l/s.  All flows from the Rio Lamas infiltrate into the Llano de Cienaga Redonda (DGA 

2009). 

 

The second largest inflow to the lower part of the basin occurs from Quebrada Cienaga 

Redonda.  Average flow (at La Barrera) is measured at 20 l/s; all flow infiltrates also in to 

the Llano de Cienaga Redonda (DGA 2009). 

 

Laguna Santa Rosa is located at the southwest extent of the basin valley floor and is fed 

mainly locally by discharge of groundwater.  Laguna Santa Rosa drains north via a narrow 

natural channel into the Salar itself. Additional groundwater discharge occurs along the 

path of this channel and surface water flow has been recorded at 200 – 300 l/s (DGA 

2009).  Tres Cruces National Park is located in the southern part of the Maricunga 

watershed and includes Laguna Santa Rosa.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Prior ownership and ownership changes 

SLM Litio acquired the Litio 1 – 6 claims in 2004. Numerous other claim holders, including 

Codelco and SQM, have extensive holdings on the Salar adjacent to and to the south of 

the Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 claims. 

 

Li3 acquired 60% of the Litio 1-6 claims from SLM Litio on May 6, 2011. Prior to acquisition 

date, Li3 had competed a program of acquisition due diligence and due diligence sampling 

managed by the author.  

 

As noted in Section 4.2, on April 16, 2013, Li3 acquired 100% of SLM Cocina 19-27 de la 

Sierra Hoyada de Maricunga (the "Cocina claims"). SLM Cocina held tenements 

comprising 450 ha immediately adjacent to the Litio 1-6 claims. The Cocina claims were 

originally registered under the 1932 Chilean mining code and are "grandfathered" with 

respect to lithium production under current Chilean mining law and regulations. 

 

On November 5, 2013 Li3 announced an agreement with Minera Salar Blanco ("MSB") for 

MSB to acquire 51% of Li3' Chilean subsidiary Li Energy SpA (the holder of the Litio 1-6 

and Cocina 19-27 claims) in return for specified funding of Li3's exploration program. 

Property interests were transferred to a new company Minera Li SpA, held 51% by MSB 

and 49% by Li3. Minera Li held in turn a 60% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims and a 100% 

interest in the Cocina 19-27 claims. Separately, individuals associated with MSB held a 

36% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims. The remaining 4% interest in the Litio 1-6 claims is 

held by several individuals.  

 

In 2016 MSB, Lithium Power International Ltd ("LPI") and Li3 agreed to a merger to form 

a new company ("Newco") whereby LPI would become the operator and 50% owner of 

assets comprising the Litio 1-6 claims, the Cocina 19-27 claims and three concessions 

(San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina) previously held under option by MSB. MSB 

will hold 37.37% of Newco and Li3 will hold 17.67% of Newco. Newco will hold 96% of the 

Litio 1-6 claims, 100% of the Cocina claims and 100% of the San Francisco, Despreciada 

and Salamina claims ("salar de Maricunga JV Tenements"). Both MSB and Li3 

participate on a free carry basis in property exploration until the completion of a Definitive 

Feasibility Study ("DFS") on the project. 

6.2 Prior brine exploration 

CORFO, under the aegis of the Comite de Sales Mixtas, (CORFO, 1982) conducted a 

major study of the northern Chilean salars in the 1980s with the objective of determining 

the economic potential of the salars for production of potassium, lithium, and boron. 

CORFO undertook systematic hydrogeological and geological studies and sampling of the 

various salars. Exploration work at Salar de Maricunga included sampling of shallow pits 

(50 cm deep).  It was determined that the phreatic level of the brine was at 15 cm below 

the Salar surface.  Estimates of contained mineral resources were developed based on 



Hains Engineering Company Limited

The CORFO estimates were based on an irregular sample grid covering most of the salt 

crust area. Assays were by atomic absorption (AA).  No details on the standards employed 

or sample handling procedures are available. The CORFO estimates were not prepared 

in accordance with any recognized resource estimation standard. The CORFO results 

must be considered as illustrative only and are not to be relied upon. No qualified person 

has undertaken sufficient work to classify the historic resource as a current resource 

estimate in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101.Bearing Resources is not 

treating the historic resource estimate as a current resource estimate and the historic 

resource estimate should not be relied upon. 

 
 

SLM Litio drilled 58 vertical holes on a 500 m x 500 m grid in February, 2007. Each hole 

was 20 m deep. The drilling covered all of the Litio 1 – 6 property holdings.  Holes were 

3.5" diameter and cased with either 40 mm PVC or 70 mm HDPE pipe inserted by hand 

to resistance.  Samples were recovered at 2 m to 10 m depth and 10 m to 20 m depth by 

blowing the drill hole with compressed air and allowing recharge of the hole. Subsequently, 

samples were taken from each drill hole from the top 2 m of brine. In total, 232 samples 

were collected and sent to Cesmec in Antofagasta for analysis. The 232 samples 

corresponded to the following samples intervals for each drill hole: 

 
0 m – 1 m 
1 m – 2 m 
2 m – 10 m

The assay values are comparable to those obtained by CORFO in the 1981 exploration 

program at Salar de Maricunga. Based on the assay results, SLM Litio 1-6 estimated 

contained resources to a depth of 20 m. The surface area assumed for the resource 

estimate was 1,450 ha and the assumed salar porosity was 10%. SLM Litio classified 

these resources as "indicated resources".  The estimated historic resources are detailed 

in Table 6.3.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional geology 

The extensive evaporite deposits of the Altiplano-Puna area of the Central Andes are of 

Neogene origin. These deposits have formed over many years (104 – 105 yr). Their 

formation is closely linked with the morphostructural evolution of the Andean system and 

interaction with climatic evolution. 

 

The Altiplano-Puna is the second largest high altitude plateau in the world and is the focus 

of numerous brine bodies containing high concentrations of lithium, amongst several other 

species of economic interest. The Andes of western South America are the result of 

subduction processes as the Nazca plate dived beneath the South American plate, and 

volcanic zones are associated with the steeply dipping portions of the subduction zone. 

The central volcanic zone, located between 140S and 280S is underlain by one of the 

largest magma bodies in existence on earth, known as the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body 

(APMB) (de Silva et al, 2006). Whilst the origin of the high lithium concentrations in the 

brines of the Altiplano-Puna is not known, their distribution around the margins of the 

APMB is suggestive of an ultimate source comprised lithiferous volcanic rocks. 

 

In the central Andes and Altiplano-Puna plateau, salt pans, known locally as salares form 

in topographic depressions with no outlets (endorheic basins). Salars occur at all 

elevations from 1000 m to more than 4000 m above sea level. They generally represent 

the end product of a basin infill process that starts with the erosion of the surrounding 

relief, initially depositing colluvial talus and fan gravels, grading upwards into sheet sands, 

and playa silts and clays as the basin fills. There are many variants to this model and the 

tectonic and sedimentary processes that lead to the formation of such basins have been 

widely addressed in the literature both generally (Hardie et al, 1978; Reading, 1996; 

Warren, 1999; Einsele, 2000), and specifically with regard to the Altiplano-Puna (Ericksen 

and Salas, 1989; Alonso et al, 1991; Chong et al, 1999; Bobst et al, 2001; Risacher et al, 

2003; Vinante and Alonso, 2006). 

 

Structure plays a significant part in the compartmentalization of the Andean basins. North-

south aligned thrust faults, grabens and half grabens frequently create accommodation 

space, whilst transverse strike-slip faulting may assist with basin closure, offsetting basins 

against impermeable bedrock (Salfity, 1985; Marrett et al, 1994; Reijs and McClay, 2003). 

In the Andes, volcanism also plays a significant role, both in basin infill (e.g. tuffs and 

ignimbrites), and in basin closure (e.g. volcanoes and lava flows). The latitude of the 

central Andes and their position under the subtropical high pressure belt for at least the 

last 55 million years (Hartley et al, 2005) has influenced both the type of sedimentary infill, 

and its architecture within the basins. Basin closure is thought to have occurred frequently 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

7-2 | P a g e  
 

around 14 Ma (Vandevoort et al, 1995), although the majority of evaporitic deposits appear 

to be less than 8 Ma (Alonso et al, 1991). 

 

Recent evidence suggests that the Andes reached their current elevation around 6 Ma 

ago (Ghosh et al, 2006), and since that time the climate has been dominated by arid to 

semi-arid conditions (Hartley and Chong, 2001) allowing ample opportunity for 

evaporation of the influent water. There have also been excursions into wet periods (Fritz 

et al, 2004: Placzek et al, 2006; Rech et al, 2010). During the course of the aquifer 

formation, influent ground and surface waters have not always had the opportunity to 

escape from the basin, often leading to the formation of temporary lakes or wetlands.  

Since the influent waters contained dissolved solutes as well as sediment load, 

evaporation results in the precipitation of salts, leading to the deposition of a wide range 

of evaporite deposits. Depending on the paleohydrological history of the basin, the 

deposition of evaporites may have taken place on more than one occasion, generating 

repeat sequences. There is a typical precipitation sequence starting with carbonate 

(typically calcite) as the first mineral precipitated, through sulphate (typically gypsum), to 

chloride (halite). Of course, natural salars rarely conform to this ideal. Asymmetry, 

gradational, and changing boundary positions due to climate change, tectonism, and 

sediment supply are normal. 

 

The Maricunga basin comprises a large drainage basin approximating 2,200 km2.  The 

Maricunga basin is located west of the western cordillera, in a topographical intermediate 

step, consisting of a closed system that hosts the large Salares Preandinos of Atacama, 

Punta Negra and Pedernales, with the Maricunga salar occupying the southernmost 

position in the system. 

 

Within the regional framework, the Maricunga basin is limited to the west by mountains 

that have been raised by inverse faults (Falla Vegas la Junta, Falla Varillar, Falla 

Indaqua, amongst others) that expose a basement sequence ranging in age from Upper 

Paleozoic to Lower Tertiary. The mountains and volcanoes exhibit a diverse range of 

preservation and elevation from 4,463 m (Cerro los Corrolos) to 4,729 m (Cerro La Coipa) 

to 6,052 m (Cerro Copiapo). To the southeast, the basin limit coincides with the Chilean-

Argentine frontier, which is defined by a line of modern volcanoes with elevations ranging 

from 5,250 m (Cerro de Los Patos) and 6,749 m (Nevada Tres Cruces). 

 

The volcanic complexes (extinct volcanoes, domes, etc.) exhibit a range of ages between 

26 and 6 Ma. Some of them are associated with the characteristically auriferous 

mineralisation of the Maricunga Belt. The eastern limit of the basin is marked by the 

Cordillero Claudio Gay, with a maximum elevation of 5,181 m (Cerro Colorado). This is a 

North-South trending mountain chain resting on a basement of Middle to Upper Paleozoic 

rocks and exposing deformed volcanoclastic sequences of Upper Oligocene to Lower 

Miocene rocks which represent remnants of the volcanic arc preserved on the margins of 

the Maricunga Basin (Figure 7.1). 

 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

7-3 | P a g e  
 

The valley of the Rio Lamas cuts this mountain range and exhibits deformed 

syndepositional and interstratified conglomerates and sandstones with ignimbrites, 

indicating an age range of 15.9 ± 1.1 to 15.4 ± 0.7 Ma (Tassara, 1997). This fact indicates 

a Middle Miocene age for the mountain range and, therefore, for the restoration of the 

endorheic conditions of the Maricunga basin.

Deformed terraces and sub-horizontal gravels, ranging in age from 12 Ma to 4 Ma based 

on the observed stratigraphic relations in the environs of the Salar, are deposited on this 

sequence and they extend towards the west to form the alluvial plain that underlies the 

units of the Salar. This is cut, in part by the modern fluvial channels. 

7.2 Local geology 

The Salar de Maricunga itself is located in the northern sector of the Maricunga basin. It 

has an ellipsoidal, shape with the major axis approximately 23 km long oriented NNE-

SSW and the minor axis about 10 km long and covers a total area of approximately 140 

km. square. The Salar proper is surrounded on the northwest, north, northeast, east and 

south by Quaternary and Miocene-Cenozoic alluvial deposits and on the west and 

southwest by volcanic rocks of Upper Miocene age (Figures 7.2 and 7.3). 

 

The asymmetric structure of the Salar is evidence of faulting and tilting of the basin 

downward to the northwest, with movement along faults trending north to northeast during 

Quaternary time. There is a presumed fault extending northeastward across the basin of 

the Salar, as indicated by the pronounced elongation of the southern part of the Salar and 

the straight southeastern edge. 

 

The clastic sediments bordering the Salar on the north, northwest and west sides are 

composed of fluvial Quaternary sands and gravels of mixed size and composition. They 

are generally stratified, with the finer sands being more so. The deposits range in thickness 

up to approximately 20 m and exhibit significant transmissivity (103 – 104 m2/day and total 

porosities of 10% to 15% (Risacher et al, 1999). 

 

The older Pliocene-Miocene sediments are alluvial in origin. They exhibit widely varying 

sizes from approximately 0.5 mm to up to 10 cm in diameter. The primary sources of origin 

of these sediments are the discharges from the Rio Lamas and the quebradas Cienga 

Redonda, La Coipa, Mantaniales and Caballo Muerto. These sediments exhibit 

transmissivities ranging from 15,000 to 43,000 m2/d on the southwest side of the Salar, 

based on drill hole test results and from 500 to 3,000 m2/d on the northwest side of the 

Salar, again based on drill hole test results (Risacher et al, 1999). 

 

The alluvial Upper Miocene and Pliocene sediments exhibit poor stratification on a 

selective basis. They are composed of sub-rounded to sub-angular heteroconglomerates 

from 1 – 3 cm up to 20 cm in diameter. Depositional trails largely follow the primary 

drainage channels. They are largely derived from the Upper Miocene lavas and are 

primarily distributed on the western flanks of the Cordillero Claudio Gay. The thickness of 

these sediments can be up to 900 m.

Transmissivity of the sediments ranges from 4,000 to 27,000 m2/day, but can be as low 

as 800 m2/day, based on results from test wells on the west and northwest side of the 

Salar. Total porosity ranges are reported as 5% to 15% (Risacher et al, 1999).

The Salar de Maricunga exhibits two main evapofacies, comprising an asymmetric zoning, 

which are (Tassara, 1997), Figure 7.4: 

 

Chloride facies. This facie is primarily distributed in the North and Northwest 

sectors of the Salar and presents three types of main textures: sheets, crust flat 

and very pure halite blocks. This facies covers approximately 75% of the surface 

of the Salar. This facies presents a well-developed compositional homogeneity 

between the three types of units, with very high contents of Cl and Na, compared 

with other cations and anions and relatively low content (as to Cl and Na) of B and 

Li. The chloride facies is up to 50 m thick. The estimated net evaporation rate from 

the Salar is reported to be 1,100 l/sec. 

 

Boric and Sulphate facies. This facie is distributed in the southeast of the Salar, 

and represents the less soluble facies. It sits between 1 and 2 meters above the 

level of the brackish lagoons and the chlorides facies. The flat borate facies units 

are less exposed to seasonal influx of water compared to the chlorides facies, with 

a much greater dispersion for all elements and a noticeable trend towards greater 

quantities of Ca, K, Mg, and SO4, with decreased levels of Cl and Na, and high 

concentrations of B and As, while the Li is maintained in the same proportions as 

the chlorides of northern salar facies. This facie presents gypsiferous borates and 

thenardite with ulexite including mound crust textures. 

 

Both areas are separated by a NE trending fault which controls the phreatic level, with 

brackish lagoons facing in the SW-NE direction. This fault belongs to the Eastern 

Domeyko fault system, which is an extension of an ancient fault trace structure. The 

current unbalanced distribution of the facies in the Salar is probably tectonically controlled 

by tilting the basin towards the WNW, following the old NE structures. 

 

The necessary conditions for the generation of evaporite consolidation apparently took 

place in the late Miocene (12-11 Ma), being restricted to the age of the substrate of the 

salt, and therefore the maximum age of the saline deposits is in the range of 12 Ma to 4 

Ma. The boric (and sulphate facies) of the Salar were deposited simultaneously with 

volcanic activity in the upper Miocene Maricunga Strip. Therefore, they would represent 

an earlier depositional cycle unlike the currently produced halite deposits in the Northwest 

sector of the Salar where the evaporation process results in the reduction of relic crusts. 

 

The boric facies deposits are associated with a hydrothermal sequence, probably linked 

to the Copiapó volcanic complex between 11 Ma and 7 Ma, which is correlated 

chronologically with the similar sequence that characterized the deposition of evaporitic 

borates in the Puna in Argentina.

7.3 Salar de Maricunga water balance 

A modified water balance for Salar de Maricunga has been prepared by the DGA (2009).  

Figure 7.5 shows the general surface and groundwater flow patterns in the Salar de 

Maricunga watershed.  Surface water flow generally only occurs at higher ground and 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

7-10 | P a g e  
 

infiltrates into the more permeable alluvial and fan sediment surrounding the Salar before 

reaching the Salar floor itself.  The only surface water flow that does occur on the Salar 

floor is the natural discharge from Laguna Santa Rosa north towards the center of the 

Salar.  There is no surface water outflow from the Maricunga watershed. 

 

Groundwater flow patterns follow closely the surface water flow patterns. There are no 

known groundwater outflows from the Maricunga watershed.  Inflow into the Maricunga 

watershed from the Laguna Negro Francisco has been demonstrated and is estimated at 

80 l/s.  It is speculated that potential groundwater inflow to the Maricunga watershed may 

take place from the Piedra Pomez Basin through the Claudio Gay mountain range.   There 

exists uncertainty about potential groundwater interconnection between the Llano de 

Piedra Pomez and the Rio Lamas basin.  Both potential groundwater inflow components 

need further investigation to refine the current water balance of the Salar de Maricunga 

hydrographic basin. 

 

The majority of recharge to the Maricunga basin occurs through the direct infiltration of 

precipitation. The total average annual recharge to the Maricunga basin (including the 

inflow from Laguna del Negro Francisco) is estimated at 1,450 l/s or 45.7 million cubic 

meters. 

 

Discharge from the Maricunga basin is through evaporation, evapotranspiration and 

groundwater pumping.  Evaporation rates for the various soil types have been described 

previously in Section 5.2.  The total average annual discharge through evaporation has 

been estimated at 1,098 l/s or 34.6 million cubic meters. 

 

According to DGA records, existing granted water rights in the Salar de Maricunga basin 

amount to 548 l/s.  Table 7.1 summarizes the water balance for the Salar de Maricunga 

watershed.

Golder (2010) has prepared a modified water balance for the Salar de Maricunga basin 

as part of the Marte Lobo EIA. This modified water balance is currently under review by 

the Chilean authorities and, if approved, would supersede the DGA 2009 water balance 

summarized in Table 7.1.

7.4 Mineralization 

The brines from Maricunga are solutions saturated in sodium chloride with total dissolved 

solids (TDS) of 26% (316 g/L) as an average, although most areas exceed 27%. The 

average density is 1.200 g/cm3. The other components present in these brines, which 

constitute an aqueous complex system and exist also in other natural brines in Argentina, 

Bolivia and Chile are the following: K, Li, Mg, CA, SO4, HCO3 and B, which below pH 7 

exists predominantly as un-dissociated H3BO3. Interesting values of strontium (mean of 

290 mg/L) also have been detected by ICP in the Maricunga brine.  

 

Table 7.2 shows the average content of chemical species, as well as max and min values, 

based on 431 brine samples collected from the 2011 drilling program and analyzed at the 

University of Antofagasta:

In order to evaluate the brine quality it is necessary to know the relationship among the 

elements of commercial interest, such as lithium and potassium, with those components 

that in some respect constitute impurities, such as Mg, Ca and SO4. The calculated ratios 

for the averaged chemical composition are presented in Table 7.3:

FOR MARICUNGA BRINE

8.97 1.25 8.28 12.42 0.72 0.61 6.63 7.18 0.184 

*SO4+2B/ (Ca+Mg) is a molar ratio 

 
As indicated in Table 7.3, the brines from Maricunga have an Mg/Li ratio (6.6) very similar 

to the Atacama brine (6.4). However, Maricunga has a low sulfate content, which is 

illustrated by the very low molar ratio (SO4+2B)/(Mg+Ca) that is also influenced by a 

relatively high calcium content. This is an advantage as it will reduce lithium losses as 

lithium sulfate salts in the ponds when  a conventional solar evaporation process is used 

to recover the lithium.  Treatment of the brine to remove the calcium would make the 

process similar to that utilized by SQM and Albermarle at Salar de Atacama.

As in other natural brines in the region, such as those of the Salar de Atacama and Salar 

del Hombre Muerto, the higher content of ions Cl–, SO4=, K+, Mg++, Na+ at Maricunga, 

allows a simplification for the study of crystallization of salts during an evaporation 

process. The known phase diagram (Janecke projection) of the aqueous quinary system 

(Na+, K+, Mg++, SO4=, Cl–) at 25°C and saturated in sodium chloride (equilibrium data in 

the technical literature) can be used when adjusted for the presence of lithium in the 

brines. The Janecke projection of MgLi2-SO4-K2 in mol % is used to make this adjustment. 

The Maricunga brine composition has been represented in this diagram (field of KCl), 

shown in Figure 7.6, along with brine compositions from other salars, and the Maricunga 

brine composition compared with those of Silver Peak, Salar de Atacama, Salar del 

Hombre Muerto, Salar de Cauchari, Salar de Rincon and Salar de Uyuni in Table 7.4, as 

well as the calculated ratio between some elements.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Lithium brine deposits are called salars (salares in Spanish).  Salars occur occur in closed 

(endoheric) basins without external drainage, in dry desert regions where evaporation 

rates exceed stream and groundwater recharge rates, preventing lakes from reaching the 

size necessary to form outlet streams or rivers.  Evaporative concentration of surface 

water over time in these basins leads to residual concentration of dissolved salts (Bradley 

et al., 2013) to develop saline brines enriched in one or more of the following constituents: 

sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, carbonate species, and, in some basins, rare metals 

such as boron and lithium.  When lithium concentrations exceed 100-200 mg/L, the 

"lithium" brines can be processed through a two-step process of 1) evaporative 

concentration in surface solar ponds, and 2) treatment in a chemical processing plant (e.g., 

Davis et al., 1986).  Currently, new technologies are being developed that may circumvent 

the solar pond step. 

  
Favourable conditions for the development of lithium-rich brines include: 1) arid climate, 

2) a closed basin with a playa (or salar), 3) tectonically driven subsidence, 4) associated 

igneous or geothermal activity, 5) suitable lithium source rocks, 6) one or more adequate 

aquifers, and 7) sufficient time to concentrate a brine (Bradley et al., 2013).   

 

Lithium brine projects differ significantly from hard rock mining projects, due to their fluid 

nature. The important elements of a brine deposit are the contained elements and 

chemistry of the brine and the characteristics of the host aquifer, such as aquifer extent, 

thickness, internal variations/heterogeneity and the physical aquifer properties, particularly 

porosity. 

 

Lithium brine projects can be subdivided into two broad 'deposit types', depending on the 

salar characteristics (Houston et. Al., 2011): 

 

 Mature salars (those containing extensive thicknesses – often hundreds of meters 

of halite, such as the Salar de Atacama, and the FMC Hombre Muerto operation), 

and; 

 Immature salars, which are dominated by clastic sediments, with limited 

thicknesses of halite. Examples are salar Pastos Grandes, salar Pocitos and salar 

Olaroz/Cauchari. 

 

The two different salar types reflect the different characteristics of these salars and the 

brine resources they contain. Individual salars may also contain immature and mature 

areas within the same salar basin (such as at Hombre Muerto and Maricunga). 

 

Mature salt dominated salars are characterized by having: 

 high permeabilities and specific yields (to a maximum of ~ 15% Sy) near surface, 

  with the porosity and permeability decreasing rapidly with depth; 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

8-2 | P a g e  
 

 the brine resource is essentially between surface and 50 m below surface, as 

below this depth there is typically limited permeability in the salt due to salt 

recrystallization and cementation of fractures. 

 

Immature salars conversely have porosity and permeability controlled by individual layers 

within the salar sequence. In immature salars 

 the porosity and permeability may continue to depths of hundreds of meters in 

  clastic salars (such as at Silver Peak in Nevada); 

 however, the porosity and permeability characteristics may be highly variable, due 

to differences between sand and gravel units and finer grained silts and clays. 

 

The presence of different stratigraphic units in clastic salars typically results in differences 

in the distribution of the contained brine. It is very important to consider the characteristics 

of the host aquifer in each salar, together with the geometry and physical properties, 

particularly porosity.  

 

Based on the typical architecture of the salar basins within the Andean Altiplano, the salars 

typically have a zonation consisting of: 

 

 Coarser grained sediments on the margins of the basin, with successive inner 

shells of finer grained clastic units; 

 In the centre of salars, where evaporation is generally highest, deposits consist of 

  carbonate, sulphate and finally chloride evaporites; 

 The general model for salars consists of an inner nucleus of halite surrounded by 

marginal deposits of mixed carbonate and sulphate evaporites with fine grained 

clastic sediments.  

 

Immature salars tend to be relatively small, and are more frequent at higher elevations 

and towards the wetter northern part of the region. They are characterized by an 

alternating sequence of relatively fine-grained sediments with evaporitic beds of halite or 

ulexite nodules, representing the waxing and waning of sediment supply under a variable 

tectonic and climatic history. The contained brines barely reach halite saturation, although 

normally fully saturated with respect to gypsum, leading to the widespread occurrence of 

selenite throughout the sequence. The presence of intercalated or underlying beds of 

higher permeability sometimes allows the transmission of fresher waters from outside the 

salar margins through to the centre where there is a tendency for the density differential 

with the nucleus brines to allow upward flow providing that the confining bed has sufficient 

permeability to allow such leakage. 

 

Mature salars tend to be larger and more common in the lower and drier parts of the 

region. They are characterized by a relatively uniform, and thick sequence of halite 

deposited under varying subaqueous to sub-aerial conditions (Bobst et al, 2001). 

Nevertheless, ancient floods leading to widespread silty-clay deposits and volcanic fallout 

lead to relatively thin intercalated beds that can be recognized both in cores and 

geophysical logs. Such layers of varying permeability may lead to the transmission of 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

8-3 | P a g e  
 

fresher water from outside the salar margins to the edge of the nucleus where, once 

unconfined, float to the surface, dissolving halite in their ascent and leading to pipes and 

salt dolines at the surface. The contained brines are invariably halite saturated throughout 

the brine body, although the presence of multiple brine types, especially in the larger salars 

attests to the hydrochemical variation of the contributing sub-basins. 

 
Understanding the nature of the salar matrix (halite or clastic sediments, the distribution 

of the matrix and the correlation between matrix type and brine distribution, grade and 

matrix porosity is fundamental to any exploration program and governs the type and 

amount of geophysical, drilling, and hydrogeological investigations.

9 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Overview 

Bearing has not undertaken any exploration work at salar de Maricunga.  

 

This section of the report discusses exploration work undertaken by Li3, MSB and LPI 

during the period 2011 through 2016. The 2011 exploration program was undertaken 

under the supervision of the author. The exploration work reported herein undertaken by 

MSB and LPI is summarized from reports made available by MSB and from press 

releases issued by LPI. The work undertaken by MSB and LPI has been reviewed 

through discussions by the author with the supervising geologist acting on behalf of 

MSB.  

 

Exploration work conducted on the property in 2011 consisted of the following: 

 

 23 line km of seismic tomography survey to define basin lithology/stratigraphy 

and basin geometry; 

 Six test trenches to 3 m depth to conduct 24-hour shallow pumping tests 

 

Exploration work conducted across the Litio 1-6 and Cocina tenements and the larger 

salar de Maricunga area in 2015 consisted of: 

 6 AMT lines (75 km) with stations spaced between 200 m and 250 m apart;  

 15 TEM soundings; 

 Implementation of a basin-wide hydrological monitoring program; and 

 long term pump tests on wells P 1 and P2 on the Litio 1-6 tenement. 

 

Exploration work conducted in 2016 consisted of a long term pumping test on pumping 

well P4 on the Cocina tenement. Drilling and sampling activity undertaken in 2016 

across the Maricunga JV property is discussed in Section 10 of this report.  

9.2 2011 Seismic refraction tomography survey  

Li3 contracted Geophysical Exploration and Consulting S.A. (GEC) from Mendoza 

Argentina to carry out a Seismic Refraction Tomography Survey to map geologic 

stratigraphy and structure relative to the occurrence of brine and to provide any additional 

information or interpretations regarding subsurface geological conditions. 

 

A total of 23.2 line km of seismic tomography data were collected along six lines as shown 

in Figure 9.1.  Prior to the seismic data collection all lines were surveyed using a differential 

GPS system.  All data collection work was completed in the field between September and 

December 2011.

9.2.1 Seismic tomography data acquisition and processing parameters 

A 24-bit, ultra-high resolution 20 kHz bandwidth (8 to 0.02 ms sampling), low distortion 

(0.0005%), low noise (0.2uV) GEODE Acquisition System was used for the collection of 

the seismic tomography data.  Geophone (14Hz Geospace) spacing was 5 m; inline 

source spacing was 15 m and outline offsets were 30 m, 60 m, 90 m, 150 m, 250 m and 

500 m.  The spread data acquisition layout included 48 active channels.  The seismic 

source for the surveys was a 150 kg trailer-mounted accelerated drop-weight.  Recording 

length was 250/500 ms with a 1.0 ms sampling rate. 

 

During the seismic data acquisition, data quality control and pre-processing of the 

geophysical data were carried out in the field with PC based processing and interpretation 

packages called "Firstpix" / Gremix 15" and "Rayfract32". Final data processing with the 

"Rayfract 32" software included tomography inversion techniques Delta TV and WET or 

Wave Eikonal Traveltime as follows: 

 

 Delta T-V method (after Gebrande and Mille, 1985): The Delta TV method is a 

pseudo 2D Inversion method that delivers a continuous 1D velocity versus 

depth model for all geophone stations. The method handles geological 

situations such as velocity gradients, linear increasing of velocity with depth, 

velocity inversions, pinching out layers and outcrops, faults and local velocity 

anomalies.  

 

 WET or Wave Eikonal Traveltime Tomography processing. Wave propagation 

is modelled in a physically meaningful way with ray paths, using the output from 

the Delta-TV inversion as starting model. It handles geological situations, such 

as discontinuities velocity distributions and sharp vertical or horizontal velocity 

gradients.  Quality control of geological models is performed by direct graphical 

comparison of the measured travel time data to those calculated from the 

model solution.

9.3 2011 Test Trenching 

Six test trenches (T1 through T6) were constructed in 2011 on the Litio 1-6 tenements to 

test the feasibility of brine production from trenches as an alternative to brine production 

from production wells.  One trench was installed adjacent to each sonic borehole installed 

as part of the 2011 drilling program undertaken by Li3.  The trenches were dug at 3 m 

width to a depth of 2.5 m.  Each trench was completed in generally massive (relatively 

competent) halite and the trench walls did not encounter stability problems (Figure 9.8).  

 

A 24-hour pumping test was carried out in each trench at a flow rate of 5 l/s using a sump 

pump. Water level responses during each pumping test were observed in a shallow 

monitoring well (36 m depth) adjacent to each trench that allowed for the calculation of 

aquifer parameters. Figures 9.9a through 9.9e show the water level response in each 

observation well and the associated pumping test analyses. Table 9.1 summarizes the 

results of the pumping test analyses. The relatively high Sy values obtained from the 

pumping tests are representative of the halite mix sediments and suggest enhanced 

permeability in the halite through dissolution and fracture features.

9.4 2015 Geophysical Work 

In 2015 a program of geophysical work was completed across the Salar de Maricunga. 

The program was undertaken by MSB but covered both MSB tenements and the Cocina 

and Litio 1-6 tenements held by Li3. The program consisted of six AMT lines (75 km) with 

stations placed every 200 to 250 m, and 15 TEM soundings. The purpose of the work was 

to define the brine/fresh water interface across the salar and to model the thickness and 

lithology of the alluvial sediments and salar nucleus.  

 

The 2015 geophysical work resulted in the following conclusions: 

 The salar has a depth of 350 m – 400 m in the concession are held by MSB and 

more than 1000 m in the south end of the salar; 

 The San Francisco concession appears to be highly favourable for brine 

development; 

 Fresh water overlies brine at depth on the eastern side of the salar. 

 

The 2015 geophysical work confirmed the results of the 2012 seismic work and provided 

an enhanced understanding of the geometry of the salar and the fresh water/brine 

boundary conditions and depth to brine across the salar. 

9.5 2015 Sampling and Monitoring Program 

MSB completed a program of sampling and installation of water level monitoring sensors 

across the salar de Maricunga in 2015 (Figure 9.10). The purpose of the program was to 

monitor water levels across the salar and to collect water and brine samples. No results 

have been provided to the author by MSB. The monitoring program is designed to provide 

base line data for the conceptual hydrology model and numerical model as part of the 

resource/reserve estimation process, and to provide data for a future environmental 

impact assessment (EIA) report.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 General 

Bearing has not undertaken any drilling on the Litio 1-6 or Cocina tenements. All drilling 

has been conducted by Li3 (2011) or LPI (2016/17). The 2011 drill program undertaken 

by Li3 was on the Litio 1-6 tenements. The 2016/17 drill program was undertaken on the 

Litio 1-6, Cocina, San Francisco, Salamina and Despreciada tenements.  

 

10.2 Objectives – LI3 Drilling Program – 2011 

The objectives of the Li3 2011 drilling campaign were two-fold: 

 

1) Carry out drilling on a specified grid to allow the estimation of measured "in-situ" 

brine resources over the Litio 1-6 claims in Salar de Maricunga. The drilling 

methods were selected to allow for 1) the collection of continuous core to prepare 

"undisturbed" samples at specified depth intervals for laboratory porosity analyses 

and 2) the collection of depth-representative brine samples at specified depth 

intervals without the possibility of contamination by drilling fluids. 

 

2) Carry out exploration- and well drilling to allow the installation of two test production 

wells and adjacent piezometers to carry out long-term pumping trails. 

 

10.2.1 Sonic Drilling – 2011  

Boart Longyear (BLY) was contracted to carry out a sonic drilling program for the collection 

of continuous core and brine samples.  Six sonic boreholes (C1 though C6) were located 

on a grid as shown in Figure 10.1 and detailed in Table 10.1.  This well distribution resulted 

in a well density equal to one well per 2.4 km2 across the Li3 mineral claim block and is 

suitable according to generally acceptable standards to define measured "in-situ" brine 

resources. Core recovery was consistently high and exceeded 99%.   

 

The drilling equipment consisted of a BLY 300C ATV Sonic rig and support equipment 

utilizing a 4-inch diameter coring by 6-inch casing system.  Each sonic hole was drilled 

without the use of any drilling additives/fluids to a total depth (TD) of 150 m. All holes were 

drilled vertically, thus core length is true length. The drilling was carried out in 1.5 m runs 

and core was collected in alternating plastic bags (1.5m) and lexan core barrel liners (1.5 

m).    The retrieved lexan core liners were capped and sealed with tape at each end. All 

retrieved core was labeled with its borehole number and the drilling depth interval and 

stored in wooden core boxes. The 6-inch diameter casing was advanced at the end of 

each run.  At the end of each lexan core run (each 3 m interval) a brine level measurement 

was made inside the drill casing to calculate the required volume to be bailed from the 

hole prior to obtaining a brine sample.  At least one-well volume was bailed prior to

collecting the final brine sample from the bottom of the hole.  This procedure was repeated 

to total depth (TD).   Figure 10.2 illustrates the sonic drilling operation. 

 

On completion of drilling, each sonic borehole was completed as a monitoring well with 

2-inch diameter PVC blank and slotted casing, gravel pack and cement seal to a depth 

of 36 m.

10.2.2 Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling - 2011 

 

Overview 

Rock Drilling S.A. was contracted by Li3 in 2011 to complete a reverse circulation (RC) 

drilling program consisting of: 

 

 Exploration drilling to identify suitable locations for the completion of two test 

production wells, 

 

 Drilling and completing four piezometers adjacent to each production well, and 

 

 Drilling and completing two productions wells. 

 

The RC drilling was carried out using an Ingersoll Rand T3-W reverse circulation rig 

equipped with a 350 psi, 1000 cfm air compressor and support equipment.   

 

Exploration drilling and piezometer installations 

A total of 915 m of exploration RC drilling was carried out for the collection of chip samples 

for geologic logging, brine samples for chemistry analyses and airlift data. The exploration 

drilling was carried out at 5 ½-inch diameter using dual tube reverse circulation pipe and 

air; no additives/fluids were used during the drilling.  Exploration drilling depths ranged 

from 30 m to 192 m.  Chip samples were collected at 2 m intervals for geological logging, 

brine samples were collected at 3 m intervals (directly from the cyclone) and airlift tests 

were completed at 6 m intervals.  The RC exploration boreholes were completed as 

piezometers for use during the future pumping tests.  The distance between the 

piezometers and the associated production well ranges from 10 m to 35 m. Table 10.2 

shows the details of the RC exploration drilling completed. The geological logs for holes 

P1 through P3 are provided in Appendix 1. 

 

Production well drilling  

Drilling of test production wells P1 and P2 was carried in two passes at 11-inch and 17-

inch diameter to a final total depth of 150 m using flooded reverse circulation.   The wells 

were completed with a 10-inch diameter PVC production casing string as detailed in Table 

10.2.  The annulus of each test well was completed with gravel pack.  Well development 

was carried out over a 72 hour period in each well using a double swab/airlift system.

Hydraulic testing - 2011 

On completion of the well development five-hour airlift tests were carried out to obtain 

some initial information on well and aquifer parameters.   Specific capacity (SC) for well P1 

at a pumping rate of 4.7 l/s was calculated to be 52 l/s/m and the SC for well P2 at a 

pumping rate of 4.8 l/s was calculated to be 121 l/s/m.  Based on water level recovery data 

of these airlift tests, values for hydraulic conductivity were calculated to be 41 m/d and 40 

m/d for P1 and P2, respectively.  Figures 10.5a and 10.5b show the analyses of the airlift 

recovery tests.  

 

The wells were capped after testing pending long-term pumping tests to further define 

aquifer conditions and pumped brine quality. Such tests were completed in 2015 on 

wells P-1 and P-2 by MSB acting as operator of the Litio 1-6 and Cocina tenements.

10.4 MSB Pumping Tests – 2015 

In 2015 MSB undertook a series of long-term pumping tests on wells P-1 and P-2 located 

on the Litio 1-6 claims. These wells had originally been drilled by Li3 in 2011 but had not 

been subjected to long-term pump tests. The 2015 program incorporated the series of 

piezometric and monitoring wells originally drilled by Li3 in 2011 as illustrated in Figure 

10.6 and Table 10.3.

10.4.1 Pumping Test P-1 

The well design for P-1 covered two distinct depth intervals. The shallow intervals were 

located in halite and clay, while the deep interval was in interleaved layers of clay, sand 

and gravel. Monitoring wells P1-4 and P1-2 tested shallow zones, while monitoring wells 

P1-3 and P1-1 were designed to test deep intervals. No screen intervals were installed in 

the clay zone between 26 and 60 m below ground surface as this zone did not produce 

return flows during air lift testing undertaken in 2011. Piezometers were installed in 

pumping well P-1, observation wells P1-1 through P1-4 and monitoring wells C2, C3, C4, 

C5 and C6 as well as the V-notch discharge tank, which was placed 1,200 m from the 

pumping well. 

 

Pumping tests for well P-1 commenced at 10:00 on May 3, 2015 and continued to 08:20 

on June 13, 2015. The well was allowed to recover for an additional 4.5 days to 19:45 on 

June 17, 2015. Measurements were taken every 1 minute from the pumping well and every 

15 minutes from the observation wells. Air temperature and barometric pressure readings 

were taken every 15 minutes from a location immediately adjacent to monitoring well P-3; 

i.e. approximately the centre of the well field system. Pumping well P-1 was operated at a 

constant rate of approximately 38 L/sec (3,283 m3/day) for the duration of the test. 

Pumping rates were measured using a flow meter, manual measurements and discharge 

from the V-notch tank. During the test there was one short (~70 minute) reduction in 

pumping rate after 7,320 minutes pumping time. The reasons for the temporary reduction 

in flow rate are unknown. 

 

Figures 10.7 and 10.8 illustrate the responses of well P-1 and the monitoring wells over 

the time of the pump test.

10.4.2 Pumping Test P-2 

The well design for pumping well P-2 also covered two distinct depth intervals. The upper 

zone was in halite while the lower zone was in an interlayered zone of clay, gravel and 

sand. The observation wells were screened at selected intervals based on the results of 

the 2011 air lift tests. Wells C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6 were used as monitoring wells to 

measure drawdown at shallow depths. Staggered variable flow tests were conducted 

between June 30 and July 2, with constant rate pumping tests starting at 13:55 on July 6, 

2015 and lasting until August 3 at 13:55. Recovery was measured until 21:00 on August 

6. The wells were instrumented with pressure transducers and a V-notch discharge tank. 

Measurements of flow rate and water level were taken every 1 minute for the pumping 

well P-2 and every 15 minutes for the observation wells. Air temperature and barometric 

pressure were recorded every 15 minutes adjacent to monitoring well P-3, approximately 

in the centre of the well field.  

 

The pumping rate was held constant at 37 L/sec (3,200 m3/day) for approximately 28 days, 

with the pump set at 30 m below ground surface. Final discharge was 1,200 m from 

pumping well P-2. At approximately 10,000 minutes pumping time a temporary decrease 

in pumping rate was observed, coincident with a decrease in barometric pressure. 

 

Figure 10.9 illustrates the water level response of well P-2  over the time of the pump test.

The data indicate the storage and response values are consistent with an unconfined 

aquifer system (shallow wells) to a semi-confined/confined aquifer (deep wells). The 

arithmetic mean for K for shallow wells is 2.5 x 10-3 m/s and 4.6 x 10-4 m/s for deep wells.  

Storage coefficient values are consistent with the results from the 2011 values established 

from the trench and air lift tests.  

10.5  2016/17 Drilling Program – Maricunga JV 

 
The 2016/17 drilling program was undertaken and managed by the Maricunga JV. The 

program consisted of the following: 

 

 9 rotary drill holes up to 200 m depth; 

 3 sonic holes up to 200 m depth; 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

10-14 | P a g e  
 

 1 rotary hole to 360 m depth; 

 1 production well completed withg 12-inch production casing  to depth of 
180 m.  

The program was designed to test lithology and brine chemistry in the San Francisco, 

Despreciada and Salamina tenements and to test brine flow and pumping rates in the 

Cocina tenement and lithology and brine chemistry on the Litio 1-6 tenement at depth. 

Information on the program detailed in this report is based on press releases issued by 

LPI. The author was able to observe drilling activity, core samples, brine sampling and 

long term pump tests during the course of the site visit on December 27, 2016.  

 

As of the most recent press release from LPI dated February 15, 2017, 12 drill holes have 

been completed. Brine sample assay results have been released for the 11 drill holes and 

pumping test data has been released for the pumping well. Table 10.5 summarizes the 

available data on the 2016/17 drill program. Figure 10.10 illustrates the locations of the 

various drill holes comprising the Maricunga JV project as of February 15, 2017.

Hole S19 on the Cocina concession, drilled to 360 m, demonstrates that porous sediments 

extend significantly below the 200 m depth of resource drilling. Hole S18 on the Litio 

concession demonstrates lithium brine mineralization extends below the 150 m depth 

established in the 2011 drill program. Well P4 on the Cocina concession demonstrates 

that high pumping rates extend from the Litio concession into the Cocina concession. The 

remaining holes demonstrate the presence of highly permeable sediments across the San 

Franscisco, Despreciada and Salamina tenements, thus significantly expanding the 

potential resource area compared to the resource area defined by the results of the 2011 

drilling and sampling program.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 

11.1 Sampling Methods – 2011 Program 

Sampling and sample preparation protocols for the Sonic Drilling and RC Drilling Programs 

were developed by Don Hains, P.Geo, Frits Reidel, CPG, and Pedro Pavlovic, Chem Eng.  

All protocols were implemented at the start-up of the drilling programs in October 2011 

under the supervision of Frits Reidel, CPG and included extensive day to day training and 

supervision of Li3 field staff and experienced MWH hydrogeologists and field technicians.  

Frits Reidel, CPG was present throughout the drilling program on regular intervals to 

review the day to day execution of these protocols. 

11.1.1 Sonic drilling sampling procedures 

  

Porosity samples 

Sonic core was collected in 1.5 m lexan core liners in alternating 1.5 m intervals as 

described in Section 10 above.  A 10cm sub-sample was cut from the lexan core liner; 

caps were placed on each end of the porosity sub-sample and taped to prevent any fluid 

loss. The samples were labelled with the borehole number and depth interval.  Each day 

the porosity samples were transferred to the workshop in the on-site camp where the 

samples were labelled with a unique sample number.  Prior to shipping each sample was 

wrapped in bubble plastic to prevent disturbance during shipping.  A total of 285 porosity 

where shipped to DBS&A Laboratory in the USA and 32 porosity check samples were 

shipped to the BGS in the UK. 

  

Brine samples 

Brine samples were collected at three-meter intervals during the sonic drilling where 

possible.  In some cases where the formation permeability was low, it was not possible to 

collect a brine sample after a one hour waiting period.  The borehole was purged by bailing 

at least one well volume of brine from the drill casing as calculated from the water level 

measurement prior to collecting the final brine sample from the bottom of the hole.  The 

final brine sample was discharged from the bailer into a 20 liter clean bucket from which 

three one-liter sample bottles were rinsed and filled with brine. Each bottle was taped and 

marked with the borehole number and depth interval.  A small sub-sample from the bucket 

was used to measure field parameters (density, electric conductivity, pH and temperature) 

at the wellhead (Figure 11.1).

The samples were moved from the drill site to secure storage at the camp on a daily basis.  

All brine sample bottles are marked with a unique label.  One sample bottle is stored as a 

permanent back-up sample in the on-site warehouse.  One sample bottle is prepared for 

shipment and the third bottle is either used as a duplicate or discarded.  No filtration was 

carried out on the brine samples prior to shipment to laboratories. Figure 11.2 illustrates 

the porosity samples and brine samples.

11.1.2 RC drilling sampling procedures 

  

RC drill cuttings 
During RC drilling, rock chip and brine were collected directly from the cyclone.  Drill 
cuttings were collected over two meter intervals in plastic bags that were marked with the 
borehole number and depth interval.  Sub-samples were collected from the plastic bag by 
the site geologist to fill chip trays (also at two meter interval).  At the end of each borehole 
all chip trays were removed to storage in the on-site office (Figure 11.3).  All plastic sample 
bags were stored in a secure on-site warehouse.

RC brine sampling 

Brine samples were collected at three-meter intervals during the RC drilling where 

possible.  In some cases where the formation permeability was low, it was not possible to 

collect a brine sample.  Brine samples were collected in three one-liter (rinsed) sample 

bottles.  Each bottle was taped and marked with the borehole number and depth interval.  

A small sub-sample from the cyclone was used to measure field parameters (density, 

electric conductivity, pH and temperature) at the wellhead. 

11.2 Sample Preparation - 2011 

Brine samples, either from RC boreholes or Sonic drill holes, most of them containing 

some sediment, were collected in sufficient amount in order to generate duplicates and 

check samples. They were shipped to the University of Antofagasta (main and duplicate 

samples) and Alex Stewart in Mendoza (check samples) for chemical analysis in sealed

1-litre rigid plastic bottles with sample numbers clearly identified. Both laboratories 

prepared the samples by filtering the solid material. The University of Antofagasta used 

Whatman Nº2 filter paper (8 μm pore size), which was considered sufficient for the size of 

sediments.  

 

11.3 Brine analysis and Quality Control Results - 2011 

 

11.3.1 Analytical methods 

The University of Antofagasta in northern Chile was selected as the primary laboratory to 

conduct the assaying of the brine samples collected as part of the drilling program. They 

also analyzed blanks and standards specially prepared by Li3 Energy under the direction 

of the author, which were inserted as blind control samples in the analysis chain. In total, 

there were 553 samples, of which 431 were main samples.  

 

The laboratory of the University of Antofagasta is not ISO certified, but it is specialized in 

the chemical analysis of brines and inorganic salts, with extensive experience in this field 

since the 1980s, when the main development studies of the Salar de Atacama were 

begun. In the opinion of the author, the quality control and analytical procedures used at 

the University of Antofagasta laboratory are of high quality and comparable to those 

employed by ISO certified laboratories specializing in analysis of brines and inorganic 

salts.  

 

Seventy external duplicates (check samples), including control samples, were shipped to 

Alex Stewart Argentina in Mendoza, Argentina. This laboratory is accredited to ISO 9001 

and operates according to Alex Stewart Group standards consistent with ISO 17025 

methods at other laboratories. 

 

Table 11.1 lists the basic suite of analyses requested from both laboratories. Both of them 

used the same analytical methods based on the Standard Methods for the Examination of 

Water and Wastewater, published by American Public Health Association (APHA) and the 

American Water Works Association (AWWA), 21st edition, 2005, Washington DC. The 

University of Antofagasta used Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) for the 

determination of lithium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Alex Stewart employed 

Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP), which is generally used for a large suite of elements 

(multi-elemental analysis), including the detection of trace metals. ASA included 10 

elements in the determination with this analytical technique: B, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, 

Na and Sr.

11.3.2 Analytical Quality Assurance and Quality Control ("QA/QC") 

A full QA/QC program for monitoring accuracy, precision and potential contamination of 

the entire brine sampling and analytical process was implemented. Accuracy, the 

closeness of measurements to the "true" or accepted value, was monitored by the insertion 

of standards, or reference samples, and by check analysis at an independent (or umpire) 

laboratory.  

 

Precision of the sampling and analytical program, which is the ability to consistently 

reproduce a measurement in similar conditions, was monitored by submitting blind field 

duplicates to the primary laboratory. Contamination, the transference of material from one 

sample to another, was measured by inserting blank samples into the sample stream at 

site. Blanks were barren samples on which the presence of the main elements undergoing 

analysis has been confirmed to be below the detection limit.  

 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

11-6 | P a g e  
 

Approximately 31% of the 623 samples submitted for chemical analysis were quality 

control samples. The QA/QC procedures adopted for the Project are discussed below, 

and included the following:  

 

 Three standards (A, B and C), or reference samples, were inserted at a frequency of 

1 in 15 samples (1/3 of each type of standard, randomly inserted). The specially 

prepared samples were submitted to five laboratories as a Round Robin (each 

analyzing five 1-L sub-samples from each type of standard) to establish an accepted 

mean and standard deviations for the analytical variables.  

 The University of Antofagasta made an internal check on overall analytical accuracy 

for the primary constituents of the brine by using ion balance.  This calculation was 

checked and also the ratio of measured to calculated TDS was added as another 

procedure for checking the correctness of analyses. 

 Duplicate samples at a frequency of 1 in 10 samples in the analysis chain were 

submitted to the University of Antofagasta as unique samples (blind duplicates) to 

monitor precision; 

 Stable blank samples (distilled water) were inserted at a frequency of 1 in 30 samples 

to measure cross contamination; 

 Duplicates at a frequency of 1 in 10 samples, and including blind control samples (a 

total of 70 samples), were submitted to the secondary laboratory (Alex Stewart in 

Mendoza) as check samples (external duplicates). 

11.3.3 Analytical accuracy 

 

11.3.3.1   Anion-cation balance 

The anion-cation balance was used as a measure of analytical accuracy. The anion and 

cation sums, when expressed as equivalents or milliequivalents per liter, must balance in 

an ideally perfect analysis, because mixtures of electrolytes are electrically neutral. The 

term meq/L is defined as: 

Meq/L = (mg/L * valence number / molecular weight of ion) 

 

The charge balance is expressed as a percentage, as follows:  

  % Difference = ((∑Cations −∑Anions)/(∑Cations +∑Anions)*100, 

Although this test does not monitor individual elements, it is recommended by APHA-

AWWA-WPCF in their Standard Methods, 21st edition, 2005 (1030 E) as a procedure for 

checking correctness of water analyses. The typical criterion for acceptance is a maximum 

difference of 5%, which is used by the University of Antofagasta as well as by Alex Stewart.  

 

The performance of the University of Antofagasta in the analyses of 431 main samples 

and 61 duplicates show a balance within 2%, i.e. much less than the maximum acceptable 

difference of 5%. All the check samples analyzed by Alex Stewart had a balance within a 

value of 5%. 

 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

11-7 | P a g e  
 

11.3.3.2   Measured versus calculated TDS 

Measured versus calculated Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) was used as a second 

evaluation test of analytical accuracy. The recommended ratio according to the 

APHAA/AWWA/WPCF Standard Method should be between 1.0 and 1.2. Results for the 

submitted samples to the University of Antofagasta (431 main samples plus 61 duplicates) 

ranged from 0.983 to 1.043, with 10% of the samples below the acceptable ratio (1.0) and 

most of these between 0.994 and 1.0. This is considered as a very good performance 

given the high dissolved solids content of the brine. 

 

Based on the results detailed above, the authors are of the opinion that the sample 

analytical results are reliable and accurate. 

 

11.3.3.3 Certified analytical standards 

Three standard reference samples, prepared at site with original brine (Standard A, 100% 

natural brine; Standard B, 80%; Standard C, 60%, dilution with distilled water) were used 

in the sampling program. Sets of randomized replicates were sent in a Round Robin 

analysis program to five laboratories (15 sub-samples to each lab) to determine the 

certified values used to monitor the accuracy of analyses. Statistics were done on the 

Round Robin assay results and the standard reference samples certified for the elements 

that met the criteria of having a global Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) of near 5% or 

less.. 

 

Standard A 

The Round Robin results for standard A are shown in Figures 11.4, 11.5 and 11.6 for 

lithium, potassium and magnesium, respectively. Standard A was inserted 14 times into 

the sample stream to monitor the accuracy of University of Antofagasta's analyses. From 

the aforementioned figures, it can be seen that there is only a very low bias (one failure > 

2SD) for potassium. Standard failure in bias is defined as two or more standards in a row 

having more than two (2) standard deviations from the mean, on the same side of the 

mean. Lithium and magnesium analyses are accurate.

into the sample stream to monitor the accuracy of University of Antofagasta's analyses. 

From the aforementioned figures, it can be seen that there is only a very low bias (one 

failure > 2SD) for magnesium. Lithium and potassium analyses are accurate.

Summary of Standard Analyses 

The results of the standards analyses for Li, K and Mg, included in Figures 11.4 through 

11.12, are summarized in Table 11.2. This table lists the statistics, number of samples 

exceeding the acceptable failure criteria of the mean ± 2 standard deviations, and the 

relative standard deviation (RSD) for each standard. Standard analyses at the University 

of Antofagasta indicate very acceptable accuracy. There are only two exceptions: one 

failure for potassium analysis of the Standard A (Figure 11.5) and one failure for Mg 

analysis of the Standard B (Figure 11.9). Each of these failures is not significant.  From 

Table 11.2 the relative standard deviation values (measure of precision) for the University 

of Antofagasta analyses range from 1.36 to 2.67, indicating very good analytical 

reproducibility for the standard analyses conducted at the primary laboratory. Based on 

the analysis detailed above, the authors are of the opinion that the lithium, potassium and 

magnesium analyses are accurate. There is also a good reproducibility or precision in the 

assay values reported by the University of Antofagasta for these three elements.

11.3.3.4 Check Analyses 

Checks analyses were conducted at Alex Stewart located in Mendoza, Argentina. About 

15% of external duplicates (61 samples) were submitted. In addition, some blanks and 

standard control samples were inserted to monitor accuracy and potential laboratory bias. 

The total number of samples in the batch was 70. The standards indicated acceptable 

accuracy and precision for Li and K.  



Hains Engineering Company Limited

Statistical analysis of the 61 pairs of check sample assay values was conducted using 

Reduction-to-Major-Axis ("RMA") multiple linear regressions for Li, K and Mg.  

StatGraphics software was used for this analysis. The results are summarized in Table 

11.3 and shown graphically in Figures 11.13, 11.14 and 11.15 for Li, K and Mg.

The R-squared statistic is the indicator of the quality of the fit. High values of this coefficient 

reflect a good fit and low values a poor fit.  

 

The bias, which is a measure of accuracy (the higher the bias, the lower the accuracy), is 

calculated as Bias (%) = 1 – RMAS where RMAS is the slope (m) of the Reduction-to-

Major-Axis regression line of the secondary laboratory ICP values (ASA) versus the 

primary laboratory AAS values (University of Antofagasta) for each element. Because of 

different analytical finish, in general the UoA obtained a little higher assay values for lithium 

and a little lower for potassium and magnesium, as shown in Table 11.4.

analyses is acceptable for Li, K and Mg. Eighty-eight per cent of the Li assays are within 

± 10% of one another (ASA considers acceptable 10% RPD for check samples analyzed 

in the same lab).  

 

The RMA plots shown below (Figures 11.13, 11.14 and 11.15) reveal than the fitted model 

is a little better for potassium (higher R-squared coefficient) than for lithium and 

magnesium. Potassium also shows a very acceptable bias figure.

Based on the analysis detailed above, the author is of the opinion that the check assays 

indicate that the economic cation concentrations (Li & K) determined for the main sample 

assays are suitable for use in a resource calculation. 

 

11.3.3.5 Sample Duplicate Analyses 

 

Sixty-one duplicate samples were collected in the field to confirm the overall sampling 

precision, and shipped also to the University of Antofagasta laboratory. Table 11.5 lists 

the statistics, as well as the calculated precision, bias, correlation and percent of duplicate 

analyses with results within 5% of one another. The bias and correlation were calculated 

through RMA plots, constructed with StatGraphics software, shown in Figures 11.16, 

11.17 and 11.18. The duplicate analysis repeats exceedingly well, as shown in these RMA 

plots.

11.3.3.6 Sample Contamination 

Potential sources of sample contamination are related to sample mis-ordering errors or 

insufficient washing of analytical equipment between samples. A field blank consisting of 

distilled water was inserted into the sample stream 20 times. New plastic bottles were 

used in all the cases to avoid eventual contamination with brine samples. 

 

Results reported by the University of Antofagasta indicate <0.05 mg/L (detection limit for 

lithium) in the majority of blank samples. However, there are four results, corresponding 

to the last two sample batches with 0.07 (2), 0.08 and 0.09 mg/L for lithium. This reveals 

that some small contamination with brine was produced in the manipulation of the plastic 

bottles, either at the project site, or in the lab. This issue is not considered to detract from 

the validity of the overall sampling and assay results and the use of the assay results in 

resource estimates. 

11.4 Specific Yield and Porosity Testing 

Daniel B. Stevens & Associates Inc. in Albuquerque, New Mexico (DBSA) was selected 

as the prime laboratory for determination of porosity and Relative Brine Release Capacity 

(RBRC) (equivalent to specific yield (Sy)) data for the core samples. DBSA also undertook 

analysis of particle size, density and other physical properties of the core samples. DBSA 

received a total of 285 core samples which had been initially prepared by Li3 staff at the 

field camp on the salar. All samples were prepared and shipped to DBSA as detailed in 

section 11.1 of this report. On receipt of samples at DBSA, the samples were treated in 

one of three ways in preparation for determination of Relative Brine Release Capacity. 

These were: 

 

1) the entire intact sample was used,

2) an intact sub-sample was obtained by cutting the original sample acetate sleeve 

with a chop saw, 

3) an intact sub-sample was obtained by pushing a smaller diameter testing ring into 

the original sample. 

 

All but six samples received were subject to RBRC testing. The six samples not used for 

RBRC testing were considered to be too brittle or crumbly to obtain an appropriate sub-

sample. Thirty-four (34) verification tests (duplicates) were also performed, for a total of 

313 RBRC tests. After completion of RBRC tests, 30 samples were selected for particle 

size analysis  

11.4.1 Relative Brine Release Capacity Test  

The Relative Brine Release Capacity test predicts the volume of solution that can be 

extracted from an unstressed geologic sample. The test method is briefly described below: 

 

Undisturbed samples from the site are saturated in the laboratory using site 

specific brine solution. The bottom of the samples are then attached to a 

vacuum pump using tubing and permeable end caps, and are subjected to a 

suction of 0.2 to 0.3 bars for 18 to 24 hours. The top end cap is fitted with a 

one-gallon air bladder which allows sufficient drainage while inhibiting 

continuous atmospheric air flow. The vacuum system permits testing multiple 

samples simultaneously in parallel. The samples are then oven dried at 

110°C. 

 

Based on the density of the brine, the sample mass at saturation, and the 

sample mass at 'vacuum dry', the volumetric moisture (brine) contents of the 

samples are calculated. The difference between the volumetric moisture 

(brine) content of the saturated sample and the volumetric moisture (brine) 

content of the 'vacuum dry' sample is the "relative brine release capacity". 

 

This methodology has been widely accepted by companies involved in the lithium brine 

exploration activities and is regarded as being a suitable method for determination of 

Specific Yield (Houston, 2011).  

 

DBSA also undertook several verification tests related to RBRC testing. These included 

the following: 

 "Remolded" samples in cases where there was insufficient intact original 

material for secondary testing. Samples were prepared for testing by 

remolding the material to target the initial density after the initial testing was 

performed.  

 Samples designated as 'Sub-sample #2' were prepared for testing by 

obtaining a separate intact sub-sample from the original core.  

 Samples designated as 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' are the same sub-sample, only 

the time the sample was subjected to vacuum suction was varied (18-24 

hours and 36-28 hours, respectively). 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

11-20 | P a g e  
 

 Particle Size Analysis: 

After RBRC testing, thirty (30) of the samples were chosen to be used for 

particle size analysis (PSA). The samples were chosen with the intent to 

represent each of the material types present in the sample batch. Several of 

the sample results indicate discontinuity between the physical particle size 

analysis and the hydrometer analysis due to high clay and/or salt content.  

 

DBSA employed the following standard test methods for determination of some of the 

physical properties of the samples: 

 

Dry Bulk Density: ASTM D7263 

Moisture Content: ASTM D7263 

Calculated Porosity: ASTM D7263 

Particle Size Analysis: ASTM D422 

USDA Classification: ASTM D422, USDA Soil Textural Triangle 

 

DBSA relied upon the brine solution density (1.22) provided by Li3 in calculating the 

volumetric moisture (brine) content. Particle densities of the samples were calculated 

based on the assumption that the samples were 100% saturated after the saturation stage 

of the test procedure. The calculated particle density was then used to calculate the total 

porosity of each of the samples. Volume measurements for each sample were obtained 

at the "as received", "saturated", and "vacuum dry" conditions. It is noted that due to 

irregularities on the sample surfaces, volume measurements should be considered as 

estimates.    

 

A total of 20 samples tested were noted to have questionable integrity (QI) relative to the 

in-situ conditions described by Li3. For sands, silts, and clays a 'questionable integrity' 

designation indicates that the sample may, or may not, accurately represent in-situ 

conditions (material appeared loose initially) relative to presumed in-situ conditions. For 

halite cores a 'questionable integrity' designation indicates that the sample core had 

grooves, pits, or other void spaces that may, or may not, be a result of the sampling 

technique employed. For halite cores a 'questionable integrity' may indicate that some 

dissolution has occurred during testing. 

RBRC test results - DBSA 

Drainable porosity is largely dependent on lithology which is highly variable in the 

Maricunga brine aquifer as observed from the drilling results.  Therefore, based on visual 

inspection and particle size analyses the samples were grouped in three types as follows:  

1) a halite mix, 2) a silt-clay mix and 3) a sand mix.  Table 11.6 shows the results of the 

laboratory drainable porosity analyses.

11.4.2 British Geological Survey Porosity Tests 

Thirty (30) core samples prepared as described in Section 10 of this Report were shipped 

to the British Geological Survey (BGS) for determination of porosity and specific yield. The 

samples were duplicates of samples shipped to DBSA for RBRC testing.  Data showed 

significantly higher porosity and drainable porosity values than reported by DBSA, as 

shown by the data in Table 11.7. Reasons for the differences could not be reliably 

determined. 

 

Samples were initially centrifuged to release pore fluid to determine Sy in "as received 

conditions".  The chemistry of released pore fluid was analyzed as a double check against 

UoA and ASA results and found to be similar.  The samples were then re-saturated and 

allowed to drain (similar to the RBRC test) and then oven dried to obtain total porosity 

values.  Porosity values were also planned to be evaluated using the helium injection 

method. However, this work was not completed.

11.4.3 Porosity and Specific Yield Summary 

The results of the porosity and specific yield test work show significant variations between 

the different lithologies but overall indicate favourable conditions for brine production. The 

author is of the opinion that the results of the DBSA tests best represent the overall 

pororsity and specific yield conditions present on the Litio 1-6 tenements and that the 

DBSA results are suitable for use In resource estimation. 

11.5 Quality Control/Quality Assurance Summary 

Based on the results of the QA/QC analysis, the author is of the opinion that the assay 

results are accurate and can be relied upon for use in resource estimation.  

 

11.6  2015 Pump Tests – Brine Sampling 

Brine samples were collected from pumping wells P-1 and P-2 on a periodic basis to 

determine fluctuations in brine chemistry over time. Sample analysis was undertaken 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

11-23 | P a g e  
 

using the same methods as used for brine samples collected during the 2011 exploration 

program, with assays completed at the University of Antofagasta. The results of the 

sample program are illustrated in Figure 11.19: 

 

FIGURE 11.19: BRINE SAMPLE ANALYSIS – 2015 PUMPING TESTS 
 

 

The results show some differences in Li and potassium values between wells P-1 and P-

2, with Li values consistently above 1150 mg/L for both wells. Fluctuations over time are 

more noticeable in well P-2, with an increase in value over time, possibly indicating inflow 

of brine from surrounding areas.   

 

11.7  Sampling and Assaying – 2016/17 Drill Program 

Sampling and assay protocols for the 2016 drill program managed by LPI consisted of the 

following (LPI, 2016):  

 Purging of drill hole, 

 Collection of brine samples from rotary holes by bailing at 6 m intervals and 

collecting samples in 1 litre bottles. For Hole S19, the sample interval was 

increased from 6 m to 12 m for the interval between 204 m and 354 m 

 Assaying at the University of Antofagsata, including QA/QC samples consisting of 

blanks, duplicates and standards inserted on a random basis at a 20% insertion 

rate. Assays are by AA. 

 Collection of rotary chip samples every 2 metre interval at the well head using a 

porous cloth bag to retain fines. Sample bags are allowed to drain and the chips 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

11-24 | P a g e  
 

logged for lithology and grain size distribution. Chip samples examined visually 

using hand lens and under optical microscope and logged by interval and lithology. 

 Sonic holes are drilled with alternating Lexan casing and polyethylene bag tubing 

on 1.5 m intervals, with brine samples collected every 6 m interval by bailing. 

Samples are collect in 1L sample bottles. Samples are assayed at the University 

of Antofagasta in the same manner as brine samples from the roary drill holes. 

 Brine samples from the pumping well tests are collected in 1 L plastic bottles and 

assayed at the University of Antofagasta using the same procedures as for brine 

samples from the exploration drill holes. Similar QA/QC procedures involving 

blanks and standards as used for the brine samples from drill holes are also 

employed. 

The author discussed the sampling and assaying procedures employed in the 2016 

exploration program with Mr. Frits Reidel, QP and hydrogeological consultant to MSB. 

Based on site observations of the author, the descriptions provided by Mr. Reidel, and the 

description of sampling and assay procedures detailed in the LPI press releases reporting 

exploration results, the author is satisfied that the sampling and assay procedures 

employed by LPI are representative of modern industry practice and are suitable for the 

type and nature of samples collected.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

Data verification procedures employed by the author related to the 2011 exploration 

conducted by Li3 included the QA/QC analysis detailed in Section 11, above and review 

of the assay data base against the assay certificates. No errors were found in the assay 

data base. The author did not collect any independent check samples for assays from the 

LI3 drill program in 2011. During the course of the 2011 drilling and sampling program all 

sampling was under the supervision of the author or the project site geologist and it is the 

opinion of the author that no independent check sampling was required. In the opinion of 

the author, the assay data are suitable for resource estimation purposes.  

 

The author has undertaken no data verification with respect to the 2015 pumping test 

program managed by MSB or the 2016 drill program managed by LPI. The author has 

reviewed the available information provided by MSB and LPI, observed sampling 

procedures on site during the December, 2016 site visit, and has discussed the 

procedures employed during both the 2015 and 2016 programs with the supervising 

hydrogeological and geological consultants retained by MSB and LPI for the respective 

exploration programs and has found no issue with the reported data. In the opinion of the 

author, the reported information can be considered to be accurate and reliable.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Background - Li3 2011 Exploration Program 

In order to study the phase chemistry of the Maricunga brine, the initial step for designing 

a lithium recovery process, a simulated lab solar evaporation test work was conducted at 

the University of Antofagasta, northern Chile. Two batch wise evaporation tests at 

laboratory scale were carried out at a relatively constant temperature of 20oC. The natural 

brine was used in the first test and in the second one a treated brine with sodium sulfate, 

to remove most of the high calcium content that characterizes the Maricunga brine. Both 

tests provided information on the nature of the crystallized salts along the different stages 

of an evaporation process, which has been useful for process simulations.  

A summary of the experimental procedure and the main results of both tests are presented 

below: 

 

13.2 Experimental Procedure  

A total brine feed of 192.04 kg was used in the first test (natural brine), distributed in four 

fiberglass glass reinforced plastic pans, each of 75.5 cm diameter and 12.3 cm height. 

The brine evaporation takes place at a temperature of 20 deg. C into a thermally insulated 

chamber (3.5-m long by 1-m wide by 0.8-m high), where a fan with variable speed propels 

air. Temperature, air speed and relative humidity, are measured through a data acquisition 

system to monitor the evaporation. This evaporation chamber operates continuously (24 

hours) with air having relative humidity of 60% to 75%. 

The amount of salt deposited in the pans, weighed by a digital scale, was used to define 

each stage (harvest) of evaporation, as well as determining the cumulative percentage of 

evaporated water. Samples of the solution and the salts after filtration were collected from 

every stage for chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. 

 

When the Maricunga brine is getting more concentrated and the brine volume has 

diminished significantly, the evaporation is continued in another insulated chamber (1.18-

m long by 0.70-m wide by 0.46-m high). The concentrated brine has a much lower brine 

activity (vapor pressure of the brine divided by the vapor pressure of the water), which 

results in lower evaporation rates. 

 

The second chamber operates continuously with dehumidified air, which circulates 

through three PVC columns containing silica gel as drying agent. Under these conditions, 

the air can reach a relative humidity of the order of 40%. When the silica gel gets saturated, 

heating in a dryer at 120ºC activates it for re-use. 

 

As per the brine treated previously with anhydrous sodium sulfate (10% excess was used 

to precipitate 88.7% of Ca++), a total of 156.04 kg, distributed in three pans, was fed to the 



Hains Engineering Company Limited

evaporation system. Table 13.1 shows the composition of the natural brine and treated 

brine used in the evaporation test work.

13.3 Results of the Evaporation Tests 
The natural brine was concentrated up to 0.925% lithium and 3.95% magnesium in twelve 

stages of evaporation, being 69.1% the cumulative evaporation.  

The treated brine was concentrated up to 1.98% lithium and 6.08% magnesium in nine 

stages of evaporation, with a cumulative evaporation of 68%. 

Due to the low activity of the concentrated brine, it was necessary to increase the 

evaporation temperature to 30oC during the last stages of both tests.

Tables 13.2 and 13.3 show the changes in the chemical composition of the untreated brine 

as well as of the wet salt composition after every harvest (12) of the pans. Table 13.3 also 

shows a mass balance (crystallized salts, solution and evaporated water) referred to the 

initial weight of brine for each evaporating stage at 20oC. The brine has been concentrated 

until the end of the carnallite field.

According to the salt composition, harvests 11 and 12 should have tachhydrite; however 

analyzing the brine evaporation curves of the ions presented by K/Li and Ca/Mg pairs, it 

is expected that this salt has not yet been crystallized, and the author suspects that the 

calcium and lithium are still entrained in the brine in the harvested salts.   

Figure 13.2 illustrates the complete evaporation curve for the untreated brine while Figure 

13.3 is a representation for the concentrated brine when the levels of sodium and 

potassium are very low. 

However, since the brine is saturated in sodium chloride, the known phase diagram 

(Janecke projection) of the aqueous system Na+, K+, Mg++, SO4=, Cl– at 25°C  (Figure 13.4) 

is more appropriate for representation of the evaporation path, as shown by Figure 13.5, 

where lithium has been associated to magnesium.

13.4 Discussion of Results and Conclusions – 2011 Test Work 
Maricunga natural brine was concentrated at laboratory scale and at a relatively constant 

temperature of 20°C from 0.093% up to 0.925% lithium (about 10 times) in twelve stages 

of evaporation, using 192 kg as brine feed.  The cumulative evaporation was 69.1%.  

Treated brine (156 kg), with most of the calcium removed (88.7%), was concentrated in 

the same period of time along nine stages of evaporation up to 6.08% Mg and 1.98% Li 

(twenty-one times for this element). The cumulative evaporation was 68%. 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

13-9 | P a g e  
 

The pretreated brine follows the pattern of the Atacama brine, with crystallization of 

carnallite and then bischofite, when the brine reaches 6.77% Mg in harvest 8. The 

mineralization shows the formation of Li2SO4.H2O (13.5%) and lithium carnallite, (10.5%), 

but the predominant species is carnallite, (60.5%). The X-ray diffraction indicates the 

formation of carnallite (75.6%), lithium sulfate monohydrate (11.1%), but the presence of 

lithium carnallite is not detected. In harvest 9 the predominant salt is bischofite, 

MgCl2.6H2O (69%).  

The main conclusions from the two evaporation tests conducted at the University of 

Antofagasta are that two processing routes should be evaluated to recover lithium from 

the Maricunga brine.  

The first one would be to concentrate the natural brine at the solar ponds up to 

approximately 3% lithium. Then, the concentrated brine would go to the chemical plant to 

complete its purification (separation of boron by SX and removal of magnesium & calcium), 

before the precipitation of lithium carbonate with sodium carbonate. Since the 3% Li-

concentrated brine would still contain a significant amount of Mg together with Ca, the 

important consumption of sodium sulfate at the plant should be taken into consideration.  

The second route would be to remove most of calcium and magnesium at the ponds, the 

last one as crystallized salts. However, the brine treatment with sodium sulfate should be 

carried out at an intermediate stage to reduce the consumption of this input, and on the 

other hand, the system would operate with less sulfate along the evaporation process, to 

avoid the precipitation of lithium sulfate salts and making possible the production of a 

concentrated brine higher in lithium. 

13.5 POSCO Process Tests – 2012/13 
Pilot plant evaluation of the POSCO direct extraction process was undertaken in late 2012 

– early 201313. The POSCO process is a proprietary process for direct extraction and 

recovery of lithium from brine. Details of the process were not made available to LI3. The 

test work used brine recovered from trenches on the Litio 1-6 tenement, with the brine 

being processed in a pilot plant established at Copiapo. POSCO reported the process test 

work was successful but did not provide details of the results to Li3. Subsequent to 2013, 

POSCO decided not to pursue further evaluation of the use of the process at Maricunga 

in favour of other locations. The reasons for the POSCO decision are unknown but 

believed to be associated with the legal and regulatory issues associated with lithium brine  

extraction and processing in Chile at the that time, not the technical success of the process 

at Maricunga.  

 

13.6 2016 Evaporation Pond Tests  
A series of evaporation pond tests were initiated in late 2016 using brine from Well P1 on 

the Litio 1-6 tenement. A total of ten trial evaporation ponds were constructed in Q4/16 in 

order to measure the precipitation of salts, the evolution of brine, and evaporation rates 

over a one-year period to determine the optimal processing methodology and process flow 

sheet for the extraction of lithium, potassium, and other by-products. The evaporation 

pond test site is illustrated in Figure 13-6.

The average grade of the brine from the pump well fed to the first of the evaporation test 

ponds was 1,260 mg/L lithium and over an initial three-month period, the brine 

concentration increased five-fold to 6,300 mg/L lithium. In addition, potassium chloride 

(KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is precipitating in the ponds as the concentration of the 

brine increases (LPI, 2017).  

 

Sampling and assay procedures for the pond evaporation tests incorporated the following: 

 

 Collection of brine samples on a periodic basis to measure brine properties such 

as chemical analysis, density, conductivity, etc. Samples were assayed at the 

University of Antofagasta using the same methods and QA/QC procedures as for 

brine samples collected from drill holes and from pumping tests; 

 Collection of precipitated salts from the ponds for mineralogical and chemical 

analysis to evaluate the evaporation pathways, slat evolution and physical and 

chemical properties of the salts (LPI press release, Feb.24, 2017).

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

14.1 Overview 

A mineral resource estimate for the Litio 1-6 tenements (1,439 ha) held by Li3 on salar de 

Maricunga was prepared in 2012. Estimates were prepared in accordance with CIM 

definitions of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the CIM Best Practice mineral 

resource estimation guidelines of the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy ("CIM") 

and the requirements outlined in the Ontario Securities Staff Notice 43-704, and the CIM 

Best Practice Guidelines for Reporting Brine Resources and Reserves as prepared by the 

author and as discussed by Houston et al, 2011). Most recently, the author undertook a 

site visit to the Maricunga project on December 27, 2016 to verify site conditions and 

determine if any changes to the resource estimate were required. Such was not the case 

and the 2012 resource estimate is considered current as of the date of this technical report. 

 

The Maricunga JV will prepare an updated resource estimate when the results of the 

2016/7 field program become available by June 2017. 

 

The measured and inferred resource estimates were developed for the Li3 Salar de 

Maricunga project area using SgeMS software. Dr. Gregoire Mariethoz, Professor at the 

School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia 

was contracted by LI3 to process the data for the numerical model used to develop the 

resource estimates.  The author and the project hydrogeologist, Frits Reidel, were 

intimately involved in the model development process and all results have been reviewed 

and checked at various stages by the author and are considered to valid and appropriate 

for these resource estimates.   

 

The measured lithium and potassium resources are calculated to a depth of 150 m.  The 

inferred lithium and potassium resources have been calculated over the same area for the 

depth interval between of 150 m and 180 m within the Litio 1-6 tenements.  

 

The datasets used to develop the measured lithium and potash resource estimates are 

based on results from six appropriately spaced sonic boreholes (one sonic bore per 2.4 

km2) with infill results from three RC boreholes resulting in an overall borehole density of 

one bore per 1.6 km2.  The distributions of lithium and potassium concentrations in the 

model domain are based on a total 623 brine analyses (431 main analyses and 192 

QA/QC analyses) as discussed in Sections 10 and 11 of this technical report.  The spatial 

distribution of specific yield in the model domain is based on porosity analyses of 285 

undisturbed samples and six shallow pumping tests as described in Sections 9 and 11 of 

this report. It is the opinion of the author that the density and quality of the datasets used 

to prepare the resource estimates herein are adequate and appropriate.

14.2  Model methodology and construction 

 

Step 1:  Preliminary data analyses 

As an approximate preliminary step, an integration was carried out by computing the 

average resource in the boreholes only. Li is defined as the lithium concentration, Sy as 

the porosity and L as the length of each sampling interval. The resource available in each 

sampling interval x is given by  

R(x) = Li(x) * Sy(x) * I(x).  

 

Summing R over all boreholes and dividing by the total boreholes length yields an estimate 

in g/m3. An identical procedure was carried out for potassium.  The results of the 

calculations provide approximate grades as shown in Table 14.1 to validate the realism of 

the kriging and stochastic analyses below.  

 

TABLE 14.1:  AVERAGE LITHIUM AND POTASSIUM GRADES 
 

Average Li resource (g/m3) Average K resource (g/m3) 

54.29 390.61 

 
 
Step 2:  Taking account for the spatial distribution  
Analysis of the assay data indicate that lithium and porosity are not correlated with porosity 

(Figure 14.1), with a value of R2 of 0.0123. Therefore they can be both interpolated 

independently on a regular grid.  

 

FIGURE 14.1:  CORRELATION LITHIUM - POROSITY 

 
 
Geostatistical analysis provides the most appropriate method to interpolate values when 

data are scarce [Chilès and Delfiner, 1999; Deutsch and Journel, 1998; Goovaerts, 1997]. 

The most common methods are either kriging (in order to obtain an averages estimation) 

or stochastic simulations (to obtain different scenarios, therefore allowing to estimate 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

14-3 | P a g e  
 

uncertainty). In this study both options are investigated with the SGeMS software [Remy 

et al., 2009]. If lithium and porosity were correlated together, the interpolation would need 

to be constrained such that this correlation would need to be respected throughout the 

grid. This could be accomplished with co-kriging or co-simulations, which are significantly 

more cumbersome to apply [Wackernagel, 2003]. Fortunately the use of these methods is 

not justified here.  

 

There is a strong correlation between Li and K (correlation coefficient r = 0.96), but these 

are not correlated with Sy, with absolute values of r lower than 0.12. Li and K were 

modeled separately; therefore their strong correlation is not explicitly imposed in the 

simulations. However, since the final resource estimate for each element only depends on 

the relationship to drainage porosity, this should not affect the final estimates, and it is not 

necessary to use co-kriging or co-simulation. The high and low values in each simulation 

of Li and K, taken separately, might not be highly correlated; however, on average the 

data tend to agree, and in the kriging analysis the high values of Li tend to be at the same 

locations as the high values of K.  

 

The first step of the geostatistical analysis is to adjust a variogram on the data. Figure 14.2 

shows the parameters that are used and the procedure for variogram estimation. Note that 

variograms are needed in 3 directions: N-S horizontal, E-W horizontal, and vertical. Figure 

14.3 to Figure 14.5 show the variogram fits for lithium and Figure 14.6 to Figure 14.8 show 

the fits for porosity.  

 

The horizontal variograms rely on few data and are inferred largely empirically due to the 

spacing between boreholes and their relatively small number. This is because the distance 

between boreholes varies between 750 and 4427 m, therefore making it difficult to infer 

from the data horizontal spatial correlation for scales under 750 m.

Step 5: Definition of the gridded domain 
The grid used for the resource estimation is made of 354,244 nodes. The dimensions are 

44 x 83 x 97 nodes, and the size of each node is 50 x 50 x 2 m (Figure 14.9).  

 

FIGURE 14.9:  GRID CHARACTERISTICS, DOMAIN DEFINITION, AND VIEW 
OF THE LITHIUM CONCENTRATION ON THE BOREHOLES 

 

 
 
 
Step 6:  Kriging results  
Kriging represents in each point the most probable value and therefore can be used to 

obtain a single estimate. However, kriging is a smooth estimate that does not account for 

heterogeneity, and therefore it often represents a conservative estimate. In particular here, 

it will not account for areas of very high or very low concentration or extreme porosity 

values.  

 

Kriging can be seen as the average of all possible scenarios. In contrast, stochastic 

simulations (see below) provide a means of obtaining several realistic scenarios 

(realizations) that can be analyzed statistically.

FIGURE 14.11:  THE RESULTS OF KRIGING POROSITIES 

 

 
 
 
Step 7: Stochastic simulations results  
The next step is to produce stochastic simulations of both lithium and porosity using the 

Sequential Gaussian Simulation algorithm implemented in SGeMS. These stochastic 

simulations correspond to possible scenarios that are consistent with:  

- the spatial statistics (variograms) inferred from the data.  

- the boreholes.  

 

A number of these scenarios (also called realizations) are generated and used to get a 

probability distribution for the resource. Similarly as for kriging, realizations are generated 

separately for lithium concentration and for porosity. The modeling program generated 50 

realizations for lithium concentration and 50 realizations for porosity. This corresponds to 

50 scenarios of the deposit. Examples of the model realizations are provided in Figures 

14.12 and 14.13.

Step 8: Resource estimation  
The estimates of the amount of lithium and potassium in each node xi of the model are 

done by applying the following operation:  

 

R(xi) = Li(xi) * Sy(xi),  

 

Where: i is the indice of the node, going from 1 to 354,244  

R represents the resource (g/m3), Li the lithium concentration in brine, and 

Sy the porosity.  

 

This provides a 3D grid of the resource for the kriging estimates, as well as a 3D resource 

grid for each of the 50 pairs of lithium/porosity scenarios.  

 

Step 9: Total estimates  

The total resource for each case is obtained by averaging R(xi) over all nodes i. This 

provides one total estimate for kriging, and also one estimate for each of the 50 scenarios. 

Figure 14.14 summarizes these results, with kriging giving a lithium estimate of 36 g/m3 

and stochastic simulations estimates ranging between 42.5 g/m3 and 73 g/m3.  Kriging 

gives a potassium estimate of 260 g/m3 and stochastic simulation estimates range 

between 310 g/m3 and 525 g/m3. It should be noted that the kriging estimate is lower, 

which can be explained by the fact that kriging ignores heterogeneity and extreme values.

14.3 Resource Estimate 

The lithium and potassium resource estimates for the Litio 1-6 tenements were calculated 

from the average total grades determined by the stochastic simulations and the defined 

aquifer volumes.  The results are summarized in Table 14.2. It should be noted that the 

resource is open at depth and beyond the current project boundaries. 

 

The hydraulic parameters of the resource area determined from the results of the pumping 

tests  suggests that it is reasonable to expect brine extraction by a conventional production 

wellfield  at a commercially viable rate, while the geochemical characteristics of the brine 

suggest that conventional processing techniques may be employed to produce saleable 

lithium products in an economically profitable manner. These conventional processing 

techniques are employed in most lithium brine operations, including the two operations at 

Salar de Atacama (Chile), one at Salar de Olaroz (Argentina), and one at Clayton Valley 

(USA). The relatively high lithium concentrations will have a positive influence on capital 

requirements for the conventional ponding facilities.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

The Salar de Maricunga brine is suitable for conventional processing, which principally 

consists in solar evaporation of the brine to a suitable concentration where the brine can 

be treated in a lithium carbonate production plant. The concentrated Maricunga brine will 

require a solvent extraction stage in order to remove the boron, a calcium removal stage 

with the addition of sodium sulfate, and 2 magnesium removal stages, where magnesium 

is removed as magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide. Finally, a soda ash 

solution will be added to the concentrated purified lithium brine to precipitate lithium 

carbonate.  

 

Potassium chloride can be produced by conventional processes.  The process principally 

consists of silvinite salt harvesting from the ponds and subsequently milling, and flotation 

of the silvite (KCl) salts. Other potential by-products are magnesium chloride (bischofite) 

and calcium chloride. The lithium recovery for this process was simulated to be around 

50% and the potassium recovery around 70%, which is common in the industry. 

 

Li3´s strategic partner (POSCO) has developed a proprietary process which has 

demonstrated an overall lithium recovery of more than 70% at small pilot scale. This 

process cannot be disclosed for confidential reasons. POSCO successfully demonstrated 

its technology using brine recovered from the Litio 1-6 tenements in late 2012 – early 2013.  

However, as noted in Section 13.5, POSCO decided, for non-technical reasons, not to 

proceed with further evaluation of the process at the salar de Maricunga project.  

 

The process technology to be used by the Maricunga JV to process brine from the salar 

de Maricunga is not known as of the effective date of this technical report.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

Lithium finds application in a diverse range of uses from glass and ceramics to chemicals 

to batteries to aluminum alloys. In recent years, the focus on lithium supply and demand 

has been on use of lithium in various battery applications, especially portable electronics 

and electric vehicles.  

19.1 Lithium Supply 

Lithium is commercially extracted from two primary deposit types: as a hard rock mineral 

and in natural evaporative saline brines. Lithium minerals, in the form of spodumene or 

petalite concentrate, find primary application in glass and ceramics products. Lithium 

recovered from brine deposits is primarily produced as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) or 

lithium hydroxide (LiOH.H2O) and is used in a wide variety of chemical and (especially) 

battery applications. Lithium brine deposits are estimated to account for 90% of global 

lithium reserves and approximately 50% of global production. Lithium brine operations are 

confined to Chile, Argentina, the USA and China, with South America hosting the largest 

producers. Lithium mineral concentrates can be converted to lithium chemicals such as 

lithium carbonate and used in similar applications as lithium recovered from brines, but at 

higher production cost than brine derived lithium chemicals. The major producers of lithium 

minerals are located in Australia, China and Zimbabwe, with emerging producers in 

Canada (Roskill 2016). 

 

Global supply of lithium minerals has been historically dominated by hard-rock mineral 

sources, however development of large-scale lithium brine operations in South America 

commenced in the early 1980's. Global lithium supply has increased at a 7% compound 

annual growth rate ("CAGR") from 1995 to 2015 to meet increased demand from mobile 

phones and other electronics. Today, global lithium supply is around 171 kt lithium 

carbonate equivalent ("LCE"), split roughly 50:50 between hard-rock and brines (Deutsche 

Bank, 2016). Figure 21-1 illustrates recent changes in global lithium supply by country and 

projected changes in supply through 2025. Key aspects of lithium supply from brine and 

hard rock deposits are summarized in Table 19.1:

1. New non-solar evaporation technology can substantially reduce time frame 

2. Not for new, non-solar evaporation technology 

 

Brine deposits are anticipated to account for an increasing share of production due to the 

relative availability of brines, their lower operating costs, and changes in brine processing 

technology resulting in significant capital cost reduction on a tonne LCE produced basis.  

 

Lithium is sold and consumed as a number of different mineral and chemical compounds, 

depending upon the desired end product. Given the numerous types of lithium products, 

to standardize supply and demand, lithium statistics are typically expressed either on a 

contained lithium basis or, more commonly as LCE, as lithium carbonate currently holds 

the largest share of the overall lithium market. For conversion purposes, lithium comprises 

approximately 18.8% of total mass in lithium carbonate (conversion ratio of 5.323 kg LCE 

to 1.0 kg Li). 

 

The type of lithium compound produced and sold by a mining operation is partially 

dependent upon the type of deposit. For example, a lithium brine project cannot produce 

lithium mineral compounds but its direct product can be lithium carbonate whereas a hard 

rock lithium project requires an additional conversion step to take its lithium mineral 

concentrate to lithium carbonate. Therefore lithium brines cannot supply certain lithium 

mineral demand and lithium brines can have a cost advantage for lithium carbonate 

markets (e.g. batteries). 

 

Generally accepted industry specifications for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide 

products are as follows: 

 

• Lithium carbonate – battery grade is minimum 99.5% Li2CO3 

• Lithium carbonate – technical grade is minimum 99% Li2CO3 ; and 

• Lithium hydroxide – minimum 56% LiOH.

19.2 Lithium Demand 
Global lithium demand is estimated to be approximately 184 kt LCE in 2015. Demand has 

been growing at a compound annual rate of approximately 6.6% since 1995, driven 

primarily by increases in battery applications. Battery applications accounted for an 

estimated 40% of total lithium demand in 2015 and are forecast to account for 70% of total 

demand in 2025. By 2025, total lithium demand is forecast to be approximately 525kt on 

an LCE basis (Figure 19.2).

Forecast lithium consumption rates are heavily influenced by assumptions around 

rechargeable battery demand. Rechargeable lithium batteries have in the past been used 

primarily in the portable consumable electronics sector but in recent years this has been 

overtaken by use in electric vehicles and grid/off-grid energy storage systems. South 

Korea and China are the dominant rechargeable battery and battery material producers. 

Roskill notes that growth rates for non-battery sectors have slowed significantly since 

2012.  

 

Forecasts for electric vehicle uptake, either as hybrids, plug in hybrids or full electric 

vehicles have recently been revised significantly upward by several industry observers 

(Deutsche Bank, 2016; Exane BNP Paribas, 2016) based on rapidly decreasing battery 

production costs, regulatory requirements in Europe and China, and most importantly, 

significantly improved battery technology permitting greater range and higher power. Many 

industry observers expect full electric battery vehicle production costs to equal internal 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

19-5 | P a g e  
 

combustion engine vehicle production costs between 2020 to 2025 (Exane BNP Paribas, 

2016). At that point, demand for full electric vehicles will increase significantly as there will 

no longer be a major price premium between EVs and standard vehicles and the operating 

costs savings for EVs compared to IC vehicles will drive demand. 

 

Deutsche Bank's forecast of electric vehicle demand is shown in Figure 19.3. BNP Paribas 

has a more robust forecast, as illustrated in Table 19.2.

New large scale lithium battery factories currently under development are attempting to 

reduce the cost of lithium batteries based on economies of scale in production to 

encourage more rapid uptake of electric vehicles as well as open new market sectors to 

lithium batteries. If these new battery mega-factories are successful and drive further 

increases in lithium battery demand, overall lithium demand will also be likely to 

accelerate. Roskill (2015) forecasts demand growth to be 9.8% p.a. for lithium carbonate 

and 15.1% per annum for lithium hydroxide through 2025. Under these forecasts, by 2025, 



Hains Engineering Company Limited 

 

19-6 | P a g e  
 

battery grade lithium carbonate and battery grade lithium hydroxide will be 43% and 14% 

respectively of total lithium demand. 

 

It is important to recognize that lithium represents a very small component on electric 

vehicle battery production costs, typically less than 3% of total cost, depending on the 

battery chemistry. The majority of battery production costs is represented by pack 

assembly, cell manufacturing and processed materials. Raw materials account for about 

21% of total manufacturing costs, but lithium represents only about 4% of the 21% for raw 

material costs based on NMC (Nickle-Manganese-Cobalt) battery chemistry, which uses 

lithium carbonate (Figure 19.4). 

 

FIGURE 19.4: BATTERY PACK PRODUCTION COSTS 
 

 
   Source: Exane BNP Paribas (2016), * assumes NMC battery chemistry 

 

As a consequence, lithium prices do not have a significant impact on total battery 

production costs and the total vehicle selling prices and thus lithium demand in battery 

applications will not be significantly impacted by increased prices for the raw material. This 

is illustrated in Table 19.3 which shows the impact of lithium carbonate pricing on selected 

electric vehicle manufacturers. It is seen that even a doubling of the lithium carbonate 

price will have only a very modest impact on the average vehicle selling price.

Global lithium production is dominated by four companies: Talison Lithium in Australia, 

SQM in Chile, Albemarle in Chile and the USA and FMC Lithium in Argentina. Together, 

the "Big 4" produced about 87% of the lithium supply in 2015 (Table 19.4).

To date, lithium production has kept up with rapid increases in demand, largely through 

production increases at higher cost swing producers such as Talison's Greenbushes hard 

rock mineral operation and production increases at Chinese brines. Future production 

increases to meet continued increases in consumption are still possible from these 

producers, especially Talison, but new, lower cost producers will be needed in the 

medium-term and could displace these high cost swing producers in the short term. 

19.3 Prices 

Prices for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, the primary lithium ion battery materials, 

are set by negotiation between buyer and seller. Prices have increased rapidly in the 

recent past from indicative pricing of $US 5,000 - $6,000/t in 2013 and 2014 for 99.0% - 

99.5% lithium carbonate to a current range of $US 9,500 to $US 10,500/t for lithium 

carbonate and approximately $US 13,500/tonne for lithium hydroxide. Spot prices in China 

for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide are considerably high, most recently in the 

range of $US 25,000/tonne to $US 30,000.  

19.4 Contracts 

Neither Bearing nor the Maricunga JV have entered into any contracts for production or 

sale of lithium or potassium salts as of the date of this technical report.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,PERMITTING, 
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

20.1 Environmental Studies 

Bearing has not undertaken any environmental studies related to the Salar de  Maricunga 

project. LI3 completed various studies required to support its 2011 exploration program 

and these studies were also used in support of MSB's geophysical work and pumping 

tests in 2015. The Maricunga JV as part of the 2016/7 Program has initiated baseline 

environmental, hydrogeological and biological studies in support of the Project 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).   

 

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) will be required prior to approval for and 

construction of any lithium brine extraction and processing plant. . It is expected that the 

EIA for the future brine operation will be completed by early 2018. The review and approval 

process period of an EIA by the SEA is generally 12 - 18 months. 

20.2 Project Permitting 

Sectorial permits (PS) need to be obtained from the local authorities in the III Region (as 

a matter of formality) once EIA approval is obtained and before construction is initiated. 

20.3 Social or Community Requirements 

The III Region of Chile has a well-established mining industry and culture. The Maricunga 

project is remote from any communities and population centers and therefore will not 

create any direct impacts.  The EIA permitting process will address community and socio-

economic issues; it is expected the project will have a positive impact through the creation 

of new employment opportunities and investment in the region.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

No detailed estimates of capital and operating costs have been completed. In 2011, Li3 

completed a preliminary analysis of capital and operating costs for a conventional solar 

evaporation process to demonstrate that brine could be potentially economically 

recovered and thus the estimated resources could be classified in accordance with NI 43-

101 definitions (Ehren-Gonzalez, 2011).  

 

The analysis was subsequently updated in 2015 (Ehren-Gonzalez, 2015). In both cases, 

the project design and costs estimates were based on recovery and processing of brines 

only from the Litio 1-6 tenements. The results of the updated analysis confirmed the 

conclusions from the 2011 study.

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 

Lithium is not currently exploitable via regular mining concessions in Chile, except for 

those tenements registered under the 1932 mining code. The Maricunga JV  mining 

concessions Cocina, Salamina, San Francisco and Despreciada  are deemed 

"Exploitation" Concessions  and are  "grandfathered" under the 1932 mining law and are  

approved for   lithium exploitation. The Litio 1-6 claims are constituted under the 1982 

Chilean mining code and will require additional permits from the Chilean government for 

the exploitation of lithium. The Chilean Mining Code establishes the reserve of lithium to 

the State of Chile and expressly provides that the exploration or exploitation of "non-

concessible" substances (including lithium) can be performed only directly by the State of 

Chile, or its companies, or by means of administrative concessions or special operation 

contracts, fulfilling the requirements and conditions set forth by the President of the 

Republic of Chile for each case.  

 

Chile has announced its intention to increase the exploitation of lithium, and to this effect 

has developed new administrative processes to amend the law to allow exploitation by 

private enterprises. As of the end of 2016, Chile has approved the granting of operating 

contracts for lithium brine production. .

This project combines the interests of Bearing, Minera Salar Blanco and Lithium Power 

International on the salar de Maricunga. MSB holds a 51% interest in Minera Li Energy 

and a 100% interest in other tenements, while LPI holds a 100% interest in the San 

Fransisco, Despreciada and Salamina tenements. The total tenement holdings of the 

Maricunga JV are 5,363 ha. LPI is the JV operator and will hold a 50% interest in the 

Maricunga JV project upon completion of all exploration and development obligations to 

the submission of a definitive Feasibility Study. MSB will hold a 32.3% interest in the 

Maricunga JV. Both Bearing and MSB maintain their interests in the Maricunga JV as free 

carry rights until submission and approval by the JV partners of a Definitive Feasibility 

Study to be completed by LPI. 

 

The Maricunga basin comprises a large drainage basin with an area of approximating 

2,200 km2. It is structurally controlled to the west by mountains which have been raised by 

inverse faults that expose a basement sequence ranging in age from Upper Paleozoic to 

Lower Tertiary.  To the southeast, the basin limit coincides with the Chilean-Argentine 

frontier, which is defined by a line of volcanic complexes with elevations up to 6,749 m 

(Nevada Tres Cruces) and a range of ages between 26 Ma and 6 Ma. Some of these 

volcanic complexes are associated with the characteristically auriferous mineralization of 

the Maricunga Belt. The eastern limit of the Basin is marked by the Cordillero Claudio Gay, 

a North-South trending mountain chain resting on a basement of Middle to Upper 

Paleozoic rocks and exposing deformed volcanoclastic sequences of Upper Oligocene to 

Lower Miocene rocks which represent remnants of the volcanic arc preserved on the 

margins of the Maricunga basin.

Salar de Maricunga is located in the northern part of the Maricunga basin and covers some 

140 km2.  The Salar is surrounded by alluvial deposits on the north, east and south, and 

by volcanic deposits on the west.  

 

The Salar itself is in-filled with alternating sequences of evaporates and clastic sediments. 

Results of drilling carried out on the Li3 property being acquired by Bearing indicate the 

presence of an upper mixed halite sequence that consists of massive halite beds and 

halite mixed with clay and silt-sized sediments with a combined thickness from three to 66 

m.  This upper zone is underlain by a sequence of silt and clays that are inter-bedded with 

coarser grained sands, gravels, conglomerates, and volcanic ashes.  

 

Results of drainable porosity (specific yield) testing carried out by Daniel B Stephens 

Laboratory in the USA indicate that on the Litio 19-27 tenement  the upper halite mix zone 

has an average drainable porosity of 3.4 percent, the sand mix units have an average 

drainable porosity of 6.1 and the silt –clay mixed layers 1.2 percent. Results of six pumping 

tests carried out on the upper halite mix zone indicate average specific yield values of 20 

percent and an average hydraulic conductivity of 89 m/d, indicative of permeable 

conditions in the upper brine aquifer. Long term pumping tests completed in 2015 on wells 

P1 and P2 on the Litio 19-27 tenement demonstrated high pumping rates of 37 – 38 L/sec. 

A 30-day pumping test completed in February, 2017 on Well P4 located on the Cocina 19-

27 tenement was carried out at a pumping rate of 25 l/sec.   

 

Salar de Maricunga is classified as a mixed type salar of the Na-Cl-Ca/SO4 system. The 

brines from Maricunga are solutions saturated in sodium chloride with total dissolved 

solids (TDS) of 26% (316 g/L) as an average, although in most areas exceed 27%. The 

average density is 1.200 g/cm3. The other components present in these brines, which 

constitute an aqueous complex system and exist also in other natural brines in Argentina, 

Bolivia and Chile are the following: K, Li, Mg, Ca, SO4, HCO3 and B, which below pH 7 

exists predominantly as un-dissociated H3BO3. Interesting values of strontium (mean of 

290 mg/L) also have been detected by ICP in the Maricunga brine. Table 25.1 provides 

an overview of the key components and ratios for the Maricunga brine.

Li3 completed an exploration program in 2011 on a specified grid to allow the estimation 

of measured "in-situ" brine resources over the Litio 1-6 mineral claims in Salar de 

Maricunga.  The drilling method used allowed for the collection of continuous core from 

which "undisturbed" samples at specified depth intervals could be prepared for laboratory 

porosity analyses and for the collection of depth-representative brine samples at specified 

depth intervals without possibility of contamination by drilling fluids.

Six sonic boreholes were completed to a depth of 150 m. Undisturbed samples were 

collected from the sonic core at three meter intervals for porosity analyses (318 samples).  

Brine samples were collected during the sonic drilling at three meter intervals for chemistry 

analyses (431 primary main samples and 192 QA/QC samples).  All sonic boreholes were 

completed as observation wells on completion of drilling. 

 

A total of 915 m of exploration RC drilling was carried out for the collection of chip samples 

for geologic logging, brine samples for chemistry analyses and airlift data to assess 

relative aquifer permeability. The RC boreholes were completed as observations wells for 

use during future pumping tests. Two test production wells were installed to a total depth 

of 150 m each for future pumping trials. 

 

A seismic tomography survey was carried out (23 line km) to help define basin lithology 

and basin geometry. Six test trenches were completed to a depth of 3m to carry out 

shallow pumping trials.  24 hour pumping tests were carried out in each trench. 

 

Table 25.2 summarizes the resource estimate prepared for the Litio 1-6 mineral claims in 

Salar de Maricunga.  It is in the opinion of the author that the brine chemistry and porosity 

data sets developed for the project are adequate and appropriate to carry out such 

resource estimates.

  2) based on a conversion factor from potassium metal to KCl of 1.91 

 
Based on drilling and exploration results of the 2011 campaign the brine deposit remains 

open in all directions beyond the boundaries of the Litio 1-6 claims and at depth. This has 

been confirmed by the most recent drilling and sampling activity undertaken by the 

Maricunga JV on the the Maricunga JV tenement package. 

 

To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no environmental, permitting, title, legal, 

technical, socio-economic, marketing, taxation, political or other factors which could 

materially affect the resource estimate that have not already been disclosed in this report.  

 

Results of airlift testing during the RC exploration drilling program and pumping tests on 

test trenches indicate that future brine production can be achieved through a combination 

of production wells and open trenches. The analyses of brine chemistry indicate that the 

brine is amenable to lithium and potash recovery through conventional technology.   It is 

believed that through the application of proprietary technology developed by Li3's strategic 

partner (POSCO) lithium recovery from the Maricunga brine can be significantly enhanced 

and may range from 45 percent to greater than 70 percent.  

 

Exploration work undertaken in 2015 and in 2016/2017 by MSB and LPI has confirmed 

the high lithium brine grades established by LI3 in 2011 extend beyond the limits of the 

Litio 1-6 and Cocina 19-27 claims to the other JV tenements. Deep drilling has confirmed 

the presence of high grade lithium brine below the 150 m level tested in the 2011 

exploration program. Lithium concentrations in raw brine average in excess of 

approximately 1,100 mg/L across the full extent of the tenements evaluated to date. 

Pumping tests data obtained from the 2015 and 2016/2017 exploration programs confirms 

high pumping rates can be achieved on the Litio 1-6 tenements and on the adjacent 

Cocina 19-27 tenements and at depths in excess of the maximum depths tested in the 

2011 exploration program. The available data indicates high pumping rates and high 

lithium brine values are likely to extend to the San Francisco, Despreciada and Salamina 

tenements comprising the balance of the Maricunga project. 

 

Pond evaporation test results confirm the evaporation pathways estimated from the 

experimental evaporation test work in 2011/12. Lithium brine collected from well P1 on the 

Litio 1-6 concession increased in concentration from 1,260 mg/L lithium to 6,300 mg/L
