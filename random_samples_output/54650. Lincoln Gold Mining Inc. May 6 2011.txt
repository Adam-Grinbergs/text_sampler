Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 1 

1.0 SUMMARY 

Tetra Tech Inc. (Tt) was originally retained by Lincoln Mining Corporation (Lincoln or Company)) 
to prepare a NI 43-101 resource estimate and Technical Report on the Oro Cruz Gold Project, 
located in Imperial County, California (see FIGURE 4-1).  This amended and restated Technical 
Report was prepared for Lincoln Mining Corporation and Elgin Mining Inc. (Elgin) in conjunction 
with a transaction involving a letter agreement between Lincoln and Elgin dated March 31, 2011 
granting Elgin the exclusive right and option to acquire up to a 60% undivided interest in the Oro 
Cruz Property from Lincoln.  None of the drilling data, assay data, and/or associated resource 
estimates from the original Technical Report dated September 10, 201 have changed.  Besides 
the letter agreement referenced above, the only other change is the addition of 63 claims to the 
Lincoln claim block which are shown in SECTION 4.0 of this report.  The Oro Cruz Gold Project 
is a property that was previously mined for gold and closed in the 1990s.  Because the project 
and supporting data predate the creation of the National Instrument 43-101, none of the original 
assay data meet current NI 43-101 and Canadian Institute of Mining (CIM) requirements for 
reporting of measured and indicated resource classes. Therefore, all of the reported resources 
are classified as inferred resources.  The purpose of the report is to report an inferred resource 
and to establish the presence of a sufficient quantity of metal that the expenditure of additional 
funds is warranted to attempt to convert the inferred resources into the measured and indicated 
classes. 

1.1 Location and Access 

The Property is located in the Tumco mining district in the Cargo Muchacho Mountains, 14 miles 
southeast of the operating Mesquite gold mine (New Gold Inc.) and is also adjacent to the 
American Girl gold mine (past producer, 428,000 ozs gold).  Access to the Property is via paved 
highway, approximately 35 minutes from Yuma, Arizona.   

1.2 Ownership 

Lincoln Gold US Corp., has concluded a Lease Agreement ("Lease") to acquire 20 lode claims 
covering the Oro Cruz gold deposit in Imperial County, California.  The Lease involves advance 
royalty payments beginning at US$50,000 per year and gradually increasing to $200,000 US 
per year in the 7th year. The NSR royalty has been set at 3% for the first 500,000 ounces of 
gold production and 4% thereafter.  An aggregate of 2% of the royalty can be bought down at a 
rate of $500,000 per half point.  The Company has staked an additional 63 claims which has 
increased their total claim holdings to 131 claims (2,620 acres) surrounding the Property. 

1.3 Permitting and Environmental 

A multi-agency regulatory process will be needed to obtain all required federal, state and local 
agency permits and approvals necessary to construct, operate and ultimately close the Oro 
Cruz mine and ore processing operations.  The project site is located in the southeast corner of 
Imperial County, California, on federal public lands administered by the  El Centro Field Office of 
the U. S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The BLM is expected 
to be the lead agency for the regulatory process, ensuring all required federal, state and local 
permits and approvals are obtained. 

The Imperial County Planning and Development Services Department (PDSD) will be the co-
lead agency for the overall mine permitting and approval process. The PDSD will issue a 
Special Use Permit for the mine and ore processing operations in accordance with the Imperial 
County Code of Ordinances, Title 9, Land Use Code, Division 20, Surface Mining and 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 2 

Reclamation.  Other County departments, along with various State and Federal agencies will 
issue appropriate  permits, approvals or concurrences for various mine operations and activities 
in accordance with applicable County, State and Federal ordinances, guidelines, regulations 
and laws. 

The proposed mine project constitutes both federal and state actions.  The federal action will be 
assessed for potential environmental impacts as required by the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (NEPA).  The project will also be assessed in accordance with the California 
Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), to ensure state regulatory requirements in regards 
to environmental assessment and protection are met.  A multi-resource baseline study program 
would be implemented to collect the data required to support the completion of the NEPA/CEQA 
process.  

1.4 Geology 

The Oro Cruz Property is located in the Cargo Muchacho Mountains of southeastern California.  
The range is comprised of well-foliated gneiss and schist of the Jurassic (?) Tumco Formation 
which has been metamorphosed to amphibolite facies.  Mesozoic biotite granite and associated 
pegmatite dikes cut the Tumco Formation and also cut Mesozoic hornblende-biotite quartz 
monzonite.  The granite and monzonite form large intrusive bodies in the range.  The principal 
structural fabric in the range is west-northwest.  Low-angle faults are cut by northwest trending 
faults. 

1.5 Deposit Type and Mineralization 

The Oro Cruz gold deposit is believed to be a detachment-fault-related gold deposit consisting 
of replacement mineralization along a low-angle detachment (listric) fault related to an 
extensional fault system in the Cargo Muchacho Mountains.  Previously, Texasgulf believed that 
the Oro Cruz gold deposit was an exhalite.  Mineralization is hosted wholly within the Tumco 
Formation. 

Mesothermal mineralization occurs in multiple brown to brownish gray siliceous zones 
containing hematite, magnetite, quartz, mica, feldspar, chlorite, and blue copper oxides.  Native 
gold containing very low silver is associated with iron oxides.  Most gold is very fine with ±64% 
<1 to 5 microns in size.  No significant toxic elements are present as are found in epithermal 
deposits.  The "ore" is considered inert. 

The main Oro Cruz (aka Cross, Golden Cross) mineralized zone has an elongate tabular shape 
that is generally concordant to foliation (assumed bedding) and dips approximately 25° to the 
southeast (120°).  The deposit at ± 0.01 opt gold cutoff grade is approximately 580 ft wide, 350 
ft thick, and has a known down-dip length of about 2,800 ft, including a portion mined out by the 
existing pit.  Abundant high-grade stringers (>0.1 opt gold) occur within a lower grade envelope 
grading 0.01 to 0.05 opt gold.  Continuity of mineralization appears good to excellent.  Isolated 
stringers occur above and below the principal zone of Oro Cruz mineralization.  The deposit 
remains open down dip. 

Multiple satellite deposits or mineralized zones have been identified in proximity to the Oro Cruz 
deposit.  The nearby Queen deposit was mined by open-pit methods and backfilled.  Low-grade 
gold resources remain buried in the Queen pit floor.

1.6 Exploration, Drilling, and Sampling 

As of the date of this Technical Report, Lincoln has not completed any exploration mapping, 
geochemical sampling, or exploration drilling.  These programs are anticipated to be part of the 
proposed work plan for the project. 

1.7 Metallurgy 

As of the date of this report, Lincoln Mining Corporation has not collected any metallurgical 
samples and/or completed any metallurgical testwork.  However, there is a history of both 
testing and production from the site and certain inferences can be reasonably made with 
respect to expected process and metallurgical performance. Historical production techniques 
and prior testing by reputable, independent, third-party laboratories shows the ore to be 
amenable to cyanide leach technology, and depending on the crush size has shown gold 
recoveries by straight forward heap leaching in excess of 70 percent.  Crushing and grinding to 
finer sizes increases recovery at an increase in cost.   Further study will be required to define 
the appropriate process to maximize recovery while minimizing costs. 

1.8 Mineral Resource Estimate 

Tt has prepared an independent resource estimate based on the historic drillhole data, current 
topographic map, and underground workings provided by Lincoln and/or the underlying property 
owner.  As the underlying data are not able to meet current NI 43-101 and Canadian Institute of 
Mining (CIM) basic criteria for an indicated or measured resource estimate with regard to 
documentation of the drilling, collection of samples, assaying, assay QA/QC, sample security, 
etc, the estimated resources have been classified as inferred. 

The sole purpose of preparing this resource estimate was to: 

1. Prove that sufficient data exist and the tenor of the mineralization is such that a "prudent 
man" would continue to invest in the project to develop measured and indicated resource 
estimates, and 

2. Provide a development plan for the work plan that will, assuming that results are as 
expected, convert the inferred resources into the indicated and measured categories and 
examine potential additions to the known mineralization. 

With respect to the inferred resource reported in this technical report, Tt would like to point out 
that a significant amount of information formed the basis of the estimate.  The information has 
come from a number of different sources, some of which are independent third-party 
companies, and has formed a coherent, well-founded indication of the remaining mineralization 
on the Oro Cruz property.  TABLE 1-1 details the sources of the information and the relative 
quantity of data.  TABLE 1-2 details the information that was used as the basis of the individual 
resource estimation areas.  In the process of preparing this Technical Report, Tt has undertaken 
a significant amount of check work in order to verify, where possible, the accuracy of the data 
and ensure that is forms an internally-consistent database that accurately reflects the tenor and 
quantity of mineralization present at the Oro Cruz property. 

Where identifiable and verifiable, any surface and underground workings have been removed 
from the estimated tonnage.

1.9 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

As of the date of this report, the Oro Cruz Gold Project does not have any CIM definable mineral 
reserves.  

1.10 Conclusions 

It is Tt's opinion that the Oro Cruz Gold Project warrants additional study and evaluation.  There 
are sufficient historic data to have produced an inferred resource estimate that is of sufficient 
tenor that a "prudent man" would continue to invest in the exploration and development of the 
project.  The next step in Lincoln's work plan involves the completion of twin-hole confirmation 
drilling in order to produce a resource estimate that can be classified in the indicated and 
measured categories and an exploration program designed to expand the known resources. 

1.11 Proposed Work Plan 

Lincoln's future plans include twin-hole drilling, reducing drillhole spacing, bulk density testing, 
preliminary metallurgical testwork, location of a suitable water source and baseline 
environmental studies, continued surface geologic mapping, and securing adequate supplies of 
water and power.  Because the Oro Cruz (Cross) and the Queen deposits contain the majority 
(+90 percent) of the known gold mineralization, only these deposits will be concentrated on for 
the initial compliance programs.  The remaining deposits represent potential additions to the 
Oro Cruz (Cross) and Queen deposits and will likely be subject to additional exploration in the 
future.  These items are required for the project to proceed toward feasibility.

Tt has reviewed these costs and timelines and believes that they represent the next logical 
progression in the redevelopment of the Oro Cruz Gold Project and that they reflect realistic 
estimates of the costs to complete the work plan identified. 

1.12 Potential Limitations 

Tt is not aware of any potential limitations to the project that would materially change any of the 
data, resource estimates, environmental considerations, socio-economic factors, or conclusions 
presented within this report that are outside of the normal factors that may impact mining 
projects, such as price variability, exchange rates, permitting time, etc.  With respect to the Oro 
Cruz Gold Project, there are no existing environmental liabilities, potential new environmental 
issues are part of this and future studies and are not anticipated to materially impact the path 
forward.  Exploration and development drilling, as well as metallurgical testing and analyses are 
expected to continue in 2011.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 General 

Tetra Tech Inc. (Tt) was originally retained by Lincoln Mining Corporation (Lincoln or Company)) 
to prepare a NI 43-101 resource estimate and Technical Report on the Oro Cruz Gold Project, 
located in Imperial County, California (see FIGURE 4-1).  This amended and restated Technical 
Report was prepared for Lincoln Mining Corporation and Elgin Mining Inc. (Elgin) in conjunction 
with a transaction involving a letter agreement between Lincoln and Elgin dated March 31, 2011 
granting Elgin the exclusive right and option to acquire up to a 60% undivided interest in the Oro 
Cruz Property from Lincoln.  None of the drilling data, assay data, and/or associated resource 
estimates from the original Technical Report dated September 10, 201 have changed.  Besides 
the letter agreement referenced above, the only other change is the addition of 63 claims to the 
Lincoln claim block which are shown in SECTION 4.0 of this report.   

2.2 Purpose of Report  

The purpose of the original report was to prepare an inferred mineral resource estimate for the 
Oro Cruz Gold Project based on the available historic exploration drillhole and production 
blasthole data.  This resource estimate will be subsequently used to develop the strategy to 
move the project forward to include the development of indicated and measured resource 
estimates. This amended and restated Technical Report was prepared for Lincoln Mining 
Corporation and Elgin Mining Inc. (Elgin) in conjunction with a transaction involving a letter 
agreement between Lincoln and Elgin dated March 31, 2011 granting Elgin the exclusive right 
and option to acquire up to a 60% undivided interest in the Oro Cruz Property from Lincoln. The 
only material change in this report is the addition of 63 lode claims staked by Lincoln in August 
and November 2010.   

2.3 Effective Date 

The effective date of the mineral resource statements in this report is September 20, 2010 and 
the effective date of this amended and restated report is April 29, 2011.  None of the drilling 
data, assay data, and/or associated resource estimates from the original Technical Report 
dated September 10, 201 have changed.  Besides the letter agreement referenced above, the 
only other change is the addition of 63 claims to the Lincoln claim block which are shown in 
SECTION 4.0 of this report

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION  

4.1 Location 

The Property is located (FIGURE 4-1) in the Tumco mining district in the Cargo Muchacho 
Mountains, 14 miles southeast of the operating Mesquite gold mine (New Gold Inc.) and is also 
adjacent to the American Girl gold mine (past producer, 428,000 ozs gold).  Access to the 
Property is via paved highway, approximately 35 minutes from Yuma, Arizona.  Gold mining 
occurred in the area during 1890-1916 and 1932-1941, producing greater than 150,000 ozs 
gold.  In the mid 1990's, the property was developed as the "Golden Cross" mine by MK Gold 
Company.  MK Gold produced 61,000 ozs of gold in one year from both open-pit and 
underground mining.  Mining ceased in 1996 due to low gold prices, (average of $380.00 per 
ounce).  Prior to cessation, MK Gold was conducting a significant pit wall push back to reach in-
place "ore."  Gold mineralization remains exposed in the open pit and in underground workings.   

4.2 Mineral Title in the US 

Mineral titles can be held by a number of methods in the US.  Typically, these are by either 
patented or unpatented lode mining claims.  In the case of the Oro Cruz Gold Project, all of the 
mining claims are unpatented lode mining claims that are located on Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) administered lands.   Under US Law, title to mineral claims do not expire as 
long as payment of the annual fee per mineral claim is made. 

4.2.1 Property Title 

The claim ownership associated with the Oro Cruz Gold Project is a mixture of leased claims 
from the underlying owner of the mineral deposit and claims that have been staked by Lincoln.  
TABLES 4-1 and 4-2 detail the ownership, respectively.   

TABLE 4-1 describes the 20 contiguous unpatented lode mining claims that are located in the 
Tumco/Cargo Muchacho Mining District, San Bernardino Base and Meridian, Imperial County, 
California.  These claims are owned by ADGIS, Inc. 210 South Rock Blvd., Reno, Nevada 
89502.  They are under contract to Lincoln Gold US Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Lincoln 
Mining Corp.) as part of the Oro Cruz Gold Project as defined in the executed Mining Lease 
Agreement dated February 23, 2010.

In addition to the above fees that are paid to governmental agencies, Lincoln also has holding 
costs to be paid to ADGIS Inc.  The Lease involves advance royalty payments beginning at 
US$50,000 per year and gradually increasing to $200,000 US per year in the 7th year. The NSR 
royalty has been set at 3% for the first 500,000 ounces of gold production and 4% thereafter.  
An aggregate of 2% of the royalty can be bought down at a rate of $500,000 per half point. 

Lincoln contracted G.I.S. Land Services of Reno, Nevada to complete the Title Review.  G.I.S. 
Land Services provides certified professional land services (MS RPL #32306) that provide 
independent third-party surface and mineral title abstracts. 

In addition to the claim information, G.I.S. Land Services did find other claims in the general 
area that is potentially owned by another entity.  This claim is referred to as the "Block 13 
Sovereign Claim".  It is not sufficiently close to the envisaged exploration and/or development 
area to hinder continued exploration and development work, but will need to be investigated 
further.  According to G.I.S. Land Service: 

 "Michael G. Tornabene transferred these claims by Quitclaim Deed 0n August 26, 2002 
to Paul D. Hartley.  The deed from Michael G. Tornabene to Paul D. Hartley contains 
language that he is ''part owner thereof' concerning the Hercules 31 and 32 Lode claims, 
as conveyed.  However the exact portion of ownership being transferred is not stated 
and the owner of the remaining portion is not named. 

Mr. Hartley transferred his interest by Quitclaim Deed on November 3, 2008 to Adgis, 
Inc.  The deed from Paul D. Hartley to Adgis, Inc. does not mention any proportionate 
ownership of the Hercules 31 and 32 Lode claims. 

Adgis, Inc. has entered into a purchase agreement for the subject claims with Lincoln 
Gold US Corp. for some time in 2010.  No documents were recorded concerning the 
agreement with Lincoln Gold US Corp. as of January 8, 2010, according to our search of 
the computerized records at the Imperial County Recorder's office. 

Block 13 Sovereign Claim: According to the BLM LR2000 report of closed claims run 
on January 13, 2010, a Sovereign claim did exist with the last assessment year as 1980 
and a closed date of April 17, 1986.  A search of the closed claims listing did not find 
Brigham Young University listed as owners of any claims.  A run of the active claims in 
this same township did not list any claims as owned by Brigham Young University.  A 
Block 13 (1 acre) of Sovereign Lode claim is not listed in any of the on line LR2000 
records; however, the book and page referenced for the Certificate of Location do 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc.

match, indicating that they are one and the same referenced claim.  The Serial Register 
page for the Sovereign claim indicates that the owners according to the BLM are Michael 
Tornabene and Joseph P. Lastella.  A memorandum from  the BLM dated October 1, 
1982 responded to the Proof of Annual Labor dated December 11, 1981 filed by 
Brigham Young University.  The memo states that the BLM records indicate that 
Brigham Young University is not a claimant for the Hercules No. 31 and 32 Lode mining 
claims.  In addition, the BLM does not have any record of the Block 13 of Sovereign 
Lode claim as being recorded with the Sacramento BLM office." 

G.I.S. Land Services recommended that "…the issues and questions involving the BYU Block 
13 parcel be discussed with your legal counsel.  The validity of the BYU parcel in light of the 
Quiet Title suit and subsequent transfers not naming this possible interest, necessitate a legal 
opinion to determine the potential validity of ownership." 

As of the date of this report, the Lease Agreement between ADGIS Inc and Lincoln Gold US 
Corp. for the Oro Cruz claims has been recorded with the Imperial County Recorder's office. 

4.3 Permits 

A multi-agency regulatory process will be completed to obtain all required federal, state and 
local agency permits and approvals necessary to construct, operate and ultimately close the 
Oro Cruz mine and ore processing operations.  The project site is located in the southeast 
corner of Imperial County, California, on federal public lands administered by the  El Centro 
Field Office of the U. S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The 
BLM is expected to be the lead agency for the regulatory process, ensuring all required federal, 
state and local permits and approvals are obtained.  The BLM would issue federal approval for 
the operations in accordance with their Surface Management Regulations contained Title 43 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 3809 (43 CFR 3809).  The BLM will require the submittal 
of a mine Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan, prepared in accordance with 43 CFR 3809, 
that details the proposed mine operations, along with reclamation and closure activities.  The 
BLM will also require the placement of a financial guarantee (reclamation bond) to ensure 
reclamation is completed in accordance with the approved plan.  

The Imperial County Planning and Development Services Department (PDSD) will be the co-
lead agency for the overall mine permitting and approval process. The PDSD will issue a 
Special Use Permit for the mine and ore processing operations in accordance with the Imperial 
County Code of Ordinances, Title 9, Land Use Code, Division 20, Surface Mining and 
Reclamation.  Division 20 ensures the operations are regulated in accordance with the 
applicable State of California laws and regulations affecting mining and ore processing 
operations.   

Other County departments, along with various State and Federal agencies will issue appropriate  
permits, approvals or concurrences for various mine operations and activities in accordance 
with applicable County, State and Federal ordinances, guidelines, regulations and laws.  Other 
County Departments include the Air Pollution Control District; the Public Works Department; and 
the Public Health Department.  Other State agencies include the California State Water 
Resources Control Board (WRCB), Division of Water Rights; the Colorado River Regional Water 
Quality Control Board (RWQCB); the California Department of Toxic Substances Control 
(DTSC); the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG); and the California State Historic 
Preservation Office (SHPO).   Additional Federal agencies include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (USFWS); the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USCOE); and the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF).  Coordination with the Lower Colorado River Water Authority 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 23 

(LCRWA), assisted by the City of Needles, California as federal water manager, could be 
required for the drilling of new water wells in the vicinity of the mine site.   

The proposed mine project constitutes both federal and state actions.  The federal action will be 
assessed for potential environmental impacts as required by the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (NEPA).  The project will also be assessed in accordance with the California 
Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), to ensure state regulatory requirements in regards 
to environmental assessment and protection are met.  NEPA and CEQA are not permit or 
approval actions.  They are assessment programs which analyze and disclose to the public the 
potential impacts to the environment that could result from the proposed action and or 
alternatives; assess the level of significance for each identified impact; and propose mitigation 
measures to reduce the potential impact from the selected proposed action to a less than 
significant level.  It is expected the environmental documentation program would be completed 
as a joint NEPA/CEQA action coordinated by the BLM and Imperial County PDSD.  A multi-
resource baseline study program would be implemented to collect the data required to support 
the completion of the NEPA/CEQA process. 

4.3.1 List of Permits and Approvals 

TABLE 25-2 presents a summary list of the key federal, state and local permits and approvals, 
by agency that would be required for the Oro Cruz mine project.  Note that consultation with the 
BLM and the PDSD at Imperial County would assist in determining a complete list of all required 
permits and approvals for the project.

4.4 Potential Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts and Issues 

The lifecycle of a mining project, from exploration through mine construction, operations and 
finally, reclamation and closure can have significant impacts, both positive and negative on the 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 25 

socio-economic and environmental and resources within the local and regional mine project 
area.  A successful, environmentally aware mining company is committed to understanding the 
extent of these impacts and implements measures to mitigate them at every stage of the mining 
lifecycle.  This is accomplished through a multi-stage planning, environmental review and 
permitting process that includes prudent and sensible planning and design, and conscientious 
implementation of exploration, mining and related activities.  The end result is a project that 
contributes to the long-term, positive environmental and social legacy of the mining project on 
the local and regional environment.  

Starting with exploration, a mineral exploration/mining company normally makes a substantial 
capital investment in a mineral exploration program.  Should the results of this program prove 
positive, the company then makes another substantial investment in a developmental drilling 
and feasibility study to evaluate whether the potential mine site would be an economically 
feasible operation.  Once a decision is made to develop a mine and bring it on line, the time and 
costs to permit the site, along with the actual construction costs require another substantial 
capital investment.  All told, a company invests millions of dollars into the project, before it 
produces one single ounce of economic mineral.   

The positive financial impacts of these activities on the local and regional area and economy 
would be substantial in terms of  the number of jobs created and the associated salaries; 
increases in local and regional sales/use tax; increased demand for services and supplies from 
local and regional sources such as restaurants/cafes, motels, gas stations, grocery stores, 
equipment/automobile repair shops, and equipment/supply sources, etc.; increases in County 
property taxes and net proceeds taxes; and possibly charitable donations.  Note that under 
current economic conditions, mining companies and their financial backers do not make 
substantial capital investments in "short-term" projects.  Projects and their financial impacts 
should be viewed as "long-term", most likely in the range of 10 years or more.   

Development of a mine project would result in minor impacts to the public infrastructure services 
sector.  There would be increased demands for housing, both permanent and rental; and key 
community services including law enforcement, fire protection, medical aid, and schools.  
However, the workforce is expected to be drawn from regional communities including El Centro, 
Brawley, Niland and the greater Palm Springs, California area; and the greater Yuma, Arizona 
area.  The public infrastructure for these areas is already in place, and therefore these impacts 
would be minimal in nature.    

All mining projects have a finite "economic life".  Depending on the size and availability of the 
mineral resource, along with national and international market conditions, a project eventually 
reaches the reclamation and closure stage.  At this point, there would be a gradual reduction in 
employment, along with associated salaries and the need for services and supplies.  However, 
this reduction in workforce and need for services would have been assessed during the 
planning/permitting and environmental review process, with appropriate mitigation measures 
ready for implementation.  One of the key mitigation activities would be the conversion of the 
mine site infrastructure to alternative, suitable use that would provide for a sustainable, positive 
economic impact to the local and regional area. Converting the mine site to a compatible 
alternative use allows the owner/operator to realize continued economic benefits from the site 
and its infrastructure, whether it is through continued ownership and operation of the new 
facility, or income through a lease or a direct sale of the site to a new and different type of 
operating company.  Development of the mine site to another sustainable economic use would 
also provide continued financial support to current employees who may be retained by the new 
operation and the surrounding community in general. 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 26 

Depending on the age and size of the facility, the existing site infrastructure site location and 
ease of access, a mine site can be converted to several post-mining sustainable uses.  
Examples include various types of industrial facilities, research and development (R&D), a 
renewable energy facility (wind or solar power), a landfill for the disposal of municipal solid 
waste or hazardous materials, or a source of aggregate and construction materials.  These 
activities are consistent with similar projects in Imperial County.   

Conversion of the site to another sustainable use can potentially reduce or eliminate several 
potential environment liabilities.  For example, experience indicates that spent leach ore can 
possibly be used for aggregate/construction materials.  If this type of use is approved by the 
appropriate regulatory agencies, the processing of the spent leach ore into an 
aggregate/construction material, and the subsequent sale and removal of the ore off a mine site 
eliminates a heap leach facility as a long-term environmental liability. In summary, the 
implementation of a viable post-mining sustainable development program could result in the 
following positive benefits to Imperial County:  

 Provide for additional economic income to the original operating company from a 
property scheduled for closure.  The original company can realize the income by 
continued ownership and operation of the converted site, or by lease or direct sale to a 
new company.   

 Eliminate potential environmental liabilities associated with a particular property. 

 Diversify operations at an existing site that could extend the economic life of the 
property. 

 Assist in maintaining the economic viability of the surrounding community(s). 

The lifecycle of a mining project can also impact natural, environmental and biological resources 
within the general mine site area.  These resources could include, but are not limited to, air 
quality; surface and groundwater water quality and quantity; soils; and vegetation and wildlife 
resources including special status species.  As discussed above, a successful, environmentally 
aware mining company is committed to understanding the extent of these impacts and 
implements measures to mitigate them at every stage of the mining lifecycle.  This starts with 
the initial planning/permitting and environmental review program; and follows through the entire 
lifecycle, from the implementation of exploration and mining activities, through reclamation and 
closure. With proper implementation and management, the result is a mining lifecycle that 
provides for the multiple uses of natural, environmental and biological resources while 
minimizing impacts.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

The Oro Cruz Gold Project is located about 23.5 miles northwest of the city of Yuma, Arizona.  
Access to the property is by US Interstate 8 west from Yuma to north bound County Highway 
S34 for approximately 8.4 miles, then east on the gravel road to the historic Tumco Gold Mine 
Town site.   

5.2 Climate 

The climate of the Oro Cruz Gold Project area is arid, with high temperatures in the summer 
generally in the 100-110°F range and winter highs generally in the 70-80°F range.  Winter 
temperatures are rarely below 32°F.  Based on data collected and reported by the Yuma 
weather station, the average annual temperature is 73°F. The lowest minimum average 
temperatures occur during January and are typically in the range of 41 to 44oF.  Precipitation 
can occur throughout the year, but is most common during the late-summer months (August, 
September) or during the winter months of January through March.  Annual precipitation for the 
area surrounding the Oro Cruz Gold Project totals less than three inches per year.  The majority 
of a year's precipitation typically occurs in one or two short-duration storm events.  Annual 
evaporation as measured and reported by the Yuma weather station is approximately 98 inches 
per year. 

The combination of low precipitation and high evaporation results in a situation where surface 
runoff from the area is uncommon. Washes in the area are dry and will channel runoff only 
during severe storm events. On average, this may occur once per year, although it is not 
uncommon to have one to two year periods with no surface flows.  When surface flows do 
occur, washes will typically flow for periods of less than one hour 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Power Supply 

A 92 kV power line administered by the Imperial Irrigation District Power Company is located 
less than 1 mile west of the Oro Cruz Property.  At the present time, no issues with regard to 
electrical power availability are anticipated. 

Water Supply 

At the present time, there is no water available at the project site.  In order to restart mining 
operations, water will need to be developed and pumped to the site.  Water could possibly be 
purchased from the Gold Rock Ranch and pumped to the site, however it is expected the wells 
supplying this water would not meet the required demand for a mine and ore processing 
operation.  Lincoln Gold could also drill new water wells.   As discussed in Section 4.3.2.1 of this 
report, the Imperial County Planning and Development Services Department would issue a 
permit for the drilling and operation of water wells.  This activity would be coordinated with the 
California WRCB, Division of Water Rights which regulates all activities related to water rights, 
from the initial filing of applications to appropriate groundwater, to the issuance of the water 
rights permit or license.  As discussed in Section 4.3.3 of this report, drilling of new water wells 
should also be coordinated with the City of Needles, which serves as the federal water manager 
for the Lower Colorado River Water Authority (LCRWA).  This coordination would ensure there 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 28 

are no regulatory issues associated with groundwater that falls under the jurisdiction of the 
LCRWA and is designated for agriculture use in the Imperial Valley.   

New water wells drilled on private land could be subject to environmental assessment under 
CEQA; however the need to complete this type of assessment would be determined by the 
Imperial County Planning and Development Services Department.  Wells drilled on BLM 
managed public land would be subject to various federal permitting requirements, including right 
of way uses, and possibly NEPA environmental documentation.  Transmission lines that would 
deliver power to new well site(s) would be subject to local, state, and federal permitting and 
environmental documentation activities as determined by the Imperial County Planning and 
Development Services Department and the BLM. 

Transportation Facilities 

Access to the site from Yuma Arizona is currently by a US Interstate highway and a California 
paved county road.  From the county road, the site is accessible by gravel roads.  Should 
mining operations be restarted, the access from the county road to the mine facilities will need 
to be improved. 

Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 

At the present time, there are no facilities at the project site other that the portal and vent shaft 
that provided access and fresh air, respectively to the MK Gold underground mine area.  In 
addition, there are some historic foundations and remnants of the mining operations from the 
early 1900s, however, they are located sufficiently far from the planned mining area they are not 
anticipated to be an issue should sufficient mineralization be developed to support re-starting of 
commercial mining operations. 

Manpower 

Accommodations, supplies, and labor are available in either Brawley, California, population 
22,000 (2000 census), or Yuma, Arizona, population 77,500 (2006 census).  At the present 
time, no issues with the availability of labor are anticipated. 

5.4 Physiography 

The Oro Cruz Gold Project is located in the Cargo Muchacho Mountains, within the Mojave 
Desert and the Colorado Desert physiographic provinces, at an elevation ranging between 500 
ft and 2,000 ft above sea level.  Roughly 75 percent of the property is steep and mountainous, 
with the remainder being a level sloping alluvial fan.  Vegetation in the immediate area generally 
consists of very sparse desert vegetation with creosote bush, brittle brush, barrel cactus, cholla 
cactus and octillio cactus.

6.0 HISTORY 

Any references to resources and/or reserves within SECTION 6.0 are historic in nature and do 
not comply with current CIM standards or NI 43-101 standards for reporting of mineral 
resources and/or reserves.  The reader is cautioned that  Neither the QP nor Lincoln have 
done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or 
mineral reserves, and the QP and Lincoln are not treating the historical estimate as 
current mineral resources or mineral reserves as defined in Section 1.2 and 1.3 of NI43-
101, hence the historical estimate should not be relied on. 

6.1 Early History 

The following introductory history of the general area where the Oro Cruz Gold Project is 
located is from "Desert Fever – An Overview of Mining History of the California Desert 
Conservation Area – Imperial County," by Larry M. Vredenburgh, Gary L. Shumway, and 
Russell D. Hartill (1980). 

"CALIFORNIA'S FIRST SPANISH MINERS  

Soldiers, settlers, and laborers, part of two mission colonies under the administration of 
Francisco Garces, mined placer gold in the southeastern Chocolate Mountains in 1780 and 
1781. Their mining methods were simple. Placer gold was recovered by winnowing (tossing the 
lighter materials away by gently shaking a blanket in the wind). Dry washers may also have 
been used. Their mining endeavors, almost recreational in nature (as they were not mining gold 
for a living) ended abruptly when the Yuma Indians attacked the two missions on July 17, 1781, 
killing at least 50 men and taking 67 women and children captive. Mining activity was resumed 
in this area only after the establishment of the Mexican Republic in 1823. 

Also worked in the 1780's were the placer grounds of Jackson Gulch and the oxide ores of 
Padre Madre Valley in the Cargo Muchacho Mountains. The Padre y Madre Mine, located 13 
miles northwest of Yuma and 3 miles northwest of Ogilby, was one of the most extensively 
developed early mines. The mine enjoyed a modest production from the 1780's until 1894 with 
few interruptions.  

Even the name of the mountain range speaks of the early interest in mining in the area. 
Reportedly in the early 1800s two young lads playing at prospecting in imitation of their fathers 
came into camp with their shirts loaded with gold ore. Their antics resulted in the name of Cargo 
Muchacho, for the mountains where they had made their find. Although it is difficult to estimate 
the area's gold production during the Spanish and Mexican eras (1780-1848) it was probably 
not more than half a million dollars. 

William P. Blake, a geologist with Lt. Williamson's Pacific Railroad exploration party, was the 
first Anglo-American to visit the southern portion of the Cargo Muchacho Mountains with an eye 
toward mining. In 1853 he reported seeing several quartz veins from three inches to a foot or 
two in thickness. His observations were recorded in official government reports, but no one 
acted upon this evidence of possible mineralization until the Southern Pacific Railroad between 
Yuma and the coast was completed in 1877. With a safe means of transporting bullion to market 
now at hand, prospectors and developers flooded into the area. 

CARGO MUCHACHO MINE  

One of the first deposits to be commercially developed on a large scale in the Cargo Muchacho 
Mountains was the Cargo Muchacho Mine. Located by Thomas Porter Neet in 1877, within 5 
years 14,000 tons of ore had been mined, yielding $168,000 in gold. The ore averaged $12 per 
ton. The mine was surveyed for patent in 1892, but two years later it was idle. A six year 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 30 

renewal of activity began in 1936 when ore left on the mine dump was cyanided. Total 
production figures for the Cargo Muchacho Mine are estimated at more than 25,700 ounces of 
gold valued at $852,000. 

TUMCO MINE  

Peter Walters discovered the Gold Rock Mine (located 4 miles northwest of the Cargo 
Muchacho Mine) in 1884, and shortly thereafter sold out to developers for $75,000. The 
developers renamed the mine the Golden Cross in 1892. The Golden Cross Mining and Milling 
Company immediately embarked upon a development program, and the flourishing town that 
sprang up around the mines was named Hedges, in honor of the firm's vice president.  

The company paid $3 a day wages. This was reasonable in those days, but the successful 
camps as a rule always paid $4. This caused one irate miner to write to the Arizona Sentinel 
suggesting the company's name be changed to the "White Man's Slavery Company of 
California." 

In 1910 a new company took over and the mine was renamed Tumco, (an acronym for The 
United Mines Company). The Tumco mine was also known as the Hedges, Gold Rock, Golden 
Cross, Golden Crown, Golden Queen, Good Luck, King, Sovereign, Sovereign East, and 
Sovereign West mines. 

Ore from both the Cargo Muchacho and Golden Cross mines was at first treated by the Yuma 
Mill and Mining Company's twenty-stamp mill located at EI Rio, 6 miles south of Yuma. Later, 
the Golden Cross Mining and Milling Company began construction of a forty-stamp mill when 
their ore production overloaded the twenty-stamp mill in the early 1890's. By 1896 they had 
increased their milling facilities to 100 stamps, but were experiencing considerable difficulty with 
recovering the gold from their low grade ore.  

The company discovered in the spring of 1896 that finer crushing of the ore was needed to 
release the free milling gold from the matrix. Finer screens were installed as well, resulting in a 
greater percentage of gold saved. A 12-mile pipeline from the Colorado River supplied the mill 
reservoir with 250,000 gallons of water at a cost of about ten cents per ton of ore crushed. 
Worked continually from 1892 until 1917, and again from 1937 until 1942, the Tumco mines 
have produced 45 percent of the total county gold production, or some $2,863,000.10  

In 1896, the shaft at the Golden Queen Mine was 550 feet deep on a 40 percent incline, and the 
Golden Cross and Golden Crown shafts were 250 feet and 350 feet deep respectively. By 1914, 
the Golden Cross shaft had been extended to 1,100 feet, and at that time the Tumco mines 
were said to be the second largest mine in the United States producing gold from low grade ore. 
Its underground workings total more than 8 miles. The town of Hedges (also renamed Tumco in 
1910) supported a population of several thousand in the late 1800s. By 1900 there were several 
dozen buildings, two cemeteries, a dance hail, a volunteer fire department, and a miner's union. 
The population was reduced to 30 by 1942. 

PASADENA MINE  

Between the discovery of Peter Walter's Gold Rock Mine in 1884 and the American Girl Mine in 
1892, Thomas Grimes of Pasadena located the Pasadena Mine. Its ore ran 16 dollars to the ton 
in gold and was milled on the Colorado River. The Pasadena and the Guadalupe Mine 
(discovered in 1887) comprise with the Cargo Muchacho the easternmost mines of the Cargo 
Muchacho District.  

AMERICAN GIRL MINE  

Johnson and Lohman discovered the American Girl Mine, located 2 miles north of the Cargo 
Muchacho Mine, in 1892. By 1900 it had produced 30,000 tons of ore that averaged $8 per ton 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 31 

in gold. Inactive from 1900 until 1913, during the next 3 years the mine went on to produce 
20,000 tons of ore that averaged $6.50 per ton in gold. A cloudburst during the second week of 
November, 1914, flooded the lower workings, occasioning a 4 month delay while workers 
dewatered the mine and reopened the shaft. 

Inactive for 20 years starting in 1916 the mine was again worked from July, 1936, until 1939 and 
during that time delivered 150,000 tons of ore valued at $900,000. Total estimated production of 
the American Girl Mine is 205,000 tons of ore valued at $1,285,000. Although mined primarily 
for gold, other minerals found at the American Girl include silver, galena and copper. Former 
state governor H. H. Markham owned shares in this mine. 

Other important mines in the vicinity of the American Girl include the Blossom (known as early 
as 1894) the American Boy (an extension of the American Girl), Desert King, and La Colorado. 
The Blossom, also known as the Salamanca Consolidated, had 3 shafts 70, 240 and 280 feet 
deep, and several hundred feet of workings. It was in operation in the late 1890's. The La 
Colorado Mine, discovered in 1914, consisted of 400 feet of underground workings and has a 
recorded production of several hundred tons of ore. Some traces of sheelite (tungsten ore) is 
found at this gold mine. 

CARGO MUCHACHO DISTRICT  

The Cargo Muchacho, Tumco, Pasadena and American Girl Mines comprise the major gold 
producers of the Cargo Muchacho District. This district is believed to be the northwestern 
extension of the famous gold belt of the Altar District of Sonora, Mexico. Although essentially a 
gold mining district some copper was produced as a byproduct of gold mining here, mainly at 
the American Girl Mine 16.  

Ore in this district contains free-milling gold or gold in disseminated pyrite. Gold alone and in 
association with silver and copper, and some sericite and kyanite are the only minerals 
extracted from the Cargo Muchachos, the latter two minerals have been produced mainly since 
1930.  All of the mineral deposits lie on the west side of the mountain range and strike westerly.  
The quartz veins are up to 8 feet thick in this region and contain the highest grade of gold ore 
found in Imperial County." 

6.2 Recent History (1980 - 2010) 
(From Mr. Robert Towner) 

 

In the early 1980's Newmont acquired the rights to the claims in the American Girl Canyon area 
and began an exploration program. The program discovered multiple small ore bodies that were 
both open pit and underground targets.  Eastmaque Gold Mines, Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada, 
formed the American Girl Mining Corporation and purchased the American Girl property from 
Newmont.  Mining activity began with the open pit, heap leach operation in the Padre-Madre 
west pit.  During 1987 and 1988 the first underground deposit was accessed via a decline with 
the use of a contractor. 

In 1989, Eastmaque Gold Mines, Ltd. joint ventured the property with Morrison Knudsen who 
became the operating partner in January of 1990.  In 1993 Morrison Knudsen's gold mining 
activities were formed into a publicly traded company known as MK Gold Company. 

In 1990, the mining rights in Tumco Canyon to the north of the American Girl Canyon were 
acquired.  A second joint venture was formed to mine the Oro Cruz surface and underground 
deposits. The Oro Cruz Joint Venture was merged into the American Girl Mining Joint Venture 
in 1994 concurrent with Hecla Mining Company acquiring Equinox Resource which was the 
successor to Eastmaque Gold. 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 32 

The development of the B-Zone mine began in February of 1990 and reached full production in 
July of 1991.  The mill was completed in May of 1990 and reached sustainable production in 
June of 1990.  Production had taken place in four distinct ore bodies: B-Zone, American Boy, 
Southwest Extension (American Girl vein) and C-Zone.  The C-Zone mine was developed from 
the abandoned C-Zone open pit starting in 1993 by MK Gold crews. The American Boy deposit 
was believed to have been exhausted in early 1995.  The development of the Oro Cruz mine 
was begun in early 1995 with production commencing during the second half of 1995.  The B-
Zone, Southwest Extension and the C-Zone deposits were exhausted in early 1996. 

Since the start up of underground mining in 1990, 800,000 tons of ore at 0.25 ounces gold per 
ton and 100,000 tons of waste has been mined producing 200,000 ounces of gold. 

After the Oro Cruz Mine closed in September, 1996, MK Gold completed rudimentary 
reclamation and the claims reverted back to Mr. Mike Tornabene. In 1999, Mr. Tornabene 
contracted Mine Development Associates (MDA) to complete an evaluation of the property (see 
Section 6.4). Paul Hartley, working as an associate of MDA, supervised the work. Mr. Hartley 
had been Exploration Manager for Texasgulf during the 1980's and supervised the Texasgulf 
work on Oro Cruz during that time period. He also reviewed the AGMJV work for Mr. Tornabene 
from 1993 through 1996.  

In 2002, Mr. Tornabene quit claimed all of the claims that were in good standing to Mr. Hartley. 
The intention was for Mr. Hartley to maintain the claims, and find a mining company who would 
be interested in developing the property. In exchange, any proceeds to Mr. Hartley from a future 
agreement would be shared with a charity selected by Mr. Tornabene.  

From 2001 through 2008, Mr. Hartley maintained the claims but reduced the holdings to 20 core 
claims. During this time, all pertinent information was organized into a digital database and re-
evaluated with the intention of finding an interested party to advance the property. In November 
of 2008, the 20 core claims were quit-claimed to ADGIS, Inc. This company is wholly owned by 
Mr. Hartley. A mining lease agreement was reached between Lincoln and ADGIS, Inc. in March, 
2010. 

6.3 Past Exploration and Development 

Texasgulf Minerals conducted exploration during the late 1980's, which included district-wide 
geologic mapping, airborne and ground magnetic, surface sampling and the drilling.  The 
previous owner of the property and the American Girl Mining Joint Venture also conducted 
exploration programs.  There are over 400 drillholes in the Oro Cruz Property.  Since 1981, 
there was 196,324 ft of drilling of which 6,818 ft was core drilling.  A total of 79,805 ft have been 
drilled outside of the main resource area.  

Ten exploration targets have been identified on the property and good potential exists for 
extension of known gold mineralization and discovery of new gold zones.  Pan concentrates and 
gravel samples suggest potential for placer deposits.  Magnetic anomalies are thought to be 
associated with elevated magnetite in the siliceous, gold-bearing zones.  FIGURE 6-1 is a 
drillhole location map of the known, existing drillholes on the property. 

Between 1943 and 1981 the project area was withdrawn from mining and exploration activity by 
an act of the US government.  There was no significant exploration work on the property during 
this time period. 

In January, 1981 the area was reopened by the Federal government and a land rush by several 
competing groups occurred.  One of the competing groups was led by Mr. Mike Tornabene.  He 
consolidated the land position between 1981 and 1985 and during that time period his group 
collected:

In 1986, Texasgulf Minerals and Metals acquired a lease from Mr. Tornabene and over the next 
4 years spent approximately $785,000 in mapping, sampling, permitting, and drilling the 
property.  The project geologist was Mr. Karl Kanbergs and Mr. Paul Hartley was the regional 
exploration manager.   

During this time period Texasgulf collected 107 rock chip samples.  In addition, 72 panned 
concentrate samples were collected of the gravels west of Tumco valley.  Texasgulf drilled a 
total of 76 RC exploration holes (23,584 ft) between 1985 and 1988.  Thirty-six of these holes 
were in the Cross area.  The early holes were primarily along existing access, but once a plan of 
operations was approved new access roads were constructed to explore the down rake 
projection of the Cross zone. 

In addition, Mr. Kanbergs completed a geological map of the property.  The compiled scale is 1" 
to 500'. The only geophysical surveying by Texasgulf was a ground magnetic survey of Tumco 
Valley. 

In 1989, the assets of Texasgulf Minerals & Metals were sold to Nerco Minerals and the Oro 
Cruz property reverted back to Mr. Tornabene.

In the early 1990's the property was leased by the American Girl Mining Joint Venture.  The 
exploration work during their tenure included collecting 239 soil samples, 63 samples of the pre-
1943 tailings, and 511 rock chip samples.  They drilled 422 holes of which 235 (102,360 ft) were 
development drill holes in the vicinity of the Cross and Queen areas.  Thirteen of the 422 holes 
were core holes, and all the others were reverse circulation.  All of the core holes were in the 
development drilling area.  Total footage cored was 6818 feet.  Total RC footage was 165,922. 

6.4 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 

Prior to NI 43-101 requirements, historical non-compliant NI 43-101 mineral resource 
estimates were prepared and reported by Mine Development Associates of Reno, Nevada in 
1999.  Non-compliant resources were estimated at 3,365,000 tons grading 0.058 oz gold per ton 
containing 196,000 ounces gold in the "indicated" category using a 0.01 oz gold per ton cutoff 
grade.  In addition, 2,684,000 tons of "inferred" resources were estimated with no grade 
assignment.  Old mill tailings are present on the property that contain gold values that could be 
recovered on a leach pad.  The tailings are summarized in TABLE 6.2.  The Eastern Tails are 
between 3 and 8 feet thick ranging in grade from 0.029 to 0.111 opt Au.  The Western Tails are 
between 2 and 6 feet thick ranging in grade from 0.018 to 0.026 opt Au. 

Neither the QP nor Lincoln have done sufficient work to classify the historical 
estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and the QP and 
Lincoln are not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or 
mineral reserves as defined in Section 1.2 and 1.3 of NI43-101, hence the 
historical estimate should not be relied on. 

Tt is of the opinion that the historic estimates are generally reliable and indicative of the mineral 
resources present on the property.  To support this statement, Tt compared the cumulative 
historic indicated and inferred estimated tonnage at a 0.01 oz Au/t cutoff grade of 6,049,000 
tons with the Tt estimate in TABLE 17-15 of 7,860,000.  As can be seen, the quantities are quite 
similar.  Tt is unable to compare the average grades, as the historic inferred resources 
referenced above do not have a grade assigned.

6.5 Historic Production 

The Cargo Muchacho-Tumco district was discovered by the Spaniards and mined as early as 
1780-81.  The district is believed to have produced the first gold mine in California.  Americans 
began mining the district at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848.  Mining was firmly 
established in 1877 with completion of the Southern Pacific Railroad to Yuma.  Large-scale 
mining at Oro Cruz (Golden Cross) occurred during 1890-1916 and 1932-1941, producing 
greater than 150,000 ozs gold.  Gold-bearing tailings from these operations remain on the Oro 
Cruz property.  Texasgulf Minerals explored the property from 1985-1989 and conducted some 
column leach tests.  In the early 1990's, the property was leased by the American Girl Mining 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 38 

Joint Venture and was mined under the JV from 1995-1996 by MK Gold. MK Gold produced 
approximately 61,000 ozs gold from open-pit and underground operations.  FIGURE 6-3 
illustrates the extent of the MK Gold underground mine openings.  FIGURE 6-4 details the 
known underground working from the historic Golden Queen underground mine.  There has 
been no additional production from the site since its closure on 1996. 

6.6 Historic Reclamation 

Historic reclamation has generally consisted of removal of buildings and surface facilities, 
closure of the vent shaft and access portal (by means of metal grates), and "ripping" of the 
access roads to prohibit access of the property by automobiles and/or trucks.  Very little, if any, 
actual revegetation or modern reclamation has occurred.  In the case of the historic Tumco mill 
to the west, the historic tailings have washed out onto the gravel plain and no system has been 
used to limit the extent of the tailings flows and/or subsequent environmental damages.

7.0 GEOLOGY 

Information concerning the tectonic setting was obtained from Alles (2007).  The description of 
geologic units and structure has been summarized largely from J.T. Dillon's (1975) Ph.D 
dissertation on the Geology of the Chocolate and Cargo Muchacho Mountains, 
Southeasternmost California supplemented by information from P.C. Henshaw's (1940) thesis 
on the Geology and Mineral Deposits of the Cargo Muchacho Mountains, Imperial County, 
California.  Property geology was summarized from Texasgulf Minerals' geologist, Karl 
Kanbergs', geologic map (1986) of a portion of the Oro Cruz property. 

7.1 Regional Geology 

Tectonic Setting 

The Oro Cruz Property is located on the eastern margin of the northwest-trending Salton Trough 
which is a complex transition zone between the right-lateral motion of the San Andreas 
transform fault and the northwest spreading ridge segment of the East Pacific Rise.  The East 
Pacific Rise is the spreading center that separates the Pacific and North American plates.  The 
Trough extends southward through the Coachella and Imperial Valleys into the Gulf of California 
in Mexico. The Salton Trough is essentially a rift valley or graben which has subsided and filled 
with sediments.  The eastern "wall" of the Salton Trough is the San Andreas fault. Eastern 
terrain includes the Chocolate Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains (Oro Cruz 
location) and is inferred to have Precambrian and related basement rocks.  The western "wall" 
of the Salton Trough is comprised of the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults in the U.S. and the 
Laguna Salada and Sierra Juarez faults in Mexico.  Western terrain includes the Peninsular 
Ranges which are the inferred extension of the Southern California batholith and related 
basement rocks. The northwest-tending Imperial fault occurs between the east and west "walls" 
and runs down the axis of the Imperial Valley.  This fault is the loci of East Pacific Rise 
spreading centers.  (After Alles, 2007). 

Geology 

The regional geology of the Oro Cruz area is best described by two California Division of Mines 
and Geology maps, the San Diego-El Centro and Salton Sea map sheets.  FIGURE 7-1 is a 
compilation of these sheets.  The primary mountain ranges in the region are the Chocolate 
Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains (Oro Cruz location). 

The Chocolate Mountains dominate the region and form the axis of a west-northwest-trending 
antiform.  The range is comprised of Precambrian granitic and metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic 
metamorphic and plutonic units, early to mid-Tertiary volcanic and plutonic rocks, and Tertiary to 
Recent sedimentary units. The Precambrian rocks consist of amphibolite- to greenschist-grade 
gneiss and schist.  The Mesozoic terrain is a structurally complicated package of gneiss, schist, 
phyllite, and plutons.  Mesozoic thrust faults are folded.   Tertiary Quechan Volcanics and 
Quaternary alluvial deposits over the older rocks. 

The Cargo Muchacho Mountains form an isolated range surrounded on all sides by dissected 
pediment and a vast area of various alluvial deposits.  The range is comprised of remnants of 
Jurassic (?) gneiss and schist which have been intruded by two large Mesozoic granite and 
monzonite bodies.   The prevailing structural fabric through the range is west-northwest.  Low-
angle thrust faults (or listric faults) are present.   The Oro Cruz Property covers the northwestern 
portion of the range which contains well-foliated metasedimentary gneiss and schist.  These 
rocks are metamorphosed to amphibolite facies.

The Sand Hills or Algodones Dunes occupy a well-defined, northwest trending zone west of the 
Oro Cruz Property.  In the U.S., the eolian deposits occupy a zone 40 miles long and up to 6 
miles wide, forming a conspicuous dune field. The San Andreas fault zone forms the western 
boundary of the dune field.  The dunes extend southward across the border into Mexico.     

Both the Chocolate Mountains and Cargo Muchacho Mountains have been affected by the right-
lateral slip movement on the San Andreas fault system (8-10 million years ago). FIGURE 7-2 
shows the regional tectonics, which demonstrate the extensive faulting and active plate 
boundary surrounding the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate.  This area transitions 
from the transform fault of the San Andreas into active divergent plate boundaries with multiple 
transform faults in between the spreading centers. 

7.2 Local Geology 

The local geology in the vicinity of Oro Cruz is best described by J. T. Dillon (1975) in his Ph.D. 
dissertation on the Geology of the Chocolate and Cargo Muchacho Mountains, 
Southeasternmost California.  Dillon's mapping was at a scale of 1:24,000 (1 inch = 2000 ft) and 
covered the entire Cargo Muchacho Mountains.  That portion of his mapping that covers the Oro 
Cruz property and adjacent areas is presented in FIGURE 7-3. 

The general geology can be described as a strongly foliated metasedimentary package of 
gneiss and schist which is intruded by strongly foliated quartz monzonite and biotite granite with 
associated pegmatite dikes and sills.  The gneiss and schist are altered to amphibolite facies.  
Lesser intrusive rocks are also present.  This geology is cut by older low-angle faults which are 
subsequently cut by northwesterly-trending, high-angle faults with right separation. 

7.2.1 Lithology 

In the vicinity of Oro Cruz property the principal rock units consists largely the Tumco 
Formation, biotite granite orthogneiss, hornblenede-biotite quartz monzonite orthogneiss, meta-
diorite and minor outcrops of Tertiary volcanics and various Quaternary alluvial units. 

Tumco Formation (Jurassic?) 

The Tumco Formation is the most important rock unit on the Oro Cruz Property because it is the 
host rock for all gold mineralization.  The rock unit consists of laminated, well-foliated 
quartzofeldspathic gneiss and hornblende schist with minor interbeds of quartzite, marble and 
amphibolite.  The formation origin is likely sedimentary with some volcanic contribution which 
have been metamorphosed to amphibolite facies.  The gneiss has a strong foliation and 
lineation defined by all minerals.  Amphibolite may occur as dikes or sills and is probably of 
volcanic origin.  Very conspicuous, light-colored pegmatite dikes cut the Tumco Formation 
throughout the local area.  Exposures of the Tumco Formation are excellent in the vicinity of the 
Oro Cruz Property.  Strong foliation strikes mostly to the west-northwest with dips to the south-
southwest. 

The "Vitrifax Formation," defined by Henshaw in 1942, is actually a leached facies of the Tumco 
Formation and was reassigned to the Tumco Formation by Dillon in 1975.

Biotite granite orthogneiss (Jurassic – 145 ma) 

This intrusive rock unit, along with its associated pegmatite and aplite dikes and sills, occurs as 
a large intrusive body encompassing about 15 square miles of the northern Cargo Muchacho 
Mountains.  This rock unit is well exposed and is found along the eastern margin of the Oro 
Cruz Property and occurs to the north.  The intrusive body cuts the Tumco Formation and the 
older hornblende-biotite quartz monzonite (173 ma).  The biotite granite has three facies, 1) 
Interior Facies – large K-feldspars, 2) North Marginal Facies – hundreds of pegmatite and aplitie 
sills intrude the Tumco Formation, and 3) South Marginal Facies – pink microcline in fine-
grained groundmass. 

Hornblende-biotite quartz monzonite orthogneiss (Jurassic – 173 ma) 

This intrusive rock unit occupies at least 16 square miles to the southeast of the Oro Cruz 
Property.  The coarse-grained intrusive body is cut by the pegmatite and aplite dikes of the 
younger biotite orthogneiss (145 ma).  The quartz monzonite has three facies, 1) Slightly 
Blastoporphyritic, 2) Coarsely Blastoporphyritic, and 3) Migmatite.  This rock unit is not an 
important unit in the vicinity of the Oro Cruz Property. 

Metadiorite (age ?) 

This rock unit has limited exposure in the vicinity of the Oro Cruz Property.  The fine-grained 
metadiorite typically crops out within or near greenschist. 

7.2.2 Structure 

According to Dillon (1975), the oldest Cenozoic faults of the Cargo Muchacho Mountains consist 
of the low-angle Pasadena Mountain and American Girl faults, and the north-trending high-angle 
Jackson Gulch fault zone.  Undescribed low-angle faults on the Oro Cruz Property are probably 
also in this category of older faults.  The low-angle and high-angle faults are cut by the 
northwesterly-trending, steeply-dipping Padre-Madre-Araz, Hedges, Colorado, and Round Top 
faults which have predominantly right-lateral slips or separations of up to 0.5 mile.  The Hedges 
fault bisects the Oro Cruz Property and appears to displace or offset gold mineralization in 
older, low-angle faults.  The northwest-trending, right-lateral San Andreas fault system, 
approximately 6 to 12 miles west of the Oro Cruz Property, was active by late Miocene time and 
it seems likely that the northwest-trending faults in the Cargo Muchacho Mountains are part of 
the San Andreas fault system.  

7.3 Property Geology 

Bedrock exposures on the Oro Cruz Property are excellent.  In 1986, approximately 50% of the 
Property was mapped at a scale of 1 inch = 100 ft and compiled at 1 inch = 500 ft by Karl 
Kanbergs, Texasgulf project geologist.  Texasgulf mapping was biased towards a siliceous, 
stratabound exhalite target model whereby the exhalites are metamorphosed and faulted.  
Other geologists believe that the gold deposits are structurally controlled.  Kanbergs' geologic 
compilation map is the most detail map available on the property and is presented in FIGURE 7-
4.  His map is essentially a geologic map of rock units without formational designation.  The 
map lacks faults and foliation attitudes which are clearly shown by Dillon (1975; see Local 
Geology).  All of the metamorphic (metasedimentary) units mapped by Kanbergs belong to the 
Tumco Formation (Jurassic ?).  Numerous, light-colored pegmatite dikes conspicuously cut the 
metamorphic package of gneiss and schist. The Tumco strata largely dip south-southeastward 
as a homocline on the Oro Cruz Property. 

During mine production by MK Gold (American Girl Joint Venture), no geologic mapping was 
conducted in the Queen pit, Oro Cruz pit, and Oro Cruz underground workings.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 

The Oro Cruz Property is located within the Mojave-Sonora mineral trend (FIGURE 8-1).  Gold 
mineralization at Oro Cruz is presently believed to be detachment-fault-related mineralization 
which was proposed as a distinct deposit type in the mid to late 1980's by various workers in 
southern California, western Arizona, and southernmost Nevada.   In later years, detachment-
fault-related gold mineralization was also recognized at various gold deposits south of Oro Cruz 
in northern Sonora State, Mexico.  Detachment deposits have characteristic mineral 
assemblages, alteration patterns, ore fluid types, and structural controls that differ considerably 
from other deposit types found in the western United States.  Examples near Oro Cruz include 
the nearby American Girl, Madre-Padre and Picacho mines and also the Copperstone mine in 
Arizona.  Examples in Mexico are La Choya, Quitovac, Noche Buena, and La Herradura. 

Detachment faults are low-angle normal faults (listric faults) of regional extent that have 
accommodated significant regional extension by upward movement of the footwall.  The 
detachment fault and structurally higher normal faults may host massive replacements, 
stockworks, and veins.  Mineralization at Oro Cruz appears to be mostly massive, mesothermal 
replacement.  Detachment deposits typically contain iron (hematite/magnetite), copper oxides 
(chrysocola) and gold.  These deposits are generally lacking the toxic element signature (As, 
Sb, Hg) of epithermal deposits.  Chloritic, potassium, and oxide alteration are related to 
detachment fault deposits. 

Texasgulf, a previous worker at Oro Cruz, believed that gold mineralization occurred in 
exhalites, perhaps because the Oro Cruz deposit and its satellites are mostly concordant with 
the well foliated schist and gneiss of the Tumco Formation (Jurassic?).  Geologic mapping by 
Texasgulf proceeded on the property with an interpretive bias towards exhalites.  However, 
historic underground mining reported that the mineralization is related to low-angle (± 25°) 
hanging wall or footwall faults, but never both.  Modern open-pit mining at the nearby American 
Girl mine, 2 miles to the southeast of the Oro Cruz deposit, was conducted along a low-angle (± 
25°) fault in Jurassic biotite granite.  The ores of Oro Cruz and American Girl and very similar 
gold ores with associated magnetite and copper oxides and both are presently interpreted by 
Lincoln Mining as occurring in detachment faults.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

Ore-grade gold mineralization from the Oro Cruz deposit and its various satellites is hosted and 
concordant within the Jurassic (?) Tumco Formation (gneiss and schist).  The massive brown- 
to gray-colored replacement mineralization contains 5 to 8% coarse-grained quartz and minor to 
moderate amounts of iron oxide consisting of well-crystallized magnetite and hematite.  
Noticeable amounts of hematite and magnetite have been oxidized to earthy hydrous iron 
oxides of limonite and goethite.  Major gangue minerals consist of quartz, mica, and feldspar.  
The siliceous gangue may contain trace amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite.  Also, traces of 
pyrrhotite occur as inclusions in magnetite.  Substantial amounts of the micas have been 
bleached and/or are intensively affected by hematitization.  Minor amounts of chlorite and 
specular hematite are also present.  Approximately 4 to 7% carbonate minerals are present.  
The "ore" is said to be "clean" with no significant arsenic, antimony, mercury or other toxic 
elements.  Sulfides are largely absent.  Mineralization is essentially inert. 

The brown mineralized zones are conspicuously cut by abundant, irregular-shaped, light-
colored pegmatite or aplite dikes that are barren of mineralization.  An excellent photograph of 
the mineralization as exposed in the eastern Oro Cruz pit wall is presented in Photo 9-1. 

 

Gold is primarily associated with iron oxides (magnetite, hematite, limonite, goethite).  
Examination of various drill logs reveals that significant gold mineralization is associated with 
the presence of 0.5 to 2+% magnetite and/or 0.5 to 5+% limonite.  Minor amounts of gold are 
found as inclusions in silica gangue and carbonates.  Gold occurs as native gold which contains

very low silver (<5%) and iron.  Particle size analysis show that the gold is most very fine with 
64% at <1 to 5 microns, 8% > 5 to 10 microns, and 28% >10 microns in diameter with a few 
coarse particles up to 50 microns. 

9.1.1 Oro Cruz Deposit 

The main mineralized body is the Oro Cruz deposit (aka "Cross", "Golden Cross") which is 
defined by drilling on 70 to 100 ft centers.  Using a cutoff grade of 0.01 opt gold, the following 
paragraphs describe the physical distribution of mineralization. 

"The Oro Cruz deposit is a long, mineralized body with a somewhat rectangular 
expression in plan view and a tabular form in long section.  Various "stringer" zones 
occur above and below the principal deposit.  In plan view, the deposit's widest 
dimension is 1,200 ft and its average width is approximately 580 ft.  The edges of the 
deposit are somewhat "ragged" owing to the lack drillhole information.  In long section 
the deposit is comprised of coalescing, stacked, irregular lenses that collectively dip 25° 
with a general azimuth of 120° (southeast), as shown in FIGURE 9-1.  In cross section 
the deposit is approximately the same width throughout with the irregular lenses defining 
the downward dip.  This mineralization forms a tabular envelope (all grades) that is 350 
to 370 ft in true thickness with a known down-dip length of approximately 2,800 ft, 
including a portion mined out by the existing pit. 

The main mineralized body is comprised largely of material grading from 0.01 to 0.05 opt 
Au with abundant internal lenses >0.05 opt Au and up to >1.0 opt Au.  Lenses grading 
>0.1 opt Au are common.   Larger mineralized lenses range from 5 to 25+ ft in true 
thickness and may reach up to 50 ft in true thickness with down-dip lengths ranging from 
145 to 330 ft.  Similar, smaller internal lenses range from 5 to 10 ft in true thickness and 
extend down-dip for 50 to 60 ft within lower grade material.  Distribution of higher grade 
gold lenses appears to form a persistent core within an envelope or halo of lower grade 
material.  Overall, the continuity of mineralization appears good to excellent." 

Owing to insufficient copper assay data, no copper zoning or copper-gold correlation can be 
made at this time. 

9.1.2 Satellite Deposits 

A least six satellite zones of mineralization are present on the Oro Cruz property to include the 
Queen.  The structural relationship between these various satellite zones remains uncertain at 
this time.  The Queen deposit shares similar characteristics with the nearby Oro Cruz deposit.  
The Queen was mined by open methods in the 1980s and backfilled; low-grade gold 
mineralization remains in the buried pit floor. 

No information concerning mineralization is available from the historic workings on the western 
portion of the Oro Cruz property.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

While a significant amount of exploration and operational data exist for the Oro Cruz gold 
project and the nearby American Girl Mine, none of these data meet the requirements for 
development of a CIM compliant resource estimate in the indicated or measured category.  
Because of this, Tt was unable to completely, independently verify the original geologic logs, 
assay certificates, bulk density measurements, topography, etc.  Tt has independently checked 
the data available for internal consistency and has found it to be good quality and indicative of 
the databases generated at the time the original data was collected.  In order to advance the 
project, Lincoln will need to complete the following programs in order to validate the existing 
database. 

 Develop and implement a geologic logging protocol for the planned exploration 

 Develop and implement an assay QA/QC protocol for sample collection, sample 
preparation, sample security, and development of internal checking programs 

 Develop a systematic program for collection and analyses of bulk density data 

 Have the topographic map verified by re-flying the area at a two-foot contour interval 

 Resurvey the open underground workings to validate the maps provided by the previous 
contractor

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

Several properties (FIGURE 15-1) have been mined within a mineralized belt running between 
the Chocolate Mountains to the north and the southern slopes of the Cargo Muchacho 
Mountains to the south. The belt extends from the Mesquite Mine, currently operating by New 
Gold, to about 20 miles to the southeast.  Properties that have been mined include the Picacho 
Mine, American Girl and Boy Mine, Oro Cruz Mine, Tumco Mine, Pasadena, and Padre and 
Madre Mine.  

On a larger scale, the mineralized belt is thought to continue south into northern Mexico. 
Newmont is a joint venture partner with Penoles on La Herradura Mine located 250 miles 
southeast of Mesquite in Northern Mexico.  Information regarding mineralization at adjacent 
properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization at Oro Cruz Gold Project. 

At present, there are no significant properties adjacent to the Oro Cruz Property.  Within a 3 to 4 
mile radius, there are 10 active lode claims, 16 active association placer claims, and 21 
patented lode claims (private property).  TABLE 15-1 lists these claims and their owners.  Most 
of the owners are individuals or groups of individuals from California.  One junior mining 
company, USA Uranium Corp (OTC:USAU pinksheets), a Nevada corporation, controls a group 
of patented lode claims covering the "Pasadena/Occidental Mine" on Pasadena Mountain, 
approximately 2 miles to the southeast of the Oro Cruz Property claim block. 

The nearest operating gold mine to the Oro Cruz Property is the Mesquite (New Gold Inc.) 
open-pit gold mine located approximately 14 miles to the northwest of Oro Cruz.  Production in 
2009 was 143,509 ozs gold.  Expected production in 2010 is between 145,000 to 155,000 ozs 
gold.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESING  

As of the date of this report, Lincoln Mining Corporation has not collected any metallurgical 
samples and/or completed any metallurgical testwork.  However, there is a history of both 
testing and production from the site and certain inferences can be reasonably made with 
respect to expected process and metallurgical performance. 

The Oro Cruz property has an intermittent history of producing gold from as early as 1890 
through about 1996 when the most recent operation ceased due to the prevailing low gold price.  
Prior owners-operators conducted significant metallurgical process studies on selected drill core 
samples and on a bulk/surface sample from the deposit, including a mineralogical 
characterization of that surface whole ore and a column (heap) leach residue.  These studies 
resulted in consistent and understandable metallurgical response data relatable to head grade, 
mineralogy, and the beneficiation/extraction process employed. 

The current owners are relying on historical report documents primarily developed in the early 
1990's as a basis for their proposed process, i.e., they (Lincoln) have not conducted their own 
metallurgy studies.  Reports and report summaries from this historical period were provided to 
Tt for review and to provide a process basis for the current owners to use in their economic 
evaluation.  The provided documents were originally produced by companies and professional 
employees generally known to Tt and are considered to be reputable, independent, third-party 
references.   

The referenced reports and documents show a site history of gold recovery in production and/or 
by test studies using gravity concentration, amalgamation, flotation, and cyanide leaching in 
both bottle roll and column (heap leach) systems.  Virtually all of the testwork showed that gold 
was recoverable by all of the various processes.  Furthermore, finer grinding tended to 
increased gold recovery as the result of better liberation.   

Testwork conducted by Kappes, Cassidy & Associates for American Girl Mining and reported in 
the referenced documents (1990-1991), focused on heap leach processing.  Column cyanide 
leach tests were conducted on two samples; a bulk surface sample grading 0.083 oz Au per 
Ton reportedly taken from the western portion of the Oro Cruz zone, and a mineralized drill core 
interval covering 85 feet (reportedly through the entire ore zone) and grading 0.039 oz Au per 
Ton.  Portions of both samples were crushed to pass 3/4 –inch (coarse crush) and 3/8 –inch 
(fine crush) and subjected to standard column leach tests.  Complete data are presented in the 
referenced report documents and summarized here. 

The surface sample produced 55.6% and 64.8% Au recovery after 64 days of leaching for the 
coarse and fine crushed material, respectively.  The underground (core) sample produced 
67.6% and 75.0% Au recovery after 60 days of leaching for the coarse and fine crushed 
material, respectively.  Concurrent mineralogical examination of both whole ore and column 
leach residue material concluded that with fine enough grinding (more liberation) virtually all the 
contained gold is recoverable at some cost.  Consideration of a grind/agglomeration heap leach 
should increase gold recovery at some increase in reagent consumption, hence increased 
operating cost.  It can generally be concluded that the Oro Cruz ore is amenable to low cost 
heap leach processing.  Such processing is practiced commercially at many locations and is 
considered low risk. 

Further testing is recommended on samples that represent a mine plan as well as different (and 
extreme) ore rock types within the deposit.  Eventually, trade off studies are warranted to 
explore the cost of finer comminution (crushing and grinding) for liberation to produce higher 
gold recovery and the resultant more complicated and costly processing scenarios.

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

The Oro Cruz Project located in the southeastern California, near the town of Yuma, Arizona 
has several significant gold deposits.  Tt has produced an independent evaluation of the 
contained inferred gold resources within several deposits.  All of the work completed is 
according to current CIM guidelines and requirements; however, the resource cannot be 
classified as measured and indicated because of the lack of verifiable quality controls, 
assurance, and sample security procedures.  It is near several significant gold deposits, 
including the Mesquite deposit (New Gold).  Before the 1995 joint venture of American Girl 
Mining in 1995, the Oro Cruz property has produced possibly as much as 150,000 ounces of 
gold, primarily from the historic workings.  After 1995, the joint venture produced nearly 61,000 
ounces from Oro Cruz and the Golden Queen until it ended mining operations.   

FIGURE 17-1 shows the resource model area, with eight "wireframe" zones.  The wireframes 
represent inclusionary volumes in which gold resources have been estimated.  These zones are 
described in greater detail within this chapter. 

The mineral resource estimate has been generated from drillhole, trench and blasthole assay, 
along with an interpretation of a geologic model which relates to the spatial distribution of gold in 
eight Oro Cruz deposits.  The locations of the deposits are shown in FIGURE 17-1.  
Interpolation characteristics have been defined based on the geology, drill hole spacing and 
geostatistical analysis of the data.  The mineral resources have been classified by a 
combination of their proximity to the sample locations and kriging error and are reported, as 
required by NI 43-101, according to CIM standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves.  This 
chapter presents: 

 Tetra Tech coded drillhole assays and 5 foot composites inside and outside of three-
dimensional wireframes received from the project exploration geologist.  

 Statistics for surface samples, drillhole assay and composite data were generated 

 Log, Indicator and relative variograms where generated using composite data.  Model 
validation (jackknifing) was used to determine the geostatistical ranges, direction and 
search parameters in estimating grade values. 

 Ordinary kriging was used to estimate gold grades in 10x10x5 foot blocks. 

 The kriged grade values were visually inspected in section and plan and compared to 
the composite data. 

 A resource classification of inferred was developed and assigned based on a 
combination of jackknifing and kriging error analyses. 

 Validation of the kriged model was performed using statistics and visual inspection. 

Grade-tonnage tables and graphs were developed from the block model at various cutoff grades 
and resource classification code.

Three exclusion wireframes are shown in FIGURE 17-2.  These wireframes represent 3D 
volumes that have been mined.  The Queen pit with a code of 6010 has been backfilled with 
low-grade and waste material.  Zones 1001, 1010, 1011, 2001, 2010, and 2011 represent 
underground areas that were previously mined. 

FIGURE 17-3 shows the general location of drillhole, trench and blasthole sample locations.  
Some classes of samples such as the Queen blast holes (BH) and Cross underground channel 
samples (UG) have been mined.  Because these data represent real values that were part of 
the mineralizing event, information from these samples have been used to estimate the potential 
remaining resources; however, the volume of the areas historically mined have been removed 
and are not included in the resource estimate.   

17.1 Block Model 

TABLE 17-1 shows the block model parameters for the Oro Cruz resource.  The model block 
size has been chosen to respect the complex shapes of the wireframes.

TABLE 17-6 shows the statistics for the gold composites for Zone 1000, with a cap at 1.5 opt.  
Note that the distribution are plotted with log transformed grades.  Apparently the distribution 
becomes more lognormal with compositing.  The median gold grade for the composites inside 
the Zone 1000 wireframes is 0.01  This value has been used to generate indicator variograms 
for Zone 1000, as a powerful way to explore the spatial structure of gold.

17.3 Variography and Kriging Parameters 

Numerous log-variograms, relative and indicator variograms were generated and interpreted.   
These variograms were calculated in 14 directions such that all directions in three-dimensional 
space were explored. FIGURE 17-8 shows two directional indicator variograms that follow the 
deposit structures.  Panel A shows an omni log variogram and panel B is looks vertically.  The 
experimental variograms were modeled with two spherical structures and a nugget.  These 
ranges and variances are used as kriging parameters listed in TABLE 17-9.  Ordinary kriging 
was used to estimate blocks 10x10x5 feet in size.  The kriging was constrained to estimate 
blocks within the wireframes, with composites also within the wireframes. Due the scarcity of 
data and the similarity in distribution, data outside of the wireframes but within the search 
ranges (9000 codes) were also used in the estimation of Zones 3000 through 8000.

17.4 Classification of Resource Blocks 

FIGURE 17-9 shows Tt's normal two-pass protocol used to classify blocks for resource 
estimation.  Normally, they would have difference resource classes; however, since we are 
unable to assign measured and indicated designations to any of the estimated resources, all 
blocks have been classified as inferred.  The top portion of the FIGURE (panel A) shows the 
variogram being used to establish the first pass search ranges.  This panel shows the results of 
the jackknife studies at increasing search ranges.  Finally, the bottom part (part B) shows how 
kriging error break-points are used.  FIGURE 17-10 shows the enlarged version of 17-9a 0.77 
correlation. 

Pass 1: 

The first pass utilized jackknifing of composite values.  Jackknifing or model validation is a 
computer technique that removes samples one at a time and then predicts what its value is 
using samples that utilize the search and variogram parameters being investigated.  The 
estimate is then compared to the real value.  FIGURE 17-9a shows a plotted original composite 
Au values versus the estimated value based on estimates using a maximum 70 foot search.  
Note that if the estimate were perfect, then points would fall on the 45-degree line. This 70 foot 
search jackknife study produced a correlation between the target and the estimated gold values 
of 0.77.  The figure has a reference ellipse plotted which is wide enough to contain 
approximately 80% of the points falling adjacent to the 45-degree line. This jackknifing 
technique has been done for one shorter range of 20-ft and larger search range of data falling 
within 70 to 140 feet.   Note that the shorter range of 20 feet produces a correlation of 0.66. At a 
search distance from 70 to 140 feet the correlation is 0.17. TABLE 17-10 lists the results of the 
jackknife studies.

Pass 2: 

The second pass in the classification procedure uses kriging errors.  Kriging errors contain a 
measure of and estimate's reliability. FIGURE 17-9b shows the kriging error plotted as a log-
probability graph.  Note that for this study, the graph has a break in kriging error at 1.8.  This 
break point is interpreted as when kriging error shifts dramatically from a lower population of 
kriging errors (better estimates) to a higher population (worse estimates).  This higher 
population of errors indicated that regardless of the search parameters, estimations are 
particularly poor in quality.  TABLE 17-11 shows the histogram of the same concept.  Here the 
kriging errors greater than 1.8 are highlighted in blue.

17.5 Kriged Block Statistics 

TABLES 17-12 through 17-14 indicated the statistics for the kriged blocks.  The kriged block 
gold grades follow a single mode, lognormal-like distribution for zones 1000 and 2000.  Zone 
1000 has an average grade of 0.025 opt while zone 200 has an average kriged grade of 0.12.

A tonnage factor of 12.5 cubic feet per ton was used for all zones. 

17.7 Block Model Validation 

17.7.1 Validation Test 1: 

A validation test was done in determining if the estimated results appear correct statistically 
through the sequence of assays, composites and kriged blocks. The statistical distribution of 
composites should be statistically similar to assay values.  Also blocks should follow a similar 
distribution as composites. FIGURE 17-11 shows the log-probability plots for samples, 
composites and blocks.  The figure shows the three log-probability plots overlaid.  The differing 
slopes of the probability plots indicates there is the expected successive lowering of variance of 
the distributions as one proceeds from samples to blocks.  This successful overlaying of the

plotted distributions indicate that the sequence of samples to composites to blocks appear 
statistically valid. 

17.7.2 Validation Test 2:  

Sections with blocks, composites and drillhole data were created and visually inspected as a 
means of verifying the estimation results for conformity with the expected geologic controls and 
estimation parameters.  

The model passed this qualitative test successfully.  FIGURE 17-12 shows gold grades along 
an East-West - Section 22.  FIGURE 17-13 shows the same information in long section through 
the Oro Cruz deposit. 

17.8 Estimated Resources 

The following resource tables present the results of the resource estimation study by deposit 
(i.e. Zone Code) as illustrated in FIGURE 17-1, by cutoff grade and by resource class.  All of the 
work completed is according to current CIM guidelines and requirements; however, the resource 
is only classified as an inferred resource because of the lack of verifiable quality controls, 
assurance, and sample security procedures.  TABLE 17-15 details the inferred resources for 
Oro Cruz Gold Project.  A base case cutoff grade of 0.02 oz Au/t has been selected for reporting 
purposes and is highlighted in the tables. 

FIGURE 17-14 shows the grade-tonnage relationship of the estimated inferred resources. 

17.9 Mineral Reserves 

As of the date of this report, the Oro Cruz Gold Project does not have any CIM definable mineral 
reserves.

18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

The authors are not aware of any other data or additional information that would be relevant to 
this report, the omission of which would make this Technical Report not understandable or 
misleading. 

18.1 Underground Workings 

In March 2010, Lincoln contracted Atkinson Construction to report the conditions of the 
underground workings at Oro Cruz.  They found that the general ground conditions were similar 
to conditions in 1996 when operations were halted.  The portal is in excellent condition (Photo 
18-1). 

 

Some areas had minor rockfalls, but were otherwise in good condition.  Most electrical lines are 
missing, having been removed by vandals.  All services, such as the steel liner, ladderway, 
utilities, and bolted and wired bottom of the raise, appear to be in good condition with minor rust 
(Photo 18-2).  Ventilation and air quality is sufficient to reach the bottom of the decline.  All 
chutes, cylinders, airlines, and operating valves are left in place.  At the bottom of the main

decline, water is present with an estimated 200 to 250 linear feet of decline under water.  In 
general, the mine is in good condition.  The mine could be made workable with only a few 
additions and maintenance.  

 

18.2 Surface Conditions 

The current surface conditions are generally good.  The pit ramp is ripped like the old American 
Girl haul road.  The pit bottom is dry.  The benches need maintenance.  The pit is approximately 
1,300 feet long, 500 feet wide, and 100 to >250 feet deep.  The push back is approximately 
1,000 feet long, 500 feet wide, and 100 to >250 feet deep. Photo 18-3 shows the conditions of 
the pit and benches.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  

19.1 Interpretation 

It is Tt's opinion that most of the past work and all of the current Lincoln work meets and/or 
exceeds the current standards and those areas that do not meet current standards have been 
identified within the body of this report.  The work has been completed by well-qualified 
technical professionals, reputable mining companies, and independent third-party contractors 
and laboratories according to standards that meet most of today's requirements.   

19.2 Conclusions 

It is Tt's opinion that the Oro Cruz Gold Project warrants additional study and evaluation.  There 
are sufficient historic data to have produced an inferred resource estimate  that is of sufficient 
tenor that a "prudent man" would continue to invest in the exploration and development of the 
project.  The next step in Lincoln's work plan involves the completion of twin-hole confirmation 
drilling in order to produce a compliant measured and indicated resource estimate in the areas 
of known mineralization and complete additional exploration drilling looking at increasing the 
known resource base of the project.

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

To continue evaluation of the Oro Cruz Gold Project, Tt recommends that Lincoln undertake 
several additional investigations. These investigations will be required to allow the project to 
proceed toward economic-level evaluation.   

20.1 Recommended Additional Investigations 

Near-term additional studies are anticipated in three key areas of investigation and are as 
follows: 

Geology and Resources:  additional drilling will be needed for 

 Confirmation of the geology, mineralogy, and ore types 

 Twin hole drilling program aimed at bringing the inferred resource into the indicated and 
measured categories 

 Development of geotechnical parameters for pit slopes 

 Update of three-dimensional geologic model to allow estimation of gold recoveries by 
block, continued confirmation of assays from previous drilling, and reclassification of 
resources 

Metallurgical Testwork:  Tt recommends additional tests be conducted to assess: 

 Collection of additional metallurgical samples for testing 

 Evaluate "best practices" processing methodologies 

 Mineralogical studies 

Environmental Permitting-related Studies:  Several environmental permits will be required for 
development of the project.  To advance the project towards permitting, it is recommended that 
baseline environmental studies are initiated as soon as possible since long-term (seasonal-
based) data collection may be required.  Studies will include: 

 Land use 

 Air quality 

 Geologic resources and rock characterization (e.g. potential for ARD generation) 

 Paleontologic resources 

 Surface water and groundwater resources 

 Soils 

 Vegetation 

 Wildlife and fisheries, including special status species 

 Range resources 

 Recreation 

 Auditory resources 

 Visual resources 

 Cultural resources 

 Native American cultural values 



Oro Cruz Gold Project  Lincoln Mining Corp. & Elgin Mining Inc. 

Tetra Tech April 2011 100 

 Hazardous materials 

 Socio-economics 

 Environmental justice 

20.2 Work Plan 

Lincoln's future plans include twin hole drilling, reducing drillhole spacing, bulk density testing, 
preliminary metallurgical testwork, location of a suitable water source and baseline 
environmental studies, continued surface geologic mapping, and securing adequate supplies of 
water and power.  Because the Oro Cruz (Cross) and the Queen deposits contain the majority 
(+90 percent) of the known gold mineralization, only these deposits will be concentrated on for 
the initial compliance programs.  The remaining deposits represent potential additions to the 
Oro Cruz (Cross) and Queen deposits and will likely be subject to additional exploration in the 
future.  These items are required for the project to proceed toward feasibility. 

Large diameter drilling may be necessary to obtain adequate metallurgical sample material from 
the non-outcropping mineralization.  Determination of this requirement will be part of the 2011 
continued evaluation program. 

TABLE 20-1 details the anticipated work plan and major categories of expenditure.

25.0 APPENDIX A - ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING 

A multi-agency regulatory process will be completed to obtain all required federal, state and 
local agency permits and approvals necessary to construct, operate and ultimately close the 
Oro Cruz mine and ore processing operations (operations)  The following sections describe the 
key permits and approvals that would be required for the proposed mine operations.  

25.1 Federal Mine Permitting  

The mine site is located in the extreme southeast corner of Imperial County, California, on 
federal public lands administered by the  El Centro Field Office of the U. S. Department of the 
Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The mining and extraction of precious metals on 
federal lands open to mineral development is governed by the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 
§§ 22-42).  Due to the location of the mine site on federal public lands, the BLM is expected to 
be the lead agency for the regulatory process, ensuring all required federal, state and local 
permits and approvals are obtained.  The BLM would issue federal approval for the operations 
in accordance with their Surface Management Regulations contained in Title 43 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations, Part 3809 (43 CFR 3809). These regulations implement the Mining Law of 
1872, and regulate hard rock mining on federal public lands open to mineral development.   The 
BLM will require the submittal of a mine Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan, prepared in 
accordance with 43 CFR 3809, that details the proposed mine operations, along with 
reclamation and closure activities.  The BLM will also require the placement of a financial 
guarantee (reclamation bond) to ensure reclamation is completed in accordance with the 
approved plan.   

Note that the completion of the federal mining permitting program, including preparation of the 
Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan would be coordinated with the Imperial County 
Planning and Development Services Department (PDSD).  This will ensure the plan meets the 
BLM, County and the State of California mine permitting requirements as described in Section 
4.3.2.  

25.2 County  Permitting 

Various departments in Imperial County will issue permits, approvals or otherwise regulate 
various mine operations and activities. The following list identifies key County Departments and 
the permits, approvals or regulatory issues they are responsible for.  

25.3 Planning and Development Services Department  

The Planning and Development Services Department (PDSD) will be the co-lead agency for the 
overall mine permitting and approval process. They issue a Special Use Permit for the mine and 
ore processing operations in accordance with the Imperial County Code of Ordinances, Title 9, 
Land Use Code, Division 20, Surface Mining and Reclamation.  Division 20 ensures the 
operations are regulated in accordance with various State of California laws and regulations 
affecting mining and ore processing operations including the following :  

 The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) (California Public Resources 
Code, Division 2, Chapter 9, Section 2710 et seq).  SMARA is the primary law that 
governs the exploration, surface mining, processing of minerals, and reclamation of 
surface mine sites in California.  It requires the filing of a plan of operations and 
reclamation plan that details proposed mine operations and reclamation activities; and 
also requires the placement of a financial assurance that will ensure reclamation is 
completed in accordance with the approved plan of operations and reclamation plan.   



 

 

 Annual Reporting Requirements and Reporting Fee for mining and ore processing 
operations, as set forth in California PRC Section 2207. 

 State Mining and Geology Board Regulations for Surface Mining and Reclamation 
Practices, as set forth in the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 14, Division 2, 
Chapter 8, Subchapter 1, Sections 3500 et seq.  These regulations are implemented to 
ensure: 

Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized and that mined lands 
are reclaimed to a useable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative 
land uses.  

The production and conservation of minerals are encouraged, while giving 
consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and 
forage, and aesthetic enjoyment.  

Residual hazards to the public health and safety are eliminated.   

25.3.1 Open Pit Backfilling Requirement 

Article 9, Part 3704.1(a) of the State Mining and Geology Board Regulations presents the 
performance standards for the backfilling of excavations and the recontouring of land disturbed 
by open pit surface mining operations for metallic minerals.  This regulation requires that open 
pits created by surface mining activities for the production of metallic minerals shall be backfilled 
to the original surface elevation.  However, Article 9, Part 3704.1(h) and (i) also identifies 
several circumstances under which only partial backfilling, or no backfilling, would be required.  
These include the following:  

 Partial backfilling may be requested if the volume of backfill material available is not 
adequate to provide for complete backfilling of the open pit.   

 The backfilling regulation does not apply if final approval of a reclamation plan and 
financial assurance was issued prior to December 18, 2002.   

Lincoln Gold could request an exemption from the full backfill requirement based on the fact that 
a recommencement of mine operations would only provide enough material for a partial backfill 
program; and that rehandling of material from existing waste rock dumps to supplement 
backfilling would be cost prohibitive.  Lincoln Gold could also point out that the original mine 
plan of operations and reclamation plan was approved prior to December 18, 2002.  This plan 
did not include pit backfilling.   

As discussed in Section 4.3.1, the County and State mine permitting program would be 
coordinated with the federal permitting program managed by the BLM to ensure all regulatory 
requirements are achieved.   

25.3.2 Water Well Drilling  

The Planning and Development Services Department would also issue a permit for the drilling 
and operation of water wells.  It is anticipated this activity would be coordinated with the 
California State Water Resources Control Board (WRCB), Division of Water Rights which 
regulates all activities related to water rights, from the initial filing of applications to appropriate 
groundwater, to the issuance of the water rights permit or license.   



 

 

25.4 Air Pollution Control District  

The project is located in the California Salton Sea Air Basin.  Air pollution in California is 
addressed at the local level by county air pollution control districts. Each district establishes and 
enforces air pollution regulations in order to attain and maintain all state and federal ambient air 
quality standards. The Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) will regulate and 
issue appropriate permits for the mine project in accordance with applicable State of California 
and Federal Clean Air Act requirements.  The APCD coordinates with the State of California Air 
Resources Board as needed to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal air quality 
requirements .   

25.5 Public Works Department 

The Public Works Department will review and approve building and facility plan checks.   

25.6 Public Health Department:  

The Environmental Health & Consumer Protection Services Branch of the Public Health Department 
will permit and regulate the operation of a public water system; a sewage disposal system; and 
a solid waste landfill at the mine site.  The solid waste landfill would be regulated by the 
County's Solid Waste Local Enforcement Agency (LEA), which is part of the Public Health 
Department.  In accordance with California PRC the LEA is certified by the California Integrated 
Waste Management Board (CIWMB), to enforce federal and state laws and regulations for safe 
and proper handling of solid waste.  The CIWMB will concur on the issuance of the solid waste 
landfill permit before it is issued by the LEA.  

25.7 Other Key State and Federal Permits and Approvals 

This section presents a discussion on other key state and federal permits and approvals that 
could be required for the mine project.  Consultation with the BLM and the Imperial County PDS 
would determine a complete list of permits and approval required.  

Compliance with federal and state water resource regulations in California is managed by the 
WRCB, through the Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB).  The mine project area is 
located in the East Colorado River Planning Unit of the Colorado River Basin Hydrologic Region 
(Region 7). Federal and state water resource regulations within this region, including 
compliance with water quality and waste discharge issues,  are managed by the Colorado River 
RWQCB.   The Colorado River RWQCB will issue a Waste Discharge Permit for the project in 
accordance with the requirements of  Title 27, Division 2 of the California Code of Regulations 
(CCR).  This permit will also meet federal requirements, including those outlined by Section 401 
of the Clean Water Act (the National Pollution Discharge Elimination system [NPDES]).   

The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) serves as the Certified Unified 
Program Agency (CUPA) for the regulation of businesses that store or use hazardous materials 
in Imperial County.  The DTSC will issue the appropriate permits for mine and ore processing 
operations for the storage and use of hazardous materials, and the storage and disposal of 
hazardous wastes.         

Consultation with the California State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) would be completed 
to assess potential impacts to cultural resources protected under the National Historic 
Preservation Act.  The activity would be coordinated with the BLM under Section 106 of the 
National Historic Preservation Act.  The SHPO and the BLM would also coordinate the 
government to government consultation process with local Native American Tribes in regards to 



 

 

potential impacts to Native American Traditional Properties and Practices that could result from 
the implementation of the proposed project.   

The filing of water rights in California is regulated by the WRCB, Division of Water Rights 
(DWR).  The DWR regulates all activities related to water rights, from the initial filing of 
applications to appropriate groundwater via water wells, to the issuance of the water rights.  
Should Lincoln Gold opt to drill new water wells, and file for groundwater rights, this activity 
would be coordinated with the DWR.   

In regards to the drilling of new water wells, previous research of the DWR database indicates 
there are no licensed, permitted, registered, pending or claimed water rights within the general 
mine area for either surface or groundwater diversions. This research has also determined the 
general mine site area is adjacent to a groundwater accounting area (equivalent to 10,000-acre 
feet as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey), that falls under the jurisdiction of the Lower 
Colorado River Water Authority, a federal agency, for agriculture use in Imperial Valley.  
Information provided by Doctor Jay Chen, Ph.D. of the Authority indicates that some of the 
groundwater in the vicinity of the general mine site could come from leaks in the nearby, and 
downgradient All American Canal. However, groundwater water use in the agriculture 
accounting area is regulated for the Authority, by the City of Needles, as federal water manager. 
Information provided by Mr. David Brownley, Assistant City Manager for the City indicates that 
water well drilling for mining and ore processing is expressly allowed within the groundwater 
accounting area.  It is a simple permit process that would be coordinated with the City of 
Needles as part of the overall Imperial County water well permit program.  Should Lincoln Gold 
propose to drill new water wells in the mine site area, it is suggested that coordination with the 
City and the Authority be completed to determine if the new wells are located in, or would 
impact groundwater associated with the 10,000 acre-foot accounting area or groundwater from 
the All American Canal.   

The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) would review the proposed mine 
operations and would issue appropriate permits and approvals as necessary.  These include the 
following:  

 Streambed Alteration Permit, issued under Sections 1600 to 1616 of the State Fish and 
Game Code, for an activity that will substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow of any 
river, stream or lake; substantially change or use any material from the bed, channel, or 
bank of any river, stream, or lake; or deposit or dispose of debris, waste or other material 
containing crumbled, flaked or ground pavement where it may pass into any river, 
stream or lake.  The permit applies to any work undertaken near a river, stream or lake 
that flows at least intermittently through a bed or channel including ephemeral streams, 
desert washes and water courses with a subsurface flow.   

 Permit for an Incidental Take of State Listed Species under the California Endangered 
Species Act (CESA).  The CESA mandates that all native species of fishes, amphibians, 
reptiles, birds, mammals, invertebrates, and plants, and their associated habitats, which 
are threatened with extinction, or those experiencing a significant decline, which, if not 
halted, would lead to a threatened or endangered designation, will be protected.  
However, the CESA also allows for the "incidental take" of specific species.  The CDFG 
would review the proposed project and issue a permit for an incidental take, if approved 
under Sections 2080 and 2081(b)(c) of the State Fish and Game Code.    

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) would also review potential impacts to any federally 
listed threatened, endangered or candidate (TEC) plant of animal species via a Section 7 
Consultation under the Endangered Species Act.  This review would be coordinated with the 
CDFG's review of special status species.  It is expected that the federally listed species would 



 

 

also be listed state species.  TABLE 25-1 presents a list of special status plant and animal 
species for Imperial County, with their associated federal and state status.   Note that this table 
is a comprehensive list of species for Imperial County.  Coordination with the BLM, CDFG and 
the FWS would determine which species require assessment during the mine permitting 
program.

25.9 Environmental Documentation Process 

The proposed project constitutes both federal and state actions.  The federal action will be 
assessed for potential environmental impacts as required by the National Environmental Policy 



 

 

Act of 1969 (NEPA).  The project will also be assessed in accordance with the California 
Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), to ensure state regulatory requirements in regards 
to environmental assessment and protection are met.  NEPA and CEQA are not permit or 
approval actions.  They are assessment programs which analyze and disclose to the public the 
potential impacts to the environment that could result from the proposed action and or 
alternatives; assess the level of significance for each identified impact; and propose mitigation 
measures to reduce the potential impact from the selected proposed action to a less than 
significant level.   

The results of a NEPA or CEQA program are evaluated as part of the overall permitting and 
approval program; however, they in themselves are not permitting or approval actions.  
Approval for the selected, proposed action is granted in accordance with various federal and 
state laws and regulations.  For the Oro Cruz project, approval for the federal action would be 
granted under 43 CFR 3809, while approval for the state action would be granted under the 
Imperial County Special Use Permit that ensures compliance with the Imperial County Surface 
Mining and Reclamation Ordinances; SMARA; and the State Mining and Geology Board 
Regulations.  

Both NEPA and CEQA have various levels of assessment that can be implemented.  For the 
proposed Oro Cruz mine project, it is expected that the BLM and the Imperial County Planning 
and Development Services Department will require the completion of an Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS) and Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to adequately meet the requirements 
of NEPA and CEQA, respectively.  These are the most detailed assessments that can be 
completed.  It is possible that a lower level of assessment, including an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) for NEPA; and either an Initial Study and Negative Declaration or Initial Study 
and Mitigated Negative Declaration program for CEQA could be completed.  However, should 
the findings of a lower level assessment program be challenged and upheld in court, then the 
more stringent EIS and EIR programs would be completed.  For a mining and ore processing 
project, completion of fully defensible EIS and EIR programs that have been prepared in 
accordance with all applicable guidelines and procedures provides insurance that the findings 
will withstand an appeal process.  Note that for a project such as Oro Cruz, which has both a 
federal and county/state regulatory nexus, completion of a combined EIS/EIR program is 
perfectly acceptable.  Completion of the combined program would be coordinated with the BLM 
and the Imperial County Planning and Development Services Department.   

25.10 Baseline Study Programs.  

A NEPA and CEQA program assesses various environmental and natural resource topics and 
issues for impacts that would result from the implementation of the selected proposed action.  
The resources assessed during the NEPA and CEQA program would include, but are not limited 
to, the following: air quality; water quality; surface and groundwater hydrologic resources; soils; 
geology; cultural resources; Native American issues and concerns; hazardous and solid wastes; 
general vegetation and wildlife species and habitat; special status vegetation and wildlife 
species and habitats;  agriculture; noxious weeds and invasive, non-native plant species; land 
use authorizations; recreation; transportation; and various socio-economic issues including 
Environmental Justice considerations.  Consultation with the BLM and Imperial County would 
identify the resource topics and issues that would be assessed in the NEPA and CEQA 
program.   

To collect the various resource data, the project proponent normally implements a multi-
resource baseline study program.  The individual studies associated with the program are 
completed in accordance with applicable regulatory agency data adequacy standards (DASs) 
and protocols to ensure the collected data is defensible and will support the NEPA and CEQA 



 

 

program.  Depending on the scope of the proposed project, a two-year (season) baseline study 
program is usually considered adequate to collect the required resource data.  Most agencies 
allow the baseline study program to be implemented in a timely manner, to ensure the collected 
data is available for input into the NEPA/CEQA document as needed to streamline the overall 
project schedule.  Consultation with the BLM and Imperial County staff would determine the 
scope of the baseline study program.
