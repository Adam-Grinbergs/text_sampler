1 Summary 
This report was prepared as a NI 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment 

(Technical Report or PEA) for Fortune Minerals Limited (Fortune or the Company), by SRK 

Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) on the Revenue Mine (Revenue Mine or the Project). The purpose 

of this Technical Report is to update the resource estimate for the polymetallic Yellow Rose Vein 

(Yellow Rose) and the Virginius Vein (Virginius) with analytical data from new drilling and channel 

sampling completed by Star Mine Operations LLC (Star) and to complete PEA level mine design, 

production schedule, and economic evaluations. The PEA is preliminary in nature that it includes 

inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 

considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, 

and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. This Technical Report is intended for public 

disclosure provided any use of this report by any third party is at that party's sole risk.  

Fortune and Star have informed SRK that they have started mine production and mill 

commissioning and that infrastructure is in place for the Revenue Mine to be put back into 

production. SRK has not reviewed the infrastructure or mining aspects of the Project. SRK has 

reviewed historical test work that was performed for Ranchers in 1984 and results from test work 

completed in 2012 by Star. Review of this test work was considered indicative of recoveries using 

a flow sheet and equipment suitable for silver flotation. The historical recoveries and 2012 test 

work are the basis for recoveries used to report the resources estimate.  

1.1 Property Description 
The Project is located in southwestern Colorado about 5.5 miles southwest of the town of Ouray. 

The Revenue Portal, the site of the current surface activity, is located at longitude 107.750° W, 

latitude 37.974° N (mine grid coordinates of 100,630 ft E, 99,100 ft N). The majority of the 

historical underground work occurred approximately 1.2 miles to the southwest centered at 

approximately 107.773° W., latitude 37.967° N (mine grid coordinates of 97,790 ft E, 95,070 ft N). 

All of the mining claims are located in Township 43 North, Range 8 West, New Mexico Prime 

Meridian (NMPM), Ouray and San Miguel Counties, Colorado, and are held in the name of either 

Revenue-Virginius Mines Corporation (RV) or Silver Star Resources, LLC (Star Resources). 

Figure 4.1.1 presents the location of the Project. 

1.2 Ownership 
The Project is 12% controlled by Fortune through its wholly owned subsidiary Fortune Revenue 

Silver Mines, Inc. (Fortune Revenue). The remaining 88% is controlled by Star, a Colorado limited 

liability private company. Star is controlled by Rory James Williams, James W. Williams, Jr., and 

John A. Bettridge. Williams, Williams and Bettridge are the majority owners of RV and Star 

controlling 98.75%, with the remaining held by other owners at 1.25%. Fortune Revenue has 

operating authority for the mine, mill and surface operations. Fortune Revenue can complete the 

purchase of a 100% interest in the Project by paying an additional US$14 million to Star and the 

other owners by July 31, 2014, subject to a promissory note to pay US$34.5 to US$36.8 million in 

deferred quarterly installments over 3.5 to 5.75 years, respectively and by assuming additional

deferred payments to the previous owners of US$4.5 million and a 2% net smelter return royalty 

capped at US$9 million. 

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 
At the Yellow Rose and Virginius, silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc mineralization is found in 

quartz veins hosted primarily in San Juan volcanic rocks. Veins range from several inches up to 

6 ft in thickness, and have been mined and drilled over a vertical extent of approximately 3,000 ft. 

The Virginius vein has been mapped at surface over a distance of approximate 4,000 ft and the 

Yellow Rose has been traced for up 16,000 ft extending off the Star property. Mineralization 

found in the Virginius and Yellow Rose is interpreted as epithermal (formed at shallow depths and 

low to medium temperatures). Some workers are of the opinion that it may also be interpreted as 

deep epithermal or shallow mesothermal. Mineralization in the veins south of Stony Mountain, 

including the Virginius, is interpreted as shallow emplacement and includes galena, sphalerite, 

pyrite, tetrahedrite arsenopyrite, marcasite and minor covellite. Gangue minerals include quartz, 

barite, sericite, calcite, rhodocrosite, ankerite, siderite and other carbonate minerals. Some 

authors have reported adularia, and other more obscure silicates, carbonates, and sulfates. 

Alteration minerals include sericite, beidellite and other clays as well as iron and magnesium 

oxides (Moore, 2004). 

Trujillo (2012, personal communication) described the tetrahedrite at the Project as freibergite 

and stated that some native silver had been identified. "High grade" mineralization was described 

as massive, occurring in nodules and bands in association with calcite. Galena was described as 

coarse-grained with euhedral crystals up to 3.5 inches long. Quartz occurs as rhythmically 

banded veins characteristic of low sulfidation epithermal vein development. 

1.4 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations 
The Virginius is a past silver producer in the Sneffels Mining District. Silver was reportedly 

discovered at the site in 1876 with underground production beginning in 1880 and continuing 

through 1906 when the mine flooded. Milling continued until 1912 when the mill was destroyed in 

a fire. There is no recorded production after 1912 and the limited production reported cannot be 

verified.  

Since 1912, exploration work has been completed by contractors to the family of A.E. Reynolds 

(the Family) and by leasing agreements between the Family and Camp Bird, Inc. (Federal 

Resources) from 1960 through 1970, Ranchers Exploration and Development Corp. (Ranchers) 

from 1980 to 1984 and Sunshine Mining and Refining Company (Sunshine) from 1994 to 2001. 

Star acquired the Project in 2011. Since then Star has completed 68 surface drillholes, 33 

underground drillholes, 201 channel samples and collected 818 samples from surface dumps and 

tailings. Most of the drilling and channel sampling was focused on the Yellow Rose Veins with 

additional drillholes investigating the Virginius, Terrible and Wheel of Fortune veins. Star has also 

completed exploration and development drifting in the Yellow Rose Vein. In addition, Star has 

collected two bulk samples for completion of metallurgical test work in support of construction of a 

300 t/d mill. In May, 2014 Fortune Revenue obtained a 12% interest in the Project and became 

responsible for operating direction and authority.

1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The Mineral Resource statement, presented in Tables 1.5.1 and 1.5.2, represents the mineral 

resource evaluation prepared for the Revenue Project in accordance with the Canadian 

Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101).   

A four pass inverse distanced squared (ID2) grade estimation methodology was used to estimate 

grades for both Yellow Rose and Virginius veins. Variography was utilized to determined proper 

search ellipsoid orientation and search distances. 

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

There is no certainty that all or any part of this mineral resource will be converted into mineral 

reserve.   

The Project's mineral resources are not materially affected by any known environmental, 

permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, political or other relevant issues. The estimates 

of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves may be materially affected if mining, metallurgical, or 

infrastructure factors change from those currently anticipated. 

The resource estimation for both the Yellow Rose and the Virginius are reported at a minimum 

total recovered block metal value using a mining and milling cost provided by Star of US$150/t. 

Total recovered block metal is based on the following prices and recoveries provided by Star: 

 Ag price of US$20/oz and recovery of 95%; 
 Au price of US$1,250/oz and recovery of 90%; 
 Cu price of US$3.15/lb and recovery of 80%; 
 Pb price of US$1/lb and recovery of 90%; and 
 Zn price of US$1/lb and recovery of 85%. 

Copper was not estimated at Yellow Rose due to lack of validation of the copper database. The 

data were hand entered from historical assay certificates and there were too many data entry 

errors for inclusion in the resource estimation at this time. With additional data review and data 

entry corrections, there is potential to add this data to the resource estimate. Table 1.5.1 presents 

the Yellow Rose resource statement and Table 1.5.2 presents the Virginius Resource statement.

1.6 Preliminary Economic Assessment Results 

1.6.1 Underground Mining 

The available geotechnical information and historic mining information indicates that shrinkage 

stoping is a suitable method for the deposit. The mine is currently in startup production and 

development with underground mine personnel working two 10 hr shifts/day targeting a 

production rate of 400 t/d. 

Mining occurs in two vein systems, the Yellow Rose and the Revenue Virginius. Mine design 

using Vulcan software was completed based on an estimated NSR cut-off grade of US$130/t. 

Stope optimization was used to determine mine plan resource areas based on cut-off grade and a 

minimum mining width of 3 ft.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

Table 1.6.1.1 summarizes the mine plan resources in each area. These numbers include a 90% 

mining recovery to the designed stope wireframes in addition to the 15% unplanned waste 

dilution within stopes. Additional development of 5% to 10% was applied based on development 

type to account for detail currently not in the design. Zero grade was used for the waste dilution.

*Includes Measured, Indicated, and Inferred reported using a marginal cut-off grade of US$50/t.   

 

The PEA is preliminary in nature and is based on technical and economic assumptions which will 

be further evaluated in more advanced studies. The PEA is based on a resource model that 

contains Measured, Indicated and Inferred mineral resources. Inferred mineral resources are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that 

would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA 

will be realized. 

The design was then scheduled using iGantt software to generate a life of mine production 

schedule which is summarized in Table 1.6.1.2.

1.6.2 Processing and Metallurgy 

Preliminary test work on bulk samples taken from the mine indicate that base and precious 

metals may be recovered using standard crushing, grinding, gravity and flotation methods. 

Historically, mineralized material was treated using what today would be considered a 

conventional flotation process. Based on these preliminary results and historical information, Star 

directed CH2M HILL Engineers, Inc. (CH2M HILL) to provide a detailed engineering design for a 

300 t/d plant. 

CH2M HILL designed a conventional flotation plant to process Virginius and Yellow Rose 

mineralized material that includes two-stage crushing, ball mill grinding, reagent storage, flotation,

flotation concentrate filtration for product shipment and a tailings filtration circuit for dry tailings 

disposal. At the time of this writing, the plant has been constructed and is being prepared for 

operation. Commissioning of the mill has commenced; however, steady state operation has yet to 

be achieved. Once steady state operation is achieved mill recovery and grade parameters will be 

verified. 

1.6.3 Geotechnical and Tailings 

No geotechnical studies have been conducted to collect data on rock mass characterization. 

Ground conditions used as the basis for assessing mine design parameters are based on 

observations made during a site visit to the underground workings. 

The vein varies in thickness, proximate location to the dikes, and undulates along both strike and 

dip. Rock mass quality was observed to vary from Very Good, Class I rock (RMR> 80) to Fair, 

Class III rock (40 < RMR < 60). 

In the absence of rock mass characterization data, SRK has not conducted a detailed review of 

optimal mining methods. The PEA relies on historic mining methods used in the historic ground 

conditions and it is assumed that all stopes will be mined using shrinkage stope method.  

SRK has made a preliminary assessment using empirical design methods for sizing pillars and 

stopes at the mine. The stope design parameters have been assumed rock mass properties.  

Although pillar dimensions will be a function of the mined vein thickness in various ground 

conditions the following average stope design parameters have been used 

 Rib pillars are about 6 ft wide; 
 Surface crown pillar is about 7.5 ft wide; 
 Sill pillars are about 12.5 ft wide; and 
 Maximum stope length is 125 ft long with 125 ft between levels. 

The PEA design assumes only spot bolting will be required in weaker rock areas. This has been 

incorporated into the design by including 4 ft long split sets on a 4-ft spacing over 5% of the new 

workings. It is assumed that 10% of the historic workings that are rehabbed will require this 

average level of ground support. 

A TSF will be constructed near the Revenue Tunnel portal. The current permit allows for total 

tailings storage of 482 kt between the Revenue pile and the Atlas pile. The Company has stated 

that with a permit modification the capacity could be increased to about 4 Mt.  

1.6.4 Infrastructure 

The Project infrastructure is largely in existence at the mine. The mine is located approximately 

5.5 miles southwest of Ouray, Colorado, and accessible year round via dirt roads. Power and 

water are available on site and in case of loss of permanent power a diesel powered backup 

generator is being installed. A local workforce exists in surround towns to support the mine. 

1.6.5 Environmental and Permitting 

At this date, it appears that all necessary environmental studies and permitting activities are 

either completed or well-defined and progressing satisfactorily to facilitate Project startup. The

Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 7 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

Company has indicated an awareness of potential future permitting requirements associated with 

various tailing disposal capacity enhancement options. Likewise, other programs are in place to 

ensure ongoing monitoring requirements are carried out and necessary environmental 

management actions integrated (as required) into existing permits. 

No significant outstanding environmental studies or permitting issues have been identified; 

however, authorization of production-scale operations remains contingent on Fortune 

satisfactorily addressing various "conditions" attached to the Colorado Division of Reclamation, 

Mining and Safety (DRMS) 112-D Reclamation Permit. In general, these conditions pertain to a 

demonstration (and DRMS "acceptance" of the results) that the produced mill tailing will be 

rendered virtually "inert" after flotation processing and dewatering/filtration. While pilot-scale 

milling and tailing analyses are ongoing at the time of this review, it is anticipated that such will be 

the case, and the proposed dry stack tailing disposal method will move forward (allowing scale-up 

to production status). An additional condition potentially influencing the actual production start-up 

date is associated with Fortune's satisfactory characterization of baseline groundwater 

characteristics in the proposed tailing storage area(s); it is anticipated that recent data, along with 

the use of historic data, will achieve this objective and allow production-scale start-up to occur in 

a timely manner.

1.7 Conclusions 
SRK considers that the project is amenable to underground mining methods. It is the goal of the 

PEA to present an option for mine development of the Project that best fits Fortune's corporate 

strategy of maximizing the mine life which Fortune states allows them to capitalize on anticipated 

future exploration upside and silver price increases. This approach does not necessarily 

maximize the NPV of the project presented herein. 

The metallurgical flow sheet for the PEA includes lead concentrate, zinc concentrate, and gravity 

concentrate. The mill is designed to operate at 300 t/d but modifications underway should allow 

the mill throughput to ramp-up to 400 t/d by 2015. The average annual throughput is 

approximately 140,000 t/y based on operating at 400 t/d for 350 days per year. 

Highlights of the PEA include: 

 Underground mine life of eight years, which includes a ramp up and ramp down; 
 Combined mine plan resources of 888.3 kt from two separate mining areas; 
 Mine plan resource average yearly contained silver of 1.86 Moz silver; 
 Mill annual average production (recovered) of 1.7 Moz of equivalent silver (AgEq); 
 Average cash operating cost (including by-products) of US$11.16/oz AgEq; 
 Capital in the first year (2014) is US$6.4 million; and 
 After-tax IRR of 73.2% and NPV (6%) of US$58.8 million. This mine has already been 

significantly developed and the cashflow model is not reflective of sunk costs except for 

the impact on depreciation.

2 Introduction 
SRK was retained by Fortune to update the resource estimate for the Yellow Rose Vein, the 

Virginius Vein and the Terrible Vein with analytical data from new drilling and channel sampling 

completed by Star and to complete PEA level mine design, production schedule, and economic 

evaluations. Additional claims had been staked around the Virginius to cover the entire deposit 

area. The Yellow Rose and Virginius Project are located in Sneffels, Colorado, Ouray County, 

approximately 8 miles southwest of the town of Ouray, Colorado.  

The PEA was developed subsequent to completion of the resource work. 

2.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose of the Report 
This report was prepared as a PEA for Fortune by SRK on the Revenue Mine.  

The quality of information, conclusions, and estimates contained herein is consistent with the 

level of effort involved in SRK's services, based on: i) information available at the time of 

preparation, ii) data supplied by outside sources, and iii) the assumptions, conditions, and 

qualifications set forth in this report. This report is intended for use by Fortune subject to the 

terms and conditions of its contract with SRK and relevant securities legislation. The contract 

permits Fortune to file this report as a Technical Report with Canadian securities regulatory 

authorities pursuant to NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Except for the 

purposes legislated under provincial securities law, any other uses of this report by any third party 

is at that party's sole risk. The responsibility for this disclosure remains with Fortune. The user of 

this document should ensure that this is the most recent Technical Report for the property as it is 

not valid if a new Technical Report has been issued. 

This report provides mineral resource estimates, and a classification of resources prepared in 

accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on 

Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines, November 27, 2010. The PEA is 

preliminary in nature that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be 

realized. This report follows the format of Canadian National Instrument Form 43-101F1. 

This report includes technical information, which required subsequent calculations to derive 

subtotals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of 

rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not 

consider them to be material.

4.2.1 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest 

The mining claims, the Revenue Tunnel, all mining equipment, surface equipment and buildings, 

milling equipment and operations located on these claims are owned or controlled by Fortune, 

Star Resource, Star or RV. Fortune is the operator of the Project.  

Patented claims grant both fee simple ownership of the surface of the land and all underlying 

minerals. Unpatented mining claims grant ownership to the underlying minerals and permit use of 

the surface for activities and infrastructure required to exploit the underlying minerals.  

Owners of patented mining claims are required to pay annual county property taxes to hold the 

land and beyond payment of taxes, ownership is in perpetuity. Unpatented mining claims grant 

provisional ownership of the underlying minerals and to maintain this ownership annual fees of 

US$140 per claim are due the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) by September 1 of each 

year. Fortune records an affidavit of payment of the BLM claim fee with the Clerk and Recorders 

office of Ouray County. This is not a legal requirement, but the fee for recording is US$6 for the 

first page, US$5 for each additional page and US$0.25 for each claim name paid to Ouray 

County.  

The claims covering the Yellow Rose vein zone are accessible on surface from County Road 26 

(the Yankee Boy Basin Road). Surface access to the claims covering the Virginius and Terrible 

veins is along County Road 26 (the Governor Basin Road).  

The Revenue Tunnel is a historical access that passes out of the Fortune, Star Resources, Star 

and RV controlled claims and under U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The USFS manages surface 

activities and not mineral rights. As a historic access, without active mining other than maintaining 

an open travel-way, and no surface impact, it is unlikely that the USFS would have requirements 

for the use of the Revenue Tunnel. However, the areas of the Revenue Tunnel that are 

unprotected by mining claims could be vulnerable to over-staking by a third party, which could 

potentially impact access to the Virginius and Terrible veins.  

SRK cannot advise on mining law and does not know the legal ramifications of this situation. SRK 

recommends that Fortune obtain a legal opinion regarding access through the Revenue Tunnel 

under USFS land. 

4.3 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 
The Project is 12% controlled by Fortune through its wholly owned subsidiary Fortune Revenue. 

The remaining 88% is controlled by Star, a Colorado limited liability private company. Star is 

controlled by Rory James Williams, James W. Williams, Jr., and John A. Bettridge. Williams, 

Williams and Bettridge are the majority owners of RV and Star controlling 98.75%, with the

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

remaining held by other owners at 1.25%. Fortune Revenue has operating authority for the mine, 

mill and surface operations. 

On May 8, 2014, Fortune completed the first phase of the planned purchase of a 100% interest in 

the Revenue Mine in southwestern Colorado through its wholly owned subsidiary Fortune 

Revenue. The first phase was completed on May 8, 2014 when Fortune Revenue obtained a 12% 

participating interest in the Mine by paying US$2 million and by issuing 32 million shares in 

Fortune's capital stock. Fortune Revenue can purchase a 100% interest in the mine by paying an 

additional US$14 million by July 31, 2014 and by issuing a promissory note to pay between 

US$34.5 million and US$36.5 million in deferred quarterly installments over 3.5 to 5.75 years as 

determined by revenue targets commencing in August 2015. Fortune Revenue will also assume 

obligations to make two deferred payments totaling US$4.5 million and pay a 2% net smelter 

return royalty, which is capped at US$9 million to the former owners of the Revenue Silver Mine.  

Star executed a mining lease dated June 26, 2012 covering 7.51 net acres in Nada and Lizard 

claims from Ouray County for a term of 40 years and for so long as production continues. The 

Lease provides for annual payment of US$75 and additional payment if production is obtained. 

Star obtained a Winter Road Maintenance Agreement from Ouray County dated November 15, 

2013 to June 30, 2014, allowing Star to remove snow from CR26 and CR361 for access to the 

mine. This will require renewal by Fortune for the winter of 2014/2015. 

4.4 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting  
SRK has not independently identified or been otherwise made aware of any existing significant or 

potentially significant environmental liabilities associated with the subject property or Project. SRK 

has conducted a limited review of existing permits and status, as further discussed in Section 20 

of this Technical Report. 

4.4.1 Environmental Liabilities 

Fortune indicates that there are no identified environmental liabilities associated with the subject 

property and/or the Project. 

4.4.2 Required Permits and Status 

All surface disturbances are indicated to be located on patented mining claims, which shortens 

the list of required permits for the site. The Project has obtained the following permits, which 

comprise the primary permits necessary to allow the mining operations to proceed (when 

compliant with all other applicable laws and regulations): 

 State of Colorado - Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety 112D Permit; 
 State of Colorado- Water Quality Control Division Wastewater Discharge Permit; and 
 State of Colorado- Water Quality Control Division Mine Stormwater Discharge Permit.  

There is a US$277,078 bond in place with the Colorado DRMS for reclamation at the end of the 

mine life. A recent (pending) Technical Revision to the DRMS 112-D Permit contains a proposed 

increase in the reclamation bond amount which would result in a new total bond amount of 

US$330,000, if approved as submitted/calculated. The site operator has also conducted wetlands 

delineation work and obtained coverage under USACE Nationwide Permit No. 44 relative to

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

planned filling of a portion of the existing Revenue Pond to accommodate expansion of the 

planned Revenue Waste Pile as a dry stack tailing repository area. No other permits are required 

from Ouray County as the Project (as an underground mining operation) holds a "use-by-right" 

classification as defined under Section 22 of the Ouray County Land Use Code. This was 

confirmed in a letter from the Ouray County Land Use Department dated March 27, 2012. 

4.5 Other Significant Factors and Risks 
The current Revenue tailings storage facility (TSF) is within a defined avalanche run-out zone, 

thus introducing seasonal operating constraints and a need for an additional TSF (the proposed 

Atlas TSF) to accommodate winter tailing storage placement. Regardless, Fortune indicates that 

appropriate avalanche deflection features to protect personnel and activities and the TSF itself 

from potential avalanche damage will be constructed/utilized at the Revenue facility.  

The Company has stated that berms are constructed out of snow in the winter to protect the 

buildings adjacent to the TSF. The current permit allows for total tailings storage of 482,431 t 

between the main disposal area (Revenue Waste Pile) and the proposed Atlas Waste Pile. Star 

has stated that the capacity could be increased to about 4 Mt with a permit modification. 

Incremental tailing storage capacity options are being examined, inclusive of potential expansion 

of the Atlas Waste Pile and/or implementation of paste backfill disposal underground. Limited 

quantities of waste rock are to be co-disposed with tailing in each of these facilities. 

The current "permitted area" associated with the Company's operations comprises a total of 

34.19 ac, virtually all of which encompasses historic mine development areas. Inasmuch as 

additional areas of historic disturbance are present in the immediate surrounds, any future effort 

by Fortune Revenue to expand the permit area to include other previously disturbed areas in the 

Project area would require permit modification through the Division of Reclamation, Mining and 

Safety (DMRS) "Amendment" process. However, to the extent such areas are not further 

disturbed in the course of Fortune Revenue's operations or otherwise re-disturbed by Fortune 

Revenue, such historic surface disturbance would be considered by DRMS to be "pre-law" (i.e., 

such disturbance occurred prior to the 1976 implementation of the Colorado Mined Land 

Reclamation Act) and therefore not subject to inclusion in the Fortune Revenue reclamation 

obligation.  

Fortune is currently addressing certain "conditions" attached to the DRMS 112-D Permit which 

could potentially influence the ultimate production start-up date, namely: (1) characterization, and 

"acceptance" by DRMS of produced tailing characteristics relative to moisture content, residual 

metal content, and sulfide content; and (2) characterization of baseline groundwater quality. 

Neither of these is viewed by SRK as posing a "significant" Project risk; however, corresponding 

schedule and/or cost impacts, if any, should be taken into consideration, particularly if mill 

throughput is to be increased from 300 to 400 t/d.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
The Project is located in southwestern Colorado near the town of Ouray, in Ouray County. Ouray 

is approximately 335 highway miles or approximately 5.5 hours by road southwest of Denver via 

Interstate 70 and US Highways 50 and 550.  

The San Juan Mountains in general and the Revenue area in particular are rugged young 

volcanic mountains with steep topography. Glacial valleys form the broadest areas of relatively 

flat ground but are typically surrounded by steep walls. Within the Project area, elevations range 

from about 10,000 ft to nearly 13,500 ft.  

The portal site is developed on a large flat area of historic mine waste at the portal of the 

Revenue Tunnel where the surface buildings and infrastructure are located. This area will also 

accommodate the tailings from the 300 t/d flotation mill. Work is underway to expand the mill to 

400 t/d. The mill is underground in the Revenue portal area. In addition, this area will also be 

used for waste rock from underground mining operations. SRK has not reviewed the capacity of 

the TSF or waste rock storage for the Project.  

Vegetation on the property is typical of Sub-alpine areas of the southern Rocky Mountains. North 

facing slopes are typically covered by evergreen trees while south facing slopes are drier and 

have plants requiring less moisture. A detailed listing of plants present on the Project is shown in 

Table 5.1.1.

5.2 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property 
To access the property from Ouray follow County Road (CR) 361 southwest up Canyon Creek 

past the Camp Bird Mine. The portal of the Revenue Tunnel is 6.7 miles from the beginning of CR 

361 on the south side of Sneffels Creek. Current surface activity is at the Revenue Portal located 

at longitude -107.750° W, latitude37.974° N (Figure 5.2.1). In the local mine grid coordinates the 

portal is at 100,630 ft E, 99,100 ft N. The bulk of the historical underground work was centered 

approximately 1.3 miles to the southwest at approximately 107.773°W., latitude 37.967°N or 

approximately 97,790 ft E, 95,070 ft N in the local mine grid. 

During the summer months the property is accessible by high clearance two-wheel drive vehicles. 

During the winter four-wheel drive vehicles are required since the road is snow covered.

information is for Ouray located at an elevation of approximately 7,800 ft, which is about 2,860 ft 

lower than the Revenue portal at 10,660 ft. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for Ouray 

is "Dfb" - "Warm Summer Continental Climate". The average temperature for the year in Ouray is 

44.3°F. The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of 64.7°F. The

coolest month, on average, is January with an average temperature of 25.8°F. The highest 

recorded temperature in Ouray is 96.0°F in June and the lowest recorded temperature 

was -22.0°F in January. 

Average annual precipitation for Ouray is 23.1 inches. March is the wettest month with 2.3 inches 

of precipitation falling as snow while June is the driest with 1.1 inches of precipitation. Average 

annual snowfall is 140.2 inches.  

The portal area and mine surface infrastructure are located at an elevation of 10,660 ft on the 

south side of Sneffels Creek in a steep-walled valley between approximately 1,000 ft below 

timberline. The area near the portal is classified as Sub-alpine but the higher elevation of the 

property, are in the Alpine climate zone. The Project area experiences broad temperature swings 

both within and between seasons. During winter months temperatures hover near freezing on 

warmer days to well below zero on cold days and nights. During summer, temperatures vary from 

the 50's°F to modestly below freezing on cooler nights to the upper 70's and low 80's°F on very 

warm days. Anecdotal information suggests that the average temperature at the portal is typically 

10°F cooler and winter snowfall perhaps double that falling in Ouray.  

The Project is accessible year-around although heavy winter snow in the area requires plowing 

from about November through May. The road beyond the Revenue portal is not maintained in the 

winter and even in summer it is a four wheel drive road. During winter, snowfall can accumulate 

to depths of 5 to 10 ft and avalanches can be a hazard. The Project has avalanche controls in 

place during the winter months. During the summer months thunderstorms are frequent and can 

be severe with lightning and heavy rainfall that can cause flash flooding in the streams. 

5.4 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 
Since the area is located on patented mining claims owned and controlled by Star and RV, 

certain permitting activities are simplified. The mineral deposits are located at variable distances 

to the southeast of the portal and accessed from the Revenue tunnel.  

5.5 Infrastructure Availability and Sources 
There is a commercial airport in Grand Junction. Montrose has a smaller airport and both are 

served by regularly scheduled commercial air service and can accommodate small regional jets.  

5.5.1 Power 

The company has access to 12,470 volt, three-phase commercial electric power supplied by San 

Miguel Power Company.  

5.5.2 Water 

The Company has water rights associated with the purchase of the mining claims. Currently, 

water used at the Project comes from the Revenue Mine. The outflow from the underground is a 

minimum of 200 g/m, which will be sufficient to supply the processing plant. The Company also 

has conditional water rights to take up to 3.34 cubic feet per second (cfs) from Sneffels Creek.

5.5.3 Mining Personnel 

The workforce in the area includes workers trained in industrial applications and includes oil field, 

mining and forest workers. Industrial parts and equipment are also easily available. Grand 

Junction is 60 miles north of Montrose and is the major industrial center for the western Colorado 

and eastern Utah. Grand Junction has been and remains a center for mining and industrial 

activity and is the most important source for such supplies between Denver, Colorado and Salt 

Lake City, Utah.  

5.5.4 Tailings Storage Areas 

Two discrete TSFs will be constructed, one near the Revenue Tunnel portal and a second facility 

atop the area currently occupied by the former Atlas mill tailings. The current permit allows for 

total tailings storage of approximately 400 to 500 kt between the Revenue pile and the Atlas pile. 

The Company has stated that with a permit modification the capacity could be increased to 

approximately 4 Mt.  Additional information on the TSF is provided in section 18.5 of this report. 

5.5.5 Waste Disposal Areas 

The Company envisions using a shrinkage stope mining method. A minimal amount of waste rock 

is transported out of the mine as part of an agreement with the county for road bed material. 

Waste rock will be produced from development headings that are not driven on the vein. Waste 

rock will be co-disposed with tailing at either/both the Revenue and Atlas TSF dry stack features. 

In addition, the Company indicates that some portion of this material could be used for road 

material and is discussing this with the City of Ouray and a company in Montrose, Colorado. 

Additional information on waste rock storage is provided in Section 18.6 of this report. 

5.5.6 Processing Plant Site 

A 300 t/d crushing, grinding and flotation facility has been constructed at the Project site. 

Operations are currently assessing the capacity of the different mill components and have plans 

to increase throughput to 400 t/d. The major components in crushing, grinding and flotation 

appear to have sufficient capacity for such a change. The crushing, grinding and flotation facilities 

are located in an underground cavern that has been excavated adjacent to the Yellow Rose exit 

portal of the mine. Tailing filtration facilities are located in a made to purpose building immediately 

outside of the excavated mill cavern. 

Water supply for the plant will be provided by mine drainage. The water is of sufficient quality as 

to be used for processing.

6 History  
The following text and Table 6.1 summarizes the history of the Project and, unless otherwise 

noted, is taken substantially from an internal Star report by Steve Zahony (2013) and from an 

internal memorandum written by Sunshine on the property dated January 12, 2001. 

The history of the Revenue Mine property is well documented by past reports, most notably by 

the Sunshine Mining and Refining Company (Sunshine) Information Memorandum dated January 

12, 2001. Table 6.1 is a summary outline of the property's mining history and lists key individuals 

involved at various times. The property has had two owners since 1886. A.E. Reynolds was the 

principal owner of the Caroline Mining Co. and its successor companies and his heirs remained 

the owners of the property until its purchase by Star in 2011 (Zahony, 2013).  

After the outcrop discovery of the Virginius Vein in 1876 and its near-surface development, the 

property was purchased in 1880 and developed by the Caroline Mining Company under the 

direction of A. E. Reynolds. The earliest work occurred at high elevations in Governor Basin and 

mostly from the 3rd Level portal. The 3rd Level became the primary access to the vein and 

development of the mine progressed downward through a 1,100 ft internal shaft from the 3rd Level 

to the 14th Level (Zahony, 2013).  

When logistics and costs became too challenging to continue mining from the 3rd Level and 

Virginius Shaft, the Revenue Tunnel was driven between 1888 and 1893 to access the Virginius 

vein at depth. The Revenue Tunnel Company spent nearly five years driving the Revenue 

Tunnel. The Tunnel intersected several veins en route to the Virginius vein and these became 

targets for varying levels of exploration and production. Among these was the Cumberland-Atlas 

vein system which was mined during this period. When miners reached the Virginius structure in 

the Revenue Tunnel, they encountered a strong eastern or footwall structure of the vein, and later 

a western or main structure. They drifted on the main structure to the southeast for over 5,000 ft, 

to beyond where the Virginius vein intersected the Montana Vein system (Zahony, 2013). 

Caroline Mines operated the mine for its most productive period from 1880 to 1901. Several set-

backs resulted in limited production beyond 1901. In 1906, a fire in the upper workings caused 

electrical damage and failure resulting in flooding on levels below the Revenue Level. The 

following year the Revenue mill burned. Work beyond the mill fire was limited to small scale 

mining and exploration (Zahony, 2013).  

After A. E. Reynolds' death in 1921, the property was managed by his daughter and son in-law. 

Work during this period included modest development work over the next several years including 

the construction of a small 10 t/d ball mill and limited stoping (Zahony, 2013).  

In 1923 the northwest extension drift on the Terrible vein was channel sampled along its length 

on approximately 6 ft centers. The average sample width was thought to be 2 ft. No economic 

mineralization was located at that time but the results showed silver values of <1 oz/t and variable 

gold values ranging from 0.01 to 0.76 oz/t and averaging in the range of 0.05 to 0.06 oz/t Au. No 

distinct shoots of higher grade vein material were identified. These grades have not been 

confirmed through modern sampling. Other work included channel sampling a raise and 

associated levels near the end of the northwest-trending drift above the Revenue Level. Channel

sampling of the raise and various levels did not identify economic mineralization at the time but 

were similar to those in the lower drift (Zahony, 2013).  

In 1938, the family of A.E. Reynolds contracted geologist George Garrey to direct development of 

the Project. Garrey assumed management of the family's mining assets including the Revenue 

Mine. He wrote two summary reports on the Revenue Mine property's veins and their exploration 

potential, one on October 5, 1947 (Garrey, 1947) and a second on October 5, 1949 (Garrey, 

1949). These reports formed the basis for the modern exploration of the Revenue property by 

Camp Bird Colorado, Inc. (Federal Resources), Ranchers Exploration and Development Corp. 

(Ranchers), and Sunshine (Zahony, 2013). 

According to Garrey (1947), pre-1922 production from the Cumberland was US$153,590, with an 

additional US$16,862 having been mined by lessees from 1922 to 1926. Of the 12,000 t mined 

before 1922, 4,200 t were hand-cobbed and shipped, averaging 0.136 oz/t Au, 28.5 oz/t Ag, and 

25.5% Pb. These grades have not been confirmed by modern sampling.  

Between 1948 and 1953, there was work on the Wheel of Fortune vein. The Wheel of Fortune 

vein was intersected by several long drifts that followed veins crossing the Revenue Tunnel to the 

southeast. Intersections between the Yellow Rose, Anglo-Saxon, Cumberland, and Virginius 

veins failed to find economic mineralization within the Wheel of Fortune structure at the Revenue 

Tunnel level and the Wheel of Fortune as not historically mined in these areas (Zahony, 2013). 

Limited production from Wheel of Fortune vein was low but reportedly "high grade", most of it 

coming from a single mineralized shoot that was mined on three levels over a vertical extent of 

400 ft immediately above the main adit level. This principal level consists of a drift along the 

Wheel of Fortune vein with a portal on the southwest slope of Sneffels Creek's valley at an 

elevation of 10,680 ft. The drift is 1,730 ft long, following the vein in a southwesterly direction 

extending through its intersection with the Yellow Rose Vein and beyond for another 450 ft from 

that intersection. The single mineralized shoot on the Wheel of Fortune claim was discovered 

cropping out at the surface and was worked down following the northeasterly rake of the shoot to 

just above the long main drift level that was driven below the stope. Production from the shoot 

was high in silver but the shoot narrowed with depth. The long drift encountered no economic 

mineralization though several shallow experimental stopes were attempted. Towards the 

northeast from the portal, in the opposite direction from the drift and across Sneffels Creek, the 

trace of the Wheel of Fortune vein is followed by the Potosi patented claim. Beyond the Potosi 

claim the Wheel of Fortune structure appears to continue further to the northeast with the rising 

surface slope to the Bimetallic Mine, whose portal is at an elevation of 11,475 ft. Production at 

this mine was high grade silver-gold mineralized material but the Bimetallic Mine is outside the 

present Project boundaries. Federal Resources leased the property in 1960 and in their five-year 

lease period drove over 3,440 ft of headings, mostly to the north of the Virginius Shaft No.1 on 

both the Revenue Tunnel and the 210 Levels. This also included work in the Cumberland vein 

workings and the Belcoe Raise. Camp Bird work included channel sampling, experimental mining 

and test milling at the Camp Bird milling facility. Records are not available detailing how much 

Camp Bird spent in their work.  

The most complete and usable exploration and development information on the Revenue Mine 

property was generated by Ranchers between 1980 and 1984 when Ranchers spent 

US$8.5 million in exploration and was committed to take the property to production. However,

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

Ranchers' hard-rock mining assets were purchased by Hecla Mining in mid-1984 and Hecla shut 

down the Revenue Project. Sunshine leased the Revenue Mine property in 1994 and between 

that date and the termination of its lease in 2001, spent an additional US$1.2 million in its study of 

the Virginius and Yellow Rose veins and in exploratory surface drilling of other veins. Sunshine 

built on earlier Ranchers' work to construct a modern digital database of all previous channel 

sampling and drilling and created a 3D digital model of the underground workings. They also 

expended considerable effort toward estimating and frequently updating "reserves" on the 

property (Zahony, 2013). Star was only able to recover paper copies of Sunshine's channel 

sample and drillhole database and has since recreated a digital database from the paper copies.  

Star acquired the Project in 2011 from RV through a combination of a stock purchase of the 

Revenue Virginius Mines Corporation dated September 21, 2011, and closed June 25, 2012. Star 

has expanded the Project with further land acquisitions. Star conducted exploration including 

drilling and channel sampling in both the Virginius and the Yellow Rose between 2012 and 2013. 

This work supports the resource estimates reported in this Technical Report and are discussed in 

Sections 9 and 10, exploration and drilling, respectively.   

On May 8, 2014, Fortune Revenue obtained a 12% interest in the Project and operating authority 

for the mine, mill and surface operations.  

A complete summary of the history can be seen in Table 6.1.

6.1 Historical Production 
Research into the historical production records by Perry (2013) indicates that the records are 

incomplete. The majority of the production from the mine occurred between its discovery in 1876 and 

the flooding and fires that occurred in 1906 and 1912. Specific production records for the period 

1876 to 1895 are not available. A. E. Reynolds' heirs believe that many of these early records had 

been stored at the mill and were destroyed in the 1912 fire. However, this was a very productive 

period in the mine's history and involved all or most of the production from the surface to the 

14 Level of the mine. The longitudinal sections of the Revenue vein show the major extent of this 

productive period. The vein tended to be wider high in the mine and thus would represent more tons 

mined from a similar area of stoping as viewed on a long section.  

In 1976, Tremlett compiled production records from 1895 to 1906. His records begin roughly when 

the Revenue Tunnel would have reached the Virginius vein and probably represent production 

between the Revenue Tunnel and the 14 Level and from the Revenue Tunnel level down to the 550 

Level. Table 6.1.1 is modified from Tremlett (1976). It is a summary of production for the 12-year 

period between 1895 and 1906 and documents approximately 10.1 Moz of silver production. It is 

estimated that approximately 204,000 t were milled. Between 1901 and 1906, the average grade of 

the product sold was 14.89 oz/t Ag, 0.083 oz/t Au and 4.38 % Pb. The 10.1 Moz of silver reported by 

Tremlett (1976) does not include pre-1895 production or the more modest production from 1907 

through about 1920. Sunshine (2001) speculated that at least 15 Moz of silver was produced over 

the life of the Project, but this has not been confirmed.

6.2 Historical Resource Estimate 
Sunshine utilized an electronic database and 3D computer model of the mine to estimate, and 

frequently revise, the tonnage and grade of mineralization that had been defined from drilling and 

channel sampling of the lower workings of the mine.

Sunshine optioned the Project from RV in 1994 and completed surface mapping and 15 surface 

drillholes between 1994 and 1996. In 1998, Sunshine completed a feasibility study and published a 

historical reserve estimate of 6.2 Moz of silver for the Mine in its annual reports. This estimate does 

not comply with international reporting standards or guidelines. Table 6.2.1 presents the reserve 

reported by Sunshine in December 1998 (Sunshine Mining & Refining Company, 2000;

Sunshine carried the Project on its books until 2001 when they ended their option agreement. 

Sunshine's final 2001 estimate of proven and probable reserves in the Virginius Vein are 174,500 t 

27.3 oz/t Ag, 0.072 oz/t Au, 4.59% Pb, 1.71% Zn and 0.35% Cu, at an average diluted mining width 

of 2.1 ft. Proven and probable reserves for the Yellow Rose were 84,540 t grading 0.045 oz/t Au, 

17.0 oz/t Ag, 2.33% Pb, 1.87% Zn, and 0.14% Cu. This was with a 3.8 ft diluted mining width. 

In 2012, SRK reviewed the Sunshine data and conducted a historical resource estimate that was not 

for public reporting. SRK's resource estimate is listed in the Table 6.2.2 for the Virginius Vein System 

and was only classified as inferred based on the confidence in the data at that time.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization  

7.1 Regional Geologic Setting 
The San Juan Mountains are the erosional remnants of a large Tertiary volcanic field covering 

roughly 9,500 square miles in southwestern Colorado. The volcanic field was formed between 35+ 

and 22.5 Ma ago and contains fifteen defined and two buried calderas (Steven and Lipman, 1976). 

The older pre-caldera volcanic rocks, thought to have formed 35 to 30 Ma ago, consisted of 

intermediate, predominantly andesitic, flows and flow breccias. About 30 Ma ago the eruptive 

character became more explosive depositing rocks of intermediate to more felsic composition. The 

character of the volcanism changed again at about 28 Ma to a bi-modal suite of basaltic and rhyolitic 

rocks with the largest volume of felsic rocks consisting of the Sapinero Mesa Tuff which was erupted 

from the San Juan and Uncompahgre calderas.  

7.1.1 Revenue Area Geologic Setting 

Most relevant to the Project are the nearby San Juan-Uncompahgre, Silverton and Lake City 

Calderas shown in Figure 7.1.1.1. These lie to the east of the Project. The San Juan-Uncompahgre 

Caldera is a large northeast-aligned volcanic depression consisting of the earlier Uncompahgre and 

San Juan Calderas which in turn host the younger Lake City Caldera in its northeast portion and the 

Silverton Caldera at its southwestern segment. Steven and Lipman (1976) are of the opinion that the 

Silverton/San Juan/Lake City/Uncompahgre Caldera system is unique in the San Juan Mountains in 

that it displays the best developed radial/concentric fracture system of any of the calderas in the San 

Juan Mountains. Steven and Lipman (1976) speculate that this complex and strong faulting are likely 

the control for the vein systems in the San Juan Mountains.

7.2 Local Geology 
The dominant rock formation in the Revenue area is the 35 to 30 Ma andesitic San Juan Formation. 

This is a thick package of mostly water-lain volcaniclastic rocks with minor lava flows. These rocks 

are in turn overlain by younger (30 to 28 Ma) ash flows of the Ute Ridge and Blue Mesa Tuffs. 

Volcanism in the Revenue area is interpreted to have begun approximately 28.4 and 26.37 Ma ago 

related to eruptions in the Uncompahgre and San Juan Calderas. This resulted in the deposition of 

the Dillon Mesa and Sapinero Mesa Tuffs. Subsequent doming and collapse resulted in the 

development of the Silverton Caldera and in deposition of the Crystal Lake Tuff approximately 

26.7 Ma. 

Based on stratigraphic relationships, Burbank and Luedke (1966) believe that the Stoney 

Mountain/Sneffels intrusive complex was forming contemporaneously with collapse of the Silverton 

caldera although K-Ar age dating by Lipman and others (1976) yields ages for these intrusives of

about 32 Ma, indicating they had been active for some time prior to development of the Silverton 

Caldera. 

The veins of the Sneffels district seem to occupy structures that were genetically related to the San 

Juan and Silverton Calderas and are radial and concentric structures extending for several miles 

northwest of the actual caldera margin. These structures were apparently influenced by the 

contemporaneous emplacement of the Stony Mountain Stock as evidenced by their propensity to 

merge with the radial pattern of faulting surrounding the Stoney Mountain Stock (Figure 7.2.1, 

modified from Varnes, 1963).

7.2.1 Stratigraphy 

There are several formations exposed within the Project area but not all are exposed in the 

underground workings of the mine. Table 7.2.1.1 is a summary of the rock units which, within the 

area of the mine, span a vertical thickness of nearly 3,500 ft.

Although extensively exposed at surface in the area, the Burns Formation is not recognized within 

the workings of the Revenue Mine. It is believed that the unit pinches out short of its intersection with 

the workings. Below is a discussion of each of the formations oldest to youngest found in the 

Revenue Mine.  

Telluride Conglomerate 

The Eocene Telluride Conglomerate is located in the Project area and while not actually exposed in 

the Revenue mine it has been identified in drilling completed by Ranchers approximately 100 ft 

below the bottom of the No 1 Shaft (700 Level) at about 800 ft below the Revenue Level.  

The Telluride Conglomerate lies unconformably on an erosional platform consisting of rocks from 

Precambrian to Cretaceous in age. It is an arkosic conglomerate with rounded to sub-angular clasts 

of Precambrian quartz and lesser amounts of granitic, sedimentary and volcanic fragments ranging 

in size from pebbles to boulders more than 3 ft in diameter. The larger clasts lie in a matrix of 

ferruginous calcite-cemented fine-grained quartz, feldspars and mica. The Telluride Conglomerate is 

exposed in red to grey cliffs below the Project facilities in the Sneffels Creek Valley. The unit pinches 

and swells and contains discontinuous lenses of sandstone and siltstone. The Telluride 

Conglomerate hosted significant base-metal replacement bodies in the nearby Idarado and Camp 

Bird mines where veins intersected lenses of porous and reactive host carbonate. Because of this, 

the Telluride Conglomerate is considered an economically important rock unit in the district. The 

limited drilling completed by Ranchers that intersected the Telluride Conglomerate did not identify 

any mineralization.

San Juan Formation 

The San Juan Formation is the most extensively exposed rock unit in the vicinity of the Revenue 

Mine. Within the mine workings it is exposed over more than 2,000 vertical feet from the 8th Level 

down to the lowermost -700 Level of the mine. It is the host for the majority of the mineralization. 

The unit is grey to maroon and is made up of heterogeneous, intermediate composition volcanic 

fragments. Clasts range in composition from andesite to quartz latite and some clasts are porphyritic 

within a very fine grained groundmass. Like many of the volcanic units in the western San Juan 

Mountains, it is composed of mud flows, pyroclastic breccias, and water-lain tuffs. The unit was likely 

deposited upon partially dissected flanks of active volcanoes (Lipman et al., 1973). Lipman et al. 

(1973) dated material from a flow breccia at 32.1 Ma  

Mapping in the district by Burbank and Luedke (1964, 1966) and Luedke and Burbank (1962) shows 

the unit to be 2,000 to 2,600 ft thick, similar to its thickness in the mine. Depending on the particular 

facies, the unit is fairly resistant and tends to form steep slopes and cliffs. 

Picayune Formation 

Near the mine, the Picayune Formation occurs as a 50 to 100 ft thick lava flow resting 

unconformably on the San Juan Formation. It is a generally a dark amygdaloidal porphyritic andesite 

to rhyodacite with 2 to 3 millimeter (mm) gray to white subhedral oligoclase laths. Burbank and 

Luedke (1966) interpret the unit to be the lowermost member of the Silverton Volcanic Group but 

Lipman et al. (1973) interpret the unit to be a "down faulted vent-facies accumulation forming the 

cores of early central volcanoes that were the source of the mudflow breccias in the San Juan 

Formation". However, Coxe (1985) disputes that interpretation noting that near the Revenue Mine 

the Picayune Formation occurs as a relatively thin and continuous flow overlying more than 2,000 ft 

of San Juan tuff and deems it to be geologically improbable as an adequate source unit. Coxe (1985) 

also notes that the unit is altered and most of the original dark minerals are no longer identifiable and 

exist as some mix of chlorite, quartz and iron-titanium oxides. 

Eureka Tuff 

The Eureka Tuff is a medium to dark colored rhyodacitic to quartz latitic welded ash flow tuff with 

abundant lithic fragments derived from similar composition lava (Burbank and Luedke, 1966). In the 

Revenue Mine area the unit is discontinuous, lying unconformably on the irregular surface of the 

Picayune Formation, which had been thinned by erosion. Where present, the Eureka Formation can 

be up to 200 ft thick.  

Lipman and others (1973) reinterpreted the unit as part of the Sapinero Mesa Tuff. However, since 

the Eureka tuff occurs nearly 1,000 ft stratigraphically below the Sapinero Mesa Tuff in the Revenue 

Mine area, Coxe (1985) is of the opinion that the Eureka Tuff represents more locally derived 

material from one of the earlier intermediate composition eruptions from the nearby San Juan 

caldera and is not part of the Sapinero Mesa Tuff.  

Burns Formation 

The Burns Formation is best developed as an intra-caldera volcanic unit with complex facies that 

include lava flows, mud flows, breccias and tuffs. The unit is thought to have been deposited from 

several local sources in a topographically complex environment. The eruptive facies of the unit in 

particular extends beyond the rim of the Silverton caldera and at least as far north as the Camp Bird 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

Mine. The Burns Formation crops out in the area, but is interpreted to pinch out short of where it 

would be expected to intersect the Revenue mine workings. 

Similar to the underlying Eureka Tuff, the Burns Formation is an unconformable 0 to 230 ft-thick 

discontinuous unit deposited onto actively developing topography (Burbank and Luedke, 1969). It 

consists of medium to thick bedded rhyodacite and includes massive flows, flow breccias and tuffs 

(Burbank and Luedke, 1966). Based on its stratigraphic position well below the Sapinero Mesa Tuff 

in the area west of the San Juan caldera, Lipman et al. (1973) dispute the interpretation that this unit 

is part of the Sapinero Mesa Tuff and instead place it as part of the early andesitic volcanic rock 

package derived from the San Juan volcanic field.  

Gilpin Peak Tuff 

The Gilpin Peak Tuff represents a collection of separate units and these are the highest units 

exposed in the Revenue Mine area. The Gilpin Peak Tuff actually consists of several mapped units 

with four of these units outcropping in the high peaks near the Project. The lowermost unit of the 

group, the Ute Ridge Tuff, is exposed in the upper three levels of the mine. The base of the Gilpin 

Peak group occurs at about 12,400 ft elevation and all of the remaining units occur above this 

topographic level (Coxe, 1985).  

Lipman et al. (1973) state that the Ute Ridge Tuff correlates with unit one of the Gilpin Peak Tuff and 

this is the unit exposed in the upper Revenue mine workings. It is dated at 28.4 Ma and was likely 

erupted from the inferred Lost Lake Caldera. The rocks consist of red-brown densely welded quartz 

latite with abundant plagioclase, sanidine, biotite and augite phenocrysts. Within the Revenue mine 

area the unit is up to 490 ft thick (Coxe, 1985). 

Unit three of the Gilpin Peak Tuff likely correlates with the Blue Mesa Tuff which researchers also 

believe was erupted from the inferred Lost Creek Caldera. This unit is only found above 12,800 ft 

elevation in the Project area (Coxe, 1985) where it is about 325 ft thick. The rock is a pale red-brown 

densely welded tuff that Lipman et al. (1976) characterize as silica and phenocryst poor rhyolite. 

Units four and five of the Gilpin Peak Tuff are found only at the highest points on the peaks in the 

Project area. Unit 4 is a locally deposited quartz latitic tuff that is only about 30 ft thick. Unit 5 is 

somewhat thicker in the Project area where Burbank and Luedke (1964, 1966) mapped a thickness 

of 80 ft or more. The unit apparently correlates to the Dillon Mesa Tuff and Burbank and Luedke 

(1964, 1966) interpreted it as two cooling units: a lower one consisting of grey-lavender pumice- and 

lithic-rich tuff and an upper cooling unit of red-brown densely welded pumice and crystal-rich tuff with 

a vitrophyric base. 

7.2.2 Dikes 

Northwest trending andesite dikes are common within the Project area and the Virginius vein adjoins 

a dike along most of its mined extent. 

Regionally, dikes are abundant and cross-cut all of the volcanic units. The dikes range in thickness 

from 2 to 20 ft, are mostly northwest trending and typically dip at 65⁰ or steeper. These dikes vary 

from dense aphanitic to porphyritic andesites containing up to 20% phenocrysts (Coxe, 1985). 

Burbank (1941) notes that: "Some veins that follow dike walls are mineralized for horizontal stretches 

of 25,000 ft or more, though not retaining commercial grade throughout." 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 37 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

Particularly along the Virginius vein, a dike known as the Virginius Dike, is typically present, 

sometimes as the host rock and other times as the hanging or footwall to the vein. This dike likely 

plays some role in the mineralizing process, even if only to mark a structurally weak pathway for later 

solutions to follow. The Virginius Dike is an aphanitic to slightly porphyritic andesite that averages 

about 8 ft in thickness. It is easily recognized because it forms a blocky pattern along the mine's ribs 

where it is exposed (Coxe, 1985). The dike's aphanitic groundmass is chloritized with some small 

(0.2 mm) plagioclase microlites. Coxe (1985) says that up to 10% of the rock consists of 1 to 2 mm 

andesine feldspar phenocrysts but otherwise hydrothermal alteration has destroyed the primary 

mineralogy. 

7.2.3 Structure 

Pre-Tertiary structural events are evident in the deeply eroded Uncompahgre Gorge south of Ouray. 

Precambrian through Cretaceous rocks are exposed and display several episodes of intense 

deformation. Overlying these rocks are moderately folded and faulted Paleozoic to Mesozoic units. 

During the Laramide orogeny this package of rocks was domed and earlier faulting was reactivated. 

A later period of movement along these faults can be seen where they offset the overlying San Juan 

Formation as the earliest structural event that may be directly relevant to the structural and 

mineralization history of the Revenue Mine area (Luedke and Burbank, 1962; Burbank and Luedke, 

1964).  

Virtually all of the structural developments relevant to mineralization are related to the several major 

caldera events in the region, particularly the Silverton, San Juan and Uncompahgre Calderas that 

are to the east of the Project and to the caldera-concurrent emplacement of the Stony Mountain 

Stock (Figure 7.2.1).  

These calderas cover an area approximately 15 x 30 miles in extent (Figure 7.2.3.1) and include four 

nested calderas within a larger collapse feature. The initial doming and subsequent collapse of these 

calderas formed a very complex pattern of concentric and radial fractures that control most of the 

veins and dikes in the region, and although somewhat obscured by deposition and erosion, still are 

recognizable in the topography today. The Stony Mountain Stock which lies some five to six miles 

northwest of the rim of the Silverton Caldera, seems to be structurally connected to the Silverton 

caldera by a very prominent fault-vein-dike swarm called the Sneffels Axis (Figure 7.2.3.1). Near the 

caldera rim the concentric and radial faults seem to have been developing at the same time as they 

truncate and/or offset each other.

Figure 7.2.3.1: Important Structural Feature and Principal Veins in the Revenue Mine Area 

 

According to Burbank (1941), dikes fill many of the radial structures near the Stony Mountain Stock, 

but further to the southeast along the Sneffels Axis the proportion of dike-filled structures significantly 

decreases. The central portion of the Sneffels Axis reaches roughly six miles in width. Across the 

axis the structures change from southwest dipping on the southwest side to steeply northeast 

dipping on the northeast side. Burbank (1941) cites this as evidence that these normal faults formed 

largely in response to a down, rather than up, warping of the crust along the axis. Total vertical 

sagging across the axis is estimated to be 200 to 500 ft and Burbank (1941) states that the axis 

developed late, at least post Picayune Formation deposition, since the thickness of the Picayune 

Formation stays constant across the axis rather than thickening due to ponding in the middle if it had

been deposited into an existing depression. The Virginius, Yellow Rose and Terrible Veins are all 

part of the Sneffels Axis group of structures and are situated in the central portion of the axis.  

7.2.4 Mineralization 

Mineralization in the District is found primarily in sub-vertical fissure veins and is classified as a 

telescoped epithermal quartz vein type deposit. The veins are characterized by somewhat 

constrained vertical extents (generally less than 1,000 ft) and a vertical zoning that favors precious 

metals in the upper levels grading into more base-metal rich mineralization with depth. There is also 

replacement mineralization within the calcareous Telluride Conglomerate with up to 80% massive 

sulfide. Replacement mineralization has not been identified in the Revenue Mine.  

Lipman et al. (1976) made a comprehensive effort to age date material from numerous mines in the 

western San Juan Mountains. They identified mineralization dating from as early as 29.6 Ma 

southeast of the Uncompahgre Caldera to as young as 10.2 Ma for mineralization at Camp Bird Mine 

in the District. The more significant deposits tend to date in a narrower range of 22.5 to 16 Ma 

Table 7.2.4.1 summarizes some of the important dates in the district.

7.2.5 Alteration 

Much of the volcanic pile throughout the western San Juan Mountains was subjected to mild to 

strong propylitic alteration resulting in pervasive chlorite and calcite alteration with more intensely 

altered areas also displaying epidote and pyrite. Coxe (1985) states that the type of wall rock along 

the Virginius vein determined the nature of the alteration.  

The Virginius andesite dike displays only minor alteration consisting of chlorite or calcite replacement 

of the mafic minerals and plagioclase. The adjacent San Juan Formation shows stronger propylitic 

alteration. Microscopically, the primary minerals have been replaced with sericite, chlorite, hematite 

and other oxides. Higher in the section the Gilpin Peak ash flow layers display similar alteration to 

the San Juan Formation (Coxe, 1985).  

Mineralizing fluids further altered the rocks adjacent to the veins but typically over shorter distances 

of about 2 ft in the San Juan Formation and 7 ft in the overlying Gilpin Peak units (Coxe, 1985). Coxe 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

(1985) observed that more distal vein-related alteration was dominated by chlorite while sericite was 

dominant nearer the vein and tends to impart a bleached look to the rocks. Concentrations of pyrite, 

siderite and quartz increase to within 2 to 9 inches of the vein where Coxe (1985) states that quartz 

and sericite replace all of the siderite and calcite. Although there are extensive mineralogical 

changes in the altered zone adjacent to the veins, primary breccia textures almost completely 

survive the alteration process (Coxe, 1985).  

7.2.6 Mineralogy of the Mineralization in the Virginius, Terrible and Yellow Rose 
Veins 

Coxe (1985) as well as several other observers at the mine note that the principal mineralogy of the 

Virginius, Terrible and Yellow Rose Veins is remarkably consistent both along strike and over the 

exposed vertical extent of the systems. Table 7.2.6.1 lists the minerals in order of abundance and is 

taken primarily from Coxe's (1985) mineralogical study unless otherwise noted.

Although the principal sulfide minerals are consistently present over the mined extent of the vein, 

Coxe (1985) reported that manganese and iron minerals such as magnetite, ferroan-rhodonite and 

calcian-ferroan-rhodochrosite are observed in the deeper parts of the mine and barite seems to be 

present only high in the vein system. 

Coxe (1985) studied 46 polished sections of Virginius vein material to develop a paragenesis of the 

mineralization. In summary he identified three main stages of mineralization including: 

 The first and predominant stage of vein filling brought deposition of nearly all of the following 
minerals:  

o Galena predominates with lesser sphalerite,  



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 41 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

o Tetrahedrite is the predominant silver mineral and tends to occur intergrown with 

galena and sphalerite, and  

o Pyrite, chalcopyrite and marcasite appear to have been deposited in preexisting 

galena, sphalerite and tetrahedrite. 

 The second stage brought mostly ferroan-rhodonite, calcian-ferroan-rhodochrosite, quartz 
and magnetite with disseminated pyrite which crosscut and replaced earlier vein material; 

and 

 The third stage consisted of open-space filling by gangue minerals, mostly calcite. 

Coxe (1985) studied fluid inclusions from minerals collected mostly from the Revenue Level and 

below. His conclusion was that the average temperature of the mineralizing fluid in Stage 1 

mineralization was between 225°C and 230°C. This indicates that this deposition occurred roughly 

3,300 ft below the surface and that the low salinity (2% to 3% NaCl equivalent) fluids did not boil at 

this level. 

There has been no paragenetic sequence developed for either the Terrible or the Yellow Rose.  

7.2.7 Project Vein Systems 

The following discussion of the important veins within the Project area is taken in part from a Star 

Mine Operations internal report written by Stephen Zahony (Zahony, 2013B). Figure 7.2.7.1 shows 

the relationship between the Yellow Rose, Virginius and Terrible veins as well as additional veins 

that are exploration targets for the Company along the trace of the Revenue Tunnel.

Virginius Vein System 

The most historically productive vein system at the Project is the Virginius and its northern extension, 

which is sometimes referred to as the Monongahela Vein. Reference to the Virginius Vein in this 

report will include the Monongahela. Between 1875 and 1906 this vein system is estimated to have 

produced over 14 Moz of silver with "significant lead and gold credits". A longitudinal section of the 

Virginius Vein's workings by R.S. Trujillo and J.R. Trujillo (1977) shows that the main mineralized 

shoot has the shape of a sail, narrow at the top but lengthening to as much as 3,000 ft strike length 

at the Revenue Tunnel Level. Historical mining below the Tunnel Level to a depth of 350 ft confirmed 

that this mineralized shoot continued below the Revenue Level (Zahony, 2013B). 

Rather than being a single continuous vein, the vein occurs as an intermittently 

stacked/anastomosing system of one to three sub parallel veins separated by up to 100 ft. Frequent 

reference is made to the "hangingwall", "footwall" and "main" vein and all have been productive in 

different parts of the mine. Sunshine Mining subdivided the Virginius into six sub-veins as listed 

below:  

 FW for the footwall vein; 
 HW for the hanging wall vein: 

o V1 for the vein within the Virginius dike, 

o V2 for the vein on the footwall of the Virginius dike, 

o V3 for the vein on the hanging wall of the Virginius dike, and 

o UK and QM for two minor veins between the footwall vein and the dike. 

Given these several parallel vein strands, questions remain if in all cases development followed the 

main vein or one of the several splits during mining. 

The Virginius Vein in the north-northwest heading from the Revenue Tunnel is consistently a distinct, 

8 inch to 1 ft thick, galena bearing vein, with perhaps 2 ft of altered and weakly mineralized rock on 

either side. Wall rock beyond that total width is weakly altered and makes for relatively stable walls 

for mining purposes.  

The vein is continuous over long strike and dip distances and historic stoping occurs extensively 

within a zone 3,600 ft along strike and 2,500 vertical ft. The vein is typically 1 ft or less in width 

although it can be as thick at 3 ft. The largest intercept on the vein was approximately 7 ft.  

The vein strikes from N45°W (near the 3 Level portal) to N25°W in the northwest part of the mine 

(Coxe, 1985). In the upper workings the vein is nearly vertical or even steeply northeast dipping in 

places. An inflection occurs at approximately the 6 level where the vein establishes a southwest dip 

that persists to the lowest workings, varying from 45⁰ to 75⁰ but typically dipping 65⁰ to 75⁰ 

southwest. 

Coxe (1985) says that historical mapping indicates the vein occurs in outcrop as high as 13,300 ft 

and mining occurred as high as the 12,600 ft level. However, in describing his own effort to trace the 

vein at the surface he says the highest outcrops he found that he felt he could confidently associate 

with the Virginius vein were at 12,800 ft. He states that a combination of talus and snow cover and 

the general characteristics of the Gilpin Peak Formation as a host make it difficult to follow the vein 

at surface.

In the mine, the vein tends to follow the Virginius andesite dike and can occur as the hanging wall, 

footwall or interior to the dike although close proximity is almost always the case. The dike is strongly 

altered with much of the original mineralogy and texture destroyed or replaced. It does not appear 

that the vein is genetically related to the dike but may rather simply follow the same zone of 

weakness that the dike exploited.  

The vein tends to be narrow but continuous and typically consists of quartz with variable amounts of 

galena, tetrahedrite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. The mineralogy of the vein is remarkably constant 

over the very large vertical and horizontal span, although the silver grade is variable (Benham, 

1980). Tetrahedrite is the principal silver mineral in the mine and can reach concentrations of 15% 

silver by weight.  

Terrible Vein System 

The Terrible Vein has an overall N60°W strike with a steep southwesterly dip. Historical production 

came from workings with portals on three levels spaced at about 100 vertical feet with adits along the 

south slopes of Governor Basin ranging in elevation from 12,050 to 12,270 ft. A 4th and 5th Level 

were reached by means of internal shafts but stoping only occurred above the 4th Level or above 

11,950 ft elevation. The Terrible vein system is intersected by the Revenue Tunnel and followed by a 

drift to the northwest of the tunnel for 1,202 ft and to the southeast for 850 ft. The intersection of the 

Terrible Vein with the Virginius vein system was identified as an exploration target by Ranchers who 

drilled one core hole from the surface. Sunshine drilled two holes in this region in 1995, and Star 

drilled an additional 30 surface core holes into this target. The results from this data are widely 

spaced but some of the data contributes to the Virginius resource estimate but not the classification. 

A longitudinal section constructed by J.R. Trujillo in 1998 but revised in 2013 shows the old workings 

and modern drillhole pierce points. There are exploration targets below the stoped areas in the 

Terrible Vein. This is the most prospective part of the Terrible vein system that needs to be drilled 

from the surface, if topography allows. Several reports state that some high grade gold was found in 

the Sidney claim segment of the system. This has not been confirmed by modern sampling.  

Yellow Rose Vein 

Development of the Revenue Tunnel provided deep access to several veins in the District including 

the Yellow Rose Vein. The Yellow Rose is a northwest trending vein sub-parallel to the Virginius 

located more than 5,000 ft to the northeast. The Yellow Rose was mined to a minor extent in the 

early years following development of the Revenue Tunnel and it has been explored by Ranchers, 

Sunshine and Star over a length of approximately 3,800 ft and a down dip extension of 

approximately 550 ft. The vein zone has been mapped over 16,000 ft at surface. The historical 

stoping is not in the resource area. Like the Virginius, the Yellow Rose Vein dips steeply to the 

southwest and consists of several anastomosing veins within a broader structural zone. The 

mineralogy of the Yellow Rose is similar to the Virginius (Table 7.2.6.1) but in general it is a wider 

vein averaging approximately 3 ft. The widest vein intercept sampled on this vein is approximately 

10 ft with the smallest intercept at 0.1 ft. The Yellow Rose is considered to be a lower grade target 

than Virginius. Unlike the Virginius, the Yellow Rose does not follow a dike. 

The Yellow Rose Vein has been drilled from the surface and from underground with 125 drillholes. 

Drill intersections and underground channel sampling results now constitute the data base on which 

the estimated resources are based. Star has recently completed stope development work, which has 

also been sampled. These samples are included in the resource database.

7.2.8 Other Important Veins within the Project Area 

The following veins are controlled by the Company, but have not been systematically explored at this 

time.  

Cumberland Vein System 

The Cumberland-Atlas vein system is a major vein system that is sub-parallel to the Virginius and 

located about midway between the Virginius and the Revenue Portal, east of Yellow Rose. The old 

Atlas crosscut tunnel, with a portal elevation of 11,225 ft, was the daylight point for production by old-

timers on the Atlas claim. Mined material was transported downhill to the north by means of an aerial 

tram and treated at the Atlas mill. After 1893, when the Atlas Vein was exposed along the Revenue 

Tunnel, smaller scale exploration and mining were conducted on the northern extension of the Atlas 

Vein, along the Cumberland Vein. Available historical sample maps and reports mention several 

attempts to explore and work the vein system but a systematic report of the history of the Tunnel 

Level mining has not been found. The Cumberland Vein strikes N48-55°W, similar to the Virginius 

but in contrast with the Virginius vein, dips steeply to the NE. 

Wheel of Fortune Vein System 

The Wheel of Fortune Vein has a strike direction approximately perpendicular to the general 

northwest-trending veins of the Sneffels District. Its northeasterly strike trend and northwesterly dip is 

covered by as many as ten full patented claims that follow the vein's surface trace from northeast of 

Sneffels Creek to the Smuggler-Union vein system on the San Miguel County side of the drainage 

divide, a distance of over two miles. Despite its long extent there has been little production from the 

vein.  

Though the structure is strong and persistent, at the Revenue Tunnel Level it appears that this may 

be too deep to host economic material of significant width. The Wheel of Fortune structure could 

contain mineralized shoots at higher elevations along its strike length, and it represents an important 

target. A surface mapping and sampling program, following the surface trace of the vein, is 

warranted, to explore for anomalous segments, which could be subsequently drilled.  

Torpedo Vein System 

The Torpedo Mine is located north of and just across the valley from the Revenue Mine portal. The 

mine explores a consistent northwest trending quartz fluorite vein that dips at 60⁰ to 80o to the SW. 

From the mine portal to the first major two-compartment raise is a distance of approximately 680 ft, 

which includes the initial 80 ft of crosscut to reach the vein near the portal. Except for a few points 

along the 600 ft of exposed vein, there has been no significant stoping of the vein. The drift is 

timbered at several places for support. Locally, there is abundant clay in the wall rock and sticky clay 

seams are common within and marginal to the vein. Beyond the caved raise at 680 ft, the main drift 

continues for another 450 ft to a second caved raise where waist-deep water backed up. No stopes 

exist along the 450 ft of exposed vein between the two caved raises.  

The Torpedo Vein consists dominantly of banded epithermal quartz but is unusual for its abundant 

green to white fluorite and low sulfide content. Base metal sulfides were not observed in the vein and 

pyrite makes up a small percentage (1% to 3%) of the vein material. The vein ranges from 1 to +10 ft 

wide, averaging approximately 3 to 4 ft in width, and contains about 10% to 20% late-phase fluorite. 

Vein walls are moderately clay altered pyrite-bearing San Juan Formation but locally the walls

consist of aphanitic mafic dike material that is also pyritic and clay altered. These vein-parallel dikes 

are not obvious on the surface but are persistent underground. 

A limited number of samples collected across the Torpedo Vein during Star's assessment of the 

underground workings, one returned a result of 0.455 oz/t Au over a width of 4.4 ft. SRK has not 

reviewed or confirmed these results. This was the back-most sample taken in the main drift, across a 

short crosscut exposing the main vein. For the length of the vein exposed in the accessible 

underground workings, the vein is dominantly quartz and fluorite with some carbonate. Sulfide 

minerals are virtually absent. The Torpedo vein is currently and exploration target for the Company.

8 Deposit Type 

8.1 Mineral Deposit 
The Revenue Mine vein deposits and the several associated veins within the mine are classified as 

volcanic-hosted epithermal base and precious metal vein type deposits. These deposits are 

sometimes referred to as intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposits typically characterized as high 

in silver and gold with or without base metals, associated with andesite volcanism and structurally 

controlled. The mineralogy found at the Project is consistent with this type of mineralization and 

includes galena, sphalerite, tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, marcasite as well as 

ferroan rhodonite, calcian-ferroan rhodocrosite, quartz and chlorite. At Virginius, chalcedonic quartz 

and cockscomb textures have been observed and late euhedral calcite is found in places. Fluid 

inclusion studies suggest that boiling did not occur in the system. However, the presence of breccia 

in places indicates that at least some boiling occurred (Sunshine, 2001; Coxe, 1985). 

SRK is of the opinion that the Company is applying an appropriate deposit model to the Project for 

use in exploration.

9 Exploration  
The Company has just recently acquired the Project. All exploration and drilling activity supporting 

the resource estimate were completed by Star.  

9.1 Star Mine Operations Exploration Activity 
Since 2011, Star's principal exploration effort has been a combination of surface and underground 

core drilling in the Virginius, Terrible, Wheel of Fortune and Yellow Rose veins and exploration and 

development drifting in the Yellow Rose Vein. Star has also collected exploration samples from 

outcropping veins, systematically sampled mine dumps and collected channel samples in the Yellow 

Rose from underground. Star's drilling is discussed in Section 10.  

9.2 Survey work 
In 2013 Star contracted PhotoSat to acquire Pleiades Satellite 50 centimeters (cm) (20 inches) high 

resolution imagery covering almost 40 square miles including and surrounding the Project area. 

Based on this imagery, PhotoSat produced topographic data with elevation contours down to 2.5 ft 

and delivered the imagery and contours in the projects local coordinate system to facilitate 

integration with the existing digital data and ease of use by Revenue Mine staff. 

Star contracted Merritt LS LLC (Merritt) in Grand Junction to conduct surface and underground 

surveying. Merritt has checked and confirmed historical underground work as well as developed the 

surface control used for the satellite imagery acquisition and for surveying Star's surface drilling. 

Merritt also surveyed underground drillhole collars and verified any pre-Star drill collars that could be 

located on surface and in the underground. The Project now has sub-meter accuracy control for its 

major surface and underground infrastructure. 

9.3 Previous Exploration and Channel Sampling 
Prior to Star the available exploration records started with Camp Bird's in 1966 and continued with 

Rancher's and then Sunshine's work on the Project. Table 9.3.1 shows exploration work completed 

during the period of 1966 to 2001 in the Project area. The number of drillholes reflects all drillholes 

drilled at the Project and includes targets outside the Yellow Rose, Virginius and Terrible veins. Not 

all of the drillholes were used during resource estimation. 

Table 9.3.1: Exploration Work Completed between 1966 and 2001 

Historical Sampling 1966 to 2001 # of Completed Work 
Surface Exploration Samples 9

The channel sampling programs typically focused on particular sections of various veins. Samples 

were collected on 6 to 10 ft centers along the vein with samples taken across the vein width and 

typically in the range of 0.5 to 2 ft. Samples were collected using a hammer and chisel and were a

continuous, chip channel sample. The samples were collected to be as continuous a possible using 

the available equipment.  

Camp Bird, Ranchers and Sunshine were successful underground mining companies and the work 

completed by these companies was industry standard for the time period when the work was 

completed.  

9.4 Ranchers F9 Test Stope 
Ranchers first drilled, then stoped and systematically channel sampled a section of the Virginius 

footwall vein identified as the F9 Test Stope. This stope was developed between the 210 Level and 

the Revenue Level. However, it is thought that only the swell was pulled from the stope and no test 

milling was completed. In the area around and including the F9 Test Stope, Ranchers reported good 

correlation between drillholes and channel samples. No recent work by Star has been completed to 

confirm this correlation.  

9.5 Star Exploration and Channel Sampling 
Star's exploration efforts began in 2012 and continued through 2013 and included surface and 

underground sampling as well as surface and underground drilling. Star has completed the 

exploration work shown in Table 9.5.1. 

Table 9.5.1: Star Exploration Work

Underground Channel Samples 0 201

Underground Core Holes 33 0 
Source: Star, 2013 

 

Star used the same channel sampling techniques as Ranchers. The channel sampling programs 

were completed on 6 to 10 ft centers along the vein with samples taken across the vein width. 

Samples were collected using a hammer and chisel and were a continuous, chip channel sample. 

The samples were collected to be as continuous a possible using the available equipment. 

9.6 Star Atlas Tailings and Virginius Mine Dump Sampling 
Star has investigated the possibility of processing material from the Atlas Tailings and Virginius mine 

dump. As part of this, Star sampled the Atlas historic tailings, which are located northwest of the 

Revenue Portal. Star collected 269 samples on a nominal grid of 35 ft x 35 ft. The Virginius mine 

dump located at the 3-Level in Governor Basin was sampled on a 5 ft x 25 ft grid by digging 1 ft deep 

pits. There were 542 samples collected from this site. Preliminary results indicated that there is the 

possibility of processing the Atlas tails and Virginius dump material. This material would be easy to 

recover and move to the Star mill. Additional evaluation is required for both targets.

9.7 Significant Results and Interpretation 
SRK is of the opinion that the work completed to date is industry practice and appropriate for the 

Project at this stage. SRK recommends that any additional channel sampling be conducted using 

careful documentation and supervision with current industry standard QA/QC sampling.

10 Drilling 
Between 2012 and 2013, Star drilled 101 surface and underground drill holes on the RV property. 

This drilling was a combination of infill, offset and exploration drilling. The logistics of additional 

drilling from the surface are challenging due to topography and the geometry of the veins. Easily 

available locations to collar strategic holes underground are limited. As old workings are reopened 

and new workings are developed, additional underground drill stations can be used to drill the veins 

at depth.  

10.1 Type and Extent 
Prior to 1966, the Revenue Mine was explored and developed by conventional underground drifting 

and shaft sinking. Given the continuity along strike and dip of the mineralization, this technique was 

cost effective for the earlier operators. There are no records of these early operators having 

completed any drilling on the Project. 

The first modern exploration and development drilling occurred in 1966 when Federal Resources, 

explored the Project as a way to expand operations at the Camp Bird Mine. The Camp Bird Mine is a 

gold mine while the Project is a past silver producer. Camp Bird reopened some of the workings on 

the Virginius vein below the Revenue Tunnel level and drilled seven core holes from the 350 Level 

totaling 1,140 ft of AQ core with a diameter of 1.062 inches. In 1968, Federal Resources expanded 

their efforts to include surface exploration and drilled six NX sized core holes (2.155 inch diameter) 

on the Monongahela claim to explore the northern extension of the Virginius Vein. This surface 

drilling totaled 5,255 ft. 

In 1980, Ranchers acquired control of the property. Ranchers' work included both surface and 

underground drilling, targeting the Virginius, Terrible and Yellow Rose Veins and other veins in the 

claim block, including the Banner-Governor and Highland Chief. Ranchers drilled a total of 84,729 ft 

of core including 12,967 ft from the surface and 71,762 ft from underground.  

In 1994, Sunshine took control of the Project and mapped most of the accessible workings off the 

Revenue Level. Sunshine drilled 6,567 ft of NX core to explore several surface targets including the 

Yellow Rose, Wheel of Fortune, Mikado, Silver Queen and Terrible veins. 

Star purchased the Project in 2011 and initiated a drilling program in 2012. Star's target in 2012 was 

the Yellow Rose vein. The Company drilled NQ core with a diameter of 1.875 inches completing 

9,681 ft of drilling underground and 9,456 ft of drilling at the surface. Star also drilled 8,540 ft of NQ 

core on the surface of the Monongahela claim to explore the northern extension of the Virginius vein. 

Star completed 2,516 ft of underground core drilling to explore the Wheel of Fortune vein at the end 

of 2012.  

In 2013 Star drilled 20 NQ core holes from the surface in Governor Basin to explore the Terrible and 

Virginius veins completing 11,868 ft. 

In total, the combined drilling on the Project since Federal Resources' early efforts totals 139,752 ft 

of core including 85,099 ft from underground and 54,653 ft from the surface. All of the historical core 

was retained in a warehouse on site at the Revenue Tunnel portal. This warehouse was broken into 

and vandalized. Pieces of core were stolen from core boxes and approximately 30% of the core was 

dumped. The core from drilling prior to Star's ownership of the property that was not vandalized is

stored in Star's core facility in Ouray, Colorado. All of the core from Star's 2012 and 2013 drilling is 

also stored at this core facility. Table 10.1.1 summarizes the drilling at the Project. Figures 10.1.1 

and 10.1.2 show the drillholes at the Yellow Rose and Virginius and Terrible, respectively. Not all drill 

data is within the resource area.

Figure 10.1.2 does not show the stoped areas located in the southeast half of the Virginius or the 

stoped areas in the Terrible.  

SRK does not know the drilling contractors used prior to Star's involvement with the Project. Drilling 

completed by Star during 2012 and 2013 was contracted to Core One Drilling Co. based in Delta, 

Colorado. Core One operated two shifts of two men per drill.  

10.2 Procedures 
All Star drillhole collars were surveyed by Merritt. Any historical drillhole collars that could be 

positively identified have been surveyed. Holes that predate 2012 that cannot be located may vary 

from a few feet to 30 ft above or below the surface. These older holes were registered to the 

topography for modeling and resource estimation and showed acceptable correlation with Star data. 

SRK recommends a more focused effort to identify historical holes and check their collar elevations 

and survey locations.

Downhole surveys were completed by the drilling company using a REFLEX EZ SHOT tool provided 

by Core One. This is a magnetic downhole survey instrument. There are trace amounts of magnetite 

in the mineralization at a microscopic level. According to Star, the amount of magnetite present has 

not affected the use of Brunton compasses or other magnetic instruments underground and there 

have been no observed issues with using magnetic downhole survey instruments. The drillholes 

were surveyed at varying intervals along the hole and at the bottom of the hole.  

Drill core was placed into waxed cardboard boxes directly from the core tube at the drill site. A 

wooden run-block was marked with the hole depth in feet and was placed in the core box upon 

completion of each drill run. The core was drilled with 10 ft tools for surface drilling and 5 ft for 

underground drilling. Core recovery was generally very good and 100% core recovery is common. 

The core boxes were covered with a cardboard lid and then transported to the core logging facilities 

in Ouray. Core was typically delivered at the end of each shift, depending on productivity and 

weather conditions. Core was transported from the drill rig to the Revenue Portal by the drilling 

contractor.  

After drilling, underground drillhole collars drilled by Star were surveyed by site personnel and later 

checked by Merritt. Merritt set the surface control points for the Project, surveyed all surface 

drillholes drilled by Star and locatable surface drillholes from previous operators. Merritt also 

surveyed accessible underground workings and drillholes that could be located on the Revenue 

tunnel level.  

10.3 Interpretation and Relevant Results 
Drilling is conducted to intercept the veins as perpendicular as possible. However, given the terrain 

and drilling access very few intercepts are of true thickness. Additional drilling at the central area of 

the Virginius will have to be completed from underground to intercept the vein perpendicular to the 

vein dip.  

10.3.1 Interpretation 

Drillhole collar coordinates from drilling programs prior to Star may vary from a few feet to 30 ft 

above or below the surface. SRK does not know how much northing and easting offset may be 

present. These older holes were registered to the topography for modeling and resource estimation 

and showed acceptable correlation with Star data. SRK recommends a more focused effort to 

identify historical holes and check their collar elevations and survey locations. 

SRK is of the opinion that the Company meets industry best practice in conducting its drilling and 

logging programs. SRK is of the opinion that the results of both the historic and recent drill programs 

are reliable, and suitable for use in resource estimation.

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 

11.1 Historic Sample Security 
Sample security, preparation and analysis by previous operators pre-dated public reporting under 

CIM guidelines. The work conducted by previous operators was done using industry practice of the 

time period. Core was stored at the warehouse at the Revenue Tunnel portal and until Sunshine 

ended involvement with the Project in 2001, was controlled and secure. As discussed in Section 

10.1, the core warehouse at the Revenue Portal was broken into between 2001 and 2011 and 

approximately 30% of the historic core was lost through vandalism. During historic operations, core 

and channel samples would have been moved from the drill site or collection site to the portal area 

and then shipped to the appropriate laboratory. 

11.2 Historic Sampling 
Core drilled by Federal Resources and Sunshine was split in half lengthwise with one half retained 

and one half shipped to the assay laboratory for analysis. The other half of the core was retained at 

the warehouse. SRK does not know precisely how the core was split; however, during this time 

period it was likely a manual splitter.  

11.3 Historic Analytical  
Federal Resources had access to the Camp Bird Mine laboratory located at the Camp Bird Mine. 

Analytical work for any drilling completed between 1960 and 1970 would likely have been analyzed 

in that laboratory. SRK cannot confirm this. The Camp Bird laboratory conducted Fire Assay (FA) for 

precious metals and had the capability of analyzing copper, lead and zinc. SRK does not know the 

detection limits for these analyses at this laboratory. 

Between 1980 and 1984, Ranchers used the following analytical laboratories: 

 Mountain States Research and Development (Mountain States) in Vail Arizona; 
 Root & Norton in Silverton, Colorado; 
 Union Assay Office, Inc. (Union Assay) in Salt Lake City, Utah; and 
 Skyline Labs, Inc. (Skyline) in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.  

These laboratories analyzed precious metals by FA. Root & Norton report that FA was a one assay 

ton charge. None of the other labs distinguish whether FA was by 1 or 2 assay ton. Copper, lead and 

zinc were likely by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). The lower detection limits for FA at 

Skyline and Root & Norton were 0.005 oz/t for gold and 0.01 oz/t for silver. Skyline reported a lower 

detection limit of 0.005% for copper and lead and 0.002% for zinc. Mountain States reported gold 

grades down to 0.001 oz/t and silver down to 0.05 oz/t but SRK is unsure if these are the lower 

detection limits. Neither Root & Norton nor Mountain States indicated what the lower detection limit 

for copper, lead and zinc were on their assay certificates.  

Sunshine explored the Project between 1994 and 2001 and used Skyline for analytical work at the 

Project.

11.4 Star Security Measures 
The core was transported to the Star facility in Ouray by either the contractor or Star personnel. The 

core was then stored in a locked secure facility until it was logged and sampled. After sampling, 

samples were shipped via FedEx or UPS to ALS Global (ALS) in Reno, Nevada. All facilities 

supervision, technical program supervision, and core logging were carried out by employees of Star.  

11.5 Drill Core Processing 
The core logging and storage facility is a large warehouse located in Ouray. The core is stored on 

pallets and on racks. To log the core, each box in a drillhole was laid out in sequence on elevated 

racks in the core logging area of the warehouse. The core was examined for condition, missing core, 

and depth tag errors. Boxes were labeled for photographing with black felt tip pens including the hole 

number, depth, and box number. The core was then washed and photographed.  

11.6 Geotechnical Data  
Significant faults and zones of incompetent core are marked and entered in the log. Star did not 

collected Rock Quality Designation (RQD) or other geotechnical data during its drilling programs.  

11.7 Core Recovery 
Core recovery was recorded for each core run, which was every 5 ft for underground or 10 ft for 

surface holes. Rubble, re-drill, or slough recovered at the top of a core lift that was not in place is not 

counted as recovered core and was discarded. The core recovery data collected by the geologist 

was recorded in the drill log. Recovery is greater than 95% and up to 100%.  

11.8 Detailed Core Logging  
Geologic data was entered on a paper core logging form as the field geologists log the drill core. The 

log sheet that includes drillhole location, bearing, inclination and start and finish date. Other 

information includes core recovery, description of the core and sample from, to and length 

information. Within the logging section, a comprehensive description of lithology, structure, alteration, 

mineralization and veining was made by the field geologists. 

11.9 Sampling Methodology 
Star geologists sampled vein intercepts and alteration associated with the vein. Star did not sample 

barren wall rock. The geologist marked sample intervals on the core where a vein or mineralization 

was visible. The minimum sample interval was defined by the width of the vein. All samples were 

recorded on the drill log. Sample data was subsequently entered into a sample spreadsheet. Sample 

numbers were assigned sequentially from sample tag books provided by Star. Each sample has a 

unique sample number. A wooden block with the sample number was put into the core box at the top 

of each sample to provide a permanent record of the sample. The samples were sawed in half 

lengthwise with one half sent to the lab and the other half kept in the core box representing the 

interval. All samples were cut using a diamond saw. A printed sample tag was placed in the sample 

bag with each sample by core cutting personnel. All sampling was performed by Star personnel 

under the supervision of the chief geologist.

All samples were packaged and shipped from Ouray via FedEx and UPS to ALS in Reno, Nevada, 

generally within five days of sample collection. ALS has ISO 17025:2005 accreditation for individual 

analytical methods and ISO 9001:2008 accreditation for quality management. Individual samples are 

packed in rice bags sealed with duct tape. Samples were organized sequentially, in each rice bag 

with no more than ten samples per bag. Rice bags were labeled with the shipment number, bag 

number and total number of rice bags in the shipment. Each bag also had the sample number range 

included in the bag on a sheet of paper. A laboratory sample submittal form was filled out and 

emailed to the lab. Shipment information was recorded in a sample tracking spread sheet. 

11.10 Core and Sample Storage  
After logging and sampling, the core boxes are stored at Star's field office in Ouray in the warehouse 

or in locked steel cargo containers. After analysis, all sample pulps and rejects were shipped from 

ALS in Reno back to Ouray where they are stored in a locked weatherproof building. 

11.11 Sample Analyses  
When samples were received by ALS in Reno, they were opened, sorted and dried prior to 

preparation. All samples were crushed to >70% passing 6 mm. The coarse-crushed material was 

then fine-crushed to 70% passing 2 mm and a Boyd Rotary Splitter was used to split a 1,000 gram 

(g) sample. The 1,000 g split was pulverized to 85% passing 75 micrometer (μm) (0.075 mm). 

The samples were then analyzed by FA with a gravimetric finish for both gold and silver. This is ALS 

method ME-GRA22, which is analysis using a 50 g charge. The analytical range is 5 to 10,000 ppm 

for silver and 0.05 to 1,000 ppm for gold. Silver was also analyzed using Ag-GRA21, which is a 30 g 

charge, FA analysis with gravimetric finish if there was insufficient sample to run using a 50 g 

charge. The upper limit for this analytical method is 100 ppm. Star also had a subsample analyzed 

using a 33 element geochemistry package that includes silver, copper, lead and zinc. This is ALS 

code ME-ICP61 and analysis is by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-

AES) and four acid digestion. Table 11.11.1 lists the elements and detection limits for ALS method 

ME-ICP61. Over limit analytical results for silver, copper, lead and zinc using the geochemistry 

package were re-analyzed using ALS method OG62 for individual elements.

ALS shipped the pulps and rejects back to Star, which are stored at the Company's warehouse in 

Ouray.

11.12 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)  
Historical QA/QC was not systematic and was run to verify certain samples. It is uncertain if some of 

the duplicate samples were FA screen analysis in which case they would not be appropriate for a 

duplicate comparison. A comparison of this historical data showed poor correlation, which could be 

the result of an inappropriate comparison.  

The Star QA/QC program includes Reference Materials (RMs), blanks and duplicate silver analysis. 

Star was advised that it is an acceptable industry practice to monitor the ALS internal preparation 

and pulp duplicates as part of the QA/QC program. Any failures in the ALS duplicate data must be 

reviewed to determine why the failure occurred and rerun if necessary. 

Star does not insert core duplicates. Core duplicates are used to test the variability of a deposit and 

can be used to determine adequacy of sample size during preparation. Because of the previous 

mining and work conducted at the Project, Star is of the opinion that the sample size for preparation 

is well understood. Preparation duplicates from ALS support this. Star could test this by submitting a 

subset of the retained core to verify the variability and sample submission size.  

11.12.1 Reference Materials 

In 2012, Star used RMs from Minerals Exploration & Environmental Geochemistry (MEG), Reno, 

Nevada). The standards were certified using ICP analysis and did not provide consistent results for 

FA analysis. In addition, Standard A averaged 7.68 ppm Ag, which is approximately 0.245 oz/t Ag 

and below the cut-off grade at both Yellow Rose and Virginius. Because of this, it was recommended 

that Standard A be discontinued for the 2013 drilling program. Standard B averaged 292.7 ppm or 

approximately 8.53 oz/t Ag. This is an appropriate analytical range for the deposits but was not 

appropriate for FA since RM certification was completed using ICP and FA is the method used for 

resource estimation. A more useful standard would be certified for the analytical methods used 

during analysis. Standards certified for FA were added to the QA/QC program.  

There were five submissions for Standard A and four submissions for Standard B during 2012. 

Standard A had five analytical results for all analyses except silver FA, which only had four results. 

This may be due to a lack of material. Both standards performed within the expected range for ICP 

analysis of silver. However, for silver FA, all but one of Standard A analyses failed. All of the silver 

FA analyses for Standard B, which is the higher grade standard, performed low and well below the 

expected value for the standard.  

Standard A was not certified for gold and gold was not tracked for this standard. Standard B had one 

high failure for gold with the rest of the analyses performing low and well below the expected value. 

For lead, zinc and copper, Standard B performed within the expected range. Standard A had one 

failure that was high, zinc was very low with marginal failures and copper was in the performance 

range but was also low. It was recommended that RMs be selected that are more representative of 

the mineralization at the Project.  

For the 2013 drilling program, Star purchased additional RMs from MEG, Reno, Nevada. These were 

Standards A, B and C. There were 11 total standard submissions with four each for Standards B and 

C and three for Standard A. Standard A is not certified for gold. Tables 11.12.1.1 to 11.12.1.5 

present the RM performance by metal.

General industry practice is to use the following method for determining RM failures: 

 If one analysis is outside of ±2 standard deviations it is a warning; 
 Two or more consecutive analyses outside of ±2 standard deviations is a failure; and  
 If an analysis is outside ±3 standard deviations it is a failure. 

The ±3 standard deviation threshold should not be more than 10% of the expected value.

This is a limited dataset and more measurements would be required for a representative 

interpretation. The failures that occurred were in the low grade silver RM and in the gold RMs. The 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

silver failure is below the lower cut-off grade for the deposit and is not material to resource 

estimation. SRK notes that use of a RM closer to the lower cut-off grade would be more appropriate 

and is recommended. The gold standards are both in the range of the average grade for gold and 

this RM should be monitored carefully. It may be that the RM is not appropriate for the deposit or 

was not properly certified. If the RM continues to have failures, Star should obtain a different RM for 

gold in this range. The limited data show that the laboratory is providing accurate analysis and the 

with the exception of gold, the RMs are performing within acceptable limits. ALS internal standards 

for gold were acceptable and there were no other control sample failures for gold in the grade range 

of interest. Because of these factors, SRK recommends continuing to monitor the gold standard and 

is accepting the results for gold for resource estimation. All failures must be investigated to 

determine why the failure occurred. This may include reanalysis of the sample.  

SRK recommends continuing to monitor the RMs particularly for gold and if necessary replace the 

gold RM.  

11.12.2 Blanks 

Star used a pulp blank from MEG during both 2012 and 2013. There were no failures in the blank 

submissions. SRK recommends using a preparation blank to monitor preparation for cross 

contamination and discontinuing the use of a pulp blank. A pulp blank does not check for cross 

contamination during sample preparation which is where the majority of cross contamination issues 

occur.  

11.12.3 Duplicates 

Star does not insert duplicates but relies on the pulp and preparation duplicates automatically 

generated by ALS during analysis. This is an acceptable industry practice. Preparation duplicates 

are expected to show reproducibility within ±20% while analytical duplicates are expected to show 

reproducibility within ±10%.  

During 2012, there were 33 pulp duplicates and three preparation duplicates. The majority of the 

duplicates were below the cut-off grade of the deposit and failures within this range are not 

considered material to resource estimation. Four samples were above approximately 2 oz/t Ag and 

ranged up to approximately 4 oz/t Ag. There were no failures in this population. However, these four 

duplicates were higher than the original sample.  

During the 2013 drilling program, there were no preparation duplicate results outside the acceptable 

range for silver; there was one duplicate result outside the acceptable range for gold. There were 

four pulp duplicate results outside the acceptable range for silver and six for gold. These failures 

were all very near the detection limit for analysis and below the grade range of interest. Because of 

this, the failures were not considered material to the resource estimation.  

Star duplicates every silver analysis by requesting the laboratory run silver by both FA and ICP. This 

paired analysis shows reproducibility within ±10% with ICP performing slightly higher overall. SRK 

uses the FA data for resource estimation.  

SRK recommends adding check assays to the QA/QC. Check assays are a second analysis of the 

original pulp sample run by a second laboratory. These samples must be submitted with RMs and 

are analyzed using the same method at the secondary laboratory as used at the primary laboratory.

Star has not submitted core duplicates that would be a test of the variability of the deposit. Typically 

at an operating mine, there is enough information to understand the variability of the deposit. The 

Revenue Mine has been operated in the past. Core duplicates can assist in adjusting the sample 

submission size and crushing and pulverizing requirements for a given deposit. Previously, SRK has 

recommended that Star submit core duplicates to assess the variability of the deposit and sample 

submission size. The preparation duplicates demonstrate acceptable reproducibility and SRK notes 

that there has been no indication that the submitted sample is not representative of the 

mineralization. SRK is of the opinion that core duplicate submissions are not necessary.  

SRK is of the opinion that the QA/QC supports the use of the data for resource estimation. 

11.13 Opinion on Adequacy 
SRK is of the opinion that the sample security, preparation and analytical procedures are appropriate 

for the deposit type and are of industry best practice.

12 Data Verification  

12.1 Procedures 
SRK reviewed 10% of the database of both historical and new data against assay certificates and 

found less than 2% error in the database. Identified errors were corrected in the database.  

Star provided additional copper data for the Yellow Rose area from recently located historical data. 

However, the first pass validation identified greater than 10% error in data entry for the copper 

analytical data. This data was returned to Star for corrections. This data has been omitted from the 

current Yellow Rose resource estimate pending a recheck of this additional copper data.  

12.2 Limitations 
Star has corrected the questions from previous resource estimations. These include obtaining a 

more accurate topography, having drillholes professionally surveyed, maintaining an industry 

acceptable QA/QC program, checking and updating the historical database, establishing better 

control on underground workings and conducting infill drilling at the Yellow Rose. Downhole survey 

data was reviewed by Star and corrected in the database. There are no significant limitations to the 

data.  

12.3 Opinion on Data Adequacy 
SRK is of the opinion that the available data is adequate for resource estimation.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing  

13.1 Testing and Procedures 
In 1984, Ranchers sampled and tested several different bulk samples from the Virginius and the 

Yellow Rose Veins. Test work used a flotation process very similar to the flow sheet that was utilized 

at the Camp Bird Mill. The samples were crushed and ground then floated in a rougher-cleaner 

circuit. The bulk concentrate produced from the test work contained copper, lead, zinc, silver and 

gold. The test work was performed by Hazen Research Inc. located in Golden, Colorado and was 

reported in "Metallurgical Studies, Revenue-Virginius 210 Level and Yellow Rose Ores, September 

26, 1984" (Hazen, 1984). 

In 2012, two bulk samples were collected: one from the Yellow Rose and one from the Virginius. The 

test work procedure again utilized crushing, grinding and flotation to produce a bulk concentrate. The 

material was ground to 150 mesh (106 microns) and 200 mesh (74 microns) and tested to see if 

increased recovery could be realized with a finer grind. The test work was performed by Resource 

Development Inc. (RDI) located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado and reported in "Silverstar Progress 

Report, October 18, 2012" (RDI, 2012). 

In 2012, test samples were also sent to Knelson Concentrators located in Langley, British Columbia 

to determine if sufficient recovery could be achieved using modern gravity separation methods and 

reported in "Gravity Test Work Report, Silver Star Resources, Revenue-Virginius, September 17, 

2012" (Knelson, 2012). 

Filtration test work for the tailings was performed by Pocock Industrial, Inc. (Pocock) located in Salt 

Lake City, Utah from samples processed during the test work completed in 2012 and results are 

contained in the report "Results of Direct Pressure Filtration Tests on Silver Star Tailings", dated 

August 27, 2012 by Pocock (Pocock, 2012). 

13.1.1 Sample Representativeness 

Samples taken in 1983 and 2012 were bulk samples taken from a particular section of the vein 

complex. The samples represent only that portion of the vein and are not representative of the entire 

deposit or vein structure. However, the samples are indicative of the appropriateness of process to 

be used and recoveries that may be expected. It is recommended that a series of samples be taken 

from drill core along the length of the vein systems and be tested for metal recovery. 

13.2 Relevant Results 
Bulk samples processed in 1983 and 2012 yielded good silver recoveries using a conventional 

configuration for a crushing, grinding and flotation circuit.  

Standard Bond ball mill grind tests varied as to the location of the sample. A work index of 18.4 hp/t 

(15 kWh/t) was selected for mill sizing, which is conservative for the different materials tested.  

Test work recovery increased several percent with a coarser grind of 150 mesh versus a grind of 

200 mesh. 

Locked cycle flotation tests improved gold recovery by 12% but had no discernible effect on silver 

recovery.

Attempts to use gravity to concentrate and recover gold yielded a low grade gold concentrate, which 

did not warrant further investigation. The use of gravity concentration as a supplemental process to 

increase gold recovery is recommended since native gold was identified in some of the samples. 

Conventional filter design was found to be appropriate for the tailings material. 

13.3 Recovery Estimate Assumptions 
Tables 13.3.1 and 13.3.2 summarize the recoveries achieved in the test work associated with this 

report.

Table 13.3.1 shows that silver recovery varies from 86.9% to 97.0% based on the test work data 

available for the two deposits. Virginius silver recovery is estimated at 95% based on recent test 

work by RDI. The Yellow Rose sample obtained in 2012 was of a much lower grade (2.5 oz/t Ag 

compared to an average grade of approximately 10 oz/t Ag average for the measured resource), 

which should result in a lower recovery. Hence, silver recovery for Yellow Rose is estimated at 95% 

based on historical test work performed by Ranchers. Additional testing on composite samples from 

drill core is recommended to confirm silver recovery. 

Table 13.3.1 shows that gold recovery varies from 81.0% to 96.6% for the two vein systems. Gold 

recovery for Yellow Rose is estimated at 90% based on historical test work performed by Ranchers. 

Gold recovery for the Virginius material is also estimated at 90% based on historical test work and a 

perceived 12% improvement in gold recovery using locked cycle flotation tests from recent test work. 

Additional testing on composite samples from drill core is recommended to confirm gold recovery. 

Table 13.3.2 shows the lead, zinc and copper recoveries for the test work previously discussed. 

Lead recovery varied from 94.5% to 97.4%. A value of 90% lead recovery was estimated for this 

report.

Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 66 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

Copper recovery varied from 87.2% to 94.8%. A value of 80% copper recovery was estimated for 

this report. 

Zinc recovery varied from 57.3% to 93.4%. The variation in zinc recoveries in the RDI test work is the 

result of the laboratory focusing on silver recovery and not zinc recovery. A value of 85% zinc 

recovery was estimated for this report. 

13.4 Significant Factors 
Bulk concentrates generated from test work in 1983 and 2012 contained lead, zinc, copper and 

antimony.  

Early test work in 1984 attempted to produce a zinc concentrate for sale and succeeded in one 

series of tests to produce one that graded 59% zinc. Test work in 2012 failed to produce a zinc 

concentrate that graded higher than 25% zinc. Sale of zinc concentrates usually requires a zinc 

concentrate value higher than 60% in order to achieve an undiscounted payout rate.  

The 2012 test work produced a lead/silver concentrate from the Yellow Rose sample where zinc 

values ranged from 10% to 24%. Smelter penalties may be assessed for zinc concentrations higher 

than 5%. The 2012 Virginius sample produced a bulk concentrate that ranged from 1.5% to 5% zinc, 

which would probably not incur a penalty. 

The variation of zinc in the deposit and subsequent variation of zinc in the concentrate will determine 

if any penalty might be associated with the product. As stated previously, the plant is capable of 

producing a lead/zinc/silver concentrate or producing a separate lead/silver concentrate and a zinc 

concentrate.  

The bulk concentrates from 2012 contained 0.8% to 1.2% antimony. Smelter penalties for antimony 

may be assessed depending on the smelter and are generally assessed at US$2.50/t of concentrate 

for each 0.1% above 0.25%. No antimony penalty is being assessed against the Revenue Mine 

concentrates pursuant to the Teck contract.

14 Mineral Resource Estimate  
Dorinda Bair is the Qualified Person (QP) responsible for the resource estimation methodology and 

the resource statement.  

Prior to 2012, resource and reserve estimates at the Project were conducted using polygonal 

methods and later computer-based methods. Studies completed by Sunshine made use of the 

Techbase software package (TECHBASE®). In 2012 and 2013, SRK conducted resource 

estimations using Vulcan software (Maptek Vulcan™). 

14.1 Topography 
In 2013, Star acquired a topographic survey with 2.5 ft contours from satellite data. This survey 

covers the entire Project area, extending into Yankee Boy and Imogene Basins. The topography files 

were clipped to the area over each deposit.  

Drillhole collars from Star's 2012 and 2013 drilling programs were within ±2 to 5 ft of the topography 

surface. However, some historic drillholes were up to ±30 ft from the topographic surface. All surface 

drillholes were registered to the topography for modeling and estimation purposes. Once the historic 

drillholes were registered to the topography, the intercepts reconciled with nearby drilling and could 

be correlated within the vein. SRK recommends that Star resurvey the collars of the historic drillholes 

that can be located.  

14.2 Coordinate System 
The Project is in a local coordinate grid system in feet. All claims are located in both the local 

coordinate grid system and Colorado State Plane South, NAD 27 ft (State Plane).  

14.3 Drillhole Database and Channel Sample Database 
The bulk of drilling and channel sampling was completed prior to 1996 on the Virginius vein. At 

Yellow Rose Vein, approximately 50% of the drilling is from 2012 or later and all but three of the 

channel samples were collected by Star. Core recoveries observed in the Star drilling programs is 

+95%.  

14.3.1 Yellow Rose 

The drillhole database for the Yellow Rose contains both historic and modern data. There are 68 

drillholes and 10 channel samples in the resource database collected prior to 1996. Of the historic 

drillholes, 46 were drilled from surface and 22 were drilled from underground. The 1996 data 

includes 10 channel samples; four collected at surface and six from underground. The core size 

during this period was NX with a diameter of 2.98 inches and AQ and AW both with diameters of 

1.89 inches. 

In 2012, Star conducted an exploration drilling program adding 56 drillholes to the database. Six of 

these were drilled from underground into the Wheel of Fortune area, four were drilled into the Silver 

Queen target area (two from underground and two from surface), and the remaining 46 drillholes 

were drilled into the Yellow Rose. Of these 46 drillholes, 20 were drilled from surface and 26 were 

drilled from underground.

Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 68 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

During 2013, Star added nine surface drillholes and 151 channel samples to the Yellow Rose area. 

The surface drillholes were drilled as infill in widely spaced drilling. Of the 151 channel samples 

collected during 2013, 114 were collected from the main Yellow Rose vein structure. These were 

collected from existing drifts and a stope development area. The other 37 samples were collected 

from adjacent structures and splays off the main Yellow Rose vein.  

Because of proximity to the Yellow Rose vein, drillholes targeting the Silver Queen and Wheel of 

Fortune drillholes have been included in the block model for the Yellow Rose. All 2012 and 2013 

drilling was completed using NQ tools. Table 14.3.1.1 presents the drilling breakdown and 

Table 14.3.1.2 presents the channel sampling breakdown.

14.3.2 Virginius and Terrible 

Like the Yellow Rose, the Virginius and Terrible is a combination historic and modern data as well as 

channel and drillhole data. The core size prior to 1996 was AQ. Star drilling drilled the Virginius with 

NQ tools (Tables 14.3.2.1 and 14.3.2.2).

14.4 Geologic Model 
Both the Yellow Rose and Virginius veins were modeled using Aranz' Leapfrog Geo™. Previously 

the model had been constructed by wireframing in Maptek Vulcan® and these wireframes were used 

as a starting point for modeling in Leapfrog Geo™.  

Before 2013, Star had anticipated a 6-ft mining width based on the work by Sunshine. It is also noted 

that Sunshine used a numerical code (-999 or -998) to identify vein that was not sampled. These 

data have been used as reference for vein location in the current modeling, but priority has been 

given to sampled vein intervals.  

Star has since changed the minimum mining width to 3 ft based on a shrinkage stoping mining 

method. At the client's request, SRK constructed the current vein models based on a minimum 3 ft 

vein width.  

SRK notes that there is evidence that dikes and/or faults disrupt and offset the Virginius and the 

Yellow Rose vein structures near the Wheel of Fortune and near the intersection between the 

Virginius and the Terrible Vein causing difficulty in interpretation. SRK did not model faulting or dikes 

and recommends that mapped faults and dikes be added to the geological model in these areas. The 

resource classification in these areas is inferred.  

The block models were coded as either intact or mined, with mined areas representing known 

workings and stopes. Only intact blocks were reported as part of the resource. 

Yellow Rose was modeled as ten individual veins. These included the Yellow Rose main vein, splays 

off the main vein, structures parallel to the main vein and those north and east of the intersection 

with the Wheel of Fortune vein. Table 14.4.1 lists the veins and their modeling codes for Yellow Rose 

and the wireframes are shown if Figure 14.4.1. The Yellow Rose main vein wireframe measures 

approximate 3,800 ft along strike and 550 ft down dip.

Figure 14.4.1: Yellow Rose Wireframes 

 

The Virginius was modeled as five individual veins. The Terrible vein was included in the Virginius 

block model since it intersects the northern end of this vein structure. The veins modeled for the 

Virginius and Terrible are listed with their codes in Table 14.4.2 and shown in Figure 14.4.2. The 

Virginius veins have been modeled for approximately 6,100 ft along strike and 1,100 ft down dip. The 

Terrible has been modeled for approximately 2,900 ft along strike and 1,100 ft down dip. The 

Virginius veins and the Terrible vein have been mined historically. SRK does not have information on 

the location of the stopes in the Terrible vein, but the stoping was east of the current drilling.

14.5 Sample Database 
In the sample database, half the lowest detection limit identified in the database was used to denote 

sampled intervals that were below the detection limit. Unsampled intervals within the veins were set 

to a value of 0. The following is a list of the values used for samples below the detection limit for both 

the Yellow Rose and the Virginius. 

 Ag = 0.005 oz/t; 
 Au = 0.0005 oz/t; 
 Cu = 0.0025 %; 
 Pb = 0.0025 %; and

14.6 Assay Capping and Compositing 
The raw assay data for all metals was assessed by sample type for the presence of high-grade 

outlier values that could impact grade estimation. Capping was reviewed for both the Yellow Rose 

and the Virginius independently. After review of log probability plots, it was decided to cap all metals 

in both deposits. Table 14.6.1 lists capping for each deposit.

Capping gold at Yellow Rose removes seven samples ranging from 0.305 to 6.213 oz/t. It was 

shown that these samples were having a strong effect on the overall estimation that was not 

necessarily representative of the gold in the deposit. Capping these samples removes the area 

northeast of the Wheel of Fortune intercept, which has the greatest variation in gold grades. This 

area exhibits nugget affect, has very few samples and requires more exploration prior to use in 

resource estimation.  

14.7 Compositing 
Approximately 80% of the samples on the Yellow Rose are 3 ft or less with 60% exactly 2 ft. SRK 

composited the samples at 3 ft lengths to standardize the length for resource estimation for Yellow 

Rose. The composites were broken against the vein solids generated by SRK.

On the Virginius, approximately 85% of the samples are 2 ft or less and 60% are approximately 1 ft. 

On the Virginius, SRK composited the samples at 2 ft lengths and the composites were broken 

against the vein solids. Tables 14.7.1 and 14.7.2 present the statistics for capped and uncapped 

composites for the Yellow Rose and the Virginius, respectively.

14.8 Density 
Prior to 2013, a tonnage factor of 12 ft3/t had been used based on documentation by Mayor (1971) 

for the Idarado Mine. On SRK's recommendation, Star conducted density measurements on material 

from both the Yellow Rose and the Virginius to determine the tonnage factors for the two vein 

systems. The measurements were completed at the core shed by volume displacement method on 

waxed core.  

A total of 27 measurements were made on Yellow Rose core samples; 17 in waste and 10 in 

mineralization. The average for all samples is 10.91 ft3/t. Mineralization averaged 10.70 ft3/t and 

waste averaged 11.04 ft3/t. SRK used 10.70 ft3/t and 11.04 ft3/t for mineralization and waste, 

respectively.  

A total of six measurements were made on core from the Virginius from the 2013 drilling program. 

Since there were so few samples, SRK averaged these six samples and used 10.28 ft3/t for both 

mineralization and waste.  

SRK notes that the number of density measurements is small at Virginius. SRK recommends 

collecting more measurements throughout the Virginius collecting a representative population from 

both mineralization and waste material. SRK also recommends taking more measurements from the

Yellow Rose. In addition, SRK recommends verifying the density measurements through a 

commercial laboratory such as ALS for both vein systems.  

14.9 Variogram Analysis and Modeling 
SRK conducted variogram analysis for the Yellow Rose using the 3 ft, capped composite dataset. 

SRK was unable to produce meaningful and interpretable directional variograms. SRK was able to 

produce an omni-directional variogram that was used to determine estimation searches and resource 

classification and is presented in Figure 14.9.1. Because of the small number of veins and limited 

amount of samples in some veins, SRK did not attempt variography on individual veins.  

 

Figure 14.9.1: Yellow Rose Omni-directional Variogram for Ag using 3 ft Composite Data 

 

New drilling in the Virginius was completed using a limited number of drillholes at the northeast end 

of the system. The majority of this drilling was focused primarily on the Terrible vein. This area is 

isolated from the rest of the sampling and should be modeled separately. Unfortunately, the small 

dataset does not lend itself to variogram analysis. Variography conducted in 2012 on the Virginius 

failed to produce useable variograms.  

14.10 Block Model Construction 
A sub-celled block model was constructed in Vulcan for the Yellow Rose. The block model was 

rotated 128⁰ around the z-axis to better align the block edges with the orientation of the 

mineralization. Sub-celling was limited to within the Yellow Rose Veins. The model limits and extents 

are provided in Table 14.10.1.

Both block models contain the following variables with exception that Cu is not included in the Yellow 

Rose block model: 

 Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, Zn estimated by IDW with a spatial limitation on the outliers; 
 Agnn, Aunn, Cunn, Pbnn, Znnn estimated by nearest neighbor approach; 
 Number of composites used per block; 
 Number of drillholes used per block; 
 Density; 
 Variable for veins; 
 Class; 
 Value of metals based on recovery; and 
 A mined out variable; and topography.  

The bock model was sub-blocked at and within the veins, at topography and at stopes in the 

Virginius and workings at the Yellow Rose. 

14.11 Estimation Methodology 
At Yellow Rose, the resource was estimated in four passes using ID2. Each vein was estimated 

separately using the search distances, minimum and maximum composites, and samples per 

drillhole listed in Table 14.11.1. Search orientations are listed in Table 14.11.2. The estimation was 

performed for each wireframe separately using only composites within each specific wireframe. The 

search distance for the major and semi-major distance was based on the omni-directional variogram 

and channel sampling and drillhole spacing. The first pass was at 50 ft to capture the more closely 

spaced channel samples. The second pass is 125 ft which is approximately 80% of the sill. The 

fourth pass at 375 ft is 100% of the sill. The minor search distance was set to 50 ft to accommodate 

local changes in dip of the wireframe.

The Virginius was also estimated in four passes using ID2. Each vein was estimated separately 

using the searches distances, minimum and maximum composites, and samples per drillhole listed 

in Table 14.11.3. Search orientations are listed in Table 14.11.4. Search distances were based on

A nearest neighbor (NN) estimation run was also run for comparison to the estimated grades. The 

results are discussed in Section 14.12.3.

14.12 Model Validation 
Various measures have been implemented to validate the resultant resource block model. These 

measures include the following: 

 Comparison of drillhole composites with resource block grade estimates from all zones 
visually both in plan and section; 

 Statistical comparisons between block and composite data using histogram and cumulative 
distribution analysis;  

 Generation of a comparative NN model; and 
 Constructing swath plots along strike and elevation. 

14.12.1 Visual Inspection 

Visual comparisons between the block grades and the underlying composite grades in plan and 

section show close agreement and indicates that the estimation was good. Example cross sections 

for Yellow Rose are provided in Figures 14.12.1.1 for Yellow Rose. Example cross sections for the 

Virginius showing block and composite silver grades are presented in Figures 14.12.1.2.

14.12.2 Block-Composite Statistical Comparison 

SRK also conducted statistical comparisons between the IDW block contained within the vein solids 

for both the Yellow Rose and the Virginius with the underlying composite grades for each block 

model. For both block models, average block model grades are lower than composite grades 

indicating that the estimate is not overestimating grades globally. Table 14.12.2.1 shows the general 

statistics of blocks and composites in both the Yellow Rose and the Virginius for silver.

14.12.3 Comparison of Interpolation Methods 

For comparative purposes, grades were estimated using NN interpolation methods. The results of 

the NN model are compared to the IDW model at a 0 oz/t silver cut-off grade for the Project in Tables 

14.12.3.1 and 14.12.3.2 for the Yellow Rose and the Virginius, respectively. SRK conducted this 

comparison for all estimation passes in the Yellow Rose and the Virginius. The tables show the 

overall average.  

Table 14.12.3.1: Comparison of IDW and NN Tonnage and Grade at a 0 oz/t Silver Cut-off – All 
Estimation Passes at Yellow Rose 

 

Note: Comparison is made a cut-off of 0, for all estimation passes

NN 3,710 9.61 
Relative Percent Difference (IDW - NN)/IDW  -12 

Note: Comparison is made at a cut-off of 0, for all estimation passes 

 

The comparison of the interpolation methods show the NN model to be higher than the IDW model in 

both cases as expected. There is a larger variation at Virginius with the IDW method producing an 

average grade 12% less than the NN method. This is interpreted as the result of the influence of the 

channel samples, the distribution of drillholes and the influence of blocks near the edges of the 

wireframes.  

14.12.4 Swath Plots 

Figures 14.12.4.1 and 14.12.4.2 are swath plots (drift analysis) for the Yellow Rose along an azimuth 

of 308 and by elevation, respectively. The Virginius is shown in Figures 14.12.4.3 and 14.12.4.4 for 

azimuth 322 and elevation, respectively. In the Yellow Rose, there is a large spike in gold in the 

block model at approximately section 8 in the main vein. There are four composites, two from 

drillholes and two from channel samples with raw assay grades ranging from 0.06 to 0.305 oz/t Au 

that are influencing the block estimation in this area. The Virginius plots include the Terrible, which 

represents the northeast end and highest elevations of the swath plots. 

The plots show smoothing in the estimated blocks, but reasonable agreement overall. The strongest 

variations tend to be near the ends of the veins. The elevation plots for Virginius and Terrible show 

an area where block grades are greater than composite grade. This is the break between the 

Virginius and Terrible zones in the bock model. This is an indication that more drilling is required 

between these two areas.

14.13  Resource Classification 
Since 2013, Star has acquired a detailed topographic survey, determined tonnage factors based on 

material from the Project area, obtained detailed surveys of drilling completed since 2012, conducted 

verification and infill drilling and collected channel samples in the underground. Channel sampling 

has specifically been collected from the Yellow Rose vein along workings and in stope development. 

On the Yellow Rose, the veins have been sampled in the underground, at surface and in drilling. The 

main vein has been mapped over 16,000 ft. On the Virginius a bulk sample was collected from the 

Main vein for metallurgical recovery work. In addition better control has been established on 

underground workings. Questions regarding downhole survey locations have been answered by 

investigating the historic drill logs and correcting data entry errors. Because of these factors, SRK 

has increased the confidence in the resource classification for the deposit.  

The Resources at the Project have been classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred at Yellow 

Rose and as Indicated and Inferred for the Virginius. The classification is based on standards as 

defined by the "CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves", prepared 

by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by CIM Council on 

December 17, 2010.  

Classification of the resources reflects the relative confidence of the grade estimates. The 

classification parameters are defined by the search radius, number of composites and number of 

drillholes in the estimation. The classification criteria are intended to encompass zones of reasonably 

continuous mineralization. The Virginius has been extensively sampled in workings and in stope 

development by Sunshine and Ranchers but the limited historic QA/QC data supporting this 

sampling effort limits the classification to Indicated.  

Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

Mineral resource estimates do not account for mineability, selectivity, mining loss and dilution. These 

mineral resource estimates include Inferred mineral resources that are normally considered too 

speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to 

be categorized as mineral reserves. There is also no certainty that inferred mineral resources will be 

converted to Measured and Indicated categories through further drilling, or into mineral reserves, 

once economic considerations are applied. 

14.13.1 Yellow Rose Classification 

Measured Mineral Resources at Yellow Rose are those blocks having a minimum of three samples 

and three drillholes or channels which are within an anisotropic search of 125 ft x 125 ft x 50 ft within 

the Yellow Rose Main Vein. This classification takes into consideration that there has been sampling 

in workings around the Yellow Rose Main vein in addition to drilling.  

Indicated Mineral Resources at Yellow Rose are those blocks having a minimum of three samples 

and three drillholes or channels which are within an anisotropic search of 250 ft x 250 ft x 50 ft within 

the Yellow Rose Main Vein. 

Inferred Mineral Resources at Yellow Rose are those blocks having a minimum of three samples 

and three drillholes which are a maximum block-composite separation distance within an anisotropic 

search of 375 ft x 375 ft x 50 ft within the Yellow Rose Main Vein and in all other veins with the 

exception of the Silver Queen veins.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

14.13.2 Virginius and Terrible Classification 

Indicated Mineral Resources at Virginius are those blocks having a minimum of three samples an 

anisotropic search of 100 ft x 100 ft x 50 ft within the Virginius Main and Footwall Veins only. These 

are the two veins that have been sampled extensively by Sunshine. . 

Inferred Mineral Resources are those blocks having a minimum three samples within an 

anisotropic search of 200 ft x 200 ft x 50 ft on the Virginius Main, Hangingwall, Footwall, Main splay, 

Main splay2 and Terrible Veins.  

14.14  Mineral Resource Statement 
All results from channel samples and drilling at the Project that are within the wireframes have been 

used in the mineral resource estimate. The resource estimation for both the Yellow Rose and the 

Virginius are reported at a minimum total recovered block metal value using a mining and milling cost 

provided by Star of US$150/t. Tons are short tons. Total recovered block metal is based on the 

following prices and recoveries provided by Star: 

 Ag price of US$20/oz and recovery of 95%; 
 Au price of US$1250/oz and recovery of 90%; 
 Cu price of US$3.15/lb and recovery of 80%; 
 Pb price of US$1/lb and recovery of 90%; and 
 Zn price of US$1/lb and recovery of 85%. 

Copper was not estimated for the Yellow Rose due to validation of the copper database. The data 

was hand entered from historical assay certificates and there were too many data entry errors for 

inclusion at this time. With additional data review and data entry corrections, there is potential to add 

this data to the resource estimate. Tables 14.14.1 and 14.14.2 present the Yellow Rose and 

Virginius Resource statements, respectively.

14.15 Mineral Resource Sensitivity 
In order to assess the sensitivity of the resource to changes in value based on metal content, SRK 

summarized tonnage and grade above cut-off at a series of increasing total recovered block metal 

value cut-offs. The sensitivity analysis is shown in Tables 14.15.1 and 14.15.2 for Yellow Rose and 

Virginius, respectively. It can be observed that the resources are reasonably insensitive to cut-off 

grades based on the silver content. The base case is shown in bold.

14.16 Relevant Factors 
Silver is the metal in the resource estimate. However, zinc has been reported as part of the resource 

estimate. The resource could be impacted if it is determined that a saleable zinc concentrate cannot 

be produced. Fortune and Star have informed SRK that they have a contract in place with the 

smelter in Trail, British Columbia Canada to purchase and process the concentrate produced in the 

mill. SRK has not independently confirmed this. 

The current DRMS-permitted product lines are for silver, gold and zinc and the CDPS-permitted 

product lines are for silver, gold, zinc and lead. The differences in the permits will require resolution, 

but copper is not mentioned in either permit. SRK does not anticipate that there would be an issue 

adjusting the permits to include all metals in the resource estimate.

16 Mining Methods  
The available geotechnical information and historic mining information indicates that shrinkage 

stoping is a suitable method for the deposit. The mine is currently in startup production and 

development with underground mine personnel working two 10 hr shifts/day targeting a production 

rate of 400 t/d. 

Shrinkage mining blocks are approximately 250 ft along strike and 125 ft vertical spacing between 

levels. Sill and dip pillars are left between mining blocks and stopes are left empty as backfill is 

currently not used at the mine. All current mining equipment is pneumatic and there is no diesel 

equipment underground. The veins are accessed from horizontal levels located in or near 

mineralization. Raises connect levels and personnel can be transported between levels using an 

Alimak or by ladders in raises. Lateral development on track levels is conducted using a track 

mounted jumbo. Raise development is completed using conventional raise methods or Alimak raise 

climber. Production mining is achieved by use of stopers and jacklegs. Air slushers are used to 

transport mineralized material from the production faces to the mineralized material passes. A 

system of mineralized material passes is used when required to move material from a production 

area to main collection level with access to mill.  

The mine design process involved using stope optimizer in Vulcan software to determine mine plan 

areas based on a cut-off grade and minimum mining widths. The optimized stopes were then 

grouped into stope panels leaving sill and rib pillars as required. Dilution and recovery were added to 

the designed tonnage to account for unplanned stope dilution and unrecoverable material within the 

stope.   

Access and infrastructure development was designed to support the mining method and sized based 

on mining equipment and production rate requirements. Figure 16.1 shows the general layout of the 

mine and mill.

16.1 Cut-off Grade Calculations 
Net Smelter Return (NSR) is a commonly accepted method of evaluating polymetallic mineralized 

material. NSR is defined as the proceeds from the sale of mineral products after deducting off-site 

processing and distribution costs. NSR is typically expressed on a dollar per ton basis. For this 

project the NSR calculation takes into account revenue for four elements (Zn, Pb, Ag and Au) and 

production of two concentrates (lead concentrate and zinc concentrate).  

Plant recoveries from Tables 13.3.1 and 13.2.2 are used to estimate concentrate production. 

Recovery of metals into a lead or zinc concentrates are extrapolated from previous test work 

completed at Hazen. Gravity recovery is assumed at 2% for both silver and gold and is included in 

the estimated overall recovery.   

Treatment and refining charges are based on current terms contracts. Tables 16.1.1 and 16.1.2 

present the input parameters used to calculate the NSR.

The basis for the mine design work is the resource block model. The NSR was evaluated for each 

block in the 3-D geologic block model. Figures 16.1.1 and 16.1.2 show grade/ton curves for the 

Revenue Virginius area and the Yellow Rose area, respectively.

16.2 Geotechnical Parameters 
No geotechnical studies have been conducted to collect data on rock mass characterization. Ground 

conditions used as the basis for assessing mine design parameters are based on observations made 

during a sit visit to the underground workings. SRK conducted a one-day site visit to the mine on 

May 15, 2014 for the purpose of examining ground conditions. The site visit included observations in 

underground workings that had been rehabbed and the underground mill operations. SRK observed 

ground conditions in portions of the Yellow Rose and Virginius Vein workings as well in the Revenue 

haulage on the way into the workings. The underground crusher chamber and mill chamber were 

also toured as part of the site visit. 

The geology of the mineralized veins is associated with sub-vertical dikes that cut the sub-horizontal 

San Juan Formation. The dikes have been significantly hydrothermally altered in locations and veins 

are generally located in the hangingwall and/or footwall of the dike, or even interior to the dike. The 

hangingwall volcanic rocks can be hydrothermally altered above the hangingwall vein for 2 to 3 ft. 

The characteristics of the altered wall rocks are softer and more fractured than the unaltered 

hangingwall volcanic rocks.  

Several rock units from the San Juan Formation are exposed within the Project area but not all are 

exposed in the underground workings of the mine. Table 7.2.1.1 is a summary of the rock units 

which, within the area of the mine, span a vertical thickness of nearly 3,500 ft. Figure 16.2.1 shows a 

longitudinal section through the Virginius Vein with an illustration of the stratigraphy as it intersects 

the historic mining.

The veins mined historically have consisted of the following veins structures: 

 Yellow Rose Vein (primary); 
 Virginius Vein (primary); 
 Terrible Vein; 
 Wheel of Fortune Vein; 
 Cumberland Vein; and 
 Torpedo Vein.  

The Virginius vein has been mapped at surface over a distance of approximate 4,000 ft and the 

Yellow Rose has been traced 16,000 ft, extending beyond the Star property. Figure 16.2.2 shows a 

plan view section through the Revenue Level indicating the vein locations relative to the historic 

mining. 

 

Figure 16.2.2: Plan View Section through the Revenue Level showing the Vein Locations and 
Historic Mining 

 

In general, the rock mass exposed drifts was quite tight. Fractures were closed and the rock was 

competent. In heavily supported areas (i.e., where bolting spacing was less than 3 ft) the ground 

remains tight and only a few areas had the rock loosened. The evidence of elevated horizontal 

stresses should be examined in greater detail as it might impact ground stability and dilution. 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 97 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

The vein varies in thickness, proximate location to the dikes, and undulates along both strike and dip. 

Rock mass quality was observed to vary from Very Good, Class I rock (RMR> 80) to Fair, Class III 

rock (40 < RMR < 60). Under these anticipated ground conditions, SRK is of the opinion that several 

different mining methods will be required and that flexibility be maintained to change methods in any 

given area of the mine if ground conditions change within the active mining area. 

The block model indicates that the approximate width of mineralization is an average of 3.5 ft wide in 

the Revenue Virginius and 5.5 ft wide in the Yellow Rose. There are areas where vein splay resulting 

in parallel sub-parallel veins with variable spacing between (i.e., 50 to 100 ft waste lens). 

The estimated rock mass conditions for mining areas are summarized in Table 16.2.1.

Underground Design Constraints 

SRK has not conducted a detailed review of optimal mining methods. The PEA relies on historic 

mining methods used in the historic ground conditions.  

Cut-and-Fill Mining – The cut-and-fill mining is a relatively surgical mining method that opens only 

small areas of ground at one time. Its main advantage is that mined openings are more stable and if 

necessary local ground support can be installed in the back and HW. Dilution is relatively easy to 

control with such a surgical method and large variations in vein consistency (i.e., thickness and 

undulations) can be managed. The disadvantages of this method are that productivity can be low, 

costs can be significantly higher, and to make up for this many active mining faces are required. This 

method is an option for the Virginius and Yellow Rose Veins in highly variable mineralized material 

areas. The PEA assumes this method will not be required. 

Resue Method – This method is a modification of the cut-and-fill method, but works well when the 

vein is thinner than the minimum mining equipment width because the waste rock serves as backfill 

as the stope is advanced overhand. It relies on short production drill lengths to maintain stability of 

the adjacent waste rock. It is a lower productivity method than shrinkage stope method but it allows 

greater control of ground conditions and it minimizes dilution when the vein is thinner than the 

minimum mining width. The advantages of this method are that it can be employed in less competent 

ground conditions using small openings, it does not necessarily rely on a distinct discontinuity with 

the HW contact (but it helps), and mineralized material dilution can be minimized. This method has 

been used in historic areas of the mine. With some minor changes this method could become a 

mostly mechanized mining method. The PEA assumes this method will not be required. 

Open Stoping Method – The open stoping method relies heavily on competent hangingwall ground 

conditions to minimize rock fall and dilution. When stope heights get high there can be a safety risk 

from in-stope rockfalls. This can be mitigated by using non-entry remote mechanical mucking. When 

the vein gets thinner than the accuracy of maintaining drilling within the vein, then dilution becomes a 

problem. It is possible to decrease level heights to increase drilling accuracy and keep blast holes

within the mineralized vein. This however leads to lower productivity and higher costs. The 

advantage of this method is that it can be a cost effective method if ground conditions are favorable 

for stope stability. This method is an option for the Virginius and Yellow Rose Veins in wide 

mineralized material areas where the hangingwall is competent. The PEA assumes this method will 

not be required. 

Shrinkage Stope Method – The shrinkage method is effective in medium to steeply dipping 

mineralization (65° to 75°). Longitudinal stopes are overhand mined. The broken mineralized 

material is dropped to the bottom of the stope and drawn from drawpoints on a production level. The 

objective is to keep the open portion of the stope nearly full of broken mineralized material to help 

stabilize the hangingwall. This method works well in ground conditions where the rock is competent 

and a clean break can be created at the HW contact. As long as the stope remains full with broken 

rock the hangingwall maintains stability. As the rock quality decreases and the hangingwall contact 

becomes less discrete, the HW will begin to loose stability and blocks will fall into the stope. The 

remedy is to decrease the stope size. The advantages of this method are that fewer production 

levels are required, drilling levels can be kept small, and the production cycle can be decoupled from 

the drilling cycle. This method has been used in historic areas of the mine. In the absence of rock 

mass characterization data, the PEA assumes all stopes will be mined using this method.

SRK has made a preliminary assessment of empirical design criteria for sizing pillars and stopes at 

the mine. The following stope design parameters have been assumed based on anticipated ground 

conditions. The parameters are based on the assumed rock properties in Table 16.2.1. 

The allowable open stope dimensions are based on Stability Graph method (Mathews, et. al., 1981). 

The method estimates the maximum hydraulic radius (exposed area divided by perimeter) of an 

open stope given the stability number of the hangingwall rock mass. The stability number is 

estimated from Q (Barton, et. al., 1974) estimate of rock mass quality modified by the failure potential 

of the natural jointing. 

The sill pillars and rib pillars dimensions are based on an empirical comparison of pillar width-to-

height ratio to the rock mass strength to stress ratio (Lunder and Pakalins, 1997). This method 

assumes tributary loading (no support from backfill) and average UCS values for the pillar. 

The following design parameters have been used in stope design: 

 Use shrinkage stope method and keep stopes as full as practicable until end to maintain 
hangingwall stability; 

 Mine veins from hangingwall to footwall in locations with multiple veins nearby; 
 Hangingwall stopes vertically lead footwall stopes by 1 level (125 ft); 
 Rib pillars are 1.5 times the mined vein thickness (about 6 ft); 
 The crown pillar at the surface is 2.0 times the mined vein thickness (about 7.5 ft); 
 Sill pillars between levels are 3.5 times the mined vein thickness (about 12.5 ft); 
 The maximum stope length is 125 ft. Hangingwall collapse is anticipated for the range of 

anticipated rock quality, but bulking of hangingwall rock is anticipated to choke off any 

progressive caving. Cave distance should be less than 60% of vein thickness (about 2 to 

4 ft)

 Dilution will likely range between 10% to 20% (about 4 to 10 inches) during shrinkage 
stoping; and 

 New footwall access drives are set-back from vein by four times mined vein thickness. 

Ground Support 

The Q System (Barton, et. al., 1974) has been used to estimate ground support requirements. For 

the range of ground conditions (Table 16.2.1), the anticipated support requirements are shown on 

Figure 16.2.3.  

The historic mine has benefited from small openings that have not required heavy bolting. The 

historic mining would have made extensive use of passive timber support. There were drifts that 

appeared to have been rehabbed in the 1980's where bolts were used. In the main haulage areas 

both off-vein and on-vein there were no active timber supports; however, timbers were observed just 

beyond closed off areas. The hangingwall-to-footwall timbers, 8 to 12 inches in diameter, would have 

been a typical support method for thin-vein open stopes. 

Recent rehabbed areas have made extensive use of active ground support. This support typically 

includes 4 ft and 6 ft split sets and both wire and chain-link mesh. There were areas that had 

Dywidag threaded anchor-end rock bolts. The combination of split sets as primary support and 

Dywidag bolts as secondary support is considered effective in blocky ground conditions. 

The PEA design assume only spot bolting will be required. This has been incorporated into the 

design by including 4 ft long split sets on a 4-ft spacing over 5% of the new workings. It is assumed 

that 10% of the historic workings that are rehabbed will require this average level of ground support.

Dilution 

Dilution into the stopes has been estimated using empirical design method for Equivalent Linear 

Overbreak/Slough (ELOS) based on work by Clark & Pakalnis (1997). For the stope parameters 

selected the ELOS chart estimates about 1.0 ft of sloughing when the top 6 ft of the shrinkage stope 

remains open. It is estimated that unplanned dilution of about 15% should be anticipated. 

16.3 Mine Design 
Figure 16.3.1 shows a long section of the Revenue and Yellow Rose veins showing blocks above a 

NSR cut-off grade of US$130/t as well as historic workings. This model formed the basis of the stope 

design.   

 

Figure 16.3.1: Rotated View approximating Long Section through Block Model 

 

Stope optimization was completed in Vulcan using a minimum mining width of 3 ft and an NSR cut-

off grade of US$130/t. 12.5 ft x 12.5 ft stopes were generated in the optimization and were then 

combined to form larger stopes as per geotechnical recommendations (~125 ft along strike and 

125 ft vertical). Figure 16.3.2 shows the stope optimizer shapes and an example of how they are 

grouped together to form a stoping block. For future mine design work it should be noted that the 

size of the blocks in the resource model is coarse for mine planning purposes and either smaller 

block resolution in the block model is required or stope optimization should be run with a stope 

height equal to the block height in order to identify mine plan resource areas without influence of 

block size on the mine plan.

There are two accesses into the mine via portals. The main access is via main Revenue Tunnel 

portal (10,600 ft amsl). Approximately 300 ft to the east is the portal entrance to the mill which is 

located underground at the same elevation. The underground mill connects to the Revenue Tunnel 

underground at a location approximately 300 ft in from the main portal of the Revenue Tunnel. 

Figure 16.3.3 shows the general layout of this area. There are other entrances to the mine, through 

old workings, collapsed stopes, etc., and it is believed these do not connect to the main parts of the 

mine and are not sufficiently sized for men/materials to pass. There are old raises and shafts to the 

surface that may in the future provide ventilation or access.

Currently, waste air escapes upwardly from the Virginius part of the mine via historic raises and 

stopes, and it is believed the air eventually exhausts through the old Virginius winze and out of the 

#3 portal which is currently not in use. Improved ventilation and secondary egress is currently being 

developed in the Yellow Rose part of the mine via the #8 raise. Once raise #8 is driven to final 

design height, a new drift will be driven out laterally to surface. A man-lift will be installed in the raise 

for secondary egress.  

Levels in new working areas will be connected through roybal raises in mineralized material with 

separate compartments for men/materials and muck. These raises were not designed in detail 

however a schematic explaining how the raises fit within the mining block are shown in 

Figure 16.3.4. A 70% extraction ratio was applied to the designed shape to simulate recovery of 

material within the shape.   

 

Figure 16.3.4: Schematic of Raises in Stoping Areas 

 

Figure 16.3.5 shows the completed mine design. Historically mined levels are planned to be used as 

accesses throughout the mine. These areas will be rehabilitated prior to stope development. The 

design encompasses the majority of the material above cut-off; however, small, narrow, and/or 

distant blocks have been excluded from the design.

16.4 Mine Plan Resource 
The underground mine design process results in mine plan resources of 888 kt (diluted) with an 

average grade of 14.6 oz/t Au, 0.02 oz/t Au, 2.26% Pb, and 0.90% Zn.  

This estimate is based on a NSR cut-off grade of US$130/t for design purposes and applying a 

marginal cut-off grade of US$50/t for reporting purposes. These numbers include a 90% mining 

recovery to the designed stope wireframes in addition to the 15% unplanned waste dilution within 

stopes. Additional development of 5% to 10% was applied based on development type to account for 

detail currently not in the design. Zero grade was used for the waste dilution.   

Table 16.4.1 summarizes the mine plan resources.

Measured, Indicated and Inferred mineral resources. Inferred mineral resources are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

16.5 Production Schedule 
The production schedule is based on the rate assumptions shown in Table 16.5.1.

Roybal Raise Two 6x6 with crosscuts between 2.5  ft / day 
Stope mucking  30 tons/day/stope 
Rehabilitation of historic workings  40 ft / day 
*All rates are per face. Multiple areas/faces are mined together to generate the production schedule. 

 

The mining operation schedule is based on 350 days/year, 7 days/week, with two 10 hr shifts each 

day. A production rate of 400 t/d was targeted with ramp-up to full production as quickly as possible. 

Table 16.5.2 presents the annual mining scheduled based on these assumptions. The schedule was 

completed using iGantt scheduling software. Minor rehabilitation/development begins in August 2014 

in the production schedule. A three month period of minimal development was scheduled to establish 

secondary egress in both mining areas. Once ventilation and egress are established production 

mining can begin and the mine ramps up as quickly as possible to 400 t/d.

16.6 Mining Operations 
Mining widths are very narrow, a width of 3 ft in the Revenue Virginius vein, and 4 ft in the Yellow 

Rose vein. Within a stope, two compartment raises on each side of the stope are developed for 

man/materials access and for mucking. Horizontal (breast) holes are drilled within the stope at a 

length of 6 ft.  Each stope is undercut by a 4 ft wide by 8 ft tall scram drift that is developed on strike 

and in mineralized material. The dimensions of the scram drift were chosen such that dilution is 

minimized and material from this drift is sent to the process facility as it is developed.   

The scram drift is fitted with slushers that pull the mineralized material towards chutes located on 

500-ft centers. At the chutes, mineralized material is loaded into muck cars and trammed by electric 

locomotive to a stockpile that consists of a slusher trench and can accommodate 500 tons of 

material. The slusher trench feeds into a grizzly with 12 inch x12 inch openings, then into a chute 

and reciprocating feeder that eventually feeds into the primary jaw crusher which crusher material to 

minus 2-1/2 inches.  

The mine plans to use pneumatic equipment and currently has no diesel equipment underground. In 

most areas the mine intends to make use of existing mine track and tracked mining equipment such 

as battery-powered locos, muck cars, track mounted jumbo and Eimco overhand mucking machines. 

Once additional ventilation is established, diesel equipment will be used underground to develop a 

ramp to lower levels of the Revenue Virginius area. 

The mine is using standard 24-inch gauge and 4-ton muck cars (5 tons heaped), with five cars per 

train. Typical rail haulage cycle time is approximately one hour and mine personnel are able to cycle 

nine trains per shift. There are still suppliers of track mining equipment and the company currently 

use is Mining Equipment Limited of Durango, Colorado.  

Approximately 10 working stopes are required to meet the production target of 400 t/d. An additional 

two to three stopes should be prepared and scheduled into the mining cycle to account for delays 

and transitions between the main production stopes. 

Development 

There is a development drift in the footwall of each mucking level. This drift is developed in waste 

and connects to a raise system which allows dropping of the material to a haulage level. The drifts 

on each level access the stopes. All other stope development is completed in mineralized material 

within the stoping area. Figure 16.6.1 shows an example development layout.

Figure 16.6.1: Example Development Layout 

 

Drilling 

Drilling both in scram drifts and in stopes will be undertaken by jack leg drills. Compressed air and 

water will be provided throughout the mine for drilling operations. 

Blasting 

The mine is dry enough to allow the use of pneumatically loaded ANFO. In case of wet areas 

cartridge explosives will be used. For planning purposes an estimate of 80% ANFO and 20% 

cartridge explosives has been used. Blasting is initiated from each main level or from surface at the 

end of shift. If the ventilation system at the mine is improved blast on demand may be used.   

Mucking and Hauling 

Material in the Yellow Rose will be railed to the mill using a series of raises where necessary. 

Material in the Revenue Virginius above the existing access level will be railed as well; however, all 

material below this level will need to be truck hauled to the main level before transferring the material 

to the rail system. Truck and LHD are assumed to be diesel. An additional haulage/material handling 

cost has been applied to this material. 

Backfill is currently not used at the mine however waste generated from development can be placed 

in mined out areas or alternatively be railed to surface.  

16.7 Mine Services 
Ventilation 

A ventilation design has not been designed in detail at this time for the life of mine plan. Currently a 

ventilation plan has been submitted to MSHA is summarized in the following paragraphs.  

 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 109 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

The Revenue ventilation system consists of: 

 Two dual 30 hp (60 hp per fan) main fans installed at the Revenue air doors; 
 40 hp booster fan located at the mill; 
 60 hp fan at the Yellow rose drift; 
 50 hp fan at the south Virginius; and 
 10 hp fan with VFD at the shop area. 

Approximately 30,000 cfm of air is drawn in through the portal. Of this 14,000 cfm ventilates the mill 

and the remaining air travels down the Revenue tunnel. Vent doors and 24-inch vent pipes control 

the delivery of air to working areas. The air exhausts upward vertically from the Virginius part of the 

mine via historic raises and stopes, and it is believed the air eventually exhausts through the old 

Virginius winze and out of the #3 portal which is currently not in use.  

Table 16.7.1 summarizes the fans throughout the mine.

Once the ventilation system is ramped up (currently planned for 2014), there will be approximately 

5,000 cfm per stope or working area totaling a full mine airflow of over 65,000 cfm. Total calculated 

airflow requirement at the mine is based on having perceptible airflow in working areas as there is no 

diesel equipment underground at this time. If diesel equipment is introduced underground airflow will 

need to be increased and be based on a standard 125 cfm/bhp.   

Continued improved ventilation and secondary egress is currently being developed in the Yellow 

Rose part of the mine via the #8 raise. Additional booster fans and vent bag should be considered 

near working areas to ensure sufficient airflow and timely clearing of blasts. Air doors and bulkheads 

should be installed as required. 

Compressed Air 

The mine production equipment is primarily air powered. The mine utilizes three compressors 

connected into a surface header that provides air to the mine through a various sized air pipeline (4 

to 8 inch line) designed to provide 125 psig to the operations. The air line then branches and is 

6 inch into the Yellow Rose and Revenue Virginius vein areas. From there a 4 inch line is run into the

stopes. Table 16.7.2 shows a summary of the compressors that provide air to the system. All air 

compressors are electric driven.

Total 750 3,617     

 

This compressed air capacity appears adequate for the current and planned operations. 

Dewatering 

Mine dewatering is accomplished by use of electric pumps located at the sump areas and by air 

powered pumps that are placed in vein locations on an as needed basis. All water is drained to the 

main Yellow Rose/Virginius level and transported to the portal through the drainage ditch located 

next to the track in the main haulage drift. Future considerations include additional electrical pumps 

to be located in sumps as required. 

Electrical Supply 

The underground electrical supply initiates in the project substation transformer and is provided by a 

power line (4160 V) suspended from the back in the main haulage to the mine workings in the Yellow 

Rose and Virginius zones. Table 16.7.3 presents the current and future projected underground 

electrical requirements for the mine operating at 300 t/d. Minor adjustments to the electrical load will 

allow the mine to scale up to 400 t/d.

Health and Safety 

The mine has an emergency escape plan (SMO escape plan 3-11-14) which has been accepted by 

MSHA. There is a refuge station and first-aid/lunch room in both the Yellow Rose and Virginius 

sections of the mine. A stench warning system is installed on the compressed air line entering the 

mine as well as the air intake for the mine ventilation. Underground communications consists of mine 

telephones at key locations and future plans are for the mine supervisors to also have hand-held 

radios. 

In the Virginius section of the mine, an 8 ft diameter raise borehole will be drilled from the Virginius 

haulage level to surface. The 1,465 ft long raise borehole will act as an exhaust vent and will be 

outfitted with a man-lift conveyance for emergency egress. In the Yellow Rose, a secondary escape-

way is being developed that will also make use of a man-lift conveyance installed in the #4 raise. 

Miners will take the man-lift conveyance to the top of #4 raise, then walk along sub-level access to 

the #8 raise. From there, the miners will climb a ladder-way approximately 45 ft up the #8 raise to the 

next sub-level which connects to surface via a portal.  

A tag in/tag out board is used at both portals. All underground personnel are issued with portable 

self-rescuer units. A total of 12 Ventis MX4 portable gas detectors are at the mine and made 

available for use in underground and confined space entry. The mine's current policy is that at least 

one person in each working area of the underground mine will carry a MX4 detector. The alarms 

have been set on these detectors to go off at 35 ppm CO, 19.5% oxygen, 3 ppm NO2, and 10% LEL. 

The safety department also has two Ibrid MX6 gas detectors – one set up for Oxygen, CO, H2S, and 

LEL and the other set up for oxygen, CO, SO2, H2S, and LEL. The latter is equipped with a pump. All 

pumps are on a regular calibration schedule.  

Manpower 

The mine operates a 10-hour work shift with two shifts per day. A third shift is at rest at any given 

time. The three shifts work a staggered rotation with 7 days on, 3 days off, followed by 7 days on and 

4 days off. The project currently has 110 employees and expects to grow to 120 at full capacity. The 

mine currently has 70 underground workers and is non-unionized.  

For productivity calculations Fortune assumes 8 productive hours of work out of a 10-hour shift. This 

gives time for meal breaks, travel time, safety meetings, etc. Travel distances to some areas can be 

quite long and as the mine is developed further minimizing time to get personnel to working areas 

will be important.

17 Recovery Methods  
Preliminary test work on bulk samples taken from the mine indicate that metals and precious metals 

may be recovered using standard crushing, grinding and flotation methods. Historically in 1912, 

mineralized material was treated using what today would be considered a conventional flotation 

process. Based on these preliminary results and historical information, Star Mines directed CH2M 

HILL to provide a detailed engineering design for a 300 t/d plant. 

CH2M HILL designed a conventional plant to process Virginius and Yellow Rose mineralized 

material that included two-stage crushing, ball mill grinding, reagent storage, flotation, flotation 

concentrate filtration for product shipment and a tailings filtration circuit for dry tailings disposal. At 

the time of this writing the plant is being commissioned.  

Additionally, Fortune is in the process of increasing plant throughput to 400 t/d. The major 

components in crushing, grinding and flotation appear to have sufficient capacity for such a change.  

17.1 Processing Methods 
Silver bearing mineralized material will be treated using conventional methods. Processing will 

consist of crushing, grinding, flotation, concentrate filtration and tailings filtration. Tailings will be dry 

stacked. 

Water supply for the Project will be from the existing underground workings, which currently make 

sufficient water for the plant requirements. 

17.2 Flowsheet 
The mill is designed to treat 300 t/d of mineralized material to produce a lead-silver concentrate and 

a zinc-silver concentrate. Alternatively, the plant may be reconfigured to produce a lead-silver-zinc 

bulk concentrate. The plant is situated in an underground section of the mine. 

Railcars from the mine face will discharge into a mineralized material storage bin at a rate of 30 t in 

10 minutes. 

Mineralized material will be fed to a primary jaw crusher using a slusher system to drag material to 

the crusher feed chute at a rate of 70 t/h. Crusher product will fall onto a conveyor that transports the 

material to a vibrating screen. Screen undersize will be conveyed to a fine mineralized material bin. 

Screen oversize will be conveyed back to the secondary cone crusher. Secondary crusher product 

will be discharged onto the vibrating screen feed conveyor with the jaw crusher product. 

Vibrating screen product will be conveyed to a crushed mineralized material bin. The material will be 

reclaimed from the mineralized material bin with a slot feeder and fed to a single stage ball mill at the 

rate of 12.5 t/h. 

The ball mill will operate in closed circuit with hydro-cyclones and will grind the material to a 

140 mesh (106 μm) product size. 

A gravity concentrator for coarse gold recovery takes a slip stream from the cyclone feed stream, 

which will then be recycled back to the ball mill circuit. Gravity concentrate will be tabled to produce a 

gold/silver concentrate for sale.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

Cyclone overflow will flow by gravity to a conditioning tank where flotation reagents will be added. 

Conditioned slurry will be fed to a flotation circuit that may be configured to produce a bulk lead-silver 

and a zinc-silver concentrate. The flotation cells will be configured in a standard rougher-cleaner 

circuit. 

Flotation concentrate will be filtered for shipment at a rate of approximately 20 t/d. 

Tailings will be filtered and dumped from the filter press onto the filter press building floor. Tailings 

will then be reclaimed with a front-end loader to be loaded into trucks for transport to a disposal area.  

17.3 Plant Design and Equipment Characteristics 

The design is based on a plant throughput rate of 300 t/d or 12.5 t/h. Considering mine availability 

and plant maintenance downtime, the annual rate is estimated to be 91,000 t/y. 

The crusher and screening circuits will be designed to run at 70 t/h until the fine mineralized material 

bin is full, then shut down. 

The Revenue mine is located at an elevation of approximately 10,600 ft above sea level, which was 

considered in the equipment and motor design. 

Tables 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 show the key process design criteria and major process equipment for the 

crushing, grinding, flotation and filtration operations for the plant.

17.3.1 Plant Expansion to 400 Tons per Hour 

Several major pieces of equipment were sized conservatively in the plant design. As an example the 

crushing circuit is designed to process 70 t/h, which requires that the plant only be operated five 

hours per day to provide the required tonnage for a single day of operation. Similarly, the ball mill is 

equipped with a 400 hp motor but calculations show that it would require only 300 hp to process the 

300 t/d to the specified grind size of 106 μm. Ball mill power requirements already include de-rating 

of the motor for altitude and a 20% contingency. The lead and zinc rougher flotation cells have a 

scale-up factor from laboratory test work of 3.5, which is higher than a conventional scale-up of 2.5.  

Increasing plant throughput to 400 t/h would likely be feasible. The major components in crushing, 

grinding and flotation appear to have sufficient capacity for such a change. Capacity of pumps, 

piping and tailings filters would need to be reviewed. Operation is currently assessing capacity of the 

different components and has plans to maximize throughput. 

17.4 Consumable Requirements 
The conventional nature of this plant would indicate that the major consumables utilized would be 

known in the industry and would be readily available. The consumables used in the process are 

listed in Table 17.4.1. Reagent consumptions shown in Table 17.4.1 are based on preliminary 

laboratory data and have not been optimized.

18 Project Infrastructure  

18.1 Accessibility 
The Project is located approximately 5.5 miles southwest of Ouray, Colorado, near the headwaters 

of Sneffels Creek. Ouray is small town with 854 people (2004) and most of Silver Star's workers live 

in Ouray. The surrounding Ouray County has a population of 4,300 (2005). The immediate region 

around the town has a long history of underground mining dating back to almost the mid-19th 

Century. There are two other underground mines nearby that are currently closed. Silver Star states 

that there are experienced miners available in Ouray and in other nearby towns.  

According to Ouray's web site, the region's largest employers are the government, education, and 

tourism sectors with additional opportunities in the real estate and construction industries. Ouray 

County has its own physicians and staff, volunteer emergency medical technicians, volunteer fire 

department and a mountain rescue team.  

The mine is located halfway between the towns of Ouray and Telluride and the portal of the Revenue 

Tunnel is located at the historic town site of Sneffels. There are several historical mines in the area 

comprising what is known as the Sneffels Mining District which is host to both the Camp Bird and the 

RV, two famous and very productive mines within the greater San Juan Mountains. The road to the 

mine is maintained by the county of Ouray between May 1st and November 1st, of each year. During 

the remaining months of the year the county maintains approximately half of the road and the mine is 

responsible for the remaining distance. The road is dirt and challenging for full length semi-trucks.  

18.2 Power 
Electric power to the mine is supplied on overhead lines by San Miguel Power Association. The 

power is three phase, 12,470 volts, and has a capacity of up to 3 MW with currently installed lines. 

San Miguel Power Association is the local electric company and Century Link is the land line phone 

provider. Cost for the power at the mine is US$0.08/KWH. 

In case of loss of permanent power a diesel powered backup generator is being installed. The 

generator is a 1 MW 480V CAT which is sized to provide power for critical motors like compressors, 

fans and pumps. There is a 10,000 gallon diesel storage tank at the mine to fuel the standby 

generator. 

18.3 Water 
The mine has water rights for sufficient water supply for all activities. The water comes from both 

flowing and storage water decrees. There are several underground water storage areas throughout 

the mine.   

In the Virginius area there is storage for approximately 12,000 gallons. The Virginius area also has a 

steady flow of around 5 to 10 gpm in summer months and dries up as the surface starts freezing. In 

the Yellow Rose area the historic Anglo Saxon workings have been dammed up and hold an 

estimated 615,000 gallons. Water flow is this area is continuous throughout the year at an estimated 

100 to150 gpm. Current water use for mining is estimated to be approximately 25 gpm. 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 119 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

All the water used in the mill process comes from drainage in the mine collected in a cistern and 

added to the process water tank as required. Water consumption at the mill varies with grades and 

tonnage. Typically for a process capacity of 300 t/d, the water requirement is approximately 12 gpm. 

For a 400 t/d process capacity the water requirement would be proportionately higher at 

approximately 16 gpm.   

18.4 Mining Personnel 
The mine has approximately 105 employees, with 94 of those being hourly and 11 being salaried 

management employees. The work force is broken down into the following categories:  

 Underground Mining; 
 Mill; 
 Safety; 
 Electrical; 
 Maintenance; 
 Warehouse; 
 Geology; and 
 Engineering. 

The majority of the employees live in Ouray; however, some live in the more distant communities of 

Ridgway, Montrose, and Silverton.  

The mine is also supported by a group of approximately 20 managerial and executive staff from 

Fortune Minerals Limited (London, Ontario), the owner of the mine. Personnel from Fortune include 

mining engineers working on the mine design and production plans.  

Table 18.4.1 summarizes the personnel at the mine. 

Table 18.4.1: Underground Mine Personnel** 

Personnel Type Current Number Full Production Number Wages (US$/hr)* 
Miner 1 10 35 $40 
Miner 7 17 $35-37

Shifters & Forman 5 7 $40-50 
Total 32 78  
 * Does not include burden. 
** Mine maintenance and technical support included in other areas. 

 

18.5 Tailings & Waste Disposal Areas 
There are two tailings storage areas, Revenue and Atlas as shown in Figure 18.5.1.  The Revenue 

storage capacity is 333 kt tons and the currently permitted Atlas has a capacity of 149 kt. This 

current capacity will provide storage for 4.2 years of mining at 400 t/d. Additional permitting through 

Army Corp of Engineers to relocate a wetland would expand the Atlas pile to 810 kt tons. The 

Company has stated that with a permit modification the capacity could be increased to approximately 

4 Mt.

Waste rock from the mine is railed to surface and will be co-disposed with tailing at either/both the 

Revenue and Atlas TSF dry stack features Waste rock can also be placed underground in mined out 

areas if need be. A portion of the waste rock is also used as road building material.   

18.6 Processing Plant Site 
The underground mill was designed by CH2M HILL to operate at a capacity of 300 t/d or 91,000 t/y 

assuming 90% availability. It will produce lead-silver and zinc-silver concentrates. A primary crusher 

circuit, also located underground, has been designed to operate at 70 t/hr and will only be operated 

as required. Both the mill and crushing assembly are located in a section of existing underground 

drift near the main portal. Figure 18.5.1 shows the location of the underground mill. 

The mills capacity can be increased, with minor modifications to the circuit, to process 400 t of 

material per day. These modifications are currently in progress.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 
Community Impact  
The following sub-sections provide discussion of relevant aspects of Project permitting and status, 

ongoing environmental studies, and potential social and/or community impacts. 

20.1 Required Permits and Status 
Inasmuch as the Revenue Mine surface operations (as permitted in the DRMS 112D permit) are to 

occur only on patented mining claims that are located within Ouray County, Colorado, the permitting 

requirements are greatly simplified. By virtue of restricting operations to patented claims only, 

Fortune is not confronted with certain environmental obligations imposed by the National 

Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or related statutes that would typically accompany the 

development and operation of a mining operation on federal lands (which by definition would include 

unpatented claims). Further, since mining is considered a "use by right" within the confines of Ouray 

County, typical land use ordinances (other than those associated with building and code related 

issues) do not apply. Therefore, the primary required permits (and the status thereof) are limited to 

those described below. 

Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (DRMS) 112D Reclamation Permit 

The Project holds an approved DRMS 112D Reclamation Permit. The 112 D Permit is applicable to a 

hard rock mine that DRMS terms a "large mine" (i.e., encompassing 10 acres or greater surface 

disturbance and/or annual production in excess of 70,000 t/y). The Project operations, as permitted, 

are indicated to occupy a 34.19 acre permit area and produce at a nominal rate of approximately 

80,000 t/y (of mineralized material); however, the Company indicates that mineralized material 

production could increase to on the order of 134,000 t/y. The "D" component of the permit number 

refers to what DRMS terms a "designated mining operation" (DMO) which is by definition a "mining 

operation at which toxic or acid-forming materials will be exposed or disturbed as a result of mining 

operations". In the case of the Revenue Mine, it is considered a DMO by virtue of two contributing 

factors: (1) mine water emanating from the mine may contain levels of certain metals that could 

exceed Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) limits absent any specific 

action taken to mitigate; and, (2) chemical reagents utilized in the milling process are potentially 

hazardous, resulting in specific storage, handling, and use requirements. Under planned milling 

processes, the resultant mill tailing is anticipated to be virtually "inert" (i.e., non-acid generating and 

minimal residual metals content), and as such, the mill tailing does not contribute to the DMO status. 

As a DMO, the Project is required to develop an approved (integral to the Permit approval; as Exhibit 

T attached to the application) "Environmental Protection Plan" (EMP). Relative to the discharge of 

Revenue Mine portal water to Sneffels Creek, the Company has largely based its plan around 

mitigation of zinc concentrations (as the most significant constituent of concern) through employing a 

combination of methodologies: (a) enhanced zinc precipitation within the Revenue mine ditch; (b) 

detention and dilution of mine water within a pond; and (c) use of source reduction processes 

underground, inclusive of the sealing off of poor water quality contribution zones. With respect to mill 

tailing characteristics, the Company has employed a mill process flow sheet that incorporates a high 

percentage recovery flotation process targeting optimal removal of sulfides (recovered in the 

concentrate and subject to appropriate smelter penalties and/or credits, dependent on the contained 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

metal), with the objective being the rendering of the resultant tailing virtually "inert", following which 

tailing is to be disposed via dry stack methods (using engineered/compacted fill methods) at the 

Revenue Waste Pile and/or the Atlas Waste Pile (usage to vary on the basis of seasonal constraints 

imposed by avalanche potential at the Revenue waste pile). Given that mill tailing materials would be 

virtually "inert", no base liners or capping layers are specified for the dry stacks in the EMP. Waste 

rock (with anticipated production to be on the order of 20,000 t/y) is also anticipated to be virtually 

"inert" (i.e., non-acid generating); it is anticipated that the majority of waste rock produced may be 

sold or donated (as aggregate) to nearby municipal entities (such as the City of Ouray and/or Ouray 

County) and that any remaining amounts can be directly incorporated into existing waste rock 

features and/or co-disposed within the tailing matrix. Onsite chemical/reagent storage and use is 

addressed in the EMP through various "best management practices" such as an internal collection 

sump within the underground mill tunnels and area, as well as surface staging areas and 

storage/handling procedures established and operated in conjunction with an approved Spill 

Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan, Primary reagents anticipated to be utilized 

in milling operations include calcium oxide (powder), sodium hydroxide (50% solution), sodium 

hydrogen sulfide (granular), sodium bisulfate (granular), copper sulfate (granular), zinc sulfate, 

potassium amyl xanthate, MIBC, and AERO 404 promoter.  

DRMS issued approval of the 112D Reclamation Permit No. M-2012-032 on January 17, 2013, with 

subsequent permit issuance on February 5, 2013. An annual report and fee (currently set at 

US$1,150) is required on the permit anniversary date (February 5) each year. In conjunction with 

DRMS Permit No. M-2012-032, the Company has been obligated to establish and guarantee a 

reclamation bond in the amount of US$277,078 (established as Corporate Surety No. 1060997). This 

reclamation bond amount has been calculated on the basis of the planned operations, as permitted. 

Any pending or subsequent modification of the Plan of Operations will result in a recalculation and 

can result in a possible adjustment of the required bond amount. While the DRMS reclamation permit 

is a key permit required to allow mining operations to commence, it should be recognized that the 

112D Permit is a "reclamation permit" focusing on operational aspects that may influence ultimate 

site closure and reclamation requirements. More importantly, the Permit requires that the Operator 

assure (by certification) that all aspects of operations are carried out in conformance/compliance with 

all other applicable federal, state and municipal laws and ordinances. 

Incremental stipulations and conditions associated with the permit approval were imposed by DRMS, 

as follows:  

1. The Operator is required to continue a water quality monitoring program (as approved by 

CDPHE) associated with underground and surface water quality sampling for the life of the 

permit.  

Relative to this Condition, SRK notes that Fortune installed a series of six groundwater 

monitoring wells (two wells at each of three locations in order to address two discrete 

intervals of groundwater occurrence), and conducted an initial round of sampling in early 

June 2014. Typically, DRMS requires five calendar quarters of monitoring results as a 

minimal baseline requirement; however, Fortune indicates that it may be allowed to address 

this requirement through an additional monitoring event in combination with 

utilization/interpretation of certain historical data. Final resolution of this rests with DRMS, 

and negotiations are ongoing as of this review. Accordingly, SRK cannot issue an opinion in 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 125 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

this regard other than stating that it is likely that the five calendar quarter requirement would 

represent a "worst case" scenario. 

2. The Operator is restricted from implementing production level operation of the mill until a 

limited test run of the mill has generated an amount of tailing material sufficient to be 

analyzed and certified (i.e., 250 t or greater, if required) by DRMS. The tailing must be 

demonstrated as being capable of not adversely affecting the "hydrologic balance" when 

disposed in a manner in accordance with the Plan of Operations. Written acceptance by 

DRMS (and written authorization to proceed) is required prior to elevating operations to 

production status. 

With respect to this Condition, SRK notes that DRMS is interested in ensuring that mill tailing 

characteristics are such that moisture content, residual metal content, and sulfide content 

are within "acceptable ranges" (although no specific performance criteria have been 

specified by DRMS) so as to not pose a concern relative to dry stack geotechnical stability 

and potential impacts to surface and/or groundwater. DRMS indicates that a subjective 

analysis of Synthetic Precipitation Leach Potential (SPLP) and/or Meteoric Leaching 

Potential test procedure results will be applied against "stream standards" within the 

receiving segment of Sneffels Creek to determine acceptability or non-acceptability. 

As of the June 19, 2014 site inspection, initial test runs of the Revenue mill suggest that 

achieving optimal moisture content may prove challenging under current conditions 

(significant clay and moisture content appears present in the filtered tail). At present, tailing 

pulp is routed directly from the flotation cells to the pressure filtration equipment. Given that 

test-scale process runs are proving problematic in achieving optimum moisture content (with 

this configuration), SRK believes that the current pressure filtration configuration may prove 

to be a bottleneck when scaling up to the planned production level (and any subsequent 

scale-up to 400 t/d). However, SRK believes that process refinement/optimization and/or 

appropriate plant modifications can be timely completed (coincident with other start-up 

activities) in order to render the tailing "acceptable" to DRMS (and facilitate the authorization 

for production-scale activities) without significantly impacting the project schedule. 

In the event an "acceptable" mill tailing cannot be produced on an ongoing basis, Fortune is 

prepared to advance other tailing disposal options, which could include: (a) engineering 

design modifications to the planned disposal option; or (b) incorporation of underground 

cemented paste backfill disposal; or (c) potential offsite disposal. Each of these alternatives 

would require permit modification and as such may have attendant timeline implications as 

well as an associated variance in capital and operating costs as pertaining to tailing disposal. 

3. The Operator is required to conduct "periodical" geochemical analyses of both waste rock 

and mineralized material. Waste rock analysis is to be performed on a quarterly basis during 

each calendar quarter that waste rock is generated and disposed of in a waste rock disposal 

area. Mineralized material analysis is to be performed quarterly or when new areas not 

previously tested are initially opened for production. 

With respect to this Condition, Fortune anticipates that only nominal quantities of waste rock 

will be produced during production-scale operations, with disposition being either through co-

disposal with tailing or through outright sale or donation to local municipalities (for use as 

road base, etc.). To date, all indications are that the primarily andesitic waste rock will have 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 126 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

negligible acid generating potential and as such should be readily manageable within the 

TSF; however, the results of initial analyses are pending. SRK believes that waste rock 

management is (or can be) satisfactorily addressed through current facility design or minor 

modification thereto.  

4. The Operator is restricted from installing a proposed perforated line to be buried within the 

existing waste rock dump (in lieu of discharging mine-derived water into the existing mine 

pond) until such time that all waste rock analysis has been performed and accepted by 

DRMS (in accordance with specific parameters).  

The net effect of Condition #4 has been a DRMS-imposed deferral of the construction (and 

activation) of the mine discharge leach field/water management feature. As discussed above 

(under Condition #3), the results of waste rock analyses remain pending as of the date of 

this review. In the interim, Fortune is authorized to discharge direct to Sneffels Creek. SRK 

believes that this Condition will be satisfactorily addressed once waste rock analyses are 

completed and "accepted" by DRMS; however, we note that no "specific parameters" have to 

date been identified by DRMS.  

Technical Revision No. 1 (TR-01) to Permit M-2012-032 was approved/issued by DRMS on 

November 8, 2013. TR-01 established engineering design criteria for the proposed mine water 

discharge leach field. Although TR-01 resulted in a minor reduction in the calculated reclamation 

bond amount (to US$276,217.80), the previously established bond amount (US$277,078) was 

retained.  

Technical Revision No. 2 (TR-02) to Permit M-2012-032 was approved/issued by DRMS on April 1, 

2014. TR-02 authorized Star to carry out a "reduction in the area of the Phase 2 Atlas waste pile in 

order to avoid wetlands". While a net reduction in disturbed acreage was realized with this Technical 

Revision, the previously established bond amount of US$277,078 was retained. However, one effect 

of TR-02 was to reduce the available (currently permitted) tailing storage capacity, with an interim but 

corresponding reduction in mine life (as invoked by tailing storage capacity only) to approximately 

6.6 years (inclusive of start-up and shut-down activities). However, by initially constructing the 

smaller footprint facility, Fortune has strategically established a secondary (winter) tailing disposal 

facility. SRK notes that commissioning and utilization of the Atlas facility will be contingent on the 

completion of a bridge across Sneffels Creek, as tailing is to be transported from the mill to the dry 

stack feature by truck. SRK has not been provided with any information relative to the design, 

permitting, or construction schedule associated with such a bridge, and as such cannot provide 

further comment in this regard.  

Fortune is (or will be) timely addressing the USACE 404 permitting requirements (individual permit) 

associated with a future expansion of the Atlas TSF feature which, when accomplished, will result in 

a corresponding increase in mine life (as determined by available tailing storage capacity only). 

Given that the need for additional storage capacity is several years out, SRK is of the opinion that 

Fortune can satisfactorily address the 404 permitting concerns associated with the Atlas facility 

expansion such that ongoing production can continue uninterrupted. 

Technical Revision No. 3 (TR-03) to Permit M-2012-032 was approved/issued by DRMS in May 

2014. TR-03 pertains to a modification of the planned monitoring well construction details in order to 

address the unanticipated encountering of two discrete vertical zones of groundwater occurrence. 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 127 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

SRK understands that all wells have been installed and properly documented (see TR-04) and that 

TR-03 resulted in no modification of the reclamation bond amount. 

Technical Revision No. 4 (TR-04) to Permit M-2012-032 was submitted to DRMS on July 1, 2014, 

with DRMS review/approval pending. TR-04 pertains to: (a) provision of "as-built" details for the six 

groundwater monitoring wells that were the subject of TR-3; (b) incorporation of additional 

disturbance area in a location proximal to and north of the mine portal to accommodate equipment 

storage and a temporary tailing staging area; and (c) an incremental bond amount (to a proposed 

new total of US$330,000) to accommodate concurrent use of the Revenue and Atlas waste disposal 

(TSF) features.   

CDPS Wastewater Discharge Permit – CDPHE Water Quality Control Division 

The Project has an approved Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) wastewater discharge 

permit (Permit No. CD000003), for which the State of Colorado holds primacy for issuance and 

enforcement pursuant to the US EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 

program. The permit originally issued on August 31, 2013, but was amended, and reissued on March 

28, 2014 with the effective date remaining August 31, 2013. CDPS permits are subject to renewal on 

five year intervals. 

CDPS Permit No. CO000003 is considered a new industrial minor permit, authorizing discharge to 

surface water (Sneffels Creek) via Outfall 001A, associated with a lined retention pond (a Class D 

wastewater facility). Outfall 001A serves as the point of compliance for the permit, which 

accommodates a facility flow of up to 1.75 MGD. This flow is derived from mine water discharging 

from the Revenue portal. As discussed above, the mine is currently authorized to discharge directly 

to Sneffels Creek; however, once DRMS determines water management facilities (leach field and 

mine water pond) to be "acceptable" and the facilities are made operational, Fortune becomes 

subject to all conditions of the issued CDPS permit. 

The permit basis establishes the facility as a mine where silver is the principal product, with gold, 

zinc, and lead listed as additional extraction products. As indicated previously, mineralized material 

is milled at an underground mill that incorporates flotation processes to achieve incremental metal 

recovery(ies) such that the tailing is virtually "inert" (i.e., low residual metal content and leachability 

potential, as well as low sulfide content). The tailing is to be dry-stacked on existing waste rock 

dumps (with commingled quantities of waste rock) such that there would be no anticipated oxidation 

or leaching of constituents (of significance) that could adversely affect surface or groundwater. The 

permit, as approved, does not allow for any chemical usage in the waters that are to be discharged; 

future approval must be achieved prior to such usage, if chemical treatment or modification is to be 

employed. 

Monitoring requirements associated with the permit commenced on permit issuance and continue for 

the life of the permit: flow volume and water temperature are to be monitored continuously by 

recorder; pH two days per month by grab sample; and remaining constituents such as total 

suspended solids (TSS), oil and grease, total dissolved solids (TDS), and a metals suite comprising 

(total and/or dissolved forms) arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chrome 3 plus (Cr+3), Cu, cyanide (CN) 

cyanide as weak acid dissociable (WAD), iron (Fe), Pb, manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), Ag, and Zn 

at various frequencies. In addition, Star is required to conduct chronic Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) 

testing on a quarterly basis.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

CDPS Stormwater Discharge Permit – CDPHE Water Quality Control Division 

The Project has an approved Stormwater Discharge Permit (CDPS General Permit No.COR040000 

– Certification No. COR040273) issued September 19, 2012. The General Permit for Stormwater 

Discharges Associated with Metal Mining Operations and Mine-Waste Remediation expired on 

September 30, 2011; however, the General Permit has been administratively continued by CDPHE 

and the permit remains in effect. The current annual fee for the permit is US$375. 

Facility stormwater runoff discharges to Sneffels Creek within Segment 09 of the Uncompahgre 

River Sub-basin. Segment 09 is reviewable and classified for the following beneficial uses: Aquatic 

Life (Class 2 Cold); Recreation (Class P); and Agriculture. CDPHE WQCD has determined that the 

practice-based effluent limits are adequate to protect all water quality standards and meet any Total 

Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements applicable to the Project facility. However, Segment 09 is 

listed as "impaired" for cadmium and zinc, in accordance with Section 303(d) of the federal Clean 

Water Act, and CDPHE water quality control discharge (WQCD) has not developed a TMDL for 

these parameters for this segment. Therefore, site-specific benchmark sampling for cadmium and 

zinc is required for the Project. 

In conjunction with Permit No. COR040000, is the requirement to monitor, on a quarterly basis, the 

site-specific benchmark criteria of (potentially dissolved) cadmium and zinc. In addition, benchmark 

monitoring for discharges from the "waste rock and overburden piles" is required for a number of 

parameters (TSS, turbidity, pH, and a suite of metals). Sampling from facility holding ponds or other 

impoundments is to be performed at the outlet of the pond; however, if the pond does not discharge, 

no sampling is necessary. Facility inspections and annual reporting are required. 

Air Emission Permit(s) – CDPHE Air Quality Control Division 

The Project is required to submit an appropriate Air Pollutant Emissions Notice (APEN) form 

descriptive of all identified emissions sources.  It is presumed that exceedence of threshold limits will 

not be demonstrated, in which case the representative sources would be exempt from permitting 

requirements. Fortune has indicated that the appropriate APEN application has been completed and 

submitted, and that CDPHE response is pending. 

US EPA Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan 

The Company has reportedly developed and put in place a formal Spill Prevention, Control, and 

Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan in accordance with applicable regulations. The SPCC Plan (or an 

enhanced equivalent) is stated to incorporate storage, handling, and emergency response actions 

associated with not only petroleum-based products, but also all other chemicals, reagents, etc. that 

are managed and/or used onsite. 

USACE Section 404(d) Permitting Authority 

Effective April 22, 2014 the Company secured authorization under Nationwide Permit (NWP) No. 44 

Mining Activities relative to expanding the Revenue waste rock dump into a portion (0.21 ac) of the 

existing Revenue Pond. All work is required to be completed with the general terms of NWP 44, to 

include avoidance measures identified in the report "Cultural Resource Inventory of Proposed 

Disturbance Areas at the Revenue Tunnel" and additional identified measures. In addition, the 

Company is obligated to compensate the unavoidable impacts to Revenue Pond through 

construction of a new Mine Water Pond (0.24 acres). 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 129 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

As mentioned above, future tailing disposal options may incorporate areas immediately surrounding 

the Atlas Waste Pile feature. It is likely that any such action may require an individual permit (i.e., the 

action would not fall under the purview of the NWP 44). At this juncture, this and other tailing 

disposal options (such as underground paste backfill) are at the evaluation stage. 

Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Authorization 

The Project holds a valid MSHA Authorization (ID No. 0503528), reportedly obtained in October 

2011 via transfer from the prior operator. 

Ouray Count Permit(s)  

Ouray County Land Use Code Section 22 specifies mining as a "use by right", therefore no special or 

conditional use permit is required to commence mining operations. This was confirmed by the Ouray 

County Land Use Department in a letter dated March 27, 2012. 

The Project is subject to conformance with standard building code and code enforcement criteria as 

associated with construction and use/occupancy of the various involved infrastructure facilities, to 

include structures and associated sanitary facilities. The Company represents that all required 

permits and authorizations associated with Ouray County building and/or zoning guidelines have 

been satisfactorily addressed and that the planned mining operation can commence accordingly. 

Subsequent additions or modifications to existing facilities will be subject to similar 

permits/approvals. Except as may be indicated, SRK has not attempted to confirm compliance status 

relative to Ouray County codes and ordinances.  

20.2 Environmental Study Results 
No significant environmental studies (beyond routine baseline and design documentation as 

associated with project development and permitting) have been identified. 

DRMS Permit M2012-032 does require that the Company conduct quarterly sampling/reporting of 

materials emplaced in waste disposal facilities (e.g., the Revenue Waste Pile and the Atlas Waste 

Pile where tailing is to be dry-stacked and potentially commingled with waste rock). This is reportedly 

to be a life-of-mine ongoing effort incorporating SPLP (leaching) testing of deposited materials 

(tailing and waste rock), as well as compaction testing as associated with placement of waste 

material lifts within the feature(s). 

Chronic Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) testing is also required over the life of the wastewater 

discharge permit (Permit CDPS Permit No. CO000003). 

Study results and findings will be utilized by DRMS and/or CDPHE in subsequent modifications (if 

any) of associated permits. 

20.3 Environmental Issues 
No significant environmental issues have been identified. 

Items of minor significance which have been noted include the following: 

 Presence of an avalanche run-out zone in alignment with the Revenue Waste Rock Pile. The 
Company indicates that facility design and operational measures have been identified to 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 130 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

mitigate or reduce concerns in this regard. SRK believes that facility design and/or 

operational measures adequately address this item; 

 The Company has identified/recognized the probable need for a USACE Section 404 
individual permit in association with potential expansion of the Atlas Waste Rock Pile area. 

Appropriate wetland delineation studies and mitigation measures will need to be pursued in 

a timely manner as appropriate for the planned scheduling for usage of the area – at current, 

being several years out. SRK believes Fortune is capable of addressing this issue in a timely 

manner such that there would be no interruption in ongoing production; and 

 The Company is apparently evaluating the potential application of paste backfill placement 
(underground) as a means of disposal for some portion of future produced tailing. 

Appropriate hydrologic investigations/evaluations and UIC permitting efforts will be required 

as appropriate for the planned scheduling of such – at current, being several years out. SRK 

believes Fortune has sufficient interim tailing storage capacity available at the Revenue and 

Atlas TSF features, and thus sufficient time to address all requirements associated with a 

paste backfill option. 

20.4 Operating and Post Closure Requirements and Plans  
Operating and post-closure requirements and plans are discussed in Sections 20.7 through 20.10. 

20.5 Post-Performance or Reclamation Bonds 
At this juncture, there exists only the DRMS reclamation bond attached to the DRMS 112D 

Reclamation Permit in the amount of US$277,078 (Corporate Surety No. 1060997) and which is 

subject to a proposed increase to US$330,000 if the pending Technical Revision 4 is approved as 

submitted/calculated.  

Fortune indicates that it has in place various "agreements" with Ouray County which obviate the 

requirement for any winter road use or maintenance bonds (as were required of the previous 

operator) as associated with usage of county roads accessing the mine. SRK has not verified such 

but presumes the statement to be factually correct.  

Any future exploration activity carried out at the Project site, inclusive of areas external to the 

prescribed permit area boundaries, will be subject to bonding requirements as attached to any 

approved Notice of Intent to Prospect permit administered by DRMS. Typically, such bond amounts 

are minimal and directly related to mitigation of surface disturbance associated with drilling, 

trenching, access road development, etc., as may be necessary in the conduct of exploration 

activities. In this regard, it is indicated that there are two outstanding Notice of Intent to Prospect 

bonds, one for approximately US$12,000 as associated with a total area of approximately 5 acres (or 

less), and one for approximately US$7,000 as associated with approximately 2 acres (or less), 

respectively. SRK has not undertaken to confirm this information but presumes the information to be 

factually correct. 

20.6 Social and Community 
The Project has not been subjected to a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis as the 

Plan of Operations does not incorporate activities on federal lands. Therefore, a formal evaluation of 

social and community impacts has not been completed. 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 131 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

It can be stated, however, that the Project will result in the provision of a significant number of direct 

employment jobs (skilled and unskilled), as well as a resultant multiplier effect for associated goods 

and services in the city of Ouray and the surrounding Ouray County area where a large measure of 

the local/regional economy is traditionally based on recreation and/or tourism. On this basis, the 

prevailing local/regional sentiment is generally favorable toward Project development. 

As with any proposed mine project, there are typically concerns expressed by non-governmental 

organizations (NGOs) or other stakeholder entities, as well as affected individuals. With respect to 

the Revenue Mine Project, identified potential concerns include the potential for increased 

traffic/road usage on the County road extending past the Revenue mine on up to Yankee Boy Basin, 

a popular summer tourist feature. Similarly, increased traffic associated with mine activities will likely 

result in increased fugitive dust emissions along that same route. SRK is not aware of any significant 

local, regional or national-level opposition to the proposed action. 

20.7 Mine Closure 
A mine closure plan has been developed for implementation upon cessation of operations at end of 

mine life.  As indicated below (Section 20.8 – Reclamation Measures during Operations and Project 

Closure), closure of the Revenue and Atlas Waste Piles is planned to occur concurrent with mine 

operations.   

The indicated general closure sequence (following capping of the Atlas Waste Pile and 

decommissioning/salvage of underground equipment) then incorporates backfilling of the 

underground storage and mill portal areas as well as removal of Sediment Pond 1. This is followed 

by removal of certain surface facilities and backfilling of the remaining underground storage portal 

and tailing loadout portal. Once the foregoing activities are accomplished, the site will be graded, 

capped, and revegetated in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. Closure activities are 

anticipated to require approximately 6.5 months duration.  

The Plan of Operations incorporates three ventilation shafts: the 960 Raise, the Yellow Rose shaft, 

and the Monongahela shaft. Each of these features will be closed by cutting the casing below ground 

surface, followed by installation of a steel plate with concrete seal, placement of backfill, and 

topsoiling/revegetation. 

Structures to be removed at the Revenue portal area include: the surface equipment and storage 

shop; mine office; compressor room; dry-room; mill loadout; and structural cribbing. 

Portal areas (inclusive of the mill portal, and underground storage portals) are to be closed by 

placement of waste rock backfill to a distance of approximately 25 ft of the portal crown. The exterior 

face is to be sloped, topsoiled, and seeded. The Revenue Portal will be retained intact to facilitate 

mine discharge, and it is to be affixed with a bat access gate. 

Sediment Pond 1 is to be backfilled following successful revegetation of reclaimed mine areas that 

drain to it. Minor drainage diversions and collection ditches are to be reclaimed as well; however, 

Sediment Pond 2 and the Mine Water Pond are to remain intact following closure (with the Mine 

Water Pond being the post-closure receiving body for the Revenue portal discharge. 

Final site grading, topsoiling, and revegetation will incorporate: grading (where feasible) to a 

maximum 3H:1V slope; placement of a topsoil cover (recognizing that topsoil resources are limited at 

the site) to a nominal depth of 12 inches on waste rock features and 6 inches on non-waste

disturbed areas; and, seeding (in accordance with an approved seed mixture). Star acknowledges 

that topsoil importation will be required (due to the limited quantities present and available onsite). To 

address this topsoil deficiency, the Company has determined overall topsoil volume requirements 

over the life-of-mine and established an importation schedule to assure that operations never 

encounter a deficit (shortage) in excess of 4,000 yd3 at any point in time. 

Seeding application is proposed to be accomplished via drill seeding methods, with a specified 

application rate of 15.6 lb/ac pure live seed. If/where broadcast seeding is employed, the application 

rate is to be doubled. The reclamation plan incorporates a species mixture targeted toward 

establishment of high elevation rangeland; however, the Company has indicated that final seed 

mixture determinations will be jointly coordinated with DRMS and Ouray County. 

20.8 Reclamation Measures during Operations and Project Closure 
The indicated reclamation and closure plan associated with Permit M2012-032D addresses 34.19 ac 

of Permit Area with surface disturbance identified in Table 20.8.1: 

Table 20.8.1: Surface Disturbance Permit Area 

Feature/Description Area (acres)
Revenue Waste Pile 7.39 
Atlas Waste Pile (Including Sediment Pond 1) 4.64 
Operations Area 2.35 
Lower Pond Area (Sediment Pond 2 and Mine Water Pond) 1.37 
Slopes Between Operations Area and Lower Pond Area 2.50 
Shaft Collars 0.69 
Atlas Access Road 0.66 
Undisturbed Surface Area Within Permit Boundary 14.59 
Total Permit Area: 34.19

 

The Company proposes to return most of the disturbed area to a post-mine land use classification of 

high elevation rangeland. The "Operations Area" and the Atlas Access Road areas will be left intact 

for future use by the underlying landowner. 

Certain operational components are to be reclaimed concurrently during the operational mine life. 

For example, the Revenue Waste Pile may be used intermittently for the placement of dry stack 

tailing (and limited quantities of waste rock), while capping topsoil will be stored on an interim basis 

at the Atlas Waste Pile. If the Revenue Waste Pile is completed first (to capacity), a 12 inch topsoil 

cover is to be placed, followed by revegetation. Tailing disposal will then reach capacity at the Atlas 

Waste Pile, with interim storage of cover topsoil atop the closed Revenue Waste Pile until (at end of 

mine life) it too is closed, in a similar manner. However, sequencing may be subject to seasonal 

operational constraints as associated with avalanche risk inherent with use of the Revenue waste 

rock facility. 

In general, all remaining disturbance areas will be subject to reclamation only at the end of mine life 

as usage is required during production operations.  

20.9 Closure Monitoring 
Post-closure monitoring will include regular observation and monitoring of revegetation success 

(including prevention of invasive and/or noxious weed species) and minimization of erosion, both of

Preliminary Economic Assessment – The Revenue Mine Page 133 
 
 

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

which must be achieved prior to bond release. An access road will remain in place to facilitate site 

access for monitoring. The Atlas Waste Pile access road is to remain intact as well. 

In addition to the routine reclamation monitoring, the Project will remain subject to monitoring 

obligations as associated with CDPS Permit No.CO0000003 (as pertaining to wastewater discharge 

through Outfall 1A at the Mine Water Pond; and, post-closure monitoring requirements as associated 

with requirements for an "inactive mine" under CDPS Permit No COR040273 (Stormwater Permit – 

General). It should be noted that a prior operator at the site successfully terminated the facility's 

CDPS wastewater discharge permit at conclusion of operations. 

20.10 Reclamation and Closure Cost Estimate 
As indicated above, the reclamation and closure cost estimate as determined by The Company and 

accepted by DRMS has resulted in a current reclamation bond amount of US$277,078. This total 

bond amount may be subject to change over the life-of-mine due to factors that may include 

permitting new areas, changes to the Plan of Operations and/or approved reclamation plan, material 

changes in environmental conditions that have yet to manifest, changes in regulatory requirements, 

and/or inflation,. SRK has not undertaken to examine the calculation of the reclamation bond 

amount; it is presumed sufficient as it has been verified and accepted by DRMS. We note that TR-04 

(approval pending) would result in an increase in the total bond amount to US$330,000, if approved 

as submitted/calculated.

21.4.2 Underground Mining Costs 

Operating costs were developed by Fortune and modified by SRK to be consistent with the 

productions schedule. Cost estimate is based on requirements of equipment, operating labor, 

supervision and administrative labor, mine consumables, maintenance, etc. 

The basis of the operating costs is an owner operated mine. Table 21.4.2.1 summarizes the 

operating costs of the Revenue Mine underground mining costs.

21.4.3 Processing Costs 

Mineral processing costs were developed by Fortune and are based on a production schedule for the 

mine site. Cost estimate is based on requirements of equipment, operating labor, supervision and 

administrative labor, process consumables and maintenance, etc. 

The processing cost is estimated at US$28.60/t of plant feed, which amounts to approximately 

US$25.4 million over the life of mine. 

The basis of the mineral processing costs is an owner operated mine. Tables 21.4.3.1 to 21.4.3.3 

summarize the mineral processing costs of the Revenue Mine.

All concentrates assume 9% moisture content. 

22.3 Main Assumptions 
Common prices for consumables, labor, fuel, lubricants and explosives were used by all engineering 

disciplines to derive capital and operating costs. Included in the labor costs are shift differentials,

vacation rotations, all taxes and the payroll burdens. All currency is in U.S. dollars (US$) unless 

otherwise stated.  

No pre-production period has been considered, as the site is already under development. Mine 

production targets 400 t/d and achieves this rate for five years before ramping down. The mine 

schedule does not include stockpiling as all blending of RoM is done in the mine. Table 22.3.1 

presents the LoM mine assumptions.

*This PEA is preliminary in nature and is based on technical and economic assumptions which will be further evaluated in 
more advanced studies. The PEA is based on a resource model that contains Measured, Indicated and Inferred mineral 
resources. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations 
applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be 
realized.

The processing circuit is designed to recover a lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate and is 

assumed to operate 350 days/yr at a capacity of 400 t/d. A gravity gold circuit is also used at times 

and the concentrate will be delivered to the smelter with the lead concentrate. Table 22.3.2 presents 

the projected LoM plant production.

22.4 Taxes, Depreciation and Royalties 
Total paid taxes are calculated as 40.88% of taxable income, the taxes are composed of the 

following: 

 Federal Income Tax: 34%;  
 State Tax of 4.63%; and 
 Colorado State: 2.25%. 

Overall tax rate calculates to 12.42% of the Project's income. 

A 7-year declining balance depreciation is used in the calculation of taxable income. Existing 

undepreciated assets are also depreciated; the existing undepreciated asset value is US$20 million. 

Deductions for the mineral resource depletion is considered in the taxable income calculation, the 

adopted rate is of 15%, as indicated for a silver deposit in the U.S. 

The project will pay a royalty of 2% over gross income.

22.5 Results 
All results presented herein use a 100% equity basis. 

Results indicate that the Project has a potential after tax present value of approximately 

US$58.8 million, based on a 6% discount rate. Figure 22.5.1 shows the project after-tax metrics.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature, and is based on technical and economic assumptions which will be 

further evaluated in more advanced studies. The PEA is based on a resource model that contains 

Measured, Indicated and Inferred mineral resources. Inferred mineral resources are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

23 Adjacent Properties 
The Project is located in the Mount Sneffels District and there are many adjacent past producers. 

The Smuggler, a past producer, is located on the Telluride side of the ridge to the south of the 

Virginius vein system; the Camp Bird Mine is located approximately 1.3 miles to the east of the 

Project; and the Idarado Mine is located approximately 5 miles southeast of the Project. In addition, 

there are numerous named and unnamed adits within a 5 mile radius of the Project, many of which 

are abandoned.  

Mineralization on these properties is not indicative of mineralization at the Project and there are no 

immediately adjacent properties that have any bearing on the Project.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions  

25.1 Exploration 
The Project has been actively explored through drilling and limited channel sampling. Exploration 

drilling is limited in the Virginius vein because of both surface and underground access. Surface 

access is limited by steep terrain in the area around the Virginius and that the current drilling targets 

are extremely deep. Underground access is limited by the current mine access. Workings that are 

available for drilling would not provide appropriate intercepts on the vein zone. SRK recommends 

that the Company collect confirmation channel samples of the Virginius Veins from the existing 

workings. Drilling to intercept the Virginius vein at an appropriate angle may require additional drifting 

in the footwall.  

25.2 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The mineral resource has been classified as Indicated and Inferred at Virginius based on the age of 

the channel samples and lack of modern confirmation of analytical results. The channel samples 

were not analyzed using a contemporary industry practice QA/QC program. Additional verification is 

necessary to increase confidence in the classification of resources at Virginius. Both Yellow Rose 

and Virginius need verification of the density measurements made by Star. Star used an industry 

standard method but it is industry best practice to have these measurements independently verified 

by a certified commercial laboratory. SRK recommends that Fortune Revenue undertake verification 

of density measurements.   

Silver represents the primary metal in the resource estimate. However, zinc has been reported as 

part of the resource estimate. The resource could be impacted if it is determined that a saleable zinc 

concentrate cannot be produced. Fortune and Star have a contract in place with the smelter in Trail, 

British Columbia Canada to purchase and process the concentrate produced in the mill.  

The current DRMS-permitted product lines are for silver, gold and zinc and the CDPS-permitted 

product lines are for silver, gold, zinc and lead. The differences in the permits will require resolution, 

but copper is not mentioned in either permit. SRK does not anticipate that there would be an issue 

adjusting the permits to include all metals in the resource estimate.  

25.3 Mining 
The available data indicate that underground operations are viable for the Project. The near vertical 

dip of the veins, competent host rock, and existing infrastructure positively influence the Project. 

Additional geotechnical information will be required to determine optimal stope sizes and confirm 

mining methodology. Progress on the Project will be dictated by the development schedule and 

number of operating faces available. The establishment of permanent ventilation and secondary 

egress from both mining areas is a key consideration. The schedule and costs presented herein 

assumes that ventilation/egress is established by November 1, 2014.  If ventilation/egress is not 

constructed in this timeframe, mining will likely be delayed with production schedule and cashflow 

assumptions needing to be updated.

DB/MLM FortuneMinerals_Revenue_PEA_457700.030_014_SH July 23, 2014 

25.4 Metallurgy and Processing 
Historical operations and recent metallurgical studies indicate that material from the Revenue Mine 

can be processed by conventional flotation processes to recover silver and gold in a flotation 

concentrate. 

Filtration studies indicate that some sections of the Mine can be successfully filtered for dry disposal. 

Test samples to date have been limited to bulk samples that were in accessible locations in the 

Mine. Mineralized material samples from other areas of the Mine are required to confirm the recovery 

numbers of 95% for silver, 90% for gold, 80% for copper, 90% for lead and 85% for zinc, which at 

this time may be considered only as estimates for recovery. 

25.5 Environmental 
No major or significant environmental concerns have been identified.  

It appears that potential future permitting issues have been identified and planned for accordingly 

within the scheduled Project life-of-mine to be addressed in a timely fashion. SRK is of the opinion 

that permitting requirements can be achieved in a manner that would not adversely affect Project 

progress or interrupt production continuity. 

SRK notes that the Company indicates the employed flotation processes will incorporate incremental 

recoveries such that the resultant tailing material will be rendered virtually "inert"(with respect to 

residual metal content, metal leaching potential, and reactive sulfide content). To the extent 

recovered, sulfides will therefore be contained within the concentrate, and smelter credits or 

penalties will reflect the "as-received" content of the concentrate. It is anticipated that ongoing 

monitoring of tailing and waste rock materials will demonstrate/confirm the predicted insignificant 

residual metal content and low acid generating potential upon which the "inert" classification is 

predicated. SRK notes that DRMS has incorporated an ongoing monitoring requirement within the 

permit to address this latter issue. Regardless, in the event the virtually "inert" or "neutral metal 

leaching potential" status (as well as desired post-filtration moisture content) is determined to be 

operationally non-achievable, SRK is of the opinion that satisfactory modified engineering controls 

can be implemented relative to tailing disposal, and that such can be readily integrated into existing 

permits through appropriate permit modification processes.

26 Recommendations  

26.1 Exploration and Geology 
SRK makes the following additional exploration recommendations for both Yellow Rose and 

Virginius: 

 Continue infill and step out drilling to explore the vein systems along strike and down dip. 
This may require driving a development drift in the hangingwall of the Virginius vein system; 

 Discontinue the use of pulp blanks and incorporate preparation blanks into the QA/QC 
program; 

 Monitor the QA/QC program as an ongoing process and closely monitor the gold RMs; 
 Add check assays to the QA/QC program. Check assays are second analysis by a second 

laboratory of the original pulp submitted to the primary laboratory; 

 Verify collar locations and elevations for all locatable pre-2012 drillholes; and 
 Develop a geotechnical data collection program to identify changes in rock quality to assist 

in stope design.  

At Yellow Rose, SRK recommends to continue step out and infill drilling to the southeast along the 

trace of the vein within the claim block.  

26.2 Mineral Resource Estimate 
For Resource estimation, SRK recommends that the Company submit a subset of its density 

samples that were measured in-house to an independent laboratory such as ALS for verification. 

Star has used an industry standard method for density measurements, but it is also industry practice 

to have these independently verified. 

At Yellow Rose, SRK recommends that Fortune Revenue construct a clean and verifiable database 

of the historic and copper analysis for use in resource estimation.  

SRK recommends that at Virginius, Fortune Revenue collect representative samples for density 

measurements throughout the deposit collecting both mineralization and wall rock. A sub-set of the 

in-house measurements must be duplicated using an independent laboratory such as ALS as a 

check. SRK recommends that the Company conduct a verification program through drilling and 

channel sampling within the Virginius accompanied by an industry standard QA/QC program. SRK 

also recommends that the Company complete the ongoing reconciliation between historical channel 

samples and drill core, to include nearby drill holes and modern channel samples where modern 

industry QA/QC data has been collected.  

26.3 Mineral Reserve Estimate and Mining 
SRK recommends that the following work be performed as part of the next phase of work: 

 Collection of geotechnical data to support mine design. Once data is collected and analyzed 
the mine design/mining method/stope configurations should be re-evaluated and optimized. 

 Development of a grade control sampling program in order to report accurate grades being 
sent to the mill. This could include sampling along development workings and pre-drilling 

stopes in advance of mining.

 Mine stope design, using stope optimization software, was completed using a cut-off grade 
of US$130/t. Subsequent costing work and capitalization of development shows a variance 

in the operating cost. Additional review of cost should occur and subsequent update of the 

mine design based on a more detailed cut-off grade estimate. 

 Tradeoff study to evaluate truck haulage vs. LHD haulage on the Revenue Virginius lower 
levels.   

 Tradeoff study to evaluate rail vs. small LHD haulage options in the Yellow Rose on the 
upper levels 

 Optimization of the production schedule by delaying development to an as-needed basis.  
Based on additional geotechnical information the stopes may also be scheduled in a 

different order allowing higher grade material to be mined first. 

26.4 Metallurgy 
SRK recommends that additional metallurgical testing be conducted on composites representative of 

the resource. Bulk samples to date have been limited to accessible locations in the mine. Future 

testing should consider: 

 Core that has been drilled and identified as part of the mine plan resource should be 
assembled into composites;  

 The composite samples should be subjected to a full suite of metallurgical tests including 
grindability, flotation and filtration; 

 Flotation tests for the production of either a separate lead/silver concentrate and zinc/silver 
concentrate or a combined lead/silver/zinc bulk concentrate; 

 The existence of gravity gold and the ability to recover the gold; and 
 Coordination with the mine plan to determine the amount of zinc and antimony produced to 

avoid or reduce smelter penalties. 

26.5 Environmental  
Inasmuch as the Project is at this time entering the startup mode, much information is yet to be 

obtained through monitoring and startup observations. Therefore, it is difficult to render significant 

recommendations at this time. 

SRK recommends that ongoing evaluations of tailing and waste rock materials be closely monitored 

to ensure conformance with stipulated permit conditions as related to moisture content, metals 

concentrations (and leaching potential thereof) and acid-generating potential. Inasmuch as tailing 

characteristics are directly related to the specific mineralized material being milled and flotation 

recoveries, the tailing characteristics will differ over time and reflect mill performance (recovery) of 

targeted metal sulfides, both individually and collectively.  

26.6 Costs 
SRK estimates that potential costs for the recommended work programs would be in the order of 

US$4.3 million. A breakdown of the costs estimated for this work is shown in Table 26.1.1. The costs 

for drilling are based on the number of proposed holes, an average of 500 ft at Virginius and 800 ft at 

Yellow Rose and an estimated US$150/ft including analytical.

28 Glossary 

28.1 Mineral Resources 
The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM Standards 

on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (November 27, 2010). Accordingly, 

the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves have been 

classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as defined 

below.  

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic 

material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 

reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological 

characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 

specific geological evidence and knowledge.  

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 

quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 

assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited 

information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 

trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 

sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine 

planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed 

and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 

locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for 

geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated 

with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, 

to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate 

is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that 

are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

28.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate 

information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve 

includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.  

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 

circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility

Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 

economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 

extraction can be justified.  

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate 

information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.
