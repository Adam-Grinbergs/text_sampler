San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

1 . 0  S U M M A R Y  

Geologix Explorations Inc. (Geologix) has requested that Wardrop Engineering Inc. 
(Wardrop) prepare a technical report on the San Agustin project in Durango State, 
Mexico.  The report is to support the release of a new mineral resource estimate by 
Geologix for the San Agustin deposit.  Information and data for the report were 
obtained from site visits by Wardrop on October 28 to 30, 2007 as well as from 
reports received directly from Geologix personnel. 

The San Agustin property consists of two mineral claims located in the northern San 
Lucas de Ocampo District, 4 km north of the village of San Agustin de Ocampo and 
approximately 100 km north of the city of Durango in the state of Durango, Mexico.  
The property is currently the subject of an option agreement between Silver Standard 
Resources Inc. (Silver Standard), Geologix and both of their Mexican subsidiaries, 
giving Geologix the right to purchase a 100% interest in the property.  The San 
Agustin property is easily accessible year round.  

The San Agustin project is comprised of two distinct topographic zones, a central 
zone that consists of low hills with a maximum relief of 100 m, and a flat lying zone 
that forms an apron around the central hills.  A semi-dry climate dominates the San 
Agustin area and rainfall is limited to approximately 500 mm annually.  Electrical 
power from the main grid is currently available in the town on San Agustin, 
approximately 6 km from the property.  

The immediate area of the San Agustin property has a documented exploration 
history of about 25 years.  A few small adits, shafts, and pits focusing on narrow 
veins are situated throughout the project area but actual mining appears to have 
been very limited.  Monarch Resources Ltd. carried out a two-phase drilling program 
in 1997-1998 drilling 65 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes totalling 9,362 m, and 
4 diamond drill holes totalling 1,002 m.  Late in 2003, Silver Standard Mexico S.A. de 
C.V. (SSM) undertook an extensive mapping and sampling program including the 
collection of 1,257 chip samples.  This program was followed up by an RC drilling 
program that consisted of 23 holes totalling 3,890 m.  Most of this work was focused 
on better defining the higher grade areas on Alunite Ridge, now known as the Main 
Zone.  In August 2006, SSM optioned the property to Geologix.  Since entering into 
the option agreement with Silver Standard, Geologix has carried out an ongoing 
exploration program on the San Agustin property.  Work completed to date includes: 

• 19.25 line km of Induced Polarization (IP) survey 

• 135 soil samples 

• 262 rock samples (grab and chip samples) 



 
 

 Geologix Explorations Inc. 2 0753690100-REP-R0002-00 
San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

• continuous chip sampling of 5416.5 m in 25 trenches 

• continuous chip sampling of 898.5 m of road cuts 

• 15,617.55 m of diamond drilling in 71 holes 

• systematic sampling of 95 m of underground workings 

• detailed geological and alteration mapping over 3 km2 

• re-logging of earlier RC drill hole chips and diamond drill core. 

A total of 162 drill holes have been drilled on the property to the end of December 
2007, and were used to complete the estimate on the mineralized zones.  Drilling on 
the project is continuing and the current phase of drilling is expected to be completed 
by the end of the first quarter in 2009. 

The San Agustin property lies in the Altiplano Subprovince of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental (SMO).  The Altiplano Subprovince is on the east flank of the SMO and is 
comprised of Jurassic to Late Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  The oldest 
rocks on the San Agustin area are Cretaceous siltstones, sandstones and 
limestones.  These rocks are unconformably overlain by a thick sequence of Tertiary 
volcanic rocks which characterize the SMO.  The sequence is comprised of an older 
andesite dominated series, and a younger pyroclastic dominated rhyolite series.  
These two main series are referred to as the Lower Volcanic Series (LVS) and Upper 
Volcanic Series (UVS) respectively.   

All geological samples have been collected and handled in a professional manner.  
The practice has been to sample the entire length of all diamond drill holes; sample 
intervals are geologically constrained and are generally determined on the basis of 
sulphide content or lithologic contacts.  Samples vary in length from 0.25 m to 7.2 m, 
although 1.5 m is most common.  Several laboratories have been used over the life 
of the San Agustin project; all have been commercially independent laboratories.  

Geologix commissioned Process Research Associates Ltd. (PRA) of Richmond, B.C. 
to carry out three preliminary metallurgical tests on the San Agustin project.  
Precious metal recoveries of 93-98% for gold and 82-94% for silver occur in rougher 
flotation concentrates regardless of the activation method used in the tests.  Results, 
although preliminary in nature, show recoveries of 91% and 92% for lead and zinc, 
respectively.  

Mineral resources were estimated by Wardrop.  At a US$10 equivalent cutoff, the 
San Agustin property contains approximately 61.8 million tonnes of Indicated mineral 
resources grading 0.511 g/t Au, 12.8 g/t Ag, 0.51% Zn, and 0.05% Pb and 
53.4 million tonnes of Inferred mineral resources grading 0.432 g/t Au, 16.3 g/t Ag, 
0.58% Zn, and 0.09% Pb. 

Higher grade, structurally controlled mineralization associated with the central zone 
of sheeted veins is the focus of the current exploration programs.  Drilling and 



 
 

 Geologix Explorations Inc. 3 0753690100-REP-R0002-00 
San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

surface sampling has confirmed the presence of the structural zone.  Further drilling 
is warranted to delineate the mineralization identified so far on the property. 

Based on the exploration of the property to date and the discovery of a significant 
mineral deposit, the San Agustin property is of sufficient merit to warrant further 
resource definition drilling and exploration.  Wardrop recommends the following work 
program for the property: 

• continued Phase III deposit definition and step out exploration drilling 
totalling 20,000 m 

• carry out an update of the mineral resource estimate to incorporate data 
from the recent drilling program 

• continue metallurgical test work on the mineralization.

Table 4.1 lists the claims and title number of the exploration concessions for the San 
Agustin Property.  The claims have been legally surveyed as required in Mexico.  
The claims are maintained in good standing through semi-annual payments to the 
Mexican government.  The last payment was made in January 2008 to cover the 
period from January 2008 to June 2008; it totalled $5,315 (pesos) or approximately 
C$523.85.  A payment is due in July 2008 to cover the second half of the year and 
the amount will differ slightly from previous payments as the Mexican government 
sets the per hectare rate every six months.  

Industrias Peñoles has four small parcels comprising two claims (MKT-A+B E-30898 
and MKT-A 30986) contained within the San Agustin claims.  Geologix has entered 
into agreements with private individuals who hold two adjacent claims, Consejo 1 E-
2/1.3-1805 and Nuestra Senora del Carmen II T-202148 (Figure 4.2).

4.2.1 SAN AGUSTIN 
The San Agustin and San Agustin I claims are currently the subject of an option 
agreement amongst Silver Standard, Geologix and both of their Mexican 
subsidiaries, giving Geologix the right to purchase a 100% interest in the property.  

To exercise the option, on August 25, 2006, Geologix issued to Silver Standard 
500,000 shares following acceptance for filing of the agreement by the TSX Venture 
Exchange and a further 500,000 shares before the first anniversary of the agreement 
on August 17, 2007.  

Geologix must also incur expenditures of not less than US$2 million on or before the 
second anniversary of the agreement (August 25, 2008), including expenditures of 
not less than US$500,000 on or before the first anniversary and at least 15,000 m of 
drilling by the second anniversary.  As of September 30, 2007, Geologix had incurred 
expenditures of US$2,620,055 thus fulfilling the expenditure obligations.  



 
 

 Geologix Explorations Inc. 9 0753690100-REP-R0002-00 
San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

Upon the earlier of the completion of the drilling obligation or the second anniversary, 
Geologix must, within four months, prepare a National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) 
compliant gold and silver only resource estimate from the existing defined drill plan.  
Geologix shall pay Silver Standard on a sliding scale for each ounce of gold and 
silver in the resource estimate to be contained in the property.   

Based on current metal prices, Geologix would pay US$20/oz of gold and US$1/oz of 
silver for Measured, Indicated, and Inferred resources within the resource estimate.  
If gold trades at US$750/oz or lower at the time of payment, Geologix will pay 
US$15/oz of gold for Measured, Indicated, and Inferred resources within the 
resource estimate.  If silver is trading at US$20/oz or higher at the time of payment, 
Geologix will pay US$1.50/oz of silver for Measured, Indicated, and Inferred 
resources within the resource estimate.  Deducted from the cash portion of the 
purchase price are the expenditures (up to a maximum of US$2,000,000) incurred by 
Geologix in exploring the property and the value of the shares issued to Silver 
Standard (valued at the dates of issuance).  

Geologix shall also grant to Silver Standard a royalty of 2.5% of net smelter returns 
(NSR) applicable to all minerals produced from the property, excluding the gold and 
silver that form the basis for the resource estimate.  The royalty is capped at 2 million 
ounces of gold equivalent, using a 50:1 silver to gold ratio.  

The property is also subject to an underlying finder's fee agreement (La Cuesta 
Royalty), whereby the prospectors are paid 2% of exploration expenditures or 
US$5,000 semi-annually (whichever is greater) and a 0.25% NSR on any production.  
Total payments are capped at US$500,000.  

There are no other known royalties, back-in rights, payments, or agreements and 
encumbrances to which the property is subject.  The property has no known 
environmental liabilities or outstanding issues.   

4.2.2 CONSEJO 
Geologix has entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Consejo 
property from a private landowner.  The option calls for cash payments of 
US$120,000 over a 5 year period.  There are no work commitments or any additional 
payments associated with the option.  There are no royalties associated with the 
option.  

Geologix intends to advance the project with geological mapping and sampling, 
geophysics, trenching, and diamond drilling in 2008. 

4.2.3 EL CARMEN 
Geologix has also entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the El 
Carmen property from a private landowner.  The option calls for cash payments of 
US$300,000 over a 4 year period.  There are no work commitments or any additional

The San Agustin property is easily accessible year round.  Initial access to the area 
can be gained via paved Highway 45 for 90 km north from Durango to San Lucas de 
Ocampo.  San Agustin can be reached from San Lucas de Ocampo by a 10 km all-
weather gravel road.  Dirt roads provide access to flat areas within the mineral claims 
and cat roads allow access to Alunite Ridge, Cerro Alto, and Cerro Halcon.

The San Agustin project is comprised of two distinct topographic zones: a central 
zone that consists of low hills with a maximum relief of 100 m and a flat lying zone 
that forms an apron around the central hills.  Absolute relief varies from 1875 metres 
above mean sea level (masl) in stream gullies to 2000 masl at the top of Cerro Alto.  
Numerous intermittent streams bisect the landscape and drainage is almost fan-like 
away from the central hills to the north.  East of the central hills, drainages are more 
linear and appear to reflect large-scale regional faults.  

Vegetation in the area consists of various species of cactus, mesquite, and other 
thorny bushes.  Fertile areas of the flat-lying fans near prominent streams are under 
cultivation (corn, beans) while the remainder is used as pasture for cattle and burros.  

5 . 3  C L I M A T E  

A semi-dry climate dominates the San Agustin area and rainfall is limited to 
approximately 500 mm annually.  The climate is temperate with an average annual 
temperature of 18°C, maximum temperature reaching 35°C, and minimum 
temperature falling to 2°C.  The rainy season is from June through to August, with 
minimal rainfall occurring from September to May.

Geologix currently rents two bodegas near the project.  One is in San Agustin and is 
used as a logging, core sawing, core storage, and sample sorting facility for material 
from their drilling and trenching programs.  The second, in San Lucas de Ocampo, is 
used for storage of RC chips and sample rejects from earlier drilling campaigns.  The 
company also rents office space and sleeping accommodations from a hotel in 
nearby San Juan Del Rio. 

Electrical power from the main grid is currently available in the town of San Agustin, 
approximately six kilometres from the property.  Power that is more suitable for 
upgrading to a potential mining operation would be available from a power line 
approximately 20 km to the west of the property.  While several small water 
reservoirs are present on the property, most of the water is used (or reserved) by the 
local ejidos and landowners for irrigation and watering livestock.  Wells could be 
easily dug or drilled to access additional water supply as water has been 
encountered in recent diamond drill holes on the property.  

The village of San Agustin (~250 inhabitants) also serves as a small supply of 
unskilled labour for the project as does the town (~1500 inhabitants) of San Juan Del 
Rio.  Mexican geological and technical personnel generally live further from the 
project and work on a rotation basis, staying in San Juan Del Rio.  Staff for mining 
operations would likely have to be rotated in and out from larger centres.  Contract 
services and air transportation are available in the city of Durango.

The immediate area of the San Agustin property has a documented exploration 
history of about 25 years.  A few small adits, shafts, and pits focusing on narrow 
veins are situated throughout the project area but actual mining appears to have 
been very limited. 

Consejo de Recursos Nacional (Mexican government) conducted exploration in the 
south and west parts of the property (now the Consejo Property) in the 1980s, 
focusing on the evaluation of narrow high-grade vein potential.  As reported by 
McLean (1997), the following exploration work was completed:  

• 1:10,000 scale geological mapping 

• 283 m of trenching 

• 872 surface and underground channel samples collected 

• 4,339 m drilled in 35 holes  

• 151 m of underground exploration including a 93 m deep shaft, 27 m of 
drifting, 22 m of cross-cut, and 9 m of raise. 

While the work resulted in a very small mineral resource being estimated for the 
property, none of the data from the estimate is available.  The reliability of the 
estimate could not be verified and was deemed not suitable for public disclosure.  

The El Carmen property, bordering San Agustin on the east, is the site of a few old 
workings of unknown date.  As far as Geologix is aware, it has not seen any modern 
exploration.

In late 1996, Monarch Resources Ltd. (Monarch) acquired 4800 ha in the San 
Agustin area including the current claims.  By early 1997, Monarch had surveyed and 
staked 204 line kilometres of grid, and collected 3,214 soil samples and 209 rock 
chip samples, all of which were analyzed at Bondar Clegg in Vancouver, B.C.  

La Cuesta International Inc. (La Cuesta), original locators of the project working on 
behalf of Monarch, also investigated San Agustin in 1996.  La Cuesta collected 229 
rock samples and 37 stream sediment samples over a pyrite and sericite altered 
datice dome.  The work defined a distinct gold anomalous zone over a 1.5 km2 area.  
Additional silver, lead, zinc, arsenic, and mercury anomalies were also detected.

Monarch carried out a Phase I drilling program between May and July 1997.  The 
program consisted of 36 RC drill holes totalling 3,708 m and 4 diamond drill holes 
totalling 1,002 m.  This program was designed to test 200 ppb to 400 ppb gold 
anomalies in soil and resulted in the identification of significant zones of 
mineralization at Alunite Ridge and Cerro Halcon (Figure 4.2).  In 1998, an additional 
29 RC holes totalling 5,654 m were drilled, concentrating on the further defining the 
zones located in Phase I.  Poorer than expected results from the first 15 holes 
resulted in the program being cancelled after 29 of a planned 55 holes had been 
drilled.  Despite these setbacks, Monarch geologists still proposed completing the 
program and carrying out metallurgical test work consisting of bottle roll and flotation 
tests.  Monarch abandoned the property in 1998 or 1999.

In December 2002, SSM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Silver Standard, located the 
current San Agustin claims, to which they were awarded title in April of 2003.   

Late in 2003, SSM undertook an extensive mapping and sampling program including 
the collection of 1,257 chip samples.  This program was followed up by an RC drilling 
program that consisted of 23 holes totalling 3,890 m.  Most of this work was focused 
in better defining the higher grade areas on Alunite Ridge, now known as the Main 
Zone.  In August 2006, SSM optioned the property to Geologix.

The San Agustin property lies in the Altiplano Subprovince of the SMO.  The SMO is 
a regionally extensive Eocene to Miocene volcanic field that extends from the US-
Mexico border to Central Mexico.  The Altiplano Subprovince is on the east flank of 
the SMO and is comprised of Jurassic to Late Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic 
rocks.  

The oldest rocks on the San Agustin area are Cretaceous siltstones, sandstones, 
and limestones.  These rocks are unconformably overlain by a thick sequence of 
Tertiary volcanic rocks which characterize the SMO.  The sequence is comprised of 
an older andesite dominated series and a younger pyroclastic dominated rhyolite 
series.  These two main series are referred to as the LVS and UVS, respectively.  

The LVS can attain thicknesses of 1,000 m and is dominated by Paleocene and 
Eocene andesitic lava and pyroclastic rocks with volcaniclastic interbeds.  These are 
extensively exposed to the southwest of San Agustin near San Lucas de Ocampo, 
and several kilometres to the northwest of San Agustin.  The LVS is cut by calc-
alkaline dacite to rhyodacite intrusive rocks that occur as domes, sills, and dykes.  
The UVS unconformably overlies the LVS rocks and can be up to 1,000 m thick.  It is 
dominated by Oligocene and Early Miocene dacite-rhyolite pyroclastic units.  
Precious metal deposits generally tend to occur in the Lower Series rocks with the 
Upper Series being largely devoid of precious metals mineralization. 

7 . 2  P R O P E R T Y  G E O L O G Y  

The San Agustin property is underlain by three main rock types: Cretaceous 
sedimentary rocks, the dacite dome complex, and Tertiary felsic extrusive rocks. 

The Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are comprised of thinly bedded siltstones and 
lesser limestone that occur as rafts within the dacite dome complex.  While 
orientation of these rafts is variable, the larger blocks exposed are mostly aligned 
with a south-easterly strike and near vertical dips (Barclay, 2007).  The siltstone is 
generally grey to maroon with hematite staining and limonite coatings on fractures 
and is calcareous in some localities (MacLean, 1997). 

The dacite dome complex is the main rock type of interest and underlies a majority of 
the property.  It is exposed sporadically and typically forms areas of low relief.  



 
 

 Geologix Explorations Inc. 16 0753690100-REP-R0002-00 
San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

During Monarch's mapping, four phases were identified within the dacite dome 
complex and described by MacLean (1997):  

1) massive porphyritic dacite 

2) flow banded porphyritic dacite 

3) brecciated massive porphyritic dacite 

4) pebble dykes with sub-rounded fragments. 

MacLean (1997) provides a detailed description of the first phase:  

"The massive porphyritic dacite is typically grey to mauve with phenocrysts 
of altered feldspar in a fine grained matrix of mostly quartz.  Sericite 
alteration is ubiquitous and biotite books are completely replaced.  This 
dacite is commonly fractured with hematite and limonite coating fractures 
and also as stockwork veinlets.  Sulphide content varies from 1-20%, which 
is indicated by oxidized veinlets and boxwork textures of cubic casts where 
pyrite and possible other sulphides have been leached.  Where the original 
sulphide content approached 20%, the dacite has a strong mauve tint.  
Volumetrically, this phase represents about 70% of dacite exposed in the 
center part of the grid." 

Flow banded rhyolite occurs throughout the dacite exposure, comprising 
approximately 15% of the exposed rock, but is most prominent along the eastern 
flank of Cerro Halcon.  It is banded on a centimetre-scale and displays variable 
orientations from flat to nearly vertical.  Banding is often accentuated by purple pyrite 
casts as sulphide mineralization appears to have been aligned along the flow 
banding.  Carapace breccias have been developed locally. 

Brecciated massive porphyritic dacite is common throughout the dome complex and 
comprises approximately 10% of the exposure.  It is very similar to the massive 
dacite but has been fractured and clasts have undergone minor rotation and/or 
displacement (MacLean, 1997). This material may represent flow or carapace 
breccia (Burk, 2005).  

The final phase of the dacite dome complex is represented by small pebble dykes 
found throughout the complex.  Where seen in exposure, these rarely exceed 5 m2 in 
size and in some cases form narrow vertical pipes cross-cutting the massive dacite.  
They typically contain sub-rounded to rounded clasts of light grey dacite up to 25 cm 
in diameter in a fine- grained siliceous matrix.  Usually they are clast-supported but 
locally may be matrix-supported.  Fine-grained, un-oxidized pyrite is commonly 
disseminated throughout the matrix.   

Tertiary felsic welded tuffs belonging to the UVS, which are post mineral, outcrop to 
the south of Alunite ridge and Cerro Halcon, near the southern boundary of the 
property.  This unit consists of flat lying, maroon-pink welded rhyolite tuff and 



 
 

 Geologix Explorations Inc. 17 0753690100-REP-R0002-00 
San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

pumaceous tuff.  It is typically found capping small hills that appear to overly the 
dacite.  

Quaternary cover overlies most of the flat low lying areas of the property.  

7 . 3  S T R U C T U R E  

Two main structural trends have been identified in the San Agustin area: northwest 
(320 degrees) trending lineaments and northeast (050 to 060 degrees) trending 
lineaments, both subvertical.  Some of these are likely faults which juxtapose UVS 
rocks against the dacite dome/sedimentary rocks of the LVS.  Definitive offsets have 
not yet been identified or recognized.  Mineralization on the property appears to be 
related to or associated with the northeast trending structures.   

All units on the property are fractured.  A report documenting oriented core and 
outcrop data by Barclay (2007) confirmed the primary NE-SW and NW-SW trends as 
well as identified additional fracture sets in N-S, E-W, and horizontal orientations.  
The trends identified were independent of fracture filling so fracture filling mineralogy 
cannot be used to identify or weight gold-silver or base metal potential in any of the 
fracture trends.

San Agustin is a low grade, primarily intrusive and secondarily sediment hosted 
Au-Ag-Pb-Zn mineral system, characterized by stockwork hosted and, to a lesser 
extent, disseminated mineralization.  The deposit is similar to several breccia hosted 
deposits found near intrusions in the Sierra Madre area as described by Greybeal 
(1981).  These are most often hosted in felsic volcanic and sedimentary rocks; they 
show a strong spatial association to intrusive rocks and are characterized by silica-
sericite-pyrite alteration.  In addition to silver, it may contain variable quantities of 
gold, lead, zinc, and manganese.  Examples of these deposits include the Creede in 
Colorado, the Candelaria in Nevada, and the Tombstone deposit in Arizona.

Two main zones of precious and base metal mineralization have been outlined on 
the San Agustin property.  One passes through Cerro Encino and is comprised of the 
Main Zone and Zone 2; the other trends along the southern flank of Cerro Halcon 
and is comprised of Zone 4.  The two zones are sub-parallel and trend in a NE-SW 
(050-060) direction (Figure 4.2).  Mineralization, as defined to date, is largely 
horizontal and could be described as irregular blankets covering at least 1,100 m 
strike extent and up to 350 m widths over Zone 2 and the Main Zone, and 600 m by 
350 m in Zone 4.  Thicknesses vary from a few metres to over 200 m.  In some areas 
it appears that there are possible steeply dipping feeder zones at depth; however, 
deep drilling is needed to more fully explore this idea.   

Both trends, which cut across geological units, remain open in several directions and 
require additional drilling to fully define strike, width, and depth extents.  Current data 
suggests that the Main Zone and Zone 4 are actually joined together.   

Several additional zones of mineralization have recently been discovered on the 
property through extensive trenching programs.  At present, the extent of these 
discoveries is not well known. 

9 . 1  M I N E R A L I Z A T I O N   

The mineralized zones themselves are defined largely by relatively close spaced 
stockwork veinlets, many of which parallel the large scale regional trends of NE-SW 
and NW-SE.  In the oxide portion of the zones, which extend from 30 to 60 m below 
surface, the stock work is expressed as hematite and limonite veinlets and fracture 
coatings.  Locally, manganese oxides and jarosite can also be present.  In the 
deeper sulphide portions of the zones, the stockwork veinlets are composed mainly 
of pyrite.  Lesser dark red to black sphalerite is also present either with pyrite or in 
separate veinlets.  Even smaller amounts of galena, chalcopyrite, and arsenopyrite 
occur locally.  Disseminated pyrite and sphalerite are present also.  Limited polished 
thin section analyses have confirmed these sulphide minerals and, in addition, 
detected traces of covellite, tetrahedrite, and possibly argentite.  

The sulphide veinlets are most commonly 0.5 to 1.0 cm wide and often show open 
space filling textures.  They comprise roughly 5% of lower grade intervals and up to 
25% of higher grade intervals (Burk, 2005).  More rarely, semi-massive to massive 
veins of pyrite up to 80 cm in true width are present, probably representing stronger 
structural and/or feeder zones in the stockwork system.  Breccia zones also carry 
similar quantities of sulphide minerals.

San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

There is a basic paragenetic sequence consisting of early pyrite veins, followed by a 
quartz-pyrite-sphalerite phase with deposition either being in fractures in the early 
pyrite veins or remaining open space, or in new fractures.  Late sparry calcite forms a 
final type of fracture filling; again, either as a final open space fill in earlier veins or in 
new fractures.  This sequence has been observed in several places in the deposit 
either as successive in fill or as cross-cutting vein sets.  

9 . 2  A L T E R A T I O N  

Three main alteration facies are present at San Agustin: quartz-sericite-pyrite (QSP), 
argillic, and propylitic.  In the central part of the dacite dome, complex QSP alteration 
is very strong with silica primarily in the form of replacements and flooding, and 
sericite replacing biotite books and feldspars such that it may comprise 40% of the 
rock.  The dacite commonly has a bleached appearance.  

Surrounding the zone of QSP alteration is a generally concentric ring of argillic 
alteration 300 m to 500 m wide.  It is manifested as weak to moderate clay alteration 
of feldspars, and weak clay development and bleaching of the sedimentary rocks.  
Propylytic alteration is commonly found along the flanks of the dacite, characterized 
by maroon to dark green colors.

A total of 161 drill holes have been drilled on the property to the end of December 
2007 and were used to estimate the mineralized zones.  Of these, 87 were RC drill 
holes drilled by either Monarch or Silver Standard.  The remainder are diamond drill 
holes completed by Geologix with the exception of four diamond drill holes (SA-36 to 
SA-39) drilled by Monarch.  Drilling on the project is continuing and this current 
phase of drilling is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter in 2009.  
The drill hole data is summarized in Table 11.1 below.

The initial RC drilling program in 1997 by Monarch utilized an Ingersol-Rand TH-100 
drill with a 750 cfm and 350 psi compressor.  For the 1998 program, the same drill 
with a 900 cfm compressor was used initially; however, as strong water flow was 
being encountered in many holes below a depth of 70 m, the drill rig was exchanged 
for an Ingersol-Rand TH-75 drill rig with a 1,200 cfm compressor.  

The 1997 diamond drilling was carried out with a skid mounted CS-1000 rig drilling 
HQ size core.  

It is not known what kind of RC drill rig was used for Silver Standard's drilling 
program in 2004.

All the Geologix drilling is carried out by Intercore Limited using a skid mounted 
diamond drill producing HQ sized core.  Where difficult drilling conditions have been 
encountered, core size is usually reduced to NQ diameter in order to advance the 
hole to its target depth and continue collecting core.

11.3.1 COLLAR LOCATIONS AND ORIENTATIONS 
There is no documentation for methods of drill site location and surveying for any of 
the Monarch or Silver Standard drill holes.  For most holes, a cement plug or block 
was poured around the casing indicating hole position. 

Layout of drill hole locations by Geologix has been by hand-held Global Positioning 
System (GPS) units with an accuracy of 2 to 4 m.  The collar marked by plastic PVC 
piping that is left in the hole is picked up again by hand-held GPS after drilling is 
completed.  

Geologix has had several control points surveyed around the area and most drill hole 
collars have now been located using a total station.  

11.3.2 DOWN HOLE SURVEYS 
No down hole surveys were collected during the Monarch and Silver Standard drilling 
programs.  As a majority of these holes were drilled to depths of less than 200 m and 
all were at angles of greater than -50, combined with the thicker RC drill string, down 
hole deviation was probably minimal.  

Geologix has been collecting down hole survey information at approximately every 
50 m using a digital Reflex down hole survey instrument. 

11.3.3 TOPOGRAPHY  
CartoData of Zapopan (Jalisco State, Mexico) surveyed the topography at San 
Agustin with aerial photogrammetry in 2006, covering an area of approximately 
6.5 km2 over the central portion of the property.  Digital topographic contour lines are 
available for the project area at 1 m intervals.

11.4.1 RC LOGGING 
Monarch and Silver Standard did not document RC chip logging procedures; 
however, data on chip quality (size), color, alteration, pyrite content, and rock type 
were collected and entered in handwritten logs.  



 
 

 Geologix Explorations Inc. 24 0753690100-REP-R0002-00 
San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

The 23 holes drilled by Silver Standard in 2005 were never formally logged.  Chip 
samples were collected and given sample numbers that included depth and drill hole 
number.  Geologix has re-logged the chips from these holes using the same logging 
form and criteria as for diamond drill core, which is described below.  

11.4.2 CORE LOGGING PROCEDURES  
The initial eight holes (Phase I) drilled by Geologix using oriented core methods for 
structural control.  They were then logged using hand written methods.  Data 
collected included basic lithology, alteration, sulphide content, and fracture intensity.  
Basic geotechnical data was also collected.  

All holes for the second phase of drilling are logged directly into a digital logging 
sheet in order to facilitate quicker and easier transfer of data from the site to the 
Vancouver office and entry into the San Agustin database.  Data on lithology, 
structure, alteration, and mineralogy is routinely recorded using text, numeric codes, 
or percentages, along with some basic geotechnical data.  Prior to being sampled, 
each box of core is photographed using a digital camera and the photos are 
downloaded to the main office computer in San Juan.  

The final logs include a header sheet with collar coordinates and down hole survey 
data.  Assay results for samples and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 
materials are entered when received.

Over the course of the project, a large number of rock samples have been gathered 
from outcrop, old workings, and trenches.  There is no documentation of rock sample 
collection methodology for the Monarch programs.  

Silver Standard, as documented by McCrea (2004), collected rock samples along 
lines laid out on surface exposures of interest.  Individual chip samples were 
collected over widths of 2.5 to 4.0 m using a hammer and chisel.  Chips were 
collected in a manner that was thought to be representative of the interval being 
sampled, then placed in a plastic sample bag, and secured.  Samples were stored in 
the San Agustin bodega until being delivered to the lab in Durango.   

Geologix carried out an extensive trenching program in 2007 totalling approximately 
5,000 m.  Samples were usually collected over 3.0 m lengths, although shorter 
intervals were sampled when geological boundaries were present.  Continuous chips 
were collected from bedrock and placed in a sample bag, which was then secured 
with a plastic zip tie.  Samples were then transported to the San Agustin bodega and 
placed in rice bags that were secured with a numbered security tag.  Samples were 
stored until staff from the ALS-Chemex facility in Guadalajara picked them up and 
transported them to the lab.

During the Monarch RC programs, samples were collected at the drill immediately 
below the cyclone every 2 or 3 m using a Standard Gilson splitter (MacLean, 1997).  
It was carried out on this basis from the start to the end of the hole irrespective of 
geological, alteration, or mineralogical boundaries.  When water was encountered, a 
rotary/wet splitter was used.  Samples were split in half with one portion going to the 
lab (approximately 20 kg) while the other was stored in the bodega near the village of 
San Agustin. 

In 2005, Silver Standard collected samples at the drill on one metre intervals.  
According to McCrea (2005), the sample interval was dependent on the drilling 
equipment used and not based on geological controls or other features of interest.  
The samples were split three times using a Jones splitter down to 1/8 size, resulting 
in samples that weighed from 2 to 10 kg.  All samples were stored in the company 
warehouse (bodega) until staff from the ALS-Chemex facility in Guadalajara picked 
them up and transported them to the lab.

The practice is to sample the entire length of all diamond drill holes at San Agustin.  
Sample intervals are geologically constrained and are generally determined on the 
basis of sulphide content or lithologic contacts.  Samples vary in length from 0.25 m 
to 7.2 m, although 1.5 m is most common, particularly for long intervals of more or 
less consistent mineralization.  

Sample intervals are marked on the core boxes by the geologist during core logging.  
The core is sawn in half longitudinally using a gas-powered diamond blade saw.  
One half is bagged for analysis and the bag secured with a zip tie; the other half is 
returned to the core box and kept as a permanent record.  

Samples are placed in rice bags, which are secured with a numbered security zip tie.  
The samples are stored in the bodega until all samples from at least one and usually 
two entire drill holes are present.  The samples are then picked up by staff from the 
ALS-Chemex sample preparation facility in Guadalajara and transported to the lab.  
Using this procedure, all samples from a single drill hole usually appear on the same 
assay certificate.

Table 12.1 summarizes the more significant drill results from the Geologix program 
that have been released to date.  Additional assay results are pending release and a 
large number of samples are currently in the lab for analysis.  Assay intervals are 
stated as core lengths; the true thickness of the mineralized intervals have not been 
determined as of yet.  The mineralized zone is complex but interpreted to be mostly 
horizontal and drill holes are at a -55° dip, which would return a true width of the 
mineralized zone of about 58% of the core lengths (Figure 12.1).

Several laboratories have been used over the life of the San Agustin project.  For the 
first 68 holes drilled by Monarch, analysis of samples was performed by Bondar-
Clegg & Company (Bondar-Clegg) of North Vancouver, B.C.  Silver Standard sent 
surface rock samples to Rocky Mountain Geochemical in Nevada and RC samples to 
Chemex in North Vancouver, B.C.  All samples from the GIX trenching and diamond 
drilling programs were sent to ALS-Chemex of North Vancouver, B.C.  

1 3 . 1  S A M P L E  P R E P A R A T I O N    

Monarch's RC drilling samples were prepared and analyzed at Bondar-Clegg.  The 
samples were weighed and dried before being crushed to 70% passing -10 mesh 
(2 mm).  A 250 gram sub-sample was then split off and pulverized in its entirety to 
75% to -200 mesh (75 microns). 

Surface rock samples collected by Silver Standard were forwarded to BSI 
Inspectorate de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. in Durango for preparation (McCrea, 2004).  
Samples were crushed to -10 mesh and a 300 gram split was retrieved using a riffle 
splitter for preparation of a pulp.  The pulps were shipped to Rocky Mountain 
Geochemical for analysis.  

Samples from Silver Standard's RC drill holes and from the GIX trenching and 
diamond drilling programs were first sent to the ALS-Chemex preparation lab in 
Guadalajara where they were weighed then dried before being crushed to 70% 
passing -10 mesh (2 mm).  A 250 gram sub-sample was then split off and pulverized 
in its entirety to 85% passing - 200 mesh (75 microns).  The pulps were then shipped 
to the ALS-Chemex facility in North Vancouver, B.C., for completion of analytical 
work.

QA/QC from the initial Monarch and Silver Standard programs is limited.  Some 
check assays were submitted by Monarch at the end of their Phase I program 
covering the first 35 RC holes.  Silver Standard reportedly sent field duplicates from 
their RC holes to BSI Inspectorate in Durango; however, no data has been located. 
Fortunately, previous operators properly stored reject material from most holes drilled 
on the property.  A selection representing 5% of those samples was submitted by 
Geologix for assaying with standards included. 

QA/QC was implemented during the Geologix Phase I diamond drilling program in 
2007 whereby standards and blanks were routinely inserted.  The program was 
further strengthened at the start of Phase II when duplicates were included in the 
program and submissions of samples for check assays from both Phase I and 
Phase II were made to Acme Analytical Laboratories.  

Geologix regularly reviewed the assay results of the QC samples and, as a result, 44 
samples were re-assayed by Chemex.  In most cases, mistakes were due to 
mis-sequencing or mis-labelling and were corrected. 

Wardrop reviewed the results of the various QC programs and concluded that the 
historical and recent sampling were acceptable for the purpose of resource 
estimation.

13.3.1 RE-ASSAY OF MONARCH AND SILVER STANDARD REJECTS (2007) 
Previous check assay programs did not cover the Monarch Phase II and Silver 
Standard drilling programs.  As reject material from these programs was stored, 
Geologix collected a total of 182 samples for re-assay.  For each sample, the rejects 
were homogenized, then halved and quartered as necessary to obtain a minimum of 
250 g for a new split.  Standards were inserted randomly in every 20 samples.  The 
samples were analyzed by ALS-Chemex in Vancouver.  

13.3.2 GEOLOGIX STANDARDS 
Geologix used commercially prepared standards provided by CDN Labs, Rocklabs 
and Oreas.  Standards were inserted with each batch of samples shipped to the lab 
at a rate of one standard for approximately every 20 samples (Figure 13.1).  Only 
rarely and with no systematic pattern did assay results of the standards fall outside of 
three times the standard deviation of the expected round robin value for the 
standard.  In some cases these samples were reassayed.  

13.3.3 GEOLOGIX BLANK 
Geologix used pre-packaged sand designed for pool filters as a blank.  While results 
suggest it is analytically blank, the material is quite fine in size and as such passed 
through the crusher and really only tested the pulverization stage of sample 
preparation for contamination.  A coarser material is recommended to act as an 
effective blank to test all stages of sample preparation. 

13.3.4 GEOLOGIX CHECK ASSAY PROGRAM 
Geologix submitted a selection of 5% of all samples from its diamond drilling 
programs as check samples or duplicates at a second lab.  A total of 164 samples 
were selected and standards inserted randomly in every 20 samples.  They were 
submitted for analysis to Acme Analytical Laboratories of Vancouver for analysis 
(Figure 13.2).

Wardrop visited the property on October 28 and 29, 2007.  During the site visit, at 
least 20 drill collars were located by GPS; surface geology was examined as well as 
property access and infrastructure.  Drill core was examined for the Main and No. 4 
zones and four representative samples were collected for assay. Samples were 
collected from representative drill intersections to verify the tenor of mineralization.  
The intent of the check sampling was not to verify the accuracy of the Geologix 
assays values but to confirm that mineralization was present in grades similar to 
what had been reported by Geologix.  The check samples (Table 14.1) returned 
values that compare well with the values reported by Geologix.

Wardrop also validated the digital database by carrying out a random check of about 
20% of the assay data against original assay sheets provided by the assay lab.  
Wardrop also carried out a 100% check of the database for interval overlaps, 
negative intervals, and erroneous outliers (values greater than 100%). 

Only a few minor errors were identified and corrected, Wardrop concluded that the 
database was adequate for resource estimation purposes and that the work being 
carried out by Geologix was in keeping with all industry standards.

Approximately 15 km northeast of San Agustin is Castle Gold Corporation's El 
Castillo Mine (formerly known as El Cairo).  This open pit heap leach operation is 
forecast to go in production in 2009 exploiting an oxidized high sulphidation 
epithermal system.  The mineralization is hosted in silicified, argillized and pyrtitic 
mantos developed in volcaniclastic rocks and adjacent dacitic sills.

Geologix commissioned PRA of Richmond, B.C. to carry out four preliminary 
metallurgical tests on the San Agustin project.  Composite core samples from the 
Main Zone, Zone 4, and Zone 2.  Results of the tests are discussed below.

Precious metal recoveries of 93-98% for gold and 82-94% for silver occur in rougher 
flotation concentrates regardless of the activation method used in the tests.  
Additionally, recoveries remained similar regardless of high, medium, or low head 
grades.  This indicates that, regardless of grade, if precious metals are present, 
flotation captures the metals to the concentrate.  Results of the four flotation tests are 
summarized in Table 16.1.

Base metal test work was divided into a series of different flotation methods 
(Table 16.2).  Test #1 attempted to float metals separating gold and silver from the 
zinc concentrate.  Recoveries of 84% and 64% for lead and zinc, respectively, were 
achieved.  Test #2 was a simple flotation test designed to recover all metals in a

Cyanidation recovery test work was conducted on the Main Zone gold and silver 
mineralization by grinding to 80% passing 200 mesh using 96 hour bottle roll tests.  
Oxide recovery was 87% and 53% for gold and silver, respectively, indicating that 
heap leaching the oxide material may be a viable method (Table 16.3).  In the 
sulphide zones, gold and silver recoveries decrease at depth indicating that a finer 
grind may be required for gold and silver liberation deeper in the sulphide zone.

Mineral resources at the San Agustin Project were estimated by Wardrop with the 
use of 3D geological modelling software, GEMS Version 6.1.3, provided by Gemcom 
Software International.  Resources were estimated by Mr. Michael Waldegger then 
verified and validated by Dr. Gilles Arseneau, P.Geo., Manager of Geology at 
Wardrop. 

1 7 . 1  E X P L O R A T O R Y  D A T A  A N A L Y S I S  

Wardrop received text files with drill hole collar locations, borehole deviation survey, 
assay data and geology for the Phase II drilling campaign.  Each dataset was 
formatted and appended to the GEMS database provided by Geologix.  

Drill hole collar locations from the historical drilling were resurveyed by Geologix.  In 
total, 140 drill hole collars have been located using high accuracy GPS and 26 holes 
were located by handheld GPS. 

Wardrop verified approximately 20% of the assay database records against the 
original paper assay certificates for both the historical and current drilling.  A line 
error rate of 0.1% (4 line errors out of 3,229 lines) was observed.  Also, the values for 
zinc in drill hole SA-161 were observed to have the same values as lead.  The entire 
database was subsequently checked for this type of error and none were observed.  
All errors were corrected in the drill hole database. 

Wardrop concluded that the assay and survey database was sufficiently free of error 
to be adequate for resource estimation of the San Agustin deposit. 

17.1.1 ASSAYS 

Wardrop determined that there were differences in the silver and lead assay values 
between the different companies drilling campaigns.  The silver and lead assay 
values were appreciably higher in Geologix's samples as compared to Monarch and 
Silver Standard samples.  The differences were attributed to the fact that historical 
drilling did not sample Zone 2 which has elevated silver and lead assays.  
Descriptive statistics on assay data are presented in Table 17.1 and Table 17.2.

17.1.2 CAPPING 

Grade capping was considered and evaluated by examining the cumulative 
frequency distribution, histograms, and decile analysis for gold, silver, lead, and zinc.  
Wardrop capped 27 gold assays to 9 g/t and 41 silver assays to 300 g/t.  Wardrop 
decided not to apply grade capping to lead and zinc assays because the assay data 
were observed to be lognormally distributed and did not appear to reflect multiple 
populations or contain significant high-grade outliers. 

17.1.3 COMPOSITES 

A total of 4,845 composites from 126 drill holes were generated within the wireframes 
representing the mineralized zones (Table 17.3).  Figure 17.1 illustrates the 
frequency of various sample lengths in the assay database before compositing.

Assays were composited to a fixed length of three metres within the wireframe 
representing the mineralized zone.  Composites were generated starting from the 
collar of the drill hole downwards and incorporated all assay data.  Composite 
lengths were interrupted at wireframe contacts.  Composited grades were used for 
the grade interpolation in the block model.  Descriptive statistics on composited data 
are presented in Table 17.3.

Density determinations were carried out on 137 core sample from 26 diamond drill 
holes by Geologix.  Wardrop estimated a global bulk density by averaging all 
measurements within a given rock type and determined that the oxide mineralized 
material has a bulk density of 2.4 t/m3 and the sulphide mineral zone has a bulk 
density of 2.76 t/m3.

Three mineralized zones were interpreted by Geologix on the basis of dollar 
equivalent value.  The dollar value was estimated by using metal prices of $550/oz 
gold, $10/oz silver, $0.5/lb lead, $1/lb zinc, and assuming 100% recovery for all 
metals.  Polylines representing a US$10 cutoff were generated on northwest sections 
at 50 m intervals.  The polylines honoured the drill hole assay boundaries in 3D.  
Wireframes were generated from the lines and then clipped against the overburden-
bedrock surface (Figure 17.2).  Mineralization within a fault zone separating the Main 
Zone from Zone 2 was modelled separately using the same dollar equivalent 
parameters.  A surface representing the oxide-sulphide boundary was modelled by 
laplace gridding of drillhole intersections with the sulphide zone.

Geostatisticians use a variety of tools to describe the pattern of spatial continuity, or 
strength of the spatial similarity of a variable with separation distance and direction.  
The correlogram measures the correlation between data values as a function of their 
separation distance and direction.  The distance at which the correlogram reaches 
the maximum variance is called the "range of correlation" or simply the range.  The 
range of the correlogram corresponds roughly to the more qualitative notion of the 
"range of influence" of a sample; it is the distance over which sample values show 
some persistence or covariance 

Using Sage 2001 software, variography was completed for each commodity for all 
zones combined at San Agustin.  Directional sample correlograms were calculated 
along horizontal azimuths of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, and 
330 degrees.  For each azimuth, sample correlograms were also calculated at dips of 
30 and 60 degrees in addition to horizontally.  Lastly, a correlogram was calculated in 
the vertical direction.  Using the 24 correlograms, an algorithm determined the best-
fit model.  This model is described by the nugget (C0), two nested structure variance 
contributions (C1, C2), ranges for the variance contributions and the model type 
(spherical or exponential).  After fitting the variance parameters, the algorithm then 
fits an ellipsoid to the 48 ranges from the directional models for each structure.  The 
final models of anisotropy are given by the lengths and orientations of the axes of the 
ellipsoids.  

Correlograms were calculated for gold, silver, lead, and zinc.  The correlograms were 
modelled with a nugget and two nested spherical structures for gold, silver, and zinc 
and with a nugget and only one spherical structure for lead (Table 17.4).

The block model project was prepared as a partial model and contains a folder for 
each of the modelled wireframes (Waste, Main Zone, Zone 2, Zone 4, Fault Zone).  
The project also includes a combined Ore folder, which is a weighted average of all 
the mineralized zones, and an overall Standard folder that also contains waste 
grades and is a diluted model. 

The Ore, Waste and Standard folders contain the following block models: rock type, 
percent, density, class, gold grade (capped and uncapped), silver grade (capped and 
uncapped), lead grade, and zinc grade. 

The folders for Main Zone, Zone 2, Zone 4 and Fault Zone contain only rock type and 
percent models. 

17.5.1 ROCK TYPE MODEL 

The rock type model was coded with integer rock codes from the modelled 3D 
wireframes as described in Table 17.6.  Unless otherwise stated, the selection of 
blocks for coding was based on the block being more than 0.001% by volume within 
a wireframe using a needling accuracy of nine needles per block oriented vertically.

Rock type models in each of the folders (Waste, Main Zone, Zone 2, Zone 4, Fault 
Zone) were prepared in the following sequence: 

1. All blocks in the model were initialized to air, rock code 0. 

2. All blocks in the model were re-coded using the wireframes.  Precedence 
was assigned to the mineralized zones over the unclipped waste solid. 

The rock type model in the Ore folder was prepared in the following sequence to 
optimize the blocks for mineralized material: 

1. All blocks in the model were initialized to air, rock code 0. 

2. All blocks within the wireframes representing the mineralized zones were re-
coded as 100. 

3. All mineralized blocks greater than 50% below the oxide-sulphide surface 
were re-coded to 200. 

The rock type model in the Standard folder was prepared in the following sequence 
to optimize the blocks for mineralized material: 

1. All blocks in the model were initialized to air, rock code 0. 

2. All blocks within the waste wireframe unclipped to the mineralized zones 
were re-coded as 99. 

3. All blocks within the wireframes representing the mineralized zones were re-
coded as 100. 

4. All ore blocks greater than 50% below the oxide-sulphide surface were re-
coded to 200. 

17.5.2 PERCENT MODEL 

The percent model represents the volume of a wireframe contained within any given 
block.  The percent model can be used to weight the volume of each block during 
resource reporting in order to estimate an accurate tonnage of mineralized material 
within the model. 

A needling accuracy level of nine needles per block oriented vertically was used to 
generate the percent models.  A value was assigned to a block if 0.001% of its 
volume was contained within a wireframe. 

Percent models in each of the folders (Waste, Main Zone, Zone 2, Zone 4, Fault 
Zone) were updated using the wireframes.  Precedence was assigned to the 
mineralized zones over the unclipped waste solid. 

The percent model in the Ore folder was then calculated by summing the percent 
models from the Main zone, Zone 2, Zone 4 and Fault folders as described above.

San Agustin Resource Estimate – July 2008   
 

The percent model in the Standard rock type folder was calculated by summing the 
percent models from the Ore folder and the Waste folder.  It was used only as a 
check to ensure that no block totalled greater than 100%. 

17.5.3 DENSITY MODEL 

The density model was updated by rock type as outlined in Table 17.7.

Gold, silver, lead and zinc grades were interpolated into blocks using ordinary 
kriging.  

The grades for gold, silver, and lead were interpolated into the mineralized zones 
using all composites irrespective of its domain, as summarized in Table 17.8.  
However, the grades for zinc were interpolated into the oxide blocks using 
composites coded from the oxide zone and into sulphide blocks using composites 
coded from the sulphide zone, thereby treating the oxide sulphide surface as a hard 
boundary for zinc grades.

Interpolation was carried out in two passes using a different search ellipse for each 
pass as outlined in Table 17.9.  For both passes, grades were interpolated only if 6 
samples from at least 3 holes were found within the search ellipse, and no more than 
2 samples per hole or 12 samples in total were used to interpolate grade within a 
block.  Pass two only interpolated grades into blocks that had not been interpolated 
during the first pass interpolation.

A dollar equivalent was calculated for each mineralized block by performing a simple 
manipulation of the block model parameters based on prices and recovery rates as 
listed in Table 17.10 and the following formula: 

USD EQ = Au (g/t) x 17.1 + Ag (g/t) x 0.28 + Pb% x 13.84 + Zn% x 21.09

Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by CIM as 
stipulated in NI 43-101.  The San Agustin mineral resources are classified by 
Wardrop as Indicated and Inferred. 

The San Agustin block model contains 20,742 partial blocks coded as oxide and 
sulphide from the Main Zone, Zone 2, Zone 4 and the Fault Zone.  There are 8,294 
blocks classified as Indicated and 10,158 classified as Inferred.  There were 2,290 
blocks within the mineralized zones left unassigned.  

 The classification model was based on the restrictive search parameters derived 
from the variogram range for gold, and based as follows:  

• Blocks that were interpolated during pass one were assigned to the 
Indicated category. 

• Blocks interpolated during pass two were assigned to the Inferred category.

• Blocks that had not been interpolated during either pass were left 
unassigned.  

The result was a variable width contiguous zone of indicated blocks oriented along 
the main axis of the deposit flanked by inferred blocks.

Wardrop estimated that the San Agustin mineral resources, at a US$10 equivalent 
cutoff, contained approximately 61.8 million tonnes of Indicated mineral resources 
grading 0.511 g/t Au, 12.8 g/t Ag, 0.51% Zn, and 0.05% Pb. Wardrop also estimated 
an additional 53.4 million tonnes of Inferred mineral resources at a US$10 equivalent 
cutoff grading 0.432 g/t Au, 16.3 g/t Ag, 0.58% Zn, and 0.09% Pb (Table 17.11).

Wardrop completed a detailed visual validation of the San Agustin block model.  The 
model was checked for proper coding of drill hole intervals and block model cells, in 
both section and plan.  Coding was found to be correct.  Grade interpolation was 
examined relative to drill hole composite values by inspecting sections and plans.  
The checks showed good agreement between drill hole composite values and model 
cell values (Figure 17.4).

To the author's knowledge, there are currently no known environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, or political issues that adversely affect the 
property.

The property is accessible by road and within 4 km of a power line.  The 
infrastructure in the area is considered good.  Mining methods would be determined 
after a preliminary assessment and would depend on the success of future 
exploration.  The mining method would likely be open pit and processing would be 
done by conventional milling or heap leaching.

Several mapping, sampling, and drilling programs have been completed since the 
discovery of anomalous gold at the property in the mid-1980s.  Information collected 
from these past programs resulted in the discovery of mineralization hosted in a 
quartz-sericite-pyrite altered, massive to flow-banded dacite dome.  Higher grade 
structurally controlled mineralization associated with the central zone of sheeted 
alunite veins is the focus of the current exploration programs.  Drilling and surface 
sampling has confirmed the presence of the structural zone. 

A significant gold-silver deposit has been identified on the property through the 
drilling carried out to date.  The San Agustin property contains at a US$10 equivalent 
cutoff, approximately 61.8 million tonnes of Indicated mineral resources grading 
0.511 g/t Au, 12.8 g/t Ag, 0.51% Zn, and 0.05% Pb, as well as 53.4 million tonnes of 
Inferred mineral resources grading 0.432 g/t Au, 16.3 g/t Ag, 0.58% Zn, and 0.09% 
Pb. 

Further drilling is warranted to delineate the mineralization as it remains open in 
many locations.  Additional targets on the property, identified through trenching, 
remain to be evaluated.

Based on the exploration of the property to date and the discovery of a significant 
mineral deposit, the San Agustin property is of sufficient merit to warrant further 
resource definition drilling and exploration.  Wardrop recommends the following work 
program for the property: 

• continued Phase III deposit definition and step out exploration drilling 
totalling 20,000 metres 

• carry out an update of the mineral resource estimate to incorporate data 
from the recent drilling program 

• continue metallurgical test work on the mineralization.
