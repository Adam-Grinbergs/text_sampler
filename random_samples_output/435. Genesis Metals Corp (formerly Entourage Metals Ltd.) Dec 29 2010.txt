1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Caracle Creek International Consulting Inc. ("CCIC") of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada was contracted by 

Entourage Metals Ltd. ("Entourage") of Vancouver, Ontario, Canada to review the Rous Bomby, and 

Toothpick East and West Properties (the "Property"), and prepare an Independent Technical Report (the 

"Report"), compliant with National Instrument 43-101 ("NI43-101"), companion policy NI43-101CP and 

Form 43-101F1.  

The Rous Bomby and Toothpick Properties are located ~230 km east of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The 

Toothpick Properties are located ~10 south of the town of Marathon, Ontario, and ~25 km west of the 

Hemlo deposit. The Rous Bomby Property is located ~20 km east of Marathon and ~5 km west of the 

Hemlo deposit. The Rous Bomby property is located in the Lecours and Bomby townships and the 

Toothpick East and West property is located in the Pic township. 

The Rous Bomby Property consist of 172 contiguous, unpatented mining claims covering 3,200 ha, the 

Toothpick East Property consists 11 unpatented claims covering 176 ha  and the Toothpick West Property 

consists of 27 claims covering 432 ha. Entourage's total land position is 210 claims covering 3,808 ha. 

On June 7, 2010, Entourage entered in the Acquisition Agreement with Barrick to acquire the exclusive 

right to conduct exploration on mining claims located on the Rous Lake, Toothpick and Bomby areas in 

the Thunder Bay Mining District in Ontario (the "Hemlo Belt Properties"). 

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Entourage has an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Hemlo 

Belt Properties. In order to exercise this option, Entourage must (a) fulfill all landholding requirements, 

and (b) spend a minimum of $5,000,000 in expenditures on the Hemlo Belt Properties over five years as 

follows:  

Required Completion Date Cumulative Qualifying 
Expenditures 

June 30, 2011 $500,000 
June 30, 2012 $1,250,000 
June 30, 2013 $2,250,000 
June 30, 2014 $3,500,000 
June 30, 2015 $5,000,000 
Total $5,000,000

According to the Acquisition Agreement, Entourage is not entitled to commence commercial production 

on the Hemlo Belt Properties without completing a feasibility study on the Hemlo Belt Properties and 

paying $10,000,000 to Barrick. Entourage also agrees to pay Barrick a net smelter royalty of 3% on all 

gold, silver and other metals produced from the Hemlo Belt Properties. Pursuant to the Acquisition 

Agreement, if Entourage wishes to transfer the Hemlo Belt Properties to a third party, it must first give 

Barrick the opportunity to acquire the offered interest at 90% of the cash consideration offered and on the 

same other terms and conditions as the proposed transfer. 

Gold was discovered in the Hemlo area in 1981 and this lead to a staking rush and a lot of exploration 

work in the early 1980's. Entourage's current Rous Bomby property claim block was originally divided 

into 9 claim block owned by 9 different companies. Historic exploration on Entourage's Rous Bomby 

property in the 1980's included: geological compilation reports, line cutting, geophysics surveys 

(magnetometer, gravity, VLF EM, IP), soil sampling, lithogeochemical sampling, geological mapping, 

airborne orthophoto survey, diamond drilling and overburden drilling. In 1991, Homestake acquired all of 

Entourage's current Rous Bomby claim block and divided it into two properties: Rous Lake and Bel-Air. 

In the 1990's Homestake exploration on the property included: geophysics surveys (ground magnetics, 

VLF-EM, IP/Resistivity "Realsection", refraction seismic), lithogeochemical sampling, geological 

mapping and diamond drilling.  

 In 1983, Esso conducted an airborne geophysics survey (magnetics, electromagnetic and VLF-EM) on 

Toothpick East and West properties. From 1984-1986, Esso conducted drill programs with a total of 3 

holes on Toothpick East and 10 holes on Toothpick West. In 1994, Homestake conducted geophysics 

surveys on the Toothpick East and West properties which included: ground magnetic, VLF-EM and 

reconnaissance and IP/Resistivity "Realsection" surveys. In 2000, Teck conducted a drill program on the 

Toothpick East property which consisted of 3 drill holes. Teck also conducted a drill program on 

Toothpick West: 6 holes in 2001 and 3 holes in 2002.  

The Rous Bomby and Toothpick East and West Properties are located in the Hemlo greenstone belt of the 

Wawa subprovince of the Superior province of the Canadian Shield. The Hemlo greenstone belt consists 

of metasedimentary supracrustal rocks, felsic to intermediate calc-alkalic volcanic rocks, large granitic 

intrusions (~2690-2684 Ma and 2678 Ma) and rare komatiites. The belt is flanked by mafic volcanic 

rocks and bounded by metamorphic batholiths (2720 Ma). The greenstone belt is variably metamorphosed 

with lower grades in the west and medium grades in the east.

The dominant rock types on the Rous Bomby Property are intermediate volcanic rocks 

(plagioclase±quartz-phyric tuff, lapilli tuff, plagioclase±quartz-phyric tuff breccia and pyroclastic 

breccia), metasedimentary rocks (wacke, lithic wacke, mudstone, minor conglomerate and schist) and 

mafic volcanic rocks (massive and pillowed flows). The southernmost part of the Property straddles the 

Heron Bay pluton in the west and the Pukaskwa Gneiss Complex in the east. The Heron Bay pluton 

consists of massive to foliated hornblende-biotite granodiorite and the Pukaswka Gneiss Complex 

consists of biotite-hornblende trondhjemite and granodiorite and minor pegmatite and aplite. A major 

shear zone, the Lake Superior Fault Zone, runs through the Property. 

The dominant rock types in the Toothpick Properties are intermediate volcanic rocks, in particular 

plagioclase±quartz-phyric tuff and lapilli tuff. In the northern part of Toothpick East, mafic volcanic 

rocks also occur (massive to pillowed flows with plagioclase phenocrysts). 

The eastern edge of the Rous-Bomby Property is located approximately 2.5 km west of the world class 

Hemlo gold deposit. The exploration model used for Entourage's exploration activities is that of the 

Hemlo deposit. The Hemlo gold deposit (~2689-2684 Ma) is located in major high-strain zones, the Lake 

Superior shear zone and the Moose Lake fault zone. Hemlo is spatially associated with a restraining bend 

in the Hemlo greenstone belt. The deposit extends over a strike length of 2.5 km and plunges to the west. 

It is hosted by sedimentary (volcaniclastic and epiclastic) rocks (dominantly wacke and sandstone) and 

massive and fragmental, felsic volcanic rocks of the Moose Lake Volcanic Complex. 

Since June 2010, Entourage has been preparing for a future exploration and drilling program. Entourage 

has compiled geological data on the properties and conducted field work. A great deal of information 

exists from the exploration work carried out by various companies since 1975.  Much of this data is in 

analogue format.  Entourage has already compiled and digitised a considerable amount of this information 

into GIS and excel formats but the task is not yet complete.  In order for Entourage to comprehensively 

assess the properties this compilation needs to be completed so that all relevant data is available in digital 

format to allow GIS manipulation of the information to define target areas and to plan appropriate field 

work. The field work completed to date was to determine access to different parts of the property, search 

for historic drill collars, and observe distribution of Quaternary cover and outcrop. No samples were 

analyzed as a result of the field work. Based on the compilation of historic data, preliminary field work 

and knowledge of the local geology, targets for future exploration have been identified.  

Entourage contracted KBM Forestry Consultants Inc. to take an aerial photo on Oct. 5, 2010 of the area 

which includes Rous Bomby and Toothpick East and West properties. Entourage has not completed any

drilling on the Properties. Mineral resources and reserves have not been estimated on the Property both 

historically or by Entourage.  

Elisabeth Ronacher visited the Properties on September 22, 2010. The purpose of the site visit was to 

determine whether significant outcrop existed on the Properties, whether any mineralization could be 

detected on the surface and what type of access to the Properties existed. 

CCIC concludes that the Rous Bomby, and Toothpick East and West properties have the potential to host 

a Hemlo-type deposit or an orogenic gold deposit. A gold deposit may be discovered if exploration 

techniques are used to image through the deep overburden and drill targets are selected using the 

knowledge gained from the historic exploration on the property.  

CCIC recommends the following exploration program: 

• Phase I – consisting of compilation of historic exploration data into a 3D model, lithogeochemical 
survey to map the hydrothermal system that may exist at depth, geophysics surveys (downhole 
IP/Resistivity, and gravity) 

• Phase II – drilling of holes at least 1,000 m deep and possibly even 2,000 m deep and downhole 
deep borehole rock property survey

4.2 Ownership 

On June 7, 2010, Entourage entered in the Acquisition Agreement with Barrick to acquire the exclusive 

right to conduct exploration on mining claims located on the Rous Lake, Toothpick and Bomby areas in 

the Thunder Bay Mining District in Ontario (the "Hemlo Belt Properties"). 

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Entourage has an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Hemlo 

Belt Properties. In order to exercise this option, Entourage must (a) fulfill all landholding requirements, 

and (b) spend a minimum of $5,000,000 in expenditures on the Hemlo Belt Properties over five years as 

follows:  

Required Completion Date Cumulative Qualifying 
Expenditures 

June 30, 2011 $500,000 
June 30, 2012 $1,250,000 
June 30, 2013 $2,250,000 
June 30, 2014 $3,500,000 
June 30, 2015 $5,000,000 
Total $5,000,000 

According to the Acquisition Agreement, Entourage is not entitled to commence commercial production 

on the Hemlo Belt Properties without completing a feasibility study on the Hemlo Belt Properties and 

paying $10,000,000 to Barrick.  

Entourage also agrees to pay Barrick a net smelter royalty of 3% on all gold, silver and other metals 

produced from the Hemlo Belt Properties. 

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, if Entourage wishes to transfer the Hemlo Belt Properties to a 

third party, it must first give Barrick the opportunity to acquire the offered interest at 90% of the cash 

consideration offered and on the same other terms and conditions as the proposed transfer. 

 
The surface rights for the Toothpick West, Toothpick East, and Rous Bomby properties are owned by the 
crown.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

Access to the southern half of the Rous Lake property is provided by Highway 17 which passes through 

the southern margins of the claims; the Rous Lake pit road, which provided north-south access to an east-

west powerline and the Black River; and an old logging road which ends at Camp 36 Lake, located in the 

center of the property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2006). The claims are roughly bisected by the 

meandering Black River which provides boat/canoe access to the northern portions of the property. The 

very rugged northwestern portion of the property is best accessed by helicopter.  

Highway 17 also straddles the Bomby Property. An all season road leading to the former Hemlo train 

station crosses the Property.  

Railway tracks cross Toothpick West Property but foot and all-terrain-vehicle access is along an old path 

that was improved by Entourage. This path is located in the eastern part of the Property and leads to old 

drill hole collars. The Property can also be accessed by boat from Lake Superior. 

The Toothpick East Property can be reached by crossing Pic River on a canoe and using trails and cleared 

areas under a power line or on trails from Highway 17. 

The Canadian Pacific Railway runs east-west just south of the Rous-Bomby and just west of the 

Toothpick East Properties. It crosses the Toothpick West Property from east to west. 

The closest international airport is located in Thunder Bay, 230 km west of Marthon (297 km on Highway  

17). 

5.2 Climate and Vegetation 

The climate in the area is continental with a daily average temperature of -15°C in January and of 18°C in 

July. In January, average low temperatures are -21°C and average highs are-8°C. The average high 

temperature in July is 24°C and the average low is 11°C.  Mean annual precipitation is 711 mm.  Most of 

the rain falls during the months of May through September.  Most of the snow falls in January and 

February; the average snow depth is 30 cm (data from the closest weather station of Environment Canada 

in Thunder Bay; http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals).

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

Geological mapping and sampling is best performed in the summer and fall when there is no snow cover. 

Drilling can occur year around, except for spring thaw which makes the bush muddy.  

Vegetation is dense and consists dominated by black spruce, jack pine and poplar with some maple, 

balsam fir and birch. Tag alder occurs in swampy areas. Undergrowth consists of moose maple, tag alder, 

labrador tea and sphagnum moss. The Black River basin is relatively well-drained and forested by mature 

trembling aspen with scattered white birch, black spruce and balsam fir. Areas of outcrop are usually 

forested by jack pine, white birch and black spruce. 

5.3 Physiography 

Two EW trending ridges of up to 380 m characterize the Rous Property. The area between the two ridges 

is relatively flat and sandy plains occur along Black River. The lowest elevation on the Rous Property is 

240 m. 

The Toothpick West Property is hilly and elevations range from 190 at the lake shore to 300 m. Toothpick 

East is flatter with the Pic River at 170 m and the highest elevation being 280. 

E-W ridges of bedrock in the south and sandy plains along the Black River, see surficial geology map 

(Figure 5-1).  

5.4 Infrastructure and Local Resources 

The town of Marathon has a population of 3,863 (Census Canada 2006; http://www12.statcan.gc.ca). 

Because of the vicinity of Marathon to the Hemlo gold mines, skilled and unskilled labour is readily 

available. Supplies, fuel, accommodation, banking and medical services are available in Marathon. The 

closest major city with an international airport is Thunder Bay, 230 km west of Marathon. 

A major power line runs parallel to Highway 17 and another power line runs from Marathon to Heron 

Bay between the Toothpick East and West Properties. The sources of electricity include a hydroelectric 

power dam near Nipigon.  Water is available from local streams and ponds.  

Surface rights on all Properties are held by the Crown.

6.0 PROPERTY HISTORY 

6.1 Rous Bomby 

6.1.1 1927, gold discovery 

Gold was first discovered in the region in 1927 when a Canadian Pacific Railway employee, Mr. Lecour, 

is reported to have found gold within a few hundred feet of the railway (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0023).  

6.1.2 1932, Ontario Department of Mines geology map 

In 1932, the geology of the area was mapped by J.P. Thompson for the Ontario Department of Mines at a 

scale of 1 " = 2 miles (P494).  

6.1.3 1945, gold discovery 

The next recorded gold discovery in this district was in 1945 by a prospector near Moose Lake some 3 

miles east of Helmo hamlet (MNDMF assessment files: 42C12NW0146, 42D09NE0023).  The gold

Drilling 

In 1975, Noranda Mines Limited (Geco Divison) ("Noranda"), Manitouwadge, Ontario had two claim 

groups in the Hemlo area: Rous Lake No. 1 Group and Rous Lake No. 2 Group (Figure 6-1). Rous Lake 

No. 1 Group consisted of 31 claims (TB 421216 to 421246 inclusive). Rous Lake No. 2 Group consisted 

of 4 claims (TB 421247 to 421250 inclusive). 

In April and May 1975, Noranda drilled 4 diamond drill holes totaling 1,795 ft (=547 m) on Rous Lake 

No. 1 Group (MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE0092) (Table 6-1). Trace up to 3% disseminated pyrite

Geological mapping 

In June 1975, Noranda completed geological mapping on their Rous Lake No. 1 Group (on north shore of 

Rous Lake) and Rous Lake No. 2 Group (east of Rous Lake along Highway 17) claims (MNDMF 

assessment file 42C09NE8757). They noted that there is an east-west ridge along the north side of 

Highway 17. On this ridge, the soil cover of sandy soil ranges from 2 inches to 2 feet thick. To the north 

of this ridge, the area is covered by a glacial sand plain over 100 feet thick. Only one small outcrop was 

found north of the Black River. Additional outcrop was found in the ridges along the north side of 

Highway 17.  

The Rous Lake No. 1 Group outcrops mainly consisted of metavolcanics/amphibolites. The other rock 

units in the claim group are porphyritic dacite, quartz-feldspar-biotite paragneiss, hornblende granite and 

syenite porphyry dykes, and diabase dykes. The only suphide mineral encountered was pyrite which was 

sparsely disseminated in the metasedimentary rocks.  

Rous Lake No. 2 Group four claims are centered around a low hill covered by a thin layer of sandy soil on 

the south side of the highway. North of the highway is a glacial sand plain possibly 100 feet thick with 

numerous small bogs. No outcrop was found north of the highway.  

The Rous Lake No.2 Group outcrops mainly consisted of metavolcanics/amphibolites and several 

occurrences of syenite porphyry and diabase dykes were encountered. Fine-grained porphryritic dacite, 

quartz-feldspar-biotite paragneiss and hornblende granite also occur in this claim group. No significant 

sulphide mineralization was encountered.

In addition to geological mapping and drilling, Noranda also conducted a Radem very low frequency 

electromagnetic (VLF EM) survey in June 1975 on Rous Lake No. 1 Group (MNDMF assessment file 

42D09NE0093). The EM survey was run on a grid cut by Jean Alix Company Limited for Noranda in 

November 1974. The lines are at 400-foot intervals with stations marked at 100-foot intervals on the lines. 

Readings were taken every 100 ft with readings at every 50 ft in some locations. A number of small 

conductors were indicated by the Radem VLF EM survey. Most of these conductors are short and 

discontinuous. The dip angle crossovers are in general gradual and the field strengths weak.  

The one exception to this is a conductor at least 2,200 ft long. The dip angle survey showed a strong south 

limb with a gradual crossover and shallow north limb. The field strength survey shows a band of high 

readings displaced 200 feet south of the axis of the conductor. This conductor is in an area of deep sand 

overburden and therefore could not be explained in outcrop.  

It is probable that all of the conductors are caused by faults. Most of the conductors appear to have the 

same strike as the faulting in the area.  

Noranda also conducted a magnetometer survey in June 1975 on Rous Lake No. 1 Group (MNDMF 

assessment file 42D09NE0093). The magnetometer survey showed little of interest. Several small 

discontinuous bands of high magnetics are present, but these are probably caused by a magnetic medium-

grained amphibolite or by talcose-chlorite dykes.  

Noranda conducted a Radem very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF EM) survey in July and 

September 1975 on Rous Lake No. 2 Group (MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE0093). The EM survey 

was run on a grid cut by Jean Alix Company Limited for Noranda in November 1974. The lines are at 

400-foot intervals with stations marked at 100-foot intervals on the lines. Readings were taken every 100 

ft with readings at every 50 ft in some locations. Following the initial work in July, a second grid was put 

in to trace a conductor. This grid consisted of a 2,400 ft picket and chain baseline with 800 ft compass and 

pace cross lines every 400 ft along the baseline. The initial survey showed two conductors. The first 

conductor north of the highway on the east end was likely caused by power lines. The second conductor 

in the south west corner looked much better. A second grid was put in to try to extend this conductor. The 

conductor was followed for 2000 ft without coming to an end. Subsequent trenching showed this 

conductor to be caused by a fault.  

Noranda also conducted a magnetometer survey in July and September 1975 on Rous Lake No. 2 Group 

(MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE0093).The original survey showed two short bands of magnetic high. 

These two bands appear to be in line and the southern most is nearly coincident with an EM conductor.

The second survey showed three parallel bands of magnetic high. The middle band is nearly coincident 

with an EM conductor and is probably caused by faults. The other two bands are probably caused by a 

magnetitc ampholite unit or a strongly magnetitic talcose dyke.

The field work for a detailed geological map of the Hemlo area was done in 1978 by T.L. Muir and 

Lafleur for the Ontario Geological Survey. A preliminary map of this work was published in 1979 

(P2304) and a final coloured version at a scale of 1 " = ½ mile was published in 1981 (M2452). The 

accompanying report was published in 1982 (OGR 217, OFR 5280).

6.1.7 1981-1982, Bel-Air Resources Ltd. 

Geological Mapping 

H.D. Carlson conducted a geological survey over Bel-Air Resources Ltd.'s ("Bel-Air") property Oct. 4 to 

Nov. 27, 1981 (Figure 6-4) (MNDMF assessment file: 42C12NW0146). Bel-Air's property consists of 36 

contiguous, unpatented mining claims and is located between Cigar and Rous Lake in Bomby and 

Lecours townships. On Bel-Air's property, outcrops are numerous long the highway and railway cuts, 

around lake shores and the flanks of hills and ridges. The outcrops tend to be vertical ridges and the flat 

areas between the vertical ledges and on the tops of ridges only have small amounts of outcrop. The 

maximum depth of overburden in the area is 16 ft and consists of boulder clay ground morainal tills with 

some varved clay deposits along creek, river and lake bottoms. Overlying these older glacial deposits are 

numerous isolated patches of outwash sand and gravel.  

The bedrock underlying the Bel-Air property is mainly intercalations of metavolcanic and 

metasedimentary rocks which strike generally east-west and dip steeply north. These rocks have been 

thoroughly recrystallized to at least moderate grade metamorphism. The northwestern, western and 

southeastern parts of the property are underlain by plutonic granitoid rocks which intrude the intercalated 

metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The youngest rocks on the property are diabase dykes which 

strike a little north of west and dip vertically cutting across the layered and plutonic rocks.  

The geological mapping of the Bel-Air property located and roughly delineated a pyrite-micaceous-

cherty-agglomeratic tuff horizon in an east-west trending belt of metavolcanic-metasedimentary rocks 

between Cache Lake and Cigar Lake. This cherty-pyrite tuff horizon is at least 2,400 ft long (open at the 

east end) and has widths from 40 ft to at least 65 ft. It strikes east-west and dips north at 70-75º. This belt 

was called the Main Pyrite Zone.  

Geophysics – magnetometer and VLF-EM surveys 

In addition to geological mapping, H.D. Carlson also conducted magnetometer and electromagnetic 

(VLF) geophysical surveys over the 36 claim property from October 1981 to January 1982 (MNDMF 

assessment file: 42C12NW0146). A survey control grid of cut picket lines was established on the 

property during September 1981. The main baseline was laid out in the east-west direction across the 

northern part of the property and is located 200 to 1,200 ft south of Highway 17. A total of 37.5 miles of 

line were established to complete the survey grid.

For the magnetometer survey, the higher readings on the property are closely associated with two rock 

formations: diabase dykes and mafic volcanic rocks and associated ultramafic rocks. The VLF EM survey 

on the Bel-Air property detected a number of prominent electromagnetic conductive zones, located as 

follows: 

a) parallel to Highway 17 due to the overburden and power lines 

b) north shore of Cache Lake due to power lines along the railway, overburden and shoreline effects 

c) parallel to the creek between Cache Lake and Cigar Lake due to the fault along the creek and 

overburden 

d) near Hemlo road north of the railway, along the north shore of Cigar Lake. The conductor is 

parallel to the pyritic-micaceous-cherty-agglomeratic tuff horizon and an exposed sulphide zone. 

The sulphide conductor has interference from terrain and overburden effects, shoreline effects, 

railway tracks and power lines. This is the Main Pyrite Zone.  

 

Drilling 

Aug. 31 to September 22, 1982, eight diamond drill holes with AQ core size for a total footage of 3,354.5 

ft (=1,019 m) were drilled under the supervision of geologist David R. Bell (MNDMF assessment file: 

42C12NW0179) (Table 6-2; Figure 6-2). Five of the eight holes (BA1 to BA3, BA7 and BA8) were 

drilled to test the Main Pyrite Zone and three holes (BA4 to BA6) to test the sulphides associated with the 

shear zone occurring along the Microwave Tower access road. The Main Pyrite Zone occurs between 

Cache and Cigar Lakes. The only assay of any significance from the drill core was an assay from BA5 

from 93.5 to 94 ft over 0.5 ft with 0.21 g/t Au from a massive pyrite/pyrrhotite band in chlorite rock 

(Microwave Tower shear zone).

6.1.8 1983, Westfield Minerals Ltd./Bel Air Resources Ltd.  
The Bel Air group of 40 contiguous, unpatented claims, which include the hamlet of Hemlo, was optioned 

by Westfield Minerals Ltd. ("Westfield") in 1983 (MNDMF assessment file: 42C12NW0179). The 

original 36 claims were staked in November 1981 and the remaining 4 claims were staked in May 1982. 

Overburden is relatively thin and rock exposure is good. The 1983 exploration program run by Westfield 

on the Bel Air project included:  

• Geological mapping and prospecting – reconnaissance of 40 claims 

• Trenching – 925 linear ft of new trenching 

• Channel sampling of existing and new trenches – 90 analyses 

• Relogging drill core in August 1983 

• Splitting and assaying drill core – 343 samples

The majority of the samples from all of this exploration work returned low Au assays and thus is not 

discussed in detail.  

 

Geological mapping 

The Bel Air group of claims is largely underlain by the lower members of the Heron Bay Sequence. They 

consist of metamorphosed intermediate to felsic calc-alkalic pyroclastic rocks, related metasediments and 

high-iron tholeiitic basalt flows (Figure 6-3). The lithostratigraphic units for the metavolcanic and 

metasedimentary sequences underlying the claim block from north to south are: arkosic wacke and 

siltstone, mafic volcanics, dacite, metasediments (including a distinct garnetiferous biotite schist), calc-

silicate, intermediate tuff, lapilli tuff and/or agglomerate and mafic volcanics. The metasediments, 

intermediate tuff and lapilli tuff units have overall thicknesses of approximately 1,000 ft.  

Spatially related to the lapilli tuff are several areas of alteration and sulphide mineralization. The two 

dominant sulphide mineralized zones are: the Main Pyrite Zone and the East Pyrite Zone. The Main 

Pyrite Zone is between Cache and Cigar Lakes, and the East Pyrite Zone is located north of the railway 

along the northwest shore of Cigar Lake. The Main Pyrite Zone consists of a zone up to 100 ft wide of 

mostly bleached and silicified rocks with <1-30% sulphides. The sulphides are dominantly pyrite with 

some pyrrhotite and trace amounts of chalcopyrite. The sulphide occurs within two lithologies: a) in fine 

graphitic siltstone close to the contact with the lapilli tuff and b) as fine disseminations and blebs within 

the lapilli tuff. The East Pyrite Zone is much weaker than the Main Pyrite Zone. The East Pyrite Zone is 

bleached and slightly brown-stained altered bedrock with <1-5% pyrite. Molybdenum correlates with the 

gold in the pyrite in the East Pyrite Zone.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

The metavolcanics and metasediments have been intruded by major and minor intrusives: feldspar 

porphyry sills, diabase dykes, Pukaska Granite-Gniess (trondhjemite and granodiorite) and Heron Bay 

Pluton (granodiorite).  

Metamorphism to amphibolite facies has affected the whole area imprinting the metasediments and 

metavolcanics with a strong near east-west foliation and much recrystallization.  

A major shear zone with a dextral displacement strikes ENE through the Cache Lake and continues 

almost EW south of Cigar Lake. A 50 ft wide shear zone has been observed running along the Microwave 

Tower Access road. The contact between the Heron Bay Pluton and the tuffs at the southwest end of the 

property is faulted. Several major faults striking between NW and N cross the property. These faults were 

named the 42, 57, 70, 83 and 106 faults for the point at which they cross the base line. The 42 fault offsets 

the Main Pyrite Zone.

Geophysics – magnetometer survey 

MPH surveyed 35 line miles with a line spacing of 400 ft covering the entire grid using a magnetometer 

and the total field and vertical gradient were measured from June 10 to 29, 1983. The purpose of the 

magnetic survey was to attempt to locate various geologic contacts and trace these features. Magnetic 

relief was low. Several magnetic features relating to the different lithologies were identified: a) NW 

striking diabase dyke, b) Pukska Gneiss, c) mafic flows and d) possibly some subdivision within the 

tuffaceous and sedimentary sequences. Several of the major faults also have a weak magnetic signature, 

especially those displacing diabase dykes.  

Geophysics – first IP survey  

MPH surveyed 6 line miles of double dipole IP over selected parts of the property as a follow up to 

geological mapping from June 10 to 29, 1983. The IP survey was initially conducted in areas of known 

sulphide mineralization and subsequently extended to trace the anomalous polarisable zones along strike.  

Anomaly A outlined the Main Pyrite Zone. The IP response suggests a zone containing between 5 and 8% 

sulphides dipping to the north at 80º. The IP anomaly is displaced southwards along the known NW 

striking fault which cuts the Main Pyrite Zone. The anomaly continues east of the fault and suggests that 

the Main Pyrite Zone continues under Cigar Lake.  

Anomaly B corresponds with the East Pyrite Zone. The southern limit of the anomaly could not be well 

delineated because of the C.P. railway tracks and associated overhead cables and Cigar Lake.  

Anomaly C is possibly caused by pyrite within the mafic metavolcanics and pyrite and magnetite within 

the dacite close to Highway 17. Anomaly C may also be caused by the highway itself.  

Anomaly D is a weak anomaly and does not have an explanation.  

Geochemistry – humus and soil samples 

The whole Bel Air claim block was humus sampled on a 50 x 200 ft grid, except for lakes, for a total of 

5,802 samples. The samples were analyzed for Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Mo, Sb, Ba and Au. The results of the 

humus program did not outline any major geochemical targets, so it was decided to re-sample the claim 

block using the B horizon which may give a better anomaly/background contrast. The B horizon sampling

was carried out on a 50 x 200 ft grid or where there were anomalous humus values on a 50 x 100 ft grid. 

By mid-November (freeze-up) approximately 60% of the claim area had been sampled for a total of 4,027 

samples. Only 3% of the B horizon samples returned Au assays > 6 ppb and the maximum value was 605 

ppb.  

The Au anomalies from the B horizon sampling were compared with the geology and the following 

correlations were identified: 

a) Several Au anomalies are in close spatial association with major faults 

b) Anomalies occur close to the margins of volcaniclastic sediments (e.g., lapilli tuff) 

c) Anomalies occur close to or on the contact of diabase dykes 

d) Anomalies occur within the Pukaskwa Gneiss 

e) Anomalies occur close to a small granitic intrusion 

The Mo results range from 1 to 30 ppm and >5 ppm is considered anomalous. The following correlations 

were noted for the Mo anomalies: 

a) elevated Mo values occur in close proximity to Au anomalies 

b) An occasional Mo anomaly occurs without a corresponding Au anomaly in close proximity to the 

major faults 

c) The peninsular land between the south shore of Cigar Lake and the stream draining the lake has 

several Mo anomalies 

d) Mo anomalies occur in the East Pyrite Zone and Main Pyrite Zone 

The Cu results range from a few ppm to several hundred ppm and >35 ppm is considered anomalous. The 

following correlations were noted for the Cu anomalies: 

a) elevated Cu values occur in close proximity to Au anomalies 

b) The peninsular land between the south shore of Cigar Lake and the stream draining the lake has 

Cu anomalies 

c) Cu anomalies occur in the Main Pyrite Zone 

d) A Cu anomaly occurs south of Porphyry Lake which coincides with a humus Au anomaly.  

Recommendations for future exploration are complete the B horizon sampling, detailed follow up soil 

sampling, geological mapping, stripping and trenching, lithogeochemical sampling, IP survey and 

diamond drilling.

Geophysics – second IP survey 

Line cutting was carried out by MPH under direct contract to Westfield. Lines were cut north and south of 

the base line and approximately 35 miles of line was cut, chained and picketed.  

MPH completed a second IP survey on the property from Aug. 12 to 18, 1983 (MNDMF assessment file: 

42C12NW0179). The purpose of the survey was to trace the extent of the zones of anomalous 

chargeability identified in the first IP survey. Approximately 2 miles of line was covered by the second IP 

survey. The results indicate that Zone A (Main Pyrite Zone) possibly continues to the west. The zone 

remains open to the west and additional coverage is required to determine its ultimate limit on the 

property. Zone B (East Pyrite Zone) is open to the east and additional coverage is required to determine 

its eastern limit. The width of Zone B will be difficult to determine because it parallels the CPR railway 

tracks. A winter survey on Cigar Lake is recommended to determine if Zones A and B extend under the 

lake. Zone C anomaly appears to be caused by a cultural effect. 

6.1.9 1983, Rabbit Oil and Gas Ltd.  

In January and February 1983, Mid Canada conducted VLF EM and magnetometer surveys on Rabbit Oil 

and Gas Ltd.'s ("Rabbit") property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0014).  

Omenica Resources Ltd. optioned the property on April 7, 1983 and carried out the following surveys on 

the property:  

a) IP survey by Geocanex (Sept. 12, 1983) 

b) Geological mapping and minor sampling by Dr. R. Scratch and D'Arcy Holding from May 26 to 

June 3, 1983 

c) Diamond drilling (1,443 ft or 440 m in four holes, labelled RB-83-1 to RB-83-4) from June 18 to 

July 22, 1983 overseen by Dr. R. Scratch. The drilling was completed on a group of claims in the 

northeast corner of the property. The drill core logs for these four holes are not available in 

assessment files.  

The results for the 1983 exploration work were not released in assessment files.

David R. Bell Geological Services Inc. prepared a compilation report dated September 1982 and proposed 

an exploration program for Triple Crown Resources Ltd.'s ("Triple Crown") 15 contiguous unpatented 

claims located north of Rous Lake and Black River (Figure 6-4) (MNDMF assessment file 

42D09NE0023). The claims are numbered TB 632542 to TB 632556, inclusive. The property consists of 

a series of intermediate to felsic volcanic flows and pyroclastics interbedded with mafic metavolcanic 

tuffs and lapilli-tuffs. These units have a generally east north-easterly strike and dip steeply north. 

Recommendations for Phase I exploration included establishing a control grid, detailed geological 

mapping, lithogeochemistry sampling, IP survey and stripping. Recommendation for Phase II is 3,000 ft 

of AQ diamond drilling.

In the latter part of 1982, Mid-Canada Exploration Services Ltd. conducted magnetic and VLF 

electromagnetic surveys on Triple Crown's property (MNDMF assessment file: 4209NE0084). The area 

is a relatively flat plain of sand and silt interspersed with occasional rocky mounds up to 100 ft above the 

plain. Outcrops represent less than 5% of the surface and are confined to ridges along the northern 

boundary and in the west-central portion of the claim group.  

A base line was cut easterly for 8,000 ft from a major bend along the Black River on the adjoining 

property of International Corona Resources Ltd, and Galveston Petroleums Ltd. and continued for another 

4,000 ft to 120W across into the Triple Crown claims.  

For the magnetic survey, with the exception of a winged anomaly between lines 100E and 112E at 21N to 

23N, and a weaker one on lines 88E and 92E south of 20S, it was concluded that the remaining anomalies 

greater than 100 gammas are likely due to mafic intrusives such as diabase dykes. Conductive anomaly 

'C' coincides with the most southerly northwest-trending anomaly.  

For the VLF electromagnetic survey, although several anomalies have been interpreted from the data, 

only nine labeled 'A' to 'I' are most likely due to sources within bedrock. Anomaly 'A' is located in the 

north-eastern part of the claim group and strikes east-west generally coincides with the magnetic data and 

is interpreted as having a sharp profile. Anomaly 'C' may represent a conductive zone some 500 ft in 

width. Anomaly 'C' is coincident with a strong magnetic trend which strikes northwesterly across the 

west central portion of the claim group. Anomaly 'H' is an area of strong profiles suggesting the presence 

of a yet undefined northerly striking conductor between lines 92E and 96 E. Disturbed magnetic trends in 

this area tend to support this evidence. Anomaly 'H' likely coincides with the diabase dyke observed 

during geological mapping.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

In 1983, OreQuest Consultants Ltd., Vancouver conducted a field program between July and October 

1983 consisting of prospecting, a claim post survey, geological mapping, limited soil geochemistry 

survey and a reconnaissance IP survey described below (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0047). They 

concluded based on field work done to date that the property is geologically well situated and has a 

reasonable potential to host another Hemlo-type gold ore deposit. However due to thick accumulations of 

glacial overburden, traditional methods of exploration are not adequate.  

Geological mapping 

Limited mapping was carried out by OreQuest in the summer of 1983.  The northern six claims on the 

property consist of intercalations of mafic to intermediate tuff, lapilli tuff and lapilli tuff breccia which are 

intruded by an east-west trending diabase dyke (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0047). The southern 

outcrops are primarily confined to an east-west ridge and they consist of intercalated sequences of 

intermediate tuffs and metasedimentary rocks. There are only minor intercalations of mafic tuff in the 

southern outcrops. The intermediate tuffs exhibit sericitic alteration and are associated with quartz veins 

or stock work. 

Soil sampling  

A total of 224 soil samples were collected during Phase I program in the summer of 1983 on the B 

horizon. Due to heavy swamp and bog cover, soil sampling was restricted to areas where a rusty zone of 

accumulation tentatively labeled as B Horizon was located. All samples were analyzed for Au, Ag, Mo, 

As, Cu and Zn by Vangochem Labs in Vancouver. In general, all values are low and well below 

threshold.  

IP survey 

MPH Consultants Ltd. under a contract to OreQuest Consultants Ltd. conducted a reconnaissance IP 

survey over a 46 km2 block in the Hemlo area which included Triple Crown's claim group. Six anomalies 

were noted on the Triple Crown property:  

1. Anomaly 1 is situated on the boundary between Triple Crown and Youngman Oil and Gas. It is 

relatively weak anomaly recorded in an area of low resistivity due to thick overburden and is thus 

considered to be spurious.  

2. Anomaly 2 is a well defined feature which occurs in a high resistivity environment at or near the 

contact between volcanic and volcano sedimentary rocks. The anomaly occupies the same stratigraphic

position as anomaly 5. If it is extrapolated along strike to the east, it aligns with the gold horizon under 

exploration in adjacent properties.  

3. Anomaly 3 is a weak feature associated within a zone of high variable resistivities. The complete 

feature is very erratic and probably does not warrant further work except for visual examination of the 

bedrock in the area.  

4. Anomaly 4 is a modest response, but its northern limit and ultimate character are not defined because 

of the limits of the survey coverage. Detailed survey and possible extension of the survey coverage across 

the property boundary are needed to explain the anomaly.  

5. Anomaly 5 consists of a modest narrow response associated with a 500 ft wide zone of high resistivity 

which probably reflects subcropping bedrock. This feature is on strike with anomaly 3. An examination of 

the outcrop in the area and detailed IP surveying is recommended.  

6. Anomaly 6 is poorly defined because of the limits of the survey. To explain the anomaly, the IP survey 

would need to be extended into the adjacent property of Youngman Oil and Gas Ltd.  

6.1.11 1982-1983, Youngman Oil and Gas Ltd.  

Geological mapping and soil sampling 

Teck Explorations Limited carried out a program of geological mapping and soil sampling in the fall of 

1982 for Youngman Oil and Gas Ltd. ("Youngman") (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0036). The 

work was confined to the southeast part of the property owing to the presence of swampy ground to the 

west and extensive sand plains up to 100 ft thick in the north. The property consists of 25 contiguous 

unpatented mining claims and the claim numbers are TB 393054 to TB 393065 and TB 624208 to TB 

624220, inclusively. Previously in 1974, Noranda staked 31 claims covering 21 of the 1982 Youngman 

claims. In April and May 1975, Noranda drilled 4 holes on the Youngman property (see section 6.1.5).  

The outcrop in the southeast corner of the property consists of Heron Bay Pluton (biotite-hornblende 

granodiorite) which intrudes mafic metavolcanics and the contact strikes east-west. The metavolcanics are 

mafic flows with a basaltic composition which have been amphibolitized. The metavolcanics contain 

magnetite which accounts for the magnetometer anomalies on the property. At least three diabase dykes 

occur on the property and they trend north-northeast.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

Soil samples were collected from the A and B horizons on the southeastern six claims of the property. 

Approximately 370 samples of the B horizon were analyzed for Au only by fire assay.  Two zones of 

anomalous values (> 23 ppb Au) occur in the southeast portion of the property. One anomalous zone has a 

maximum value of 49 ppb Au and the second anomalous zone has a maximum of 1100 ppb Au appears to 

be parallel to the metavolcanic-granite contact at a distance of 700 to 800 ft north of the contact.  

Recommendations for exploration are at detailed geological mapping, stripping and possible trenching. 

The gold potential of the metasediments and metavolcanics in the northeast corner of the property should 

be tested by drilling.  

Geophysics – magnetometer and VLF EM 

In the August 1982, Mid-Canada Exploration Services completed line cutting, total field magnetics and 

VLF EM for Youngman (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0074). In 1975, Noranda completed ground 

geophysics (magnetic and VLF-EM) over 85% of the Youngman property (see section 6.1.5). At the time 

the power line which crosses the property was not in place eliminating the inference which is present in 

the later geophysics surveys.  

The magnetic survey shows some of the underlying geological boundaries. A 1600 ft wide magnetic zone 

arcs in a westerly direction across the property which is likely due to the Heron Bay Pluton. Throughout 

the center of the magnetic zone is a magnetic depression which may be a shear or fault zone. A magnetic 

depression coincides with the valley of the Black River and may correlate with the depth of overburden. 

The northeast trending band of high magnetics in the southwesterly claims may be due to the presence of 

a mafic intrusion such as diabase.  

The VLF EM survey resulted in several anomalies labeled A to O. Anomalies H, K and D appear to be 

stratigraphically linked within the granitic rocks. Anomaly D strikes towards the contact between the 

granite and sediments. Anomalies C, F and H and the nearby Noranda conductors may be a series of 

faults or shears. Anomalies I and O are near the north contact of the magnetic unit and could be 

stratigraphically related. Conductor E possibly originates from a bedrock source. The conductor outlined 

by Noranda survey north of the power line coincides with the north unit of the magnetic zone and 

Noranda's hole S-166 did not drill deep enough to investigate the projected conductive zone.

MPH, under a contract from OreQuest, conducted a reconnaissance IP surveys in June, July and August 

1983 for 10 companies including Youngman (see section 6.1.16) (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0109). MPH identified seven anomalies. Anomaly 1 is a broad complex anomaly of moderate 

response which contains at least three narrow zones of higher than average chargeability. Anomaly 1 

probably reflects a bedrock response and the narrow zones of higher than average chargeability mark 

areas where the sulphide content of the bedrock is moderately higher. Previous geological mapping and 

magnetic survey indicate that the anomaly occurs in basic volcanic rocks. Anomalies 4 and 7 are similar 

to anomaly 1.  

Anomaly 2 is a weak feature that is likely spurious. Anomalies 3 and 6 are a weak feature which appears 

to reflect high resistivity with a layer of gravel within a 50 ft thick overburden layer. Anomaly 5 is a weak 

response believed to reflect overburden greater than 200 ft thick and is likely spurious.  

MPH concluded that no further work is recommended based on the IP survey unless encouraging 

information from other geotechnical data is available.  

6.1.12 1983, Cannon Mines Ltd. 

During the spring of 1983, Cannon Mines Ltd. contracted Phatom Exploration Services Ltd. to establish a 

grid and conduct magnetometer and VLF-EM surveys over its property (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0052). The property consists of 12 contiguous claims covering Rous Lake. A total of 36.725 km 

of line was cut with pickets established every 25 m along the length of the grid lines which were spaced at 

an interval of 75 m.  

The magnetometer found a north-south anomaly around an island in Rous Lake which is likely due to the 

presence of a diabase dyke. Another weak north-south trending anomaly is also due to the presence of a 

diabase dyke. There is another anomaly striking northwest on the west side of the property which may be 

due to the presence of metagabbro or amphibolitic unit.  

The VLF-EM survey was not very definitive due to the presence of lake bottom clay and a power line 

along the highway. Recommendations were geological mapping and sampling.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

Autocrat Resources Ltd's ("Autocrat") requested that David R. Bell Geological Services complete a 

compilation report for their property. Autocrat's property consists of 15 contiguous unpatented mining 

claims (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0109). The claims consist of TB 632559 to TB 632573, 

inclusive. The claims are one mile north of Pringle on the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1975 to 1976, 

Noranda Mines Ltd. carried out geophysics and geology on the eastern part of Autocrat's property (see 

section 6.1.5). Noranda's diamond drilling in the area did not occur on Autocrat's property. On Autocrat's 

property, outcrops are limited to the southern ¼ of the property. The majority of the outcrops occur as 

east-west trending ridges just north of Highway 17. Limited traversing on the southern part of the 

property indicates a generally trending east-west trending sequence of mafic metavolcanics with fine-

grained tuffs. The northern part of the property is covered by a thick layer of sand and gravel overburden. 

Recommendations for exploration are establishing a control grid, VLF-EM and magnetometer surveys, 

detailed geological mapping and diamond drilling.  

Geophysics – magnetometer and VLF EM surveys 

Autocrat requested that Mid-Canada Exploration Services Limited conduct magnetometer and VLF-EM 

surveys over their property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0079). About 11.9 line miles of N-S 

picket lines, spaced at 400 ft intervals, as well as 1.4 miles of tie lines were cut in from September 20 to 

20, 1982. The line cutting was followed by magnetometer and VLF EM surveys from December 1 to 7, 

1982 and January 18 to 22, 1983, respectively.  

The magnetics appear to have mapped three separate formations from south to north suggest basic 

volcanics, then intermediate volcanics followed by a band of sediments, tuffs or perhaps rhyolite. 

Magnetic lineaments M-1 and M-2 should approximate the contacts between the formations. Lineament 

M-3 suggests a tight fold in the contact or possibly a low magnetic dyke. Lineament M-4 indicates an 

east-west diabase dyke, M-5 indicates a narrow east-west pyrrhotite band, and M-6 suggests a local more 

mafic flow.  

Five conductive zones, Zones A to E, have been interpreted from the VLF EM data. Zone A is a long, 

strong definite anomaly that displays good conductivity and is a first priority target. Zone B lies a few 

hundred feet south of Zone A and is weaker and less conductive, but warrants a second priority rating.  

Zone A and B lies on the north flank of a hill and could be related to or enhanced by currents along the 

edge of conductive overburden which lies to the north. Zones C, D, E are short, weak conductors that lie 

in an area of heavy overburden. They are considered to be third priority targets.

Recommendations include detailed geological mapping with attention to the magnetic and VLF-EM 

anomalies, detailed IP survey and detailed geochemical sampling. IP is preferred to EM in the Hemlo area 

because of the low metallic content of the gold-bearing horizons.  

Geophysics – IP survey 

MPH Consulting Limited ("MPH") conducted a reconnaissance IP surveys in June, July and August 1983 

for 10 companies including Autocrat (see section 6.1.16) (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0109).  

Autocrat's survey was completed between mid-June and late July. MPH identified 4 anomalies on 

Autocrat's property. Anomaly 1 is caused by outcropping or near outcropping bedrock and therefore 

probably represents a lithologic response rather than a confined sulphide accumulation. Evidence from a 

magnetic survey conducted on the property suggests that the anomaly is underlain by predominately basic 

volcanic rocks. Anomaly 2 is a weak anomaly due to thick overburden conditions. Anomaly 3 is a broad 

anomaly which probably reflects ubiquitous mineralization in the bedrock which is indicated by the high 

resistivities recorded in the area. Anomaly 4 is a very weak response which is not well defined because of 

limits to the survey coverage. It may be caused by thick overburden conditions. A limited amount of 

detailed survey was recommended to investigate this anomaly.  

Geological mapping and geochemical soil sampling 

OreQuest Consultants Ltd. conducted field work for Autocrat and Templar Mining Corp. on Autocrat's 

property in 1983 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0545). The field work consisted of limited 

geological mapping, a reconnaissance IP survey and ground VLF-HEM electromagnetic and magnetic 

survey.  

The southern six claims are occupied by a generally east-west trending ridge of mafic metavolcanics 

intruded by Heron Bay Pluton (hornblende biotite granodiorite) to the south, east-west trending felsic 

porphyritic dykes and diabase dykes striking north-south.  

A total of 78 humus samples and 97 soil samples were collected during the field work. The geochemical 

soil sampling was intentionally restricted to the ridge on the southern portion of the property. The thick 

accumulation of fine silty sand (glaciolacustrine deposit) associated with the Black River is an effective 

barrier against detecting mineralization bedrock using surface sampling geochemical methods and thus 

the northern 2/3 of the property was not geochemically sampled. All samples were analyzed for Au, Ag, 

Mo, As, Cu and Zn. There were no anomalous values for Au, Ag, Mo and Zn. Three scattered isolated 

samples recorded high Cu values which range from 500 and 2,020 ppm. All of these samples appear to be

underlain by mafic metavolcanics. Anomalous As was recorded in four samples which coincide with a 

diabase dyke which cross cuts the mafic metavolcanics.  

Recommendations for exploration are fence-type diamond drilling along the N-S section of the basin and 

seismic or gravity survey to assist in selecting drill sites. The seismic survey also has the potential to 

identify baritic facies associated with gold mineralization as barite acts as an attenuator of seismic signals.  

6.1.14 1982-1983, International Laco Resources Inc.  

Geology compilation 

David R. Bell Geological Services was commissioned by International Laco Resources Inc. ("Laco") to 

prepare a compilation report on their 16 contiguous unpatented claims (TB 632739 to TB 632754, 

inclusive) located 5.5 miles west of Hemlo (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0028). Rock exposures 

are sparse being limited to the northwestern corner of the property and a prominent ridge in the west 

central portion. Elsewhere, extensive sand and river deposits are expected to deeply cover bedrock. The 

claims are underlain by a series of mafic to felsic volcanic flows and pyroclastics. The geology on the 

property consists of a series of intermediate to felsic volcanic flows and pyroclastics interbedded with 

mafic metavolcanic tuffs and lapilli tuffs. These generally have an east north-easterly strike and dip 

vertically to steeply north. Shearing is pervasive and silicification and minor pyrite mineralization is 

common. Recommendations for Phase I exploration included establishing a control grid, detailed 

geological mapping, lithiogeochemistry sampling, IP survey and stripping. Recommendation for Phase II 

is 2,000 ft of AQ diamond drilling. 

Geophysics – magnetometer and VLF-EM surveys 

Mid-Canada Exploration services cut 14.4 miles of N-S pickets lines, spaced at 400 ft intervals, as well as 

2.8 miles of tie lines from October 1 to 15, 1982 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0078).  

Mid-Canada Exploration Services Limited carried out a magnetometer and VLF-EM survey over Laco's 

property from Jan. 10 to 17, 1983 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0078). Five magnetic lineaments 

were interpreted from the data. Lineament M-1 indicates a short E-W trending diabase dyke. Lineament 

M-2 displays 800 gammas relief and may be more magnetic portion of a flow or an intrusive. Lineaments 

M-3 and M-4 suggest N-S diabase dykes and M-5 is a N-S trending fault or low magnetic dyke. Six 

conductive zones lettered Zone A to F, inclusive have been interpreted from the VLF-EM data. The 

strong VLF responses along the south boundary are due to a power line and have not been zoned. Zone A

has a E-W strike and moderate conductivity and is classified as a second priority target. Zone B is a 

moderate conductor that may cross a mafic metavolcanic outcrop and warrants geological examination. 

Zones C and D correlates with the Black River. They display variable conductivity but are considered 

first priority targets. Zone E is a poor conductor and a second priority anomaly. Zone F correlates closely 

with a photo lineament. It is a moderate conductor and has been given a first priority rating. 

Recommendations for exploration were detailed geological mapping with attention to the magnetic 

lineaments and VLF zones, IP survey and detailed geochemical sampling. IP is preferred to EM in the 

Hemlo camp because of the low metallic content of the gold-bearing horizons. 

Between mid-July and mid-August 1983, OreQuest Consultants Ltd. conducted prospecting, limited 

geological mapping, claim post survey, soil geochemical sampling and a reconnaissance IP survey 

(MNDMF assessment file: 42D16SE0040). They concluded based on field work done to date that the 

property is geologically well situated and has a reasonable potential to host another Hemlo-type gold ore 

deposit. However due to thick accumulations of glacial overburden, traditional methods of exploration are 

not adequate. 

Geological mapping 

Overburden covers approximately 80% of Laco's property and overburden is estimated to be greater than 

10 m except on a linear ridge in the south west corner of the property where outcrop is exposed. This 

ridge shows a succession of intermediate metavolcanic rocks intercalated with mafic metavolcanic and 

metasedimentary rocks. The above units are intruded by later felsic and mafic intrusions. The 

Intermediate metavolcanics make up the majority of the rocks exposed and consist of moderately foliated 

fine- to medium-grained tuff, lapilli tuff and crystal tuff. Interbedded within the metavolcanics are 

medium to poorly bedded wackes, arkosic wackes and unsubdivied metasedimentary rocks. The only 

mafic metavolcanic rock found on the property was a fine-grained well-foliated mafic tuff. The 

succession of metavolcanics and metasedimentary rocks are intruded by late felsic dykes (quartz feldspar 

porphyries). The only mafic intrusive found was a medium-grained diabase dyke. A zone of carbonate 

and silica alteration in both the intermediate volcanics and the later felsic dykes was traced across most of 

the ridge. Pyrite is often abundant in the altered areas.  

Soil sampling 

A total of 66 soil samples and 9 rock samples were collected. All samples were analyzed for Au, Ag, Mo, 

Cu, Zn and As by atomic absorption, except for Au which was analyzed by fire assay. There was one

isolated Cu anomaly (81 ppm) and one isolated As anomaly (15 ppm). Based on overall geochemical 

standards, these assays are considered low and appear insignificant.  

Geophysics - IP survey 

Results of the ¾ mile reconnaissance IP survey conducted on the property in July 1983 outlined two 

anomalies, but due to the width of the anomalies and the low response, they are somewhat downgraded as 

possible sulphide alteration zones. A study of the magnetic data obtained from a combination of all 

ground and airborne magnetic survey available for the Laco property and Hemlo gold belt enabled 

OreQuest to correlate favourable stratigraphic horizons across the property. The property can be divided 

into two E-W trending magnetic domains. A high magnetic domain occupying the southern part of the 

property corresponds to the mafic metavolcanic unit. The low magnetic response in the remaining part of 

property corresponds to metasediments or felsic volcanic rocks. Another zone of high magnetic response 

is located in the north-west corner of the property and likely corresponds to a faulted/folded block of the 

mafic metavolcanic unit.  

Recommendations for exploration are fence-type diamond drilling along the N-S section of the basin and 

seismic or gravity survey to assist in selecting drill sites. The seismic survey also has the potential to 

identify baritic facies associated with gold mineralization as barite acts as an attenuator of seismic signals.  

6.1.15 1982-1983, International Corona Resources - Galveston Petroleums Limited, 

joint venture 

International Corona Resources – Galveston Petroleums Limited ("Corona-Galveston") joint venture 

property consists of 60 contiguous unpatented mining claims located 8 miles west of Hemlo. The historic 

claim numbers are TB 632589 to TB632596 and TB632601 to TB632652, all inclusive. The property lies 

along the side of the Black River Valley which is relatively flat plain of approximately 2 miles wide that 

is surrounded by rocky hills rising to 500 ft above the valley floor to the north. 

Geophysics – magnetometer and VLF-EM 

In the autumn of 1982, Mid-Canada Exploration Services completed line cutting, total field magnetics and 

VLF-EM for Corona-Galveston (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0083). A total of 58.11 miles of grid 

lines were established. The only previous mineral exploration was ground geophysics on the most 

southerly claim by Noranda in 1975. The geology of the property consists of an east-west belt of

intercalated metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The Gowan Lake Pluton (quartz monzonite) lies to 

the north and the Heron Bay Pluton (granodiorite) to the south. The rocks were cut by diabase dykes.  

The magnetics showed two high northwesterly-trending anomalies in the west part of the property which 

are likely due to diabase dykes, but they appear to occupy the contact between a northwesterly-trending 

zone of generally lower magnetics and areas of higher magnetic values on the southwesterly claims and 

towards the north boundary. The results of the VLF-EM survey indicated 12 conductors labeled A to L 

which are related to features of overlying bedrock. Of these 12 conductors, two are on or near the 

metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact, six are in metasedimentary rocks and three are south of the 

metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact. Anomaly F cuts across the strike of the geology in a 

northwesterly direction and represents a fault or shear zone parallel to the general trend of the diabase 

dyke.  

Geological mapping and soil sampling 

In July 1983, portions of the previously cut grid was geologically mapped and soil geochemical samples 

were collected by Teck Explorations Limited for Corona-Galveston (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0015). Because of the extensive overburden south of the Black River, the 1983 field program 

was limited to the area north of the Black River. The results of the mapping indicates that the property is 

underlain by a 4,500 ft wide east-northeast trending metasedimentary belt bounded by metavolcanics to 

the north and south. The mafic metavolcanics are flows and tuffs that appear to have originally been 

basaltic in composition. Intermediate and felsic metavolcanics outcrop in the southwest and northeast 

corners of the block.  The intermediate volcanics are mainly crystal tuffs of andesitic composition and the 

felsic volcanics are ash tuffs. The metasediments are mainly argillite and arkosic sediments. Felsic and 

diabase dykes also cross cut the property.  

A total of 3442 soil samples were taken. The results indicated that there were a total of 97 samples with 

anomalous gold (18 to 51 ppb Au) and a total of 42 highly anomalous samples with greater than 51 ppb 

Au. The highly anomalous samples are located in either areas of wet swamp or deep sandy till.  

A compilation of geology, geochemistry and previous geophysics surveys reveals two VLF-EM 

conductors are located in close proximity to the metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact and 15 highly 

anomalous gold values were detected in soil samples taken in areas underlain by metasediments. It is 

recommended that geochemical surveys be completed to confirm and detail these anomalies. The two 

VLF-EM conductors near the metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact should be drilled.

6.1.16 Summary of exploration in Lecours-Bomby townships for 1982-1983 

The following exploration companies had property which overlaps Entourage's current Rous-Bomby 

claims and completed field work from 1981 to 1983, from east to west (Figure 6-4): 

• Bel-Air Resources Limited 
• Triple Crown Resources Ltd. 
• Youngman Oil and Gas 
• Autocrat Resources Ltd 
• International Rhodes Resources Ltd. 
• International Laco Resources Ltd..  
• International Corona – Galveston Petroleums 

The majority of the exploration companies' field work from 1981 to 1983 followed this sequence:  

1. geology compilation reports by D.R. Bell Geological Services, and reconnaissance geological 
mapping (1982) 

2. line cutting, magnetometer and VLF EM surveys by Mid-Canada (late 1982- early 1983) 
3. geological mapping and soil sampling by OreQuest or Teck (1983) 
4. reconnaissance IP survey by Mid-Canada (summer 1983) 

International Rhodes requested MPH to complete a reconnaissance IP survey on their property in 1983, 

but the results were not filed for assessment.   

The physiography of the area is east-west trending outcrop ridges along Highway #17, plains of thick 

sand, silt and clay along Black River and more outcrop ridges north of Black River. Overall the geology 

of the area consists of intercalated metasediments, felsic metavolcanics and mafic 

metavolcanics/amphibolite intruded by Heron Bay Pluton (granodiorite), felsic dykes and diabase dykes. 

The thick overburden and the power line north of Highway#17 consistently caused interference for the 

geophysical surveys. The magnetometer surveys consistently identified the presence of mafic 

metavolcanics and diabase dykes. The magnetometer survey also mapped the boundaries between high 

magnetic response (mafic metavolcanics) and low magnetic response (felsic metavolcanics and 

metasedimentary rocks).   

MPH – IP survey 

MPH Consulting Limited ("MPH") conducted a reconnaissance IP surveys in June, July and August 1983 

for the following 10 companies:  

• Triple Crown Resources Ltd.  

• Youngman Oil and Gas Limited

• Autocrat Resources Ltd.  

• International Rhodes Resources Ltd. 

• Tuscaloosa Oil and Gas Ltd.  

• Laco Resources Ltd.  

• Intercontinental Energy Corp. 

• Devonian Resources Ltd.  

• Southern Union Resources Ltd 

• El Paso Energy Corp.  

The properties for a contiguous 6 mile by 3 mile block west of the village of Hemlo (MNDMF 

assessment file: 42D09NE0109). The objective of the surveys was to explore for sulphide horizons 

similar to the horizon which hosts the gold deposits at Hemlo to the east.  A limited amount of detailed IP 

coverage was carried out on selected anomalies detected by the primary coverage. Access for the surveys 

was provided by picket grid systems. The Triple Crown Resources and Youngman Oil and Gas properties 

were covered by separate unrelated grid system and the Autocrat Resources to El Paso Energy properties 

were covered by a single extensive grid system.  

The results of the survey were displayed by MPH Consulting in pseudosection format showing apparent 

resistivity and chargeability. Contours are at semi-logarithmic intervals because of the wide range, in 

particular in the resistivity results, in the recorded data. The term "pseudosection" is used because the 

plotted depth does not necessarily represent the actual depth at which the measurement was made.  

The discussion of the IP survey anomalies and interpretations are given in the individual sections for each 

company. Only the eastern edge of Southern Union Resources Ltd, Devonian Resources Ltd and 

Intercontinental Energy Corp. historic properties overlap with Entourage's current Rous-Bomby property, 

but there were no IP anomalies from these historic properties which correspond to Entourage's current 

property. Only IP targets that occur on Entourage's property will be discussed in this report. El Paso 

Energy Corp.'s historic property does not overlap with Entourage's current property and will not be 

discussed in this report.

6.1.17 1984, Westfield Minerals Ltd./Bel Air Resources Ltd. 

The 1984 exploration program on the Bel Air property by Westfield included completion of the B horizon 

geochemical sampling program, detailed structural mapping and prospecting on the property, opening and 

sampling of almost 500 ft of additional trenching and drilling of nine holes totalling 5,081 ft (=1,549 m) 

labelled as 84-1 to 84-8 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0615). Drill core logs and assays for the 

nine 1984 holes were not given in the assessment file.  

Structural mapping 

The structural mapping strongly indicated that the main volcaniclastic unit on the property is a lateral 

overtuned equivalent of the volcaniclastic units that host the orebodies to the east. The presence of the 

pyritic alteration zones along the margins of this plus the presence of green mica and Mo is another 

similarity with the Hemlo deposits to the east. In spite of all of the 1984 exploration work, no repeatable 

Au analyses were obtained.  

6.1.18 1985, Westfield Minerals Ltd./Belont Resources Ltd 

Drilling 

Westfield conducted limited exploration on the Bel Air property in 1985 (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0615). Some of the drill core from the 1984 program was sampled and analyzed for Au and Mo, 

but the results were disappointing.  

September 17-30, 1985, Westfield drilled four diamond drill holes (BQ) for a total of 1,786 ft (=544 m) 

on the Bel Air property on claims TB 624276, 624277 and 624241 along Highway #17 (Table 6-3). Two 

holes (85-1 and 85-4) were to test the westward strike of the Muir or Highway showing and two holes 

(85-2 and 85-3) were to drill the North Volcaniclastic Unit. DDH 85-1 intersected the Muir or Highway 

showing between 127 and 130.5 ft which is a fine fragmental unit with bright green mica and between 3-

5% pyrite. A one foot sample from 128.3 to 129.3 ft assayed 160 ppb Au from this hole, but the rest of 

the section had low Au values. Westfield summarized that the holes intersected low Au values and had 

nothing of interest. They also stated that any future exploration work should be carried out by someone 

other than Westfield.

6.1.19 1984, Gold Fields Mining Corp. 

Property amalgamation 

Gold Fields conducted an exploration program on seven properties under an option agreement (dated May 

8, 1984) in 1984 and 1985:  

1. Youngman Oil and Gas Ltd 

2. Rabbit Oil and Gas Ltd. 

3. Triple Crown Resources Ltd.  

4. Jack Criswell Resources/ Autocrat property 

5. International Rhodes Resources Ltd.  

6. International Laco Resources Ltd.  

7. International Corona Resources Ltd. 

At some point in 1984, the Autocrat Resources Ltd property was transferred to Jack Criswell Resources 

Ltd. 

Geophysics – magnetic survey 

Kenting Earth Sciences Ltd. conducted airborne magnetic survey for Gold Fields from April 14 to 24, 

1984 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0014). A total of 1,025 km of data was collected for this 

survey consisting of 962 km for 202 traverses plus 63 km for 4 control lines. No results for the magnetic 

survey were given in this assessment file. The assessment file only describes the instrumentation used for 

the survey and the types of data processing that was completed.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

Gold Fields contracted McElhanney Mapping Services for an airborne orthophoto survey of the entire 

property package (approximately 4,000 ha). The orthographic photogrammetric survey was conducted on 

May 15, 1984. Black and white, snow-free, leaf-free photos photography was flown at a photographic 

scale of 1:16,000.  

Geophysics - gravity survey 

E. Gaucher and Associates conducted a gravity survey from May 22 to June 22, 1984 over six contiguous 

properties which were under an option agreement to Gold Fields (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0014).  The purpose of the survey was to determine the overburden thickness variations on the 

property to aid in the planning of a diamond drill program.  

A total of 803 gravity and terrain elevation readings were taken. The general station separation was 200 ft 

along lines generally 1,600 ft apart.  

The grid lines were cut and chained prior to Gold Fields involvement with the project. All of the 

properties were originally tied to the same grid chaining reference points except for Youngman's grid 

which is independent of the other properties.  

The gravity survey identified a deep east-west channel along the southern claim options, immediately 

north of the bedrock ridge which parallels the north side of Highway 17. The approximate maximum 

channel overburden depths are on the order of 600-800 ft.  

Geological mapping and lithogeochemistry sampling – Rabbit property 

Geological mapping, rock sampling, and prospecting carried out June 1 to 23, 1984 (MNDMF assessment 

file: 42D09NE0014). The southern 1/3 of the property lies within the Black River Valley which consists 

of sands, silts, clays and minor gravels. Overburden depths within the valley are indicated from gravity 

work to be up to 400 ft. Areas of outcrop occur mainly in the northern 2/3 of the property and are 

separated by swampy flats and sandy knolls.  

The claim group was mapped at a scale of 1 in = 200 ft. Mapping revealed a similar but more detailed 

geological interpretation as outlined by Dr. Richard Scratch (Oct. 21, 1983). The northern 2/3 of the 

property is composed of a central area of intermediate volcanic rocks (i.e., calc-alkali andesitic 

pyroclastics) sandwiched between two metasedimentary packages (i.e., volcanic conglomerates, wackes, 

siltstones and pelitic siltstones). Dividing the central volcanic rocks into two equal segments is a small 

section of polymictic volcanic derived conglomerate. The northern metasedimentary package appears to

be the south limb of a synform comprised entirely of metasedimentary rocks. Three large diabase dykes 

are exposed on the property and three others which subcrop in the heavily overburdened southwest third 

of the property are inferred from linear gradient magnetic anomalies. The diabase dykes are gabbroic in 

composition and contain at least 5% magnetite content. There are three main directions of the diabase 

dykes: NNE, NW and E-W. One small E-W trending feldspar porphyry intruding andesitic tuffs occurs on 

the property. No important mineralized areas were found during mapping.   

Of the 360 rock samples collected and assayed for Au, no values exceeded 120 ppb Au and only four 

samples were in the 90-120 ppb Au range, but these were scattered across the claim group. Of the 340 

samples analyzed for Mo, none were considered to be above background.  

The recommendation for future exploration is a drill hole in the heavily overburdened southern third of 

the property to test for favourable stratigraphic horizons and mineralized alteration zones.  

Geological mapping and lithogeochemistry sampling – Triple Crown property 

Geological mapping and rock sampling was carried out July 4 to July 17, 1984 on Triple Crown's 

property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). The southern ¼ of the property lies in the Black 

River valley and consists of sand, silt and clay, and minor gravel. Overburden depths within the valley are 

indicated from gravity work to be up to 400 ft thick. Areas of rock exposure occur in the northern ¾ of 

the property.  

The claim group was mapped at a scale of 1 inch = 200 ft along grid lines. The grid consists of 10 N-S 

grid lines and an E-W baseline. The grid lines numbered L80E through L116E were cut at 400 ft intervals 

perpendicular to the base line and chained at 100 ft station intervals. Total line miles chained were 20.8 

miles.  

The property is underlain by east-northeast trending clastic and volcaniclastic metasedimentary rocks 

intruded by diabase and feldspar porphyry dykes and an ultramafic intrusion. The main lithological 

changes occurring across the property in the southeasterly direction are as follows: andesitic tuffs and 

flows and derived volcaniclastic sediment, volcaniclastic conglomerate, clastic sediment, andesitic tuffs 

and flows and derived volcaniclastic sediment, and clastic sediment.  

A total of 201 rocks samples were collected from Triple Crown property and all samples were analyzed 

for Au and Mo. Nine samples were analyzed for Sb, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pt and Pd and six samples were analyzed 

for Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, Pt and Pd. Of the 201 samples analyzed, 12 samples ranged from 10-110 ppb Au. All

of the Mo results were < 4 ppm Mo. The 12 anomalous samples came from sheared and brecciated 

peridotite and from randomly distributed locations on the property. The report concluded that no further 

work is recommended for the northern ¾ of the property because of its low economic potential for Au 

mineralization. The southern ¼ of the property is not amenable to the usual geophysical or geochemical 

evaluation due to extensive overburden cover. A drill hole is recommended for the southern ¼ of the 

property.  

Geological mapping and lithogeochemistry sampling – Youngman property 

Gold Fields carried out an exploration program May 27 to July 12, 1984 on property that it optioned from 

Youngman. The exploration program included geological mapping, prospecting and rock sampling 

(MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0014). The northern half of the property lies within the Black River 

valley and consists of Pleistocene sands, silts and clays. Gravity surveys indicate that the overburden 

depths in the valley are up to 500 ft. The geological mapping revealed that outcrops are confined to the an 

east-west ridge in the southern portion of the property and consist of amphibolitic baslt flows and 

fragmentals, mafic tuffaceous metasediments, siliceous metawackes and minor sericitic felsic metatuffs, 

transected by granodiorite, felsic feldspar porphyry and late diabase dykes. Five major diabase dykes 

cross cut the property and they are gabbroic in composition with at least 5% magnetite content.  

A total of 527 rock samples were collected and assayed for Au and Mo with 201 and 101 of these samples 

also assayed for Sb and Ag, respectively. An additional 11 samples were assayed for Au, Cu and Zn. Of 

the 572 samples analyzed for Au, 10.1% samples contained 20-199 ppb Au and are considered 

anomalous, especially if they clustered or occurred along a particular horizon. A total 4 samples or 0.7% 

of the total samples contained > 200 ppb and are considered to be very significant anomalies. Of the 561 

samples analyzed for Mo, 3 samples or 0.6% of the total samples contained > 10 ppm Mo are significant 

anomalies. A total of 17 samples or 3.0 % of the total samples contain 4-10 ppm Mo and are considered to 

be significant, especially if they had a corresponding anomalous Au value.  

Two areas were observed to contain anomalous gold in rock: 

1. The first area is located on an outcrop ridge in the southern portion of the property and 

occurs within a locally pyritized, sericitic felsic volcanic tuff which undergoes a facies 

change westward into felsic tuffaceous metasediments. This unit returned values in the 

30-160 ppb Au range associated with pyritic portions of the schist.

2. The second area is located 500 to 800 m north of the first and is underlain by sheared and 

bleached pillowed basalts and tuffs cut by numerous dykes and sills of leucocratic 

granitic feldspar porphyries as well as melanocratic syenodiorite feldspar porphyry. 

Analyses of rock samples collected over this zone have returned 20-200 ppb Au and four 

samples returned 210 ppb, 685 ppb, 0.043 oz/t and 0.049 oz/t Au. Better mineralized 

samples were taken from bleached, silicified pyritic and very magnetic pillowed basalt. 

The presence of chert and felsic tuff horizons suggests a possible original stratigraphic 

control.  

Geological mapping and lithogeochemistry sampling – Jack Criswell/Autocrat property 

Geological mapping and rock sampling was carried out July 13 to July 24, 1984 on Jack 

Criswell/Autocrat property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). A large hill, with a maximum 

elevation of 1144 ft above sea level, trends east through the southern ¼ of the property. The northern ¾ of 

the property lies within the south side of the Black River valley which consists of sand, silt and clay. 

Overburden depths within the valley are indicated from gravity work to be up to 525 ft.  

The claim group was mapped at a scale of 1 inch = 200 ft along grid lines. The grid consists of 28 N-S 

grid lines and two E-W tie lines. The gird lines, numbered L24E through L56E were cut at 400 ft intervals 

and chained at 100 ft station intervals north of tie line 80S. South of tie line 80S, grid lines numbered 

L22E through L58E have 200 ft spacing. Total line miles chained were 18.3 miles (29.5 km).  

The geological mapping and rock sampling by Gold Fields in July 1984 did not change significantly the 

geology as outlined by OreQuest in 1982. However, with the additional 200 ft spaced grid lines cut in 

1984, the geological units were more precisely tied in and outcrop areas better defined.  

The east-west trending ridge in the southern portion of the property is dominated by mafic metavolcanic 

rocks intruded by granodiorite body (Heron Bay Pluton) to the southeast, an east-trending metagabbro, 

east-trending felsic porphryritic dykes and a diabase dyke. The mafic metavolcanic rocks are 

amphibolitized basaltic flows.  

A total of 249 rock samples were collected and all were analyzed for Au, Mo and Sb and 50 were later 

assayed for Ag. Of the 249 samples analyzed, 8 samples have assays between 10 and 100 ppb Au. The 

seven samples with 10 to 50 ppb Au are likely due to local elevated pyrite content or hydrothermal 

activity associated with a gabbro, porphyry dyke or local areas of increased veining. One sample with 85 

ppb Au was from a silicified, K-altered fine-grained feldspar porphyry with trace pyrite. This weak

anomaly is too low and isolated to be given much further consideration. The rock geochemical values 

confirmed the negative soil geochemical survey results undertaken over the same outcrop ridge by 

OreQuest in 1984.  

Geological mapping and lithogeochemistry sampling – Rhodes property 

Geological mapping and rock sampling was carried out July 25 to August 7, 1984 on Rhodes' property 

(MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). The terrain is relatively flat to very gently rolling with little 

relief except for the southern ¼ of the property where there is an east-west trending bedrock ridge. The 

Black River valley deposits consist of glaciolustrine sand, silt and varved clay. A gravity survey 

conducted for Gold Fields indicates that the depth of overburden within the valley varies from 10 to 430 

ft.  

The claim group was mapped at a scale of 1 inch = 200 ft along grid lines. The grid consists of 24 N-S 

grid lines and two tie lines. Grid lines numbered L24W to L20E were cut at 400 ft intervals north of tie 

line 80S and 200 ft intervals south of tie lines 80S. Grid lines were chained at 100 ft intervals. Total line 

miles chained were 24.1 miles (38.7 km).  

In 1982-1983, Mid-Canada carried out magnetometer and VLF-EM surveys over the Rhodes property. In 

the summer of 1983, OreQuest carried out claim post survey, soil geochemical survey and geological 

mapping. The results of these surveys were not filed as assessment files.  

The property is predominately underlain by east-northeast-trending mafic metavolcanic rocks 

(amphibolitized flows). Granodioritic rocks of the Heron Bay Pluton transect the metavolcanic rocks in 

the southern portion of the exposed area while feldspar porphyry dykes and sills occur within the northern 

exposure. Diabase dykes trend northwest and transect all other rock types.  

A total of 232 samples were collected of which all 232 samples were analyzed for Au, 113 samples were 

analyzed for Sb and Mo and 50 samples were analyzed for Ag. Of the 232 samples collected, 193 samples 

assayed < 5 ppb and the remaining 39 samples ranged from 10 to 100 ppb Au. Only 3 samples (1%) had 

50-100 ppb Au. Most Mo assays were less than 2 ppm and several samples ranged from 4 to 8 ppm Mo.  

Two areas with elevated Au were identified in the extreme west end and central portion of the property. 

Both of these areas correlate with diabase dykes and there are no other anomalous gold values on the 

property.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

Geological mapping and rock sampling began July 21 and continued intermittently until October 8, 1984 

on Corona's property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). The best way to access the property is 

by helicopter because there are no roads on the property. Another option is by boat on the Black River. 

The terrain on the property is relatively flat to very gently rolling with little relief except for three areas in 

the extreme west and east ends of the property and the north central area. The Black River valley deposits 

consist of glaciolustrine sand, silt and varved clay. A gravity survey conducted for Gold Fields indicates 

that the depth of overburden within the valley is up to 400 ft. 

The claim group was mapped at a scale of 1 inch = 200 ft along grid lines. The grid consists of 46 N-S 

grid lines and one tie line south and parallel to the baseline. The grid lines numbered L78W through L80E 

were cut at 400 ft intervals perpendicular to the baseline and chained at 100 ft station intervals. West of 

L52W, grid lines have 200 ft spacing. Total line miles chained were 63.5 miles (102.8 km). 

The property is underlain by east-northeast trending, predominately clastic and volcaniclastic sedimentary 

rocks and minor amounts of mafic metavolcanic and intermediate pyroclastic rocks. These rocks are 

intruded by diabase dykes and numerous gabbro-diorite, granodiorite, syenodiorite, feldspar and quartz-

feldspar porphyry and mafic dykes/sills. The main lithological changes occurring across the property in 

the southeasterly direction are as follows: mafic metavolcanic flows, clastic metasediments, mixed clastic 

and volcaniclastic metasediments and intermediate pyroclastic rocks.  

A total of 693 rock samples were collected from the Corona property. All 693 samples were analyzed for 

Au and 215 samples were analyzed for Mo. Of the 693 samples collected, 133 samples ranged from 10 to 

200 ppb Au. Only three assays were over 200 ppb Au. The northern clastic metasedimentary rocks have 

an elevated background Au content. Through the values are low, ranging from 10-50 ppb, there are over 

100 such anomalous samples in this group. These values are distributed over a considerable strike length 

and width and are not restricted to a particular stratigraphic bed. Superimposed on this general elevated 

background gold zone are areas of more concentrated (sample density) geochemical highs where values 

range from 5 to > 200 ppb Au.  

This anomalous gold zone correlates with the geology. The rocks in the area of concern have been 

intruded by numerous dykes/sills of predominately feldspar porphyry and are moderately well-fractured 

along which localized wall rock alteration occurs. It appears that the intensity of the alteration increases 

towards these feldspar porphyry dykes/sills. Some of the elevated Au values correlate with diabase dykes.

Geological mapping and rock sampling began July 21 and continued intermittently until October 8, 1984 

on Corona's property (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). The terrain on the property is relatively 

flat to very gently rolling with little relief except for two areas, the northwest and southwest corners of the 

property. The Black River valley occupies a large portion of the property. The Black River valley deposits 

consist of glaciolustrine sand, silt and varved clay. A gravity survey conducted for Gold Fields indicates 

that the depth of overburden within the valley is up to 400 ft. Bedrock exposure is limited to the two areas 

with moderate relief.  

The claim group was mapped at a scale of 1 inch = 200 ft along grid lines. The grid consists of 24 N-S 

grid lines and two tie lines. The grid lines, numbered L88W to L24W north of the Black River were cut at 

400 ft intervals and the grid lines numbered L76W and L24W south of the Black River were cut at 200 ft 

internals. Grid lines were chained at 100 ft station intervals. Total line miles chained were 17.8 miles 

(28.6 km).  

The property is underlain by east northeast trending clastic and volcaniclastic metasediments intercalated 

with minor amounts of metavolcanic rocks. These rocks are intruded by diabase and feldspar porphyry 

dykes/sills. The main lithological changes occurring across the property is a southeasterly direction are as 

follows: intercalated intermediate metavolcanic and volcaniclastic rocks in the northwest outcrop area and 

massive intermediate metavolcanic and intercalated volcaniclastic – clastic sedimentary rocks in the 

southwest outcrop area.  

A total of 134 rock samples were collected from the Laco property. All 134 samples collected were 

analyzed for Au and 50 samples were analyzed for Ag. Of the 134 samples, 12 samples ranged from 10 to 

100 ppb Au of which only one sample assayed over 50 ppb Au. All Ag assays were < 0.2 ppm Ag. The 

report concluded that the 12 anomalous Au samples are not useful in locating drill targets because of their 

very low gold content and general scatter across the property. The areas of rock exposure on the property 

hold little potential for finding economic Au deposits.

Geophysics – magnetics/shadow relief study 

The results of the high resolution vertical gradient and total field airborne magnetometer survey 

conducted by Kenting Earth Sciences Limited in April 1984 have been subjected to a number of 

computerized refinements by J. Puckett, independent geophysical consultant and issued in a report dated 

Nov. 13, 1985 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). This work was conducted as an effort to

delineate otherwise unnoticeable structures. The effects of the flight line altitude differences are fairly 

prominent in the total field data, whereas these effects tend to be negligible in the vertical gradient data. 

No results were reported in the assessment files.  

Geophysics – gravity 

E. Gaucher & Associates Inc. and Gold Fields conducted 28.9 miles of gravity survey over 161 claims in 

the Lecours Township – Rous Lake area and Three-D Gravity Incorporated assisted with the 

computerized gravity interpretation (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0003). The work started May 

1984 and was completed in fiscal 1985 and presented in a report November 1984 by P. Knox, Chief 

Geophysicist, Gold Fields. This data was subsequently subjected to series of computerized modelling and 

refining procedures directed at determining the estimated depth of overburden. This information would 

assist in selecting drill sites in areas of shallow to moderate overburden. Previous drilling programs have 

been forced to abandon holes after intersecting 380 ft of overburden.  

The results indicate an overburden-filled trough occupies the central portion of the property and in part 

coincides with the location of the Black River. This trough locally has a depth to bedrock in excess of 400 

ft. It trends approximately E-W within the central portion of its length across the property with both the 

east and west portions having a strike of 60º on the property. Subsidiary lobes of the trough appear to 

trend 110º and correlate with fractures and diabase dykes.  

Drilling 

Gold Fields conducted a drill program for six properties in the Hemlo area 1984-1985 (Table 6-4) 

(MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE0119). Gold Fields conducted a drill program in August-September 

1984 for Youngman. They drilled three NQ holes for a total of 4160 ft. Gold Fields also conducted a drill 

program for 4 other companies in February and March 1985. They drilled two NQ holes for International 

Laco for a total of 3110 ft, one NQ-WL hole for International Rhodes for a depth of 3558 ft, one NQ hole 

for Jack Criswell Resources Ltd. ("Jack Criswell") on Autocrat property for a depth of 3601 ft, one NQ 

hole for Rabbit for a depth of 2340 ft and one NQ hole for Triple Crown for a depth of 2511 ft.  

The drill holes coordinates in the drill hole logs are in local grid coordinates, UTM coordinates are given 

in Appendix 4.

Drill core assay interpretation 

The synthesis of the assay results are given in a separate report dated Aug. 21, 1985 (Table 6-5) 

(MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE0003). A number of anomalous Ba and Au zones were detected on 

the southern parts of Youngman, Criswell and Rhodes properties in holes Y84-1, Y84-2, Y84-3, A85-1 

and RD85-1. Electron microprobes studies of the anomalous Ba samples confirm that the Ba occurs as 

barium orthoclase (hyalophane, (K, Ba)AlSi3O8). The hyalophane is not megascopically visible and 

occurs within the rock and along microfractures. Hyalophane has been confirmed within a very few 

megascopic quartz-calcite-feldspar veinlets.  

The Ba zones define hydrothermal conduits and often display contiguous, anomalous gold aureoles and 

less frequently coincidental gold anomalies. The Ba zones generally occur within mafic volcanic units 

including pillowed lavas and tuffaceous horizons. They are carbonated and display a regionally pervasive 

biotite amphibolite mineral assemblage. At the time of writing the report, the anomalous Ba and better Au 

values within Gold Fields' areas occur within the northern portion of the Botham Lake Formation. The 

lithologies within this portion are characterized by a mafic terrain transected by numerous porphyries.  

Anomalous Mo values positively correlate with the anomalous Ba zones, often correlate well with faulted 

areas and often occur within or adjacent to porphyries.  

No Au, Ba or Mo values of any significance have been identified in the assays from the holes drilled on 

the Rabbit, Triple Crown and Laco properties.

Drilling – Youngman 

An additional three widely-spaced long holes (Y86-1 to 3, inclusive) totalling 3444.5 ft were drilled on 

Youngman property by Gold Fields commencing in November 1985 and completed in early February 

1986 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE8800). These holes were drilled on the southern portion of the 

property to fill in the geological information and test the stratigraphy across strike and at depth for Au 

mineralization.  

6.1.21 1984, Tuscaloosa Oil and Gas Ltd.  

Overburden drilling 

OreQuest/Heath and Sherwood Drilling completed an overburden drill program for Intercontinental 

Energy Corp., Tuscaloosa Oil and Gas Ltd. ("Tuscaloosa"), El Paso Energy Corp. and Devonian 

Resources Ltd. in 1984 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0044). These four properties form a 

contiguous block. Only Tuscaloosa's property overlaps with Entourage's current property. Conventional 

exploration such as soil sampling and mapping were severely hampered due to lack of outcrop exposure 

and deep overburden cover. Conventional methods were replaced by an overburden drill program. The 

goal of the program was to delineate any gold dispersion trains in glacial till and to sample and identify 

the underlying bedrock. Drill holes were located 200 m apart on NW-SE trending traverse lines. The 

traverse lines were oriented at 90º to the ice direction and separated by 600 to 800 m spacing.  

The overburden drilling indicated that most of the area is covered by at least 50 m of overburden 

consisting of sand, clay varves and a thin pebbly till ( 2 m thick) at the base of the section. In the deeper 

holes (80 m) depressions have been filled by thick accumulations of gravel and washed till. Only one gold 

grain was identified from a till sample taken from hole EP-01 (El Paso property) and it appears to be of 

distal origin. Geochemical analysis of the fine fraction of till and bedrock ¼ sample split showed only one 

truly anomalous sample (sample RC-IT-10-13) with > 15,000 ppb Au. This anomalous sample was taken

at the bottom of hole IT-10 (Intercontinental property) in gravel till. Unfortunately, it occurs as a single 

point anomaly and the hole was abandoned without reaching bedrock because depths exceeded the 

capacity of the drill rig. Further overburden drilling is not recommended because of the lack of well 

developed basal till.  

Diamond drilling 

Tuscaloosa completed a single diamond drill hole totaling 904 m in 1986, but no assays were reported.  

6.1.22 Summary of exploration in Lecours-Bomby townships for 1984-1985 

Westfield /Bel Air property 

In 1984 and 1985, exploration on the Bel Air property was performed by Westfield Minerals (Figure 6-5). 

In 1984, Westfield completed a geochemical soil sampling program of the B horizon, structural mapping 

program and 9 drill holes totalling 5,081 ft. In 1985, Westfield assayed some of the drill core from the 

1984 holes and drilled an additional 4 holes. Westfield summarized that the holes intersected low Au 

values and had nothing of interest. 

Gold Fields/ seven properties 

On May 8, 1984, Gold Fields optioned seven properties (Figure 6-5):  

8. Youngman Oil and Gas Ltd 

9. Rabbit Oil and Gas Ltd. 

10. Triple Crown Resources Ltd.  

11. Jack Criswell Resources/ Autocrat property 

12. International Rhodes Resources Ltd.  

13. International Laco Resources Ltd.  

14. International Corona Resources Ltd. 

These seven properties were treated as one package and Gold Fields conducted an exploration program on 

them. In the spring of 1984, Gold Fields contracted Kenting Earth Services Ltd. to conduct an airborne 

magnetic survey, contracted McElhanney Mapping Services for airborne orthophotos, and contracted 

Edwin Gaucher and Associates to conduct a gravity survey to determine the depth of the overburden.

In the summer of 1984, Gold Fields completed geological mapping at 1 inch = 200 ft scale and 

lithogeochemistry sampling of the package. Two anomalous gold areas were indentified on the 

Youngman property. The Corona property indicated that anomalous gold zone correlates with the 

intrusion of numerous dykes/sills of predominately feldspar porphyry and are moderately well-fractured 

along which localized wall rock alteration The sampling on the Rabbit, Triple Crown, Autocrat, Rhodes 

and Laco resulted scattered low Au assays.  

In 1985, Gold Fields contracted J. Puckett to conduct a computerized refinement of the high resolution 

vertical gradient and total field airborne magnetometer survey conducted by Kenting Earth Sciences 

Limited in April 1984. In 1984-1985, E. Gaucher & Associates Inc. and Gold Fields conducted 28.9 miles 

of gravity survey over 161 claims in the Lecours Township – Rous Lake area and Three-D Gravity 

Incorporated assisted with the computerized gravity interpretation. This data was subsequently subjected 

to series of computerized modelling and refining procedures directed at determining the estimated depth 

of overburden. 

Gold Fields conducted a drill program for six properties in the Hemlo area 1984-1985. The drill program 

consisted of 9 holes totalling 19,280 ft. Gold Fields conducted a drill program in August-September 1984 

for Youngman. They drilled two holes for Laco, one for hole Rhodes, one hole for Jack Criswell, one hole 

for Rabbit and one hole for Triple Crown. A number of anomalous Ba and Au zones were detected on the 

southern parts of Youngman, Criswell and Rhodes properties. The Ba zones define hydrothermal conduits 

and often display contiguous, anomalous gold aureoles and less frequently coincidental gold anomalies. 

No Au, Ba or Mo values of any significance have been identified in the assays from the holes drilled on 

the Rabbit, Triple Crown and Laco properties. Gold Fields also drilled one hole for Jack Criswell in 

October 1985.  

Tuscaloosa 

Tuscaloosa contracted OreQuest/Heath and Sherwood Drilling to conduct overburden drilling in 1984 

(Figure 6-5). Only one Au grain in till was identified and one anomalous geochemical rock sample. They 

recommended that further overburden drilling is not recommended because of the lack of well developed 

basal till.

6.1.23 1986, Gold Fields Canadian Mining Ltd./Jack Criswell Ltd.  

In 1986, Gold Fields drilled another hole on the Autocrat property (A86-1), totaling 304.49 m in length 

(MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2001). This hole mainly intersected mafic flows and their altered 

equivalents, interbedded with minor felsic to intermediate tuffs. A fault/shear zone characterized by a 

strongly schistose, friable, biotite-chlorite-carbonate-magnetite schist, containing 2-3% disseminated 

pyrite, was intersected at 282 m downhole. No analytical results were reported for this hole.   

6.1.24 1988, Esso Minerals Canada/ Bel Air property 

Esso Minerals Canada ("EMC"), a division of Esso Resources Canada Limited ("ERCL"), conducted an 

exploration program on five properties in the Bomby township in 1988 (MNDMF assessment file number 

42D09NE0097): 

1. Bomby- Bel-Air 

2. Bomby – Harlin 

3. Bomby – Dakota 

4. Bomby – Caulfield 

5. Bomby – Enterprise 

Only the Bel Air property overlaps with the Entourage's current property, so the other properties will not 

be discussed in this report. In September 1987, the 36 eastern claims for Bel-Air lasped and were restaked 

by ERCL that month. Two southwestern claims lapsed shortly thereafter and were staked by Mr. Mel Joa 

and subsequently purchased by ERCL. The two northwestern claims were restaked by EMC during the 

1988 work.  

From May to October 1988, the exploration program by EMC on all of the Bomby properties included 

line cutting, geological mapping, outcrop stripping and sampling and geophysics and limited geochemical 

surveying. The magnetic survey results were used to extrapolate contacts during geological mapping. The 

geological maps were mapped to 1:2,000 scale. The stripped outcrops were mapped at 1:100 scale and 

channel sampled. The lithogeochemistry samples were analyzed for Au, Ba and Mo. Soil samples were 

collected at 12.5 or 25 m intervals along grid lines, generally in areas of limited overburden. The soil 

samples were analyzed for Cu, Pb, Zn, Mo, Hg, Ag, Au, As and Sb.  

The magnetic surveying on the Bel-Air property was completed during late June and early July, 1988 and 

geological mapping was completed during June to September, 1988. The geology north of Cigar and

Cache Lakes consists of conglomerate horizons interspersed with the intermediate clastic sediments. 

Sericite-pyrite mineralization along the northern and southern Lecours zones (previously known as the 

East Pyrite Zone and the Main Pyrite Zone, respectively) at the contacts of one conglomerate unit 

returned a few significant assays (up to 2.74 g/t Au). Soil samples were collected over an area covering 

the conglomerate and extending northward to Highway 17 were feldspathized mafic metavolcanic rocks 

bearing minor sulphides were identified. Four high Au values in the soils were not reproduced on 

resampling and no continuous anomalies were defined by the soil sampling.  

Four outcrops along the southern Lecours zone and another on the south side of Highway 17 were 

stripped, channel sampled and mapped at 1:100 scale. The few significant Au values from the channel 

sampling could not be reproduced by either resampling of the outcrops or re-analyzing the pulps from the 

original samples.  

Geological mapping 

The Bel-Air property geology consists of several lithological groups, from oldest to youngest: 

• Microwave Tower Group (northern parts of the claim) – mafic metavolcanic rocks. The rocks are 

characterized by moderate amplitude low frequency anomalies on the total field magnetic maps.  

• Drill Road Group – fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks. Good exposures are found in the 

southern part of the cleared area around the microwave tower and long the drill road immediately 

to the south. Biotite-feldspar schists occur in the northern area of the Bel-Air property. The group 

consists primarily of fine-grained felsic to intermediate sediments with gradational contacts. The 

group has flat magnetics when magnetite is absent and low amplitude, high frequency magnetic 

anomalies in the magnetite-bearing biotite schist.  

• Cigar Lake Group – coarse-grained clastic sedimentary rocks. A horizon of intermediate 

conglomerates and sandstones with intermittent occurrences of graphitic mudstone along the 

north and south contacts. This horizon is best exposed along the railway tracks on the north side 

of Cigar Lake.  

• West Bel-Air Group – quartz-bearing coarse-grained clastic sedimentary rocks. A variety of 

coarse-grained clastic rocks on outcrop on the western half of the claims. Horizons of garnet-

bearing biotite-feldspar schists similar to those described with the Drill Road Group may mark 

contacts between the units.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

• Foliated Felsic Intrusive Rocks – feldspar or quartz-feldspar porphyritic rocks and occur as 

swarms of narrow dykes, as thick dykes or as crudely oval pods.  

• Foliated Mafic Intrusive Rocks – diorite. Well-foliated biotitic intermediate dykes up to 50 cm 

wide intrude the fine-grained sediments. The best exposure of the dykes is on the Highway 

outcrop on Bel-Air property, where at least two generations of the dykes can be inferred from 

cross-cutting relationships.  

• Gneissic Felsic Intrusive Rocks – granodiorite. This unit occurs on the eastern extent of the 

southern Bel-Air claim line, along the northern margin of the Pukaskwa gneissic complex.  

• Unfoliated Felsic Intrusive Rocks – granodiorite. This unit occurs on the western part of the Bel-

Air claims and marks the eastern extent of the Heron Bay Pluton.  

•  Unfoliated Mafic Intrusive Rocks – gabbro which occurs just south of the Bel-Air baseline and 

diabase dykes. The diabase dykes trend northwest to north-northeast and dip steeply. Euhedral 

magnetite is common and the dykes are easily identified on magnetometer survey maps. 

Two types of alteration occur on the property: feldspathization and sericitization. Feldspathized pillow 

mafic volcanic rocks occur along the south side of Highway 17 on the Bel-Air property. No Au gold 

assays above trace were encountered and the base metal values are not significant. Sericite-pyrite-

pyrrhotite alteration is exposed in several outcrops stripped along the Lecours zone at the southern contact 

of the Cigar Lake Group, near the Bel-Air baseline. Historical high grade Au assays from the Lecours 

zone could not be reproduced by a second lab.  

The geology of the Bel-Air property suggests that the initial stratigraphy of mafic volcanic rocks was 

overlain by fine- and coarse-grained sedimentary rocks which has been repeated by shallowly-plunging 

isoclinal F1 folds against the nothern margin of the Pukaskwa gneissic complex, and then folded to 

conform with the margins of the Heron Bay Pluton.

electromagnetics, magnetics, and VLF-EM. A total of 365 line-km were flown at 100m line spacing 

totaling 36.5km2. The line direction was 000o/180o. The mean terrain clearance was 60m. 

The purpose of the survey was to reveal cross-cutting structures in the magnetics and potentially 

stratigraphically controlled shear or deformation zones (MNDMF 42D09E0095, 1989). Conductive 

anomalies were also chosen for discussion and follow-up.  

The Aerodat electromagnetic system comprised a four frequency system. Two vertical coaxial coil pairs 

operated at 935 Hz and 4600 Hz and two horizontal coplanar coil pairs at 4175 Hz and 33 kHz, with a 

transmitter-receiver separation of 7 metres. Inphase and quadrature signals were measured for the four 

frequencies with a time constant of 0.1 seconds. The electromagnetic bird was towed 30 metres below the 

helicopter with a mean terrain clearance of 30m. 

The VLF-EM system was a Herz Totem 2A. This instrument measures the total field and quadrature 

components of two selected transmitters, preferably orthogonal signals. This sensor was towed 15m 

below the helicopter with a mean terrain clearance of 45m. The transmitters monitored were NAA, Cutler, 

Maine broadcasting at 24.0 kHz for the Line Station and NLK, Jim Creek, Washington and NSS, 

Annapolis, Maryland broadcasting at 24.8 kHz and 21.4 kHz respectively for the Orthogonal Station.  

The magnetometer consisted of a Scintrex Model VIW-2321 H8 cesium vapour, optically pumped 

magnetometer. The instrument sensitivity was 0.1 nanoTeslas (nT) and sampled at a 0.2 second sampling 

rate. This sensor was towed 15m below the helicopter with a mean terrain clearance of 45m. 

The flight path was derived from the Mini-Ranger radar positioning navigation system. The flight path is 

generally accurate to about 10 metres with respect to the topographic detail of the base map. 

Magnetic Interpretation 

The magnetic data was found to correlate reasonably well with mapped mafic metavolcanics. The 

magnetic trending in the survey is believed to be related to the amphibolites facies within the wide 

metavolcanic package or rocks (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09E0095). It is noted that given this newly 

acquired dataset, an updated geological synopsis of the area would be produced. 

The area south of Little Black River had been mapped as a bow-shaped combined mafic metavolcanic and 

intermediate to felsic metavolcanic rocks. The magnetic data indicates this feature has much more strike 

extent both to the west and to the east and likely joins with the "main" metavolcanic belt to the north of 

Highway 17.

A note is also made of the correlation between the higher magnetic intensities and higher terrain. It is 

suggested that a certain reisistance level to weathering is associated with these rock types.  

The Heron Bay Pluton is noted to be reasonably well outlined in the area of lower magnetic intensity. 

Diabase dykes are the prominent features noted within this area. The Pukaskwa Gneissic Complex, in the 

southeast corner of the block, is noted to have somewhat higher magnetic intensity compared to the Heron 

Bay Pluton. It likely contains a higher level of fine grained magnetite within the granodiorite. 

The mapped metasediments in the northwest corner of the block are noted to generally consist of 

magnetic lows. These are also noted to be in areas of generally higher terrain. 

Numerous diabase dykes are noted throughout the survey block, striking northwest or northeast.  

The interpreter does not recognize any zones of deformation or alteration in the airborne magnetic. No 

structural relationships between the metavolcanics and Heron Bay Pluton or within the metavolcanics 

themselves are noted.  

The computed vertical magnetic gradient is noted to show coincidence between the zero contour interval 

and geological contacts and can be compared to a pseudo-geological map for the region. It is particularly 

noted that the outline of the amphibolite facies has been identified on the vertical magnetic gradient.  

A few fault zones have been identified on the interpretation of the magnetic data. Most are cross-cutting 

faults but some are possibly splay-type zones resulting from stronger deformation zones. It is suggested 

that an area east of Rous Lake, where metasediments have been indicated, that a deformation zone likely 

exists. The diabase dykes are also believed to be fault controlled, and may have had an effect on the 

displacement of the metavolcanic belt.  

Electromagnetic Data Interpretation 

Electromagnetic anomalies were picked off the analog traces of low and high frequency coaxial responses 

and validated on coplanar profile data. Each conductor or group of conductors was evaluated on the basis 

of magnetic (and lithologic, where applicable) correlations apparent on the analog data and man-made or 

surficial features not obvious on the analog charts. 

In general, the overlying Quaternary till was noted to be extremely conductive, as a result of the 

glaciolacustrine deposit content which ranges in texture from silt and clay varves to massive and 

laminated fine sands. The clay sequences cause the high conductivity values. Areas of resistive zones are

thought to contain widespread outcrop and very little overlying till. It is also noted that Rous Lake and 

Cache Lake exhibit highly conductive signatures, likely due to lake-bottom sediments. 

Overall, four conductive zones have been outlined: RL1-4. Zone RL1 towards the northwest corner of the 

survey block contains several individual conductors (labelled A-G) and are located in mafic to 

intermediate and felsic metavolcanics. The eastern extent of Conductor A and all of Conductor B display 

strong electromagnetic response and correlate with high intensity magnetic features interpreted as 

amphibolites. This response is interpreted as sulphides as opposed to graphite and is recommended for 

follow-up. Conductors C and F are both located on or very close to the amphibolite contact.  

Zones RL2 and RL3 are suspected to be caused by cultural effects given their subtle EM response on the 

low frequency coaxial traces. These zones lie within mapped granodiorite. Zone RL4 is situated in the 

Northeast shore of Cache Lake, just east to the village of Hemlo and is also suspected to be related to 

cultural effects. The anomaly is noted to be different from a lake-bottom sediment response and is 

recommended for follow-up. 

The Apparent Resistivity maps clearly outline the highly conductive Quaternary sediments. No 

correlation can be made been with the apparent resistivity and the magnetic total field, indicating that the 

apparent resistivity does not reflect the basement rocks whatsoever. 

VLF-EM Interpretation 

The VLF-EM showed reasonable correlation with the Apparent Resistivity data, with sensitivity to creek 

and river bottom silts as well as conductive Quaternary tills and cultural effects. A VLF anomaly is noted 

in coincidence with Conductors A, B and C in Zone RL1 but lacks the resolution found in the 

Electromagnetic dataset.  

6.1.26 1991, Homestake Canada Inc. acquisition 

Homestake Canada Inc. ("Homestake") acquired the property when Homestake Mining Co. merged with 

Corona Gold Corporation in 1991 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2001). Corona had acquired the 

claims by absorbing/merging the group of junior mining companies that had originally staked the 

property in the early 1980's (Figure 6-6).

6.1.27 1993, Homestake Mining Company/Youngman, Triple Crown, Corona and Laco 

properties 

Geophysics – Ground Magnetic and VLF-EM Survey 

In 1993, Homestake Mining contracted Rayan Exploration Ltd. to conduct a ground geophysical program 

consisting of line-cutting, magnetometer survey and a VLF-EM survey. Two main surveys were 

conducted, the first covering the historic Youngman block in August 1993, reported in MNDMF 

assessment file: 42D09NE8800. The second survey block conducted in August/September 1993 covered 

historic Triple Crown, Corona and Laco blocks, as reported in MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE8801. 

Youngman Claim Block Survey 

This ground geophysics survey was conducted during August 1993 on a block of 25 contiguous, 

unpatented mining claims in Lecours Township (Youngman block). A total of 50.6 line-km were cut and 

surveyed with total field magnetics and VLF-EM survey at 100 m line spacing. The sample spacing was 

12.5 m with picket placement every 25 m. Tie lines were established at 800N and 800S at the north and 

south limits of the block of the local grid. A baseline was turned off at L25E/0+00. Although an azimuth 

of 270o was chosen for this baseline, a strong local magnetic anomaly just north of the turnoff point 

influenced the baseline to an azimuth of 266o. However, it is also noted that this magnetic anomaly also 

influenced the original staking direction and thus similar deviation is found in the claim block boundary 

as the grid.  

A 115,000 volt Ontario Hydro power transmission line is noted to crosscut east-west through the central 

portion of this survey block.  

Ground Magnetic Survey and Results 

An EDA Omni Plus Proton Precession magnetometer was used to carry out the survey and is estimated to 

have an accuracy of less than 10nT.  

In general the magnetic survey outlined distinct east-west striking geological units from north to south. 

The north parts of the property are characterized by a uniform and generally lower magnetic 

susceptibility. Geological contacts are noted by distinct changes in magnetic susceptibility at 100N and 

500S, local grid, and correlate well with geological compilations of the area. The northern units are said

to be Felsic Volcanics, the central units are Mafic Volcanics and southern unit is the Heron Bay 

Granodiorite Felsic Intrusive pluton.  

It is noted that although several diabase dykes are mapped in the geological compilation, this particular 

survey does not display them well due to the natural EW trend of contours and high magnetic 

susceptibility of the mafic volcanics. One NW trending dyke can be seen in the southwest corner of the 

survey area. A NS dyke is noted as well. 

VLF-EM Survey and Results 

An EDA Omni Plus instrument was used to survey the Youngman claim block. Both Inphase and 

Quadrature values were recorded at 12.5m intervals. The station NLK in Seattle Washington was used 

with 24.8 khz and an azimuth of approximately 260o from the property.  

The VLF survey outlined several conductive zones. Some are associated with culture such as the power 

transmission lines, and some are likely to have bedrock causative sources. Some are also likely caused by 

current channelling at the outcrop/clay interfaces, especially in the northern part of the property.  

A total of twenty conductive anomalies were chosen and labelled A-S. Greatest priority was given to 

conductors A, G, K, E, C and H given that they are likely caused by bedrock sources. They are 

summarised as follows: 

Conductor A: Located at L2E/12N to L21E/40N with potential parallel conductor on L19E/37N 

to L21E/12S. This conductor displays moderate to strong conductivity and is believed to be a 

legitimate bedrock conductor. It lies in the contact between the Felsic Volcanic unit to the north 

and the Mafic Volcanic unit to the south. 

Conductor G: Located at L14E/62S to L16E/75S, this anomaly has a coincident magnetic high 

and lies within the Mafic Volcanic unit. The resolution of this conductive anomaly is diminished 

due to the presence of the power line 100m to the south.  

Conductor K: Located at 13E/575S to L15E/L565S with potential extension to L17E/537S. This 

anomaly displays strong conductivity and the quadrature response suggests a bedrock source. The 

anomaly is located entirely within the Granodiorite Intrusive.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

Conductor E: Located at L7E/475S to L11E/375S. This anomaly displays moderate conductivity 

but contains no magnetic correlation. It is on or slightly north of the contact between the mafic 

volcanic unit to the north and the Granodiorite Intrusive unit to the south.  

Conductor C: Located at L0/45S to L8E/275S. This anomaly has no magnetic correlation but 

appears to be coincident with a quartz feldspar porphyry shown on the Geodigital Compilation 

map. 

Conductor H: Located at L17E/300S to L21E/400S. This is a weak conductor with a coincident 

magnetic low. It may be correlated to anomaly J to the east but is interrupted by a NNE dyke on 

L22E. This conductor may be coincident with a unit of greywacke sediments, adjacent to the 

Granodiorite to the south, however the geology in general is noted to be quite complex in this 

area.  

These anomalies were recommended for ground examination and if covered by overburden, are 

recommended to be surveyed with Induced Polarization.  

It is noted that Conductor B is likely caused by the power transmission line.  

Triple Crown, Corona, Laco Claim Block Survey 

A ground geophysics survey was conducted during August-September 1993 on a block of 109 

contiguous, unpatented mining claims in Lecours Township and Rous Lake Area (Triple Crown, Corona 

and Laco blocks). A total of 200 line-km were cut and surveyed with total field magnetics and VLF-EM 

survey at 100m line spacing. The sample spacing was 12.5 m with picket placement every 25 m. Tie lines 

were established at 800N and 1200N, local grid. A baseline was turned off at L25E/0+00 with an azimuth 

of 270o.   

Ground Magnetic Survey and Results 

An EDA Omni Plus Proton Precession magnetometer was used to carry out the survey and is estimated to 

have an accuracy of less than 10nT.  

The survey area showed results of relatively uniform magnetic susceptibility with the exception of several 

NW trending magnetic highs. These are thought to be caused by diabase dykes. It is reported that various 

geological and structural features may terminate some of the VLF conductors and magnetic features, but 

these are not discussed in the report.

VLF-EM Survey and Results 

An EDA Omni Plus instrument was used to survey the claim block. Both Inphase and Quadrature values 

were recorded at 12.5m intervals. The station NAA in Cutler, Maine was used with 24.0 khz operating 

frequency and an azimuth of approximately 130o from the property.  

The VLF survey outlined several conductive zones, some of which are continuous across a large part of 

the grid. Seventeen are VLF conductors alone with no magnetic association and the author cautions the 

interpretation of these anomalies.  

A total of 37 conductive anomalies were chosen, labelled A-LL, noting an absence of anomaly 'CC'. 

Anomalies EE, II, JJ, KK and LL are all likely caused by cultural sources such as power transmission 

lines or Highway 17W. The author of the assessment file notes that many appear to have legitimate 

bedrock source, but none are highlighted to be of specific priority for follow-up. The author of the 

assessment file recommends ground examination of these anomalies and surveying with Induced 

Polarisation.  

6.1.28 1994, Homestake Canada Inc./ Bel-Air property 

Geophysics – Ground Magnetic and VLF-EM Survey 

In 1994, Homestake Mining contracted Rayan Exploration Ltd. to conduct a ground geophysical program 

consisting of line-cutting, magnetometer survey and a VLF-EM survey. This survey covered the Bel-Air 

and Toothpick properties and was completed in September 1994. Results can be found in MNDMF 

assessment file: 42D09NE0096.  

This ground geophysics survey covered 40 contiguous, unpatented mining claims in Pic and Lecours 

Townships. A total of 66 line-km were cut and surveyed with total field magnetics and VLF-EM at 100 m 

line spacing. The sample spacing was 12.5m with picket placement every 25 m. 

The ground magnetic survey was carried out using an EDA Omni Plus Proton Precession magnetometer. 

It is reported to have an accuracy of less than 10nT.  

The VLF-EM survey was carried out using an EDA Omni Plus instrument. Both In-phase and Quadrature 

values were recorded at 12.5 m intervals. The station NAA in Cutler, Maine was used with 24.0 khz 

operating frequency and an azimuth of approximately 130o from the property.

Bel-Air Results 

A total of 3.4 line-km were surveyed on the Bel-Air property, with an EW Baseline and NS cross lines. 

The ground magnetic data show the property to have a fairly uniform magnetic susceptibility, with the 

exception of several areas of up to 400nT above background values. No geological features are mentioned 

to explain these departures. 

Six conductive anomalies labelled A-F were chosen and are reported to be weak to moderate conductors. 

The author of the assessment file notes difficulty in determining if any have a legitimate bedrock 

causative source. The author of the assessment file recommends conducting an Induced Polarisation 

survey on the VLF conductors identified in this survey. 

6.1.29 1994, Homestake Canada Inc./Youngman property 

In 1986, Gold Fields completed 4 drill holes on the Youngman property and then the claims reverted back 

to International Corona Corporation. This was followed by a Homestake-Corona merger and now the 

claims are owned 100% by Homestake Canada Inc. ("Homestake"). The claim group for this assessment 

file (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0004) consists of 25 contiguous, unpatented mining claims 

which are 100% owned by Homestake. This assessment file refers to work on the property previously 

known as Youngman. 

Gold Fields 1984 to 1986 detailed mapping and diamond drilling indicates that the property is underlain 

by amphibolitized basalt flows and tuffs with intercalated siliceous wackes and minor sericitic felsic tuffs 

to the south of the power line, while felsic pyroclastic rocks with intercalated wackes and argillites 

predominate to the north. The mafic-felsic contact is well defined by the digital magnetic survey 

performed by Rayan Exploration Ltd. in 1993. Imaging indicates that the contact strikes approximately E-

W on the eastern portion of the property and swings around to the southwest towards the west. The VLF 

survey was useful for defining geological contacts.  

Lithogeochemistry 

A total of 122 rock samples (101 drill core and 21 surface outcrop samples) were submitted to XRAL 

Laboratories for whole rock chemical analyses (major oxides and trace elements including Au, Mo, Y and 

Zr). The drill core samples were from drill holes Y84-1, 2 and 3 because these holes sampled through the 

stratigraphic section ranging compositionally from mafic in the south to more felsic in the north. These 

rocks were also intruded by several phases of felsic to intermediate dykes and sills. This sampling

program is part of a larger program by Homestake for sampling of rock outcrops from the Hemlo area, 

drill core and underground samples from the Williams and David Bell mines. The goal is to use the 

geochemical data to produce a 3D model to determine the geochemical signatures associated with the 

Hemlo gold mineralization to be used to vector in on other similar mineralization on Homestake's other 

Hemlo properties.  

The metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks are all subalkalic and the intermediate to felsic 

metavolcanic rocks and sediments are calc-alkalic and generally plot within the intermediate to felsic 

metavolcanic trend on the Jensen cation plot, ranging from calc-alkalic rhyolite to andesite. The felsic to 

intermediate intrusive rocks also plot in the subalkalic group and are predominately calc-alkalic felsics. 

The felsic intrusive rocks plot in the granodiorite to trondhjemite field. No obvious geochemical 

variations or relationships are evident from the sections of the mineralized core, but this may be due to the 

small sample size.  

Additional lithogeochemical sampling is recommended for drill core and outcrops on the property in 

order to define any useful geochemical vectors to assist in defining potential drill targets.  

6.1.30 1995-1996, Homestake Canada Inc./Rous Lake property 

The Rous Lake property is wholly owned by Homestake and consists of 148 contiguous, unpatented, 

mining claims comprising 175 claim units (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2001). Homestake's 

claim numbers are listed in Table 6-7 and they correspond very closely with Entourage's current Rous 

Bomby property, except that Homestake treated the Bel Air property as a separate claim block for 

exploration.

Between November 21st 1995 and March 18th 1996, Quantec IP Inc (QIP) was contracted to conduct an 

Induced Polarisation/Resistivity "Realsection" survey at the Rous Lake Property for Homestake Canada 

Inc. The term 'RealSection' refers to a follow-up IP technique marketed by Quantec IP in the 1990s. Using 

gradient IP surveying, this technique utilised known type curves of conductive responses to estimate 

depth and shape of conductive sources. The information behind the "RealSection" technique was 

considered proprietary and not made publicly available. This survey covered the historic Triple Crown, 

Corona and Youngman blocks in the Cotte and Lecours Townships. This survey is reported in MNDMF 

assessment file 42D09NE0062. 

The "Realsection" survey design employs multiple gradient arrays with variable depths of investigation 

determined by successive changes in array size and geometry. The exploration objectives were to target 

and delineate zones of potential sulphide mineralization with the following criteria: 

• 10 - 20 m in width 
• 1.5 - 2 km in strike length 
• 3% - 5% or higher in sulphide content 

The survey was conducted with an IPG time domain induced polarisation/resistivity receiver and an IPT-

2B variable frequency transmitter. Forty-seven (47) lines oriented at 000o and spaced 100 m and 200 m 

were surveyed, with lengths varying between 450 m and 3250 m. The station interval was 25 m. A total 

of 93.7 line-km (potential-to-potential coverage) of reconnaissance gradient array IP/Resistivity were 

conducted over the area, of which 2.275 line-km was overlap coverage. An additional 35.6 line-km of 

"Realsection" detail follow-up were acquired. The survey results were displayed in plan view and vertical 

section view. Both primary and secondary voltage decay (chargeability) were acquired in the time-

domain, using a square waveform transmitted at a frequency of 0.0625 Hz at 50% duty cycle (4 seconds 

ON, 4 seconds OFF). 

Apparent chargeability values ranged from -10 to 40 mV/V. The background generally ranged from 2 to 9 

mV/V. The apparent resistivity values ranged from 100 to 25,000 Ω-m.  

Lineations in both the chargeability and resistivity generally follow ENE trends, reflecting the 

stratigraphy. Potential faults interpreted from the geophysics follow NNE and NW trends.  

A large zone of moderate to high chargeability, located in the north central region of the grid represents 

the strongest most significant anomalous zone detected (Figure 6-7). Minimal overburden cover exists in 

this region and is mapped as sedimentary lithology. Three strong anomalies A3, A4, A5a located within

this high chargeability zone were covered with the detailed "RealSection" technique. In addition, 

anomalies A1, A2, B1 and D1a are zones of moderate to high chargeability with potential sulphide 

enrichment. Anomaly C4 is a weak to moderate chargeability trend related to locally reduced resistivity, 

possibly due to target depth. Anomaly D3 is also identified as a potentially deep target and may represent 

a continuation of D1a. Strong chargeability responses are noted in the south over mafic metavolcanics 

bounding the Heron Bay Pluton.  

The author of the geophysics report recommends ground examination of anomalies A1, B1 and D1a as 

overburden in this area is noted to be minimal. Further "Realsection" follow-up is recommended on 

targets A1, B1, D1a due to poor ground access at the time of surveying as well as following up the strong 

chargeability anomalies C2, C3 and C4 with a "Realsection" survey.

Homestake completed geological mapping (1:5,000 scale) and lithogeochemical sampling on the Rous 

Lake property during the spring, summer and fall of 1996 (MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE2006).  

Mapping commenced on May 28, 1996 and was completed on October 23, 1996.  

The property geology map that resulted from this mapping program will be described in the property 

geology section of this report (see section 7.2.1 and Figure 7-3).  

A total of 520 samples were taken during this mapping program with 379 sent to XRAL Laboratories for 

whole rock and trace element analysis and the remaining 141 sent for Au, Ag, As, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, 

Sb, Mo and Bi. Geochemically anomalous gold analyses were defined as > 20 ppb Au. The sampling 

program identified the "Rous Lake Deformation Zone" (RLDZ) as a zone containing geochemically 

anomalous gold. The interpretation of the sampling program will be discussed in the mineralization 

section of this report (see section 9.0).  

Detailed lithogeochemical sampling was completed in the northern portion of the property over anomalies 

outlined by a gradient/'RealSection' IP survey completed in early 1996. These zones of high chargeability 

and resistivity generally correspond with pelitic units commonly containing 1 to 3% disseminated pyrite 

and pyrrhotite. No significant analytical results were obtained from any sampling completed within the 

northern portion of the property.  

Homestake concluded that the results of the mapping and sampling programs in combination with the 

geophysical and historical drill data indicate that the RLDZ has the best potential for economic gold 

mineralization on the property. The entire strike length of the RLDZ is an attractive drill target, especially 

in the eastern exposed portion where sampling yielded values ranging from 238 to 1030 ppb Au. Other 

areas of potential economic gold mineralization are the interpreted, sheared contacts between the Black 

River, Camp Lake and Unsubdivided Composite groups adjacent to the Black River.  

Drilling – Corona property 

Homestake completed 6 diamond drill holes totaling 2,442 m of NQ size core using helicopter support 

between October 12 and November 29, 1996 (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2001) (Table 6-8). The 

drill program was designed to test a series of Quantec gradient\'Real Section' IP anomalies occurring 

within the northern portion of the property. This IP survey was completed over the eastern and northern 

portions of the Rous Lake property during late 1995 and early 1996.

A total of 1734 drill core samples were taken and submitted to XRAL Laboratories for analysis. All 

samples were analyzed for Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu, As, Te, Sb, Mo and W. Also, 182 samples were analyzed 

for whole rock and incompatible trace elements. No significant Au grades were detected, however 

geochemically anomalous gold was detected locally. The best assay was for drill hole RL96-06, from 

380.0 to 380.4 m with a length of 0.4 m and 96 ppb Au for a kyanite-staurolite-garnet-bearing schist. This 

sample is possibly a reworked intermediate fragmental rock mixed with pelite.

6.1.31 1997, Homestake Canada Inc. /Rous Lake property 

Drilling 

Homestead Canada Inc. conducted a drill program on the Rous Lake property (Table 6-9) from February 

through June of 1997 (MNDMF Assessment file 42D09NE2009).  The diamond drill program was 

designed to test the length of the recently recognized geochemically auriferous, Rous Lake Deformation 

Zone and to evaluate an interpreted, low-grade gold zone contained within the RLDZ.  The zone was 

initially intersected by Gold Fields drilling in 1985.  Drilling commenced on February 13, 1997, however, 

after completing two holes and abandoning five attempts at two others drilling was suspended in order to 

complete a refraction seismic survey.  The goal of the survey was to more accurately determine 

overburden depths within the Black River Basin and help determine better drill hole placement and 

minimize the amount of overburden to be penetrated. 

Drilling recommenced on May 23rd on a hole planned using seismic interpreted overburden depths.  This 

hole was also abandoned and the decision was made to drill a follow up to the first hole of the program in 

an area of minimal overburden. Drill hole RL97-06 was drilled to test the low-grade mineralization

intersected in drill hole RL97-01. The program ended on June 27, 1997 after completing three holes and 

abandoning six others for a total of 2513 m. 

A total of 1477 core samples were taken and submitted to XRAL Laboratories, Don Mills, Ontario, and 

analyzed for Au, Ag, Pb, Zn, Cu, As, Te, Sb, Mo, and W.  Whole rock and incompatible trace elements 

analyses were completed on 159 of the samples.  Anomalous (>250 ppb) results from the assays are

6.1.32 1999, Homestake Canada Inc./ Teck Exploration Ltd.   

Geophysics – Gradient Realsection Time Domain Induced Polarisation (TDIP) Resistivity Survey 

Teck Exploration Ltd. contracted Quantec IP Inc. to conduct a Gradient Realsection Time Domain 

Induced Polarisation survey on the Rous Lake property in May 1999. The property was owned by 

Homestake at the time, so it is assumed that Teck had an option agreement with Homestake to explore on 

the property. This survey covered the historic Youngman, Autocrat, Rhodes and Laco blocks and is 

discussed in MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE2011. This survey extends the coverage of the survey 

conducted in 1996 to the south (see MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE0062). 

The survey was conducted with an Iris 6 time domain receiver and a Phoenix IPT-2 transmitter. Both 

primary and secondary voltage decay (chargeability) was acquired in the time-domain, using a square 

waveform transmitted at a frequency of 0.0625 Hz at 50% duty cycle (4 seconds ON, 4 seconds OFF). 

A total of 59 line-km were collected covering twenty-nine (29) 200m-spaced lines oriented N to NNW 

and a single line of detailed "Realsection" follow-up coverage along a central survey line for comparison 

purposes. Significant overburden cover is noted throughout the survey area.  

In general, the IP/Resistivity responses are marked by contrasting physical properties in the northern and 

southern halves of the survey area. The southern area features moderate to very strong chargeability 

signatures which also coincide with highly resistive rocks and generally high magnetism. These 

correspond to mafic volcanic units lying in intrusive contact with the Heron Bay batholith. Because mafic

volcanic units normally represent a low resistivity contrast, the author suggests that these have possibly 

been thermally altered/metamorphosed and are also either more pyritiferous or magnetite enriched. In 

contrast, the rocks further north are of moderate to low resistivity, weakly polarisable and weakly 

magnetic. The author notes that these are consistent with relatively unmetamorphosed mafic to 

intermediate volcanic and metasediments, which are likely also more strongly eroded as a result, 

explaining the deeper overburden cover.  

Both the total chargeability and apparent resistivity plan maps emphasize grid EW to ENE trends 

consistent with the regional geological strike. Overprinting these trends are broader zones of high/low 

bulk chargeability and resistivity. The author interprets these responses as porphyry-like zones of 

pervasive clay to quartz alteration and pyritization, particularly across the central survey area as well as 

contact metamorphic-like responses along the southern survey boundary suggesting abundant magnetite 

and non-magnetic sulphide-rich mineralization, which is correlated to the Heron Bay intrusive contact.  

IP Plan Results 

The measured chargeabilities varied between <1 to 77 mV/V, with an average of 7mV/V. The strongest 

anomalies are noted to be due to cultural effects such as power transmission lines. The author identifies 

the south-central and south-eastern portions of the survey as showing areas of strong bulk chargeabilities 

consistent with important concentrations of sulphides (>10-20%) and possibly stringer sulphides, 

particularly when having low resistivity association. With magnetic association, the author states that 

these strong IP zones likely represent pyrrhotite or magnetite mineralization, particularly in the mafic-

ultramafic volcanic unit along the northern rim of the Heron Bay Pluton. However, the author notes that 

the overall moderate chargeability average of 7mV/V reflects largely disseminate sulphides in the +5% 

range when subcropping. The magnetic interpretation of the area estimates that the overburden depth 

ranges from 5-140m in this area. The IP anomalies identified are shown to be strike extensive (400m-

3000m) as they are correlated from line-to-line. They also display variable strikes from concordant ENE, 

near-discordant EW, to discordant ESE. The author interprets these responses to represent concordant to 

discordant mineralized zones 

Resistivity Plan Results 

The apparent resistivity values vary widely from 76 Ω–m to 115 000 Ω-m, however, as with the 

chargeabilities, the highest values are related to power transmission lines. Away from cultural sources, the 

values range from 100 – 63 000 Ω-m with a 3 000 Ω-m average. The author states that this is consistent 

with the felsic volcanic unit overlain by thin or resistive overburden. The lower-end range of resistivity

values indicate fault-fracturing with clay alteration and graben-like zones of deep overburden. However, 

the author notes that strongly polarisable stringers to possibly massive mineralization and/or magnetite 

are possibly present. The values at the high end of the resistivity range are interpreted to be consistent 

with outcropping to shallow buried, felsic/silica rich rocks and possibly also Si-K-Ca altered shears, 

particularly along discordant zones. Current channelling effects are noted by strong resistivity contrasts 

and discordant/oblique strike orientations. Several broad strike extensive bands of alternating high and 

low resistivity are identified, possibly defining contrasting sedimentary, felsic and mafic volcanic units. 

EW to ESE discordant lineaments are also identified and are interpreted as altered shears. The author 

notes that in contrast with the chargeability data, the resistivity results provide more evidence for both 

EW to ESE discordant and ENE concordant structure and alteration in the survey block.  

Realsection Results 

The 'Realsection' vertical section results display lateral contrasts associated with subvertical zones 

representing narrow disseminate-mineralized horizons and areas of contrasting bulk porosity. The data 

required extensive filtering to remove the effects of the power transmission line and topographic current 

channelling. This filtering process has also eliminated the geologic/geomorphologic layering from the 

Realsections, specifically the overburden cover, and resulting in erroneously shallow target depths, 

particularly in the resistivity.  

The author states that despite their weak amplitude, the chargeability features are well defined and can be 

traced throughout all Realsection levels suggesting that the IP anomalies identified in plan can also be 

considered reliable in spite of their weak contrast. Overall, the Realsection results are characterized by 

weakly contrasting chargeabilities (±1mV/V), consistent with weakly disseminate mineralized zones (2-

5%) with apparent subvertical to steep dips and generally thin widths. Most IP zones appear to be 

shallowly buried (<100m) and their consistent strength throughout all Realsection levels suggests that 

while these zones do not strengthen with depth they nevertheless feature good vertical continuity. 

Contrastingly, the resistivity features are comparatively wider and also display stronger contrasts yet also 

display shallow burial, subvertical to steep dips and good vertical continuity. The resistivity sections 

define 6-7 subvertical 200-500m wide bands of alternating high and low resistivity, interpreted to 

represent either contrasting felsic/mafic geologic units or variably altered shear zones. From these results, 

at least four prominent high resistivity horizons labelled C-F have been defined which also correlate with 

strike extensive ENE bands identified in plan. Each high resistivity band is formed by several (3-4) 

narrower (25-150m) closely spaced high resistivity zones either coinciding with or flanked by narrow 

chargeability responses. Based on the similarity to previous test surveys, the author interprets these to

potentially represent Hemlo-type shear zones and therefore represent prime targets for drilling. These 

zones are summarized below: 

Zone D: The northernmost zone, an ENE trend. A weakly polarisable, high resistivity zone. 

Chargeabilities fluctuate indicating varying overburden cover. Lies in contact with a broad, 

strike-extensive, weakly magnetic horizon previously interpreted to be a mafic volcanic unit. 

Consists of at least 2-3 narrow (25-50m wide) subvertical high resistivity zones that are 

associated with weak IP linear features. This target is rated as second priority for Si-K-Ca altered, 

shear hosted mineralisation.  

Zone C: Consists of a broad (300-500m wide) ENE trending package of high resistivity and 

above average bulk chargeability, extending across the north central portion of the survey block 

in an area with extensive sand and silt cover. It corresponds to mapped intermediate volcanic tuffs 

south of Black River. Corresponds to a narrow, partially conductive, weak to moderate 

chargeability zone (C4). The western extent is more strongly polarisable and resistive as a result 

of shallower overburden cover and/or stronger silicification/pyritization. It also coincides with a 

broad NE trending magnetic low feature which suggests either pervasive alteration/magnetite 

depletion or a mineralized felsic volcanic. Further east it features stronger chargeabilities along its 

southern flank but is also accompanied by increased magnetism consistent with a mafic volcanic 

unit. Most IP zones associated with Zone C are preferentially oriented along discordant ESE 

trends, paralleling the key mineralization at Hemlo. The Realsection of shows 3-4 narrow to 

broad (25-100m wide) subvertical steeply dipping resistive units/zones, which are resolved from 

100m to below 500m depth. Accompanying the high resistivity zones are narrower subvertical to 

steeply dipping, weak chargeability high zones also extending 100m to 500m below surface. The 

author suggests that the broad increase in background chargeability surrounding Zone C to be a 

porphyry-like increase in bulk disseminate sulphides locally. A small coincident EW-elliptical 

magnetic high is interpreted to be a silicified intrusive. 

The above combination of results makes Zone C a high priority target for both shear-type quartz 

feldspar-carbonate altered mineralization, particularly along its northern flank and also porphyry-

like Hemlo-type mineralization along its southern contact.  

A secondary trend (Zone C') following ESE (parallel to strikes at Hemlo) displaying increased 

chargeabilities along strike are associated with moderate resistivity lineaments, is defined in the 

eastern grid area south of Black River making C' a favourable region for drill follow-up.

Zone E-E': Discontinuous, ENE trending, moderate to strongly polarisable, highly resistive. Lies 

south of major power line. Eastern portion (E) coincides with highly magnetic, mafic volcanic 

rocks north of the Heron Bay granodiorite contact. Their high resistivity and chargeability likely 

result from contact metamorphism and magnetite-enrichment as well as possible local quartz 

feldspar alteration and pyritization. Further west the bulk chargeability strengthens and the zone 

becomes ESE trending. A decrease in bulk resistivity contrast is seen. A secondary trend (Zone 

E') associated with weak chargeability and higher bulk resistivity is defined in the southwest 

corner of the survey. It accompanies a low bulk magnetism signature consistent with either a 

weakly mineralized felsic volcanic or a quartz-feldspar-carbonate alteration zone. In Realsection, 

this zone is shallow-buried, moderate width (150-200m) with high resistivity, pinching or faulting 

at 200m depth. It features weak, narrow (<25m) chargeability zones at its contacts which are 

similarly discontinuous and pinch at mid-depths. The zone is moderately magnetic and has high 

resistivity contrast making it a high priority target for Hemlo-type mineralization. Well defined 

resistivity contacts accompanying bulk chargeability highs along E-E' are also consistent with 

Hemlo-type signatures, as well as possible VMS-type conductive IP high noted along line 

(L28+00W/6+50S).  

Zone F: ENE trending band of moderate to strongly polarisable IP zones found along southern 

portion of survey block. Coincide with well-defined magnetic and resistivity contact. To the east, 

the contact marks the transition to more weakly magnetic, sulphide-poor and relatively porous 

Heron Bay granodioritic rocks; whereas in the centre and west the magnetic contact extends north 

of the mapped Heron Bay intrusive into mafic volcanic rocks which are visibly strongly quartz-

altered or contact-metamorphosed, heavily sulphide-mineralized and relatively non-magnetic. In 

Realsection, this zone lies south of a graben-like zone of low resistivity and chargeability either 

marking a deep overburden depression, or based on strong magnetic, possibly a barren, porous 

diabase or serpentinized ultramafic. Zone F coincides with a moderately magnetic and moderately 

polarisable high resistivity zone, which is poorly defined but possibly represents a contact 

metamorphic aureole within volcanic rocks adjacent to the Heron Bay Pluton, otherwise a 

possible quartz altered, disseminate mineralized zone. The bulk chargeability highs adjacent to 

the well defined resistivity contacts along the north and south flanks of Zone F represent good 

follow-up targets for contact-type Hemlo-style mineralization. In addition, a prominent strong 

conductive IP high also represents a viable massive sulphide target.

Zone G: A ENE trending moderate to strongly polarisable high resistivity zone similar to Zone F 

which lies in the southwest corner of the survey area. Underlain by mafic to intermediate volcanic 

units. Not detailed with Realsection coverage, but a favourable polarisable contact accompanying 

conductive IP signature merit additional follow-up for both Hemlo-type disseminate 

mineralization and also VMS-type sulphides. Ground examination for possible cultural 

interference is recommended.

6.1.35 Summary of historic exploration for Rous Bomby property 

The historic exploration programs on the Rous Bomby property is summarized below and the significant 

results for the historic exploration are given in Table 6-15, Table 6-16 and Table 6-17. 

1981-1983 exploration

Gold was discovered in the Hemlo area in 1981 and this lead to a staking rush and a lot of exploration 

work in the early 1980's. Entourage's current Rous Bomby property claim block was originally divided 

into 9 claim blocks by: Bel-Air, Rabbit, Youngman, Triple Crown, International Corona, Autocrat, 

International Rhodes, International Laco, and partially by Cannon. These companies completed 

geological compilation reports, reconnaissance geological mapping, line cutting, magnetometer, VLF EM 

surveys, soil sampling and reconnaissance IP surveys on their properties by the end of 1983.  

1984-1986 exploration 

In 1984, Westfield optioned property from Bel-Air and completed 4 diamond drill holes on the property. 

In 1984-1985, Gold Fields optioned properties from Youngman, Rabbit, Triple Crown, Triple Crown, 

Jack Criswell/Autocrat property, International Rhodes, International Laco and International Corona. Gold 

Fields completed geophysics surveys (magnetic and gravity), airborne orthophoto survey, geological 

mapping, lithogeochemistry sampling and 9 diamond drill holes. Tuscaloosa also had part of the 

Entourage's current Rous Bomby claim block. In 1984, Tuscaloosa completed an overburden drill 

program and a single diamond drill hole. Gold Fields drilled another hole on the Autocrat property in 

1986.  

1988-1989 exploration 

In 1988, Esso completed geological mapping on the Bel-Air property. In 1989, Dominion Explorers Inc. 

completed geophysics surveys (airborne magnetic, electromagnetic and VLF) on the Bel-Air property.  

1991 – 2001 exploration 

In 1991, Homestake acquired all of Entourage's current Rous Bomby claim block and divided it into two 

properties: Rous Lake and Bel-Air. In 1993, Homestake completed geophysics surveys (ground magnetics 

and VLF-EM) on the Rous Lake property. In 1994, Homestake completed geophysics surveys (ground 

magnetics and VLF-EM) on the Bel-Air property and lithogeochemistry sampling on the Youngman 

property.  

In 1996, Homestake completed Induced Polarisation (IP)/Resistivity "Realsection" geophysics survey on 

the Rous Lake property. In the same year, Homestake also completed geological mapping (1:5,000 scale) 

and lithogeochemical sampling on the Rous Lake property which resulted in a property geology map 

given in Figure 7-3. The sampling program identified the "Rous Lake Deformation Zone" (RLDZ) as a 

zone containing geochemically anomalous gold. In the same year, Homestake also completed 6 diamond

drill holes. The geological mapping, lithogeochemical sampling and drilling were designed to test IP 

anomalies identified earlier in the year.  

In 1997, Homestake conducted a drill program to test the Rous Lake Deformation Zone. Three holes were 

successfully drilled and 6 holes were abandoned due to depth of overburden. Refraction seismic survey 

was completed to determine the overburden depths in the Black River Basin and to aid in drill targeting.  

In 1999, Homestake/Teck conducted a Gradient Realsection Time Domain Induced Polarisation survey 

on the Rous Lake property. In late 1999 to early 2000, Teck conducted a drill program consisting of 4 

holes on the Rous Lake property for Homestake. The goal of the drill program was to test the Rous Lake 

Deformation Zone. In 2001, Teck drilled an additional 2 diamond drill holes on the Rous Lake property.

6.2 Toothpick East and West 

6.2.1 1983, Esso Resources Canada Ltd./Toothpick East and West  

Geophysics – Airborne Magnetic and VLF-EM Survey 

Aerodat Limited conducted a helicopter-towed airborne geophysical survey on behalf of Esso Minerals 

Canada in March 2 to June 14, 1983. This survey consisted of magnetics, electromagnetic and VLF-EM. 

A total of 15,770 line-km were flown at 100 m line spacing totalling 1570 km2.  

However, the assessment files related to this survey only address four claim blocks, and are very small 

subsets of this larger survey. The claim groups discussed are: Michano Option (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE0210), Moses Purchase (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0211), Heron Bay South 

(MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NW0110) and Heron Bay North (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NW0111). These assessment files only report on the magnetics and VLF-EM results.  

The line direction of this survey was 000o/180o, with mean terrain clearance was 60 m. The flight path 

was derived from the Mini-Ranger radar positioning navigation system. The flight path is generally 

accurate to about 30 metres with respect to the topographic detail of the base map. 

The magnetometer employed was a Geometrics G-803 proton precession type. The sensitivity is noted to 

be 1 gamma (1nT) with a 0.5 second sample rate. The sensor was towed 15 m below the helicopter with a 

mean terrain clearance of 45m. 

The VLF-EM System was a Herz 1A instrument. This unit measures the total field and vertical quadrature 

of the selected frequency. The stations NAA in Cutler, Maine (17.8 kHz) and NLK in Jim Creek, 

Washington (24.8 kHz) were used.   

A three-frequency electromagnetic system was also employed with two vertical coaxial coil pairs at 950 

and 4500 Hz and a horizontal coplanar coil pair at 4100 Hz. However, the results of this portion of the 

survey are not discussed in the MNDMF assessment files.  

Michano Option Claim Group  

Michano Option claim group is located adjacent and to the north of Toothpick East. This survey also 

overlapped the Toothpick East property.

A total of 15 line-km covers this claim group. This area is mapped as mafic metavolcanics of the Heron 

Bay Group.  

Two VLF-EM total field anomalies are noted in the southern half of the claim group. They trend EW and 

are associated with magnetic highs over outcropping mafic metavolcanics.  

The northern part of the claim group is noted to be covered by extensive overburden. The steep magnetic 

gradient in this area is likely caused by the change from highly magnetic mafic metavolcanics to a weak 

or non-magnetic source, postulated to be felsic metavolcanics.  

The report recommends ground follow-up to evaluate the VLF-EM conductors and magnetic features in 

this claim group. 

Moses Purchase Claim Group (currently known as Toothpick East) 

A total of 18 line-km covers this claim group. The area is mapped as intermediate to felsic metavolcanics 

of the Heron Bay group. 

A +30% VLF-EM total field anomaly is noted to strike ENE across the survey area and occurs at or near 

the contact with a mafic volcanic unit mapped to the north.  

A second VLF-EM anomaly is noted to trend NW through the west half of the claim group and is likely 

due to interference from a power transmission line.  

Overall, the claim group is in an area of high magnetic gradient associated with the mafic volcanic units 

to the north. In contrast, the intermediate to felsic metavolcanics appear to be weakly magnetic or non 

magnetic. The magnetic feature observed in the southeast is interpreted as a dyke and extends beyond the 

claim block. 

The author of the geophysics report in the assessment file recommends ground follow-up in exploration 

for sulphide mineralization at the contact between the intermediate and mafic metavolcanic units.  

Heron Bay (South) Claim Group (currently known as the southern part of Toothpick West) 

A total of 41 line-km covers this claim group. This area lies within mapped Intermediate to Felsic 

metavolcanics of the Heron Bay group.

Three large amplitude magnetic anomalies were identified in the southwest portion of the claim group and 

are mapped as a diabase dykes. It is noted that one dyke is reversely polarized striking NNW and the 

other two dykes strike NW. The reversely polarised dyke crosscuts the other two features, indicating that 

it is younger in age. All three dykes extend beyond the limits of the Heron Bay South claim block. The 

intermediate to felsic metavolcanics located in the northeast portion of the survey are noted to be weakly 

magnetic to non-magnetic. 

Three conductive anomalies are identified from the VLF-EM. All three are positive contour features 

striking NW. The westernmost anomaly is coincident with the negatively polarised diabase dyke. A 

parallel VLF-EM anomaly to the east of the negatively polarized dyke roughly follows a topographic high 

and is on strike with a lineament mapped further to the southwest. The source of the third VLF-EM 

anomaly further east is not known. The author of the geophysics report in the assessment file recommends 

following up these last two VLF-EM anomalies as they may have an association with faults or shear 

zones and hence may be potentially favourable environments for gold mineralization. 

Heron Bay (North) Claim Group (currently known as the northern part of Toothpick West) 

A total of 58 line-km covers this claim group. The area is mapped as intermediate to felsic metavolcanics 

of the Heron Bay group.  

Several diabase dykes are identified in the magnetic data. The strike direction is generally NNW over the 

eastern half of the claim group and NW over the western half. The most prominent magnetic feature is a 

reversely polarised dyke which is mapped on the north shore of Heron Bay. A second, negatively 

polarised dyke is identified on the southwest corner of the claim block.  

All VLF-EM anomalies identified are either interpreted as cultural interference from the C.P.R. rail line, 

lake-bottom sediments from the bays and harbours of Lake Superior or Luram Lake, or contacts between 

diabase dykes and intermediate volcanic units. As a result, the author of the geophysics report in the 

assessment file does not recommend further exploration in the area for gold mineralization.  

6.2.2 1984, Esso Resources Canada Ltd./Toothpick East  

Drilling 

Esso conducted a drill program in March of 1984 on the Toothpick East property. (Table 6-18) (MNDMF 

assessment file: 42D09NE0181).  The drill program consisted of two drill holes, 65-1 and 65-2, for a total 

of 336.5 m with core size of BQ.  Both hole collars have the same location but different dips.  A total of

34 samples were taken for Au assay, all from hole 65-1 and no samples were taken from hole 65-2.  

Samples were assayed for Au, As, Sb, and Mo.  There were several anomalous Au assays the best being 

sample 26 from hole 65-1.  It assayed 1300 ppb Au (=1.3 g/t Au) over 0.6 m from 197.8 m to 198.4 m, 

with 8.5 ppm As, 6.5 ppm Sb and, 280 ppm Mo (Table 6-12).  All assays with anomalous Au values also 

contained elevated As, Mo and sometimes Sb values compared to non-auriferous samples suggesting 

there may be a correlation between the elements.   

The drill holes coordinates in the drill hole logs are in local grid coordinates, not UTM or 

latitude/longitude coordinates.

6.2.3 1985, Esso Resources Canada Ltd./ Toothpick West 

Drilling 

Esso completed a nine hole drill program from March to May 1985 on the Toothpick West property 

(Table 6-20) (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NW0077).  Nine holes were drilled for a total of 1841 m 

with a core size of BQ.  The assessment file gives a table with the assay results for thirty-one samples for 

Au (ppb), Mo (ppm), Ba (ppm), Na2O%, K2O%, and SiO2% values, all from hole TW-002 (Table 6-21).  

There are several anomalous Au results the best being sample 95 from hole TW-002 which reported 960 

ppb Au, 98 ppm Mo, 140 ppm Ba, 4.87% Na2O, 0.26% K2O, and 49.5% SiO2 over a 0.4 m interval from 

195.4 m to 195.8 m.  The sample was taken within a shattered Rhyolite Breccia with quartz chlorite filled 

fractures and 1-5% pyrite.  There is also anomalous Ba and to a lesser extent anomalous Mo values 

associated with anomalous Au values suggesting a possible correlation between the elements.  Elevated 

SiO2 percentages also occur amongst the assays with anomalous Au values.

Esso Resources Canada conducted a drill program on the Toothpick property from September to October 

1986 (Table 6-22) (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0141).  The program consisted of two drill holes, 

86-TE-01 and 86-TW-06, for a total of 365.8 m with a core size of BQ.  The objective of hole 86-TE-01 

was to complete fence drilling with hole 84-TE-01 and the objective of hole 86-TW-06 was to drill down 

plunge of the "Screamer zone".  The drill logs indicate that a total of 21 samples were taken for assay, 7 

from hole 86-TE-01 and 14 from 86-TW-06, however no Au values are reported.

6.2.5 1994, Homestake Canada Inc./Toothpick East and West 

Homestake's claims and claim numbers for the Toothpick East and West in 1994 are identical to 

Entourage's current Toothpick East and West claims.  

Geophysics – Ground Magnetic and VLF-EM Survey 

In 1994, Homestake Mining contracted Rayan Exploration Ltd. to conduct a ground geophysical program 

consisting of line-cutting, magnetometer survey and a VLF-EM survey. This survey covered the Bel-Air 

and Toothpick properties and was completed in September 1994. Results can be found in MNDMF 

assessment file: 42D09NE0096. The equipment used for the survey is discussed in section 6.1.28. 

Toothpick East Results 

A total of 19.65 line-km were surveyed on the Toothpick East property. The Baseline azimuth was 065o 

with cross lines surveyed at 155o. 

Eleven conductive anomalies labelled A-K were identified. Several of these anomalies are considered to 

be bedrock conductors. These conductors are recommended for ground examination and Induced 

Polarisation survey. No comment is made on the ground magnetic survey results for this area.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

A total of 43.68 line-km were surveyed on the Toothpick West property. The Baseline azimuth was 065o 

with cross lines surveyed at 155o. 

Fourteen conductive anomalies labelled A-N were identified. Many are considered to have bedrock-type 

responses; however the author of the assessment file notes that some may be topography as the terrain is 

noted to be rugged with numerous bedrock ridges. The author of the assessment file also notes that 

structural features and/or geological contacts may also be the cause of some of the VLF conductors.  

Several NS and NW striking magnetic anomalies were also identified in this survey block. The author of 

the assessment file recommends conducted a detailed prospecting and mapping program to identify their 

causative sources. Induced Polarisation is also recommended to test all of the unexplained conductors and 

areas of geological interest.  

6.2.6 1996, Homestake Canada Inc./ Toothpick West 

Geophysics – Gradient Realsection Time Domain Induced Polarisation (TDIP) Resistivity Survey 

A gradient reconnaissance and detailed follow-up Realsection IP Resistivity survey were conducted by 

Quantec IP Ltd on behalf of Homestake Canada Inc.  in September 1996. Although reported separately 

for the client, both reports are found in MNDMF assessment file:  42D09NW0029. This survey was 

conducted in the northeastern section of the historic Toothpick West claim block.  

Reconnaissance Survey 

The survey objectives were to delineate potential zones of metallic mineralization at depths up to 400 m 

for drill testing. This survey covers the known NE trending potentially gold-bearing disseminated 

sulphide known as the Heron Bay Main Zone as well as other mineral occurrences.  

The survey consists of five lines oriented NNW at 1200 m and 100 m spacing. The survey was conducted 

with an Iris 6 time domain receiver and a Phoenix IPT-2 transmitter. Both primary and secondary voltage 

decay (chargeability) was acquired in the time-domain, using a square waveform transmitted at a 

frequency of 0.0625 Hz at 50% duty cycle. 

The survey successfully discriminated resistivity and chargeability signatures associated with possible 

lithologic or metamorphic boundaries/contacts, possible faults and structurally-controlled alteration 

zones, as well as identify exploration targets. Two zones of very high resistivity occur to the grid NW and 

SW and represent either outcropping discordant felsic volcanic units, or more likely are underlain by

intermediate to felsic intrusive or silicification. In the grid center, the rocks are low to moderately 

resistive, suggesting intermediate to mafic volcanic or meta-sedimentary rocks.  

Five zones of anomalous chargeability were selected. The southern part of the survey hosts three EW 

elliptical shaped moderate to strong anomalies representing chargeability contrasts 2x to 5x above 

background and are possibly associated with the targeted linear. The northern survey area features two, 

less-well defined anomalies, possibly associated with quartz-altered or felsic intrusive as suggested by 

their high resistivity association. All anomalies occur in the region of low to moderate bulk-resistivity 

which represents the mafic to intermediate host rocks. All anomalies have short strike lengths (<100-

200m EW). All are multiple anomalies, indicating closely spaced mineralized units, which suggests a 

stockwork-like character, similar to the target type. The author of the geophysical report notes that 

anomalies A and B represent the best candidates for testing along the Heron Lake trend. The author of the 

geophysical report also recommends extending the survey northward for better coverage and anomaly 

definition.  

Follow-up Survey 

The follow-up survey comprises of a detailed "Realsection" IP/Resistivity survey. The instrumentation 

was the same as the reconnaissance survey.  

This survey consisted of one line running along 0+00E from 2500S to 75N.  

Six high priority targets were identified with significant chargeability, width, and other favourable 

geoelectric characteristics. Eight to ten 2nd priority zones were also identified. The author of the 

geophysical report recommends ground examination, comparison with other geophysics (particularly 

magnetic) and drill testing.  

6.2.7 2000, Teck Exploration Ltd./Toothpick East 

Teck Exploration Ltd. conducted a drill program on the Toothpick East property (Table 6-23) from 

February 2000 through March 2000 (MNDMF Assessment files: 42D09NE2013 and 42D09NW2008).  

Three holes were drilled, including an abandoned hole, for a total of 1251 m using NQ core diameter. 

Hole TE00-01 was abandoned in overburden at 94 m. Hole TE00-01A was a second attempt at hole 

TE00-01. The holes were designed to test the deformation zone at the east and west end of the Toothpick 

East property.  One high grade and several anomalous Au assays were taken from the two completed 

holes (Table 6-24) including sample Z01894 from hole TE00-02 which is 0.3 m long, from 522.7 m to

6.2.8 2001, Teck Exploration Ltd./ Toothpick West  

Drilling 

Teck Exploration Ltd. conducted a drill program on the Toothpick West property (Table 6-25) from May 

to June 2001 and September to October 2001 (MNDMF assessment files: 42D09NW2012 and 

42D09NW2014).  Six holes were drilled for a total of 2867 m, however the assessment files are missing 

information for hole TW01-03 which would add more metres to this total.  All of the holes used NQ core 

diameter. Holes TW01-01 and TW01-02 were designed to test the down plunge extension of the 

"Porphyry Zone" and "C Zone". Holes TW-01-04 to TW01-05 were designed to test the up and down dip 

of porphyry mineralization intersected in TW01-01, respectively. Hole TW-01-06 was designed to test the 

down plunge of porphyry mineralization and down dip of moderate porphyry mineralization in TW01-02. 

Several mid to high grade Au assays were intersected (Table 6-26) the best of which was sample Z3980 in 

hole TW01-01, a one metre sample from 301.0 m to 302.0 m which ran 14.81 g/t Au. Another notable 

high grade sample from the same hole was sample Z3985 from 305.0 to 306.0 m which contained 8.47 g/t 

Au. Both samples (Z3980 and Z3985) were hosted by albitic porphyry with 2-3% pyrite.

Teck Exploration Ltd. conducted a drill program on the Toothpick West property during August of 2002 

(MNDMF Assessment files 42D09NW2016).  Three holes were drilled using NQ core diameter for a total 

of 1755 m (Table 6-27).  Hole TW02-01 was designed to test the down plunge extension of the "Porphyry 

Zone".  Hole TW02-02 and TW02-03 drilled the top of the Porphyry Zone to determine the plunge. 

Several mid to high grade Au assays were intersected (Table 6-28) the best of which was sample Z07414 

in hole TW02-01, a 0.4 m sample from 522.2 m to 522.6 m which ran 5.35 g/t Au. This sample (Z07414) 

was hosted by quartz-feldspar porphyry with 1-2 % pyrite.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Rous Bomby and Toothpick East and West Properties are located in the Hemlo greenstone belt of the 

Wawa subprovince of the Superior province of the Canadian Shield (Figure 7-1). The Wawa subprovince 

is a volcano-sedimentary-plutonic terrane bounded to the east by the Kapuskasing structural zone and to 

the north by the metasedimentary Quetico subprovince (Muir, 2003). The Hemlo greenstone belt consists 

of metasedimentary supracrustal rocks, felsic to intermediate calc-alkalic volcanic rocks, large granitic 

intrusions (~2690-2684 Ma and 2678 Ma) and rare komatiites (Muir, 2006). The belt is flanked by mafic 

volcanic rocks and bounded by metamorphic batholiths (2720 Ma). The greenstone belt is variably 

metamorphosed with lower grades in the west and medium grades in the east. 

 

Figure 7-1: Map showing the greenstone belts in the Wawa subprovince of the Superior province (from Muir 2003). 

 

Muir (1983) divided the volcanic rocks of the Hemlo greenstone belt into two groups, the Playter Harbour 

group and the Heron Bay group. The Playter Harbour group consists of tholeiitic basalts and minor 

intercalated felsic tuff and siltstone. Rare chert and amphibolite also occur in the Playter Harbour group 

as well as isolated bodies of pyroxenite and lherzolite. Locally graphitic mudstone with pyrrhotite, 

chalcopyrite and pyrite occur. The Heron Bay group consists of dacitic to rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks

(including tuffs and breccias) and calc-alkalic basalts. Northwest and east-northeast of Rous Lake, 

tholeiitic basalts occur.  

The Gowan Lake Pluton forms the northern boundary of the Hemlo greenstone belt and the Heron Bay 

Pluton and is located to the south of the greenstone belt. The southeastern part of the area is underlain by 

the Pukaskwa Gneissic Complex which consists of gneissic biotite-hornblende trondhjemite-granodiorite 

and pegmatite dikes (Muir, 1983). 

Structurally, Muir (2002) concluded that the area underwent six structural events (D1-D6). Small-scale 

folds and faults formed during D1. Regional, S-shaped folds formed during D2. D3 was transpressive and 

resulted in penetrative east to northeast striking foliation, Z-shaped folds and cataclasites and 

pseudotachilites. The D4 event was characterized by brittle fractures. D5 and D6 resulted in brittle and 

brittle-ductile faults. Four main deformation zones, all moderately steeply dipping to the north-northeast 

and north, were mapped in the area. The Hemlo fault zone, the Moose Lake fault zone, the Lake Superior 

fault zone and the Cedar Creek fault zone (Figure 7-2; Muir, 2003). The Hemlo fault zone, a regional-

scale fault, forms the boundary between amphibolite and sedimentary rocks. Phyllonites, originally mafic-

ultramafic dikes, are restricted to this fault. The Moose Lake fault zone occurs within sedimentary rocks 

in the vicinity of the Moose Lake volcanic complex. The Lake Superior shear zone consists of 

mylonitized rocks of the Moose Lake volcanic complex and overlying sedimentary rocks. The Cedar 

Creek fault zone appears to be a local fault zone in the area of the Hemlo gold deposit.

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

7.2.1 Rous Bomby 

The dominant rock types on the Rous Bomby Property are intermediate volcanic rocks 

(plagioclase±quartz-phyric tuff, lapilli tuff, plagioclase±quartz-phyric tuff breccia and pyroclastic 

breccia), metasedimentary rocks (wacke, lithic wacke, mudstone, minor conglomerate and schist) and 

mafic volcanic rocks (massive and pillowed flows) (Figure 7-3) (Ontario Geological Survey Map 2614 

and Homestake map in MNDMF assessment file 42D09NE2006). The southernmost part of the Property 

straddles the Heron Bay pluton in the west and the Pukaskwa Gneiss Complex in the east. The Heron Bay 

pluton consists of massive to foliated hornblende-biotite granodiorite and the Pukaswka Gneiss Complex 

consists of biotite-hornblende trondhjemite and granodiorite and minor pegmatite and aplite. Locally, 

remnants of felsic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (now recrystallized and partly assimilated). 

The contact of the complex with the metavolcanic rocks tends to be mylonitized.  

A major shear zone, the Lake Superior Fault Zone, runs through the Property. Some reports named this 

shear zone the Rous Lake Shear Zone (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2006).

7.2.2 Toothpick East and West 

The dominant rock types in the Toothpick Properties are intermediate volcanic rocks, in particular 

plagioclase±quartz-phyric tuff and lapilli tuff. In the northern part of Toothpick East, mafic volcanic 

rocks also occur (massive to pillowed flows with plagioclase phenocrysts (Muir, 1983; Figure 7-4). 

There is a change in the character of the volcanic rocks from west (Toothpick) to east (Rous Bomby): 

breccia fragments are significantly bigger in the west (up to 2 m diameter) whereas lapilli tuff is more 

common in the east. East of Rous Lake, metasedimentary rocks are more abundant than metavolcanic 

rocks. These facies changes indicate that a volcanic centre may have existed in the west from where the 

coarse fragments were sourced and that the lapilli tuffs in the east were the distal products of this 

volcanism. The metasedimentary rocks even further to the east are reworked breccias and tuffs.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPE 

8.1 Hemlo-type Deposits 

The eastern edge of the Rous-Bomby Property is located approximately 2.5 km west of the world class 

Hemlo gold deposit. The exploration model used for Entourage's exploration activities is that of the 

Hemlo deposit. Production at Hemlo to the end of 2009 has been ~68 Mt of ore at a grade of 6.32 g/t Au 

to a total of 13,347,898 ounces of Au (Scott et al., 2010). 

The Hemlo gold deposit (~2689-2684 Ma) is located in major high-strain zones, the Lake Superior shear 

zone and the Moose Lake fault zone. Hemlo is spatially associated with a restraining bend in the Hemlo 

greenstone belt. The deposit extends over a strike length of 2.5 km and plunges to the west. It is hosted by 

sedimentary (volcaniclastic and epiclastic) rocks (dominantly wacke and sandstone) and massive and 

fragmental, felsic volcanic rocks of the Moose Lake Volcanic Complex (Muir, 2002). 

The mineralization consists of submicroscopic (1-25 µm) gold along silicate grain boundaries, as 

inclusions in microcline and quartz and adjacent to pyrite and molybdenite; gold tellurides occur locally 

(Muir, 2002). Other opaque minerals include molybdenite (disseminated and along foliation planes and 

fractures), pyrite (2-15 %; disseminated or as laminae) and minor cinnabar and stibnite. Mineralization is 

mostly disseminated and to a lesser degree fracture-controlled and forms stockwork and tabular, 

subparallel bodies. Mercury, As, Sb, V and Ba are present in anomalous concentrations in the ore zone. 

The ore was remobilized during shearing and metamorphism. The "C-Zone" (Figure 8-1), located in the 

westernmost part of the deposit, exhibits slightly different characteristics in that quartz veins and visible 

gold are more abundant than in other parts of the deposit . 

The alteration associated with the deposit extends over an area of 400 m × 4 km (Muir, 2002). Two types 

of alteration are characteristic: (1) pervasive alteration (2) fracture-controlled alteration. The pervasive 

alteration is dominantly potassic, consisting of microcline, biotite and muscovite, and local sodic 

alteration, silicification and minor carbonate and hematite alteration. The fracture-controlled alteration 

overprints the pervasive alteration; it can be subdivided into four categories: (1) feldspathic, (2) biotite-

phlogopite, (3) pyrite-feldspar, and (4) carbonate (including iron carbonate). In addition, green, 

vanadium-bearing mica is characteristic of the alteration at Hemlo. This green mica is associated with ore 

grade gold mineralization. The sedimentary rocks tend to be altered to calc-silicates including calcite, 

tremolite-actinolite and epidote. Barite is a characteristic mineral at Hemlo. It occurs as lenses, wisps, 

veinlets and as massive barite and breccia matrix. Barite tends to be associated with high-grade

mineralization. Its origin has been debated, with some suggesting a sedimentary origin (Cameron and 

Hattori, 1985) and others suggesting a hydrothermal origin (Muir, 2002). Barium is anomalous in many 

fracture controlled alteration minerals.

Various genetic deposit models have been suggested for Hemlo, including porphyry, shear-zone hosted 

and skarn. Muir (2002) concluded that Hemlo was an "atypical, mesozonal, high-strain zone hosted, 

disseminated replacement deposit" (Figure 8-1). 

8.2 Orogenic Gold Deposits 

In addition to Hemlo-type deposits, Entourage also explores for orogenic gold deposits ("shear zone 

hosted", "mesothermal", "greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein" deposit; Figure 8-2). These deposits 

occur in deformed greenstone belts, particularly those that are characterized by tholeiitic basalts and 

ultramafic komatiites intruded by intermediate to felsic porphyritic intrusions (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007). 

They are located along major compressional to transtensional crustal-scale fault zones marking 

convergent margins between major units but ore is typically hosted by second- and third order shears and 

faults and at jogs and changes in strike (Goldfarb et al., 2005). In Canada, these vein deposits are often 

associated with conglomerates (e.g. the Timiskaming conglomerate). They are a major source of gold in 

the greenstone belts of the Superior and Slave provinces of the Canadian Shield. None of these deposits 

has been found in the Hemlo greenstone belt. 

Orogenic gold deposits are characterized by a network of auriferous, laminated quartz-carbonate veins 

and locally hydrothermal breccias. The dominant sulfides are pyrite and arsenopyrite but W-, Bi- and Te-

bearing phases are also common. Sulfides also occur disseminated in the wall rock. Typical alteration 

includes iron-carbonate, silicification, muscovite, chlorite, K-feldspar, biotite, tourmaline and albite.  

Orogenic deposits formed from metamorphic fluids (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007) that were rich in CO2, low 

in salinity and generated during prograde metamorphism where the fluids were channelled along major 

crustal deformation zones. Drastic pressure changes (and resulting unmixing and desulfidation) and wall 

rock interaction caused the precipitation of the sulfides (and gold).  

World-class ore bodies are between 2 and 10 km long, approximately 1 km wide and extend to depths of 

2 to 3 km (Goldfarb et al., 2005). Canadian examples include the Timmins, Kirkland Lake, Val d'Or and 

Rouyn-Noranda districts of the Abitibi greenstone belt and the Pickle Lake and Rice Lake greenstone 

belts of the Uchi subprovince (Figure 8-3).

9.0 MINERALIZATION 

The source of information about the mineralization is dominantly the historic drilling. Entourage has not 

discovered any mineralization on the surface to date. 

Gold mineralization is typically hosted by schists that had experienced moderate to strong shearing and 

alteration (silicification, carbonatization). The protolith for these rocks were porphyritic to felsic dikes.  

Three to 4 % disseminated pyrite and minor chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and Fe-Ti oxides occur in 

mineralized rocks (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2006).  

Homestake collected rock samples in several geochemically anomalous zones. Samples from the area of 

historic holes Y84-1, Y84-2 and Y84-3 contained 2 to 293 ppb Au (MNDMF assessment file: 

42D09NE2006). The hosts of the mineralization in this area are strongly foliated and sheared, silicified 

and carbonatized intermediate feldspar porphyry dikes, mafic volcanic flows and clastic sedimentary 

rocks. Between 0.5 and 10 % pyrite were reported from holes Y84-1, -2 and -3 (locally up to 20 % in Y-

84-2; 42D09NE0119). Pyrite is associated with silicified zones and biotite-rich sections. Quartz-pyrite 

veinlets are common in these holes. Pyrite is also hosted by calcite-filled fractures. Chlorite and sericite 

alteration is locally spatially associated with pyrite. Table 6-5 shows gold assay results of holes Y84-1, -2 

and -3. 

Drill holes RD85-1 and A85-1 intersected several narrow, sulfide-rich zones of mafic volcanic rocks and 

quartz-feldspar porphyries. Both rock types are sheared. The gold values for samples from sulfide-rich 

intervals of these holes range from 205 to 228 ppb. Barite was also described to be associated with the 

gold mineralization in these drill holes (up to 3.68 %). Mineralized zones in hole A85-1 are described as 

containing up to 10% pyrite, partly hosted along contacts between pillows and hyaloclastic material and 

associated with calcite stringers (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0119); the mineralized zones are 

locally strongly carbonatized and hematitized. In addition to pyrite, pyrrhotite was also encountered in 

A85-1. Table 6-5 shows gold assay results of holes RD85-1 and A85-1. 

The area of historic drill holes L85-2 and TC-85-1 was also described as potentially hosting 

mineralization (42D09NE2006). In L85-2 disseminated sulfide mineralization consisting of trace to 2 % 

disseminated pyrite with minor hematite alteration, local bleaching and epidote-carbonate-sericite 

alteration was intersected (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0119). Minor quartz-carbonate veins were 

also reported. Disseminated pyrite from trace to 1 % were reported for hole TC-85-1 (MNDMF 

assessment file: 42D09NE0119). In addition to pyrite, lenses and bedding-parallel laminae of pyrrhotite

occurs locally in TC-85-1. Traces of sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite and locally up to 5 % of these 

sulfides occur on fractures. The mineralization is associated with biotite alteration and minor bleaching. 

Most of the mineralized zones described in Assessment Report 42D09NE2006 are located in high-strain 

zones. This deformation zone was called the Rous Lake deformation zone (RLDZ) in Assessment Report 

42D09NE2006. This deformation zone is most likely the Lake Superior shear zone of Muir (2002). 

A gold grade of 4.95 g/t over 1.6 m was returned from historic hole RL00-01 (Table 6-12). Disseminated 

pyrite was hosted by locally porphyritic mafic volcanics that showed pervasive carbonatization and 

carbonate veins and veinlets (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE2012).  

At the Toothpick Properties, mineralization was reported to be hosted by rhyolite breccia, e.g., Esso's 

1985 hole TW-002 where 960 ppb Au over 0.4 m and 940 ppb Au over 0.6 m were reported (Table 6-21; 

MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NW0077). One to 5 % disseminated pyrite occur in the mineralized 

zone. Quartz-chlorite filled fractures are characteristic in this zone. In historic hole 65-1 an interval of 0.6 

m is reported to contain 1.3 g/t Au (MNDMF assessment file: 42D09NE0181). The mineralization is 

hosted by sheared intermediate to felsic tuffs with 2 to 7 %, locally up to 10 %, pyrite. Molybdenite and 

brecciated quartz veins with pink calcite also occurs in this interval.  

Teck intersected high grade mineralization in several drill holes in on Toothpick East and Toothpick West 

in 2000 to 2002.  

In 2000, the drill program on Toothpick East intersected Au mineralization. The holes were designed to 

test the deformation zone at the east and west end of the Toothpick East property.  One high grade and 

several anomalous Au assays were taken from the two completed holes (Table 6-24) including sample 

Z01894 from hole TE00-02 which is 0.3 m long, from 522.7 m to 523.0 m, and ran 17.330 g/t Au. This 

high grade sample (Z01894) was hosted by felsic quartz eye volcanics with 20-25% quartz-carbonate 

veins with 3-5% chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite and molybdenite. Sample Z01826 from hole TE00-02 

is 1.5 m long from 424.5 to 426.0 m and contained 1.28 g/t Au. This high grade sample (Z01826) was 

hosted by massive felsic volcanics with 15% quartz-carbonate veins with weak sericite and 2% pyrite. 

In 2001, the drill program on Toothpick West intersected Au mineralization. Hole TW01-01 was designed 

to test the down plunge extension of the "Porphyry Zone" and "C Zone". Several mid to high grade Au 

assays were intersected (Table 6-26) the best of which was sample Z3980 in hole TW01-01, a one metre 

sample from 301.0 m to 302.0 m which ran 14.81 g/t Au. Another notable high grade sample from the 

same hole was sample Z3985 from 305.0 to 306.0 m which contained 8.47 g/t Au. Both samples (Z3980 

and Z3985) were hosted by albitic porphyry with 2-3% pyrite.

 Toronto – Vancouver – Sudbury– Johannesburg 

In 2002, the drill program on Toothpick West intersected Au mineralization. Hole TW02-01 was designed 

to test the down plunge extension of the "Porphyry Zone".  Several mid to high grade Au assays were 

intersected (Table 6-28) the best of which was sample Z07414 in hole TW02-01, a 0.4 m sample from 

522.2 m to 522.6 m which ran 5.35 g/t Au. This sample (Z07414) was hosted by quartz-feldspar porphyry 

with 1-2 % pyrite. 

Outcrop on the Property is sparse and most of the reported mineralization occurs in widely spaced drill 

core. Therefore lengths, widths, depths and continuity of the mineralized zones are not known.  

10.0 EXPLORATION 

Since June 2010, Entourage has been preparing for a future exploration and drilling program by 

compiling geological data, conducting field work and completing an aerial photo of the property. A 

significant amount of the data compilation was completed by Brody (2010). Entourage's compiled 

geological data on the properties include:  

• Published spatial data primarily from MNDMF – bedrock geology maps, geophysics data files 

(magnetic, gravity, aeromagnetic, electromagnetic and conventional EM surveys), drill hole 

database, mineral deposits database, SRTM data for altitude, landsat ETM orthorectified and 

georeferenced data, topographic maps 

• MNDMF assessment file reports. Geological maps within the assessment files were 

georeferenced and down hole survey files for historic drill holes were manually entered into excel 

The spatial data was compiled into MapInfo and excel files.  

Field work by Entourage consisted of determining access to different parts of the Property and searching 

for collars of historic drill holes. Drill collar recovery was necessary to check the accuracy of drill hole 

location and to see whether drill collars actually exist since it is proposed that down hole geophysics may 

assist in defining drill targets. Several historic drill hole collars on the Toothpick West Property have been 

located (Table 10-1). 

Field traverses were also undertaken to check the mapped distribution of Quaternary cover since past 

drilling has been impeded by the very thick post glacial debris and sands which occur in certain areas 

thought to be potential drill targets. The field traverses also assisted in determining the extent of outcrop 

for potential future rock sampling. Samples collected during prospecting were not assayed.

Aerial photo of the property was completed on Oct. 5, 2010 by KBM Forestry Consultants Inc. using a 

metric digital aerial camera (Figure 10-1). The photo was flown with a 72 mm lens, 60 MP digital camera 

and with the relatively standard 60/40 overlap. The total number of frames was about 535.The system was 

fully calibrated and recorded positional and inertial measurements to produce colour ortho-mosaics.  The 

imagery delivered to Entourage has an average ground resolution of 25 cm.

11.0 DRILLING 

Entourage has not completed any drilling on the Properties. 

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

CCIC is not aware of any sampling on the Properties. 

13.0 SAMPLE SECURITY, PREPARATION, AND ANALYSIS 

CCIC is not aware of any sampling on the Properties. 

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

14.1 CCIC Site Visit 

Elisabeth Ronacher visited the Properties on September 22, 2010. The purpose of the site visit was to 

determine whether significant outcrop existed on the Properties, whether any mineralization could be 

detected on the surface and what type of access to the Properties existed.  

The Rous-Bomby Property was reached on an all season trail off Highway 17 at approximately UTM 

570353E and 5393284N. No significant outcrop exists at Rous-Bomby (Figure 14-1). Most of the 

Property is covered by tens of metres of quaternary sediments (sand; Figure 14-2) with the exception of a 

ridge in the southern most part of the Property at the contact of the volcanic rocks with the Heron Bay 

Pluton. The outcrops along this ridge are intensely sheared (lapilli?) tuff; they were investigated along 

~1.5 km during the site visit (Figure 14-3). No mineralization was encountered. Gold occurrences in this 

area indicated on the Ontario Geological Survey Map 2614 of the Schreiber-Hemlo greenstone belt are 

most likely based on drill hole information. No roads to the northern part of the Rous Property were 

located.

Figure 14-3: Outcrops along a ridge at the contact of volcanic rocks with the Heron Bay pluton. 

 

At the Toothpick West Property, outcrop is exposed along the rail tracks that cross the Property (Figure 

14-4) and along the shore line of Lake Superior (Figure 14-5). This outcrop was inspected along ~3 km. 

The dominant rock type in this area is intermediate to mafic volcanic rocks, some with fragments, some 

with quartz-feldspar porphyroblasts. Several high-strain zones were observed but no mineralization was 

encountered. Several historic diamond drill holes exist on the Toothpick West Property. Casings of drill 

holes TW-001 and TW-002 were found at 551288E and 5389439N (Figure 14-6) and the casing of 

TW01-02 was located at 551062E and 5389675N (Figure 14-7). The drill holes can be accessed along an 

old trail that Entourage had improved for use with an ATV. This trail appears to be the only access to the 

Property that is suitable for motorized transport. 

The southwestern most claim of the Toothpick East Property was visited along the train tracks. No 

significant outcrop was observed.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

CCIC was unable to verify the information on adjacent properties and mines and this information is not 

necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Rous-Bomby and Toothpick Properties that are the 

subject of this report. In this Report, a clear distinction between the mineralization on the adjacent 

properties and the Properties held by Entourage is made. 

15.1 Hemlo Gold Deposit 

The Hemlo gold deposit, consisting of the currently producing David Bell and Williams mines and the 

closed Golden Giant mine (closed in 2006) was discovered in 1981. The Hemlo deposit has produced ~86 

Mt of ore at an average gold grade of 6.32 g/t for Williams and David Bell Mine and 11.52 g/t for former 

Golden Giant mine for a total of 20.3 Moz Au (production data to end of 2009 from Scott et al., 2010). 

The mines are owned by Barrick Gold Corp. and divided into several zones along a restraining bend in 

the Hemlo greenstone belt. Further details of the deposit are provided in section 8 (Deposit Model). 

Entourage's claims lie just west of the Hemlo Gold Deposits along the Hemlo-Heron Bay Deformation 

Zone which hosts the deposits.  This zone is characterized by highly deformed rocks with anomalous Au, 

Ba, and Mo. 

15.2 Beaufield Resources/ Jiminex Inc. 

Beaufield Resources ("Beaufield") and Jiminex Inc. ("Jiminex") hold the Northern Eagle property 

consisting of 100 claims west of the Rous-Bomby claim group (Figure 15-1; Jiminex.com, News Release 

August 3, 2009). The Northern Eagle property is centered on a barite outcrop. Beaufield and Jiminex 

compiled historic exploration data on their property in a 3D model (Jiminex News Release March 3, 

2010). The 3D model delineated a number of targets that were tested with deep induced polarization and 

magnetotellurics (Titan 24; Jiminex News Release, August 19, 2010). On October 4, 2010, Jiminex 

announced that the Titan 24 survey had delineated two priority drilling targets (Jiminex News Release, 

October 4, 2010).  

These barite occurrences are along strike of the Hemlo-Heron Bay Shear Zone and represent the 

continuance of the mineralized deformation zone which hosts the Hemlo Gold Deposits.  It is known that 

barite is intimately associated with the ore at the Hemlo deposits. Entourage's Rous Lake claims lie 

between the Hemlo deposits and the Beaufield/Jiminex claims.

15.5 Teck/Stenlund Property 

Just east of Toothpick West is the Teck's Stenlund property which is host to the formerly known Heron 

Bay Mine. Two shafts (one 8 m deep and the other 16 m deep) produced some ore that was apparently 

shipped in the early 1870's.  This property has several well documented zones of mineralization which 

include The Main Zone (Heron Bay Mine), Porphyry Zone and C Zone (Muir et al., 1991). 

The Main Zone, Porphyry Zone, and C Zone strike and plunge onto the Toothpick West Property. 

Intercepts within these zones are significant. All zones are characterized by geochemically anomalous 

gold values.   The Main Zone had intersection of 3.4 g/t over 0.9 m (Muir et al., 1991) with the best 

intersection reported by Patterson et al. (1986) of 150 g/t over 0.3 m (4.83 oz). The Porphyry Zone had 

intersections of 7.3 g/t over 7.2 meters and the C Zone had intersections of 6.3 g/t over 4.1 meters. 

It has also been documented that drilling extended the Main Zone to a vertical depth of 503 meters with a 

minimum strike length of 1.7 km.  Drilling also appeared to show that the intensity of alteration and gold 

and molybdenum mineralization values improved slightly at depth. 

CCIC was unable to verify the information on adjacent properties and this information is not necessarily 

indicative of mineralization on the Rous-Bomby and Toothpick Properties. In this Report, a clear 

distinction is made between the mineralization on the adjacent properties and the mineralization on the 

Rous-Bomby and Toothpick Properties.

19.0 CONCLUSIONS 

Entourage has secured rights to two properties: Rous Bomby and Toothpick East and West within the 

Hemlo Greenstone belt. Gold was discovered in the Hemlo area in 1981 and this lead to a staking rush 

and a lot of exploration work in the early 1980's. Entourage's current Rous Bomby property claim block 

was originally divided into 9 claim block owned by 9 different companies. Historic exploration on 

Entourage's Rous Bomby property in the 1980's included: geological compilation reports, line cutting, 

geophysics surveys (magnetometer, gravity, VLF EM, IP), soil sampling, lithogeochemical sampling, 

geological mapping, airborne orthophoto survey, diamond drilling and overburden drilling. In 1991, 

Homestake acquired all of Entourage's current Rous Bomby claim block and divided it into two 

properties: Rous Lake and Bel-Air. In the 1990's Homestake exploration on the property included: 

geophysics surveys (ground magnetics, VLF-EM, IP/Resistivity "Realsection", refraction seismic), 

lithogeochemical sampling, geological mapping and diamond drilling.  

In 1983, Esso conducted an airborne geophysics survey (magnetics, electromagnetic and VLF-EM) on 

Toothpick East and West properties. From 1984-1986, Esso conducted drill programs with a total of 3 

holes on Toothpick East and 10 holes on Toothpick West. In 1994, Homestake conducted geophysics 

surveys on the Toothpick East and West properties which included: ground magnetic, VLF-EM and 

reconnaissance and IP/Resistivity "Realsection" surveys. In 2000, Teck conducted a drill program on the 

Toothpick East property which consisted of 3 drill holes. Teck also conducted a drill program on 

Toothpick West: 6 holes in 2001 and 3 holes in 2002.  

Since June 2010, Entourage has been preparing for a future exploration and drilling program. Entourage 

has compiled geological data on the properties and conducted field work. The field work was completed 

to determine access to different parts of the property, search for historic drill collars, and observe 

distribution of Quaternary cover and outcrop. No samples were analyzed as a result of the field work. The 

data density and data reliability of the current field work is adequate for the purpose of due diligence of 

historic exploration results. Based on the compilation of historic data, preliminary field work and 

knowledge of the local geology, targets for future exploration have been identified. Entourage contracted 

KBM Forestry Consultants Inc. to take an aerial photo on Oct. 5, 2010 of the area which includes Rous 

Bomby and Toothpick East and West properties. Entourage has not completed any drilling on the 

Properties.

The Rous Bomby property is along strike and to the west of the Hemlo deposit(s) discovered in 1981 and 

mined since 1985. The Hemlo deposit exhibits many of the characteristics common to Proterozoic 

greenstone belts in other parts of Canada and the world like Australia, west Africa and South America.     

Collection, review and synthesis of data from previous work was completed by Brody (2010) and 

Entourage has made good progress to date in this endeavour.   From the previous work and as a result of 

studies made possible by access to mineralization at the Hemlo Mine, a number of new ideas have 

developed concerning the controls to gold in this area. It is apparent that at each property there is potential 

to discover gold mineralization.   The goal of Entourage's work should be to use all available techniques 

to define drill targets that will warrant testing. Judicious use of geochemistry and geophysics, both surface 

geophysics and down hole geophysics will need to be employed.  These methods coupled with analysis of 

previous work and complemented with the intimate knowledge that has been developed from 25 years of 

mining at Hemlo should be refined to develop drill targets.  Drilling may have to be deep with holes to 

and perhaps in excess of 1,000 m or even up to 2,000 m.     

The qualified persons for this report believe that the completed exploration project to date has met its 

original objectives of collection, review and synthesis of historic data and target generation for future 

drilling. The qualified persons for this report believe that the data density for the historic drilling and 

lithogeochemistry surveys is adequate for the purpose of regional grassroots exploration and the historic 

assays are reliable. CCIC has not verified the historic assays. CCIC concludes that the Rous Bomby, and 

Toothpick East and West properties have the potential to host a Hemlo-type deposit or an orogenic gold 

deposit. A gold deposit may be discovered if exploration techniques are used to image through the deep 

overburden and drill targets are selected using the knowledge gained from the historic exploration on the 

property.  

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

20.1 Discussion 

The two properties Entourage has optioned from Barrick show potential for mineralization.  Several 

targets or target areas are apparent from the compilation of historic data, field work and Entourage's and 

their consultants knowledge of the local geology. 

At Rous Lake there are historical drill intercepts within the Rous Lake deformation zone that have 

anomalous gold (0.4 g/t Au over 11.0 meters) and evidence of elevated barium (1.1 %Ba over 8.9 m).

Examples of holes with anomalous gold and elevated Ba include Y84-1, RL97-01 and A85-1. These holes 

define westerly plunging mineralization.  In addition, Toothpick West's historical drilling has also 

defined a westerly plunge to the hanging wall contact of the Porphyry Zone.  These plunge lines of 

mineralization are very similar to what is seen in the Hemlo ore deposits further east and along trend.  It 

has been shown that this plunge controls ore grade mineralization to depth at the Hemlo deposits. 

Failure to adequately recognise the regional plunge control to mineralization in the Hemlo District has 

frustrated previous explorers.  It is recommended that Entourage test these mineralized plunge lines at 

depth and along strike.  These are valid targets that need to be tested and are derived from knowledge 

gained from 25 years of mining, and various academic research papers. Much more is known about the 

belt and the mineralization than was available to the rash of exploration undertaken in the decade after 

Hemlo was discovered in 1981. A majority of these targets lie below 300 meters vertical depth; limited 

historical exploration has been accomplished at these depths. Since the majority of the targets will be 

below 300 m vertical elevation, a staged approach should be considered when exploring these properties; 

Phase I and Phase II.   

20.2 Phase I 

Deep overburden (up to 150 m deep of glacial-lacustrine deposits) posed additional problems with 

exploration in the Rous Lake area.  This cover is difficult to see through geochemically and a major 

powerline traverses the area of interest, thus preventing good electrical geophysical targeting.  Phase I 

over this area should consider employing other geophysical or geochemical techniques to image through 

this cover. It should also continue the compilation all the historical data and attempt to develop a 3D 

model to target appropriate areas.  This will also help in the interpretations of the geophysical and 

geochemical surveys.  

3D model of historic exploration data 

A vast amount of historic data exists for the Rous-Bomby and Toothpick Properties much of which was 

compiled by Brody (2010). CCIC recommends continuation of the compilation of the historic information 

in a digital database and integrating the data in a 3D model in order to advance the Properties. This 

information includes bedrock geological data, structural data, surface geochemical data, drill hole 

information (e.g., rock types, alteration, gold grades, trace element concentrations) and geophysical data. 

The model will also contain geographic and cultural data. The surface bedrock geology can be projected

to depth and integrated with the rocks logged in drill core to produce a geological model. Zones of high 

gold grades can be highlighted and correlated with trace element concentrations (e.g., Ba, Mo, V). 

 

Lithogeochemical survey 

To better understand exploration targets at depth a lithogeochemical programs over the claims should be 

implemented in an attempt to map the footprint of any hydrothermal system that might exist at depth.  

Rather than map generic alkali haloes, each alkali element can be related to a particular mineral species; 

for example, Rb correlates with muscovite, Ba correlates with phengite and Cs correlates with biotite. 

Enrichment of these elements can map the alteration mineralogy.  

It has been shown that two domains of contrasting fluid types and associated alteration exists near major 

gold deposits (S.Halley, personal communication and presentations).  The composition of the two 

contrasting fluids is not yet known for the Hemlo deposit. These boundaries could represent EH, pH, and 

pressure-temperate gradients that played a role in gold deposition in the area.  By understanding these 

boundaries, it is possible to target specific areas for further exploration. S. Halley has successfully used 

this exploration technique in Western Australia (deposit Wallaby) and in the Abitibi (Dome deposit).   

Geophysics 

In addition, Phase I downhole geophysics on historical DDH (diamond drill holes) is recommended to 

model the subsurface for additional targets at both properties.  This would first consist of appropriate 

borehole geophysical characterization (borehole logging) of the historical drillholes.  If appropriate 

targets can be defined from the information on the borehole logging, then a Phase II downhole 

IP/Resistivity method should be deployed. Since some of the historical holes might be 

compromised/collasped due to time, a drill rig should be used to clean each hole and then cased with PVC 

to allow the acquisition of geophysical information. 

The geophysical method for Phase I at Rous Lake could employ a gravity survey to delineate areas of 

high barite.  This barite is intimately associated with the ore at the Hemlo Gold Deposits.  In addition, to 

develop geochemical signatures at depth, a soil gas survey should be considered with a corresponding 

selective extraction technique performed on the overlying soils.  Location of historical boreholes should 

be found so downhole IP/Resisitivity could be used if possible.

20.3 Phase II 

Drilling 

The recommended Phase II drill program at Rous Lake will need to determine the best method to case 

through the up to 150 m thick overburden.  After casing installation the drill program should proceed to 

test targets to depths below 300 m vertical depth.  Some areas should be tested more deeply to depths of 

1,500 m to test plunge lines of anomalous zones in the bedrock. 

Phase II drill testing at Toothpick should be similar to Rous Lake Claims.  However, at Toothpick the 

overburden is not significant and casing issues will not pose a problem. 

Phase 1 will help delineate diamond drilling targets. Nevertheless, Phase 2 is not contingent on Phase 1. 

CCIC recommends drilling at least 8 drill holes on selected targets covering all of the Properties (Rous 

Bomby, Toothpick East and West). The drill holes will be at least 1,000 m deep possibly even 2,000 m 

deep.  

Geophysics 

In addition, CCIC recommends that a deep borehole rock property survey be completed on selected drill 

holes. This would acquire in-situ physical rock properties to aid in the characterization and targeting of 

mineralized zones in 3D. The physical rock properties probes include: 

• Poly Electric Resistivity/Natural Gamma/Fluid Resistivity and Temperature 

• Magnetic Susceptibility 

• Inductive Conductivity 

• Induced Polarization 

• Focused Density (requires radioactive source) 

• Neutron Porosity (requires radioactive source) 

• Full Waveform Sonic 

• 3-Arm Caliper 

• Optical Televiewer (OTV) – Optional, if the deposit is structurally controlled
