1 Summary
The Cobalt Mountain project area is located approximately 14 km south of Hazelton in northwest British 
Columbia in the Rocher Deboulé mountain range. Mining and mineral exploration activities have been 
intermittent in the area for over a century and focused on various commodities including gold, silver, 
copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, tungsten and uranium. 

Past producing underground mines in the area operated in the early and mid - 1900's and focused on 
polymetallic quartz veins hosted near the margins of the Rocher Deboulé stock. Vein hosted deposits 
remain prospective but are generally low tonnage and difficult to market. The proximal nature of the veins 
around the stock suggests the stock itself may be the main metallogenic driver to precious and base metal 
mineralization. 

This report is a compilation of all the work completed on the project area to date. The goal of this report 
is to provide a platform for future mineral exploration on the property for porphyry style, base metal 
deposits with peripheral polymetallic vein hosted deposits. A recommended work program includes 
property scale mapping, prospecting, geochemical sampling, helicopter supported trenching and 1,500 m 
of diamond drilling. Total cost of the proposed work for Year 1 is $120,000 with a follow-up budget of 
$530,000 contingent on positive results.

4.3 Mineral Rights in British Columbia
Mineral Claims in British Columbia are subdivided into two major categories: Placer and Mineral. Both are 
acquired using the Mineral Titles Online (MTO) system.  The online MTO system allows clients to acquire 
and maintain (register work, payments, etc.) mineral and placer claims. Mineral Titles can be acquired 
anywhere in the province where there are no other impeding interests (other mineral titles, reserves, 
parks, etc.). 

The electronic Internet map allows you to select single or multiple adjoining grid cells.  Cell sizes vary from 
approximately 21 hectares (457m x 463m) in the south to approximately 16 hectares at the north of the 
province. Cell size variance is due to the longitude lines that gradually converge toward the North Pole.

Longford Exploration Services Ltd. Page 11 of 61
4840-0785-4434, v. 3

MTO will calculate the exact area in hectares according to the cells you select, and calculate the required 
fee.  The fee is charged for the entire cell, even though a portion may be unavailable due to a prior legacy 
title or alienated land. The fee for Mineral Claim registration is $1.75 per hectare.

Upon immediate confirmation of payment, the mineral rights title is issued and assigned a tenure 
number for the registered claim. Email confirmation of your transaction and title is sent immediately.

Rights to any ground encumbered by existing legacy claims will not be granted with the cell claim except 
through the Conversion process. However, the rights held by a legacy claim or lease will accrue to the cell 
claim if the legacy claim or lease should terminate through forfeiture, abandonment, or cancellation, but 
not if the legacy claim is taken to lease.  Similarly, if a cell partially covers land that is alienated (park, 
reserve etc.) or a reserve, no rights to the alienated or reserved land are acquired. But, if that alienation 
or reserve is subsequently rescinded, the rights held by the cell expand over the former alienated or 
reserve land within the border of the cell.

Upon registration, a cell claim is deemed to commence as of that date ("Date of Issue"), and is good until 
the "Expiry Date" (Good to Date) that is one year from the date of registration.  To maintain the claim 
beyond the expiry date, exploration and development work must be performed and registered, or a 
payment instead of exploration and development may be registered.  If the claim is not maintained, it will 
forfeit at the end of the "expiry date" and it is the responsibility of every recorded holder to maintain their 
claims; no notice of pending forfeiture is sent to the recorded holder.

A mineral or placer claim has a set expiry date (the "Good to Date"), and in order to maintain the claim 
beyond that expiry date, the recorded holder (or an agent) must, on or before the expiry date, register 
either exploration and development work that was performed on the claim, or a payment instead of 
exploration and development.  Failure to maintain a claim results in automatic forfeiture at the end 
(midnight) of the expiry date; there is no notice to the claim holder prior to forfeiture.

When exploration and development work or a payment instead of work is registered, you may advance 
the claim forward to any new date.  With a payment, instead of work the minimum requirement is 6 
months, and the new date cannot exceed one year from the current expiry date; with work, it may be any 
date up to a maximum of ten years beyond the current anniversary year.  "Anniversary year" means the 
period of time that you are now in from the last expiry date to the next immediate expiry date.

All recorded holders of a claim must hold a valid Free Miners Certificate ("FMC") when either work or a 
payment is registered on the claim.

Clients need to register a certain value of work or a "cash-in-lieu of work" payment to their claims in MTO.

4.4 Property Legal Status
The Mineral Titles Online website (https://www.mtonline.gov.bc.ca/mtov/home.do) confirms that all 
claims of the Cobalt Mountain property as described in Table 4.1 were in good standing at the date of this 
report and that no legal encumbrances were registered with the Mineral Titles Branch against the titles 
at that date. The author makes no further assertion with regard to the legal status of the property. The 
property has not been legally surveyed to date and no requirement to do so has existed.

There are no other royalties, back-in rights, environmental liabilities, or other known risks to undertake 
exploration.

4.5 Surface Rights in British Columbia
Surface rights are not included with mineral claims in British Columbia. 

4.6 Permitting
Any work which disturbs the surface by mechanical means on a mineral claim in British Columbia requires 
a Notice of Work (NOW) permit under the Mines Act. The owner must receive written approval from a 
Provincial Mines Inspector prior to undertaking such work. This includes but is not limited to the following 
types of work: drilling, trenching, excavating, blasting, construction of a camp, demolition of a camp, 
induced polarization surveys using exposed electrodes, and reclamation.

Exploration activities which do not require a NOW permit include: prospecting with hand tools, 
geological/geochemical surveys, airborne geophysical surveys, ground geophysics without exposed 
electrodes, hand trenching, and the establishment of grids. These activities and those that require Permits 
are outlined and governed by the Mines Act of British Columbia.

The Chief Inspector of Mines makes the decision if land access will be permitted. Other agencies, 
principally the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources (FLNRO), determine where and how the 
access may be constructed and used. With the Chief Inspector's authorization, a mineral tenure holder 
must be issued the appropriate "Special Use Permit" by FLNRO, subject to specified terms and conditions. 
The Ministry of Energy and Mines makes the decision whether land access is appropriate and FLNRO issue 
a Special Use Permit. However, a collaborative effort and authorization between ministries, jointly 
determine the location, design and maintenance provisions of the approved road.

Notification must be provided before entering private land for any mining or exploration activity, including 
non-intrusive forms of mineral exploration such as mapping surface features and collecting rock, water or 
soil samples. Notification may be hand delivered, mailed, emailed or faxed to the owner shown on the 
British Columbia Assessment Authority records or the Land Title Office records. Mining activities cannot 
start sooner than eight days after notice has been served. Notice must include a description or map of

where the work will be conducted and a description of what type of work will be done, when it will take 
place and approximately how many people will be on the site.

The issuer does not currently have any permits pertaining to exploration on the property.

5 Accessibility, Infrastructure and Climate, 
5.1 Accessibility
The Cobalt Mountain property is located 14 km south of Hazelton and 45 km northwest of Smithers within 
the Hazelton Mountains in the Rocher Deboulé Range. Access is limited to helicopter above treeline and 
with historical mine roads and trails reaching the property from the west and east. The west side of the 
property is accessed via the Rocher Deboulé mine road which leaves Highway 16 at Skeena Crossing and 
follows Juniper Creek for approximately 12 km before heading east on the Red Rose mine road for 4 km. 
This road is washed out in several locations and is only accessible by ATV after the first 5 km. The east side 
of the property is accessed by a 12.5 km long ATV trail running along Boulder Creek (built by Sultana Silver 
Mines Ltd.) which can be accessed from Highway 16 approximately 10 km north of Moricetown.

Due to the nature of these trails, and the topography of the project area, helicopter access from Smithers 
is the most efficient mode of transportation.

The closest town is Hazelton (population: 305) followed by the larger town of Smithers (population: 5404) 
which is a hub for the mining and forestry industries in northern British Columbia.  Mining and exploration 
personnel and services are readily available including numerous helicopter, drilling, expediting, heavy 
equipment, pad and camp construction companies as well as the Smithers Branch of the Ministry of 
Energy and Mines. There are also daily commercial flights to Smithers from Vancouver.

5.2 Climate and Physiography
Weather is typical of alpine and subalpine regions of northwestern British Columbia with a wide 
temperature range from warm summers and long, cold winters.  Summers are warm, with daily averages 
or around 15° C.  Winters are cold with average temperatures of around -7° C.  Snow can be expected on 
the property from late September to early June. Total annual precipitation for Smithers is 508.5 mm. 
Spring and summer months usually experience moderate rainfall however the core of the property is at 
significantly higher elevations and therefore experiences much more dramatic weather patterns.  Due to 
the accumulation of deep snow, the exploration season is typically between July and September at higher 
elevations and from late May to early October at lower elevations.  

The nearest active weather station to the property is 45 km southeast at the Smithers Regional Airport.

The property is within the Rocher Deboulé Range, a subrange of the Bulkley Ranges, on the eastern edge 
of the larger Coast Mountain Range.  Within the claims topographic relief is generally steep to locally 
precipitous with large areas covered in talus and bare rock. Elevation varies from 920 m at valley level in 
the east to 2,469 m on Brian Boru peak. Cirque glaciers and permanent snowfields are common along the 
north and east slopes of the higher peaks. Streams draining to the flow into the Skeena River and streams 
draining to the east flow into the Bulkley River.

The treeline is generally found around 1,100 m with abundant outcrop above. Below the treeline, 
vegetation consists of pine, spruce, balsam, and fir. Above the treeline heather dominates with small 
patches of alpine fir in the protected gullies and depressions.

Fauna in the area include deer, moose, mountain goats, as well as black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, 
coyotes and wolverines representing carnivorous animals.

6 History
The Cobalt Mountain area has a history of mineral exploration and limited production dating back to at 
least 1910. Substantial production from high-grade vein deposits occurred between 1915 and 1954 from 
the Roché Deboulé and Red Rose mines. Lesser production from the nearby Victoria, Cap, and Highland 
Boy mines also occurred in the same time frame. 

Past work on the Cobalt Mountain property has been intermittent by various companies at different 
times. More recently, the area was consolidated and the current property made up the majority of the 
Porphyry Creek Project which was explored by Duncastle Gold Corp. in 2010-2011 before their claims 
were sold in 2014.

British Columbia's Minfile database lists seven separate occurrences within the Cobalt Mountain property. 
An eighth occurrence, Red Rose, is within underlying crown grant tenures owned by Freeport Resources 
Inc. The crown grants are entirely encompassed within the Brunswick claim. A summary of the historical 
work completed on the Cobalt Mountain claims, including Red Rose due to its local significance, is 
tabulated below in Table 6.1 and 6.2.

6.1.1 Sultana
The Sultana prospect was first described as the Last Chance and Little Wonder prospects by the Geological 
Survey of Canada in the 1910 Summary Report. Prospectors explored the property in 1912 but work was 
not officially recorded until 1921 in the British Columbia Minister of Mines Annual Reports where it was 
referred to as the Sultana property. During 1921 – 1923, prospectors McDonald and Hicks improved the 
trail and excavated trenches to trace mineralization. Samples returned values up to 0.22 oz/t Au, 112 oz/t 
Ag, and 16.0% Cu over 125 feet strike length 4-20 feet wide.

In 1923, the Granby Consolidated Mining, Smelting and Power Company optioned the property and 
resampled trenches and completed one 80 foot drill hole. Results were disappointing and the option 
lapsed.

In 1939 the claims were staked and worked briefly before being dropped again until G. Parent & Associates 
re-staked the area in 1951 and conducted limited surface work through to 1952. The property was 
optioned to the Northern B.C. Mining Co. in 1953 who mapped and sampled the trenches in order to 
recommend drill hole locations.

In 1966 Sultana Silver Mines Ltd. re-staked the Sultana area within the Silvertip group of claims. During 
the next 7 years, a variety of work was carried out including 911 meters of drilling in 13 holes. Additional 
work included 20 trenches, mapping and geophysical and geochemical surveys some of which was 
conducted while the property was under option to Utah Construction Co. in 1970 – 1971. Following this 
work, a 1982 desktop review of the property mentions limited prospecting taking place.

In 2010, Duncastle Gold Corp. conducted a 425 line km airborne magnetic and radiometric geophysical 
survey across the Rocher DeBoule Range. Geophysical targets at Sultana were drill tested in 2010 -2011 
with 3,924 m in 9 holes (Figure 6.1). Drill results expanded anomalous copper-molybdenum, porphyry 
style mineralization and alteration over a 300 x 200 meter area.

6.1.2 Armagosa
First accounts of the Armagosa showing is documented in the 1912 and 1916 Annual Report of the 
Minister of Mines. The showing is located between the Red Rose and Rocher Deboule mines but has not 
seen a significant amount of work.

Skeena Silver Mines Ltd. discovered a scheelite vein above the old workings in 1952 while they were 
focussed on developing the nearby Brunswick showing.

In 1987, Southern Gold Resources Ltd. conducted some geochemical and geophysical work in the 
Armagosa area as part of a broader exploration program focussed primarily on the Roché Déboulé 
prospect to the north.

In 2006 and 2007, Crucible Resources Ltd. optioned the property and conducted reconnaissance sampling 
which returned some anomalous gold, copper, and molybdenum values in the area.

In 2008, Duncastle Gold Corp. collected 10 rock samples in the area as part of a broader exploration 
program. Results returned anomalous gold, copper, and molybdenum.

6.1.3 Brunswick
The Brunswick prospect was initially staked by J. Miller in 1912. Miller explored and developed the 
property through to 1931, much of the time single handed.  The claims lapsed and were re-staked in 1950 
by Skeena Silver Mines Ltd. Work included reopening and extending the adits and tracing the vein with 
four diamond drill holes. The ground was staked again in the early 1960's by J.T. Williamson who 
completed additional drilling, prospecting and underground rehabilitation.

In 1972, Arcadia Explorations Ltd. optioned the property and recommended a drift extension program. 
Strong mineralization was confirmed in the upper adit while metal values in the lower adit were less 
economical. A ground-based EM geophysical survey centered on old workings found insufficient 
conductivity contrast to be of much use. However, a separate self-potential survey suggests the vein 
continues at least 150 feet upslope.

Robert Holland staked the area in 1984 and optioned it to Catoosea Resources Corp. in 1985. Two days 
were spent prospecting the area in 1986 and two new veins were discovered were not sampled.

In 2006, Crucible Resources Ltd. held an option covering the Brunswick showing and collected 1 sample 
from each of the old adits. The chip sample from the upper adit returned 48.1oz/t Ag, 3.9% Pb and 12.2% 
Zn.

Duncastle Gold Corp. held an option covering the Brunswick showing from 2010 – 2011, however besides 
an airborne geophysical survey, no other work has was recorded.

Mineralization in this area was first discovered in 1914 and saw intermittent work by prospectors up to 
1927 including some adits, drifting and trenching which exposed irregular veinlets containing lead, silver, 
arsenic and gold.

In 1979, Asarco Ltd. staked four contiguous claims in the area, part of which covers the current property. 
Their work through to 1985 focussed on geochemical sampling and geophysics of the nearby Killarney and 
Jones prospects without much attention paid to areas within the current claim boundary.

In 2007, Crucible Resources collected five stream sediment samples from this area as part of a larger 
reconnaissance program over their claims and to follow up on a previous government regional survey. 
The following year, Duncastle Gold Corp. collected a number of stream sediment samples as well as 10 
rock samples from the Brian Boru creek drainage, two of which returned 14.3% and 22.3% Zn. A broad 
zone of anomalous copper is also noted in stream sediment sampling in the upper parts of the Brian Boru 
creek drainage.

6.1.5 Tina
Reference is made to an unnamed molybdenum showing in this location in a 1969 compilation map, 
however further details of its discovery and history are unknown.

In 1982, Pharaoh Exploration Inc. owned the Schemo property in which the Tina showing is located. A 
desktop study was undertaken, but other than reference to some prospecting taking place, no other 
records specific to the Tina showing have been located.

In 2010, Duncastle Gold Corp. followed up an airborne geophysical survey by conducting reconnaissance 
in the area to the west of the Tina showing. Five representative samples but failed to return anomalous 
metal values.

6.1.6 Jupiter
Reference is made to an unnamed molybdenum and copper showing in this location in a 1969 compilation 
map, however further details of its discovery and history are unknown.

In 1982, Pharaoh Exploration Inc. owned the Schemo property in which the Jupiter showing is located. A 
desktop study was undertaken, but other than reference to some prospecting taking place, no other 
records specific to the Jupiter showing have been located.

In 2008, Duncastle Gold Corp. collected four samples near the Jupiter showing, one of which returned 
9.0% Zn and 115g/t Ag.

6.1.7 Big Thing
Reference is made to an unnamed molybdenum and copper showing in this location in a 1969 compilation 
map, however further details of its discovery and history are unknown.

In 2010, Duncastle Gold Corp. conducted reconnaissance in the area and collected 3 representative 
samples. Sample Mwpc10-02A returned weakly anomalous gold (0.207 g/t), zinc (0.1 %) and arsenic 
(0.3%). Follow up mapping and sampling was recommended in this area but was ranked as a low priority.

6.1.8 Red Rose
The Red Rose past producing mine is located within 14 crown grants owned by Freeport Resources Inc. 
The Crown grants are encompassed within the Cobalt Mountain property and therefore included in the 
history summary below.

The Red Rose occurrence was discovered and staked in 1912 by C. Peterson and C. Ek. Early development 
work included drifts, adits and some mining while optioned by the Skeena Development Company from 
1914 – 1916. 

A vein hosted tungsten showing was discovered in 1923 above the mine workings but no other work was 
reported until 1939 when The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. purchased the 
property. During 1940 – 1943, underground development and mining was carried out on the tungsten 
vein. A 25 ton-per-day mill constructed on site, processed 25,950 tons of ore during that time.

Between 1951 and 1954, Western Tungsten Copper Mines optioned the property and continued to 
develop the underground workings and mined 88,225 tons of ore. Total production for the mine was 
114,175 tons of ore which yielded 563 oz Au, 823 oz Ag, 59,708 lbs Cu, and 1,698 tons of tungsten 
concentrate. Operations were shut down due to difficulty to produce viable concentrate and reduced 
demand for the metal after WWII.

The upper extents of the orebody is interpreted to be largely mined out. The deposit remains open to 
depth and to the south where the ore body intersects a major diorite body. In 1955, Farwest Tungsten 
Copper Mines Ltd acquired all of the assets of Western Tungsten Copper Mines and sold all the machinery 
and equipment on the property.

Cominco (formerly The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd.) maintained 
ownership of the crown grants overlying the Red Rose mine site until 1987. At that time, Freeport 
Resources Inc. purchased 100% interest in the property and drilled two holes confirming mineralization 
below the 1100 level. Freeport also conducted a short survey which estimated approximately 5,000 tons 
of tailings at the mill site grading approximately 0.5-1.0% Cu, 0.05% Mo, and 0.02 oz/t Au. Freeport 
Resources Inc. is the current owner of the Red Rose Crown Grants.

In 2006, Crucible Resources Ltd. optioned property containing the Red Rose mine. One day was spent in 
the field area. Two rock samples and 1 tailings sample were collected.

No other work specific to this area has been filed since.

6.2 Mapping and Prospecting
Intermittent mapping and prospecting has taken place across the property since the early 1900's. The 
majority of the documented historical work consists of partial reports lacking exact sample location 
information, sampling methodology and analysis.

In 2007, Duncastle Gold Corp. conducted limited prospecting around the Armagosa showing collecting a 
total of seven samples which returned anomalous values for Au, Cu, and Mo.

In 2008, Duncastle Gold Corp. conducted a much broader prospecting program, collecting a total of 43 
samples from across the property. These samples were predominantly taken from talus and occasionally 
outcrop. Rock samples were dried, crushed, split and pulverized before being analyzed for gold by fire

The rock types encountered during this program consisted of volcanic rocks intruded by various phases of 
diorite, granodiorite and granite. Alongside the north-south oriented volcanic rocks, sediments composed 
of argillite, siltstone with minor conglomerate are mapped to the west. Mineralization and alteration was 
encountered throughout all rock types. Mineralogy and assemblages included chlorite, limonite, biotite, 
k-spar, magnetite, hematite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, malachite, molybdenum, 
native copper and abundant silicification. The mineralization was observed as quartz stringers, pods and 
disseminations. 

Duncastle Gold Corp. also conducted limited prospecting in 2010 over the Sultana, Tina West and Big 
Thing prospects. Historic drill core from Sultana was also collected and sampled. The most significant 
results all came from Sultana with one sample grading 18.2 g/t Au and 17.8% Cu, and another grading 
1.08% Mo. The results from the historic drill core also confirmed anomalous values for copper and 
molybdenum.

6.3 Rock Sampling and Trenching
Trenching on the property is limited to work completed in the 1920's and more recently in 1972.  This 
surface work occurred at the Brunswick and Sultana showings. In the case of the Brunswick showing, 
trenching took place to improve vein system geometry on surface before excavating underground to 
access the ore. Some open pits and shafts were also excavated in at the Brian Boru Prospect in the 1920's.

6.4 Soil Geochemistry
The most significant soil geochemistry program took place over the Sultana prospect in 2010. Duncastle 
Gold Corp. collected a total of 480 soil samples 5 to 10 metres apart along several lines 25 to 50 metres 
apart. The tight spacing was chosen due to the close spacing of pyrite and chalcopyrite bearing quartz 
veins observed across the showing.

The program covered an area of 250 m x 400 m and results were encouraging enough to warrant a follow 
up three-hole drill program. Average copper and molybdenum values for all samples collected were 
approximately six times higher than median concentrations at 168.3 ppm Cu and 22.86 ppm Mo. 
Maximum values of 3363.2 ppm Cu and 834.2 ppm Mo indicate significant mineralization at surface.

6.5 Geophysical Surveys
Localized geophysical surveys targeting specific occurrences are noted through to 1987 and no others 
occurred until 2010 when Duncastle Gold Corp. completed an airborne multi-sensor geophysical survey. 
Fugro Airborne Surveys completed 495 line km of helicopter-borne electromagnetic, magnetic and 
radiometric surveys in July 2010. This survey acquired data on a grid pattern of 200 m spaced east–west 
flight-lines controlled by 1,000 m spaced north–south tie lines. 

The 2010 airborne survey identified property-scale controlling structures and highlighted zones of 
pronounced potassium alteration. Known mineral occurrences were typically not coincident with any 
electromagnetic signature, but are associated with positive magnetic anomalies. Limited prospecting 
followed up the survey and additional groundwork was recommended.

A re-interpretation of the 2010 airborne geophysical survey was undertaken by Campbell & Walker 
Geophysics Ltd in early 2017. 

Re-interpretation of the 2010 airborne geophysical data included application of algorithms developed by 
the Center for Exploration Targeting at the University of Western Australia. Anomalous geophysical 
signatures on the Cobalt Mountain area have identified regions of structural complexity and the response 
of idealized porphyry mineralising systems within magnetic data sets. This study demonstrated that all 
mineral occurrences on the property are associated with the edges of interpreted anomalies and provides 
targets for future exploration work. A more detailed discussion of these results can be found in Section 9.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization
7.1 Regional geology
The Cobalt Mountain property is located within Intermontane tectonic province and underlain by rock 
assemblages of the allochthonous Stikine terrane (Figure 7.1). The Stikine volcanic arc terrane formed 
outboard of ancestral North America starting in the Late Paleozoic and was accreted initially to other 
allochthonous terranes; Quesnel and Cache Creek terranes, and then to the North American margin in the 
Middle Jurassic. Since then, the mosaic has been intruded by post accretion plutonic suites and covered 
in part by Jurassic and younger syn – and post accretionary siliclastic deposits.

7.1.1 The Stikine Terrane
The Stikine terrane generally trends northwest spanning over 1,500 km across the length of British 
Columbia and varies in width from over 300 km wide to less than 100 km. It is the largest terrane in BC 
among the most metallogenetically significant. The Philippine microplate with complex, opposite-facing 
arcs is considered a present day analog (Marsden and Thorkelson, 1992). 

The Stikine terrane is a complex volcanic arc assemblage built during three episodes of island arc 
formation between the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. Each is represented by an unconformity-
bounded volcanic-sedimentary sequence and coeval intrusive suite: 1) Devonian to Permian Stikine 
assemblage and Asitka Group and Forrest Kerr and More Creek plutons, (Logan et al. 2000; Gunning et al. 
2006); Middle to Upper Triassic Stuhini and Takla Groups and accompanying intrusions such as the 
Hotailuh and Hickman batholiths (Souther, 1977; Monger, 1977; Dostal et al. 1999); and Lower to Middle 
Jurassic Hazelton Group and related high-level intrusions such as the Texas Creek suite (Barresi et al., 
2015). Much of the porphyry related metal endowment is contained within sub-volcanic intrusive 
complexes related to the Stuhini and Hazelton Groups. 

7.1.2 Post Accretionary Stratigraphic Rocks
Middle – late Mesozoic Bowser Lake Group and Skeena Group rocks formed in syn -post accretionary 
basins and cover much of the north-central part of the Stikine terrane. The Bowser Lake Group 
sedimentary sequence spans the former basin between the Stikine Arch and Skeena Arch and consists of 
nine different sedimentary assemblages (Evanchick et al., 2001). 

7.1.3 Post Accretionary Intrusions
During late Mesozoic to Cenozoic time, intrusive rocks formed in an intracontinental setting, after the 
outboard host arc and related terranes accreted to the western margin of North America and accumulated 
siliclastic cover rocks. The intrusive rocks are interpreted to occur in continental back arc settings and 
individual deposits are generally hosted by older country rocks referred to above. Deposits are generally 
hosted within the Hazelton group and show a spectrum of metal associations and deposit styles; porphyry 
copper-molybdenum at the Huckleberry mine (currently on care and maintenance status); porphyry 
copper-gold at past producing Bell and Granisle mines; porphyry molybdenum at the past producing 
Kitsault and Endako mines. Precious and base metal vein deposits can occur peripheral to intrusive stocks. 

7.1.4 Structure and Folding
Braided sets of post-accretionary, northwest trending, strike-slip faults, transect the mosaic of terranes 
and set the overall structural grain of the Cordillera. Faults record mainly dextral displacement from mid 
Cretaceous to Eocene and with a cumulative offset up to 800 km (Gabrielse et al., 2006).

Figure 7.2 Geology legend for Figures 7.1 and 7.3.

The Skeena Arch is a northeast - southwest structural corridor which transects approximately the middle 
of the Stikine terrane. The Skeena Arch is the topographic highland which separates the Bowser basin 
sediments to the north and the Netchako plateau to the south. Faults in this area create a mesh-like map 
pattern which cross-cut the general northwest trend of the Cordillera with east-northeast trending host 
and graben faults. The Skeena Arch is endowed with over 800 known mineral occurrences detailed in the 
BC geological Survey's MINFILE database. 

The Cobalt Mountain property lies within the Cretaceous Skeena Fold Belt, a regional fold and thrust belt 
primarily expressed in thinly layered strata of the Bowser Lake Group sedimentary rocks. Folding and 
faulting from this NE-SW shortening deformation are less prevalent but are present within Stuhini and 
Hazelton strata.  The majority of fold and thrust faults trend northwest and accommodate northeasterly 
shortening during Cretaceous time.  Northeast trending folds in the domains on the western side of the 
fold belt have similar geometry and scale as northwest trending folds.  

7.2 Property Geology
Evanchick (2008) completed the most recent iteration of 1:125,000 scale geological mapping of the area 
and described it in the Geological Survey of Canada Open File 5704. The following rock unit descriptions 
are based from that report.

 The Cobalt Mountain property and greater Rocher Deboulé mountain range is underlain by three 
stratified assemblages each separated by an unconformity. From oldest to youngest, assemblages include: 
sedimentary rocks of the Upper Jurassic to Lowest Cretaceous Bowser Lake Group; sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks of the Lower Cretaceous Skeena Group and intracontinental arc volcanic rocks of the Upper 
Cretaceous Kasalka Group. Stratified rocks are cut by a Late Cretaceous intrusion of the Bulkley Plutonic 
Suite (Figure 7.3).

7.2.1 Bowser Lake Group
The Upper Jurassic to Lowest Jurassic Bowser Lake Group (BLG) sedimentary rocks are mapped mostly as 
undivided marine and non-marine sediments and dominate the western half of the Cobalt Mountain 
property. A small area in the south-central area of the property is identified as the Muskaboo Creek shelf 
facies Assemblage. Lithologies include sandstone, siltstone and conglomerate. Primary lithofacies is fine 
to medium grained sandstone, forming laterally continuous thin to thick-bedded sheets; less common are 
siltstone interbedded with sandstone; rare lenses of conglomerate; sandstone is green-brown and grey-
weathering, thin to thick-bedded, and locally arranged in coarsening upward cycles; includes burrows, 
bivalve coquina, and other marine fossils, common ripple marks and crossbedding and local hummocky 
cros-stratification. In the Rocher Deboule Range, the BLG may conformably overly Hazelton Group 
andesitic arc volcanic rocks and related sedimentary rocks. (Gagnon, 2010, Thorkelson et al., 1995; 
Richards, 1980, 1990). 

7.2.2 Skeena Group
The Lower Cretaceous Skeena Group is composed of three mapped formations (oldest to youngest): 
Bulkley Canyon, Rocky Ridge and Rocher Deboule Formations. On the Cobalt Mountain property, Skeena 
Group rocks are limited to the Rocher Deboule Formation mapped on the southwestern margin of the 
mineral claims. The lower contact of the Skeena group is rarely observed, where it is exposed, the contact 
is an angular unconformity with the underlying Hazelton or Bowser Lake Group sedimentary rocks. In 
general, the lower Skeena Group is fluvial-deltaic mudstone, siltstone and sandstone overlain by volcanic 
rocks of the Rocky Ridge Formation. (MacIntyre, 2000).

The Rocher Deboule Formation as defined by Bassett and Klienspehn (1996) is inclusive of the Red Rose 
Formation and Hanawald conglomerate segregated by Richards (1990). The unit is a fluvial –deltaic 
deposit of Albian to Cenomanian age. Lithologies include sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, tuff, 
conglomerate; common detrital muscovite and common reddish colours; sections commonly contain 
cycles fining upward from sandstone to siltstone and mudstone, locally with conglomerate at the base. 
Where thermally altered biotite hornfels are common. The upper stratigraphy of the Rocher Deboule 
Formation was identified by Richards (1990) and was called the Red Rose Fm. Some of the most significant 
past producing mines of the area are hosted within this upper stratigraphy of the Rocher Deboule 
Formation.

The Bulkley Canyon Formation is mapped approximately 5 km southwest of the property boundary. It is 
described to include feldspathic sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, coal and minor volcaniclastic 
conglomerate; sections commonly contain cycles fining upward from coarse-grained sandstone to 
carbonaceous siltstone, mudstone or coal.   

Just south of the property boundary, The Rocky Ridge Formation trends roughly east-west and includes 
porphyryitic and amygdaloidal basalt flows and intercalated volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks; phenocrysts 
of pyroxene, plagioclase, and hornblende; includes breccia, lapilli tuff, and volcanic debris flow 
conglomerate; 40Ar / 39Ar ages indicate 95-93 Ma. An older member of the Rocky Ridge Formation includes 
feldspar-pheric flow banded rhyolite to rhyodacite domes and interbedded dacitic volcanic rocks; includes 
lapilli tuff and flow breccia; U-Pb ages yielded 107.9 +/-0.2 Ma (Macintyre, 2000).

4840-0785-4434, v. 3

7.2.3 Kasalka Group
The Upper Cretaceous Kasalka Group is mapped on the southeastern portion of the property and 
unconformably overlies the Skeena Group. The Kalsalka Group is described to contain hornblende-
fledspar-porphyritic andesite-dacite flows, flow breccia, breccia; rhyolite to dacite flows and ash flow tuff, 
breccia; minor basalt and andesite fledspar porphyry, intercalated lacustrine, fluvial and tuffaceous 
sedimentary rocks, and volcanic debris-flow conglomerate; includes sills, dykes and intrusive domes.

7.2.4 Bulkley Plutonic Suite
The Late Cretaceous Bulkley Plutonic Suite cuts all of the stratified rocks described above and is mapped 
in the central and north-central areas of the Cobalt Mountain property. The intrusive body is less than 1 
km wide at the narrowest point in the southern areas versus over 5 km wide in the northern extent. The 
elongate stock trends north-northwest and measures over 15 km from north of Hagwilget Peak to the 
headwaters of Corya Creek and correlates roughly with resistive high topography along the length of the 
Rocher Deboulé mountain range. Intrusive phases include mainly granodiorite, lesser quartz monzonite, 
lesser quartz monzonite, quartz diorite, minor diorite and granite; ages yielded 85-61 Ma. The majority of 
mineral (MINFILE) occurrences occur proximal to the mapped contact of the intrusion. 

7.3 Mineralization and Structure
There are at least eight known MINFILE occurrences on the Cobalt Mountain property. Nineteen 
additional MINFILE occurrences are located in the surrounding Rocher Deboulé Range and vary from small 
showings to past producing underground mines. Mineralization style is primarily polymetallic base and 
precious metal veins and calc-alkalic porphyry copper +/- molybdenum +/- gold. Most mineral occurrences 
are hosted within or located proximal to the Rocher Deboulé stock. 

The Brian Boru showing (on the property) and nearby Killarney and Jones (not on the property) are the 
only MINFILE occurrences not proximal to a mapped intrusion but are likely intrusion related. 

Precious and base-metal vein systems on the property are commonly influenced by controlling faults. 
Regional scale north-northwest trending faults divide the Rocher Deboulé Range roughly into east and 
west domains. (Figure 7.1). The middle structure parallels the height of land along the western side of the 
mountain range and propagates through the past producing Red Rose mine. Here, a fault known as the 
Red Rose Shear hosts tungsten mineralization where the shear zone cuts a tongue of diorite atypical of 
the Rocher Deboulé stock. Northeast trending cross faults link the regional faults and match the fault –
mesh network observed across the Skeena Arch. Displacement on most faults are typically hundreds of 
meters (Warkentin, Young) 2001.

8 Deposit Types
8.1 Porphyry Exploration Model
The multiple polymetallic vein occurrences on the Cobalt Mountain Property could be part of a much 
larger hydrothermal system. Macdonald et al. summarize this exploration model in their 2011 report:

The conceptual target is a zoned porphyry mineral system (Figure 8.1) related to the intrusion 
of the Rocher Deboulé stock, a large composite intrusion of granodiorite to quartz monzonite 
composition. Mineral occurrences include "proximal" intrusion-hosted, bulk tonnage Cu-Mo 
deposits and "distal" polymetallic veins and shears within the adjacent country rocks. 

The following description of porphyry deposits is modified after Rodgers, 2010: "…fracture-
controlled quartz-sulphide veinlets and veins, and sulphide disseminations in fractures hosted 
by, or proximal to, high-level, calc-alkaline, intermediate to felsic, porphyritic intrusions. 
There may be a spatial and genetic relationship to high-level (epizonal), calc-alkaline, 
intermediate to felsic stocks, dykes, sills, and breccia pipes, with porphyritic phases, that are 
intrusive into volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These commonly occur as subvolcanic 
intrusions to volcanic complexes. The porphyritic intrusions and/or the surrounding country 
rocks may host the mineralization. Multiple intrusive phases and brecciation are common. 
Typical general associations are: quartz monzonite to alkali feldspar granite: Mo-W; 
granodiorite to quartz monzonite: Cu-Mo; and diorite-quartz diorite-tonalite: Cu-Au-(Mo)."

Individual mineral occurrences may be associated with smaller intrusive bodies and dykes 
either within or on the margins of the main stock. An example of this may be the Sultana 
prospect where airborne geophysics has identified an aeromagnetic high located on the 
eastern margin of the stock. The magnetic high is surrounded by an arcuate magnetic low. 
This magnetic low may be caused by the destruction of primary magnetite in the host rock 
by hydrothermal fluids mobilized by the heat of intrusion. Sulphide mineralization is localized 
within the altered area around the barren core.

9 Exploration
9.1 2017 Field Program
Between August 31st and September 1st, 2017 Timothy Johnson and a small crew of samplers visited the 
Sultana area in the southeast part of the property. Two contoured soil sample lines were taken consisting 
of 95 samples. These soils expanded on the initial 2014 and 2016 soil grid. 14 rock samples were collected 
along the soil traverses with sampling prioritizing an area that was covered by snow in the 2016 field 
program.

On September 22nd and September 26th 2017, Lorie Farrell of Farrell Exploration Services Inc. and Tom 
Bell of Eagle Eye Ventures visited the Red Rose Creek area in the northwest of the property. This ridge 
airborne EM and magnetic target was prospected and mapped with 18 rock grab samples taken. Results 
included sample 126205 that contained 715 ppm Cu and 3.49 ppm Ag in a feldspar porphyry float with 
quartz/calcite veining and associated chlorite alteration, pyrite and pyrrhotite.

9.2 Geophysical Interpretation
A helicopter-borne electromagnetic, magnetic and radiometric survey was originally flown by Fugro 
Airborne Surveys in July 2010; this survey comprised 495 line-kilometres of data acquired on a grid pattern 
of 200 m spaced east–west traverses controlled by 1,000 m spaced north–south tie lines. A re-
interpretation of the 2010 airborne geophysical survey was undertaken by Campbell & Walker Geophysics 
Ltd in early 2017.  The following text, figures and associated interpretations are taken from the assessment 
report (Campbell 2017):

Subsequent to the original airborne geophysical interpretation, the magnetic component of 
the survey data was re-evaluated utilizing three new approaches consisting of structural 
analysis, an analysis searching for possible porphyry –type character, and a 3D inversion of 
the magnetics.

The former two approaches utilized technology from the Centre for Exploration Targeting at 
the University of Western Australia. The first of these is a 'grid analysis' that automatically 
maps lineaments and identifies geological structural complexity. The method yields two 
scenarios of structural complexity detection, contact occurrence density (Figure 9.1) and 
orientation entropy (Figure 9.2).

The second is an automated image analysis system for gridded data that in principle at least, 
may provide an accurate and non-subjective way to identify the magnetic response of an 
idealized porphyry mineralizing system. The method finds circular anomalies that are 
associated with the central intrusion and inner alteration zone of the porphyry system using 
a circular feature detection method called the circular feature transform. Then their 
boundaries are approximated by deformable splines that are drawn to the locations of 
maximum contrast between the amplitudes of the central 'high' and surrounding area of 
lower magnetisation (Figure 9.3).

The aeromagnetic data was also inverted using Geosoft's 'VOXI' earth modeling software, 
which generates 3D voxel models from airborne or ground gravity and magnetic data, leading 
directly to a solid earth representation of the magnetic susceptibility distribution (Figure 9.4). 
The inversions were run 'unconstrained' by the limited drilling information available, or by 
representative surface magnetic susceptibility data; should these be made available at some 
point in the future, then the inversion should be re-run with geological and/or geophysical 
constraints for better fit.

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis, and Security
Prior to 2006, the most recent work on the property occurred in 1987 and as such, the procedures used 
for preparation, analysis and security cannot be relied upon. The author conducted a site visit to the 
property with the goal of confirming the presence of mineralization (Figure 11.1). The procedures used 
for the most recent programs are given below.

11.1 2006 and 2007 Programs
The 2006 and 2007 programs focussed primarily on prospecting the Brunswick and Armagosa showings. 
Rock and stream sediment samples were collected and the procedure used is given below from Warkentin 
(2007):

All rock samples were dried, crushed, split and pulverized before being analyzed for gold by 
fire assay and for a 34 element scan by ICP-AES following an aqua regia digestion. In 
addition, 4 talus rock samples collected in the Armagosa Creek area were submitted for a 
repeat assay by ICP-AES following a multi-acid digestion to check for possible refractory 
mineral values.

Stream sediment samples were dried and screened at 80 mesh and the fine fraction was 
analyzed for gold by fire assay and for a 34 element scan by ICP-AES with aqua regia 
digestion

11.2 2008 Program
The 2008 program focussed on property scale reconnaissance with the aim of identifying prospective 
areas for future exploration work. The procedure followed for this program is given below from Warkentin 
(2008):

Rock samples were dried, crushed, split and pulverized before being analyzed for gold by fire 
assay and for a 34 element scan by ICP-AES following an aqua regia digestion. 

Stream sediment samples were dried and screened at 80 mesh and the fine fraction was 
analyzed for gold by fire assay and for a 34 element scan by ICP-AES with aqua regia digestion. 

Soil samples were dried and screened at 35 mesh and the fine fraction was analyzed for gold 
by fire assay and for a 34 element scan by ICP-AES with aqua regia digestion.

11.3 2010 Program
The 2010 program focussed primarily on the soil sampling of a grid over the Sultana prospect. The 
procedure followed for this program is given below from Macdonald et al (2011):

An assay package of 32 elements applied by the 1DX15 procedure was used for soil samples. 
Samples were dried and screened at 80 mesh. Splits of 0.5g are leached in hot (95°C) Aqua 
Regia followed by ICP-MS analysis. Sample minimum size is 1g pulp.

Analytical package GEO-2 was used for assaying drill core and rock samples, including 36 
elements Group 1DX (Aqua Regia/ICP-MS 0.5g) + Group 3B (fire geochem Au). A gravimetric 
finish was applied for gold samples over 10g/t and silver samples over 200g/t. Also, for 
copper samples >1% and molybdenum samples >0.4%, a 7TD analysis was conducted, where 
the sample was dissolved in four acid solution and the percentage determined by ICP-ES. A

standard, blank, or duplicate was inserted every 20 samples. The standard was CDN CM-2 
from CDN Resource Laboratories, and landscape quartzite was used as blank.

For a total of 465 samples, eight blanks, nine standards and seven duplicates were inserted. 
The duplicates were prepared using quarter splits of the core interval concerned. All of the 
blanks passed and the duplicates contained similar numbers. The standard used was analysed 
for Au, Cu and Mo. The Au assays were all within limits. The copper values were erratic and 
the molybdenum values were all well below the expected values. This can be explained by 
the fact that aqua regia digestion was used, which has incomplete digestion of molybdenum 
and possibly copper as well, although not to the same extent. It is recommended that next 
year, the QA/QC ratio be increased to 1 in every 10 samples - ideally a blank and a standard 
or duplicate for every 20 samples - and that four acid digestion is used instead of aqua regia, 
to get more accurate base metal assays.

11.4 2018 Site Visit
A total of three samples were collected by the author during the 2018 site visit. Sample locations were 
recorded using a hand held gps, the location was marked with flagging tape in the field and each sample 
was assigned a unique sample ID. The samples were collected in individual poly sample bags (Figure 11.1) 
and packaged for shipping to Acme Analytical in Vancouver, BC.

12 Data Verification
The site visit on March 6, 2018, was done with intent to visit known mineralized zones and, if possible, 
take samples to verify the existence of copper, gold, silver, zinc and cobalt mineralization.  A total of three 
samples were collected from outcrop and subcrop near the Brunswick Minfile location. The samples 
confirm the presence of mineralization. Best efforts were made to collect representative samples though 
snow cover obscured most bedrock exposure.

13 Adjacent Properties
The Cobalt Mountain Property is location within the Hazelton Mountain Range of central British Columbia 
which is endowed with a variety of metals and styles of mineralization. Production has taken place from 
four small mines immediately to the north of the current property boundary. The author has been unable 
to verify the accuracy of the information regarding past production, nor is past production on adjacent 
properties indicative of the mineral potential on the Cobalt Mountain property.

The Rocher Deboulé mine is the most significant past producer having been mined from 1915 – 1918, as 
well as 1929 and 1952. A summary of this production is given in Table 13.1 below. The deposit consists of 
four veins striking 75 degrees and dipping 55 degrees north into the mountain. All production to date has 
come from the No. 2 and No. 4 veins.

Table 13.1 Past production from the Rocher Deboulé Mine (Annual Report 1952).

Approximately 1.5 km east of the No. 4 vein are the two Highland Boy veins, one of which can be traced 
back to the No. 4 vein along the surface. Some development work and mining was completed in 1917 and 
yielded 4,770 kilograms of copper, 124.4 grams of gold and 1,088 grams of silver (Annual Report, Minister 
of Mines, B.C.: 1917). Drilling in 2007 totalled 1,106 m in six holes and was followed up by focussed 
groundwork around the veins in 2011.

The Victoria veins are located 1.5 km northwest of the Rocher Deboulé mine. Approximately 90 tons of 
ore was shipped between 1918 and 1941 which produced approximately 326 oz of gold, 44,560 lbs of 
arsenic, 2,100 lbs of molybdenum, and 4,900 lbs of cobalt. Some drilling was conducted on the veins in 
1981 and 1983, but most holes were not assayed or analysed.

The Cap mine is approximately 4 km west of the property boundary. It has seen a similar exploration 
history to the other mines and shipped 26 tons of ore in 1917 which produced 93 grams of gold, 7,838 
grams of silver and 1,513 kilograms of copper.

15 Interpretation and Conclusions
The Cobalt Mountain project area and greater Rocher Deboulé Range has produced substantial amounts 
of copper, gold and cobalt. The property remains prospective for extensions to some known high-grade 
precious metal deposits and for a porphyry style deposit. 

All of the past producing mines are precious and base metal bearing quartz +/- carbonate veins and occur 
proximal to the mapped contact of the Rocher Deboulé stock. The veins are likely related to the stock and 
exploit earlier fault networks and in some cases concentrate at fault intersections. Although past 
production of some of the vein deposits was successful, present metal prices and concentrations are 
generally sub-economic. However, it is possible that a high-grade vein hosted deposit of economic 
concentration could exist on the property. 

It is possible that vein hosted metals may have been scavenged and remobilized from the country rocks 
during contact metamorphism with the stock. To address this, sulphur isotopes could be used to 
differentiate crustal from magmatic sulphur sources. Results would help understand how much crustal 
contamination has occurred from the country rocks and confirm the degree of influence from the 
intrusion on sulphide mineralization. 

Porphyry-style mineralization is most prospective exploration model for the Cobalt Mountain property. 
The Rocher Deboulé stock is part of the Cretaceous Bulkley Plutonic suite which is known to host other 
porphyry copper-gold-silver-molybdenum deposits in the vicinity such as the Huckleberry mine. At 
Huckleberry, the bulk of the deposit is hosted in the hornfelsed volcanic rocks proximal to a granodiorite 
stock. At Cobalt Mountain, polymetallic veins likely represent distil fluids of the Rocher Deboulé stock and 
may be connected to a metal bearing intrusive phase. The stock is comprised of several phases of 
intermediate intrusive rocks, most of which are not mineralized. However, different phases of intrusive 
rocks remain to be comprehensively studied and mapped. A copper-molybdenum bearing phase of the 
intrusion was identified in drilling, surface sampling and soil geochemistry during the 2010 work program 
around the Sultana area. These results form a baseline set of mineralogical, geochemical and geophysical 
characteristics to expand on the area of interest at Sultana and identify new zones throughout the rest of 
the Rocher Deboulé stock.

16 Recommendations
Further evaluation of the Cobalt Mountain Property is recommended given the grassroots nature of the 
property, known mineralization, prospective interpretation of historic geophysics and anomalous historic 
results. Recommendations include:

 Detailed lithological, structural and alteration mapping at 1:10,000 scale
 Prospect areas which have been recently exposed from permanent snow cover or receding glacial 

ice
 Follow up of anomalies identified in the airborne survey to be trenched and/or drill tested
