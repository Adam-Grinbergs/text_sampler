Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec

1. Summary

The Hawk Ridge Project is an advanced exploration property located in the 
Labrador Trough of northern Quebec. The objective of this Technical Report is to 
describe the work performed to date on the property and to recommend a 
follow-up program. The Hawk Ridge Property will act as a Qualifying transaction 
for Orient Venture Capital to earn a 100% interest in the Hawk Ridge Property by 
making staged payments of $2 million and transferring $1 million in shares to 
Virginia Energy Resources Inc., the current owner of the property. 

The Hawk Ridge Property is composed of 429 mineral claims that cover an area of 
18,703 ha on a strike length of 44 km and a width of 3 km. Excess assessment 
credits of $2.7 million are available.  

The Hawk Ridge Property is on the west coast of Ungava Bay, 135 km northwest 
of Kuujjuaq and immediately south of Aupaluk. Access to the property is by 
aircraft from Kuujjuaq or by skidoo and all-terrain vehicle from Aupaluk. Kuujjuaq 
can provide basic food and services but heavy equipment must be brought in by 
barge from Montreal to Aupaluk which is usually available from mid-June to mid-
October. Daily jet aircraft service is available from Montreal to Kuujjuaq. 

A previous operator left machinery and equipment on the property which has 
now been removed. There are no environmental liabilities on the property. 
Provincial parks are proposed immediately east and west of the project area and 
the Inuit of Aupaluk and Tasiujaq own surface and mineral rights to nearby areas.  

The climate is subarctic to arctic. Outcrop exposure is 80% in most of the region. 

The Hawk Ridge Property has been the object of exploration since the early 1960s 
when nickel and copper mineralization were discovered at the Pio Lake Zone. 
Considerable drilling and property development work culminated in a small 
mining operation that extracted several thousand tonnes of massive sulphides 
from an adit and three surface pits. The operation was abandoned in 1974. 

Most of the project area has been explored and several companies have carried 
out geological mapping, sampling and diamond drilling in certain areas. 

The Hawk Ridge Property is underlain by rocks of the northern Labrador Trough, 
of Proterozoic age that unconformably overlie the Archean Superior Province to 
the west. The rocks of the Labrador Trough are composed of a thick sequence of 
marine sedimentary and mafic volcanic rocks that were intruded by sills and 
dykes of mafic and ultramafic composition. All rocks have been thrust west onto 
the Superior Craton and now dip steeply to the east. 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 2 

The most recent exploration activity was in the period 1995-1997 when an 
airborne magnetic and EM survey was carried out over the property, followed by 
15,763 m of drilling in 117 holes. All data is available in digital format. 

Of 29 copper, nickel and platinum group mineral occurrences identified to date 
on the property four are significant. 

The Pio Lake Zone contains two mineralized lenses that dip steeply to the east. 
An adit and four raises were extended into the mineralization 1973-74. The West 
lens has been interpreted as being of magmatic origin and reported values of 
0.34% Cu and 0.75% Ni to 6.08% Cu, 1.43% Ni in a vein 2 m wide and 46 m long in 
sulphides that appear to be of magmatic origin. The East Lens reported grades of 
1.28% Cu and 0.04% Ni to 6.9% Cu and 0.3% Ni in a vein that may be of 
hydrothermal origin. 

The Gamma Zone contains grades of 0.98% Cu and 0.11% Ni to 0.4.56% Cu and 
1.44% Ni in magmatic sulphides at the contact between porphyritic gabbro in 
contact with graphitic schist. Disseminated sulphides in the gabbro reported 
average grades of 0.52% Cu and 0.19% Ni from several drill holes. 

The Hopes Advance Main Zone contains disseminated sulphides and a historical 
resource estimate was reported with an average grade of 0.51% Cu and 0.18% Ni 
over a strike length of 800 m and a width of 30 m. 

The Hopes Advance North Zone contains massive sulphides of magmatic and 
hydrothermal origin in addition to disseminated sulphides associated in a highly 
folded section that contains porphyritic gabbro, schist and peridotite over a strike 
length of at least 250 m. The massive sulphides reported grades of 0.86% Cu and 
0.59% Ni to 4.80% Cu and 2.30% Ni. In drill holes 250 m to the south along the 
same structure massive sulphides reported 1.87% Cu and 0.74% Ni to 2.45% Cu 
and 3.39% Ni, associated with disseminated sulphides of 0.50% Cu and 0.19% Ni 
to 0.68% Cu and 0.19% Ni. 

A program of diamond drilling at the Hopes Advance Main Zone is recommended 
to better define the mineralization already identified. A new high-resolution 
airborne magnetic and time-domain electromagnetic survey should be carried 
out over the property to better define the current zones of mineralization and 
potential new zones that can be identified at greater depth. Additional drill hole 
data from historical reports should be integrated into the database with new GPS 
data.

A second phase of drilling should be prioritized depending on the results from the 
geophysical survey and the results of the first drilling campaign. 

A budget of $2.45 million is proposed to carry both phases of this program.

2. Introduction

Michael Cathro, Vice-President of Exploration of Virginia Energy Resources Inc. 
and Min Kuang, Chief Executive Officer of Orient Venture Capital Inc. contracted 
Daniel Beauchamp, P.Geol. to write this Technical Report. Both companies are 
based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and are listed on the TSX Venture 
Exchange. 

The objective of the report is to review the work carried out on the Hawk Ridge 
Property and to recommend a suitable exploration program in order for Orient 
Venture Capital Inc. to acquire a 100% interest in the property from Virginia 
Energy Resources Inc.  

The report was prepared after a review of assessment reports by previous 
exploration companies in the area, of internal company reports, of government 
data and of current exploration activity in the region. This report includes a 
proposed exploration program and budget to further evaluate the mineral 
potential of the property.  

Assessment reports on the Hawk Ridge property and in the surrounding area that 
are available from the files of Virginia Energy and from the Quebec's Ministère 
des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune (MRNF) were consulted. Other public 
documents, information and geological reports were included in the study and 
some additional data was made available by personnel associated with Virginia 
Energy. 

As a Qualified Person, the author of this report has worked in mineral exploration 
throughout Canada for more than 30 years. In addition to other areas in Canada, 
the author has worked as a geologist in the Canadian Shield exploring in the 
Northwest Territories and Nunavut, in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and 
Quebec. This work has included managing programs including geological 
mapping, geochemical and geophysical surveys, diamond drilling, core logging, 
and advanced evaluation and development of properties for many commodities.  



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 5 

This Technical Report is prepared in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 
(NI 43-101), regulations published by Canadian Securities Administrators. 

The author was on site at the time of the last important drilling campaign on the 
property from June 27th to 30th, 1997 and a return field visit to the property was 
carried out on November 10th 2011. The author also carried out studies and 
interpreted much of the geological data on the property from 1997 to 2003.  

 3. Reliance on other experts

This Technical Report contains information obtained from government 
documents, company reports, public documents and other technical reports. The 
assessment reports are historic in nature and were not written by qualified 
persons. The pertinent information has been reviewed by the author and 
although there do not appear to be significant discrepancies among the reports 
the author has not verified the assays or other technical data from these reports 
by carrying out independent sampling. 

Data on claim ownership, work credits and cash available for reimbursement for 
the claims was accessed online on April 23rd 2011 on the Quebec Government 
web site. Data on cost estimates were provided by operators in the area in an 
informal way and by personnel at Virginia Mines. 

Fraser Milner Casgrain Law has confirmed that 662707 Alberta Ltd. is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Virginia Energy Resources Inc. 

Information on the historical resource estimate at the Hopes Advance Main Zone 
was taken from Paul (1997) and should not be relied upon because it was not 
made by a qualified person and does not conform to NI 43-101 requirements. It is 
not treated as current mineral resours or reserves. 

Data on the environmental condition and rehabilitation of the camp sites on the 
Hawk Ridge property was provided by a report from the Kativik Regional 
Administration (2011). This data is believed to be reliable but the facts presented 
and the potential environmental responsibilities of the claim owners should be 
confirmed with government authorities.

4. Property description and location

Location 

The Hawk Ridge Project is located in northern Quebec, about 1550 km north- 
northeast of Montreal on the west coast of Ungava Bay (Figure 1). The project is 
in Nunavik Territory, an area that represents about the northern third of Quebec 
and is the traditional homeland of the Inuit in the province where they hold 
certain ancestral rights and the mineral rights to certain lands. The total 
population of Nunavik Territory is about 12,000 residents. The majority of the 
residents of Kuujjuaq are Inuit. Many Inuit also live in 14 communities, nearly all 
of which are located along the coast of Hudson Bay on the west, Hudson Straight 
to the north and Ungava Bay to the east. All islands in Ungava Bay and Hudson 
Bay are part of Nunavut. 

The project is located at longitude 69° 38' 30"W, latitude 59° 00' 00"N in NTS 
(National Topographic System) 24K/14, 24N/03 and 24N/06. 

The closest community to the Hawk Ridge Project is Aupaluk, located at the north 
end of the project area and along the coast of Ungava Bay where about 175 
residents live. Basic port facilities are present at Aupaluk where regular shipping 
to and from Montreal is available from about late June to late November. 
Oceanic Iron Ore, a mineral exploration company, is currently evaluating an iron 
orebody that would establish major port facilities on the north shore of Hopes 
Advance Bay at Aupaluk.  

Tasiujaq is another small community located south of the project area on the 
south shore of Leaf Bay. The community has a landing strip and a population of 
about 250 residents.

Located about 135 km southeast of the project area, Kuujjuaq is the largest Inuit 
community in Quebec and, as the administrative centre of Nunavik, is the home 
of 2300 residents. In previous campaigns Kuujjuaq was the main supply centre for 
the Hawk Ridge Project where food, basic supplies, float planes and helicopter air 
transport can be obtained. Maritime shipping is also available from Montreal to 
Kuujjuaq. 

Agreement

The purpose of this report is to assess the work performed on the Hawk Ridge 
Property and to recommend an exploration program so that Orient Venture 
Capital Inc. can acquire a 100% interest in the property from Virginia Energy 
Resources Inc. Upon approval of the report the property will constitute Orient 
Venture Capital's Qualifying Transaction as part of the regulations on Capital Pool 
Companies by the TSX Venture Exchange. 

Under terms of a Letter of Intent, Orient Venture Capital (OVC) can earn a 100% 
interest in the Hawk Ridge property, subject to the current underlying royalty 
interests, by making staged payments totalling $2 million in cash and $1 million in 
shares of Orient Venture Capital stock by December 31, 2013. The agreement 
calls for an initial payment of $500,000 in cash and $250,000 of Orient Venture 
Capital shares within five days of exchange approval of the qualifying transaction. 
As part of the agreement Orient Venture Capital is required to raise additional 
funds and to maintain the property in good standing. 

Daniel B. Larkin, the original owner of a number of claims on the property, owns 
a net smelter return (NSR) interest of 3% on the production of "bullion, 
concentrates or ores" from the area outlined by the original exploration permit 
that was acquired in 1995 over the property (see Figure 2). The agreement with 
Mr. Larkin gives the company the right to acquire the first percentage point for 
$1 million and the first right of refusal to buy another percent of the NSR.

Mining regulations

In Quebec, claims can be staked online or in government offices and there is no
longer any need for physical posts on the ground. In northern Quebec all claims
are defined by latitude and longitude and cover an area of about 44 ha, except
where the claims are truncated by restricted areas, in which case they are
smaller.

Once accepted and approved, the government mails out a registration receipt to
the owner, usually within 60 days of staking, but ownership of the claims should
not be presumed before receiving the receipt.

Claims are initially valid for two years and are renewed in two year periods.
Assessment work and a rental fee are required to renew the claims. The
registration and renewal fee for claims is dependent on the area of the claim (see
Table 1). The assessment work required varies depending on the area of the
claim and on the renewal period of the claim. Cash in lieu can be paid to the
government if for some reason part or all of the work required has not been
completed before renewal (see Table 2). Assessment work can also be shared
from claim to claim if other claims owned by the same company that are within a
radius of 4.5 km have excess credits.

For example to renew a claim of 44 ha in northern Quebec that is in its third 
renewal period, i.e. that was staked six years ago, the holder must pay renewal 
fees of $98, if received 60 days prior to the renewal date, and have performed 
$800 of work on the claim. If the renewal forms and fees are received by the 
government within 60 days prior to the renewal date of the claim the renewal 
fees double to $196. Cash in lieu can be paid for the assessment work if required. 
The assessment report must also have been received prior to 60 days before the 
renewal date or a fee of $100 will be charged. If the claims are not renewed by 
the renewal date the claims are forfeited, along with any accumulated 
assessment work and the company cannot renew the claims for 30 days. 

The renewal fees usually increase regularly on April 1st by the rate of inflation. A 
provincial legal bill is currently being debated in the National Assembly of the 
Quebec Government that would change several rules when renewing claims, 
including a reduction to 4.0 km of the radius for sharing credits among claims, 
there would be a maximum time limit to applying the credits available on claims 
and certain fees and requirements would increase.

Property description Hawk Ridge Project

The Hawk Ridge Property comprises 429 mineral claims for a total area of 
18,700.4 ha and the claims extend over a strike length of 43 km from north to 
south. The claims are held 100% by Virginia Energy Resources Inc. and by 662707 
Alberta Ltd., a company wholly-owned by Virginia Energy (see Figure 2).  

A summary of the claim holdings is presented in Table 3 and several details of 
each claim are listed in Appendix 1. 

 

The renewal schedule for the 241 claims owned 662707 Alberta Ltd. ranges from 
30 April to 29 July 2013 when exploration work with a value of $436,290 must be 
drawn down from the $2,729,861 of total available credits. Most of these credits 
were accumulated at the time of diamond drilling from the period 1995-1997. 
The assessment work required for each claim is high because the claims are in 
their 4th to 11th two-year term of renewal. A renewal fee of $23,121 must be 
paid if submitted before the 60th day prior to renewal, about 28 February 2013, 
otherwise the fee will double to $46,242. 

The 184 claims currently owned by Virginia Energy are in their first two-year term 
and consequently the assessment work required is $21,936, or cash in lieu must 
be paid, along with a renewal fee of $17,890. The fee would double to $35,780 if 
paid after about 3 September 2012. The renewal date for these claims is from 3 
November 2012 to 25 March 2014.

Virginia Energy currently has no assessment credit on its current claims and even 
though the claims owned by 662707 Alberta are beneficially owned by Virginia 
Energy the excess credits available on the claims held by 662707 Alberta Ltd. 
cannot be used to renew those held by Virginia Energy because the registered 
owner is different. The claims could be transferred by 662707 Alberta to Virginia 
Energy after paying a transfer fee. 

Four of the claims covering 167.8 ha and that were staked in late January 2012 by 
Virginia Energy overlap part of the Category 1 lands owned by the Tasiujaq Inuit 
at the south end of the Hawk Ridge Project area. These claims have not yet been 
granted by the Quebec government and are pending approval. There is no 
guarantee that they will be granted. If granted the claims will have a renewal 
date two years from the approval date and assessment work with a value of $480 
and a renewal fee of $392 will be required, unless the assessment required and 
fees are changed. 

Mining restrictions

Three types of restrictions to staking and mining activity are present near the 
Hawk Ridge Property. To the east and southwest of the Hawk Ridge Project 
mineral exploration is prohibited because the Baie-aux-Feuilles (Leaf Bay) 
provincial park that has been proposed over these areas (Figure 2). Claims cannot 
be staked in these areas and exploration programs would not be approved. 

In a belt trending northeast near the north part of area and on either side of the 
Hawk Ridge Project exploration is permitted under specific conditions on 
Category I Lands, owned by the Inuit in the Aupaluk area since 24 November 
1988. The mineral rights are owned by the Inuit and an agreement is required 
with them for any work to be carried out on these lands. There is some overlap in 
the areas of the proposed park and Category I lands, particularly in the area to 
the northeast of the Hawk Ridge Project. 

Another area of Category I lands is located in the Tasiujaq area south of the Hawk 
Ridge Project area. This area also overlaps with the proposed Baie-aux-Feuilles 
Park.

Environmental regulations

Falconbridge Ltd. and its partners carried out significant exploration programs in 
the area and later ran a mining operation at Lac Pio from 1961 to 1974. The 
company extended an adit and drifts at Pio Lake (see Figure 2), several of which 
were opened to surface where they can be seen as pits. 

When the company abruptly abandoned the mining site in the area in 1974 it left 
a significant amount of industrial waste, equipment, explosives and many fuel 
drums on the site. 

When Troymin Resources, a predecessor company to Virginia Energy, acquired an 
exploration permit over the property in late 1995 it contracted an environmental 
review of the Pio Lake area and recognized the potential safety risk of the 
explosives present in the area. It contracted for the Sureté du Québec (SQ), the 
provincial police force, to access the property in early 1996 and to destroy all 
explosive material in the area and to secure the site. 

As a follow-up to a study completed in 2002 by Kativik Regional Administration, a 
local administrative agency in northern Quebec, of 193 sites examined in all of 
Nunavik the Lac Pio site was determined to be one of the mining sites in greatest 
need for rehabilitation. In 2007 several mining companies based in Quebec 
funded a project to clean up many of these sites. Over a three-week period in 
December 2009, 20 trips were made to move 15 large pieces of heavy equipment 
including a crane, tractor, crusher, generator motors etc. to Aupaluk along a 
temporary winter road on the tundra.  

In 2010 additional cleanup work was completed on the site. Some of the material 
has now been shipped south to Montreal for disposal and several of the larger 
pieces were left in Aupaluk. As part of the rehabilitation program a total of 43.5 
tonnes of metal and 440 kg of aluminium have been shipped south for recycling.  

Ten additional trips were made from Lac Pio to Aupaluk in 2011 to remove other 
equipment. At the request of the community of Aupaluk the trailer was left on

site so that it could be used as a shelter in case of emergency during the winter 
(Administration régionale Kativik, 2011).  

Although the report quotes a water pH reading of 6.9, indicating that no acid rock 
drainage issues are present the soils nevertheless indicate readings of copper, 
nickel and iron that are higher than those acceptable. The total area of 
contaminated soils at Pio Lake has been estimated at 115 m2. 

Another site at the south end of Lac Laliberté has been identified as a site 
requiring an intermediate level of rehabilitation (see Figure 2). Although this site 
is on the Hawk Ridge Property this is not one that was used by Virginia Energy or 
by its predecessor companies. The site is recent and has many barrels of fuel, 
several of which are full, has burnt aluminium metal, propane tanks and old beds. 

In the field site inspection carried out in November 2011, a quick inventory of the 
company's 1996-1997 camp site on the east shore of Lac Déry revealed the core 
from the 1996-1997 drilling campaign is neatly cross-stacked and accounted for. 
The site is relatively clean and other than the core, an old wooden shack and one 
empty barrel are still on the site. 

There are no other known or reported land improvements, mine workings or 
tailings ponds on the Hawk Ridge property. The property is otherwise free of liens 
or pending legal actions, back-in rights, payments or other encumbrances. There 
are no other known existing environmental liabilities to which the property is 
subject.  

Owners of mineral claim do not have the rights to surficial materials such as sand 
or gravel. Virginia Energy is required to request permits from the provincial 
government and the Nunavik Government to establish camps and for the use of 
surficial materials. The company would be further required to request 
permissions from Inuit communities if trails or roads were required to ferry 
equipment onto the property. 

In 2002 the Government of Quebec gave the responsibility for management 
activities and services, and for the protection and enhancement of the parks

proposed in Nunavik to the Kativik Regional Government (KRG). The provincial 
park for Baie-aux-Feuilles was proposed at least 15 years ago. If mineral 
development or a mining operation were to be proposed on the Hawk Ridge 
property additional negotiations would be required with the Kativik Regional 
Government to mitigate any potential damage to the proposed park area. 

Since the project is located between two sections of land that are proposed as a 
park and near land that is owned by the Inuit in the region there is a risk that any 
exploration or development of the property could be delayed or prevented by 
the interests of the local population or by non-governmental organizations.  

There is also a risk of expropriation. Further south in the Otish Mountains of 
central Quebec the provincial government recently expropriated claims owned by 
companies that could not produce a mineral resource to NI-43-101 standards 
within five years of the announcement of a proposed park in this area. 

The property is at an advanced stage of exploration and the exploration permits 
that are required to operate field programs are available to the company from 
the Kativik Regional Administration, Quebec's Ministère des Ressources 
naturelles et de la Faune, and from the Ministère du Développement durable, de 
l'Environnement et des Parcs. As of the date of writing this report Virginia Energy 
has not received these permits. 

5. Accessibility, climate, physiography, local resources and infrastructure

Accessibility

Access from Montreal to Kuujjuaq is by daily scheduled aircraft by Air Inuit and 
First Air. Air Inuit also flies between several other Inuit communities including 
Aupaluk and Kuujjuaq. 

In 1975 a group of Inuit moved to Aupaluk mostly from Kangirsuk, about 80 km to 
the north, to re-establish the community where their ancestors had lived several 
generations earlier. 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 17 

The nearest road access is 380 km south of Kuujjuaq where the Trans-Taiga gravel 
road that extends from Radisson east for 666 km following the electric generating 
stations operated by Hydro-Québec along the La Grande River and Caniapiscau 
River, part of the James Bay Project. A railway from Sept-Iles was constructed to 
the north to service the iron mines in the Schefferville area, about 370 km south 
of Kuujjuaq (Figure 1). In 2011 some proposals were made that would extend the 
Trans-Taiga Road north to Kuujjuaq as part of the "Plan Nord", a new program for 
the development of the north part of the province proposed by the Quebec 
government in late fall 2011. 

Climate and physiography

The Hawk Ridge Project is located near the boundary between the Taiga Shield 
and the Southern Arctic ecozones where broadly rolling hills are interspersed by 
many lakes. At the Hawk Ridge Project the climate of the region is Arctic to 
Subarctic with cold winters and short cool summers. Precipitation is light and 
generally concentrated in the warmer months. The average yearly mean 
temperature for Kuujjuaq and Aupaluk is -6°. Additional climate data for Kuujjuaq 
and Aupaluk are shown in Table 4.  

Geographically the property is located in the Arctic and is many kilometres north 
of the tree line. There is little soil development on the property. The vegetation is 
represented mostly by minor grass and sedges in low-lying swampy areas with 
occasional dwarf shrubs. The area has very good outcrop exposure with little 
overburden (Figure 3).  

Wildlife reported include caribou, arctic fox, black bears, wolves and occasional 
polar bears near the coast. Muskoxen were introduced in Nunavik initially in 1973 
and their numbers have grown significantly since that time.

Local Resources and infrastructure

With a population of about 2300, Kuujjuaq is the regional centre for the area and 
hosts a helicopter and fixed wing base. Fixed wing landing strips are present at 
Kuujjuaq, Aupaluk and Tasiujak. The airport at Kuujjuaq can accommodate jet 
aircraft including Boeing 737. 

Basic food, supplies and equipment can be obtained from Kuujjuaq and the town 
could be the source for unskilled and semi-skilled labour. The Lac Déry site was 
used as a camp site where float planes ferried equipment and personnel from 
Kuujjuaq.

Major equipment and supplies such as fuel and machinery must be shipped from 
Montreal to Aupaluk. Nunavut Enterprise Arctic Shipping Inc., a business owned 
and operated by Inuit, operates a shipping service from Montreal to coastal 
communities in the Arctic including Kuujjuaq and Aupaluk. The shipping season to 
Aupaluk is usually open from mid to late June until late November, depending on 
the weather.

Operating environment

The usual operating season in the field extends from early June to late October. 
Lakes are usually clear of ice starting from the middle of June. A short winter 
drilling campaign was completed in early December 1995 but the low light 
conditions and cold weather at this northern latitude at this time make such 
programs very unproductive.  

Basic electrical power is available in Aupaluk but additional facilities to generate 
electricity would be required if a mining operation were proposed. These would 
probably be diesel generators.  

The project area is located at least 50 m above sea level and several lakes are 
available for a source of water on the property. The area has little vegetation and 
there are several small valleys and open areas on the current property that could 
be used for possible waste disposal or heap leach areas if a mining operation 
were approved. 

A deep sea port has been planned on the north shore of Hopes Advance Bay for a 
proposed iron mining operation 20-50 km west of Aupaluk. 

A limited number of unskilled and semi-skilled people could be hired in Aupaluk 
and a somewhat greater labour force is available in Kuujjuaq. Any other skilled 
personnel must be hired from the more populated areas of the south of province.

6. History

The Hawk Ridge Project area is underlain by rocks of middle Paleoproterozoic age 
of the northern Labrador Trough that include basal units of dolomite, marine 
siltstone, shale, greywacke, conglomerate and chert breccia that have been 
overlain by a thick sequence of pillow basalt and intruded by mafic pyroclastic 
rocks that include gabbro sills of mafic and ultramafic composition. The sequence 
was thrust to the west onto the Archean Craton into a sequence that generally 
dips steeply to the east.  

Property History 

Claims and exploration permits have been owned on the Hawk Ridge property 
since about 1961 when the Sogemines-Falconbridge-Lone Star joint venture 
worked the Pio Lake area. As documented by the assessment reports submitted 
on the property, following is a list of the claim owners on the project and the 
years on which work was performed on the property (see Figure 4):

Work History 

Much of the information presented below is from company data and assessment 
reports that have been submitted to the Quebec government for the years 1961-
2010 (see Table 5 and Figure 5). Over the past 50 years this part of the Labrador 
Trough has been the object of mineral exploration for iron and for nickel-copper 
mineralization. 

In his field work in the region in 1894 A.P. Low reported the presence of iron in 
sedimentary rocks in the area west of Aupaluk and of Hopes Advance Bay.  

From a historic perspective in the 1930s Murray Watts was one of the first 
prospectors to venture in the Ungava Trough located about 350 km to the north. 
To the south of the Hawk Ridge Project in the Labrador Trough activities were 
concentrated on exploring for sedimentary iron in the period 1929-1970 which 
also resulted in the discovery of many base metal occurrences. Several phases of 
exploration for nickel-copper and PGEs followed.

In the Hawk Ridge area the earliest recorded rock sampling along on the north 
and south shores of Leaf Bay dates from 1936 but results of analyses are not 
available.  

In 1951 Fenimore Iron Mines reported six lines of an aeromagnetic survey flown 
in a north-south direction immediately north of Leaf Bay and 13 km southwest of 
the Hawk Ridge Property. From 1952 to 1954 the company carried out additional 
prospecting and mapping at the base of the Labrador Trough sedimentary 
sequence northwest, west and southwest of the Hawk Ridge Project where it 
identified iron formation. Fenimore Iron Mines held a special permit of 950 km2 
north of Leaf Bay area and about 21 km west of Hawk Ridge where it made a 
historical resource estimate for sedimentary iron mineralization. 

In 1955 Atlantic Iron Ores Limited was incorporated by Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian 
financier of the early 20th century, to explore the exploration permits covering 
400 km2 over the sedimentary iron occurrences west of Aupaluk where about $20 
million were reported spent on exploration (Denis, 1955).  

In 1955 Fenimore Iron Mines also carried out prospecting and mapping on claims 
in the south extension of the Hawk Ridge Project near Leaf Bay where they 
reported the presence of sulphide zones in sedimentary and volcanic rocks. 

In 1957 Atlantic Iron Ores reported a historical resource estimate of sedimentary 
iron (Auger, 1957). This estimate is not compliant with NI 43-101 regulations and 
is not located on the Hawk Ridge Project. There is no assurance that this type of 
mineralization can be found on the Hawk Ridge Project.  

In 1958 Ungava Iron Mines drilled an additional 1131.6 m in 16 drill holes on its 
Ford Lake property west of Hopes Advance Bay. Starting in the same year the 
government undertook several geological mapping programs at a scale of 
1:63,360 of the area covered by the Hawk Ridge Project and south of the Leaf Bay 
area that covers part of the southern extension of the Hawk Ridge Project 
(Freedman and Philpotts, 1958; Bérard, 1959; Gold, 1962). They reported the 
presence of a thick sequence of dolomite, quartzite, and iron formation that

Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec

unconformably overlies the Archean granitic basement. Gabbro sills, volcanic 
flows and amphibolite cover the sedimentary package.  

Common rusty zones and gossans contain disseminated pyrite were reported 
from black shale that weathers purple. Pyrite, pyrrhotite with minor chalcopyrite 
and pentlandite were reported from the base of gabbro sills that are to 8 m wide 
at what is now known as the Hopes Advance Main Zone, north of Lambda Lake 
where one sample reported 1% Cu and 0.25% Ni. Units of sillimanite schist and 
metavolcanic rocks were reported to be intruded by ultramafic rocks, 
amphibolite and gabbro. 

In 1961 in a project between Falconbridge, Lone Star Mining and Sogemines 
Development Company Ltd., a private investment company sponsored by Société 
Générale de Belgique that later became Genstar, reported carrying out 39 
vertical drill holes of 3.7 m at 3 m intervals for a total of 147 m in three fences 
60 m apart and in three trenches 24-40 m long along Hopes Advance Main Zone. 
Pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite were reported from "blotchy gabbro" in a 
zone 1950 m long and 23m wide. The entire core was submitted for analysis but 
assays were not reported. The gabbro-peridotite sequence is folded in a syncline 
that plunges 30-40° to the south. At Hopes Advance North the company 
completed 39 shallow angled drill holes for a total of 210 m and five trenches. 
Results of assays are not available (Sogemines Development Company Limited, 
1961). 

In a geological report rusty zones and gossans were reported as being common. 
These usually represent disseminated sulphides, mostly pyrite, in black shale that 
weathers deep purple (Gold, 1962). At the site of Hopes Advance Main Zone, 
Gold quoted a 1957 report by Ungava Iron Ores Company:  

  



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 28 

"Less common but perhaps more promising are the mineralized 
zones near the base of gabbro sills. These contain disseminated 
pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite … The gabbro is 
100 feet thick and overlies a rusty zone of black shale that dips 70° 
east. A sample from material assayed 0.25 per cent nickel and 1 per 
cent copper. At the north end of this zone a shear zone separates 
the gabbro from the overlying lava. A 2-inch vein of massive 
sulphides exposed in a section perpendicular to the trend of the 
structure and traced for only 6 inches, assayed 5.24 per cent nickel 
and 2.90 per cent copper." 

In 1962 a pilot plant was established by Oceanic Iron Mines to determine the 
potential beneficiation of the sedimentary iron at Hopes Advance Bay to the west 
of the Hawk Ridge Project where flotation and spiral tests were carried out in an 
Aerofall mill. 

In 1962 Sogemines carried on with its program at Hopes Advance Main where it 
performed 15 drill holes for a total of 2332 m. The company performed 
additional trenching, magnetic and electromagnetic surveys and reported two 
holes for a total of 561 m in the showing. Two trenches assayed an average of 
0.64% Cu and 0.17% Ni over 34 m and 0.52% Cu, and an average of 0.16% Ni over 
21.3 m but assay results from the drilling were not reported (Sogemines 
Development Company Limited, 1962). 

An airborne electromagnetic survey was reportedly flown by Selco explorations 
Inc. over part of the Hawk Ridge Project in 1963 but this data is unavailable 
(Larkin, 1971). 

In 1971 Imperial Oil, through its subsidiary Esso Minerals Canada, carried out 
317 km of ground electromagnetic surveys, 235 km of magnetometer surveys 
and collected 3005 soil samples over most of the north part of Hawk Ridge 
Project but not on the Pio Lake Claims, to which they didn't have the mineral 
rights. The company recommended that 28 targets be further explored by 
trenching, geochemistry and diamond drilling (Larkin, 1971). From three trenches 
the company reported 0.83% Cu and 0.21% Ni over 1.7 m and drilled 35 holes for 
a total of 1098 m mostly north and south of the east arm of Lambda Lake in the 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec

northern part of the property where assays of 0.76% Cu and 0.38% Ni over 2.3 m, 
and 1.0% Cu and 0.38% Ni over 3.3 m were reported from ultramafic rocks 
(Mayman, 1971). 

In the same year Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. and Premium Iron Ores Ltd. 
performed a ground magnetometer and VLF-EM survey in the Pio Lake area and 
followed the program with 27 drill holes for a total of 1550 m (Caron, Dufour, 
Séguin, 1971).  

Two parallel veins of massive sulphide mineralization were identified in the 
drilling in andesite. They are about 15 m apart striking 340° and dipping steeply 
to the east. The East Lens is 61 m long, 2.1 m wide and plunges 30°N to at least 
61 m. Average values are 5.75% Cu and 0.31% Ni. The West Lens has an average 
width of 0.6-1.0 m and reported average grades of 2.83% Cu and 3.20% Ni. It is 
61 m long at surface and decreases to 30 m at a depth of 43 m. 

A cross vein was also identified at 15 m long by 1.2 m wide and averages 10% Cu 
and 1% Ni. The main flat vein is at a depth of about 15 m, has a length of at least 
61 m, a width of 8-15 m and reported an average grade of 7.3% Cu and 3.46% Ni 
(Caron, Dufour, Séguin, 1971).. 

The mineralization was described as being related to a network of three fractures 
patterns at right angles to each other. 

In areas south of Pio Lake Falconbridge reported zones of mineralization in a sill 
of peridotite 60×150 m and in "blotchy" (glomeroporphyritic) gabbro contain 
very uniform finely-disseminated copper-nickel sulphide mineralization. The 
reported grade in the gabbro averages 0.80% Cu and 0.25% Ni, but one trench 
across the gabbro reported an average value of 1.02% Cu and 0.30% Ni over 
10 m. The gabbro has a strike length of 450 m and a surface width of 10-24 m.  

Other mineralization identified in the nose of a syncline at the Fold Zone on the 
east shore of a lake consists of disseminated pyrrhotite and pentlandite in a sill of 
peridotite near the contact with basalt. The zone is 1-1.5 m wide and a grab

sample reported 1.3% Ni. Disseminated mineralization is also present over a 
strike length of 500 m. 

In 1972 Lone Star Mining contracted an airborne EM (electromagnetic), 
magnetometer and radiometric survey over areas to the west and southwest of 
the Hawk Ridge Property in the search for iron ore. The strong magnetic readings 
were recorded from the ultramafic rocks and low radiometric readings were 
recorded over the area. The number of EM conductors was overwhelming and 
most were determined to be formational (Stemp, 1972) 

In 1973 Falconbridge carried out a detailed geological mapping survey of the Pio 
Lake area (Manchuk, 1973). The company also contracted a ground EM and 
magnetometer survey over the Pio Lake area where three zones were identified. 
The first two zones of interest are parallel, strike northeast and show coincident 
magnetic and conductive sections, probably representing sulphide mineralization 
within mafic rocks. The two zones have a total length of 600 m and a width of 
30 m. They merge to the southwest but appear to have been faulted to the north 
by a fault that may strike north or north-northwest. The third zone is at the north 
end of the property and shows conductive responses and magnetic anomalies 
that strike north and have been faulted (Bergmann, 1973a). 

Additional chalcopyrite and pentlandite mineralization was identified in the 
selvages in pillow basalt over a strike length of 300 m and a width of 10 m. Grab 
samples reported trace-10% Cu and trace-2.39% Ni. 

As a follow-up to the airborne survey, in 1973 Falconbridge performed a ground 
magnetic and EM (electromagnetic) survey over a grid northeast of Hopes 
Advance 6 and identified three conductive and magnetic zones that may 
represent sulphide mineralization associated with gabbro (Bergmann, 1973a). 
Several other grids were surveyed in the Pio Lake area where strong conductors 
that pinch and swell strike northwest and dip 60-85°E. The conductors are 1-30 m 
wide and represent peridotite but the strong magnetic component is represented 
by pyrrhotite (Bergmann, 1973b).

At Pio Lake an adit 2.5×3 m was driven to a length of 113 m to reach the veins 
about 17 m below surface. The veins were exploited by four raises, three of 
which broke to surface. In 1973 about 4200 tonnes of sulphides were mined from 
both veins and another 1200 tonnes were mined from surface by open pit (Lone 
Star Mining, 1974). 

In 1973 in the East Vein the mineralization was 2980 tonnes mined remaining 
was estimated at 7260 tonnes grading an average of 6.9% Cu and 0.3% Ni. In the 
West Vein 2450 tonnes were mined and 9662 tonnes of mineralization grading an 
average of 6.6% Cu and 3.2% Ni remained. This historical resource estimate is for 
a small zone of mineralization on the Hawk Ridge Property but the calculation is 
not compliant with NI-43-101 regulations and should not be relied upon. A 
qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical resource 
estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Additional drilling 
would be required to make a new estimate of resources. The historical resource 
estimate is not being treated as current mineral resources or reserves.  

The mineralization was thought to be probably of hydrothermal origin and it may 
have replaced a barren bed of sedimentary pyrite and pyrrhotite. The 
mineralization may have been remobilized from a glomeroporphyritic gabbro at 
depth. Mineralization may have also filled fractures. 

Lone Star drilled 48 holes for a total of 3041 m on the project area. The company 
reported that drilling shows that the mineralization does not extend further along 
strike or at depth. 

The company also contracted Lakefield Research of Canada to perform a study on 
the recovery of copper and nickel from Pio Lake to determine to determine the 
amount of nickel, copper and iron that could be dissolved from leach solutions. 
The study was from a sample that assayed 12.54% Cu, 2.70% Ni, 0.107% Co, 
0.05% Zn, 47.2% Fe, 33.8% S and 1-2% C. A follow-up study estimated the costs of 
treating the mineralization for the production of metallic copper, nickel and a 
concentrate of precious metals. (Barker, 1973).

In 1973 Lone Star performed a total of 49 drill holes for 3011 m in the Pio Lake 
area. Several other zones of mineralization were identified including a 
glomeroporphyritic gabbro located about 300 m southwest of the Pio Lake Zone 
that reported 0.8-1.0% Cu and 0.2-0.3% Ni over a strike length of 450 m and is cut 
off by faults at both ends. 

In the Pillow Lava Zone erratic mineralization over 23 m × 300 m where eight drill 
holes testing one conductor in the area revealed massive but barren pyrite-
pyrrhotite and where the other conductor showed copper-nickel mineralization 
of 0.89% Cu and 0.38% Ni over 6.5 m in a style similar to the glomeroporphyritic 
gabbro. Other assays in the area are in the range of 0.11-0.80% Cu and 0.01-
0.35% Ni. 

At the south end of Pio Lake a peridotite sill contains nickel-copper mineralization 
and was recommended for drilling. This showing is not located on the Hawk 
Ridge Property. At the contact zone of a peridotite sill near the nose of the 
syncline copper-nickel mineralization was reported. A magnetic and EM survey 
was recommended with follow-up drilling. 

In 1973-1974 mechanical equipment was mobilized to the property including 
trailers, boats, diamond drills and concentrators along with spare parts, fuel, food 
and supplies. 

In 1974 the adit was to be extended by another 80 m and the company planned 
to ship a bulk sample of mineralization and concentrate for processing at a pilot 
scale. The mining would cut slabs of sulphides be used as anodes in the direct 
electrolysis to recover copper and nickel. The remaining mineralization be 
crushed, ground and concentrated so that it could be leached by solvent 
extraction and used for electrolyte in the electro-winning process. 

In 1974 Lone Star Mining dug nine trenches and performed a ground 
magnetometer survey near the Schindler Zone on the ground held by 
Falconbridge/Genstar. Most of the magnetic anomalies are subdued but the 
trenching confirmed the presence of high-grade copper and nickel mineralization

over a strike length of 30 m with values of 0.15% Cu and 0.1% Ni to 7.72% Cu and 
1.99% Ni. 

In that year a pilot plant including crushing, grinding, screening and concentration 
facilities capable of 20 tons per hour was set up at Pio Lake. The central part of 
the permit at the Schindler showing was mapped and 16 drill holes were 
completed for a total of 1586 m.  

The project was abandoned in haste by Falconbridge toward the end of the 1974 
season and most of the equipment was left on site. No explanation can be found 
in the reports and records to explain the rapid exit or for abandoning the 
property. No further reports were submitted. 

Further north in the area in 1979 Esso Minerals Canada acquired the Hopes 
Advance 1 claims from Ross Thoms, claims that had been worked in 1961-62 by 
Falconbridge and in 1973-74 by Lone Star Mining. This added to Esso's other 
holdings in the area under joint venture with Spooner Oils (Boyd and Wilson, 
1979).  

In the Hopes Advance North area Esso carried out geological mapping, ground 
EM (electromagnetic) and magnetometer surveys, three trenches, three shallow 
and two deep drill holes, and reported on mapping and prospecting. The EM 
response over this showing extends over a strike length of at least 800 m and the 
mineralization itself was sampled over a strike length of 300 m. At least five 
conductive zones identified by the EM survey were reported as being related to 
pyrite-rich schist.  

Geological mapping, magnetometer and EM surveys were completed on the 
Hopes Advance 5 grid located west of Lac Laliberté. In the 1960s trenching and 
drilling had reported grades of 0.4% Cu and 0.1% Ni. The showing is 184 m long in 
a vein or lens of massive pyrrhotite that contains 2-3% chalcopyrite. 
Disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite are exposed in glomeroporphyritic basalt 
over a strike length of 915 m and a width of 2 to 43 m.

In 1982 Daniel Larkin staked ten claims over the Hopes Advance Main and Hopes 
Advance North Zones and carried out a magnetometer survey over part of the 
claims in 1983 (Larkin, 1984). 

In 1986 La Fosse Platinum Group Inc., a mineral exploration company, collected 
45 rock samples from Pio Lake and reported the presence of differentiated sills of 
ultramafic rocks that may show textures of multiple injections. The sulphides are 
fine-grained pyrrhotite, pyrite and nickel-rich pyrrhotite. Although most of the 
sills reported values below the detection limit for platinum and palladium, the 
base and top of the sills contain <15-75 ppb Pd and <5-415 ppb Au. In the 
epigenetic massive sulphide mineralization the analyses reported <15-90 ppb Pd 
and 5-574 ppb Au. Additional work was recommended (Lemery, 1986). 

In 1987 Riverton Resources Corporation acquired an exploration permit of 75 km2 
over the Pio Lake area. The company carried out a detailed geological survey at 
1:10,000 and submitted 750 rock samples for gold, platinum, palladium and for a 
suite of 40 elements. Three areas reported anomalous values of more than 
100 ppb for each of gold, platinum and palladium (Leduc, 1987). 

At Pio Lake the average values from old core were reported as 0.04 g/t Au, 
0.12 g/t Pt and 0.55 g/t Pd with maximum values of 3 g/t Pt and 1.9 g/t Pd.  

At Schindler samples from glomeroporphyritic gabbro sills consistently show 
values of <0.1 g/t Au, 0.1 g/t Pt and 0.1-0.3 g/t Pd and values for the massive 
sulphides were reported as <0.1 g/t Au, 0.15 g/t Pt and 0.5-1.5 g/t Pd. One 
sample containing more than 2% Cu and 0.06% Ni reported 12 g/t Au and 
another sample reported 1.6 g/t Au with 0.8% Cu and 0.03% Ni. 

In 1988 Daniel Larkin carried out additional prospecting and analyzed 332 soil 
samples for platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold on his claims at Hopes 
Advance Main zone. The soil in this area is poorly developed and some of the 
material collected may include rock chips from bedrock (Larkin, 1989). 

In late 1992 Phelps Dodge acquired an exploration permit covering 50 km2 over 
the Hopes Advance 5, 6 and 7 areas and followed through with a brief program of

prospecting and rock sampling to determine if they were prospective for PGEs 
(Johnson, 1992). A summary of the samples results reported are presented in 
Table 6. 

 

In 1992 Daniel Larkin held 11 claims on the Pio Lake mineralized zone and 
proposed a development process whereby the zone could be brought into 
production. Work carried out on samples from the Pio Lake Zone by CANMET, 
based in Ottawa, suggested that grinding and magnetic separation of the 
sulphides to produce separate copper and nickel concentrates was the preferred 
processing method because of the limited tonnage. Direct shipping of the 
mineralization also considered (Larkin, 1992). 

In late 1995 Troymin Resources Ltd., of Calgary AB, and International Butec 
Industries Corp., of Vancouver BC, optioned the claims from Daniel B. Larkin and 
acquired a large exploration permit that encompassed most of the known 
occurrences in the region, including the Pio Lake Zone and the Schindler Zone 
extending north to Hopes Advance Main and Hopes Advance North.  

An evaluation report by a consulting firm recommended the compilation of all 
data, followed by an airborne EM (electromagnetic) and magnetic survey over 
the permit, to produce conductivity, resistivity, magnetic and vertical gradient 
maps of the property. Follow-up work in 1996 would consist of ground 
geophysical surveys, geological mapping and trenching, and 3000 m of diamond 
drilling (Clark and Wares, 1995). A follow-up report completed in early 1996

documented much of the existing work on the property and recommended the
same approach (Hawkins, 1996).

In the period 1995 1997 Troymin Resources drilled 117 holes on the Mineral
Exploration permit for a total of 15,765 m (Table 7, Figure 6).

In December 1995 the Troymin Butec joint venture carried out a drilling program
of four short holes for a total of 198 m on the Pio Lake Zone to confirm the
presence of copper nickel mineralization on the site.

At Pio Lake the East Lens reported 1.28% Cu, 0.15% Ni and 7.9 g/t Ag over 1.98 m, 
not true thickness,  in a fault zone of sericitized basalt that contains disseminated 
sulfides. Including disseminated and massive mineralization this interval averages 
1.28% Cu and 0.04% Ni over 14.6 m, not true thickness.  

The West Lens reported 0.34% Cu and 0.75% Ni to 6.08% Cu, 1.43% Ni in 
chloritized basalt that contains disseminated and stockwork sulphides cut by 
quartz veins. The section including disseminated and massive mineralization 
averages 1.97% Cu and 0.43% Ni over 12.7 m, not true thickness. The style of 
mineralization, Cu:Ni ratios and the PGE contents of the East and West lenses 
may indicate that they have different origins. Wares (1996) suggested that 
mineralization in the East Lens is sediment-hosted and may be of volcanogenic 
origin. In contrast the West Lens is hosted by chloritized basalt and may be 
indicative of injection of sulphide liquids in the host supracrustal sequence similar 
to the nickel-copper deposits of the Noril'sk-Talnakh region of Russia. 

In early 1996 Troymin Resources contracted High-Sense Geophysics to run 1785 
line- kilometres of helicopter-borne magnetic and electromagnetic survey on the 
Hawk Ridge Property over an area of 192 km2 at an average line spacing of 100 m 
on the mineral exploration permit that it had acquired. The data from the survey 
was processed by a geophysicist and this work formed the basis for the follow-up 
drilling program of 1996 and 1997.  

The exploration permit area extended over a strike length of 40 km and had a 
width of about 10 km. The magnetic data revealed several fault zones and thin 
units of iron formation along the western boundary of the exploration permit.  

Prominent magnetic features that do not contain an electromagnetic response 
were interpreted as peridotite and graphitic and pyritic schist were identified as 
thin horizons with good conductivity. Since the Pio Lake Zone does not have 
extremely high electrical conductivities, the report recommended not to base 
follow-up work solely on conductor strength. A total of 26 conductors were 
recommended for follow-up, three of which are at the Pio Lake Zone.

In 1996 Troymin carried out geological mapping of the property at a scale of 
1:10,000 and detailed mapping at a scale of 1:1000 was performed over the 
Hopes Advance North and the Schindler areas. The geological survey identified 
the main units and mapped many porphyritic gabbro and peridotite bodies.  

Prospecting and rock sampling was also carried out. A total of 503 rock samples 
were collected from the entire property, of which 338 were analyzed for copper, 
nickel, zinc, cobalt and gold. Although quality assurance or quality control such as 
assay standards, blanks or duplicates were not used to verify the accuracy or 
reliability of the laboratory, since the laboratory was well-established the results 
are judged to be acceptable. 

Ground magnetic and EM surveys covered 96.9 km on 15 small grids. Deep-EM 
surveys were also carried out over the Hopes Advance North, Schindler and Pio 
grids, and down-hole Pulse EM surveys were performed in two holes at Gamma. 
The results of the ground surveys confirmed the data from the airborne survey 
and allowed the drilling to be more targeted more precisely. 

The zone of mineralization at Hopes Advance North was extended and the down-
dip continuity was confirmed at Hopes Advance Main. The work discovered the 
Gamma Zone that contains high grade massive sulphides in the Upper Iron 
Formation at the base of porphyritic gabbro. The zone was drilled to a down-dip 
depth of 230 m (Wares and Mungall, 1997). 

In 1997 the Troymin-Butec joint venture performed additional geophysical 
surveys and diamond drilling on the property. The drilling was carried out on five 
targets and included 15 drill holes for a total of 2390 m. The ground magnetic and 
HLEM surveys and geological mapping were performed on ten targets and two 
Pulse EM surveys were completed in two drill holes at the Fold showing (Mungall 
and Wares, 1997). 

Detailed ground magnetic and EM geophysical surveys and geological mapping 
were performed on 10 targets. Pulse EM surveys were also carried out in two drill 
holes on the Fold grid.

Five targets were drilled at the Hopes Advance North, Gamma and Schindler 
zones to extend known zones of massive sulphides. Fifteen holes were drilled for 
a total of 2690 m. The drill program extended the mineralization the massive 
sulphides at depth at Gamma, and discovered a high grade massive sulphide zone 
at the south end of the Hopes Advance North grid. The Gamma zone remains 
open at depth and the new massive sulphide zone at Hopes Advance remains 
open along strike (Mungall and Wares, 1997). 

In late 1997 Troymin contracted a preliminary resource calculation on the Hopes 
Advance Main Zone (Paul, 1997). The mineralization occurs in a porphyritic 
gabbro body that dips 40°E and outcrops over an area 30 m wide and 800 m long. 
The zone of mineralization has been intersected by two holes drilled in 1962 and 
15 holes drilled in 1996-97.  

The resource calculation was made using assay data from 14 drill holes from the 
1996-1997 drilling campaign and from incomplete data in two holes drilled in 
1962 and provided a to a depth of about 500 m (table 8).  

 

The study reported on three scenarios for open pit operations at 8,000 and 
10,000 tonnes per day and on four scenarios of underground mining at 8,000 
tonnes per day.   

A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical resource 
estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The calculations were 
not made by a qualified person and additional drilling would be required to make 
a new estimate of resources. The historical resource estimate is not being treated 
as current mineral resources or reserves. The economic projections are invalid

because many of the assumptions were not based on factual data, they are based 
on outdated economic parameters and are no longer acceptable.  

The historical estimates of reserves calculated by Paul are not being treated as 
current mineral reserves. A more recent resource calculation has not been 
prepared on the Hopes Advance Main Zone.  

In 1999 a study was carried out by the Centre de recherche minérale, in Quebec 
City, to determine if it was possible to concentrate the nickel and copper 
sulphides from the Hopes Advance Main Zone by performing drop tests on core 
and rock samples. The results were mostly inconclusive and gave only a slight 
increase in copper and nickel assays from the concentrate. Further grinding tests 
were recommended to more effectively separate the clinozoisite fragments from 
the sulphides (Centre de recherche minérale, 1999). 

In 2000 a Bachelor of Applied Science thesis from the University of Toronto 
studied rock samples from Hopes Advance North and calculated an average 
temperature of formation of 367° ±100° and pressure of 5.77 kbar from garnet 
and biotite pairs (Berhe, 2000). 

By 2001 Troymin Resources now owned 100% of the Hawk Ridge property and 
contracted J. Mungall, now of the University of Toronto, to carry out a program 
to evaluate the potential for platinum group elements (PGEs) at Hopes Advance 
North and to analyze core from previous drill holes for PGEs.  

Among other conclusions it was determined that the anomalous values of PGEs in 
soils reported in previous years at Hopes Advance North are related to glacial 
dispersal of known mineralization from sulphide-rich boulders. The composition 
of disseminated copper and nickel mineralization at Hopes Advance Main Zone is 
indistinguishable from that at Hopes Advance North Zone. Palladium grades are 
locally as high as 10 g/t at the Fold-Bay showings. The Pingo showing is very 
similar to other gabbro-hosted disseminated sulphide occurrences and is near a 
ferropicrite (Mungall, 2002). Ferropicrite is olivine-bearing basalt that contains 
more than 15% Fe2O3.

In 2001 Daniel A. Beauchamp prepared a report that documented the available
data on platinum group elements on the Hawk Ridge property. The report
described the known occurrences at Hopes Advance North and Main Zones, at
Gamma and Schindler and at Pio Lake where values of 100 1000 ppb Pt and Pd
are common, with values of 1000 4000 Pd with massive sulphides from core and
surface grab samples. None of the high values has received adequate exploration
(Beauchamp, 2001).

In May 2003 Troymin Resources merged with Santoy Resources Ltd. and the
company continued under the name Santoy Resources Ltd. In 2003 Daniel A.
Beauchamp carried out and additional summary report for Santoy on the Hawk
Ridge Property (Beauchamp, 2003).

In about 2004 Santoy carried out a brief sampling program on the Hawk Ridge
Property but little of this information is available.

In July 2009 Santoy Resources merged with Virginia Uranium Ltd. to form Virginia
Energy Resources Inc. The Hawk Ridge Property is now owned by Virginia
Resources.

7. Geological setting and mineralization

Regional geology

The Hawk Ridge project area is located along the New Quebec Orogen at the
contact between the Superior and Churchill Provinces of the Canadian Shield of
northern Quebec. The Superior Province, of Archean age, forms the cratonic
basement of much of northeast North America and has been deeply eroded
(Figure 7). Recent regional mapping by many provincial and federal agencies
shows that in the Superior Province of northern Quebec is composed of a series
of smaller continental and oceanic plates or subprovinces that were accreted
about 2.68 2.72 Ga (Figure 8). The subprovinces contain granitic and gneissic
terrains that are often separated by relatively thin but elongated sequences of
volcano sedimentary rocks. Many of these areas are being currently explored by
several companies.



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 43 

The basement rocks of the Canadian Shield west of the Hawk Ridge Project are 
represented by rocks of Archean age that are composed of several types of 
biotite amphibole gneiss that have been intruded by plutons and batholiths of 
medium to large size that contain medium-grained to coarse-grained pink granite 
and granodiorite (Figure 9).  

Bodies of mafic and ultramafic composition are present in the gneiss and 
represent volcanic and intrusive rocks. Diabase dykes of Proterozoic age have 
intruded the basement rocks. Late dykes of pegmatite and aplite are also locally 
present. These basement Archean and Proterozoic rocks outcrop 5-20 km to the 
west of the project area but are not present on the Hawk Ridge property. Age 
dates from zircons from granodiorite west of Leaf Bay have revealed a date of 
crystallization of 2721 +5/-3 Ma. 

In northern Quebec the rocks of the Superior Province are unconformably 
overlain by supracrustal rocks of Paleoproterozoic age. These include the Ungava 
Trough to the north of Superior Province that were emplaced during the Ungava 
Orogeny and the Labrador Trough to the east that were emplaced during the 
New Quebec Orogeny. The cover sequences of the Ungava Trough and the 
Labrador Trough, and parts of the underlying basement of the Superior Craton 
were deformed and metamorphosed as a result of the collision at the time of the 
Ungava Orogeny and New Quebec Orogenies. 

To the east of the project area the Southeast Churchill Province, also called the 
Rae Subprovince, is composed of and Paleoproterozoic (~1.8 Ga) and reworked 
Archean rocks (Ryan, 2000).

Following is the sequence of development of the Labrador Trough in the Hawk 
Ridge region: 

1. 2.2 Ga: initial rifting and start of deposition of Cycle 1 rocks 

2. 2.17 to 2.14 Ga: deposition of passive margin sediments including most of 
Cycle 1 rocks. 

3. 2.06 Ga: deposition of Abner dolomite of Cycle 2 on a re-established 
platform. 

4. 1.88 to 1.87 Ga (Cycle 2): platform and basin sedimentation associated 
with a new episode of rifting or the development of a foredeep basin; 
mafic volcanism of MORB-type (Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt), creation of 
continental- transitional oceanic crust; intrusion of mafic and ultramafic 
sills. Most of the rocks underlying the Hawk Ridge Project rocks were 
emplaced during Cycle 2. 

5. From 1.84 to 1.83 Ga: deformation and high-grade metamorphism in the 
hinterland near Kuujjuaq.  

6. From 1.82 to 1.77 Ga: oblique collision of the Superior craton with the 
core zone, causing transpressional deformation; formation of a thrust and 
fold belt with westerly vergence, metamorphism of the Labrador Trough 
to the east in Cycle 3 rocks. These rocks are located on the eastern edge 
and east of Hawk Ridge Project. 

7. From 1.77 to 1.74 Ga: exhumation and cooling of the hinterland of the 
Labrador Trough. (Simard et al., 2009) 

Property geology

During the New Quebec Orogeny the Hawk Ridge project area was overlain by a 
thick assemblage of sedimentary, volcanic and associated mafic and ultramafic 
sills of Proterozoic age in the Labrador Trough. These rocks were extensively 
thrust and folded mostly toward the west onto the craton. The Hawk Ridge 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 47 

Project is entirely underlain by rocks of the Labrador Trough which are composed 
of three distinct cycles of rocks (Figure 9 and Table 9). 

The basal rocks of Cycle 1 rocks are composed of an autochtonous and 
parautochtonous sequence that includes the units from the Lower Dolomite to 
the Chioak Formation. Cycle 2 rocks comprise an allochtonous sequence that 
includes all of the units from the Harveng Formation to the Hellancourt 
Formation. Cycle 3 rocks include poorly-mapped metamorphic equivalents of 
Cycle 2 rocks represented by the Thévenet Formation. The Montagnais Group 
represents mafic and ultramafic rocks that intrude mostly rocks of Cycle 2. 

Although slivers of the Sokoman Iron Formation of Cycle 1 have been identified 
and thrust in the region, the Hawk Ridge Project is underlain mostly by rocks of 
Cycle 2 and some from Cycle 3 along the eastern boundary of the area. Unless 
noted otherwise most of the descriptions in this section are taken from Goulet 
(1986 and 1995) and to a lesser extent from Clark and Wares (2005).  

Following is a description of the units of the Labrador Trough that are present in 
the Hawk Ridge area (see Figure 10 and Table 9). 

Cycle 1

  Sokoman Formation 

The Sokoman Formation, formerly called the Fenimore Formation, is the most 
important iron formation in the Labrador Trough. Local unconformities are 
present above and below the Sokoman Formation and it is either overlain by the 
Dragon Formation or by the Chioak Formation. 

In areas west of the Hawk Ridge Project area the Soloman Formation occurs as a 
an argillaceous schist, 2-3 m thick, that is followed by magnetite, hematite and 
jasper iron formation that grades into carbonate-chert iron formation.

Cycle 2

Abner Formation

An important thrust fault separates the Chioak Formation from the Abner 
Formation and all of the units above this transition are part of the Cycle 2 
allochtonous group. The Abner Formation, previously called the Denault 
Formation further south, is composed of grey massive dolomite, of thin 
stromatolitic dolomite, of dolomitic sandstone and of conglomerate formed of 
fragments of dolomite. The Abner Formation has been observed in faulted or 
thrust contact with any of the preceding sedimentary units of the Labrador 
Trough and the mylonitic contact is 2-3 cm to as much as 2-3 m thick. 

 Harveng Formation 

The Harveng Formation is present in the Hawk Ridge project area and represents 
the distal and easterly part of the Abner Formation with a minimum thickness of 
500 m. The Harveng Formation is composed of dolomite, dolomitic sandstone, 
quartzite, and of argillite. All of these units are schistose and highly deformed 
where all of the current indicators show a western provenance. 

Larch and Baby Formations 

A thrust fault 1-2 m thick separates the Harveng Formation from the Larch and 
Baby Formations. The units of the Baby Formation are composed of a thick 
sequence of turbidite composed of black argillite, silt and sandstone, of well-
sorted conglomerate and of graphitic schist. The Larch Formation is represented 
by iron formation. As a result of the thrusting and faulting, occasionally slivers of 
dolomite the Abner Formation have been thrust into the Larch and Baby 
sequence. The upper part of the Baby Formation corresponds to the Menihek 
Formation from further south in the Labrador Trough. The iron formation in the 
Larch Formation appears to be earlier and underlies the Hellancourt Formation. 

  Hellancourt Formation



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 53 

The Hellancourt Formation is composed of mostly mafic units of volcanic flows 
and of associated volcaniclastic sequences, and is in fault contact with the Larch 
and Baby Formations that are stratigraphically below. Occasional thrusting has 
been observed at the contact resulting in an apparent alternation between the 
Hellancourt and the Baby Formations.  

The tops of the flows are toward the east for both volcanic cycles that are 
respectively about 1500 m and 600 m thick.  The flows are mafic at the base and 
gradually change to intermediate in composition but these slightly more felsic 
units represent a small part of the sequence. 

Thin beds of sedimentary rocks to a few metres thick, composed of siltstone 
greywacke and argillite occur along thrust faults. The argillite is usually black, 
fine-grained, graphitic, often contain oxidized sulphides and have often been 
sheared. 

The end of the first volcanic sequence is marked by an increase in volcaniclastic 
rocks and by imbrications of thrust faults that may have created a repetition of 
the sequence. The base of each sequence is mostly massive, gradually changing 
to pillowed flows near the top. The flows are 1-30 m thick and are often 
separated by flow-top breccia containing hyaloclastic fragments. 

Two marker horizons of glomeroporphyritic gabbro are present near the base of 
the first cycle of volcanism and the second one is about 500 m higher in the 
sequence. The second one was dated at 1874±3 Ma (Clark and Wares, 2005). 
Glomeroporphyritic gabbro, often termed blotchy gabbro, is composed of gabbro 
or anorthositic gabbro with plagioclase megacrysts of 1-7 cm in size that make up 
10-80% of the rock. These units of gabbro are thought to be extrusive in origin 
since the lower one shows pillowed flows with feldspar phenocrysts near the top.  

The second sequence of volcanic rocks is more mafic, and sedimentary units of 
hyaloclastic composition often separate each flow, which are 1-30 m thick. 
Between pillowed flows volcaniclastic conglomerate less than 3 m thick is often 
present and the matrix is dark-coloured tuff. 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 54 

Cycle 3

Montagnais Group 

The Montagnais Group is composed of sills and occasionally of dykes of mafic to 
ultramafic composition that have intruded mostly the Baby, Hellancourt and 
occasionally the Thévenet Formations but can be present in all units. Age-dating 
of zircons from sills of gabbro gave a date of crystallization of 1874 Ma. 

The sills are composed of gabbro, quartz gabbro, quartz diorite, picrite, troctolite, 
and can be 200-300 m thick. Some are differentiated and can contain plagioclase 
phenocrysts 2-10 cm in diameter. The base of the differentiated sills is often 
composed of serpentinized peridotite containing chrysotile, followed by 
pyroxenite, coarse-grained gabbro, and finally by quartz diorite.  

Thévenet Formation

The Thévenet Formation is poorly understood and is located east of a major fault 
zone. Its eastern boundary is marked by a fault zone with Archean gneiss. 

The units in the Thévenet Formation could be metamorphosed equivalents of the 
Baby and Hellancourt Formation. Rocks consist of biotite and amphibole schist, 
conglomeratic schist, calcsilicate paragneiss, quartzite, sillimanite and garnet 
schist and iron formation.  

Pleistocene

Regionally a large part of the area is covered by a very thin layer of till and 
numerous erratic boulders. On the Hawk Ridge property there is little overburden 
and rock exposure is excellent. 

There is evidence of isostatic rebound after glaciation in the area south of Leaf 
Bay where terraces are present 3, 5, 30 and 50 m above present sea level. To the 
south Bérard (1959) reported one terrace at 150 m asl.  

On the project area glaciation is generally toward the northeast at 030° with a 
minor set at 080°.

Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec

Structural geology

Tectonic, stratigraphic and geochronological studies show that the Labrador 
Trough has been the object of complex polyphase deformation and three 
important phases of structural displacement have been documented in the Hawk 
Ridge region at the north end of the Labrador Trough.  

D1 deformation

The first deformation is represented by a delamination of the rocks along the 
Archean contact but also at the base of the Abner, Baby, Hellancourt and 
Thévenet Formations over a total distance of about 25 km. The thrusting was 
mostly parallel to the stratification and is oriented to the west, although locally to 
the southwest and northwest. Rocks become schistose and are imbricated in the 
volcanic units of the Hellancourt and Thévenet Formations. 

D2 deformation

This deformation produced open and upright folds, locally recumbent but usually 
oriented to the east or north-east with a local cleavage or crenulation. The 
decollement was produced mostly along the base of the Baby Formation. 

  D3 deformation

This deformation is the one responsible for the north-northwest alignment of the 
Labrador Trough and is represented by open and upright in the central part of the 
Labrador Trough but recumbent to the west in the north part of the Trough. The 
folds generally plunge 20° SE. The thrust faults along the Abner, Baby, 
Hellancourt and Thévenet were folded during D3 deformation. Several synclines 
and anticlines were created as a result of this deformation. Late stage D3 right-
handed brittle fracturing created faults oriented northwest possibly as a result of 
oblique movement to the southwest with horizontal movement in the order of 
15 km and a vertical component of ten kilometres, based on temperature and 
pressure components in garnet.

Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 57 

A cross-section at the south of the project area is shown in Figure 11 and the 
trace of the cross-section is shown in Figure 10. 

Local structure

Most of the units in the south of the Hawk Ridge Project strike 340° and dip 75°E 
to 75°W. In the central part of the project area data from the aeromagnetic data 
from the airborne survey shows a fault zone about 1600 m wide trending 345° 
has deflected the entire sequence westward, north of which the units strike 
generally 355-360° before returning to the northeast at the north end of the 
property. 

An important synform has been mapped along the Gabbro-Lava Zone areas 
where a series of synclines and anticlines strike north-northwest over a strike 
length of about 4800 m. The nose of this syncline is located west of the Fold 
Showing. Additional fold structures are present south of the Bacchus and 
Horseshoe Showings. East and north of the Main and Hopes Advance North 
Zones three other fold have been mapped striking north-northwest. 

In the south, from about 1600 m north of the Pio Lake showing to the southern 
boundary of the Hawk Ridge Property many fractures are apparent from the air 
photo data. The fractures strike northeast and northwest, some of which may be 
conjugate, but all of which show little apparent horizontal displacement. The 
vertical displacement has been reported to be "appreciable". 

Mineralization

Of the 29 copper and nickel mineral occurrences and zones of mineralization, 
many of which contain associated PGEs that have been identified to date on the 
Hawk Ridge Property to date four contain significant mineralization that should 
be further explored (Figure 10).

Pio Lake Zone

Located in the southern part of the Hawk Ridge Project, the Pio Lake Zone was 
discovered in the early 1960s. Pio lake and mine development work was carried 
out by Falconbridge and its partners until 1974. An adit and drifts were extended 
for a length of 117 m. Four raises were extended, three of which reached surface 
where they can be seen as pits on the surface.   

The area was drilled extensively in the 1960s and early 1970s but little of the 
information and none of the core is available. Troymin carried out a short drill 
program on the zone in 1995 where four drill holes totalled 198.3 m (Figure 12).  

In 1973-74 a total of 6437 tonnes of mineralization were mined from 
underground and open pits from both veins. In the East Vein the remaining 
resources was estimated at 7260 tonnes grading an average of 6.9% Cu and 0.3% 
Ni. In the West Vein the remaining resource was estimated at 9662 tonnes 
grading an average of 6.6% Cu and 3.2% Ni (Lone Star Mining, 1974). No data was 
included in Lone Star's report to determine the method used to calculate the 
resource, and none of the parameters used to calculate the resource were 
described in the report. This historical resource estimate is on the Hawk Ridge 
Property but the calculation does not conform to the categories used in NI-43-
101 regulations. There are no more recent resource calculations available on the 
Pio Lake Zone and since the core is no longer available additional drilling would 
be required to confirm or update the historical resource calculations.  A qualified 
person has not done sufficient work on to the data to classify this historical 
estimate of mineral resources, this resource should not be treated as a current 
mineral resource and should not be relied upon. The historical resource estimate 
is not being treated as current mineral resources or reserves.  

The area is underlain by basalt that has been structurally deformed and 
overturned into a synclinal fold about 1.5 km wide and 4 km long that plunges 
gently to the south-southeast. The axis of the fold is located about 275 m to the 
west and the Pio Lake Zone is on the east limb of the fold. A fault extends for at

least 2000 m to the south but appears to be truncated by a later northeast-
trending structure about 100 m north of the Pio Lake Zone.  

The copper and nickel mineralization is present in two lenses that contain veins 
of massive, semi-massive and disseminated sulphides in folded and faulted 
basalt, gabbro and pyroxenite that contain occasional bands of schist. The East 
Lens is about 2 m wide and has a strike length of 46 m on surface. The West Lens 
is 3 m wide and extends for 60 m. Both zones strike north-northwest ad dip 60-
85°E. Although the zone was drilled a depth of 100 m the 1995 drilling only tested 
the zone to a depth of 35 m (Figure 13).  

There is a distinct difference in the nature of the mineralization of each lens. The 
mineralization in the West Lens consists of massive, semi-massive and 
disseminated pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite in a fault-bounded section. 
In the East Lens the sulphides are represented by disseminated and laminated 
chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite mineralization in sheared basalt and sulphide-rich iron 
formation.  

The West Lens contains more massive and banded units and contains distinctly 
more nickel. The West Lens reported an average of 6.08% Cu, 1.43% Ni, 
0.05% Co, 15.0 g/t Ag, 0.4 g/t Pt and 1.1 g/t Pd over 2.82 m from a composite 
sample in drill hole HR 95-03.  

The mineralized zone is a fault-bounded lens of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and 
pentlandite in chloritized basalt flows of the Hellancourt Formation. The basalt is 
cut by several early thrust faults. The West Lens may be part of a larger magmatic 
copper-nickel zone, possibly related to a sill of ferropicritic composition (Wares 
and Mungall, 1997). The West Lens may have been tectonically detached by fault 
movement from a larger zone of magmatic mineralization.

The East Lens appears to have a different origin and may represent an epigenetic 
hydrothermal copper-nickel mineralization. The mineralization is laminated and 
parallel to the penetrative schistosity of the basalt but is often folded. The 
sulphides are rich in copper but contain lower quantities of nickel than in the 
West Lens. The mineralization contains 530-1800 ppb Pd but low values of 
platinum (Beauchamp, 2001). The current thought is that the East Lens formed as 
a result of the emplacement of epigenetic sulphides along the schistosity in the 
host basalt. The sulphides may have precipitated from hydrothermal fluids that 
could have been altered as a result of an interaction with the host basaltic 
igneous rocks (Clark and Wares, 2005). 

The East Lens reported 2.4% Cu and 0.07% Ni over 4.7 m, not true thickness from 
a fault zone of sericitized basalt that contains disseminated sulfides in drill hole 
HR 95-2. The section of mineralization including disseminated and massive 
mineralization averages 1.28% Cu and 0.04% Ni over 14.6 m, not true thickness. 

Drilling 300 m north of the Pio Lake Zone in 1996 confirmed the presence of 
massive sulphide mineralization in altered basalt. Drilling in HR 96-73 reported an 
average grade of 2.72% Cu and 0.32% Ni over 2.28 m, and in HR 96-90 an average 
of 2.0% Cu and 0.34% Ni over 4.6 m in altered basalts north of the northeast-
trending fault. 

Additional zones of mineralization in the region are at the Gabbro Zone, about 
600 m to the south of the Pio Lake Zone where a composite 0.66% Cu and 
0.23% Ni were intersected over 28.6 m in glomeroporphyritic gabbro in HR 96-77 
at the contact between peridotite above, and basalt below. The hole east of the 
fold axis of an overturned syncline drilled into peridotite. The nearby drill hole 
HR 96-78 was collared into the lower part of the porphyritic gabbro but was not 
sampled. This mineralization is identical in lithology and style to that described at 
the Hopes Advance Main Zone and at Schindler disseminated (see below).

Gamma and Schindler Zones

The Gamma and Schindler Zones are located in the central part of the Hawk 
Ridge property. The two zones are on strike and about 500 m apart. 

The area is underlain by a sequence of basalt, porphyritic gabbro and thin 
intervals of turbidite sedimentary rocks that have been thrust from the east and 
that dip steeply to the east. Peridotite has been injected at the contact between 
porphyritic gabbro and basalt, and appears to form a bulge south of the Schindler 
Zone where it is brecciated (Figure 14).  

The mineralization at the Gamma Zone consists of massive sulphides at the base 
of porphyritic gabbro in contact with graphitic schist and of disseminated 
sulphides in the centre and upper part of the porphyritic gabbro (Figure 15). The 
massive mineralization consists of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite 
associated with the underlying sedimentary units that are occasionally termed 
iron formation, graphitic schist and turbidite. Composite grades of 4.56% Cu, 
1.44% Ni over a near true-thickness of 3.5 m were intersected in HR 96-53 and 
the disseminated mineralization averages 0.52% Cu and 0.19% Ni over 16.2 m.  

The massive mineralization is of probable magmatic origin and the mineralization 
is continuous both at depth and along strike, where it has been intersected over a 
surface area of about 60×60 m (Figure 16).  

The mineralization is open at depth. To the north and south the massive 
mineralization appears closed but there is additional potential further north, and 
to the south where the Schindler Zone is located. 

The mineralization at the Schindler Zone is as disseminated sulphides along the 
upper part of the porphyritic gabbro that has been intruded by peridotite directly 
above. The mineralization appears to be continuous and an average 0.4% Cu and 
0.15% Ni was reported over 10.5 m, not true thickness in drill hole HR-97-102. 
The massive sulphide interval reported on surface was not intersected at depth 
(Figure 17).

Analyses for PGEs have not been performed on the core from the Gamma or 
Schindler Zones. Results from 16 surface rock samples taken by Wares and 
Goutier (1990) in the area reported 110-1230 ppb Pd and values of 120 and 
150 ppb Pt were reported from two analyses. 

Hopes Advance Main Zone

The Hopes Advance Main Zone is located in the northern part of the property 
immediately north of Lambda Lake. The zone is underlain by a unit of porphyritic 
gabbro that dips steeply to the east and lies above a unit of grey siliceous 
metasedimentary unit 3-15 m thick that contains 2-20% pyrrhotite and 0-1% 
chalcopyrite. Peridotite, gabbro and basalt in thrust contact with the 
glomeroporphyritic gabbro are present to the east.  

On surface the porphyritic gabbro appears as a gossan about 30 m wide and 
800 m long. To the east of the Main Zone an overturned doubly plunging syncline 
strikes north-northwest. The hinge zone for the double plunging syncline strikes 
northeast 400 m east of the zone of mineralization (Figure 18). 

In 1962 the Main Zone was tested by several channel samples and by two drill 
holes for a total of 676 m. The Main Zone was further evaluated in 1996-1997 
with 15 drill holes for 2922 m. The important intersections from these holes are 
presented in Table 10. 

A consultant performed a historical resource estimate using the drill hole assay 
data on the Hopes Advance Main Zone and reported 48.4 million tonnes of 
proven and probable reserves with an average grade of 0.51% Cu, 0.18% Ni and 
<0.01% Co to a depth of 500 m (Paul, 1997). The calculation was made using 
assay data from 14 drill holes from the 1996-1997 drilling campaign and from 
incomplete data in two holes drilled in 1962 and provided a to a depth of about 
500 m. The details of this historical resource estimate were described earlier in 
this report and present three scenarios for open pit operations and four scenarios 
for underground mining using key assumptions for commodity prices, exchange 
rates and costs that are no longer valid (Paul, 1997).

The mineral reserve calculations of the Hopes Advance Main Zone are unreliable 
and undependable because they were carried out prior to the development of 
the regulations of NI 43-101 and were performed by someone who is not a 
qualified person. The economic projections are invalid and of little value because 
many of the assumptions were not based on factual data and most are no longer 
valid.  

These historical resource estimates of reserves calculated on the Hopes Advance 
Main Zone by Paul should not be considered current mineral reserves. A more 
recent resource calculation has not been prepared on the Hopes Advance Main 
Zone because additional infill drilling and assaying in the zone are required to 
confirm the extent of the mineralization. Moreover, assay verifications of the 
core still available are necessary before any further resource calculation can be

made by a qualified person in this area. The historical resource estimate is not 
being treated as current mineral resources or reserves. 

The mineralization is present as disseminated and veined sulphides mostly in 
glomeroporphyritic gabbro. The glomeroporphyritic gabbro is uniform, massive 
and medium-grained, 60-80% of which is composed of greyish-white plagioclase 
glomerocrysts in a coarse-grained amphibole-rich matrix.  

More important mineralization is often reported 10-20 m above the base as in 
drill hole HR 96-10 where grades 0.7-1.4% Cu and 0.2-1.5% Ni were reported over 
a total core length of 8.7 m. The composite assays show a consistent average 
grade of mineralization throughout the unit and averages 0.54% Cu and 0.20% Ni 
over 46.6 m (Figure 19).  

A soil and rock chip survey carried out in 1989 on 332 samples reported three 
samples with more than 500 ppb Pt and six samples with more than 500 ppb Pt 
(see Table 11). 

 

Rock samples from the porphyritic gabbro and surrounding rocks reported values 
of 0-180 ppb Au, 5-50 ppb Pt and 4-210 ppb Pd from 17 samples (Wares and 
Goutier, 1990).  

In certain drill holes such as HR 96-20 the better mineralization occurs near the 
metasedimentary unit that has been hornfelsed where a composite grade of 
0.51% Cu and 0.17% Ni were reported over about 51.7 m, true width. 

Several of the drill holes in this section were not sampled to the bottom of the 
hole and additional mineralization could be identified in these sections.

Hopes Advance North Zone

The Hopes Advance North Zone is located 800 m north northeast of the Hopes
Advance Main Zone. The mineralized zone is underlain by folded and contorted
porphyritic gabbro, gabbro, graphitic schist and peridotite in a structurally
complex part of the property (Figure 20).

In 1962 Falconbridge and its joint venture partners drilled four holes for 600 m in
this area. Extensive trenching in the early 1960s reported a composite grade of
6.34% Cu and 1.09% Ni over 17.3 m, not true thickness, in the massive sulphide
section. In 1996 Troymin collared 26 drill holes into this region for a total of 3111
m and in 1997 an additional four holes were drilled for a total of 764 m.

Although structurally complex, the area appears to show a steeply plunging
anticlinal structure. The massive sulphides occur in tabular bodies on the western
limb of the structure that may be truncated. At Hopes Advance North copper
nickel mineralization is present as massive and disseminated sulphides in a zone
about 70 m long that strikes north northwest (Figure 20). Near the north end of
the Hopes Advance North Zone graphitic schist and gabbro associated with
peridotite that has been thrust from the east contain massive sulphides. Some of
the grades include composite intervals of 6.81% Cu and 1.92% Ni over 3.0 m and
1.24% Cu and 0.84% Ni over 3.95 m in HR 96 35.

In three drill hole fences along a new zone called the Hopes Advance Middle Zone
Troymin intersected disseminated and massive sulphides extending about 200 m
south of Hopes Advance North. In these three areas massive, stockwork and
disseminated chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite mineralization are associated with
graphitic schist and with porphyritic gabbro.

Eight sulphide rich grab samples from gabbro and amphibolite associated with
massive sulphide reported values of 140 400 ppb Pt and 120 910 ppb Pd from
the area (Wares and Goutier, 1990). A grab sample containing massive
chalcopyrite reported 4.4 g/t Pt and 11.3 g/t Pd. Two rock samples from gabbro

that reported 5-15% sulphides also contain 1.5 and 1.6 g/t Au but their exact 
coordinates are unknown. 

Drill hole HR 96-03 reported 1.3 g/t Pd over 0.88 m at 37.17 m; 3.5 g/t Au over 
1.2 m at 45.8 m; 1.0 g/t Pt, 2.8 g/t Pd, and 2.1 g/t Au over 1.0 m at 71.05 m; and 
1.1 g/t Pd over 5.0 m at 78.0-83.0 m. The intervals reported are probably not true 
thicknesses because complex structural environment in this area. No other 
section of core from Hopes Advance North was analyzed for PGEs (Figure 20) 
(Beauchamp, 2001). 

In a fence of three drill holes about 245 m south of the Hopes Advance North a 
zone of massive sulphides was intersected in two drill holes. In drill hole HR 96-32 
the interval of massive sulphides started at bedrock where a composite value of 
1.87% Cu and 0.74% Ni were reported over an interval of 4.0 metres, true 
thickness (Figure 22). The first interval of this composite reported 1.18% Cu and 
2.0% Ni over 1 m. 

Collared to test the down-dip extension of HR 96-32, drill hole HR 97-112 
intersected 2.45% Cu and 0.39% Ni over 3.5 m, true thickness, with values of 
0.55% Cu and 5.0% Ni over 0.5 m. Drill Hole HR 97-114 drilled further down-dip 
intersected only disseminated mineralization of 0.21-0.81% Cu and 0.09-0.37 
averaging 0.50% Cu and 0.19% Ni over 24.0 m, not true thickness. 

The style of mineralization is very similar to that of Pio Lake further south on the 
property. The massive sulphides with high copper and modest nickel, but high 
PGE are similar to those of the East Lens where they have been compared to 
hydrothermal mineralization, and the massive sulphide intervals with high copper 
and nickel resemble the West Lens, which may be magmatic mineralization. None 
of the core with high nickel values was assayed for PGEs.

8. Deposit Types 

The significant mineral occurrences identified to date on the Hawk Ridge Project 
are disseminated and massive sulphide showings of copper, nickel and platinum-
group elements (PGE) of magmatic and hydrothermal origin that are associated 
with mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Labrador Trough. 

Classification of nickel copper deposits

A broad group of deposits containing nickel, copper and platinum group elements 
(PGE) occur as sulphur segregations associated with several types of mafic and 
ultramafic magmatic and hydrothermal nickel-copper-(PGE) rocks. Nickel is 
usually the main economic commodity; copper may be either a co-product or by-
product, and platinum group elements are usual by-products. The deposits that 
are sulphide-rich and usually have a sulphide content of 10-90% are most often 
exploited for nickel and copper while those that have a sulphide content of 0.5-
5% have been more often exploited for their PGE content. 

Magmatic sulphide deposits that contain nickel and copper, with or without 
platinum-group elements, account for approximately 60 percent of the world's 
nickel production (Schulz et al., 2010). Current reserves from magmatic sulphide 
nickel deposits are large although lateritic nickel deposits have greater reserves, 
the only other important source of nickel. 

In a study of Canadian deposit types Eckstrand (1996) classified deposits of 
nickel-copper sulphide into four categories (Table 12). Much of the following 
description is summarized from his paper. 

There is only one type of astrobleme-associated nickel copper deposit (Type 1a). 
The Sudbury region hosts many deposits that are widely-believed to have formed 
as a result of a meteorite impact during the Proterozoic when the Sudbury Mafic 
Igneous Complex was produced in a basin or funnel-shaped ring that has since 
been deformed to a shape about 65 km long and 25 km wide.  

 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project

The nickel-copper deposits associated with rifts and continental flood basalt 
(Type 1b) are geographically widespread and range in age from Archean to 
Middle Jurassic. The large nickel-copper-PGE deposits at Noril'sk-Talnakh in 
Russia are of Permian and Triassic age.  At Noril'sk-Talnakh the basement rocks 
are composed of sedimentary rocks of Proterozoic and lower Paleozoic age that 
consist of dolomite, argillite and sandstone and that have been overlain and 
intruded by the Permian and Triassic Siberian Flood Basalts, one of the largest 
such igneous provinces in the world that extend over a region at least 100 km 
wide and 150 km long.  

Magmatic sulphide deposits of Type 1b form most often when a sulphur-
undersaturated picritic (high magnesium) or tholeiitic (high iron) basalt magma 
sourced in the mantle becomes saturated in sulphides, usually as a result of 
interaction with sedimentary crustal rocks. Sulphur from the sedimentary rocks 
results in the formation of an immiscible sulphide liquid; the sulphide liquid 
usually precipitates toward the base of the flow or sill. There may have been 
several pulses of magmatic injection at different times. The more common 
sulphide minerals include pyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite. Cobalt 
is usually associated with pentlandite, and the PGEs are usually found as small

grains of PGE-bearing sulphide, arsenide, antimonide, bismuthinide, and 
telluride. The deposits also contain 1-15% magnetite (Schulz et al., 2010). 

At Noril'sk the mineralization occurs near the base of the sill-like mafic and 
ultramafic hypabyssal intrusions that host magmatic nickel, copper and PGE 
mineralization. The intrusions are 500-2000 m wide and 50-300 m thick but can 
extend over a strike length of about 40 km (Figure 23).

The mafic sills are often differentiated and grade from olivine-bearing 
melanocratic gabbro at the base to leucocratic gabbro near the top and may have 
resulted from multiple pulses of magma of different composition. The 
mineralization consists of disseminated, massive and copper sulphides that are 
composed of pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite and pentlandite. The disseminated 
mineralization consists of droplets and fine veinlets dispersed throughout gabbro 
in bodies 5-40 m thick. The massive mineralization also occurs in sheet-like 
bodies that undulate along the basal contact of the mafic intrusions with the 
underlying sedimentary rocks.  The copper mineralization is composed of 
disseminated veinlets of copper-rich sulphides that form a halo around massive 
sulphides of brecciated sulphides in the roof of certain intrusions. The 
mineralization Noril'sk-Talnakh is particularly rich in PGEs with grades of 
0.6-3.0 g/t Pt and 4-13 g/t Pd in the massive sulphides. 

At the Duluth Complex in Minnesota, the Mid-Continent Rift system occurs over a 
strike length of more than 225 km and extends to Thunder Bay, Ontario. The 
mafic and ultramafic intrusions dated at 1.1 Ga are in contact with Archean 
granite and volcanic rocks and with Lower Proterozoic greywacke, slate and iron 
formation. Disseminated and minor zones of massive pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and 
pentlandite occur mostly near the base, but occasionally as much as 300-400 m 
above the basal contact with sedimentary rocks which also occur as xenoliths 
with the mafic intrusions. Many of these areas near Thunder Bay have seen 
extensive exploration over the past several years.  

In general terms, three types of sulphide mineralization can occur in a magmatic 
environment: Massive sulphides and net-textured sulphides can occur in dykes or 
in lenses near the base of the gabbro intrusions, occasionally extending into the 
footwall rocks. Massive sulphides can occur in topographic depressions at the 
base of the intrusions.  The sulphides can be zoned, with nickel-copper zones 
near the base progressing to copper-PGE-rich zones in the middle and upper 
parts. 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 82 

The second type of sulphide mineralization occurs when brecciated 
mineralization can form at the upper and lower contacts in sheets along the 
outside contacts of the massive sulphide lenses. The fragments can be composed 
of intrusion and wallrock lithologies.  

The third type of mineralization in Type 1b occurs as disseminated sulphides that 
can form lenses or tabular concentrations often in the middle or lower parts of 
the intrusions of gabbro. The sulphides can occur as spheres of 1 mm to 1 cm 
that contain chalcopyrite, pentlandite and pyrrhotite. There can be zonation with 
pyrrhotite-rich base and chalcopyrite-rich top. The type and distribution of the 
types of mineralization is shown in Table 13. 

The geological environment and the magmatic mineralization observed in the 
Labrador Trough show many similarities with Type 1b mineralization. Most of 
mineralized showings present on the Hawk Ridge property have been categorized 
as of magmatic origin, the most important of which are the Gamma and Schindler 
zones, Hopes Advance Main and the West Lens at Pio Lake. 

There is evidence at several showings at the Hawk Ridge Project of the presence 
of hydrothermal nickel-copper mineralization that may have been remobilized 
during one of the several phases of tectonism that have been documented on the 
property. These include Hopes Advance North, the east part of Pio Lake, as well 
as the Mungall, Bay and Lava zones. These may be of Type V. 

Type 1c mineralization associated with rocks of komatiitic composition found 
mostly in Archean greenstone belts and in rifted continental margins of 
Proterozoic age. The type examples are the Kambalda district of Western 
Australia where komatiitic flows and sulpha-rich chert developed in a fault-
bounded rift zone a few hundred kilometres wide and up to 800 km long. There 
are several Canadian deposits including those at Dumont, QC, and Shebandowan, 
ON. 

 



Technical Report
Hawk Ridge Project

Quebec

30 April 2012 page 83

The type 1c mineralization associated with rifts of Proterozoic age include
Pechenga in Russia, but more importantly those of the Thompson Belt in central
Manitoba and of the Raglan Belt about 375 km northwest of the Hawk Ridge 
Project. At Thompson lenses of mafic and ultramafic rocks have intruded
sulphide rich sedimentary rocks including siltstone, sandstone and shale. At
Raglan the nickel copper sulphides are at the base of lenses of peridotite along
the sediment volcanic contact in an allochtonous, recumbently folded sequence
of shale and komatiitic basalts. The peridotite lenses were originally thought of as
intrusive but are now seen to be extrusive.

The Raglan Belt hosts a large number of copper nickel occurrences and one
operating mine complex in the northern extension to the Circum Ungava Belt.
The Raglan Mine was developed on the Katiniq deposit by Falconbridge in 1997
and is currently operated by Xstrata Nickel. The Raglan Mine hosts a series of
high grade nickel copper sulphide deposits that are currently being mined from

three underground operations. The property stretches 70 km from east to west, 
with several high-grade deposits scattered along its length. The operation also 
produces palladium, platinum and cobalt. The concentrate produced on site is 
transported to Sudbury for smelting and is later refined in Norway. 

Type 1c deposits are mostly small nickel-copper deposits associated with mafic 
intrusions in many geological environments and of Archean to Cretaceous in age. 
They include Lynn Lake, MB, Macassa, ON, and Giant Mascot, BC. 

Type 1d nickel-copper deposits are associated with mafic and ultramafic 
intrusions that are usually differentiated and that occur as stocks and plugs. 

Mineral deposit types explored at the Hawk Ridge Property

From preliminary studies and evaluations two types of mineral nickel-copper 
mineralization have been suggested to be present at the Hawk Ridge Property:  

Magmatic mineralization: Eckstrand's Type 1b, rift- and continental flood 
basalt-associated mineralization; and 

Hydrothermally remobilized mineralization: Lesher's Type V, massive to 
semi-massive sulphides within shear and fault zones mainly associated 
with Type I sulphides. 

The magmatic mineralization has been identified at several locations including at 
the West Lens of the Pio Lake Zone, at Hopes Advance North and at the Gamma 
Zone where massive sulphides often containing 2-4% Cu and 1-3% Ni have been 
intersected over several metres. The disseminated sulphide mineralization 
identified in several areas in porphyritic gabbro is also magmatic mineralization 
and was reported at Hopes Advance Main Zone, but also in several other areas 
near Pio Lake and throughout the property. These zones average about 0.5% Cu 
and 0.2% Ni. 

The hydrothermal mineralization occurs as sulphides that were remobilized 
probably during structural deformation from massive or disseminated zones of 
copper-nickel mineralization. This mineralization is present as mostly massive, 
semi-massive and disseminated mineralization, most notably at the Pio Lake East

Vein and at Hopes Advance North. The typical assays reported from these zones 
are 1-3% Cu and 0-0.5% Ni, but some with reported total PGE contents of 1-4 g/t. 

9. Exploration 

There has been no mineral exploration on the Hawk Ridge Property in the last 
three years. 

In early 2012 the digital data for the geophysical survey was reprocessed. 
Although showing very complex EM responses, the data was judged to be of good 
quality and the depth of investigation was estimated to be 50-75 m. Zones of 
high priority recommended for follow-up that were selected from areas showing 
electromagnetic anomalies with high-conductance near the boundaries of 
inferred magnetite-rich ultramafic intrusions include the Horseshoe and Mungall-
Falcon Zones (Tykajlo, 2012). 

The data was processed to develop a large-scale interpretation of possible 
magnetite-rich gabbro and peridotite intrusions, of iron formations, and faults. 
The most important criterion was that significant copper-nickel mineralization 
would show up as high conductance HEM anomalies. Follow-up target areas were 
selected based on the presence of high-conductance HEM anomalies near the 
boundaries of magnetite-rich ultramafic intrusions (Figure 24). 

10. Drilling  

There has been no drilling on the Hawk Ridge Property in the last three years. 

11. Sample preparation, analyses and security

There is no description of the core sampling procedures, of shipping methods or 
of quality assurance and quality control measures for any of the analyses in the 
reports prior to 1995. The methods of analysis or digestion are not described and 
the laboratories used are not listed. The core size or sample sizes were not 
recorded in the reports and none of the shipping or handling procedures are 
described in the reports available. None of the samples or core prior to 1995 is 
available. 





Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 87 

In the 1995-1997 drilling program the geologist who logged the core marked the 
intervals to be sampled using a grease pencil. The core for these intervals was 
split using a core splitter and half of the core was sent for analysis and the other 
half was replaced in the core box. All core for this program including the second 
half of the core sampled is available in core boxes the field and is well-labelled. 

The core and rock samples were placed in a plastic bag and labelled.  

All samples were sent to Kuujjuaq by float plane and then shipped to Montreal by 
regular air cargo shipping. The type of container used to transport the samples 
was not recorded and there were no specific security measures taken to ensure 
the validity and integrity of the samples.  

All analyses for the field programs performed in 1995-1997 were carried out by 
Chimitec Ltée, of Val d'Or, QC, a laboratory that is now owned by ALS Chemex. 
The relation between Chimitec/ALS Chemex and Troymin, Santoy and Virginia 
Energy is purely commercial. There is no association between the laboratory and 
the historical or current property owner. 

Certification of analytical laboratories is a relatively new concept. Chimitec and 
ALS Chemex were not certified by any recognized organization at the time of the 
1995-1997 field programs. Now Canadian ALS Chemex laboratories are certified 
ISO 9001:2008. 

Sample preparation procedures are described in the laboratory reports for the 
1995-1997 field programs. Copper, nickel and cobalt analyses were performed by 
atomic absorption after dissolution in hydrochloric and nitric acid in a ratio of 3:1. 
The detection limit for copper and cobalt is 1 ppm, and for nickel it is 2 ppm. 
Analyses for gold were carried out by fire assay with a detection limit of 5 ppb.  

The procedures used to verify the quality of sample preparation, security and 
analytical procedures were virtually non-existent prior to about 1997 and the 
procedures used on the Hawk Ridge Project are typical of this era.  

In none of the reports consulted is there any record of any quality assurance or 
quality control (QA/QC). No blank, duplicate or assay standard were submitted to 



Technical Report

the laboratory to provide additional confidence and verification of the laboratory 
results. If the check analyses carried out by the laboratory were included in the 
laboratory report to the client they were not attached to the final geological 
reports and are not available. 

All analyses described from assessment reports are historical in nature and were 
performed prior to the development of current QA/QC and security standards. 
Keeping this in mind, there is no reason to doubt the results reported for the 
1995-1997 and there is no evidence that they are not reliable since they were 
performed by a laboratory that was well established at the time. 

Verification analyses can be performed on core samples from the 1995-1997 
drilling program since this core is available in the field. 

12. Data verification

The author carried out independent analyses of several rock samples taken from 
the project area from a few surface sites from the property visit in 2011 (Table 
14). The data shows good results from Pio Lake Zone and from the Hopes 
Advance North Zone. The sample from the Gamma Zone is not from the 
mineralized zone. Samples from the Pio Lake Zone are from the discarded pile at 
the entrance to the adit. 

13. Mineral processing and metallurgical testing 

A study on rock and core samples from glomeroporphyritic gabbro at the Hopes 
Advance Main Zone was carried out in 1999. The objective was to determine 
whether the feldspar fragments from the gabbro could be preferentially removed 
from a concentrate by carrying out a drop test on the samples. The results were 
inconclusive (Centre de recherche minérale, 1999).

Adjoining the eastern edge of the property mining lease BEX534 covering 44.1 ha 
was issued to the Nunavik Landholding Corporation of Aupaluk on 5 May 2008 
and is currently valid until 4 May 2013. 

Oceanic Iron Ore Corp. owns the mineral rights to a large number of claims 
located northwest of the Hawk Ridge project and extending west of Hopes 
Advance Bay where a substantial resource of sedimentary iron has been 
identified at the base of the Labrador Trough sequence (D'Anjou et al., 2011). 
This resource is not located on the Hawk Ridge Property and there is no 
indication that this type of mineralization is present on the Hawk Ridge property.  

Oceanic has proposed building a pelletizer plant and a year-round large tonnage 
vessel deepwater port on the north shore of Hopes Advance Bay at Aupaluk to 
ship its mineralization to facilities in Europe and Asia.

17. Interpretation and conclusions

The Hawk Ridge Project is underlain by a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks of 
the Labrador Trough that have been injected by mafic and ultramafic sills and 
dykes. The rocks have been thrust to the west in a series of slices that are folded 
and dip steeply to the east. 

More than 20 zones of copper, nickel and PGE mineralization have been 
identified over a strike of 40 kilometres on the property. These zones of 
mineralization contain varying proportions of massive and disseminated pyrite, 
pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite in bands of porphyritic gabbro flows and 
mafic and ultramafic sills that are associated with sedimentary rocks that include 
iron formation, graphitic schist and turbidite. 

Massive sulphides of magmatic origin have been identified and drilled at the Pio 
Lake, Gamma and Hopes Advance North zones where grades of 0.5-6.0% Cu and 
0.2-5.0% Ni were reported over several metres. Massive sulphides of apparent 
hydrothermal origin are associated with the Pio Lake and Hopes Advance North 
zones where grades of 2-3% Cu, less than 0.5% Ni and 1-10 g/t Pd were reported 
from several drill holes. 

The disseminated mineralization most often occurs with glomeroporphyritic 
gabbro that contains an average of 0.5% Cu and 0.18% Ni over common widths of 
30 metres and strike lengths that may exceed 800 m. A historical resource 
estimate was made on the Hopes Advance Main Zone and several other very 
similar zones of mineralization have been identified elsewhere on the property.  

The airborne geophysical survey carried out in 1996 has been reinterpreted. In 
part as a result of the many anomalies identified in the survey its depth of 
resolution is estimated to be about 50-75 m.  

The digital data that is currently available for reinterpretation and processing 
includes the geophysical data, drill hole and assay data from 1995-1997 for 
15,765 metres in 117 drill holes and a geological map. 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project

All of the data reported is from historical documents and the reliability of 
analytical data provided in these reports has not been proven. For this report a 
few rock samples from several zones has provided some confirmation of the 
mineralization reported on the property. Additional confirmation could be 
obtained by performing analyses on the drill core from the 1995-1997 drill 
programs, which represent the only core available from the historical drilling.  

For this reason any updated resource calculation needs to be confirmed by 
additional analyses if using results from 1995-1997, and with more drilling and 
analyses to verify the assays when using data where core is no longer available. 

Although there is broad correlation between the results of exploration data and 
assays from the historical reports over several decades of mineral exploration by 
several companies, all assay results are historical in nature and many must be 
confirmed by independent assays using an accredited laboratory along with 
current quality assurance and quality control methods. This applies to copper and 
nickel assays but particularly to assays for platinum group elements, where 
newer techniques may result in different values. 

The location of a certain number of drill hole collars from 1995-1997 was verified 
by differential GPS to an accuracy of about two metres. Inaccuracies in the exact 
positioning of these and other historical drill holes of the drill holes could have a 
significant impact on the interpretation of geological interpretations and 
extensions to mineralized zones. 

The results of the airborne geophysical survey carried out in 1996 have been 
recently reinterpreted and found to be reliable and correlate well with the 
geological data mapped in the field. The higher density sampling and greater 
degree of sophistication of the newer instruments can better differentiate the 
structural features on the project area and define the zones of interest. 

The presence of the proposed Baie-aux-Feuilles (Leaf Bay) provincial park and of 
Category 1 lands immediately adjoining the property could delay approvals for 
mineral exploration and development activities. As the provincial government 



Technical Report 
Hawk Ridge Project 

Quebec 

30 April 2012        page 94 

has given the responsibility for the administration of these areas to the local Inuit 
community good community relations can help reduce the potential delays. 

The Hawk Ridge Property is an advanced exploration property of merit and 
warrants additional exploration to further evaluate and assess several of the 
existing mineralized zones and to explore the full potential of the zones of 
interest. 

18. Recommendations

A drilling program should be undertaken at the Hopes Advance Main Zone where 
disseminated mineralization is present over a strike length of 800 m and a width 
of 30 m (Table 15). Six holes of about 160 m should be drilled to confirm and 
expand the mineralization identified at the Hopes Advance Main Zone. 

Concurrent with the drilling, an airborne helicopter geophysical survey should be 
flown over the property to better define the zones of mineralization already 
identified and at greater depth than can be achieved with the current data. The 
survey should include magnetic and a deep-penetrating, on-time recording 
system that can discriminate long time-constant EM anomalies. 

Additional historical drill hole data should be compiled and confirmed from 
assessment reports so that a better evaluation of the existing data can made and 
interpreted at the massive sulphide occurrences at Pio Lake, Gamma and Hopes 
Advance North. All previous historical drilling results not already in digital format 
should be integrated into the existing database established by Troymin in 1995-
1997. This data can then be used to further model the mineralization and 
geophysical data at Pio Lake and also at Hopes Advance North using 3D modelling 
software. An updated GPS survey of all recent and historical drill holes should be 
carried out in the field.  

Upon the return of a favourable evaluation of the results of the new airborne 
geophysical survey a Phase 2 drilling program should be undertaken and 
prioritized on the basis of the results of the new geophysical survey, of modelling
