1 .0  SUMMARY 
This report is an update to the Western Lithium Kings Valley property.  It addresses the Stage I and 
Stage II deposits as well as provides additional updates to the Project.  The report on the Stage I deposit 
includes a Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) identifying the progression of WLC's exploration of the 
property along with advancements in the metallurgical process.  The report on the Stage II deposit 
includes a mineral resource estimates for lithium (Li), along with potassium (K), fluorine (f), and sodium 
(Na).  The report amendment also addresses recent updates to the Project.  

1 . 1  L O C A T I O N ,  P R O P E R T Y  D E S C R I P T I O N ,  A N D  O W N E R S H I P  

The Project is located in Humboldt County, Nevada, USA approximately 100 km north-northwest of 
Winnemucca; 70 km north from Winnemucca along US Highway 95 to Orovada and then 33 km west-
northwest of Orovada on paved State Highway 293.  

WLC owns the Lith, Beta, BPE, Neutron, Neutron Plus 1 and Neutron R claims that encompass five areas 
of lithium mineralization.  These five areas are covered by approximately 2,500 federal unpatented 
claims over an area of approximately 15,233 hectares.  The Project site has been the subject of various 
early stage exploration programs.  However, there has been no mine development or production within 
the Project area boundaries, and therefore no mine workings or mill tailings are present on the 
property.  There have been three areas of focus for the Kings Valley Project as follows: (i) the PFS 
covering the Stage I Lens (formerly PCD Lens), which is entirely included within 219 federal unpatented 
claims and covers an area of approximately 1,468 hectares (ha); (ii) the resource estimate covering the 
Stage II Lens (formerly the South Lens); and (iii) the organoclay drilling additive operations which 
contemplate extraction of small amounts of clay on the Stage I Lens and manufacturing of drilling 
additive products at Fernley, Nevada. 

1 . 2  G E O L O G Y  A N D  M I N E R A L I Z A T I O N  

The Kings Valley Lithium Project (the Project) is situated within the south end of the McDermitt caldera 
located in Humboldt County, Nevada.  It lies within a well-preserved Miocene collapse structure in 
northwestern Nevada near the southern Oregon border.  The lithium deposits occur within sedimentary 
and volcano-sedimentary rocks in the moat of a resurgent caldera.  The extent and nature of the host 
rocks is well documented and understood.  Several lenses of mineralization have been identified in this 
region, though the focus of the Project is on the southern Stage I and Stage II Lenses. 

The Stage I Lens is the southernmost and smallest of the mineralized lenses in the area.  The lens is 
composed of an approximately 3 to 5 m thick layer of alluvium underlain by lithium-enriched 
interbedded claystones, ash-rich clays and ash layers up to 60 to 90 m thick in the northwest and 
southwest ends of the Project area.  These claystone-ash layers thin in the middle of the proposed pit 
coinciding with faulting and a predominance of brown-black basalts.  Interbedded basalts occur fairly 
shallowly in the northwest end of the pit and are found deeper in the southeast end.  The lithium-rich 
beds with higher lithium concentrations (>4,000 ppm) are generally found deeper in the deposit (below 
30 m).  The base deposit varies across the Project area averaging between 68 to 90 m and is marked by 
an obvious transition to an oxidized silicified claystone and ash layer.  

Exploration drilling by WLC has resulted in identifying clay-rich sequences with lithium concentrations 
exceeding those in previous studies.  In the Project area clays and clay/ashes are disseminated

throughout the deposit, but the highest lithium concentrations are broadly found between 36 and 67 m 
below ground surface (bgs). 

The Stage II Lens is located approximately 10 km NNW of the Stage I Lens, the southernmost lithium 
mineralized lens in the area.  The Stage II mineralized beds comprises mainly of a dark green claystone, 
at times intercalated with arkose beds; in the NE region of the modeled area a fanglomerate body is 
present.  Lithium-rich beds are generally 10 to 60 m thick in most areas, and defined as interesting Li 
grades as greater than 1,500 ppm.  Alluvium cover is variable, ranging from no cover at all to a maximum 
of about 6m.  At the Stage II Lens, the continuity of the mineralization has been confirmed by drilling at 
spacings at a nominal 200 m, with a smaller area drilled at about 40 m line spacings. 

For both the Stage I and 2 Lenses, mineralization consists of layered beds of lithium-bearing clay-rich 
volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  The main lithium-bearing mineral is reported to be a magnesium clay 
mineral that includes the Hectorite and Illite group.  Hectorite, a rare Li-Mg clay mineral of the smectite 
group.  The beds exhibit very good geological lateral continuity over kilometers, as shown by drill holes 
spaced on the order of 500 m.  The thickness of mineralization varies from less than a meter to more 
than 90 m with typical intercepts of about 30 m.  The extent of mineralization is well known.   

A report entitled Geochemical Characterization Program (Tetra Tech, 2011), summarizes the x-ray 
diffraction (XRD) and mineralogical analysis, showing that the highest lithium concentrations are 
associated with the mineral illite, a non-expanding dioctahedral clay, which is the dominant clay mineral 
at deeper depths, about 36 to 60 m.  The clay minerals at shallow depths (beginning at about 30 m bgs 
are identified as a smectite clay.  At deeper depths, the dominant clay mineral is identified as illite.  
A thin transition layer composed of a mixed illite/smectite exists between the two dominant clay 
minerals.  This mineralogical work is based on using six drillholes all within the proposed pit. 

A summary discussion regarding mineralisation characteristics in relation to the hectorite clay for the 
organoclay additive operation can be found in Section 1.12.

To date, there are no analogous deposits in operation worldwide.  The hectorite deposits at Hector, 
California have similar mineralogy, but the geological setting is significantly different. 

These deposits are believed to have formed by hydrothermal alteration of layered volcaniclastic 
sedimentary rocks.  What is not clear is whether the alteration was essentially syngenetic with 
deposition of the sedimentary rocks or whether the alteration is a post depositional event.  
Additional work is required to resolve the origin of these deposits.

1.4.1 Stage I 

WLC engaged Reserva International, LLC, to provide a block-model based mineral resource estimate for 
the Project.  The current mineral resource estimate was developed with the WLC drillhole database 
available as of June 28, 2011.  WLC has drilled and assayed 198 core holes, totaling 19,563 m.  
The resources are reported using a lithium cutoff of 3,200 ppm.  Lithium carbonate is the primary 
product with potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate as byproducts.

Volcaniclastic moat sedimentary rocks that contain lithium-rich claystone control the Stage I Lens 
mineralization.  Sectional interpretations (E-W and N-S) were generated from drill logs for alluvium, 
claystone (moat sediments), volcanics and basalt, a silicified unit, and bedrock.  Two oxidation surfaces 
were also interpreted, one just below alluvium and another near the claystone/silicified interface.  
Additionally, a series of faults have been interpreted based on the drillhole data and incorporated into 
the geologic interpretation.  The potentially economic mineralized estimation domain is the claystone.  
The alluvium and bedrock material have no lithium or potassium grades. 

The mineral resources have been classified according to the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines (November 2004 and update November 2010).  Resources are 
shown in Table 1.1.  This table shows the total estimated resources for the Stage I Lens.  Rounding errors 
occur in Table 1.1 and the contained metal does not account for mine or metallurgical recovery.  
To convert from Li% to Li ppm, multiply the percent value by 10,000.  The conversion factor from Li% to 
LCE is 5.323.  This factor is determined as follows:   

molecular weight Li2CO3   =  (2 × 6.941) + (12.011) + (3 ×15.9994)     =    5.323 

molecular weight 2 x Li      ( 2 × 6.941)

1.4.2 Stage II 

GSI completed a review of the exploration work on the Stage II area of the Kings Valley project and has 
developed a lithium and potassium mineral resource estimates that conforms to Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators. 

The resource estimate was completed by Mr. Mario E. Rossi, CIM, AusIMM, SME, IAMG, and Principal 
Geostatistician of GSI.  Mr. Rossi is an independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 by reason 
of education, affiliation with a professional association (as defined in NI 43-101) and past relevant work 
experience.   

Table 1.2 presents the in-situ Li and K mineral resources for the Stage II Lens area, Kings Valley property, 
at a cut-off grade of 0.20% Li.  The potassium (K) grade is considered a by-product of the Li resource.  
An average in-situ dry density of 1.96 t/m3 for the mineralized volume was used as tonnage factor. 

GSI is of the opinion that the exploration potential exist at the Stage II Lens to increase the current 
resource estimate.

Rounding errors may exist. 
Contained metal does not allow for mine or metallurgical recovery. 
Tonnage factor used is 1.96 t/m3. 
Economic assumptions do not include any potassium credits. 
Conversion factor from Li metal to Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE) used is 5.323. 
Economic assumptions for cutoff grade determination are:  
      - US$ 3.50 Li carbonate/lb; 60% metallurgical recovery; US$ 50/tonne processing; US$ 2.20/tonne mining 

There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and 
political or other relevant issues that may materially affect the resource estimate.  Other relevant factors 
that may materially affect the resource estimate, including mining, metallurgical, and infrastructure are well 
understood according to the assumptions presented in the Stage II Resource Estimate.

Two different mine plans were developed for the Stage I PFS and related reserve estimate on the Project 
to test the expandability of the project.  The first plan, Case 1, delivers 689,850 tonnes of dry mill feed 
each year for 20 years.  The second plan, Case 2, delivers 689,850 tonnes of dry mill feed for three years, 
increasing to 1,379,700 tonnes of dry mill feed for another 17 years.  Measured and Indicated material 
from the resource model were converted to a Proven and Probable mineral reserve for both Case 1 and 
Case 2, by applying the pit design for each. 

For Case 1, the outlines of each mining phase (1 through 5) were applied to the three dimensional grade 
model.  Material that fell inside the phases was classified as ore if it was of a Measured or Indicated

resource class and it was 0.32% Li or higher.  Material that fell inside the phases that was not classified 
as ore was classified as waste. 

For Case 2, the outlines of each mining phase (1 through 8) were applied to the three dimensional grade 
model.  Material that fell inside the phases was classified as ore if it was of a Measured or Indicated 
resource class and it was 0.32% Li or higher.  Material that fell inside the phases that was not classified 
as ore was classified as waste. 

Results are tabulated in Table 1.3 and Table 1.4 and are subdivided by logical mining phase.

1.7.1 Stage I 

Tetra Tech performed an evaluation of the potential surface resource for the mineralized deposit.  
The surface mining work presented in this Stage I PFS is based on measured and indicated resources.  
Pertinent design parameters are: 

• 41 degree maximum slope angle for pit walls 

• 30 m wide ramps 

• 10% maximum ramp grade 

• 95% mining recovery with zero dilution assumed 

• 3:1 H:V face angle for final waste dump faces 

• 2.5:1 H:V face angle for working waste dump faces 

• Design on single benching, 3 m benches 

1.7.1.1 Case 1 Mine Plan 

Potentially mineable pit shapes were identified using a Lerchs-Grossman (LG) analysis performed with 
GEMS™ Whittle pit optimization software and the Kings Valley mineral resource model.  The optimization 
is based on preliminary estimates of operating cost, recoveries and lithium pricing.  The optimization 
runs used only measured and indicated material for processing.  All inferred material was considered as 
waste.  Note that ore tonnes and grade will not match exactly with detailed schedule because variable 
cutoffs were used during first few years of operation. 

An ultimate pit shell was designed based upon the selected Whittle pit shell that generated smoothed 
pit walls and removed adverse pit wall features such as noses.  Then, phases within the ultimate pit 
were generated that would extract the ore in a logical sequence, and eventually enable waste to be 
backfilled into already mined areas in the pit.  The phase designs include smoothed pit walls, haulage 
ramps, and pit access.  A total of five phases were designed in all. 

Based on the phase designs, an annual production schedule was generated that levels out total material 
movement per year and provides the required mill feed.  The mill is designed for 2,100 tonnes per day 
(tpd) of dry feed, operating at 365 days per year at 90% availability.  This works out to a total of 
689,850 dry tonnes of ore from the mine each year.  Mine plans were then produced for each year, 
based on the production schedule.  Once mine plans were produced and annual waste production 
known, a series of five waste dump phases were designed.  Waste Dump Phase 1 is completely external 
to the open pit, while the remaining dump phases are all backfill phases. 

Lithium ore and waste rock will be extracted via an open-pit mine operation using end-dump haul 
trucks, hydraulic shovel, and one Wirtgen surface miner.  Waste rock will be mined with a truck/shovel 
combination, while ore will be mined with the Wirtgen unit and direct loaded into haul trucks.  
Waste rock will be excavated via free-digging; it is assumed that no blasting will be needed.  

The Case 1 LOM Production Summary is shown in Table 1.5.

1.7.1.2 Case 2 Mine Plan 

The same family of Whittle shells generated for Case 1 was used to identify a suitable ultimate shell for 
Case 2 which is an expanded production version of Case 1.  For the first three years, the mill throughput 
is held constant at 689,850 tpy, the same as Case 1.  However, in Year 4 and beyond, the mill throughput 
is doubled to 1,379,700 tpy.  Waste movement holds steady at around 3.9 to 4.0 million tpy in Years 1 
through 8, then increases to around 5.2 million tpy in Years 8 through 14, further increases to around 
7 million tpy for Years 15 through 18 and then quickly drops off in Years 19 and 20.  Note that ore 
tonnes and grade will not match exactly with detailed schedule because variable cutoffs were used 
during first few years of operation. 

As in Case 1, lithium ore and waste rock will be extracted via an open-pit mine operation using end-
dump haul trucks, hydraulic shovels and a Wirtgen surface miner.

Two scenarios were evaluated.  Case 1 was based on mining and processing ore at a design throughput 
rate of 2,100 tonnes per day (tpd).  Case 2 considered starting at 2,100 tpd and then doubling ore 
production in Year 4. 

Highlights: 

• Case 1 pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV of US$262 million, with an IRR of 21.2% at a 
8% discount rate. 

• Case 1 post-tax NPV of US$175 million with an IRR of 17.6% at a 8% discount rate. 

• Case 1 has a 21-year mine life, processing 13.9 million tonnes (dry basis) of ore at an 
average grade of 0.404% Li. 

• Case 1 initial startup capital (including contingency of US$21.9 million), totals 
US$237.1 million.  Sustaining capital of US$25.6 million is primarily composed of surface 
mine equipment, development, expansion of dry stack tailings, and surface water 
management and mine closure.  A 10% contingency is included in the sustaining capital for 
all costs except surface mine equipment. 

• Case 2 pre-tax NPV of US$551.8 million with an IRR of 24.4% at a 8% discount rate. 

• Case 2 post-tax NPV of US$372.5 million with an IRR of 20.3% at a 8% discount rate. 

• Case 2 has a 20-year mine life processing 25.5 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 
0.400% Li. 

• Case 2 initial startup capital, including a contingency of (US$21.9 million), totals

surface water management, and mine closure.  A 10% contingency is included with the 
sustaining capital for all costs except surface mine equipment. 

• Commodity prices used in the economic evaluation are US$6,000 per tonne Li2CO3, 
US$600 per tonne K2SO4 and US$75 per tonne Na2SO4. 

• The resource would be exploited using bulk surface mining methods for overburden/waste 
and selective mining methods for the mineralized material. 

• A proprietary process would be applied. 

• The mine would produce three products: lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), potassium sulfate 
(K2SO4) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). 

• The target production rate for Case 1 is a nominal 13,000 tpy of lithium carbonate. 

• The target production rate for Case 2 is a nominal 13,000 tpy lithium carbonate for Years 1 
through 3 increasing to 26,000 tpy lithium carbonate in Year 4. 

• Electricity would be provided from the existing grid.  

• Water would be sourced from on-site wells. 

• Subsequent to the Stage I PFS analysis, the Project has incurred royalty obligations that 
were not included in the Stage I economic estimate.  The economic analysis of the Project 
has not been updated to account for these royalties.

The cash flow analysis includes all mining, processing, and capital costs.  Cash flow analyses were 
performed on both a pre-tax and post-tax basis.  Applicable depletion and depreciation were calculated 
for determination of the Nevada State Minerals Tax and post-tax cash flow calculations.  A federal 
income tax rate of 35% was used and working capital was set to 20% of yearly operating costs.  
A discount rate of 8% was used to determine the Project NPV. 

The financial results of this Stage I PFS are presented in 100% owner's equity and constant 2011 US dollars 
for both cases.  An 8% discount rate has been applied to the financial analysis.  Sensitivity analyses were 
completed for both cases using varying lithium carbonate prices, capital cost estimates, operating cost 
estimates and process recoveries.

1 . 1 2  C L A Y  O P E R A T I O N S  

Western Lithium has established the Kings Valley Clay (KVC) Project internally to pursue the opportunity 
as a supplier of specialty drilling fluid referred to as organoclay for use in the oil and gas industry.  
An internal analysis assessed the areas that would have the highest potential for supplying clay for 
possible drilling fluids applications finding that the claystone deposit near the surface and in the oxidized 
zone as most suitable.  Development is planned for both lithium and clay on that portion of the deposit 
referred to as Stage I.   

The company is designing and building a 10,000 tons per year organoclay manufacturing plant in 
Fernley, Nevada to make the specialty clay with commissioning targeted for late summer 2014.  
The hectorite clay from the Kings Valley Property will be one of several raw materials (other clays) that 
will be utilized as feed.  At present, this project does not address nor identify any mineral resource 
disclosure classification for the clay as described under NI 43-101 nor has Western Lithium 
demonstrated the economic viability of the organoclay business. 

1 . 1 3  S T A T U S  O F  E X P L O R A T I O N  A N D  D E V E L O P M E N T  

WLC has conducted only minor exploration activity on the property since the cut-off date for the Stage I 
resource estimate, consisting mainly of test work related to the organoclay drilling additive 
manufacturing process, as described in Sections 1.12 and 24.3.  WLC has conducted development 
activity in respect of the organoclay drilling additive manufacturing facility in Fernley, and has also 
obtained permits to support future clay extraction operations on the property.  

1 . 1 4  C O N C L U S I O N S  A N D  R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S  

1.14.1 Stage I 

WLC has a defined ore reserve that can be mined for lithium bearing ore and a process to recover 
lithium, potassium and sodium as marketable products. 

The findings of this preliminary feasibility study provide a basis to advance the evaluation of the Project 
toward a feasibility level study.  

The following recommendations for the Project should be considered: 

• Continue the permitting process for the Project 

• Build and operate a pilot facility to optimize the flowsheet, quantify calciner energy 
requirements and off-gas composition 

• Confirm the required addition on anhydrite and dolomite per tonne of ore to achieve design 
product recovery for the next phase of the project. 

• Verify the suitability of coal for direct-firing the calciner and quantify of the associated 
energy requirements in the next phase of testwork.  Analyze the calciner off-gas from the 
coal-fired calcining tests to provide a basis for treatment requirements. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 1-21 

• Identification of corrosive gases from the calcination process in the testwork to date 
suggests future testwork to quantify the content and volume of gas flows for materials 
selection in calcining equipment and gas-handling ductwork. 

• Confirm the revised flowsheet that does not incorporate the acidification step in the next 
phase of testwork. 

Total estimated cost for these recommendations is between US$7,210,000-10,210,000. 

1.14.2 Stage II 

1.14.2.1 Drilling 

At the present time, exploration at the Stage II (South Lens) deposit is sufficient to produce a mineral 
resource estimate that complies with CIM Definition Standards.  

Additional drilling would be required to fill in some gaps in the drill pattern to upgrade resources from 
inferred to indicated, as well as indicated to measured resources.  Additional infill drilling of the Stage II 
area is required for a detailed project definition and feasibility-level resource estimation.  A nominal grid 
of 160 x 160 m should ensure that most resources are classified as indicated.  A nominal drill hole 
spacing of 80 x 80 m would be required for measured resources.  

1.14.2.2 QA-QC  

Regarding further Stage II drilling programs, GSI agrees with AMEC's recommendation in previous 
Technical Reports that site specific standards be produced for the Kings Valley Li project from materials 
found in the project area.  These standards should cover the expected grade ranges for Li, F, Na, and K.   

GSI also recommends routine insertion of coarse duplicates (-10 #), in addition to the standards, pulp 
duplicates, and blank samples to monitor accuracy, precision and contamination.  GSI also recommends 
that check samples be sent to a second laboratory.  

1.14.2.3 Topographic Mapping 

GSI recommends improving the topographic map currently available for the Stage II area.  The level of 
detail is insufficient for (further) pre- and feasibility engineering work.   

1.14.2.4 Density verification 

GSI recommends that at least 50 additional dry density data be acquired from the moat sediments to 
better refine the in situ dry density estimate.  There should also be an additional 10 density samples 
taken from alluvial material, as well as another 10 from the bedrock material, to improve the estimate 
of waste material to be moved.  The density should always be determined using a wax-coat, immersion 
procedure; for broken up and friable samples, a soil or aggregate density method determination can be 
used.   



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 1-22 

1.14.2.5 Metallurgical Testing  

GSI recommends that metallurgical samples from the Stage II (South Lens) be collected and tested 
according to the process flowsheet.  This would allow refining metal recovery and process operating 
costs estimates.  An assessment of the possible differences between the metallurgical responses of 
material from the Stage I (PCD Lens) and the Stage II (South Lens) should be made. 

1.14.2.6 Mine Design, including Geotechnical assessments 

At the present time, there are no mineral reserves at the Stage II (South Lens) deposit; mine 
optimization and design, including collecting and analyzing geotechnical data, would be required for 
future project advancement.   

1.14.2.7 Proposed Budget 

Total estimated cost for these recommendations is approximately US$1,030,000.

2.2.1 Stage I 

The scope of work conducted by Tetra Tech per request of WLC in connection with the Stage I PFS for 
the Project was to define the necessary elements from startup and construction of the project through 
final closure and reclamation at a ±25 percent level of accuracy.  Tetra Tech, leading and working in 
coordination with WLC's other contractors, developed the critical design parameters for the project 
consisting of geology, mineral resources, mine plans, mineral reserves, process plant design, 
infrastructure, environmental requirements, site drainage, hydrogeology, permits, closure 
requirements, capital and operating cost estimates, resulting in the overall economic evaluation of the 
Project. 

The Project includes two alternative approaches for project development: a Case 1 alternative that 
represents 2,100 tpd of plant throughput resulting in a normalized yearly production of 13,000 tonnes of 
lithium carbonate for the life of the Project and Case 2 that represents an increase in production to 
4,200 tpd of lithium carbonate occurring in Year 4 of the Project through the life of the Project.  

2.2.2 Stage II  

GeoSystems International, Inc. (GSI) was commissioned by WLC to author and prepare an NI 43-101 
compliant resource estimate and Technical Report for Stage II Lens, McDermitt caldera, Kings Valley 
project, located near Orovada in Humboldt County, Nevada, USA.  GSI developed a mineral resource 
estimate for lithium (Li), along with potassium (K), fluorine (F), and sodium (Na), for an area within 
what is known as the South Pod, one of five identified areas within the McDermitt caldera deposit 
with significant lithium mineralization.  This work was restricted to the Stage II Lens, only a portion of 
which has had sufficient drilling to produce an initial resource estimate.  The estimate includes a total 
of 38 WLC diamond drill holes (2,150.87 m), as well as 13 older Chevron holes, of which 3 are diamond 
drill cores, and the remaining a mixture of reverse circulation (RC) and rotary drill holes (868.74 m).

4 .0  PR OPER TY DESCR IPT ION  AN D LOC ATION 
Disclosure regarding mineral tenure to the Kings Valley Property is based on the title opinion of Harris & 
Thompson, Nevada, counsel for WLC.  This opinion is limited to Sections 4.1 through 4.4.  
Qualified Persons have relied on that opinion entirely, without independent investigation.  

4 . 1  P R O P E R T Y  A R E A  A N D  L O C A T I O N  

The Kings Valley Property comprises an area of approximately 15,233 ha within Humboldt County, 
Nevada, that is approximately 100 km north-northwest of Winnemucca and 33 km west-northwest of 
Orovada, Nevada (centered on 40°42°27.24"N Latitude, 118°3°26.81"W).  Situated in a remote section 
of northern Nevada, the King Valley Property consists primarily of sparsely populated ranch land within, 
and surrounded by, BLM lands on the northwest, western and southern sections of the McDermitt 
caldera.  A small number of WLC's claims are located, and registered, in Miller County, Oregon.  
Five areas of significant lithium mineralization have been identified on the Kings Valley Property – the 
Stage I Lens (PCD), Stage II Lens (South), Stage III Lens (South Central), Stage IV Lens (North Central), and 
Stage V Lens (North).  To date WLC has focused its efforts on the Stage I Lens (formerly referred to as 
the PCD Lens), with limited work having been conducted at the Stage II Lens location. 

The Stage I and Stage II Lens, being approximately 1,468 hectares, and 2,431 acres, respectively, are 
situated:  

• with respect to the Stage I Lens, at the southern end of the McDermitt caldera in T44N, 
R35E within Sections 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17 and on the USGS Thacker Pass at 
7.5 min quadrangle at an approximate elevation of 1,500 m; and  

• with respect to the Stage II Lens, in Township 45 North, Rangy 34 East, Sections 2 and 13; 
Township 46 North, Range 34 East, Sections 11 and 27. 

4 . 2  M I N E R A L  T E N U R E  

The underlying title to the Kings Valley Property is held through a series of UMs.  WLC holds its interests 
in the UMs indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries.  UMs provide the holder with the rights to all 
locatable minerals on the relevant property, which includes lithium; however, this interest remains 
subject to the paramount title of the federal government who maintains fee simple title on the land. 

The holder of an UM maintains a perpetual entitlement to the UM, provided it meets the obligations for 
UMs as required by the Mining Act.  At this time, the principal obligation imposed on the holders of UMs 
is to pay an annual fee, which represents payment in lieu of assessment work required under the Mining 
Act.  The annual fee of $140.00 per claim is payable to the BLM in addition to a fee of $10.50 per claim 
paid to the county recorder of the relevant county in Nevada (or, in a small number of cases, Oregon) 
where the UM is located.  UM holders record annually an Affidavit and Notice of Intent to Hold.  In 2010 
the State of Nevada passed a bill requiring the payment of a fee ranging between US$85.00 and 
US$195.00 per UM, with such payments due in June 2011.  In 2011 this bill was found to be 
unconstitutional and those claim fees have been refunded.  

An UM does not, on its own, give the holder the right to extract and sell locatable minerals, as there are 
numerous other regulatory approvals and permits required as part of this process.  In Nevada, such 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 4-2 

approvals and permits include approval of a plan of operations by the BLM and environmental 
approvals.  The Mining Act also does not explicitly authorize the owner of an UM to sell minerals that 
are leasable under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (the "MLLA"), which includes 
potassium and sodium.  The BLM is vested with a great deal of discretion in the management of the 
right to sell minerals governed by the MLLA, particularly where they represent a potential by-product to 
an economically viable mineral deposit governed by the Mining Act.  WLC has initiated discussions with 
BLM to determine what, if any, contractual or regulatory approvals will be required to sell upgraded 
potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate as by-products to lithium production and to confirm WLC's priority 
to such approvals, but the matter has not been determined.  Accordingly, at this time it is not possible to 
confirm the entitlement of WLC to sell potassium sulfate or sodium sulfate as a by-product to lithium 
production on the Kings Valley Property.

Western Lithium Corporation ("Western Lithium Nevada") is a Nevada corporation that is currently a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Canadian-based WLC.  Pursuant to an agreement signed on 
December 20, 2007 between Western Energy Development Corporation ("WEDC"), a subsidiary of 
Western Uranium Corporation, and WLC (which was then also a subsidiary of Western Uranium 
Corporation), WEDC leased to WLC the Lith and Neutron claims for the purpose of lithium exploration 
and exploitation (the "Lease").   

The agreement granted Western Lithium Nevada exclusive rights to explore, develop, and mine or 
otherwise produce any and all lithium deposits discovered on the claims, subject to royalty payments.  
The leased area, at that time, included the entirety of the Stage I and Stage II Lens and included 
1,378 claims that covered over 11,000 ha.  Lithium deposits to be exploited included, but were not 
limited to, deposits of amblygonite, eucryptite, hectorite, lepidolite, petalite, spodumene and bentonitic 
clays.  Rights to all other mineral types, including base and precious metals, uranium, vanadium and 
uranium- or vanadium-bearing materials or ores were expressly reserved by WEDC.   

The term of that lease agreement was 30 years and granted to Western Lithium Nevada the exclusive 
right to purchase the unpatented mining claims comprising a designated discovery, subject to the 
royalty and other rights to be reserved by WEDC and subject to Western Lithium Nevada obligations 
under the deed to be executed and delivered by WEDC on the closing of the option (PAEE URS 2010).  
In July, 2008, WLC ceased to be wholly-owned by Western Uranium Corporation and became an 
independent publicly traded company.   

Effective February 4, 2011, Western Uranium Corporation, WEDC, WLC and Western Lithium Nevada 
entered into an agreement for the purchase by Western Lithium Nevada from WEDC of the royalties and 
titles for the Kings Valley Property. 

In March 2011, the parties completed the transaction for the sale by WEDC to Western Lithium Nevada 
of the royalties and titles constituting all of the Kings Valley Property.  As a result of this transaction, the 
existing lease and royalty arrangements between the two companies on the Kings Valley Property, 
including the net smelter returns and net profits royalties on any lithium project that the company 
developed, were terminated.  WLC holds, indirectly, control and full ownership of the Kings Valley 
Property mining claims and leases, excluding a gold exploration target (on the Albisu property) and a 
20% royalty granted by WEDC to Cameco Global Exploration II Ltd solely in respect of uranium (the 
"Uranium Royalty").

The UMs which are subject to the Lease authorize WLC to develop and mine minerals which are subject 
to location under the Mining Law of 1872, as amended.  The Mining Law does not explicitly authorize 
the owner of an unpatented mining claim to sell minerals, which are minerals that are leasable under 
the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended.  WLC has initiated discussions with the BLM to 
determine the legislative and regulatory authority for its processing and sale of the potassium sulphate 
which will be a byproduct of WLC's production of lithium which is a mineral locatable under the Mining 
Law of 1872.  The matter has not been formally determined.

In addition to the Uranium Royalty and those national, state and local rates identified in 4.3, the Kings 
Valley Property is subject to the following royalties, back-in rights, payments, and encumbrances:  

• Orion Mine Finance Fund I (f.n.a RK Mine Finance (Master) Fund II L.P.) has a gross revenue 
royalty on the King Valley Property in the amount of 8% of gross revenue until aggregate 
royalty payments equal $22 million have been paid, at with time the royal will be reduced to 
4.0% of the gross revenue on all minerals mined, produced or otherwise recovered.  WLC 
can at any time elect to reduce the rate of the royalty to 1.75% on notice and payment of 
$20 million to Orion;  

• R. McClintick and K. McClintick, Trustees of the Rick and Keel, E. McClintick Living Trust, hold 
a net smelter return royalty of 1.5% on production from the U 17-20 UMs.  The royalty 
provides for an advance payment of $1,785 annually, which payments will be credited 
against royalty payments otherwise payable; and  

• Uravada LLC holds a net smelter return royalty of 3.0% on production from the U 21-22, 24, 
44, Uravada 23, 25-30, 46-56 (even), and 61-69 UMs.  The royalty provides for an advance 
payment of $50,000 annually, which payments will be credited against royalty payments 
otherwise payable. 

4 . 5  E N V I R O N M E N T A L  L I A B I L I T I E S  

Other than an accrued decommissioning obligation at the Stage I Lens of approximately $170,000, no 
environmental liabilities are known to exist at the Kings Valley Property.  

4 . 6  P E R M I T T I N G  

The Stage I Lens has been the subject of various early stage exploration programs.  However, there has 
been no historical mine development or production within the project area boundaries, and therefore 
no mine workings or mill tailings are present at the Stage I Lens.  WLC holds a current exploration permit 
in good standing, and has done so in each year since 2006, and also holds all necessary federal and state 
permits and approvals to conduct exploration activities at the Stage I Lens.   

A PoO was submitted to the BLM and the NDEP in May 2008 for an extensive drilling and trenching 
exploration program to further delineate the resources of the Stage I Lens.  That action included 
preparation of an environmental assessment.  A revision to the PoO was filed in November 2009 and 
approved in January 2010.

March 7, 2014, the BLM issued a DR and FONSI for WLC's Kings Valley Mine Final EA.  The DR allows the 
development and operation of the Company's proposed 110-acre Kings Valley hectorite clay project, see 
Section 24. 

On May 1, 2014, and in accordance with 43 CFR 3809 Surface Management Regulations, the BLM 
authorized WLC to proceed with clay extraction according to its Final Plan of Operations and 
Reclamation Plan.  On April 29, 2014, the NDEP BMRR concurrently approved WLC's Final Plan of 
Operations and issued a Final Reclamation Permit.  On April 28, 2014, the MSHA assigned the Kings 
Valley Clay Mine operation an MSHA Mine Identification Number.  On April 10, 2014, the Humboldt 
County Regional Planning Commission unanimously approved WLC's Conditional Use Permit, allowing 
the development of an open pit to extract clay.   

WLC has documentation supporting its rights to the lithium mineralization within the Stage II Lens and 
that all appropriate permits for exploration have been obtained.

Based on information provided to, or researched and reviewed by Tetra Tech as a part of this 
preliminary feasibility study, WLC is approved by the BLM and the NDEP BMRR to conduct mineral 
exploration activities at the Kings Valley Lithium Property in accordance with PoO No. N85255.  

As discussed above, WLC has initiated the process to obtain all necessary federal, state and local 
regulatory agency permits and approvals for the proposed the Project.  This process, which includes the 
completion of environmental and natural resource baseline studies, is described in detail in Section 20 
of this report.

5 . 1  S T A G E  I  

Some information in this section was excerpted from the PAEE (URS 2010), and has been standardized 
for this report.  All subsections have been updated. 

5.1.1 Accessibility 

Access to the project is via the paved US Highway 95, traveling approximately 70 km north from 
Winnemucca, Nevada, to Orovada and then heading west-northwest for 33 km on paved State Highway 
293 toward Thacker Pass to the Project site entrance.  On-site access is via several gravel and dirt roads 
established during the exploration phase. 

5.1.2 Climate 

Northern Nevada has a high desert climate with cold winters (average minimum -3°C in January) and hot 
summers (up to 35-40°C).  Snow is expected from October to May, although it often melts quickly.  
Nearby mining operations operate continuously through the winter.  

5.1.3 Local Resources 

Because of the large-scale mining industry in the Winnemucca area, local resources include all of the 
amenities required for large-scale mining.  The area is about 50 km north of the now depleted Sleeper gold 
mine and 100 km northwest of Twin Creeks, Turquoise Ridge and Getchell gold mines.  Additionally, there 
are several other gold and copper mines in the area which could provide potential access to an experienced 
workforce and adequate support for mining operations.  Most of the workforce may have to be sourced in 
Winnemucca because of the sparse population in the project area.  

5.1.4 Infrastructure 

The existing roads are maintained by the Nevada Department of Transportation and are in good repair.  
The roads are all-season roads but may be closed for short periods due to extreme weather during the 
winter season.  The nearest railroad access is in Winnemucca.  

Adequate electrical power is available and currently there is a 115 kV power line that passes through the 
property.  Work during this preliminary feasibility study has determined this power source to be suitable 
for meeting the project electrical demands for Case 1.  Water rights have been attained by WLC.  
An independent groundwater study is currently under preparation but the results of this study have not 
been completed for use within the Stage I PFS.  It is anticipated from preliminary results from this effort 
that water would be sourced at the Project site; however, this remains to be confirmed. 

There is sufficient space within the current Stage I Lens site to accommodate the processing plant and 
mine support facilities, overburden placement site, anticipated dry TSF, the limited wet TSF, water 
diversions, and containments (see Figure 7.1, Site Map).

5.1.5 Physiography 

The Stage I Lens is oriented roughly east-west in the southern portion of the McDermitt caldera.  
The Project site sits at the southern end of Montana Mountains, with its western border at the divide 
between the Kings River Valley and Quinn River Valley.  Vegetation consists of low lying sagebrush and 
grasslands.  Elevation at the Project site is approximately 1,500 m above sea level.

Part of the information in this section was excerpted from the URS report: NI 43-101 Technical Report 
Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, 
effective date December 31, 2009. 

Access to the project is via paved road (U.S. Highway 95), 100 km north from Winnemucca to Orovada 
and then approximately 40 km WNW on paved State Highway 293 to the project area.  On-site access is 
via numerous gravel and dirt roads, including the last 10 km from State Highway 293.  

Northern Nevada has a high desert climate with cold winters and hot summers.  Snow is expected from 
October to May, although it may melt quickly.  Nearby mining operations operate continuously through 
the winter.  Elevations in the area are 1,524 to 2,150 m.  Vegetation consists of sagebrush and 
grasslands at all elevations.   

Because of the large-scale gold mining industry in the Winnemucca area, local resources include all of 
the amenities required for large-scale mining.  The area is about 50 km north of the now depleted 
Sleeper gold mine and 100 km northwest of Twin Creeks, Turquoise Ridge, and Getchell gold mines.  
Several other gold and copper mines are in the area, providing an experienced work force and adequate 
support for mining operations.  Most of the workers may have to be sourced in Winnemucca because of 
the sparse population in the project area.   

Adequate electrical power is available, but power lines may need to be added and/or upgraded to 
provide power to the project site.  Currently, there is a 115 kV power line that passes through the Kings 
Valley Project site.  Water is available in the region and can be sourced from either the Kings River 
Valley, west of the project, or Queens River Valley located east of the project.  No surface water is 
present at the site.  Roads are all-season and in generally good repair, but may be closed for short 
periods due to extreme weather in the winter.  The nearest railroad access is located in Winnemucca.   

Local access to the Stage II Lens is currently an unimproved gravel road that at times during the winter 
months can be impassable.  This access will require upgrading.

6.1.1 Exploration History 

In 1975 Chevron USA began an exploration program for uranium in the sediments of the McDermitt 
caldera which encompassed the entire caldera.  Early in Chevron's program, the USGS, which had been 
investigating lithium sources, alerted Chevron to the presence of anomalous concentrations of lithium 
associated with the caldera.  In 1978 and 1979 Chevron continued its focus on uranium, but added 
lithium to its assays, began a clay analysis program, and obtained samples for engineering work. 

Results confirmed the high lithium concentrations contained in clays.  From 1980 to 1987, Chevron 
began a drilling program which focused on lithium targets and conducted extensive metallurgical testing 
of the clays to determine the viability of lithium extraction.  In 1985, Chevron undertook a resource 
estimate for a 0.25% Li cutoff.  This estimate is not considered CIM compliant. 

6.1.2 Ownership History 

Chevron leased many of the claims that comprised the lithium project to the J. M. Huber Corporation 
(Huber) in 1986.  In 1991, Chevron USA sold its interest in the claims to Cyprus Gold Exploration 
Corporation.  In 1992, Huber terminated the lease.  It appears that Cyprus Gold Exploration Corporation 
allowed the claims to lapse and provided much of the exploration data to Jim LaBret, one of the claim 
owners from which they had leased claims.  Western Energy Development Corporation (WEDC), a 
Nevada corporation, leased LaBret's claims in 2005, at which time LaBret provided WEDC access to the 
Chevron data and to core and other samples that were available. 

Pursuant to an agreement signed on December 20, 2007 between Western Energy Development 
Corporation ("WEDC"), a subsidiary of Western Uranium Corporation, and WLC (which was then a 
subsidiary of Western Uranium Corporation), WEDC leased to WLC the Lith and Neutron claims for the 
purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation.  This agreement granted WLC exclusive rights to 
explore, develop, and mine or otherwise produce any and all lithium deposits discovered on the claims, 
subject to royalty payments.  The leased area, at this time, included the entirety of the Stage I Lens and 
included 1,378 claims that covered over 11,000 ha.  

Lithium deposits to be exploited included, but were not limited to, deposits of amblygonite, eucryptite, 
hectorite, lepidolite, petalite, spodumene and bentonitic clays.  Rights to all other mineral types, 
including base and precious metals, uranium, vanadium and uranium- or vanadium-bearing materials or 
ores were expressly reserved by WEDC.  The term of that lease agreement was 30 years and granted to 
WLC the exclusive right to purchase the unpatented mining claims comprising a designated discovery, 
subject to the royalty and other rights to be reserved by WEDC and subject to WLC's obligations under 
the deed to be executed and delivered by WEDC on the closing of the option (PAEE, URS 2010). 

In July, 2008, Western Lithium USA Corporation ceased to be wholly owned by Western Uranium 
Corporation and became an independent publicly traded company.

May 2014 6-2 

Effective February 4, 2011, Western Uranium Corporation, WEDC, Western Lithium Corporation and 
WLC entered into an agreement for the purchase by Western Lithium Corporation from WEDC of the 
royalties and titles for the Kings Valley mineral property.  

In March 2011, the parties completed the transaction for the sale by WEDC to Western Lithium 
Corporation of the royalties and titles constituting all of the Kings Valley mineral property.  As a result of 
this transaction, the existing lease and royalty arrangements between the two companies on the Kings 
Valley property, including the Net Smelter Returns and Net Profits Royalties on any lithium project that 
the company developed, were terminated.  Western Lithium Corporation, wholly owned by WLC, holds 
control and full ownership of the Kings Valley property mining claims and leases, excluding a gold 
exploration target (on the Albisu property) and a 20% royalty granted by WEDC to Cameco Global 
Exploration II Ltd solely in respect of uranium. 

6.1.3 Environmental Work History 

WLC initiated an environmental and natural resources baseline study program for the Project in 2007.  
The purpose of this on-going program is to collect data for various resources that will support the 
completion of the overall permitting and approval process, and the associated environmental 
documentation program.  Section 20.1 identifies the individual studies that have been completed to 
date; ongoing and planned studies; and regulatory agency consultation activities. 

6.1.4 Metallurgical Testwork History 

From late 2007 to May 2008, WLC completed drilling 37 core holes (4,861.98 m) and eight reverse 
circulation (RC) holes (1,798.63 m) in the Stage I Lens.  WLC performed a mineralogical study of the 
mineralization in 2008 (Hudson, 2008).  That study identified the presence of hectorite as well as 
bitumen in the deposit.  WLC determined the density of six samples from the Stage I Lens.  

Metallurgical testwork was performed on samples from the Project deposit by investigators, including 
Chevron Research Company, United States Bureau of Mines (USBM), and Hazen Research (Hazen).  
Bench-scale laboratory studies were performed by Hazen to examine lithium extraction from a 
composite ore sample with about 0.35% lithium prepared from drill core samples supplied by WLC.  
Most of the work completed was derived from the work conducted by Chevron.  Hazen found that wet 
attritioning is effective in liberating the clay fines from the ore.  Hazen also developed methods to 
separate lithium-rich fines from gangue and to reduce carbonate concentration to less than 0.5% by 
weight.  Acid plugging, curing, and water leaching were then used to extract lithium from the clay fines, 
with an acid dose of approximately 473.21 kg per tonne of ore required for 95% extraction.  The results 
obtained by Hazen were consistent with those found by Chevron.  

In late 2008, metallurgical testwork was performed by Kappes Cassiday & Associates (KCA) on samples 
from the Kings Valley lithium deposit by various researchers, based in principle on the USBM report, 
Lithium and Its Recovery from Low-grade Nevada Clays (USBM Bulletin 691, 1988).  USBM investigated 
several extraction techniques and pursued two options, gypsum-limestone roast and chlorinating roast.  
Selecting samples from two different areas of the McDermitt caldera, USBM performed successful 
preliminary tests of gypsum-limestone roasting, which led to extensive batch-roast studies and further 
to larger-scale roasting in a rotary furnace.  Chlorination was also tested, but proved to be economically 
unfeasible.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 6-3 

The KCA testwork was based on the prior work completed by USBM.  Samples, obtained in August 2008 
and October 2008 from recent drilling campaigns included both oxidized ore (comprising an estimated 
15 to 20% of the deposit) and unoxidized ore (comprising 80 to 85% of the deposit).  An analysis of 
possible ore upgrading techniques resulted in selecting wet attritioning followed by wet screening.  
Subsequent calcining of the ore with a mixture of limestone and gypsum was performed, followed by 
water leaching to recover soluble lithium and other alkali sulfates.  Results confirmed that the USBM 
process for recovery of lithium from this ore was technically viable.

The information in this section was excerpted from the URS report: NI 43-101 Technical Report 
Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, 
effective date December 31, 2009. 

Chevron began exploration for uranium in the McDermitt caldera area in 1975.  In September 1977, 
personnel of the U.S. Geological Survey alerted Chevron to the presence of anomalous concentrations of 
lithium associated with volcaniclastic moat sediments within the McDermitt caldera.  Drill cuttings from 
rotary percussion drill holes drilled in September on radiometric anomalies were also analyzed for 
lithium.  One hundred and forty feet of hole MJB-7-4 averaged 0.278% lithium and 85 feet of MJB-7-5 
averaged 0.236% lithium.  These results confirmed the presence of significant lithium hosted by a 
massive, green claystone within the moat sediment section. 

In 1978 and 1979, Chevron's activities focused on the uranium resource hosted by volcanic rocks in the 
caldera and drilling to evaluate selected tailings disposal sites.  The drilling focused on evaluating the 
thickness of the clays, obtaining samples of the clay for engineering analysis, and further investigating 
the lithium resource potential.  Results were encouraging with respect to the concentration and 
consistency of the lithium contained in the clays. 

In 1980 and 1981, Chevron drilled four core holes to obtain uncontaminated and undisturbed samples to 
more effectively determine lithium grades and coincident volcaniclastic stratigraphy.  A portion of the 
core was sent to Chevron Research Company (CRC) for evaluating an economic process for extracting 
lithium from the clays.   

From 1982 through 1987, Chevron drilled an additional 223 holes on lithium targets and conducted 
extensive metallurgical testing of the hectorite ores to determine amenability of the ores to extraction 
of lithium.  Approximately 370 1–3 meter-deep auger holes were drilled in 1982; one sample from each 
hole was analyzed for lithium assays. 

In 1985, Chevron produced polygonal estimates of the Li resources on their properties at Kings Valley 
(Table 6.1).  A cutoff grade of 0.25% lithium, minimum thickness of 1.52 m, and a minimum 9.0 ft% 
Grade x Thickness (GT) were used for the estimate.  The tonnage factor used was 1.8 g/cm3.  
This estimate is not compliant with CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (2005) as required by NI 43-101 and is included here for historical purposes only.  Because of 
the lack of documentation of criteria used to classify the historical estimate, AMEC was unable to 
compare the categories used by Chevron to current CIM Definition Standards and has thus not reported 
the tons and grade of the deposits in the Stage II Resource Estimate.

Chevron leased many of the claims that comprised the lithium project to the J. M. Huber Corporation 
(Huber) in 1986.  In 1991, Chevron U.S.A., sold its interest in the claims to Cyprus Gold Exploration 
Corporation.  In 1992, Huber terminated the lease and it appears that Cyprus Gold Exploration 
Corporation allowed the claims to lapse and provided much of the exploration data to Jim LaBret, one of 
the claim owners from which they had leased claims.

There is no record indicating that Chevron considered potassium as a resource.  From 1992 to 2005, 
there is no record of any activities on the project. 

Western Energy Development Corp. (WEDC), a Nevada corporation, leased LaBret's claims in 2005 at 
which time, LaBret provided WEDC access to the Chevron data and to core and other samples that were 
available.  In 2005, WEDC staked 1634 federal lode claims covering the area that was prospective for 
lithium, but subsequently dropped 320 of these claims.  The claims cover much the same area as the 
original Chevron claims.  WEDC compiled the Chevron exploration data and undertook preliminary 
marketing studies during 2007. 

In 2007, WLC was incorporated for the purpose of lithium exploration and exploitation.  WEDC provided 
the Chevron exploration data and access to available geological materials to WLC as part of a lease 
agreement for the properties described in Section 4.2 of the Stage II Resource Estimate between the 
two companies.  Those data form the basis for that report.   

From late 2007 to May 2008, WLC completed 37 core holes (4,861.98 m) and eight reverse circulation 
(RC) holes (1,798.63 m) in the PCD lens.  WLC performed a mineralogical study of the mineralization in 
2008 (Hudson, 2008).  That study confirmed the presence of hectorite in the deposit.  WLC determined 
the density of six samples from the Stage I Lens. 

Additionally, beginning in the second half of 2009, WLC drilled 38 diamond drill holes in the 
Stage II Lens, as well as took 22 samples for density determination.  The samples were sent to ALS-
Chemex for analysis, using a four-acid digestion and ICP-MS for a full suite of values, including Li, K, and 
Na; F was assayed using two different fusion methods, depending on the sample value.

The USBM bulletin discusses the USBM investigation for recovering a marketable lithium product from 
the montmorillonite-type clays of the McDermitt Caldera.  The information presented in this publication 
is not considered to be compliant with Common Information Model (CIM) standards as required by 
NI 43-101, but is included here for historical purposes.  Although this bulletin may not meet the 
standards of CIM, WLC believes the scientific basis of the report to be of sufficient quality to use as a 
starting point for establishing the metallurgical test program used in developing the process design. 

6.2.1 Review of Chevron Research Company Test Work 

In the 1980's, Chevron Resources undertook considerable metallurgical and processing studies to 
develop a procedure that could economically extract lithium from hectorite clay.  Chevron experimented 
by improving the grade of the ore through upgrading techniques. 

Chevron then tested lithium dissolution procedures which included dilute sulfuric acid leach, acid pug 
followed by water leach, and ion exchange.  Chevron concluded that the most economical method 
would be to use the sulfuric acid pug followed by water leach method.  The basis for selection included 
overall acid consumption and lithium recovery. 

6.2.1.1 Sampling 

The sample used for the test work reported here is a drill core sample denoted MJB 80-20C by Chevron.  
The exact location of the drill hole was not apparent from the information provided.  

6.2.1.2 Upgrading 

Chevron Research Company ran studies that concluded that dry grinding followed by separation of the 
fines coupled with upgrading of the coarse material gives the best overall upgrading of the ore.  
The ground material was screened into three fractions; +100 #, –100 # +400 #, and –400.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 6-6 

The –100 #/+400 # fraction from the grinding tests were then sent to an oleic acid float treatment to 
reduce the amount of acid-consuming carbonate in that material along with upgrading the lithium 
content.  The –400 # fraction from the grinding step was mixed with the concentrate from the oleic acid 
float tests to obtain a concentrate material for further testing.  

Chevron found that the final concentrate contained 75% of the original weight of the material and had a 
lithium assay of 0.37%.  The head assay for lithium was 0.34%.  A positive result from these studies was 
the fact that the carbonate content in the concentrate was significantly lower than in the feed material.  
This aided in reducing overall acid consumption in the subsequent stages.  

6.2.1.3 Acid Pugging, Curing and Water Leaching 

The acid pugging stage of the process involved intimately mixing the ore with concentrated sulfuric acid 
at high solids content (55–67% weight/weight percentage, or w/w).  The mixture was then allowed to 
cure so that the acid reacted with the ore.  The cured mixture formed a solid mass which was ground up 
and leached to solubilize the lithium.  The best results showed that 85% of the lithium was extracted 
while consuming 915 pounds of acid per ton of ore.   

6.2.2 Review of Hazen Research Test Work 

Hazen Research was commissioned by WLC to examine processing options for the King's Valley lithium 
ore.  Physical upgrading followed by sulfuric acid pugging, curing, and water leaching to extract lithium 
were studied.  Most of the work completed was derived from the work conducted by Chevron Research 
Company described in Section 6.6.1.  A bench-scale laboratory study was conducted to examine lithium 
extraction from a composite ore sample with about 0.35% lithium prepared from drill core samples 
supplied by WLC.  

6.2.2.1 Samples 

The composite sample prepared by Hazen for the work involving the upgrading and acid pugging was 
composed of drill core from hole WLC-10 from 40 to 100 feet with a head assay of 0.37% lithium. 

6.2.2.2 Upgrading Test Work 

Upgrading was designed to accomplish two goals: increase the lithium concentration while maintaining 
reasonable lithium recoveries and remove a substantial amount of calcite and other gangue material 
which would otherwise result in excessive consumption of acid in subsequent processing steps.  
The following physical processing steps were studied in the effort to achieve these goals: 

1. Attrition or lightly grind the gangue material to disaggregate and liberate the clay.  The goal 
was to keep the gangue relatively coarse. 

2. Screen the material to remove the coarse gangue. 

3. Use elutriation or cylconing to separate the lithium-rich clay fines from the coarser gangue 
material, which is low in lithium. 

4. Use fatty acid (oleic acid) flotation for calcite removal. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 6-7 

After optimizing the operating parameters, Hazen found that wet attrition is effective for liberating the clay 
fines from the ore.  In one experiment, 82% of the lithium reported to 53% of the mass in a –10 micron 
(~500 #) fraction after attrition.  The lithium grade almost doubled to 0.6%.  

After attrition, Hazen found that physical separation of the gangue on the basis of particle size, or by 
particle size and flotation for calcite, concentrates the lithium and rejects calcite and other gangue.  
Elutriation or another size classification method, such as cycloning, will separate the lithium-rich fines 
from the coarser gangue.  Flotation with oleic acid was able to reduce the carbonate concentration to 
less than 0.5% (w/w) from 3.5 to 4%.  Desliming after attritioning rejected over 90% of the carbonate 
but with higher lithium losses.  When upgrading by particle size, there is a tradeoff between lithium 
recovery and carbonate rejection.  

In the course of the project, URS has also developed a flow sheet using the upgrading process from the 
Hazen Research study.  This work was put on hold until trade-off studies could be completed against 
filterability and capital for filtration equipment. 

6.2.2.3 Acid Pugging, Curing and Water Leaching 

The fines from the upgrading work were dried and blended to make a composite.  The composite 
assayed 0.72% Li and 0.72% carbonate.  All acid pugging and leaching experiments were performed on 
this composite.  

The main variable examined in the acid pugging, curing, and water leaching work was acid dose, 
although variations in the amount of water added was also tried.  In the laboratory procedure, water 
(if used) was added to dry clay in a porcelain mortar, followed by concentrated sulfuric acid.  
The mixture was worked with a pestle until homogeneity was achieved.  The mixture was then covered 
and heated (cured) in an oven at 150°C for three hours.  After curing, the solids were usually a dry hard 
mass.  The solids were then lightly ground and water-leached for 30 minutes at 10% (w/w) solids.  
The lithium sulfate and other soluble sulfates dissolved in the leach.  

It was found that this process was effective in extracting lithium from the clay fines, but an acid dose of 
near 1150 lb acid per ton of ore was required for 95% extraction.  It was also revealed that extraction of 
lithium was nearly proportional to the acid dose.  Overall results obtained by Hazen were consistent 
with those found by Chevron Research Company.

The Project in Humboldt County, Nevada, lies in the western and southern part of the McDermitt 
caldera complex (Figure 7.1), a Miocene volcanic feature that comprises a total surface area of about 
30 km × 40 km.  On the basis of U.S. Geological Survey publications (e.g., Rytuba and Glanzman, 1979), 
the caldera complex was considered to be formed of multiple nested calderas.  More recently, the 
complex has been described as a single caldera formed during eruption of a zoned ignimbrite (Castor 
and Henry, 2000; Starkel and others, 2009). 

Volcanic activity at the McDermitt caldera complex has yielded precise 40Ar/39Ar ages of 16.5 to 
16.1 million years ago and was characterized by extrusion of early metaluminous and peralkaline 
rhyolite, followed by eruption of a voluminous ignimbrite with peralkaline rhyolite to metaluminous 
dacite compositions (Castor and Henry, 2000, Starkel and others, 2009).  After collapse, the central part 
of the caldera complex was the site of resurgence, and a moat-like lake formed between this resurgent 
dome and the caldera walls.  The lake was the site of deposition of volcaniclastic sediments that now 
form a nearly continuous ring within the caldera (Figure 7.1).  The Kings Valley lithium deposits are lens-
shaped bodies hosted by the moat sedimentary rock.

7.2.1 McDermitt Caldera 

The Project deposits occur in a north-south zone that coincides with the western and southern part of 
the McDermitt caldera moat sedimentary rock.  The most southerly deposit, known as the Stage I Lens, 
is considered to be the primary target and is best defined.  The Stage II to Stage 5 lenses lie to the north. 

7.2.2 Stage I Lens 

The Stage I Lens is largely beneath alluvial cover at Thacker Pass.  It lies at relatively low elevations in 
moat sedimentary rocks that are thought to have been separated from the topographically higher 
deposits to the north by late down-to-the south normal faulting (Castor and Henry, 2000).  Exposures of 
the moat sedimentary rocks at Thacker Pass are limited to a few drainages and isolated road cuts; 
therefore, the stratigraphic sequence in the deposit is primarily derived from core drilling. 

The moat sedimentary section, which has a maximum drilled thickness of about 160 m, consists of 
alternating layers of claystone and volcanic ash.  The claystone comprises 40% to 90% of the section.  In 
many intervals, the claystone and ash are intimately intermixed.  The claystones are variably brown, tan, 
gray, bluish-gray and black whereas the ash is generally white or very light gray.  Individual claystone-
rich units may be recognized over lateral distances of more than 152 m although unit thickness can vary 
by as much as 20%.  Ash-rich layers are more variable and appear to have some textures that suggest 
reworking.  All units exhibit finely-graded bedding and laminar textures that imply a shallow lacustrine 
depositional environment. 

Surficial oxidation persists to depths of 15 to 30 m in the moat sedimentary rock.  Oxidized claystone is 
brown, tan, or light greenish-tan and contains iron oxide, whereas the ash is white with some orange-
brown iron oxide.  The transition from oxidized to unoxidized rock occurs over intervals as much as 
4.5 m thick. 

The moat sedimentary section at Thacker Pass overlies intracaldera volcanic rock that has been logged 
as ash-flow tuff, flows and lahars.  A zone of weakly to strongly silicified sedimentary rock, the Hot Pond 
Zone (HPZ), occurs at the base of the moat sedimentary section in nearly every drillhole in the Stage I 
deposit area.  The HPZ rock is locally oxidized, and the underlying volcanic rock is generally oxidized. 

Core from each drillhole has been carefully examined and drill logs have been prepared that record rock 
type, color, accessory minerals, textures and other features of significance.  On the basis of core 
examination, 14 lithologic codes have been recognized (Table 7.1).  The core has mostly been divided 
into sample intervals for chemical analyses delineated on the basis of lithology.  Figure 7.2 shows a 
generalized interpretation of the lithology for core hole WLC-43 which is located roughly in the middle 
of the proposed mine pit area.  For this interpretation, all the claystones (lithologic units 1-6) are 
combined into one lithologic unit.

Figure 7.2:  Interpreted and Simplified Sample Log for Drillhole WLC-43 

 

Most of the moat sedimentary rocks drilled in the Thacker Pass basin contain anomalously high lithium 
contents (> 100 ppm).  Intervals that consist mostly of ash have lithium contents of less than 800 ppm 
whereas intervals dominated by claystone contain more lithium (>1,000 ppm).  Many intervals have very 
high lithium contents (>4,000 ppm).  Intervals with extreme lithium contents (>8,000 ppm) occur locally.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 7-5 

There is no change in lithium content across the boundary between oxidized and unoxidized rock; 
however, the highest lithium grades generally occur in the middle and lower parts of the sedimentary 
rock section. 

The lithium content of the Stage I Lens claystone can generally be predicted by the color and texture of 
the rock, as well as the amount of admixed ash.  Intervals with the highest lithium grades (>4,000 ppm) 
generally contain gray to dark-gray or black claystone with less than 10% ash.  Intervals of bluish-gray 
claystone with low ash content have moderate lithium content (generally 2,500 to 3,000 ppm).  
Intervals of light colored claystone (e.g., tan, light gray, greenish-tan) have lower lithium grades 
(generally 1,500 to 2,500 ppm).  Intervals of mixed claystone and ash are common and have variable 
lithium contents (generally 1,500 to 3,000 ppm) depending on the type of claystone and proportion of 
ash present. 

7.2.3 Stage II Lens 

The Stage II Lens is located approximately 10 km NNW of the Stage I Lens, the southernmost lithium 
mineralized lens in the area.  The Stage II Lens mineralized beds comprises mainly of a dark green 
claystone, at times intercalated with arkose beds; in the NE region of the modeled area a fanglomerate 
body is present.  Figure 7.3 shows an example of a Field Log from hole SP-3.  Lithium-rich beds are 
generally 10 to 60 m thick in most areas, defined as interesting Li grades as greater than 1,500 ppm.  
Alluvium cover is variable, ranging from no cover at all to a maximum of about 6m. 

WLC drilling shows that the average thickness of Li mineralization is thicker than that indicated by 
Chevron data, because, as was the Case in the PCD lens, some of the Chevron holes stopped in 
mineralization.  Figure 7.4 shows a thickness map of the area, for lithium grades greater than 
1,000 ppm.

7.2.4 Mineralogy 

Clay in the Stage I Lens lithium deposit includes two distinctly different types on the basis of chemistry 
and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra.  Clay with XRD spectra that are indicative of smectite occurs at 
relatively shallow depths (less than 30 m bgs) in the Stage I Lens deposit (Castor, 2010).  
Confirmed hectorite clay occurs elsewhere in the McDermitt caldera and has been documented by 
several authors (e.g., Odom, 1992; Rytuba and Glanzman, 1979).  Drill intervals with high lithium 
contents (commonly > 4,000 ppm) contain clay that yields XRD spectra that are more typical for illite 
than smectite (Castor, 2010).  An illite-type clay occurs at moderate to deep depths in the moat 
sedimentary section and locally occurs in intervals that contain as much as 8,000 ppm lithium, higher 
than any analyzed hectorite.  A relatively thin layer of interstratified smectite-illite clay is found between 
the smectite and illite-type clay (Castor, 2010). 

Other minerals in the Stage I Lens deposit claystone include calcite, quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, 
dolomite, and fluorite.  Pyrite and bitumen occur in the claystone below near-surface oxidized rock.  
Ash beds in the Stage I Lens deposit contain quartz and feldspar with local analcime, and minor clay and 
pyrite.  Zeolite minerals are typically present in the north part of the caldera, but analcime is the only 
zeolite present in the Stage I Lens deposit (Glanzman and Rytuba, 1979).

No detailed mineralogical work has been conducted for samples from the Stage II drilling campaign. 

7.2.5 Discussion 

The regional geological setting of these deposits is quite well known and very well understood.  The local 
geological setting and degree of local lithium grade variations are adequately known for the Stage I and 
Stage II areas to allow estimating the resources to the accuracy modeled by the resource classification 
applied.

The information in this section was transcribed in part from the URS report: NI 43-101 Technical Report 
Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, 
effective date December 31, 2009. 

The Kings Valley lithium deposits are part of a small group of lithium-rich clay minerals known as illite 
and smectite and include hectorite [Na0.3(Mg,Li)3Si4O10(F,OH)2].  Hectorite was named for its first 
known source, the Hector Mine, 55 km east of Barstow in San Bernardino, California.  This is the only 
hectorite deposit currently known to be in production; however, other small producers may sporadically 
mine hectorite.  The production is used primarily for specialty clay products.  Lithium is not extracted 
from the clays from Hector.   

Harben and Bates (1984) suggest that the Hector deposits were formed when Pliocene tuff and volcanic 
ash were deposited in a restricted alkaline lake environment on and adjacent to travertine which was 
forming by hot springs emanating along the fault.  The tuff was initially converted to clinoptilolite (a 
zeolite mineral) which, then in turn, was altered to hectorite by hot springs waters rich in lithium and 
fluoride. 

Although no work has been reported on the genesis of the Kings Valley deposits, the geology suggests 
that the deposits occur over the ring fracture zone of the caldera complex.  Post volcanic intrusions 
along those fractures likely powered hydrothermal cells that formed the deposits.  Hydrothermal 
solutions ascended through the volcanic section along the ring fractures and other faults and passed 
through the volcanic section and into the lacustrine environment of the moat.  These ascending fluids 
extracted lithium from the rhyolitic ash flow tuffs and the volcaniclastic sediments that immediately 
overlie the rhyolites.  Glanzman and Winsor (1982) suggest that the fluids were deposited into the 
moat where a lithium-rich gel formed within the lake and precipitated as a stratabound, massive layer of 
Li-rich claystone.  Thin intervals of volcaniclastic sediments were deposited below, within, and above 
this claystone.  Another possibility is that the Li-bearing clays were the product of alteration of in situ, 
clay-rich horizons by the hydrothermal fluids as they traversed the geological column.   

Additional work is required to determine the origin of these deposits.  There are indications in some drill 
holes that the rocks are the product of nearby explosive volcanic eruptions, and that they have not been 
significantly transported by sedimentary processes.  These rocks are altered and locally contain elevated 
Li which suggests that the rocks were deposited and then altered by hydrothermal fluids.  Fine-grained 
volcanic and volcaniclastic material was converted to hectorite-bearing clay beds by that hydrothermal 
event.

The sediments within the Kings Valley lithium deposits host a relatively large concentration of lithium 
compared to most other sources.  Testwork to date has shown that extraction from the deposit is 
economically feasible.  Exploration activities have defined the geology of the deposit, defined the ore 
body and resulted in categories developed for measured, indicated and inferred resources for the 
Stage I and II Lenses of this project

9 .0  EXPLORATION 
9 . 1  S T A G E  I  

Prior to the 2010 drilling campaign, exploration consisted of geological mapping to delineate the limits 
of the sedimentary rocks within the moat and drilling to determine grade and location of mineralization.  
Most of the Project area has been surveyed by airborne gamma ray spectrometry, though this work was 
not done specifically to enhance lithium exploration (PAEE URS 2010).  

Survey work was completed prior to 1980 under Chevron.  A collar survey was completed by WLC for the 
2007-2008 drilling program using a Trimble GPS.  At that time the NAD 83 global reference system was 
used.  Comparing WLC's survey work with that done by Chevron showed near identical results for the 
easting and northings, elevations were off by approximately 3m and were corrected in order to conform 
with earlier Chevron work (PAEE URS 2010).  

Downhole surveys have been performed on selected holes drilled after WLC-24.  Those surveys indicate 
that holes are drilled vertically or very nearly vertical with the exception of hole (WLC 58) which was 
intentionally drilled at 70 degrees from horizontal.  

Exploration work that commenced January 2010 focused on further refining the local stratigraphy and 
ore grades within the deposits.  This work has been done in the form of systematic drilling and is 
covered in detail in Section 10.1.  The drilling (sampling) to date covers an area of some 50 hectares, 
measuring approximately 1000m EW x 500m NS. 

In addition to drilling, WLC developed two test pits (WLT-01 and WLT-02) in January 2010.  The purpose 
of trenching was to obtain large bulk samples for metallurgical testwork.  Alluvium was removed via 
bulldozer and two 4.6 m trenches were dug into the clay deposits.  A total of 15 samples were collected 
for assay.  Intervals were selected to make a composite which would approximate the ore body.  
These composites were shipped to the Outotec GmbH facility in Germany for testwork  

The topographic surface of the Project area was mapped by aerial photography dated July 6, 2010.  
This information was obtained by MXS, Inc. for WLC.  The flyover resolution was 0.35 m.  Ground control 
was established by Desert-Mountain Surveying, a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using Trimble 
equipment.  Field surveys of drillhole collars, spot-heights and ground-truthing were conducted by 
Mr. Dave Rowe, MXS, Inc., a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using Trimble equipment. 

Reserva believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the extent and grade 
distribution of the deposit is reasonably well addressed.  Although some sample bias was detected ti 
earlier RC and Sonic drilling, as described in Section 10, the vast majority (96%) of the drilling was core 
drilling.  Based on observation of the field and logging/sampling procedures, the samples are considered 
to be representative and of reasonable quality.  Based on geological logging data, the location and 
attitude of several faults that offset the base of the deposit were determined and incorporated into the 
overall model.  The data are adequate at this stage to adequately define the local stratigraphy and grade 
of the deposit for mineral resource estimate purposes.

The information in this section is based in part on the corresponding section of the URS report: NI 43-
101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project, Humboldt 
County, Nevada, USA, effective date December 31, 2009. 

Exploration on WLC's Stage II Lens deposit has consisted of geological mapping to delineate the limits of 
the moat volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and drilling to determine the grade and location of 
mineralization.  Some, if not most, of the area has been covered by airborne gamma ray spectrometry, 
but those data are not pertinent to exploration for lithium.  There is no record of other exploration in 
the area.   

Section 6.2 and 10.2 discusses drilling from historical and factual perspectives.  The Chevron database 
includes 283 core, RC, and rotary holes (25,781.8 m).  Records indicate that 268 holes were drilled 
specifically to evaluate the lithium mineralization.  The record is not clear, but it appears that of the 
283 holes in the database, 223 are rotary holes (18,136.2 m), 52 are core holes (5,731.11 m) based on 
the "c" suffix on drill-hole names, eight are reverse circulation holes (1,798.62 m), two are sonic holes 
(153.7 m), and seven are PQ-size core holes for metallurgical samples (233.5 m).  In addition to those 
holes, 370 auger holes (902.5 m) were drilled.  The reason for the auger holes has not been determined.  

Claim surveying for the Chevron holes was performed by Tyree Surveying Company, Albuquerque, New 
Mexico and Desert Mountain Surveying Company, Winnemucca, Nevada (Chevron, 1980).  According to 
Chevron (1980) both companies used theodolites and laser source electronic distance meters to survey 
the claims.  Records indicate that both companies surveyed drill collar locations and it is presumed that 
the same instrumentation was used for those locations.  The reported error was within 0.1515 m 
horizontally and 0.303 m vertically. 

Additionally, WLC has drilled to date 38 diamond drill holes in the Stage II Lens.  Collar surveying for the 
Stage II Lens drill holes was conducted by WLC using a Trimble GPS.  The NAD 83 global reference 
system is used.  WLC compared the locations of several points surveyed by Chevron and found that the 
easting and northing coordinates were more or less identical.  The elevation, however, was found to 
have a systematic difference of 3.11 m.  As a result, 3.11 m was subtracted from the GPS elevations to 
conform to the older surveys. 

WLC surveyed the initial holes in the Stage II Lens campaign (SP-1, SP-2, SP-3, SP-4, SP-5 and SP-6); later, 
after drilling had been completed, holes SP-12, SP-14, SP-21 and SP-23 were also surveyed for down the 
hole deviations.  WLC found that none deviated significantly from the vertical orientation.  Prior work by 
WLC on the Stage I (PCD Lens) had indicated as well that there is little deviation of the holes from 
vertical, supporting the assumption of verticality of all other holes drilled in the Stage II area.  
GSI accepts that the WLC and Chevron holes are vertical as a reasonable approximation, given the 
drilling conditions and the drill hole total depths. 

GSI believes that the exploration techniques used were appropriate and that the extent and tenor of the 
deposits is reasonably well known.  The data are adequate at this time to support inferred and indicated 
mineral resource categories, but additional drilling is required to adequately define the local 
stratigraphy and grade of the deposits in order to improve the confidence of the mineral resource 
estimate.

10.1.1 Type and Extent of Drilling by WLC 

The Stage I Lens (formerly known as the PCD Lens) has been explored for minerals since the 1970s.  
Exploration began with a focus on uranium found in the area, but switched primarily to lithium in the 
late 1980s when Chevron still controlled the mining interests.  WLC drilled 51 core holes between 2007 
and 2009 to expand on the Chevron work.  These holes were drilled with the primary aim of defining 
lithium occurrences in and the geology of the deposit.  Table 10.1 lists a summary of the holes drilled.  
The 37 core holes (WLC-01 thru WLC-37) were drilled specifically for assay and lithologic information.  
The five reverse circulation (RC) holes were drilled to compare drilling techniques.  The RC method 
proved to produce biased assay results in the Stage I Lens area so the method was abandoned.  Seven 
PQ-sized holes were drilled with the intent to provide samples for metallurgical testwork.  Two sonic 
holes were drilled to test the drilling procedure.  It was determined that, while the sonic drill worked 
well, the geologic definition was not comparable to traditional coring.  For more historical information 
on drilling refer to Section 6.1 of this technical report and to the PAEE (URS 2010).

WLC initiated a carefully designed drilling campaign which commenced in January 2010 with the goal of 
further defining measured and indicated resource categories for lithium.  An additional 161 drillholes 
were drilled (WLC-40 thru WLC-200).  Figure 10.1 shows a plan view of drillholes in the Stage I Lens in 
UTM NAD 27 values.  Only those drilled within the easting and northing extents on the map are shown;

The latest drilling campaign began in January 2010 and concluded in June 2011.  All core was logged by a 
geologist on-site who recorded hole ID, easting, northing, elevation, total depth and a lithologic 
description. 

Assays for drillholes bored prior to January 2010 (WLC-01-WLC-37) had analytical work done by 
American Assay Labs (AAL) in Nevada.  The data from AAL's analytical work was not used in the model.  
These holes had assays for lithium repeated during the latest campaign.  These re-assays, as well as all 
subsequent assays, were performed at ALS Minerals in Reno, Nevada.  The assays included results for 
lithium, potassium and sodium and a suite of common elements of interest, while the re-assays were 
analyzed for lithium only.  Samples selected for assay were chosen by the geologist based on lithology 
and color.  

The drillhole spacing was prescribed by the geostatistical methods which included variography to 
determine optimal spacing for inclusion in Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.  The geologic 
model included intervals from holes WLC-01 thru WLC-200 (excluding WLC-180, WLC-183 and WLC -185) 
and WSH-01 and WSH-02 for a total of 197 holes and a total length of approximately 18,500 m.  
Chevron drillholes were excluded from consideration in the model.  Please refer to Section 14.  

All drillholes included in the resource estimate were drilled essentially vertically (88.8 to 90 degrees) 
with the exception of one hole (WLC-58).  All mineralization thicknesses recorded in boreholes are 
treated as true thicknesses. 

All core drillholes were drilled using standard core drilling techniques by Marcus & Marcus Exploration 
Inc.  Holes WSH-1 and WSH-2 were drilled by Boart Longyear Company with a sonic drill.  Core was

stored in a secure workshop while being processed and then locked in CONEX containers or a 
warehouse after sampling was completed. 

10.1.2 Accuracy and Reliability of Results of Drilling 

The author relied on Reserva to ascertain the accuracy and reliability of the most current drilling 
program.  Based on field and core shack observations, Reserva found no factors in the drilling 
techniques, core recovery and sample collection procedures that would materially affect the accuracy 
and reliability of the results.  The procedures and methodologies are consistent with industry standards, 
and the data is considered to be acceptable for estimation purposes.

The information in this section is based in part on the corresponding section of the URS report: NI 43-
101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project, Humboldt 
County, Nevada, USA, effective date December 31, 2009. 

10.2.1 Drilling 

Cuttings from rotary percussion drill holes drilled by Chevron in 1977 were analyzed for lithium.  Those 
drill holes confirmed the presence of interesting grades of lithium hosted by a massive, green claystone 
within the moat sediment section. 

Between 1979 and 1987 Chevron drilled a total of 34 rotary percussion holes, plus 227 core and RC 
holes for initial exploration, to develop lithium targets, and to conduct extensive metallurgical testing.  
Those holes were drilled to test the thickness of the clays, to obtain samples of the clay for engineering 
analysis, and to further investigate the lithium resource potential.  Results were encouraging with 
respect to the level and consistency of the lithium contained by the clays. 

WLC has recovered some of the historical core and has been in the process of re-logging that core.  Of 
the total 283 holes that appear in the database, 227 have lithium assay data.  There are indications that 
an additional six holes were drilled, but there are no locations for those holes.  The record indicates that 
213 rotary percussion and 15 core holes were drilled to test the lithium mineralization between 1980 
and 1984.  These drill procedures were standard for the industry at that time.   

A total of 38 additional HQ (63.5 mm) diameter core holes were drilled by WLC in the Stage II Lens area 
during 2009 (Figure 10.2).  Two of the Chevron core holes, MC-84-81C and MC-84-90C, were re-analyzed 
by WLC during the 2009 campaign, and thus have grades for all four elements of interest, Li, K, F, and 
Na. 

Core or diamond drilling provides better geological information and quality of sample compared to 
percussion and RC methods.  GSI agrees with previous recommendations that only core drilling should 
be used for these deposits.  Although reverse circulation (RC) drilling can reduce drilling costs, at PCD RC 
drilling was shown to produce biased assay results.  WLC did not drill any RC holes at Stage II Lens. 

10.2.2 Logging 

Chevron core was collected from the drills twice a day and descriptively logged by geologists at 
Chevron's field camp.  Chip samples from rotary drills were logged at the drill.  Two composite samples 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report

were collected every five feet and bagged.  The geologist logging the hole made a chip board at the drill 
site.  The chip boards consisted of drill cuttings glued to a 1-inch x 4-inch board whose vertical scale was 
1in = 10ft.  Lithological logging of both core and chip samples stressed lithologic units, their contacts, 
mineralization, alteration and brecciation. 

WLC core is collected at the end of each shift and transported back to the Orovada field office.  Core is 
cleaned and logged for lithology, oxidation, alteration, and core recovery.  All core is photographed with 
high resolution digital cameras, and the samples are stored in a lockable steel storage container.

SECU R ITY 

1 1 . 1  S T A G E  I  

ALS Minerals (ALS) of Reno, Nevada, was used as the primary assay laboratory for the WLC Stage I Lens 
drill program.  ALS is an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory and an ISO/IEC 17025-certified Quality 
Systems Laboratory, and participates in the Society of Mineral Analysts round-robin testing. 

The quality assurance-quality control (QA-QC) protocols used during the Stage I Lens sampling and 
analytical program were developed by Dr. Barry Smee of Smee & Associates Consulting Ltd, an 
international specialist in QA-QC procedures who is familiar with the requirements of NI 43-101.  
Mr. Tim Carew of Reserva International (Reserva), a consulting firm that specializes in ore reserve 
estimation and reporting, evaluated the QA-QC procedures used during the program. 

11.1.1 Sample Preparation  

After the drilled core was brought to the core shed from the field, the boxes of core were logged, 
photographed, cut and sampled by WLC employees and consultants.  The length of the assay samples is 
determined by the geologist by lithology and averaged 1.46 m.  The core was cut in half with diamond 
blade saws and the right half bagged for sampling.  For duplicate samples, one half of the core is cut in 
half again and the two halves are bagged and sampled separately to test sampling and assay precision.  
Each sample was assigned a unique identification number to ensure security and anonymity.  
The samples were picked up by ALS in trucks that arrive from Winnemucca or are delivered to ALS in 
Winnemucca or Reno by WLC employees. 

WLC submitted a total of 11,157 samples to ALS, of which 9,884 were mineralized samples.  
Randomly inserted in the sample stream were 1,273 QA-QC samples, which represent 11 % of the total 
assays.  The QA-QC samples include blanks to test for contamination, high and low grade lithium 
standards to test for accuracy and duplicates to test for precision.  

At ALS, the samples were dried at a maximum temperature of 60°C.  The entire sample was then 
crushed with a jaw crusher to 90% passing a ten mesh screen.  Nominal 250 gram splits were taken for 
each sample using a riffle splitter.  This split is pulverized using a ring mill to 90% passing a 150 mesh 
screen.  These preparation procedures were deemed appropriate by Reserva for the mineralized 
material from the Stage I Lens.

11.1.2 Analysis 

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) combined with atomic emission plasma 
spectroscopy (ICP-AES) are used to provide sensitive analytical capability.  This combination is used to 
provide high precision analyses for precious metal exploration and reconnaissance programs.  
Reserva deems these methods to be appropriate and applicable to the Stage I Lens drill samples.  

Following standard four-acid digestion, ALS's ME-MS61 analytical package initially analyzes the samples 
using ICP-AES to ensure that elevated metal concentrations were not present which would interfere 
with ICP-MS analyses.  Along with a full geochemical suite, this method was used to analyze the three 
elements of commercial interest to the Project: lithium, potassium and sodium. 

11.1.3 Density 

WLC submitted 25 core samples from the Stage I Lens program to ALS for density determination.  
Density was measured by two methods: 24 samples were tested using the paraffin-coated method 
(ASTM Designation C914-95), while one sample was tested using the method described in ASTM C127-
04, a test for aggregate materials.  Both are standard methods.  The material was weighed, the weights 
recorded and then the samples were dried at 75º C for 24 hours.  The dry material was weighed again 
and the weight recorded.  A rock density test was then performed on the dry material using a wax 
immersion procedure.  Table 11.1 shows the dry density values that were used in the resource model.

 Note that dry density is the standard reference for density measurements for industrial minerals. 

11.1.4 Quality Control  

The QA-QC protocol included analyses of blank, duplicate and standard samples. 

The QA-QC program was set up so that at least 10% of all samples are checks or tests against the 
laboratory assays.  ALS analyzed samples in batches of 40, with six of those samples being ALS standards 
and controls.  In addition, WLC randomly inserted two standards (one low grade and one high grade 
lithium), one duplicate and one blank in every 34 samples.  Approximately 12% of all WLC samples were 
QA-QC checks.  

Adhering to the QA-QC program developed by Dr. Smee (2010), WLC identified a small number of assay 
samples from ALS that were below the criteria established within acceptable limits.  These QA-QC 
elements included core sample duplicates; high and low grade standards for lithium and blanks of 
dolomite.  The pulps or coarse rejects of these 76 samples were re-tested and analyzed by ALS, including 
an average of 10 samples above and below the questionable result.  ALS compiled reports and found 
that there were a few samples that were mislabeled by the lab.  Certificates were re-issued by the assay

company to correct for the sample switches.  Generally, the remaining QA-QC samples delivered assay 
results that were similar to the original results, which indicate possible errors in sampling, handling and 
processing.  In total, 6% (76 of 1,273) of the QA-QC samples did not conform to the established criteria. 

During the QA-QC process undertaken by WLC, an error was observed in the high grade lithium 
standards where 17% of the standards had a higher ppm rate than was expected by three standard 
deviations (SD).  ALS began using a new higher grade lithium standard to compensate for the 
discrepancy.  WLC re-assayed the highest 16 lithium values for drillholes WLC-01 through WLC-37 and 
WLC-40 through WLC-200.  Similar samples were sent to both ALS Reno (for a blind repeat test) and 
Activation Laboratories (Actlabs), Ancaster, Ontario, Canada, for lithium analysis.  Of the 16 re-assays, 
14 had lower and two had higher lithium values, with the largest difference being 11% less.  The overall 
difference of the original and the repeat assay values for ALS was lower by 5%.  The difference between 
the ALS re-assays and Actlabs was 3% lower.  Dr. Smee concluded that the overall deposit estimates may 
be lower by at most 2-3%, which is considered within industry standards. 

As an added QA-QC measure, Actlabs was chosen to run assays on duplicate pulps produced by ALS for 
comparison to ALS assay results.  A total of 112 random pulp samples were sent to Actlabs in April 2011.  
The data analyzed by Dr. Smee was found to comply with industry standards, being within 3% of the 
assay values returned by ALS. 

11.1.4.1 Blank Samples  

Blank samples composed of dolomite are used to check for possible contamination during sample 
preparation and analysis.  The dolomite was chosen because it is known to have low lithium content and 
is therefore a good indicator of contamination from one sample to another during crushing and 
assaying.  The raw dolomite is not an established laboratory standard and was obtained from a mine in 
Winnemucca, Nevada.  The warning limit of 100 ppm was determined by Dr. Smee as five times the 
average concentration of the blank of 20 ppm lithium.  There were 314 blanks analyzed for the Stage I 
program or approximately 3% of the total number of assays sent for analysis.  Sixteen blank samples 
reported anomalously high lithium.  All non-conforming samples were submitted for re-run 
(See Section 11.1.5 for details).  

The practical detection limit for both ICP-MS and ICP-AES was reported at 0.2 ppm by the lab.  Since the 
range of lithium values that WLC considers to be the low range of economic interest (1,000 to 
2,000 ppm) is 10 to 20 times the practical detection limit, Reserva does not consider this to be a 
significant issue.  Figure 11.2 shows blank assay results against lithium values represented on the y-axis.  
Non-conforming samples (i.e., those above the red 100 ppm limit line) were re-analyzed by ALS.  
These results were found to be accurate.

Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 11-5 

 
Figure 11.2:  Lithium Concentration of Blanks 

(Gray line indicates the warning limit for lithium) 

Five percent of the blanks (16 of 314 samples) were above the WLC QA-QC warning limit.  The samples 
were re-run by ALS and, again, determined to be accurate values.  High values may indicate 
contamination in the crushing process or an anomalously high concentration of lithium in the given 
sample.  Reserva considers the amount of contamination suggested by the blanks analyses to be 
acceptable.  

11.1.4.2 Duplicate Samples 

Pulp samples for duplicate analyses were prepared in an identical manner as the non-duplicate samples.  
A total of 316 sets of duplicates were submitted "blind" to ALS.  The lithium concentrations for these 
duplicates are shown in Figure 11.3.  

Duplicate samples provide information about the precision of the sampling and analytical procedure.  
Precision can be estimated by calculating the average relative error of the duplicate pairs.  
WLC considers the duplicate assay precision to be inaccurate if the average relative error between two 
duplicate samples is 500 ppm or more.  

Twenty-two outliers (7% of the duplicate sets) did not meet the relative error criteria and were re-
examined by ALS.  The re-analyzed values were within 5% of the original value.  Poor duplicate 
replication can indicate lack of precision in all phases of the sampling procedures.  Potential causes 
include errors introduced during sampling (i.e., mislabeled sample, splitting) or during analytical testing.  
Figure 11.3 shows the laboratory performance results for duplicate samples.

Note: The heavy blue line represents 1:1 equivalency.  The thin line is a linear regression curve that shows near 1:1 equivalency for all duplicate 
pairs. 

Overall, duplicates show good correlation to original samples.  

11.1.4.3 Standards  

Two standards consisting of lithium-bearing clays from the Project area were used for the Stage I Lens 
drilling program: a low-grade standard (LG) with a certified value of 3,526 ppm lithium, and a high-grade 
standard (HG) with a certified value of 4,470 ppm lithium.  These values were based on round-robin 
results from four analytical laboratories: Kappes, Cassiday & Associates, Reno, NV; ALS Minerals, Reno 
NV; Acme Labs, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; and ActLabs, Ancaster, Ontario, Canada.  

To certify the low and high grade standards, a round-robin was completed in June 2010 in which ten 
standards of each grade were sent to six labs for testing.  The resulting assays were analyzed and 
calculated to determine an average lithium, potassium, sodium and fluorine value for each standard.  
The results from two of the labs, seen as two clusters at bottom left in Figure 11.4 were discarded 
because they were not deemed to be compatible with the analytical methods employed.  The average of 
the four labs that gave similar analytical results was used to calculate the certified values. 

Three hundred and nine LG and 320 HG standards, representing 6% of the entire sample program, were 
inserted randomly into the sample stream to evaluate analytical accuracy.  These standards were used

Note: As determined by four labs (round robin) on the left and by ALS on blind standards inserted in drill sample batches (lab data) on the right. 

By identifying results that deviate more than three standard deviations (SD), ALS has developed in-house 
controls to better evaluate the lithium samples.  Figure 11.4 shows that the data was trending below the 
-3 SD line at the beginning of the program.  By identifying these samples that deviate with the WLC QA-
QC program and having ALS re-analyze them, the assays became more accurate.  In the middle of the 
program, the assays began to drift above the +3 SD line.  The upward drift has been corrected by 
introduction of a new higher grade lithium standard that ALS has recently inserted into their QA-QC 
program.  The low grade lithium standard did not drift above and below the 3 SD lines because the 
lithium ppm of the standards that the laboratory used was close to WLC lithium standards from the 
beginning.

11.1.5 Discussion of QA-QC  

When samples that deviated from the accepted criteria were identified, these samples as well as a batch 
of 10 to 20 samples that are run before and after that sample, were re-analyzed to check for accuracy.  
Samples were re-analyzed using the pulps or coarse rejects that had been securely stored at the ALS 
warehouses in Winnemucca or Reno.  Re-analysis values generally reported similar lithium ppm results 
compared to the original assay values with a margin of difference between zero and ±10%. 

The WLC QA-QC program used standard samples obtained from the Project area, duplicate pulp samples 
and laboratory blanks to determine the precision and accuracy of the laboratory results.  Dr. Smee 
monitored the data throughout the Stage I Lens drilling program.  A final review of the data was 
performed by Dr. Smee on August 20, 2011 and he concluded: "The Kings Valley analytical data appears 
to conform to the requirements of NI 43-101 Best Practices.  The Li data is accurate and free from 
contamination.  The sampling precision is within Industry Best Practices expectations." 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 11-9 

Reserva reviewed the data and concurs that both the precision and accuracy of lithium analysis for the 
Stage I Lens are acceptable. 

The total number of blank, duplicate and standard samples analyzed by the laboratory was 11% of the 
total samples assayed.  There are additional checks that are being recommended for future drilling 
programs.  These include: 

• Check coarse duplicates (after first crush, usually -10 mesh material) 

• Send pulp and coarse duplicates to a second laboratory 

• Add a standard in the 1,500 to 2,500 ppm Li range (to ensure adequate accuracy around the 
presumed economic cutoff grades) 

• Add of a potassium standard (obtained from the Stage I area) 

Finally, Reserva recommended that the protocols and procedures for QA-QC be compiled and made part 
of an overall QA-QC document for the Project, to include field sampling practices, sample preparation 
and assaying protocols, laboratory QA-QC and database validation.  

11.1.6 Security  

WLC stores core from the current drill program in a secure core logging/sampling facility that is locked 
when authorized personnel are not present and until they are shipped to the assay laboratory. 

Current WLC security is considered adequate and meets industry standards.  The possibility of significant 
tampering with samples in the custody of WLC is unlikely because of the amount of lithium required to 
significantly change the tenor of core or cuttings samples.  Reserva recommends that all future sampling 
programs employ an expanded sample security protocol that includes formal chain of custody 
documentation.  The security procedures should be part of a larger QA-QC program to ensure consistent 
practices along the entire sequence of processes, from the field to the building of the electronic 
database.

Most of the information presented in this section is based on the corresponding section of the URS 
report: NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley 
Project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, effective date December 31, 2009.  The text has been 
standardized and updated for this report.  

11.2.1 Sample Preparation – Chevron  

Few records of sample preparation procedures exist for the project.  Hand-written notes indicate that 
core was split and one-half was archived.  The other half was crushed in a jaw crusher and then split 
"until a single representative sample bag" was obtained.  The mass of the sample is not specified.  
The remainder of the split was retained in labeled bags.   

Chip samples were split and one-half retained.  The second split was prepared as above.  The mass or 
granulometry of the final analytical split is not specified nor has AMEC located records of those data.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 11-10 

Details of crushing, splitting, and pulverization are not provided.  During the time covered by this Cone 
Geochemical Inc. (the primary analytical laboratory) routinely dried the samples at 120oC, crushed to 
10#, split 150 g minimum with a riffle splitter, and pulverized to 150 # with a steel ring and puck mill 
unless otherwise directed by their customer.  There is no record of variance from this procedure for 
these samples.   

The record suggests that sample splitting and bagging was performed by Chevron employees and that 
the entire sample was sent to the analytical laboratory for final preparation and analysis.  There is no 
indication in the record that company employees were involved with final sample preparation. 

11.2.2 Sample Preparation – WLC 

WLC has used ALS Chemex (ALS) of Reno, Nevada as their primary assay laboratory for their Stage II Lens 
2009 drill campaign.  ALS is an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory, also an ISO/IEC 17025-certified 
Quality Systems, and participates in the Society of Mineral Analysts round robin testing. 

Sample preparation at ALS begins with drying the sample at a typical 110-120 °C.  Then, the entire 
sample is crushed with a roll crusher to 90% passing -6 #.  A nominal 250 g split is taken using a riffle 
splitter, which is pulverized using a ring mill to 90% passing -150 #.  These preparation procedures are 
deemed appropriate for the mineralized material from Stage II Lens. 

11.2.3 Analysis – Chevron  

Samples were analyzed for Li at Cone Geochemical, Inc. (Cone) and Skyline Labs, Inc. (Skyline) by 
dissolving 0.1 g of sample in boiling HF-HNO3-HClO4 boiled to dryness.  The residue was then dissolved in 
6N HCl, diluted to 100 ml with H2O, and read on an atomic absorption spectrometer (AA).  This four acid 
digestion is an industry standard procedure.  Skyline experimented with a number of other procedures, 
but the record indicates that they used the four acid digestion followed by AA determination as the 
primary analytical procedure.  In most cases, Li was reported as ppm, but in some cases, Li2O was 
reported as percent.  In the database, Li2O was converted to Li (ppm).   

A small number of samples were analyzed for As, Sb, Au, Ag, Zn, Mo, and MgO.  Arsenic, Antimony and 
Au were determined by digestion in aqua regia followed by AA.  Mo, Zn, Ag, and MgO were determined 
by four acid digestion followed by AA.  These are standard analytical procedures.   

There were no available certifications for Cone and Skyline at the time the work was performed; 
however, both labs were well respected and widely used by the mining and environmental industries.  

11.2.4 Analysis – WLC  

ALS used Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) combined with conventional atomic 
emission plasma spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to provide extended sensitivity analytical capability.  
While originally designed for very low, geochemical assays for metal exploration and reconnaissance 
programs, GSI believes that these methods can be applied to the Stage II Lens samples.  

After a 4-acid digestion, ALS's ME-MS61 analytical package initially analyzes the samples using ICP-AES 
to pre-screen them, ensuring that no elevated metal concentrations are present.  Elevated metal 
concentrations (defined as >1% of an individual base metal, or >3% cumulative) cannot be introduced to 
a plasma mass spectrometer without causing cross contamination.  Samples showing elevated metal 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 11-11 

concentrations are not analyzed by ICP-MS but will only have ICP-AES data reported.  Along with a full 
geochemical suite, this method was used to analyze three of the four elements of interest to the Stage II 
Resource Estimate, lithium, potassium, and sodium.  Several other elements were also analyzed and 
reported, but they are beyond the scope of this Technical Report.  

Fluorine was analyzed with a specific fusion method, which uses sodium carbonate and potassium 
nitrate to solubilize it in an alkaline environment to prevent volatilization.  The method was calibrated 
differently depending on the concentration: ALS's F-ELE81a method is used when the concentration of F 
is less than 20,000 ppm; F-ELE82a is used for F concentrations greater than 20,000 ppm.  Both methods 
are standard for the industry. 

11.2.5 Density 

WLC submitted 26 core samples from the Stage II Lens to ALS Chemex in Reno Nevada for density 
determinations.  Density was determined by two methods; 21 samples were tested using the paraffin 
coated method (ASTM Designation C914-95), while one other sample was tested using the method 
described in ASTM C127-04, test for Aggregate materials.  Both are standard methods.  The remaining 
4 samples were lost due to disintegration when applying the wax coat or when hydrating. 

The material received was weighed, the weight reported and then dried at 75oC for 24 hours.  The dry 
material was then weighed again and the weight reported.  A rock density test was then completed on 
the dry material using a wax immersion procedure.  Table 11.2 show the in-situ dry density values used 
in the resource model. 

Table 11.2: Density Data Used for Resource Estimation. 

Unit

1.96 
Ash Average 1.99 

Fang. Average 1.91 

Silicified 1.94 

Bedrock Average 2.23 2.23 

 

Density determinations were performed using standard procedures and are adequate for resource 
estimation.  GSI recommends, however, that additional density data be collected during the next round 
of drilling.  

11.2.6 Quality Control – Chevron 

AMEC found four duplicate samples analyzed by Cone in the data provided.  Those results suggest that 
the precision was adequate, but there are insufficient data to reach any meaningful conclusions.   

Otherwise, no independent quality control measures were in place.  During this time period, Cone 
normally analyzed a single duplicate sample and a single standard sample in each analytical batch, but 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 11-12 

those data were not routinely provided to their customers and are thus not part of the record of this 
project. 

These are the only results that can be identified as quality control results.  This is typical of the time 
period although it was normal to send a number of samples to a second laboratory specifically for check 
assays.  Relative to current industry standards, quality control for the Chevron analytical work on this 
project was substandard.  The results were verified by drilling three twin holes in the PCD lens and 
comparing Chevron grades to WLC grades (see Section 11.2.8).  Also, GSI compared globally the Chevron 
Li grades to the WLC grades globally for the claystone unit in the Stage II Lens, and found no significant 
differences. 

11.2.7 Quality Control - WLC 

Quality assurance-quality control (QA-QC) by WLC consists of standard samples, blank analyses, and 
duplicate analyses.  Duplicate analyses were performed on pulp samples at ALS.  Those samples were 
prepared and analyzed in the same batch as the original sample.   

11.2.7.1 Blank Samples 

Blanks are used to check if there is any possible contamination during sample preparation and analyses.  
There were 41 blanks analyzed for the 2009 Stage II Lens campaign, about 3% of the total number of 
assays sent for analysis. 

There are some slightly anomalous values for Li when a practical detection limit 10 times the nominal 
detection limit is defined, in this Case 20 ppm.  This value is also very close to the average Li value of all 
41 blank samples.  Given the range of values for Li that are considered mineralized is 50 to 100 times the 
returned Li values, GSI does not consider this to be a significant issue.

The corresponding graphs for K, F, and Na are shown in Technical Reference F.  In all cases, the same 
conclusions can be made: blank samples appear to indicate that there is little, if any, contamination in 
the analytical process.  GSI considers results from the blanks to all be acceptable.   

11.2.7.2 Duplicate Samples 

Duplicate samples were run from the same pulps as the original assay.  They provide information about 
the precision of the analytical procedure.  Precision can be estimated by calculating the relative error of 
the duplicate pairs: 

1 2
( 1 2) / 2

S S
Relative Error

S S
−

=
+

 

The cumulative frequency of the relative error (RE) is generally calculated for samples containing more 
than 20 times the laboratory-reported detection limit.  Samples near the detection limit tend to result in 
high relative errors due to their low values.  The 80th and 90th percentile relative error are reasonable 
measures often used to estimate precision.  Table 11.3 shows both RE percentiles for all samples and for 
the four elements of interest, Li, K, F, and Na. 

Table 11.3: Relative Errors from duplicate samples, Stage II Lens WLC drilling. 

Element 80th Percentile RE (%) 90th Percentile RE (%) 

Li ±11.1% ±13.1 

K ±10.6% ±14.2 

F ±15.3% ±19.5% 

Na ±18.2% ±22.2% 

 

Figure 11.7 shows the cumulative data frequency vs. RE for Li.  GSI considers that the results from the 
duplicate samples are acceptable for Li and K, the two main economic drivers of the project; the 
precision of F and Na is lower than desired.  

Sodium is not a major project driver, nor is the relative lack of precision of its samples (compared to the 
other elements) expected to impact project economics.  In the Case of F, it does impact metallurgical 
processing.  GSI believes that the relative low precision of the F samples is more related to the use of 
different methods in the analysis.  Also, as shown in Section 14.2, Li and F have a very strong positive 
correlation, which suggests that the F sampled values could be checked or calibrated stochiometrically 
from Li values.  The strong correlation suggests that the only source of F appears to be the same 
hectorite clay.

Figure 11.7: Cumulative Relative Error (%), Lithium. 

Scatterplots and Cumulative RE plots for the other elements are shown in Technical Reference F. 

11.2.7.3 Standards 

WLC used two standards from Li-bearing clays found in the project area, one whose accepted value is 
3,379 ppm Li, and the other 4,217 ppm Li.  Those standards were used in the 2009 exploration work of 
the Stage II Lens and show that the Li data are reasonably accurate.  Figure 11.8 and Figure 11.9 show 
the laboratory performance with respect to the two standards.  Note that there is only sample 
(G911056) that is significantly lower than the standard, which was sent to reanalysis.

11.2.8 Discussion of QA-QC 

QA-QC for the Chevron data is substandard relative to current best practices.  However; twin holes 
drilled by WLC at PCD largely confirmed the location and tenor of the mineralization; also, estimating 
the resources using Ordinary Kriging and the Chevron holes compared to the WLC holes only result in 
very similar estimates; in GSI's opinion, this validates at least globally that the Chevron data are 
adequate to use for future resource work. 

WLC QA-QC utilizes standard samples, duplicate samples, and blanks to check the precision and 
accuracy of the laboratory results.  GSI believes that both the precision and accuracy of Li and K analyses 
for the Stage II Lens is adequate.  Likewise, the F and Na analysis are deemed adequate for resource 
estimation, although further improvements to increase data precision are suggested. 

The total number of check samples analyzed by the laboratory was about 8% of the total samples 
assayed.  There are additional checks that are being recommended for future drilling at the Stage II Lens, 
including checking coarse duplicates (after first crush, usually -10 # material); and sending pulp and 
coarse duplicates to a second laboratory.  Adding also a standard in the 1,500 to 2,500 ppm Li range 
would allow ensuring adequate accuracy around the presumed economic cutoff grades, as well as 
adding standards for K and F, at least, all from moat sediment material from the same McDermitt 
caldera. 

Finally, GSI recommends that the protocols and procedures for QA-QC be written down and made part 
of an overall QA document for the project, to include field sampling practices, sample preparation and 
assaying protocols, laboratory QA/QC, and database validation. 

11.2.9 Security 

11.2.9.1 Chevron 

GSI is not aware of any security measures for samples from this project.  Based on the time-frame in which 
the data were collected, it is reasonable to suspect, as AMEC did, that no formal security measures were in 
place.  Because Li occurs in relatively high concentrations and the generally unavailability of Li compounds 
that could be used to tamper with the samples, AMEC believes that tampering with the samples is unlikely, 
and GSI agrees that this conclusion also applies to Stage II Lens material. 

11.2.9.2 WLC  

WLC stores core from the current drill program in a lockable core logging/sampling facility that is locked 
when no one is present.  Samples are stored in a locked facility until they are shipped to the assay laboratory. 

11.2.9.3 Discussion 

Security during the Chevron drill programs was typical for the time period.  Current WLC security is 
adequate.  The possibility of significant tampering with samples in the custody of Chevron or WLC is 
unlikely because of the amount of Li required to significantly change the tenor of core or cuttings 
samples.  GSI recommends that all future sampling programs have a rigorous sample security, including 
formal chain of custody documentation.  This document should be part of a larger QA-QC document, to 
ensure consistent practices along the entire sequence of processes, from the field to the building of the 
electronic database.

12.1.1 Data Verification Procedures 

For resource estimation purposes Reserva compiled an assay and lithological database from assay 
compilations and summary geological logs supplied by WLC, in spreadsheet format.  WLC maintains a 
tracking chart (Excel spreadsheets) that is used to match analytical data from ALS (provided 
electronically in the form of both Excel spreadsheets, and secured PDF assay certificates) to the intervals 
logged by the geologists, and referenced to duplicate sample tags (Sample ID) stapled into the core 
boxes.  WLC also maintains a master chart to track and manage QA-QC samples, the data provided to 
Reserva was excerpted from this database.  Reserva obtained the certified assay certificates for a 
sample of 10% of the assay intervals, chosen at random, for comparison with the assay data imported 
into the Reserva database.  No discrepancies were noted in this comparison exercise.  Reserva detected 
a relatively small number of inconsistencies in intervals in the import and data validation process, which 
were well below 1% of the total intervals and were corrected with WLC. 

12.1.2 Drill Core and Geologic Logs 

Reserva has reviewed the WLC drill core and logging procedures and finds them to be adequate for the 
study.  Some inconsistent and duplicate geologic codes were discussed with WLC and rectified through 
the use of standard codes, both in ongoing logging and retroactive modification. 

12.1.3 Topography 

The topographic surface utilized in the estimate was provided by WLC in 3D DTM and contour format 
(DWG), and was based on aerial photography dated July 6, 2010.  The flyover resolution was 0.35 m.  
Ground control was established by Desert-Mountain Surveying, a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using 
Trimble equipment.  Field surveys of drillhole collars, spot-heights and, ground truthing was conducted 
by Mr. Dave Rowe, MXS, Inc., a Nevada licensed land surveyor, using Trimble equipment.  A comparison 
of surveyed collars to the topography DTM highlighted inconsistencies for a small number of collars, 
which were investigated and rectified in conjunction with Mr. Rowe. 

12.1.4 Verification of Analytical Data 

Reserva has not undertaken any verification of analytical data in the form of independent samples. 

12.1.5 Data Adequacy 

Based on the various reviews, validation exercises and remedies outlined above, Reserva concludes that 
the data provided is adequate for use in the resource estimate.

Western Energy Development Corp. acquired the physical records of the project from Jim LaBret (now 
deceased), the owner of a number of claims covering uranium prospects in the area.  Those records 
were subsequently transferred to WLC.   

AMEC during the preparation of its initial Technical Report on the property (AMEC, 2008) completed 
extensive work regarding data verification.  This included: 

1. Comparing about 50% of lithological and assay data to the original documentation, which 
included laboratory certificates and summary graphic logs.   

2. AMEC also collected a large sample from the Huber pit and chip from core boxes that were 
subsequently analyzed, confirming the presence and general grade of the samples.  

Based on these tests, AMEC concluded that the grades indicated by Chevron are reasonable and that 
there is no reason not to rely on those data for this evaluation.   

GSI did not consider necessary to repeat the process for the Stage II Lens, as it is part of the same 
deposit and it was surveyed using the same equipment and resulted in the same general conclusions 
with respect to the Chevron holes as for Stage I Lens.

13.1.1 Introduction 

WLC has continued process development for lithium extraction from the Kings Valley clay deposits that 
was originally based on the USBM work in the McDermitt caldera reported in 1988.  Mineralogy of the 
Kings Valley resource is discussed in Section 7.1.  The USBM studied several options and selected two 
with potential for further development, including the thermal process favored by Western Lithium.  
The USBM report was the basis for the URS Kings Valley Project NI 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary 
Assessment and Economic Evaluation (PAEE) issued January 22, 2010.  Kappes Cassidy & Associates 
(KCA) was commissioned by WLC to perform metallurgical testwork in support of the PAEE that 
confirmed that the USBM process for recovery of lithium from the mineralized material is technically 
viable.  

The metallurgical testwork commissioned by WLC for the PFS included programs specific to calcination 
and the evaporative crystallization process. 

The ore preparation process involves calcining the ore mixed with anhydrite and dolomite to convert the 
silicates to sulfates for leaching.  Recoverable metals include lithium, potassium and sodium.  
The calcine is leached in water recovering the sulfates to solution. 

The wet recovery process includes evaporation and crystallization stages to recover potassium and 
sodium as sulfates, and lithium as a carbonate, a material suitable for battery manufacture.  
The products would be purified to meet specifications for marketing. 

13.1.2 Metallurgical Testwork 

13.1.2.1 Hazen  

Hazen Research, Inc. (Hazen) in Golden, Colorado was contracted by WLC to continue process 
development, define process parameters for calcining and Li2CO3 production, and adapt the process to 
semi-continuous operation.  

The work was performed in two phases.  Phase I explored bench-scale kiln operating parameters, 
investigated purification concepts including ion exchange, and provided recommendations for scale-up 
to a semi-continuous process.  The objective of Phase II was to incorporate the results from the Phase I 
work and produce 1 kg of lithium carbonate.  

Phase I 

Testwork was performed on samples of oxidized and unoxidized mineralized material from drillholes 
WLC-13 and WLC-20.

May 2014 13-2 

Twenty-eight rotary kiln experiments and accompanying leaches were performed to examine optimal 
temperature, residence time, gas environment, powdered versus pelletized feed and reagent blend 
ratios for lithium recovery. 

Two fluid-bed calcining experiments were performed for comparison with rotary kiln results. 

An investigation to identify a suitable ion exchange (IX) resin for purification of the Li2CO3 product was 
completed. 

Two mineralogical evaluations were undertaken. 

Results were reported in the report entitled Phase I Lithium Recovery Pilot Plant Development, Hazen 
Project 11103−07, issued June 13, 2011. 

Phase II 

The samples for this work were obtained from test pit WLT-02 located in the south end of the McDemitt 
caldera near the reserve defined in this study, (K-UTEC Sample, December 7, 2011, Technical Reference 
E).  The location relative to the ore deposit is shown in Figure 1, Technical Reference E. 

Semi-continuous pilot calcination was conducted at 1000°C for 45 minutes on a mixture of one part ore 
to 0.4 parts each of anhydrite and dolomite.  Leaching was conducted at 90-95°C for a retention time of 
one hour.  Ion exchange was utilized to remove calcium from the brine.  Potassium and sodium were 
evaporated to glaserite prior to Li2CO3 precipitation with Na2CO3.  Purification of the Li2CO3 was 
accomplished by repulping and CO2 dissolution, a step considered unnecessary in the final flowsheet.  

The report, Phase II Process Parameter Summary for Lithium Recovery Pilot Plant Development.  
Hazen Project 11103-07, was issued August 16, 2011. 

13.1.2.2 K-UTEC 

Laboratory-scale testwork to verify and advance the WLC wet recovery process was performed at K-
UTEC AG Salt Technologies, Sondershausen, Germany (K-UTEC).  Three phases of work were 
commissioned by WLC: Phase 1 performed process verification on synthetic brine, Phase 2 verified the 
Phase 1 work on calcined ore (by Outotec) from the deposit, and Phase 3 provided design parameters, a 
mass balance and capital and operating cost estimates for the wet plant. 

The Phase 1 Report, Process Design to Manufacture Lithium Carbonate from a Hectorite Containing Ore, 
is dated August 30, 2010. 

The Phase 2 Report, Process Design to Manufacture Lithium Carbonate from a Hectorite Containing Ore, 
is dated September 16, 2010. 

The Phase 3 Report, Evaporation and Crystallization Process and Preliminary Design to Extract Li2CO3, 
K2SO4 and Na2SO4 for the Kings Valley Leach Solution, is dated September 12, 2011.  Based on the K-
UTEC test results, overall recovery of the metals is 87.2% Li, 77.7% K and 82.7% Na.

13.1.2.3 CICITEM 

WLC engaged Centro de Investigación Científico Tecnológico para la Minería (CICITEM) at the University 
of Antofagasta in Chile to develop baseline information of phase diagrams for the crystallization process 
that included the separation of sodium and potassium sulfates from lithium sulfate. 

The results of the CICITEM work are published in Potassium Sulfate Recovery Process from Li2CO3 
"Barren Solution," Without Addition of Potassium Chloride – Phase 1 of Test Work Program, dated 
July 27, 2010. 

Additional flowsheet development is based on this testwork performed on simulated lithium barren 
solutions.  A review of this testwork by URS suggests the flowsheet can be simplified to remove the 
acidification step following Li2CO3 precipitation.  This modification has been incorporated in the 
flowsheet and process description presented in Section 17.1.  

13.1.2.4 Outotec 

Outotec GmbH, Oberursel/Frankfurt am Main, Germany (Outotec) was commissioned by WLC to 
perform advanced granulating and calcining tests utilizing a laboratory fluidized bed calciner.  
Additional granulation testwork was performed confirming the ability of the granules to maintain 
integrity through the calcination process.  The tests confirmed a fluidized bed unit is suitable for the 
WLC Kings Valley process; however the results indicated the recovery of lithium in the subsequent leach 
circuit was seven points lower than that achieved utilizing a rotary calciner.  WLC elected to advance the 
project incorporating a rotary unit.  A portion of the calcine generated in the testwork was forwarded to 
K-UTEC for the Phase II testing.  

Two Outotec reports were issued: Granulation and 200 mm Fluid Bed Testwork with Lithium Containing 
Clay, December 2010, Project No. 6040520, and Beneficiation, Granulation and Roasting of 1700 kg 
Lithium containing clay Mixture in Outotec's 200 mm Fluid Bed Pilot Plant, February 2011, Project 
No. 6042408. 

13.1.3 Other Factors 

Confirmation of the required addition of anhydrite and dolomite per tonne of ore to achieve design 
product recovery is recommended for the next phase of the project. 

Verification of the suitability of coal for direct-firing the calciner and quantification of the associated 
energy requirements is recommended for the next phase of testwork. 

Analysis of the calciner off-gas from the coal-fired calcining tests is recommended to provide a basis for 
treatment requirements. 

Identification of corrosive gases from the calcination process in the testwork to date suggests future 
work to quantify the content and volume of gas flows for materials selection in calcining equipment and 
gas-handling ductwork. 

Confirmation of the revised flowsheet that does not incorporate the acidification step is recommended.

WLC engaged KCA in 2009 to undertake experimental laboratory work with the goal of studying a 
thermal process for extracting lithium from lithium-bearing clays obtained from the Kings Valley deposit 
in Nevada.  The basis of the test work is derived from prior work completed by the USBM in 1988 and 
from the experience of KCA personnel.  The results of the work conducted by KCA are presented in Kings 
Valley Lithium Project—Metallurgical Test Work Summary, Report #39801, November 2009.  

The findings of the KCA test work program were the basis for the process design criteria and are 
described in detail in Section 16 of URS' Technical Report: NI 43-101 Technical Report Preliminary 
Assessment and Economic Evaluation, Kings Valley Project, Humboldt County, Nevada, USA, effective 
date December 31, 2009.  

Overall, the process originally proposed by the USBM to extract lithium from the lithium bearing clays 
described above was proven to be viable.  GSI believes that the metallurgical samples taken are 
representative of the material being tested.  While KCA performed the metallurgical tests on material 
from the Stage I Lens, GSI believes that the previous USBM and the mineralogical similarities between 
the Stage I and Stage II lenses are a reasonable basis for assuming that Li-rich clays from the Stage II Lens 
could be beneficiated in a similar manner.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this Stage II Lens 
estimate indeed qualifies as a resource.  However, further metallurgical testing, specific to Stage II Lens 
clays, would be necessary to estimate mineral reserves and perform economic analyses. 

The process development work conducted under Stage II has been superseded by technologies 
advanced in the Stage I development program.

14 .0  MIN ERAL  RESO UR CE ESTIMATES 
1 4 . 1  S T A G E  I  

WLC engaged Reserva International, LLC to complete a resource estimate for the Stage I Lens within the 
Project, located in Humboldt County, Nevada.  The resource estimate was made from a three-
dimensional block model using commercial mine planning software (Gemcom GEMS™).  The main 
estimated elements are lithium (Li) and potassium (K), but estimates were also made for sodium, 
magnesium, aluminum, calcium and iron, in addition to minor elements molybdenum, rubidium, 
strontium, chromium, titanium, arsenic and barium.  The estimates are current as of June 28, 2011, the 
effective date of this section of the report. 

Table 14.1 shows the total estimated resources for the Stage I Lens for a range of Li cutoff values.  
Reserva is of the opinion that, at a 3,200 ppm (0.32%) lithium cutoff, the Stage I Lens has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction by open-pit mining.  Section 15.1 of this report provides the 
parameters for the derivation of the cutoff.  Lithium carbonate would be the primary product, 
associated with potassium and sodium as byproduct.  The resources are reported using a lithium cutoff. 

• Measured resources are in blocks (30 m × 30 m x 3 m) estimated using at least three drill 
holes and four composites within a 200 m × 150 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 
20 m in the vertical direction. 

• Indicated resources are in blocks estimated using at least two drillholes and five composites 
within a 100 m × 75 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 10 m in the vertical 
direction. 

• Inferred resources are blocks estimated with at least three composites within a search 
radius of 300 m × 225 m in the horizontal plane and 30 m in the vertical plane.  

The density values used in the model are shown in Table 14.2.  See Section 11.1.3 for details on how 
density was determined. 

Note that rounding errors may occur in Table 14.1 and that the contained metal does not account for 
mine or metallurgical recovery.  To convert from Li % to Li ppm, multiply the % value by 10,000.  
The conversion factor from Li % to LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent) is 5.323.  This factor is determined 
from the proportion of lithium in the molecular weight of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), as follows: 

molecular weight Li2CO3   =  (2 × 6.941) + (12.011) + (3 ×15.9994)     =    5.323 

molecular weight 2 x Li      ( 2 × 6.941)

Table 14.2:  Density Values used in the Stage I Lens Resource Model 

 

All of the holes have been drilled vertically except for WLC-58 (-70 degree dip, 180 degree azimuth) and 
are assumed to not have deviated.  WLC has checked this assumption with downhole surveys of 23 holes 
in the Stage I Lens.  Results indicate very little deviation of vertical holes (minimum dip: -90, maximum 
dip: -88.2, average dip: 89.5) and support the assumption of verticality for previously drilled holes. 

14.1.1 Geologic Model 

Project limits and coordinates are in UTM NAD 27 easting northing and elevation values and are in 
meters.  The block model geometry is summarized in Table 14.3.  The block size selected for the Stage I 
Lens modeling is 30m × 30m × 3m, which is considered reasonable given the drillhole spacing and the 
fact that the block model represents open pit resources. 

The drillhole database used for geologic modeling and resource estimation was closed on June 28, 2011.  
The last drillhole for which assay data was available was WLC-200.  A total of 197 holes drilled by WLC 
(see Section 10.1, Drilling), and cores were assayed at ALS Labs and were used for estimation purposes.  
A plan view of the drillhole collars is shown in Figure 14.1 below.  The average horizontal spacing of the 
drillholes varies from a nominal 180 m × 180 m, to 61 m × 61 m in the more closely drilled central 
portion of the deposit.

May 2014 14-5 

The Stage I Lens mineralization is controlled by volcaniclastic moat sedimentary rocks containing 
lithium-rich claystone.  Sectional interpretations (for E-W and N-S transects) were generated by WLC 
from drill logs for alluvium, claystone (moat sediments), basalt, a silicified unit, and bedrock.  
Two oxidation surfaces were also interpreted, one just below alluvium and another near the 
claystone/silicified interface.  Additionally, a series of faults have been interpreted by WLC based on 
drillhole data and were incorporated in the geologic interpretation.  The approach taken was to develop 
a set of 3-D triangulated surfaces representing the topographic surface and the interfaces between the 
overburden, claystone and volcanics/silicified rocks.  A fault surface was created in order to enhance the 
quality of interpretation.  The volume (solid) between the modeled overburden and basement was 
treated as a single domain for estimation and resource reporting purposes.  A 3-D perspective of the 
faulted basement surface and surface expression of the faults is shown in Figure 14.2.  The surfaces and 
solids were used to code the block model by lithology domains within GEMS™.  A lithologic domain is a 
volume considered as a single entity for modeling purposes.  All claystone rock types, intercalated ash 
layers and occurrences of basalt were treated as a single domain.  How the presence of basalt was 
handled in the domain is outlined in Section 14.1.5.  Figure 14.3 shows an N-S cross section (looking 
west) with the interpreted domain surfaces shown; also illustrated in this figure is the topography and 
the drillholes color coded by the rock type codes.  Reserva checked the consistency of the interpreted 
domain codes against WLC drillhole logs in section and plan and found it acceptable.

14.1.1.1 Assays 

As of June 28, 2011 a total of 197 core holes had been drilled by WLC in the Stage I Lens.  Assay data for 
these holes was used for estimating grade.  Detailed and/or summary lithological logs were available for 
all holes and were used in the modeling of the lithological surfaces and domains.  See Section 11.1 for a 
description of the core sampling process.  The data was imported into the GEMS™ project database.  
The average length of the assay intervals was approximately 1.5 m. 

14.1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis 

The relationships among the assay values for the major elements (lithium, potassium) and among the 
other elements of interest were analyzed by constructing a correlation matrix of the data, as illustrated 
in Table 14.5.  Correlations greater than the absolute value of 0.5 are highlighted. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 14-9 

Table 14.5:  Assay Values – Correlation Matrix (All Rock types) 

 

Lithium and potassium, with a correlation of 0.289, can be considered to be not strongly correlated.  
The strongest correlation for both Li and K elements is with the minor element rubidium.  Lithium exhibits a 
moderate positive correlation (0.536) with magnesium and exhibits a negative correlation (-0.570) with 
aluminum.  These correlations are related to the mineral composition.  The moderate to strong correlations 
(both positive and negative) among the minor elements are not significant to the resource estimate. 

A boxplot (Figure 14.4) generated with assay lithium values illustrates the variation in concentrations 
with respect to rock type.

Figure 14.5 illustrates that there is a distinct range of lithium values in the claystone rock types, with the 
highest values occurring in the carbonaceous claystones.  These relationships are consistent across the 
deposit.  Lithium values in the intercalated ash layers and basalt are distinctly lower.  It should be noted 
that the high maximum value exhibited is likely due to differences in the interpretations made by 
various geologists during logging. 

Although there are notable variations in the lithium content by rock type, it has not been possible to 
establish the lateral continuity of individual rock types at this time due to the nature of the deposit and 
current drillhole spacing.  Given the additional indication that bulk mining methods would be employed, 
it was decided to treat the various claystone units as a single geological domain for modeling purposes.  
The following histograms and probability plots (Figure 14.5, Figure 14.6, Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.8 for 
lithium and potassium are, therefore, based on all rock types.

14.1.3 Composites 

Assay values were not capped prior to compositing because probability plots showed continuity and the 
domain composite coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean), was relatively low.  The overall 
CV for lithium assays was 0.627, while potassium had a CV of 0.487.  Figure 14.9 and Figure 14.10 show the 
histogram and probability plots of the lithium and potassium assay values.  High grade restrictions on 
composites were, however, used in the estimation, as detailed in Section 14.1.6. 

Down-hole compositing was done for 1.5 meter lengths.  This length was chosen because it is one-half 
the vertical block size of 3 meters.  This limited the effects of smoothing in grade interpolation.  
The composites were coded by back-tagging against the rock type block model reflecting the lithology 
domains.  Since there a limited number of assays from the alluvial zone, composites with lithium grades 
start at the bottom of the alluvial surface, and continue down to the last assayed interval.  There were a 
total of 9,249 Li% composites and 9,541 K% composites within the main mineralized unit.  
The difference in count reflects a greater frequency of zero Li% intervals than for K%.  A histogram and 
basic statistics of the claystone domain are shown in Figure 14.9 for lithium composite grades.   

Figure 14.10 shows the corresponding histogram for potassium composite grades within the same 
domain.

14.1.4 Variography 

With most mineral deposits, the measure of continuity for any given metal depends on the separation 
distance between points of measurement and the direction from position to position.  Variability 
increases and correlation decreases with the sample-to-sample separation distance.  When the rate of 
change in variability is dependent on the direction, the measure of spatial variability is described as 
anisotropic and it is characterized in terms of an ellipsoid with axes of anisotropy.  There are several 
mathematical functions that measure variability in space, and Reserva elected to use the correlogram, 
which is a variant of the semi-variogram.  The correlogram was probably the first measure of continuity 
(the converse of variability) developed.  It measures the correlation coefficient between two sets of 
data, with values at the heads and values at the tails of vectors with similar direction and magnitude.  
Multiple studies have found that the correlogram provides a stable estimate of spatial continuity.  
For ease of modeling, the correlogram value is subtracted from one and is presented in a similar 
graphical form to the variogram.  The variography was completed using Sage 2001® software and 1.5 m 
composites.  Reserva calculated experimental correlograms with 30 degree increments in the azimuth 
and 45 degree increments in the dip direction and the vertical direction.  These correlograms were 
computed for lithium and potassium.  

The correlograms were modeled with a nugget component and two nested spherical components, used 
in the resource estimation step.  The lithium and potassium parameters used are tabulated in 
Table 14.6, and the experimental correlograms and fitted models for the directions most closely 
corresponding to the calculated average correlogram are shown in Figure 14.11.

14.1.5 Estimation 

The resources were estimated using either ordinary kriging (OK) or inverse distance (power of two) 
interpolation, with estimation restricted to the claystone domain.  Alluvium and bedrock material have 
no lithium or potassium grades.  A block model was defined to cover the volume of interest, as detailed 
in Table 14.7 following: 

Table 14.7:  Block Model Geometry 

Axis Minimum Maximum Block Size(m) # Blocks 

X(East) 410,000 413,000 30 100 

Y(North) 4,616,800 4,618,600 30 60 

Z(Elevation) 1,306 1,615 3 103 

 

Lithium and potassium block grades were interpolated in three passes using the parameters detailed 
below.  The three pass approach was used to ensure that an adequate number of well distributed 
samples were available to inform most blocks and to reduce the smoothing effect inherent in 
interpolation.  

Pass 1: 
Minimum # of samples  5 
Maximum # of samples  8 
Maximum # samples/hole  2 (Minimum # of holes = 3) 
 
Pass 2: 
Minimum # of samples  4 
Maximum # of samples  10 
Maximum # samples/hole  3 (Minimum # of holes = 2) 
 
Pass 3: 
Minimum # of samples  3 
Maximum # of samples  12 
Maximum # samples/hole  N/A 

 
The search ellipsoids used are as detailed in Table 14.8 following.  The search orientation is based on the 
orientation of the second spherical component of the lithium correlogram.

The minor elements (aluminum, arsenic, barium, calcium, chromium, iron, molybdenum, magnesium, 
sodium and rubidium) were interpolated in a single pass, using inverse distance interpolation (power of 
three), and the Pass 3 search ellipsoid as shown in Table 14.8. 

Although some sectional interpretations of the basalt occurrences were developed by WLC, it was 
difficult to correlate them and develop a physical 3D model of the rock type.  A probabilistic approach 
using indicators was therefore developed, creating a basalt percent block model (attribute) that could 
be used to represent the occurrence of basalt and to dilute the lithium grades in the affected blocks, 
based on the proportion of basalt.  This proportion was also used to calculate a weighted average 
density for the blocks affected.  The primary documentation of the presence of basalt is in the lithology 
table, and this data was used to assign an integer code (basalt = 1, non-basalt = 0) to composites in the 
claystone domain.  These basalt indicators were interpolated into the block model using inverse distance 
cubed interpolation.  The search parameters were based on basalt indicator variography.  
The interpolated block estimate in this Case is a value between 0 and 1 that represents the proportion 
of the block that is basalt.  

As indicated above, the proportion of basalt estimated in a block was used to adjust the block 
element grades and density as in the following examples: 

Adjusted Li% = Li% × (100% – Basalt%) 

Adjusted Density = 1.79 × (100% – Basalt%) + 2.51 × Basalt%  

(Where 1.79 t/m3 and 2.51 t/m3 are the density of claystone and basalt respectively.  The basalt 
density of 2.51 t/m3 is based on a single determination.) 

With respect to the interpolation of the main element lithium, there was some concern that grades in 
the vicinity of basalt occurrences (i.e., blocks with high basalt content) were lower than composites from 
areas with little or no basalt.  This could possibly bias the estimation of blocks with high basalt content.  
The relationship between grade and basalt content was investigated.  The basalt percentage was 
interpolated using indicator geostatistics.  The claystone composites were back-tagged with the 
estimated percentage of basalt.  This composite basalt percentage was graphed against the lithium 
grades as illustrated in Figure 14.12.  The x-axis shows the basalt percentage where 1.0 is equal to 100%.

A basalt percentage of 10% was selected as a threshold for differentiating two sub-domains within the 
claystone domain, composed of claystone blocks with a basalt percentage of <10% and ≥10% basalt 
respectively.  In order to prevent the possible bias referred to above, only composites with basalt 
percentages of <10% were used when interpolating grades into blocks with <10% basalt and, similarly, 
with composites with a basalt percentage of >10% and blocks with >10% basalt.  Overall, blocks with a 
significant percentage of basalt (≥ 75%) comprise 0.9% of the model blocks with estimated values.  
Although this is a small percentage, the basalt is still accounted for in the interpolation of grade values in 
blocks containing basalt as described above.  High grade composites were spatially restricted at the time 
of lithium and potassium grade estimation, which means that although the composites were used, their 
spatial influence was restricted with a smaller search.  This allows the high grade value to be recognized, 
but prevents excessive smearing of these values.  The definition of what was considered "high grade" 
was obtained from the composite cumulative frequency plots (Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.9) and 
generally corresponds to the 99% or higher percentile of the distribution.  Table 14.9 shows the details 
of this restriction.  The horizontal ranges used were selected to limit the influence to the blocks 
immediately adjacent to the sample.  The anisotropy and orientation of the restricted search ellipsoids 
are the same as for the full search, as tabulated in Table 14.8. (Search ellipsoid geometry)

14.1.6 Model Validation 

Reserva completed a detailed visual inspection of the model to check for proper coding of drillhole 
intervals and block model cells, in both sections and plans.  The coding was found to be correct.  
Grade interpolation was checked relative to drillhole composites and found to be reasonable.  

Reserva checked the block model estimates for global bias by checking the mean nearest neighbor (NN) 
estimate for lithium and potassium against model OK grade estimates.  Mean grades were found to 
match very well.  Reserva also checked for local trends in the grade estimate by comparing the mean 
grade estimate from the NN model and composites against the OK model in 100 m wide swaths through 
the model on Easting and Northing, and 50m high swaths for elevation.  The average grade of all the 
interpolated blocks (OK and NN) and composites that fall in the swath is calculated and plotted to allow 
a local comparison of the sample and interpolated values.  The block model behaves as expected and 
reproduces the general grade trends well, with some evidence of the smoothing common in 
interpolation procedures Figure 14.17 shows an example of a swath plot for lithium on N-S sections.  
The pink line is the block model lithium average, the black line is the NN average and the green line is 
the composite average.

In summary, the lithium and potassium estimates are considered reasonable and show no marked 
anomalies, such as large deviations between the averaged values.  

14.1.7 Mineral Resource Classification 

The mineral resources of the Stage I Lens were classified consistent with the CIM Definition Standards 
incorporated by reference into the Canadian NI 43-101 as follows: 

• Inferred Mineral Resource 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling 
and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is 
based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes.  

• Indicated Mineral Resource 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the 
deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to 
be reasonably assumed.  

• Measured Mineral Resource 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade 
or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can 
be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm 
both geological and grade continuity.  

The mineralization of the Project satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified into measured, indicated and 
inferred mineral resources.  Resources are tabulated in Table 14.1 and the criteria are listed below. 

• Measured resources are in blocks estimated using at least three drillholes and five 
composites within a 100 × 75 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 10 m in the 
vertical direction. 

• Indicated resources are in blocks estimated using at least two drillholes and four composites 
within a 200 × 150 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 20 m in the vertical direction. 

• Inferred resources are blocks estimated with at least three composites within a search 
radius of 300 × 225 m in the horizontal plane and 30 m in the vertical plane.

WLC engaged GeoSystems International, Inc. to complete a resource estimate for the Stage II Lens area 
within the Kings Valley Project, located in Humboldt County, Nevada.  The resource estimate was made 
from a three-dimensional (3D) block model using commercial mine planning software, (MineSight®).  
The estimated elements are lithium, potassium, fluorine, and sodium, and are current as of May 15, 
2010, the effective date of the estimates. 

The resource estimate was completed by Mr. Mario E. Rossi, CIM, AusIMM, SME, IAMG, and Principal 
Geostatistician of GSI.  Mr. Rossi is an independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 by reason 
of education, affiliation with a professional association (as defined in NI 43-101) and past relevant work 
experience.  Also, Mr. Rossi is independent of WLC applying all of the tests in Section 1.5 of NI 43-101.  

Table 14.10 shows the total estimated resources for the Stage II Lens area using a nominal 2,000 ppm Li 
cutoff.  GSI is of the opinion that at a 0.20% lithium cutoff, the Stage II Lens has reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction by open-pit mining.  As with other areas within the Kings Valley Project, lithium 
carbonate would be the primary product with potassium as a by-product.  Therefore, the resources are 
reported in all cases using a Li cutoff. 

The estimated indicated resources (Table 14.10) are approximately 95 million metric tons at 0.27% Li 
and 3.66% K, while the inferred resources (Table 14.11) are about 47 million metric tons at 0.26% Li and 
3.83% K.  In all cases, rounding errors may exist. 

Indicated resources are in blocks estimated using at least 2 drill holes, 6 composites, or 3 octants within 
a 160 m search radius in the horizontal plane and 16 m in the vertical direction.  A later smoothing 
algorithm was used to avoid isolated blocks of indicated within inferred, or vice-versa; this algorithm 
defined indicated and inferred areas with a minimum 80 x 80 x 10 m volume.   

The density values are derived from the Stage II Lens determinations.  The average values obtained are 
shown in Table 14.12; the in situ dry density used for all mineralized material (moat sediments) is 
1.96 t/m3. 

The Stage II Lens estimate considers only a portion of what is known as the South Pod, centered in the 
area where the new WLC drilling exists.  While GSI chose not to interpolate grade into areas without 
recent drilling, neighbouring Chevron holes indicate that there is potential to increase laterally the 
estimated resource tonnage with further drilling.

The topography used is the Nad27 DEM sheet provided by WLC, which is deemed inadequate for 
feasibility-level studies.  GSI recommends that WLC increase the certainty of the resource estimate 
through the following steps: 

1. Completing metallurgical test work specific to the Stage II Lens; 

2. Define the importance of oxidized vs. un-oxidized material; 

3. Obtain a fly-over digital topography of the Stage II Lens; 

4. Prioritize infill drilling by the mining extraction sequence.  Drill on a 160 m grid for indicated 
mineral resources and a 80 m grid for measured mineral resources.  These suggested drill 
hole spacings could be checked and adjusted as further drilling is completed. 

14.2.1 Geologic Model 

Project limits and coordinates are in UTM (m) Easting and Northing values, and the block model 
geometry is summarized in Table 14.13.  Elevation is also in meters.  The Stage II Lens block size selected 
is 20 x 20 x 5 m, which is considered reasonable given the current drill hole spacing and that the block 
model represents open pit resources.

The drill hole database used for geologic modeling and resource estimation was closed on December 31, 
2009 with the last hole drilled in the Stage II Lens, SP-38.  The Stage II Lens mineralization is controlled by 
volcaniclastic moat sedimentary rocks containing lithium-rich claystone.  Sectional interpretations 
(approximately E-W and N-S) were generated by WLC from drill logs for alluvium, moat sediments 
(claystone), fanglomerates, silicified unit, and bedrock.  Also two oxidation surfaces were interpreted, one 
just below alluvium, and another near the claystone/silicified interface.  Additionally, a series of faults have 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 14-37 

been interpreted by WLC based on drill hole data, and incorporated in the geologic interpretation.  
These sectional interpretations were digitized and transformed into strings, which were then used to 
create surfaces and three-dimensional solids in MineSight®.   

The surfaces and solids were used to code the block model by lithology domains within MineSight®.  
The percentage of each block within each unit was coded in order to capture the mixtures of units at the 
interfaces.  Table 14.14 summarizes the lithologic and oxidation units in the Stage II Lens geologic 
model. 

The estimation domains were derived from these lithologic units, which are also shown in Table 14.14.  
The Li grades within the oxidized and un-oxidized claystones, as well as the smaller 
fanglomerate/volcanics did not warrant separate estimation domains, according to the statistical 
analysis discussed in Section 14.2.4 below.

plan and found a reasonable match with the block domain coding.

14.2.2 Assays 

A total of 51 drill holes were used for estimating grade, 38 SP core holes drilled by WLC, and 13 older 
Chevron holes.  Only 2 of the 13 older Chevron holes (MC-84-81C and MC-84-90C) have grades for the 
four estimated elements, since they were sent for re-analysis by WLC in 2009.  The remaining 
11 Chevron holes only have lithium grades. 

The total drilling was 3,019.61 m, of which 2,150.87 m were drilled by WLC (SP holes), and the remaining 
868.74 m were drilled by Chevron.  A total of 2,813.31 m correspond to the moat sediments domains 
(lithologies 2 through 5), while 109.01 m correspond to the silicified domain (lithology unit 60), and the 
remaining drilled meters to the alluvial or bedrock domains, which were not estimated.  

Assay values were not capped prior to compositing because probability plots showed continuity and the 
domain composite coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean), was low.  The overall CV for Li 
assays was 0.50, while potassium had a CV of 0.36.  Figure 14.20 shows the histogram of all Li assay 
values.  However, high grade restrictions on composites were used in the estimation, see below.

Figure 14.20: Histogram and basic statistics, all lithium assays. 

Fluorine values have the particularity of being derived from two different assaying methods, based on 
the F concentration of the sample.  For samples with greater than 2% F, a variant of the Fusion method 
discussed in Section 11.2 is used.  This creates an artificial discontinuity, because it appears that values 
that are close to 2% F will tend to underestimate the F value, while values derived from the second 
assaying method will result in values that are higher than 2%.  The end result is a relative deficiency of 
values around 2% F, which clearly appears artificial, see Figure 14.21.  This issue needs to be addressed 
in future resource estimates and economic evaluations.

14.2.3 Composites 

Assay values were composited into 1.5 m long down the hole composites and coded by lithology 
domains.  Composites with less than 0.5 m in length were not used in grade interpolation.  Since there 
are no assays from the alluvial zone, composites with Li grades start at the bottom of the alluvial 
surface, down to the last assayed interval.  There were a total of the 1,655 composites within the main 
mineralized unit, the claystone (moat sediment) domain, the histogram and basic statistics of which are 
shown in Figure 14.22.  Figure 14.23 shows the corresponding histogram for potassium grades within 
the same domain. 

Additional histograms and basic statistics, including those corresponding to F and Na, are shown in 
Technical Reference G.

14.2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis and Estimation Domains 

In addition to the histogram and basic statistics described above, other histograms, cumulative 
frequency plots, and conditional mean plots were completed for all 4 elements.  All CVs for each of the 
domains were low, so that in all cases ordinary kriging can be used in grade interpolation.

Histograms and probability plots for each of the lithology units suggest that there is little grade variation 
from one unit to the next.  In the Case of the claystone unit (moat sediments), oxidation does not 
appear to impact the grade distribution; and the fanglomerate unit also has significant Li mineralization, 
with slightly lower grades compared to the claystone. 

The only unit that was separated from the claystone was the thin silicified unit laying over the bedrock 
that clearly shows a drop in grade.  With more drilling, it may be possible for WLC geologists to identify a 
higher-grade population domain within the moat sediments, probably in the form of thin layers of clays 
enriched in hectorite, relative to their surroundings.  It was not necessary to do so for grade 
interpolation at this time. 

Scatterplots and conditional mean plots assess the degree of correlation between variables.  
Conditional mean plots were done based on lithium grade classes only.  These plots are similar to 
scatterplots, except that they show the average of each secondary variable corresponding to each Li 
grade class.  They provide an indication of the correlation between two variables by synthesizing the 
scatterplot cloud.  Figure 14.24 shows the potassium mean grades conditional to lithium grade ranges.  
The correlation between the two is excellent, and suggests that the only source of F in this deposit is the 
same Li-rich hectorite clay; if this assumption could be verified, prediction of F grades at the time of 
mining would be easier. 

Figure 14.25 shows the scatterplot for the same variables composites in domain 25 (claystone).  
The linear correlation coefficient between the two is 0.94; note that for the higher Li grades, there 
appears to be an additional kick on F.  Compare to Figure 14.26, which shows the scatterplot for Li-K; 
note that the correlation is negative, which is also observed in the conditional mean plots and the 
resource grade tonnage curves: higher Li grades generally mean lower K grades. 

Technical Reference G presents the additional cumulative frequency plots, scatterplots, and conditional 
mean plots obtained for Li, K, F, and Na.

14.2.5 Variography 

Variography graphically shows the spatial variability of an attribute.  For the Kings Valley project, 
variography was completed using Sage 2001® software.  GSI calculated experimental correlograms with 
30° increments in the azimuth, 45° increment in the dip direction, and the vertical direction.  
These correlograms were computed for all 4 elements.  The correlograms were modeled and used in the 
resource estimation step.  

14.2.6 Estimation 

The reported estimate is an Ordinary Kriging (OK) based on estimation domains.  The main mineralized 
estimation domain is the claystone, with a small fanglomerate unit and a silicified unit just above 
bedrock carrying medium-range Li grades.  Alluvium and bedrock material have no Li or K grades.  

Two passes (outside in) were used for Ordinary Kriging (OK) grade estimation.  The first pass was used to 
estimate blocks with more local information, searching out to what approximately meets the indicated 
classification criteria.  The second pass was to fill the claystone envelope.  Composite and blocks were 
matched on domain code, although Domain 60 composites (silicified) were used to estimate claystone 
material, but no claystone composites were used to estimate the silicified domain. 

High grade composites were spatially restricted at the time of estimation, which means that although 
the composites were used, its spatial influence was restricted to a smaller radius.  The definition of what 
was considered "high grade" was obtained from the cumulative frequency plots, and generally 
correspond to the 99% or higher percentile of the distribution.  Table 14.15 shows the details of this 
restriction. 

Table 14.15: High grade restrictions.

Li 5,000ppm 14 x 14 x 14 m 
K 6.5% 14 x 14 x 14 m 
F 3.5% 14 x 14 x 14 m 

Na 1.8% 14 x 14 x 14 m 

 
Figure 14.27 and Figure 14.28 show an N-S cross sections and plan view respectively through the Li OK 
block models looking north.  Figure 14.29 and Figure 14.30 show the corresponding cross sections and 
plan view of the K OK block models looking north.  The models are shown using contoured values, and 
the figures can be zoomed into for more clarity.  Red contours are Li grades greater than 3,000 ppm. 

Note how the better potassium grades tend to be lower in elevation, compared to good Li grades.  
It appears that the lower claystone are richer in potassium than the upper horizons, while the opposite 
is true for Li, with better grades closer to the surface.  This behavior explains the negative correlation 
found in drill holes between Li and K and discussed above.

14.2.7 Model Validation 

GSI completed a detailed visual inspection of the model to check for proper coding of drill-hole intervals 
and block model cells, in both sections and plans.  The coding was found to be correct.  Grade 
interpolation was checked relative to drill-hole composites and found to be reasonable.  

GSI checked the block model estimates for global bias by checking the mean nearest neighbor (NN) 
estimate for Li and K against model OK grade estimates.  Mean grades were found to match very well.  
GSI also checked for local trends in the grade estimate by comparing the mean grade estimate from the 
NN model against the OK model in swaths through the model on easting, northing, and elevation.  
The block model behaves as expected and reproduces well the general grade trends.  Figure 14.31 
shows an example of a swath plot for Li on N-S sections.  The red line is the block model Li average, the 
black line the NN average, and the dotted line the number of blocks (second Y axis) used in the average.  
Additional graphs are shown in Technical Reference H. 

 
Figure 14.31: Li swath plot, blocks vs. NN model, N-S Sections.  

In addition to the nearest neighbour (NN) model, an Indicator-modified OK (IMOK) model was run on Li 
to check if there were any opportunities to separate out dilution and increase grade.  The IMOK model 
confirmed the OK estimate, being very similar in tonnage and grade above cutoff.  The similarity of both 
models confirms the very good grade continuity of Li grades and suggests that, with current drilling 
density, there are few if any opportunities to separate out lower grade material. 

In summary, the Li, K, and Na estimates are thought to be robust and show no anomalies.  
The potassium grade drops slightly for higher Li averages, which is somewhat unexpected, considering 
that it is behaving differently than what was observed for the PCD lens.  The F model is also internally 
consistent with the data and parameters used in the estimation, but is believed to be under-
representing the population around 2% F due to the assaying issue discussed elsewhere. 

14.2.8 Recommended Drill Spacing 

GSI verified the prior recommendation made by AMEC for the Stage I Lens using the same methodology 
for the Stage II Lens.  AMEC uses the statistical criterion that yearly ore production grade and tonnage

should be known at least to ±15% with 90% confidence in order to fall in the indicated mineral resource 
category.  The criterion for measured mineral resources is ±15% with 90% confidence for quarterly 
production. 

Unfortunately, this criterion is sensitive to small changes in production rates, as well as dependent on 
whether the material sent to plant annually comes from a single or multiple mining fronts.  GSI ran the 
confidence limits test for the Stage II Lens using the same estimated annual production rate of 
5,000 tons per day, i.e., the assumption is that the plant will be fed entirely with South material.  
Applying both the results of this test, as well as practical experience and criteria derived from the 
correlogram models and the current drill hole spacing, the recommended nominal drill spacing for 
measured mineral resources and indicated mineral resources are:  

1. Measured mineral resources: 80 × 80 m; and  

2. Indicated mineral resources: 160 × 160 m 

14.2.9 Mineral Resource Classification 

Mineral resources of the Stage II Lens were classified consistent with the CIM Definition Standards 
incorporated by reference into NI 43-101.  The mineralization of the project satisfies sufficient criteria to 
be classified as an indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource.  Resources are tabulated in 
Table 14.11 and the criteria listed below. 

• Inferred mineral resource: For a block to be classified as an inferred mineral resource, 
interpolated blocks had to be within the resource envelope drawn around the WLC holes, 
which include some Chevron core holes.  In addition, the blocks have to be within 320 m in 
the horizontal plane, and 32 m in the vertical plane of the nearest drill hole, with a minimum 
of 3 composites that result in a grade greater than or equal to 0.20 Li%, and reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction.  

• Indicated mineral resource: For a block to be classified as an indicated mineral resource, 
interpolated blocks had to have at least two drill holes within 160 m distance from its 
centroid, with a minimum of 6 composites that result a grade greater than or equal to 
0.20 Li%, and reasonable prospects for economic extraction. 

• There are no measured mineral resources at this time in the Stage II Lens area. 

There are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, and 
political or other relevant issues that may materially affect the resource estimates.  Other relevant 
factors that may materially affect the resources, including mining, metallurgical, and infrastructure are 
well understood according to the assumptions presented in the Stage II Resource Estimate.

15.1.1 Relevant Technical and Economic Considerations 

In establishing a mineral reserve, Tetra Tech referred to the mineral resource model prepared by 
Reserva (June 2011), the PAEE (URS 2010), results from the K-UTEC process test report (August 2011) 
and the results of a geotechnical study published by AMEC (March 2011).  Tetra Tech confirmed that the 
geologic resource model, the mining and the processing approaches were adequate, relevant and 
justified for economic extraction.  Additionally, Tetra Tech has established that the Project has a 
reasonable expectation to establish the necessary extraction facilities and obtain the necessary 
government approvals.  Tetra Tech converted the mineral resource into a mineral reserve using what it 
considered the economically minable part of the Measured and indicated Mineral Resource 

15.1.2 Pit Limit Analysis 

For the pit limit analysis and determination of the optimum pit process, Tetra Tech used the block model 
generated and reported by Reserva in the mineral resource section of Stage I PFS, effective as of 
June 28, 2011.  The Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) Gemcom Whittle™ Strategic Mine Planning Software 
(Whittle) was used to develop the pit shells.  Mineral resources classified as Measured and Indicated 
were considered as potential ore throughout the LG evaluations.  The extent of the block model used in 
the pit analysis for the mineral reserves falls within the reported mineral resource estimates.  
Block grade values of %Li, %K, and %Na were used, along with a bulk density model, and model for 
material classification (measured, indicated and inferred).  

15.1.3 Pit Limit Model Evaluation Parameters 

The Project deposit is situated at a relatively shallow depth and amenable to open pit mining methods 
that are similar to those used at operating clay mines in the upper central United States.  Mineralized 
layers of lithium bearing claystone occur in horizontal and sub-horizontal layers and are interbedded 
with ash layers.  The mineralized zone is overlain by a layer of waste alluvium which varies in thickness 
from 0.3 m to 11.3 m with an average thickness of 4.9 m, and by a low-grade (<0.32% lithium) claystone 
on the order of 10 m thick in the southeast portion of the deposit, increasing to an approximate 
maximum of 40 m in the northwest part of the deposit.  The mining methodology considered consists of 
overburden removal using truck/shovel bulk mining and the removal of ore using selective mining 
techniques to minimize dilution.  

Tetra Tech reviewed the 2010 PAEE by URS and found the mining approach be reasonable.  To advance 
the project to PFS level cost parameters were adjusted to what was deemed appropriate for the current 
timeline.  The mining cost and process costs were increased slightly from the PAEE (URS 2010) to 
account for a lesser economy of scale and increases in energy costs since the publication of the report.  
Mining costs are based on internal Tetra Tech databases of other projects similar in size.  
Additionally, Tetra Tech used a lower mining recovery factor (95%) to account for loss of ore due to the 
inability to achieve perfect separation of ore and waste because of the layered nature of the deposit.  
Process recovery was adjusted upward to match the results from WLC's extensive testing program.  
Additionally, the results of the geotechnical study performed by AMEC entitled "Prefeasibility Level

Geotechnical Study Report, Kings Valley Lithium Project Humboldt County, Nevada" (March 2011), 
identified an inter-ramp pit slope of 41 degrees as appropriate for pit walls up to 90 m high.  
Although potassium and sodium grades contribute roughly 25% of the revenue stream, lithium is the 
main profit source and pit optimization was based solely on modeled lithium grade.  After the pit 
designs were complete, the grades for potassium and sodium from the 3-D blocks that are above the ore 
cutoff are reported along with the lithium grade.  

The pertinent parameters used in the 3-D Lerchs-Grossman open pit optimization program are shown in 
Table 15.1 below.

15.1.4 Cutoff Grade Modeling Methods 

Tetra Tech calculated the breakeven mining cutoff, based on the parameters in Table 15.1, to be 0.23% 
Li.  Two different pit shells were selected from the family of economic shells that were generated by the 
Whittle program.  At the request of WLC, a cutoff of 0.32% Li, which is slightly higher than the breakeven 
cutoff, was applied to the material within the shells in order to generate an average ore grade of 0.40% 
Li.  Selection criteria were based on finding a shell that contained sufficient ore at the 0.32% cutoff to 
supply the mill for 20 years of production.  For Case 1, this requirement was 13.8 million dry tonnes of 
ore.  For Case 2, the requirement was 25.6 million dry tonnes of ore. 

To check the validity of applying the higher cutoff within an optimized shell, a second Whittle 
optimization was performed in which a fixed cutoff of 0.32% Li was specified for ore.  Two shells were 
chosen from this optimization that contained roughly the same amount of ore as was in the original 
Whittle shells at the 0.32% Li cutoff.  The two newer shells appeared to be almost identical in size and 
shape to the Shells 8 and 10 that were chosen as a basis for ultimate pit design.  Furthermore, the 
average ore grade and strip ratios are nearly identical.  A comparison of the four shells is shown in 
Table 15.2 below.

Applying a cutoff higher than the breakeven cutoff to material within an economic shell lowers the net 
value of that shell if time value of money is not taken into account.  However, application of a higher 
cutoff sometimes increases the net present value of a project.  This is especially true in a Case such as 
the Project where the processing cost is on the order of ten times the mining cost per tonne of ore. 

The Case 1 Whittle Shell 8, Case 1 ultimate design based on Shell 8, typical E-W and N-S sections through 
the Case 1 final designed pit and Case 1 Phase sequence are shown in Figure 16.1, Figure 16.2, 
Figure 16.3, Figure 16.4 and Figure 16.5. 

The Case 2 Whittle Shell 10, Case 2 ultimate design based on Shell 10, typical E-W and N-S sections 
through the Case 2 final designed pit and Case 2 Phase sequence are shown in Figure 16.6, Figure 16.7, 
Figure 16.8, Figure 16.9 and Figure 16.10.  

15.1.5 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

Two different mine plans were developed for the Project to test the expandability of the project.  
The first plan, Case 1, delivers 690,850 tonnes of dry mill feed each year for 21 years.  The second plan, 
Case 2, delivers 690,850 tonnes of dry mill feed for three years, increasing to 1,379,700 tonnes of dry 
mill feed for another 17 years.  Measured and Indicated material from the resource model was 
converted to a Proven and Probable mineral reserve for both Case 1 and Case 2, by applying the pit 
design for each. 

For Case 1, the outlines of each mining phase (1 through 5) were applied to the three dimensional grade 
model.  Material that fell inside the phases was classified as ore if it was of a Measured or Indicated 
resource class and it was 0.32% Li or higher.  Material that fell inside the phases that was not classified 
as ore was classified as waste. 

For Case 2, the outlines of each mining phase (1 through 8) were applied to the three dimensional grade 
model.  Material that fell inside the phases was classified as ore if it was of a Measured or Indicated 
resource class and it was 0.32% Li or higher.  Material that fell inside the phases that was not classified 
as ore was classified as waste. 

Results are tabulated in Table 15.3 and Table 15.4 and are subdivided by logical mining phase.

Note: Ore tonnes and grade will not match exactly with detailed schedule because variable cutoffs were used during first few years of 
operation and the average cutoff used for the Case 2 mine plan is 0.327% Li (see Table 16.7). 

15.1.6 Potential Effects of Relevant Factors 

Any increase in product price could potentially increase the amount of mineable reserve, since the 
breakeven cutoff could be lowered. 

An increase in overall process recovery would have a similar effect, since that would also lower the 
breakeven cutoff and allow lower grade material to be mined at a profit. 

A decrease in operating costs such as fuel, electricity, and raw materials (reagents) could decrease the 
breakeven cutoff and potentially increase the mineable reserve. 

If additional geotechnical studies show that the overall pit slopes can be steepened from the current 
41 degree overall slope, this can potentially decrease the strip ratio and potentially increase the 
mineable reserve.

16.1.1 Criteria and Design Parameters 

The Project deposit is situated at a relatively shallow depth and amenable to open pit mining methods.  
Mineralized layers of lithium ore occur in horizontal and sub-horizontal claystone layers, interbedded 
with low grade ash layers.  A Wirtgen surface miner was selected as suitable equipment to selectively 
mine the lithium claystone beds.  Overburden would be mined using conventional truck and shovel 
methods.  Per WLC's directive, this study assumes that the overburden would be mined via free-digging, 
no blasting would be required.  Tetra Tech has not independently confirmed the viability of free-digging. 

Based on Tetra Tech's recommendation, an overall mining recovery factor of 95% was applied.  
This factor was considered to be reasonable for the mining bench height chosen, and the type of mining 
equipment used.  No dilution factor was applied to ore grade as it was assumed that sufficient dilution 
was built into the 3-D grade model by using bench composited assay data. 

Two operating scenarios were chosen for study.  The first, Case 1, calls for the processing of 2,100 dry 
tonnes of ore per day, 365 days per year, at 90% availability.  The target mine life of operation is 
21 years, and the nominal average mill feed grade is 0.40% lithium.  The second, Case 2, calls for 
processing of 2,100 tonnes of ore per day, 365 days per year, at 90% availability for the first 3 years.  
Then, beginning in Year 4, the production rate is doubled to 4,200 tonnes of ore per day, 365 days per 
year, at 90% availability for an additional 17 years.  The nominal average mill feed grade is 0.40% lithium 
for Case 2. 

16.1.1.1 Geotechnical Data 

WLC engaged AMEC of Sparks Nevada to perform an independent geotechnical investigation to support 
the preliminary feasibility effort.  Preliminary results of the AMEC study were published in a report 
entitled Prefeasibility Level Geotechnical Study Report, Kings Valley Lithium Project Humboldt County, 
Nevada (March 2011).  Final results were published in an addendum entitled Addendum to Prefeasibility 
Level Geotechnical Investigation, Supplemental Pit Slope Recommendations and Geotechnical 
Recommendations Pertaining to Groundwater Data; Kings Valley Lithium Project, Humboldt County, 
Nevada (May 10, 2011).  The objectives of the AMEC study were to:  

• Characterize the subsurface soil and bedrock at the site 

• Provide preliminary earthwork and foundation recommendations 

• Provide preliminary mine pit slope design recommendations 

• Provide recommendations for design level geotechnical studies 

Pit slope inputs used for the open pit design are based on a final report issued by AMEC.  The unit 
weight, friction angle and cohesion were measured for the three main rock types encountered in the 
deposit, which are alluvium, basalt and claystone/ash layers.  Direct shear testing was also performed.

Limit equilibrium stability analyses were performed using Spencer's method of analysis with the 
computer program SLIDE. 

Slope recommendations presented in the AMEC report are based on limited data, but are considered 
adequate for a preliminary feasibility level of design.  Limited oriented structural data was obtained 
during the study, and these analyses are largely predicated on use of resource geologic cross sections for 
interpretation of the geology and structure around the pit.  In addition, limited groundwater data is 
available, and the stability of the pit slopes has been analyzed with the assumption that groundwater 
will have no adverse effect to the stability of the slopes. 

On April 25, 2011, personnel from Tetra Tech performed a site visit for the purpose of verifying sampling 
methods and other items related to the geotechnical investigation done by AMEC.  

Tetra Tech determined that the sampling and calculations methods used were appropriate for the level 
of study.  The primary result was the recommendation of an overall pit slope angle up to 41 degrees for 
an overall slope height of 90 m.  The analysis included a probability-based component in the calculation.  
This result is commensurate with the weak overburden that was tested to identify shear strength, 
cohesion, friction angles, unconfined compressive strength and other parameters.  The soils 
investigation resulted in the recommendation that most foundations could be supported by 
conventional spread foundations and floor slabs with certain recommended engineering design.  
The report concluded that the TSF and waste dump can be established on properly prepared existing 
soils sites.  Seismicity calculations were properly reduced to a maximum credible earthquake and 
operating basis earthquake for design purposes.  The report concluded with appropriate geotechnical 
recommendations that would be needed for a feasibility study.  

Results of the AMEC report were incorporated into the Stage I PFS and presented in the Section 26.6 of 
this report.  

16.1.1.2 Pit Wall Design 

The open pit designs have all been constructed using an overall interramp slope angle of 41 degrees.  
This slope is the maximum angle that can be used for a medium consequence of failure (20% probability 
of failure) and a maximum highwall height of 90 m. 

Designs are all based on single benching, using a 3 m bench height.  This is a conservative approach, and 
it may be possible to combine multiple benches, especially in the upper zones of the pit where waste is 
being bulk mined.  In these areas, a possible pit wall configuration would be to use triple benching with 
a 65 degree face angle and 6.4 m wide catch bench. 

16.1.1.3 Groundwater 

The groundwater regime at Kings Valley is currently being characterized at present.  WLC has engaged 
Schlumberger Water Services to conduct an extensive groundwater investigation and prepare a report.  
The results of this investigation were not complete and available for inclusion in the Stage I PFS. 

16.1.1.4 Haul Roads 

Haul roads are 30 m wide with a maximum grade of 10%, measured along the inside of a curve.  
The designed road widths are more than adequate for the largest haul trucks that would be used 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada

(Caterpillar 773).  The 773C truck is 5.4 m wide and has a tire height of 2.2 m.  For haul roads inside the 
pit, a single safety berm on the pit side of the roadway would be required to be at least mid-axle height 
of the largest self-propelled mobile equipment traveling on the road.  Tetra Tech assumes that safety 
berms can be created at a 1.5 horizontal to 1 vertical slope using run-of-mine material.  A flat top on the 
berms of 0.33 m is assumed, and a berm height of 1.2 m allows for one-half the tire height plus a 10% 
margin.  The resulting width of the required safety berm is 3.93 m. 

Haul roads inside of pits where only one safety berm is required are designed to be 30 m wide for two-
way traffic.  Subtracting berm widths, this provides 4.8 times the width of a 773C truck. 

In most cases, ramps were constructed in areas that would later be mined out, to minimize the tonnes 
mined external to the ultimate shell.  Exceptions include the Case 1 haul road for Phase 4, and the 
Case 2 haul road for Phase 3 which were both constructed in waste external to the ultimate pit 
boundary which marked the extent of ore.  Also, the haul roads in the west highwall for the final phase 
of both Case 1 and Case 2 were constructed external to the shell in waste.  It is possible that refinements 
to the schedule could be made, and final access could be via roads constructed with fill material on the 
internal backfilled waste pile.  This option was not explored for this technical report. 

16.1.1.5 Pit Limit Determination 

The ultimate pit limit was determined using GEMCOM Whittle™ Strategic Mine Planning software 
(Whittle).  Only grade model blocks that are classified as measured or indicated were considered as ore.  
Lithium was the only revenue-generating product considered in the Whittle™ analysis.  
Pertinent economic factors for the Whittle run are shown below in Table 16.1.  Mining cost of 
overburden is for waste material that lies above the lithium orebody.  Mining cost (Other) is the cost for 
mining ore and also any waste that is intermixed within the main orebody.

A series of economic shells were generated by the Whittle program.  These shells were used to define 
the ultimate limits of the pit, as well as to determine the location of the first mining phase.  Shell 8 of 
the optimization contained sufficient ore at an average grade of 0.42% Li to feed the mill for over 
20 years.  A portion of Shell 8 included an isolated pit in the southwest corner of the property.  
WLC requested that this target not be included as part of the mine design because it is situated in a 
separate drainage area.  Results of the Whittle run are shown in Table 16.2.

Note: Shell 8 was used as basis for Case 1; Shell 10 was used as basis for Case 2. 
Results include certain smaller pits to the southwest that were not included in the final design. 

16.1.1.6 Cutoff Grade 

The breakeven cutoff grade for the economic parameters assumed in the pit shell analysis was 
calculated using the following formula: 

Value of Ore = Cost of extracting and processing ore 

($13.89/lb Li)*(22.04 lb Li/% Li)*(95% mining recovery)*(87.2% process recovery) = (66+2.75) 

Using the above equation, the percent Li for the breakeven cutoff is 0.27% Li. 

At the request of WLC, the nominal feed grade to the mill was required to be 0.40% Li.  In order to 
achieve this average feed grade from the Kings Valley Lithium deposit, it was necessary to raise the 
cutoff grade for Case 1 to 0.32% Li.  For Case 2, the variable cutoff grade was used (See Table 16.7).  
The average cutoff grade for Case 2 is 0.327% Li.  Therefore, based on the design economics, there is 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 

May 2014 16-5 

some material between 0.27% Li and the applied mining cutoff that could be processed at a profit.  For 
this study, this material was considered to be waste and it was not separately stockpiled. 

The objective of running the Whittle program was to identify economic shells which contained sufficient 
ore at an average grade of approximately 0.40% Li to mill for roughly 20 years.  After deducting material 
in the Whittle shells that fell in unmineable areas except the isolated southwest portion and applying 
the higher design cutoff, it was found that Shells 8 and 10 were a good fit for Case 1 and Case 2 
respectively. 

16.1.1.7 Ultimate Design Pits 

Ultimate pits, phases, and annuals were constructed using PolyMap™ software.  For each case, an 
ultimate pit was first designed, without ramps that defined the final extent of the pit.  Whittle shell 
outlines were used as a guide.  Pit walls were smoothed to remove noses and smooth out bends, and pit 
bottoms were adjusted to allow for sufficient equipment operating room.  After completing the ultimate 
design without ramps, mineable reserves were calculated within the designed shape to verify that 
sufficient ore was contained in the pit for approximately 20 years of production. 

16.1.1.8 Mining Phases and Scheduling 

Within the ultimate shell, a series of smaller mining phases were designed which included ramp access.  
Phases were generally developed in a southeast to northwest pattern.  A minimum pushback width of 
50 m was used between phases. 

When the mining phase designs were complete, a detailed material movement schedule was generated 
using the MicroMODEL® Mansched program.  The scheduling process "mines" the phases in order, and 
the general procedure is to first open up sufficient ore in the first mining phase by prestripping sufficient 
waste prior to production (pre-production).  Then, as ore is being mined from the current phase, the 
next phase or phases are being concurrently prestripped to expose ore faces that would be mined when 
the current phase is mined out.  The schedule needed to meet the required mill feed each year and 
yearly waste mining tonnages were adjusted by forward smoothing in order to level out the total 
material movement in each year. 

16.1.1.9 Annual Dig Plans 

After the detailed annual schedule was in place, annual dig plans were designed to match the annual 
schedule as close as possible with regard to ore tonnes, head grade, and waste tonnes.  Generating the 
dig plans ensures that the proposed schedule is physically achievable with regards to access, number of 
benches mined per year, etc.  

16.1.1.10 Waste Dump Design 

The required waste dump volume was calculated based on the total tonnes of waste to be disposed, the 
average in situ density of the waste, and the assumption of an overall swell factor of 30% (swell plus 
subsequent compaction).  Final dump faces were designed using a 3H:1V slope (18.4 degrees) while 
working faces were designed using a 2H:1V slope (26.6 degrees).  Working faces would later be flattened 
to a 3H:1V slope when mining has finished.  Haul roads in waste dumps were designed using the same 
criteria as in-pit haul roads which is 30 m width and 10% maximum grade.  Waste dump parameters are 
summarized in Table 16.3.

Once the detailed schedule of ore and waste movement was formulated, a plan for disposing of the 
waste rock was needed.  From the annual plans, the year in which backfilling of waste into the pit first 
became feasible was identified.  The amount of external volume needed is the sum of all waste 
produced, prior to the year in which backfilling can commence (with applied swell factor).  An external 
waste dump was designed on the east edge of the final pit which contained the required waste volume. 

Subsequent waste dump phases were designed in which all waste was used to backfill the pit.  
These dump phases were placed in locations which became available for backfilling as the overall mining 
sequence progressed.  Each dump phase contained from two to seven years' worth of waste production.  
Dumps were placed as close to the currently mined areas as possible, to minimize waste haul distances. 

16.1.1.11 Haul Profiles 

For each production year, ore and waste are generally mined from one or two mining phases.  Waste is 
hauled to, at most, two dump phases in a single year.  For each year, average haul profiles were 
generated for the ore haul out of each mining phase to the mill, and for the waste haul from each 
mining phase to each waste dump.  A weighted (by tonnes ore/waste) haul time was then calculated to 
get the average haul time for waste and ore in each year of operation. 

Ore tonnes, grade, and waste tonnes, along with average haul times were consolidated and transferred 
to an Excel spreadsheet.  A detailed cost model was developed, based on these production figures. 

16.1.1.12 Case 1 Mine Design 

A mine plan was developed to deliver lithium ore to the mill, operating at a rate of 2,100 dry tpd, based 
on 365 days of operation per year at 90% availability.  This is equivalent to 689,850 dry tpy of ore.  Ore is 
mined with a Wirtgen surface miner and loaded directly into haul trucks.  The ore is then hauled and 
dumped on a series of drying pads adjacent to the mill.  Waste is mined with a hydraulic excavator, 
loaded into haul trucks, then hauled and dumped.  Waste is initially dumped outside the pit to the east 
and northeast in early years, and then backfilled into the pit in later years as soon as it is feasible. 

As noted earlier, the Whittle Shell 8 was used to design an ultimate pit without ramps.  A comparison of 
material contained in Shell 8, (excluding that in the isolated southwest area) and the final design without 
ramps is presented in Table 16.4.  The designed pit contains more ore at a slightly lower grade, and a 
slightly higher strip ratio.  A plan view map of Whittle Shell 8 is presented in Figure 16.1 and a plan view 
map of the Case 1 Final Design is presented in Figure 16.2.  Cross sectional views through the Case 1 pit 
are provided in Figure 16.3 and Figure 16.4.

A plan view drawing showing the order in which the phases are mined is presented in Figure 16.5. 

.  The first mining phase was situated roughly in the location of Whittle Shell 6, which identifies a higher 
profitability area containing approximately three years of production.  Other phases were developed in 
a southeast to northwest pattern.  In general, a minimum pushback width of 50 m was used between 
phases.  The Case 1 phase reserves are shown in the following Table 16.5.

Case 1 Waste Dump Design 

A series of four waste dump phases were designed for the Case 1 scenario.  Dumps were designed 
assuming an overall swell factor of 30%.  Phase 1 is external to the pit, and is needed for handling waste 
from pre-production through Year 7.  The remaining three phases are backfill phases and are needed to 
handle waste from production for Years 8 and beyond.  The capacity of each Case 1 dump phase is 
presented in Table 16.6.

Case 1 Waste Mining Schedule 

Prestripping of 2.5 million dry tonnes of waste would occur in the year prior to the start of production.  
Waste movement in production Years 1 through 7 holds generally steady at around 2.2 million dry tpy.  
Waste production expands to 2.5 million dry tpy in Years 8 through 15, and then quickly declines in 
production Year 16 and beyond.  

Case 1 In-Pit Inferred Resources 

For Case 1, inferred resources were considered as waste and not used in the economic analysis.  
Note that CIM standards define inferred resources as: 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but 
not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited information and sampling 
gathered through appropriate techniques for locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes.  

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that 
all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral 
Resource as a result of continued exploration. 

The Case 1 pit designs contain a total of 44,000 tonnes of inferred material above a 0.320% Li cutoff.  
The average grade of the inferred material is 0.330% Li, 3.42% K, and 1.34% Na. 

16.1.1.13 Case 2 Mine Design 

A second mine plan, Case 2, was developed to deliver lithium ore to the mill, operating at a rate of 
2,100 dry tpd, based on 365 days of operation per year at 90% availability for the first three years of 
operation.  Then, in Year 4, the production rate is doubled.  This is equivalent to 689,850 dry tpy of ore 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 16-13 

for Years 1 through 3, and 1,379,700 dry tpy of ore for Years 4 and beyond.  Ore is mined with a Wirtgen 
surface miner and loaded directly into haul trucks.  The ore is then hauled and dumped on a series of 
drying pads adjacent to the mill.  Waste is mined by hydraulic excavator, loaded into haul trucks, then 
hauled and dumped.  Waste is initially dumped outside the pit to the east and northeast in early years, 
and then backfilled into the pit in later years as soon as it is feasible. 

One change in design criteria for Case 2 vs. Case 1 was that WLC requested a variable cutoff strategy be 
implemented that would maintain a mill feed grade close to or exceeding 0.40% Li in the first half of the 
project.  In order to meet this requirement, the ore cutoff was set according to the schedule presented 
in Table 16.7.

As noted earlier, the Whittle Shell 10 was used as the template for designing an ultimate pit without 
ramps.  A comparison of material contained in Shell 10, excluding the shapes that are in the separate 
drainage, vs. the final design without ramps is presented in Table 16.8.  The designed pit contains less 
ore at a slightly lower grade, and a higher strip ratio.  A plan view map of Whittle Shell 10 is presented in 
Figure 16.6 and a plan view map of the Case 1 Final Design is presented in Figure 16.7.  Cross sectional 
views through the Case 1 pit are provided in Figure 16.8 and Figure 16.9.

Case 2 Mining Schedule 

A mining schedule was developed based on mining the sequence of eight phases.  Initial top-down 
schedules were used to determine peak waste mining years, and waste was forward scheduled in order 
to level out yearly fluctuations.  The goal of the schedule was to develop a sequence of material 
movement, which could be used as a guide in developing detailed annual dig plans.  By keeping the total 
material movement constant for long periods of time, fluctuations in fleet requirements are reduced 
assuming relatively constant haul distances. 

Detailed dig plans were developed to cover one year of pre-production, and each of the 20 years of 
production.  Each dig plan was designed to come within a few thousand tonnes of the targeted 
production for ore and waste for that period.  A summary of mined ore and waste material was 
generated for each period, based on the dig plans. 

A series of six waste dump phases were designed for the Case 2 scenario.  The capacity of each dump 
phase is presented in Table 16.10.

Case 2 Waste Mining Schedule 

For this model, prestripping of six million dry tonnes of waste is assumed to occur in the 18 months prior 
to the start of production.  However, an option remains for WLC to defer the prestripping to a later year 
depending on market conditions.  Waste movement in Years 1 through 8 would hold generally steady at 
around 3.9 to 4.0 million dry tpy.  Waste production would expand to about 5.2 million dry tpy in Years 8 
through 14, ramp up further to around seven million dry tpy for Years 15 through 18, and then quickly 
decline in Years 19 and 20 

In the Case 2 scenario that Tetra Tech evaluated the additional stripping required was extended from 
pre-production through the first 3 years of production in order to levelize the equipment and manpower 
requirements associated with the additional waste removal.  WLC could potentially pushout this 
additional stripping by starting the project using the Case 1 schedule and making the decision to 
increase production later.  This option accounts for the additional waste stripping to later in the project 
life.  Tetra Tech did not evaluate this scenario. 

Case 2 In-Pit Inferred Resources 

For Case 2, inferred resources were considered as waste and not used in the economic analysis.  

The Case 2 pit designs contain a total of 257,000 tonnes of inferred material above a 0.320% Li cutoff.  
The average grade of the inferred material is 0.374% Li, 3.81% K and 1.55% Na. 

16.1.2 Equipment Selection 

Both Case 1 and Case 2 have been planned as an open-pit mine using end-dump haul trucks, hydraulic 
excavators for waste removal, and a Wirtgen surface miner for selective ore mining.  The Wirtgen 
surface miner was selected as the primary ore stripping machine to aid in selective mining of the ore.  
The Wirtgen can achieve a cutting depth of 0 to 28 cm, allowing for greater selectivity and grade control.  
The Wirtgen machine also makes a primary crushing circuit unnecessary, as cut material is sized to less 
than 50 mm.  

The Wirtgen machine would also allow for selective removal of ash bands present within the mineralized 
claystone.  This level of detail was not included in the Stage I PFS as the ash bands had yet to be 
identified within the geological model.

16.1.2.1 Operating Schedule 

The mining operations have been scheduled on 350 operating days per year with two 12-hour shifts per 
day.  Equipment operations and manpower would use a rotating four crew shift schedule.  
Equipment mechanical availability has been set to 90% with an effective utilization of 84%.  
Mechanical availability takes into account planned and unplanned mechanical down time due to 
maintenance and equipment failure.  Utilization takes into account down time associated with shift 
changes, employee breaks and weather delays.  Using these factors results in 8,400 hours of available 
working time per year and 6,350 operating hours per year.  

16.1.2.2 Case 1 Equipment Selection 

Primary waste removal is achieved using a single Hitachi EX1200-6 excavator with a 6.3 m3 bucket 
matched with Caterpillar 770 haul trucks with a rated payload of 36 tonnes.  Primary ore removal is 
achieved with a Wirtgen 2200SM surface miner.  This machine would direct load Caterpillar 770 haul 
trucks using an available elevated conveyor discharge system mounted to the front of the machine.  

Excavator and Wirtgen productivities were calculated based upon the scheduled time, availability, 
utilizations, truck, and material properties.  Productivities are reflective of minimal down time due to 
the loading operations waiting on trucks.  The Wirtgen surface miner productivity exceeds the 
production rate required to feed the process plant.  Tetra Tech determined that ore and waste 
operations would result in significant downtime thus increasing operational costs utilizing a dedicated 
ore and waste operation.  Therefore, waste operations would occur for approximately five days per 
week with the remaining two days used for ore operations.  This allows for the most effective use of 
operating labor and decreased demand for trucks.  The trucks would be shared between the ore and 
waste operations.  The excavator and Wirtgen would be operated using the same operator thus saving 
labor costs.  The Wirtgen hourly productivity was quoted to Tetra Tech from Wirtgen America as 
768 short tons per scheduled hour.  This estimate equates to 627 tonnes per hour with a 10% decline in 
productivity due to direct loading of haul trucks.  Table 16.11, Case 1 Excavator Productivity Estimate, 
shows the excavator productivity calculation.  

Truck productivity is based on truck-cycle times from the loading point to either the ROM ore stockpile 
or the appropriate waste dump location.  Truck cycle times were developed for each year based upon a 
weighted average truck cycle time from the various mining phases utilized in each year to either the 
ROM ore stockpile for ore truck cycle times or to the waste dump phase for waste truck cycle times.  
The truck cycle times were then used to determine the number of truck hours required for ore and 
waste removal and subsequently the number of trucks required to meet the mine plan schedule.  

The following major mining equipment is utilized in the mine plan: 

• 1 Hitachi EX1200-6 Excavator 

• 1 Wirtgen 2200SM Surface Miner 

• 3 to 5 Caterpillar 770 Haul Trucks 

• 1 Caterpillar D9 Dozer 

• 1 Caterpillar 980 Front End Loader 

• 1 Caterpillar 16M Motor Grader 

• 1 5,000 Gallon Water Truck

Case 1 Support and Utility Equipment 

Support equipment was selected to perform operations supporting ore and waste removal.  
This includes a Caterpillar D9 dozer working on the waste dump, spreading waste material as it is 
dumped by the haul trucks.  The dozer would also perform miscellaneous road work, pit cleanup and 
other support functions as required.  A Caterpillar 980 class rubber tired front end loader would be used 
to support the hydraulic excavator and to perform secondary loading of the haul trucks when required.  
The hydraulic excavator would not be mobile enough or have sufficient reach to clean up the active pit 
area.  A Caterpillar 16M motor grader and 5,000-gallon water truck would perform haul road 
maintenance and provide dust suppression.  

A fleet of utility vehicles would be on site for maintenance and utility work around the mine site.  
This includes a small backhoe loader for general site maintenance; fuel and lube trucks for in-pit 
refueling and lubrication of equipment; a service truck for in-pit equipment service; light plants for 
lighting of the in-pit and waste dump operations; and pickup trucks for supervisory personnel, surveying 
and crew transportation.

16.1.2.3 Case 2 Equipment Selection 

For the first seven years of the mine plan, primary waste removal is achieved using a single Hitachi 
EX1200-6 excavator with a 6.3 m3 bucket matched with Caterpillar 770 haul trucks with a rated payload 
of 36 tonnes.  After year seven the Hitachi EX1200-6 would be replaced with a Hitachi EX1900-6 with an 
11.0 m3 bucket.  A fleet of larger Caterpillar 773 haul trucks with a rated payload of 54 tonnes would be 
purchased which match the larger excavator.  The existing Caterpillar 770 haul trucks would be moved 
to ore operations resulting in an excess of trucks available for ore operations.  Primary ore removal is 
achieved with a Wirtgen 2200SM surface miner.  This machine would direct load Caterpillar 770 haul 
trucks using an available elevated conveyor discharge system mounted to the front of the machine.  

Excavator and Wirtgen productivities were calculated based upon the scheduled time, availability, 
utilizations, truck, and material properties.  Productivities are reflective of minimal down time due to 
the loading operations waiting on trucks.  The Wirtgen surface miner productivity exceeds the 
production rate required to feed the process plant.  As a result, ore operations would be performed 
during day shift only utilizing a rotating two crew shift schedule.  The Wirtgen hourly productivity was 
quoted to Tetra Tech from Wirtgen America as 768 short tons per scheduled hour.  This estimate 
equates to 627 tonnes per hour with a 10% decline in productivity due to direct loading of haul trucks.  
Table 16.12, Case 2 Excavator Productivity Estimate, shows the excavator productivity calculation.  

Truck productivity is based on truck-cycle times from the loading point to either the ROM ore stockpile 
or the appropriate waste dump location.  Truck cycle times were developed for each year based upon a 
weighted average truck cycle time from the various mining phases utilized in each year to either the 
ROM ore stockpile for ore truck cycle times or to the waste dump phase for waste truck cycle times.  
The truck cycle times were then used to determine the number of truck hours required for ore and 
waste removal and subsequently the number of trucks required to meet the mine plan schedule.  

The following major mining equipment is utilized in the mine plan: 

• 1 Hitachi EX1200-6 Excavator through Year 7 

• 1 Hitachi EX1900-6 Excavator for Year 8 through LOM 

• 1 Wirtgen 2200SM Surface Miner 

• 9 Caterpillar 770 Haul Trucks 

 3 for Ore operations through Year 7 

 6 for waste operations through Year 7 

 9 for ore operations from Year 8 through LOM  

• 4 to 7 Caterpillar 773 Haul Trucks 

• 1 Caterpillar D9 Dozer 

• 1 Caterpillar 980 Front End Loader 

• 1 Caterpillar 16M Motor Grader 

• 1 5,000 Gallon Water Truck

Case 2 Support and Utility Equipment 

Support equipment was selected to perform operations supporting ore and waste removal.  
This includes a Caterpillar D10 dozer working on the waste dump spreading waste material as it is 
dumped by the haul trucks.  The dozer would also perform miscellaneous road work, pit cleanup and 
other support function as required.  A Caterpillar 988 class rubber tired front end loader would be used 
to support the hydraulic excavator and perform secondary loading of the haul trucks when required.

Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 16-20 

The hydraulic excavator would not be mobile enough or have sufficient reach to clean up the active pit 
area.  A Caterpillar 16M motor grader and 5,000-gallon water truck would perform haul road 
maintenance and provide dust suppression.  

A fleet of utility vehicles would be on site for maintenance and utility work around the mine site.  
This includes a small backhoe loader for general site maintenance; fuel and lube trucks for in-pit 
refueling and lubrication of equipment; a service truck for in-pit equipment service; light plants for 
lighting of the in-pit and waste dump operations; and pickup trucks for supervisory personnel, surveying 
and crew transportation.

17.1.1 Introduction 

The Kings Valley process plant has a design ore throughput of 2,100 tpd for Case 1.  The plant would 
operate 365 days per year and process a total of 689,850 tpy of ore with nominal production of 
13,200 tpy of Li2CO3, 46,600 tpy of K2SO4, and 53,400 tpy of Na2SO4.  The plant would consist of two 
sections: a size reduction and thermal ore preparation circuit designed by Tetra Tech and a wet recovery 
circuit designed by K-UTEC. 

17.1.2 Process Design Criteria 

Major process design criteria are shown in Table 17.1.  Detailed criteria for the dry ore preparation 
circuit are included in Technical Reference E.

17.1.3 Process Flowsheet Development 

The simplified flowsheet schematics for the dry ore preparation circuit is illustrated in Figure 17.1, 
Dry Ore Preparation Process Flow Diagram and for the wet recovery circuit is illustrated in Figure 17.2, 
Wet Recovery Process Flow Diagram, were used as the design basis for this study.  The flowsheet is 
based on the process developed by WLC as described in the PAEE (URS 2010), updated by recent 
metallurgical testing and development work at Hazen, CICITEM, K-UTEC and Outotec. 

Conventional equipment used in the mineral processing and chemical industries is depicted in the 
flowsheets.  The ore would be reduced in size with roll crushers designed to process wet clay in advance 
of roller mills that would provide the final stage of size reduction.  The calciner would be a rotary 
machine while the dryer and cooler associated with the calciner would be fluidized bed units, all 
common in the cement industry.  The vessels, tanks, evaporators, crystallizers, filters and other 
equipment in the wet recovery circuit are standard in the salt industry.

17.1.4 Process Plant Siting 

Considerations dictating the location of the process plant and ancillary facilities include: 

• Favorable topography to minimize earthworks 

• Proximity to the mine to minimize ore transport cost 

• Proximity to existing infrastructure 

The identified plant site is on the south side of the pit.  The coarse ore stockpiles and grizzly would be 
located at the edge of the pit to minimize ore transport.  The mine truck shop would be adjacent to the 
plant site. 

The fresh water source for process and site requirements is anticipated to be drawn from a Project area 
well field.  WLC has acquired water rights for the project area and initiated a groundwater study. 

17.1.5 Dry Ore Preparation Process Description 

The first section of the process plant would include size reduction, blending of the ore with reagents, 
and calcining to convert the silicate minerals to sulfates. 

17.1.5.1 Size Reduction 

Ore would be mined from the deposit with a Wirtgen surface miner.  A Wirtgen has the ability to 
electively mine ore from the ash layers to minimize dilution and can be configured to produce a minus 
50 mm product, eliminating the requirement for a primary crusher.  Ore would be trucked to one of 
eight ore stockpiles, each with a capacity of approximately one day of plant throughput that would be 
tilled with a disk to facilitate evaporation of a portion of the contained moisture.  Ore would be 
reclaimed from the stockpiles to a grizzly with a front-end loader. 

Grizzly undersize would drop onto an apron feeder to a conveyor delivering the ore to two roll crushers 
that would reduce the ore size to minus 6 mm. 

Roll crusher discharge would be conveyed to a crushed ore storage bin for distribution to two Raymond 
ore mills that would reduce the ore size to minus 149 µm and reduce the moisture content from 16% to 
12%.  The mill systems would include classifiers and recovery cyclones.  Exhaust from the calcine cooler 
would provide heated air for the mills with propane-fired burners available for supplemental heat.  
Ground ore would be stored in a dedicated silo. 

17.1.5.2 Reagent Preparation 

Reagents, minus 10-mm anhydrite and minus 13-mm dolomite, would be trucked to the property and 
delivered to dedicated silos.  The reagents would be fed to a dry grinding circuit for size reduction to 
minus 149 µm.  The dry grinding circuit would include a classifier and recovery cyclone.  Product would 
be conveyed to a reagent hopper. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 17-6 

Ground ore and reagents, anhydrite and dolomite, would be proportionally metered to a granulator for 
mixing and production of 2-mm-diameter granules at 12% moisture.  The granulator would discharge to 
a rotary table feeder that would provide continuous feed to the dryer. 

The granules would be dried with heat recovered from the calciner off-gas in a fluidized bed dryer.  
The dryer system would include a forced draft blower and an exhaust fan.  Moisture in the granules 
would be reduced from 12% to 0%. 

17.1.5.3 Calcining 

Dried granules would be conveyed to a coal-fired rotary calciner and heated to 1,050°C for 15 minutes.  
Calcine would discharge the calciner and be elevated to the fluidized bed cooler.  Off-gas from the 
calciner would exhaust the dryer to a baghouse for recovery of fines containing lithium and a scrubber 
before venting to atmosphere. 

Ambient air would be forced through the cooler to reduce the calcine temperature to 200°C.  
Cooled calcine would be conveyed to a leach circuit.  A bunker would be provided for storage ahead of 
the leach circuit to allow for orderly reduction in calciner operation in Case of leach circuit downtime.  
Recovered heat in the cooler exhaust would be utilized for calciner combustion air, Raymond mill air and 
coal pulverized air. 

Coal would be trucked to a 5,000-t stockpile from a transload site on the railroad and reclaimed via a 
feeder to a coal pulverizing system. 

A lime slaker would be provided to produce milk-of-lime for the off-gas scrubber. 

A coal-fired boiler would be is provided to supply steam requirements as calculated by K-UTEC. 

17.1.6 Wet Recovery Process Description  

17.1.6.1 Leaching 

Calcine would be leached with water at 70°C in a series of three agitated tanks.  Solids from each tank 
would be filtered and rinsed before advancing to the next tank.  Brine would be piped countercurrent to 
the solids flow to maximized concentration of lithium and potassium.  Overflow brine from the first 
leach tank would advance to a calcium removal stage. 

Leach residue from the third leach tank would be filtered and conveyed to a drystack tailings storage 
facility. 

17.1.6.2 First Calcium Removal Stage 

Leach brine would be clarified, advanced to a CaCO3 precipitation vessel to effect removal of calcium 
and filtered before advancing to evaporation. 

17.1.6.3 K2SO4 Production 

Potassium sulfate recovery is based on glaserite crystallization followed by glaserite decomposition and 
the addition of water.   



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 17-7 

Leach brine from the first calcium removal stage would be combined with Glauber salt mother liquor, 
glaserite decomposition liquor and Thenardite mother liquor (Thenardite is anhydrous Na2SO4,) for 
evaporation in a triple effect system.  The combined brine would be heated with steam in dedicated 
heat exchangers.  Glaserite suspension from the third evaporator would be thickened, cycloned and 
centrifuged before advancing via conveyor to an agitated decomposition reactor. 

Glaserite decomposition would be affected by the controlled addition of water to the reactor.  
Decomposition reactor underflow would be cycloned and centrifuged, producing a raw K2SO4 product 
that would advance to a cold-leaching reactor for purification.  Overflow from the leaching reactor 
would be clarified and returned to the evaporators as glaserite decomposition liquor. 

Raw K2SO4 product would be leached in a reactor with cold water, cycloned, centrifuged and conveyed 
to a dryer.  Dryer discharge, the final product, would be conveyed to the packaging area.  Dryer exhaust 
would be cycloned and filtered before discharging to atmosphere.  Cold leach brine would be recycled to 
the decomposition reactor. 

17.1.6.4 Second Calcium Removal Stage 

Pre-heated glaserite mother liquor from the evaporation stage would be mixed with pre-heated sodium 
carbonate to precipitate calcium carbonate in an agitated precipitation reactor at 60°C.  
Precipitate would be filtered and the sludge returned to the leach circuit.  Overflow would be thickened 
to separate contained CaCO3 solids and the purified overflow advanced to ion exchange for removal of 
the remaining calcium as well as magnesium.  Purified brine would advance to the Li2CO3 precipitation 
reactor. 

17.1.6.5 Li2CO3 Production 

Lithium carbonate recovery is based on precipitation from the glaserite mother liquor with Na2CO3. 

Sodium carbonate would be added to the agitated reactor to affect precipitation of Li2CO3 at 90°C.  
The underflow would be pumped to a belt filter for washing before advancing to an agitated washing 
vessel.  Overflow would be thickened to clarify the Li2CO3 mother liquor and pumped to Glauber salt 
crystallization. 

Underflow from the washing vessel would be filtered, dried and conveyed to the packaging area.  
Exhaust from the dryer would be cycloned and filtered for recovery of lithium carbonate before venting 
to atmosphere.  Overflow from the washing vessel would be returned as washing brine to the first leach 
tank and the Li2CO3 precipitate belt filter. 

17.1.6.6 Na2SO4 Production 

Sodium sulfate recovery is based on crystallization of barren Li2CO3 liquor to produce Glauber salt, and 
evaporation of water from the suspension. 

Li2CO3 mother liquor would be pumped to a cooling crystallizer for precipitation of the Glauber salt.  
The Glauber salt suspension would be pumped to a thickener to separate the solids from the mother 
liquor.  Thickener underflow would be centrifuged and advanced to a conversion vessel. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 17-8 

Conversion of the Glauber salt suspension to Thenardite would be affected by heating the suspension to 
60°C.  The resulting water-free product would be cycloned, centrifuged, dried and conveyed to the 
packaging area.  Dryer exhaust would be cycloned and scrubbed before venting to atmosphere. 

Thenardite mother liquor would be pumped to a triple-effect evaporation system.  The liquor would be 
heated with steam in dedicated heat exchangers.  The resulting Thenardite suspension would be 
returned to the conversion vessel to increase the yield of Thenardite. 

17.1.6.7 Recoveries 

Overall recoveries from the WLC process are listed below: 

Lithium 87.2% 

Potassium 77.7% 

Sodium 82.7% 

17.1.7 Product Packaging 

All three products would be packaged in 1000-kg super sacks in vendor-supplied packing lines.  A fourth 
packing line would be provided to pack Li2CO3 in 12.5-kg bags. 

17.1.8 Equipment Sizing 

Details of the equipment that was used to develop the capital cost estimate for Case 1 are shown in the 
equipment list found in Technical Reference E.  

17.1.9 Energy Recovery 

The flowsheet is designed to recover energy from the calcination and steam generation processes to 
reduce overall energy consumption. 

17.1.10 Expanded Case 

The flowsheet for Case 2, with production doubled in Year 4, would be the same as for Case 1.  For the 
PFS, it is assumed the Case 1 process equipment would be duplicated where required to increase 
capacity for Case 2. 

17.1.11 Process Energy and Water Requirements 

The project will require electricity, coal fuel and water to support the process operations. 

Electrical power demand for the process will be supplied from the existing 115 kV power line.  Based on 
the estimated electrical demand from the operations, there is sufficient electrical power supply to meet 
the demand for the Case 1 scenario.  This power line is owned and maintained by Harney Electric, the 
local co-op utility provider.  WLC would engage in a contractual agreement with Harney Electric for the 
supply electricity.  Power supply has not been evaluated for Case 2. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 17-9 

Coal would be used to fuel both the calciner and the necessary boiler for steam requirements.  
While WLC has not selected a coal supplier at this time, the Project has begun looking into potential 
suppliers from Wyoming or Utah.  Coal would be railed near the project site to an unloading facility near 
Winnemucca.  From there, the coal would be hauled and stockpiled at the Project site via truck. 

Water rights have been attained by WLC.  An independent groundwater study is currently under 
preparation, but results of the study have not been completed.  It is anticipated from preliminary results 
from this effort that water would be sourced at the Project site; however, this remains to be confirmed.

The following applies to the Project.  Note, in preparation of the Stage II Resource Technical Report, 
infrastructure is not considered and have no economics applied.   

1 8 . 1  E X I S T I N G  P R O J E C T  A N D  S I T E  A C C E S S  

The Project site in northern Nevada is near several established large-scale mining operations.  The site 
has the advantage of good accessibility on paved all-season roads from Interstate 80 at Winnemucca 
70 km north via US Highway 95 to Orovada, and 33 km west-northwest on State Highway 293 to the 
project site. 

Roads accessing the Stage I area are all-season and in generally good repair, but may be closed for short 
periods due to extreme weather in the winter.  Local access to the Stage II Lens is currently an 
unimproved gravel road that at times during the winter months can be impassable.  The access to this 
area will require upgrading. 

Rail service for potentially transloading coal is available at Winnemucca, Golconda (24 km east of 
Winnemucca), and the Valmy power station.  

1 8 . 2  P R O X I M I T Y  O F  P R O P E R T Y  T O  P O P U L A T I O N  C E N T E R S  

Orovada is a center for the local agricultural community with an estimated area population of less than 
1,000.  Winnemucca is a major mining supply hub with all the services of a town with a population of 
7,400, including health and medical. 

Elko, 264 km east of Winnemucca, and Reno, 264 km southwest of Winnemucca (both on Interstate 80), 
offer commercial air service. 

Because of the large-scale gold mining industry in the Winnemucca area, local resources include all of 
the amenities required for large-scale mining.  The area is about 50 km north of the now depleted 
Sleeper gold mine and 100 km northwest of Twin Creeks, Turquoise Ridge, and Getchell gold mines.  
Several other gold and copper mines are in the area, providing an experienced work force and adequate 
support for mining operations.  Most of the workers may have to be sourced in Winnemucca because of 
the sparse population in the Project area.   

The proximity to Winnemucca eliminates the need for a man camp at site.  Employees could be bussed 
from Winnemucca on a daily basis.

Adequate electrical power is available, but power lines may need to be added and/or upgraded to 
provide power to the site as the Project develops.  A 115-kV power line runs adjacent to State Highway 
293 and has adequate capacity for the Case 1 process plant equipment and infrastructure.  The electrical 
capacity needs for Case 2 has not been evaluated.

No surface water is present at the site.  However, water is available in the region and can be sourced 
from either the Kings River Valley, west of the project, or Queens River Valley located east of the 
project.  The nearest railroad access is located in Winnemucca.   

1 8 . 4  S T A G E  I  P F S  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E  D E S I G N  

The road access for Stage I are laid out to provide access to the site, the open pit mining operation, the 
waste rock storage facility, processing plant, and dry stack TSF.  All roads are with a width of 30 m, not 
including any required safety berms. 

Process fluids will be contained in the Barren Purge Containment Pond, located south of the processing 
facilities.  The lined pond will be constructed with 2.5H:1V side slopes and a total depth of 5.0 m, which 
includes a minimum freeboard requirement of 1.0m.  The pond will be constructed with a bottom 
elevation of 1498 m above mean sea level (amsl) and a total capacity of approximately 51,000 m3 of 
solution at a maximum water elevation of 1501.5 amsl.  A small pipeline corridor will be constructed to 
convey piped flows from the processing facilities to the Barren Purge Containment Pond.  Both the pond 
and the pipeline corridor will be lined with a 60-mil LLDPE geomembrane liner underlain by a 0.3 m thick 
(minimum) subgrade layer consisting of reworked and compacted fine grained subgrade.  

A basic water balance was developed to determine the sizing of the pond.  The results of the water 
balance indicated that the pond could fully contain all of the inflows from the processing facilities as well 
as precipitation.  The only outflow for the system is evaporation.  Normal conditions for precipitation 
and evaporation were assumed and average values were extracted from the Kings River Valley and Rye 
Patch Dam weather stations; however, the actual evaporation rate may be lower due to the 
composition of the process solution.  This assumption will be verified in more advanced studies. 

Surface water will be diverted away from the open pit mining operations, waste rock storage facility, 
processing plant, and dry stack TSF via surface water diversion channels.  The diversion channels were 
sized to contain the flows from a 100-year, 24-hour storm event, and the cross-section was designed so 
that the diversion channels can be constructed using equipment available at the site.  The diversions will 
have a bottom width of 5.0 m, side slopes of 2H:1V, and a total depth of 2.0 m, including 1.0 m of 
freeboard.  The diversions will be constructed in stages in order to accommodate the changing pit and 
waste rock storage facility footprints.

19 .0  MAR KET STUD IES  AND  CON TRAC TS 
1 9 . 1  S T A G E  I  

19.1.1 Introduction 

WLC commissioned a market study for the three saleable products recovered from the process 
described in this study: lithium carbonate, potassium sulfate, and sodium sulfate.  The reports were 
updated in mid-year 2011 and contain detailed reviews of the supply and demand outlook for each 
commodity.  In its initiation of the market evaluation, WLC engaged a consultant in each associated 
area, to determine the market potential for the lithium, potassium, and sodium products.  The results of 
these efforts are presented below.  

WLC has not entered into any contractual off-take agreements for the sale of the three products. 

19.1.2 Lithium Carbonate (Li2CO3) 

19.1.2.1 Demand 

The largest consumers of lithium are the manufacturers of glass, ceramics and batteries.  
Future demand for lithium will be driven by the volume of production in these industries. 

19.1.2.2 Specifications 

The minimum Li2CO3 content for product used by the battery industry is 99.5%.  

19.1.2.3 Prices 

The market study concluded that US$6000 per tonne of Li2CO3 is a reasonable estimate in the current 
economic environment and has been used FOB the Project site as the basis for the PFS. 

19.1.2.4 Market Entry  

An established market exists and entry is competitive and contingent on price and the ability to insure 
delivery over the life of a contract  

19.1.3 Potassium Sulfate (K2SO4) 

19.1.3.1 Demand 

Ninety-five percent of current global consumption of potassium is in fertilizers.  Potassium sulfate is the 
second most common potassium fertilizer.  Future demand for production from Nevada will be 
dependent on agricultural consumption on the west coast of the US, and exports. 

19.1.3.2 Specifications 

The minimum potash (K2O) content for potassium sulfate fertilizer is 50%.

May 2014 19-2 

19.1.3.3 Prices 

The market study concluded that US$600 per tonne is a reasonable estimate of the average selling price 
in 2011 and this price FOB the project site has been used as the basis for the PFS. 

19.1.3.4 Market Entry 

An established market exists and entry is competitive and contingent on price and the ability to ensure 
delivery over the life of a contract Potassium Sulfate (K2SO4). 

19.1.4 Sodium Sulfate (Na2SO4) 

19.1.4.1 Demand 

The largest consumers of sodium sulfate are the manufacturers of soap and detergents and glass, and 
pulp and paper industry.  Future demand for lithium will be driven by the volume of production in these 
industries. 

19.1.4.2 Specifications 

The minimum sodium sulfate content for commercial grade is 99%.  

19.1.4.3 Prices 

The market study relied on a USGS estimate of US$140 per tonne.  A price of US$75 per tonne FOB the 
project site has been used as the basis for the PFS due to the distance to potential consumers. 

19.1.4.4 Market Entry 

An established market exists and entry is competitive and contingent on price and the ability to ensure 
delivery over the life of a contract Sodium Sulfate (Na2SO4).

This section summarizes the overall permitting and approval program that will be and have been 
completed by WLC under both the Case 1 and Case 2 Project scenarios in order to construct, operate 
and close the proposed Kings Valley Lithium mine and ore processing facilities (Project).  This program 
includes obtaining the necessary permits and approvals from various federal, state and local 
government agencies as appropriate, and the completion of a baseline study program to collect data for 
environmental, natural and socio-economic resources that will be used to support the permitting and 
approval process.  As part of the overall permitting and approval process, an environmental 
documentation program completed in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) will be completed to assess the potential impacts to the human and natural environment that 
could result from the implementation of project activities. 

20.1.1 Environmental Baseline Studies 

A baseline study program has been initiated to collect the environmental, natural resource and socio-
economic data required to support the completion of the multi-federal and state agency permitting and 
approval program, and the anticipated environmental documentation process that will be required 
under NEPA.  This baseline program includes, but is not limited to, studies for the following standard 
resource issues and topics:  

• General vegetation 

• General wildlife (including extensive surveys for Greater Sage-grouse) 

• Special status vegetation and wildlife species including those species managed under the 
requirements of the Federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended

The results of all baseline surveys performed to date indicate the following:  

• The Project area does not contain any jurisdictional waters of the US or wetlands, and would 
not require a Section 404 permit under the CWA.  On October 12, 2012, the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers concurred with the survey findings and verified that there are no jurisdictional 
waters of the U.S. (including wetlands) within the Kings Valley survey area. Project activities 
will not impact any threatened or endangered vegetation or wildlife species.  Based on 
these survey results, a Section 7 Consultation Process with the US Fish and Wildlife Service is 
not required for the Project (WLC, 2011d).  

• Based on the geochemical characterization results, the waste rock material associated with 
the project presents a low risk for acid rock drainage and metal leaching (ARDML). Humidity 
cell tests were run for 47 weeks (and 74 weeks for cell 9). Results from the humidity cell 
tests indicate acid generation is not predicted for any of the waste rock material types that 
will be mined (SRK, 2013c; SRK, 2012d; SRK, 2012e).  

Agency Consultation Activities  

In June 2011, WLC initiated consultation and coordination activities with appropriate federal and state 
regulatory agency specialists to ensure that the environmental and natural baseline study data is 
collected using approved procedures and protocols to meet appropriate data adequacy standards that 
will support the multi-federal and state agency permitting program and the anticipated NEPA 
environmental documentation process (WLC, 2011i).  Since this time, WLC has continued to keep 
agencies involved as to the progress of the project.  This consultation and coordination program will 
continue through the completion of the definitive feasibility study process and up to the initiation of the 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 20-6 

NEPA environmental documentation program and the completion of the permitting and approval 
process.  

In accordance with Nevada Bureau of Land Management (BLM) guidance outlined in Instructional 
Memorandum IM NV-2011-004, In January 2012, WLC held a pre-mine plan of operations review 
meeting with the management and Interdepartmental (ID) Team of the BLM's Winnemucca District 
Office.  A follow-up meeting between the BLM and WLC was performed in April 2014.  

Environmental Baseline Study Data Gap Analysis  

Tetra Tech's review of the completed and ongoing baseline study program indicates that WLC has 
initiated the essential environmental and natural resource baseline studies to support the permitting 
and approval program and the NEPA environmental documentation process for the Project.  The studies 
completed to date and the ongoing studies appear to be adequate and in conformance with what are 
typically performed for mining projects located on BLM-managed public lands in Nevada.  

As part of the ongoing baseline study program and the definitive feasibility study, WLC will develop a 
scope of work for an air quality monitoring and modeling program.  The scope of work will be based on 
the components selected for the final process engineering design.  WLC will coordinate this activity with 
the key regulatory agencies including the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP), Bureau 
of Air Quality (BAQ), and the BLM to ensure that the program will support the state air quality 
permitting process and the NEPA environmental documentation program.  Note that the NDEP BAQ has 
primacy for air quality activities in Humboldt County under the Federal Clean Air Act of 1970, as 
amended.  

20.1.1.2 Environmental Baseline Study Cost Estimate 

Between 2007 and 2014, WLC spent an estimated US$1,300,000.00 for baseline studies and associated 
analysis.  The 2014 cost estimate will be revised as Project development activities progress, which will 
include the completion of the definitive feasibility study.  

The estimated cost to complete the air quality monitoring and modeling program will be developed 
after the final process engineering design has been selected and the proposed air quality program scope 
of work has been reviewed with the NDEP BAQ and the BLM.

Dave Hayes, Assistant Field Manager Nonrenewable Resources, Winnemucca Field Office (dated 
June 26, 2007), indicated that the Notice of Intent was complete and that other permits were not 
required because the area of disturbance is less than five acres.  That letter required that WLC have a 
cultural resources study performed and acknowledgement that the required financial guarantee was 
accepted for the project prior to beginning work on the project.  

On October 3, 2007, WEDC received a letter from Dave Hayes of BLM that acknowledged receipt and 
acceptance of the cultural survey and permitted operations as soon as the financial security was 
received.  Financial security was acknowledged in a letter from the State of Nevada Commission on 
Mineral Resources, Division of Minerals dated 5 September 2007.  The letter indicated that copies were 
sent to the appropriate BLM Field Offices.  AMEC was also provided with the Surface Management 
Personal Bond Rider form OMB No.1004-0194 detailing Surface Management Bond No. NVB-000493, 
and a receipt for the total amount of the bond. 

A Plan of Operation (POO) was submitted to the BLM and the Nevada Department of Environmental 
Protection (NDEP) in May 2008 for an extensive drilling and trenching exploration program to further 
delineate the resources of the PCD lens.  That action included an Environmental Assessment (EA).  
A revision to the POO was filed on November 10, 2009 and approved by the BLM in January 2010.  
Subsequent approvals from the BLM were issued under separate "work plans".  WLC submitted Work

The management of waste rock, tailings disposal facilities, water management and site monitoring 
during operations are key issues for any mine and ore processing operation located in the State of 
Nevada.  The BLM's Surface Management Regulations contained in Title 43 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (43 CFR 3809) require that mining operations authorized by the federal mining laws or 
anyone intending to develop mineral resources on public lands must prevent unnecessary or undue 
degradation of the land and reclaimed areas.  The State Mining Regulations contained in Nevada 
Administrative Code (NAC) 445A.350 through NAC 445A.447 mandate that mine and ore 
processing/fluid management system operations "will not degrade waters of the State".  These federal 
and state regulatory requirements are met by constructing and managing mine and ore processing/fluid 
management operations in accordance with approved engineering design plans and regulatory agency 
approved operating plans. 

20.3.1 Waste Rock Management 

For both the Case 1 and Case 2 Project options, waste rock from the open pit will be managed using a 
combination of two methods:  construction of a surface waste rock storage facility (WRSF) and in-pit 
backfilling.  

During operations, the WRSF will be constructed by end dumping in lifts to a stable, overall slope 
configuration of 3.0 Horizontal to 1.0 Vertical (3.0H:1.0V).  This construction method will facilitate final 
reclamation, revegetation and closure of the waste rock storage facility.  

Waste rock will also be backfilled into a portion of the open pit during mine operations.  
Mining operations will be phased to allow the in-pit backfill to be completed.  The in-pit backfill will be 
designed and constructed to maintain long term stability.  The in-pit backfilling will reduce the amount 
of total mine site surface disturbance.  

Based on the geochemical characterization results, the waste rock material associated with the project 
presents a low risk for acid rock drainage and metal leaching (ARDML).  Humidity cell tests were run for 
47 weeks (and 74 weeks for cell 9).  Results from the humidity cell tests indicate acid generation is not 
predicted for any of the waste rock material types that will be mined (SRK, 2013c; SRK, 2012d; SRK, 
2012e).  

The waste rock management program will be refined as the Project progresses.  

20.3.2 Tailings Management 

For both the Case 1 and Case 2 Project options, tailings will be dewatered in the process facility, then 
placed (dry stacked) on a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) lined surface storage facility.  The TSF 
will be constructed in lifts to a stable, overall slope of 3.0H:1.0V.  This construction method will facilitate 
final reclamation, revegetation, and closure of the TSF.  Runoff from the TSF will be collected in an HDPE 
lined pond and pumped back to the process facility for reuse.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 20-9 

The tailings management program will be refined based on the results of the ongoing process 
engineering design study and the definitive feasibility study.  

20.3.3 Site Monitoring 

Both the BLM and the NDEP BMRR will stipulate requirements for the monitoring of the mine and ore 
processing operations, including the fluid management system, to ensure that they do not contribute to 
any unnecessary or undue degradation of public lands or degrade waters of the State.  The BLM 
monitoring stipulations will be issued as part of its Record of Decision for approving the Project under its 
Surface Management Regulations contained in 43 CFR 3809.  The NDEP BMRR monitoring requirements 
will be stipulated in the Water Pollution Control Permit issued for the Project in accordance with the 
State Mining Regulations contained in NAC 445A.350 through NAC 445A.447. 

20.3.4 Water Management 

WLC has conducting detailed surface and groundwater hydrologic studies and a detailed geochemical 
characterization study for the proposed Project.  Based on "Western Lithium Corporation the Project 
Groundwater Quantity and Quality Impacts Analysis Revision 3, August 2013; prepared by Schlumberger 
Water Services USA, Inc. (August 2013), key results obtained for dewatering and water supply 
production are:  

Sustainable pumping between 280 and 350 gpm in the claystone unit is possible, although production 
yields may decline as dewatering reduces the saturated interval.  

Additional water supply pumping of 80 gpm could be obtained from the area of well WSH-3 and other 
locations east of the open pit in basalt and claystone units.  

Drawdown impacts for post-closure partial pit backfill include the following key results (Schlumberger 
2013):  

The 10 foot drawdown contour at the end of mining is less than six miles wide, and extends 
approximately one mile beyond the project area boundary.  The maximum drawdown extent is slightly 
bigger than at the end of mining.  

Maximum drawdown occurs under the partial backfill scenario at 12 years.  

95% recovery is achieved after 55 years.  

At 100 years (equilibrium), the largest drawdown is ~210 feet along the north edge of the west pit's pit 
lake.  

Water levels recover 20 feet above pre-mining levels in the partial backfill scenario.  

The maximum 10 foot drawdown contour encompasses springs SP-001, SP-002, SP-010, and SP-011 with 
SP-012 near the edge of the 10 foot drawdown contour.  SP-001 is affected directly by open pit mining 
and dewatering.  The impact to other springs is uncertain due to the potential perched nature of the 
springs.  

After equilibrium, the particle backfill scenario's 10 foot drawdown contour still encompasses spring SP-001.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 20-10 

The 10 foot drawdown contours do not reach other water users in Kings River or Quinn River Valleys, 
nor do they extend into the alluvial basins of either valley.  

According to the Schlumber report (August 2013), groundwater flow impacts include the following key 
results:  

• A pit lake forms in the west pit at an elevation of 4,920 feet.  The realistic range of pit lake 
elevations is 4,900 to 4,933 feet.  

• The pit lake formed is predicted to result in 5.5 gpm of flow through at equilibrium.  Flow 
out of the pit lake follows the general groundwater gradient towards the southeast.  The 
realistic range of flow through could be 4.7 to 7.7 gpm.  

• The largest inflow contribution to the pit lake is groundwater, estimated at 20 gpm at 
equilibrium.  The larges outflow is ET, estimated at 28 gpm.

This section summarizes the permitting and approval process for the key federal and state agencies.  
A list of federal, state and local permits and approvals is presented Table 20.1.  

20.4.1 Federal, State and Local Agency Permitting  

A multi-agency regulatory process will be completed to obtain the required federal, state and local 
agency permits and approvals necessary to construct, operate and ultimately close the Kings Valley mine 
and ore processing operations.  The Project site is located in northern Humboldt County, Nevada, 
approximately 100 km northwest of the City of Winnemucca, on federal public lands administered by 
the Winnemucca District Office of the BLM. 

20.4.1.1 BLM Permitting and Approval  

As lead agency, the Winnemucca District Office of the BLM would issue federal approval for the 
proposed Project in accordance with its Surface Management Regulations contained in 43 CFR 3809.  
The BLM will require the submittal of a PoO, prepared in accordance with 43 CFR 3809, inclusive, that 
details the proposed mine and ore processing/fluid management system operations, along with 
reclamation and closure activities.  The BLM will also require the placement of a financial guarantee 
(reclamation bond) to ensure that mine and process site reclamation is completed in accordance with 
the approved plan.  The BLM will also require the establishment of a long-term financial trust program 
to ensure that adequate funds are available to manage post-closure site activities into a pre-determined 
future period.  Note that the PoO and financial guarantee, including the long-term trust, are coordinated 
with the Reclamation Branch of the NDEP, BMRR as discussed below. 

The BLM will also coordinate the cultural resources review program with the Nevada State Historic 
Preservation Office (SHPO) that is required under Section 106 of the Federal NHPA.  BLM will also 
coordinate the government-to-government consultation process with appropriate Native American 
tribal governments in accordance with various federal laws and regulations including the American 
Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, as amended; the Native American Graves Protection and 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 20-11 

Repatriation Act of 1990; and Executive Order 13175 – Consultation and Coordination with Tribal 
Governments. 

The NDEP BMRR will be a key State of Nevada agency for the overall mine and ore processing permitting 
and approval process.  The Regulation Branch of the BMRR will issue the State of Nevada WPCP for the 
mine and ore processing/fluid management system operations in accordance with NAC 445A.350 
through NAC 445A.447.  The WPCP will stipulate requirements for the management and monitoring of 
the mine and ore processing operations, including the fluid management system, to ensure that they do 
not degrade waters of the state.  The permit will also stipulate proposed procedures for temporary, 
seasonal and permanent closure of mine and ore processing operations.  This WPCP is referred to as a 
"zero discharge permit" as it does not allow for the off-site discharge of mine water or the release/spills 
of process fluids and other pollutants from the fluid management containment system.  This WPCP is 
issued under State of Nevada statute and regulations.  It is not a "National Pollution Discharge 
Elimination System (NPDES) permit" issued under State of Nevada primacy in accordance with the 
requirements of Section 402 of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA).  

The Reclamation Branch of the BMRR will issue the State of Nevada reclamation permit for the project 
in accordance with NAC 519A, inclusive.  The reclamation permit, with the associated PoO and 
Reclamation Plan, will stipulate procedures for the reclamation and closure of the mine and ore 
processing facilities.  As mentioned above, the BLM required Mine Plan of Operations and Reclamation 
Plan (PoO) will be a joint plan submitted concurrently to both the BLM and the Reclamation Branch of 
the BMRR for review and approval under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between these two 
agencies.  The Reclamation Branch of the BMRR will review and approve the joint plan and the financial 
guarantee for reclamation activities and the long-term trust program to ensure that adequate funds are 
available to manage post-closure site activities into a pre-determined future period, and will issue the 
State of Nevada Reclamation Permit.  

Other federal, state and Humboldt County agencies will issue additional permits, approvals or 
concurrences for various mine operations and activities in accordance with applicable federal, state and 
county ordinances, guidelines, regulations and laws, as appropriate.  

Table 20.1 presents a list of the key permits or approvals, by regulatory agency, that will be required for 
the Project, based on the current mine and ore processing plans.  Additional permits and approvals will 
be identified as necessary during the completion of the definitive feasibility study process.

20.4.1.3 NEPA Environmental Documentation Process 

Because the proposed project is on public lands and requires approval from the BLM, the proposed 
Project constitutes a federal action.  The federal action will be assessed for potential environmental 
impacts as required by NEPA.  NEPA is not a permit or approval action.  NEPA is a "law of disclosure" 
which analyzes and discloses to the public the potential impacts to the environment that could result 
from the proposed action and or alternatives; assesses the level of significance for each identified 
impact; and proposes mitigation measures if needed to reduce the potential impact from the selected 
proposed action to a less than significant level.  The results of the NEPA analysis are used by the BLM as 
part of their 43 CFR 3809 decision making process.  

The NEPA analysis program for the proposed Project would take the form of an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The EA process is less stringent than the 
more comprehensive EIS process in terms of public scoping and depth of analysis.  In Nevada, the BLM 
normally requires an EIS program to analyze and assess a new mine project in accordance with NEPA.  
However, based on the size and scope of the proposed Project, the BLM could determine that an EA is 
the proper NEPA analysis.  As lead agency, the BLM will determine the appropriate NEPA program to 
assess the proposed project upon formal review of the Draft Mine PoO and the potential impacts that 
could result from the implementation of the proposed action or alternatives.  

Note that formal decisions approving mining projects located on BLM managed public lands in Nevada 
can be appealed by various organizations, including special interest groups or individuals.  These appeals 
are based on determined inadequacies in the NEPA assessments.  Under the less stringent EA process, 
the burden of proof to show that the environmental analysis was scoped and properly completed is 
placed on the BLM.  If an appeal to an EA is ultimately upheld, then the BLM and the proponent, at 
minimum, could be required to revise portions of the EA.  Depending on the appeal issue, the proponent 
could be allowed to move forward with construction and operation activities while the appeal process is 
completed.  However, if an EA appeal is upheld, the BLM could be required to re-analyze the proposed 
action under an EIS, and a legal stay of operations could be required.  This new EIS program could 
require several years and significant monies to complete, and delay the implementation of the proposed 
action.  

Under an EIS program, the burden of proof is placed on the appellant to show that BLM did not adequately 
scope and complete the EIS process; which is normally a very challenging technical and legal activity to 
complete.  An appeal to an EIS, should it be actively pursued, could simply require a re-assessment of a 
specific resource issue.  Under an EIS appeal, the proponent could be allowed to move forward with 
construction and operation activities while the appeal, and possibly a resource re-assessment, is worked 
through; although a legal stay of operations could be required.  Although an EIS is generally more time 
consuming, with a greater cost, ultimate time and cost savings could be realized if the Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI) and Decision Record (DR) for an EA is appealed.  

NEPA Cost Estimate 

The cost to complete an EA program for a new mine project in Nevada could range between US$100,000 
and US$200,000, or more.  The cost to complete an EIS program for a new mine project in Nevada could 
range between US$800,000 to US$1,000,000 or more.  Scoping and consultation meetings with the 
BLM's Winnemucca District Office would assist in determining the detailed cost estimate to complete 
the selected NEPA process.

Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada

NEPA Time Frames  

This section describes estimated time frames to complete an EA or an EIS process under NEPA.  
Note that coordination with the BLM is required to determine an approved time frame estimate for the 
completion of the selected NEPA process.  

Under 43 CFR 3809, the BLM has 30 days to review and accept a Draft Mine PoO as technically complete 
after it is submitted by WLC.  Note that BLM generally assumes these are 30 working days, not calendar 
days.  Once the BLM determines that the Draft PoO is technically complete, then the process to 
determine the appropriate NEPA action will commence.  This would include selecting the ID Team which 
is composed of the specific BLM specialists who will work on the NEPA program and representatives of 
WLC.  Experience indicates this activity could be completed within 30 working days.  

Once the ID Team is selected and the appropriate NEPA action is determined, the process of selecting 
the NEPA contractor can start.  Under an EA process, the BLM will usually allow the project proponent to 
select its own third-party NEPA contractor without going through a formal bid process.  The BLM could 
review the qualifications of the contractor, but that generally is very quick, especially if they are familiar 
with the firm.  Experience indicates that this selection process can be completed within 15 to 30 working 
days.  

Under the EA process, pre-project public scoping is not required.  Once the ID Team is in place, key EA 
issues will be discussed during a formal ID Team meeting; baseline study needs will be outlined and a 
data gap analysis will be completed of existing studies that have been completed or are ongoing; 
perhaps a draft work plan will be prepared for guidance purposes; a draft schedule will be prepared; and 
the process will be initiated.  An EA could potentially be completed in 18 months, although the time 
frame could be longer.  This 18 month period assumes that the BLM would accept the results of the 
completed and ongoing baseline studies.  Additional time could be required if BLM requires the 
completion of additional baseline studies or resource data collection.  

Under an EIS process, selection of the third-party NEPA contractor can take three months or more.  
This would include preparation of the draft and final EIS bid document/data adequacy standards; a 
standard 30 day bid preparation process; 15 to 30 days to review bids and select the contractor; and 
preparation of the formal contract and other paperwork for the EIS process. 

For an EIS, the proponent should plan on a minimum of 18 months to complete the process once it 
commences.  This would be the minimum time to complete the pre-EIS public scoping, address 
comments, prepare the work plan, complete the analysis, complete administrative draft documents and 
agency reviews, prepare the draft final document for public notice and review, address comments and 
prepare the Final EIS.  Note that an EIS process could easily require 24 months or more to complete.  

Permitting Strategy 

Suggestions for a permitting strategy to develop positive community support and streamline final 
project approval include the following: 

• Maintain regular consultation activities with the appropriate federal, state and local 
regulatory agencies.  These agencies include the Winnemucca BLM, the various NDEP 
Bureaus, the appropriate Humboldt County departments and other federal and state 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 20-17 

agencies as deemed appropriate.  These meetings will keep the regulatory agencies up to 
date on project activities and allow them to provide insight on issues as appropriate.  

• Continue to hold regular public information (town hall meetings) with local communities, 
including the City of Winnemucca, and the community of Orovada.  These meetings are 
beneficial in developing and maintaining community support by highlighting positive social 
and economic aspects of the project.  They also provide a forum for individuals to address 
concerns up front, which will allow WLC to address these issues at the earliest possible 
opportunity and avoid potential "eleventh hour delays".  

• Continue to hold regular meetings with appointed and elected local, state and federal 
officials.  These types of meetings provide WLC with the opportunity to keep key officials 
updated on Project issues, and set the stage for political assistance, if needed, at the local, 
state and national levels.  Humboldt County and the appropriate State of Nevada officials 
can be contacted on a regular basis.  Nevada's Congressional delegation, including Senators 
Harry Reid and Dean Heller, and Congressman Mark Amodei, all maintain offices in Reno, 
Nevada that are staffed on a daily basis.  

2 0 . 5  S O C I A L  O R  C O M M U N I T Y  I M P A C T S  

The construction and operation of the Kings Valley Lithium mine and ore processing operations should 
not impact local or regional social or community infrastructure.  It is expected that employees will come 
from the surrounding area which already has established social and community infrastructure including 
housing, retail and commercial facilities such as stores and restaurants; and public service infrastructure 
including schools, medical and public safety departments and fire and police/sheriff departments. 

Based on the projected mine life, the number of potential hourly and salaried positions, and the 
projected salary ranges, Project operations would have a long-term positive impact in regards to direct, 
indirect and induced local and regional economics.  Project operations are considered basic industries, 
as they would contribute dollars to the local and regional area in terms of operation purchases and 
employee hiring (direct impacts).  Additional positive economic links would result from the purchases of 
goods and services from the local service sectors including businesses such as restaurants, gas stations, 
hotels, and other retail businesses; as earnings increase in these businesses; they hire additional people 
and buy more inputs from other businesses (indirect impacts).  Both the direct and indirect impacts 
would change the flow of dollars to the local households, which would alter their consumption 
accordingly.  The effect of this change in local household consumption upon businesses in a regional 
economic area is referred to as an induced impact.  The positive change in the local and regional 
economic area works its way throughout the entire local economy (Harris and Dobra, 2009). 

An additional and positive economic benefit would be the creation of several hundred short-term 
positions for construction activities.  To the greatest extent possible, the majority of these construction 
positions would be hired from the regional labor pool, along with a to-be-determined percentage of 
outside workers who are brought in.  The construction period could last for approximately 12 months 
(estimated Project construction time frame), and would also contribute to positive direct, indirect and 
induced economic benefits to the local and regional communities (Harris and Dobra, 2009).

Reclamation and closure of the mine and ore processing operations will be completed in accordance 
with the joint BLM and BMRR approved Mine Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan, and other 
approved closure plans prepared as part of the State of Nevada WPCP that will be issued by the 
NDEP/BMRR.  These plans will be updated on a regular basis, in consultation with the BLM and the 
NDEP/BMRR, to ensure that they remain up to date in terms of the following: 

• The latest federal and state regulatory requirements for reclamation and closure as 
contained in 43 CFR 3809; NAC 519A; and NAC 445A.350 through NAC 445A.447 

• The latest and appropriate reclamation and closure technologies and procedures 

• Ensuring that the posted reclamation bond and post-closure long-term trust fund remain 
sufficient to reclaim and close the mine site, and fund post closure monitoring activities, 
respectively 

Project facilities will be reclaimed using standard reclamation techniques and procedures as summarized 
in the following list: 

• During construction activities, suitable and available growth medium material will be 
stripped from sites scheduled for surface disturbance and stockpiled for future reclamation 
activities.  

• WLC will conduct concurrent reclamation of sites no longer required for mine and ore 
processing operation activities. 

• Buildings and other structural facilities including power lines and substations will be 
dismantled and removed off site to appropriate storage or disposal facilities.  

• Process plant components will be removed off site and transported to approved storage or 
disposal facilities.  

• Concrete foundations will be broken up and buried on site, or removed off site to an 
approved disposal area. 

• The TSF runoff collection pond and the barren purge containment pond will be reclaimed 
according to the following procedures: (1) remaining solutions will be allowed to evaporate; 
(2) pond liners will be ripped to allow percolation of meteoric waters and folded in; (3) the 
ponds will be backfilled with stockpiled soil material to a sufficient elevation above the 
original ground surface; (4) the final backfilled surface will be graded to provide positive 
surface drainage and revegetated with an approved reclamation seed mix. 

• The overall 3.0H:1.0V TSF slopes will be capped with stockpiled growth medium and 
revegetated with an approved reclamation seed mix.  

• The overall 3.0H:1.0V waste rock storage facility slopes will be regraded as needed, capped 
with stockpiled growth medium and revegetated with an approved reclamation seed mix.

• The backfilled open pit will be left in its final configuration.  The final pit slopes will be 
designed for long-term stability.  The backfilled portion of the pit will be allowed to 
revegetate naturally without the use of a reclamation seed mix.  To inhibit public access, pit 
access roads will be reclaimed, and the pit will be enclosed with a rock berm or fence.  
Warning signs will be placed at suitable locations along the rock berm or fence to notify the 
public of a hazardous condition. 

• Roads not needed for long term monitoring access will be regraded and revegetated using 
an approved reclamation seed mix.  

• The surface water diversion ditches will remain in place to divert surface water flows around 
the reclaimed mine site area.  

The majority of the Draft Mine Plan of Operations and Reclamation Plan has been prepared and will be 
further refined based on the results of the ongoing process engineering design study.  This draft plan will 
include the initial reclamation bond cost estimate for the project.  

The Nevada BLM and the State of Nevada have initiated a long-term trust fund program as part of the 
federal and state permitting program to provide for the funding of site maintenance and monitoring 
activities following the completion of final reclamation and closure activities.  The financial method for 
securing and placement of the trust fund, the trust fund cost and the determined long-term duration 
varies by project.  Consultation with the BLM and the NDEP BMRR would determine the specifics of the 
long-term trust fund program.

A multi-agency permitting and approval process will be completed by WLC to construct, operate and 
close the Project in accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations.  This program will 
include the acquisition of numerous permits and approvals from various regulatory agencies.  
To streamline the time required to complete the overall permitting and approval process it is 
recommended that representatives of WLC hold regular meetings with personnel from the various 
regulatory agencies including the Winnemucca BLM, the NDEP BMRR, Humboldt County, and other 
federal, state and local agencies as appropriate to provide updates on Project activities.  
These meetings, which can be held as individual meetings or a joint meeting, will provide an open forum 
to discuss overall progress and any issues or concerns that may arise during development activities.  It is 
also recommended that WLC hold regular public information meetings in the regional area including the 
City of Winnemucca and the community of Orovada to provide regular Project updates and to continue 
developing positive public support.  Finally, WLC should maintain regular contact with local, state and 
federal elected officials.  The value in keeping elected officials updated on Project activities cannot be 
stressed enough in terms of potential assistance and support that might be needed to assist the 
agencies and WLC in completing the overall permitting and approval process for the Project.

2 1 . 1  S T A G E  I  

21.1.1 Cost Estimating Criteria 

All capital and operating costs are expressed in constant third quarter 2011 US dollars (US$). 

Capital costs were estimated with an accuracy of ±25% in line with requirements of a preliminary 
feasibility study under CIM guidelines.  Capital costs were divided into three primary categories: 

• Mine Equipment Capital 

• Process Equipment Capital 

• Tailings Facility and Water Management Capital 

Mine equipment capital was determined based upon the material movements required to meet the 
mine plans.  The basis of capital requirements for mine equipment was gathered from vendor budgetary 
quotes or from Mine and Mill Equipment Costs: An Estimator's Guide published by InfoMine USA 
(InfoMine).  All mine equipment capital cost estimates obtained are in 2011 US dollars.  

The process equipment capital estimate was compiled and calculated by Tetra Tech Wardrop 
Engineering (Tetra Tech Wardrop).  Pricing input was provided by Tetra Tech Wardrop, K-UTEC and WLC.  
The process capital estimate was prepared in accordance with the Association for Advancement of Cost 
Engineering (AACE).  All budgetary quotes for process capital items were obtained in the third quarter of 
2011.  The process capital estimate is based upon the following: 

• Budget quotations for the dry process equipment and systems including crushers, Raymond 
mills, ball mills, granulation, table feeders, dryer, coal pulverization, calciner, and cooler.  
The Tetra Tech Wardrop in-house database was used for the balance of the equipment. 

• Budgetary quotations for the wet process equipment and systems were obtained by 
K-UTEC.  

• Preliminary material take-offs for civil work were costed by Tetra Tech Wardrop.  

• Electrical, instrumentation, piping and HVAC were expressed as a percentage for process 
equipment cost. 

• Platework and structural steel was estimated using similar recent projects as benchmarks by 
Tetra Tech Wardrop. 

• Major electrical equipment costs were estimated by Tetra Tech Wardrop. 

All equipment and material costs were based on FCA (free carrier) manufacturer plant and were 
exclusive of spare parts, taxes, duties, freight and packaging.  These costs, if appropriate, were covered 
in the indirect section of the estimate. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 21-2 

Tailings facility and water management capital cost includes materials and construction for the barren 
purge containment pond, dry stack pad, surface water diversions and site access roads.  These costs 
were estimated from the designed volumes and materials required using the RS Means Heavy 
Construction Cost Data handbook and vendor estimates obtained by Tetra Tech for projects in Nevada.  

21.1.1.1 Exclusions 

The following items were excluded from the capital estimate: 

• Force Majeure 

• Taxes 

• Overtime 

• Costs Outside Battery Limits 

• Interest 

• Sunk Costs 

Technical Reference C, Capital Basis of Estimate, provides a detailed report regarding the basis of 
estimate used and associated methodology.  

21.1.2 Capital Cost Estimate 

Tetra Tech estimated the required capital expenditures for both Case 1 and Case 2 mining scenarios on a 
100% owner equity basis.  Capital costs, where applicable, include expenditures for the following items: 

• Mine mobile equipment 

• Mine development and tailings handling 

• Process site development 

• Site utilities 

• Process equipment 

• Buildings and structures 

• Process mobile equipment 

• Mine closure costs 

• Indirect costs 

• Owner's costs 

• Contingency 

Mobile equipment capital includes purchases of new equipment, replacement of existing mobile 
equipment after the end of useful life and the major rebuilds of large equipment such as excavators, 
haul trucks, dozers and the surface miner.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 21-3 

Indirect costs include contractor indirect costs, initial fills (i.e., diesel, reagents, oil, etc.), spares, 
commissioning and start-up, freight and EPCM.  

Owner's costs were provided to Tetra Tech by WLC and include planned expenses for permitting, 
insurance and WLC staffing. 

Contingency costs are comprised of a 15 percent provision for all capital expenditures except for mobile 
equipment and the K-UTEC equipment.  The K-UTEC equipment contingency was applied at 10 percent.  
Contingency for equipment was included in the budgetary quotes used in the estimate.  

Capital costs include initial capital required for project development and sustaining capital required for 
continued production.  

21.1.2.1 Case 1 Capital Estimate 

The Case 1 capital estimate results in a total Life of Mine capital cost of US$262.7 million.  Of this, 
US$237.1 million represents initial capital with the remaining US$25.6 million in sustaining capital.  
Sustaining capital consists primarily of surface mine equipment, expansions of the dry stack tailings, 
surface water management and anticipated mine closure activities.  Sustaining capital contingency was 
included in each line item rather than a separate estimate as was used for the initial capital.  Table 21.1, 
Case 1 Capital Estimate, summarizes the initial, sustaining and Life of Mine capital required.  

Table 21.1:  Case 1 Capital Estimate (US$000s) 

 
 
21.1.2.2 Case 2 Capital Estimate 

Capital requirements for Case 2 include a factored estimate based upon the Case 1 capital requirements 
for the process site development, site utilities, process equipment, buildings and structures and indirect 
costs.  Tetra Tech factored the capital estimate from Case 1 by one of three ways.  The capital cost not 
altered (i.e., fencing, reagent unloading, water systems, etc.), doubled (i.e., process equipment, 
substations, fuel storage, etc.) or factored (i.e., communications, lime storage, truckshop, etc.).

Based on Tetra Tech's experience it used a seven-tenths factor as seen in the following equation 
(Lowrie, 2002) for factored capital estimates: 

Capital Case 2 = Capital Case 1 * (Rate Case 2/Rate Case 1)0.7 

Where: 

Capital Case 2 = Factored Capital Cost at Rate Capital Case 2 

Capital Case 1 = Original Capital Cost at Case 1. 

Rate Case 1 = 2,100 tpd 

Rate Case 2 = 4,200tpd 

The Case 2 capital estimate results in a total life of mine capital cost of US$449.5 million.  Of this, 
US$247.9 million represents initial capital with the remaining US$201.6 million in sustaining capital.  
Sustaining capital consists primarily of surface mine equipment, expansions of the dry stack tailings, 
surface water management, process plant expansion and anticipated mine closure activities.  Table 21.2, 
Case 2 Capital Estimate, summarizes the initial, sustaining and Life of Mine capital required.

Total operating costs include expenditures for the mining, processing and general and administrative 
(G&A) functions.  The Case 1 operating costs average US$72.25 per tonne of ore mined or US$3,816 per 
tonne of LCE.  Pre-production operating costs have been capitalized and therefore deducted from the 
total operating costs in the year in which the costs were capitalized.  Table 21.3, Case 1 LOM Operating 
Cost Summary, details the yearly total operating costs for Case 1.  

The Case 2 operating costs average US$65.01 per tonne of ore mined or US$3,472 per tonne of LCE.  
Pre-production operating costs and operating costs associated with waste stripping in support of the 
production increase have been capitalized and therefore deducted from the total operating costs in the

Mine operating costs were derived from first principles and represent expenses incurred due to 
scheduled production volumes, derived equipment productivities and haul distances.  Operating costs 
include the following items: 

• Fuel (off-road diesel and on-road gasoline) 

• Electric power 

• Lubricants (i.e., engine oil, transmission fluid and hydraulic fluid) 

• Rubber tires 

• General repair parts and wear parts (i.e., rollers, bushings, filters, and cutting teeth) 

• Labor 

A diesel fuel price of US$3.00 per gallon was used to calculate mine operating costs.  

An electricity cost of US$0.064 per kilowatt hour (kWh) was used.  The electricity price was derived from 
quoted rate schedules applicable to the Project and includes a base electricity cost of US$0.063 per kWh 
and a demand charge of US$5.70 per kWh of demand.  WLC provided Tetra Tech with the electricity rate 
schedule as per Harney Electric Cooperative Inc. 

Lubricants, rubber tires, and general repair parts and wear parts were quoted from the InfoMine 
handbook.  

Labor rates were provided by WLC and were based on current local market non-union labor rates and 
adjusted for customary benefit packages.  For Case 1, the manpower required for operation of the mine 
is 37 hourly and 9 salaried employees during a typical year.  For Case 2, the manpower required for 
operation of the mine is 64 hourly and 14 salaried employees during a typical year.  

Process operating costs include the following major categories: 

• Dry process: 

 Anhydrite 

 Dolomite 

 Lime 

 Propane 

 Coal 

 Grinding steel 

• Wet process: 

 Soda ash 

 Sulfuric acid 

 Resin 

 Coal 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014 21-7 

• General process: 

 Process mobile equipment 

 Water 

 Electrical power 

 Manpower 

 Maintenance and miscellaneous operating expenses 

Process operating costs include: cost of reagents, utilities, supplies, maintenance parts, general wear 
items, operating labor and supervision.  Reagent costs were obtained by WLC from local and national 
suppliers.  Cost of maintenance and operating supplies were factored from total process operating 
costs.  Electrical power charges and water costs were provided by WLC.  Labor rates were provided by 
WLC and were based on current local market non-union labor rates and adjusted for customary benefit 
packages.  Major equipment rebuilds have been capitalized rather than expensed. 

Tetra Tech and WLC developed a manpower schedule for both the mine and process operations.  
Hourly and salary wages were applied to the appropriate personnel based upon the position's job 
description and number of applicable employees.  To the base rate, a payroll burden of 36% was applied 
to all wages.  The payroll burden, as provided by WLC, includes the following items: 

• Federal and tax payroll taxes, i.e., Medicare, social security and unemployment 

• Life, medical, dental, vision and accidental death and dismemberment insurance 

• 401k plan contributions 

• Paid time-off 

• Disability income 

• Paid holidays 

• Shift differentials 

• Bonuses 

For Case 1, the manpower required for operation of the process plant is 70 hourly and 6 salaried 
employees during a typical year.  For Case 2, the manpower required for operation of the process plant 
is 86 hourly and 6 salaried employees during a typical year.  

21.1.3.1 Case 1 Operating Costs 

Table 21.5, Case 1 Mine Operating Costs, summarize the annual mine operating costs for Case 1.  
The average life of mine operating cost is estimated to be US$2.11 per tonne moved or US$432 per 
tonne of LCE.  Note that mine operating costs during the pre-production period have been capitalized in 
the cash flow estimated by Tetra Tech.  

Process operating costs for Case 1 average US$61.03 per tonne of ore processed or US$3,223 per tonne 
of LCE.  Process operating costs incurred during the pre-production period include general staff training 
and site orientation.  Note that process operating costs during pre-production have been capitalized and

deducted from the total process operating cost in the year in which the cost is capitalized.  Table 21.6, 
Case 1 Process Operating Costs, summarizes the yearly process operating costs for Case 1. 

Process related unit consumptions were developed based upon heat/mass/energy balances and applied 
on an applicable per tonne product (LCE) or per tonne ore basis.  The primary unit costs are presented in

Table 21.7:  Case 1 Process Unit Costs 

 
 

An estimate of maintenance supplies was made by adding four percent to operating costs.  
Miscellaneous operating supplies (fuel, lubricants, lab supplies, etc.) were estimated by applying a one 
percent factor to operating costs. 

21.1.3.2 Case 2 Operating Costs 

Table 21.8, Case 2 Mine Operating Costs, summarize the annual mine operating costs for Case 2.  
The average life of mine operating cost is estimated to be US$1.61 per tonne moved or US$413 per 
tonne of LCE.  Note that mine operating costs during the pre-production period have been capitalized in 
the cash flow estimated by Tetra Tech.  Tetra Tech has also capitalized a portion of the mine operating 
costs in Years 1 through 3 based upon the additional waste stripping required for the expected 
production increase in Year 4.  

Case 2 process operating costs include necessary reagents, power, water, equipment, labor and 
miscellaneous operating costs associated with the processing of ore and related facilities.  
Process operating costs for Case 2 average US$55.63 per tonne of ore processed or US$2,971 per tonne 
of LCE.  Process operating costs incurred during the pre-production period include general staff training

Table 21.10:  Case 2 Process Unit Costs  

 
 
An estimate of maintenance supplies was made by adding four percent to operating costs.  
Miscellaneous operating supplies (fuel, lubricants, lab supplies, etc.) were estimated by applying a one 
percent factor to operating costs. 

21.1.4 General and Administrative 

General and Administrative expenses were estimated for the project by Tetra Tech and include salaried 
personnel required for supervision and administrative duties applicable to both the process plant and 
mine site.  These costs include general managers, human resources, accounting, environmental staff, 
safety and security, dispatch personnel and administrative assistants.  General and Administrative costs 
average US$3.03 per tonne of ore for Case 1 and US$1.64 per tonne of ore for Case 2.  Note that 
General and Administrative costs incurred during the pre-production time period have been capitalized.  
The capitalized costs have been deducted from the operating costs in the year in which the costs were 
capitalized. 

21.1.5 Risks 

Capital estimates are directly tied to the price of steel.  Fluctuations in the supply and demand of steel 
may affect the prices quoted.  

Changes caused by the ongoing hydrology studies may have an impact on capital and operating costs 
related to pit slope stability, waste dump placement and construction and other factors.  

There is currently no allowance for drilling and blasting of the waste material.  Due to the presence of 
basalt, although minor, drilling and blasting may be required for small volumes of material.  This may

this expense will most likely be minor given the small amount of basalt present within the area.

Tetra Tech performed a pre-tax and after-tax cash flow analysis using the revenues, operating costs and 
capital costs laid out for the project for both Case 1 and Case 2 mining scenarios.  All costs are stated in 
constant Q3 2011 US dollars. 

22.1.1 Principal Economic Parameters and Assumptions 

The cash flow analyses were performed using the following key parameters and assumptions: 

• Product revenues 

 Lithium carbonate -US$6,000 per tonne FOB project site 

 Potassium sulfate –US$600 per tonne FOB project site 

 Sodium sulfate - US$75 per tonne FOB project site 

• Process recoveries 

 Lithium – 87.2% 

 Potassium – 77.7% 

 Sodium – 82.7% 

• 100% Owner's Equity 

• 8% discount rate 

• 35% federal income tax rate 

• 20% of operating costs for working capital 

• Tax losses are carried forward 

• Three-year pre-production period 

• No royalties; Subsequent to the Stage I PFS analysis, the Project has incurred royalty 
obligations that were not included in the Stage I economic estimate.  The economic analysis 
of the Project has not been updated to account for these royalties. 

• Mine operation runs 350 days per year process operation runs 365 days per year at 
90% availability 

• Case 1 nominal production rate of 13,000 tpy of LCE 

• Case 2 nominal production rate of 13,000 tpy of LCE in Years 1, 2 and 3 increased to 
26,000 tpy of LCE in Year 4 through end of mine life 

• Sunk capital and equipment salvage values have not been included

22.1.2 Taxes 

Included in the cash flow analysis are applicable federal and state taxes. 

Nevada State Minerals Tax is an ad valorem property tax assessed on minerals mined or produced in 
Nevada when they are sold or removed from the state.  The tax is applied at a rate of 5% for the project 
and applies to gross proceeds minus allowable deductions.  Allowable deductions include operating 
costs, depreciation, and royalties. 

A federal income tax rate of 35% was applied to net revenue less operating costs, depreciation, 
depletion, Nevada State Minerals Tax and loss carry forward.  An approximate rate of 35% was used to 
allow for differences in tax payments due to Alternative Minimum Tax and adjustments to the corporate 
tax rate based upon revenue. 

22.1.3 Cash Flow Analysis 

22.1.3.1 Case 1 Cash Flow Analysis 

A cash flow analysis was performed for Case 1 with results showing a pre-tax project NPV of US$261.7 
million and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 21.2% over a 21-year mine life.  The post-tax cash flow 
analysis results in a project NPV of $175.0 million and an IRR of 17.6%.  Payback on a pre-tax and after-
tax basis occurs in Years 5 and 7, respectively.  Table 22.1, Case 1 Estimated Cash Flow, details the yearly 
production, costs and cash flow for Case 1.

22.1.4 Sensitivity Analysis 

Sensitivity analyses were performed for the pre-tax project NPV at an 8% discount rate.  Sensitivities were 
performed on lithium carbonate pricing, total operating costs, total capital expenditures and total process 
recovery.  Values were adjusted in 5% increments ranging from negative 15% to positive 15%. 

22.1.4.1 Case 1 Sensitivity Analysis 

Case 1 sensitivities show that the Project is most sensitive to process recovery, followed by lithium 
carbonate pricing and operating costs, and least sensitive to capital expenditures.  Figure 22.1, Case 1 
NPV Sensitivity, illustrates the various Project sensitivities in a spider graph format.

Much of the information in this section was excerpted from PAEE (URS, 2010).  The information was 
updated to reflect recent information. 

American Colloid has a group of claims in the area of the Stage II Lens (northwest of the Stage I Lens).  
Smectite clays are mined occasionally, but the area is essentially quiet most of the year.  The J.M. Huber 
Corporation owns a small number of claims along the eastern edge of the North Lens from which they 
periodically obtain small quantities of clay materials for specialty uses.  No other clay operations exist in 
the area.  Properties immediately adjacent to the mining area are all Bureau of Land Management lands.  

Uranium deposits occur a few kilometers to the west of the lithium deposits; these are currently 
exploration properties, but had limited historical production.  Northeast of the lithium deposits, the 
McDermitt mercury deposits were mined until the late 1990s.  Those deposits are inactive at this time 
and not related to the lithium resource.  A small number of historical gold exploration properties with 
possible minor production occur several kilometers to the west of the lithium deposits. 

Numerous gold deposits are either under exploration or are operating to the south and southeast of the 
caldera margins.  These deposits are not related to the lithium deposits and are too distant to have any 
direct impact on any lithium operations. 

2 3 . 2  S T A G E  I I  

Apart from the other mineralized lenses on the King's Valley Project, there are no adjacent properties 
that bear on the lithium properties and there are no nearby operating mines.  Several gold mines are in 
operation several tens of miles to the southeast and are mentioned to illustrate that mining permits are 
possible in the area.  In the past century, a large mercury mine operated to the northeast of the lithium 
properties.  To the west of the lithium properties, uranium and gold were produced from small mines in 
the past century.  Those properties are being actively explored, but there is no current production.   

The Huber Pit at the north end of the lithium mineralized trend is operated sporadically and possibly a 
few tens of tons of material are produced per year, but production generally occurs in a short period 
every two or three years.   

American Colloid has a small number of claims in the area of the Stage II Lens but those claims have not 
produced in recent times.

24.1.1 Tailings Disposal 

In order to contain the tailings generated by the processing facilities, a dry stack tailings storage facility 
(TSF) would be constructed east of the processing facilities.  The tailings will be dewatered to a moisture 
content (by dry mass) of less than 20% as they exit the processing facilities and would be conveyed and 
stacked on top of a lined pad. 

Two scenarios were evaluated for this study.  The Case 1 TSF is designed to contain 20.4 million tonnes 
of tailings at an assumed in-place dry density of 1.61 tonnes per cubic meter (see Figure 24.1)  
The Case 2 TSF is designed to contain 36.8 million tonnes of tailings at the same density (see 
Figure 24.2).  For both cases, the TSF will be constructed in a series of five cells.  Each cell is expected to 
take approximately four years to complete, for a total TSF life of 20 years.  The first four cells will be 
constructed adjacent to each other to an elevation of 1,525 m (both cases).  The fifth cell will be 
constructed as a cap over the first four cells, and will add an additional 15 m of tailings height to both 
cases, for a maximum height of 69.5 m and 79 m for the Case 1 and Case 2 TSFs, respectively.  The final 
configuration for both cases results in a crest elevation of 1540 m with 3H:1V side slopes.  An access 
road will be built around the perimeter of the TSF for maintenance access. 

In both scenarios, the facility will be fully lined and will require an underdrain system to prevent uplift 
pore pressures from accumulating in existing drainage paths beneath the TSF liner, as well as a lined 
perimeter ditch to collect contact water from seepage and/or runoff from above the TSF liner.  
Water from the underdrain system will be monitored for water quality and will report to the existing 
drainage located downstream of the TSF.  The water from the lined perimeter runoff conveyance ditch 
will collect in a lined runoff collection pond, from where it will be pumped back to the processing 
facilities for use as reclaim water. 

Engineering analyses conducted for the TSF indicate that for both Case 1 and Case 2 mine development 
plans, the tailings can be safely stored given the designs contained herein. 

The total capital cost for the Case 1 scenario, including closure costs, is estimated at US$19.3 million.  
The total capital cost for the TSF Case 2 scenario, including closure costs, is estimated at US$28.4 million. 

The TSF designs for each case are detailed in Technical Reference D.

24.1.2 Process Demonstration Facility for Lithium Extraction 

Western Lithium continued and completed an extensive process development program aimed at the 
recovery of battery grade lithium carbonate from the hectorite clay.  Due to the complexity of the 
process, Western Lithium concluded that it would be necessary to perform a continuous small pilot scale 
operation.  Owing to this decision, Western Lithium has proposed to build a demonstration plant to 
prove the process and demonstrate continuous production for the manufacture of battery grade lithium 
carbonate from the hectorite clay.  Western Lithium contracted with URS and K-UTEC Salt Technologies 
(K-UTEC) to prepare a report titled: Western Lithium Demonstration Plant Basic Engineering Report, 
dated December 2013.  

In the Stage I PFS, the development of the pilot/demonstration plant was identified as a two-phase 
approach.  Phase one involved the basic engineering concurrent with preliminary calcining test work on 
pilot scale.  This was followed with detailed engineering, procurement and erection of the pilot plant at 
a site located within K-UTEC's facilities.  Phase two is the operation of the demonstration facility.   

The demonstration plant design is modular to prove the process efficiencies and functionality of the key 
unit operations that affect project economics.  The key modules of the plant are distributed into 
calcination, leaching and crystallization.  The pilot will be run by campaign to allow for evaluation of 
each process module, optimize efficiencies and limit excessive downtime.  The selection of equipment is 
based on the PFS process design and is modified, as necessary, to fit budget and operability constraints 
without loss of "proof of concept".  The demonstration plant size is selection is based on equipment 
availability, schedule of operation and scalability to commercial equipment.  

This demonstration plant effort has started and basic engineering is complete.  The program is currently 
procuring equipment for the pilot with early construction works also underway.  Construction completion is 
scheduled for August to be immediately followed with start-up of the pilot.  The estimated capital and 
operating costs for this program are US$3,400,000 and US$2,000,000, respectively.   

24.1.3 Direct Fired Kiln Test for Calcination of Lithium Bearing Clays 

The calcination work previously performed for the project during the PFS development used indirect 
fired rotary kilns and a fluid bed calciner.  Western Lithium commissioned IBU-tec (IBU-tec, 2013) to 
perform a trial run using a direct-fired kiln.  The scope of this test was to select the optimum operating 
conditions and temperature profile for the demonstration pilot-run and to identify any problems with 
material sintering. 

The work was performed in two phases using feed materials provided by Western Lithium.  The first 
phase was a pre-testing on small laboratory scale to determine operating parameters for the 2.5 day 
semi-pilot run processing 1.5 tonne of blended feed.  The ratio of 5:2:2 (clay to dolomite to anhydrite) 
was used in all test work. 

The following criteria were set for the laboratory tests: 

• Granulation in small scale Eirich RO2 mixer, to achieve grain size between 0.5 mm to 4 mm. 

• Calcining temperature: 900°C - 1150°C 

• Residence time: 30 – 60 minutes 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014  24-5 

Quality parameters (color value, CO2, SO2, crystal water and XRD) were analyzed IBU-tec.  

The second phase involved granulation in a pilot sized Eirich mixer, model R11 and calcining in 
0.3m x 7m direct-fired KDO rotary kiln.  The granulation was performed batch-wise, with target grain 
size of 0.5mm– 4mm. 

Conclusions and observations of this trial are: 

1. Granulation performance is dependent on the linear speed, water addition and time of 
mixing.  Various parameters were adjusted in order to maintain particles sizing below 7mm. 

2. All 1.3 tonnes were processed through the kiln operating between 950°C and 1150°C at 
different retention times.  Calcined material was collected and samples delivered to K-UTEC 
for a leach analysis. 

3. No sintering was observed until temperatures reached 1150°C.  Some minor melting was 
observed along with the clinging of material to the refractory lining.  The sintering was 
minimal at such a high temperature and the majority of the calcine was acceptable.  
Very little dust was generated and collected in the collection system.  

In general, the kiln operation was successful from a physical and throughput point of view.  
Samples collected and analyzed by K-UTEC confirmed good kiln performance with 80% to 92% Li 
extracted over a temperature range of 950°C - 1150°C with a peak at 1050°C, as expected.  The results 
correspond closely to the PFS design range.

KINGS VALLEY CLAY PROJECT SUMMARY REPORT 
Prepared By Western Lithium Corporation 

May 5, 2014 

Statement 

This report contains information on the hectorite clay at Western Lithium's Kings Valley Clay (KVC) 
Project in Humboldt County, Nevada.  The KVC Project shares some of the same property as the King's 
Valley Lithium Project.  The data presented here in regard to the clay was generated in-house by 
Western Lithium Corporation (WLC) personnel and does not address nor identify any mineral resource 
disclosure classification for the clay as described under NI 43-101.  The test work included in this report 
(other than any outside reports identified) was generated by WLC's internal clay laboratory facility 
under the direction of the Manager of Clay Operations who oversees that laboratory.  

We caution that WLC has not demonstrated the economic viability of the organoclay business or the 
Fernley Facility through at least a preliminary economic assessment.  Notwithstanding this, WLC has 
made a development decision in respect of the organoclay business and the Fernley Facility that is 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report

informed by its understanding of the hectorite clay characteristics, analysis of testing and pilot plant 
work, and the engineering and development analysis that has been completed to date and is still in 
progress.  Readers should note that there are increased risks in respect of a development decision that 
is not supported by planning to the point of completion of a feasibility study.  This includes greater 
uncertainty about the relevant inputs that form the basis of a development plan, such as the size and 
scope of infrastructure required to efficiently operate the organoclay business, the assumptions 
regarding performance of the organoclay business such as the most efficient extraction methods and 
characteristics attributable to clay, estimates of capital and operating costs and sales and marketing 
processes.  WLC does not intend to undertake further analysis to address all of these matters and there 
is an increased risk associated with any business that has not completed feasibility study work, including 
with respect to the reliability of estimates and assumptions underlying the development of that 
business.  

Introduction 

WLC is the owner of a hectorite clay deposit in Northern Nevada that they are developing for both its 
contained lithium and for clay.  WLC has recently embarked on a commercial clay strategy based on the 
unique properties of the hectorite clay at its Kings Valley Property in which it would use the clay to 
become a specialty supplier of clay based drilling additives to the oil and gas industry.  The proposed 
clay development is referred to as the Kings Valley Clay (KVC) Project. 

Development is planned for both lithium and clay on that portion of the deposit referred to as Stage 1 at 
Thacker Pass.  Permitting for clay extraction encompasses approximately 110 acres, just under a mile 
northeast of Thacker Pass and State Highway 293. 

WLC is pursuing the opportunity of becoming a specialty supplier of Hectatone™ clay based drilling 
additives to the oil and gas industry.  Hectorite clay based drilling additives have been found to be 
particularly applicable for unconventional shale drilling due to their thermal and gelling properties that 
can improve performance when developing deep deposits that require horizontal drilling.  WLC also 
plans to use other clays such as bentonite for certain organoclay products.  To make a specialty drilling 
fluid referred to as organoclay, the company is designing and building an organoclay manufacturing 
plant in Fernley, Nevada.  The plant is expected to be commissioned in late summer of 2014.  
The company believes that continued growth of shale gas drilling in the USA combined with a global 
push towards developing shale gas resources will provide growth opportunities for WLC's strategy to 
build a specialty drilling additives business.
 

History of the Clay under Chevron Resources Company Ownership 

Chevron Resources was the first to recognize the clay potential on the property.  They began exploration 
for uranium in the McDermitt caldera in 1975.  In 1977 the U.S. Geological Survey alerted Chevron to the 
presence of anomalous concentrations of lithium associated with the volcaniclastic moat sediments 
within the caldera.  Drilling by Chevron confirmed the presence of high lithium values hosted by a 
massive, green claystone (smectite/hectorite) within the moat sediment section.  From 1978 through 
1987 Chevron drilled approximately 230 holes evaluating the lithium in the claystone.  It was during this 
time that Chevron recognized the potential for utilizing these same clays for drilling mud applications.  
They conducted a comprehensive viscosity testing program and undertook a market study for drilling 
fluids.  Which indicate, on review of Chevron's historical data that Chevron believed there was potential

for developing drilling mud from the claystone on site, however, Chevron eventually abandoned the 
project in 1991. 

Other clay companies became aware of the clay on site and one company, American Colloid Company, 
has mined hectorite on a small scale for over 20 years from a small pit approximately 15 miles north of 
the KVC Project in the same geologic formation and adjacent to some of WLC's mining claims. 

Geology of the Clay 

There have been several professional papers recognizing the occurrence of and addressing the 
smectite/hectorite clay and the geology within the McDermitt caldera which include: 

• Lithium in the McDermitt Caldera, Nevada and Oregon by Glanzman and McCarthy from 
the USGS, 1978. 

• Relation of Mercury, Uranium, and Lithium Deposits to the McDermitt Caldera Complex, 
Nevada-Oregon by Rytuba and Glanzman, USGS 1979. 

• Uranium, Thorium, and Mercury Distribution through the Evolution of the McDermitt 
Caldera Complex by Rytuba, Glanzman and Conrad, Basin and Range Symposium 1979. 

• Hectorite Deposits in the McDermitt Caldera of Nevada by Odem, 1992.  This paper 
describes the caldera in general and also two commercial deposits of Hectorite that were 
being mined at the time and of which he states: "Both contain large volumes of hectorite." 
(one of these deposits, American Colloid's, is still in production). 

• Hectorite, Restricted Occurrence – Diverse Applications by Fitzgerald and Kendall, Industrial 
Clays 1996.  A general discussion of hectorite.  Stresses the limited nature of hectorite 
occurrences but includes a discussion of the Disaster Peak, Nevada hectorite which is in the 
McDermitt caldera. 

The KVC Project in Humboldt County, Nevada, is located in the southern part of the McDermitt caldera 
complex, a Miocene volcanic feature that comprises a total surface area of about 18 x 25 miles.  
Volcanic activity at the McDermitt caldera complex was characterized by extrusion of rhyolites and 
followed by eruption of rhyolite and dacites.  After collapse, the central part of the caldera complex was 
the site of resurgence, and a moat-like lake formed between this resurgent dome and the caldera walls.  
The lake was the site of deposition of volcaniclastic sediments that now form a nearly continuous ring 
within the caldera.  The Kings Valley hectorite deposits are lens-shaped bodies hosted by these moat 
sedimentary rocks. 

The Kings Valley hectorite claystone deposits occur in a north-south zone that coincides with the 
western and southern part of the McDermitt caldera.  The deposit discussed in this report, the most 
southerly deposit, is referred to as the Stage 1 Lens, or the PCD lens in earlier reports.  The claystone 
deposits in the Stage 1 Lens is mostly beneath an approximately 2 to 3 metres of thick alluvial cover.  
Structural disturbance is common with large to small scale normal faulting.  Exposures of the moat 
sedimentary rocks are limited to a few drainages and isolated road cuts; therefore, the stratigraphic 
sequence in the Stage 1 Lens is primarily derived from core drilling.

Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada

The moat sedimentary section, which has a maximum drilled thickness of about 160 metres, consists of 
alternating layers of claystone and volcanic ash.  The claystone comprises more than 75% of the section.  
In many intervals, the claystone and ash are intimately intermixed.  The claystones are variably brown, 
tan, gray, bluish-gray, and black; whereas the ash is generally white or very light gray.  

Surficial oxidation persists to depths of 15 to 30 metres in the moat sedimentary rock.  
Oxidized claystone is brown, tan, or light greenish-tan and contains iron oxide, whereas the ash is white 
with some orange-brown iron oxide.  The transition from oxidized to unoxidized rock occurs over 
intervals as much as 5 metres thick. 

Western Lithium Evaluation of the Hectorite Clays 

Over 200 drill holes have been advanced in the Stage 1 Lens, primarily for the delineation of the lithium 
in the deposit and for overall geologic understanding of the moat sediment formation.  The lithium 
resource is in the claystones in the deposit.  In the oxidized zone (the upper 15-30 metres) the lithium is 
in a smectite clay, consisting primarily of hectorite.  Lithium values are highest below the oxidized zone, 
therefore below the upper hectorite clays.  The hectorite clay of interest for potential drilling mud 
applications have been identified by visual examination and physical testing.  Core from each drill hole 
has been examined and drill logs have been prepared that record rock type, color, accessory minerals, 
textures, and other features of significance.  On the basis of core examination, 14 rock types have been 
recognized.  The core has been divided into sample intervals (for physical testing and chemical analyses) 
delineated on the basis of lithology.  Of the 14 rock types, four have been identified as having the best 
potential for potential organoclay production and they are generally found within 20 metres from the 
surface in the oxidized zone.   

An internal analysis by WLC was undertaken in 2012 to assess the areas on the previously drilled lithium 
property which would have the highest potential for supplying clay for possible drilling fluids 
applications.  The existing core was re-analyzed, sampled and tested.  Testing mostly entailed viscosity 
determinations to compare with API (American Petroleum institute) standards.  Based on preliminary 
results two areas were identified that appeared to contain suitable clays near the surface.  Large test 
pits were excavated to assess the continuity and consistency of the clay lenses.  Limited additional 
drilling on 15 metre offset was also undertaken to obtain additional samples and to further assess the 
continuity of these near surface clays. 

The report concluded that:  

• The test pit (WLT-01) exposed approximately 30 m of good clay approximately 3 m thick.  
Viscosity tests indicate the clay being continuously good for the length of the pit.  This 
location was chosen as previous drilling had indicated this location showed clay close to the 
surface (within about 3 m).  See test pit cross section. 

• Eight drill holes at 15 m spacing averaging 18 m depth were drilled to further expand this 
potential clay lens.  See cross section showing drill logs and intersects where clay was 
confirmed by testing. (Viscosity values greater than 20 were considered to be usable clay for 
gelling).  The table shows the drill hole test results with values and intercepts.  Color 
indicates grades of acceptable clays. 

• The acceptable clays could be visually identified based on color, purity, texture and feel.

• In looking at the drill hole cross section the following observations can be made: 

 The good clay lenses are somewhat continuous from hole to hole and range from 0.6 to 
3 m in thickness.  

 The clays are not necessarily continuous as the distance from the test pit increases. 

• Strip ratio at the test pit is approximately 1 to 1. 

• Strip ratio in an area encompassing the larger cross section area outside the immediate test 
pit is approximately 4 to 1. 

WLC Clay Classification Types 

The claystones most suitable for potential organoclay drilling fluid consideration can be classified as 
green, tan, light gray and gray claystone and should exhibit very low amounts of ash.  The claystones will 
generally display a waxy, shiny surface and a distinct cleavage.  Ash layers could be interspersed in the 
claystone and can also be found in beds of varying sizes in the KVC Project.  

Green Claystone - The bulk of the green claystone is found within the first 30 m of the KVC Project but 
has been logged as deep as 120 m.  It is most often found in the oxidized upper section of the hole 
accompanied by minor to moderate iron staining.  Color varies from light green to medium green and 
may have a bright "pistachio" color at times. 

Tan Claystone - The majority of the tan claystone is located within the upper 30 m depth of the KVC 
Project and has been logged as deep as 207 m.  The tan claystone is a light tan color and often has 
varying degrees of light to medium tan color throughout.  It is commonly coated with a reddish iron 
stain as it is usually found in the upper oxidized region. 

Light Gray Claystone - The light gray claystone is found mostly within the first 60 m with the highest 
percentage claystone located within approximately 30 to 60 m depth.  A substantial amount is also 
located within the upper 30 m.  This clay is a light gray to light brown color.  The shades of gray and 
brown may overlap each together. 

Gray Claystone - The bulk of the gray claystone is located in the 30 to 60 m section of the KVC Project.  
This clay is a medium to dark gray to medium to dark brown color.  Random mixed layering of slightly 
different shades of gray and brown is common.  Features such as turbidity currents and soft sediment 
deformation may occasionally be noted.  

Other Testing 

Independent testing of the clay has been conducted by Miles Industrial Minerals Research consisting of: 

• Evaluation of Western Lithium Corp. Sample WLC #1, August 12, 2011.  Report of sample 
indicating it has excellent drilling fluid properties of viscosity and fluid loss control.  Also 
discusses stability when hot rolled.

• Chemical analysis and physical property evaluation of three McDermitt Caldera Hectorite 
samples, March 23, 2012.  Report indicating clay samples are predominantly hectorite and 
discussion of other elements and exchangeable cations. 

• Evaluation of WLC Hectorite by X-ray Diffraction Analysis and Cation Exchange Capacity.  
Report indicating the average hectorite concentration of the samples provided averaged 
86% and addressed other average concentrations as well, including calcite at 6%, quartz at 
4%, feldspar at 3% and dolomite at 0.7%.

25.1.1 General 

WLC holds control and ownership of the Kings Valley property mining claims and leases within the 
boundaries of the PFS study.  WLC is approved by the BLM and the NDEP BMRR to conduct mineral 
exploration activities at the Project site. 

The Stage I PFS met the scope of work as described in Section 2.1.2 to define the necessary elements for 
construction, startup and operation of the Project through closure and reclamation at a +/- 25 percent 
level of accuracy. 

WLC has a defined ore reserve that can be mined for lithium-bearing clay, and a process to recover 
compounds of Li, K and Na as marketable products. 

Case 1 cash flow analysis indicates a pre-tax project NPV of US$262 million and an IRR of 21.2 percent 
over a 21-year mine life. 

Case 2 cash flow analysis shows a pre-tax project NPV of US$552 million and an IRR of 24.4 percent over 
a mine life of 20 years. 

25.1.2 Geology 

The Project deposits occur in a north-south zone that coincides with the western and southern part of 
the McDermitt caldera moat sedimentary rock.  Lithium mineralization occurs in lithium-bearing 
claystone minerals observed in thick, apparently continuous accumulations.   

Most of the moat sedimentary rocks drilled in the Thacker Pass basin contain anomalously high lithium 
contents (> 1000 ppm).  Intervals that consist mostly of ash have a lithium content of less than 800 ppm 
whereas intervals dominated by claystone contain more lithium (>1,000 ppm).  Many intervals have a 
very high lithium content (>4,000 ppm).  Intervals with extreme lithium contents (>8,000 ppm) occur 
locally.  There is no change in lithium content across the boundary between oxidized and unoxidized 
rock; however, the highest lithium grades generally occur in the middle and lower parts of the 
sedimentary rock section. 

25.1.3 Mining 

An evaluation of the potential surface resource for the mineralized deposit was performed. 

Potentially mineable pit shapes were identified using a Lerchs-Grossman analysis performed with the 
GEMS™ Whittle pit optimization software and the Kings Valley mineral resource model. 

Separate mine plans were developed for the Case 1 and Case 2 scenarios using the same input 
parameters.  The Case 2 pit is an expanded version of Case 1.  Ultimate pit shells were designed and 
phases were generated to determine what would extract the ore in a logical sequence.  Design cutoff 
grades higher than the economic breakeven were applied in order to achieve a nominal ore grade of 
0.40 percent Li.  A fixed cutoff grade was used for Case 1 for all production years and variable cutoff 
grades were used for Case 2. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014  25-2 

Tetra Tech developed the Case 1 and Case 2 mine schedules separately.  However, WLC has the option 
to start the Project using the Case 1 mine schedule and expand to the Case 2 mine schedule at any time.  
The additional waste stripping outlined in the Case 2 mine schedule would be delayed until the decision 
to increase production is made.  At that point, the additional waste would most likely be moved with 
contractors at an additional expense.  

Waste storage facilities were designed to incorporate backfill and minimize the total pit/waste storage 
footprint. 

Overburden would be extracted with hydraulic excavators and end-dump haul trucks.  Ore would be 
mined with a Wirtgen surface miner and transported to the ore stockpiles in end-dump haul trucks. 

Production schedules for both Case 1 and Case 2 scenarios were generated for a mine life of 21 and 
20 years respectively. 

25.1.4 Process 

WLC has continued process development, including bench and pilot size programs for major unit 
operations, and verification for lithium extraction from the Kings Valley clay deposits and advanced the 
previous work reported in the PAEE (URS 2010).  The process was originally based on the USBM work in 
the McDermitt caldera reported in 1988.  

Following size reduction, the thermal ore preparation process involves calcining the ore mixed with 
anhydrite and dolomite to convert the silicates to sulfates for leaching.  Recoverable metals include 
lithium, potassium and sodium.  The calcine is leached in water recovering the sulfates to solution. 

The wet recovery process includes evaporation and crystallization stages to recover potassium and 
sodium as sulfates along with lithium as a carbonate.  The Case 1 scenario has a production target of a 
nominal 13,000 tpy LCE.  For Case 2, the first three years of production are the same as Case 1, doubling 
to a nominal 26,000 tpy LCE in Year 4.  

The overall recoveries from the WLC process are listed below:   

Lithium, 87.2%;  

Potassium, 77.7% 

Sodium, 82.7% 

Leach residue from the third leach tank would be filtered and conveyed to a dry stack tailings storage 
facility. 

25.1.5 Environmental 

WLC has all necessary federal and state permits and approvals to conduct the current mineral 
exploration activities, operation of the Kings Valley Clay Mine, and other project activities including 
groundwater monitoring, at the Project site. 

WLC has completed baseline studies for geochemistry, vegetation; wildlife (including extensive studies 
for the Greater Sage-grouse); surface and groundwater quality and quantity; wetlands and waters of the 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014  25-3 

U.S.; seep and springs; soils; cultural resources; noise; visual analysis; weather monitoring; and other 
issues specific to the Project area.  The collected baseline study data will support the overall permitting 
and approval process for the proposed Project, and the completion of the NEPA environmental 
documentation program. 

WLC has an ongoing, proactive relationship with the BLM, the NDEP BMRR and other appropriate 
federal, state and local regulatory agencies.  Required permits and approvals to put the proposed 
Project into production have been identified.  A preliminary Project schedule for the completion of the 
permitting and approval process is presented in Figure 20.1 of this report.  

25.1.6 Hydrologic 

Detailed surface and groundwater hydrologic studies have been performed by WLC to assess the 
potential impacts from the Project on existing resources and determine water management strategies.  
According to Schlumberger (2013):  

• Dewatering rates between 200 and 270 gpm in claystone is sufficient to dewater ahead of 
mining, and supply the mine with water for operations.  

• Additional water supply pumping of 80 gpm is sustainable in basalt and claystone units east 
of the project area.  

• Well yields are anticipated to decline over time as saturated screen intervals are reduced 
due to dewatering.  

• Significant drawdown, defined as 10 foot of drawdown at the end of mining, will be limited 
to an approximately one-mile radius beyond the project area.  

• No water quantity impacts to other water users are anticipated.  

• Four springs are within the 10 foot drawdown contour.  Spring SP-001 is within the 
pit boundary and will be impacted by mining operations.  Impacts to spring flow in springs 
SP-002, SP-010, and SP-011 are uncertain due to the potential perched nature of the 
springs. 

• A pit lake is predicted to form in the west pit after mining cessation and recovery to an 
elevation of 4,892 feet.  Water levels within the backfill in the southeast pit more slowly 
recover to an elevation of 4,894 feet at 100 years post-closure.  Surrounding groundwater 
levels recover at a similar rate as the backfill, reaching 95% recovery approximately 55 years 
after closure.  

• The pit lake water balances indicates that the ultimate pit will have a component of flow 
through into the surrounding bedrock.  The flow-through rate is estimated to be 5.5 gpm at 
100 years post-mining.  Groundwater flow out of the pit lake is generally verifically 
downward from the bottom of the pit and towards the southeast.  During the early filling, 
no flow through occurs as all the incoming flow fills the pit lake.  Flow through rates increase 
as equilibrium is approached, with an estimated maximum flow-through rate of 5.5 gpm.  



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014  25-4 

• The maximum drawdown extent was simulated to occur 12 years after mining ceased.  At 
this time, the cone of depression is shallower and slightly wider than immediately after 
mining (~6 miles in diameter).  The largest amount of predicted drawdown was greater than 
200 feet, occurring in the west pit's northern face near the location of groundwater 
monitoring wells PH-1 and WSH-17.  

25.1.7 Reclamation 

The Project mining operation would be amenable to industry-standard reclamation techniques and 
permit requirements. 

The partially backfilled pit would be left in the final configuration with the pit slopes designed for long-
term stability.  The waste rock storage facility would be regraded and capped with stockpiled growth 
medium and vegetated.  The tailings storage facility would also be capped with growth medium and 
vegetated. 

25.1.8 Social 

Employees for the operation could be bussed from Winnemucca, the likely source for the majority of 
manpower, eliminating the need for a mancamp at the site.  Winnemucca is a mining hub in northern 
Nevada with established infrastructure. 

25.1.9 Economic Analysis 

Cash flow analyses were performed for the Case 1 and Case 2 scenarios using capital and operating 
costs, and revenues from the mine production schedules. 

Capital costs were estimated within an overall accuracy of ±25 percent.  The majority of the mine 
equipment capital was estimated from vendor quotations and the Mine and Mill Equipment Costs:  An 
Estimator's Guide.  Process equipment capital was estimated from vendor quotations, material takeoffs 
and a percentage for electrical, instrumentation, piping and HVAC.  Tailings and water management 
capital was estimated using the RS Means Heavy Construction Cost Data Handbook and recent vendor 
estimates.  Owner's costs were provided by WLC. 

Operating cost estimates include labor, equipment operation, power, reagents, coal, water and 
maintenance parts and support. 

25.1.10 Risks 

All mining projects are sensitive to commodity prices, both consumables and products. 

Capital estimates are directly tied to the price of steel.  Fluctuations in the supply and demand may 
affect the prices quoted.  

Changes caused by the ongoing hydrology studies may have an impact on capital and operating costs 
related to pit slope stability, waste storage facility placement, construction and other factors. 



Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report  
Kings Valley Property | Humboldt County, Nevada 
 

May 2014  25-5 

There is currently no allowance for drilling and blasting of the waste material.  Due to the presence of 
basalt in the ore body, drilling and blasting may be required for small volumes of material.  Drilling and 
blasting would increase the operating costs due to the requirement of contract drilling and blasting. 

The process technology has not been commercially demonstrated.  

The Project requires the acquisition of numerous permits and approvals from various regulatory 
agencies.  Delays within this process may have an impact on costs. 

25.1.11 Opportunities 

The Project area is host to a variety of specialty clays that could be recovered and marketed.  These clays 
include bentonite and higher-value clays for cosmetics.  Processing of these clays to recover and 
produce saleable products is straightforward; however, a resource defining the amount of these clays 
has not been completed, precluding inclusion of the potential revenue from this study. 

2 5 . 2  S T A G E  I I  

25.2.1 Geological Setting 

The Kings Valley lithium deposits occur within sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary rocks in the moat 
of a resurgent caldera.  The extent and nature of the host rocks is well documented and understood.  
At the present time, five areas of significant lithium mineralization have been identified: Stage I Lens 
(PCD), Stage II Lens (South), Stage III Lens (South Central), Stage IV Lens (North Central), and Stage V 
Lens (North).  In each of these areas hectorite, a lithium-bearing clay mineral occurs in thick, apparently 
continuous accumulations.  

25.2.2 Tenure 

Based on the records provided, GSI concludes that WLC has documents that support their claim to the 
rights to the lithium mineralization and that they have documents showing that all appropriate permits 
for exploration have been obtained. 

25.2.3 Deposit Type and Mineralization 

There are no analogous deposits in operation worldwide.  The hectorite deposits at Hector, California 
have similar mineralogy, but the geological setting is significantly different.  The Kings Valley deposits 
are believed to have formed by hydrothermal alteration of layered volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  

Mineralization consists of layered beds of lithium-bearing clay-rich volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  
The beds exhibit very good geological continuity over kilometers with drill spacings on the order of 
500m.  The thickness of mineralization varies from less than a meter to more than 90m with typical 
intercepts of about 30m.  The extent of mineralization is well known.

insufficient for pre- and feasibility engineering work.  Estimated cost: US$60,000. 

2 6 . 3  D R I L L I N G  

Additional infill drilling is required for the Stage II Lens area to advance it into a detailed project 
definition and feasibility-level resource estimation.  A nominal grid of 160 m x 160 m should ensure that 
most resources are classified as indicated.  For measured resources, a drill hole spacing of 80 m x 80 m 
would be required.  Estimated cost: US$400,000 for drilling 20 holes 1,800m total and US$70,000 for 
trenching 

2 6 . 4  D E N S I T Y  D A T A B A S E  V E R I F I C A T I O N  

GSI recommends for the Stage II Lens that at least 50 additional dry density data be acquired from the 
moat sediments to better refine the in situ dry density estimate.  There should also be an additional 
10 density samples taken from alluvial material, as well as another 10 from the bedrock material, to 
improve the estimate of waste material to be moved.  The density should be determined using the wax-
coated procedure.  Estimated cost: US$60,000

Tetra Tech recommends the following for advancement of the Stage I lens: 

• A detailed hydrogeology study to determine the water regime and movement within the 
affected area should be completed.  This study should be coupled with an updated 
geotechnical analysis to determine the effect of water flow within the pit and waste dump 
upon slope stability.  Estimated cost: US$1.5 million 

• Overburden compressive strength testing of the various overburden units to determine the 
application of free digging across the mine area should be performed.  Estimated cost:  
US$10,000 

• The geological model should be updated to include the inter-bedded ash layers to support a 
more detailed mining schedule to maximize grade and minimize dilution within the mine 
plan.  Estimated cost:  US$15,000. 

GIS recommends the following for advancement of the Stage II lens: 

At the present time, there are no mineral reserves at the Stage II Lens deposit; mine optimization and 
design, including collecting and analyzing geotechnical data, would be required for future project 
advancement.  Estimated cost is US$40,000 for geotechnical studies and US$20,000 for mine 
optimization. 

2 6 . 9  M E T A L L U R G I C A L  T E S T I N G  

GIS recommends Metallurgical samples form the Stage II Lens be collected and tested against the 
process flowsheet, recoveries, and to quantify estimated process operating costs.  An assessment of the 
possible differences between the metallurgical responses of material from the Stage I Lens and the 
Stage II Lens should be made.  Estimated cost: US$360,000.

• Future drilling programs should incorporate the following protocols to ensure continued 
quality assurance and control 

• Send a small number of coarse duplicates for assay to verify results. 

• Send a small number of coarse duplicate and pulp to a secondary laboratory for assay 
analysis to verify results. 

• Add a very low grade standard (ranging between 1,500 and 2,500 ppm lithium) to the QA-
QC protocol. 

• Add a potassium standard from clay that originates from the Stage I Project area. 

• Institute the use of formal chain-of-custody documentation to accompany all samples to the 
laboratory. 

Costs to add these QA-QC protocols to the Project are included in general costs. 

GIS recommends the following for advancement of the Stage II lens: 

• Site specific standards be produced for the Kings Valley Li project from materials found in 
the project area.  These standards should cover the expected grade ranges for Li, F, Na, and 
K.   

• A routine insertion of coarse duplicates (-10 #), in addition to the standards, pulp duplicates, 
and blank samples to monitor accuracy, precision and contamination.  GSI also recommends 
that check samples be sent to a second laboratory.  

2 6 . 1 2  E N V I R O N M E N T A L  

Tetra Tech recommends the following for advancement of the Stage I lens: 

• A multi-agency permitting and approval process should be completed by WLC for 
construction, operation and closure of the Project in accordance with all applicable federal, 
state and local regulations.  This program would include the acquisition of numerous 
permits and approvals from various regulatory agencies.  Estimated cost: $US402,000

provide updates on Project activities to streamline the time required to complete the overall 
permitting and approval process.  These meetings, which can be held as individual meetings 
or a joint meeting, would provide an open forum to discuss overall progress and any issues 
or concerns that may arise during development activities.  Estimated cost: $US10,000 

• It is also recommended that WLC continue to hold regular public information meetings in 
the regional area, including the City of Winnemucca and the community of Orovada, to 
provide regular Project updates and to continue developing positive public support.  
Estimated cost: $US5,000 

• Finally, WLC should continue to maintain regular contact with local, state and federal 
elected officials.  The value in keeping elected officials updated on Project activities cannot 
be stressed enough in terms of potential assistance and support that might be needed to 
assist the agencies and WLC in completing the overall permitting and approval process for 
the Project.  Estimated cost: $US10,000
