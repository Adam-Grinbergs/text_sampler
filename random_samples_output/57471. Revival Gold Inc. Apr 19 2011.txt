1.0 SUMMARY 
 
This report is written as a Technical Report for the Mornington Property, (the 
"Property"). JBZ Capital Inc. ("JBZ Capital") has a 100% interest in the Property by 
purchasing all the shares of Strata Minerals Ltd. ("Strata").  The report is written to 
comply with standards set out in National Instrument 43-101 for the Canadian Securities 
Administration. 
 
The term phosphorite has no universally accepted definition but generally refers to a 
sedimentary rock containing abundant phosphate, generally although not exclusively, in 
the form of fluorapatite or carbonate fluorapatite.  It is the major resource mined to 
produce phosphate fertilisers for the agriculture sector.  Phosphorous also is used in 
animal feed supplements, food preservatives, anti-corrosion agents, cosmetics, 
fungicides, ceramics, water treatment and metallurgy.  There is no substitute for 
phosphate. 
 
The Mornington Property is located in northern Western Australia. The Property lies 
within the Kimberley Basin which consists of a thick series of nearly flat-lying 
sedimentary and volcanic rocks that were deposited between 1.9 and 1.6 Ga.   
 
The Mornington tenement is located in the southern part of the Kimberley Basin and 
mostly overlies Paleoproterozoic marine sediments and volcanics of the Kimberley 
Group.  In addition, there are small areas reporting outcrops of Neoproterozoic marine 
sediments in the Mt. House Group.  The oldest outcrop of the Kimberley Group on the 
tenement is the Carson Volcanics ("Pkc") which is dominated by green to black quartz 
basalts that are in places amygdaloidal.  The Carson Volcanics also include interbedded 
volcaniclastics, massive feldspathic or argillaceous quartz sandstones and laminated 
siltstones and mudstones. 
 
Conformably overlying the Carson Volcanics and outcropping widely over the tenement 
is the Wharton Sandstone ("Pkw").  This consists predominantly of white to pale purplish 
grey, coarse to medium grained, blocky to massive but well sorted quartz sandstone. 
Cross-beds are common throughout.  They indicate currents from the west and 
northwest in most of the sequence but from the northeast in the cliff forming basal beds. 
 
In the southern part of the tenement, the Wharton sandstone is conformably overlain by 
the Teronis Member of the Elgee Siltstone ("Pkt").  This consists of a grey micaceous 
siltstone along with limestones and dolomites containing algal structures.  Intruding the 
Teronis Member is a unit of the Hart Dolerite ("Pdh"), a quartz tholeitic intrusive with a 
crystallization age of about 1790Ma. 
 
The Property contains high priority phosphate anomalies in gravels and outcrop which 
indicate the presence of phosphate rich horizons within sedimentary strata at and near 
the Property.  As well, based on previous work throughout the area, there is potential for 
the discovery of diamondiferous kimberlites/lamprophyres and/or gold/precious metal 
mineralization.

Strata acquired access to the phosphate data contained in a number of large databases 
compiled from historical datasets. Approximately 82,000 samples were collected from 
around Australia with most in the north of the continent. Relevant to exploration for 
phosphate rock are the extensive gravel sample results for heavy mineral concentrates, 
including apatite and monazite which are primary phosphate minerals and the recording 
the soil phosphate content. A high abundance of these minerals and soil phosphate 
geochemically characterizes rocks that could host potentially viable phosphate deposits. 
Processing and interpretation of the data identified samples that contained greater than 
50% observed soil phosphate mineralization. The results showed that a correlation 
exists between known deposits of phosphate rock and the frequency and distribution of 
the derived high value samples. Four areas that are prospective for phosphate were 
identified, including the Mornington tenement, which from historic data is the best known 
heavy mineral Phosphate anomaly in Australia.  The Mornington Property contains 10 
samples with anomalous observed phosphate mineralisation from historic samples. 
 
More recently, Strata acquired: Shuttle Radar Topography Model data ("SRTM"); 
Airborne radiometric data; high resolution Landsat 741 imagery; airborne geophysical 
data including both magnetics and gravity.  The imagery and airborne geophysical data 
all aid in the understanding of the regional and local stratigraphy and help target 
phosphorus enriched strata and identify possibly uranium anomalies.     
 
Two Directors of Strata, Mr. Gellard and Mr. Swatton, visited the Mornington Property in 
late 2009.  The main purpose of the visit was to investigate outcrop adjacent to those 
drainages where a greater abundance of detrital phosphate minerals was historically 
reported and to determine if intervals of shallow marine sedimentation were present.  
During the visit, interbedded shallow marine silts and sands were readily identified 
within tenement.  Geological investigations were completed by doing helicopter and foot 
traverses across the tenement.  Samples were collected from Pentecost and Wharton 
sandstone units respectively.  Twenty-two rock-chip samples were collected from a few 
meters of outcrop within the Mornington tenement.  The samples were submitted to 
Ultra Trace in Perth for analysis.  Assays of the sandstones reported typical phosphorus 
values ranging from 50 to 150 parts per million ("ppm"), but the interbedded siltstones 
are generally enriched with phosphorus to 850 ppm (or P2O5 @ 0.2wt%).  At the 
Mornington Property nine samples contain higher than 200 ppm P (MO 005 – 500 ppm; 
MO 006 – 350 ppm; MO 011 – 500 ppm; MO 012 – 850 ppm; MO 013 – 450 ppm; MO 
015 – 450 ppm; MO 016 – 350 ppm; MO 020 – 350 ppm; MO 021 – 250 ppm 
respectively). 
 
Mr. D. Besserer, visited the Property on the 14-15 of September 2010.  The main 
purpose of the visit was to investigate outcrop adjacent to those drainages where a 
greater abundance of detrital phosphate minerals was historically reported and to 
determine if intervals of shallow marine sedimentation were present.  During the visit, 
interbedded shallow marine silts and sands were readily identified in outcrop within the 
tenement. Geological investigations were completed by doing helicopter and foot 
traverses across the tenement.  Samples were collected from Pentecost and Wharton 



3 
 

sandstone units respectively.  Samples were collected from Pentecost and Wharton 
sandstone units respectively.  In total, 4 composite rock grab samples were collected 
from a few meters of outcrop on the Mornington tenement.  The samples were 
submitted to a Genalysis in Perth for analysis.  Assays reported typical phosphorus 
values of less than 150 ppm, but a sampled collected from a sandstone with oxidized 
beds was enriched with phosphorus to 221 ppm.   
 
Strata Minerals (now JBZ Capital Inc.) has incurred exploration expenditures on the 
Mornington tenement in excess of $110,000 during the period from the granting of the 
tenement on December 11, 2009 to February 22, 2011.  Such expenditures do not 
include general and administrative costs, property maintenance payments or taxes. 
 
Based on: the favourable geological setting at the Property with respect to phosphorus, 
diamond, base metal and uranium potential; highly anomalous phosphate abundances 
in gravel samples, and; anomalous phosphorus in rock, further exploration is warranted 
which should include but not be limited to:  
 
PHASE 1: Office based data compilation; Confirmatory gravel sampling to test historic 
results; Sedimentologists/Geologists conducting systematic mapping throughout the 
Property; Systematic channel sampling of strata to test for specific beds being 
'auriferous' with respect to phosphorus; bore sampling (if applicable); Systematic 
sampling of stratigraphy using a small heli-portable diamond drill rig and, depending on 
the results of the Phase 1 program, PHASE 2: follow-up drill testing (core) in areas 
where anomalous phosphorus exists to better understand stratigraphy and mineralizing 
controls on anomalous or auriferous beds.  PHASE 2 is contingent on positive results 
from Phase 1. 
 
The total cost to complete the Phase 1 exploration is $500,000(Cnd.).

APEX Geoscience Ltd. ("APEX") was retained in 2010 as consultants to complete an 
independent technical report on behalf of JBZ Capital, specific to the Mornington 
Property.  Mr. Dean Besserer, B.Sc., P.Geol., a principal of APEX and qualified person 
has conducted a property visit during the 14th and 15th of September 2010.  The main 
purpose of the visit was to investigate outcrop adjacent to those drainages where a 
greater abundance of detrital phosphate minerals was historically reported and to 
determine if intervals of shallow marine sedimentation were present.  During the visit, 
interbedded shallow marine silts and sands were readily identified in outcrop within the 
tenement and sampled. Geological investigations were completed by doing helicopter 
and foot traverses across the tenement. 
 
The supporting documents which were used as background information are referenced

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The Mornington Project is comprised of tenement E 80/4172 which covers a total area 
of approximately 347km2.  JBZ Capital holds a 100% interest in tenement E 80/4172.  
The tenement is located in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia and lies within 
the Lansdowne 1:250,000 scale geological.  It is situated approximately 150km north-
northeast of Fitzroy Crossing (Figures 1 and 2).  Tenement E 80/4172 is not subject to 
any native title claim. 
 
A search of the Registrar of Aboriginal Sites maintained by DIA on February 15, 2010 
reveals that no sites have been registered within the E 80/4172 tenement and that 
aboriginal surveys have been recorded over the land subject that is the subject of 
tenement E 80/4172.  It is possible that there are unregistered sites and objects within 
the areas that are the subject of the tenements.  
 
The tenement was originally recorded in the name of Gellard Enterprises Pty Ltd. which, 
by agreement dated September 10, 2009, agreed to transfer a 100% interest in the 
tenement to Strata Minerals Limited.  In consideration for the acquisition, the Company 
agreed to pay Gellard Enterprises $114,600 which has been satisfied by the issue of 
5,730,000 shares of the Company.  Mr. Nigel Gellard, owns 100% of the shares in 
Gellard Enterprises.  Title to the E80/4172 tenement was transferred to Strata Minerals 
Limited on February 4, 2011.  Table 1 lists the Property Status for the Mornington 
Property and the tenement is shown on Figures 1 and 2.  Unless otherwise stated, all 
coordinates are presented in the Universal Transverse Mercator ("UTM") projection 
Geocentric Datum of Australia ("GDA") 1994, Map Grid of Australia (MGA) Zone 51 or 
the World Geodetic System ("WGS") 1984.

Exploration Licence shall be accompanied by a statement specifying method of 
exploration, details of the proposed work programme, estimated cost of exploration and 
technical and financial ability of the applicant(s).  An exploration licence is not marked 
by physical staking.  The minimum size of an exploration licence is one block, and the 
maximum size is seventy blocks, except in areas not designated as mineralised areas, 
where the maximum size is 200 blocks.  On June 28, 1991 a graticular boundary (or 
block) system was introduced for exploration licences. The term of an exploration 
licence is 5 years. In the final year the Minister may extend the term for an initial period 
of 5 years, then further periods of 2 years.  An Extension of Term application shall be 
made in accordance with Section 61 of the Mining Act (1978) and Regulation 23A of the 
Mining Regulations (1981).  At the end of both the third and fourth year of its term, the 
licensee is required to surrender 50% of the licence.  For a licence applied for and 
granted after February 10, 2006, the surrender requirement is 40% at the end of the fifth 
year. The holder of an exploration licence is authorised to carry out exploratory 
operations, of a kind set out in the Western Australia Mining Act and the exploration 
licence, within the licence are in respect to any minerals (except iron ore, unless 
expressly authorised by the minister).  The holder of an exploration licence may in 
accordance with the licence conditions, extract or disturb up to 1000 tonnes of material 
from the ground, including overburden, and the Minister may approve extraction of 
larger tonnages. 
 
The Property is considered to be a grass roots stage exploration property.  There are no 
old workings within the Property.  The Property has not been legally surveyed.  The 
author is not aware of any environmental liabilities which exist with respect to the 
properties, nor is he qualified to comment on such. 
 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

5.1 Accessibility, Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The Mornington Exploration Property is located in northern Western Australia.  The 
Great Northern Highway provides the only sealed access to the south and eastern 
portions of the area.  Major tourist routes along the Gibb River and Windjana Gorge 
Roads provide additional access to the interior of the Kimberley area (Figure 2).  
Ground access within the area is mainly restricted to graded roads (shire maintained) 
and tracks (developed by stations or previous exploration companies) which are 
generally impassable during the monsoonal wet season.  Scattered airstrips can be 
found throughout the region and are accessible by light planes.  Due to the limited local 
access, helicopter utilization is necessary for more extensive access.   
 
Surface access to the Mornington Property is via helicopter from Kununurra or Derby or 
by four wheel drive vehicle via unsealed roads from the Great Northern Highway at 
either Fitzroy Crossing or Halls Creek to Tableland Station homestead, then via a 30 km 



9 
 

stretch of the Mornington track westwards from the station towards the Gibb River 
Road.  The tenement is situated 1.5 km north of the track. Alternatively a track runs 
24km north from Tableland Station to Woods' Bore that approaches within 3 km of the 
eastern boundary of the tenement (Figure 2). 
 
Towns in the area are mainly located around the perimeter of the Kimberley region and 
include Derby (300km), Kununurra (260km), Fitzroy Crossing (170km) and Wyndham 
(265km).  In the northern part of the region two aboriginal communities are present: the 
Kalumburu and Oombulgurri Aboriginal Communities (Figure 2).  
 
Kununurra is located in the northeastern part of the Kimberleys along the Great 
Northern Highway near the Cambridge Gulf.  The town has an airport with scheduled 
service to Perth, Broome and Darwin offered by Air North Regional and Skywest.  Food, 
accommodation and supplies are available in Kununurra. 
 
In the southwest Kimberleys Derby is a service town that offers all the amenities.  The 
Derby airport has scheduled service from Perth offered by Strategic Airlines and Virgin 
Blue.  Food, accommodation and supplies are available in Derby (Figures 1 and 2). 
 

5.2 Climate 
 
The climate over the Kimberley area varies from semi-arid monsoonal in the south to 
monsoonal in the north with distinct wet and dry seasons throughout.  The field season 
is restricted to the dry season (April to November).  Vegetation is of the tropical 
savannah type including grassy woodland areas and open forests.  Day temperatures 
are high year round with the highest temperatures recorded between October-
November (average 38°C) and the coldest months being from June-August (average  
25°C).  Average rainfall throughout the area is ~700 mm of which ~90% falls between 
November and March; July to Sept are commonly rainless (Ruddock, 2003; Hassan, 
2004). 
 

5.3 Physiography 
 
Physiographically the Kimberley area is quite diverse but a close correlation between 
bedrock and topography has been pervasively noted.  The area is dominated by the 
Kimberley Plateau which has an average altitude of 500m, sloping gradually from 600m 
in the south to 200m in the north.  The plateau consists of flat structural peneplains. 
Fairly good drainage is provided by incised river valleys which become steep and 
narrow canyons near the coast.  The plateau is surrounded by escarpments to the east 
and southwest which give way to the East and West Kimberleys (Thom, 1975).  
 
The North Kimberley region is part of the Kimberley Plateau; more specifically it forms 
part of the Karunjie Plateau and lies at elevations between 100m and 200m.  The 
physiography is essentially that of an irregular dissected plateau that dips gently 



10 
 

seawards.  Erosion and weathering of siltstone and volcanics, interbedded with resistant 
sandstone, has produced numerous escarpments, cuestas and isolated mesas (Gellatly 
and Sofoulis, 1969).  In the East Kimberley region the physiography is extremely varied.  
In the western part of the mobile zone the Durack Ranges and the Kimberley foothills 
bordering the Kimberley Plateau have a rugged topography of north-northwest trending 
hogbacks and cuestas of resistant sandstone that rise 200-300 m above narrow valleys. 
In the central part of the mobile zone the Bow River Hills are of relatively low relief and 
are developed on granitic rocks of the Lamboo Complex (Thorne et al., 1999; Gellatly 
and Derrick, 1967).  Within the Mornington tenement the elevation ranges from 400m to 
about 600m.  
 
In the North Kimberleys the typical vegetation is grassy eucalyptus woodlands and open 
forests.  Cypress pine occurs in sandstone areas.  Pandanus and paperbarks fringe the 
watercourses.  Dense thickets of mangroves line tidal and river estuaries (Gellatly and 
Sofoulis, 1969).  In the area of the Mornington tenement the vegetation consists 
predominantly of a savannah-type association of stunted eucalyptus and spinifex, with 
patches of grass, especially on basic rock.  Large eucalyptus and locally baobabs fringe 
the watercourses (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967). 

6.0 HISTORY 
 

6.1 Mornington Property 
 
Initial exploration in the area was completed in the late 1960's for uranium by CRA 
Exploration, Minops Pty Ltd. and Western Nuclear (Australia) Pty.  An airborne 
radiometrics survey was completed by CRA Exploration and Minops Pty Ltd., over a 
large area including the entire Mornington tenement along with reconnaissance 
sampling and diamond drilling south of the Property (Kostlin, 1970; Figure 3).  Western 
Nuclear (Australia) Pty. conducted detailed geological mapping covering the eastern 
part of the Mornington Tenement and to the east of the tenement over outcropping 
radioactive conglomerate.  Drilling was completed southeast of the Mornington 
tenement and intersected only slightly anomalous radioactive zones (Western Nuclear, 
1969). 
 
The majority of the exploration in the area focussed on diamond exploration beginning 
in the 1970's.  Diamond exploration throughout the region included stream and loam 
sampling along with ground and airborne geophysical surveys.  Exploration was 
focused mainly east and west of the Mornington tenement.  Approximately 30 km to the 
east with Magnet Metals Group and CRA Exploration (on behalf of the Ashton Joint 
Venture ("JV")) were involved in the exploration.  Sampling resulted in the recovery of 
numerous kimberlite indicator minerals including chromite and picroilmenite and one 
macro diamond.  A non-diamondiferous ferruginized and altered lamproite breccia was 
discovered and in 1997 a small kimberlitic dyke was discovered (Buckley, 1984; 
Clarke and Fielding 1986; Haebig, 1986; Clifford, 1998; Finlay, 1999).  Approximately

40 km to the west of the Mornington tenement regional exploration was carried out by 
Stockdale with Seltrust Mining Corporation Pty (the Sullivan Joint Venture) in 1984-85 
(Figure 3).  Exploration included 164 stream samples, heli-magnetic surveys and bulk 
sampling and included the recovery 19 diamonds (including a 0.92 carat diamond) and 
six pyropic garnet (Beckett, 1986).  Subsequently, in 1985, Freeport Australia Inc. 
(later Poseidon Limited) and Triad Minerals NL (later Diamin Resources NL) 
completed stream and loam sampling from which KIMs and one diamond were 
recovered.  Follow-up ground magnetics, costeaning and bulk sampling led to the 
discovery of the Aries kimberlites in 1987 (Fazakerley, 1987; Frewer, 1988). 
Additionally, diamondiferous alluvial gravel beds were discovered along Harris and 
Nyairgul Creeks (Manning and Marx, 1989).  In 2001-2002 Ragged Range Mining Pty, 
Thundelarra Exploration Ltd., and BHP Gravity Capital discovered four additional 
kimberlites (Persephone, Athena, Helena and Niobe) in the Aries area all of which are 
diamondiferous.   
 
In 1986, Stockdale Prospecting Ltd. completed regional stream sampling surveys in the 
area, including covering a large portion of the Mornington tenement.  Very few 
indicators were recovered, and those recovered were of low interest (Harrsion, 1986). 
Subsequently, in 1994 and 1995 Stockdale completed an airborne magnetic survey and 
additional heavy mineral sampling in the area over the Mornington tenement, but these 
surveys failed to locate any evidence for diamondiferous kimberlites in the area (Smith, 
1995; Figure 3). 

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 
The Kimberley block consists of the Kimberley craton surrounded by off-craton 
Proterozoic mobile belts (Figure 4; Janse, 1992) and a thick series of nearly flat-lying 
sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Kimberley Group that were deposited between 
1.9 and 1.6Ga (Thom, 1975).  These rocks form the Kimberley Plateau.  They are 
underlain by a basement of crystalline igneous rocks of the Lamboo Complex: starting 
with the Halls Creek Group of sediments which are intruded by basic and ultrabasic 
rocks and granites (Janse, 1992).  These rocks are not exposed at the surface of the 
plateau.  Recent investigations have indicated that the basement is of Archean age, (i.e. 
>2.5 Ga) (Graham et al., 1999).  Around 2.2-2.0Ga the complex was intensely deformed 
and metamorphosed with the latest thermal events occurring ~ 1850Ma with granite 
intrusions and associated volcanic rocks.  These are correlated with the Barramundi 
Orogeny between 1880 and 1850Ma which cratonized the basement of the Halls Creek 
Mobile zone.  The craton has remained tectonically stable since Proterozoic apart from 
regional uplift (Thom, 1975). 
 
On the northeast, the craton margin is a faulted basin margin and on the northwest 
probably a major crustal downwarp.  To the southeast, the Archean craton is bounded 
by the Halls Creek Mobile Zone (East Kimberleys).  The Halls Creek Mobile Zone is a

north-northeast trending zone approximately 400 kilometres long and 100 kilometres 
wide.  It is bound by two long regional transcurrent faults: the Greenvale on the west 
and the Halls Creek fault on the east (Janse, 1992).  Additionally, numerous 
anastamosing northeast trending left lateral faults and secondary northeast-trending 
folds and reverse faults transect the belt (Plumb and Veevers, 1971).  The zone is 
composed of early Proterozoic sediments, metamorphics and granites.  The oldest 
rocks exposed in the Halls Creek belt are the Halls Creek Group, part of the Lamboo 
Complex (~2.5Ga; Page, 1976).  The northern part of the zone is covered by the 
Paleozoic sediments of the Bonaparte Basin (Jaques et al., 1986). 
 
To the southwest the Kimberley Craton is bounded by the King Leopold Mobile Zone, 
the Lennard Shelf and the Fitzroy Trough (West Kimberleys).  The King Leopold Mobile 
Zone forms a mountainous belt that is abutted to the north by steeply folded and thrust 
faulted Middle Proterozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the lower part of the  
Kimberley succession.  The crystalline basement of the zone is the Hooper Complex 
which is correlated with the Lamboo complex. Vertical fault movements are 
characteristic of this zone (Janse, 1992).  The Lennard Shelf presumably overlies the 
southern extension of the King Leopold Mobile Zone and is formed by flat lying 
Devonian limestones overlain by sparse remnants of a once extensive Permian 
sandstone formation.  The Fitzroy Trough is a faulted graben filled with up to 8km of 
Paleozoic sediments topped by Devonian limestones.  The King Leopold and Halls 
Creek mobile zones have experienced a long continuity of tectonic and depositional 
activity (Thom, 1975). 
 
The Kimberley Craton has experienced widespread Tertiary to Quaternary laterization.  
A variety of Quaternary soils, sands, muds and alluvium sporadically cover the area 
(Figure 4). 
 

8.0 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 

8.1 Mornington Property 
 

The Mornington tenement is located in the southern part of the Kimberley Basin and 
mostly overlies Paleoproterozoic marine sediments and volcanics of the Kimberley 
Group.  In addition, there are small areas reporting outcrops of Neoproterozoic marine 
sediments in the Mt. House Group.  The oldest outcrop of the Kimberley Group on the 
tenement is the Carson Volcanics ("Pkc") which is dominated by green to black quartz 
basalts that are in places amygdaloidal.  The Carson Volcanics also include interbedded 
volcaniclastics, massive feldspathic or argillaceous quartz sandstones and laminated 
siltstones and mudstones. 
 
Conformably overlying the Carson Volcanics and outcropping widely over the tenement 
is the Wharton Sandstone ("Pkw").  This consists predominantly of white to pale purplish 
grey, coarse to medium grained, blocky to massive but well sorted quartz sandstone. 



15 
 

Cross-beds are common throughout (Plate 1).  They indicate currents from the west and 
northwest in most of the sequence but from the northeast in the cliff forming basal beds. 
 
In the southern part of the tenement, the Wharton sandstone is conformably overlain by 
the Teronis Member of the Elgee Siltstone ("Pkt").  This consists of a grey micaceous 
siltstone along with limestones and dolomites containing algal structures.  Intruding the 
Teronis Member is a unit of the Hart Dolerite ("Pdh"), a quartz tholeitic intrusive with a 
crystallization age of about 1790Ma. 
 
Unconformably overlying the Kimberley Group sediments in the far west of the 
tenement are small areas of the Neoproterozoic-age, Walsh Tillite ("Phw") and Traine 
Formation ("Pha") of the Mt. House Group.  The Walsh Tillite includes dolomites and 
quartz sandstones, while the Traine Formation outcrops as a purplish brown siltstone.  
The only other unit mapped within the tenement are areas of soil cover ("Czs") (Figure 
4).

Structurally, sediments of the Kimberley Group are gently folded into a series of broad 
and shallow basins and domes.  Fold trends typically parallel major fault trends and are 
approximately northeast and northwest as for most of the Kimberley Region.  The 
Mornington tenement covers the south-easterly extension of a broad antiformal 
structure extending from the Phillips Range some 30km to the northwest. 
 

9.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The term phosphorite has no universally accepted definition but generally refers to a 
sedimentary rock containing abundant phosphate, generally although not exclusively, in 
the form of fluorapatite or carbonate fluorapatite.  The distinction between phosphorite 
and phosphatic sediment based on phosphate content is highly debated and may 
inherently be related to each individual deposit (Notholt and Sheldon, 1986).  It is the 
major resource mined to produce phosphate fertilisers for the agriculture sector. 
Phosphorous also is used in animal feed supplements, food preservatives, anti-
corrosion agents, cosmetics, fungicides, ceramics, water treatment and metallurgy. 
There is no substitute for phosphate. 

Australia's commercial resources of phosphate are in northwest Queensland at 
Phosphate Hill, 140 km south east of Mount Isa.  The Phosphate Hill Mine is a world-
class rock phosphate resource which is close to the surface and easy to access and 
mine.  The rock is ideal for the manufacture of high analysis mono-ammonium 
phosphate ("MAP") and di-ammonium phosphate ("DAP") fertilisers for domestic and 
international use. 

DAP and MAP have different ratios of phosphorous ("P") and nitrogen ("N"), and have 
slightly different applications.  Both products are generally produced as granules with a 
diameter of between 2-4 mm.  DAP (20% P and 18% N) is used on broad-acre crops 
such as cereal, legume, fodder, horticultural and row crops as well as for dairy and 
newly-established pastures.  MAP (22% P and 10% N) assists with early crop growth 
and enhances phosphorous uptake in broad-acre crops. 

The bulk of Australia's inferred phosphate resources are in phosphorites in the Georgina 
Basin.  These resources are distributed between Queensland and the Northern 
Territory. 

Throughout geological time the deposition of phosphate has been shown to be episodic  
with major episodes in the Late Proterozoic to Early Cambrian, late Cretaceous to early 
Paleogene, the Miocene and possibly in the mid-Ordovician, late Permian and Jurassic 
(Cook, 1992) .  A less important phosphogenic episode is thought to occur in the Early 
Proterozoic (Notholt and Sheldon, 1986).  Relevant to the tenement area are 
Proterozoic and Cambrian phosphorite deposits.  Several hundred phosphorite deposits 
and occurrences of Proterozoic and Cambrian age have been documented worldwide 
(Cook and Shergold, 1986; Notholt et al., 1989; Notholt and Sheldon, 1986).  
 



17 
 

Igneous intrusive alkali rocks, particularly carbonatite complexes, and associated 
contact metamorphic rocks, provide phosphate, usually as fluorapatite (Bartels & Gurr, 
1994). Phosphate rocks of sedimentary origin typically have 30–35% P2O5 whereas 
those of igneous origin contain marginally higher P2O5, typically 35–40% (Schorr & Lin, 
1997). 
 
Phosphorite beds consist of grains, pellets or fragments of cryptocrystalline apatite 
(collophane) and are typically a few centimetres to tens of metres thick (McHaffie & 
Buckley 1995). These deposits typically show extensive reworking, secondary 
enrichment and replacement. Shallow oceanic areas and continental shelves commonly 
have thick accumulations of phosphorus-rich organic debris, mainly derived from deep 
oceanic sources associated with upwelling currents of cold, nutrient-rich water. 
Sedimentary deposition of phosphate has occurred throughout much of the Earth's 
history and continues today (Bartels & Gurr 1994).  
 
The Phosphate Hill deposit is the only commercial phosphate rock mine in Australia. 
 
Accumulations of bird and mammal excrement have also provided important sources of 
phosphate rock (McHaffie & Buckley 1995).  Guano deposits on small oceanic islands, 
for example, Nauru and Christmas Island, were once major sources of phosphate but 
are now declining in importance or have ceased production. At these localities, bird 
excrement has formed thick accumulations of calcium phosphate, or guano, due to 
reaction of the organic waste with underlying limestone rocks. 
 
Phosphate deposition in the Proterozoic and Cambrian was dominantly located in 
miogeosynclinal zones along the margins of proto-Gondwana and along the edges of 
intraplatformal basins (Baturin, 1981; Cook, 1992).  Globally, phosphate deposits share 
striking similarities. Many sequences are characterized by associated shallow-water 
carbonates, particularly dolomites, overlain by or in places interfingered with 
phosphorites, then black shales suggesting that formation occurred though similar 
processes of phosphogenesis and in similar environments.  Additionally, many 
phosphorites are underlain by tillic sequences.  The deposition of phosphorites is 
interpreted to be the result of a major change in the phosphate content of the oceans at 
the time.  It has been suggested that this is related to the prior development of oceanic 
anoxia, the storage of phosphate in the deep ocean reservoir and then the recirculation 
of that phosphate into the shallow-water photic zone (Cook, 1992).  This resulted in the 
deposition of thick accumulations of sediments including phosphorites, carbonates, 
cherts and organic-rich shales on the continental margins (Baturin, 1981; Cook, 1992). 
Alternatively it has been proposed that the extrusion of phosphorus rich basalts, 
containing up to 2% P2O5, may have provided a considerable amount of the excess 
phosphate.  Proterozoic and Cambrian phosphorite deposits are commonly folded, 
faulted and metamorphosed by later tectonic activity.  The most common Cambrian 
deposits are pelletal phosphorites, whereas Proterozoic phosphorites are characterized 
by mudstone phosphorite and stromatolitic phosphorite (Notholt and Sheldon, 1986).  A 
large proportion of the known resources of Proterozoic-Cambrian phosphorite are 



18 
 

characterised by a high carbonate (dolomite) content, the presence of which in other 
than moderate amounts, has deleterious effects on the processing of phosphorite.  
 
Many Proterozoic phosphate deposits occur in association with strata-bound deposits of 
uranium, lead, silver, zinc, manganese, iron, and gold.  The close association between 
the two groups of deposits may indicate that the sedimentological controls on 
phosphogenesis are similar to those of strata bound metallogenesis.  Further studies of 
these controls have been recommended and can be expected to improve exploration 
techniques with respect to these deposits (Notholt and Sheldon, 1986). 
 
To understand the significance of kimberlitic indicator minerals ("KIMs"), it is important 
to understand the type of igneous rocks from which primary diamond deposits are 
mined.  The most common rock type from which diamonds are mined are kimberlites 
and, to a lesser extent, lamproites and orangeites.  KIMs describe minerals that are 
common constituents of these three rock types, some of which are phenocrysts and 
others that are xenocrysts.  For the purposes of this discussion, KIMs will refer to 
minerals that are both characteristic and diagnostic of kimberlites. 
 
Kimberlite is best described as a hybrid igneous rock (Mitchell, 1986, 1989, 1991; 
Skinner, 1989; Scott Smith, 1995).  Kimberlites are igneous in nature since they have 
crystallized from a molten liquid (kimberlitic magma) originating from the earth's upper 
mantle.  Kimberlite magma contains volatile gases and is relatively buoyant with respect 
to the upper mantle.  As a result, pockets of kimberlitic magma will begin to ascend 
upward through the upper mantle and along a path of least resistance to the earth's 
surface.  As the kimberlitic magma ascends, the volatile gases within the magma 
expand, fracturing the overlying rock, continually creating and expanding its own conduit 
to the earth's surface.  As a kimberlitic magma begins to ascend to the earth's surface it 
rips up and incorporates fragments or xenoliths of the various rock types the magma 
passes through on its way to surface.  As the magma breaks down and incorporates 
these xenoliths, the chemistry and mineralogy of the original magma becomes altered 
or hybridized.  The amount and type of foreign rock types a kimberlite 
may assimilate during its ascent will determine what types of minerals are present in the 
kimberlite when it erupts at surface. 

 
When kimberlitic magma reaches or erupts at the earth's surface, the resulting volcanic 
event is typically violent, creating a broad shallow crater surrounded by a ring of 
kimberlitic volcanic ash and debris ("tuffaceous kimberlite").  The geological feature 
created by the eruption of a kimberlite is referred to as a diatreme or kimberlite pipe 
(Mitchell, 1986, 1989, 1991).  In a simplified cross section a kimberlite diatreme appears 
as a near vertical, roughly "carrot shaped" body of solidified kimberlite magma capped 
by a broad shallow crater on surface that is both ringed and filled with tuffaceous 
kimberlite and country rock fragments (Mitchell, 1986, 1989, 1991). 

 
Diamonds do not crystallize from a kimberlitic magma, they crystallize within a variety of 
diamond-bearing igneous rocks in the upper mantle called peridotites and eclogites.  
Peridotites and eclogites are each made up of a diagnostic assemblage of minerals that 



19 
 

crystallize under specific pressure and temperature conditions similar to those 
conditions necessary to form and preserve diamonds ("diamond stability field"). 
Diamond bearing peridotite can be further broken down into three varieties that are, in 
order of greatest diamond bearing significance, garnet harzburgite, chromite 
harzburgite, and, to a lesser extent, garnet lherzolite.  For a kimberlite to be diamond 
bearing, the primary kimberlitic magma must disaggregate and incorporate some 
amount of diamond bearing peridotite or eclogite during its ascent to the earth's surface.  
The type and amount of diamond bearing peridotite or eclogite the kimberlitic magma 
incorporates during its ascent will determine the diamond content or grade of that 
specific kimberlite as well as the size and quality of diamonds.  Diamond bearing 
peridotite and eclogite occur as discontinuous pods and horizons in the upper mantle, 
typically underlying the thickest, most stable regions of Archean continental crust or 
cratons (Helmstaedt, 1993).  As a result, almost all of the economic diamond bearing-
kimberlites worldwide occur in the middle of stable Archean cratons. 

 
Diamond indicator minerals ("DIMs") include minerals that have crystallized directly from 
a kimberlitic magma (phenocrysts), or mantle derived minerals (xenocrysts) that have 
been incorporated into the kimberlitic magma as it ascends to the earth's surface. 
Examples of DIMs are picroilmenite, titanium and magnesium rich chromite, chrome 
diopside, magnesium rich olivine, pyrope garnet and eclogite garnet.  Varieties of garnet 
include G1, G2, G9, G10, G11, G12 pyropes as defined by Dawson and Stephens 
(1975), G9 and G10 pyropes as defined by Gurney (1984) and Gurney and Moore 
(1993) and G3, G4, G5, and G6 eclogitic garnets as defined by Dawson and Stephens 
(1975).  From this paragraph on, reference to G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G11 and G12 
pyrope garnets refers to Dawson and Stephens' (1975) classification and G9 and G10 
refers to Gurney's (1984) G9 and G10 pyrope garnets of lherzolitic and harzburgitic 
origin, respectively. 
 
DIMs are used not only to assess the presence of kimberlites in regional exploration 
programs but also to assess whether the kimberlites have the potential to contain 
diamonds.  There are a limited variety of DIMs from which information pertaining to the 
diamond bearing potential of the host kimberlite can be gained.  Typically, these are 
DIMs that have been derived from diamond bearing peridotite and eclogite in the upper 
mantle (Mitchell, 1989).  The most common examples of these would include sub-calcic, 
G10 Chrome (Cr) pyrope garnets (harzburgitic), G9 pyrope garnets (lherzolitic), Chrome 
(Cr)- and Magnesium (Mg)-rich chromite (diamond inclusion field or "DIF" chromite from 
chromite or spinel harzburgite), diamond inclusion field "DIF" eclogitic garnets and 
chemically distinct jadeitic clinopyroxene (diagnostic of diamond bearing eclogites). 

 
Other indicator minerals that have crystallised from a kimberlitic magma can provide 
information as to how well the diamonds in a given kimberlite have been preserved 
during their ascent to surface.  For instance, the presence of low iron and high 
magnesium picroilmenites in a kimberlite is a positive indication that the oxidation 
conditions of a kimberlitic magma were favourable for the preservation of diamonds 
during their ascent to surface in the kimberlitic magma. 

 



20 
 

Due to the unique geometry of a kimberlite pipe and the manner in which the kimberlite 
has intruded a pre-existing host rock type, there are often differences in the physical 
characteristics of a kimberlite and the host rock.  Often these contrasting physical 
characteristics are significant enough to be detected by airborne or ground geophysical 
surveys.  Two of the most commonly used geophysical techniques are airborne or 
ground magnetic surveys and electromagnetic (EM) surveys.  A magnetic survey 
measures the magnetic susceptibility and EM surveys measure the electrical 
conductivity (or resistivity) of the material at or near the earth's surface.  When magnetic 
or resistivity measurements are collected at regular spaced intervals along parallel lines, 
the data can be plotted on a map and individual values can be compared.  If a 
geophysical survey is conducted over an area where the bedrock and overburden 
geology is constant and there are no prominent structures or faults, there will be little 
variation in magnetic or resistivity response.  However, when a kimberlite intrudes a 
homogenous geologic unit and erupts on surface, there is often a detectable change in 
the geophysical signature or anomalous magnetic or resistivity response over the 
kimberlite diatreme.  When the data is contoured the anomalous results often occur as 
circular or oval anomalies outlining the surface or near surface expression of the 
diatreme. 
 
The effectiveness of geophysical methods in kimberlite exploration is dependent on the 
assumption that the difference between the geophysical signature of the hosting rock 
unit and a potential kimberlite is significant enough to be recognized by the geophysical 
techniques available.  There are many examples of economic kimberlites that produce 
very subtle, unrecognizable geophysical responses as well as non kimberlite geologic 
features and man-made structures (referred to as "cultural interference") such as oil 
wells, fences, bridges, buildings which can produce kimberlite like anomalies.  For these 
reasons, it is extremely important that other information, such as DIM surveys, be used 
in conjunction with geophysical evidence to confirm whether there is other information to 
support the presence of a kimberlite diatreme (Fipke et al., 1995). 
 
Gold hosted within silicate, oxide and sulphide iron formations is also a deposit type of 
interest.  However, gold may also be hosted and associated with quartz veins or be 
present throughout the properties in anomalous concentrations in nearly all lithologies in 
shear zone settings.  As well, past exploration for copper, zinc and other base and 
precious metals has indicated that there is also potential for these types of mineral 
deposits within the region. 

Sandstone uranium deposits occur in medium to coarse-grained sandstones deposited 
in a continental fluvial or marginal marine sedimentary environment. Impermeable 
shale/mudstone units are interbedded in the sedimentary sequence and often occur 
immediately above and below the mineralised sandstone. Uranium is precipitated under 
reducing conditions caused by a variety of reducing agents within the sandstone 
including: carbonaceous material (detrital plant debris, amorphous humate, marine 
algae), sulphides (pyrite, H2S), hydrocarbons (petroleum), and interbedded basic 
volcanics with abundant ferro-magnesian minerals (example: chlorite). 

Three main types of sandstone deposits: 



21 
 

• rollfront deposits - arcuate bodies of mineralisation that crosscut sandstone 
bedding; 

• tabular deposits - irregular, elongate lenticular bodies parallel to the depositional 
trend, deposits commonly occur in palaeochannels incised into underlying 
basement rocks; 

• tectonic/lithologic deposits - occur in sandstones adjacent to a permeable fault 
zone. 

Sandstone deposits represent only about 7% of Australia's total resources of uranium 
(Geology of Uranium Deposits, World Nuclear Association 2010). 

10.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
From the compiled 82,000 gravel samples, only 149 samples returned maximum 
abundance scores with respect to phosphate over the whole of Australia.  A total of 42 
samples are located within the Mornington tenement, three of which returned maximum 
abundance scores (i.e. the highest observed phosphate mineralisation).  Additionally, 
seven samples with slightly lower scores are also contained within the project area.  
The dominant geology underlying both project areas is Proterozoic marine sediments 
with anomalous phosphate and the potential to host auriferous phosphate rich strata. 
 
Diamondiferous kimberlite dykes and pipes exist northwest of the Mornington Property. 

11.0 EXPLORATION 
 
In July 2008, Gellard Enterprises Pty Ltd. entered into an exclusive agreement with a 
geological consultancy for access to the phosphate data contained in a number of large 
databases.  The databases have been compiled over the last 20 years and comprise a 
unique multi-element dataset that has been used to identify exploitable resources in a 
number of other commodities.  Phosphate deposits have not been a primary target in 
more recent exploration due to the historically low price of phosphate.  Instead 
exploration was focused on major commodities such as gold, base metals, diamonds, 
uranium and iron ore.  The recent increase in the importance of phosphate rock and the 
corresponding increase in phosphate rock prices, has led to a fresh interrogation of the 
existing dataset.  Relevant to exploration for phosphate rock are the extensive gravel 
sample results for heavy mineral concentrates, including apatite and monazite which 
are primary phosphate minerals.  Approximately 82,000 samples were collected from 
around Australia with most in the north of the continent. 
 
The samples were processed and observed for a range of diamond indicator minerals 
as well as a broad range of detrital minerals that may be indicative of other types of 
mineralisation.  Included in this process was the observation of minerals with high 
phosphate concentrations (e.g. apatite and monazite) and the recording of the 
phosphate content of the soil.  A high abundance of these minerals and soil phosphate 



22 
 

content geochemically characterizes rocks that could host potentially viable phosphate 
deposits. 
 
The samples were numerically coded for mineral abundance.  That data was merged 
with other information, including location, mapsheet, geological unit and topography. 
The combined data was mapped using a modern Geographic Information System 
("GIS") to illustrate the distribution of mineral abundances for the entire 82,000 samples. 
Processing of the data identified samples that contained greater than 50% observed soil 
phosphate mineralization.  A correlation was observed between known deposits of 
phosphate rock and the frequency and distribution of high value samples.  The 
interpretation of the datasets has identified four main areas of anomalous phosphate, 
including the Mornington Property. 
 
Out of the 82,000 gravel samples only 149 samples returned maximum abundance 
scores over the whole of Australia.  The Mornington Property contains a total of 42 
samples, three of which returned maximum abundance scores (i.e. the highest 
observed phosphate mineralisation).  In addition seven samples with slightly lower 
scores are also contained within the project area.  The underlying geology is dominantly 
Proterozoic marine sediments with anomalous phosphate and the potential to host 
auriferous phosphate rich strata (Figures 5 and 6).  Of the areas that are prospective for 
phosphate, the Mornington tenement contains the best known heavy mineral Phosphate 
anomaly in Australia.   
 
Two Directors of Strata Minerals, Mr. Gellard and Mr. Swatton, visited the Mornington 
Property in late 2009.  The main purpose of the visit was to investigate outcrop adjacent 
to those drainages where a greater abundance of detrital phosphate minerals was 
historically reported and to determine if intervals of shallow marine sedimentation were 
present.  During the visit, interbedded shallow marine silts and sands were readily 
identified in outcrop on the tenement.  In addition, 22 rock-chip samples were

collected from a few meters of outcrop on the Mornington tenement.  The samples were 
submitted to Ultra Trace in Perth for analysis.  Assays of the sandstones reported 
typical phosphorus values ranging from 50 to 150 parts per million ("ppm"), but the 
interbedded siltstones are generally enriched with phosphorus to 850ppm (or P2O5 @ 
0.2wt%).  At the Mornington Property nine samples contain higher than 200 ppm P (MO 
005 – 500 ppm; MO 006 – 350 ppm; MO 011 – 500 ppm; MO 012 – 850 ppm; MO 013 – 
450 ppm; MO 015 – 450 ppm; MO 016 – 350 ppm; MO 020 – 350 ppm; MO 021 – 250 
ppm respectively).   All the results are included in Appendix 1.   
 
Mr. D. Besserer, visited the Mornington Property on 14-15 of September 2010. The 
main purpose of the visit was to investigate outcrop adjacent to those drainages where 
a greater abundance of detrital phosphate minerals was historically reported and to 
determine if intervals of shallow marine sedimentation were present.  During the visit, 
interbedded shallow marine silts and sands were readily identified in outcrop within the 
tenement. Geological investigations were completed by doing helicopter and foot 
traverses across the tenement.  Samples were collected from Pentecost and Wharton 
sandstone units respectively.  In total, 4 composite rock grab samples were collected 
from a few meters of outcrop on the Mornington tenement.  The samples were 
submitted to a Genalysis in Perth for analysis.  Assays reported typical phosphorus 
values of less than 150 ppm, but a sample collected from a sandstone with oxidized 
beds was enriched with phosphorus to 221 ppm.  Table 2 summarizes the results and 
they are shown on figures 5 and 6.

*Table shows all APEX sample results but summarizes Strata results.  Complete results for all samples 
are in Appendix 1. 
 
Strata Minerals (now JBZ Capital Inc.) has incurred exploration expenditures on the 
Mornington tenement in excess of $Cdn110,000 during the period from the granting of 
the tenement on December 11, 2009 to February 22, 2011.  Such expenditures do not 
include general and administrative costs, property maintenance payments or taxes. 
 
In 2011, Strata acquired data from Fugro Airborne Surveys Pty. Ltd. ("Fugro") which 
includes: Shuttle Radar Topography Model data("SRTM"; Figure 7; ); Airborne 



26 
 

radiometric data (Figures 8 and 9); high resolution Landsat 741 imagery (Image 
Acquired May 7, 2000; Figure 10); airborne geophysical data including both magnetics 
and gravity (Figures 11 and 12) relating to the Mornington tenement and surrounding 
area.  The imagery and airborne geophysical data all add to Strata's geoscientific 
database for the Mornington tenement and in particular aid in the understanding of the 
regional and local stratigraphy and help target phosphorus enriched strata and identify 
possible uranium anomalies.  The specifications for the data/imagery acquired from 
Fugro are in Appendix 2. 
 

 
 
 
Figure 7.  SRTM dataset with a northwest sunshade, at the Mornington Tenement. 
 
SRTM imagery assists both structural and geomorphic mapping, such as the 
identification of faults and landforms. Modelling of erosional and depositional 
environments can be completed using SRTM data by combining factors such as slope 
with known geological or geomorphic controls.  SRTM data can also be used to verify 
the accuracy of drainage networks or establish their geometry in the absence of a 



27 
 

hydrological survey. SRTM imagery is also often compared to other datasets (especially 
Landsat), to provide correlation to erosionally weaker/stronger rock units. 
The SRTM data in Figure 7 clearly defines several major structures and lithological 
features in the area, such as folding, faulting, and the distribution of alluvial deposits at 
and near the Mornington Tenement.

Potassium (K): Thorium (Th): Uranium (U) = (Red: Green: Blue or "RGB"). Ratio grids 
often enhance the evidence of subtle changes between two gamma-ray responses that 
occur due to variations in the mineral chemistry of the host rock that may not be evident 
in single images. Ternary and other ratio grids also serve to reduce variations in count 
rates due to effects such as variable soil moisture content and distance from source. 
The variations of colour in the resulting RGB images can be correlated with known 
geology to infer the mappable extent of surface lithological units.

Figure 10.  Landsat 741 image at the Mornington Tenement.  
 
Landsat imagery assists in determining the structural and lithological controls in areas of 
outcrop. Where lithological units outcrop, their Landsat characteristics are used to aid in 
the interpretation of their lithologies. Geological unit classification is based on both the 
texture and reflectance characteristics of the data. The following geological information 
can be interpreted from Landsat data: bedding and foliation trends; fold traces; shear 
zones, faults, fractures, and lineaments; lithological units, rocks types and surficial 
cover.   Figure 10 includes regional geological interpretation based on using the 
Landsat 741 in conjunction with the SRTM.

Tenement.    
 
The first vertical derivative ("1VD") filter enhances high-frequency variations of the 
magnetic field, it is particularly useful for structural mapping through the definition of 
near-surface litho-magnetic boundaries and texture. Cosmetically, the 1VD appears to 
produce a sharper image of Total Magnetic Intensity ("TMI") or the Reduced To Pole 
("RTP") total magnetic intensity data, in which boundaries are much better defined. 
 
The 1VD data presented here clearly displays a series of northwest-southeast trending 
dykes crosscutting the basement lithologies. Faults and granitic intrusions are also 
visible in Figure 11.

12.0 DRILLING 
 
The author is not aware of any drilling having been completed at the Property. 
 

13.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Mr. Besserer collected composite rock grab samples to test for phosphorus 
mineralization over a large area and should be considered representative.  Samples 
were collected using a hammer and were fresh, unaltered rock and were considered to 
be of acceptable quality.  Samples were described and placed in calico bags with 
sample identifiers labelled on both sides.   Sample bags were then sealed with a tie 



32 
 

strap.  Rock samples were generally 1-4kg.   Mr. Besserer had no sample bias when 
sampling intervals of shallow marine sedimentation.   
 
Similarly, Strata collected rock grab samples to test for phosphorus mineralization within 
specific stratigraphy and should be considered representative.  Samples were collected 
using a hammer and were fresh, unaltered rock and were considered to be of 
acceptable quality.  Samples were described and placed in calico bags with sample 
identifiers labelled on both sides.   Sample bags were then sealed with a tie strap.  Rock 
samples were generally 1-4kg.   Strata personnel had no sample bias when sampling 
intervals of shallow marine sedimentation.   
 

14.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
The rock samples collected by both Strata and APEX were taken as checked baggage 
from Kununurra to Perth and hand delivered to Ultra Trace (2009 samples) and 
Genalysis (2010 samples), respectively; no additional security measures (numbered 
security tags, etc.) were taken.  Once the samples were delivered to the lab they 
remained in the custody of the independent laboratory until final analyses were 
completed.  No aspect of the sample preparation was conducted by an employee, 
officer, director or associate of the Issuer/Vendor.   
 
At Ultra Trace the 2009 samples were sorted and dried. The whole sample was crushed 
and subsequently pulverised in a vibrating disc pulveriser. The samples were analysed 
by Firing a 40 gram (approximate) portion of the sample. This is the classical fire assay 
process and will give total separation of Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt) and Palladium (Pd) in 
the sample. Au, Pt, Pd were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Optical 
Emission Spectrometry (OES). 
 
The samples were pre-oxidised to prevent the loss of Sulphur and digested with a 
mixture of acids including Hydrofluoric, Nitric, Hydrochloric and Perchloric Acids. The 
mineral Cassiterite is not efficiently attacked with this digest. If Barium occurs as the 
Sulphate mineral, then at high levels (more than 4000 ppm) it may re-precipitate after 
the digestion resulting in erroneously low results. The elements Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Mn, P, 
Sc, V, Al, Ca, Na, S were determined by ICP-OES. The elements As, Ag, Ba, Be, Bi, 
Cd, Ga, Li, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr, W, Ta, Y, Hf, Zr, Nb, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, 
Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Th, U, Se, Rb, In, Te, Cs, Re, Ti were determined by Inductively 
Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectrometry (MS). 
 
The samples were fused with sodium peroxide and subsequently the melt was 
dissolved in dilute Hydrochloric acid for analysis.  Due to the high furnace temperatures, 
volatile elements were lost. This procedure is particularly efficient for determination of 
major element composition (including silica content) of the samples or for the 
determination of refractory mineral species. The elements B, Cr, Si, Fe, Mg, Ti, K were 
determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma ("ICP") Optical Emission Spectrometry, 
where as the element Ge was determined by ICP-MS. 



33 
 

 
At Genalysis the 2010 samples were sorted and dried. The whole sample was crushed 
and subsequently pulverised to at least 85% sample is pulverized to 85% passing 
through a 75 micron sieve.  Gold (Au), Pd and Pt was analysed using fire assay (FA) 
and ICP-MS of a 50-gram aliquot. The representative 50 gram aliquot is mixed with a 
litharge flux and fused forming a lead button and molten slag. The fire assay flux 
mixture has been carefully formulated to optimise precious metal recovery in diverse 
mineralogical matrices. Samples submitted for the ppb determination of gold, platinum 
or palladium are fused in new pots using dedicated equipment. The slag is removed and 
the lead button containing the precious metals is cupelled, resulting in a precious metal 
bead. The bead is subsequently dissolved and the solution is analyzed by ICP-MS for 
Au, Pt and Pd. The detection limits for Au, Pt and Pd are 1 ppb. 
 
Additionally the samples were processed by four acid digestion followed by ICP-MS and 
ICP-OES analysis to determine 44 elements and 16 elements, respectively. Four acid 
digestions, with the inclusion of hydrofluoric acid targeting silicates, decompose almost 
all mineral species and are referred to as "near-total digestion". The ICP spectrometer 
measures the relevant elements which are detected by their characteristic mass or 
wavelength specific light. The detection limits for the various elements range from 0.02-
50 ppm.   
 
Genalysis is accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities Australia 
("NATA") and operates in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025.  Ultra Trace is accredited by 
NATA and is a member of ISO MN-002-2 Chemical Analysis Committee and is AQIS 
Registered. Both laboratories provide standard quality assurance and quality control 
("QA/QC") procedures (to a standard of ISO1702) with respect to all samples that were 
sent for analysis.  They routinely analyze and report results for duplicates, analytical 
blanks and a variety of standard samples on the order of about 1 for every 4 or 5 
samples.  Due to the small amount of samples neither Strata nor APEX inserted 
analytical standards or blanks, however, at least one sample from each sample batch 
was analyzed in duplicate.  The accuracy and precision for the both laboratories with 
respect to sample preparation, security and analytical procedures were found to be 
acceptable by normal industry standards and practices.   

15.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Specific to this report, Mr. D. Besserer collected all the 2010 rock samples.  To the best 
of the author's ability the samples were kept under APEX's control prior to being 
delivered to the laboratory.  Therefore, the author believes this data to be of acceptable 
quality. 
APEX did not insert duplicates into each sample batch as part of a QA/QC program.  
The samples collected by APEX at the Property and historic work at the Property 
confirm the presence of anomalous concentrations of phosphate within the Property.  
The author has independently verified the data referred to in this report and there were 
no limitations with respect to data verification other than the lack of access to the 



34 
 

historic sample rejects.  Geology maps created by others were available and used while 
in the field.  Sample sites and geology shown on maps were confirmed by the author 
using hand held GPS while in the field.   
Ultra Trace and Genalysis performed standard quality assurance/quality control 
(QA/QC) procedures with respect to the rock samples that were sent for analysis.  The 
laboratories routinely analyze analytical blank and standard samples.  The data for all of 
these standard analyses were found to be within acceptable limits.   
Various precautionary steps are taken with the fire assay process. Fusion crucibles are 
carefully checked to ensure that no boil overs have occurred in the furnace.  A boil over 
is treated with a re-analysis of the spoilt sample but also neighbouring samples in the 
furnace.  Visual checks are given to the fusion mixture to make sure that there has been 
a clean fusion with no lead "shotting".  If the size of the lead button is determined to be 
too small or large, the fusion process is then repeated. After the cupellation process, the 
precious metal bead is assessed for size, color, and surface texture.  These features 
alert personnel to the presence of precious metals causing them to be dealt with in even 
higher security methods to avoid any possible contamination. 
 
Various precautions are taken during the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass 
Spectrometry and Optical Emission Spectroscopy processes.  Analysts review all of the 
data that is generated from every analysis taking note of various patterns. Samples with 
high concentrations of iron and aluminum can give significant inter-element 
interferences. In this case the elements thallium, tungsten, and uranium are monitored 
because these are the elements most affected by these inter-element interferences. 
Concentrations of elements in these situations are verified by the examination of each 
spectra in detail. 
 
Genalysis regularly participates in international, national and internal proficiency testing 
programs and client specific proficiency programs that complement NATA ISO/IEC 
17025 accreditation ensuring international standards are maintained in the laboratories' 
procedures, methodology, validation, QA/QC and data handling. Certified Reference 
Materials and/or in house controls, blanks, splits and replicates are analysed with each 
batch of samples. These quality control results are reported along with the sample 
values in the final report. Selected samples are also re-analysed to confirm anomalous 
results.  

16.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
There are no properties adjacent to the Mornington tenement. To the northwest, 
Panorama Diamonds holds an interest in a prospecting licence over the Aries kimberlite 
cluster (www.thundelarra.com) which is approximately 50km NW of the Mornington 
tenement (Figure 4).  
 
 
Premier Base Metals Ltd. holds several tenements south of the Mornington tenement to 
explore for copper, base metals and platinum group elements ("PGE's"; 

http://www.thundelarra.com/�


35 
 

www.premierbasemetals.com.au) which are approximately 60 km south of the 
Mornington Tenements.   
 
The author did visit the Aries Kimberlite in September 2008 however has otherwise 
been unable to verify the information presented in the 'Adjacent Properties' section and 
the information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Property that is 
the subject of the technical report.   
  
 
17.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
The author has no knowledge of any Mineral Processing or Metallurgical testing having 
been completed with respect to the Property. 
 

18.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
There are no resources or reserves at the Property as defined by NI 43-101. 
 

19.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
 
Demand for phosphate has been increasing due to an increasing global demand for 
phosphatic fertiliser to assist in increasing food production requirements and biofuel 
crops, a tightening of phosphate rock supplies from the Middle East and North Africa 
and competing uses in fertilisers and animal feed supplements. The interaction of these 
and other demand drivers have resulted in material volatility in the price of phosphate 
rock, which for many years prior to 2005 sold at a relatively consistent price, seldom 
increasing above US$40/Mt. However, in 2005 and 2005 the price increased materially 
above the previous historical long term level. The Development Prospects Group of the 
World Bank has reported in its Community Markets Review the following annual prices 
of phosphate rock, based on full calendar years: US$44.2/Mt (2006), US$70.9/Mt 
(20070; US$345.6Mt (2008) and US$121.7/Mt (2009).  Currently the price is above the 
pre-2006 levels. 
 

20.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The initial field visits conducted by the author and Strata confirm the presence of 
anomalous phosphorus in outcrop, and hence the presence of anomalous phosphate 
minerals in historic gravel samples and therefore met the objective of validating the 
project going forward.    

http://www.premierbasemetals.com.au)/�


36 
 

During the initial field visits, interbedded shallow marine silts and sands were readily 
identified in outcrop within the tenement. Geological investigations were completed by 
doing helicopter and foot traverses across the tenement.  Samples were collected from 
Pentecost and Wharton sandstone units respectively. 
 
Assays of the sandstones collected by Strata reported typical phosphorus values 
ranging from 50 to 150 parts per million ("ppm"), but the interbedded siltstones are 
generally enriched with phosphorus to 850ppm (or P2O5 @ 0.2wt%).  At the Mornington 
Property nine samples contain higher than 200 ppm P (MO 005 – 500 ppm; MO 006 – 
350 ppm; MO 011 – 500 ppm; MO 012 – 850 ppm; MO 013 – 450 ppm; MO 015 – 450 
ppm; MO 016 – 350 ppm; MO 020 – 350 ppm; MO 021 – 250 ppm respectively).    
 
Assays of the sandstones collected by APEX and/or the author reported typical 
phosphorus values of less than 150 ppm, but a sample collected from a sandstone with 
oxidized beds was enriched with phosphorus to 221 ppm.   
 
The author has independently verified the data referred to in this report and there were 
no limitations with respect to data verification and other than the lack of access to the 
historic sample rejects.  Analyses were acceptable and analytical methods were normal 
with respect to current industry practice(s).   
 
The sample density is sparse, however, anomalous samples from both recent and 
historic exploration indicate the presence of phosphorus and thus more detailed work is 
required to discover higher concentrations of phosphorus mineralization within the 
Mornington tenement.  The author can therefore conclude that the Mornington Property 
is high priority for follow-up exploration with respect to phosphate rock exploration.    
 
As well, based on favourable geological setting at the Property there is diamond, base 
metal and uranium potential. 

21.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Based on: the favourable geological setting of the properties with respect to 
phosphorus, diamond, base metal and uranium potential; anomalous phosphate 
abundances in gravel samples, and; anomalous phosphorus in rock, further exploration 
is warranted which should include but not be limited to:  
 
PHASE 1: Office based data compilation; Confirmatory gravel sampling to test historic 
results; Sedimentologists/Geologists conducting systematic mapping throughout the 
Property; Systematic channel sampling of strata to test for specific beds being 
'auriferous' with respect to phosphorus; bore sampling (if applicable); Systematic 
sampling of stratigraphy using a small heli-portable diamond drill rig and, depending on 
the results of the Phase 1 program, PHASE 2: follow-up drill testing (core) in areas 
where anomalous phosphorus exists to better understand stratigraphy and mineralizing 
controls on anomalous or auriferous beds.  PHASE 2 is contingent on positive results 
from Phase 1.

MAGNETIC / RADIOMETRIC 

 

MAGNETIC DATA (MAG): 

 

2010 Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) Anomaly Grid of Australia 
 

The mag map is a composite TMI grid of the Australian region with a grid cell spacing of ~3 

seconds of arc (approximately 80 m).  This grid only includes airborne-derived TMI data for 

onshore and near-offshore continental areas. 

 

Data used to compile this grid form the basis for the concurrent release of a new fifth edition of 

the Magnetic Anomaly Map of Australia. This edition is underpinned by the concept of a 

database of matched TMI grids, from which any map at any resolution can be extracted. 

 

RADIOMETRIC DATA (RAD): 

 

The Radiometric Map of Australia dataset comprises grids of potassium (K), uranium (U) and 

thorium (Th) element concentrations, and derivatives of these grids, that were derived by 

seamlessly merging over 550 airborne gamma-ray spectrometric surveys in the national 

radioelement database using the method described by Minty et. al. (2009).  

 

Cell sizes:  The cell sizes of the original survey grids range from 50 m through 800 m, but 

most have a cell size of about 100 m. The original survey grids were levelled and then re-

sampled, using minimum curvature (Briggs, 1974), onto the Radiometric Map of Australia 

Grids with a cell size of about 100m (0.001 degrees).  

 

Projections and Datums:  The grids are stored as geodetic grids based on the GDA94 datum.

GRAVITY 

 

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GRAVITY DATABASE 

0.5 MINUTE ONSHORE GRAVITY GRID, June 2009 

 

The 2009 gravity grid over Continental Australia is derived from onshore observations 

recorded at approximately 1.4 million gravity stations held in the Australian National Gravity 

Database (ANGD) by Geoscience Australia (GA).  The onshore data were acquired by the 

Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, the mining and exploration industry, 

universities and research organisations from the 1950s to the present day.   

 

Basic station spacing  = 11 km  

 

Recent Federal, State and Territory Government initiatives have funded systematic infill at a 

grid station spacing of 2, 2.5 or 4 kilometres to provide improved coverage in areas of 

scientific or economic interest.  Other areas of detailed coverage have been surveyed by 

private companies for exploration purposes. 

 

Over the continental region only open file data as held in the ANGD at May 2009 were used 

in the creation of the grid. 

 

The data values contained in the grid are Spherical Cap Bouguer gravity anomalies over 

Continental Australia.  The onshore Spherical Cap Bouguer gravity anomalies were calculated 

using a density of 2.67 tm
-3

.  These data were gridded using a variable density gridding 

technique provided by the INTREPID Geophysics software package.  The data were gridded 

to a cell size of 0.5 minutes of arc = 0.00833333º (approximately 800m). 

 

Grid spacing   : 0.5 minute = 0.0083333 degree (approximately 800 m)
