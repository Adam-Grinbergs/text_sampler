1.0 SUMMARY 
 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

At the request of Beaufield Resources Inc. (Beaufield), Micon International Limited (Micon) 

was retained to provide an independent Technical Report for the Tortigny polymetallic 

project.  The Technical Report includes an updated mineral resource estimate for a zone of 

high-grade polymetallic mineralization, identified by Noranda Inc. (Noranda) and Beaufield.   

 

The term, Troilus-Tortigny Property, in this report, refers to the entire area covered by the 

mineral licences, while the term, Tortigny Project, or Project, refers to the area on which the 

exploration programs have been conducted. 

 

The mineral resource area covered by the last drilling program up to December 4, 2013, is 

historically referred as the "Tortigny deposit". It consists of a mineralized fold structure 

called the Main Zone, and small satellite lenses around the fold.   

 

Micon does not have, nor has it previously had, any material interest in Beaufield Resources 

Inc., or related entities.  The relationship with Beaufield is solely a professional association 

between the client and the independent consultant.  This report is prepared in return for fees 

based upon agreed commercial rates and the payment of these fees is in no way contingent on 

the results of this report. 

 

This report includes technical information which requires subsequent calculations or 

estimates to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages.  Such calculations or estimations 

inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error.  

Where these occur, Micon does not consider them to be material. 

 

This report is intended to be used by Beaufield subject to the terms and conditions of its 

agreement with Micon.  That agreement permits Beaufield to file this report as a Technical 

Report with the Canadian Securities Administrators pursuant to provincial securities 

legislation.  Except for the purposes legislated under provincial securities laws, any other use 

of this report, by any third party, is at that party's sole risk. 

 

The conclusions and recommendations in this report reflect the authors' best independent 

judgment in light of the information available to them at the time of writing.  The authors and 

Micon reserve the right, but will not be obliged, to revise this report and conclusions if 

additional information becomes known to them subsequent to the date of this report.  Use of 

this report acknowledges acceptance of the foregoing conditions. 

 

1.2 LOCATION 
 

The Troilus-Tortigny Property is situated in the southern portion of the James Bay 

Municipality within the Province of Quebec, Canada.  This region is located within the 



 
 

 2 

eastern segment of the Frotet-Evans Greenstone Belt within the Opatica Sub-province of the 

Superior Province (Gosselin, 1996), approximately 98 km north of the town of 

Chibougamau, in northwestern Quebec, Canada.  The claim package is centered 

approximately on latitude 50°50' North and longitude 74°34' West (510800E, 5608600N, 

Datum NAD83, zone 18). 

 

1.3 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND OWNERSHIP 
 

The Troilus-Tortigny Property is located within the National Topographic Sheets (NTS) 

32J09, 32J10, 32J15, 32J16 and 32O01 and, as of April 1, 2014, it consists of non-contiguous 

claims or block of claims (Table 4.1) composed of 542 map designated claims (CDC).  The 

property totals 26,886.18 ha (268.86 km
2
).  The list of active claims as of June 2, 2014, 

including mineral tenure information, is shown in Appendix 1 which shows the expiry date, 

work credits and repartition of the claims.   

 

The Tortigny block consists of 187 CDCs.  The claim blocks cover a total of 8,543.76 ha, or 

85.43 km
2
. 

 

On July 1, 2004, Noranda and Beaufield entered into a binding letter agreement, wherein 

Beaufield had an option to earn a 50% interest in all of Noranda's properties in the Troilus 

area.  To earn its 50% interest, Beaufield had to incur work expenditures of $2.2 million up 

to December 1, 2006.  Noranda acted as the operator of the exploration program. 

 

Noranda merged with Falconbridge Limited (Falconbridge) in 2005 and the combined 

company continued operations under the name Falconbridge Limited.  In 2006 Falconbridge 

was acquired by Xstrata Inc. 

 

Beaufield earned its 50% interest in all of Falconbridge's properties in the Troilus area with 

the total work expenditures of $2.2 million completed as of October 31, 2006. 

 

Under the terms of the agreement, Falconbridge has the right to purchase up to 100% of 

Beaufield's ore or concentrate produced from the property package under competitive 

purchase terms in the then-prevailing marketplace. 

 

On May 17, 2006, the parties amended the July 1, 2004 agreement and added 14 claims 

which constitute the Baie Moleon Claims.  Falconbridge acquired an additional 25% interest 

in the Baie Moleon Claims (for a total interest of 100%) pursuant to the terms of a purchase 

agreement dated December 15, 2005 between Falconbridge and Exploration Amex Inc.  The 

Baie Moleon claims are subject to 1% net smelter return (NSR) royalty payable to Amex 

with the option to purchase one half of this royalty for $500,000. 

 

On November 2, 2007, Beaufield acquired from Xstrata Canada Corporation (Xstrata), 

Xstrata's 50% interest in the Tortigny property for $700,000 in cash.  In addition to the cash 

payment, Xstrata retained a 1% NSR royalty in the property, except for a portion subject to a 



 
 

 3 

2% NSR in favour of Vale S.A. (former Inco Limited (Inco)).  Beaufield has an option to 

purchase one-half of Vale's NSR at any time for $1,000,000. 

 

Following the transaction in November, 2007, Beaufield owns 100% of the entire Troilus-

Tortigny Property. 

 

Since acquiring the interest from Xstrata, Beaufield has staked additional claims in this area; 

these are not subject to an NSR and are not subject to purchase of ore requirements. 

 

1.4 HISTORY 
 

The exploration in the area began in 1957, when the discovery of a Cu-Ni rich mineralized 

boulder started an intense period of staking and the funding of an airborne MAG-EM 

(magnetic-electromagnetic) survey. 

 

The area's potential for base metals was established in 1970 with the discovery of the 

Lessard deposit.  In 1987, Kerr Addison Mines Limited explored the northern half of the area 

and discovered the Troilus porphyry-type deposit that was developed and is known as the 

Troilus mine.  In 1988, massive sulphides were intersected in a drill hole in the anomaly east 

from the Domergue property. 

 

In early 1990s, Inco explored several showings, including the Inco Boulders and the PK 

(Peachy Keen) showing, and demonstrated the potential for volcanogenic mineralization (Zn-

Cu-Ag-Au) in the area.  In 1994, Noranda discovered the Tortigny deposit.  An historical 

(non-NI 43-101 compliant) estimation by Geostat Systems International Inc. (Geostat) (1997) 

resulted in "geological resources" of 428,310 tons grading 2.43% Cu, 7.02% Zn, 65.82 g/t 

Ag, 0.33 g/t Au and 0.29% Pb.  In 1996, exploration by Sociéte Québécoise d'Exploitation 

Minière (SOQUEM) led to the discovery of the De Maures showing. 

 

In 2004 to 2005, Falconbridge conducted some prospecting, geological assessment, 

MegaTEM survey, helicopter VTEM survey, borehole EM survey, ground-based Maximum 

Coupled-Minimum Coupled ("MaxMin") survey, basal till sampling, trenching and blasting, 

ground-based DEEPEM survey and 22 diamond drill holes.  The work was located on several 

areas referred to as the Tortigny, Chalonneau Boulder, Monique, Inco Boulder, Lenmac, Lac 

Diléo, Lac Moléon and Lessard SW areas (Chinn, et al, 2006). 

 

In 2006, Falconbridge performed a VTEM survey over nine grids and drilled five diamond 

drill holes (with a BHEM survey inside two of them) across the Troilus-Tortigny Property.  

 

Since 2004, Beaufield has completed several geophysical surveys and drilling programs as 

described in Section 9 of this Technical Report.

1.5 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
 

1.5.1 Regional Geology 
 

The Troilus-Tortigny Property, located in the Superior Province, lies within the eastern part 

of the Opatica Subprovince, in the Archean Frotet-Evans greenstone belt.  The greenstone 

belt is bounded to the north, south and east by large tonalitic batholiths.  The belt extends 

some 250 km from Lac Mistassini to the Nottaway River and is divided into four segments: 

1) Evans-Ouagama, 2) Storm-Evans, 3) Assinica and 4) Frotet-Troilus.  It is composed of 

two Archean volcanic structures separated by a sedimentary basin.  The area covered by this 

report corresponds to the western part of the Frotet-Evans Greenstone Belt and the Frotet-

Troilus volcanic complex.  It is divided into four structural and lithostratigraphic domains or 

volcanic cycles that are divided by major fault.  

 

The first cycle is found in the De Maurès, La Fourche and Dompierre Formations.  It consists 

mostly of tholeiitic basalt, more or less magnesian at the base and the top members of the 

three formations are composed of ferrotholeites.  The volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) 

occurrences found in these formations are rich in pyrite and pyrrhotite and are usually 

associated with sediments and/or pyroclastic horizons.  

 

The second cycle corresponds to the pyroclastic calc-alkaline units of the Odon and Frotet 

Formations.  The rock is characterized by block, lapilli or crystal tuffs associated with minor 

slivers of fine grained sediments and felsic to intermediate volcanics. 

 

The third cycle is described as the transition between the volcanic and the sedimentary zones, 

and is represented by the Châtillon, Parker, Domergue-Sud and Misière Formations.  

Komatiitic basalts with micro-spinifex, variolitic, massive and pillowed basalt characterize 

the Châtillon Formation.  Minor bands of tuff (ash and lapilli) and sediments (mudstone) can 

also be found in this formation.  The Parker Formation corresponds to gabbros with basalts 

and/or andesites associated with volcaniclastic horizons.  Garnets are frequent in the upper 

members of this formation.  The Domergue-Sud Formation consists of magnesian basalt 

(Simard, 1987).  Finally the Misière Formation is formed essentially by pillowed basalt. 

 

The fourth cycle is dominated by the Domergue-Nord Complex, composed of magnesian 

basalts associated with some layers of sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks.  

 

The volcano-sedimentary assemblages are metamorphosed to greenschist facies in the center 

of the belt.  The metamorphic level rises to upper amphibolite facies close to the contact with 

the Opatica gneiss.  Several intrusive rocks occur in the area with composition varying from 

tonalitic to ultramafic.  The most important intrusions are the North Troilus Lake pluton, the 

Parker Lake pluton and the Domergue pluton.

1.5.2 Property Geology  
 

Noranda sampled and mapped the area in the mid-1990s.  Much of the description herein 

summarizes Noranda's observations. 

 

Beaufield's Troilus-Tortigny Property is underlain by two distinctive domains, the Châtillon 

Formation (Phase 3) to the north and the Frotet Formation (Phase 2) to the south, separated 

by an east-southeast-trending regional fault (Figure 7.1). 

 

On the property, the Châtillon Formation mainly comprises massive flows of magnesian 

basalts with one thin intercalated felsic tuff and sediment horizon; thick sequences of 

massive flows of tholeiitic basalts (MAF1) apparently overlain by massive to pillowed flows 

of tholeiitic to transitional basalts (MAF2).  The two sub-groups are distinguished on the 

basis of their TiO2/Zr and Zr/Y ratios as well by the Zr/TiO2 vs. Nb/Y discrimination 

diagram.  All show a clear enrichment in Ti, Y and Zr typical during magmatic 

differentiation.  Of particular interest is the presence of a continuous, highly deformed 

sedimentary horizon (SED unit) composed of black argillites and siltstones.  This 

sedimentary package hosts the Tortigny deposit.  Its stratigraphic position is also worth 

noting as it lies at the contact between the MAF1 (sub-group 1) and MAF2 (sub-group 2) 

basalts.  Also, only few rare samples have shown Na depletion and/or sericitization 

(K2O/Na2O ratio) but some of those showing the highest degree of alteration are located 

within the sub-group 1 basalts, just below the Tortigny deposit.  Some Fe-Ti gabbros have 

been observed in the eastern portion of the property.  They are mainly composed of medium 

to coarse grained amphiboles and plagioclase with up to 15% pyrrhotite, giving a strong 

magnetic signature.   

 

The Frotet Formation, directly south of the La Fourche fault, comprises a sequence of ash, 

lapilli, block and plagioclase/quartz crystal tuffs as well as minor lava flows.  The 

composition of this flow is dacitic, transitional to calc-alkaline.  Some mineralization has 

been observed in the tuffs but without significant values.   

 

Finally, the Lac Châtillon granodiorite intrusion is present on the northeast portion of the 

project.  It has been interpreted as a late- to post-tectonic intrusion. 

 

Two phases of deformation have been recognized on the project.  D1, the most important, is 

associated with north verging, ENE-WSW to E-W isoclinal folds.  In the sediments it is 

characterized by a penetrative sub-vertical E-W schistosity and in the basalts by various 

shear zones.  The second phase of deformation D2 has affected D1 and is mainly 

characterized by the development of a crenulation cleavage on the S1 surface. 

 

The excavated area over the Tortigny deposit has exposed a discontinuous series of 

sphalerite- and chalcopyrite-rich sulfide layers within a tightly folded sedimentary horizon.  

The sediments are graphitic shales, siltstones and mica-andalusite schists, of presumed 

volcanodetritic origin at the contact between the underlying sub-group 1 tholeiitic basalts and 

the overlying sub-group 2 tholeiitic to transitional basalts.  Small lenses of whitish 



 
 

 6 

quartzofeldspathic material have been observed at the base of the siltstones or forming 

decimetre to metre width horizons in the upper portion of the sedimentary package, in close 

association with the sulphides.  The nature and the protolith of this quartzofeldspathic 

material are unknown but it shows some textural characteristics of a tuffite and is locally 

brecciated.  

 

Massive sulphides have been exposed during stripping and trenching.  They form a 

discontinuous horizon systematically located in the upper portion of the sedimentary 

package, associated with the mica schists, tuffites and crystal tuffs, within a few metres of the 

contact with the overlying sub-group 2 tholeiitic to transitional basalts.   

 

Drilling has shown that the mineralization extends from the surface to a depth of 330 m 

below surface in a characteristic "V" shape.  Most of the mineralization is confined to the 

fold hinge and the southern limb of the fold structure.   

 

1.5.3  Mineralization 
 

The Cu-Zn-Ag-Au mineralization consists of semi-massive to massive lenses located within 

a sequence of graphitic sediments, namely argillite, siltstone, greywacke and felsic tuffs, 

interlayered between two distinct basaltic units of tholeiitic to transitional composition.  The 

mineralized zones are generally located near the contact between the graphitic black argillites 

and the mafic volcanics.  The absence of pyrite, combined with the unusual mineralogical 

association of sphalerite and pyrrhotite (they do not precipitate at the same temperature), 

suggests an intense remobilization of the sulphides during metamorphism. 

 

The sulphide horizons tend to appear as a series of discontinuous lenses of semi-massive to 

massive sulphides enclosed within a thinner horizon of dessiminated sulphides of some 

lateral extent.  The mounts show a complex and zoned internal stratigraphy, composed of a 

metric-scale sphalerite rich lens enclosed within a pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite sulphide 

assemblage forming a continuous horizon extending laterally.  Silicified material, invaded by 

a stockwork of quartz + sulphide veinlets, generally separates the sphalerite-rich lenses from 

the pyrrhotite + chalcopyrite horizon.  Some fragments of sphalerite have been locally 

observed within the gabbros. 

 

In 2011, Beaufield engaged SGS Canada Inc. (SGS) to conduct an optical mineralogy, SEM-

EDS and QEMSCAN
TM

 analysis of five samples.  The mineralogical tests show that the main 

base metal sulphides include sphalerite, chalcopyrite and iron sulphides, mainly pyrrhotite 

(SGS Canada Inc. (Lakefield), 2011).  Traces of galena and argentite have been observed.  

Pyrrhotite occurs as coarse-grained aggregates exhibiting a granoblastic texture.  Sphalerite is 

associated with pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.   

 

A stockwork of sulphide and quartz veins is generally present with the massive sulphide 

lenses.  SEM-EDS analysis shows that sphalerite contains significant iron in its structure.  

Pyrite occurs as euhedral, small grain-sized crystals within the mainly silicate (quartz, 

feldspar and micas) gangue forming the matrix for the sulphides.  Pyrite is rarely directly 



 
 

 7 

associated with the other forms of sulphides.  The sulphides exhibit both straight and 

curvilinear, but sharp, grain boundaries with each other, with minimum interpenetration in 

both types of samples.  Disseminated sulphides occur as inclusions in silicates and as 

complex particles primarily because of the fine-grained intergrowths with silicates.  SEM-

EDS analysis identified a number of silver species, and also bismuth and a Co-Sb-sulphide, 

likely costibite (CoSbS).  The main silver mineral is argentite (Ag2S), which occurs as 

inclusions and in veinlets cross-cutting the sulphides.  Tentatively identified native silver and 

AgSnS, AgTe, Ag-(Au) alloys are also present.  Some of the silver minerals are very fine-

grained and difficult to quantify their composition.  Silver minerals occur as fine-grained, 

typically <20 μm and rarely up to <100 μm.  They occur as inclusions and veinlets cross-

cutting pyrrhotite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. 

 

Disseminated sulphides are also present within the graphitic argillites forming millimetre-

scale lenses stretched within the regional foliation.  The sulphides (less than 5% modal 

composition) are generally composed of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite with occasional cubes of 

pyrite.  Finally, traces of sulphides can be found as fracture filling remobilized within 

sheared zones parallel to the predominant foliation. 

 

1.6 EXPLORATION 
 

Since the acquisition of the mineral claims forming the initial Tortigny block, Beaufield has 

increased the size of the property several times to include 542 claims.  Beaufield compiled all 

historical work in the area and digitized the data.   

 

Between 2008 and 2012, Beaufield conducted geological reconnaissance and mapping in the 

vicinity of the Tortigny mineralized zone and a geochemical soil sampling program.  In 2008 

to 2009, Beaufield conducted a stripping and outcrop sampling program and followed up the 

positive results with airborne and ground geophysics and diamond drilling.  

 

Beaufield carried out the following geophysical surveys: 

 

 Ground and borehole infiniTEM survey and a detailed magnetic survey (December 
2008).  A ground and borehole TDEM InfiniTEM survey covering a total of 13.7 km 

at surface.  In addition, it drilled eight holes totalling 3,225 m.  Seven conductive 

anomalies where identified from the ground and one more from the borehole data.  

Numerical modelling of the data outlined several drill targets which were later tested. 

 

 MaxMin survey (HLEM) was completed on seven grids over the Troilus Project.  
 

 In August, 2010, a 3D borehole Pulse EM survey was conducted in six holes on the 
Tortigny deposit.  The six holes surveyed totalled 3,640 m.  Many anomalies were 

tested and explained during the 2010 to 2011 drilling program.  In February, 2011, six 

holes, totalling 988 m, were drilled.  A borehole TDEM program surveyed below the 

known deposit in order to detect new conductors.  Many in-hole and off-hole 

anomalies were detected, but none were located below the Tortigny mineralized lens. 



 
 

 8 

 

 Three induced polarization (IP) surveys and a ground magnetic survey were carried 
out over the Troilus property:  

 

 Grid 1 in February, 2011 with a total of 16 chargeability anomalies interpreted. 
 

 Grid 2 in February and May, 2011 with a total of 12 chargeability anomalies 
interpreted. 

 

 Grid 3, also in February, 2011, with a total of five chargeability anomalies defined 
(Internal communication). 

 

1.7 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

Micon completed a mineral resource estimate for the mineralization contained in the 

Tortigny polymetallic deposit discovered by Noranda and extended by Beaufield through its 

recent drilling programs.  

 

The Tortigny mineralized zone is a V-shaped synform with high grade sulphide polymetallic 

mineralization in the hinge of the fold and a plunge of approximately 265ᵒ/50ᵒ.  The south 
limb and the hinge zone strikes almost east-west (260° to 265ᵒ) with a 65 to 75ᵒ dip and the 
north limb strikes at west-northwest (275° to 280ᵒ) with a 70ᵒ to 75ᵒ dip.  The mineralized 
zone has been intersected in 98 drill holes continuously for a horizontal distance of 
approximately 600 m.  A total of 111 drill holes from Beaufield's exploration program and 

holes from the historical exploration were included in the subset of assay data used for the 

resource estimate.   

 

Composite values for copper, zinc, silver and gold were calculated from the raw assay data.  

The maximum included length was 3 m for waste or low-grade intervals with copper 

equivalent grades (CuEq) ≤0.15%.  These low-grade and waste intervals were included in 

composited intervals between high-grade samples.  A total of 2,487 sample composites were 

calculated from capped copper, zinc, silver and gold assay values for Beaufield's and 

historical diamond drill holes.  Capping levels based on statistical analysis were determined 

to be 14% Cu, 29.5% Zn, 450 g/t Ag, and 16.0 g/t Au.  

 

The 3D geological model for the Tortigny deposit is based on the geological database, 

provided by Beaufield as Excel files.  The dataset contained lithological, structural, specific 

gravity, assay data, mineralization and geophysical data.  Wireframes for the three main 

lithological domains (MAF1, MAF2 and SED) and two mineralized domains (LG and HG) 

were created, using sectional interpretation and interactive 3D triangulation.  The solids for 

the lithological units, faults and mineralised zones were modelled in GEMS 6.4
®
, 

commercial software.  

 

The block size selection was based on drill spacing, type of mineralization, mineralized zone 

geometry and thickness.  The 6 m vertical height corresponds to common open pit mining 



 
 

 9 

bench heights.  All estimates are based on a parent block cell dimensions 6 m by 3 m by 6 m.  

The block model parameters are tabulated in Table 1.1.

The block grades for Au (g/t), Ag (g/t), Zn (%), Cu (%) and specific gravity (SG) were 

interpolated into the individual blocks of the mineralized domains using the ordinary kriging 

(OK) function of the GEMS 6.4
®
 software and the following search parameters (see Table 

1.2):

The mineral resources include all mineralized blocks within one to three times the variogram 

range and the volume in each block is weighted by the percent attribute.  The percent 

attributed shows how much of the block is included in the mineralized domain.  The areas 

and contiguous blocks that were estimated in Pass 1 were classified in the Measured 

category.  The blocks estimated in Pass 2 in the Indicated category and those estimated in 

Pass 3 and the blocks that did not meet the criteria of the Indicated category were classified 

in the Inferred category.  Generally, the Measured resource area has been drilled on 20 m by 

15 m or less, the Indicated resource area has been drilled on 25 m to 30 m by 50 m and the 

Inferred resource areas have been drilled on 100 m by 100 m grid or larger.

The formula used by Micon for calculation of the CuEq% is as follows: 

 

CuEq (%) = 

    Cu% * Cu_recov * Cu_price/Cu_price 

 +Zn% * Zn_recov * Cu_price * (Zn_price/Cu_price) 

 +Ag_g/t * Ag_recov * Ag_price * (0.03215*Ag_price)/(22.04 * Cu_price) 

 +Au_g/t * Au_recov * Au_price * (0.03215*Au_price)/(22.04*Cu_price) 

 

The formula is based on metal values in US dollars.  Micon used the 3-year average metal 

prices for copper and zinc published by Metal Bulletin.  The price for gold and silver, used to 

calculate the copper equivalent grades for the resource estimate, are the long term metal 

prices, projected by Energy and Metals Consensus Forecast in December, 2013. 

 

The Mineral Resource statement was prepared on the basis of the copper, zinc, silver and 

gold content and is reported at different cut-off grades considering the most likely extraction 

scenario without taking external, non-mining based factors into account.  The open pittable 

mineral resources are constrained within an economically optimized pit shell. 

 

A review of the composites and the figures indicate that a 0.15% CuEq was used as a cut-off 

grade for the polymetallic mineralization.  Therefore the mineralized envelope and the 3D 

mineralization solid was generated is at 0.15 % CuEq cut-off.  In order to create 

economically optimal pit shells and underground stopes around the mineralized zones and 

estimate the minable resources the following key parameters and assumptions were used: 

 

 Open pit mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.50 % CuEq. 
 

 Underground mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 2.25% CuEq. 
  

 Cut-off grades are based on a long term copper price US$3.28/lb, zinc price 
US$0.95/lb, silver price US$22.5/oz and gold price of US$1,400/oz. 

 

 Metallurgical recoveries were applied as follows: 86% for Cu, 73% for Zn, 65% for 
Ag, and 50% for Au.  

 

 Costs assumed for open pit development were: $2.00/t mined, $12.50/t processed and 
$2.50/t for G&A, ecological monitoring and community relations, or a total of 

$17.00/t processed. 

 

 Costs for underground development were: $60/t mined, $12.50/t processed and 
$2.50/t for G&A, ecological monitoring and community relations, or a total of 

$75.00/t processed. 

 

 Percent payable metals after refining were: 75% for Cu, 75% for Zn, 80% for Ag and 
95 % for Au. 

 



 
 

 11 

 Assumed transportation cost: $2/t concentrate. 
 

The resource block model was subjected to analysis using conventional GEMS 6.4
®
 and 

Whittle 4.5
®
 software, to define potentially economic mineralized blocks and prepare the 

optimized pit shell, using the economic criteria described above.   

 

The Mineral Resource was separated into In-Pit Resources and Underground Resources.  The 

Mineral Resource is presented in Table 1.3 at 0.50% CuEq cut-off grades for the open pit 

(OP) portion and 2.25% CuEq cut-off grade for the underground (UG) portion of the deposit. 

 

As of June 2, 2014 the updated mineral resources for the Tortigny deposit are estimated to 

contain: 

 

 Measured Resources of 550,000 tonnes grading 2.3% copper (Cu), 4.23% zinc (Zn), 
59.99 g/t silver (Ag) 0.43 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Indicated Resources of 548,000 tonnes grading 1.18% copper (Cu), 3.09% zinc (Zn), 
36.19 g/t silver (Ag), 0.25 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Measured and Indicated Resources of 1,098,000 tonnes grading 1.78% copper (Cu), 
3.65% zinc (Zn), 48.51 g/t silver (Ag), 0.35 g/t gold (Au) and  

 

 Inferred Resources of 99,000 tonnes grading 1.19% copper (Cu), 1.23% zinc (Zn), 
12.45 g/t silver (Ag) and <0.1 g/t gold (Au).

It is Micon's opinion that there are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 

socio-economic, marketing or political issues that would adversely affect the mineral 

resource estimate presented in Table 1.3.  However, the mineral resources presented herein 

are not mineral reserves as they have not been subject to adequate economic studies to 

demonstrate their economic viability and there is no certainty that all or any part of the 

estimated Mineral Resources will be converted into Mineral Reserves. 

 

1.8 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Beaufield's drill programs from 2008 to 2013 resulted in delineation of an extension of the 

Tortigny mineralized zone and allowed the resource estimate for the Tortigny deposit to be 

updated.  

 

As of June 2, 2014 the updated mineral resources for the Tortigny deposit are estimated to 

contain: 

 

 Measured Resources of 550,000 tonnes grading 2.3% copper (Cu), 4.23% zinc (Zn), 
59.99 g/t silver (Ag) 0.43 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Indicated Resources of 548,000 tonnes grading 1.18% copper (Cu), 3.09% zinc (Zn), 
36.19 g/t silver (Ag), 0.25 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Measured and Indicated Resources of 1,098,000 tonnes grading 1.78% copper (Cu), 
3.65% zinc (Zn), 48.51 g/t silver (Ag), 0.35 g/t gold (Au) and  

 

 Inferred Resources of 99,000 tonnes grading 1.19% copper (Cu), 1.23% zinc (Zn), 
12.45 g/t silver (Ag) and <0.1 g/t gold (Au). 

 

The drilling intersected additional small lenses, parallel to the main mineralization, located in 

the same metasedimentary unit, that are not included in the current resource estimate.   

 

In order to advance the Tortigny Project, it is recommended that Beaufield continues its 

exploration program.  Based on the positive results from the previous exploration programs 

and the current resource estimate Micon has the following recommendations: 

  

 Conduct a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) on the measured, indicated and 
inferred resources.  The components of the study should include an engineering study 

(open pit, underground stopes, additional metallurgical tests, mill and access road), 

metallurgical bench testing and relevant environmental studies.  An economic 

analysis should be conducted on a fully cost project basis. 

 

 Carry out structural analyses in order to identify fold structures similar to the 
Tortigny metasedimentary synform.  In areas without surface outcrops, oriented core 

drilling would be helpful to determine late brittle fault orientations and predict the 



 
 

 14 

offset direction and magnitude.  Detailed structural mapping is recommended in the 

area of recently stripped outcrops northeast of the TO‐10‐19 drill hole collar.  
Additionally, systematic mapping of S0, S1 structures and fold asymmetry may help to 

identify other hinge zones and prospective parasitic folds. 

 

 The rest of the property, east of the Tortigny mineralized zone (east of 511150E), 
remains underexplored.  Therefore, stripping, mapping and sampling of the area ENE 

of the known fold hinge along the strike of the outcrop of the sulphide rich 

metasedimentary unit may contain isolated lenses of mineralized metasediments in 

fold troughs.  Exploration for other types of deposits should also be considered.  For 

example, porphyry-style mineralization typical of the Troilus Mine may also exist in 

the area near Tortigny. 

 

 The results from the QA/QC should be plotted and monitored on a regular basis.  If 
the standards fail the test, then the whole batch should be reassayed.  When the new 

assay results are received, the QA/QC graphs should be updated to reflect the latest 

results. 

 

 Full lineament analysis and structural interpretations of the regional magnetic survey 
and any available satellite imagery or air photos should be carried out. 

 

Following the interpretation of the geophysical surveys, Beaufield proposes to conduct 

regional exploration and exploratory drilling along the margins of the northeast and 

southwest quadrants (pressure shadows) of the intrusion directly northeast of the Tortigny 

polymetallic mineralized zone.  A two-phase exploration program with a budget of 

$2,000,000 is proposed.  The first phase will include economic studies for Tortigny deposit 

that will cost approximately $250,000.  The second phase will include stripping, mapping, 

sampling and exploratory drilling on the exploration targets close to the Tortigny deposit.  

The second phase is estimated to cost $1,640,000.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
 

At the request of Mr. Jens Hansen, P.Eng, President of Beaufield Resources Inc. (Beaufield), 

Micon International Limited (Micon) was retained to provide an independent Technical 

Report for the Tortigny Project located in the southern James Bay Region, within the 

Province of Quebec, Canada.  Beaufield owns a 100% interest in the Troilus-Tortigny 

Property (26,886.18 ha or 268.88 km
2
), which contains the Tortigny polymetallic deposit.  

The Tortigny contiguous block comprises 187 map designated claims (CDC) covering an 

area of 8,543.76 ha (85.43 km
2
). 

 

This Technical Report also presents a mineral resource estimate for the Tortigny polymetallic 

deposit.  The mineral resource estimate follows Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 

Petroleum (CIM) standards and definitions for the estimation of resources and reserves.  This 

report also comments on the suitability of the proposed exploration program and budget for 

the Tortigny Project. 

 

This report was prepared in accordance with the reporting requirements of Canadian National 

Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) and Form 43-101F1 which was revised and amended as of 

June 30, 2011. 

 

The geological setting of the property, mineralization style and occurrences, and exploration 

history were described in various internal reports and in "NI 43-101 Technical Report on the 

Tortigny Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate, Québec" (SGS, 2013), and in various 

government and other publications listed in Section 28, References.  The relevant sections of 

those reports are reproduced herein. 

 

The term Troilus-Tortigny Property, in this report, refers to the entire area covered by the 

mineral licences, while the term Tortigny Project refers to the area within the Tortigny West 

block and Tortigny Main block of mineral licences on which the exploration programs have 

been conducted. 

 

The resource area covered by the last drilling program up to December 31, 2013, is 

historically referred as the Tortigny deposit.  It consists of a main zone, located in the hinge 

of a V-shaped synform with a mean fold axis plunge (F1) of 260°/50°, also called the 

Tortigny polymetallic main zone, and small satellite lenses around the main zone.   

 

All currency amounts are stated in Canadian dollars ($), or as specified, with costs and 

commodity prices typically expressed in US dollars (US$).  Quantities are generally stated in 

Système International d'Unités (SI) units, the standard Canadian and international practice, 

including metric tonnes (t) and kilograms (kg) for weight, kilometres (km) or metres (m) for 

distance, hectares (ha) for area, grams (g) and grams per metric tonne (g/t) for gold and silver 

grades (g/t Au, g/t Ag).  Wherever applicable, any Imperial units of measure encountered 

have been converted to metric units for reporting consistency.  Precious metal grades may be 

expressed in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb) and their quantities may also 



 
 

 17 

be reported in troy ounces (oz), a common practice in the mining industry.  Table 2.1 is a list 

of the various abbreviations used throughout this report.

T. Ilieva, P.Geo., Senior Geologist with Micon, and S. Kruse, P.Geo., Principal of Terrane 

Geoscience Inc., visited the Tortigny Project on October 28 and 29, 2013 and reviewed the 

surface outcrop and drill core.  They were assisted during the site visit by Mathieu Stephens, 

P.Geo., who is a chief geologist and exploration manager with Beaufield. 

 

The review of the Tortigny project was based on data and reports prepared by or for 

Beaufield and the previous owners of the property, published material researched by Micon, 

as well as data, professional opinions and unpublished material submitted by the professional 

staff of Beaufield or its consultants.  

 

Micon is pleased to acknowledge the helpful cooperation of Beaufield's management and 

personnel, all of whom made any and all data requested available and responded openly and 

helpfully to all questions, queries and requests for material. 

 

The Qualified Persons responsible for the preparation of this report are Tania Ilieva, Ph.D., 

P.Geo., Bogdan Damjanović, P.Eng. and Stefan Kruse, Ph.D., P.Geo.  

 

Dr. Ilieva conducted the site visit and reviewed the Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

(QA/QC) procedures conducted by Beaufield during the visit.  The site visit included a visit 

to the property and core storage facilities in the exploration camp on the property.  The 

model and parameters for the resource estimate were discussed during the site visit as a 

preliminary model and polygonal estimate of the mineral resources had previously been 

conducted for the Tortigny Property by Beaufield.  The previous estimate, prepared by SGS 

(2013) did not include the data from the last drilling program and some of the results from 

the previous drilling program.  Dr. Ilieva conducted the electronic review of the database and 

created the electronic model of the mineralized zone based upon the sections for the Tortigny 

Project provided by Beaufield.  

 



 
 

 19 

Dr. Kruse visited the outcrops, completed structural observations and measurements of the 

V-shaped synform which hosts the Tortigny mineralized zone, collected structural data and 

verified the existing structural model in advance of resource estimation.  He also reviewed 

the regional exploration data from a structural perspective.  

 

Mr. Damjanović was responsible for the review of the metallurgical testing and mineral 

processing.  

 

The mineral resource estimate commenced in November, 2013 in Toronto after the 

geological database was reviewed and verified for the purpose of completing a block model 

for the estimate.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 

Micon has reviewed and analyzed data provided by Beaufield and its consultants, and has 

drawn its own conclusions therefrom, augmented by its direct field examination.  Micon has 

not carried out any independent exploration work, drilled any holes or carried out any 

program of sampling and assaying on the property.  However, during the site visit three grab 

samples and five core samples (See Section 12, Table 12.1) were acquired by Micon for the 

purposes of confirming the mineralization on the Tortigny Property.  The random duplicate 

core samples were chosen after reviewing the core and geological database and were 

obtained from the core, stored in a core storage facility on the property.  

 

While exercising all reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing it, Micon has 

relied upon Beaufield's presentation of the project data from it and previous organizations in 

formulating its opinion. 

 

The authors of the Technical Report, Tania Ilieva, Ph.D., P. Geo., Bogdan Damjanović, 

P.Eng., and Stefan Kruse, Ph.D., P.Geo., are not qualified to comment on issues related to 

legal agreements, royalties, permitting and environmental matters.  A description of the 

property, and ownership thereof, is provided for general information purposes only.  Micon 

has independently checked the status of the mineral claims on the Quebec governmental 

Mining Title Management System (http://www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/english/mines/rights/rights-

gestim.jsp) on June 2, 2014.  Comments on the state of environmental conditions, liability 

and remediation have been made where required by NI 43-101, based on comments or data 

obtained from Beaufield.  Micon offers no opinion on the state of the environment on the 

property.  Statements with respect to environmental considerations are provided for 

information purposes only and have not been verified by Micon. 

 

The descriptions of geology, mineralization and exploration are taken from reports prepared 

by various companies or their contracted consultants.  The conclusions of this report rely on 

data available in published and unpublished reports, information supplied by the various 

companies which have conducted exploration on the property and information supplied by 

Beaufield.  The information provided to Beaufield was supplied by reputable companies and 

Micon has no reason to doubt its validity. 

 

The figures and tables for this report were reproduced or derived from reports written for 

Beaufield and the majority of the photographs were taken by the authors during the site 

visits.  Where the figures and tables are derived from sources other than Micon, the source is 

acknowledged below the figure or table.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

4.1 LOCATION 
 

Beaufield has assembled a claim package that now, altogether, constitutes the Troilus-

Tortigny Property.  The Tortigny project is situated in the southern portion of the James Bay 

region within the Province of Quebec, Canada (Figure 4.1).  It is located within the eastern 

segment of the Frotet-Evans Greenstone Belt within the Opatica subprovince of the Superior 

Province (Gosselin, 1996), approximately 98 km north of the town of Chibougamau, in 

northwestern Quebec, Canada.  The claim package is centered around 50°50' North and 

74°34' West (NTS map sheet 32J10).  Approximate Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 

coordinates are 510900 mE, 5,620,000 mN, NAD 83, Zone 18.

4.2 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND OWNERSHIP 
 

In Quebec, a mineral claim gives its holder the exclusive right to search, for a two-year 

period, within its defined territory, for any mineral substances which are in the public domain 

except for oil, natural gas, sand and all other surficial mineral substances. 

 

Beaufield has been exploring in the Troilus property area since 2003 and the property limits 

have changed several times.   

 

In June, 2004, Beaufield Consolidated Resources signed a joint venture with Noranda Inc. 

(subsequently Falconbridge Limitée, now Glencore Xstrata plc) on its Troilus area 

properties.  The agreement covered an area of approximately 24,000 ha.  On July 1, 2004, 

Noranda and Beaufield entered into a binding letter agreement, wherein Beaufield had an 

option to earn a 50% interest in all of Noranda's properties in the Troilus area.  To earn its 

50% interest, Beaufield had to incur work expenditures of $2.2 million up to December 1, 

2006.  Noranda acted as the operator of the exploration program. 

 

Noranda merged with Falconbridge Limited (Falconbridge) in 2005 and the combined 

company continued operations under the name Falconbridge Limited.  In 2006 Falconbridge 

was acquired by Xstrata Inc. 

 

Beaufield earned its 50% interest in all of Falconbridge's properties in the Troilus area with 

the total work expenditures of $2.2 million completed as of October 31, 2006. 

 

Under the terms of the agreement, Falconbridge has the right to purchase up to 100% of 

Beaufield's ore or concentrate produced from the property package under competitive 

purchase terms in the then-prevailing marketplace. 

 

On May 17, 2006, the parties amended the July 1, 2004 agreement and added 14 claims 

which constitute the Baie Moleon Claims.  Falconbridge acquired an additional 25% interest 

in the Baie Moleon Claims (for a total interest of 100%) pursuant to the terms of a purchase 

agreement dated December 15, 2005 between Falconbridge and Exploration Amex Inc.  The 

Baie Moleon claims are subject to a 1% net smelter return (NSR) royalty payable to Amex 

with the option to purchase one half of this royalty for $500,000. 

 

On November 2, 2007, Beaufield acquired from Xstrata Canada Corporation (Xstrata), 

Xstrata's 50% interest in the Troilus-Tortigny land package, which covered 788 claims 

(21,000 ha) for $700,000 in cash.  In addition to the cash payment, Xstrata retained a 1% 

NSR interest in the property, except for a portion subject to a 2% NSR in favour of Vale S.A 

(former Inco Limited (Inco)).  Beaufield has an option to purchase one-half of Vale's NSR at 

any time for $1,000,000. 

 

Following the transaction in November, 2007, Beaufield owns 100% of the entire Troilus-

Tortigny Property. 

 



 
 

 23 

 

The Troilus-Tortigny Property is located within the NTS sheets 32J09, 32J10, 32J15, 32J16 

and 32O01 and, as of June 2, 2014, is composed of non-contiguous claims or 19 blocks of 

claims (see Table 4.1) composed of 548 map designated claims (CDC).  The property totals 

26,886.18 ha (268.86 km
2
).  The list of active claims as of June 2, 2014, including mineral 

tenure information, is shown in Appendix 1.  Figure 4.2 shows the location of the claims.

The Tortigny polymetallic project includes the Tortigny Main block and West block, and 

contains the Tortigny polymetallic deposit.  The Main and West blocks comprise 187 

contiguous CDC totaling 8,543.76 ha (85.43 km
2
).  Beaufield owns a 100% interest in the 

Tortigny Project. 

 

4.2.1 Underlying Agreements and/or Royalties Obligations 
 

Currently the Troilus-Tortigny Property is 100% Beaufield owned.  Melkior Resources Inc. 

(Melkior) had an option to acquire a 50% interest over certain claims, but did not complete 

its earn-in.  Consequently, Melkior has not exercised its option and has dropped its interest in 

the property.   

 

Beaufield has royalty obligations to previous operators on some of the claims.  The NSR 

holders are Glencore Xstrata plc (Glencore), Amex Exploration Inc. (Amex) and Vale S.A. 

(Vale).  The details are tabulated in Table 4.2.

4.2.2 Mineral Claim Acquisition 
 

The main mode of mineral claim acquisition in Quebec is map staking and payment of a set 

fee with the acquisition conducted on the basis of first come, first served.  When the notice of 

map staking is accepted, the mining registrar inscribes the claims in the register and delivers 

a certificate of inscription confirming its existence.  Map staking can only be conducted on 

those territories designated by the MNRF.  The area and shape of the claim are reproduced 

on topographic maps kept at the registrar's office.  In surveyed territories, the shape of the 

claim corresponds to the shape of a lot. 

 

Field staking consists of delimitating an area using pickets to obtain a claim.  The persons 

staking a mineral claim must own a valid prospecting license which they are required to carry 

with them while staking any claims.  Once the staking notice has been accepted, the registrar 

inscribes it into the register and delivers a certificate of inscription attesting to the existence 

of the claim established by this method.  These territories are also indicated on topographic 

maps kept at the registrar's office.  This method of claim acquisition for the region is now 

defunct, and all field staked claims have been converted to the map designation format. 

 

4.2.3 Renewing a Mineral Claim 
 

The holder of a mineral claim can renew its title for a period of two years.  To do so, the 

holder must: 

 

 Deposit its renewal request at least 60 days before the expiry date. 
 

 Pay the required fee which varies according to the claim surface area, location of the 
mineral title and the reception date of the request. 

 

 Deposit the statutory work report and the declaration of mining work requested at 
least 60 days before the expiry date of the claim.  When the work completed exceeds 

the minimum requested, the surplus work can be used to renew claims located within 

a 4.5 km
1
 radius from the centre of the claim on which surplus is registered.  The 

surplus can be used for future renewals, provided there are sufficient funds. 

 

To renew its claims, the holder must complete the form "Demande de Renouvellement de 

Claims"
1
. 

 

The work credits that have been accumulated on the Tortigny Project mineral claims are 

sufficient to allow Beaufield to keep the claims with the known polymetallic mineralization 

such as Tortigny polymetallic deposit for decades without further work being conducted 

upon them.

4.2.4 Location of the Mineralization 
 

The high grade polymetallic mineralization, called the Tortigny deposit, is concentrated on a 

group of five claims (claim numbers 2401410, 2401411, 2401415, 2401416 and 2401498) in 

the central portion of Tortigny Main block on the Troilus-Tortigny Property. 

 

4.2.5 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 
 

All the mineral claims forming the Troilus-Tortigny Property were map staked by Beaufield 

except for a group of nine claims which were acquired in 2003 from Noranda Exploration 

Inc.  All of the mineral claims are owned 100% by Beaufield.  The information is tabulated 

in Table 4.2. 

 

4.2.6 Surface Rights and Access Agreements 
 

When land is not privately owned, it belongs primarily to the Crown and, in most relevant 

instances, this is the Province of Quebec.  In the case of Crown land, access is generally 

unlimited. 

 

If land is privately owned, then access to area has to be agreed upon with the surface land 

owner. 

 

In the case of the Troilus-Tortigny Property, there is no privately owned land overlying the 

mineral claims. 

 

4.2.7 Permits and Environmental Liabilities 
 

Beaufield held all permits required to undertake the work program documented herein.  

However, to allow for additional exploration activities, Beaufield has obtained all permits 

and certification from relevant governmental agencies.  This includes an "Autorisation de 

coupe de bois sur un territoire du domainede l'État où s'exerce un droit minier".

 provided 

by the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune du Québec (MRNF), which was 

renewed in March, 2014. 

 

Micon is unaware of any other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the 

right or ability to perform the exploration work recommended for the Tortigny project.   

 

Micon's personnel are not qualified to comment on issues related to environmental matters.  

The Tortigny polymetallic project is an underdeveloped exploration project and, in 

Beaufield's opinion, only minimal surface disturbances, primarily arising from surface 

exploration activities such as prospecting, trenching and drilling, have occurred within the 

project area.

Beaufield has indicated to Micon that there are no known environmental liabilities on the 

Tortigny Property. 

 

No work permit is required if mapping, sampling and geophysical surveys are to be 

conducted on the property, as long as no disturbance of the natural environment is conducted. 

 

A regular "Permis d'intervention en Forêt"
2
 is required to be obtained from the MNRF in 

order to conduct drilling, trenching or stripping on the property.  This permit is already 

obtained by Beaufield. 

 

Further permitting and environmental studies would be required if the project were to 

advance beyond the exploration stage. 

 

4.3 MICON COMMENTS 
 

Micon is unaware of any other outstanding environmental liabilities at the Tortigny Project, 

other than those normally associated with possessing a mineral claim in Quebec.  Micon is 

unable to comment on any remediation which may have been undertaken by previous 

companies. 

 

Micon is unaware of any other significant factors or risks that may affect access, title or the 

right or ability of Beaufield to perform work on the Tortigny Property. 

 

Other than those discussed previously, Micon is not aware of any royalties, back-in rights, 

payments or other agreements and encumbrances which apply to the Tortigny Property.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 
 

The Tortigny Project is located approximately 98 km north of the town of Chibougamau and 

40 km southwest of the former Troilus mine, a past gold/copper producer.  The property can 

be accessed by using Highway 167 north from Chibougamau and the Route de Nord (305) to 

Tortigny.  The road is a gravel road, but it is well maintained and open during the whole 

year.  From Chibougamau, the area of the Main zone can easily be reached by a two-hour 

drive.   

 

A system of forestry and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) roads and trails cover most of the 

property.  The field work can be carried out using pickup trucks and ATVs.  During the snow 

season a snow plow is required.  Some of the remote claims are accessible only by helicopter. 

 

The airport in Chibougamau provides direct access to Montreal via daily flights on Air 

Creebec.  Chibougamau is well connected to other parts of the provinces of Quebec and 

Ontario through a series of paved highways. 

 

5.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

Climate is typical of the James Bay area region with long cold winters and short and 

relatively dry summers.  The minimum and maximum mean annual temperatures are -13.5°C 

and 5.5°C, respectively, based on climate normals for the period 1981 to 2010 at the nearest 

climate station, Chapais.  The average July minimum and maximum temperatures are 9.5°C 

and 22.2°C, respectively, and the average January minimum and maximum temperatures are 

-24.2°C and -13.5°C, respectively (Environment Canada, 2013). 

 

In some areas general topography is quite flat and wetlands (bogs) are widespread making it 

difficult to travel in an ATV where forestry roads do not exist. 

 

Annual average precipitation at Chapais is 995.8 mm (Environment Canada, 2012).  The 

region receives up to approximately 312 cm of snow annually and the ground is snow 

covered on average from November to mid-May.  Grassroots exploration activities can 

generally be conducted during the summer and autumn months (May to the end of October). 

Drilling can be done during the whole year and the swampy areas can be drilled during the 

winter to early spring (January to April). 

 

The local topography (Figure 5.1) is characterized by low gently rolling terrain, expressed as 

northeast-trending drumlins.  A few hills are also present.  The forest covering a large portion 

of the Troilus-Tortigny Property was subject to a forest fire about 35 years ago, leaving large 

open areas with abundant deadfall.  Outside the burned or logged area, the territory is 

covered by moderately dense spruce forest with occasional patches of birch and red pine.  

Lakes cover approximately 10% of the property.

5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The town of Chibougamau is the main communication and supply center for the area.  A 

number of government agencies and private businesses provide services to the mining and 

exploration sector.  A long history of mining in the region has contributed to the development 

of a well-skilled work force.  Some local and skilled labour, as well as professional labour 

may be hired out of Chibougamau but some of the skilled and professional labour may need 

to be sourced from other regions within Quebec or Canada. 

 

Water sources are abundant on and adjacent to the property.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

6.1 INTRODUCTION  
 

The following summarizes the exploration work conducted on the various areas included in 

the Troilus-Tortigny Property.  Most of the information described below has been compiled 

and provided by Beaufield personnel and was published in the "Technical Report on the 

Tortigny Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate, Quebec" (Thibert, and Rousseau, 2013).  As 

provided under Section 2.4 of NI 43-101, some of the resource and/or reserve estimates 

presented in this report are historical in nature and not compliant with the reporting 

requirements of NI 43-101.  They are provided for information purposes only.  Neither 

Beaufield nor the authors of this report have reviewed nor processed the historical data to 

classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Beaufield 

and the authors of this report are not treating the historical estimates as current mineral 

resources or mineral reserves. 

 

Exploration in the area began in 1957, when the discovery of a Cu-Ni rich mineralized 

boulder started an intense period of staking and the funding of an airborne MAG-EM survey.  

The first showing found in 1958-1959 was hosted in veins and revealed the copper-gold or 

gold potential of the area (Gosselin, 1996).  In 1961, the volcanogenic Baie Moléon showing 

(see Figure 7.1) was discovered, and an historical resource estimate by Selco Mining 

Corporation Ltd. (Selco) of 200,000 tons grading 1.57% Cu, 3.25% Zn and 0.75oz/t Ag  

(Hutton, 1974).  This showing is currently held by Beaufield.  The Diléo and Yorbeau 

mineral occurrences were also found.  The same year, the Lac Coulombe showing (best grab 

sample: 12.6% Ag, 1.0% Cu and 5.3% Zn) was discovered (Blanchet and L'Heureux, 2002).  

Spodumene-rich intrusions were recognized in 1963 on the Moblan property. 

 

The area's potential for base metals was demonstrated in 1970 with the discovery of the 

Lessard mineralization.  In 1987, Kerr Addison explored the northern half of the area and 

discovered the Troilus deposit, an important porphyry type deposit which was subsequently 

developed as the Troilus mine.  In 1988, massive sulphides were intersected in a drill hole in 

anomaly E on the Domergue property. 

 

In 1991, Inco discovered a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) boulder (since named the 

Inco Bolder) with the best grade obtained from sample 178351 (8.19g/t Au, 33.7g/t Ag, 

3.98% Cu and 2.14% Zn) (Samson, P., 1993).  Two years later, Inco discovered the PK 

(Peachy Keen) showing.  Hole 85420-0 returned 17.7g/t Ag, 0.8% Cu and 2.59% Zn over 

14.9 m (Samson, P. 1994), thus increasing the interest in volcanogenic mineralization (Zn-

Cu-Ag-Au) in the area.  In 1994, Noranda discovered the Tortigny polymetallic 

mineralization and prepared the first historic mineral resource estimate (Geostat, 1997) with 

"geological resources" of 466,000 tons grading 2.24% Cu, 6.17% Zn, 61.84 g/t Ag, 0.33 g/t 

Au and 0.24% Pb. 

  

In 1996, SOQUEM's exploration projects lead to the discovery of the De Maurès showing.

6.2 GENERAL PROPERTY HISTORY 
 

The work carried out on the property is described separately for three different areas: Troilus-

Tortigny, Baie Moléon and Diléo showing.  Historical work described under the general 

Troilus-Tortigny area section is not repeated under other sections.  The official report 

numbers attributed by the MNRF are mentioned in brackets when applicable. 

 

6.2.1 Troilus-Tortigny Area 
 

The Troilus-Tortigny area corresponds roughly to Troilus Beaufield's present claims.  

Exploration is summarized as follows: 

 

1971 to 1972: Selco, in partnership with Muscocho Exploration Limited, conducted a 

regional exploration campaign and a ground, airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey 

(Watson, 1971; Hutton, 1972). 

  

1980: Société de Dévelopment de la Baie-James (SDBJ) completed a geological, 

geochemical and radiometric survey on the area covering the Assinica, Woollet, Fromenteau, 

Eble, Corvette and Juilly projects (Betit, 1980). 

 

1992 to 1997: Placer Dome Inc. completed an exploration campaign on the Frotet Lake area 

in 1992 to 1993 (Panneton et al., 1993) and three drill holes in 1996. 

 

Noranda Mines and Exploration Inc. completed a geophysical survey on the Tortigny project 

(Boileau, & Lortie, 1994) and three drill holes on the Chaloneau showing (Dessureault, 

1997). 

 

1995 to 1997: MSV Resources Inc. and Noranda Mines and Exploration Inc. undertook a 

geological survey, a petrography & geochemistry study of the host rocks and a ground 

magnetic survey of the Tortigny mineralized zones and extensions (Girrard, 1995; 

Dessureault, et al., 1998).  Forty-one drill holes were drilled on the Tortigny VMS deposit 

(Deassureault, et al., 1995).  A total of historical inferred resources was estimated at 428,310 

tons grading 2.43% Cu, 7.02% Zn, 65.82 g/t Ag, 0.33 g/t Au and 0.29% Pb from a sectional 

model (Geostat, 1997).  The resource estimate is not NI 43-101 compliant. 

 

1999: Inco finished a stripping and mapping campaign on the Monique property, located east 

of Tortigny (Girard, 1999). 

 

2003: Noranda and Beaufield surveyed the entire Troilus-Frotet belt using MegaTEM II, 

flown by Fugro Airborne surveys (now CGG).  A total of 11,562 line-km were surveyed.  

Subsequent ground exploration focused on areas of interest identified by the survey. 

 

2004 to 2005: Falconbridge conducted prospecting, geological assessment, helicopter VTEM 

survey, borehole EM survey, ground-based MaxMin survey, basal till sampling, trenching 

and blasting, ground-based DEEPEM surveys and 22 diamond drill holes.  The work was 



 
 

 35 

located on several areas, Tortigny, Chalonneau Boulder, Monique, Inco Boulder, Lenmac, 

Lac Diléo, Lac Moléon and the Lessard SW areas (Chinn, et al., 2006). 

 

2006: Beaufield paid for a geophysical VTEM and BHEM surveys which were conducted by 

Falconbridge JV Ltd.  The VTEM survey was carried out on nine grids and five diamond 

drill holes (with a BHEM survey inside two of them) across the Troilus-Beaufield Project 

(Chinn and Corrivaux, 2006). 

 

2008: Beaufield drilled eight more holes on the Tortigny deposit intersecting 6.02% Cu, 

15.00% Zn, 145.5g/t Ag over 12.55 m in drill hole TO-08-05.  The drilling campaign was 

followed by a ground and borehole infiniTEM survey and a detailed magnetic survey in 

December, 2008. 

 

2008 to 2009: Beaufield conducted a geological survey (outcrop sampling) in October to 

November, 2008 and drilled six additional drill holes in December, 2008 to January, 2009 

(Frappier-Rivard, 2009).  

 

In November 2008, a MaxMin survey (HLEM) was executed on seven grids of the Troilus-

Tortigny Property (Rivest, 2008). 

  

2011: Beaufield carried out three Induced polarization (IP) geophysical surveys and a ground 

magnetic survey over the Troilus-Tortigny Property.  In February, 2011, a total of 16 

chargeability anomalies were interpreted on Grid 1 (Brown and Dubois, 2011).  In February 

and May, 2011 a total of 12 chargeability anomalies were outlined on Grid 2 (Internal 

communication), and a total of five chargeability anomalies were defined on Grid 3 (Internal 

communication). 

 

6.2.2 Baie Moléon Area 
 

The Baie Moléon showing is situated in Moléon Bay of Frotet Lake and is covered by 

Beaufield's Troilus-Tortigny Property.  Therefore, some work mentioned in the Troilus-

Tortigny section applies also to the Baie Moléon area. 

 

1961 to 1962: Falconbridge completed a magnetometer survey, some vertical loop 

electrometric work and 13 drill holes in Baie Moléon (then named the Staunton-Frotet Lake 

property).  The drilling intersected massive sulphides (Poliot, 1961; Charteris and Cronsilver, 

1962; Salt, 1962). 

 

1965: Falconbridge completed three new drill holes and deepened one hole (Cronsilver, 

1965). 

 

1972 to 1974: Selco and Falconbridge performed a geological survey, a magnetic and 

electromagnetic surveys (Hutton, 1972) and 12 drill holes in Lac Moléon (Berezovsky, 

1974). 

 



 
 

 36 

1979 to 1983: The Ministère des Ressources Naturelles du Québec conducted a regional 

mapping and an electromagnetic survey including the Moléon property (DVP-756 and DP-

84-48). 

 

1995: Falconbridge located the old casing left during the 1960s and 1970s drilling campaigns 

and constructed sections covering the entire property (L'Heureux, 1995, internal 

communication).  In addition, it conducted a Pulse-EM survey in four holes (Lambert, 1995). 

 

1996 to 1997: Falconbridge carried out an exploration program including three diamond drill 

holes, a Pulse-EM survey along two drill holes and a MaxMin survey on Frotet Lake.  

Sixteen thin sections were analysed (Chabot, 1997). 

 

6.2.3 Diléo Showing Area 
 

Beaufield's Troilus-Tortigny Property covers some of the Diléo area. 

 

1959: Ranworth Exploration Limited conducted an electromagnetic and magnetic survey on 

the Frotet and Troilus Lakes areas (Liss, 1959). 

 

1962: Mining Corporation of Canada Limited carried out a geological survey (Duquette, 

1962). 

 

1978: Shell Canada Limited performed a geological and geochemical survey on the Frotet-

Troilus area (Castonguay, 1978). 

 

1989: Canadian Patricia Exploration Limited and Mines d'Or Queenston Limitée carried out 

a combined airborne magnetic, electromagnetic and VLF survey on the Diléo Lake property 

(Castonguay, 1978) followed up by a geological survey (Hodgson, 1989). 

 

1993 to 1996: Noranda completed several exploration programs including ground magnetic 

and electromagnetic surveys, mapping and prospection surveys and a 10-hole drilling 

campaign follow-up by borehole geophysics (Pulse-EM Deepem) (Vermette and Bolton, 

1997). 

 

6.3 HISTORICAL PRODUCTION 
 

No historical production has occurred in the area of the Tortigny polymetallic project. 

 

The Troilus open pit mine located 40 kilometres northwest of the Tortigny deposit, was 

operated by Inmet Mining Corporation between 1996 and 2010 and produced 2.1 million 

ounces of gold and 50,000 tonnes of copper.  The mine was acquired by Copper One Inc in 

2014 (Copper One Inc news release, April 8
th

, 2014).  

 



 
 

 37 

6.4 PREVIOUS RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

There have been two previous mineral resource estimates conducted for the Tortigny 

polymetallic project.  The first one was an internal estimate, prepared by Geostat for Noranda 

Exploration Inc. in 1998 (Dessureault, 1998). 

The second mineral resource estimate was prepared after the completion of the 2008 to 2011 

drilling program, carried out by Beaufield.  The report was prepared in compliance with NI 

43-101 by SGS Geostat, part of SGS Canada Inc. (Thibert and Rousseau, 2013).  This 

estimate has been superseded by the one presented in this report.   

 

 

 



 
 

 38 

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 

The following section regarding the regional geology was primarily derived from Noranda's 

1998 Report (Dessureault, 1998) and the SGS 2013 technical report (Thilbert and Rousseau, 

2013) and updated where applicable. 

 

The Troilus-Tortigny Property, located in the Superior Province, lies within the eastern part 

of the Opatica subprovince, in the Frotet-Evans greenstone belt (Figure 7.1).  The greenstone 

belt is a thin allochthonous east-west trending band of metavolcanic and metasedimentary 

rocks.  The area is bounded to the north, south and east by large tonalitic batholiths.  The belt 

extends some 250 km from Lac Mistassini to the Nottaway River and is divided in four 

segments: 1) Evans-Ouagama, 2) Storm-Evans, 3) Assinica and 4) Frotet-Troilus.  It is 

composed of two Archean volcanic complexes separated by a sedimentary basin.  The area 

covered by this report corresponds to the western part of the Frotet-Evans Greenstone Belt, 

the Frotet-Troilus volcanic complex.  It is divided into four structural and lithostratigraphic 

domains cycles that are separated by major faults or volcanic cycles.

 39 

The first cycle is found in the De Maurès, La Fourche and Dompierre Formations.  It consists 

mostly of tholeiitic basalt, more or less magnesian at the base.  The top members of the 

formation are composed of ferrotholeites.  The VMS occurrences found in these formations 

are rich in pyrite and pyrrhotite and are usually associated with sediments and/or pyroclastic 

horizons.  

 

The second cycle corresponds to the pyroclastic calc-alkaline units of the Odon and Frotet 

Formations.  The rocks are represented by block, lapilli or crystal tuffs, associated with 

minor slivers of fine grained sediments and felsic to intermediate volcanics. 

 

The third cycle is described as the transition between the volcanic and the sedimentary zones, 

and is represented by the Châtillon, Parker, Domergue-Sud and Misière Formations.  

Komatiitic basalts with micro-spinifex, variolitic, massive and pillowed basalt characterize 

the Châtillon Formation.  Minor bands of tuff (ash and lapilli) and sediments (mudstone) can 

also be found in this formation.  The Parker Formation corresponds to gabbros with basalts 

and/or andesites associated with volcaniclastic horizons.  Garnets are common in the superior 

members of this formation.  The Domergue-Sud Formation consists of magnesian basalt 

(Simard, 1987).  Finally the Misière Formation is formed essentially by pillowed basalt. 

 

The fourth cycle is dominated by the Domergue-Nord Complex, composed of magnesian 

basalts associated with some layers of sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks.  

 

The volcano-sedimentary assemblages are metamorphosed to greenschist facies in the center 

of the belt.  The metamorphic grade rises to upper amphibolite facies close to the contact 

with the Opatica gneiss.  Several intrusive rocks occur in the area with composition varying 

from tonalitic to ultramafic.  The most important intrusions are the North Troilus Lake 

pluton, the Parker Lake pluton and the Domergue pluton. 

 

7.2 TORTIGNY PROJECT GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.2.1 Stratigraphy 
 

Dessureault (1998) summarized the lithologies which comprise the Tortigny project.  These 

lithologies occur in two distinctive domains, the Châtillon Formation (Phase 3) to the North 

and the Frotet Formation (Phase 2) in the South, separated by east-southeast-trending 

regional faults.  Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3 illustrate the local geology of the Tortigny 

polymetallic mineralized zone and surrounding area. 

 

The Châtillon Formation mainly includes massive flows of magnesian basalts with one thin 

intercalated felsic tuff and sedimentary horizon.  Thick sequences of massive flows of 

tholeiitic basalts, the "basalts sub-group 1" (MAF1 unit in the 3D model) is apparently 

overlain by massive to pillowed flows of tholeiitic to transitional basalts known as "basalts 

sub-group 2" (MAF2 in the 3D model).  The two subgroups are distinguished mainly on the

diagrams.  "Basalts sub-group 2" (MAF2) shows a clear enrichment in Ti, Y and Zr, which is 

typical during magmatic differentiation.   

The sedimentary package that hosts the Tortigny polymetallic mineralization is a continuous, 

highly deformed black argillite and siltstones horizon (SED unit in 3D model) (Figure 7.2).  

The sedimentary unit lies on the contact between the "sub-group 1 basalt" (MAF1) and "sub-

group 2 basalt" (MAF2) mafic volcanics.

The geochemical analyses and the K2O/Na2O ratio diagrams have shown that only few 

samples are affected by Na depletion and/or sericitization but some of those showing the 

highest degree of alteration are located within the "sub-group 1 basalts", just below the 

Tortigny polymetallic mineralized zone.  Some Fe-Ti gabbros have been observed in the 

eastern portion of the property.  They are mainly composed of medium to coarse grained 

amphiboles and plagioclase with up to 15% pyrrhotite, giving a strong magnetic signature.   

 

The Frotet Formation, directly south of the La Fourche fault, comprises a sequence of ash, 

lapilli, block and plagioclase/quartz crystal tuffs as well as minor lava flows.  The 

composition is dacitic, transitional to calc-alkaline basaltic.  Some sulphide mineralization 

has been observed in the tuffs but without significant gold values.   

 

Finally, the Lac Châtillon granodiorite intrusion is present on the northeast portion of the 

property.  It has been interpreted as a late to post-tectonic intrusion. 

The excavated area over the Tortigny mineralized zone has exposed a discontinuous series of 

sphalerite- and chalcopyrite-rich sulfide layers within a tightly folded sedimentary horizon 

(Figure 7.3).  The sediments are graphitic shales, siltstones and mica-andalusite schists, of 

presumed volcanodetrital origin at the contact between the underlying sub-group 1 tholeiitic 

basalts (MAF1) and the overlying sub-group 2 tholeiitic to transitional basalts (MAF2).  

Small lenses of whitish quartzofeldspathic material have been observed at the base of the 

siltstones or forming decimetre- to metre-scale horizons in the upper portion of the 

sedimentary package, in close association with the sulphides.  The nature and the protolith of 

this facies are unknown but it is locally brecciated and shows some textural characteristics of 

a tuffite.   

Massive sulphides have been exposed during the stripping/trenching.  They form a 

discontinuous horizon systematically located in the upper portion of the sedimentary 

package, associated with the mica schists, tuffites as well as the crystal tuffs.  They are also 

found within a few meters of the contact with the overlying sub-group 2 tholeiitic to 

transitional basalts.   

 

Drilling has shown that the mineralization extends from the surface to a depth of 300 m 

below surface in a characteristic V shape.  Most of the mineralization is confined to the fold 

hinge and the southern limb of the fold structure.   

 

7.2.2 Geological Structures 
 

Two phases of deformation have been recognized on the property.  The first phase, D1, is the 

most important for the polymetallic mineralization and is associated with north verging, 

ENE-WSW to east-west isoclinal folds.  In the sediments it is characterized by a penetrative 

sub-vertical E-W schistosity and in the basalts by various shear zones.   

 

The second phase of deformation (D2) has affected D1 and is mainly characterized by the 

development of a crenulation cleavage on the S1 surface.

7.2.2.1 Tortigny Fold Geometry 
 

Both bedding (S0) and an axial planar cleavage (S1) were observed at the main Tortigny 

trench (Figure 7.4).  S0 and S1 are generally sub‐parallel on fold limbs and thus can be 
difficult to distinguish.  An oblique relationship between S0 and S1 can be observed in fold 

hinges.  The mean S0 orientation, based on the available data is 106/84.  Poles to S0 define a 

weak girdle (consistent with folding) with a beta axis (proxy for fold axis) of 268/70 (Figure 

7.5).

Trench

Orientation data from meso‐scale folds collected at the main Tortigny trench suggests that 
the F1 fold hinges on the property are highly non‐cylindrical (doubly‐plunging hinge) (see 
Figure 7.4).  The mean fold axis plunge (F1) is 260/50, but the data shows a spread of 50

o
 to 

60° in the magnitude of plunge (Figure 7.5).

A long section (Figure 7.6), parallel to the hinge of the Tortigny synform, also demonstrates 

that the lower and upper contacts of the metasedimentary unit (SED unit) are highly variable 

along the fold trend, consistent with a non‐cylindrical fold axis.

Section prepared by S. Kruse, data provided by Beaufield, dated November 2013. 

 

Three dimensional modeling of the metasedimentary unit suggests that the overall plunge of 

the Tortigny synform is 40° to 50°.  This modeled plunge is lower‐angle than is predicted by 
the fabric data (50

o
 to 70°).  The discrepancy is likely due to the non‐cylindricity of the fold 

axis and bias introduced by the limited outcrop.  The axial surface of the fold is sub‐vertical 
(see Figure 7.5) or steeply south‐dipping (based on modeling), and the south limb is slightly 
thickened relative to the north limb.  The fold profile is characterized by a significantly 



 
 

 47 

thickened hinge zone and slight chevron geometry.  The regional magnetic pattern suggest 

that the folds in this belt commonly have "S" asymmetry.  A clear, unambiguous synformal 

fold hinge was not observed in outcrop, but the limb orientations, fabric data and down-hole 

data are all consistent with the WSW‐plunging synform model. 
 

Hole TO-10-19 was drilled to test the continuity of the mineralization and was drilled sub-

parallel to the Tortigny mineralized zone.  Inspection of the core from hole TO‐10‐19 (Figure 
7.7) demonstrated that bedding was intersected at a low‐angle to core axis and this is 
consistent with the predicted angular relationship of a hole drilled sub‐parallel to the hinge of 
the fold.

One key implication of the non‐cylindrical fold axis, is that the ground immediately ENE of 
the fold hinge (up‐plunge direction) at surface, may have exploration potential.  Isolated 
lenses of mineralized metasediments, may be preserved in the troughs or "keels" of doubly‐
plunging synformal segments. 

 

7.3 MINERALIZATION 

The following section regarding the polymetallic mineralization was derived from SGS 

Mineral Services mineralogical report (SGS, 2013). 



 
 

 48 

 

The Zn-Cu-Ag-Pb mineralization consists of semi-massive to massive lenses located within a 

sequence of graphitic sediments, namely argillite, siltstone, greywacke and felsic tuffs, 

interlayered between two distinct basaltic units (MAF1 and MAF2) of tholeiitic to 

transitional composition.  The mineralized zones are generally located near the contact 

between the graphitic black argillites and the mafic volcanics.  The absence of pyrite 

combined with the unusual mineralogical association of sphalerite and pyrrhotite (they do not 

precipitate at the same temperature) suggest a remobilization of the sulfides during 

metamorphism. 

The sulphide horizons tend to appear as a series of high grade lenses forming mounds of 

semi-massive to massive sulphides enclosed within a thinner horizon of disseminated 

sulphides of some lateral extent.  The mounds show a complex and zoned internal 

stratigraphy, composed of a metre-scale sphalerite rich lenses enclosed within a pyrrhotite-

chalcopyrite sulfide assemblage forming a continuous horizon extending laterally.  Silicified 

material, invaded by a stockwork of quartz + sulphide veinlets, generally separates the 

sphalerite-rich lenses from the pyrrhotite + chalcopyrite horizon.  Some fragments of 

sphalerite have been locally observed within the schists. 

 

The mineralogical examination of five samples carried out with optical mineralogy, SEM-

EDS and QEMSCAN
TM

 (SGS Mineral Services, Lakefield, 2011), shows that the main base 

metal sulphides include sphalerite, chalcopyrite and iron sulphides, mainly pyrrhotite.  Less 

commonly, pyrite can be abundant locally, but is not present everywhere.  Minor galena and 

traces of argentite have been observed.  Both compositional layering (layers of different 

sulphides) and locally grain size layering (layers of similar composition but different grain 

size) have been observed (see Figure 7.8). 

 

Pyrrhotite occurs as coarse-grained aggregates exhibiting a granoblastic texture.  Sphalerite is 

associated with pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite.  SEM-EDS analysis shows that sphalerite 

contains significant iron in its structure.  Pyrite occurs as euhedral small grain-sized crystals 

within the mainly silicates (quartz, feldspar and micas) gangue forming the matrix for the 

sulphides.  Pyrite is rarely directly associated with the other forms of sulphides.  The 

sulphides exhibit both straight and curvilinear, but sharp, grain boundaries with each other, 

with minimum interpenetration in both types of samples.  Disseminated sulphides occur as 

inclusions in silicates (locally crystallographically controlled) and as complex particles 

primarily because of the fine-grained intergrowths with silicates.  The sulphides exhibit 

straight and curvilinear, but sharp, grain boundaries with minimum interpenetration.

SEM-EDS analysis identified a number of silver species, and also bismuth and a Co-Sb- 

sulphide, likely costibite (CoSbS).  The main silver mineral is argentite (Ag2S), which occurs 

as inclusions and in veinlets cross-cutting the zinc, lead and copper sulphides.  Tentatively 

identified native silver, AgSnS, AgTe, Ag-(Au) alloys are also present.  Some of the silver 

minerals are very fine-grained and difficult to quantify as to their composition.  Silver 

minerals are fine-grained, typically <20 μm and rarely up to <100 μm.  They occur as 

inclusions and veinlets cross-cutting pyrrhotite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite (See Figure 7.9). 

 

A stockwork of sulphide and quartz veins is generally present with the massive sulphide 

lenses.  Disseminated sulphides are also present within the graphitic argillites forming 

millimetre-scale lenses stretched within the regional foliation.  The sulphides (less than 5% 

modal composition) are generally composed of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite with occasional 



 
 

 50 

cubes of pyrite.  Finally, traces of sulphides can be found as fracture filling, remobilized 

within sheared zones parallel to the predominant foliation.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

The Tortigny polymetallic mineralization is sediment-hosted, stratabound and interpreted to 

be within the volcano-detrital Testard Member of the andesitic Châtillon Formation.  The 

sulphide mounds and horizons appear to occupy a specific stratigraphic level within the 

sedimentary package.  The Testard Member coincides with the end of a volcanic cycle, in 

close contact with the base of the overlying Mesiere Formation, representing the beginning of 

another volcanic cycle.  Most of the gold and base metal occurrences and showings within 

the Troilus-Frotet greenstone belt are reported to be located at this stratigraphic level.   

 

The sediments are graphitic shale and siltstone, of presumed volcano-detrital origin.  Layers 

of andesitic crystal tuffs and immature greywacke were noticed.  The metasediments consists 

of quartz, muscovite and andalusite and show no evidence of significant premetamorphic 

alteration.  Most VMS deposits, like those at Noranda or Matagami, are commonly 

associated with well-defined hydrothermal alteration halos.  The alteration at Tortigny is not 

very well developed or continuous.  Thus, the system is interpreted as a distal resedimented 

facies, possibly a turbiditic flow, such that the associated hydrothermal system would be 

located some distance from the current depositional location.   

 

The geometry of the deposit outlined by the sulphide lenses and mounds would represent 

erosional channels formed by turbiditic flows.  Brecciated sulphide horizons could represent 

debris flows.  The observed stockwork associated with the sulphide mounds is interpreted at 

a product of sulfide remobilization. 

 

The exploration programs at the Tortigny Project are planned and executed on the basis of 

the deposit model discussed above.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 

The following summarizes most of the surface exploration work that led to the discovery and 

outlining of the Tortigny deposit by Noranda as well as the follow-up surface exploration 

conducted by Beaufield.   

 

9.1 NORANDA 
 

Exploration programs conducted by Noranda between 1994 and 1997 consisted of stripping, 

detailed and regional mapping, lithogeochemical rock sampling and ground geophysics. 

 

Five areas over the Tortigny Showing were stripped, exposing a discontinuous massive 

sulfide horizon rich in sphalerite and chalcopyrite over several hundred meters.  Detailed 

geological mapping (scale 1:100) over the stripped areas outlined the mineralization-hosting 

sedimentary unit located at the contact between two geochemically distinctive basalt units, 

the extent of the mineralization and the structural complexity.  192 channel samples totaling 

177 m of sampling were assayed for base metal content to outline the mineralized horizon.  

Regional mapping (scale 1:1,000), combined with lithogeochemical sampling of over 250 

samples, allowed for the recognition of the prospective sedimentary horizon's regional extent 

and the recognition of the different stratigraphic units around the deposit area. 

 

Ground geophysics surveys, consisting of combined Magnetics and HEM, were completed 

over north-south -oriented grid lines with stations spaced at 25 m on lines 100 m apart.  A 

total of 24.3 line-km of magnetic survey and 52.9 line-km of HEM survey were completed.  

Additionally, 2 Pulse-EM DeepEM profiles totaling 0.8 line-km were completed and 11 

holes totaling 5,153 m were surveyed by Pulse-EM.   

 

9.2 BEAUFIELD RESOURCES 
 

In 2004 Beaufield entered into an option agreement with Noranda to earn a 50% interest in 

all of the Noranda's properties in the Troilus belt, Quebec.  In 2007 Beaufield acquired an 

additional 14 claims, located southeast of the Tortigny deposit, known as the "Baie Moleon 

claims", which are now part of the Main block.  Noranda and its successors Falconbridge 

Limited and Xstrata Canada Corporation remained the operator of the project and Beaufield 

earned its 50% interest with the total work expenditure of $2.2 million.  The property 

acquisition was completed in November 2007.  Since 2008, Beaufield's exploration, 

conducted in the vicinity of the Tortigny mineralized zone, consisted of geological 

reconnaissance mapping, airborne and ground geophysics, a geochemical soil sampling 

program and diamond drilling.  

 

9.2.1 Reconnaissance and Mapping 
 

Reconnaissance work focused mainly on locating historical work areas such as trenches, 

channel samples and drill hole collars located in the vicinity of the Tortigny polymetallic 



 
 

 53 

mineralization and surveying of the collars with a differential GPS unit.  Mapping of the 

main geological formations found in the area was also accomplished. 

 

9.2.2 Airborne Geophysics 
 

An airborne gravity gradiometer survey was flown over the Tortigny area in the fall of 2010.  

The objective was to delineate potential VMS host rocks from known barren formations in 

the area based on their relative densities.  Although the survey did identify interesting gravity 

anomalies, the new technology was unable differentiate the potential VMS-bearing 

sedimentary units from the local basalts.  

 

In the fall of 2012, a HeliTEM survey was flown over the Tortigny deposit area to check for 

potential conductive anomalies having similar geophysical signatures to that of the VMS 

deposit.  A follow-up exploration program is set to begin in 2014. 

 

9.2.2.1 Regional Structural Targets 
 

The regional geophysical data sets (Mag, EM) were briefly examined for structural 

interpretation and targeting purposes by Dr. Kruse.  Given the well‐established role of fold‐
hinge thickening of mineralized beds at Tortigny, identifying additional fold hinges in pelitic 

metasedimentary units is a high‐priority. 
 

An interpretation of the regional magnetics (First Vertical Derivative) is shown in Figure 9.1.  

A possible corresponding, antiform/synform pair of the Tortigny metasedimentary unit is 

interpreted approximately 1.6 km to the west of the main Tortigny fold.  In addition, a 

prominent conductivity anomaly is located along the interpreted trace of the folds.  This 

interpretation presumes that the nearby prominent WNW–ESE-striking magnetic high 

corresponds with a mafic intrusion and does not represent a stratigraphic unit.  Ground 

confirmation of the WNW–ESE magnetic high is required to test this hypothesis. 

 

Several other possible fold closures are shown in Figure 9.1, which may warrant additional 

ground follow‐up and mapping. 
 

A prominent circular feature is visible in the regional magnetic survey, which corresponds to 

an intrusive body (Stephens, pers. comm.).  Pre‐ or syntectonic, intrusions commonly act as 
semi‐rigid bodies during regional deformation.  Strain may be localized along pluton 
margins, due to competency contrast or pressure‐shadow zones may form adjacent to the 
intrusion.  Both, the pluton margin shear zones and pressure shadows can be favourable 

locations for mineralization and/or re‐mobilization.  The Tortigny zone appears to be located 
within the SW pressure shadow of the intrusion (Figure 9.2).  A second, corresponding 

pressure shadow zone to the NE of the intrusion has been interpreted from the regional 

magnetics and may be prospective as well.

9.2.3 Ground Geophysics  
 

A ground and borehole TDEM InfiniTEM survey which covered a total of 13.7 km at surface 

was carried out in 2008.  Additionally, eight drill holes, totaling 3,225 m, were drilled in 

2008.  Seven conductive anomalies were identified from the ground survey and one 

additional anomaly was identified from the borehole data.  Numerical modelling of the data 

outlined several drill targets which were later tested. 

 

In August, 2010, a 3D Borehole Pulse EM survey was conducted in six holes on the Tortigny 

deposit.  The six holes surveyed totalled 3,640 m.  Many anomalies were detected and 

explained during the 2010 to 2011 drilling program.  

 

In February, 2011, six holes, totalling 988 m were drilled and surveyed with, borehole 

TDEM with the objective of detecting new conductors below the known deposit.  Many in-

hole and off hole anomalies were detected, but none were located below the Tortigny 

mineralized lens.  An IP survey was conducted over a small grid located approximately 1 km 

east of the Tortigny deposit.  Five anomalies were identified for follow-up by surface 

prospecting and/or drilling.  A follow-up drill program revealed the presence of disseminated 

pyrite in strongly silicified volcanics, but no economic mineralization was encountered. 

 

9.2.4 Soil Sampling 
 

A geochemical soil sampling program was completed in 2011 on a small grid located 

approximately 1.5 km NW of the Tortigny deposit.  The grid is underlain by a MegaTEM 

anomaly.  No anomalous geochemical patterns where identified. 

 

9.3 MICON COMMENTS 
 

Micon reviewed the exploration programs conducted by Beaufield during the October, 2013 

site visit.  Surface sampling was conducted during the Noranda exploration programs.  The 

historical channel sampling is in local grid and was followed up by diamond drilling.  The 

results from the channel sampling were not included in the resource estimate, due to 

aboundant assays data from the recent drill programs.   

 

Discussions related to sampling methods, quality of the sampling and relevant information 

regarding location, number, type, nature and spacing or density of the samples collected are 

located in Sections 10, 11 and 12 of this report, and they are discussed in the context of the 

sample preparation methods and data verification for the purpose of the resource estimate.

10.0 DRILLING 
 

A total of 135 diamond drill holes have been drilled on the Tortigny Project for a total of 

34,581 m, of which 52 holes were drilled by Noranda between 1995 and 2005 (See Table 

10.1) and 83 holes were drilled by Beaufield since 2008 (Table 10.2).  The location of the 

drill holes is shown on a drill hole plan (see Figure 10.3). 

 

10.1 NORANDA DRLL PROGRAMS 
 

Noranda drilled 52 holes for a total of 10,052 m on the Tortigny Project area between 1995 

and 1997.  All the holes were located on a local exploration grid.  Most of the holes were 

surveyed and some of them were either probed with borehole Pulse-EM and/or down-hole 

surveyed with a gyroscopic probe (Sperry-Sun) for drill hole trajectory.  Eight additional 

holes, totaling 2,134.6 m (TY-04-43 to TY-05-49) were drilled in 2004 to 2005 by Noranda, 

but only two are within the Tortigny mineralized zone.

An historical inferred resource was estimated at 428,310 tons grading 2.43% Cu, 7.02% Zn, 

65.82 g/t Ag, 0.33 g/t Au and 0.29% Pb from a sectional model (Geostat, 1997).  Those 

resource estimates are not compliant with the reporting requirements of NI 43-101.  A 

qualified person has not completed any work to classify those historical estimates as a current 

mineral resource and the historical estimate should not be relied upon. 

 

10.2 BEAUFIELD DRILLING PROGRAMS AND RESULTS 
 

Beaufield has completed 22,495 m of drilling in 83 drill holes on the Tortigny project (Figure 

10.3 and Table 10.2).  The drill programs carried out in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2013 were 

supervised by Beaufield personnel.  Drilling was conducted by Chibougamau Diamond 

Drilling from Chibougamau, Quebec using NQ equipment, with 60.3 mm diameter rods 

recovering 47.6 mm diameter drill core. 

 

Beaufield's 2008 drilling program was completed between January 16 and February 4, 2008.  

It included eight diamond drill holes, totalling 3,411 m.  All eight holes were drilled at an 

azimuth of 360°N and a dip of -50°.  From January 23 to February 17, 2010, Beaufield 

completed a seven diamond drill hole program totaling 2,472 m.  An additional 2,529 m 



 
 

 59 

drilling in four holes, was completed between July 27 and August 18, 2010.  Finally, 

Beaufield completed 39 holes, totaling 9,746 m between, November 30, 2010 and June 8, 

2011.  The drilling was undertaken on a systematic pattern using mostly vertical holes 

intended to optimally drill what was believed from historical data to be a V-shaped deposit.  

Seven of the 30 holes, totaling 1,647 m, were planned by SGS Canada for data verification 

and were drilled at an azimuth of 180° and a dip of -40
o
 to -60° to crosscut the mineralization 

hosting sedimentary package. 

 

In 2013 the company drilled six holes, totalling 1,509 m, which targeted the deeper, western 

end of the deposit with limited previous drilling and where more geological information is 

required to determine potential extensions of the mineralization.   

 

The 2008 to 2013 drilling programs successfully delineated the geometry of the Tortigny 

mineralization by in-fill drilling in areas drilled by the previous operators and step-out 

drilling in areas with geophysical anomalies.

Data supplied by Beaufield, dated January 2014. 

 

In-fill drilling was completed on a very tight pattern with mostly vertical holes in order to 

define the mineralization's true width and to precisely locate the main fold axis interpreted as 

the most important structure controlling the mineralization.

Drill Hole Collars in the Tortigny Trench 

 

 
Picture taken during the Micon site visit on October 28, 2013. 

 

Collar locations were initially set in the field by a field geologist or technician using a 

conventional hand-held Garmin GPS with alignment of the initial azimuth set by compass.  

Where access was too difficult, particularly in swampy areas, collars were moved from their 

original proposed coordinates by a Beaufield geologist.  The drill rig alignment (dip and 

azimuth) and level were rechecked by a Beaufield geologist/technician.  After completion of 

the hole, the casing was left in the hole, capped and clearly identified.  The location of the 



 
 

 62 

collar was resurveyed using differential GPS and the orientation of the casing using a transit.  

All drill collars on the property were surveyed by Corriveau J.L. & Associés Inc. in the UTM 

NAD83 zone 18 projection system using real time GPS.  These measurements are considered 

final and recorded in the database.  The drill holes drilled by Beaufield have been capped and 

the casing is left above ground. 

 

Drill holes were consistently measured using a FlexIt electronic single-shot and multi-shot 

instrument that provides a reading of azimuth, dip and in-hole magnetic field intensity.  

These tests were conducted 12 to 15 m below the casing and systematically at 100-m 

intervals as the hole progressed.  At the end of the hole, a multi-shot survey was taken to 

survey the entire hole, taking one measurement every 3 m.   

 

Depth markers were inserted every 3 m in wooden core boxes by the drill operators at the 

drill site.  Core was laid down in the wooden core boxes in 3-m runs.  Drill core was 

collected from the drills and delivered to the core shack at the end of each 12-hour shift.  All 

drill core was laid out sequentially and a visual review was conducted by both an 

experienced technician and geologist to determine if boxes were numbered properly; depth 

markers are sequential and consistent with the distance indicated.  After the core was 

realigned it was measured in order to determine the core recovery and rock quality 

designation (RQD).  RQD, defined as the percentage of a given length of core that is 

composed of pieces greater than 10 cm in length (Deere, 1963), is used to determine the 

competency of the rock.  RQD was measured at 3 m intervals on all core and entered into the 

Access database.  Magnetic susceptibility readings were collected systematically on all drill 

holes at 1.5-m intervals on intact cylindrical core with a handheld magnetic susceptibility 

meter (Exploranium KT-9) and recorded in the geological database. 

 

The core shack and core storage are located on the property.  The facilities are located in a 

remote area, accessible only by a logging road and although they are not secured with a fence 

the core storage is practically inaccessible to people that are not involved in the project (see 

Figure 10.2).  

 

For core logging and input of geological information the company geologists use the 

GeoticLog
®
, commercial geological software, produced by Geotic Inc., based in Val d'Or, 

Quebec (www.geotic.ca).  This is a commercial logging software that allows users to enter 

geological descriptions with user-editable dictionaries and allows data to be validated during 

the input, minimizing the need for subsequent corrections and ensuring data quality.  The 

application includes a users' rights management interface to control data access and make 

data secure.  Data is saved in MS Access database format and can be exported as Excel files.

Drill core was logged daily by company geologists and the data was entered into the Access 

database using the GeoticLog application.  The main geological units are based on lithology 

and type of mineralization.  The second-level classification included further details, such as 

lithological or textural variety within the unit, mineralization, intrusive dikes and structures.  

During the logging process, typical data included a full geological description of the 

lithology, including a description of contacts and their relative angles to the core axis.  The 

description of the mineralization included the type and percentage of the mineralization and 

the visible ore minerals.  The database contains tables recording alteration and geological 

structures (shear zone, faults, fractures, foliation, bedding), RQD and down-hole survey data.  

The core recovery was calculated at the time but it is not part of the GeoticLog database.  

Descriptions of the lithologies were converted into a rock code system, respecting the 

existing lithology code system, used in the provincial geological database E-Sigeom 

(http://sigeom.mrn.gouv.qc.ca) by the MNRF.  Table 10.3 is a list of the codes used in the 

drill logs, a short description and their equivalent in the GEMS database. 

 

Data are mainly represented on cross-sections and plotted and interpreted primarily on paper.  

Drill logs are stored in hard copy and digitally in the Access data base at Beaufield's offices 

in Ottawa, Ontario.

The drilling showed that the polymetallic mineralization is present from surface 

(approximately at 400 m elevation) down to the -100m level.  The overburden is from 0.45 to 

32.2 m thick.  Hole TO-10-19 was drilled parallel to the hinge of the fold, following the 

mineralized zone, to verify the continuity and the variability of the deposit between the 

different sections and to provide material for metallurgical studies.  The drill hole went in 

and out of the mineralized zone intersecting 21 high-grade massive sulphide intervals, 

totalling 34% (108.95 m) of the mineralized intersection.  The hole was terminated at 486 m 

in a major N-S fault.  The hole intersected 322.15 m of 4.20% Zn, 2.72% Cu, 0.19% Pb, 

72.02 g/t Ag and 0.53 g/t Au.   

 

While the Tortigny polymetallic zone did not return high grades in all holes, the 

mineralization is always identifiable by anomalous values of Zn, Cu, Ag, Au and Pb.  In this 



 
 

 65 

sense, the continuity of the polymetallic zone is evident and its geometry is straightforward; 

it occurs as a V-shaped synform with an E-W strike direction (260° to 265°), an average 

plunge of -50° to -60° and variable thickness from 0.3 m to 94 m.  The average thickness of 

20.7 m can vary depending on the cut-off grade used, but the boundaries of the Tortigny 

polymetallic zone depend primarily on the extent of the sedimentary unit.  Beaufield has 

drilled along a strike length of approximately 600 m, with the highest density of holes lying 

within a 300-m stretch.  The collars and the drill hole traces with the lithology are shown on 

Figure 10.3. 

 

The Tortigny area generally lies in a VMS setting with many of the holes showing the 

occurrence of massive to semi-massive sulphides in the hinge of the sedimentary unit.  In 

addition to the Tortigny main polymetallic zone, which was intersected in the metasediments, 

the holes intersected other, likely parallel lenses, under the main lens that returned good zinc, 

copper, gold, and silver grades.  Additional drilling is needed to outline and characterize 

these zones.  Table 10.4 shows the most significant results obtained by Beaufield since 2008, 

published by the company in news releases.

With regard to the significant assay intervals for the drilling stated in Table 10.4, the true 

width of the mineralization is not mentioned, because it depends on the cut-off grade for 

copper equivalent CuEq (%) or zinc equivalent, ZnEq (%), and the orientation of the 

mineralization.  It appears that most of the mineralization occurs as a chute that has a greater 

continuity in the down-dip or down-plunge direction.  The pinch and swell nature of the 

mineralization explained the varying widths in closely spaced drill holes.   

 

For exploration purposes Beaufield has established the use of a zinc equivalent (ZnEq%) 

value in order to obtain a simple value to quantify a mineralized interval (Table 10.2).  The 

formula used by Beaufield is as follows: 

 

Zn Eq (%)= 

    Zn% * Zn_recov * Zn_price/Zn_price 

 +Cu% * Cu_recov * Cu_price * (Cu_price/Zn_price) 

 +Ag_g/t * Ag_recov * Ag_price * (0.03215*Ag_price)/(22.04 * Zn_price) 

 +Au_g/t * Au_recov * Au_price * (0.03215*Au_price)/(22.04*Zn_price) 

 

The formula first transforms all metal values (% Zn, % Cu, Ag g/t and Au g/t) into US dollar 

values.  Secondly, it transforms the dollar value in percentage of zinc by dividing the gross 

value of the interval by the price of Zn.  The third operation is to multiply the result for gold 

and silver by a conversion factor of 0.03215 to obtain the result for Zn equivalent in grams.  

The price of the Zn is usually per pound, so the amount of grams is divided by 22.04 and 

multiplied by Zn_price. 

 

The formula takes into account the rate of recovery of the metals during a processing 

operation.  The formula gives an evaluation of the net value of the mineralized interval for a 

given time and is useful in assisting with outlining further exploration programs at that time. 

 

In order to calculate the copper equivalent grades for the resource estimate Micon used the 3-

year average metal prices for copper and zinc published by Metal Bulletin.  The prices for 

gold and silver are the long term metal prices, projected by Energy and Metals Consensus 

Forecast in December, 2013. 

 

 Cu US$3.18/lb. 

 Zn US$0.95/lb. 

 Ag US$22.5/oz. 

 Au US$1,400/oz. 
 

10.3 MICON COMMENTS 
 

Micon has reviewed Beaufield's drilling program on the Tortigny Project and believes that 

the program was conducted using the best practice guidelines outlined by the CIM.  The 

exploration program was conducted such that the results can be used as the basis upon which 

to conduct further exploration programs or other studies that will identify the full extent and 

tenor of the mineralization located upon the Tortigny Property. 



 
 

 72 

 

The core recovery was better than 95% in the core reviewed by Micon during the site visit.  

Historical core recovery is unknown but should be similar based upon the experience with 

the Beaufield core.  Based upon its review of the data and the site visit, Micon does not 

believe that there are any factors that would materially impact the accuracy and reliability of 

the exploration results.  Therefore, the exploration results can be used to conduct a mineral 

resource estimate on the Tortigny Project. 

 

Micon notes that using current metal prices for Beaufield's zinc equivalent calculation during 

the exploration was very useful for conducting the exploration programs.  Micon used 

longer-term metal prices for calculating copper equivalents (CuEq%) when estimating the 

mineral resources for the Tortigny Project.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION 
 

For Beaufield's drilling programs (2008 to 2013), cores boxes were delivered to the core 

shack at the end of the shift by the drilling contractor.  Core boxes were opened at the core 

shack and labelled according to hole number and depth of the interval in the box (for 

example, TO-08-01, 141.0 to 145.5 m).  The core was then logged by the geologist who 

outlined intervals with massive or semi-massive sulphides to be sampled with red marker.  

Two sample tags were placed with each sample, one tag in the sample bag and the second 

remaining in the core box to identify the sample location.  Sample information was listed in 

both the sample book and the geologist's log (date and interval sampled). 

 

The geologist decided on the size of the interval based on geological criteria such as 

geological contact, alteration, mineralization, etc.  The minimum sample length was 0.3 m 

for the intervals with massive sulphide mineralization.  Samples were usually 1 m long, and 

the maximum was 1.5 m in zones with sulphide stringers, which was deemed to be the 

maximum width.  A 1-m sample was systematically taken on both sides of a mineralized 

interval to "close" the zone.  Mineralized drill core intervals selected for assay were cut 

lengthwise by a Beaufield technician using a diamond saw.  The country rock adjacent to 

mineralized zones was split in half parallel to the core axis using a splitter.  One half of the 

core was sampled for assay with the remaining of the core left in the core box as a witness 

sample.  Core boxes were properly tagged with aluminum strips with Dymo-embossed hole 

number, intersection and box number. 

 

Selected core intervals for assaying were split into two halves using a core splitter or a rock 

saw.  The core splitter was thoroughly cleaned using fine brushes between every sample to 

avoid contamination.  One half of the interval was placed in a clean plastic sample bag with 

one of the sample tags.  The other half was put back in its original location in the core box 

with the second tag, stapled in the core box at the beginning of the interval to identify the 

sample interval for future reference.  The sample bag was sealed and prepared for shipping to 

the preparation laboratory in Chibougamau, Quebec.   

 

Once all intervals were collected from a core box, it was put on the core rack outside the 

company core storage facility.  Samples were taken to the laboratory at regular intervals 

depending on volume (every week or every few days).  Only company employees or their 

contractors were permitted to handle the samples before reaching the laboratory or the 

shipping company. 

 

All drill core is stored in order on core racks located on the property near the exploration 

camp.  The rejects and pulps are stored in closed plastic bins on the property.  Figure 11.1 is 

a view of the sampled mineralized interval from hole SGS-11-004A.

11.2 ASSAY ANALYSES 
 

11.2.1 Noranda Assay Analyses 
 

During the 1995 to 1997 drilling campaign, a total of 1,028 samples were assayed from the 

44 holes drilled.  Analyses were performed in part by Mineraux Noranda Inc. – Division 

Matagami, but mostly by Chimitec Ltée. in Val d'Or, Quebec.  Base metals (Zn, Cu, Pb) and 

silver were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry following aqua regia digestion (HF-

HNO3-HCLO4-HCL).  Gold was assayed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectrometry 

on a 30 g sample.  Additionally, 109 samples were analyzed for major elements using X-ray 

fluorescence or inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) for the major elements and atomic 

absorption spectrometry for Cu and Zn.  Finally, 90 samples were re-analyzed for major 

elements by ICP.  Specific gravity measurements were done by helium pycnometer on the 

pulverized powder (<200 mesh) at Mineraux Noranda Inc. – Division Matagami analytical 

laboratory. 

 

Noranda QA/QC procedures were not available for review and comment but the analyses 

were performed by industry-known laboratories in those years with internal QA/QC that 

included certified reference material and blanks.  Check sampling was also conducted.  In 



 
 

 75 

1997, assay results were reviewed and used for internal mineral resource estimation by 

Geostat Systems International Inc., a reputable consulting firm. 

 

11.2.2 Beaufield Assay Analyses 
 

A total of 8,625 samples taken from 79 diamond drill holes (20,986 m of drilling) have been 

prepared and assayed during the 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2013 drill programs at the Tortigny 

Project.   

 

From 2008 to 2011, the sample shipping was managed under the supervision of David 

Frappier-Rivard, VP Exploration for Beaufield.  In 2013, Mathieu Stephens, Chief Geologist 

and QP for the company, supervised the drilling and sampling program.  All core samples 

were collected in the field and processed only by Beaufield employees.  Bags were 

transported by pickup truck to Chibougamau and remained sealed until they were opened by 

the staff of Centre d'études Appliquée du Quaternaire (CÉAQ), where the samples were 

weighted, crushed and pulverized.  The pulps were sent by CÉAQ employees to ALS 

Chemex laboratories located in Val d'Or, Québec. 

 

11.2.2.1 Sample Preparation 
 

All samples were prepared at CÉAQ in Chibougamau, Quebec.  This is not a certified 

laboratory but SGS visited the preparation laboratory in 2013 and considered it to be 

adequate for the purpose of this resource estimate.  A flow chart detailing the protocol 

followed for the sample preparation is illustrated in Figure 11.2. 

 

The assay analyses were performed in the ALS Chemex (Val d'Or) Laboratories and the 

duplicates were analyzed at SGS, Mississauga, Ontario.  Both laboratories are commercial 

laboratories, are independent of Beaufield and are accredited and certified to ISO 9001 and 

ISO/IEC 17025 standards.

11.2.2.2 Sample Analysis  
 

For the 2010 to 2011 exploration drill program, core sample analyses were performed by 

ALS Chemex in Val d'Or, Quebec, Canada.  Results are certified by laboratory managers for 

ALS in Vancouver, B.C.  The ALS Chemex, Val d'Or, Quebec analytical facility is 

individually certified to standards within ISO 9001:2008 and has received accreditation to 

ISO/IEC 17025:2005 from the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for Fire Assay gold by 

Atomic Absorption (AA) and gold by gravimetric finish.

All rock samples were analyzed for multi-elements by Aqua Regia-ICP Multi-element 

Method (ME-ICP41) and high grades samples were re-analysed using Aqua Regia Assay 

Grade Multi-element Method (ME-OG46).  All drilling samples were also analyzed by Fire 

Assay-Atomic Absorption Methods (Au-AA23). 

 

Aqua Regia-ICP Multi-element Method (ME-ICP41) is a trace level method using 

conventional ICP-AES analysis.  A prepared sample is digested with aqua regia in a graphite 

heating block.  After cooling, the resulting solution is diluted to 12.5 mL with deionized 

water, mixed and analyzed by ICP-AES.  The analytical results are corrected for inter-

element spectral interferences. 

 

Aqua Regia Assay Grade Multi-element Method (ME-OG46) is used for ore grade elements 

by aqua regia digestion using conventional ICP-AES analysis.  A prepared sample is digested 

in 75% aqua regia (HNO3-HCl) for 120 minutes.  After cooling, the resulting solution is 

diluted to volume (100 mL) with de-ionized water, mixed and then analyzed by ICP-AES or 

by AES. 

 

Fire Assay - Atomic Absorption Methods (Au-AA23) is used for precious metals (gold) 

assays.  A prepared sample is fused with a mixture of lead oxide, sodium carbonate, borax, 

silica and other reagents as required, inquarted with 6 mg of gold-free silver and then 



 
 

 78 

cupelled to yield a precious metal bead.  The bead is digested in 0.5 mL dilute nitric acid in a 

microwave oven, 0.5 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid is then added and the bead is further 

digested in the microwave at a lower power setting.  The digested solution is cooled, diluted 

to a total volume of 4 ml with de-mineralized water, and analyzed by atomic absorption 

spectroscopy against matrix-matched standards. 

 

11.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM 
 

QA/QC data were provided by Beaufield as a separate sheet in the drill hole database. 

 

In 2008, Beaufield started the exploratory drill program without an internal QA/QC protocol.  

The company followed common industry core sampling procedures.  Encouraged by the 

positive results Beaufield has implemented formal analytical quality control procedures since 

2010 by inserting blanks (not certified and certified) and certified reference material (CRM).     

 

Beaufield's QA/QC program, in general, consisted of the insertion of one certified standard 

and one uncertified blank (barren quartz vein) for every 20 to 25 samples.  Duplicate samples 

were also performed but on a non-systematic basis.  To compensate for the lack of CRM and 

blanks in the earlier sampling the company reassayed 25% of the samples from hole TO-08-

01 to TO-10-19 (286 samples) and included one standard and one blank in each batch of 20 

to 25 samples.  A total of 413 control samples, or 5% of the total number of samples assayed 

(8,625 samples + 417 control samples), were compiled by Beaufield as part of its QA/QC 

program.  

 

11.3.1 Certified Reference Material 
 

Systematic insertion of CRMs (or control standards) is used as the primary method of 

controlling the accuracy, bias and precision of the assay results reported from the laboratory.  

They are inserted in the sample stream for assay to identify assay problems with specific 

sample batches and possible long-term biases in the overall dataset.  For the purpose of the 

resource estimate, Micon has defined QA/QC failure as assays for two consecutive CRMs 

outside of the STD ± 2 Std. Dev. and assays for a CRM outside ± 3 Std. Dev.   

 

Beaufield used four different standards for low grade and high grade intervals.  Table 11.1 

summarizes the parameters for the certified material used by Beaufield.  The results from the 

CRM VMS1 (low grade) and VMS4 (high grade) were plotted on graphs and were used to 

control the accuracy, precision, bias of the assay laboratory.  The results are plotted on series 

of graphs for each standard.   

 

Two mislabelled VMS1 standards were identified and corrected.

11.3.1.1 Results for Zinc 
 

Approximately 98.4% (185 out of 188) of the reported results for VMS1 and VMS4 for zinc 

and 100% of the reported results for CDN-ME-17 and MP-1b are within the acceptable limits 

(See Figure 11.3 and Appendix 2).  For the whole drill program more than 99% of the 

returned CRM values are within the acceptable range.

Figure prepared by Micon, January, 2014. 
 

11.3.1.2 Results for Silver 
 

Approximately 95% of the reported results for the CRM for silver are within the acceptable 

limits (See Figure 11.4 and Appendix 2).  VMS1 has one failure for silver, but VMS4 

standard returned 11 out of 60 failed standards.  This result provoked a further investigation 

into the VMS4 standard.  The detailed QA/QC study conducted by SGS Canada (2011) 

revealed that this standard has very inconsistent values.  Due to the high failure rate, 

Beaufield decided to change the CRM and 100% of the reported results for the new standards 



 
 

 81 

CDN-ME-17 and MP-1b are within the acceptable limits.  Micon considers the assay results 

as acceptable for resource estimation.

Figure prepared by Micon, January, 2014. 
 

11.3.1.3 Results for Copper 
 

The performance of the VMS1 and VMS4 standards for copper was similar to the 

performance for silver (See Figure 11.5 and Appendix 2).  The VMS1 standard has seven 

failures and almost half of the VMS4 samples did not pass the QA/QC test.  In 2013, 

Beaufield realized that the VMS1 and VMS 4 CRMs return inconsistent values and the 

company stopped using them and purchased CDN-ME-17 and MP-1b.  In order to verify the 

results from the 2008 to 2010 drill program the company reassayed every fourth sample from 

hole TO-08-01 to TO-10-19.  The new standards were inserted in the sample stream and all 

returned values for copper for CDN-ME-17 and MP-1b that are within acceptable limits.  

Because the results from the reassays are close to the original results, Micon considers the 

original assay results as acceptable for resource estimation.

11.3.2 Blanks 
 

Blank material is submitted with samples to the laboratory to monitor possible contamination 

or sample cross-contamination caused when crushing or pulverizing equipment is not cleaned 

properly after mineralized samples are processed.  The company purchased non-certified 

"Blank Material" from CÉAQ, Chibougamau.  CÉAQ analysed five pieces from one bag of 

the barren quartzite, used as a blank material and the returned values were below the 

detection limit or more than five times below the minimum economic value, so Beaufield 

decided to use the blank material (barren quartzite) from CÉAQ for its QA/QC monitoring.  

During the site visit Micon assayed one blank and the results showed elevated Zn values, but 

still more than 1/2 times below the potential economic value.   

 

A total of 141 blanks (125 non-certified and 16 certified) were inserted in the sample series 

sent to ALS Chemex. 

 



 
 

 84 

SGS (Thibert and Rousseau, 2013) conducted a very detailed study of the results from the 

QA/QC program in 2010 and 2011.  After an in depth analyses of the cut-off value in  

mineralized sections and comparisons with the average value and the nominal value for zinc, 

silver, copper and gold, in the blanks, Thibert and Rousseau (2013) established the following 

"defect threshold concentrations" for blanks as follows: 

 

 0.05% (500 ppm) for Zn, which is considered to be respectively 1/10 of the economic 

cut-off value for this type of deposit. 

 

 0.05% (500 ppm) for Cu, which is considered to be respectively 1/5 of the economic 

cut-off values for this type of deposit. 

 

 1 ppm (1 g/t) for Ag which is 5 times the detection limit of 0.2 ppm. 

 

 0.02 g/t for Au, which is at least 1/5 of the economic cut-off values. 
 

The QA/QC analyses for zinc revealed that 132 out of 141 submitted blanks (95%) assayed 

less than 500 ppm (0.05%), but nine were above.  The failed blanks are still at least 1/5 of the 

cut-off grade for the mineralized zone, but they are an indication of possible contamination in 

the preparation laboratory.  Only two of the 141 (0.14%) submitted blanks assayed above 

SGS Geostat set threshold for silver. 

 

Only three of the 141 submitted blanks (2%) assayed above the SGS Geostat set threshold for 

silver that is 1 g/t.  

 

Finally, three of the 141 blanks were above SGS Geostat set threshold for gold that is 0.02g/t 

Au.  The results are plotted on QA/QC graphs (see Figure 11.7). 

 

The coincident above-threshold values for zinc copper and silver occur on certificate dates 

2011-01-18, 2011-03-08, and 2011-08-09.  Beaufield has informed the laboratory but no 

corrective actions were taken to address the issue.  In 2013, Beaufield purchased certified 

blanks and required the re-run of the assays for batches with blanks above the acceptable 

limits for the analyses conducted in 2013 to 2014.  However, it was difficult to recover the 

rejects for some of the batches with failed blanks from 2008 and 2009, but this is a small 

percentage of the samples and it will not affect the reliability of the assay results, used for the 

resource estimate.

11.3.3 Issues with the Certified Reference Material  
 

Beaufield purchased the VMS1 and VMS4 standards from Accurassay Laboratories Ltd., a 

certified commercial laboratory, but the detailed QA/QC analyses conducted by SGS and 

Micon revealed that the use of VMS1 and VMS4 are not always consistent and have some 

limitations for controlling assay quality.  An analysis of the round robin results, published in 

the Accurassay's standard certificates, has highlighted either inconsistencies between the 

laboratory data sets, or discrepancy in the nominal value.  The results for the VMS1 and 

VMS4 CRMs are summarized and plotted in a series of graphs in the standard certificates. 

 



 
 

 86 

Figure 11.8   

Round Robin Results for VMS1 and VMS4

Results for silver in VMS4 reported systematically low results for all sample sets, probably 

suggesting a discrepancy in the nominal value.  For copper and lead, results indicate some 

inconsistencies between the laboratory data sets suggesting the nominal values may be 

inaccurate.  For zinc, VMS4 returned high values for all sample sets suggesting a discrepancy 

in the nominal value.   

 



 
 

 87 

In order to correct the previous QA/QC issues, Beaufield reassayed 25% (286 samples) of the 

samples from holes TO-08-01 to TO-08-19, using the new CRMs, CDN-ME-17 and ME-1b.  

All returned assay values for Zn, Cu, Ag and Au from the blanks inserted during the 

resampling program are below the acceptable threshold.  The results of the core and reject 

duplicates are very close (within ±15%) and Beaufield did not reassay the rest of the samples. 

 

11.3.4 Core Duplicates 
 

The purpose of analyzing the second half of the drill core is to provide an understanding of 

variability introduced by selecting one half of the drill core versus the other and to determine 

possible sampling bias.  The industry standard is that suggested level of accuracy for the core 

duplicates is 20% for drilling projects at the prefeasibility to feasibility level (Long, 2005). 

 

In 2011, Thilbert and Rousseau (SGS, 2013) completed a first independent analytical check 

on drill core duplicate samples, taken from selected holes in the Beaufield 2010 to 2011 

diamond drill program.  A total of 50 core duplicates (1/4 core) have been collected from 

DDH TO-08-01 to TO-11-29.  All samples were submitted for Zn, Cu, Pb, Ag and Au 

analysis at SGS laboratory in Toronto, Ontario and analysed using fire assay with ICP finish 

(30 g) for gold, three acid digestion for silver with AAS finish and aqua regia digestion with 

ICP finish for Cu, Zn and Pb.  The results were plotted on correlation plots (See Figure 11.9).

The statistical analyses showed that SGS results for the duplicate core samples (¼ core) are 

lower than the ALS Chemex results for the original (½ core) samples.  The relative 

percentage difference between the core duplicates and the original samples varies on average 

between 16% for Cu up to 43% for Au.  The discrepancy could be a result of using a ¼ core 

versus ½ core. 

 

In 2013, in addition to the core duplicates that were taken since the implementing of the 

QAQC protocol, Beaufield took an additional 84 core duplicates from the intervals without 

CRMs.  New standards were inserted in the sample batches.  The objective was to compare 

the new results with the original results and accept or reject the assay results received in 2008 

to 2010 without internal QA/QC monitoring.  The results for the duplicates are summarized 

and plotted in series of graphs (see Figure 11.10).

Plots for Reassayed Core and Reject Duplicates

All copper values for the core duplicates, 99% of the silver values, and 98% of the zinc 

values, reproduce within ± 20% for Zn, Cu, and Ag.  Reproducibility for gold is more erratic, 

as expected, because of the nature of the gold mineralization and possible nugget effect.  The 

results of analysis for Zn, Cu, Pb, Ag and Au show that the original 84 samples and the 

duplicates are not significantly different and the biggest discrepancy is closer to the detection 

limits.  The evaluation of the core duplicates showed that there is no systematic bias.  

 

11.3.5 Rejects Duplicates 
 

Beaufield had an extensive check sample analyses program for the Tortigny 2008-2013 

drilling samples.  The objective is to determine if splitting procedures during the sample 

preparation in the CÉAQ laboratory are well established and that sampling errors are kept to 

a minimum.  The industry standard is that suggested level of accuracy for the reject 

duplicates is 15% for drilling projects at the prefeasibility to feasibility study level (Long, 

2005). 

 

In 2011, SGS Canada conducted independent analytical check of the preparation duplicates.  

A total of 105 preparation duplicates were from the preparation laboratory of CÉAQ in 

Chibougamau to SGS laboratory in Toronto, Ontario.  Preparation duplicates were selected 

from five different holes, namely TO-10-21, TO-10-27, TO-11-33, TO-11-41 and TO-11-43.  

The reject samples were analysed using fire assay with ICP finish (30 g) for gold, three acid 

digestion for silver with AAS finish and aqua regia digestion with ICP finish for copper, zinc 

and lead.  The results were plotted on correlation plots (See Figure 11.11).

In 2013, 203 reject duplicates are taken from the crushed material as a second cut and is 

prepared in a similar manner as the original pulp.  Between 99% and 100% of the reject 

duplicates reproduce within ±15% for Cu, Zn, Au and Ag.  Ag values are very close to the 

original analysis for values below 100 ppm and the duplicates values are systematically 

higher above 100 ppm.  This difference most likely is a result of a difference in analysis 

methodology between the two laboratories.  Again the reproducibility for gold is more erratic 

as expected because of the possible nugget effect.  

 

11.3.6 Pulp Duplicates 
 

Beaufield has reassayed a total of 352 pulp duplicates in SGS laboratory in Toronto, Ontario.  

The pulp duplicates are splits of the unused portion of the original sample pulp, and are used 

to test the accuracy of the initial determination, performed by the original laboratory.  The 

industry standard is that suggested level of accuracy for the pulp duplicates if 5% for drilling 

projects at the prefeasibility to feasibility study level (Long, 2005).  The pulp duplicates were 

analysed using the same methods: fire assay with ICP finish (30 g) for gold, 3 acid digestion 

for silver with AAS finish and aqua regia digestion with ICP finish for copper, zinc and lead. 

  

In 2011, SGS conducted independent analytical check of the pulp duplicates.  A total of 104 

laboratory pulp duplicates were sent from the ALS laboratory in Val d'Or to SGS laboratory 

in Toronto, Ontario.  Pulp duplicates were selected from the same holes (TO-10-21, TO-10-

27, TO-11-33, TO-11-41 and TO-11-43).  The pulp duplicates were selected to match the 

preparation duplicates.  Correlation plots between the pulp duplicates and original data are 

presented in Figure 11.12.

The extensive statistical analyses conducted by SGS revealed that the values received from 

the pulp duplicates for copper are greater than the original values and the results from the 

pulp for zinc are greater than the original values.  The results for Ag<100ppm are really close 

to the original assay results and the duplicate pulp results for Ag>100ppm are higher than the 

original.  The gold values returned by the pulp duplicates are more erratic. 

 

Following the recommendations of SGS Canada, Beaufield completed a second check 

program in 2012.  The objective was to verify the accuracy of the assay results for the four 

main elements copper, zinc, silver and gold, and eliminate any doubts about the quality of the 

assay result.  It was decided to check the original core assay data analysed by ALS laboratory 

in Val d'Or (Cu%, Zn%, Au g/t and Ag g/t) by randomly selected 300 pulp duplicates within 

the mineralized envelope.  Beaufield's geologist selected 313 pulp duplicates.  Some of the 

values were below the detection limit and results for 248 of them were useable.  Pulps were 

assayed for Cu, Pb, Zn, Au and Ag at SGS Minerals Laboratory in Toronto, Ontario using 

aqua regia digestion followed by ICP, a technique similar to that used by ALS laboratory in 

Val d'Or.  

 

As a result of very detailed QA/QC analyses SGS (Thilbert and Rousseau, 2013) concluded 

that the correlation between duplicated and original pulps is excellent for zinc, copper and 

silver with correlation coefficients above 0.99 (maximum is 1).  Expectedly, the correlation 

for gold is still fairly good with a coefficient of 0.96.  A good correlation means that the high 

and low values from the original dataset are well reproduced by the duplicates.  Correlation 

plots show points well aligned.  However Thilbert and Rousseau (2013) don't consider the 

good correlation between the original results and the duplicates as a proof of unbiased 

results.  For lead, zinc and gold, mean differences between SGS duplicates and ALS originals 

are not significant.  For zinc SGS mean is 0.2% less than ALS means and for gold, SGS 

mean is 0.9% less than ALS means.  Both tests show that the duplicated SGS copper grade is 

lower than the original ALS copper grade of the same pulp.  The SGS average (1.95% Cu) is 

3% lower than the ALS average (2.00% Cu).  Approximately 72% of the points lie slightly 

below the first diagonal.  The copper bias shows up in three of the four sample groups (the 

only exception are K samples).  It also confirms what ALS had recognized in a previous 



 
 

 95 

report that is a high bias (+ 3%) in copper for the Cu-ICP41GEOCHEM method which was 

addressed in June 2011 through the implementation of a new calibration curve.  69% of the 

samples (I, C and numerical prefix series) submitted by Beaufield had already been analyzed 

by June.  Because ±5% accuracy for pulp duplicates is very common in the mining industry 

none of the samples from I, C and numerical prefix series were reassayed.  The K samples 

were assayed after the correction.  The same conclusion applies to silver with SGS duplicates 

about 3.5% less than the ALS originals. 

 

11.3.7 Specific Gravity 
 

The mineralization on the Tortigny Project is represented by semi-massive and massive 

sulphides and specific gravity is an important characteristic that will influence the final 

tonnage of the mineral resource.  Noranda and Beaufield acknowledged the importance of the 

density and tested total of 1789 samples.  Noranda completed 982 tests in the company 

laboratory between 1995 and 1996.  Beaufield conducted 807 specific gravity tests at CÉAQ 

in Chibougamau, Quebec.  The laboratory followed its "Laboratory Materials Testing and 

Handling" Protocol.  A short description of the procedure is provided below. 

 

"Sample preparation ahead of shipping: All samples, marked for SG determinations 

are thoroughly cleaned ahead of shipment.  Any sample considered unsuitable for SG 

determination is set aside and the customer is informed.  All samples are properly 

labelled (hole number, from, to and sample number) and placed in secure and sealed 

packaging ahead of shipment.  Each core sample is stored in a sealed and properly 

labelled (identification number) sample bag.  The samples are dried if needed and 

screened and/or cleaned by compressed air to remove fine particles that could pass 

through the meshes of the basket used to immersion of the sample in water.   

 

"Sample arrivals: For each sample shipment received, the date, time, sample 

numbers, total number of samples and name of the technician receiving samples are 

noted in the logbook.  An acknowledgment is then sent to the client. 

 

"Scale, calibration and quality control: The scale used for SG determinations is a 

Mettler Toledo™ Model SB 16001 (precision 0.1 g).  The unit is turned on 5 minutes 

before starting work to ensure maximum stability.  The calibration of the unit is made 

on a daily basis and as needed throughout the shift.  A certified weight of 4,000 grams 

is used to calibrate the scale during the measurement in order to verify instrument 

drift.  For quality control purposes, and unless otherwise specified by the Client, SG 

determinations are performed on a standard (quartz crystal having a specific gravity 

of 2.65) at every 20 samples.  Duplicate sample readings are also collected at every 

20 samples during data acquisition. 

 

"SG determination procedure: 

a) Check if the scale is leveled with the spirit level situated on the right side on 

front of the device; 

b) Turn the scale on 5 minutes before the first measurement; 



 
 

 96 

c) Internal calibration of the apparatus; 

d) Check the stability of the device at zero weight; 

e) Calibrate the device with the certified weight (4,000 grams); 

f) Record the water temperature at the beginning and the end of each series of 

measurements; 

g) Change the water in the immersion basin on a daily basis or as needed to 

avoid fluctuations due to particles in the water left by previous samples; 

h) Place the test sample on the scale pan and record the dry weight (g) in air on 

the data sheet; 

i) Place the test sample in the stainless steel basket suspended below the scale 

and slowly descend into the water basin until the basket is completely 

immersed. Record the weight (g) in water on the data sheet; 

j) Enter data in the table and calculate the S.G. (to one decimal place) 

k) Verify all the data and then transmit to the Client either electronically or on 

paper as instructed by the Client." 

 

11.4 MICON COMMENTS 
 

Micon is satisfied that the sampling protocols of the drilling on the Tortigny Project are in 

line with the CIM best practice guidelines.  No drilling, sampling or recovery factors have 

been identified that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the assays and, 

hence, the resource database. 

 

The extensive QA/QC analyses recommended by SGS Canada and Micon meet and exceed 

the CIM requirement for assay quality at this level of mineral exploration.  Micon does not 

agree with the assay corrections suggested by SGS (Thibert and Rousseau, 2013).  

 

The authors of this Technical Report consider the sample preparation, security and analytical 

procedures to be adequate to ensure credibility of the assays.  The QA/QC procedures and 

protocols employed by the exploration team and analytical laboratories are sufficiently 

rigorous to ensure that the sample data are appropriate for use in mineral resource estimation.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

12.1 SITE VISIT 
 

Micon visited Beaufield's Tortigny Project between October 28 and 29, 2013.  Micon was 

assisted during the site visit by Mathieu Stephens, P.Geo., who is chief geologist, exploration 

manager and an employee of Beaufield. 

 

During the site visit, the core storage facility, the main exploration trench on the property and 

the exploration camp were inspected.  

 

The core storage facility is located close to the Main Zone and contains all core from 

Beaufield's 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2013 drill programs, and the pulps and rejects for most of 

the samples.  Part of the rejects are stored in the ALS Chemex storage facility in Val d'Or, 

Quebec.  

 

The independent verification of the polymetallic mineralization, encountered during the 

Beaufield exploration program was completed during Micon's site visit in October 2013.  

Three samples were taken from the trench (one from massive sulphide vein mineralization 

and two from the host rock), and five duplicate core samples were taken from the mineralized 

intersections.  The samples were carried back to Chibougamau by Micon and  sent to TSL 

Laboratories Inc. (TSL) of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, an independent assay laboratory which 

provides analytical services to the mining industry   

 

Micon arranged for its samples to be analyzed for Ag, Au, Cu, Zn and Pb.  TSL's quality 

system conforms to requirements of ISO/IEC Standard 17025 Guidelines.  Beaufield has no 

relationship with TSL and Micon's relationship is a client-based for the purposes of assaying 

the check samples taken during its site visit.  

 

Table 12.1 summarizes the drill holes and intervals for the eight verification samples and 

compares the Tortigny assay results with the Micon assay results.  The assay results for the 

verification samples are similar to the results from the original samples.  The difference 

between the original and the core duplicate results for zinc, copper, silver are within 15%, 

and are acceptable according to the industry best practices (20% for core duplicates).  Micon 

noted that, while gold assay results varied in some instances from those obtained by 

Beaufield for the same drill interval, the differences were generally explained by a possible 

nugget effect in the higher grade gold.  Nonetheless, the samples obtained by Micon support 

the general tenor of Beaufield's assay results.

12.2 DATABASE REVIEW 
 

Beaufield provided the geological information database as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, 

called DH_2008-2010-Noranda-Troilus.xlsx.  The file was compiled from historical data and 

the results of Beaufield's drill programs.  It contained the collar, survey, assay, lithology, 

alteration, mineralogy, structure and RQD information.  Micon imported the drill hole data 

into GEMS 6.4
®
 software and verified the information using Excel, GEMS 6.4

®
 and visual 

checks.  The assay certificates were downloaded as .pdf and Excel files directly from the 

ALS Chemex webpage (www.alsglobal.com\webtrieve), using the client account 

information.  The historical data were purchased from MNR using the E-Sigeom webpage 

(http://sigeom.mrn.gouv.qc.ca).  The geological database validation involved the following 

checks: 

 

 Core logging and consistency in codes and procedures used during the different 
phases of the last exploration program and historical exploration. 

 

 Relationships between different tables, such as collar, survey, geology records and 
assay data.  

 

 Non-conforming geological information such as duplicate data for the sample 
numbers, lithology records, overlapping intervals or negative intervals. 

 

 Assay units and incorrect assay values (min and max) for each laboratory. 
 

 Accuracy of database assays compared to the original assay certificates and drill logs. 
 

 Accuracy of collar coordinates in exploration and survey grid system for each drill 
hole and collar elevations compared to the topography for each drill hole. 

 

 Down-hole survey information (dip and azimuth) for each hole. 
 

Some minor data entry errors such as missing assay results, duplicate down-hole survey data 

and switched sample intervals were found and the necessary corrections were made. 

 

During the review of the drill hole plan, several discrepancies in the collar locations were 

found and they were corrected in the database provided by Beaufield.   

 

12.3 CONCLUSIONS 
 

On the basis of the foregoing data verification exercises, Micon is satisfied that the database 

was generated in a credible manner.  Minor inconsistencies were corrected and the geological 

database is suitable for estimating the mineral resource.  

 

Since Micon used GEMS 6.4
®
 to estimate the mineral resources contained in this report, it is 

recommended that Beaufield corrects its geological database, created and maintained using 

http://www.alsglobal.com/webtrieve
http://sigeom.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/


 
 

 100 

the GeoticLog
®
 software package, before the next phase of the exploration, and that the 

database should be verified after future data additions.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

In 2011, Beaufield engaged SGS Lakefield (SGS) to conduct mineralogical analyses and 

metallurgical tests for the Tortigny mineralized zone.  The following section was derived 

from the SGS Technical report (Thibert and Rousseau, 2013) 

 

A total of 17 batch flotation tests and one locked cycle test were conducted at SGS on a 

Master Composite from ¼ drill core intervals from the Tortigny deposit's Main Zone 

identified as Comp1 and Comp2.  The Master Composite sample graded 4.30% Cu, 0.42% 

Pb, 8.36% Zn, 0.82 g/t Au and 112 g/t Ag.  There is a discrepancy between the Master 

Composite assays and the grades in the resource model, thus the results of the flotation 

testwork may not be representative for the Tortigny deposit. 

 

Mineralogical analyses of the master composite found that the metallurgical sample was 

dominated by sulphides, including pyrrhotite (24.7%), sphalerite (16.4%), chalcopyrite 

(12.1%) and pyrite (4.6%) along with traces of galena (0.5%) and cobaltite.  Gangue minerals 

included quartz (13.4%), feldspars (8.5%), micas (5.2%), calcite (4.8%), amphibole (4.2%), 

chlorites (2.3%), epidote (1.7%) and traces (<1%) of other minerals.  

 

13.1 RECOVERY ESTIMATES 
 

Two flowsheets were investigated, a bulk flotation flowsheet and a sequential flotation 

flowsheet.  Both flowsheets produced good results. 

 

13.1.1 Bulk Flotation Flowsheet 
 

The first stage of the bulk flotation flowsheet included the flotation of the chalcopyrite and 

the galena together while depressing the sphalerite.  In the second flotation stage, a lead 

concentrate was produced while chalcopyrite was depressed.  The bulk flowsheet produced a 

copper concentrate grading 26.9% Cu and 0.25% Pb at 87.4% copper recovery.  This 

flowsheet also produced a zinc concentrate grading 58.0% Zn at 44.0% zinc recovery.  The 

bulk flotation flowsheet also recovered approximately 50% of the gold and silver to the 

copper concentrate.  

 

13.1.2 Sequential Flotation Flowsheet 
 

The sequential flotation flowsheet (see Error! Reference source not found.) included the 

removal of the galena ahead of the copper flotation.  This flowsheet produced a copper 

concentrate grading 26.1% Cu and 0.52% Pb at a copper recovery of 85.6%.  A sphalerite 

concentrate was produced by this flowsheet which graded 50.1% Zn, with a 73.2% zinc 

recovery.  Gold assays were not conducted for the sequential flotation tests.

103 

 

This flowsheet was also used to conduct a lock cycle test (LCT) at SGS. LCT testwork 

produced lower grades and recoveries compared to the batch testwork.  It was suggested that 

these lower results may have been due to smaller feed charge (1 kg charge rather than the 

more standard 2 kg feed charge). The smaller feed charge was due to insufficient test sample 

material.  The LCT produced a chalcopyrite concentrate grading 21.1% Cu and 0.52% Pb at 

77.1% Cu recovery, a sphalerite concentrate grading 30.8% Zn at 81.1% Zn recovery and a 

galena concentrate grading 20.5% Pb at 52.1% Pb recovery. The majority of the gold 

(74.4%) reported to the lead concentrate while most of the silver (53.8%) reported to the 

copper concentrate. 

 

13.1.3 Deleterious Elements 
 

At a head grade of 0.42% Pb in the Master Composite sample, it was initially believed that 

lead would be deleterious and would not be recoverable to a saleable product.  However, it 

was observed during the testwork that most of the gold and a large quantity of the silver 

reported to the lead concentrate.  Thus, at the end of the flotation testing program a single 

intensive gold and silver cyanidation stage was completed on a selected sample of the 

combination of high-Pb rougher and cleaner concentrates from the flotation tests.  The head 

grade of this sample was 8.24% Cu, 17.9% Pb, 34.0 g/t Au and 1,448 g/t Ag.  Gold 

extraction after 72 hours was very good at 94.9%, silver extraction was relatively low at 

59.6%.  The cyanide consumption was also high at 71.6 kg/t, which was probably due to the 

elevated copper grade of the selected sample. 

 

A bond ball mill grindability test was performed at 150 mesh (106 µm). With a work index 

of 11.4 kWh/t, the head sample was categorized as soft. 

 

Environmental characterization was performed on the LCT combined zinc tailings stream. 

The solid was found to have a high potential for acid generation with a net NP of -108 t 

CaCO3 per 1,000 t of dry tailings and a NP/AP ratio of 0.42. This was confirmed with a net 

acid generation (NAG) of 0.46 kg/t of tailings. The combined tailings sample contained high 

levels of Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na and Zn. Copper and lead are not mentioned in SGS 

Lakefield's report but must be present.  Based on the synthetic precipitate leaching procedure 

(SPLP) leachate analysis, SGS determined that all elements of interest were well below the 

limits set by Quebec's Mining Directive 019. SGS also indicated that the probable high NAG 

potential of the final tailings suggests that installation of an acid neutralization plant will be 

required at the main tailings pond discharge. 

 

Further flotation testwork on representative samples is required to determine concentrate 

grades and recoveries for the Tortigny deposit.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

Prior to conducting the resource estimate, the integrity of the entire database was validated as 

described in Section 12 of this report.  This section summarizes the existing and new 

information and updates the previous mineral resource estimate prepared by SGS Geostat 

(Thilbet and Rousseau, 2013).   

 

14.1 DATABASE DESCRIPTION 
 

14.1.1 Drill Holes and Assays 
 

The Tortigny Project database contains a total of 135 diamond drill holes (NQ size).  The 

majority of the drill holes are along the strike of the deposit and the drill hole spacing is 

between 7 m and 150 m with a few holes on variable line spacing from 20 m to 100 m or 

more.  The drill hole layout is shown in Figure 10.3, above.  The area covered is roughly 600 

m along strike in the east-west direction and 300 m in width.  The assay database consists of 

a total of 8,515 samples that were analysed for copper, zinc, lead, silver and gold, as 

summarized in Table 14.1.  Approximately 93% of all samples are from the Tortigny deposit 

area.  The rest of the samples are from drill holes intersected small mineralized intervals in 

the basaltic rocks, away from the main mineralized zone and are not included in the resource 

estimate and geostatistical analyses.

14.1.2 Lithology and Mineralization 
 

To facilitate geological interpretation of the mineralized zone, all of the major rock types 

encountered in drill holes are documented in a "from-to" interval format.  Thirty-six major 

rock types, and several minor lithological units (see Table 10.3, above), have been coded in 

the original database provided by Beaufield.  For the purpose of the geological and resource 

modelling, the different lithological units and subunits were combined into four main rock 

groups.  

 

The first group, coded as MAF1 (Basalt sub-group 1), includes mainly intermediate and 

mafic intrusive rocks, such as diorite, gabbro and mafic tuff located stratigraphically below 

the hydrothermally altered and mineralized sediment unit.  The second group, coded as SED, 



 
 

 105 

combines different sedimentary rocks such as siltstone, schist, graphite schist, conglomerate, 

exhalites and arenite.  The third rock group, coded as MAF2 (Basalt sub-group 2), combines 

mainly intermediate and mafic volcanics, such as andesite, diorite, intermediate tuffs and 

mafic tuff.  The fourth rock group, coded as Felsic includes different felsic volcanic rocks 

(rhyolite, tonalite, quartz feldspar porphyry and undivided felsic volcanics).  The overburden, 

coded as OB, is defined as a separate rock unit with its thickness varying from about 0.5 m to 

32.2 m, but usually between 20 m and 30m.  

 

Sulphide mineralization has been recorded as percentages for each interval and ranges from 

trace (1 to 2%) to massive (80%) pyrite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite.  The 

latter is recorded as a separate sub-unit MS (massive sulphide) or S-MS (semi-massive 

sulphide), located mainly within the SED unit or on the contact between SED and MAF2 

units. 

 

14.1.3 Survey Data 
 

The survey information recorded in the files includes collar coordinates, dip, azimuth and 

down-hole survey data.  Collars were surveyed using differential GPS system in the UTM 

coordinates, NAD83 datum, zone 18 by Corriveau J.L. & Assoc. Inc., a surveying company 

based in Val d'Or, Quebec.  The accuracy of the survey is less than +/- 0.5 m.  The hole 

deviation was measured using a FlexIt electronic single shot system, that provides reading of 

azimuth, dip and in hole magnetic field intensity.  The first test is conducted 12 to 15 m 

below the casing and at every 100 m down the hole.  At the end of the hole the entire hole is 

surveyed again using a multi shot instrument taking readings every 3 m.  The data from the 

collar survey of the area was used to produce a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) that was used 

in the deposit modelling process. 

 

Historical Noranda drilling data is also included in this database.  It is comprised of collar 

information, down-hole survey data and assay results.  The original collar information was in 

local grid, but the collars from historical drilling were found in the field, marked and 

surveyed with the holes from the last drill program.  The down-hole information was 

collected using acid tests and a Tropari instrument with an accuracy of 1°. 

 

14.1.4 Specific Gravity 
 

Noranda and Beaufield acknowledged the importance of specific gravity (SG) measurements 

and tested a total of 1,789 samples.  Noranda completed 982 tests in the company laboratory 

between 1995 and 1996.  Beaufield conducted 807 specific gravity tests and included 

samples from different lithological units.  The data was provided as an Excel spreadsheet 

(Beaufield Densimetrie relative 2011-06.xls).  The results from all spreadsheets were merged 

into one spreadsheet and joined with the assay results and the lithology in GEMS 6.4
®
 

database, using the sample number as a primary common key.  The data was separated 

according to the rock code and lithological unit.  The descriptive statistics are tabulated in 

Table 14.2.  The results from the tests showed that the specific gravity varies over wide 



 
 

 106 

ranges within the same lithological unit and the amount of sulphide mineralization is more 

important than the lithology.

Tortigny mineralization is polymetallic and it is difficult to determine the exact influence of 

every element and mineral on the specific gravity, but if CuEq is used as a measurement of 

the polymetallic mineralization, then the specific gravity for the rest of the samples can be 

calculated as a linear function of the CuEq.  The results from the scattered plot graph and the 

equation are illustrated in Figure 14.1.

Relationship between SG and CuEq(%)

The specific gravity for the rest of the samples is calculated as: 

 

SG=2.83+0.09*CuEq(%) 

 

Based on the experimental results, the specific gravity for the barren host rock or waste is 

accepted as 2.83 for resource estimation and optimized pit design purposes. 

 

14.1.5 Master Geological Database 
 

Micon received an Access database, GCDBTR.mdb, and an export of the Geotic database as 

a Microsoft Excel file, Export Complete-TOUS LE PROJECT.xlsx, which contained the 

geological database for Tortigny Project.  The master database was created by importing the 

data described in Sections 14.1.1 to 14.1.4 from Excel spreadsheet files into GEMS 6.4
®

 

software.  The GEMS 6.4
®
 software was used for solids validation, geostatistics, resource 

modelling and resource reporting. 

 

14.2 ESTIMATION DETAILS 
 

The Tortigny mineral resource estimate was prepared using geological interpretation, 

conventional statistical analysis on raw data, solid creation, statistical analysis on silver and 

gold composite sample data, geostatistical analysis, calculation of the interpolation 

parameters, block modelling, block model validation and classification. 

 

14.2.1 Polymetallic Mineralization 
 

The Tortigny deposit contains one high-grade polymetallic mineralized zone in the hinge of 

the synform and larger, lower grade mineralized envelope around the high-grade zone in the 

south and north limbs of the fold structure.  The high-grade mineralisation in the hinge zone 

is represented mainly by massive sulphides (coded as MS) and semi-massive sulphides 

(coded S-MS) comprising chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrrhotite, galena and arsenopyrite.  The 

lower grade mineralized envelope, represented by smaller veinlets and stringers of sulphides.  

The high grade mineralization, located in east part of the Tortigny deposit is very well 

explored with sufficient amount of drilling and trenching.  Additional veins or lenses with 

Zn-Ag-Pb and Cu-Au mineralization were intersected parallel to the north and south limbs 

and at depth.  At this stage the small satellite lenses are not included in the mineralized 

envelope of the Tortigny deposit or in the current resource estimate 

 

The lead sulphide mineralization is present in both high grade and low grade mineralized 

zones, but it is not included in the resource estimate due to the low recovery, and inconsistent 

grade.  In order to convert the Cu, Zn, Ag and Au assay results to copper equivalent (CuEq 

%) estimates and report the mineral resources Beaufield engaged SGS Canada to conduct 

initial metallurgical testwork and determined the recoveries for each element, as discussed in 

Section 13.0.  A recovery of 73% was applied to Zn, 86% was applied to Cu, 65% was 

applied to Ag, and 50% was applied to Au.   

 



 
 

 108 

As it was mentioned in Section 10.2 Micon used the three-year average metal prices for 

copper and zinc published by Metal Bulletin.  The price for gold and silver used are the long 

term metal prices, projected by Energy and Metals Consensus Forecast in December, 2013, 

to calculate the copper equivalent grades presented used for the resource estimate. 

 

 Cu US$3.18/lb. 

 Zn US$0.95/lb. 

 Ag US$22.5/oz. 

 Au US$1,400/oz. 
 

The formula used by Micon for calculation of the CuEq% is as follows: 

 

CuEq(%)= 

    Cu% * Cu_recov * Cu_price/Cu_price 

 +Zn% * Zn_recov * Cu_price * (Zn_price/Cu_price) 

 +Ag_g/t * Ag_recov * Ag_price * (0.03215*Ag_price)/(22.04 * Cu_price) 

 +Au_g/t * Au_recov * Au_price * (0.03215*Au_price)/(22.04*Cu_price) 

 

The basic statistics for the four main elements and CuEq(%) data, used in the current mineral 

resource estimate are tabulated in Table 14.3.

The Tortigny polymetallic deposit is complicated by the variations of the silver, gold, zinc 

and copper grades within the mineralized zones and the geological structures (folds and 

faults) in the host rocks.  The logarithmic graphs of the frequency histograms for copper, zinc 

and silver demonstrated the existence of two types of mineralization: high-grade and low-

grade.  The mineral resource estimate was prepared restricting the influence of the high-grade 

values only within the high-grade zone and the low-grade values only for the low grade zone.  

 

Beaufield conducted a metallurgical test and determined the recoveries for silver, gold, zinc, 

lead and copper.  Micon calculated the CuEq(%), which is a metal equivalent grade, based on 

the metallurgical recoveries and metal prices in order to evaluate the economic potential of 

the project.

14.2.1.1 Mineralized Domain 
 

The resource area covered by drilling up to December 31, 2013, is referred as the Tortigny 

deposit.  The Tortigny polymetallic mineralized zone looks like an open book and it consists 

of one high-grade zone (HG) and a lower grade mineralized envelope (LG).  The HG domain 

is located in the hinge of the east-west trending synform structure and separated as a separate 

geological domain.  The HG domain includes high grade mineralization, accumulated in 

veins and lenses of massive sulphides, surrounded by a stockwork of semi-massive sulphide 

and small veins and veinlets.  The LG domain includes the semi-massive and sulphide 

mineralization located in the north and south limb of the synform.  The south zone is thicker 

than the north zone.  The boundary between HG and LG domains is not a hard geological 

boundary, and the separation between the two domains is based on assay results and reflects 

different geostatistical populations.

 110 

The Tortigny mineralized zone is V-shaped synform with high-grade sulphide, polymetallic 

mineralization in the hinge of the fold and plunge of approximately 265°/50°.  The south 

limb strikes almost EW (265°) with a 65° to 75° dip and the north limb strikes at WNW 

(275° to 280°) with a 70° to 75ᵒ dip.  The mineralized zone has been intersected in 98 drill 
holes over a strike length of approximately 300 m.  It is subparallel to the contact of the 

MAF2 and SED unit (see Figure 7.2 above).  The mineralized zone has a variable thickness.  

 

For resource estimate purposes, only the intervals with CuEq ≥ 0.15% were included in 

Tortigny polymetallic mineralized envelope.  The thickness of the high-grade polymetallic 

mineralization ranges from 30 m to 70 m (510980E to 511070E).  The mineralization in the 

south limb is exposed on the surface and the width varies from 3 to 9 m.  The mineralization 

in the North Zone (north limb of the fold) is exposed on the surface only in one outcrop, but 

it was intersected at depth in drill holes.  It appears to be two to three times narrower and 

lower grade compared to the mineralization in the South zone (south limb).  

 

The high-grade zone plunges west (azimuth 260° to 265°) at -50°to -60
o
.     

 

14.2.2 Statistics on Raw Assay Data 
 

Statistical analysis of the raw assay data was conducted primarily to determine the 

mineralization grade and define the envelope of the resource zone.  The distribution of 

sample length for the drill samples within the mineralized zone is presented as a histogram in 

Figure 14.3.  The length of the samples ranges from 0.25 m to 8.0 m.  The majority of sample 

lengths are between 1.0 and 2.0 m and the mean sample length is 0.92 m, although some 

historical samples are longer.  The company envisions an open pit and underground 

development.  The conceptual height of the pit's benches is 6 m, therefore the compositing 

interval of 3 m, which is equal to one half of the bench height, was chosen. 

 
Figure 14.3   

Histogram of Sample Length (raw data) 

 

 



 
 

 111 

 

The primary statistics of the raw assay data are presented in Figure 14.4.   

 

The cumulative frequency histogram displays a highly skewed distribution for the zinc, 

copper, lead, silver and gold assays.  A long tail of high Zn, Cu, Ag and Au values with low 

frequency is shown in Figure 14.4 and Figure 14.5.  The log-normal probability plot for the 

raw assay data (Figure 14.5) reveals a break at approximately 1.0% Zn, 0.3% Cu at the lower 

end of the scale, representing lower limits of the outer/broader envelope of mineralization.   

 
Figure 14.4   

Cumulative Frequency Histogram (Log10 Scale) of the Raw Assay for Cu, Zn, Ag and Au 

 

  

  
 

The frequency of the Ag, Au, Cu, and Zn assay results, plotted on a logarithmic scale show 

that all data are from two populations - low grade and high grade.  There is a high-grade 

mineralization population, but the probability plots (Figure 14.4) suggests that the graph is 

almost flat around 500 g/t Ag, 16 g/t Au, 14% Cu and 30% Zn.  More than 99% of the assays 

are included in the data set when the grade was capped at 450 g/t Ag, 16 g/t Au, 14% Cu and 

29.5% Zn.

Table 14.4 shows the grade capping values and the number of samples capped, prior to 

compositing.  Accordingly, the 2,390g/t Ag recorded over 1 m was cut down to 450 g/t Ag 

and 34.9 g/t Au recovered from 1.25 m was replaced with 16.0 g/t Au. 

 
Figure 14.5   

Probability Plots of the Raw Assay for Cu (%), Zn (%), Ag (g/t), and Au (g/t) 

 

  

  
 

The raw assays from the data set were used to prepare an X-Y scatter plot and check for 

correlation between the silver, zinc, copper and gold mineralization.  The data do not show a 

clear positive or negative correlation and most likely there are two different stages of 

mineralization, forming separate but partly overlapping mineralized zones. 

 



 
 

 113 

14.2.3 Solid Creation/Modelling 
 

The mineralized domains (LG and HG) and the lithological solids were modelled in GEMS 

6.4
®
 using interactive 3D triangulation supported by sectional interpretation.  The 3D solids 

are shown on Figure 14.6. 

 
Figure 14.6   

3D Model of Tortigny Mineralized Zone 

 

 
 

A cut-off grade of 0.15% CuEq was used to model the solid.  The 0.15% CuEq cut-off was 

used in order to outline the mineralized envelope and demonstrate the continuity of the 



 
 

 114 

mineralization.  In some cases lower grade intervals were included when they were between 

high-grade intervals in order to maintain mineralization and geological continuity.   

 

The Tortigny mineralized zone was modelled considering that the project has reasonable 

prospects for economic extraction by a combination of open pit and underground 

exploitation.  The minimum width for the mineralized zone was set at 3 m.  Points defining 

the limits of each solid were snapped to the end points of the appropriate drill hole intervals 

to ensure proper sample capture.  Snapped points were validated through visual checks using 

a built-in module within the GEMS 6.4
®
 software.  The solids were verified to ensure that 

there were no intersections or invalid (open or shared) edges. 

 

14.2.4 Compositing and Statistics on Composites 
 

Composites were developed within the mineralized envelope, which includes the main V-

shaped synform, including the Main zone (in the hinge) and the additional mineralization 

developed in the limbs (South Zone and North Zone).  Statistical analysis of composite 

samples within the solids was performed to determine population patterns and global means.  

The statistical results are presented in Table 14.5.

The composites were calculated using a single cut-off value method.  The composite lengths 

were based on 3-m intervals that have values greater than or equal to a 0.15% CuEq cut-off 

value.  A total of 98 drill holes from Beaufield's exploration program and holes from the 

historical exploration were included in the subset of assay data.  Composite values for Cu, 

Zn, Ag and Au were calculated from the raw assay data.  The maximum inclusion length was 

3 m for waste or low-grade intervals with CuEq ≤0.15%.  These low-grade and waste 

intervals were included in composited intervals between high-grade samples.   

 

Silver, gold, copper and zinc composite results display a positively skewed distribution.  The 

cumulative frequency histograms and probability plots (Figure 14.7) show two populations of 

values for copper, zinc and silver.  The first population of data from the Tortigny mineralized 



 
 

 115 

zone represents low-grade disseminated and stockwork mineralization and the second 

population represents the high-grade massive and semi-massive mineralization.  Values 

below this range are due to waste inclusions as described in Section 14.2.1.  A summary of 

the value ranges is tabulated in Table 14.6.

14.2.5 Grade Variography 
 

The Tortigny mineralized zone has sufficient composite data for geostatistical analysis on the 

central part of the V-shaped synform, but there are insufficient data to complete separate 

geostatistical analysis on the south and north limbs.  As a result, the variographic analysis 

was completed for the whole area in order to define the continuity of the mineralization, to 

establish the maximum range/distance over which samples/drill hole intercepts may be 

correlated and the optimum parameters for the search ellipse to be used in the interpolation of 

grades.  

 

A down-hole variogram was computed in order to establish the nugget effect.  This is 

provided in Appendix 2.  Preparation of separate variograms for the high and low grade 

mineralization were attempted, but the ranges are almost the same.  Subsequently, three 

variograms, to cover the principal geometric directions, were computed and modelled using 

the nugget effect established from the down-hole variogram.  The anisotropy ellipsoid had a 

260ᵒ azimuth and -50ᵒ dip.  Figure 14.8, Figure 14.9 and Figure 14.10 present the major, 
semi-major and minor variograms.

NC-not enough data to be calculated 

 

Based on the ranges of influence of Cu, Zn, Ag and Au, the maximum dimensions of the 

radii of the search ellipsoid for grade interpolation of the Tortigny Main zone, located in the 

hinge of the synform, should not exceed 24 m.  In the current resource estimate Micon 

accepted two thirds of the maximum semi-variogram range as a radius of the search ellipsoid 

for a Measured Resource.  For simplicity Micon accepted the same range for all four 

elements, using the smallest range.  For the Indicated Resource, the radii of the search 

ellipsoid for grade interpolation were 90 m by 60 m by 6 m (less than 100 m).  Micon was 

unable to determine the width for the ellipse from the variograms and used 6 m as the width 

as this is believed to be the economic width of the veins that may potentially be mined.   

 

14.2.6 Block Model Definition/Description 
 

The block model for the Tortigny Project contains the Tortigny mineralized zone and is 

defined by the parameters tabulated in Table 14.8.

 122 

The block size is 6 m by 3 m by 6 m.  The overall dimensions of the block model are 360 m 

length by 330 m width by 480 m depth.  The model is in the UTM coordinate system, datum 

NAD83, zone 18. 

 

Partial percentages were used at the solid/mineralization envelope boundary to get an 

accurate volume representation.  A volume check of the block model versus the 

mineralization envelope revealed a good representation of the volumes of the solids. 

 

14.2.7 Grade Interpolation/Search Parameters 
 

In deriving the search radii for the search ellipsoid, Micon applied the maximum ranges of 

influence as determined by the variography (Table 14.7).  The search parameters adopted for 

the resource estimate are summarized in Table 14.9. 

 

Due to limitations of data, only three isotropic searches were employed, with the third being 

made large enough to populate the entire solid.

Maximum number of samples per block 8 8 8

For all passes, a maximum number of 12 composite samples per drill hole was used in the 

interpolation in order to control the number of samples from the same drill hole in one block. 

 

For Pass 1, a minimum number of three samples and a maximum of 12 samples per block 

were used for interpolation to ensure that the nearest samples were accorded the highest 

weighting and that a minimum of the three closest holes were used in the interpolation.  For 

Pass 2, the minimum number of two samples and maximum of eight per block was designed 

to ensure a minimum of two drill holes were included in the interpolation, and the 

interpolation went beyond the range limits of Pass 1.  For Pass 3, the minimum number of 

one sample and maximum of eight per block was designed to ensure a minimum of one drill 

hole was included in the interpolation, and the interpolation went beyond the range limits of 

Pass 2.  Not all blocks of the block model were filled. 

 

The search ellipsoid was at a principal azimuth of 260°, inclined at -50° and with 

intermediate azimuth 350° (See Figure 14.11).

14.3 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

14.3.1 Resource Modelling/Estimation and Categorization 
 

Block grades for Cu, Zn, Ag and Au were interpolated into the individual blocks of the 

mineralized domains/envelopes using the search parameters described above and the 

Ordinary Kriging (OK) function of the GEMS 6.4
®

 software.  The optimized pit shell was 

prepared using the Gemcom Whittle
®
 4.5.  The resources included in this block model are 

classified as Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources using the following criteria: 

  

 The mineral resources included all mineralized blocks within one to three times the 
variogram range and were estimated in three passes.  

 



 
 

 124 

 The mineral resources for blocks that were estimated in Pass 1 within the optimized 
pit and in the UG development areas were classified in the Measured category.  The 

mineral resources for areas, estimated in Pass 2 or in Pass 1, but away from the main 

contiguous mineralization are classified in the Indicated category and the blocks 

estimated in Passes 2 and 3 that did not meet the criteria of the Indicated category are 

classified in the Inferred category.  Generally, the Measured resource area is drilled 

on less than 20 m spacing.  Indicated resource area has been drilled at 30 m by 50 m 

and the Inferred resource areas have been drilled on 50 m by 100 m grid or larger. 

 

14.3.2 Resource Estimation for the Tortigny Polymetallic Mineralization 
 

The mineral resource statement was prepared on the basis of the copper, zinc, silver and gold 

content and is reported at different cut-off grades considering the most likely extraction 

scenario (open pit or underground) without taking external, non-mining based factors into 

account.  Open pittable resources are constrained within an economically optimized open pit 

shell. 

 

A review of the composites and the figures indicate that a 0.15% CuEq was used as a cut-off 

grade for the polymetallic mineralization interpretation.  Therefore the mineralized envelope 

and the 3D mineralization solid was generated is at 0.15 % CuEq cut-off.  In order to create 

economically optimal pit shells and underground stopes around the mineralized zones and 

estimate the reportable mineral resources the following key parameters and assumptions were 

used: 

 

 Open pit mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.50 % CuEq.  

 Underground mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 2.25% CuEq.  

 Cut-off grades are based on a long term copper price US$3.18/lb, zinc price 
US$0.95/lb, silver price of US$22.5oz and gold price of US$1,400/oz. 

 A metallurgical recovery of 86% was applied to Cu, 73% was applied to Zn, 65% was 
applied to Ag, and 50% was applied to Au for calculation of the copper equivalent 

grade.  

 Costs assumed for open pit development were:  US$2.00/t mined, US$12.50/t 
processed and US$2.50/t for G&A, ecological monitoring and community relations or 

a total of US$17.00/t processed. 

 Costs for underground development were: 60.00 US$/t mined, US$12.50/t processed 
and US$2.50/t for G&A, ecological monitoring and community relations or a total 

$75.00/t processed. 

 Percent payable after refining: 75% for Cu, 75% for Zn, 80% for Ag and 95 % for 
Au. 



 
 

 125 

 Assumed transportation cost: 2 US$/t concentrate. 

The resource block model was subjected to analysis using conventional GEMS 6.4
®
 and 

Whittle 4.5
®
 software, to define potentially economic mineralized blocks for open pit mining, 

using the economic criteria described above. 

 

The Mineral Resource was separated into In-Pit Resources and Underground Resources.  The 

Mineral Resource is presented in Table 14.10 at 0.50% CuEq cut-off grades for the open pit 

(OP) portion and 2.25% CuEq cut-off grade for the underground (UG) portion of the deposit. 

 

As of June 2, 2014 the updated mineral resources for the Tortigny deposit are estimated to 

contain: 

 

 Measured Resources of 550,000 tonnes grading 2.3% copper (Cu), 4.23% zinc (Zn), 
59.99 g/t silver (Ag) 0.43 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Indicated Resources of 548,000 tonnes grading 1.18% copper (Cu), 3.09% zinc (Zn), 
36.19 g/t silver (Ag), 0.25 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Measured and Indicated Resources of 1,098,000 tonnes grading 1.78% copper 
(Cu), 3.65% zinc (Zn), 48.51 g/t silver (Ag), 0.35 g/t gold (Au) and  

 

 Inferred Resources of 99,000 tonnes grading 1.19% copper (Cu), 1.23% zinc (Zn), 
12.45 g/t silver (Ag) and <0.1 g/t gold (Au). 

 

Micon prepared a sensitivity study with mineral resource estimates for five possible cut-off 

grades.  For the in-pit resources the mineral resources are reported at 0.30% CuEq, 0.40% 

CuEq, 0.50% CuEq, 0.60% CuEq, and 0.70% CuEq.  For the underground portion the 

mineral resources are estimated at 1.75% CuEq, 2.00% CuEq, 2.25% CuEq, 2.50% CuEq and 

2.75% CuEq.  The grade and tonnage at various cut-off levels are provided in Table 14.11.  

 

Micon recommends that Beaufield use the 0.50% CuEq cut-off grade to report the open pit 

portion of the Tortigny polymetallic deposit and 2.25% CuEq cut-off grade for the potential 

underground development.

1. Mineral Resources tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add up due to rounding. 
2. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources will be converted into Mineral Reserves. 
3. Inferred Mineral Resources are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  It is uncertain if further 

exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or a measured mineral resource. 

4. All currency amounts (commodity prices, NSR) are in US dollars.  
5. NRS=Net Smelter Return 
6. All resources are in-situ, non-diluted.

It is Micon's opinion that there are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 

socio-economic, marketing or political issues that would adversely affect the mineral 

resources presented above.  However, the mineral resources presented herein are not mineral 

reserves as they have not been subject to adequate economic studies to demonstrate their 

economic viability.  There are currently no mineral reserves on the Tortigny Project and there 

is no assurance that the project will be placed into production. 

 

The QP responsible for the preparation of this resource estimate is Tania Ilieva, P.Geo.  She 

was assisted by Ing. Alan San Martin.  Dr. Ilieva is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-

101, and is independent of Beaufield. 

 

The effective date of the estimate is June 2, 2014. 

 

14.3.3 Resource Model Validation 
 

The resource model was validated by visual inspection and comparison of the average values 

for Cu (%), Zn (%), Ag (g/t) and Au (g/t) with the respective average values for the 

composites, located within the HG and LG domains.  For comparison purposes a second 

block model of the mineralized domains/envelopes was created using the search parameters 

described above and the Inverse Distance (ID
2
) function of the GEMS 6.4

®
 software.  The 

blocks were populated and the average values were compared to the values from the OK 

estimate.  See Table 14.12.

14.3.3.1 Visual Inspection 
 

The resource block model was validated by visual inspection in plan and section to ensure 

that block grade estimates reflected the grades seen in neighbouring and intersecting drill 

holes.  Typical sections are presented in Figure 14.12, Figure 14.13 and Figure 14.14.  More 

sections and level plans are provided in Appendix 3.  It is evident that the block grades 

compare well with the drill hole intersections.

16.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

During the last decade several junior and major companies have been exploring for base and 

precious metals in the area and one mine and several gold and base metals showings have 

been discovered in the Troilus-Frotet greenstone belt.  The most important projects are 

shown on Figure 16.1 

 
Figure 16.1   

Properties in Troilus-Tortigny Area 

 

 
 

The most significant mineral deposit is the now closed Troilus gold-copper mine.  Between 

1997 and 2009 Inmet Mining Corporation owned the Troilus open pit mine and has produced 

a total of 67,946,868 t at 0.1% Cu and 1.065 g/t Au (Inmet, 2010).   

 

Approximately 25 km southeast of the Tortigny polymetallic project is the Lessard Copper-

Zinc Project, owned by Landore Resources Canada Inc.  The company is still exploring the 

area, but as a result of historic exploration and the 2006 to 2008 drilling program , a resource 

estimate compliant with NI 43-101 was completed on the Lessard (Domergue) "deposit" 

(Armbrust, G. and Sandefur, E., 2008).  The resource estimate reported 740,000 t of inferred 

resources at 1.88% Cu, 3.50% Zn, 38.62 g/t silver and 0.84 g/t gold using an NSR value of 

US$206.52.   

 



 
 

 135 

SOQUEM (http://soquem.qc.ca/en/projects/) has staked a land package in the area east of the 

Tortigny block and adjacent to it.  Further southeast, SOQUEM has done exploration work 

on the De Maurès polymetallic project and (Bellavance, Y. 1998) prepared a resource 

estimate of 350 000 t 7.84% Zn, 1.35% Cu and 22.31 g/t Ag which is non-compliant with 

NI43-101.

18.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

The 2008 to 2013 drilling programs conducted by Beaufield have demonstrated that the 

polymetallic mineralization at the Tortigny Project is present from surface down to the 100 m 

level (approximately 300 m below the surface).  Holes TO-10-16 and TO-10-18 reached a 

maximum vertical depth of -400m elevation.   

 

The Tortigny polymetallic zone is almost always identifiable by anomalous values of Cu, Zn, 

Ag, Au and Pb, although not all of the drill holes returned high grades.  The continuity of the 

Tortigny polymetallic zone is fairly consistent and its geometry is a V-shaped synform, 

plunging west with an average thickness of about 20 to 30 m.  However, the thickness of the 

mineralization can vary considerably depending on the cut-off grade used to identify the 

zone.  The boundaries of the Tortigny polymetallic zone are relatively well-defined and the 

mineralization is within the metasediments.   

 

Beaufield has drilled along a total strike length of about 600 m, with the highest density of 

holes lying within a 300 m stretch.  Further drilling is necessary to determine if the 

polymetallic mineralization is part of a series of potentially economic mineralized zones on 

the other geophysical anomalies located east and south of the Tortigny Main zone.   

 

Micon completed a mineral resource estimate for the mineralization contained in the 

Tortigny mineralized zone, outlined by Beaufield through its recent drilling programs.  

Grades for Cu, Zn, Ag and Au were interpolated into the individual blocks of the mineralized 

domains/envelopes using the search parameters described above and the OK function of the 

GEMS 6.4
®
 software.  An optimized pit shell was prepared using Whittle

®
 4.5 software.  All 

mineralized blocks within one to three times the variogram range are estimated with a 

minimum of two drill holes.  The areas and contiguous blocks that were estimated in Pass 1, 

and are within the optimized pit shell or in the area of possible underground development, 

were classified in the Measured category.  The blocks that were estimated in Pass 2, and are 

within the optimized pit shell or possible UG development area, are classified in the 

Indicated category.  The blocks estimated in Passes 2 and 3 that did not meet the criteria of 

the Indicated category are classified in the Inferred category.  Generally, the Measured 

resources are drilled on less than 20 m spacing, the Indicated resource area has been drilled 

on a less than 50 m by 50 m grid and the Inferred resource areas have been drilled on 100 m 

by 100 m grid or larger.   

 

The Mineral Resource was separated into In-Pit Resources and Underground Resources.  The 

Mineral Resource is presented in Table 18.1 at 0.50% CuEq cut-off grades for the open pit 

(OP) portion and 2.25% CuEq cut-off grade for the underground (UG) portion of the deposit. 

 

As of June 2, 2014 the updated mineral resources for the Tortigny deposit are estimated to 

contain: 

 

 Measured Resources of 550,000 tonnes grading 2.3% copper (Cu), 4.23% zinc (Zn), 
59.99 g/t silver (Ag) 0.43 g/t gold (Au); 



 
 

 138 

 

 Indicated Resources of 548,000 tonnes grading 1.18% copper (Cu), 3.09% zinc (Zn), 
36.19 g/t silver (Ag), 0.25 g/t gold (Au); 

 

 Measured and Indicated Resources of 1,098,000 tonnes grading 1.78% copper (Cu), 
3.65% zinc (Zn), 48.51 g/t silver (Ag), 0.35 g/t gold (Au) and  

 

 Inferred Resources of 99,000 tonnes grading 1.19% copper (Cu), 1.23% zinc (Zn), 
12.45 g/t silver (Ag) and <0.1 g/t gold (Au).

2. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the estimated Mineral Resources will be converted into Mineral Reserves. 
3. Inferred Mineral Resources are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  It is 

uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or a measured mineral resource.

It is Micon's opinion that there are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 

socio-economic, marketing or political issues that would adversely affect the mineral 

resources presented above.  However, the mineral resources presented herein are not mineral 

reserves as they have not been subject to adequate economic studies to demonstrate their 

economic viability. 

 

The Tortigny polymetallic zone and parallel zones have the potential to expand with the 

exploration possibilities on the Troilus-Tortigny Property.  Further drilling on the known 

geophysical anomalies adjacent to the Tortigny polymetallic zone has the potential to expand 

upon the current resource estimate.   

 

Beaufield is still in the early stages of conducting exploration programs on the Troilus-

Tortigny Property and most of the area is underexplored.  It is expected that further stripping, 

mapping, sampling, structural analyses and exploratory drilling may identify new exploration 

targets in similar structures and potential economic mineralization. 

 

 



 
 

 141 

19.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Beaufield's drill programs from 2008 to 2013 resulted in an extension of the Tortigny 

mineralized zone and the preparation of the mineral resource estimate for the Tortigny main 

mineralized zone, located in the hinge of the SW plunging V-shaped synform. The drilling 

intersected additional small lenses, parallel to the main mineralization, located in the same 

metasedimentary unit, that are not included in the current resource estimate.   
 

19.1 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

In order to advance the Tortigny polymetallic project Beaufield has to continue the 

exploration program on the Tortigny Property. Based on the positive results from the 

previous exploration programs and the current resource estimate Micon has the following 

recommendations: 
  

 Conduct a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) on the measured, indicated and 
inferred resources.  The components of the study should include an engineering study 

(open-pit, mill and access road), metallurgical bench testing and relevant 

environmental studies.  Financial analysis should be conducted on a fully cost project 

basis. 
 

 Carry out additional structural analyses in order to identify fold structures similar to 
Tortigny metasedimentary synform. In areas without surface outcrops oriented core 

drilling would be helpful to determine late brittle fault orientations and predict the 

offset direction and magnitude. Deatiled structural mapping is recommended in the 

area of recently stripped outcrops northeast of the TO-10-19 drill hole collar. 

Additionally systematic mapping of S0, S1 structures and fold asymmetry may help 

to identify other hinge zones and prospective parasitic folds. 
 

 The rest of the property, east of the Tortigny mineralized zone (east of 511150E) 
remains underexplored.  Therefore, stripping, mapping and sampling of the area ENE 

of the known fold hinge along the strike of the outcrop of the sulphide-rich 

metasedimentary unit may contain isolated lenses of mineralized metasediments in 

fold troughs. Exploration for other types of deposits should also be considered.  For 

example, porphyry-style mineralization typical of the Troilus Mine may also exist in 

the area near Tortigny. 
 

 Additional metallurgical testing of the high grade and low grade mineralization 
should be conducted in order to determine more precisely the recoverability of the 

copper, zinc, silver and gold mineralization in order to optimize the flotation and 

recovery. 
 

 The results from the QA/QC samples should be plotted and monitored on a regular 
basis.  If the standards fail the test, then the whole batch should be reassayed. When 

the new assay results are received, the QA/QC graphs should be updated to reflect the 

latest results. 
 

 Full lineament analysis and structural interpretations of the regional magnetic survey 
and any available satellite imagery or air photos should be completed. 



 
 

 142 

 

Following the interpretation of the geophysical surveys, Beaufield proposes to conduct 

regional exploration and exploratory drilling along the margins of the northeast and 

southwest quadrants (pressure shadows) of the intrusion directly northeast of the Tortigny 

polymetallic mineralized zone. The budget for this remained to be determined. Micon 

estimates the cost of the additional exploration to be in the order of $2,000,000. 
 

Micon has reviewed Beaufield's proposal for further exploration on its Tortigny Property and 

recommends that Beaufield conduct the exploration program as proposed, subject to funding 

and any other matters. 
 

19.2 PROPOSED BUDGET 
 

Beaufield would start the next exploration program with additional bulk sampling of the 

Main zone and would continue with stripping, mapping and sampling prior to additional 

drilling along the favourable trend. Areas of interest exhibiting favourable parameters would 

possibly be further tested by in-fill drilling. An additional 5,000 m of drilling of other 

anomalies on the Troilus-Tortigny property is proposed with a budget of approximately 

$2,000,000.
