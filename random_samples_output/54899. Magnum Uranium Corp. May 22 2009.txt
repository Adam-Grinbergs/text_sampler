3.0  SUMMARY 

The Deep Gold Uranium Deposit exists as part of Magnum Uranium Corp.'s larger San Rafael 

Uranium Project, all located in east-central Emery County, Utah. In its entirety, Magnum's San 

Rafael Uranium Project land position occurs as a contiguous claim block covered by 270 BM 

unpatented federal lode mining claims and the State Section 36 Mineral Lease area. Magnum's 

interest in the San Rafael Uranium Project and Deep Gold was obtained on November 19, 2006, 

via a joint venture (JV) agreement with Energy Metals Corporation (EMC), the underlying 

property owner. As of February 12, 2008, Magnum spent in excess of US$1,000,000 in work-

related expenses and issued 850,000 treasury shares meeting all the requirements to complete an 

80% earn-in. Subsequently, and as of December 31, 2008, Magnum's interest increased to 100% 

with EMC's interest diluted to a non-participatory 2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). Also, since 

the signing of the Magnum/EMC JV agreement, EMC has been acquired by Uranium One.  

This report has been prepared to amend the original NI 43-101 Technical Report entitled "Deep 

Gold Uranium Deposit, Emery County, Utah" by Steve R. Sturm, C.P.G., March 28, 2008, and 

to state the resource estimates on the Deep Gold Deposit and portions of it as a result of: 1) 

acquiring a 100% interest in the Deep Gold West portion of the deposit (up from the previous 

80%) from Uranium One (Secs, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.3); 2) a new assumption regarding ownership of 

the eastern portion of the resource previously stated as partially owned by Magnum, but now 

assumed for this purpose to be 100% owned by Uranium Power Corp. and Uranium One (Sec. 

8.3); 3) a change in the tonnage factor used from 15 ft
3
/ton to 14 ft

3
/ton resulting in an overall 

increase of resources (Sec. 19.0); and 4) the addition of Inferred resources on Magnum's Deep 

Gold West portion of the deposit (Sec. 19.0). 

The Deep Gold deposit was originally discovered by Pioneer Uravan geologists in the late 

1970's and early 1980's as a result of exploration drilling conducted just east of the core of the 

Tidwell Uranium District and north-northeast of the Acerson Mineral Belt. The area containing 

the deposit was considered to contain highly prospective areas within upper Salt Wash paleo 

trunk stream channel trends as projected eastward and northeastward from Atlas Minerals' Snow 

and Lucky Mines. This favorability was projected into Section 23 where Pioneer Uravan drilling 

ultimately led to the Deep Gold discovery. Uranium mineralization at the adjacent Snow Mine 

was previously discovered by Atlas Minerals in 1972; it produced for nine years, with production 

starting in March 1973 and ending in January, 1982. Production from the Snow comprises 

650,292 pounds of U3O8 contained in 173,330 tons of material at an average grade of 0.188% 

U3O8 (Wilbanks, 1982). As with the Snow, the Deep Gold deposit is a peneconcordant, channel-

controlled, sandstone-hosted, trend type, with mineralization hosted by the upper sandstone 

sequence of the Salt Wash Member of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. 

In addition to Pioneer Uravan, Atlas Minerals conducted follow-up exploration drilling and 

performed two non-compliant historic resource estimates on Deep Gold during 1984 and 1985. 

These resource estimates are of historical importance, generated by a senior mining company 

with significant uranium exploration and production experience. Tonnages contained in these 

estimates vary somewhat with those of the author's estimate because of the number of drill holes 

used and areas of influence employed around drill holes. Average grades of the estimates are all 



 6 

generally close, mostly in the 0.25% to 0.30% U3O8 range. For this report, no economic 

evaluation of the mineralization was performed.  Thus, the estimate that follows is solely a 

mineral resource.  The resource is broken out by indicated and inferred as shown below: 

 Magnum Indicated 

Resource 

Magnum Inferred 

Resource 

TONS 144,600 T 37,450 T 

POUNDS U3O8 663,400 266,100 

Grade % U3O8 0.229% 0.355% 

POUNDS/TON 4.59  7.11 

Note: The total resource (Magnum and UPC/Uranium One) of the Deep Gold Deposit is 302,800 tons @ 0.272% 

eU3O8 for 1,646,700 pounds Indicated and 37,450 tons @ 0.355% eU3O8 for 266,100 pounds U3O8 Inferred. 

Magnum owns 100% of the West Deep Gold portion of the Deep Gold deposit and, for the 

purposes of this report, I have assumed that Magnum owns none of the eastern part of the deposit 

on the Hollie claims. This portion comprises an indicated resource of 144,600 tons @ 0.229% 

U3O8 containing 663,400 lbs U3O8 and an inferred resource of 37,450 tons @ 0.355% U3O8 

containing 266,100 lbs U3O8.  Magnum's amended total resource now comprises 929,500 lbs of 

U3O8 compared to the total resource reported in the original March 28
th

 NI 43-101 report of 

925,000 lbs U3O8, for an increase of 0.5%. 

It is estimated that approximately 288,000 feet of historic drilling, conventional and core, spread 

among 299 holes, was conducted on the Deep Gold. Depth to mineralization in Section 23 

averages 800 feet, with hole depths averaging approximately 1,000 feet. Considering that 

approximately 288,000 feet of historic drilling was performed on the Deep Gold, costs for this 

drilling, in 1981 US dollars, result in a total exploration drilling expenditure of approximately 

$2.88 million, based on $10 per foot average drill cost. Factoring in inflation and equating this 

amount to today's real dollar costs results in a current estimated amount of US$6.99 million 

based on an inflation factor of 143% between 1981 and 2008. 

The Tidwell and San Rafael Uranium Districts have been the sites of considerable historic 

exploration drilling and production, with over 4 million pounds of uranium and 5.4 million 

pounds of vanadium produced. Although historic mining in the Tidwell Uranium District and at 

Atlas's Snow, Lucky, and Probe Mines, immediately adjacent to Magnum's land position 

boundary, has been mostly by conventional underground methods, the possibility exists that In-

situ Leaching (ISL) techniques for extraction of sandstone-hosted uranium at Deep Gold may be 

possible. To this end, preliminary feasibility work to study the viability of ISL, as well as a 

detailed hydrologic investigation, all at a cost of US$300,000, are being recommended to 

advance the project during 2009. Furthermore, a 50-hole, 50,000-foot drill program is 

recommended during 2009 to infill between widely spaced holes in order to bring some of the 

current inferred resource into the indicated category, as well as step out on mineralized holes that 

are open-ended in order to expand and ultimately define the full extent of the resource. Total cost 

of this drilling, based on an all-in cost of US$20/foot drilled, is estimated at US$1 million.

4.0  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

 

The Deep Gold Uranium Deposit is part of Magnum Uranium Corp.'s San Rafael Uranium 

Project, located in east-central Emery County, Utah (Fig. 1). Pioneer Uravan geologists 

originally discovered Deep Gold in the late 1970's and early 1980's by exploration drilling 

conducted east of the adjacent Tidwell Uranium District (Fig. 2), particularly along the eastern 

and northeastern extensions and projections of Atlas Minerals' Snow and Lucky Mines 

mineralization (Figs. 3). The deposit, located in the central portion of the San Rafael Uranium 

Project land package (Fig. 3), lies at a depth of about 775 to 850 feet below the surface. The 

Tidwell and San Rafael Uranium Districts have historically been the site of considerable 

exploration drilling and production, with greater than 4 million pounds of uranium and 5.4 

million pounds of vanadium produced (Trimble and Doelling, 1978; Gordon, 1982; Wilbanks, 

1982). 

 

Prior to the discovery, the property contained no evidence of any major workings or modern-day 

exploration activity, and no mention of mineralization or past production existed in the geologic 

literature. The area containing the deposit was considered to contain highly prospective areas 

within upper Salt Wash trunk stream channel trends as projected northeasterly from the Acerson 

Mineral Belt and channel system and Atlas Minerals' Snow and Lucky Mines (Fig. 3). Other 

than confirmation follow-up drilling by Atlas Minerals in late 1984 through 1986, no further 

historic drilling has been conducted on this property since Pioneer Uravan's discovery and 

successful drilling campaign defining it. Initial follow-up, in-fill, and offset exploration drilling 

within and along the western part of the deposit was conducted by Magnum Uranium Corp. 

during the latter half of 2007 (see Sections 12.0 and 13.0 of this Report for details).  

  

On November 19, 2006, Magnum Uranium Corp. entered into a joint venture (JV) agreement 

with EMC on their San Rafael Uranium Project area, which contains the Deep Gold deposit in 

the central part of the JV land holdings. Outlined in significant detail in Section 6.0 of this report, 

the JV land position comprises 270 BM unpatented federal lode mining claims and adjacent State 

Section 36 Mineral Lease. Per the terms of the JV agreement outlined in Section 6.0 of this 

report, Magnum has the right to earn an undivided 65% interest in the San Rafael Uranium 

Project, including the Deep Gold, by spending US$1.0 million in work on the Project and issuing 

600,000 shares of Magnum treasury stock staged over a 4 year period. Magnum has the right to 

increase its interest in the property to 80% by issuing an additional 250,000 treasury shares to 

EMC after the initial earn-in. As of February 12, 2008, Magnum spent in excess of 

US$1,000,000 in work-related expenses and issued 850,000 treasury shares meeting all the 

requirements to complete an 80% earn-in. Subsequently, and as of December 31, 2008, 

Magnum's interest increased to 100% with EMC's interest diluted to a non-participatory 2% 



 8 

NSR. Also, since the signing of the Magnum/EMC JV agreement, EMC has been acquired by 

Uranium One.  

Steve R. Sturm, of Grand Junction, Colorado, the author of this report, was retained by Magnum 

Uranium Corp. to perform a Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) National Instrument 43-

101 compliant mineral resource assessment evaluation of the Deep Gold Uranium Deposit, 

Emery County, Utah, and to provide Magnum with a technical report compliant with CSA 

National Instrument 43-101 guidelines. This report has been prepared to meet CSA National 

Instrument 43-101 standards. The report provides a detailed accounting of the geology and 43-

101 compliant resource calculation pertaining to the Deep Gold and its potential to host 

economic uranium mineralization. The overriding purpose of this report is to provide an 

independent mineral resource assessment of the Deep Gold deposit and, as warranted from the 

data at hand, recommend an exploration program to Magnum to further enhance the economic 

potential of the project. Based on the author's resource calculation results and the need for 

further in-fill and extension drilling to fully define the maximum extent and boundaries of the 

deposit, the author has recommended to Magnum a 50,000 foot drilling program in 2009, further 

detailed in Section 22.0 of this report. 

  

The data utilized as part of the basis of this evaluation and in the preparation of this report were 

supplied in part by Magnum geologists to the author. This report draws much of its content from 

both published and unpublished documents and maps, from extensive data sets pertaining to the 

property that were purchased by Magnum, and from previous project reports and interoffice 

memos detailing the results of Pioneer Uravan's drilling, follow-up drilling by Atlas Minerals, 

non-compliant resource estimates performed by Atlas Minerals, and numerous surface geologic 

studies by well known U.S. uranium industry, research, and government geologists. This report 

also draws much of its background information and content from Pancoast's 2008 NI 43-101 

compliant report concerning Magnum's immediately adjacent Down Yonder Uranium Deposit 

and resource, much of which is directly pertinent and applicable to the nearby Deep Gold 

deposit, and, as such, is used extensively throughout this report. Many Sections of this report, in 

whole or in part, are based on or drawn from Pancoast (2008), with his permission. These 

Sections are 5.0 through 12.0, and 17.0. Additionally, part of this report's content is augmented 

by the author's own observations made while conducting a trip to the property to evaluate classic 

upper Salt Wash-hosted uranium mineralization in the Tidwell Uranium District proper just west 

of the Deep Gold and to extrapolate and project the favorable Tidwell geology and 

mineralization into the Deep Gold area. The author's trip was conducted during this review while 

being retained by Magnum for the sole purpose of making recommendations for further 

exploration.  The author visited the property on February 15 and 16, 2008, further reviewing 

Magnum's San Rafael Uranium Property geology, historic uranium mines and workings, and 



 9 

historic drill sites and patterns, and Deep Gold surface geology, Pioneer Uravan and Atlas 

Minerals' drilling data, and the non-compliant historic resource calculations pertaining to it.

5.0  RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

 

The author has relied on the accuracy of the historical data as itemized and referenced in 

Sections 8.1, 8.2, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, and 19.0 of this report and upon the various project reports, 

particularly those authored by Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals geologists and mining 

engineers, as referenced in Section 23.0 of this report. This report draws much of its background 

information, graphics, and content from Pancoast's 2008 NI 43-101 compliant report concerning 

Magnum's immediately adjacent Down Yonder Uranium Deposit and resource, much of which 

is directly pertinent and applicable to the nearby Deep Gold Deposit, and, as such, is used 

extensively throughout this report. Many Sections of this report, in whole or in part, are based on 

or drawn from Pancoast (2008), with his permission. These Sections are 5.0 through 12.0, and 

17.0. 

 

The locations of the BM unpatented federal lode mining claims shown in Figure 3, the Deep 

Gold Uranium Project Land Map, constitute, in part, the basis of the Deep Gold mineral 

holdings, which are a part of Magnum's larger San Rafael Uranium Project land holdings. These 

locations and corresponding property claim maps were provided by EMC, Magnum's Joint 

Venture partner on the property, to Magnum and were relied upon, in part, as defining the 

mineral holdings of the Deep Gold in the development of this report. Furthermore, a detailed due 

diligence land check and title report corroborating the validity and legitimacy of the lands 

comprising the Magnum/EMC San Rafael Uranium Project area containing the Deep Gold was 

contracted by Magnum to Bensing and Associates, Professional Land Services, Franktown, 

Colorado, prior to Magnum consummating the JV agreement with EMC (Guinand, 2006). A 

subsequent detailed report by Guinand (2006) further delineates title of lands for an area of one 

mile around the BM claims, also requested by Magnum during the due diligence period. The 

author has reviewed the results of both reports in detail and has corroborated the accuracy of 

them through Emery County Recorder's Office and BLM land checks of his own. Also, at the 

Request of Magnum, a professional land survey of the BM claim block was performed by U.S. 

Registered Mineral Surveyor John Russell of Russell Surveying of McCall, Idaho during 

January, 2007. Results of this survey have been reviewed in detail by the author of this report, 

who is not aware of any information to suspect its accuracy and/or validity. 

     

For the purposes of computing the Deep Gold resource calculation presented in this report, the 

author has relied on historical down-hole gamma-ray drill-hole probe and drill-hole location data 

originally generated by Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals during their drilling of the property, 

most of which is now in Magnum's possession, and topographic and geographic base map data 

provided by the U.S. Geological Survey. The author has not independently verified the 

information provided from these sources, however he is not aware of any information to suspect 



 13 

that these sources are unreliable. The Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals down-hole gamma-ray 

drill-hole probe results are reported to 0.1-foot intervals. All of these results are shown on 

Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals Deep Gold drill-hole location maps, various project drill-hole 

logs, and in Atlas Minerals spreadsheets, interoffice memos, weekly reports, and documents, all 

obtained and copied by Magnum geologists.

6.0  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 

Magnum's Deep Gold Uranium Deposit lies in Section 23, T21S, R14E, in the central part of 

Magnum's larger San Rafael Uranium Project land holdings and property position, Emery 

County, Utah (Figs. 1 through 4).  In its entirety, Magnum's San Rafael Uranium Project land 

position exists as a single contiguous claim block covered by 270 "BM" unpatented federal lode 

mining claims and the contiguous State Section 36 Mineral Lease. Specifically, the BM claims 

(BM 1-104, BM 109 Fraction (new), BM 117A-120A (new), BM 123A-BM 127A (new), BM 

110-163, BM 164-168 (new), BM 169-187, BM 201-287) comprise about 5,400 acres located in 

all or parts of Sections 11-15, 22-27, and 35, T21S, R14E, and Sections 18 and 19, T21S, R15E, 

SLB & M, Emery County, Utah. The State Section 36 Mineral Lease ties into the southeastern 

corner of the claim block in T21S, R14E (Fig. 3).  

 

The BM claims all lie on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the 

State Section 36 Mineral Lease, Mineral Lease No. 49311, comprises approximately 620 acres, 

leased from the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration. This Lease is 

for a period of ten (10) years, expiring on April 29, 2014, and carries a royalty of eight percent 

(8%) for fissionable metalliferous materials and four percent (4%) for non-fissionable 

metalliferous minerals, based on the gross value of the ores produced from the leased lands and 

sold by the Lessee. The annual rental fee is US$1.00 per acre per annum.  

 

Five additional claim blocks lie adjacent to and/or partially overlap Magnum's land position 

(Fig. 3). They are: 1) 24 Victoria claims, which lie partially within the eastern boundary of the 

BM claim block, are senior to it, and are held by Drilling Consultants, Inc.; 2) 10 Hollie claims 

held in joint venture between Uranium One and Uranium Power Corporation (UPC) in the 

central part of the BM claim block, and are senior to it; 3) 33 CC claims held by Kee Nez 

Resources LLC in the southeastern part of the BM claim block, which are junior to it; 4) 20 CRP 

claims held by Quaterra Resources adjacent to the northwest part of the BM claim block, and are 

senior to it; and 5) the 17 Big claims held by Kyle Kimmerle along the west edge of the BM 

claim block that are junior to it. 

 

The western half of the Deep Gold deposit lies on Magnum/EMC JV land in the western half of 

Section 23, and the eastern half, as it is currently known to exist, lies just to the east within the 

western part of Uranium One/UPC's Hollie claims in the eastern half of Section 23 (Fig. 3; Plate 

1). Magnum owns 100% of the western part of the Deep Gold deposit on the BM claims 

(Magnum/EMC JV land) and, for the purposes of this report, I have assumed that Magnum owns 

none of the eastern part of the deposit on the Hollie claims. 

 



 15 

The majority of the Deep Gold deposit lies in the western two-thirds of Section 23, north of US 

Interstate 70. The writer was able to warrant validity of the BM claims and title to them, as well 

as those for the Hollie Claims, through discussions and the presentation of verifying land 

documents provided by Magnum's Professional Contract Land Services, Bensing and 

Associates, Inc. To the extent known, the property has no environmental liabilities. 

 

At the request of Magnum, a professional land survey of the BM claim block was performed by 

U.S. Registered Mineral Surveyor John Russell of Russell Surveying of McCall, Idaho during 

January 2007. This survey was performed to accurately establish the boundaries of Magnum's 

BM claim land holdings, as well as the outer boundary of the Hollie, CRP, Victoria, CC, and Big 

claim blocks mentioned above and any other claim blocks that might be overlapping Magnum's 

BM claim block. This work was performed in order to have a firm and legal basis for locating 

future drill sites on the Magnum/EMC (BM Claims) portion of the Deep Gold deposit, as well as 

locate the exact boundary between the BM and Hollie claims. Following from the results of the 

survey, additional claims (BM 109 Fraction, and BM 164-168) were staked by Russell on 

January 10 and 11, 2007 and filed with the Emery County Recorder's Office on January 31
st
 and 

with the BLM on February 26
th

. Additionally, fractions found on BM claims land just south of 

the Hollie claims were staked and filed for Magnum by Russell in November, 2007. 

 

The BM claims were originally staked by EMC in groups on January 7-11, February 8, and 

September 9, 2005, and March 15, 2006, and the Section 36 State Mineral Lease was obtained by 

William M. Sheriff from the State of Utah on April 4, 2004. An assignment was made from 

Sheriff to EMC Utah Inc. on January 6, 2006, assigning an undivided 100% interest in the Lease. 

As a result of Magnum's interest in the uranium potential of the land within the BM claim block, 

and particularly of the Deep Gold deposit, Magnum approached EMC in 2006 to see if it might 

be interested in joint venturing the property in order to move it forward. EMC agreed and a 

formal JV arrangement between the two companies was consummated on November 19, 2006. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Magnum can earn an undivided 65% interest in the property 

by fulfilling the requirements of spending US$1.0 million in work on the San Rafael Uranium 

Project containing the Deep Gold and issuing 600,000 shares of treasury stock staged over a four 

year period. Magnum's first year obligation is US$200,000 in work and issuance of 150,000 

treasury shares. Magnum has the right to increase its interest in the property to 80% by issuing an 

additional 250,000 treasury shares to EMC after the initial earn-in. As of February 12, 2008, 

Magnum spent in excess of US$1,000,000 in work-related expenses and issued 850,000 treasury 

shares meeting all the requirements to complete an 80% earn-in. Subsequently, and of December 

31, 2008, Magnum's interest increased to 100% based on additional exploration expenditures 

and with EMC's interest diluted to a non-participatory 2% NSR. Also, since the signing of the 

Magnum/EMC JV agreement, EMC has been acquired by Uranium One.

The BLM is the permitting agency for all work-related activities conducted on Magnum's BLM 

ground (BM claims area).

7.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 

INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

The property is located on the eastern side of the San Rafael Swell in east-central Utah, 

approximately 140 air miles southeast of Salt Lake City (Fig. 1). The little desert community of 

Green River, Utah is located about ten miles to the east (Fig. 2).  In a general sense, Magnum's 

greater San Rafael Uranium Project property position lies within a wedge-shaped area, roughly 

bound along its northeast edge by U.S. Highway 6-50 and Interstate 70 on the southeast (Fig. 2).  

 

Access to the Deep Gold is excellent and is gained by traveling ten miles southwest of Green 

River on Interstate 70 to the Hanksville Exit (Exit 147) and then turning north onto Emery 

County Road EM 1029, a reasonably well-maintained gravel road. This road leads into the heart 

of the BM claim block and from there access is gained by taking a well marked dirt road 

traversing parts of Sections 23 and 24 that leads to the U.S. Geological Survey "Buckmaster" 

bench mark. The eastern part of the deposit is within the Hollie Claim block on the upper bench 

that the access road traverses, and the western part of the deposit is within the BM claims just to 

the west on the next lower bench. A sharp escarpment basically separates the eastern and western 

parts of the deposit which the access road partly traverses the edge of on its way to the bench 

mark.  

 

Concerning additional local access features, U.S. Highway 6-50 crosses just north of the greater 

San Rafael Uranium Project area in a northwesterly direction and is roughly paralleled by the 

regional railroad line. Access to the property is generally good year around, except for periods of 

heavy snowstorms during December through February and increased monsoon rains and summer 

cloudburst storms during August through October. Access for drilling and other exploration 

activity is excellent, except during occasional heavy rainy periods which create heavy flash 

flooding and roads mudding-up and becoming impassable due to the high clay content of the soil 

underlying them.  

 

Climate in the project area is dry, semi-arid to arid, typical of Colorado Plateau physiography 

that extends throughout much of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. Winters are 

relatively cold, with temperatures as low as 20º below zero Fahrenheit and nominal snowfalls of 

4 to 8 inches in the months of December and January. Summer daytime temperatures can reach a 

maximum of 105º Fahrenheit, making the project area dry and hot, particularly in late summer. 

Precipitation, on average and as expected in a desert environment, ranges from roughly 0.5 inch 

to 1 inch per month, resulting in 5 to 7 inches per year. The San Rafael Uranium District lies in 

the rain shadow of the San Rafael Reef just to the west and receives less precipitation than the 

Swell or the area immediately to the east near the town of Green River.  



 18 

 

This part of the Colorado Plateau containing the project area is expressed through topography 

that is characterized by meandering drainages, flat- to gently-dipping mesas and basins with 

abrupt scarp breaks and edges, and low relief (Plate 2). Topography of the area is gentle to 

moderate, with the overall relief being less than 200 feet. The area specific to the Deep Gold 

exists as two relatively flat, sage brush-covered benches, the lower one containing the western 

half of the deposit, and the upper one containing the eastern half, separated by an abrupt north-

trending escarpment (Plate 3). Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,400 feet, with the area cut by 

scattered intermittent, arroyos. This topography/physiography is in sharp contrast to the area 

immediately to the west that includes a major physiographic/geologic feature, the San Rafael 

Swell, where steeply dipping rock units, hogbacks, flatirons, steep sided mesas, and cliff fronts 

dominate the landscape, creating spectacular scenery. At the extreme eastern edge of the Swell, 

resistant rocks form a prominent ridge or escarpment known as the San Rafael Reef (Plate 4).  

 

The dominant vegetative pattern in the area is mostly scattered low brush with large areas of bare 

ground and patches of grass. Vegetation comprises mostly xerophytic and phreatophytic desert 

species dominated by grasses, sagebrush, greasewood, rabbit brush, shadscale, blackbrush, 

mormon tea, leadbush, and prickly pear cactus. Principal bird and animal species found include 

jackrabbits, coyotes, ground rodents, deer, owls, and raptors. Seasonal use of land for grazing is 

possible, but lack of surface water and vegetation in the summer months precludes maintaining 

any livestock without irrigation.  

 

Concerning local water sources, the Green and San Rafael Rivers are the only perennial 

drainages that flow through the general area, but they do not cross or cut through the project area 

(Fig. 2). Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals internal reports and drill logs mention the water 

table at a depth of approximately 500 to 800 feet below the surface, suggesting a possible source 

for process water that may not be as controversial as the above mentioned rivers and serve as less 

impact concerning the use of scarce and valuable surface water in the region. 

 

The San Rafael Uranium District is located in east-central Emery County, which is 

predominantly made up of small rural communities of ranchers and farmers. County population 

is about 10,700, the county seat is Castle Dale, and the largest city in the county is Huntington. 

The closest infrastructure to the Deep Gold deposit area is the small rural community and nearby 

town of Green River (population 973), located approximately ten miles to the east and just north 

of Interstate 70 (Figs. 1 and 2). Here, restaurants, fast-food drive-ins, motels (Best Western and 

Holiday Inn), a post office, and gas stations line the city's main street. The town serves as a 

relatively isolated, but major transportation center and hub for the railroad and Interstate 70, and 

also as a link to nearby U.S. Highway 6-50 and its junction with Interstate 70. 

 



 19 

Power is present in the form of a major transmission line from Green River to Price that crosses 

the northeast corner of the BM claim block, only about one mile north of the Deep Gold deposit.

8.0  HISTORY 

8.1  San Rafael Uranium District History 

 

Magnum's Deep Gold Uranium Deposit is located in the San Rafael Uranium District (Green 

River District), which has been sporadically mined and explored for uranium and vanadium since 

1880 (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). The uranium-vanadium deposits were first discovered in Salt 

Wash Member outcrops by sheepherders in 1880 near what is classically termed the Tidwell 

Mineral Belt. The original claims were located by Judge J.W. Warf of Price, Utah, about 1 mile 

north of the present position of Interstate 70 (Fig. 2). Subsequently, ore was shipped to Germany 

and Europe in the early part of the 20th century (1900 to 1911), and minor and sporadic 

exploration and production continued up until 1948 (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). 

 

In 1948, uranium prices rose, resulting in renewed exploration and the discovery of a number of 

shallow, 40-foot deep orebodies. From 1948 to 1956 production increased rapidly to 60,584 tons 

having an average grade of 0.25% U3O8 and 0.44% V2O5. In 1954, the U.S. Atomic Energy 

Commission (AEC) drilled six deep holes in the center of the Tidwell Mineral Belt and 

intersected ore, with private industry subsequently continuing with deeper drilling and 

discovering larger orebodies at depths exceeding 300 feet. Shafts were sunk and orebodies were 

found to increase in size downdip to the east from the area where the earlier discoveries had been 

made. Subsequent mine development continued to outline strings or clusters of orebodies whose 

total content was 10,000 tons or greater. New mines continued to be developed until 1958 when 

the U.S. Government, the major buyer for uranium, modified its policy with the AEC placing 

limitations on uranium procurement. Production gradually decreased until 1971 when all mining 

ceased in the San Rafael Uranium District. Much of this historic production came from mines 

within and adjacent to the western part of Magnum's land holdings, all hosted in upper Salt 

Wash Member sandstone just updip from the same rock unit hosting mineralization at Deep 

Gold.  

 

In the late 1960's, the electric-generating industry started to regard nuclear energy as a viable 

power source for the masses and turned its attention to the exploration for and development of it. 

Exploration in the District, in the form of drilling, was renewed and holes to depths of 1,100 feet 

extended the area of discoveries downdip and east of the existing mines. In 1972, a new orebody 

was discovered and drilled out at about 600 feet, and the Snow shaft was sunk on it by Atlas 

Minerals in 1973. The Snow, along with the Probe, both of which were worked by Atlas until 

1982, turned out to be two of the largest mines and biggest producers in the District (Fig. 3; 

Wilbanks, 1982), the Snow producing 650,292 pounds of U3O8 at an average grade of 0.188% 

U3O8 and the Probe producing 293,985 pounds of U3O8 at an average grade of 0.186% U3O8 



 21 

(Wilbanks, 1982). Exploratory drilling east of the main Tidwell area and northeast of the 

Acerson Mineral Belt and along the northeast extension of the Snow and Lucky Mines 

mineralization outlined several mineralized zones and deposits, one of which turned out to be the 

Deep Gold deposit discovered by Pioneer Uravan drilling during 1979 through 1981 (Figs. 2 

through 4). Production in the District pretty much ceased with the closure of the Snow and the 

Probe in 1982, both of which, combined, produced nearly 1 million pounds of U3O8. 

 

To date, in excess of 4.0 million pounds of uranium and 5.4 million pounds of vanadium have 

been produced from over fifty mines in the San Rafael Uranium District, with most of the ore 

mined during the 1950's and 1970's to early 1980's uranium booms (Trimble and Doelling, 

1978; Wilbanks, 1982). During the latter time period, several properties in the area were the 

subject of feasibility studies and some were taken to production. Some of the companies and 

governmental organizations conducting work in the District during these time periods include 

Atlas Minerals, Conoco, Union Carbide, Four Corners Uranium, Anaconda, Santa Fe Nuclear, 

Pioneer Uravan, Utah Geological and Mineral Survey, and the AEC. Property acquisition and/or 

exploration in the area have recently been initiated by Magnum, EMC, Uranium One, Drilling 

Consultants, Inc., Quaterra Resources, and UPC. 

 

8.2  Deep Gold Uranium Deposit History         

 

Information in Magnum's possession indicates that the Deep Gold Uranium Deposit was 

originally discovered in the late 1970's and early 1980's as a result of exploration drilling 

conducted by Pioneer Uravan, Inc. just east of the main producing Tidwell District area and 

northeast of the Acerson Mineral Belt. The area containing the deposit was considered highly 

prospective within upper Salt Wash trunk stream channel trends as projected northeastward as an 

extension of Atlas Minerals' Snow and Lucky Mines' uranium mineralization and paleo channel 

system(s) (Fig. 3). This favorability was extended just to the east and northeast into the central 

part of Section 23 where both moderate to large size deposits were thought to occur and where 

Pioneer Uravan's drilling ultimately led to the Deep Gold discovery. In essence, the Deep Gold 

deposit represents the downdip and northeasterly extension of the Snow and Lucky Mines' 

uranium mineralization and paleo-stream channel trend(s). 

 

In order for the reader to gain a general chronological perspective and background on Deep 

Gold's exploration history, it is important to review some of the main observations made by 

project geologists, reference certain historic geologic reports and maps produced by Pioneer 

Uravan, Inc. and Atlas Minerals, and present the non-compliant resource estimates made by 

Atlas Minerals contained in internal company reports. Although Magnum and the author 

consider the estimates to be historically relevant and significant, it is acknowledged that they do 

not comply with the guidelines of NI 43-101 and they are not being treated as such.   



 22 

 

The earliest reference to the Deep Gold in Magnum's possession is a detailed location map of 

holes drilled by Pioneer Uravan, Inc. during the time period 1979 through 1981 (Casey, 1981). A 

detailed analysis of this map reveals that 247 holes comprising 235,788 feet of drilling were 

placed to test the target during this time period. Of this total, 44,804 feet in 48 holes were drilled 

in 1979, 150,904 feet in 158 holes were drilled in 1980, and 40,080 feet in 41 holes were drilled 

in 1981. Hole depth averaged approximately 960 feet, with mineralization intersected in the 

upper sandstone sequence of the Salt Wash Member of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation at 

depths of generally between 775 and 850 feet (Casey, 1981). Water was intersected at depths 

ranging from 500 to 800 feet below the surface as noted in some of the drill logs in Magnum's 

possession. Holes were generally spaced 100 feet apart. Comments made in an Atlas Minerals 

Internal Office Memo indicate that Pioneer spent approximately US$1 million on their drilling at 

Deep Gold (Smith, 1984).  

 

In 1984, Atlas Minerals acquired Deep Gold from Pioneer Uravan, Inc., which was part of a 608 

unpatented lode mining claim land package located east of and adjacent to existing claims 

containing the Probe, Snow, and Lucky orebodies (Fig. 3). Atlas geologists recognized that a 

number of mineralized pods were present on Deep Gold and that the paleodepositional and 

mineralization trends are both easterly and northeasterly as extensions of the Snow and Lucky 

Mines (Hesse, 1984). During 1984 through 1986, Atlas drilled 52 conventional holes on the 

Deep Gold in Section 23 for a total of 52,295 feet (Hesse, 1984; Berggren, 1985; Wham, 1986). 

Of this total, 24,515 feet in 25 holes were drilled in 1984, 21,560 feet in 21 holes were drilled in 

1985, and 6,220 feet in 6 holes were drilled in 1986. Many of Atlas' holes were placed to extend 

Pioneer Uravan drill fences and were oriented perpendicular (northwest to southeast) to 

northeasterly mineralized trends, with hole spacing generally averaging 200 feet.  Similar to 

Pioneer Uravan logs, Atlas logs show that water was encountered at depths ranging from 400 to 

825 feet deep in most of the holes (Henkelman, 1984; Price, 1984 through 1986). Average hole 

depth was approximately 1,000 feet. Reference is also made in Atlas Minerals Affidavits of 

Assessment that the actual underlying mineral claimant for the land containing the Deep Gold 

was Santa Fe Nuclear, who also appears to be the underlying claimant when Pioneer Uravan 

drilled the deposit. It is also noted in an Atlas summary sheet concerning the property that the 

claims carried a 12% royalty commencing on production, with a US$20,000 advanced minimum 

royalty that was due to Santa Fe Nuclear on February 16
th

 of each year.  

 

According to detailed information contained in an internal Atlas Office Memo authored by Smith 

(1984), Atlas performed a resource calculation for the Deep Gold deposit in March of 1984 prior 

to its initial drilling on the property.  The report describes a reasonably detailed 43-101 non-

compliant resource estimate for the Deep Gold based on 239 Pioneer Uravan holes, 122 of which 

Atlas considered to be mineralized using a cutoff of 4.0' @ 0.15% U3O8. A 25-foot radius or 



 23 

area of influence was given to each hole, considered by Atlas and the author to be a conservative 

approach. In total, the resource comprises 261,300 pounds of U3O8 in 57,555 tons of mineralized 

material at an average grade of 0.227%, with the tons number arrived at by the author back-

calculating. Average thickness of mineralization is given at 3.4 feet. No breakdown was made of 

this estimate as to "possible," "indicated," or "inferred" resources. None of the foregoing is 

considered to be classified as a reserve estimate based on the author's following statement: 

 

Although the terms "reserve" and "resource" used above and elsewhere in this report, when 

historical information is discussed, were estimates produced by Atlas Minerals, they are not to 

be relied upon in this report under the definitions required by National Instrument 43-101. 

The statements of tonnage and grade above and below are therefore classified herein for the 

reader to consider as exploration information of historical significance only and only to reflect 

an order of magnitude of the size and grade of the Deep Gold deposit. The relevance and 

reliability of the tonnage and grade defined in the historical estimates contained in this report 

are based on extensive sampling by rotary and core drilling, and by down-hole gamma-ray 

logging, carried out by Pioneer Uravan, Inc. and Atlas Minerals, senior minerals and/or 

mining companies, with significant exploration and/or production experience. A Qualified 

person (QP), the author of this report, has performed an independent recalculation of the 

tonnages and grades claimed by all the previously referenced work, which is presented in 

Section 19.0 of this report, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates. 

 

Atlas further states that the deposit had attractive thickness and grade, but that a uranium price of 

US$40 per pound would be necessary to justify sinking a shaft to mine it. As an alternative, 

Atlas geologists suggested the possibility that the property could be accessed through the nearby 

Probe shaft, thus reducing mining costs to below US$40 per pound (Smith, 1984). 

 

Atlas performed a second 43-101 non-compliant resource calculation on Deep Gold in May of 

1985 (Price, 1985), just subsequent to their 1985 drilling campaign. The resource was given in 

terms of pounds of U3O8 drilled out by Pioneer Uravan prior to Atlas' drilling, along with the 

number of pounds added as a result of the Atlas drilling. The calculation indicates an historic 

resource of 649,917 pounds U3O8 contained in 100,988 tons of material at an average grade of 

0.322% U3O8. Within this total, Pioneer's drilling resulted in 519,811 pounds of U3O8 contained 

in 78,548 tons of material, and Atlas' drilling resulted in adding 130,106 pounds of U3O8 in 

22,440 tons of material. Again, the reader is cautioned that this historic resource estimate is not 

qualified under and does not meet current 43-101 guidelines, and Magnum and the author are not 

treating it as such. It is being presented here for historic information and reference purposes only.        

 

No information is available to the author regarding ownership of the western part of the Deep 

Gold deposit in the BM claims area during the period 1986 to 2004. As previously mentioned in 



 24 

Section 6.0 of this report, EMC staked the BM claims in 2005 and 2006, with no exploration or 

development work conducted on the property by EMC. EMC lease-optioned its entire San Rafael 

Uranium Property land holdings, including the Deep Gold, to Glen Hawk Minerals, Ltd., on June 

20th, 2005. After conducting no work on the property, and as a result of financial difficulties and 

a desire to move into gold exploration, Glen Hawk returned the property to EMC only a year 

later in early June of 2006. As a result of Magnum's interest in the uranium potential of the land 

within the BM claim block, and particularly of the Deep Gold deposit in Section 23, Magnum 

approached EMC in 2006 to see if it might be interested in joint venturing the property in order 

to move it forward. EMC agreed and a formal JV arrangement between the two companies was 

consummated on November 19, 2006.  

 

Magnum has earned an undivided 100% interest in the entire San Rafael property position, 

substantially ahead of schedule, by virtue of the aggressive exploration drilling program it 

conducted during 2007-2008. To date, no production has come from Deep Gold. 

 

8.3  Deep Gold Uranium Deposit Ownership History         

 

Concerning the eastern side of the deposit, which lies on the Hollie Claim block (Hollie 1 

through 10  claims), little is known about it's ownership prior to being controlled by U.S. Energy 

Corp. and its partner Crested Corp. in the 2000's. However, it is known that on May 6, 2006, 

U.S. Energy Corp. and Crested (USE Parties) entered into a 50%-50% JV agreement with 

Uranium Power Corp. on their Green River North Property, i.e., Hollie 1 through 10 unpatented 

lode mining claims, as per certain work and share requirements outlined in the agreement. 

Subsequently, on April 30, 2007, Uranium One Inc. completed the purchase of a package of 

uranium properties from U.S. Energy Corp., which included the purchase of the Shootaring 

Canyon uranium mill in Utah, as well as the contractual rights with Uranium Power Corp, which 

included the Hollie Claim block. As a result, UPC/Uranium One owns that portion of the Deep 

Gold deposit located on the Hollie claims (which ownership, for the purposes of this report, has 

been assumed not to be subject to area of interest provisions in favor of Magnum) and Magnum 

owns that portion of the deposit located on the BM claims (Magnum Uranium Corp's and 

Energy Metal Corp's JV lands).

9.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

9.1  Regional – San Rafael Uranium District Geology 

 

The property is located in a moderate sized topographic and structural low, locally known as the 

Green River Desert. Structurally, this low can be considered a narrow southern extension of the 

Uinta Basin. Several local features of the Colorado Plateau surround the area. The area is 

bounded on the west by the San Rafael Swell, a large assymetrical doubly plunging anticline, 

and on the east by the Paradox Basin/Paradox Fold and Fault Belt. The Nequoia Arch is located 

immediately to the south and to the north the Green River Desert merges with the larger Uinta 

Basin, although it is separated from the latter by the northwest-trending Book Cliffs (Fig. 5). 

 

Stratigraphically, all exposed consolidated rock units within the boundaries of the San Rafael 

Uranium District area are sedimentary formations deposited during the Mesozoic era (Trimble 

and Doelling, 1978). The oldest unit is the Triassic Moenkopi Formation which underlies the 

Chinle, Wingate, and Kayenta Formations. Jurassic rocks are, in ascending order, the Navajo, 

Carmel, Entrada, Curtis, Summerville, and Morrison Formations. The Cretaceous rocks, also in 

ascending order, include the Cedar Mountain and Dakota Formations, and members of the 

Mancos Shale. Alluvial and colluvial deposits of Quaternary age are scattered throughout the 

District. The Triassic rocks are both marine and continental in origin, whereas the Jurassic rocks 

are for the most part non-marine and most of the Cretaceous rocks are marine. A stratigraphic 

column briefly describing the characteristics of the sedimentary rocks from the Moenkopi 

through the Mancos Shale in the San Rafael Uranium District is given as Figure 6. This report is 

only concerned with those rock units penetrated by the historic drilling in the Deep Gold 

Uranium Deposit area (see Section 9.2 below), with the objective of describing the Salt Wash 

Member of the Jurassic Morrison Formation, host to the uranium mineralization, in greater 

detail. For a more comprehensive description of the stratigraphy of the Green River area, the 

reader is referred to "Geology of the Green River Mining District," by Young and others, 1960. 

The reader is also referred to Figure 7 of this report, Geologic Map of the San Rafael Uranium 

District and Deep Gold Uranium Project, with special reference to the geology in the area of the 

Deep Gold. 

 

The San Rafael District is near the confluence of three tectonic divisions; the San Rafael Swell, 

the Uinta Basin, and the Paradox Fold and Fault Belt (Fig. 5). The San Rafael Swell is a broad 

uplift whose steep east limb, the San Rafael monocline, forms the west boundary of the District. 

The Uinta Basin is to the north where its southern boundary is defined by the Book Cliffs 

escarpment. The strata beneath the cliffs dip gently northward or northeastward toward the center 

of the Basin. To the south the dip of outcrops is influenced by the Nequoia Arch, an arm of the 



 26 

Monument Uplift. An additional anticlinal structure, the Green River nose or anticline, is just 

east of the District (Fig. 5). The influence of these structures has produced a broad, shallow, 

northeast plunging syncline known as the Acerson Trough (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). The 

San Rafael District centers mostly on the northwest flank of this master structure, the axis of 

which trends N25ºE, and which also appears to be the main control to the District's paleo-stream 

channel trends and development for uranium mineralization at the Deep Gold. 

 

9.2  Local – Deep Gold Uranium Deposit Geology 

 

As mentioned above, this report is only concerned with those rock units intersected by Pioneer 

Uravan's and Atlas Minerals' historic drilling and Magnum's 2007 drilling in the area of the 

Deep Gold deposit, Section 23, with the objective of describing the main host rock, the Salt 

Wash Member of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, in greatest detail (Fig. 6; Plate 5). 

 

Summerville Formation (Upper Jurassic) 

The Summerville is the oldest Formation encountered in the drilling programs and consists of 

thin, even-bedded mudstone and siltstone. The Formation has a characteristically reddish-brown 

color, which is easily distinguished from the redder mudstones and siltstones that generally occur 

in the overlying lower Salt Wash. Its origin is considered marginal marine and it averages 150 

feet thick. Only the top beds immediately below the lower Salt Wash sands were penetrated by 

selected holes. 

 

Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic) 

The Morrison is a complex non-marine unit that is subdivided into two members, the upper 

Brushy Basin and the lower Salt Wash (Figs. 6 and 7). The Salt Wash consists of channel and 

floodplain deposits and contains the known uranium deposits in the San Rafael Uranium District, 

including the Deep Gold (Plate 5).  The Brushy Basin is composed mostly of floodplain-type 

deposits and decomposed ash. 

 

Salt Wash Member:  

The Salt Wash Member averages 220 feet thick in the Atlas Snow and Lucky Mines and Section 

23 area. It is composed predominantly of fine- to medium-grained sandstone interbedded with 

thin mudstone, claystone, and siltstone. Occasional conglomeratic sandstone is also present. 

 

According to the results of the drilling, the Salt Wash contains a lower unit consisting of 

claystone, mudstone, siltstone, sandstone lenses, and occasional thin limestone. A persistent 

gypsum bed at the base of the Salt Wash was encountered throughout the area drilled. Trimble 



 27 

and Doelling (1978) include this gypsum bed as the very top of the underling Summerville 

Formation described above. They mention that the upper foot of the bed contains abundant jasper 

nodules, possibly signifying the development of an old soil horizon. In some places in the 

District, the Salt Wash fills channels cut into this gypsum horizon, whereas in others the 

channels completely remove the gypsum, indicating a disconformity at the Salt Wash – 

Summerville contact. The upper part of the Salt Wash, where the deposits occur, 

characteristically contains relatively thick channel-type sandstones and conglomerates with thin 

interbedded mudstones (Plate 5). In places, carbonaceous trash is abundant in the upper Salt 

Wash sands and was encountered in varying amounts in most of the sands. 

 

The Salt Wash sands are the result of fluvial processes that created a broad, regional alluvial 

plain deposited by northeast-flowing streams. Wentworth (1970) and Trimble and Doelling 

(1978) proposed the source of the sediments lay to the south, southwest, and west in Arizona, 

western Utah, or eastern Nevada. Trimble and Doelling (1978) further mention that sediment 

deposition is thought to have been by intermittent shifting streams in possible semiarid 

environments. Aggrading streams that deposited the early Salt Wash Member were small and 

filled small channels. As time progressed, the size of the streams increased until, at the top of the 

member, a thick, broad accumulation of partly conglomeratic channel sands was deposited. 

These larger streams carried much woody plant and organic debris acting as important reductant 

material and loci for the concentration of uranium. 

 

Brushy Basin Member:  

Drilling results show the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison averages 350-feet thick in the 

area of the Deep Gold deposit. The drilling results also show this Member to mainly consist of 

variegated mudstones and claystones, with variable lesser amounts of siltstone, sandstone, and 

loosely cemented conglomerate. The dominant colors are maroon to reddish-brown, with shades 

of green, gray, and purple not uncommon (Plate 6). The claystones in the unit generally consist 

of bentonite, which formed by the decomposition of volcanic ash, and which some workers 

believe is the source of the uranium hosted in the underlying Salt Wash sandstone at the Deep 

Gold deposit and other deposits throughout the District (Stokes, 1967; Trimble and Doelling, 

1978). 

 

According to Trimble and Doelling (1978), the time of Brushy Basin deposition was marked by 

streams that became sluggish and channel deposition thinner and less common. They also 

mention that discontinuous limestones in the Member indicate the formation of shallow lakes on 

the low interfluve floodplain areas, and that the high volcanic ash content in claystones, 

mudstones, and siltstones comprising most of the Member, indicates nearby volcanic activity. 

 



 28 

The Brushy Basin Member is considered latest Jurassic in age, and its upper contact with the 

overlying Cedar Mountain Formation, described below, has been designated as the boundary 

between the Jurassic and Cretaceous beds (Stokes, 1952). 

 

Cedar Mountain Formation – (Lower Cretaceous) 

The Cedar Mountain Formation is divided into two Members in the San Rafael Uranium District, 

the basal Buckhorn Conglomerate and an Upper Shale (Figs. 6 and 7). In the District, exposures 

of the Buckhorn are discontinuous, attaining a maximum thickness of 30 feet in the north and 

diminishing near the south, where it pinches out (Fig. 7). Exposures of the Upper Shale are 

continuous over the length of the District, attaining a maximum width of over 3 miles near the 

south end. The Buckhorn Conglomerate rests unconformably on the Brushy Basin Member of 

the Morrison Formation described above and contains mostly gray, black, and tan chert and 

quartzite pebbles and cobbles. In places where the Buckhorn crops out, particularly in 

Buckmaster Draw, slopes are strewn with large blocks of the conglomerate (Fig. 7; Plate 6). The 

overlying Upper Shale is similar to the Brushy Basin, with lithologies of siltstone, shale, 

mudstone, sandstone, and limestone, but colors are more faded to a gray and the banding is less 

distinct (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). The siltstones, shales, and mudstones are mostly 

bentonitic and form the bulk of the Member.  

 

Similar to Magnum's drilling results at Deep Gold, results of Conoco's 1970's drilling of the 

nearby Down Yonder uranium deposit in State Section 36, also within Magnum's JV land 

holdings, confirm the similarity of Upper Shale Member beds of the Cedar Mountain with the 

underlying Brushy Basin, but, as noted by Trimble and Doelling (1978) and as referenced above, 

are lighter in color and quite difficult to differentiate in the subsurface (Wentworth, 1970). 

Conoco geologists believed that these paler colors are due to bleaching by swamp waters. 

Wentworth (1970) further states that Conoco geologists applied the term Cedar Mountain to 

designate the beds between the top of the Brushy Basin and the base of the Mancos in their 

drilling at Down Yonder, and believed that the Cedar Mountain should be included with the 

Brushy Basin in any formal rock unit scheme. The Cedar Mountain Formation was deposited in 

the same fluvial and lacustrine environments responsible for the Brushy Basin Member of the 

Morrison (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). 

 

Mancos Shale – (Upper Cretaceous) 

The Mancos Shale is a thick calcareous marine unit that forms the surface of much of the Green 

River Desert and covers most of the eastern part of the San Rafael Uranium District (Figs. 6 and 

7; Plate 7). Classically, the Mancos is divided into five Members, which, in ascending order, are 

the Tununk Shale, Ferron Sandstone, Blue Gate Shale, Emery Sandstone, and Masuk Shale 

(Trimble and Doelling, 1978). In the District and particularly in the Deep Gold deposit area, only 



 29 

the lower three Members are present (Wentworth 1970). The Ferron Sandstone Member, a thin 

shaly sandstone unit, separates monotonous blue gray calcareous Blue Gate Member shales from 

lithologically similar colored shales of the underlying Tununk Member. Furthermore, although 

Conoco geologists recognized the stratigraphically highest Member in the nearby Down Yonder 

deposit area as the Blue Gate and referred to it as such in their drilling (Wentworth, 1970), 

Trimble and Doelling (1978) refer to this shale as the Upper Mancos Shale. Thickness of the 

Tununk is 350 to 400 feet, the Ferron 20 to 30 feet, and the Blue Gate 600 feet plus in the 

District. Pioneer Uravan's, Atlas Minerals', and Magnum's drill holes were sited within the 

Tununk in the western or San Rafael part of the deposit and Pioneer Uravan's and Atlas 

Minerals' holes within the Ferron and Blue Gate (Upper Mancos Shale) in the eastern or Hollie 

part. 

 

Structure In and Around the Deep Gold Uranium Deposit Area 

Beds in the Deep Gold deposit area dip gently, approximately 3º, to the northeast toward the 

center of the Green River Desert structural low. Near the outside boundaries of the Green River 

Desert the dips increase in magnitude, especially along its west edge near the fringe of the San 

Rafael Swell, where they are up to 11º. Ground water occurrences in the basin are roughly 

parallel to the structure, with the younger aquifers successively becoming saturated toward its 

center (Wentworth, 1970). Numerous northwest-striking normal faults traverse the San Rafael 

Uranium District that can be traced southeasterly into the Paradox Fold and Fault Belt (Figs. 5 

and 7; Trimble and Doelling, 1978). These faults are speculated to be of Laramide or post-

Laramide age and, along with subsidiary fractures, may have locally controlled uranium 

accumulation.

10.0  DEPOSIT TYPES AND EXPLORATION MODEL 

 

The exploration target or deposit type being explored for by Magnum at the Deep Gold deposit is 

the peneconcordant, channel-controlled, trend type. Specifically, this deposit type matches the 

recognition criteria of Sandstone Type Uranium Deposits Class 240, Subclass 243 – Channel-

Controlled Peneconcordant Sandstone-Type Deposits – as defined by Austin and D'Andrea 

(1978) for the United States Department of Energy's (USDOE) National Uranium Resource 

Evaluation (NURE) Program conducted in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Austin and 

D'Andrea's classification work and widely established recognition criteria regarding geologic 

environments favorable for sandstone-type deposits are part of the larger uranium deposit 

classification manual and classic treatise entitled "Geologic Characteristics of Environments 

Favorable for Uranium Deposits." This publication was written and compiled by Bendix Field 

Engineering Corporation geologists for the USDOE in 1978 (Mickle and Mathews, eds.) and still 

serves as a major working classification manual for many geologists exploring for all types of 

uranium deposits throughout the United States and other parts of the world. 

 

Peneconcordant uranium deposits in sandstones are essentially stratabound deposits which do not 

normally exhibit the continuous and sharp boundary between altered and unaltered ground 

commonly found in roll front-type deposits. This deposit class includes deposits in which altered 

and unaltered ground may be clearly distinguishable, as in parts of the Uravan Mineral Belt, 

Colorado, and those in which the distinction, if it exists, is not readily evident, as at Ambrosia 

Lake, New Mexico. Again referring to Austin and D'Andrea's sandstone-type deposit 

classification system, peneconcordant deposits are broken down into Subclass 243, those hosted 

by distinct, easily recognized channels, as is the Deep Gold and the other uranium deposits in the 

San Rafael Uranium District, and Subclass 244, those deposits in which channel control is not as 

evident. 

 

Major recognition criteria and definitive geological characteristics of peneconcordant, channel-

controlled, trend-type uranium deposits, taken from Austin and D'Andrea (1978) and many of 

which are present at the Deep Gold deposit as determined by the results of Pioneer Uravan's and 

Atlas Minerals' historic drilling and Magnum's 2007 drilling, are listed below. Some criteria are 

also diagrammatically shown in Figure 4, a drawing taken from Trimble and Doelling (1978), 

with special reference to the Acerson Trough area's trunk channel stream systems. Uranium 

mineralization in the San Rafael Uranium District and most importantly at the Deep Gold is 

peneconcordant and stratabound, occurring in the upper continuous sandstone unit of the Salt 

Wash Member of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation.  It was produced by several trunk 

streams which entered the area from the south, which included the Tidwell, Acerson, and Sahara 

trunk channel stream systems containing the District's deposits. 



 31 

 

 Peneconcordant deposits are stratabound uranium deposits that occur in discrete, easily 

recognized paleo-stream channels scoured and eroded into underlying strata and rocks; 

sedimentary structures, especially scours and channel contacts, are ore controls, and 

faults, fractures, synclines, and troughs serve to control drainage location and 

development; host rocks have developed in a braided stream or trunk stream channel 

network and alluvial fan/flood plain environment; 

 

 Sandstone host rocks are commonly first-cycle sediments that are either feldspathic or 

arkosic, or are quartz- and chert-grain rich depending on provenance; host rocks range 

from boulder conglomerates to siltstones, with medium- to coarse-grained sandstones the 

most common; bedding tends to be lenticular, typical of fluvial deposits, with many 

deposits occurring in distinct sinuous and braided channel network forms; ore trends are 

parallel to the depositional trends of the host rock; some of the best mineralization occurs 

on the edges of thicker channels where mudstone-sandstone ratios increase and reach 

equality; 

 

 The source of the uranium is postulated to be tuffaceous shales or tuffaceous volcanic 

rocks overlying the favorable sedimentary host rocks; uranium is leached from the 

overlying shales and/or tuffs and redeposited in the underlying sandstones; the most 

common primary uranium minerals found in unoxidized material are uraninite and 

coffinite, and the most common primary vanadium mineral is montroseite; common 

secondary (oxidized) minerals include tyuyamunite and corvusite; commonly associated 

sulfides include pyrite and marcasite (FeS2); 

 

 The dominant reductant for the ore is carbonized "trash"; fossil wood, leaves, vegetative 

matter, large and small plant remains, lignite, asphaltite, logs, and fine carbonaceous 

matter are the loci for the deposition of uranium; 

  

 Geometry of deposits ranges from tabular to lenticular to sinuous, with their long axes 

aligned along the trend of the paleo channel; ore thickens and thins with the stratigraphic 

structures, channel scours, mudstone-sandstone ratios, and according to the amount of 

carbonaceous material present, and may occur either as a single body or as a cluster of 

bodies, with larger bodies usually comprising a number of connected pods; where 

clustered, orebodies can measure hundreds of feet wide, thousands of feet long, and are 

generally 3- to 6-feet thick; average grades range between 0.10% and 0.40% U3O8.

11.0  MINERALIZATION 

11.1   San Rafael Uranium District Mineralization 

 

The Tidwell District, the main historic mining area in the San Rafael Uranium District, is located 

updip and just west of the Deep Gold (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). Part of it lies within the western one-

fourth and margin of Magnum's greater San Rafael Uranium Project land position (Figs. 3 and 

4). The area is also historically known as the Four Corners Mining District after an early 

operator, Four Corners Uranium. Using Trimble and Doelling's (1978) production figures for the 

District and taking into account subsequent Atlas Minerals in-house reports concerning later 

production from the Snow and Probe mines (Atlas Minerals Engineering Department, 1982; 

Gordon, 1982; Wilbanks, 1982), in excess of 4.0 million pounds of U3O8 and 5.4 million pounds 

of V2O5 were produced from over 50 mines in the San Rafael Uranium District to date. This 

production equates to roughly 1,000,000 tons of material mined, with a speculated 8 million 

pounds of uranium remaining (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). 

 

The average thickness of the material mined is generally between 3.5 and 5.5 feet, with average 

grade dropping from roughly 0.35% U3O8 in the mid to late 1950's (Young and others, 1960) to 

around 0.18% to 0.19% U3O8 from the Snow and Probe Mines in the early 1980's and as the 

minimum acceptable ore grade changed with economics over time (Wilbanks, 1982). Deposits 

generally have an elongate shape and preferred northeasterly orientation that mimics the paleo-

stream channels in which they occur. Uranium mineralization exists almost entirely at one 

stratigraphic level, the upper sandstone sequence of the Salt Wash Member of the Upper Jurassic 

Morrison Formation, as described above. The size of the deposits generally increases in a 

northerly to northeasterly direction and from the surface basinward, where optimal host rock 

types were deposited and favorable sandstone-mudstone ratios were produced during 

development of the Acerson Trough. Size of deposits varies considerably, ranging from a few 

tons to semi-continuous to continuous clusters in excess of 150,000 tons. Historically, mine 

depths in the Tidwell District ranged from 40 feet along its west edge, to 300 to 400 feet further 

downdip to the east, and finally to about 600 to 700 feet downdip at the Snow and Lucky Mines 

even further east (Figs. 3 and 7). Depths of large remaining and partially to mostly drilled, but 

unmined, deposits, located just east of the Tidwell District, hosted by the upper sandstone 

horizon of the Salt Wash, and all or part of which are on Magnum's ground, include the Deep 

Gold at about 775 to 850 feet, the 4484 at about 900 feet, and the Down Yonder at about 950 to 

975 feet (Figs. 3 and 4). 

 

Several features have had an effect, either directly or indirectly, upon mineralization and the 

occurrence of the uranium-vanadium deposits in the San Rafael Uranium District. These 



 33 

features, along with a short description of each, are described in detail by Trimble and Doelling 

(1978), and are given below. For a more in-depth description of them, the reader is referred to 

Trimble and Doelling (1978). 

 

1. Sedimentary and Stratigraphic Controls: 

 

a. Depositional Environment – The Salt Wash Member of the Morrison was laid down 

in an aggrading fluvial environment. Mineralization in the San Rafael Uranium 

District is principally in the upper sandstone unit of Salt Wash, produced by several 

trunk stream channel systems (Tidwell, Acerson, and Sahara) entering into the 

Acerson Trough from the south. As sequential deposition of coarse to fine 

sedimentary materials took place, a general lateral belt of favorable coarser host rock 

types, sandstones and sandy conglomerates, developed along certain sections of the 

trunk stream channel systems, in turn followed downstream and laterally by a general 

fining of less favorable host sediments as current velocity decreased. 

 

b. Channel Trends - Most of the stream channels in the District have a northeast trend, 

as observed by Stokes (1954), Million (1957), Wentworth (1970), and Trimble and 

Doelling (1978). Stream directions have been determined by mapping sedimentary 

structures such as lineation, festoon, cross-bedding, and rib and furrow in the upper 

sandstone unit of the Salt Wash. 

 

c. Presence of Carbonaceous Material – Mineralization occurs in the District where 

carbonaceous material is abundant and has served as a reducing environment for the 

deposition of uranium. Carbonaceous material is less abundant in the southern part of 

the District, but increases northward along with more favorable host rock types as 

stream velocities decrease somewhat, forming lateral belts of favorability where the 

distributary system reaches a maximum. Further north and with further decrease in 

stream velocity, favorability decreases as only the finest plant material and mud and 

silt dominates as sands thin and feather out (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). 

 

d. Channel Contacts and Sandstone-Mudstone Ratios – Uranium mineralization in the 

upper sandstone unit is normally localized near the contacts of the sub-channels, with 

most of it usually near the bottom or sides of the individual channels. Many deposits 

are also found where there is a sudden change in the slope of the contact. Better 

deposits occur where the lithology is heterogeneous and where favorable rock types 

are well mixed with carbonaceous matter.  Sandstone-mudstone ratios play a major 

role in localizing and confining mineralization, as further defined and described 

below in detail in Section 11.2. 



 34 

 

e. Thickness of the Upper Sandstone Unit – Thickness of the upper sandstone unit is a 

major control to uranium mineralization. In thinner units, even where carbonaceous 

material is present, mineralization is minor to nonexistent. Most of the thick 

sandstone units in the San Rafael Uranium District are coarser grained and 

permeable, thus enhancing circulation of the mineralizing fluids. 

 

2. Structural Controls: 

 

a. Faults and Joints – Strong jointing is present normal to bedding in mineralized 

horizons and surrounding units, however mineralized bodies do not appear to be 

influenced by the jointing. Development of joints is probably related to regional 

folding that occurred subsequent to primary uranium deposition. Secondary oxide 

uranium and vanadium minerals occur on fracture surfaces. 

 

b. Anticlinal and Synclinal Axes – Subtle folding may have continued into Morrison 

time and controlled the streams depositing the Salt Wash sands. A topographic high 

(anticlinal axis) existed at the north end of the District and may have served to deflect 

the northeast flowing Salt Wash distributaries, thus aiding the accumulation of 

carbonaceous matter to the south in the mineralized area (Trimble and Doelling, 

1978). 

 

c. Northeast-Trending Lineaments – A periodicity is noted in the occurrence of 

northeast-trending mineralized bodies in the District, which implies a linear control 

other than or in addition to simple sedimentary channels. This linear control suggests 

structural lineaments, which could be related to the above mentioned folding in a 

washboard configuration or to an unknown and unobserved pattern of jointing or 

fracturing (Trimble and Doelling, 1978). 

 

3. Chemical Controls and Source of Uranium: 

 

a. A chemically reducing environment is needed for preservation of carbonaceous 

material and emplacement and maintenance of a uranium deposit. Circulating ground 

water introduced the uranium and vanadium into the reducing environment. Strong 

mineralization is found associated with twigs, bark, and branches and adjacent to 

thick accumulations of fine-grained carbonaceous matter. Age dates of Colorado 

Plateau uranium deposits indicate mineralization occurred from 70 to 115 million 

years ago (Stieff and others, 1953; Shawe and others, 1991). Leaching of bentonitic 

shales and mudstones in the Brushy Basin Member stratigraphically above the Salt 



 35 

Wash Member may have been the source of the uranium (Stokes, 1967; Gloyn and 

others, 2003).   

 

11.2  Deep Gold Uranium Deposit Mineralization 

 

Uranium mineralization at the Deep Gold deposit is best described from the results of Atlas 

Minerals' drilling of it in Section 23 and from Atlas' drilling and mining of its updip extension, 

which comprises the adjacent Snow and Lucky Mines just to the west and southwest (Fig. 3). 

First-hand observations are also available from logs obtained from Magnum's 2007 drilling in 

the western part of the deposit. It is worth reiterating that Deep Gold mineralization basically 

comprises a northeast-trending linear belt of ground that appears to exist as the downdip east-

northeast extensions of the Snow and Lucky Mines uranium mineralization. 

 

Historic work by Atlas Minerals geologists related to Deep Gold Uranium Deposit 

mineralization started with studies of underground workings in the Tidwell District, which 

indicated that significant mineralization closely follows depositional patterns. Past mining and 

drilling experience indicate that those areas where the upper Salt Wash system thickens into 

coalescing and overlapping channels are definitely more favorable in terms of hosting an 

economic ore deposit. As a result of this realization, efforts were made by Atlas geologists to 

delineate these more favorable areas in outcrop, match them to existing underground workings, 

and then project trends for possible future evaluation (Wilbanks, 1982). 

 

Following from the above, Atlas geologists mapped exposures of the upper Salt Wash from a 

point due west of the Probe shaft south along the outcrop for approximately 2.6 miles. Particular 

attention was given to sand thickness, current directions from cross bedding, general channel 

trends, and major faulting. Along the outcrop the upper Salt Wash alternatively thickens and 

thins, and it was discovered that two, thick, predominant channel systems exist in the field and 

show up on aerial photographs as erosion resistant highs on the Salt Wash dip slope.     

 

Results of further work found that the second channel system thickens to 80 feet in a most 

prominent northeast trend, with sands coarsening upward and capped by up to 10 feet of pebbly 

conglomerate. Also found were large coalescing channels separated by discontinuous shale splits 

up to 5-feet thick. The linear ridge formed by the outcrop of this channel system is dotted with 

numerous surface diggings, and a number of underground workings. Current directions taken 

from cross bedding indicate an average direction of flow of N65°E. Further along this trend and 

across property lines to the northeast, Pioneer Uravan drilling identified the Deep Gold deposit, 

the subject of this report, which Atlas geologists felt was an orebody adjacent to or continuous 

with the Atlas Lucky orebody and possibly also could be, in part, the downdip extension of 



 36 

Atlas' Snow Mine mineralization (Wilbanks, 1982). Based on his drilling in the area, the Pioneer 

Uravan geologist felt that their orebody, the Deep Gold, is situated where the Snow channel 

trend merges with another trend (the Lucky orebody trend?) coming from the southwest. 

 

Atlas Minerals' geologists mention that economic ore deposits in the Snow – Lucky – Deep Gold 

area and trend(s) are associated with sudden changes in depositional environment, grain size, and 

permeability, all of which play a role in ore deposition as evidenced by common ore localization 

near channel sides and bottoms. The sites where channel sands sharply contact less permeable 

mudstone or shale are common hosts for reducing carbonaceous material, and may also have 

provided hydrologic traps for uranium mineral deposition from ground water (Wilbanks, 1982). 

 

The thickness of the upper Salt Wash sand sequence is also a major controlling factor in ore 

deposition. The upper sequence is coarser grained and more permeable then the remainder of the 

Salt Wash, aiding in groundwater circulation. Because the thicker sand sequences consist of 

more numerous overlapping channels, they naturally provide a larger number of favorable 

localities for mineral deposition. Where the upper sequence is finer, fewer channels are present, 

carbonaceous material is less abundant, and orebodies are smaller or nonexistent. 

 

Recognition criteria and characteristics determined for Deep Gold Uranium Deposit 

mineralization indicated from geological and gamma-ray logs of holes drilled by Magnum in the 

west half of the deposit during 2007 confirm Atlas' observations described above and indicate 

mineralization ranges from 773.5 feet to 843.5 feet deep (Magnum Press Release dated January 

17, 2008). Host rock comprises clean to slightly arkosic carbonaceous sandstone, with associated 

conglomerate and local nearby siltstone/mudstone interbeds. Mineralization appears to be 

podiform in nature, with larger bodies usually consisting of a number of closely spaced or 

connected pods. Thickness of mineralization generally averages about 4 feet, with grades from 

various 4-foot thick intercepts as determined by down-hole gamma-ray probe work ranging 

between 0.161% U3O8 and 0.470% U3O8 (Magnum Press Release dated January 17, 2008).  

Current dimensions of known Deep Gold mineralization, including both the east and west 

deposit areas and as projected to the surface from all known drilling, both historic (Pioneer 

Uravan and Atlas Minerals) and Magnum, completed to date, is over 2,000-feet long in a 

northwest-southeast direction (normal to channel trend) and in excess of 2,000-feet long in a 

northeast-southwest direction (parallel to paleo-stream channel). This mineralization is presently 

open in numerous directions, particularly to the west and southwest toward the Lucky and Snow 

Mines, and south across the southern boundary of the Hollie claims.

12.0  EXPLORATION  

 

For the past two and one-half years, Magnum geologists have been acquiring historic exploration 

drilling information pertaining to the Deep Gold from a number of confidential sources in order 

to piece together the exploration history of the deposit to generate a high-quality National 

Instrument 43-101 compliant resource estimate on it, the subject of this report. Magnum will be 

using this resource estimate and the geological modeling to conduct an upcoming 50,000 foot 

exploration drilling program during 2009 to more clearly define the deposit with the ultimate 

goal of taking the property to production. To this end, Magnum has acquired all of Pioneer 

Uravan's and Atlas Minerals' drill-hole location maps, copies of all available down-hole gamma-

ray logs of historic drill holes and geologic reports, and all available Atlas Minerals' geological 

and 43-101 non-compliant resource estimate reports concerning the deposit. To date, Magnum 

has located and/or identified over 3,300 historic drill holes within the boundary of its BM claim 

block and State Section 36 Mineral Lease land holdings, all drilled for uranium. Over 2,000 of 

these holes are located on Magnum-controlled land. During the latter half of 2007, 10,570 feet of 

conventional rotary drilling in 11 holes was performed by Magnum Uranium Corp., the issuer, 

on the western part of the deposit, with this exploration information and the results and 

interpretation described below and in Section 13.0. 

 

First, as more clearly detailed in Section 13.0 of this report, historic exploration at Deep Gold 

was in the form of drilling, both rotary and core, that totals 288,083 feet in 299 holes. Making up 

this total are 247 holes comprising 235,788 feet drilled by Pioneer Uravan during 1979 through 

1981, and 52 holes comprising 52,295 feet drilled by Atlas Minerals during 1984 through 1986. 

Results of this drilling led to two 43-101 non-compliant resource calculations for the deposit 

area, both of which are more clearly outlined and detailed in Section 9.2 of this report. Both are 

mentioned for historic purposes only and are not to be relied upon. 

 

As mentioned above, relevant exploration work conducted by Magnum Uranium Corp., the 

issuer, totals 10,570 feet of conventional rotary drilling along and throughout the western edge of 

the western part of the deposit during the latter half of 2007. Drilling was conducted by Bob 

Beeman Drilling Company of Moab, Utah and down-hole logging for gamma, spontaneous 

potential (SP), and resistivity was performed by Century Geophysical, Salt Lake City, Utah, and 

Jet West Geophysical Services LLC of Farmington, New Mexico. The objective of this drilling 

was to step-out on existing mineralized zones and discover new areas of additional high-grade 

uranium mineralization similar to those defining historic Deep Gold resources and mineralized 

areas previously found by Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals drilling. All of Magnum's holes 

were logged by company geologists. Results of Magnum's drilling delineate numerous high-

grade intervals and intercepts that corroborate and expand upon those determined by the historic 



 38 

drilling and further expand the extent of the western part of the deposit, which is still open in 

many areas (see Table 1 and Section 13.0 of this Report for a detailed discussion of Magnum 

drilling results).

13.0  DRILLING 

 

Historic drilling of Deep Gold conducted prior to that performed by Magnum in late 2007 

comprises 288,083 feet in 299 holes. Making up this total is 247 holes comprising 235,788 feet 

drilled by Pioneer Uravan during 1979 through 1981, and 52 holes comprising 52,295 feet drilled 

by Atlas Minerals during 1984 through 1986. Depth to mineralization in Section 23 averages 800 

feet, with hole depths averaging approximately 1,000 feet. Considering that approximately 

288,000 feet of historic drilling was performed on the Deep Gold, costs for this drilling, in 1981 

US dollars, result in a total exploration drilling expenditure of approximately $2.88 million based 

on a $10 per foot average drill cost. Factoring in inflation and equating this amount to today's 

real dollar costs results in a current estimated amount of $6.99 million based on an inflation 

factor of nearly 143% between 1981 and 2008 (www.inflationdata.com). 

 

Rotary drilling conducted by Magnum Uranium Corp. throughout the western part of the Deep 

Gold deposit during the latter half of 2007 comprises 10,570 feet in 11 holes. All of the holes 

were either drilled as twins, infills, or step-outs. Interpretation of the exploration drilling 

information shows that six of the holes encountered significant intercepts typical of the tenor and 

thickness and occurring at the same depths of those found during Pioneer Uravan's and Atlas 

Minerals' historic drilling of the Deep Gold. They are also of the same tenor and thickness of 

material mined at Atlas Minerals' nearby updip Snow and Lucky Mines (Table 1; Wilbanks, 

1982). Some of the holes with better intercepts include SR-15-07 with 4.0 feet of 0.470% eU3O8, 

SR-27-07 with 4.0 feet of 0.356% eU3O8, and SR-25-07 with 4.0 feet of 0.161% eU3O8 (Table 1, 

and see Magnum Press Release dated 1/17/08 for details). Depths of mineralization ranged from 

773.5 feet to 826.5 feet in the northern part of the western edge of the deposit to 827.0 feet to 

843.5 feet in the southern part of the western edge. Drilling was conducted by Bob Beeman 

Drilling Company of Moab, Utah and down-hole logging for gamma, spontaneous potential 

(SP), and resistivity was performed by Century Geophysical, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Jet West 

Geophysical Services LLC of Farmington, New Mexico. All of the holes were logged by 

Magnum company geologists, with all logs residing in Magnum's Spokane, Washington office. 

Most of the holes were surveyed for down-hole drift, which trends northwest (updip) similar to 

all of the historic Pioneer Uravan holes that were surveyed.

TOTAL 10,570     

 

Besides the Deep Gold, there are a number of mineralized areas and trends that have been 

identified by previous exploration and mining efforts on Magnum's land holdings. To date, 

Magnum has located and/or identified over 3,300 historic drill holes within the boundary of the 

BM claim block and State Section 36 Mineral Lease, all drilled for uranium. Over 2,000 of these 

holes are located on land controlled by Magnum. The vast majority of the drilling is the result of 

the intense search by many companies, mostly major uranium exploration and development 

companies, for peneconcordant, high-grade, mineralized zones hosted in the favorable upper Salt 

Wash sandstone that can be linked together into mineable deposits. Throughout the majority of 

Magnum's property position, these zones were deposited in chemically favorable reducing 

environments of trunk channel and braided stream systems and networks presently buried 

beneath 350 to 1,000 feet of overlying sedimentary rock. These mineralized zones are not 

traceable on the surface, but are covered, blind targets that can only be tracked by concentrated 

drilling.  

 

Data concerning developmental surface drilling through the lives of Atlas Minerals' nearby 

Snow and Probe Mines, which collectively produced approximately 1.0 million pounds U3O8 

from upper Salt Wash sandstone, had a 20% success ratio (Fig. 3; Wilbanks, 1982). Continuous 

longhole programs were also used to locate additional ore underground. This underground 

longhole drilling had a success ratio of 35% for the Probe Mine and 29% for the Snow Mine 

(Wilbanks, 1982). Also of note and in line with the these statistics is that underground drilling 



 41 

and actual mining led to significantly more mineralization discovered than surface drilling 

indicated (this point is commonly brought out and applicable to most of the historic mines in the 

Tidwell District, as more mineralization was discovered through underground mining and 

longhole programs than was indicated from surface drilling). By example and from start up 

through shut down, actual production figures for Atlas Minerals' Snow Mine show that it 

produced 455% more tons of material and 281% more pounds of U3O8 than the original reserves 

indicated by surface drilling (Wilbanks, 1982). In summary and as quoted by Wilbanks (1982), 

"In the past most orebodies mined in the Green River (Tidwell District) area have ultimately 

produced more pounds of U3O8 than calculated in original reserves." 

 

Based on Magnum's favorable 2007 drilling results and all the historic drilling results at hand, a 

50,000-foot conventional exploration drilling program is being recommended by the author for 

the upcoming 2009 field season. This 50,000-foot program comprises 50 holes averaging 1,000-

feet deep to be located as infills between widely spaced mineralized holes and as offsets and 

extensions of open-ended mineralization, linear and sinuous mineralized trends, and known 

blocks and linked pods of mineralization. Locations of the 50 holes are directly related to the 

results, spacing, and patterns of the historic drilling and Magnum's 2007 drilling, as well as to 

the geological modeling and mineralization favorability criteria used as a basis to produce the 

deposit resource calculation contained in this report. 

   



 42 

 

14.0  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Historic sampling methods and approaches used by Pioneer Uravan and Atlas Minerals to 

determine the uranium content of their drill holes were based mostly on radiometric analysis by 

down-hole gamma-ray logging, much of the detailed results of which are in Magnum's 

possession and have been used by the author to compute mineralized intervals which serve as the 

basis for the 43-101 compliant resource calculation that is the subject of this report. Down-hole 

log interpretation has historically been found to be an accurate representation of in situ grades for 

uranium mineralization in the San Rafael District as established by Atlas Minerals during their 

exploration and mining operations conducted in the District. In situ uranium grade, expressed as 

equivalent U3O8 ("eU3O8"), is calculated using industry standard techniques for gamma log 

interpretation. 

 

Magnum carried out radiometric down-hole gamma-ray logging of holes drilled throughout the 

western part of the Deep Gold deposit during the latter half of 2007. Concerning this work, the 

gamma portion of the down-hole logging tool was calibrated to the uranium content by probing 

standardized test pits containing similar mineralization type and anticipated grade, located in 

Grand Junction, Colorado. Probe work was performed by Century Geophysical and Jet West 

Geophysical Services. In some cases, holes were probed by both companies as a check between 

one another in terms of calibration, instrumentation, and procedural methods in order to maintain 

Quality Control/Quality Assurance.  Results were found to be comparable, thus removing any 

factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of these results or bias them in 

any way. Down-hole gamma-ray probe runs were usually conducted right after or within a few 

hours of completion of drilling the hole, almost always within a maximum of 24 hours of doing 

so. Probe results were reported in 0.5 foot increments, with thickness and grade of mineralized 

intervals based on 0.025%, 0.050%, and 0.100% eU3O8 cutoffs. Water factor, casing factor, K-

factor, and dead time were all taken into account in the calculations. Because the host upper 

sandstone unit of the upper part of the Salt Wash Member is relatively flat-lying in the Deep 

Gold deposit area, only dipping gently 2° to 3° basinward to the east, and all of Magnum's drill 

holes are vertical, uranium-bearing intervals determined from the gamma-ray probe work appear 

to closely represent the estimated true thickness of mineralization.  



 43 

15.0  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

 

No surface samples have been collected by an employee, officer, director, or associate of 

Magnum Uranium Corp. during visits to the property because the Deep Gold mineralization lies 

at a depths of 775 to 850 feet below the surface and is not readily accessible. Furthermore, 

because no historic drill core or cuttings are known to have been archived, no possibility of 

obtaining samples for analysis from these sources exists. It is recommended that normal 

procedures be required for establishing sample identification (drill core or cuttings) and that 

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) and chain of custody/security protocol be 

established and followed in storing and transporting samples to a registered geochemical assay 

laboratory. It is recommended that all Magnum drill samples generated during 2009 and beyond 

for geochemical analysis be sent to Energy Laboratories, Casper, Wyoming. This lab is one of 

the premier prep facilities for uranium-bearing drill core/drill cuttings and for geochemical 

uranium assays in the United States. It is also recommended that down-hole gamma-ray logging 

of all holes drilled at Deep Gold be performed by Century Geophysical, Salt Lake City, Utah, 

who is an industry leader in this type of work. Century was employed by Magnum to 

radiometrically probe a number of holes drilled on a number of targets, including Deep Gold, in 

its San Rafael Uranium Project land position during 2007-2008 with excellent quality control 

and results. 

 

In summary, no samples were collected or prepared because the sampling methods employed are 

geophysical in nature (down-hole gamma ray probe, see Section 14.0) and not by direct 

geochemical analysis in a conventional lab. 

  



 44 

16.0  DATA VERIFICATION 
 

Historic drill-hole locations and drill data were originally hand drafted on 1:4,800 scale mylar 

maps.  Data recorded on the maps includes collar elevation, elevation of the top of the 

mineralized horizon, thickness of mineralization, and grade of intercept. The original survey data 

for both the collar location and down-hole drift were not available, however, down-hole drift 

annotations for selected holes are posted on a Pioneer Uravan drill hole location map (Casey, 

1980). Some drill hole locations are marked in the field by a stake, but information on most 

stakes has since faded.  There are a couple of holes that contain a stake that can be read and tied 

into the historic Pioneer Uravan Map. The drill maps were scanned, digitally rectified, and the 

down-hole deviations assumed to be a straight line between the collar and bottom of hole 

locations. This assumption could introduce some error in the actual three dimensional location of 

any specific datum point, but the relative location of the datum point to other data points is 

considered to be reasonably accurate.                                    

These data were checked against other historic hand-drafted maps of the District. Additionally, 

file folders of all down-hole gamma-ray logs for each Pioneer-Uravan hole are archived in 

Spokane.  In order to assure accuracy, all holes used in the resource calculation were cross-

checked to establish that the depths to mineralization indicated on the map correlate with the 

actual drill logs. All holes were then digitized, and locations were rectified and printed out on a 

1:4,800 scale map registered to a USGS topographic map in NAD 27 UTM coordinate space. 

The data were input as electronic data via a spreadsheet in a computer program utilized for the 

development of the resource given in this report.  The input data were double-checked for 

accuracy and the resulting map was confirmed by overlying the resource map generated with the 

original mylar map print to assure accuracy and completeness.  The resultant data and map were 

used to construct the polygon resource map (Fig. 8). Recommendations given later in this report 

advise drilling approximately 50 holes which will be spot cored through the mineralized horizon 

with the core to be chemically assayed for uranium, vanadium and other elements. The chemical 

uranium will be compared to the eU3O8 to define accuracy and to determine if disequilibrium is 

an issue. 

 

It must be emphasized that the accuracy of any resource estimate ultimately depends upon the 

accuracy of the samples used. In most sandstone-hosted uranium deposits, eU3O8 values are not 

chemical or other direct analyses, but are radiometric equivalents based on counts of gamma 

radiation received per time interval at a detector. Proper probe calibration to similar type and 

grades of expected mineralization is important to guarantee that a systematic bias is not 

introduced in the values.  The radiometric data from geophysical logs were provided to Magnum 

and the author by outside sources.  Instrumentation used for logging the hole was calibrated at 



 45 

U.S. Department of Energy facility test pits in Grand Junction, Colorado, designed and built for 

that specific purpose. The personnel interpreting the geophysical data were trained in that regard. 



 46 

17.0  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

 

Within the entire San Rafael Uranium Project area, which comprises approximately 6,000 acres 

and includes much of the historic Tidwell District proper throughout the western one-fourth of its 

extent, Magnum has identified a number of other mineralized trends and significant uranium 

targets containing potential resources, many of which have been identified by previous 

exploration and mining efforts. Most of these targets are within, adjacent to, or exist as 

extensions of areas of known mineralization or past production in the core of the San Rafael 

Uranium District proper. Magnum has acquired and amassed an extensive database pertaining to 

historic work conducted on its land position from a number of sources including, but not limited 

to, public and private data collections, historic major and junior uranium exploration company 

archives, and government uranium mineral property classified files and archives, many of which 

show the potential for mineralization in upper sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Upper 

Jurassic Morrison Formation, the same sandstone horizon hosting mineralization at Deep Gold. 

Magnum's targets within the San Rafael Uranium Project JV area, in addition to the Deep Gold, 

include Down Yonder, 4484, North Target, and the Jackrabbit Zone, the locations of which are 

shown in Figure 3 of this report and have been mentioned and/or partly described in Magnum 

Uranium Corp. press releases during 2006 and 2007 (Magnum Uranium Corp. Press Releases 

dated 8/22/06, 12/5/06, 6/12/07, 8/10/07, 8/22/07, and 10/25/07). 

 

Additionally, a number of major past producing properties and mines and/or known deposits 

owned and worked by major and junior uranium companies, past and presently active, lie 

immediately adjacent to Magnum's San Rafael Uranium Project area. Those most notable 

include Atlas Minerals' Snow and Probe mines, which collectively produced nearly 1.0 million 

pounds of U3O8 (252,554 tons @ 0.187% U3O8, Wilbanks, 1982) during the period 1973 – 1982 

and lie on Quaterra Resources' adjacent CRP claim block, and the Down Yonder uranium 

deposit, which, controlled by Magnum, comprises a 43-101 compliant resource of 1,800,200 

pounds of U3O8 in 492,000 tons at an average grade of 0.184% eU3O8, and lies in the State 

Section 36 Mineral Lease area (Fig. 3, and Magnum Uranium Corp. Press Release dated 

3/25/08).     

 

This report does not address to any degree any of the above properties within the San Rafael 

Uranium Project joint venture area, except the Deep Gold, nor the above mentioned adjacent 

properties. Data available for the preparation of this report is historic, developed by previous 

owners of the property. Magnum conducted some of its own exploration drilling on the property, 

the results of which are contained in this report (see Sections 12.0 and 13.0).  

  



 47 

18.0  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL 

TESTING 

 

No mineral processing and/or metallurgical testing has been conducted by Magnum on the Deep 

Gold and none is known to have been conducted by any of the previous major uranium 

companies working on the deposit (Pioneer Uravan, Atlas Minerals). Apparently the 

mineralization is amenable to standard extraction techniques as over 4 million pounds of 

uranium have been beneficiated from the San Rafael Uranium District.  Results of previous 

historic mining in the District indicate that the uranium to vanadium ratio in mined material is 

about 1:1 to 1:2 (Trimble and Doelling, 1978).  

 

Historic mining in the Tidwell District and specifically at Atlas Minerals' Snow and Probe 

mines, immediately adjacent to Magnum's land position boundary (Fig. 3), has been mostly by 

conventional underground methods using shaft and tunnel, room-and-pillar, and split shooting 

techniques (Gordon, 1982). With the groundwater table generally at a depth of 500 to 800 feet at 

the Deep Gold, as determined by the results of Pioneer Uravan's and Atlas' historic drilling, 

mining below this level, such as at the Snow and Probe, requires dewatering (Pinnick, 1975; 

Gordon, 1982). However, with Deep Gold uranium mineralization below the ground-water table, 

it may be possible that this mineralization can be mined by In-Situ Leaching (ISL). ISL works 

for some permeable sandstone-hosted uranium deposits below the water table, i.e., water-

saturated deposits, which are not suitable for conventional mining. 

 

The mechanics of ISL uranium mining are relatively straightforward. Employing Freeman and 

Stover's (1999) description of the ISL process used at Cameco's Smith Ranch deposit in 

Wyoming as a classic example, leaching solution (lixiviate), formed by adding gaseous carbon 

dioxide and oxygen to native ground water, is injected into a uranium-bearing sandstone through 

a series of injection wells in a grid pattern for optimum coverage. As the lixiviate moves through 

the aquifer containing the mineralization, the oxygen reacts and oxidizes the uranium to the +6 

valence state. The oxidized uranium then complexes with the carbon dioxide and water to form a 

soluble uranyl dicarbonate ion. The uranium-rich lixiviate flows through the formation to a 

recovery well where it is pumped to the surface by submersible pumps and transported through a 

piping system to a surface recovery plant. At the recovery plant, the uranium is removed from 

the fluid by ion exchange. The barren fluid is then re-fortified with carbon dioxide and oxygen 

and re-injected to extract additional uranium. 

 

ISL is currently used to mine uranium in Kazakhstan and Australia, and it also accounts for the 

lion's share of uranium production in the United States, where the process is employed at 



 48 

Cameco's Smith Ranch uranium deposit in the South Powder River Basin of Wyoming (Plate 8). 

High levels of calcium in the Wyoming deposit require an alkaline form of ISL, whereas acid 

ISL is typically used elsewhere. Overall, the ISL process accounts for about 26% of the world's 

uranium production. 

 

Due to the number of geological, hydrological, geochemical, and physical parameters that a 

subject sandstone-hosted uranium deposit below the water table needs to meet and satisfy to be 

ISL amenable and potentially economically viable, not all deposits of this type are neccessarliy 

good candidates. Obvious advantages of ISL over conventional mining include generally lower 

capital start-up and operating costs, no waste (no radioactive tailings or waste rock) is generated 

from the leaching process, lower-grade deposits can be processed, project reclamation costs are 

reduced, there is significantly less ground disturbance, project permitting is generally looked on 

more favorably, and environmental issues and liabilities are lessened. Any one or all of these 

points can have a significant impact on the project's bottom line and economic viability.  

 

To the best of the author's knowledge, no historic ISL mineral processing, metallurgical testing, 

or recovery work has been conducted on the Deep Gold deposit. Magnum is in the process of 

exploring the possibility of employing an ISL recovery process at its adjacent Down Yonder 

deposit (State Section 36 Mineral Lease area) and has obtained technical consultation from R
2
 

Engineering toward this end. All results are currently pending. 

   



 49 

19.0  MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE 

ESTIMATES 

The Deep Gold deposit is on land divided by a property boundary.  That boundary divides the 

Hollie claims from the BM claims.  Magnum Uranium has legal rights to the uranium outside the 

Hollie claims (on the BM claims). The Hollie block is a group of 10 claims of which, it is 

assumed for the purposes of this report that, UPC is 50% owner and Uranium One is 50% owner. 

The amount of Deep Gold deposit uranium located on both sides of this boundary is given at the 

end of this section (Table 2). 

 

For the purpose of this 43-101 report, no economic evaluation of the mineralization described 

herein was performed.  Thus, the determination of the size and grade of the deposit that follows 

is solely a mineral resource estimate of the amount of uranium contained within the deposit. 

Mineral Resources are not economic "reserves" because no economic evaluation has been 

performed and economic viability has not been demonstrated. Although more drilling needs to be 

performed at Deep Gold, and is recommended in Section 22.0 of this Report, the mineralization 

that has been described is relatively coherent and considered an Indicated Resource.  

 

Because of the erratic nature of the mineralization inherent in peneconcordant uranium deposits, 

it is often difficult to determine geologic controls on ore/waste contacts or even the outlines of 

mineralized areas with a degree of certainty sufficient to increase the accuracy of resource 

estimates. Because of the difficulty in locating precise ore/waste boundaries, reserve methods in 

common use are either polygonal or statistical.  Both methods have been successfully applied in 

the evaluation of resources at many prospects and operating mines. Resources for this report 

were calculated by the perpendicular-bisector polygon method using bisectors one-half the 

distance between the nearest drill-hole locations. Because the Deep Gold was drilled on about 

100 foot centers, the resulting polygons have about a 10,000 ft
2
 (100 ft x 100 ft) area of 

influence. There are a few polygons larger than this in the south portion of the deposit area 

because of the increased drill spacing. If a mineralized polygon was situated straddling the 

property boundary separating the eastern or Hollie Claims (UPC/Uranium One-owned) portion 

of the deposit from the western or San Rafael (Magnum-owned) portion of the deposit, then the 

polygon was divided as its area applies to each owner's share.  

  

Polygons were constructed around every hole containing mineralization with a G x T (grade x 

thickness) value > 0.20. The polygons shown in Figure 8 are color-coded so that pale yellow 

indicates polygons containing a G x T of 0.20 to 0.39. None of these pale yellow polygons were 

used in the resource calculation. The pink polygons represent a G x T cutoff of 0.40 and a G x T 

range of 0.40 to 0.99. The red polygons contain G x T values equal to or greater than 1.00 

(equivalent of 10 feet of 0.10% U3O8). Some selected polygons with G x T cutoffs slightly below 

0.40 (dark yellow) were included in the indicated resource category because they lend and show 



 50 

continuity to the deposit. Polygons were constructed with their sides being half the distance to 

the nearest hole. Resulting individual polygons define the area of influence surrounding each 

hole (Fig. 8). Polygonal boundaries are perpendicular bisectors of lines connecting adjacent 

holes. If no bounding hole was available, then mineralization was extended out from the hole not 

more than 75 feet in radius and the side of the hole was left open (not bounded by a line). The 

area of each polygon, in square feet, was calculated by computer, with the areas listed in 

Appendix I.  If weak mineralization or no mineralization was present in a hole, then a polygon 

was not constructed and the hole was considered to be barren.  Appendix I contains the following 

data on every hole: 1) hole number; 2) thickness of intercept; 3) grade (% eU3O8); 4) pounds/ton; 

5) GxT; 6) polygon area; 7) polygon volume; 8) tons; and 9) pounds U3O8 indicated. 

For indicated mineral resources, the mineralized polygon is bracketed by drilling and a line 

denoting the boundary between holes is shown, generally the area where the drill spacing was 

about 100 feet between holes. For the inferred mineral resource given in this report, the 

mineralized trend is not fully defined or bracketed by drilling, but it is reasonable, given the 

transmissivity of the host rock and the amount of drilling performed, that mineralization in the 

projected paleo-stream channel extends beyond the portion of the last hole defined by assays.  

The inferred polygon is the weighted average grade and average thickness of the nearest hole(s) 

from which the projection is made. This amended report includes an inferred block of 

mineralization that was inadvertently omitted from the original 43-101 Technical report 

(Appendix 1, Block E).  This oversight has been corrected as this block is now included in the 

amended resource estimate 

The area (sq ft) of the indicated circles/polygons was calculated by a computer program that 

measures areas of polygons with an accuracy of less than 0.01 sq ft, and the grade and thickness 

information for the indicated and inferred categories were entered into Appendix I.  

 A tonnage factor of 14 was used in this calculation, based on direct specific gravity 

measurements of 91 mineralized Salt Wash sandstone plugs from the adjacent Down Yonder 

deposit. The average specific gravity is 2.37 g/cm
3
, which translates to a tonnage factor of 13.5, 

however, a slightly more conservative tonnage factor of 14 was used in the resource calculation. 

The Down Yonder's host rock and stratigraphic position are the same as those found at the Deep 

Gold, and as such support using this tonnage factor for the Deep Gold resource calculation. All 

uranium grades are given in eU3O8 (equivalent uranium) as determined by down-hole gamma-

ray probe. By taking the volume of each polygon and dividing by the tonnage factor, the tons of 

rock contained within the polygon are determined. Then by multiplying the tons of rock by the 

pounds of contained uranium/ton, the pounds of uranium are determined. 

The resource given in Table 2 was calculated for the Deep Gold deposit contained within Section 

23 using an approximate 0.40 G x T cutoff. This resource is further broken out by location and 

ownership of the deposit, i.e., that amount contained in Magnum's Deep Gold West part of the 



 51 

deposit, and the amount contained in UPC/Uranium One's Deep Gold East part.

March 28, 2008, compirses an Indicated resource of 1,536,900 pounds of U3O8 contained in 

282,600 tons at an average grade of 0.272% eU3O8 and an Inferred resource of 78,200 pounds of 

U3O8 contained in 24,000 tons at an average grade of 0.163% eU3O8. This original estimate 

comprises a total Indicated and Inferred resource of 1,615,100 pounds U3O8 at an overall average 

grade of 0.263% eU3O8.  

The amended estimate for the entire Deep Gold deposit now comprises an Indicated resource of 

1,646,700 pounds of U3O8 contained in 302,800 tons at an average grade of 0.272% eU3O8 and 

an Inferred resource of 266,100 pounds of U3O8 contained in 37,450 tons at average grade of 

0.355% eU3O8. The amended 43-101 estimate provides a revised total resource of 1,912,800 

pounds contained in 340,250 tons @ 0.281% U3O8.  Most importantly, Magnum's share of this 

total amended resource, which resides totally within the Deep Gold West portion of the deposit 

and is 100% Magnum-owned, comprises an Indicated resource of 144,600 tons @ 0.229% eU3O8 

for 663,400 pounds of U3O8 and an Inferred resource of 37,450 tons @ 0.355% eU3O8 for 

266,100 pounds U3O8. This amended estimate comprises a total Indicated and Inferred resource 

of 929,500 pounds U3O8 contained in 182,050 tons at an overall average grade of 0.255% eU3O8, 

again all contained within Magnum's 100%-owned Deep Gold West portion of the Deep Gold 



 53 

deposit. This total, compared to the total resource of 925,000 lbs U3O8 reported in the original 

March 28
th

 NI 43-101 report, is an increase of 0.5%.

20.0  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

Radiometric Equilibrium 

Because the down-hole gamma-ray probe is an indirect method of determining the uranium 

content of the rock, results by this method are usually correlated with cuttings or drill core 

sampled from the same interval in order to determine if the equivalent uranium content indicated 

by the gamma-ray probe is in "equilibrium" with the actual chemical uranium content of the rock 

as determined by the lab.  This determination is commonly performed by collecting hundreds of 

samples and comparing them to the equivalent uranium determined by the probe to ascertain 

whether the deposit is in "positive disequilibrium" (chemical uranium content is greater than 

equivalent uranium), "equilibrium" (chemical and equivalent uranium are in 1:1 association), or 

"negative disequilibrium" (equivalent uranium is greater than chemical uranium). Because 

limited data were available for the evaluation of radiometric equilibrium at Deep Gold, this 

determination cannot yet be made. However, because the Deep Gold deposit occurs at depths of 

roughly between 775 and 850 feet below the surface, is completely below the modern water 

table, and is not subjected to oxidizing surface waters, mineralization is not expected to exhibit 

significant disequilibrium. Quantitatively, the information available on the Tidwell Uranium 

District, including the Snow and Probe mines, does not specifically address radiometric 

equilibrium, which historically does not appear to be a factor because over 4 million pounds of 

U3O8 were produced. 

 

At present, there is not enough historic geochemical assay and radiometric probe information to 

conclusively determine if the chemical and radiometric uranium contents of the system are in 

equilibrium or not, but this information coupled with mining information in the District and 

region suggests that there is not a disequilibrium problem.

21.0  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

This report summarizes the Deep Gold uranium resource within Section 23, T21S, R14E, of the 

San Rafael Uranium Property, Emery County, Utah.   The objective of this report is to describe 

the mineralization comprising the Deep Gold deposit and to complete an estimate of mineral 

resources, and that objective has been met.  The available data define mineralization at about 775 

to 850 feet below the surface in the upper sandstone horizon of the Salt Wash Member of the 

Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation.  The mineralization is well defined by drilling, and the 

mineral resource estimate meets or exceeds the CIM definitions for indicated and inferred. The 

entire resource comprises an indicated resource of 302,800 tons @ 0.272% U3O8 containing 

1,646,700 pounds U3O8 and an inferred resource of 34,450 tons @ 0.355% U3O8 containing 

266,100 pounds of U3O8. Magnum owns 100% of the Deep Gold West portion of the Deep Gold 

deposit comprising an indicated resource of 144,600 tons @ 0.229% U3O8 containing 663,400 

pounds U3O8 and an inferred resource of 37,450 tons @ 0.355% U3O8 containing 266,100 

pounds U3O8. For the purposes of this report, I have assumed that Magnum owns none of the 

eastern part of the deposit on the Hollie claims. 

 

The tonnage portion of the resource estimate given in this report is considered to be slightly 

conservative based on actual ore mined versus that indicated by surface drilling at the adjacent 

Snow, Lucky, and Probe orebodies. Data concerning developmental surface drilling through the 

lives of the Snow and Probe Mines, which collectively produced approximately 1.0 million 

pounds U3O8 from upper Salt Wash sandstone, had a 20% success ratio (Fig. 3; Wilbanks, 1982). 

By comparison, underground longhole drilling programs had a success ratio of 35% for the 

Probe Mine and 29% for the Snow Mine (Wilbanks, 1982). From start up through shut down, 

actual production figures for Atlas Minerals' Snow Mine show that it produced 455% more tons 

of material and 281% more pounds of U3O8 than the original reserves indicated by surface 

drilling (Wilbanks, 1982).  

 

It is recommended that 50 holes be drilled to further refine this resource and that hole deviation 

measurements be performed and recorded as well as spot coring to definitively address any 

possible disequilibrium which, as of this writing, does not appear to be a problem.   

 

Past mining in the Tidwell District produced vanadium as a co-product.  Vanadium was not 

addressed in this report because no vanadium information is available.  It is recommended that 

the feasibility of producing vanadium as a co-product be addressed during the next phase of 

exploration by analyzing the V2O5 content in the spot cores and establishing the V:U ratio to 



 56 

predict how much contained vanadium is present in the deposit, which could have economic 

ramifications if the deposit is ever mined. 

 

22.0  RECOMMENDATIONS 

The following recommendations are appropriate as the property moves toward development:  

1. A 50-hole, 50,000-foot drill program is recommended to step-out on open-ended 

mineralized holes (open-ended polygons) in Magnum's Deep Gold West portion (San 

Rafael part) of the deposit to either add pounds or close off the polygons. Planned 

locations of these holes are shown in Figure 8, with a few more added as contingencies in 

case some cannot be permitted.  Total cost of this drilling is estimated to be US$1,000,000 

based on an all-in cost of US$20/foot drilled. 

2. At least 10 holes of the recommended drill program should be spot cored through the 

mineralized horizon and this core should be used to assay for uranium in order to 

definitively establish the equilibrium parameters for the Deep Gold, although at this time 

there appears to be no issue regarding disequilibrium. 

3. The core obtained from the recommended drill program should be analyzed for vanadium 

content. The uranium to vanadium ratio of the historic production from the Tidwell 

District was 1:1 to 1:2, and, if the Deep Gold does contain vanadium, then the commodity 

may enhance deposit economics.  

4. Establish a QA/QC procedure regarding chain of custody for samples and analysis 

including developing standards, blanks, and duplicate samples for chemical assay.  

Chemical assay should be conducted by Energy Labs in Casper, Wyoming, a leader in 

uranium analysis in the United States. 

5. Complete a detailed hydrologic investigation of the deposit, including the determination of 

geohydrologic properties and current ground water levels and quality.  It is estimated that 

this investigation will cost approximately US$50,000. 

6. Investigate the feasibility of using ISL as a means of extracting the uranium from the 

deposit, which might be the most cost-effective way of beneficiating the mineralization at 

depths of over 775 feet.  Cost of this work is estimated at US$250,000. Similar work is 

currently being conducted by Magnum at its nearby Down Yonder Deposit 2 miles south-

southeast in Section 35 and the State Section 36 Mineral Lease area.
