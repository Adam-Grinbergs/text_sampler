Executive Summary 
 
Introduction 
 
The Niblack property is a resource delineation stage polymetallic exploration project 
located in south eastern Alaska, approximately fifty kilometres southwest of 
Ketchikan, Alsaka. The project encloses several polymetallic volcanogenic sulphide 
occurrences, including two zones Lookout and Trio where Niblack Mining Corp. 
("Nibalck") focussed its drilling efforts.  
 
During the third quarter of 2007, Niblack commissioned SRK Consulting (Canada) 
Inc. ("SRK") to review and audit the exploration work undertaken by Niblack, and to 
prepare an initial mineral resource estimate for the Lookout and TRio volcanogenic 
sulphide zones. This technical report documenting the resource model constructed by 
SRK was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators 
National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally 
accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice 
Guidelines". SRK visited the Niblack project on August 8 and 9, 2007. 
 
Property Description and Agreements 
 
The Niblack property presently consists of eighteen patented mineral claims 
surrounded by 146 contiguous staked Federal mineral claims, and seven State of 
Alaska tideland claims. The total land package covers an aggregate area of 
approximately 3,300 acres (about 1,330 hectares). The boundaries of the patented 
claims have been legally surveyed; boundaries of the other claims have not. The 
property is in the Ketchikan Recording District, with the area of immediate interest 
centered at about 55 degrees 04 minutes latitude north and 132 degrees 05 minutes 
longitude west, on Craig A-1 USGS Map Quadrangle. 
 
The property is owned by Niblack subject to a fifteen percent Net Profits Interest to 
Cook Inlet Regional Inc. (a regional native corporation) and a sliding scale one to three  
percent Net Smelter Return Royalty to Barrick Gold Corporation. 
 
Location, Access and Physiography 
 
Access to the Niblack project area is by float equipped aircraft, helicopter, or boat 
from Ketchikan (population 8,000) where there is a deepwater seaport and an 
international airport, with regular daily jetliner service to Seattle, Washington.  
 
Climatic conditions are typical of the Alaska Panhandle region, with warm summers 
and relatively wet, cool winters. Snow cover can be heavy at higher elevations. 
Rainfall is often very heavy, with average annual precipitation of about 
442 centimetres (174 inches). The area encompassed by the claims is covered by 
temperate rainforest at lower elevations, giving way to sparse sub-alpine vegetation at 
the highest elevations. The property terrain is mountainous, with moderate to very 
steep slopes rising up from Niblack Anchorage. Total relief is approximately 
700 metres (2,300 feet). 
 
The present camp facility can accommodate up to fifty people. Accommodations, 
cafeteria and office space are provided by a floating barge camp. A 100 metre long 
pile secured floating dock, and barge moorage/landing facility has been constructed on 
site to facilitate marine transport of equipment and supplies. Power is not available in 
the immediate vicinity of the property.

Dirt roads connect the barge ramp to the portal and core logging facility. Beyond these 
areas, helicopter and foot are the most efficient means of on-site travel. 
 
History 
 
The Niblack area has been explored for minerals since the initial copper discovery at 
Niblack Anchorage made in 1899. The Niblack Mine was developed at the site of the 
initial discovery as early as 1902. Available records show that the mine shipped ore 
from 1905 through 1908, producing just over 30,000 tons grading about 3.2 percent 
copper, 0.04 troy ounce per ton ("opt") gold and 0.68 opt silver. The mine was closed 
in late 1908, believed to be the result of litigation. 
 
In the period 1974 - 1976, Cominco American Incorporated ("Cominco") drilled six 
diamond boreholes (2,893 feet or 882 metres) in the area of the Niblack Mine, 
intersecting short intervals of copper mineralisation. Cominco withdrew from the 
project. 
 
In 1977, The Anaconda Company ("Anaconda") staked 118 claims, acquired the 
original patented claims. Gold-bearing limonitic mineralisation was discovered on 
surface at Lookout Mountain at the "Anaconda Pit". One core borehole (1,132 feet or 
345 metres) was drilled in the hanging wall units. 
 
In 1980, Noranda Exploration Incorporated ("Noranda") optioned the property from 
Anaconda and drilled eighteen boreholes in the Lookout Mountain area. 
 
In 1984, Lac Minerals (USA) Incorporated ("Lac") entered into a joint venture with 
Noranda and conducted geological mapping, soil geochemical sampling, and ground 
electromagnetic surveys.  From 1984 to 1989, Lac completed twenty diamond drill 
holes (3,464 metres).  Lac resumed work in 1992 and drilled fifteen diamond drill 
holes (4,789 metres).  In late 1994, Lac was acquired by Barrick Gold Corporation 
("Barrick"). 
 
In early 1995, Abacus Minerals Corp. ("Abacus") acquired the Niblack property from 
Barrick and Noranda. From 1995 to 1997, Abacus preformed geological mapping, soil 
sampling and prospecting and drilled 101 holes (25,876 metres).  Resource estimates 
were prepared at the end of both the 1996 and 1997 field seasons. In late 2004, Abacus 
transferred ownership of the Niblack property to a new company incorporated under 
the name Niblack Mining Corp. 
 
In the fall of 2005, Niblack drilled seven boreholes in the Lookout area (1,894 metres). 
In 2006, Niblack drilled thirty-two boreholes, (8,230 metres) focussing on expanding 
the Lookout sulphide zone and other property wide targets. Niblack also initiated 
permitting for the establishment of a new portal and construction of up to 1,800 metres 
of underground development to provide access to the downdip extension of the 
Lookout zone. Environmental work relating to the permit applications was carried out 
in 2005, 2006, and 2007, including baseline surface water quality studies, hydrology 
and meteorology monitoring programs, acid rock drainage studies, and various biology 
surveys. In 2007, Niblack drilled nineteen borehole drill program ( 4,894 metres). 
 
Permits for the underground program were received in July 2007, with portal 
construction commencing September 2007. Construction of the drift was suspended in 
July 2008, and consists of an 850 metre main access drift that cross cuts the deepest 
portion of the Lookout Zone resource area. Nine underground boreholes (1,837 
metres) were drilled in late 2007 and early 2008 to investigate the Mammoth zone 
target. A second underground drilling program was initiated in the summer of 2008 to 
expand the Lookout Zone resource down plunge and down dip. None of the

underground drilling is included in the initial mineral resource estimate reported 
herein. 
 
Regional and Local Geology 
 
The Niblack project occurs within the Moira Sound Unit, an Ordovician to Lower 
Silurian volcano-sedimentary assemblage 
 
The southern part of the Prince of Wales Island is underlain by the Alexander terrane 
extending along the coast of northwest British Columbia northward through the 
Alaskan panhandle into the Saint Elias Mountains of British Columbia and the Yukon, 
and westward into the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska. This terrane evolved along a 
convergent plate margin from Precambrian-Cambrian through Early Devonian time, 
with a deposition of arc-type igneous and sedimentary rocks. These were subsequently 
deformed and metamorphosed during Middle Cambrian-Early Ordovician and Middle 
Silurian-earliest Devonian orogenies. Shallow marine carbonate, clastic rocks and 
subordinate mafic-intermediate volcanic rocks were deposited from the Middle 
Devonian through Early Permian. Late Triassic rift-related volcanic and sedimentary 
rocks were deposited unconformably on the Permian and older rocks. Accretion of the 
Alexander terrane to inboard Cordilleran terranes resulted in overprinting deformation 
and metamorphism during mid-Jurassic through Cretaceous, with further 
dismemberment occurring along regional-scale right-lateral strike slip faults during 
Tertiary and Recent times. 
 
Rocks at Niblack Anchorage have traditionally been thought to be part of the Descon 
Formation a sedimentary-dominated Ordovician to Lower Silurian assemblage within 
the Creg subterraine, a sub-division of the Alexander terrane. This assignment is 
contentious.  
 
A zircon age of 595 million years "Ma" from the Lookout unit suggests that the host 
rocks to the Niblack sulphide mineralization were laid down in late Pre-Cambrian or 
earliest Cambrian, and thus belong to the Wales Group. Others have argued that the 
Niblack assemblage does not share the same deformation and metamorphic history as 
the Wales Group rocks, and is younger in age, questioning whether the zircons in the 
Lookout unit rhyolite are inherited from older basement. On the basis of possible 
inherited zircon, lack of an obvious second phase of folding, and the lack of 
amphibolite facies conditions, a younger post 484 Ma age was proposed for the 
Lookout volcanism assigning the Niblack sequence to the Descon equivalent unit, 
informally identified as the Moira Sound unit.  
 
The so defined Moira Sound unit occupies an intra-Wales setting in the immediate 
vicinity of Moira Sound and spans the Ordovician to Lower Silurian It is sub-divided 
into a basal Niblack bimodal volcanic sub-unit and younger sedimentary cover. 
 
The Niblack property is underlain by a bimodal suite of volcanic flows and 
volcaniclastic rocks that have undergone greenschist facies metamorphism. A general 
stratigraphic framework for Niblack has been constructed based on several generations 
of detailed fieldwork, drilling, and an extensive lithogeochemical database. The local 
stratigraphy comprises three main units; the Footwall dacite and rhyodacite unit, the 
Lookout rhyolite unit containing all sulphide occurrences and the Hanging Wall 
consisting of  mafic volcanic rock and subordinate volcanic-derived sedimentary 
rocks. All of these units are cut by several sets of mafic dikes. 
 
The stratigraphic sequence at Niblack has been deformed into northerly verging closed 
folds. The Lookout and Trio sulphide zones (the focus of this report) are located on the 
overturned limb of a property scale syncline, with associated smaller-scale parasitic   
S-folds. The favourable Lookout unit stratigraphy is interpreted as coming back to

surface in the Mammoth area and then occurring again, in a complex and probably 
overturned form, at the old Niblack Mine. Within the Lookout zone, folds plunge 
moderately to the southwest. 
 
The dominant rock fabric is a well developed foliation (S1) that is axial planar to F1 
folds. It dips moderately to steeply to the southwest and contains an elongation 
lineation (L1) that plunges moderately to the southeast or east-southeast. Although S1 
and L1 have likely modified the sulphide zones, the main control on the distribution 
and shape of sulphide bodies is the primary geological setting and macroscopic F1 fold 
geometry. Kink bands and crenulation cleavage locally deform S1 foliation, but is only 
locally developed, typically in areas near to recognized fault structures. 
 
Two main faults are recognized on the property: Blue Belle and Niblack Faults. The 
Blue Belle Fault is a probable brittle strike slip structure that strikes east-northeast and 
dips moderately to the south. The Blue Belle fault truncates the upper part of the 
Lookout sulphide Zone and appears to have some control on the depth of the precious-
metal rich Oxide zone. The Niblack Fault occurs on the south side of Niblack 
Anchorage and truncates the sulphide-bearing stratigraphy at the historic Niblack 
Mine. It dips moderately to the southwest. No Lookout unit equivalent rocks have been 
identified north of the Niblack fault, suggesting this fault may represent a major 
structural break. Foliation parallel shear zones are common along the long limb 
domains of parasitic folds in the Lookout zone area. These structures generally have a 
subtle textural expression in drill core and are locally occupied by S1 parallel dikes. 
 
Deposit Types and Mineralization 
 
The Niblack project is considered prospective for volcanogenic sulphide 
mineralization. Deposits of this type form by submarine hydrothermal processes on 
and beneath the seafloor, are associated with penecontemperaneous volcanism, and 
contain commercially important concentrations of several metals (polymetallic). The 
most common metals of commercial significance are copper, zinc, lead, gold, and 
silver. 
 
Southern Prince of Wales Island represents a district of volcanogenic sulphide 
occurrences and deposits that extends 110 kilometres in length and is thirty kilometres 
wide. The massive sulphide deposits in the Wales Group include the Big Harbor, 
Copper City, Corbin, Keete Inlet, Khayyam, Ruby Tuesday, and Stumble-On deposits, 
and those in the Moira Sound unit include the Barrier Islands, Moira Copper, Niblack, 
and Nichols Bay deposits. Several of the deposits were mined during the early 1900's. 
The mineral resource reported herein easily establishes Niblack as the largest and most 
significant of the deposits.  
 
Niblack differs from the classic VMS model, in that the majority of the sulphide 
mineralization appears to have taken place beneath the seafloor within porous 
unconsolidated volcanic fragmental rocks, yielding replacement zones of semi-massive 
and massive sulphide that are semi-conformable to stratigraphy, and often grade 
laterally and vertically into zones of heavy disseminated, stringer and replacement 
sulphide. 
 
Niblack is host to six main massive sulphide occurrences: Lookout, Trio, Dama, 
Mammoth, Lindsy, and the historic Niblack Mine. Current distribution of the sulphide 
zones is controlled by fold repetition of the host Lookout unit rhyolite, with the 
Lookout and Trio Zones located on the overturned limb of a property-scale synclinal 
fold. The Lookout and Trio Zones are separated by a strike distance of approximately 
300 metres, and are the only two occurrences with sufficient density of drilling and 
number of mineralized drill intercepts to warrant estimation of mineral resource.

There are five main styles of sulphide mineralisation at Niblack, several of which are 
gradational with or hybridized with one another. Metals of economic significance 
include copper, zinc, gold and silver. Lead is locally elevated, but rarely exceeds one 
percent, and is unlikely to ever be recovered as a separate concentrate. Gold grade is 
higher than average for volcanogenic systems, and is associated with all styles of 
mineralization. Concentration of undesirable trace elements such as arsenic, antimony, 
cadmium, mercury, and selenium are low for the deposit type. Except for oxide 
material, the mineralogy, grain size, and metal ratios are very similar between the 
various styles of mineralization. 
 
Exploration and Drilling 
 
In 2005, following the transfer of the property, Niblack's a new geological model was 
confirmed by drilling in late 2005, when sulphide mineralization was intersected in 
every hole and produced the widest intersection drilled to date. Follow-up surface drill 
programs were completed in 2006 and 2007 to delineate the Lookout and Trio zones. 
Additional holes also targeted the Niblack Mine, Mammoth and Dama Zone areas.  
 
In 2006 Niblack initiated permitting for an underground exploration program. 
Following receipt of necessary permits and approvals, a new portal, and a 850 metre 
access drift was constructed between September 2007 and July 2008. An initial phase 
of underground drilling was completed between November 2007 and February 2008 in 
and around the Mammoth Zone. A second underground drilling program was initiated 
in June 2008, to evaluate the depth extension of the Lookout Zone down plunge. None 
of the underground drilling is included in the initial mineral resource estimate reported 
herein. 
 
To date, a total of 218 surface core boreholes and nine underground core boreholes 
have been drilled on the Niblack project (55,103 metres) between 1975 and 2008. Drill 
core and original drill logs are available for all drill holes. Core recovery was good to 
excellent. Historical core was re-logged in 1993 to standardize rock descriptions. All 
drilling and core logging data has been collected in Imperial units (data is converted to 
metres for this report). Within the Lookout and Trio Zones, most of drilling is 
completed on north-south sections nominally spaced at fifty or 100 feet (fifteen to 
thirty metres). All collars were surveyed using a theodolite. Downhole surveys were 
completed in all boreholes except NIB-01 to NIB-06, drilled by Cominco, and holes 
LO-002 to LO-012, drilled by Noranda. 
 
Sampling Method, Approach and Analyses 
 
There are no records of historical sampling procedures used by previous project 
operators. Review of archived core indicates that assay samples were collected from 
half core split or sawn lengthwise. The majority of samples are five feet (1.52 metres) 
in length or less, and generally consist of material containing visible sulphide minerals.  
 
Since 2005, Niblack began collecting assay samples from half core split lengthwise 
with a diamond saw. Core is sampled at five feet (1.52 metre) intervals honouring 
geological, alteration and mineralization boundaries. Sampling intervals were marked 
by a geologist and core was typically sampled continuously across the sulphide zones, 
including post-mineral dikes, and generally included shoulder samples on either side 
of a mineralized zone. Care was taken to split the core perpendicular to the sulphide 
mineralization.  
 
No records of sample preparation and security protocols for historical samples were 
made available to SRK. Assay laboratories, and analytical techniques varied for 
previous operators. Review of original assay certificates indicates analyses were 
performed at reputable laboratories using industry standard analytical techniques.

Between 1995 and 1997, Abacus used Chemex Laboratories (predecessor to ALS 
Chemex). Core samples were assayed for gold using a fire assay procedure and multi-
element using aqua regia digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma ("ICP") 
spectrometry. 
 
Niblack used the ISO 17025 accredited ALS Chemex assay laboratory in 
North Vancouver, Canada as the primary laboratory for preparing and assaying all core 
samples collected on the Niblack project. All samples submitted for assaying were 
sealed in individual plastic bags on site, and shipped in sealed sacks by air, transport 
barge, and truck. Core samples were prepared using industry standard preparation 
procedures. All samples were assayed for gold using a standard fire assay procedure 
with atomic absorption finish on thirty grams sub-samples and a suite of thirty-three or 
forty-eight elements using a four-acid digestion procedure followed by ICP-Atomic 
Emission Spectroscopy. 
 
SRK cannot comment on the quality control measures used by previous project 
operators. The exploration work conducted by Niblack was carried out using a quality 
assurance and quality control program, generally meeting industry best practices. The 
analytical quality control data for the Niblack project include both internal and 
external quality control measures. ALS-Chemex implemented internal laboratory 
measures consisting of inserting quality control samples (blanks and certified reference 
materials and duplicate pulp) within each batch of samples submitted for assaying.  
 
Niblack also implemented external analytical quality control measures consisting of 
inserting quality control samples (blanks and certified reference standards) with each 
batch of core drilling samples. Blanks and standards were inserted at a frequency of 
one of each every twenty-five samples. At the end of the 2006 drill program, forty-two 
core duplicate samples were collected from the major styles of sulphide and oxide 
mineralization intersected in 2005 and 2006 boreholes. From 2007 onward, Niblack 
routinely inserted duplicate core samples with each batch at a frequency of one 
duplicate every thirty-three samples.  
 
The analytical quality control program developed by Niblack for this project is mature 
and is overseen by appropriately qualified geologists. In the opinion of SRK, the 
exploration data from the Niblack project was acquired by Niblack using adequate 
quality control procedures that generally meet industry best practices for a drilling 
stage exploration property. 
 
Data Verifications 
 
In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the Niblack 
project on August 8 and 9, 2007 while active drilling was ongoing. The purpose of the 
site visit was to inspect the property and ascertain the geological setting of the Niblack 
project, witness the extent of the exploration work carried out on the property and 
assess logistical aspects and other constraints relating to conducting exploration work 
in the area. During the visit, SRK examined drill core from ten recently drilled 
boreholes to ascertain the geological and structural setting of the polymetallic sulphide 
mineralization in the Lookout and Trio sulphide zones. SRK also interviewed project 
personnel regarding the exploration strategy and field procedures used by Niblack. 
 
Considering the comprehensive quality control program used by Niblack, and the 
visible presence of copper and zinc minerals in drill core examined by SRK, no 
independent verification samples were collected by SRK. 
 
SRK conducted routine verifications to ascertain the reliability of the electronic 
borehole database provided by Niblack. Approximately forty percent of assays within

the modelled sulphide and oxide domains were checked against the original 
certificates. For pre-Niblack data, SRK verified the electronic data against available 
paper records. Minor discrepancies arising from truncated assay results were corrected. 
 
After review, SRK is of the opinion that the Niblack drilling database and geological 
model are sufficiently reliable for resource estimation. 
 
SRK aggregated the assay results for the external quality control samples for further 
analysis. Sample blanks, and certified reference materials data were summarized on 
time series plot to highlight any potential failure. 
 
Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
Two metallurgical test programmes have been completed on Niblack composite 
samples. The first test was completed at Placer Dome's Metallurgical Research Centre 
in 1990. The second test programme was conducted in 1997 at Met Engineers Ltd on 
behalf of Abacus Mineral Corporation. Both programmes were conducted on a 
laboratory bench-scale basis on composite core samples. 
 
The test results from the Placer Dome work indicate very high metal recoveries for 
copper, zinc, gold and silver. 
 
In the Met Engineers Ltd programme, although four composite samples were prepared, 
metallurgical testing was apparently conducted on the massive low-lead composite 
only.  The test work focused on the flotation of two separate copper and zinc 
concentrates, The flotation tests were conducted using standard industry flowsheets 
and reagents for the production of two separate concentrates, copper and zinc, by 
differential flotation techniques. The results show good copper recovery averaging 
85.8 percent with excellent copper concentrate grade averaging 30.6 percent copper. 
The zinc recovery into the zinc concentrate showed a high variance ranging from 12.7 
to 66.5 percent, averaging 47.1 percent achieving overall good zinc concentrate 
averaging 56.5 percent zinc.  However, a significant portion of the zinc reported to a 
copper-zinc scavenger concentrate. Based on the available data, SRK can not verify 
the representativeness of the composites used in these two metallurgical programmes. 
 
Mineral Resource Estimation 
 
The mineral resource model presented herein represents an initial resource evaluation 
for the Niblack polymetallic sulphide deposit. The resource estimate was completed by 
Abolfazl Ghayemghamian, P. Geo, an independent qualified person as this term is 
defined in National Instrument 43-101.  The effective date of this resource estimate is 
September 10, 2008.  
 
The resource database was audited by SRK and the mineralization boundaries were 
reviewed and adjusted by SRK using a geological interpretation prepared by Niblack. 
SRK is of the opinion that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to 
interpret with confidence the boundaries of the sulphide mineralization domains and 
that the assaying data is sufficiently reliable to support estimating mineral resources. 
 
A total of fourteen separate wireframes were constructed in Datamine Studio from the 
drilling data: eight wireframes for the Lookout Sulphide Zone, one wireframe for the 
Lookout Oxide Zone and five wireframes for the Trio Sulphide Zone. Boundaries of 
the wireframe domains were determined based on geology and a one to two percent 
copper equivalent grade that is considered useful to separate the sulphide 
mineralization. Statistical analysis and resource estimation work was completed in 
Datamine, whereas variography was completed in Sage2001.. A total of 102 boreholes, 
with 1,970 assay records are located within the mineralized oxide and sulphide

domains. A topography surface was created from digital contour data generated from 
aerial photographs. 
 
A Datamine sub-block routine was used to fill the sulphide and oxide mineralization 
wireframes with blocks aligned with the Alaska State Plane in imperial units (NAD27 
datum). The easting and northing coordinates have been truncated to reduce their 
length. Parent block size was sent at fifteen, by six by six feet (with minimum block 
size of 1.87 by 0.75 by 0.006 feet). 
 
Experimental variograms and variogram models were generated for each metal in both 
oxide and sulphide domains. Omnidirectional variogram models were considered 
appropriate for this study. The nugget values range from fifteen to twenty-five percent 
of the total sill. 
 
Metal grades and specific gravity were estimated into the block model. Metal grades 
were estimated in three successive steps using search neighbourhood determined by 
variography, increasing search radii and to limit extrapolation. Estimation of sulphide 
domains considered rotated search neighbourhood to adapt to changing geometries of 
the sulphide mineralization. The estimation parameters were established after visual 
review of several tests. Specific gravity was estimated into the block model using an 
inverse distance estimator to account better for the high variability of this parameter 
inside the sulphide and oxide zones. Unestimated blocks were assigned average 
specific gravity of 2.66 and 3.1 for the oxide and sulphide domains, respectively 
 
The Niblack mineral resources were classified according to the CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) by Ablofazl 
Ghayemghamian, P. Geo, an appropriate independent qualified person for the purpose 
of National Instrument 43-101. Resource blocks informed by two or more holes 
contributing at least six composites to the estimate and located at an average distance 
of less than seventy-five feet from the informing composites were assigned an 
Indicated Mineral Resource classification. All other resource blocks were assigned an 
Inferred Mineral Resource classification. An Indicated resource envelope was then 
modelled around the Indicated resource blocks to delineate more regular areas with the 
same classification category. 
 
The resource block model was validated by comparing local "well-informed" block 
grades with composites contained within those blocks; and by comparing average 
assay grades with average block estimates along different directions (swath plots). 
 
The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement for a mineral 
resource generally implies that the quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic 
thresholds, and that the mineral resources are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade 
taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. There are five 
metals of economic significance in the Niblack deposit. Four metals (copper, gold, 
silver and zinc) contribute significantly to the value of this mineralization. 
Accordingly, the mineral resources are reported at a US$50 per tonne net smelter 
return ("NSR") cut-off grade considering the likely underground mining extraction 
scenario that would be used to mine this mineralization. The mineral resource 
statement for the Niblack polymetallic sulphide deposit is presented in Table i.

Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource classification 
reported herein are a reasonable representation of the global copper, zinc, lead, gold 
and silver mineral resources found in the Niblack deposit. Mineral resources are not 
mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 
certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral 
reserve. 
 
Following geostatistical analysis and variography, SRK constructed a new mineral 
resource block model for the Niblack deposit constraining grade interpolation to within 
the two modelled mineralization domains. After validation and classification, SRK 
considers that the mineral resources for the Niblack project are appropriately reported 
at a NSR cut-off of US$50 per tonne, considering the likely underground mining 
scenario that would be used to extract this mineralization.  
 
In reviewing the mineral resource model, SRK draws the following conclusions: 
 

• An NSR cut-off grade of US$50 per tonne is considered appropriate for 
reporting underground mineral resources for this project; 

• Most of the high grade gold and silver resource blocks are located at higher 
elevations in the oxide zone;  

• Conversely, almost all high grade copper and zinc blocks are located in the 
sulphide zone;  

• Overall, the sulphide zone carries ninety-seven percent of the mineral 
resources;  

• All highest grade blocks, with estimated US$NSR larger than US$200 per 
tonne, are located in the sulphide zone between -100 to 1,570 foot elevations; 
and 

• A drilling spacing at fifty to sixty feet should be sufficient to allow converting 
Inferred Mineral Resource into an Indicated category. 

 
SRK considers that a 10,000 metre drilling program is warranted to test the depth and 
lateral extension of the Lookout Zone from the underground workings (5,000 metres) 
and an additional 5,000 metres of drilling from the surface to expand the Trio Zone at 
depth and test other targets along the fertile Lookout rhyolite unit.

SRK also recommends that Niblack continues to characterize the context of the 
Niblack sulphide deposit by undertaking engineering and metallurgical studies that 
may ultimately lead into the preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment for 
the Niblack project. 
 
The total costs for the recommended work program are estimated at approximately 
US$4.0 million including five percent administrative charges and a ten percent 
contingency. The costs for the drilling program are estimated at approximately 
US$3.25 million based on actual costs for recent drilling programs completed by 
Niblack.

1 Introduction 
 
The Niblack property is a resource delineation stage polymetallic exploration 
project located in south eastern Alaska, approximately fifty kilometres 
southwest of Ketchikan, Alaska. The project encloses several polymetallic 
volcanogenic sulphide occurrences, including two zones Lookout and Trio 
where Niblack Mining Corp. ("Niblack") focussed its drilling efforts.  
 
During the third quarter of 2007, Niblack commissioned SRK Consulting 
(Canada) Inc. ("SRK") to review and audit the exploration work undertaken by 
Niblack, and to prepare an initial mineral resource estimate for the Lookout 
and Trio volcanogenic sulphide zones. 
 
This technical report, documenting the resource model constructed by SRK, 
was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and is in 
conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines". 
 
During the course of preparing the resource estimate, Niblack entered into a 
merger agreement with Committee Bay Resources Ltd. Effective October 1, 
2008, Committee Bay Resources acquired all of the issued shares in Niblack.   
 

1.1 Scope of Work 
 
The scope of work, as defined in the letter of engagement presented to Niblack 
in May 2007, consists in the preparation of an initial mineral resource estimate 
for two volcanogenic sulphide zones (Lookout and Trio) delineated by Niblack 
during 2005, 2006 and 2007 and compilation of an independent technical 
report in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 Form 43-101F1 
guidelines. This typically requires an assessment of the following aspects of 
the project: 
 

• Topography, landscape, access; 
• Regional and local geology; 
• Exploration history; 
• Audit of exploration work carried out by Niblack; 
• Mineral resource estimation; 
• Validation; and 
• Recommendations for additional work.

1.2 Work Program 
 
The mineral resource estimate for the Niblack copper-zinc-silver-gold-zinc 
deposit is a collaborative effort between Niblack and SRK personnel. The 
geological model and outlines for the volcanogenic sulphide mineralization 
were constructed by Niblack personnel during a period from September 2007 
to May 2008, and were reviewed by SRK. In the opinion of SRK, the 
geological model is a reasonable representation of the Niblack mineralization. 
The geostatistical analysis, variography and grade models were completed by 
SRK during the month of June and July 2008. The mineral resource statement 
was presented to Niblack in late August 2008 and disclosed publically in a 
news release issued by Niblack on September 10, 2008. 
 
The technical report was assembled in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada during 
the months of September and October 2008. 
 

1.3 Basis of the Technical Report 
 
This report is based on information collected by SRK during a site visit 
performed in August 2007 while active drilling was ongoing, on additional 
information provided by Niblack, and other information obtained from the 
public domain. SRK has no reason to doubt the reliability of the information 
provided by Niblack. 
 
This technical report is based on the following sources of information: 
 

• Discussion with Niblack personnel; 
• Inspection of the Niblack project area, including drill core from the 

Lookout and Trio volcanogenic sulphide deposits; 
• Review of the exploration data collected by Niblack; and 
• Additional information from public domain sources.

2 Reliance on other Experts and 
Declaration 
 
SRK's opinion contained herein and effective September 10, 2008, is based 
on information provided to SRK by Niblack throughout the course of SRK's 
investigations, which in turn reflect various technical and economic conditions 
at the time of writing. Given the nature of the mining business, these 
conditions can change significantly over relatively short periods of time. 
Consequently, actual results may be significantly more or less favourable.  
 
This report includes technical information that may require subsequent 
calculations to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages. Such 
calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently 
introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not consider them to 
be material.  
 
SRK is not an insider, associate or an affiliate of Niblack, and neither SRK nor 
any affiliate has acted as advisor to Niblack or its affiliates in connection with 
this project. The results of the technical review by SRK are not dependent on 
any prior agreements concerning the conclusions to be reached, nor are there 
any undisclosed understandings concerning any future business dealings. 
 
SRK has not performed an independent verification of land title and tenure as 
summarized in Section 3 of this report. SRK did not verify the legality of any 
underlying agreement(s) that may exist concerning the licenses or other 
agreement(s) between third parties relating to the Niblack Property. 
 
SRK verified the tenure information on the Alaska Land Records website as of 
the effective date of this technical report. SRK has relied on information 
extracted from the Alaska Land Records as to the actual status of the mineral 
titles relating to the Niblack property. SRK has also relied on an opinion 
prepared by Guess & Rudd P.C. on behalf of Niblack as communicated to 
Niblack in two Limited Title Reports dated September 21, 2005 and April 2,

3 Property Description and Location 
 
The Niblack mineral property is located on southern Prince of Wales Island 
about fifty kilometres south-west of Ketchikan, southeast Alaska.  The claims 
lie to the south, west and north of Niblack Anchorage, a small bay off Moira 
Sound. The property is in the Ketchikan Recording District, with the area of 
immediate interest centered at about 55 degrees and 04 minutes latitude north 
and 132 degrees and 05 minutes longitude west, on Craig A-1 USGS Map 
Quadrangle geographic map sheet (see Figure 1). 
 

3.1 Land Tenure 
 
The Niblack property presently consists of eighteen patented mineral claims 
surrounded by 146 contiguous staked Federal mineral claims, and seven State 
of Alaska tideland claims. The total land package covers an aggregate area of 
approximately 3,300 acres (about 1,330 hectares). Figure 2 shows the 
approximate property outline. The mineral resources reported herein are 
located within both patented and Federal mineral claims. The boundaries of the 
patented claims have been legally surveyed; boundaries of the other claims 
have not. A listing of the mineral titles included in the Niblack project is 
presented in Appendix A. 
 
The mineral resources reported herein and the underground are located on 
Patented Claims and State Alaska Claims as indicated on Figure 2. 
 

3.2 Underlying Agreements 
 
Niblack has a 100 percent interest in the Niblack property subject to a fifteen 
percent Net Profits Interest to Cook Inlet Regional Inc. (a regional native 
corporation) and a sliding scale 1-3 percent Net Smelter Return Royalty 
("NSR") to Barrick Gold Corporation. Two patented mineral claims (Trio and 
Broadgauge) are subject to a second sliding scale, 1-3 percent NSR to the 
estate of the original vendors. A fifty-one percent back-in right held by Teck-
Cominco Limited and its subsidiary, through an agreement with the previous 
property owners, has been removed, subject to a recent option agreement 
between Niblack and Teck-Cominco. Greater detail on the various underlying 
agreements can be found in a technical report by D. Green (2007).

3.3 Environmental Considerations 
 
The Niblack project is an undeveloped exploration project in an area of 
historical mining. Remnants of mining activity ca. 1905 include a waste rock 
dump covering an approximately 1 acre area and several short adits, shafts and 
pits throughout the property. Heavy rainforest has overgrown and obscured 
much of this early work. Other, more recent, surface disturbance associated 
with modern exploration efforts includes cut grid lines and helicopter serviced 
drill pads, all of which have partially or completely been reclaimed.  
 
Following acquisition of all necessary permits and approvals, Niblack 
commenced an underground exploration program in 2007. The program 
included the construction of a new portal, an 850 metre long access drift, 
1,500 metres of road, a barge landing and moorage facility, sediment ponds, 
water treatment facility, fuel farm, waste rock storage areas, and various 
laydown and storage areas (Figure 3).  
 
The Operational Characterization Plan for the underground program includes  
a geochemical characterization of each blast round to segregate potentially 
acid generating/metals leaching waste rock from non-acid generating/non-
metals leaching waste rock. Potentially acid generating/metals leaching waste 
rock is stored on a lined facility, with run-off water collected and directed to a 
water treatment facility. At the time of this report no chemical treatment has 
yet been required. According to the State of Alaska approved Reclamation 
Plan, upon project closure the potentially acid generating waste rock will be 
placed back underground and the drift sealed with a concrete plug. A 
reclamation bond totalling US$1.22M has been posted for this work along with 
other reclamation and long term monitoring.  
 
Niblack has obtained baseline archaeological and environmental studies, 
which, although not exhaustive, are not known to have identified any 
substantial concerns which might limit or preclude future development of the 
Niblack project. 
 
There are no known aboriginal or surface rights issues relating to the project 
area.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local 
Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 
 
Access to the Niblack project area is typically gained by float equipped 
aircraft, helicopter, or boat from Ketchikan.  
 
Climatic conditions are typical of the Alaska Panhandle region, with warm 
summers and relatively wet, cool winters. Snow cover can be heavy at higher 
elevations. Rainfall is often very heavy, with average annual precipitation of 
about 442 centimetres (174 inches). The area encompassed by the claims is 
covered by temperate rainforest at lower elevations, giving way to sparse     
sub-alpine vegetation at the highest elevations. The property terrain is 
mountainous, with moderate to very steep slopes rising up from Niblack 
Anchorage. Total relief is approximately 700 metres (2,300 feet). 
 
The nearest supply centre is Ketchikan (population 8,000), where there is a 
deepwater seaport and an international airport, with regular daily jetliner 
service to Seattle, Washington (see Figure 1). A sophisticated marine-highway 
barge and ferry system provides efficient marine transport of goods between 
the communities of southeast Alaska, British Columbia and Washington State. 
A variety of contractors, service providers, and resource industry professionals 
are available in Ketchikan.  
 
The property is remote from population centres, and would require on-site 
accommodation for a mining operation. The present camp facility is well 
suited to an exploration program with up to fifty people. A 100 metre long pile 
secured floating dock, and barge moorage/landing facility has been constructed 
on site to facilitate marine transport of equipment and supplies. 
Accommodations, cafeteria and office space are provided by a floating barge 
camp.  
 
Newly constructed roads, totalling approximately 1,500 metres, connect the 
barge ramp to the portal and core logging facility. Beyond these areas, 
helicopter and foot are the most efficient means of on-site travel. 
 
Power is not available in the immediate vicinity of the property. Water is 
plentiful on the property, and includes several streams, and lakes.

5 History 
 

5.1 General History 
 
The Niblack area has been explored for minerals since the initial copper 
discovery at Niblack Anchorage made in 1899. The Niblack Mine was 
developed at the site of the initial discovery as early as 1902. Available records 
show that the mine shipped ore from 1905 through 1908, producing just over 
30,000 tons grading about 3.2 percent copper, 0.04 troy ounce per ton ("opt") 
gold and 0.68 opt silver. The mine was closed in late 1908, believed to be the 
result of litigation. 
 
The Niblack Mine was developed on five levels to a depth of about 300 feet 
(ninety-one metres) below surface, with access by a shaft inclined at seventy 
degrees to the west. Several exploration adits were driven in the general area, 
at unspecified dates. Most are very short and some are still accessible for 
mapping and sampling. 
 
In the period 1974 - 1976, the property was explored by Cominco American 
Incorporated ("Cominco"). Work consisted of line-cutting, geological 
mapping, soil sampling and geophysical surveys. Six diamond drill holes 
totalling 2,893 feet (882 metres) were completed in the area of the Niblack 
Mine. Three holes cut short intervals of copper mineralisation, but on the 
whole the work was not encouraging, so Cominco withdrew from the project. 
 
In 1977, The Anaconda Company ("Anaconda") staked 118 claims, acquired 
the original patented claims, and did line-cutting, geology and geochemistry. 
Gold-bearing limonitic mineralisation was discovered on surface at Lookout 
Mountain at the "Anaconda Pit". One 1,132 foot (345 metre) diamond drill 
hole was completed, which remained in hanging wall strata throughout its 
entire length. 
 
In 1980, Noranda Exploration Incorporated ("Noranda") optioned the property, 
with the underlying obligations, from Anaconda. Noranda did geological 
mapping and geophysics, and diamond drilled eighteen core holes (8,536 feet 
or 2,602 metres) in the Lookout Mountain area. 
 
In 1984, Lac Minerals (USA) Incorporated ("Lac") entered into a joint venture 
with Noranda. Over the next six years, work consisted of detailed geological 
mapping, soil geochemical sampling, and two electromagnetic ("EM") 
surveys. From 1984 to 1989, Lac completed twenty diamond drill holes 
(11,364 feet or 3,464 metres).  . The property was then held on care and 
maintenance until the 1992 field season. 
 
Lac resumed work in 1992, initially focussing on re-logging of drill core, 
extensive rock sampling for a lithogeochemical study, detailed structural 
geology studies, and various ground and airborne geophysical surveys,

including EM, magnetics, induced polarization ("I.P.") and radiometrics. A 
further fifteen diamond drill holes (15,712 feet or 4,789 metres) were 
completed in 1992 and 1993. In late 1994, Lac was acquired by Barrick Gold 
Corporation ("Barrick"). 
 
In early 1995, Abacus Minerals Corp. ("Abacus") acquired the rights (and 
obligations) in the Niblack property from Barrick and Noranda. Abacus 
actively explored the property between 1995 and 1997. Work included 
compilation of existing data, an extensive line-cutting program, soil 
geochemical sampling, geophysical surveys, trenching in the area of the old 
Niblack Mine, prospecting and geological mapping, and structural geology 
studies. Diamond drilling on the Niblack property from 1995 to the end of the 
1997 program totalled 101 holes (84,895 feet or 25,876 metres). A resource 
estimate was prepared at the end of both the 1996 and 1997 field seasons.  
 
In late 2004, Abacus transferred ownership of the Niblack property to a new 
company incorporated under the name Niblack Mining Corporation. Niblack 
has explored the property from late 2005 until present. 
 

5.2 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
On the basis of diamond drilling up to the end of 1996, Price (1997) estimated 
an overall resource for four zones in the Lookout Area that were supported by 
sufficient drilling information. The reader is cautioned that this historical 
resource estimate was prepared before the development of National Instrument 
43-101 and therefore should not be relied upon. The historical mineral 
resources were estimated using a polygonal methodology on vertical sections 
and included several thin intercepts that were added for the sake of continuity. 
The historical resources polygons were classified as "indicated" if they 
included a drill hole intercept and as "inferred" for those polygons projected 
beyond the drilling data to a maximum of 150 feet in dip direction and fifty 
feet (15.2 metres) along strike. Grades for "inferred" polygons were assigned 
based on adjacent "indicated" polygons.  
 
Indicated blocks were limited to sections with drill hole intercepts. Projections 
were a maximum of twenty feet (7.62 metres) in the dip direction, or half way 
to the next drill hole. Strike projection was limited to twenty-five feet (7.6 
metres) in each direction, which is halfway to the adjacent section. No 
minimum thickness criterion was used, but most blocks have a true thickness 
greater than three feet (0.9 metre), and many of the thinner blocks are high 
grade and thus will stand dilution. Inferred polygons were extended in the dip 
directions beyond indicated blocks, and in the strike direction beyond indicated 
and inferred material. 
 
The 1996 estimate was updated based on 1997 drill results, with the addition 
of a small resource in the Trio area (Peatfield, 1997). Results of this update are 
shown on Table .

5.3 Work by Niblack 
 
In the fall of 2005, Niblack conducted a short exploration program to test new 
structural theories at the Lookout Zone. The program consisted of seven drill 
holes for a total of 6,215 feet (1,894 metres).  
 
In 2006, Niblack conducted another exploration program in which thirty-two 
drill holes, totalling 27,368 feet (8,342 metres), were completed. Drilling 
focused on expanding the Lookout zone as well as testing property wide 
targets. Concurrent with the 2006 drill program, Niblack constructed a 5,000 
foot (1,500 metres) access road from tidewater to the future portal site and land 
camp.  
 
In 2006 Niblack also initiated permitting for the establishment of a new portal 
and construction of up to 6,000 feet (1,800 metres) of underground 
development to access the deeper extents of the mineralization at Lookout 
Mountain. A similar underground program was proposed by Abacus in 1997, 
for which permits were received, but never completed due to market 
conditions at the time. Environmental work relating to the permit applications 
was carried out in 2005, 2006, and 2007, including baseline surface water 
quality studies, hydrology and meteorology monitoring programs, acid rock 
drainage studies, and various biology surveys. 
 
In 2007, concurrent with final permitting and construction of surface facilities 
to support the underground program, Niblack completed a nineteen borehole 
drill program totalling 16,056 feet (4,894 metres). 
 
Full permits for the underground program were received in July 2007, with 
portal construction commencing September 2007. Construction of the drift was 
suspended in July 2008, and consists of an 850 metre main access drift that 
cross cuts the deepest portion of the Lookout Zone resource area. Underground 
construction was reduced in scope as a result of escalating costs, largely a 
product of having to grout the entire length of the drift; however, achieved the 
main goal of drifting through the lower reaches of the Lookout zone and 
establishing underground drill access. Fifteen metre deep muck bays and 
crosscuts were constructed every 150 metres along the main access drift that 
double as drill stations.  
 
Nine underground holes totalling 6,030 feet (1,837 metres) were completed in 
late 2007 and early 2008 in and around the Mammoth Zone target, located near 
to the portal entrance. A second underground drilling program was initiated in 
the summer of 2008 to expand the Lookout Zone resource down plunge and 
down dip in areas below, around, and above the drift. A secondary goal of the 
underground drilling is to add confidence to deeper portions of the resource 
where there is lower density of drill holes. None of the underground drilling is 
included in the initial mineral resource estimate reported herein.

6 Geological Setting 
 

6.1 Regional Geology 
 
The southern part of Prince of Wales Island is underlain by the Alexander 
tectonostratigraphic terrane (Eberlein et al., 1983). The Alexander terrane 
extends along the coast of northwest British Columbia northward through the 
Alaskan panhandle into the Saint Elias Mountains of British Columbia and the 
Yukon, and westward into the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska (Wheeler and 
McFeely, 1991). According to Gehrels and Berg (1994), the Alexander terrane 
evolved along a convergent plate margin from Precambrian-Cambrian through 
Early Devonian time, with deposition of arc-type igneous and sedimentary 
rocks. These were subsequently deformed and metamorphosed during Middle 
Cambrian-Early Ordovician and Middle Silurian-earliest Devonian orogenies. 
The Middle Devonian through Early Permian was marked by relative tectonic 
stability with deposition of shallow marine carbonate, clastic rocks and 
subordinate mafic-intermediate volcanic rocks (Gehrels and Saleeby, 1987). 
Late Triassic rift-related volcanic and sedimentary rocks were deposited 
unconformably on the Permian and older rocks (Gehrels et al., 1986). 
Overprinting deformation and metamorphism occurred mainly during mid-
Jurassic through Cretaceous accretion of the Alexander terrane to inboard 
Cordilleran terranes (Berg et al., 1972; Coney et al., 1980), with further 
dismemberment occurring along regional-scale right-lateral strike slip faults 
during Tertiary and Recent times. 
 
The Alexander terrane is further sub-divided into the Admiralty and Craig 
subterranes, with Prince of Wales Island lying wholly within the latter sub-
division. Eberlein et al. sub-divided the stratigraphy of the terrane in this area 
into: the dominantly volcanic and slightly older (pre-Middle Ordovician) 
Wales Group (the Wales metamorphic suite of Gehrels and Saleeby (1987a, 
1987b)); the younger (Ordovician to Lower Silurian), sedimentary-dominated 
Descon Formation; and the still younger (Lower Devonian) volcanic and 
sedimentary Karheen Formation. Rocks at Niblack Anchorage have 
traditionally been thought to be part of the Descon Formation, although this 
assignment is contentious. 
 
A published (Gehrels et al., 1996) zircon age of 595 million years "Ma" from a 
quartz crystal rich tuffaceous rhyolite of the Lookout unit suggests that the 
host rocks to mineralization on the property were laid down in late pre-
Cambrian or earliest Cambrian time and thus belong to the Wales Group. This 
age assignment has been questioned recently by Slack et al. (2006) and USGS 
geologist S.M. Karl (personal communication, 2008). They argue that the 
Niblack assemblage does not share the same deformation and metamorphic 
history as the Wales Group rocks, and is younger in age. The Niblack 
assemblage shows a greenschist metamorphic overprint, consistent with the 
regional overprint of the Descon Group and inconsistent with the high grade 
amphibolites facies overprint of the Wales Group, dated at 484 Ma. Karl

questions whether the zircons in the Lookout unit rhyolite are phenocrystic or 
zenocrystic, and therefore inherited from older basement. On the basis of 
possible inherited zircon, lack of an obvious second phase of folding, and the 
lack of amphibolite facies conditions, she advocates a younger post 484 Ma 
age for the Lookout volcanism, therefore placing the Niblack host rock 
package in a Descon equivalent unit, informally identified as the Moira Sound 
unit.  
 
As illustrated on Figure 5, the so defined Moira Sound unit occupies an 
intra-Wales setting in the immediate vicinity of Moira Sound and spans the 
Ordovician to Lower Silurian. The older, Late Proterozoic through Cambrian 
Wales Group to the north and south is characterized by primitive arc 
assemblages with common interlayers of non-fossiliferous crystalline marble. 
The Moira unit has basal Niblack bimodal volcanic sub-unit and younger 
sedimentary cover. Whether latest Proterozoic or early Paleozoic in age, Duke 
(2008) argues that a case is made for a Moira Sound rift setting with a basal 
bimodal volcanic floor and rift-facies sedimentary cover occurring interior to 
Wales Group arc basement.

6.2 Property Geology 
 
The Niblack property is underlain by a bimodal suite of volcanic flows and 
volcaniclastic rocks that have undergone greenschist facies metamorphism 
(Figure 6). A general stratigraphic framework for Niblack has been constructed 
based on several generations of detailed fieldwork, drilling, and an extensive 
geochemical database that includes over 1,000 whole rock analyses. (e.g. 
Proffett, 1980; Brewer 1988; Adamson and Gray, 1995a; Price, 1996; 
Lindberg, 1997). 
 

6.2.1 Lithology 
 
Within the core area of the property, stratigraphy is comprised of three main 
units; the Footwall unit, the Lookout unit and the Hanging Wall unit (Figure 6, 
Figure 7 and Figure 8). All of these units are cut by several sets of mafic dikes. 
 
Footwall Unit: The Footwall unit consists of two dominant rock types; 
massive dacite to rhyodacite, and mafic flows, both of which are commonly 
amygdaloidal. Mafic flows locally exhibit pillow and flow breccia textures, 
and contain high nickel and chromium contents that suggest primitive basaltic 
komatiite chemistry (Adamson and Gray, 1995b). Hydrothermal alteration of 
the Footwall unit is common, and typically consists of a quartz-sericite-pyrite 
mineral assemblage. The alteration is pervasive and where most intense can 
make visual differentiation of basalt versus dacite difficult.  Less common, is 
the development of pervasive hydrothermal chlorite alteration and low grade 
pyrite+/-chalcopyrite stringer mineralization. The Footwall unit is the deepest 
stratigraphic unit observed on the property and has a minimum thickness of 
150 m. 
 
Lookout Unit: The Lookout unit, host to all known massive sulphide 
occurrences, is dominated by quartz crystal rich rhyolite fragmental rocks, 
with lesser amounts of aphyric to moderately quartz +/- feldspar porphyritic 
rhyolite flows and domes (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Fragmental rocks typically 
contain abundant coarse quartz crystals, and range in fragment size from fine 
crystal tuff to coarse block tuff or agglomerate. Fragment composition is 
dominantly rhyolite, with minor dacite to rhyodacite and basalt. Green, 
fuchsite bearing (Cr-rich mica) mafic fragments occur in minor concentration, 
and are likely derived from high chromium mafic flows of the Footwall unit. 
Evidence exists for a probable pyroclastic origin for a significant portion of the 
fragmental units. The evidence includes wide areal distribution of correlative 
quartz crystal tuff units, 'jig-saw' style fragmentation of individual quartz 
crystals (suggesting in-situ quench shattering of hot crystals), flattened vesicle 
rich pumice (?) fragments, and the generally thick, massive, poorly bedded 
character of the unit. Coarse polylithic fragmental rocks are common, and 
often host to heavy sulphide replacement mineralization, with an apparent 
correlation between fragment size, and by inference porosity, with total 
sulphide content. These rocks have historically been referred to as the PBX 
unit, or 'Polylithic Breccia', and may in part be mass flow deposits.

Figure 8: Cross Section of the Niblack Property. 
 
Massive flows and domes of rhyolite occur from the stratigraphic base through 
to the stratigraphic top of the Lookout unit. Flows and domes are commonly 
steep sided, can be over 100 metres in height, and are locally flanked by 
monolithic autoclastic breccias. A large subset of massive rhyolite flows on the 
property are referred to as 'Blue Rhyolite', which typically are cherty, weakly 
to moderately magnetic, and have a distinct pigeon gray blue colour in 
outcrop.  
 
Hydrothermal alteration is widespread throughout the Lookout unit, and 
typically consists of quartz-sericite-pyrite, locally grading outward to epidote 
+/- piedmontite and manganese carbonate mineral assemblages. Chlorite 
alteration is also present locally, although is generally much less common. 
Well developed pyrite-chalcopyrite stockwork is associated with massive 
rhyolite domes at both the Lookout and Trio zones, with high-grade massive 
sulphide locally preferentially located along dome margins. 
 
The Lookout unit is estimated at 100 metres to 200 metres thick throughout 
most of the core area of the property, although is difficult to determine with 
certainty because of folding and faulting. It is also probable that thickness 
varies considerably based on the original topography the unit was deposited 
on, this is particularly so for tuffaceous sections, which are prone to filling 
basins and depressions.  
 
A conceptual model is shown in Figure 7, which depicts the interpreted 
depositional environment. A sub-volcanic intrusion is inferred as the source of

the rhyolite, with mineralization localized along inferred subsidence related 
faults.  
 
Hanging Wall Unit: The Hanging Wall unit consists of mafic volcanic rocks 
and sedimentary rocks that are probably derived from reworked mafic 
volcanics (Figure 6). Mafic volcanic flows are restricted to the lower part of 
the unit, and include pillow basalt that is discontinuously distributed along the 
contact with the underlying Lookout unit. The dominant rocktype in the 
Hanging Wall unit is massive, poorly bedded, fine grained siltstone. These 
rocks are commonly dark green to gray, thick bedded, texturally featureless, 
and difficult to differentiate from fine grained mafic dikes or massive basalt. 
Beds of coarse fragmental material that include sedimentary rip-up clasts, and 
mafic volcanic fragments form a minor component of the Hanging Wall unit. 
Fragments within this coarser fragmental material are often dark gray to black, 
and magnetic or weakly hematitic. Well laminated, cherty mudstones 
commonly occur near the lower contact with the Lookout unit. A possible 
relationship exists between degree of silicification (chert content) and 
proximity to hydrothermal activity in the underlying Lookout unit.  
 
Where not structurally modified, the contact between the Lookout and 
Hanging Wall units is conformable. A gradational contact over a few metres is 
demonstrated locally, with the gradual decrease in quartz crystal content and 
an increase in mafic fragments and matrix. Minor amounts of re-worked quartz 
crystal detritus can occur within mafic beds up to several 10's of metres into 
the Hanging Wall unit.  
 
The Hanging Wall unit caps the hydrothermal system at Niblack. 
Mineralization found to date within the Hanging Wall unit is limited to thin 
pyrite laminations within cherty mudstones located immediately above the 
Lookout unit, and very minor base metal bearing veinlets of remobilized 
sulphide. Hydrothermal alteration includes silicification of mudstones and 
siltstones near the Lookout contact, and patchy epidote. 
 
Mafic Dikes: All stratigraphic units are cut by numerous post-mineral mafic 
dikes. The majority of the dikes can be grouped into two distinct sets. The 
dominant dike set consists of swarms of moderately southwest dipping, 
foliation parallel, aphyric to variably feldspar phyric basalt dikes. The feldspar 
content is highly variable in both size and concentration, with some dikes 
exhibiting aphyric margins, gradationally increasing to crowded, coarsely 
feldspar porphyritic cores. The dikes either post date S1 foliation, or were 
emplaced late in its formation, as evidenced by cross-cutting relationships with 
D1 folds, and emplacement parallel to S1 foliation that is axial planar to D1 
folds. Local occurrence of moderate to strong boudinage and weak to moderate 
fabric development indicate the dikes have experienced some deformation. 
These dikes are typically from two to twelve feet (0.6 to 3.7 metres) in width, 
although span a range from a few inches up to sixty-five feet (0.1 to twenty 
metres). They occur as both isolated dikes and as anastomozing swarms that 
account for over thirty percent by volume in the most heavily diked areas. 
Dikes are locally weakly mineralized with re-mobilized sulphide, typically 
occurring as sulphide veins and quartz-sulphide veins in areas where dikes cut 
massive sulphide. Dikes are weak to moderately carbonate altered (matrix 
calcite), and commonly contain disseminated fine to medium grained pyrite

cubes along dike margins. Brittle deformation of the dikes is demonstrated by 
the common occurrence of late narrow quartz veins in the dikes that are 
generally absent in the surrounding host rocks.  
 
The second set of dikes consists of sub-vertical, north to north-northeast 
trending fine to medium grained diabase. These dikes are volumetrically much 
less significant than the foliation parallel mafic dikes described above. The 
diabase dikes intrude all other rock types, and post date all major deformation 
events. Dikes typically are from fifteen to thirty feet (five to nine metres) in 
width; however, because they are sub-parallel to the dominant drilling 
azimuth, they have been intersected in drill core over lengths up to 245 feet 
(seventy-five metres). Diabase dikes are generally little altered except for the 
minor occurrence of one to two centimetres epidote clots that produce a 
distinct spotted appearance. Where the spotting is well developed the dikes 
have historically been described as 'troutite', presumably for their likeness to a 
spotted trout. 
 
Other dikes include: narrow, typically two to five feet (0.5 to 1.5 metres), 
unaltered dark black variably magnetic basalt dikes; rare strongly foliated 
mafic dikes that are possibly coeval with basalt flows in the Hanging Wall 
unit, and; very rare, coarse biotite/phlogopite(?) bearing mafic dike(s). 
 

6.2.2 Structure 
 
The stratigraphic sequence at Niblack has been deformed into northerly 
verging closed folds (Figure 6 and Figure 8). Areas included in the resource 
estimate (the focus of this report) are located on the overturned limb of a 
property scale syncline, with associated smaller-scale parasitic S-folds. The 
favourable Lookout unit stratigraphy is interpreted as coming back to surface 
in the Mammoth area and then occurring again, in a complex and probably 
overturned form, at the old Niblack Mine. This fold interpretation is based on a 
variety of geological evidence, including bedding/cleavage relationships, 
outcrop patterns (Error! Reference source not found.), and sedimentary and 
volcanic topping indicators. Within the Lookout zone, folds plunge moderately 
(thirty to fifty degrees) to the southwest. Shallow southeast plunging folds 
have also been identified on the property, suggesting possible refolding during 
a second phase of deformation.

A well developed foliation (S1), that is axial planar to F1 folds described 
above, forms the dominant rock fabric. The S1 foliation is oriented with 
moderate to steep dips (thirty to eighty degrees) to the southwest. Within the 
plane of the S1 foliation is a well developed L1 elongation lineation that is 
oriented with a moderate plunge (twenty to thirty degrees) to the southeast or 
east-southeast (Calon, 1993). Although S1 and L1 have likely modified the 
sulphide zones, it is clear that the main control on the distribution and shape of 
the sulphide zones is the primary geological setting and macroscopic F1 fold 
geometry. Kink bands and crenulation cleavage locally deform S1 foliation, 
but is only locally developed, typically in areas near to recognized fault 
structures. 
 
The two most recognizable faults on the property are the Blue Belle fault and 
the Niblack fault (Figure 6 and Figure 8). The Blue Belle fault is a relatively 
planar, brittle structure that strikes east-northeast (075 degrees) and dips fifty-
five to sixty-five degrees to the south. The structure has been traced from the 
top of Lookout Mountain, through the Lookout Zone east toward the Trio Zone 
and likely extends beyond. It is easily identified in most drill holes in the 
Lookout zone area, where it consists of 0.5 to fifteen metre wide zones of 
broken, fractured rock and gouge. Offset on the Blue Belle fault is unknown, 
but based on map patterns, strike-slip displacement is likely not more than a 
few hundred metres. The Blue Belle fault truncates the sulphide mineralization 
in the uppermost reaches of the Lookout zone, and appears to have some 
control on the depth of the precious-metal rich Oxide zone.  
 
The Niblack fault runs up the south side of Niblack Anchorage and truncates 
the sulphide-bearing stratigraphy at the historic Niblack Mine. Drilling in the 
Niblack Mine area indicates a forty-five to fifty degrees dip to the southwest. 
No Lookout unit equivalent rocks have been identified north of the Niblack 
fault, which suggests it may represent a major structural break. Rocks north of 
the fault however, are strikingly similar to the Hanging Wall unit south of the 
fault, and it is equally possible that the north side of the fault is a down 
dropped block with Lookout unit stratigraphy buried at depth (as depicted in 
Figure 8).  
 
Other faults of significance include foliation parallel shear structures identified 
in the long limb domains of parasitic folds in the Lookout Zone area. These 
structures generally have a subtle textural expression in drill core and are 
locally occupied by S1 parallel dikes. For the most part, they do not appear to 
accommodate large amounts of offset, although may prove important at the 
mine-scale.

7 Deposit Types and Mineralization 
 

7.1 Deposit Types 
 
The Niblack project is considered prospective for volcanogenic massive 
sulphide ("VMS") mineralization. Deposits of this type form by submarine 
hydrothermal processes on and beneath the seafloor, are associated with 
penecontemperaneous volcanism, and contain commercially important 
concentrations of several metals (polymetallic). The most common metals of 
commercial significance are copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver. 
 
Southern Prince of Wales Island represents a district of volcanogenic sulphide 
occurrences and deposits that extends 110 kilometres in length and is thirty 
kilometres wide. The massive sulphide deposits in the Wales Group include 
the Big Harbor, Copper City, Corbin, Keete Inlet, Khayyam, Ruby Tuesday, 
and Stumble-On deposits, and those in the Moira Sound unit include the 
Barrier Islands, Moira Copper, Niblack, and Nichols Bay deposits (Slack et al. 
2006; Ayuso et al, 2006; Figure 5). Several of the deposits were mined during 
the early 1900's, with the largest production coming from Khayyam, that 
produced about 225,000 tons of material with reported grades of 3.1 percent 
copper, 7.6 ounces of silver per ton and 0.006 ounces of gold per ton 
(Nokleberg et al. 1987; 1994). The mineral resource reported herein easily 
establishes Niblack as the largest and most significant of the deposits.  
 
The Alexander terrane is perhaps better known for younger, Late Triassic, 
volcanogenic sulphide deposits and occurrences. These are hosted by a 
discontinuous belt of rift-related volcanic and sedimentary rocks that extends 
over 600 kilometres in length from southern southeast Alaska north into 
northwest British Columbia (Dawson et al., 1991; Newberry et al. 1997). The 
most significant Late Triassic deposits are the producing precious metal-rich 
polymetallic Greens Creek mine near Juneau, Alaska and the giant 297 million 
tonne Windy-Craggy copper-cobalt deposit in the northwest corner of British 
Columbia (Geddes Resources Ltd., 1991). 
 
In the classic volcanogenic model, accumulation of sulphide minerals is 
typically attributed to precipitation near discharge sites, or vents, of 
hydrothermal fluids (Franklin et al., 1981; Lydon, 1984) that produces 
stratiform, often banded or bedded massive sulphide lenses with distinct metal 
zonation. In many cases these lenses are capped by exhalite, cherty sediment 
and argillite. Generally associated with the massive sulphide lenses are 
underlying stockwork "feeder" or "stringer" sulphide zones. Niblack differs 
from the classic model, in that the majority of the sulphide mineralization 
appears to have taken place beneath the seafloor within porous unconsolidated 
(?) volcanic fragmental rocks, yielding replacement zones of semi-massive and 
massive sulphide that are semi-conformable to stratigraphy, and often grade 
laterally and vertically into zones of heavy disseminated, stringer and 
replacement sulphide. Deposits of this type may have more irregular

geometries than bedded massive sulphide deposits, and can crosscut 
stratigraphy. Similar sub-seafloor replacement processes are attributed to the 
formation of some very large massive sulphide systems such as the >150 
million tonnes Kidd Creek deposit (Hannington et al., 1999). 
 

7.2 Mineralization 
 

7.2.1 Major Sulphide Occurrences 
 
Niblack is host to six main massive sulphide occurrences: Lookout, Trio, 
Dama, Mammoth, Lindsy, and the historic Niblack Mine. Current distribution 
of the sulphide zones is controlled by fold repetition of the host Lookout unit 
rhyolite, with the Lookout and Trio zones located on the overturned limb of a 
property-scale synclinal fold. The Lookout and Trio zones are separated by a 
strike distance of approximately 300 metres, and are the only two occurrences 
with sufficient density of drilling and number of mineralized drill intercepts to 
warrant estimation of mineral resource.  
 
Lookout Zone: At the Lookout Zone sulphide mineralization has been defined 
over a vertical distance of 450 metres, and traced continuously down plunge 
for a distance of just over 500 metres. The zone remains open for expansion in 
the down plunge direction, and is the focus of a recent underground 
exploration program. Massive sulphide mineralization occurs at three main, 
crudely stratigraphic intervals within a roughly 100 metre thick section of the 
Lookout rhyolite. The sulphide horizons are commonly linked by cross-cutting 
feeder zones of replacement and stringer mineralization yielding wide zones 
(up to sixty metres or more) of continuous sulphide mineralization.  
 
The majority of sulphide mineralization at the Lookout Zone follows two 
parallel trends referred to as the Main Lookout and South Lookout sub-zones. 
The two sub-zones are linked, with no clear defined break between them, 
although the sulphide mineralization is clearly weaker and less frequent 
between the two. Inferred syn-volcanic fault structures were likely important 
controls on focusing mineralizing fluids along these trends, and responsible for 
both the vertical stacking of massive sulphide lenses and their generaly long 
linear morphology as illustrated in a schematic diagram (Figure 10).  
 
The most laterally extensive and continuous of the three main sulphide 
horizons at the Lookout Zone is the uppermost stratigraphic horizon, located 
near the contact between the Lookout and Hanging Wall units. The middle 
horizon is thickest and likely the most attractive from a potential mining 
perspective. The three main horizons were historically referred to as A, M and 
C zones during work in the mid to late 1990s; however, this nomenclature has 
been abandoned, due to the lack of clear defined boundaries between the zones 
in areas of strong replacement-style feeder mineralization. This is particularly 
true in the core of the Main Lookout subzone, where they combine to form a 
single large zone of mineralization with dimensions that average greater than 
80 metres vertical thickness, 100 metres horizontal length, and thirty to sixty

metres in width. Folding within this area further increases the vertical 
thickness of the zone by doubling the mineralized stratigraphy back on itself. 
 

 
Figure 10: Schematic Block Diagram of Lookout Zone 
Mineralization. 
 
A gold and silver-rich oxide zone is developed at the upper reaches of the 
Lookout zone. It represents the base-metal leached, near surface expression of 
the sulphide zones found at depth. Secondary copper and zinc oxide 
mineralization is generally rare, and it is likely that the majority of leached 
base metals have been 'flushed' out of the immediate area. The zone is 
transected by the Blue Belle fault that closely parallels the hanging wall side of 
the zone and likely acted as permeable conduit for meteoric waters. The oxide 
zone (historically referred to as the Gold zone; e.g. Peatfield, 1997) extends to 
an average depth of fifty to sixty metres below surface (maximum of 
approximately 100 metres), has a strike length of a little more than 100 metres, 
and an average width of about twenty metres. The zone splits at depth, 
following the trace of the Blue Belle fault to the south, and the trace of steeply 
inclined sulphide horizons to the north.   
 
Trio Zone: Sulphide mineralization at the Trio Zone is similar to that in the 
Lookout Zone, and includes stacked horizons of massive sulphide and variable 
amounts of disseminated, replacement and stringer style sulphide 
mineralization. A new geological interpretation suggests a moderate to steep 
south to southeast plunge, roughly orthogonal to the plunge at the Lookout 
zone, with sulphide mineralization following the margins of an intensely 
stockwork-veined rhyolite flow/dome complex.  
 
Twenty of the 155 drill holes utilized in the resource estimate reported herein 
tested the Trio Zone area. The Zone has been defined over a vertical distance

of 180 metres, and traced continuously down plunge for a distance of more 
than 210 metres. The width of the Trio Zone, perpendicular to the plunge axis, 
ranges from sixty to 100 metres, with individual sulphide zones typically 
ranging from three to eight metres in true thickness.  
 
The zone is open for expansion at depth and can be effectively tested using 
surface drilling. An additional 600 metres of drift construction would be 
required to access this sulphide zone from the current underground 
development at the Lookout Zone. A low density of drilling has tested the area 
between the Lookout and Trio zones, particularly at deeper depths. 
 
Dama Zone: The Dama Zone is located 850 metres east of the Trio Zone, and 
is located in the hinge of the property-scale syncline that underlies the core of 
the Property. Within the area of Dama Zone drilling the fold appears to 
generally plunge shallow to the southwest, with massive sulphide occurring 
near the keel of the structure, at the contact between rhyolite of the Lookout 
unit and dacite of the Footwall unit. 
 
Semi-massive to massive sulphide has been drilled over a strike/plunge length 
of eighty to 100 metres. The zone is a narrow (twenty to thirty metres wide) 
with highly variable thickness. The discovery hole (LO-046) intersected 19.14 
metres (62.8 feet; true thickness unknown) grading 6.42 percent copper, 3.21 
percent zinc, 1.37 grams of gold per tonne ("g/t gold") and 53 g/t silver, and is 
the widest high-grade intercept of six holes to hit semi-massive to massive 
sulphide. A total of twenty-one holes have tested the target area, most drilled 
on relatively tight centres. No drilling tested the area between the Trio and 
Dama Zones. 
 
Mammoth Zone: Sulphide mineralization at the Mammoth Zone occurs in the 
Lookout unit near the contact with the overlying Hanging Wall unit. 
Mineralization consists of semi-massive and massive pyrite +/- chalcopyrite 
that has been defined over a strike length of 160 metres and a dip length 150 
metres. The mineralization is generally low to very low grade. Of the fourteen 
holes to test the zone, the two most significant mineralized intercepts are 1.65 
metres grading 2.74 percent copper, 0.61 g/t gold and 24 g/t silver (U001), and 
18.65 metres grading 0.47 percent copper, which includes 4.33 metres grading 
1.01 percent copper (LO-174).  
 
Lindsy Zone: The Lindsy Zone, also known as the Lindsy 88 Showing, is 
exposed in outcrop 700 metres east of the Mammoth Zone on the lower, 
northern slope of Lookout Mountain. It consists of sulphide fragments up to 
one metre in size, of varying compositions, in a quartz crystal bearing rhyolite 
fragmental. Five holes have been drilled in the general vicinity of the Lindsy 
Zone, with only one intersecting significant mineralization; 5.49 metres 
grading 0.31 percent copper, 3.64 percent zinc, 0.34 g/t gold, and 8.2 g/t silver. 
 
Niblack Mine: The Niblack Mine was mined on five levels to a depth of 
ninety metres below surface, and over a maximum strike length of about eighty 
to ninety metres. Mine plans show that ore was won from lenses dipping south 
at approximately seventy degrees and varying in thickness from 0.5 to ten 
metres. A total of twenty-one holes have been drilled in the area since 1975, 
which have extended massive sulphide 110 metres down-dip of the historic

workings. Strike length, defined by drilling below workings, is limited to about 
fifty metres and the zone appears to narrow with depth. Faulting is extensive 
and complicates the geology of the area.  
 
The Niblack Mine is one of few areas on the Niblack Property where jasper- 
massive magnetite is common, and is found in direct contact with massive 
sulphide. Zinc was not recovered or reported in the mine's production records, 
but recent drilling clearly indicates sphalerite is an important component of the 
massive sulphide. Examples of significant drill intercepts include; 4.57 metres 
grading 1.53 percent copper, 13.11 percent zinc, 2.74 g/t gold and 19.5 g/t 
silver (LO-066); and 4.57 metres grading 5.77 percent copper, 4.14 percent 
zinc, 2.40 g/t gold, and 70.6 g/t silver.  
 

7.2.2 Styles of Mineralization 
 
There are five main styles of sulphide mineralisation at Niblack, several of 
which are gradational with or hybridized with one another. Metals of economic 
significance include copper, zinc, gold and silver. Lead is locally elevated 
(greater than 1,000 parts per million "ppm"), but rarely exceeds one percent, 
and is unlikely to ever be recovered as a separate concentrate. Gold grade is 
higher than average for volcanogenic systems, and is associated with all styles 
of mineralization. Concentration of undesirable trace elements such as arsenic, 
antimony, cadmium, mercury, and selenium are low for the deposit type. 
Except for oxide material, the mineralogy, grain size, and metal ratios are very 
similar between the various styles of mineralization.  
 
Massive Sulphide: Massive, locally weakly banded pyritic sulphides, with 
variable amounts of chalcopyrite or pale sphalerite or both. Defined based on a 
total sulphide content of fifty percent or greater, although generally exceeds 
eighty percent. Metal ratios are variable, with rapid lateral and vertical changes 
from zinc dominant to copper dominant massive sulphide. No major metal 
zoning patterns have yet been identified within or between individual lenses. 
Remnant quartz crystals and siliceous fragments are not uncommon, and 
support replacement as a mechanism of mineralization for at least some 
massive sulphide. 
 
Semi-Massive Sulphide: Semi-massive sulphide is transitional between 
massive sulphide described above, and disseminated to replacement style 
mineralization described below. It is streaky sericitic, pyritic material with 
variable copper and zinc contents that are, on average, lower grade than 
massive sulphide. Semi-massive sulphide is defined based on a total sulphide 
content of between thirty and fifty percent.   
 
Disseminated to Replacement Sulphide: Consists of trace to thirty percent 
disseminations, clots, and wispy seams of sulphide replacing fragmental 
rhyolite. An increase in sulphide and base metal content is commonly 
associated with an increase in grain or fragment size of the host rhyolite. 
Mineralization typically occurs interstitial to coarser fragments with sulphide 
preferentially replacing the fine tuffaceous matrix.

Stringer and Stockwork Sulphide: Made up of altered volcanic rocks with 
veinlets of sulphides, including abundant pyrite and generally copper-rich but 
locally with significant zinc content. True stockwork is best developed in 
massive rhyolite flows and domes. Within fragmental rhyolite units stockwork 
is generally less well developed and typically consists of irregular sulphide 
stringers, often associated with the disseminated to replacement style sulphide  
 
Oxide Material: Oxide material consists of variable amounts of goethite and 
hematite in weathered volcanic rocks, with significant precious metal contents, 
especially gold, and depleted in base metals. Rocks typically contain abundant 
void space after sulphide, with locally developed zones of iron-oxide cemented 
collapse-type breccias. Gold enrichment relative to correlative sulphide zones 
is assumed to be a product of volume loss, whereby gold and silver remain in 
place while other metals are leached away.  
 

7.2.3 Mineralogy 
 
The detailed makeup of the sulphide and precious metal mineralization 
appears, as presently known, to be fairly simple. The dominant sulphide 
minerals are pyrite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. Minerals documented in the 
limited amount of polished thin section work that has been completed for the 
Niblack project, including four sections from oxidized material (Honea, 1982) 
and ten sections of various styles of sulphide mineralization (Schurer and 
Fuchs, 1989), are listed in Table 3. A more detailed summary of the thin 
section work can be found in Peatfield (1997). 
 
Grain size of the dominant sulphide species is not exceptionally fine-grained, 
nor particularly coarse-grained. A distinctive feature of sphalerite at Niblack is 
its pale colour, regardless of where it occurs on the property. This presumably 
reflects a low iron content.

8 Exploration 
 

8.1 Historical Exploration Work 
 
The Niblack property has seen a large number of exploration programs 
managed by several different companies over the past thirty years. This has 
resulted in a very large collection of data, most of which has been maintained 
and is available to Niblack, including the entire inventory of historic drill core, 
which is stored on site in roofed core racks. A chronological history of this 
work is presented in Section 5.1. A summary of historic work is presented 
below, and is taken directly from Peatfield (1997). 
 

8.1.1 Topographic Control 
 
Topography and control for work on the Niblack property has been provided 
by a number of cut-line grids at various orientations, or in some cases by direct 
location on published topographic maps, aerial photographs, or specially 
prepared orthophotographic maps. In addition, there have been several formal 
instrumental surveys, dominantly used to locate claim corners and drill hole 
collars. In general, it is safe to say that positional control of exploration data 
points at Niblack appears to be good, given the topographical challenges 
involved. 
 
Digital topographic files have been generated from orthophotographic maps. 
The digital topography correlates well with surveyed collar elevations within 
the area of the resource estimate. All data is recorded in the Alaska State Plane 
(Zone 1) coordinate system. This grid system is in Imperial units (feet). 
 

8.1.2 Geological Mapping 
 
Most companies working at Niblack have completed more or less rigorous 
surface mapping programs. The most comprehensive surface mapping has 
been that done by Anaconda, the Lac-Noranda joint venture and Abacus.  
 

8.1.3 Geochemical Surveys 
 
Extensive surface sampling of soils and rocks was undertaken by Lac and 
Noranda. The results of these surveys were compiled by Adamson and Gray 
(1995a). Several areas of anomalous soil and rock geochemistry were defined, 
with the elements of interest being copper, zinc, gold, silver and sodium.

8.1.4 Geophysical Surveys 
 
There have been a large number of geophysical surveys conducted over the 
years on the Niblack property. For the most part these have been of limited 
efficiency. The following is a brief listing of programs and results, compiled 
from various reports and in some cases second hand. 
 
Cominco (1974):  Ground magnetometer and pulse electromagnetics at the 
Niblack Mine and in the Lookout and Dama areas. Brown (1976) felt that the 
results, especially at Lookout and Dama, were "mostly invalid, due to the 
rugged terrain." 
 
Anaconda (1978-79):  Esbensen (1979) - airborne magnetic and 
electromagnetic survey (Geonics helicopter mounted in-phase - quadrature 
instrument) flown by Aerodat Limited over much of Prince of Wales Island in 
1978 and 1979. Several moderately strong conductors were detected in the 
Niblack area. 
 
Anaconda (1979):  Olm and Smith (1979) - ground checking of airborne 
anomalies in several areas, including Niblack, during 1979. Instrumentation 
included various electromagnetic techniques and ground magnetometer. Three 
lines at Lookout and two near the Niblack Mine were surveyed, with no 
positive encouragement. 
 
Noranda (1982-84):  Adamson and Gray (1995a) - surveys by Noranda used a 
so-called "modified applied potential" technique, on several grids, as well as 
Time Domain Electromagnetics ("TEM") in the Lookout area. Results were 
equivocal; apparently the terrain conditions caused problems. 
 
Lac (1985-89):  Adamson and Gray (1995a) - work by Lac involved Crone 
Pulse Electromagnetics ("CPEM") on selected lines near massive sulphide 
occurrences in several areas of the property. Results are reported to have been 
not definitive.  
 
Lac (1992):  de Carle (1992) - helicopter-borne survey, by Aerodat Limited, 
consisting of electromagnetics ("EM"), very low frequency electromagnetics 
("VLF-EM") and radiometrics over a large area including the Niblack 
property. The survey resulted in a few electromagnetic responses worthy of 
ground follow-up, mostly in areas of prior interest. Magnetic, VLF and 
radiometric data were considered to be of little or no use. 
 
Lac (1992-93):  Adamson and Gray (1995a) - summarized work by Delta 
Geoscience Ltd. ("Delta Geoscience") of Delta, British Columbia. Surface 
work covered much of the property, and included: 38.7 miles (sixty-two 
kilometres) of ground magnetics; 36.3 miles (fifty-eight kilometres) of ground 
VLF-EM; 26.6 miles (forty-three kilometres) of gradient induced polarization 
("I.P."); 6.6 miles (one kilometre) of time domain I.P.; downhole EM in ten 
holes; and downhole physical property logging in ten holes. Results of these 
surveys have been useful in defining geological trends, and several drill targets 
resulted, some of which remain untested.

EB – MN – DG – JFC / ha Niblack Resource_TR_2CN1019.000_EG_MN_DG_JFC_ha_20081023.doc October 20, 2008 

 
Abacus (1996):  Price (1996) - Delta Geoscience did some ground magnetics 
work near the Niblack Mine, and completed borehole induction system 
("Boris") surveys in three drill holes (LO-42, LO-61 and L)-63), as well as a 
Mise a la Masse survey in hole LO-61.  
 
The results of these surveys do not appear to have added significantly to the 
understanding of the property. The general impression gained by examining 
the data from the numerous geophysical surveys is that the results are in many 
cases not definitive. However, some geophysical surveys have been useful to 
outline general geological trends, and some specific drill targets have been 
defined. Down-hole pulse electromagnetic surveys appear to have been of 
limited use.  
 

8.2 Exploration Work Undertaken by Niblack Mining 
Corporation 
 
Following the transfer of from Abacus, Niblack completed a several month 
long review of the property data that included 3D-modelling of the Lookout 
zone. This review led to refinement and re-interpretation of the geological 
model and controls on mineralization. The geological model includes multiple 
(possibly as many as four) stacked massive sulphide lenses with predictable 
geometries and plunge directions. Plunge control on sulphide zones is a 
product of both the syn-depositional environment and later folding. The new 
model was confirmed through drilling in late 2005, in which Niblack 
intersected mineralization in every hole and produced the widest intersection 
drilled to date. Follow-up surface drill programs were completed in 2006 and 
2007, which expanded and better defined the Lookout and Trio zones. 
Additional holes also targeted the Niblack Mine, Mammoth zone, and Dama 
zone areas.  
 
In 2006 Niblack initiated permitting for an underground exploration program, 
and completed 1,500 metres of road building in anticipation of underground 
work starting in 2007.  
 
Following receipt of necessary permits and approvals a new portal, and 850 
metre long, shallow gradient access drift was constructed between September 
2007 and July 2008. The drift measures 4.5 by 4.5 metres, and is collared in 
the Hanging Wall unit immediately above the Lookout unit in the Mammoth 
zone area. It extends at roughly right angles through the property-scale 
syncline that underlies Lookout Mountain, and cross-cuts Lookout zone 
mineralization at the very deepest point intersected from surface based drilling. 
 
In addition to providing drill platforms with which to expand the Lookout zone 
at depth, and test upwards of two kilometres of Lookout unit stratigraphy along 
both limbs and hinge of the syncline, the drift provides excellent geotechnical 
information and valuable exposure through the Lookout zone mineralization 
and main rock units.

An initial phase of underground drilling was completed between November 
2007 and February 2008 in and around the Mammoth zone. A second 
underground drilling program was initiated in June 2008, designed to expand 
the Lookout Zone resource down plunge and down dip in areas below, around, 
and above the drift, and to add confidence in the resource model. None of the 
underground drilling is included in the initial mineral resource estimate 
reported herein.

9 Drilling 
 

9.1 Historical Drilling 
 
There have been a large number of diamond drill programs completed on the 
Niblack property, with active drill programs in 16 out of the last 33 years. To 
date, a total of 218 holes have been drilled from surface, and nine holes 
completed from underground, for a total of 55,103 metres. This does not 
include underground drilling that started in the summer of 2008, and for which 
limited data is yet available. The drilling is summarized by year in Table 4, 
including the work completed by Niblack.

Drill core and original drill logs are available for all drill holes. For the most 
part, drilling seems to have been well done, with good to excellent core 
recoveries. A re-logging program was completed in 1993 that standardized 
rocktype names and core logging conventions, and these have remained more 
or less consistent since.  
 
All drilling and core logging data has been collected in Imperial units (data is 
converted to metres for this report). Within the Lookout and Trio zones, most 
of drilling is completed on north-south sections nominally spaced at fifty or 
100 feet (fifteen to thirty metres). 
 
All drill collars were surveyed using a theodolite from known control points. 
Downhole survey data is available for all holes except NIB-01 to NIB-06, 
drilled by Cominco, and holes LO-002 to LO-012, drilled by Noranda. Drill

holes LO-002 to LO-009 are within the area of the resource estimate. They 
average less than 120 metres in length so are unlikely to have deviated 
significantly; however, accuracy of the starting azimuth and dip is unknown. 
For all other holes, both azimuth and dip were collected every 30 to 60 metres 
down hole. Surveying methods vary. 
 
Photographs have been taken of virtually all drill core. 
 

9.2 Drilling by Niblack Mining Corporation  
 
Excluding the very recent underground drilling that started in June 2008, 
Niblack has completed sixty-seven drill holes for a total of 17,145 metres. This 
represents about thirty percent of all drilling. Over eighty percent of these drill 
holes are within the area of the resource estimate.  
 
In the fall of 2005, Niblack conducted a short exploration program to test new 
structural theories at the Lookout Zone. The program consisted of seven drill 
holes (LO-155 to LO-161) for a total of 2,016 metres.  
 
In 2006, Niblack completed thirty drill holes (LO-162 to LO-193) totalling 
8,342 metres. Drilling focused on expanding the Lookout zone as well as 
testing property wide targets. Significant new mineralization was identified 
within the South Lookout subzone, and wide zones of mineralization within 
the Main Lookout subzone were extended further down plunge.  
 
In 2007, Niblack completed nineteen drill holes (LO-194 to LO-212) totalling 
4,983 metres. These holes expanded the South Lookout subzone, and doubled 
the known depth extent of mineralization at the Trio zone.  
 
Nine underground holes (U001 to U009) totalling 1,804 metres were 
completed in late 2007 and early 2008 in and around the Mammoth zone 
target, which is located near to the portal entrance. These holes were drilled 
during the early stages of drift construction, and collared within 150 metres of 
the portal.  
 
Underground drilling was suspended in February 2008 and did not resume 
again until June.  
 
All drilling from 2005 onward was completed by Connors Drilling USA. 
Surface drilling utilized modified Longyear 38 drill rigs. Crew and drills were 
transported by helicopter. 
 
All drill collars were surveyed using a theodolite from known control points. 
Downhole surveys were collected with a Reflex 'EZ-Shot' instrument at 150 
foot (45.7 metre) intervals. The instrument collected azimuth, dip and 
magnetic intensity measurements for each survey point. Azimuths for surveys 
with unacceptable magnetic intensity data were corrected in the drill database.  
 
Photographs have been taken of all drill core, and geotechnical data recorded 
for portions of some drill holes.

10 Sampling Method and Approach 
 

10.1 Historical Sampling 
 
There are no records of historical sampling procedures conducted at the 
Niblack Project by previous project operators. Review of historic drill core 
stored on site indicates core was split or sawn lengthwise in half, with one half 
sent for assay and the other half replaced in the core box for archive. The 
majority of samples are five feet (1.52 metres) in length or less, and generally 
consist of material containing visible sulphide minerals.    
 

10.2 Sampling by Niblack Mining Corporation 
 
Core assay samples were collected from half core split lengthwise with a 
diamond saw. Core was typically sampled at five foot (1.52 metre) intervals or 
along lithological breaks, whichever was earlier. Sample intervals vary in 
length, honouring geological, alteration and mineralization boundaries. In 
areas of poor recovery, as occurs locally in the oxide zone, some sample 
intervals are significantly longer than average. Sampling intervals were 
marked by a geologist and core was typically sampled continuously across the 
sulphide zones, including post-mineral dikes, and generally included shoulder 
samples either side of a mineralized zone. Care was taken to split the core 
perpendicular to the sulphide mineralization. One half was used for assaying 
and the other half replaced in the core box 
 
Prior to sampling all core was photographed and logged for geological, 
structural and geotechnical features.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and 
Security 
 

11.1 Historical Samples  
 
No records of sample preparation and security protocols for historical samples 
were made available to SRK. Assay laboratories, and analytical techniques 
varied for previous operators. Historical samples were assayed at Bondar-
clegg, X-ray Assay Labs, Chemex laboratories using industry standard 
preparation and assaying procedures. More than ninety percent of the analyses 
were performed at Chemex laboratories. It is uncertain if any of these 
laboratories were accredited at the time the analyses were performed. 
 
Between 1995 and 1997, Abacus used Chemex Laboratories (predecessor to 
ALS Chemex), and core samples were assayed for gold using a standard fire 
assay procedures and a suite of elements including the common base metals 
and silver by aqua regia digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma 
("ICP") spectrometry.  
 

11.2 Niblack Mining Corporation Samples 
 
All aspects of the sampling, handling and dispatching to the assay laboratory 
was conducted under the supervision of qualified geologists under the 
supervision of Darwin Green, P.Geo, and Vice President of Exploration. SRK 
has no reason to believe that active tampering has occurred on this project.  
 
Niblack used one primary laboratory for preparing and assaying all core 
samples collected on the Niblack project. All samples submitted for assaying 
were sealed in individual plastic bags on site, and shipped in sealed sacks by 
air, transport barge, and truck to the ALS Chemex assay laboratory in North 
Vancouver, Canada.  
 
The ALS Chemex Vancouver laboratory is accredited to ISO 9001 by QMI 
and ISO 17025 by the Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific 
test procedures, including fire assay for gold with atomic absorption and 
gravimetric finish, multi-element by ICP-AES and atomic absorption assays 
for silver, copper, lead and zinc. ALS Chemex laboratories also participate in a 
number of international proficiency tests, such as those managed by CANMET 
and Geostats.  
 
At ALS Chemex, core samples were prepared using industry standard 
preparation procedures. After reception, samples were organized into batches 
and weighed. The entire sample was then crushed, split and pulverized as 
follows; fine crush entire sample to >70 percent passing  two millimetres (-10

mesh), split off up to 1.5 kilograms and pulverize split to >85 percent passing 
75 microns.  
 
All core samples submitted to ALS-Chemex were assayed for gold using a fire 
assay procedure on a thirty grams sub-sample with atomic absorption 
spectroscopy finish. And for a suite of thirty-three or forty-eight elements 
using a four-acid digestion and ICP-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy ("AES"). 
High grade and over limit analysis were analyzed using the same four-acid 
digestion with either an AAS or AES finish.  
 

11.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 
 
Quality control measures are typically set in place to ensure the reliability and 
trustworthiness of exploration data. This includes written field procedures and 
independent verifications of aspects such as drilling, surveying, sampling and 
assaying, data management and database integrity. Appropriate documentation 
of quality control measures and regular analysis of quality control data are 
important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for the quality 
assurance program implemented during exploration. 
 
Analytical control measures typically involve internal and external laboratory 
control measures implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the 
sampling, preparation and assaying. They are also important to prevent sample 
mix-up and monitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination of samples. 
Assaying protocols typically involve regular duplicate and replicate assays and 
insertion of quality control samples to monitor the reliability of assaying 
results throughout the sampling and assaying process. Check assaying is 
typically performed as an additional reliability test of assaying results. This 
typically involves re-assaying a set number of sample rejects and pulps at a 
secondary umpire laboratory. 
 
SRK cannot comment on the quality control measures used by previous project 
operators. 
 
The exploration work conducted by Niblack was carried out using a quality 
assurance and quality control program generally meeting industry best 
practices. All aspects of the exploration data acquisition and management 
including mapping, surveying, drilling, sampling, sample security, and 
assaying and database management were conducted under the supervision of 
appropriately qualified geologists. 
 
The analytical quality control data for the Niblack project include both internal 
and external quality control measures. ALS-Chemex implemented internal 
laboratory measures consisting of inserting quality control samples (blanks and 
certified reference materials and duplicate pulp) within each batch of samples 
submitted for assaying.  
 
Niblack also implemented external analytical quality control measures for all 
Niblack drill programs. This included inserting quality control samples (blanks 
and certified reference standards) with each batch of core drilling samples.

Blanks and standards were inserted at a frequency of one of each every twenty-
five samples. At the end of the 2006 drill program, duplicate sampling of 
quartered drill core was performed on forty-two samples of 2005 and 2006 
drill core that were comprised of all of the major styles of sulphide and oxide 
mineralization. From 2007 onward, Niblack routinely inserted duplicate 
samples of quartered core with each batch at a frequency of one duplicate 
every thirty-three samples.  
 
Metallic screen gold analyses were carried out on the same forty-two samples 
of 2005 and 2006 drill core as the duplicates. Metallic Screening is a more 
reliable technique than standard fire assay in high-grade environments where 
'nugget effect' can occur. The technique produced comparable gold grades for 
most sulphide samples. Oxide samples were similarly comparable, except for 
one notable exception in which a 3.8 foot (1.16 metre) sample interval that 
assayed 22.1 g/t gold by fire assay, assayed 138 g/t gold by the metallic screen 
technique. An additional sixty-five metallic screen analyses were then 
performed on oxide samples where fire assays graded 2 g/t gold or greater. No 
material difference between the fire assay and metallic screen technique was 
detected, and 'nugget effect' is considered to not be an issue for the Niblack 
project. 
 
The analytical quality control program developed by Niblack for this project is 
mature and is overseen by appropriately qualified geologists. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the exploration data from the Niblack project was 
acquired by Niblack using adequate quality control procedures that generally 
meet industry best practices for a drilling stage exploration property.

12 Data Verification 
 

12.1 Verification by Niblack 
 
Analytical data are derived from many sources, most of which are major 
exploration companies generally regarded as reputable.  
 
In the fall of 2006, a review of assay data was conducted by Jack Der 
Weduwen, B.Sc., P.Eng and summarized in a report titled "Report on Review 
of Drill Core Analytical Data From the Niblack Property Prince of Wales 
Island, Alaska". The 2006 review focused on the assay data from 114 drill 
holes from the Lookout and Trio Zones. The primary focus was to check the 
gold, silver, copper and zinc values in the Niblack analytical database against 
the values reported in the original assay certificates. 
 
After the review was completed it was determined the analytical database 
could be broken down into three sections. The first section included all the 
drilling conducted between 1975 and 1993 by Cominco, Annaconda, Noranda 
and Lac. The second section includes all analytical data derived by Abacus 
between 1995 and 1997. The third portion includes the analytical data 
generated by Niblack in 2005 and 2006. 
 
The majority of the problems noted within the analytical database occurred 
within the first section, with analytical data collected prior to 1995. Most of the 
problems were associated with inconsistencies between sample numbers 
within the original drill log and that within the database. In several cases 
certain samples were missing from the database and in a few cases all the 
samples from a particular drill hole are absent from the database. In some 
cases, copies of the assay certificates were missing and the analytical data for 
these drill holes could not be reviewed.  
 
The majority of the analytical data reviewed agreed with the values reported in 
the assay certificates. Minor date entry problems were noted, mainly with the 
first section of the database and these discrepancies were tabulated. Within the 
portion of the database dealing with Abacus and Niblack data no problems 
were found with any significant gold, silver, copper or zinc values. 
 
In December 2006, all outstanding problems were corrected in the master 
analytical database and documented following this review. All original assay 
certificates have been found and catalogued.

12.2 Verification by SRK 
 

12.2.1 Site Visit 
 
In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the 
Niblack project on August 8 and 9, 2007 while active drilling was ongoing. 
The purpose of the site visit was to inspect the property and ascertain the 
geological setting of the Niblack project, witness the extent of the exploration 
work carried out on the property and assess logistical aspects and other 
constraints relating to conducting exploration work in the area. SRK was given 
full access to project data. 
 
During the visit, SRK examined drill core from ten recently drilled boreholes 
(LO-106, 108, 149, 159, 165, 181, 182, 189, 195 and 203) to ascertain the 
geological and structural setting of the polymetallic sulphide mineralization in 
the Lookout and Trio sulphide zones. 
 
While on site, SRK interviewed project personnel regarding the exploration 
strategy and field procedures used by Niblack. 
 
Considering the comprehensive quality control program used by Niblack and 
the visible presence of copper and zinc minerals in drill core examined by 
SRK, no independent verification samples were collected by SRK. 
 

12.2.2 Database Verifications 
 
SRK conducted routine verifications to ascertain the reliability of the 
electronic borehole database provided by Niblack. Approximately forty 
percent of assays within the modelled sulphide and oxide domains have been 
manually entered from signed assay certificates and compared with the assays 
in the current database. Overall, only thirty errors were found in assays from 
oldest drill holes (up to LO-018), representing approximately three percent of 
the checked assays. 
 
There are no electronic laboratory files from the pre-Niblack period. 
Fortunately, for that period a number of direct ASCII exports from old original 
databases were available. More than ninety percent of the pre-Niblack assays 
could be verified. Differences between the ASCII data and the assay database 
were checked against the signed laboratory certificates. Any substantial 
differences between the database and the original files were resolved. Some of 
the discrepancies included truncated assay data to two decimal places and 
averaging of several assays for some high values.  
 
For the period 2005-2008 the database considered for resource estimation was 
verified against laboratory electronic files. The discrepancies noted by SRK 
were fixed.

After review, SRK is of the opinion that the Niblack drilling database is 
sufficiently reliable for resource estimation. 
 

12.2.3 Verification of Geological Model 
 
The geological interpretation and model constructed by Niblack is based on 
integrating a vast amount of information obtained on this property since about 
1980 and incorporates detailed analysis of surface structural relationships. The 
geological interpretation and model was verified by SRK. The structural 
patterns were reviewed during the site visit along with visual inspections of 
vertical sections through the geological model. In the opinion of SRK, the 
geological model for the Niblack project is based on sufficient quality mapping 
and drilling information to allow interpreting the form lines of the main 
geological units and derive reasonable geometrical outlines for the sulphide 
zones considered for resource estimation. SRK considers that the geological 
model provides a reasonable interpretation for the Lookout and Trio Zones at 
the current level of sampling and is therefore sufficiently reliable for resource 
estimation. 
 

12.2.4 Verification of Analytical Quality Control Data 
 
Niblack made available to SRK the assay results for analytical quality control 
data accumulated on the Niblack project since 2005. 
 
SRK aggregated the assay results for the external quality control samples for 
further analysis, focussing on assay results for copper and gold. Sample 
blanks, and certified reference materials data were summarized on time series 
plot to highlight any potential failure. Field duplicate paired assay data were 
analysed using bias charts and ranked half absolute relative deviation charts.  
 
The analytical quality control data produced by Niblack are summarized in 
Table 5. Quality control data are presented in graphical format in Appendix B.

Performance of Field Blanks 
Field blanks are used to monitor contamination introduced during sample 
preparation and to monitor analytical accuracy of the lab. True blanks should 
not have any of the elements of interest much higher than the detection levels 
of the instrument being used. The blanks used in this program consistently 
returned measurable copper and zinc higher than five times the detection limit, 
a generally accepted failure threshold for blank samples (see Appendix B). 
This suggests that the blank used is not a true copper and zinc blank (rather 
than persistent contamination at the laboratory). 
 
Two different materials were used as blanks. Prior to mid 2007 Niblack used 
apparently barren historic drill core of mafic dike material that was visually 
inspected to be free of veins and sulphide mineralization. This material appears 
to have background copper and zinc values. In 2007 a certified blank was 
purchased from CDN Resource laboratories Ltd. from Delta, British Columbia. 
The performance of this certified blank is much improved with very few 
failures.  
 
Performance of Reference Material 
Reference material control samples provide a means to monitor the precision 
and accuracy of the laboratory assay deliveries. In general, performance of the 
control samples used by Niblack is good, with most assay results falling within 
three standard deviations from the mean and showing no evidence of bias. A 
few failures for control samples FCM-1 and FCM-2 were investigated by 
Niblack triggering re-assay of a few failed batches when failed batches were 
within the mineral resource areas. Thirteen such failed control samples and up 
to ten preceding and succeeding samples were re-assayed by the same 
laboratory. No failure was noticed on control sample HLLC.  
 
Performance of Field Duplicates 
Field duplicate samples are typically collected to monitor sample preparation, 
as well as homogeneity of the sample submitted for assaying. A total of sixty-
three field duplicates were taken on remaining core samples by cutting the 
archived half in two. Review of field duplicate assay paired data show no 
apparent bias between the original and duplicate assay for all metals. The gold 
duplicate assay pair is strongly skewed by one pair exhibiting large half 
relative deviation. The field duplicate data indicate the sulphide mineralization 
is homogeneous and can be reproduced reasonably from field duplicate 
samples. 
 
In general, the analytical quality control data examined by SRK suggest that 
copper, zinc, gold and silver grades can be reasonably reproduced suggesting 
that the assay results reported by the primary assay laboratory are generally 
reliable for the purpose of resource estimation. The performance of the quality 
control samples is reasonable. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the analytical results delivered by ALS-Chemex are 
sufficiently reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.

12.2.5 Density Data 
 
Bulk specific gravity was determined by the primary laboratory for sixty-six 
core samples. The laboratory took the entire core sample (typically four to 
eight inches in length), weighed it dry and then weighed it again while 
suspended in water. The specific gravity data delivered by the laboratory were 
checked against specific gravity measurements for the same samples collected 
by Niblack on site using a similar water immersion technique (Figure 14). The 
two data sources are highly correlated and have almost identical average 
values.

14 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical 
Testing 
 
Two metallurgical test programmes have been completed on Niblack 
composite samples. The first test was completed at Placer Dome's 
Metallurgical Research Centre in 1990. The second test programme was 
conducted in 1997 at Met Engineers Ltd on behalf of Abacus Mineral 
Corporation. Both programmes were conducted on a laboratory bench-scale 
basis.  
 

14.1 Testing at Placer Dome Metallurgical Center (1990) 
 
The 1990 programme done at Placer Dome's Metallurgical Centre was 
conducted on core samples collected from boreholes LO-30 and LO-33. Five 
flotation tests were conducted on these samples and the head grades are shown 
in Table 6. 
 

Table 6: Composite Core Samples Head Assays for Metallurgical 
Testing Completed at the Placer Dome Metallurgical Center (1990).

Massive High Lead 2.02 1.53 18.50 19.10  5.80 188 

 
The test results from the Placer Dome work indicate very high metal 
recoveries for copper, zinc, gold and silver as shown in Table 7. 
 
These results indicate very high metal recoveries and confirmation of these 
tests should be done.

14.2 Testing at Met Engineers Ltd Laboratory (1997) 
 
In the Met Engineers Ltd programme, four composite samples were compiled 
from multiple core boreholes completed by Abacus at the Lookout Zone 
between 1996 and 1997.  These were classified as: 
 

• Massive low lead; 
• Stringer low lead; 
• Interstitial low lead; and 
• Massive high lead. 

 
The concentrations of the elements of interests in the final solutions were 
estimated based on the grades of the head and the final residue for each 
sample. Head assays for the four samples are summarized in Table 8.

The flotation tests were conducted using standard industry flowsheets and 
reagents for the production of two separate concentrates, copper and zinc, by 
differential flotation techniques. The samples were ground to a nominal 100 
micron size for flotation and adjusted to pH 10 with lime.  
 
The results of this test work showed good metallurgical results for copper: 
 

• A good copper recovery averaging 85.8 percent ranging from 83.2 to 
89.8 percent; and 

• Excellent copper concentrate grade averaging 30.6 percent copper 
varying from 30.1 to 31.6 percent.

The zinc recovery into the zinc concentrate showed a high variance ranging 
from 12.7 to 66.5 percent, averaging 47.1 percent. The zinc concentrate was 
excellent averaging 56.5 percent zinc, varying between 51.7 and 63.2 percent. 
However, it should be noted from Table that a significant portion of the zinc 
reported to a copper-zinc scavenger concentrate. 
 
Test data indicates that reasonable gold and silver recoveries are achieved into 
the copper concentrate of 46.8 and 37.2 percent, respectively. Poor gold and 
silver recoveries were recorded into the zinc concentrates of 7.2 and 9.2 
percent, but since these metals receive little or no payfors in the zinc 
concentrate, its economic return is considered minimal. 
 
Based on the available data, SRK can not verify the representativeness of the 
composites used in these two metallurgical programmes.

15 Mineral Resource Estimation 
 

15.1 Introduction 
 
The mineral resource model presented herein represents an initial resource 
evaluation for the Niblack polymetallic sulphide deposit. This mineral resource 
model was prepared to provide an assessment of the sulphide and oxide zones 
delineated by drilling on this project and to provide Niblack management an 
independent assessment to justify additional exploration and development 
work. 
 
The resource estimate was completed by Mr. Abolfazl Ghayemghamian, P. 
Geo, an independent qualified person as this term is defined in National 
Instrument 43-101. The effective date of this resource estimate is September 
10, 2008. Marek Nowak, P.Eng, verified data quality, reviewed and validated 
the mineral resource estimates. 
 
This section describes the work undertaken by SRK and key assumptions and 
parameters used to prepare the initial mineral resource model for the Niblack 
deposit together with appropriate commentary regarding the merits and 
possible limitations of such assumptions. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource 
classification reported herein are a reasonable representation of the global 
polymetallic mineral resources found in the Niblack deposit at the current level 
of sampling. The mineral resources presented herein are reported in 
accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-
101 and have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 
"Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" 
guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of 
the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves. Mineral reserves 
can only be estimated as a result of an economic evaluation as part of a 
preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study of a mineral project. 
Accordingly, at the present level of development there are no mineral reserves 
on the Niblack project. 
 
The database used to estimate the Niblack mineral resources was audited by 
SRK and the mineralization boundaries were reviewed and adjusted by SRK 
using a geological interpretation prepared by Niblack. SRK is of the opinion 
that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with 
confidence the boundaries of the sulphide mineralization domains and that the 
assaying data is sufficiently reliable to support estimating mineral resources. 
 
Geological and mineralization wireframes were constructed using Datamine 
modelling software. Statistical analysis, variography and resource estimation

work was completed in Datamine and variography was completed in 
Sage2001. 
 

15.2 Resource Database 
 
The current data set reviewed by SRK consists of a total of 10,519 assays from 
207 drill holes. Within the resource areas, boreholes have been drilled at fifty 
to 100 foot (fifteen to thirty metres) spacing. A total of 102 holes, with 2,083 
assay records are located within the mineralized oxide and sulphide domains 
(Table 10). The borehole database was provided to SRK in an Access format. 
 
Samples have been assayed for copper, gold, lead, zinc, and silver. Assay 
results reported below the detection limit, were assigned half of the detection 
limit. For statistical analysis and grade estimation, missing assays were 
assigned zero grade. Unsampled intervals were also assigned zero grades, 
assuming that there were no visible reasons to collect assay samples.

Downhole survey information is available for all boreholes, except NIB-01 to 
NIB-06, and LO-002 to LO-012 holes drilled by Noranda. 
  
All drilling and trench data as well as the digital vertical sections were 
provided to SRK using an Alaska State Plane (Zone 1) coordinate system, 
which is in Imperial units. Resource modelling and grade estimation work has 
been conducted in this coordinate space (Datum: NAD27). The easting and 
northing coordinates have been truncated to reduce their length (Y=y-1,100,00 
and X=x-3,000,000). 
 
A topography wireframe DTM surface was created in Datamine based on 
digital contour data generated from aerial photographs. Surveyed borehole 
collar elevations honour this surface well.

Discovery Labs, and in-house measurements. For resource modelling only 
1,179 in-house measurements were used (Figure 15). In general, specific 
gravity of the Oxide zone is generally lower than in the Sulphide domain. 
Specific gravity is quite variable across the deposit area. For this reason 
specific gravity was estimated into the block model.

the Resource Areas. 
 

15.3 Evaluation of Extreme Assay Values 
 
Block grade estimates may be unduly affected by high-grade outliers. To 
mitigate this potential problem assay data are generally evaluated for high 
grade outliers. High grade outliers may be trimmed to values that, on 
probability plots (see Figure 16 and Figure 17), appear as the lower boundary 
of a small but very high grade population. After review of probability plots, 
SRK capped raw assay data as indicated in Table 11.

15.4 Solid Body Modelling 
 
The Niblack polymetallic sulphide system includes folded vertically stacked 
crudely stratiform/stratabound lenses of semi-massive to massive sulphide that 
typically grade laterally and vertically into zones of heavy disseminated, 
stringer and replacement sulphide. Using the borehole database, surface 
geological map, vertical sections and plans, Niblack personnel have developed 
and refined a 3D Datamine model for the Niblack project. The construction of 
the 3D wireframes is based on the geological model described in Sections 6.2 
and 7.2, and summarized below.  
 
Geologic History (from oldest to youngest): 
 

• Contemporaneous deposition of Lookout unit rhyolite host rocks and 
sulphide mineralization; 

• Regional north verging folds and axial planar penetrative S1 foliation 
that dips moderately to steeply to the south-southwest; 

• Intrusion of mafic dikes parallel to S1 foliation; 
• Offset along the Blue Belle fault, a brittle south-dipping, east-west 

trending structure that is hanging wall to most of the Lookout Zone 
mineralization; and 

• Intrusion of sub-vertical north-northwest trending diabase dikes. 
 
The Lookout unit is typically massive to poorly bedded, and exhibits rapid 
facies changes, from fine to coarse fragmental rhyolite. This, combined with a 
lack of distinctive internal marker horizons, impairs stratigraphic correlations 
and structural interpretation. Fold geometries within the Lookout unit, and the 
sulphide zones it hosts, are projected from folds defined by the Lookout 
unit/Hanging Wall unit contact, a readily identifiable marker that can be 
mapped across the length of the property. Rare bedding and stratigraphic 
topping indicators found within the Lookout unit are used to refine and support 
the structural model.  
 
Sulphide zones grade back and forth between massive sulphide, semi-massive 
sulphide, disseminated and replacement sulphide, and stringer sulphide, with 
different styles of mineralization commonly intermixed. Because of these 
factors, different styles of mineralization cannot bemodelled separately. Seven 
3D wireframes were built in Datamine for resource modelling; these include:  
 
Lookout Zone Sulphide wireframe: consists of eight separate solids for the 
three main sulphide horizons and minor local sub-horizons that in places 
coalesce and bifurcate. It includes separate wireframes for parts of the South 
Lookout sub-zone and the Main Lookout sub-zone. These wireframes are split 
along the fold hinges of parasitic S-folds and grouped into separate sub-
domains. Different search parameters are required for the steep north-
northwest dipping fold limbs versus the moderate south-southwest dipping fold 
limbs.

EB – MN – DG – JFC / ha Niblack Resource_TR_2CN1019.000_EG_MN_DG_JFC_ha_20081023.doc October 20, 2008 

Lookout Oxide Zone wireframe: includes a single contiguous wireframe that 
extends from surface to depth, where it is in contact with the Lookout Zone 
sulphide wireframe.  
 
Trio Zone Sulphide wireframes: consists of five separate solids of vertically 
stacked sulphide horizons.  
 
Mafic Dikes wireframes: includes a series of parallel, moderately southwest 
dipping dykes. Only those dikes that are greater than ten feet (three metres) in 
width, and continuous over more than three or four sections are modelled. 
Numerous dikes that are too small (less than ten feet wide) and discontinuous 
to model separately are included within sulphide wireframes.  
 
Diabase Dikes wireframes: includes a steeply dipping, north-northwest 
trending diabase dike and subordinate splay that cuts through the Lookout 
Zone.  
 
Blue Belle Fault wireframe: a surface generally constructed from the lower 
contact of the Blue Belle fault zone.  
 
Topography wireframe: a surface constructed from twenty foot (six metre) 
contours. 
 
A set of parallel vertical cross-sections spaced fifty feet (fifteen metres) apart 
was created for both the Lookout and Trio Zones. The sections are oriented 
north, parallel to the dominant drill azimuth, but oblique to the plunge of 
sulphide bodies. On each section, boundaries for the sulphide mineralization 
were interpreted based on a combination of geology and nominal cut-off 
grades. Two-dimensional strings were constructed on each section and 
connected to generate the sulphide wireframes. Several months were then 
spent in Datamine refining the wireframes to honour interpreted geological 
controls and half-distances between holes. Sulphide solids extend up-dip and 
down-dip (within a north-south oriented plane) a maximum of 175 feet (fifty-
three metres) from drill hole intersections, and, in the absence of other data, 
extend a maximum of 100 feet (thirty metres) to the east and west. Within the 
Lookout Zone a southwest plunge was the dominant geological control on 
sulphide wireframe shape, Within the Trio Zone plunges to the south-southeast 
control sulphide wireframe shape. 
 
The boundaries of the sulphide zone were defined using geology, sulphide 
content and assay data, generally using a cut-off of one to two percent copper 
equivalent. The copper equivalent for this purpose was based on gross metal 
values using US$1.00 per pound of copper, US$0.51 per pound of zinc, 
US$375 per ounce of gold, and US$5.50 per ounce of silver. These prices were 
chosen in 2005/2006 when Niblack initially began constructing sulphide zone 
boundaries.

15.5 Compositing 
 
The majority of the assay samples were collected on regular five feet intervals 
(Figure 18). Accordingly, all capped assay samples were composited to five 
feet intervals, resulting in the creation of 1,621 composite.

Area. 
 

15.6 Composite Statistics 
 
Figure 19 shows the basic statistics for copper, zinc, gold and silver capped 
composite data in sulphide and oxide domains. Note that copper and zinc 
grades are much higher in the sulphide than in the oxide domains. Conversely, 
precious metals grades are higher in the Oxide domains.

15.7 Variography 
 
Experimental variograms and variogram models were generated for each metal 
in both oxide and sulphide domains. Bearing in mind frequent local changes in 
azimuth and dip directions of the modelled zones, omnidirectional variogram 
models were considered appropriate for this study. The nugget values (i.e., the 
sample variability at very close distance) were established from down hole 
variograms. The determined nugget values range from fifteen to twenty-five 
percent of the total sill (Table 12). Note that the sill represents the sample 
variability at a distance beyond which there is no correlation in grades. 
 
Variogram models used in the sulphide zones for copper and gold is presented 
in Figure 20. The variogram models used for grade estimation are summarized 
in Table 12.

15.8 Resource Estimation Methodology 
 
A block model was constructed to cover the entire extent of the Niblack 
mineralization. The basis geometrical parameters of the block model are 
summarized in Table 13. 
 

Table 13: Niblack Block Model Extents 

Description  East (X)* North (Y)* Elevation (Z)
Block Origin (ft) 3,950.5 79,430 -805
Parent Block Dimension (ft) 15 6 6
Number of blocks 224 395 525
Minimum Sub Block Dimension (ft) 1.87 0.75 0.006
Rotation 0 0 0
* East and North Datamine coordinates truncated (X=x-1,000,000-x and Y=y-1,100,000) 
 
A Datamine sub-block routine (within the parent block size set at fifteen by six 
by six feet) was applied to fill the domain wireframes. Each sub-block was 
estimated individually.  
 
The resource estimation was carried out in three successive steps (Table 14). 
The first step considered a relatively small search ellipsoid while in the next 
two steps the search radii were increased, with different minimum number of 
samples used to estimate a block. In the third step the minimum number of 
samples was reduced. 
 
For estimation in the sulphide zones three different orientation domains were 
defined, based on general attitude of the modelled sub-domains. Within each 
orientation domain different rotations of the search ellipsoids were applied.  
 
The selection of the search radii was guided by modelled ranges from 
variography and was established to estimate a large portion of the blocks 
within the modelled area with limited extrapolation. The parameters were 
established by conducting repeated test resource estimates and reviewing the 
results as a series of plan views and sections.

Specific gravity varies considerably across the modelled sulphide and oxide 
zones (Figure 15). For this reason, specific gravity was estimated into each 
block rather than assigning an average specific gravity to each sulphide and 
oxide domain. 
 
Specific gravity was estimated using an inverse distance squared estimator 
with a search neighbourhood and parameters identical to those used for metal 
estimates. 
 
Unestimated blocks were assigned average specific gravity of 2.66 and 3.1 for 
the oxide and sulphide domains, respectively. 
 

15.9 Mineral Resource Classification 
 
The Niblack mineral resources were classified according to the CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) by 
Abolfazl Ghayemghamian, P. Geo, an appropriate independent qualified 
person for the purpose of National Instrument 43-101. 
 
Block classification was applied to the model using a combination of the 
average distance to composites and number of drill holes contributing to the 
local estimate. To some extent, the classification represents the results of 
visual assessments on section and plan views.  
 
The resource blocks informed by two or more holes contributing at least six 
composites to the estimate and located at an average distance of less than 
seventy-five feet from the informing composites were assigned an Indicated 
Mineral Resource classification. All other resource blocks were assigned an 
Inferred Mineral Resource classification. An Indicated resource envelope was 
then modelled around the Indicated resource blocks to delineate more regular 
areas with the same classification category. With this approach some Inferred 
category blocks were included into the Indicated category and vice versa. SRK 
considers this a good practice to outline regular areas with the same resource 
category. The resulting resource classification was subsequently inspected 
visually on sections and in plan view.

15.10 Validation of the Block Model 
 
The resource block model was validated by completing a series of visual 
inspections and by:  
 

• Comparison of local "well-informed" block grades with composites 
contained within those blocks; and 

• Comparison of average assay grades with average block estimates 
along different directions – swath plots. 

 
Figure 21 shows a comparison of estimated copper and gold block grades on 
blocks (fifteen by six by six feet in size) with borehole assay grades from the 
composites contained within those blocks in the sulphide domain. On average, 
the estimated blocks are similar to the assay data, although there is a large 
scatter of points around the x = y line. This scatter is to some extent a 
reflection of relatively short ranges modelled for the grade continuity. Other 
metals exhibit similar behaviour. 
 
A second validation was conducted to compare the average borehole assay 
grades with average block estimates along different directions across the block 
model. De-clustered average assay grades were calculated and then compared 
with the average block estimates along east-west, north-south, and horizontal 
swaths. An example of the swath plots for copper assays and block estimates 
in the sulphide domain is presented in Figure 22. Other metals exhibit similar 
relationships. 
 
Vertical sections through the Niblack block models are presented in 
Appendix C.

15.11 Mineral Resource Statement 
 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(December 2005) defines a mineral resource as: 
 
"a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, 
or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious 
metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form 
and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects 
for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological 
characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge".  
 
The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally 
implies that the quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds 
and that the mineral resources are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade 
taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. SRK 
considers that the Niblack polymetallic sulphide mineralization is amenable for 
underground extraction.  
 
There are five metals of economic significance in the Niblack deposit. Four 
metals (copper, gold, silver and zinc) contribute significantly to the value of 
this mineralization. Lead is not considered to contribute to the value of the 
sulphide mineralization. Accordingly, the mineral resources are reported at a 
net smelter return ("NSR") per tonne cut-off grade considering the likely 
underground mining extraction scenario that would be used to mine this 
mineralization. A US$ NSR value was calculated for each block based on 
assumed offsite costs, metal recovery, and metal prices presented in Table 15. 
Offsite costs include transportation of concentrate, smelter treatment charges, 
and refining charges.

Gold $700  ounce 40% 89.50% 0 0 $0.75/oz
dmt: dry metric tonne      

 
Based on the assumptions above, an NSR formula was used to assign a US$ 
NSR value to each resource block as follows: 
 
NSR in US$ = US$37.93 x Cu% + US$8.80 x Zn% + US$10.11 x Au g/t + US$0.13 x Ag g/t  
 
The classified mineral resource estimates for the Niblack deposit are reported 
for a cut-off of $US50 NSR per tonne and are presented in Table 16. This cut-
off grade is considered by SRK appropriate for reporting mineral resources 
amenable for underground extraction.

16 Interpretation and Conclusion 
 
SRK reviewed and audited the exploration data available for the Niblack 
polymetallic project. This review suggests that the exploration data 
accumulated by Niblack is generally reliable for the purpose of resource 
estimation. 
 
SRK reviewed geological interpretation and sulphide and oxide wireframes 
provided by Niblack personnel. A total of fourteen separate wireframes were 
constructed in Datamine Studio. After review, SRK considers that the 
geological model provides a reasonable interpretation for the Lookout and Trio 
Zones at the current level of sampling and is therefore sufficiently reliable for 
resource estimation. 
 
Following geostatistical analysis and variography, SRK constructed a new 
mineral resource block model for the Niblack deposit constraining grade 
interpolation to within the two modelled mineralization domains. After 
validation and classification, SRK considers that the mineral resources for the 
Niblack project are appropriately reported at a NSR cut-off of US$50 per 
tonne considering the likely underground mining scenario that would be used 
to extract this mineralization.  
 
Mineral resources for the Niblack deposit have been estimated in conformity 
with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserves Best Practices" Guidelines. In the opinion of SRK, the block model 
resource estimate and resource classification reported herein are a reasonable 
representation of the zinc, gold and silver and copper mineral resources found 
in the Niblack deposit. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not 
have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part 
of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 
 
A number of factors may affect the quality and quantity of the current 
estimates, and thereby highlight opportunities for improvement: 
 

• Certain modelled folds in the deposit have been interpreted from 
limited drilling data.  The resource estimation strategy chosen and 
search neighbourhood selected for estimation did not allow estimating 
grades in some areas of the deposit; 

• The uncertainty on the geometry of the sulphide domain is especially 
acute at depth, where sparse data are available. The current resource 
model limits block estimates to areas located within 150 feet from the 
closest drill hole.  

 
In reviewing the mineral resource model SRK draws the following 
conclusions: 
 

• An NSR cut-off grade of US$50 per tonne is considered appropriate 
for reporting underground mineral resources for this project;

• Most of the high grade gold and silver resource blocks are located at 
higher elevations in the oxide zone;  

• Conversely, almost all high grade copper and zinc blocks are located 
in the sulphide zone;  

• Overall, the sulphide zone carries ninety-seven percent of the mineral 
resources;  

• All highest grade blocks with estimated US$NSR larger than US$200 
per tonne are located in the sulphide zone between -100 to 1,570 foot 
elevations; and 

• A drilling spacing at fifty to sixty feet should be sufficient to allow 
converting Inferred Mineral Resource into an Indicated category.

17 Recommendations 
 
The current geological model is in part based on the interpretation from widely 
spaced drilling information. In those locations modelling fold geometries can 
be speculative and highly uncertain. Therefore, overall volume and continuity 
of the modelled zones remain also uncertain in those areas. 
 
SRK recommends that additional drilling be undertaken in the Lookout and the 
Trio Zones. The focus should be in the highly folded areas to get a better 
understanding of the geometry of the deposit.  
 
Considering the folded geometry, the stacked nature of the sulphide bodies, 
and the rugged topography, underground exploration offers the most efficient 
means to explore for the depth and lateral extensions of the sulphide zones. 
Knowledge gained from drifting along the sulphide zones, coupled with 
closely spaced drilling from underground stations will result in a much better 
definition of the envelope of the sulphide bodies and improve the confidence 
in the mineral resource estimates.  
 
Based on statistical continuity observed with the existing datasets for copper 
and zinc, SRK is of the opinion that drilling at fifty to sixty feet spacing should 
allow for converting Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated category. 
Measured Mineral Resource will require demonstration of physical continuity 
by underground excavation and closely spaced underground drilling. 
Underground mapping and sampling would also allow confirming the 
interpreted geometry derived from the geological and structural model for this 
deposit and thereby improve the overall confidence in the mineral resource 
estimates. 
 
SRK offers the following suggestions to be considered in future revisions of 
the geological and mineral resource models: 
 

• The geological model should be based primarily on lithology, 
alteration and structural interpretation; 

• Structural geology investigations should be carried out to integrate the 
new drilling data and new underground information with existing 
surface mapping information. SRK strongly recommend that future 
drilling considers recovering oriented core to assist in unravelling the 
complex structural geometries at Niblack; 

• The existing topographic information should be improved with a more 
accurate digital terrain model; 

• All samples submitted for assaying should be tested for specific 
gravity to characterize further the variation of specific gravity not only 
in the sulphide mineralization but also in adjacent waste rock; and 

• Future resource model revisions should consider "unfolding" 
techniques.

Considering the results of the exploration work to date, SRK is of the opinion 
that continued exploration drilling is warranted and has the potential to 
increase the size of the mineral resource laterally and with depth. There is also 
potential to discover additional sulphide zones in other comparatively less 
explored areas of the Niblack property. Large tracts of the prospective Lookout 
unit stratigraphy remain untested and warrant further exploration.  
 
SRK considers that a 10,000 metre drilling program is warranted. This 
program comprises 5,000 metres of drilling from the current underground 
workings, and an additional 5,000 metres of drilling from the surface. The 
underground drilling should be directed at increasing confidence and 
understanding in the lowermost portions of the Lookout Zone Inferred Mineral 
Resources, and in testing its lateral and depth extensions.  At least half of the 
surface drilling should be directed at expanding the Trio Zone at depth, with 
remaining directed at other targets along the fertile Lookout rhyolite unit.  
 
SRK also recommends that Niblack continue to characterize the context of the 
Niblack sulphide deposit by undertaking engineering and metallurgical studies 
that may ultimately lead into the preparation of a Preliminary Economic 
Assessment for the Niblack project. In particular, SRK recommends 
undertaking geotechnical investigations for assessing the quality of the rock 
mass and assisting underground mine design at a conceptual level. 
 
The total costs for the recommended work program are estimated at 
approximately US$4.0 million (Table 18). At a unit price of approximately 
US$300 per metre of drilling (all inclusive) the recommended underground 
drilling program would cost approximately US$1,500,000. At a unit price of 
approximately US$350 per metre of drilling (all inclusive) the recommended 
surface drilling program would cost approximately US$1,750,000. The unit 
cost is based on Niblack cost estimates from recently completed drill programs 
at the Niblack project, and assumes the surface and underground drilling 
programs are not performed concurrently. Engineering studies are budgeted at 
US$100,000, and metallurgy work is budgeted at US$100,000; both include 
reporting costs.
