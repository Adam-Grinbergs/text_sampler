1. SUMMARY 
 
The Red Willow property is situated on the eastern edge of the Athabasca Basin in 
Northern Saskatchewan, Canada and consists of seventeen mineral claims having a 
total area of 41,119 hectares. The mineral claims are 100% owned by Purepoint 
Uranium Group Inc., a public Company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. 
 
The Athabasca Basin is host to the world's largest high-grade uranium deposits. The 
sedimentary basin is filled by relatively undeformed and flat-lying quartz sandstone of 
the late Proterozoic Athabasca Group. In the Red Willow property area, the Athabasca 
sandstone unconformably overlies crystalline basement rocks that are within the 
boundary area of the Mudjatic and Wollaston Domains. The Proterozoic Athabasca 
Group sandstone is found to cover the Archean and Aphebian basement rocks on the 
western side of the property at depths of 0 to 120 metres. The basement rock trends NE 
to SW and is composed of orthogneiss and paragneiss. Six major uranium deposits, 
JEB, Midwest, Roughrider, Cigar Lake, McArthur River and Millennium, are located 
along a NE to SW mine trend that extends through the Red Willow Project. 
 
Uranium exploration on the Red Willow project is targeting areas proximal to graphitic 
basement rocks, possible structures (especially where cross-cutting structures are 
indicated), extensive alteration envelopes within basement or sandstone rocks, low 
grades of uranium, complex mineralogy and geochemistry (U, Ni, As, Co, B, Cu, Mo, 
Pb, Zn and V), areas proximal to the Athabasca basement unconformity, and areas of 
highly fractured sandstone that may be associated with underlying uraniferous zones. 
 
Extensive airborne and ground geophysics has been conducted over the property 
starting in 2005. Geophysical surveys have included airborne magnetic and 
electromagnetic (VTEM) surveys, an airborne radiometric survey, ground gradient array 
IP, pole-dipole array IP, fixed-loop and moving-loop transient electromagnetics, and 
gravity. The detailed airborne VTEM survey provided magnetic results that are an 
excellent base on which to interpret structures while the EM results outlined over 70 
kilometers of conductors that in most instances represent favourable graphitic lithology. 
A total of twenty-one conductive zones have been identified as priority exploration 
targets of which only seven have been subject to first pass drilling. Ground geophysical 
surveys that are particularly useful for drill targeting include resistivity and gravity. The 
resistivity results appear to have mapped out barren zones of silicification and granitic 
rocks allowing for improved drill hole target selection while gravity results have outlined 
gravity low anomalies that are coincident with historic strong basement alteration. 
 
Drilling on the Red Willow property has discovered uranium mineralization associated 
with the Osprey conductor returning up to 0.20% eU3O8 over 5.8 metres from a shallow 
(70 metres depth) flat-lying tensional fracture. The Osprey conductor has been shown 
from drilling to be a vertical to sub-vertical, weak to moderately sheared, dark green to 
black chlorite altered pyritic graphitic pelitic gneiss bounded by strongly silicified, 
moderately hematized pelitic gneiss. Uranium occurs within flat tension fracture zones 



 

2 
 

and steep narrow gouges within, and running parallel to, the shear zone. Mineralization 
has been traced along a strike length of approximately 250 metres. 
 
The 6-kilometer long "S"-shaped Osprey conductor, host to significant uranium 
intercepts, has excellent exploration potential at depth below the known mineralized 
zone and towards the west. The main mineralized zone has only been drill tested at 
shallow depths (average hole length < 160 metres) and is open at depth for further 
stacked, parallel lenses of mineralization. Based on the resistivity results, favourable 
pelitic rocks are located west of the Osprey conductor that may also host mineralization 
within sub-vertical structures and as sub-horizontal stacked lenses. 
 
The fold hinge of the Osprey conductor is considered to require further drilling after a 
fence of three holes drilled in 2008 intersected a vertical, weakly radioactive fault zone 
(Hinge Fault) associated with strong chlorite and hematite alteration and sections of lost 
core. The fault zone returned 250 ppm eU over 1.6 metres between 74.7 and 76.3 
metres from hole RW-29 and 358 ppm U over 0.4 metres between 159.1 and 159.5 
metres from hole RW-41. Alteration of the basement rocks increases along the northern 
fold limb towards the fold nose where one of the three holes drilled, RW-28, 
encountered strong clay alteration. 
 
The Geneva area has a compelling target area based on recently completed ground 
geophysics and drilling. A Pole-dipole array IP survey by Purepoint in 2007 outlined low 
apparent resistivity "chimneys" (LARCs) in the sandstone that coincided with the 
termination of two VTEM conductors in the basement rocks. LARCs within the 
sandstone may represent "chimneys" of hydrothermal alteration associated with 
structures that control uranium mineralization at depth. The two LARCs were also seen 
to correspond with two subtle gravity depressions identified by a limited gravity survey in 
2007. A gravity survey by Rio Tinto in 2012 supported the presence of the two gravity 
anomalies and extended the gravity depressions to where Eldorado Resources Ltd 
intersected very strong basement alteration and 0.22% U3O8 over 1.0 metres within a 
graphitic fault zone (hole RAD-27). A 3-hole fence was drilled just north of RAD-27 and 
intersected uranium mineralization in hole 14RDW008 that was related to the graphitic 
shear returning 0.68% U3O8 over 0.3 metres between 89.1 to 89.4m. The Geneva 
conductor has been shown from drilling to be dark green to black chlorite altered pyritic 
graphitic pelitic gneiss that is approximately 5 metres thick, steeply dipping, and weak to 
moderately sheared.  
 
Immediately east of the Geneva area are VTEM conductors with a relatively short strike 
length that are considered to be priority exploration targets. The prospective target area 
containing the conductors is roughly outlined by three points: the 14RDW008 
mineralization,: to the northeast where high concentrations of radon (a product of the 
decay of uranium) were first detected in Radon Lake in 1971, and to the southeast 
where hole RAD08-09 returned 283 ppm U over 1.1 metres from sandstone just above 
the unconformity. The offset conductors are suggestive of structural complexity within 
the area and they appear to be bounded by bands of granitic rocks (magnetic highs). 
The highly competent granitic rocks would provide a contrast in competency favourable 



 

3 
 

for zones of dilatancy and mineral deposition. Additionally, the presence of swamp in 
the area may be due to slumping of the underlying sandstone following hydrothermal 
alteration.  

The Topping Island area was explored during the early 1980's after a pitchstone cobble 
was discovered down-ice of the arcuate shaped EM conductor. Purepoint flew a 
VTEMplus over Topping Island in two different directions using a close line spacing of 
125 metres to provide detail of the arcuate, 6-kilometer long, EM anomaly. The survey 
outlined numerous lateral displacements in the conductor that can be confidently 
interpreted as faults, representing high priority drill targets. The Topping Island 
conductor is the eastern terminus of the Crooked-Richardson Lakes conductive belt that 
is currently being explored by the Denison Mines/ Eros Resources Joint Venture that 
intersected mineralization in drill hole RL-13-16 returning 0.45% U3O8 over 2.3 metres. 

The 333 area has been prepared for initial drill testing by 3D resistivity and gradient 
array IP surveys. The 333 area is named after a historic overburden drill hole (hole 
#333) that intersected values up to 0.31% U3O8 in glacial till. Based on the recent 
geophysical results, the source of the anomalous till may be a recently outlined EM 
conductor that lies only 200 metres northeast of drill hole #333. The strong conductor 
trends north-south, is 1.1 kilometers in length and, based on the geophysical results, is 
intersected by a northeast trending fault.  
 
At Dancing Lake, favourable EM conductors have now been covered by a gradient 
array IP survey and pole-dipole array IP and are considered drill ready. Follow-up 
drilling is also warranted within the Long Lake area where hole LL08-05 intersected a 
1.6 metre wide radioactive structure within hematite altered pelitic gneiss returning 269 
ppm U over 0.5 metres. The area is host to the historic Long Lake Boulder Train 
discovered in 1975 by Gulf Minerals. The northeast trending boulder train was found to 
be 2 km long, 300 to 400 meters wide and contained a number of radioactive biotite 
schist boulders returning up to 0.80% U3O8. 
 
The Golden Eye Shear Zone is located in the northern portion of the claim group and 
joins two historic uranium occurrences, the FDL and AJ showings. At the FDL showing, 
uranium mineralization (1.43% U3O8.grab sample) is associated with the 1 metre wide, 
northeast trending Golden Eye shear zone that crosscuts an outcrop of graphitic biotite-
rich pelitic gneiss. The AJ showing is a radioactive molybdenite-garnet-biotite schist 
subcrop that returned an assay of 0.46% U3O8. Historic data indicates the Golden Eye 
Shear hosts favourable mineralization and is a priority target.  
 
Additional EM targets that are considered worthy of ground geophysics include the 
Ghost Lake and Horse Lake conductors. Follow-up work is also warranted at the Cross 
Lake, CBA and Mustang areas. Cross Lake is a structurally complex area located near 
the historic Scrimes Lake uranium showings that returned anomalous soil geochemistry 
during 1972 by Gulf Minerals. Within the CBA area, located at a the fold nose of a 
granitic dome, the last hole of a twenty hole program (CBA-20) intersected anomalous 
uranium, 0.17% U3O8 over 0.8m, within a pegmatite dyke before being lost at a depth of 



 

4 
 

20m. Initial drilling in the Mustang area returned 639 ppm U over 30 cm from a fracture, 
however, the mineralization was not intersected in the follow-up drill holes. 
 
Based on the uranium mineralization discovered to date on the Red Willow property and 
its favorable geologic setting, further exploration is warranted. A multi-staged 
exploration program and budget is recommended. 
 
 
Stage 1: Fall 2016 and Winter 2016/2017:  
 
Drill testing of the geophysical targets previously identified within the Osprey, Geneva, 
333 and Dancing Lake areas. Fourteen diamond drill holes for a total of 5,600 meters 
are recommended. 
 
Stage 2 is not contingent on positive results from Stage 1. 
 
Stage 2: Summer 2017 and Winter 2017 / 2018:  
 
Ground DC resistivity and gravity surveying should be conducted over the Osprey 
Hinge, Topping Island, Golden Eye, Ghost Lake and Horse Lake conductors. 
Linecutting will be required at all target areas with the exception of the Horse Lake grid 
where the existing grid will need refurbishing.  
 
Follow-up of favourable Stage 1 drill program results and drill testing of the high priority 
geophysical targets. A sixteen hole, 6,400 meter drill program is recommended.

4. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Red Willow property is accessible by vehicles as well as float or ski equipped 
aircraft. The property is 730 km northeast of Saskatoon and 35 km northeast of Points 
North Landing. Transwest Air and Pronto Airways provides scheduled aircraft service 
from Saskatoon to Points North Landing year round. All weather highways 102 and 905 
reach Points North Landing from La Ronge. The Lasby Lake camp is accessible by 
driving the Hatchet Lake trail that heads north-northeast from the McClean Lake 
Minesite

The climate is typical of northern Saskatchewan, being cold in the winter, (-20 to -40 
degrees Celsius) and hot in the summer (15 to 35 degrees Celsius). Precipitation is 
moderate. Freeze up begins in late October and break up occurs in late May. During the 
period of freeze up, from December to April, accessibility in the area is enhanced by 
frozen muskegs and lakes. 
 
Three temporary work camps were constructed during 2006, 2007 and 2013. The Lasby 
Lake camp is located 100 metres from the north shore of Lasby Lake and is directly 
accessed by the Hatchet Lake seasonal road. The Cunning Bay camp and East Lasby 
camp were both decommissioned in 2014. 
 
The property has varied topography due to Quaternary landforms that include drumlins, 
eskers, ground moraine and hummocky moraine. Outcrop exposure is sparse due to a 
blanket of glacial till. The forest cover is comprised of mainly jack pine and spruce. The 
elevation of Hatchet Lake is 395 metres above sea level (masl) while Cunning Bay is at 
425 masl. 
 
 
5. HISTORY 
 
Gulf Minerals Canada Ltd. (Gulf) was one of the first uranium explorers in the area 
conducting an airborne radiometric survey in 1968 followed up by a reconnaissance 
geochemical soil survey, radon-in-water survey and prospecting during 1971 and 1972. 
High concentrations of radon were found in the surface water just west of a waterbody 
that Gulf named "Radon Lake" (Figure 3). The geochemical soil anomalies (Figure 4) 
and radon-in-water anomalies were followed up with ground geophysics that included 
electromagnetics (EM), magnetics and radiometrics.  
 
In 1974 Gulf conducted geological mapping and conducted a four hole diamond drill 
program (GL-1 to GL-4) on the Ghost Lake grid to test two linear electromagnetic (EM) 
conductors. The north part of the Ghost West conductor was found to be caused by a 
pyritic and graphitic paragneiss, while the south part of this conductor appears to be 
related to a fault/fracture zone. The only significant assay from the drilling was a 116 
ppm U value returned from a clay layer just below the Athabasca Group unconformity in 
hole GW-85-02. 
 
In 1975, Gulf carried out an airborne magnetic, EM and gamma ray spectrometer 
survey that was followed by a regional, reverse circulation (RC) overburden drilling 
program. Over 350 overburden holes were drilled with the most anomalous hole being 
located on the Red Willow property, with hole #333 returning an assay of 0.31% U3O8. 
Since the radioactive zone was quite thick and not found in the neighbouring holes, the 
source was implied to be relatively local. Gulf had recommended that additional RC 
drilling be conducted to trace the uranium-rich overburden to its source but follow-up 
work was not done.

In 1985, the Dancing Lake grid was surveyed with ground geophysical surveys including 
magnetic, VLF-EM and HLEM. The short strike-length, shallow conductors were 
considered to not have bedrock sources and not tested by drilling. 
 
Prospecting by Gulf in 1975 discovered the Long Lake boulder field near Cunning Bay 
that was comprised of radioactive biotite schist boulders (Figure 5). The Fond du Lac 
and Osprey grids were established and utilized for ground geophysics that included 
VLF, Horizontal Loop and Vertical Loop EM surveys. The geophysics defined targets for 
5 diamond drill holes, OS-1 and OS-3 to OS-6, that were completed in 1977.  
 
In 1978, Gulf conducted additional VLF and Horizontal Loop EM surveys on the Osprey 
grid along with follow up diamond drilling, holes OS-7 to OS-24, in 1979. The 
conductors tested were explained by either a retrograded altered paragneiss (OS-7, 8, 
13 to 19, 23 and 24), an east dipping clay-filled shear zone (OS-9, 10, 20 to 22), or a 
graphitic pyritic paragneiss (OS-11 and 12).  
 
Gulf drilled on the Radon grid in 1979 testing a resistivity low and a VLF-EM conductor 
that was best explained by the hematite alteration of basement rock just below the 
unconformity. Drill holes RAD-1 and RAD-2 intersected an aquifer at the base of the 
sandstone that contains anomalous radon values up to 521 cpm. In 1980, holes RAD-7 
to 9 tested an EM conductor and intersected a highly altered zone at the Athabasca 
Group unconformity, while RAD-12 failed to explain its targeted conductor. A third 
conductor was tested by holes RAD-10 to 13 and they intersected graphitic quartz-
feldspar gneiss with an assay highlight of 0.01% U3O8 over 1.0 meter.  
 
In 1977, Canadian Superior Explorations conducted reconnaissance, ground VLF and 
electromagnetic surveys, geological mapping, lake water and lake-bottom sediment 
sampling. The following year included an airborne radiometric, magnetic and 
electromagnetic survey, geological mapping, prospecting, trenching and boulder 
sampling on previously uncovered ground and radon gas-in-soil and soil sampling on 
selected areas from earlier work. Ground proofing airborne radiometric anomalies led to 
the discovery of a radioactive boulder occurrence consisting of approximately 125 
radioactive boulders and one radioactive outcrop (FDL showing) within an area of 1.5 
kilometres by 240 metres. The FDL showing is located approximately 1 kilometre to the 
southwest (down-ice direction) of the Red Willow disposition S-112021 (Figure 6), is 
associated with sheared and fractured biotite quartzite, pegmatite and graphitic 
gneisses, and returned an assay highlight of 1.43% U3O8. The nearby AJ showing, also 
discovered by Canadian Superior, is located on the Red Willow disposition S-112012 
and has an assay highlight of 0.46% U3O8. 
 
In 1980, Getty Minerals Ltd. discovered a pitchstone cobble (>99,999 cpm) down-ice of 
an EM conductor on Topping Island that lies within the current disposition S-112026 
(Figure 6). Four drill holes in 1981 tested the 6-kilometre long conductor, which was 
explained by pyritic / graphitic pelitic rocks, but the source of the pitchstone cobble was 
not identified. No drilling has been conducted on the island since the initial Getty

Minerals drill program. Overburden is shallow on the island at 0 to 20 metres in 
thickness. 
 
In 1980, CanLake Explorations Ltd. drilled 14 holes (CBA-03 to 10 and CBA-15 to 20), 
Favourable mineralization was intersected in the last two holes of the program. Hole 
CBA-19 intersected 0.03% U3O8 over 0.5 metres between 36.3 and 36.8 metre depth 
within pegmatitic rock. CBA-20 intersected 0.17% U3O8 over 0.8 metres within a 
pegmatite dyke before being lost at a depth of 20m. 
 
In 1982, Saskatchewan Mining and Development Corp. (SMDC) conducted prospecting, 
mapping and scintillometer surveys. Several radioactive basement boulders with values 
up to 0.35% U3O8 were found along a pegmatite/calc-silicate contact. Banded calc-
silicates with trace to 1% disseminated graphite were also found along the north shore 
of Scrimes Lake.  
 
By 1984, Eldorado Resources had extended the northeast trending Long Lake Boulder 
Train to an area two km long and 300 to 400 meters wide (Figure 5). A number of 
radioactive biotite schist boulders were discovered with an assay highlight of 0.80% 
U3O8 while pegmatite boulders returned an assay highlight of 0.55% U3O8. 
 
Drilling by Eldorado Resources Ltd in 1984 intersected very strong basement alteration 
and anomalous radioactivity in the Geneva Zone with RAD-27, returning 0.22% U3O8 
over 1.0 metres within a graphitic fault zone. Cameco later ranked drill holes on their 
Rabbit Lake project for basement alteration and one of Eldorado's holes from the 
Geneva Zone, RAD-17, returned the highest alteration score of the 366 drill holes 
ranked. Cameco's rating for basement rock alteration used the concentrations of 
pathfinding elements (Pb, Ni, Cu, U, total clay and chlorite). Although Eldorado 
completed a total of 32 drill holes (RAD-01 to 32) within the Radon Lake area, most 
were stopped at less than 100 metres into basement rock.  
 
In 1985, Eldorado followed up HLEM and VLF-EM surveys over Lasby Lake with two 
diamond holes (RAD85-33 and RAD85-34. The conductor on the extended Radon grid 
was determined to be a faulted graphitic and pyritic paragneiss with no significant 
radioactivity. Four drill holes (GW85-1 to GW85-4) also tested HLEM targets on the 
Ghost West grid.  
 
In 1993, Cameco Corp. tested the central Osprey grid conductor (TURK-5 and 7) and 
intersected anomalous radioactivity ranging from 450 cps to 1660 cps. The radioactivity 
was intersected at less than 90 metres depth within one of two vertically dipping, faulted 
graphitic, pyritic pelitic gneiss units. Cameco's geophysical survey results suggested the 
conductors terminated a short distance (200 m) south of their drill holes and did not 
conduct follow-up drilling.  
 
In 2005 United Carina carried out a program on the northwest Red Willow claims (S-
111155 and S-112026) that included boulder sampling, prospecting, examination of old 
core, line cutting (41.3 km) and 36.7 km of Horizontal Loop EM surveys. The ground 



 

16 
 

geophysics was conducted on the "G" Grid over known airborne conductors located up-
ice from anomalous boulder geochemistry. In 2006, United Carina tested some of the 
drill targets including UCA-1 that intersected Athabasca sandstone underlain by faulted 
basement rocks but did not encounter anomalous radioactivity. 
 
During 2006 to 2008, ESO Uranium Corporation worked the area that is now the 
northwest Red Willow claim S-112036. ESO performed geophysical airborne MegaTEM 
electromagnetic and magnetic surveying, airborne gamma spectrometric and magnetic 
surveying, geochemical sandstone boulder surveying, and regional geochemical soil 
surveying and radon in soil gas surveying. 
 
During 2007 and 2008, Hathor Exploration Limited conducted a lake bottom sediment 
survey and an airborne electromagnetic survey (VTEM) over their Hatchet Lake 
property that included the current Red Willow North claim S-112021. 
 
During 2009, the Geological Survey of Canada flew a radiometric/magnetic survey over 
the northern portion of the Red Willow project (Figure 7). The objective of the airborne 
survey was to provide detailed geophysical coverage of the entire Athabasca Basin in 
support of geological mapping and to increase geo-scientific knowledge of the region. 
 
 
6. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

 
 

6.1 Geological Setting 
 
The Red Willow Property lies on the eastern margin of the Athabasca Basin, 
Saskatchewan. The Athabasca Basin is filled by the Athabasca Group of relatively 
undeformed and flat-lying, mainly fluviatile clastic strata. The Athabasca Group 
unconformably overlies crystalline basement rocks of the Rae Province in the northwest 
and the Hearne Province to the east (Hoffman, 1990; Figure 8). Diabase dykes from a 
few to a hundred meters in width have intruded into both the Athabasca rocks and the 
underlying basement. Extensive areas are covered by Quaternary glacial drift and 
outwash, forming an undulating, lake-covered plain. 
 
The oldest rocks underlying the Red Willow Property are situated in the Archean 
Hearne Province at the boundary between the northern Mudjatik and Wollaston 
Domains (Figure 8). The Hearne province is bounded along its southeast margin by the 
Trans Hudson Orogen and to the northwest by the Snowbird Tectonic Zone (Hoffman, 
1988), which subdivides the Churchill Structural Province into the Rae and Hearne 
provinces. The northern Mudjatic Domain is bounded to the northeast by the Tantato 
and Dodge domains of the Rae Province and to the southeast by the Wollaston Domain 
of the Hearne Province (Hoffman, 1990). The Wollaston Domain is bounded to the 
southeast by the Peter Lake Domain of the Hearne Province and the Wathaman 
Batholith of the Trans Hudson Orogen (Hoffman, 1990).

19 
 

 
North and east of the property, at the edge of the Basin, the exposed basement 
consist of the Mudjatic Domain which is comprised of intensely deformed and 
metamorphosed Archean granitic gneisses and numerous small remnants of 
Aphebian metasedimentary rocks and pelitic gneisses (Gilboy, 1983) (Figure 9). 
To the east, metasedimentary rocks of the Wollaston Group rest unconformably on 
Archean granitoid gneisses (Lewry and Sibbald, 1980; Lewry et al., 1985; Lewry 
and Collerson, 1990). The Wollaston Group consists of shelf to miogeosynclinal 
sediments that were deformed and metamorphosed (together with the adjacent 
gneisses) during the Hudsonian Orogony. The basal units consist mostly of pelitic 
and semi-pelitic gneisses with graphitic pelitic gneiss and subordinate quartzite 
and ironstone. These pass upward into calc-silicate gneisses and psammopelitic 
and psammitic gneisses (Eriks and Chiron, 1994). 
 
Following the Trans-Hudson orogeny (ca. 1860-1770 Ma, Saskatchewan 
Geological Survey, 2003), the Archean basement and Paleoproterozoic 
metasedimentary rocks were uplifted and subjected to erosion (Ramaekers, 1990, 
2003a, b) leaving a weathered profile or regolith with a 1.75 to 1.78 Ga retrograde 
metamorphic age (Annesley et al., 1997). The regolith consists of a few meters of 
a hematized red zone, grading into a buff, white to light green weathered 
basement which grades downwards over a few meters into unweathered 
basement (Ramaekers, 1990).  
 
The fluviatile sands and gravels of the Athabasca Group were deposited in the 
intracratonic Athabasca Basin that formed through extensional tectonics 
(Ramaekers and Hartling, 1979). A maximum age constraint for the Athabasca 
Group is approximately 1.66 Ga provided by a detrital ziron suite collected from the 
Wolverine Point Formation (Rainbird et al., 2002). The thickness of the Athabasca 
Group sediments was originally up to 5 km (Pagel et al., 1980), but presently it is 
estimated to be a maximum of 2200 m (Sibbald and Quirt, 1987). 
 
The Athabasca Basin was divided into three northeast trending sub-basins 
separated by northeast trending highs, shown by stratigraphic (Ramaekers, 1979, 
1980) and seismic work (Hobson and MacAuley, 1969). The three northeasterly 
trending fault bound sub-basins coalesced to form the Athabasca Basin with seven 
deposystems recognized (Ramaekers, 1976, 1978a, 1978b; Ramaekers et al., 
2001; Yeo et al., 2002).  
 
The Athabasca Group was divided into two subgroups: the William River Subgroup 
and the overlying Points Lake Subgroup (Ramaekers, 1980, 1990). The William 
River Subgroup now comprises the Fair Point, Manitou Falls, Lazenby Lake, 
Wolverine Point, Locker Lake and Otherside Formations (Ramaekers et al., 2001). 
The Points Lake Subgroup consists of the Douglas and Carswell formations that 
are present only in the Carswell structure. Most formations can be further 
subdivided into members (e.g. Yeo et al., 2002).

The Manitou Falls Formation is the only formation of the Athabasca Group that occurs 
underlying the Red Willow Property and is composed of the lower member Manitou 
Falls b (MFb) and upper member Manitou Falls c (MFc) (Slimmon, 2004). The MFb is 
characterized as a poorly sorted, medium- to coarse-grained, pebbly sandstone with 
conglomerate beds over 2 cm thick (Ramaekers et al., 2001), deposited in an alluvial 
braid-plain characterized by broad channels in a relatively humid climate (Long et al., 
2000; Jefferson et al., 2001). The overlying MFc is characterized as a moderately 
sorted, medium- to coarse-grained, granule rich, ripple-cross-laminated sandstone with 
1% intraclasts-rich layers and one-grain-thick pebble or granule layers at the base 
(Ramaekers et al., 2001), deposited in a distal alluvial braid-plain lacking well-
developed channels, in a humid climate (Yeo et al., 2000; Jefferson et al., 2001).  

 
 

6.2 Property Mineralization 
 
The strongest uranium mineralization encountered within the Osprey area was hole 
RW-07 returned 0.20% eU3O8 over 6 metres (from 71.6 and 77.6 m) from a fracture 
zone having a distinct geochemical signature that includes anomalous partial digestion 
results for As (94.1 ppm), Cu (7,660 ppm), Pb (2,280 ppm), and Zn (33,000 ppm). A 
follow-up drill hole along the Osprey conductor (RW-19), collared 80 metres north of 
hole RW-07, intercepted 0.58% U3O8 over 1.0 metre (from 93.3 to 94.3 m) within 
graphitic pelite and included a 10 cm interval assaying 3.03% U3O8.  
 
Drilling results have shown the Osprey conductor to be a vertical to sub-vertical, weak 
to moderately sheared, dark green to black chlorite altered pyritic graphitic pelitic gneiss 
bounded by strongly silicified, moderately hematized pelitic gneiss. The pyritic/graphitic 
unit is typically 40 to 60 metres wide, hosts 5 to 8% pyrite as fine disseminations, 
medium to coarse subhedral crystals and rare semi-massive bands and trace to 1% fine 
graphite needles. Uranium mineralization discovered to date in the Osprey zone is 
confined to flat tension fracture zones and steep narrow gouges within, and running 
parallel to, the shear zone. 
 
A weakly radioactive fault zone (Hinge Fault) associated with strong chlorite and 
hematite alteration was intersected by a fence of three holes designed to test a fold 
nose of the Osprey conductor. RW-29 intersected the vertical radioactive fault zone 
between 72.5 and 77.5 metres returning 288 ppm U over 1.6 metres while RW-41 
intersected the fault between 157.7 and 161.0 metres that returned 358 ppm U over 0.4 
metres. All three holes encountered zones of strong clay alteration and silicification.  
 
Drilling discovered uranium mineralization associated with the Geneva conductor with 
hole 14RDW008 returning 0.68% U3O8 over 0.3m from 89.1 to 89.4 metres. The 
radioactivity and associated graphitic shear can be followed down dip into hole 
14RDW009 where assays returned 322 ppm U over 1.0 metre (from 193 to 194m).

7. DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
The Athabasca Basin hosts some of the world's largest and richest known uranium 
deposits. The Cigar lake deposits grade ~15% uranium while McArthur River grades 
~22% uranium and the average grade of 30 deposits for 30 unconformity-associated 
deposits in the Athabasca Basin is ~2% uranium, approximately four times the average 
grade of Australian unconformity-associated deposits (Jefferson et al., 2007). The 
deposits are located at the sub-Athabasca unconformity, and are hosted in both the 
Athabasca Group sandstones above the unconformity, and in the Paleoproterozoic 
metamorphed supracrustal rocks and intrusives of the Archean Hearne Craton 
basement. Most of the known important deposits occur within a few tens to a few 
hundred metres of the unconformity and within 500 m of the present-surface, thus 
making them accessible and attractive exploration targets. 
 
The initial discoveries were found through surficial indicators, such as radioactive 
boulders, strong geochemical anomalies in the surrounding lakes and swamps, and 
geophysical signatures (Wheatley et al., 1996). After these initial discoveries, an 
exploration model was developed that targeted electromagnetic conductors based on 
the associated underlying graphitic schists with strong electromagnetic signatures 
(Kirchner and Tan, 1977; Matthews et. al., 1997).  
 
The uraniferous zones are structurally controlled both with relation to the sub-Athabasca 
unconformity, and the basement fault and fracture-zones. They are commonly localized 
above and along or in graphitic pelitic gneiss that generally flank structurally competent 
Archean granitoid domes (Quirt, 1989). Although electromagnetic conductors are typical 
exploration targets, the Kiggavik deposit in the Thelon Basin, Nunavut (Fuchs and 
Hilger, 1989) is an example of a significant uranium deposit forming without graphitic 
units. Uranium deposits within the Athabasca Basin that are associated with little or no 
graphite include Rabbit Lake, Eagle Point, Raven, Horseshoe, Cluff Lake, and 
Centennial (Rhys et al., 2010; Yeo and Potter, 2010).  
 
Uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin that occur in proximity to the Athabasca 
unconformity can be characterized as polymetallic (U-Ni-Co-Cu, Pb, Zn and Mo) or 
monometallic (Ruzicka, 1997, Thomas et al., 2000, Jefferson et al., 2007). Examples of 
polymetallic deposits include the Key Lake, Cigar Lake, Collins Bay 'A', Collins Bay 'B', 
McClean, Midwest, Sue and Cluff Lake 'D' deposits. Polymetallic deposits have high-
grade ore at or just below the unconformity, and a lower grade envelope that extends 
into the sandstone or downwards into the basement. The lower grade envelope exhibits 
a distinct zonation marked by predominance of base metal sulphides (Ruzicka, 1997). 
 
Monometallic deposits are completely or partially basement hosted deposits localized 
in, or adjacent to, faults in graphitic gneiss and calc-silicate units. Monometallic deposits 
contain traces of metals besides uranium and include completely basement-hosted 
deposits developed for up to 500 m below the unconformity (e.g. Eagle Point deposit, 
Thomas et al., (2000)), or deposits that may extend from the unconformity downward 



 

23 
 

along faults in, or adjacent to, graphitic gneiss and/or calc-silicate units such as the 
McArthur River deposit (Thomas et al., 2000; Jefferson et al., 2007). 
 
Based on the general geological model for unconformity-type uranium deposits, the 
exploration for uranium on the Red Willow property will target: 

1. Areas proximal to graphitic basement rocks; 
2. Possible structures, especially where cross-cutting structures are indicated;  
3. Extensive alteration envelopes within basement or sandstone rocks,
4. Low grades of uranium;  
5. Complex mineralogy and geochemistry (U, Ni, As, Co, B, Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn and 

V);  
6. Areas proximal to the Athabasca basement unconformity, either above or below 

it; and  
7. Zones of highly fractured sandstone that may be coincident with and overlying 

uraniferous zones. 
 
 

8. EXPLORATION PROGRAMS 
 
From 2005 to 2014, exploration at the Red Willow property has consisted of airborne 
magnetic and electromagnetic surveys (VTEM), an airborne radiometric survey, line 
cutting, boulder prospecting, geochemical surveys, ground 3D resistivity, gradient array 
induced polarization (IP), pole-dipole IP, fixed-loop transient EM, gravity and diamond 
drilling.  
 
Purepoint Uranium Group Inc. entered into an agreement with Rio Tinto in 2011 
allowing an earn-in of 51% of the Red Willow Project by spending $5 million on 
exploration by December 31, 2015. Rio Tinto became the project operator in 2011 but 
ceased exploration work in 2014 before reaching their initial earn-in expenditure 
requirement. 
 
 
8.1 Airborne Magnetic and Electromagnetic Surveys 
 
During November 2006 and June 2007, Geotech Ltd. carried out a helicopter-borne, 
magnetic and versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) survey. The 3,316 line-
kilometre survey covered the Red Willow claims held by Purepoint at that time (Figure 
10). The flight line direction was northwest over all of the block and northeast over the 
southwest half. Flight line separation was 200 metres in the northeast half and 100 
metres over the rest. 
 
During May 2012, a helicopter-borne electromagnetic (EM) and magnetic (VTEMplus) 
survey was completed over the Topping Island area within the northwest portion of Red 
Willow (Figure 11). The 245 line-kilometer VTEMplus survey was conducted with a close 
line spacing of 125 metres and flown in two different directions to provide detail of the 
arcuate, 6-kilometer long, EM anomaly within the Topping Island target area.

8.1.1 Quality Control 
 
Quality control of airborne magnetic and electromagnetic surveys include in-field data 
processing involved and compilation of data collected during the acquisition stage, 
using the in-field processing centre established at Points North, northern 
Saskatchewan. Preliminary and final data processing, including generation of final 
digital data products were done at the office of Geotech Ltd. in Aurora, Ontario. 
 
 
8.1.2 Methodology of Interpreting VTEM Results  
 
The VTEM instrument is a pulse type or time domain transmitter with horizontal 
concentric receiver/transmitter coil configuration. The anomaly that the instrument 
provides is different for each type of conductor shape. Purepoint has defined four types 
of EM anomalies that include: 
 
Type 1 - the response from a thin plate and will show two peaks on either side of the 
center of the plate. "Thin" means less than about 30 metres. A dipping plate will change 
the symmetry of the anomaly. The ratio of the amplitudes of the two peaks is used to 
calculate the dip; 
 
Type 2 - a "wide" plate response that could represent a number of closely spaced bands 
of graphitic sediments or alternatively a broad deep area of very conductive overburden; 
 
Type 3 – that typically represents conductive overburden; and 
 
Type 4 - characterized by a positive single anomaly on the very early channels but 
which switch to negative readings in later channels. The type 4 anomaly has not been 
modeled adequately yet and the negative readings are believed to be an induced 
polarization effect. The current practice is to interpret these anomalies as a body of 
disseminated conductive particles. 
 
8.1.3 Interpretation of VTEM Results  
 
The various conductive areas that were identified have been named (Figure 10) and 
individually reviewed, interpreted and described by Purepoint's Chief Geophysicist, 
Roger K. Watson, B.A.Sc., P.Eng. as follows: 
 
 
Geneva Basin 
 
The term Geneva Basin refers to two concentric U-shaped anomaly clusters lying in the 
western part of the block and beneath the Athabasca sandstone. The outer ring 
includes the Radon Lake and Lasby Lake anomalies. The inner ring is seen on both the 
NE and NW sets of flight lines and in fact would probably not have been recognized as 
a single ring had the two sets of lines not been flown. All of the profiles indicate a plate 



 

 27 

source dipping at a shallow angle (30 to 45 degrees) inward to suggest a basin 
structure. All are of medium to high conductance, ranging from 15 to 23 channel 
anomalies.  
 
The outer ring consists of the Lasby Lake and the Radon Lake anomalies, joined by a 
line that is seen in the pattern of the channel 13 field and which continues their arcuate 
shape. This outer ring also dips inward to but at a steeper angle, estimated from the 
VTEM profiles at 80 to 88 degrees, thus supporting the interpretation of a basin 
structure. The conductance at the Lasby Lake and Radon Lake is medium to high with a 
range of 13 to 25 channel anomalies. The Radon Lake anomaly extends southwest to 
the edge of the survey area in more or less a straight line and with lower conductance.  
 
Both conductor axes conform to basement geology as shown in the pattern of the 
magnetic maps. None, except for a short part of the Radon Lake anomaly, have a direct 
magnetic expression. The magnetic anomaly referred to above also coincides directly 
with a topographic high ridge that is likely a glacial remnant and is the cause of the 
magnetic anomaly.  
 
 
Radon Lake  
 
The Radon Lake conductor forms part of the outer ring of the Geneva Basin, is 
uniformly strong (24 channels) and traverses eleven or so flight lines. It dips very slightly 
to the northwest (88 degrees) and lies in an area of radon gas anomalies found by 
earlier investigators. 
 
Some inversion modeling was done on Lines 3110 and 3130 and produced conductive 
plates dipping as expected, steeply to the west. But they forecast depths of 250 to 300 
metres which is believed to be erroneous. These are more likely to be at basement 
surface which is found at 10 to 26 metres from earlier drilling. 
 
 
Lasby Lake  
 
The VTEM anomaly over Lasby Lake is of high quality, similar to that on Radon Lake. 
Drilling on this conductor has shown it to be a thick package of graphitic-pyritic pelitic 
gneiss. 
 
 
Osprey 
  
The Osprey conductor is a strong type 1 anomaly seen on both the NW and NE 
trending survey lines. It forms an "S" shape and is shows a high conductance of 20 
channel response or more on nearly all profiles. There is a general steep dip to the west 
of 85 to 75 degrees. It matches the bedrock structure as shown by the magnetic pattern, 



 

 28 

although it does not have a direct magnetic anomaly itself. Maxwell inversions on the 
data from two flight lines indicate a shallow plate dipping steeply to the SW  
 
 
Dancing Lake  
 
The Dancing Lake area consists of a complex of three moderately to good conductive 
type 1 anomalies. It is in fact very complex, with the three main anomalies folded 
considerably and connected to each other. The principal anomaly is a 15 channel 
response, has a north-south trend and is dipping to the east at 70 degrees. A short 
three line cluster of 25 channel anomalies lies to the east of this and has a very steep 
dip, +/- 2 degrees to vertical. A third conductor axis of 22 channel anomalies may 
intersect this one to form tight fold. 
 
Two of the three axes have a coincident magnetic anomaly. The north-south principal 
conductor axis lies on a longer narrow magnetic anomaly that resembles a thin dyke. 
The impression is that of a suite of a number of parallel, heavily folded conductive 
bands. The presence of the magnetic signature suggests sulphides while the multiple 
parallel conductors suggest graphite. It is difficult to measure the dip of a number of 
closely spaced anomalies and they should probably be treated as very steeply dipping. 
 
333 Area  
 
The 333 conductor is a short but well-formed type 1 conductor, striking north-south and 
well defined on both the NW and NE aligned flight lines. But there is uncertainty in 
regard to the dip between the two sets of flight line data, one the NE lines showing a 
west dip and the other an east dip direction. 
 
The anomaly conforms somewhat to the bedrock structure as shown by the magnetic 
field map. It would appear to be a short but massive bed plane of graphitic sediments. 
 
 
Topping Island 
 
The curved, horseshoe shaped conductor seen in fragments on previous EM surveys 
was clearly displayed in the results of the 2013 EM survey (Figure 11). The survey also 
identified several small but definite lateral displacements of the conductor axis which 
can be confidently interpreted as faults. Most of these offsets in the conductors are well 
supported by lateral displacements in linear magnetic features. 
 
The shape of a VTEM anomaly provides a good indication of the dip angle of a plate–
like conductor and has been calculated on a number of the lines. For the eastern two-
thirds of the primary conductor axis length, the dips are inward, suggesting a basin 
structure. But halfway along the north arm the dip rather suddenly changes from into the 
curve to outward suggesting a complex structure, possibly a syncline plunging to the 
west with some other movement on the north flank.  



 

 29 

 
Weak anomalies at the very south part of the survey area look as though they might join 
the two EM axes, but close inspection of the profiles in this area rules this out. The three 
flight lines that extend to cover part of the United Carina HLEM grid to the east confirm 
the existence of weak type 5 conductors. 
 
 
Lyon Lake  
 
A very well defined type 1 anomaly crossing 18 flight lines with a consistent 16 to 18 
channel response, dipping vertical, lying along the contact between magnetic and non-
magnetic rock type. The anomaly is typical of massive graphite beds. 
 
 
 Riche Lake  
 
A very low amplitude conductor of moderate (14 channels) conductance that was 
attractive due to the presence of some radioactive boulders in the vicinity. The 
anomalies have been classified as type 1 although some could just as easily be type 4 
because of the negative part in the later channels. There is no magnetic signature other 
than a general conformation to the strike direction of the bedrock shown by the 
magnetic field pattern. The anomaly is interpreted as minor graphitic bedding, probably 
somewhat disseminated. 
 
Long Lake 
  
A linear east-west anomaly, 16 to 21 channels, unbroken for ¾ of its length and then 
broken into two parts at the east end. The anomaly dips to the north from 46 to 75 
degrees. The central broken part is oriented NW-SE and is slightly less conductive. The 
west part resumes the E-W orientation and shows about 24 channels.  
 
Most of the conductor axis does not have any magnetic expression other than 
conforming to the general strike direction of the bedrock pattern as seen in the magnetic 
field map. A short part of the main anomaly shows correlation with a 25 NT magnetic 
anomaly which may indicate pyrrhotite as part of the conductive material. The anomaly 
is considered characteristic of graphite sediments. 
 
 
Big Bay  
 
The Big Bay conductors are a cluster of three conductors dominated by one strong (23 
channels) axis that has a 350 NT coincident magnetic anomaly. At least two other 
weaker and less well defined conductor axes make up the complex. The main anomaly 
strikes east-west and dips noticeably to the north, 66 degrees at the west end, 50 
degrees at the east. This conductor is similar to the Dancing Lake in that there are 



 

 30 

several conductors running parallel and close together. Again the magnetic signature 
indicates sulphides while the banded nature perhaps more likely graphite. 
 
 
Cunning Bay  
 
The Cunning Bay anomaly is a twelve kilometre long linear conductor axis that breaks 
into a small number of parallel axes toward the northeast end. Conductance is high and 
fairly uniform along its length and it lies in a mainly negative magnetic anomaly trough. 
Most of it lies under Wollaston Lake. The dip of the conductor was calculated from the 
VTEM profiles as being towards the southeast at 85 to 60 degrees. 
 
These anomalies are completely characteristic of graphitic sediments. The VTEM 
profiles are well formed, free of noise and the anomalies are clearly defined and could 
be used to position drill hole targets if follow up drilling is planned. 
 
 
Boundary  
 
A very well defined VTEM anomaly crossing about nine flight lines with a strong 
amplitude, and then continuing southwest for another 2 kilometers with reduced 
intensity. To the northeast it continues for a few lines and then turns southwest to form a 
very clear U-shaped fold. The arms of the fold are about 900 metres apart and both dip 
to the southeast, ranging in dip from 60 to 75 degrees. The conductor axis conforms 
exactly to the basement geology as outlined in the magnetic maps, particularly the 
vertical gradient, which shows a magnetic core on the inside of the fold. 
 
Dominic  
 
The Dominic anomaly appears to be a continuation of the Cunning Bay anomaly to the 
northeast. It continues to lie in a magnetic low and like the Boundary conductor forms a 
U-shaped fold. The dip of both arms of the fold is to the southeast, at about 70 degrees. 
The shape of the conductor conforms well to the bedrock geology as seen in the 
magnetic patterns.  
 
 
Horse Lake  
 
The Horse Lake conductor is a good quality type 1 anomaly crossing 17 flight lines with 
a high conductance ranging from 16 to 23 channels. The main part strikes northeast but 
a splay section cuts off part way down to the west. The splay is less conductive, 
showing on about 15 channels. There is no real magnetic signature; it does not really 
conform to the bedrock structure displayed by the magnetics nor does it have a directly 
coincident magnetic anomaly. The main part of the conductor dips at 90 degrees on 
average, although this varies from 80 degrees SE to NW along its full length. The splay 
dips at about 70 degrees to the south.  



 

 31 

 
The conductor is somewhat different from those discussed up to now because of its 
non-conformity to the basement geology as shown in the magnetic pattern. This would 
suggest that perhaps it is controlled by faulting than by stratification. The conductor is 
considered to be characteristic of massive graphite. 
 
 
Jeffrey and Marcus  
 
These two conductor axes are very similar in character to the Dominic and Cunning Bay 
conductors in that they are composed of moderate to good conductance anomalies, lie 
entirely within non-magnetic rock, and conform to the bedrock structure as seen in the 
magnetic maps. The Jeffrey conductor forms an S-shaped pattern, again conforming 
well to the magnetic pattern in the vertical gradient map. 
 
 
Crochet  
 
The Crochet conductor axis is a combination of type 1 and type 4 anomalies and as 
such is interpreted as a conductor that is composed of disseminated particles at each 
end and is more massive in the middle. It lies along a contact between rock types of 
high and low magnetic susceptibility as seen in the magnetic pattern. The dip is 
relatively shallow, 47 degrees to the southeast. As with the Horse Lake conductor, it is 
most likely to be at bedrock surface, some 30 metres depth at most.  
 
 
Rapids 
 
The Rapids conductor is a trend of long (3+ km) type 4 anomalies that has a partial 
correlation to a linear magnetic anomaly. At present it is mainly of academic interest and 
until more is understood about the type 4 anomaly, this is not given a priority for further 
investigation.  
 
 
Turkey  
 
The Turkey anomaly is a high quality conductor axis that is seen on both sets of flight 
lines (NE and NW trending). Its conductivity is high with the anomalies on the southern 
lines being seen on all 26 channels. It has high amplitude and exhibits virtually no noise. 
The dip is to the east, 78 to 85 degrees. It lies in a magnetic low, conforms reasonably 
well to the bedrock structure as outlined by the magnetic maps and has all of the 
characteristics of massive graphite.  
 
 
  



 

 32 

Ghost Lake  
 
Ghost Lake is a moderate conductor ranging from 12 to 17 channel activity with an S 
shape and a small spur leading off to the southeast. It conforms reasonably well to the 
contact between rock types of differing magnetic susceptibility. It is interpreted as a 
plate dipping to the east, 86 degrees at the north end and more like 70 degrees toward 
the south, and has the characteristics of graphitic sediments. 
 
 
Turkey East  
 
The Turkey East is a short axis of rather minor type 4 anomalies that normally would be 
disregarded, except that it leads directly to a uranium channel radiometric anomaly. 
There is some conformation to a magnetic anomaly seen on the vertical magnetic 
gradient map. The EM anomaly is interpreted as caused by disseminated graphite 
sediments. 
 
 
Mustang  
 
The Mustang is a conductor group composed of two parallel axes of type 1 and type 4 
anomalies. The type 4 anomaly is thick massive clay alteration at the unconformity 
proven from diamond drilling. The conductor may also connect across the unsurveyed 
portion of the property to a similar group some 2 km to the northeast. 
 
 
8.1.4 Enhancement of Total Magnetic Field 
 
The airborne survey also measured the total magnetic field and produced a map and a 
database channel of total magnetic intensity. The magnetic field has been enhanced by 
computing the Tilt Magnetic Derivative (Figures 10 and 11), which assists in mapping 
bedrock geology, and in understanding the host rocks for the E.M. conductors. 
 
 
8.2 Airborne Radiometric Survey 
 
During the period of July 8th to 14th, 2007, an airborne high resolution radiometric survey 
was flown over all the Red Willow claims. A total of 2,636 line-kilometres of data were 
acquired by the survey. The specifications of the survey were designed to provide better 
than average sensitivity by using large crystals in a helicopter flying at low speed and 
low ground clearance. Calculations from the final database show the speed was 99 +/- 
10 kph and the ground clearance was 36 +/- 9 metres. The total crystal size (downward) 
was 33.6 litres or 2215 cubic inches. 
 
  



 

 33 

8.2.1 Quality Control 
 
Daily quality control, post-processing of GPS positions and archiving of the data were 
completed by MPX at the Richmond Hill, Ontario office using Geosoft's OASIS Montaj 
software and a PC computer.  
 
All data were verified upon receipt, and checked against the flight logs. Images of the 
collected data were forwarded to the client daily.  
 
The final data processing, map and report preparation was completed by MPX at the 
Richmond Hill, Ontario office. 
 
 
8.2.2 Corrections of Airborne Radiometric Data 
 
Gamma-ray spectrometer surveys are utilized for mapping the concentration and 
distribution of naturally occurring radioelements. The use of an airborne gamma-ray 
spectrometer allows for the in-situ analysis of radioelement concentrations of naturally 
occurring Potassium (K), Uranium (U) and Thorium (Th) in the field.  
 
Radioactivity measurements from an airborne platform are dependent upon the 
detection of gamma rays produced through radioactive decay of the nuclide to be 
detected. Only three radioactive elements emit sufficient gamma radiation to be 
measured by airborne methods. 
 
The three major sources are:  
• Potassium-40 (40K) which comprises 0.011% of all potassium  
• Daughter products from the 214Bi (238U) decay series,  
• Daughter products from the 208Tl (232Th) decay series.  
 
High energy cosmic rays of non-terrestrial origin can be detected by airborne gamma-
ray spectrometer surveys. This cosmic radiation interacts with molecules in the 
atmosphere, the aircraft, and the NaI detectors resulting in the production of high 
energy radiation. This radiation is detectable and increases exponentially with height 
above sea level and must be compensated for to obtain reliable and repeatable 
measurements and detection of terrestrial radiation sources.  
 
Care must be taken during the acquisition of gamma-ray spectrometer data as the 
contribution from radon gas and related decay products in the atmosphere can result in 
misleading count rates. Radon gas can also diffuse from the ground, but only one radon 
nuclide is directly related to the Uranium decay series. In order to minimize the impact 
of radon "contamination", radiometric surveys are not completed during rain (since it 
"washes" radon from the air and increases ground concentrations) or fog conditions and 
for a period of not less than 2 hours after precipitation has finished in order to allow for 
dispersion of radon gas to normal background levels.  
 



 

 34 

Radiometric surveys have limited depth penetration; most radioactive sources being 
within the upper 1.5 metres of the ground. Radiometric surveys are therefore not 
effective over water bodies or snow covered areas, the presence of water (in either 
liquid or solid state) effectively masking radiometric sources. 
 
 
8.2.3 Discussion of Radiometric Survey Results 
 
Some forms of data enhancement were carried out by the Toronto office of Purepoint 
Uranium Group for this interpretation. To emphasize uranium anomalies, the data is 
presented as a coloured grid with a lower limit that has been clipped at about the lower 
background level so as to obtain a more useful spread of colours in the color table. 
Values below 1.2 equivalent uranium were removed and this had the effect of removing 
most values over water and some swamp areas. The grid is displayed using a linear 
scale to emphasize maximum peak values. The resulting uranium channel map was 
overlaid with the location of VTEM anomalies axes (Figure 12).  
 
Five anomalous areas were selected that warrant follow up field inspections.  
 
Anomaly A is clearly on an extension of a small VTEM anomaly axis. 
 
The B anomaly is seen on five flight lines with a peak value at 8 ppm over the average 
background of 1.5 ppm. It has a strike length of 600 metres and may be connected to a 
VTEM EM anomaly. 
 
Anomalies C and D are of similar strength but are connected to a strong regional 
anomalous areas (Scrimes Lake) explored earlier by Gulf Minerals. 
 
Anomaly E is of lower intensity (4.5 ppm) but lies on a conductor axis. 
 
The ternary map shows the potassium rich Archean rocks contrasted to the Proterozoic 
sediments by the increase in the potassium channel. The contrast is reasonably well 
defined and has been used to map the eastern contact of the Athabasca basin in the 
claim block (Figure 9). 
 
 
8.3 Boulder Prospecting 
 
A boulder sampling survey was conducted during July 2006 to definitively map out the 
historic Long Lake radioactive boulder train and attempt to follow it to its source Figure 
13). The survey also attempted to discover new occurrences of radioactive boulders to 
focus exploration efforts on. A total of 84 boulder samples were submitted to SRC for 
analysis of major and trace elements using two different digestions, partial and total, 
similar to the till samples. 
 
In 2011, a boulder prospecting program covered areas north of the Lasby Lake camp, 
and those within the Dancing Lake and Big Bay targets (Figure 14). Targets were

prospected for uranium anomalies, generated by reprocessing the airborne radiometrics 
data. Samples comprised 44 sandstones with conglomerate, 7 granitic gneisses, and 
one granite boulder. A total of 6 sandstone boulder samples were collected for assay 
where CPS readings were found to be particularly high. 
 
 
8.3.1 Sampling Method, Preparation and Analysis 
 
During the two prospecting programs, CPS readings were taken using a GR110 
Scintillometer. 
 
Samples for assay were sent to, and analysed by, Saskatchewan Research Council 
Geoanalytical Laboratories of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The samples were analysed 
by method of fluorimetry and Inductively Coupled Plasma with Optical Emission 
Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for partial digestion values of Ag, As, Bi, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, 
Sb, Se, U, V, and Zn as well as total digestion values of Ag, Al2O3, Ba, Be, CaO, Cd, 
Co, Cr, Cu, Fe2O3, K2O, Li, MgO, MnO, Mo, Na2O, Nb, Ni, P2O5, Pb, Th, TiO2, U, V, 
Zn, Zr, and B. 
 
 
8.3.2 Discussion of Results 
 
The 2006 Long Lake survey documented boulders of granite, biotite schist, pegmatite, 
meta-sediment and amphibolite. A highlight of the boulder sampling was 1.30% U3O8 
returned from an autunite and biotite bearing quartz vein hosted in a biotite gneiss 
(metasediment) boulder located west of Long Lake (Figure 13). 
 
The 2011 survey mapped sandstone boulders that were sub-rounded to angular, while 
the granitic gneisses and granite boulders were both sub-rounded. Conglomerate 
boulders with anomalous radioactivity were mapped at the locations of airborne uranium 
anomalies and were interpreted to be either in-situ or close to their source based on 
their angularity and location. 
 
 
8.4 Geochemical Surveys 
 
Geochemical surveys including soil, vegetation and tree core sampling were completed 
during 2012 with the objective of confirming historic anomalous geochemical 
occurrences and to identify new exploration target areas. Soil sampling covered the 
Osprey, Geneva, Cross and Recon areas while the vegetation and tree core sampling 
only covered the Cross and Recon areas. 
8.4.1 Sampling Method, Preparation and Analysis 
 
All soil and vegetation samples were analysed by Acme Analytical Laboratories (ACME) 
in Vancouver, British Columbia. Tree core samples were analysed by Queen's Facility 
for Isotope Research (QFIR) in Kingston, Ontario.  



 

 39 

 
The soil samples consisted of an average 1kg sample collected using a stainless-steel 
serrated soil scoop; the material then transferred into a large Ziploc-brand freezer bag 
for storage and transportation. Samples targeted the clay-rich "B" and "C" horizons; 
however "A" horizons were collected in boggy and peat-rich areas where the 
development of B and/or C horizons were lacking. Each vegetation site consisted of two 
sample types: a cuttings sample of twigs and needles, referenced as vegetation, and a 
tree core sample. Both vegetation and tree core samples were collected preferentially 
from black spruce (Picea mariana) or jack pine (Pinus banksiana) when black spruce 
was not available at a sample site and were recovered using a pruning tool and a tree 
corer respectively. Preparation methods for all three media types are detailed below. 
 
Clay separations for soil samples involved ~500g of sample being loaded into a 2L 
nalgene bottle with 1L of de-ionized (DI) water and 1 tsp of Calgon and sonicated for 
two minutes. The solution is then decanted into 4x 250ml centrifuge bottles and spun at 
2500rpm to pull out course material. The solution is decanted into a second set of 
centrifuge bottles and spun at 8000rpm to pull the less than 2 µm fraction out. The 
remaining solution is discarded and the clay on the bottom of the bottle is suspended in 
a small amount of DI before final drying to recover the clay. Once the clay fractions are 
separated from the soil, the samples were sent to the lab to undergo the Acme's 1F 
aqua regia analysis package. 
 
Each vegetation sample consisted of two types of material; needles and twigs. The 
needles were chosen as the preferred material for analysis. In order to prepare the 
needles, they were first separated from the twigs before undergoing Acme's ashing 
procedure. This involves ~100-200g of dry needle material being weighed in 200-400ml 
beakers (rough pre-milling is required for some types of samples). The beakers are 
placed in the oven with a temperature profile of 4 hour ramp up to 475C, followed by 16 
hours held at 475C, followed by a 4 hour cool down. Ash product is weighed and 
transferred to plastic bags and sent for Acme's 1F analysis. 
 
For both soil and vegetation samples, the 1F analysis involves an aqua regia digestion 
designed for low to ultra-determinations. Samples are analysed by ICP-MS and ICP-
OES for 68 elements, including lead isotope analysis and REE analysis.  
 
 
8.4.2 Quality Control 
 
The SRC laboratory ran multiple standards and repeats when analysing the 
geochemical data. The results for each standard were averaged for the 10 elements of 
interest, namely U, Mo, V, Pb206, Pb207, Ni, Co, Zn, B and LOI, and visually inspected 
against the average to estimate the variance. The repeatability of the standards is 
shown to quite good with minimal variation. The SRC lab duplicates provided good 
repeatable results.

8.4.3 Discussion of Results 
 
The geochemical sampling at Red Willow produced several areas of interest. After 
analyzing the geochemical samples results from all three surveys, eight areas of 
interest were chosen. Anomalies 1 to 4 are located in the Geneva Area (Figure 15), 
anomalies 5 to 7 are located in the Cross and Recon Areas (Figure 16) while anomalies 
8 and 9 are located in the Osprey area (Figure 17). The location of vegetation and tree 
core anomalies are circled in blue and red (Figure 16).  
 
Anomaly 1 is a multi-element anomaly that appears within the main Geneva area at the 
nose of two VTEM conductors and is coincident with a gravity low. The anomaly 
includes 4.2ppm U, 87 ppm V, 44.6 ppm La, 100.8 ppm Ce, 7.65 ppm Cu, 10.2 ppm Ni, 
26.9 ppm Li and a radiogenic 207Pb/206Pb value of 0.56. It is still considered significant 
given its coincidence with the gravity low, interpreted structure and VTEM conductors. 
No vegetation sampling was done over the Geneva area. 
 
Anomaly 2 is a multi-element anomaly that appears within the main Geneva area. This 
area is anomalous in U and elevated in Ce, La, Zn, and a radiogenic Pb isotopic 
signature. Although the target is anomalous in pathfinders, it is located in a resistivity 
and electromagnetic high.  
 
Anomaly 3 is in the Geneva zone has been interpreted outside the Geneva conductor 
which extends from the end of a VTEM conductor to the SE of the main Geneva 
conductor through holes RAD-07, 08 and 09. This arcuate feature is also characterized 
by elevated Ni, Cu, Ce, La, Li, and a radiogenic Pb isotopic signature. This anomaly is 
located over a granite confirmed by drill hole 12RDW003.  
 
Anomaly 4 is elevated U, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ce, La, Li and a radiogenic Pb signature and is 
coincident with an area of low gravity along the northern portion of the Geneva 
conductor. This anomaly occurs along the curved Geneva conductor in a gravity low 
and magnetic high.  
 
Anomaly 5 is located in the Cross area (Figure 16) and contains a moderate uranium 
anomaly with three samples returning uranium between 3.2 ppm and 3.7 ppm. This 
same area also shows elevated Cu, Ni, Mo, As, Li, La, Ce and a radiogenic Pb 
signature.  
 
Anomaly 6 is located in the Recon Area and returned a uranium value returned of 10.6 
ppm located along a northeast trending lineament extending from the area surrounding 
the CBA series of DDH's, approximately along the hinge line of prominent magnetic low 
features. Several other elements appear to highlight this trend, including La, Ce, Cu, Ni 
and radiogenic Pb isotopes. The area surrounding the CBA series DDHs that is at the 
southern extent of the anomaly which is also a highlighted with a vegetation anomaly in 
blue (Figure 16).

Anomaly 7 trends approximately north-south and is located at the northeast corner of 
the Recon grid as is also associated with elevated Cu, Ni, Ce, La, Li and radiogenic Pb 
isotopes. This area also appears to have both northeast trending and east-west trending 
fault systems as interpreted from magnetics along with an arcuate VTEM conductor. 
 
Anomaly 8 is located in the Osprey area (Figure 17) that located a multi-element 
anomaly in the vicinity of known mineralization within the Osprey conductor and extends 
approximately 1km to the northeast away from the conductor. The anomaly includes 
elevated U (max 12.8ppm), base metals such as Ni (81.1ppm), Cu (101.87ppm), and Zn 
(343.2ppm), REE's La (90.8ppm), and Ce (255.4ppm), as well as other trace elements 
such As (14.6ppm) and V (339ppm). 
 
Anomaly 9 is a northeast-southwest trending lineament of elevated U extending from 
the Osprey hinge area. 
 
When comparing tree core results with vegetation and soils in the Cross and Recon 
grids it appears there is little correlation (Figure 16). For example the uranium anomaly 
seen in both soil and vegetation samples NE of the CBA series of drill holes is not 
evident in the tree core samples. The anomalies identified in the tree core samples are 
not evident in soil or vegetation samples which can possibly be explained by biological 
filtering of elements by the trees, which could affect relative concentrations of those 
elements in different parts of the plant (i.e. needles vs. cored trunk wood). 
 
 
8.4.4 Conclusions 

 
The soil and vegetation sampling programs is considered to be a low-cost exploration 
technique that is useful in delineating targets over a large area relatively quickly. The 
results of the vegetation and soil anomalies are comparable and occasionally overlap. 
 
 
8.5 Ground Geophysical Surveys 
 
The grids established on the Red Willow project during 2007 were utilized for several 
types of geophysical surveying including Induced Polarization (IP), electromagnetics 
(EM) and gravity (Table 2). 
 
Gradient and pole-dipole IP surveys were carried out on several parts of the Red Willow 
claim block by Peter E. Walcott and Associates Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C. during the 
period August to October, 2007. A three dimensional resistivity survey was also carried 
out over several areas by SJV Geophysics Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C. during the period 
January to March, 2007.

Gradient array resistivity was conducted by Patterson Geophysics Inc. (PGI) of La 
Ronge, Saskatchewan surveying over the Osprey West grid, and recent extensions of 
the Dancing Lake and Big Bay grids during the period August to September, 2011. 
 
A gravity survey was carried out over portions of the Osprey and the Geneva grids in 
February 2007 by Excel Geophysics Inc. of High River, Alberta. A second gravity survey 
was also conducted over the Geneva and Radon grids between January and February, 
2012 by Eastern Geophysics Ltd. of West Pubnico, N.S. 
 
 
8.5.1 Induced Polarization – Gradient Array Methodology  
 
The gradient array IP/resistivity surveys were designed to confirm and evaluate airborne 
EM anomalies, and to investigate whether the measurement of chargeability and 
resistivity would be useful in locating the alteration halo minerals that are associated 
with uranium deposits. The gradient array is more of a mapping tool and displays the 
chargeability and resistivity as surface maps much like a magnetic survey. 
 
The IP/resistivity survey was carried out using and IRIS Instruments ELREC Pro time 
domain IP-Resistivity receiver, a Walcer TX 9000, 9+ KW IP transmitter, and a Walcer 
MX6 or MG-12 motor generator. Stainless steel rods were used for the current and 
potential electrodes. 
 
The gradient electrode array involves establishing 2 infinite current electrodes 
approximately a distance equal to the survey line length, parallel to and off both ends of 
a line in the center of the survey area. The two current electrodes remain fixed for a 
number of survey lines in both directions until the primary voltage signal becomes too 
weak to obtain a reliable reading. The two fixed current electrodes are hooked to a 
transmitter via #14 gauge wires and a "Square Wave", 2 second on 2 seconds off pulse 
is applied across the 2 electrodes. This creates a relatively deep current path between 
the two current electrodes. A pair of potential electrodes, attached to a Time Domain IP 
Receiver is moved up and down the survey lines, recording the "IP" effect 
(chargeability) and apparent resistivity values. An apparent resistivity reading, and on 
some grids a chargeability reading, were recorded at each 25 meter station along the 
grid lines using a potential dipole spacing of 50 meters, moving every 25 meters. When 
the primary voltage signal recorded across the receiver potential dipole became too 



 

 46 

weak on lines further away from the current dipole, the two current electrodes were 
moved to the approximate center of the next survey rectangular area. 
 
Parameters digitally recorded in the ELREC Pro receivers for each potential dipole 
location included: 

• decimal chargeability for 20 separate window widths 
• cumulative average of the total chargeability and its standard deviation 
• type of decay curve measured 
• primary voltage 
• current intensity 
• self-potential 
• apparent resistivity 
• contact resistance for each electrode 
• grid co-ordinates for each electrode 

 
The gradient resistivity and chargeability results are plotted as coloured contour plan 
maps using Geosoft Inc.'s data processing software. 
 
 
8.5.2 Induced Polarization – Pole-dipole Array Methodology 
 
The 3D-IP technique is a modified pole-dipole configuration that uses current electrodes 
and receiver electrodes located on adjacent lines. Under these conditions, multiple 
current locations can be applied to a single receiver electrode array. The system of 
electrode emplacement enables inversion software to calculate the resistivity in volume 
pixels (voxels). Vertical sections in any direction and plan maps of any layer can then be 
drawn showing contoured images of calculated resistivity. 
 
In a common 3D-IP configuration, a receiver array is established, end-to-end along a 
survey line while current electrodes are located on two adjacent lines. The survey 
typically starts at one end of the line and proceeds to the other end. A typical 12 dipole 
array normally consists of one 300m dipole, followed by one 200m dipole and then nine 
100m dipoles, and a 200m dipole at the end of the array. In some areas these spacings 
are modified to compensate for local conditions such as inaccessible sites, streams, 
and overall conductivity of ground. Current electrodes are advanced along the adjacent 
lines, starting at approximately 1000m from the center of the array and advancing 
approximately 1000m through the array at 100m increments. At this point, the receiver 
array is advanced 600m and the process is repeated down the line. Receiver arrays are 
typically established on every second line (400m apart) thereby providing subsurface 
coverage at 200m increments. 
 
The typical pole-dipole array was also conducted using a 100-meter dipole spacing with 
six "n's" or dipoles. Because of the extremely high impedance of the ground contacts, 
water and salt were applied to the moving current electrode to increase the output 
current with mixed results.  
 



 

 47 

The same parameters as the gradient pole-dipole array surveys were recorded by the 
ELREC Pro time domain receiver for each potential dipole location: 
 
The Inversion Program (DCINV3D), developed by the UBC-Geophysical Inversion 
Facility was used by the SJ Geophysical Group to invert the 3D-IP resistivity data. 
Purepoint also used the UBC inversion code as well as the RES2DINV software to 
invert the pole-dipole IP results. Geosoft's data processing software is used to slice the 
3D-IP inversion results at various orientations. 
 
 
8.5.3 Transient Electromagnetic Survey Methodology 
 
Purepoint's Chief Geophysicist, Roger K. Watson, P.Eng. has reviewed and interpreted 
the results of the TEM surveys. The anomalies were evaluated with respect to their 
quality as electromagnetic conductors and in relation to other geophysical data. Quality 
control was ensured by repeating 5 to 10 Read Stations per day. The average 
repeatability was 1% in early channels and the worst result being 2%. 
 
The TEM survey was designed to inspect and confirm airborne E.M. anomalies, and it 
utilized the stepwise moving loop (SWML) array with transmitter coil movements of 200 
metres. The size of the transmitter coil on all lines was 200 x 400 metres. The 
anomalies are 'picked' from profiles displayed on a Geosoft database format. 

 
Modeling shows that conductor axes are located under local maxima and minima on the 
x channel and at points of inflection on the z channel. The y channel shows a 'cross-
over' for conductors crossing the traverse line at an angle, and which disappears when 
the conductor crosses the traverse line at exactly 90 degrees. 
 
To help find points of inflection and local maxima and minima the profiles are smoothed 
using a low pass filter where needed, and the first difference is calculated for the last 
five channels. Some points of inflection are difficult to pick but will show a maximum or 
minimum on the first difference. An x channel maximum or minimum will show a profile 
passing through zero on the first difference.  
 
The anomaly picks are assembled on a spreadsheet and plotted as in Figure 18. There 
is always some variation in the location of the conductor from loop to loop but this can 
be resolved by grouping them, assigning a letter, and then calculating the average 
location in local co-ordinates. The average value is the most probable location and 
should be used to position a vertical drill hole. The standard deviation is the uncertainty 
that can be expected in the positioning.

8.5.4 Gravity Survey Methodology 
 
The purpose of the gravity surveying was to see if the gravity field would supply 
additional information about the geological structure in the vicinity of VTEM conductor 
axes. Gravity and elevation readings were typically obtained at 50m intervals along cut 
lines spaced at 100 metres. Some readings were at 25 meters for infill stations. The 
survey was conducted with a LaCoste & Romberg model G gravity meters, Leica - 
model 1230 Dual Frequency RTK, DGPS Base Station and Rovers, and an Alegro CX 
dataloggers. The data was manipulated using Geosoft geophysical software and Leica 
Geo-Office GPS software 
 
All the gravity data has been calculated or reduced to Bouguer mgal. values. These 
calculations correct for the following parameters (1) elevation, free- air correction, 
instrument height; (2) latitude correction; (3) tide correction on a daily basis; (4) 
instrument drift; and, when required; (5) water depth & ice thickness; and (6) terrain 
corrections. In order to verify the accuracy of these corrections, 5.26% of the readings 
were observed again as random repeat readings. Repeat readings were to be no 
greater than 0.05 mgal.

8.5.5 Osprey Area - Results and Conclusions 
 
The ground geophysical surveys conducted at the Osprey area of Red Willow are 
summarized within an index map (see in Figure 19). 
 
The Osprey conductor, the S-shaped conductor that cuts through the area, is a strong, 
noise free VTEM anomaly, and its path can be seen clearly in the resistivity pattern 
(Figure 20). Values as low as <30 ohm metres are seen along the length of this 
conductor which would be interpreted as indicating massive conductive material such as 
graphitic sediments. At the SW end of the Osprey conductor, the VTEM axis has been 
interpreted as having a lateral displacement to the south and this is supported by the 
resistivity contours. The Osprey area was surveyed with 3D-IP over two overlapping 
grids, with the 100 metre depth slice being used for comparison with the VTEM 
anomalies. 
 
Whether the VTEM is associated with basement clay alteration cannot be directly 
determined since the conductivity of the graphitic pelites is assumed to overshadow the 
conductive effect of the alteration minerals. However, as discussed in detail in Section 
9, areas of high resistivity appears to be mapping out strong silicification and felsic 
rocks including granites and granitized pelites. 
 
The 3D-IP resistivity anomalies correlate well with airborne and ground EM anomalies in 
most places, particularly at medium depths. They show increased widths with an 
increase in depth which departs from the usual geological model and may be an 
'artifact' of the inversion process. But it may also be the correct picture and so should be 
borne in mind for verification during subsequent drilling programs. 
 
A gradient resistivity survey on the western portion of the Osprey grid has a small 
overlap with the 3D-IP results at the SW end of the Osprey conductor (Figure 21). The 
gradient results correlate quite well with the ground EM anomalies outlined within this 
area.  
 
The EM anomalies found in the 2006 fixed loop survey are mainly confirmed by the 
VTEM survey results. The circular flat lying conductor located just south of drill hole 
RW-07 (Figure 20) remains unexplained. It can be seen in the VTEM results but it does 
not look like the model of graphitic beds in the basement. It has been postulated that 
wide-spread clay alteration may be responsible or a conductive material in the 
overburden. 
 
The gravity survey revealed a positive gravity anomaly of 2.5 milligals centered at the 
southwest side of the grid (Figure 22). It is approximately 600 metres wide and its edge, 
to some extent, conforms to the shape of the EM conductor axis. Modeling the anomaly 
to a geometrical shape showed a relatively poor fit to a 550 metre wide cylinder, 150 
below ground surface and 71 metres thick. An asymmetrical polygon was found to be a 
better fit with a density contrast of 0.44 gms/cc, a reasonable contrast between high and 
low density units of the Athabasca sandstone. It may represent a dome structure with 
the more dense members in the center.

8.5.6 Geneva and Radon Lake Area - Results and Conclusions 
 
The ground geophysical surveys conducted within the Geneva and Radon Lake areas 
of Red Willow are summarized within an index map that is provided in Figure 23. 
 
The Geneva grid was surveyed with a block of sixteen gradient array lines followed by 
four pole-dipole lines. The gradient array resistivity map shows a well-defined resistivity 
low anomaly occupying the center of the survey grid (Figure 24). Its relationship to the 
VTEM anomalies is remarkable in that the VTEM anomalies define almost exactly the 
northern edge, and to a lesser extent the eastern edge of the conductive basin. The 
interpretation of the VTEM anomalies is that they represent a shallow dipping oval 
shaped basin dipping into the center at about 30 to 45 degrees. The gradient array 
resistivity clearly supports this interpretation. The chargeability results are less definitive 
since they show chargeable material within the basin although not at the edges where 
the VTEM anomaly is interpreted to lie (Figure 25). Within the centre of the grid, an 
anomalous chargeability low coincides with a VTEM conductor and an interpreted low 
apparent resistivity "chimney" in the sandstone (interpreted from inverted pole-dipole IP 
data)  
 
The gradient resistivity pattern at Radon Lake shows a direct correlation to the VTEM 
anomaly that cuts through the grid in a NNE strike direction (Figure 24). It is most 
intense at the southern part where the VTEM anomaly is also at a maximum intensity. A 
resistivity high on the east side of the anomaly and low to the west with the VTEM 
conductor axis apparently forms a divide or a contact between them. To the south 
where the VTEM anomaly is strongest, the resistivity shows a clear anomaly low. The 
chargeability shows the same effect with the chargeability high being on the west side of 
the contact (Figure 25). It is clear that the conductor axis is part of a geological contact 
of some type. 
 
The location of the four pole-dipole lines at Geneva are shown in Figure 23 and the 
inversion results are provided as stacked sections in Figure 26. The resistivity anomaly 
defining the basin in the gradient array results is clearly seen in the later n values on all 
four lines, and it increases in amplitude with depth. 
 
The pole-dipole resistivity anomaly at Geneva supports the gradient resistivity array 
anomaly and is interpreted as a broad conductive and chargeable mass occurring below 
the sandstone. Zones of low resistivity within the sandstone may represent "chimneys" 
of hydrothermal alteration associated with structures controlling uranium mineralization 
at the unconformity or within the basement rocks (LARC Principal, R. Koch; PDAC 
Convention 2007). Drill hole GEN11-01 intercepted alteration and a minor structure in 
the sandstone that coincides with a possible LARC (Low Apparent Resistivity Chimney). 
Zones interpreted to be possible LARCs on Lines 60 and 61E (Figure 26) coincide with 
where two short VTEM conductors terminate (Figure 24).  
 
A limited gravity survey was conducted over the Geneva grid in 2007 (Figure 27). Two 
subtle gravity depressions on L62E were found to correlate with the LARCs and the

termination of the two VTEM conductors. A gravity survey conducted in 2012 was 
designed to support the initial results and provide more extensive coverage. The gravity 
depressions were supported by the new data and are now interpreted to be related to 
the strong basement alteration reported by Cameco in holes RAD-17, 19 and 27 and 
with follow up holes drilled in 2014 (Figure 27). The eastern gravity low anomaly is 
interpreted to be open to the east. A gravity low in the vicinity of drill holes GEN11-01 
and 2 where clay alteration was seen locally in both holes and numerous faults were 
encountered by GEN11-02 may be reflecting alteration in the area. The gravity low in 
the vicinity of hole 12RDW003 was not explained by the drilling and is possibly an 
overburden artifact. 
 
On the Radon grid, the elongate gravity low that correlates with the VTEM conductor is 
a response to thick overburden material. Due to the extreme thickness of the esker, 
attempts to filter off the surficial material returned inconclusive results. A gravity low 
located at the north end of the esker may have a bedrock source. 
 
 
8.5.7 Long Lake, Lyon and 333 Areas – Results and Conclusions 
 
The ground geophysical surveys conducted within the Long Lake, Lyon and 333 areas 
of Red Willow are summarized within an index map that is provided in Figure 28. 
 
The 3D IP interpretation map of the Long Lake area (Figure 29) shows the calculated 
inverted resistivity at a depth slice of approximately 200 metres below ground surface. 
VTEM and TEM anomalies are superimposed as symbols and a conductor axis. 
 
There is a very close correlation with low resistivity measurements and high 
conductance airborne anomalies. In area 333, anomaly A, which is the strongest VTEM, 
also shows the lowest resistivity in the inversion slice. Furthermore, the small break in 
the linearity of the conductor is reflected in the resistivity contours. The same is 
observed for anomaly E in the Long Lake area where the conductor axis is broken in the 
centre of the resistivity grid, and is again reflected in the resistivity pattern. This is 
excellent confirmation of the ability of both methods to accurately represent the ground 
resistivity. 
 
Anomaly A has been analyzed in the VTEM interpretation and is interpreted as being 
caused by steeply dipping massive conductive material such as graphitic sediments. By 
scrolling through the range of depth slices and the cross sections in SJV's report, the 
anomaly is seen to increase in width as depth increases. This implies that the graphite 
bands are increasing in number and/or width with depth. This could be just an artifact or 
peculiarity of the inversion process but it could also be true representation of the 
geometry of the conductor. The dip is calculated from the VTEM profiles to be 85 
degrees east.  
 
Anomaly B is composed of type 4 anomalies and is well supported by three definite but 
weak TEM anomalies. It is also seen in the resistivity contours, which show a good

 63 

correlation with the distribution of airborne anomaly symbols. This anomaly is 
interpreted to be caused by less conductive graphitic sediments, possibly because they 
are more disseminated than massive. 
 
Anomaly C is the tail end of the strong Lyon Lake conductor and is clearly reduced in 
conductance.  
 
Anomaly D is a low conductance extension of the Riche Lake anomaly. It is partially 
confirmed by the resistivity but in general is very weak. 
 
Anomaly E is confirmation of a strong VTEM conductor and the resistivity pattern 
conforms well to the discontinuity in the linearity of the conductor axis. It is interpreted 
as graphitic sediments. 
 
Anomaly F is the continuation of Anomaly E to the east where it has been confirmed by 
ground transient E.M. methods. It can be drilled from the existing E.M. information and 
does not require more resistivity survey data. 
 
Gradient data over the 333 Area (Figures 30 and 31) covers a strong well-defined 
VTEM anomaly striking north south through the middle of the grid, plus a few minor 
scattered E.M. anomalies to the south. The resistivity supports the airborne data, 
showing a clear resistivity low correlating with the airborne anomaly (Figure 30). The 
chargeability also supports it although not quite as well defined as the resistivity (Figure 
31). The interpretation is that the VTEM conductor represents massive conductive 
material for all of its length, probably graphite or sulphide minerals. 
 
The gradient array resistivity and chargeability data at Lyon Lake show low resistivity 
and high chargeability anomalies that correlate well with airborne and ground E.M. 
anomalies (Figures 30 and 31). A strong Type 1 VTEM anomaly strikes NNE in the 
center of the grid and is interpreted as a band of steeply dipping graphitic sediments. 
The I.P. data supports this interpretation completely showing high chargeability and low 
resistivity exactly where it would be expected. 
 
Conductors interpreted from the Step-wise Moving Loop EM survey results are provided 
in Figures 28 to 31 with the symbol-sized according to the strength of the anomaly. 
 
 
8.5.8 Dancing Lake and Big Bay Area - Results and Conclusions 
 
An index map for the ground geophysical surveys conducted on the Dancing Lake and 
Big Bay grids is provided in Figure 23 along with the Geneva and Radon Lake surveys. 
 
The gradient resistivity survey over the southern portion of the Dancing Lake grid 
covered three type 1 VTEM conductor axes of moderate conductivity that are relatively 
short in dimension and do not conform to regional geological trends. The resistivity 
shows a broad low that includes the VEM conductor axes but does not correlate to it

(Figure 32). The shapes and widths are quite different and one conductor crosses over 
into highly resistive ground to its east. 
 
The gradient resistivity survey over the Dancing Lake and Big Bay grid extensions to the 
north was conducted along an interpreted strong northeast trending ductile shear zone 
(Figure 32). The purpose of the survey was to map out possible brittle north-south faults 
where they crosscut the major shear zone. The resistivity results support the interpreted 
structure and suggest crosscutting faults may be present. 
 
The results of pole-dipole array IP over 5 lines (Figure 32) are considered to agree with 
the gradient array results. Two possible LARCs underlain by VTEM conductors have 
been interpreted on Lines 21 and 28N.  
 
Of the two east-west trending EM conductors found on the Dancing Lake grid, the most 
northerly of the two is on trend with the conductor tested by the historic holes Dan-1 to 7 
(Figure 32). The historic holes intersected pyritic graphitic pelitic gneiss suggesting that 
at least this one EM conductor, if not all three, are responding to graphitic basement 
rock. 
 
 
9. DIAMOND DRILLING 
 
On the Red Willow property, a total of 16,546 metres have been drilled with 64 NQ 
diamond drill holes being completed by Purepoint and 15 holes by Rio Tinto. The 2007 
diamond drill program was conducted by Denair Beach Drilling of Denair Beach, SK; the 
2008, 2010 and 2011 programs by Aggressive Drilling of Prince Albert, SK; and the 
2012 and 2014 programs by Bryson Drilling Ltd. of Archerwill, SK. 
 
Purepoint drilled seven drill holes in 2007 totaling 1,303 metres on the Osprey grid while 
the 2008 drill program consisted of 17 drill holes in the Osprey area, 13 holes in the 
Radon Lake area and 7 on the Long Lake grid for a total of 7,160 metres. During 2010, 
a 20-hole diamond drill program totaling 3,292 metres again concentrated on the 
Osprey grid. 
 
Rio Tinto drilled two holes on the Geneva grid in 2011 for a total of 591 metres. In 2012 
three holes in the Osprey area and one hole in the Geneva area were completed for a 
total of 1,466 metres. A ten hole, 2,734 metre diamond drill program was completed in 
2014 with two holes drilled in the Osprey area, three holes within the Mustang area, four 
within the Geneva area and one in the Lasby Lake area. 
 
A summary of the drill hole collars are provided in Table 3.

9.1 Downhole and Core Logging Procedures 

 
Downhole procedures included oriented core readings and radiometric logging. 
Oriented drill core markings were made on the drill core for each drill run using an 
ACE orientating tool. The radiometric logging was conducted using a 2PGA-1000 
Poly-Gamma Probe and a MGX II Logger. The gamma probe was calibrated 
against a set of known standards in test pits located at the Saskatchewan 
Research Council's facilities in Saskatoon. 
 
Data collected from the drill core included geologic descriptions, core recovery, 
rock quality determination (RQD), fracture count, magnetic susceptibility and 
radioactivity using a handheld scintillometer. Oriented drill core measurements, 
recorded using a goniometer, included shearing, foliation, slips, gouge, fractures 
and veins.  
 
Samples were collected for analysis using a portable short-wave infrared mineral 
analyzer (PIMA) for the determination of the spatial distribution of clay minerals. 
The geologist collected PIMA samples where clay alteration was prominent and 
where clay coatings were seen on fracture surfaces within the basement rock. A 2 
to 4 cm long piece of drill core was collected where required and placed in a 
sample bag marked with the hole number and sample depth. All Purepoint PIMA 
samples were forwarded to Ken Wasyliuk, M.Sc., P.Geo. of Northwind Resources, 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan for analysis. 
 
Sampling procedures for samples submitted for analysis using partial and total 
digestion inductively coupled plasma methods, for boron by Na2O2 fusion, and for 
uranium by NHO3/HCl and fluorimetry at the Saskatchewan Research Council 
Geoanalytical Laboratories in Saskatoon are described in detail in Section 10.

9.2 Diamond Drill Hole Results 
 
Diamond drilling to date on the Red Willow project has been conducted on six 
grids that include Osprey, Geneva, Radon, Lasby Lake, Mustang and Long Lake. 
 
 
9.2.1 Osprey Grid Drill Results 
 
The first drill program on the Red Willow project in 2007 targeted the six-kilometer 
long, "S"-shaped Osprey conductor on the Osprey grid (Figure 34). Hole RW-07 of 
that program intersected 0.20% eU3O8 over 5.8 metres at the shallow depth of 70 
metres just north of Osprey Lake. Due to lost core within the mineralized interval of 
RW-07, an eU3O8 is used which is a radiometric equivalent calculated from the 
calibrated natural gamma geophysical log. Since that time, numerous geophysical 
surveys have been conducted over the grid to help target the drilling of this priority 
target. Target areas are discussed separately below and include the area around 
Osprey Lake (location of hole RW-07), Osprey Hinge, Central Osprey, Osprey 
South, Osprey North and Osprey West. 
 
 
Osprey Lake 
 
The area immediately surrounding Osprey Lake has now been tested by 33 holes 
totaling 4,796 metres (Figures 34 and 35). Weakly anomalous uranium 
mineralization at Osprey Lake was intercepted over a 250 metre strike length but 
the RW-07 mineralization remains the highlight intercept to date (Table 4). The 
holes drilled were kept relatively short (average depth of only 160m) in an effort to 
understand the structural controls of the mineralization before attempting more 
costly deeper drilling. The location of Osprey Lake in relation to the mineralization 
has been a hindrance to drilling since angled holes to properly cut the lithology is 
difficult from lake ice and poor ice conditions have prevented drilling even a vertical 
hole on the lake. 
 
Drilling results have shown the Osprey conductor to be a vertical to sub-vertical, 
weak to moderately sheared, dark green to black chlorite altered pyritic graphitic 
pelitic gneiss bounded by moderate to strongly silicified and moderately hematized 
pelitic gneiss (Figure 36). The pyritic/graphitic unit is typically 40 to 60 metres wide, 
hosts 5 to 8% pyrite as fine disseminations, medium to coarse subhedral crystals 
and rare semi-massive bands and trace to 1% fine graphite needles. The most 
significant uranium mineralization discovered to date in the Osprey Lake area is 
confined to a flat tension fracture ("A" zone) but also occurs within steep narrow 
gouges within, and running parallel to, the shear zone. The radioactive "B" gouge 
has been interpreted to have a west-northwest trend while the radioactive "C" 
structure trends north-northwest (Figure 35). The "A" fracture zone has a distinct 
geochemical signature that includes anomalous partial digestion results for As (up 
to 94.1 ppm), Cu (up to 7,660 ppm), Pb (up to 2,280 ppm), and Zn (up to 33,000 
ppm).

The geophysical results of the Osprey Lake area were initially interpreted as showing a 
northwest trending fault crosscutting the Osprey conductor in the vicinity of hole RW-07. 
Subsequent drilling has failed to intercept a significant crosscutting structure but has 
outlined a silicified flexure in the conductor that appears to be reflected in the 3D 
resistivity results. Drill holes RW-21 and 24 both encountered the pyritic graphitic pelitic 
gneiss in the vicinity of the flexure, however, the unit was strongly silicified and devoid 
of any radioactivity effectively separating the vertical mineralized structure into two 
separate zones ("B" and "C"). Two additional holes (RW-38 and 39) were drilled into the 
flexure beneath, and perpendicular to, the RW-21 and 22 holes and intersected strongly 
silicified pelitic gneiss. Based on this evidence, areas of high resistivity are considered 
to reflect siliceous barren lithologies. 
 
Three holes were drilled by Rio Tinto in the area including 12RDW001 that encountered 
barren granitized pelite throughout it length and holes 14RDW013 and 14RDW014 that 
encountered relatively unaltered quartz-rich semi-pelite and psammitic gneiss. 
 
A resistivity section through the Osprey conductor is compared to the Eagle Point 
deposits at a similar scale in Figure 37. The comparison suggests that there is potential 
to discover a large-scale basement hosted uranium deposit in the area.  
 
 
Osprey Hinge 
 
Encouraging results were also returned from the Osprey conductor at a fold hinge 
located approximately 800 metres east-southeast of Osprey Lake and the RW-07 
intercept. A three hole geologic fence totaling 648.1 metres of drilling tested the Hinge 
area and encountered strong clay, hematite and chlorite alteration and a weakly 
radioactive fault zone (Figure 38). 
 
Drill hole RW-28 intersected two intervals of moderately chloritized pyritic-graphitic 
gneiss. A 2 mm wide fracture hosting massive galena was seen cross-cutting foliation 
between the two graphitic units returning 1.0% Pb over 1.0 m between 166.8 and 167.8 
m. Moderately clay altered biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss hosting clay-filled fractures 
was encountered between 191.8 and 204.3m then moderate hematite alteration was 
present to the completion depth of 263.3m. The presence of hematite alteration at a 
depth greater than 250m was considered encouraging and was followed by the second 
hole of the geologic drill fence (RW-29).  
 
Drill hole RW-29 was collared 120m east of RW-28 and did not encounter pyritic or 
graphitic rock. The biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss was moderately clay altered to 56.0m, 
strongly hematite and chlorite altered to 83.7 m, intensely silicified to 96.7 m, then weak 
hematite alteration to the end of hole. Numerous intervals of strongly broken core and 
lost core were encountered throughout the hole. The radioactivity highlight of hole RW-
29 was from a zone of lost core intersected between 74.7 to 76.3m that returned 
downhole gamma results up to 1,892 cps (estimated as an eU value of 250 ppm). The 
anomalous radioactivity is assumed to be related to a vertical fault, named the "Hinge

Fault", which was intersected between 91.0 and 100.7 m and resulted in 7.5 m of lost 
core. The Hinge Fault is associated with strong chlorite / hematite alteration and to the 
east, a zone of intense silicification. 
 
Drill hole RW-41 was collared 40 m behind RW-29 to follow-up the "Hinge Fault" and its 
related alteration and radioactivity. Pyritic-graphitic (pelitic) gneiss was intersected in 
this hole between 68.7 and 90.4 m and displayed moderate, pervasive, dark green 
chlorite alteration. The Hinge Fault was intersected between 171.5 and 178.1 m 
showing strong dark red hematite alteration and having a core loss of 3.2 m. Again, 
intense silicification occurred to the immediate west of the Hinge Fault between 155.0 m 
and 171.5 m and included an interval of moderate hematite alteration between 158.3 
and 161.2 m. A radioactive zone is hosted within the interval of hematite alteration 
returning 358 ppm U over 0.4m from 159.1 to 159.5m  
 
 
Central Osprey  
 
The Central Osprey area includes the northern fold limb between Osprey Lake and the 
Osprey Hinge area and was tested by four holes for a total of 546 metres. Weakly 
elevated uranium mineralization was intersected in all holes and hydrothermal alteration 
was seen as progressively increasing towards the Osprey Hinge area.  
 
Drill hole RW-30 intersected graphitic pyritic pelitic gneiss with weak to moderate 
pervasive chlorite alteration between 70.6 and 110.6m before being completed in strong 
to intensely silicified feldspar-quartz gneiss at a depth of 207.0m. No significant 
radioactivity was encountered. 
 
Drill hole RW-42 was drilled to the north on Linda Lake and required a steep drilling 
angle of -80 degrees because of the lake setup. Pyritic-graphitic (pelitic) gneiss with 
moderate to strong chlorite alteration was intersected from 20.4 to 81.4m and hosted a 
fault zone between 41.3 and 45.2m that was very soft, strongly sheared and had a 2m 
core loss. The fault zone returned 20 ppm U over 1.9m from 41.3 to 43.2m. The highest 
downhole gamma results were returned from the overburden at the bottom of the lake, 
which averaged 2270 cps over 0.4 m from 13.6 to 14.0m. 
 
Drill hole RW-43, drilled 75m west of RW-42 on Linda Lake, failed to explain the 
conductor and was completed at a depth of 108m. No significant radioactivity was 
encountered. 
 
Drill hole RW-44 was then drilled 35m behind RW-43 on Linda Lake in a second attempt 
to explain the conductor in this area. Pyritic-graphitic gneiss with strong pervasive 
chlorite alteration was intersected between 30.1 and 76.4 metres. Biotite-feldspar-quartz 
gneiss with moderate to strong pervasive silicification overprinting weak to moderate 
patchy dark red hematite alteration was then present to end of the hole at 117.0m. No 
significant radioactivity was encountered. 
  



 

 81 

Osprey South 
 
The Osprey South area covers the southern fold limb of the Osprey conductor which is 
approximately 1.0 kilometers in length. Within this area the conductor is associated with 
a narrow resistivity low that lies within rocks returning both gravity high and magnetic 
high responses. Three holes were drilled in the area by Purepoint during their 2010 
program and two additional holes were drilled by Rio Tinto in 2012 for a total of 1,520 
metres of drilling. 
 
Drill hole RW-25 was collared outside of the gravity high and magnetic high to allow 
determination of the lithology and/or alteration responsible for this geophysical 
response. A minor amount (2.7m) of Athabasca Sandstone was intersected before 
encountering basement rock that was approximately 65% biotite-feldspar-quartz (pelitic) 
gneiss and 35% pegmatite / granitic gneiss to a depth of 265.5m. Unaltered pyritic-
graphitic (pelitic) gneiss was encountered from 265.5m to the end of hole at 285.0m. 
  
Drill hole RW-26 was collared 100m in front of RW-25 and intersected Athabasca 
sandstone over 5.2m. Weakly chlorite altered, locally graphitic, pyrite-biotite-feldspar-
quartz (pelitic) gneiss was intersected between 67.3m and 99.1m and the hole was 
completed within weakly chlorite altered magnetite-pyrrhotite-biotite-feldspar-quartz 
gneiss at a depth of 141.0m.  
 
Drill hole RW-27 did not encounter Athabasca sandstone before intersecting pelitic 
gneiss at 136.5m followed by pyritic pelitic gneiss with minor graphite and moderate 
chlorite alteration to 165.7m. Biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss having weak to moderate 
silicification was then encountered to the hole's completion depth of 327.7m. No 
anomalous radioactivity and only minor structures and minor intervals of pegmatite were 
intersected.  
 
Based on the 2010 drilling, the gravity high and magnetic high in the Osprey South area 
is considered to be related to the magnetite/pyrrhotite-rich gneiss encountered at the 
bottom of RW-26. The overall resistivity response of the area is quite high compared to 
other areas along the Osprey conductor and is thought to be related to a high 
percentage of pegmatites, granitic gneisses and "granitized" (i.e. silicified) pelites such 
as encountered by holes 25 and 27 as well as historic holes OS-16 to 19 and Turk-6 
(Figure 34). 
 
Drill hole 12RDW002 targeted the Osprey conductor and did not encounter sandstone 
before intersecting zones of sericite and hematite alteration and a weakly radioactive 
fault zone within graphitic pyritic pelitic gneiss that returned 58 ppm U over 2.0 metres. 
A talc/serpentine altered calc-silicate unit was encountered by the hole before being 
completed at 401m. 
 
Drill hole 12RDW004 targeted a resistivity low and encountered 21m of sandstone with 
illitic alteration before intersecting the unconformity that was associated with hematite 
and clay alteration. The unconformity returned up to 9 ppm U while the basement rocks, 



 

 82 

which contained two wide zones of sericite, hematite and chlorite alteration, returned up 
to 11 ppm U. Weakly graphitic and pyritic pelitic gneiss was then encountered before 
the hole was completed at 365m. The 3D resistivity data for this area suggests the hole 
may have stopped short of testing a sandstone LARC that was associated with a fault 
zone (hole OS-14) and alteration (hole OS-15) approximately 150 metres to the south 
(Figure 39).  
 
 
Osprey North  
 
Two holes, RW-31 and 32, targeted the Osprey conductor north of the previous drilling 
where the conductor has a north-south trend. The two holes totaled 375 metres of 
drilling and did not intersect anomalous radioactivity.  
 
Drill hole RW-31 was drilled towards the south-west at -65 degrees however, the rocks 
were not dipping as steeply in this area as previously experienced resulting in the hole 
being essentially drilled down-dip and the conductor not being explained.  
 
Drill hole RW-32 encountered a wide zone of moderately chloritized pyritic-graphitic 
pelite. Unlike holes in the Osprey Lake area, the graphite in RW-32 was present as 
semi-massive bands as well as fine disseminations.  
 
 
Osprey West 
 
Drill holes RW-01 and RW-02 targeted a break on the West Zone conductor located 100 
metres from the Wolly property, an Areva/Denison joint venture. These holes 
intersected bleached sandstone before reaching the unconformity at a depth of 
approximately 30 metres. Graphitic pelites and favourable structures were encountered, 
however, neither hole intersected anomalous radioactivity.  
 
 
9.2.2 Geneva Drill Results 
 
Seven drill holes were completed at the Geneva area by Rio Tinto between 2012 and 
2014 (Figure 40) and a summary of anomalous uranium intercepts is provided in Table 
5. 
 
Drill hole GEN11-01 tested a 900 metre long EM conductor located within the centre of 
the Geneva grid where it appeared to be structurally offset. The EM target also 
coincided with a LARC in the sandstone interpreted as a possible zone of hydrothermal 
alteration. The hole encountered Athabasca sandstone to a depth of 113.0m and 
displayed moderate to strong clay alteration between 82.4 and 107.8m that correlates 
with the resistivity low (Figure 24). Biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss was moderately 
chlorite altered due to paleoweathering to a depth of 169.7m then was silicified with 
trace graphite and pyrite to the completion depth of 255.0m. No anomalous radioactivity 
was intersected by this hole.

Drill hole GEN11-02 was collared 45m south of GEN11-01 and was designed to test an 
interpreted structure beneath a small lake. Athabasca sandstone displaying moderate 
clay alteration was encountered between 102.0 to 109.1.m before a 2.7 metre fault 
zone, containing semi-massive clay, chloritic fragments and evidence of shearing, was 
intersected immediately above the unconformity at 111.8m. Another five fault zones, 1.1 
to 5.2m in width, were then intersected with biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss to a depth of 
178.7m. The biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss then displayed patchy hydrothermal hematite 
alteration to 222.5m before becoming silicified with localized concentrations of graphite 
and pyrite to the completion depth of 336.0m. The alteration zone encountered by 
GEN11-01 within the sandstone correlated with the resistivity low anomaly and GEN11-
02 intersected significant structures in the basement rocks as were interpreted. The 
presence of pyrrhotite in the bottom of both holes may help explain the presence of the 
gravity high anomaly in this area (Figure 27). 
 
Drill hole 12RDW003 targeted a gravity low that was coincident with a VTEM conductor 
within a magnetic high. The hole did not intersect Athabasca sandstone before 
encountering hematite and magnetite rich granite to the hole's completion depth of 
302.0m. The VTEM conductor was not explained by the hole and the gravity low 
signature is now considered to be an overburden response. The presence of granitic 
rock in this hole is supported by the high gradient resistivity response (Figure 27) and 
the high magnetic response (Figure 40). 
 
Drill hole 14RDW008 was to follow-up the on-strike potential of mineralization and 
alteration encountered historically. Athabasca sandstone with local desilicified intervals 
was encountered between 7.3 to the unconformity at 78.5m. From the unconformity a 
pelitic gneiss was encountered between 78.5 and 90.0m. The pelite gneiss is strongly 
altered to clay and chlorite obliterating most of the fabric. The VTEM conductor is 
considered to be 4.7m of sheared graphitic pelitic gneiss that was encountered from 
90.0 to 94.7m. The pelitic gneiss continues to 199.2m where granitic gneiss extents until 
the end of hole.  
 



 

 86 

Results show two main zones of radioactivity. One zone is associated with the 
conductor and the other is related with the contact between pelite gneiss and granitic 
units. The radioactive peak of 1561 cps occurs at a depth of 89.2m and corresponds 
with an assay of 0.68% U3O8 over 0.3m from 89.1 to 89.4m related to the graphitic 
shear (Figure 41). 
 
Drill hole 14RDW009 was a 70m step-back west to test the down-dip potential of 
basement mineralization found in 14RDW008. Athabasca sandstone begins at 3.7m 
and continues to 83.1m where the first basement is encountered. Pelitic gneiss began 
at the unconformity until the VTEM conductor, a graphitic gneiss is intersected from 
177.8 to 182.0m. After the graphitic interval the hole returns to pelitic gneiss until 
293.1m where granitic gneiss is intersected and continued until the end of hole.  
 
There is a radioactive peak of 978 cps that corresponds with an assay of 322 ppm U 
over 1.0 m from 193.0 to 194.0m which is associated a brittle shear zone. This slightly 
radioactive graphitic pelitic gneiss is metal enriched (116 ppm Zn, 72 ppm V, 298 ppm 
Cu, 72 ppm Ni) confirming the presence of a fluid pathway that is interpreted to be 
connected to 14RDW008. 
 
Drill hole 14RDW010 stepped 40 m in front of 14RDW008 to test for the up-dip 
extension of the mineralization and alteration in the sandstone. Bleached Athabasca 
sandstone is encountered from 6.4 to 81.7m when the unconformity is encountered. 
Pelitic gneiss begins at the unconformity to 150.1m when a granitic gneiss is 
encountered until the end of hole. There was no mineralization encountered in the 
sandstone. Only a small radioactive peak of 2637 cps was intersected near the 
pelite/granite contact.  
 
Drill hole 14RDW012 stepped 270m to the south targeting on-strike mineralization and 
an interpreted cross-cutting E-W structure at the unconformity. Bleached Athabasca 
sandstone is encountered from 5.3 to 130.7m where the unconformity is intersected. 
After the unconformity a paleo-weathering zone of moderate clay and hematite altered 
pelitic gneiss is encountered until 156m. The pelite continues until granitic gneiss is 
intersected at 221.1m that continues until the end of hole. 
 
The EM conductor was not intersected explained by hole 14RDW012, however, based 
on the location of the VTEM conductor pick in relationship to the intersected graphitic 
unit for the section showing holes 14RDW008, 9 and 10, it is considered that the hole 
overshot its intended target. 
 
 
9.2.3 Mustang Drill Results 
 
The 2014 drilling program on the Mustang conductor systematically drilled a three hole 
fence targeting historically logged "hydrothermal" alteration that was previously logged 
as 'plastic, deformable clay' in basement rocks.

The 2006 VTEM survey shows a sub vertical dipping, weak conductor in the 
channel 6, and a negative "IP response" seen in channel 4 of the survey. The 
negative "IP response" was attributed to either near-surface weathering or a 
possible clay-rich zone.  
 
The three drill holes were completed in a staggered fence across the south end of 
the conductor and along the same transect as the previous holes (OS-20 and -21) 
(Fig. 42). The three hole fence confirmed a near surface 50m thick zone of weak to 
very strong clay alteration, dominantly consisting of phengitic-illite clays, 
montmorillonite clay, and hematite in pelitic and granitic rocks. A narrow, sub-
horizontal uranophane-filled fracture was intercepted in 14RDW005 below the clay 
alteration envelope (89 m) and returned 639 ppm uranium over 30 cm from 88.9 to 
89.32 metres. Graphite was only encountered in hole 14RDW005 and appeared as 
trace amounts within the last 3 metres of the hole. Follow-up hole 14RDW006 
encountered unmineralized granite beneath 2 meters of sandstone which implies 
that the start of bedrock in the drill holes in the Mustang Area are proximal to the 
unconformity. 
 
Drill hole 14RDW007 was drilled 60m NW of 14RDW005 to follow up the 
anomalous radioactivity. No Athabasca sandstone was encountered before 
intersecting semi-pelitic gneiss at 12.9m. The semi-pelitic gneiss continues until 
148.2m where it transitions to pelitic gneiss until the end of hole (Figure 43). No 
significant structure, alteration or radioactivity was encountered within the hole.  
 
The near surface alteration halo is depleted in Cu, Mo and Bi and is elevated in B. 
The alteration package is not depleted in other pathfinder metals (Co, Ni, As, Zn). 
The observed pattern of trace metal depletion and elevated boron also occurs at 
and below the unconformity in several other holes across the property, suggesting 
the clay alteration intercepted at Mustang represents paleo-weathering rather than 
hydrothermal alteration. 
 
 
9.2.4 Radon Lake Drill Results 
 
The drilling program at Radon Lake systematically explored the VTEM conductor 
southwest of the lake with 13 drill holes for a total of 2,726 metres. The drill hole 
locations are provided with a geologic interpretation in Figure 44 and a summary of 
anomalous uranium intercepts are provided in Table 6.  
 
The rocks were interpreted to be dipping steeply towards the west at 
approximately 70 degrees. Holes testing the VTEM conductor were typically drilled 
to a depth where they encountered strongly silicified pelitic gneiss before being 
stopped. The interpreted contact of the silicification matches well with the gradient 
IP resistivity high seen in Figure 24. The K-spar rich quartzite logged towards the 
west does not appear to be readily apparent in any of the geophysical results. 
Graphitic pyritic pelitic gneiss explained the conductor was encountered six of the

holes (RAD08-01, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 13) while RAD08-09 encountered a pyritic 
mineralization not associated with graphite. Favourable brick red hematite alteration and 
strong bleaching was encountered near the unconformity in holes RAD08-04 and 09.  
 
The mineralization highlight was from hole RAD08-09 with sandstone at the 
unconformity returning 283 ppm U over 1.1 metres between 106.1 and 107.2 metres. 
The nearby hole RAD08-05 (located 300m NW) returned 189 ppm U over 0.3 metres 
between 117.7 and 118.0 metres also in sandstone just above the unconformity. Hole 
RAD-10 was drilled between RAD-09 and 05 and encountered zones of lost core and 
strong faulting throughout its length. 
 
 
9.2.5 Lasby Lake Drill Results 
 
In 2014 Rio Tinto conducted a one hole drill program on the Lasby Lake grid. The drill 
hole was designed to test alteration along strike (50m) of two historical holes (RAD-85-
33 & 34) that intersected a thick graphitic unit associated with clay alteration interpreted 
as being hydrothermal in origin. 
 
Drill hole 14RDW011 (Figure 40) first reached Athabasca sandstone from 5.4 to 82.4m 
when the unconformity was encountered. From the unconformity psammitic gneiss with 
moderate clay alteration continued until 176.5m when chlorite altered quartz-rich semi-
pelitic gneiss is intersected. From 207 to 207.9m a massive graphitic fault zone is 
intersected which can be considered the VTEM conductor. Between 220.9 and 221.4 
meters, an assay of 396 ppm U over 0.5 metres was returned from a dark grey, quartz 
flooded interval. The core returns to quartz-rich semi-pelitic gneiss to 222.5m and then 
transitions to a psammite to the end of hole.

9.2.6 Long Lake and 333 Grid Drill Results 
 
The Long Lake / 333 grid area was drilled by Purepoint in 2008 with seven holes 
totaling 1,623 meters. The work done on the Long Lake area was a "first pass' program 
designed to test multiple targets at different localities.  
 
Two of three EM conductors drill-tested in the Long Lake area are now known to reflect 
altered, graphitic rocks. These two target areas represent 8.7 kilometers of prospective 
EM conductors (Figure 45). A summary of the anomalous radioactivity intersected 
during the Long Lake are drilling is provided in Table 7. 
 
Four holes, LL08-01 to 04, tested the 4.5 kilometer electromagnetic (EM) conductor 
that partially runs beneath Long Lake. Three of the four holes intersected graphitic rocks 
that explained the conductor and all holes encountered strong silicification and/or strong 
chlorite alteration associated with fault zones.  
 
Significant radioactivity was not encountered during the Long Lake drilling and the 
source of the historic Long Lake boulder train, located due north of Long Lake, remains 
unknown. Less than a kilometer of the 4.5 km Long Lake conductor was drill-tested, and 
it is now thought that the source of the radioactive boulders remains further up-ice from 
the recent drill program.  
 
One hole, LL08-05, tested the 1.0 kilometer EM conductor that partially runs beneath 
Riche Lake (located 500 m west of Long Lake). LL08-05 encountered a 1.6 metre 
radioactive fault zone with the downhole gamma probe returning 269 ppm U over 0.5 
metres from 40.6 to 41.1 metres. Prospecting by Purepoint during the summer of 2006 
discovered two radioactive boulders approximately 200 metres due south of Riche lake 
that returned uranium values up to 1.30% U3O8.  
 
Two holes, LL08-06 and 07, were drilled along the 4.2 kilometer Lyon Lake EM 
conductor. Both holes encountered graphitic rocks associated with strongly chloritic fault 
zones and strong silicification. LL08-06 did not intersect anomalous radioactivity but the 
second hole in the conductor, LL08-07, intersected three distinct radioactive zones. The 
LL08-07 zones of radioactivity were associated with small chloritic gouges (<20 cm) at 
31.1m and 33.2m that returned 611ppm U over 0.1m and 237ppm U over 0.2m, 
respectively.

9.2.7 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
The current drilling in the area of Osprey Lake has shown that the RW-07 uranium 
mineralization is a flat-lying zone associated with a steep weakly radioactive chloritic 
gouge structure. The area is open at depth for further stacked lenses of mineralization 
parallel to the RW-07 mineralization. Favourable pelitic rocks are thought to be located 
west of the Osprey conductor that may also host mineralization within vertical structures 
and as sub-horizontal stacked lenses. 
 
The fold hinge of the Osprey conductor is considered to require further drilling after a 
fence of three holes intersected a vertical, weakly radioactive fault zone (Hinge Fault) 
associated with strong chlorite and hematite alteration. Alteration of the basement rocks 
within drill holes located along the northern limb is seen as increasing towards the fold 
nose where one of the holes, RW-28, encountered the strongest clay alteration seen on 
the property to date. The strike of the Hinge Fault is currently unknown and untested. 
Where the fault intersects the central portion of the Osprey Conductor is considered to 
represent an important uranium exploration target. 
 
Geneva intersected elevated uranium levels in the 2014 drilling program, mainly in drill 
hole 14RDW008, and the associated structure was followed to depth in 14RDW009. 
The structures hosting anomalous uranium concentrations need to be followed up along 
strike and at depth. Geophysical data shows that excellent exploration targets remain 
within Geneva, namely the eastern terminus of two short VTEM conductors and the 
area proximal to RAD-27 and 14RDW008. The short VTEM conductors coincide with 
low apparent resistivity chimneys in the sandstone and may represent zones of 
hydrothermal alteration and should be tested.  
 
Drilling in the Radon Lake did not discover the source of the historic radon-in-water 
anomaly but did encounter anomalous sandstone geochemistry in hole RAD08-09 that 
returned uranium values ranging from 46 to 656 ppm. A significant structure was 
intersected by RAD08-10 (140 metres east of RW-09) and may be associated with the 
anomalous radioactivity making the area still attractive for follow-up. 
 
First pass drilling within the Mustang area intersected a weakly anomalous uranophane 
fracture in drill hole 14RDW005, however, the radioactive fracture was not intersected in 
the two follow-up holes. Strong, clay alteration was encountered in the paleo-weathering 
zone in hole 14RDW005 and 14RDW007. The Mustang EM conductor remains an 
exploration target since the most recent holes only tested the weakly conductive south 
end of the main conductor.  
 
Lasby Lake drill hole 14RDW011 intersected a small radioactive interval of 369 ppm U 
over 0.5m below the conductor. Only 3 drill holes have been drilled into the 3.5km 
Lasby Lake EM conductor and is considered to still be an exploration target.  
 
First pass drilling within the Long Lake area intersected a 1.6 metre radioactive 
structure in LL08-05 (including 269 ppm U over 0.5 m) and two narrow mineralized 



 

 96 

structures in LL08-07 (611 ppm U and 237 ppm U over 0.1 and 0.2 m, respectively). 
Two of three eastern electromagnetic conductors drill-tested in 2008 at Long Lake are 
now known to reflect altered, graphitic rocks. Over 7 kilometers of favourable EM 
conductors remain to be drill tested in the Long Lake area. 
 
 
10. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
10.1 Sample Preparation 
 
The sample preparation on site is limited to splitting the core. All other sample 
preparation is performed by the independent laboratory, SRC. The core splitting is done 
under the supervision of the site geologist by the company's geological technician. 
 
Diamond drill core was placed in core boxes and transported to the core logging 
building at the temporary work camp by the drilling company. The project geologists log 
the core for lithologic characteristics and the geological technicians log the core for core 
recovery, rock quality determination (RQD), fracture count, magnetic susceptibility and 
radioactivity. 
 
Samples of drill core are typically chosen for analysis based on the radioactivity 
recorded by the geological technician using a handheld scintillometer. Additional 
"shoulder" samples are also taken above and below the radioactive zone. Also, non-
radioactive structures, alteration and lithologies were sampled to possibly identify 
processes related to the mineral deposit model and background geological and 
geochemical processes. Attempts were made by the geologist to avoid having more 
than one lithology in any given sample. 
  
Samples were collected by both a composite method (only for sandstone) and by 
splitting. For composite samples of sandstone, the geologist collects a 2 to 4 cm long 
piece of core every metre and places these in a marked plastic sample bag along with a 
sample number tag from the sample ticket book. The geologist records the sample 
intervals within the sample ticket book, and then staples a sample number tag from the 
sample ticket book to the core box where the interval begins. 
 
For core to be sampled by splitting, the geologist marks the sample intervals on the 
core, records sample intervals within the sample ticket book, then staples sample 
number tags from the sample ticket book to the core box where the interval begins.  
 
After the core has been marked for sampling, it is photographed both wet and dry. The 
core requiring splitting is then is split lengthwise using a mechanical knife-type core 
splitting tool and every attempt was made to ensure an even split. Intervals of poorly 
lithified core (i.e. clay altered) were split using stainless steel kitchen utensils. One half 
of the core is placed in plastic sample bags pre-marked with the sample number along 
with a sample number tag from the sample ticket book. The other half is returned to the 
core box and stored at the core storage area located near the Cunning Bay camp for 



 

 97 

the Long Lake holes and near the Osprey Lake camp for the remaining holes. The core 
splitter and sample collection pans are cleaned thoroughly with a brush before the next 
sample is split. The bags containing split samples are then placed in buckets with lids 
for transport to Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 
 
The Red Willow database contains 271 composite samples of the Athabasca 
sediments, typically 10 metres in length, which were collected and analyzed. The 
database contains the results of ICP analysis from 1542 split samples and the length of 
these samples, which range from 0.04 to 3.0 metres, is considered appropriate for the 
current stage of exploration. Recovery is not believed to be a factor that could materially 
impact the accuracy and reliability of the results since sample intervals are broken 
where the core has been lost. A total of 158 samples were collected for PIMA analysis. 
 
10.2 Sample Analysis 

 
The SRC facility in Saskatoon crushes each sample to 60% -10 mesh and then riffle 
split to a 200g sample with the remainder retained as coarse reject. The 200 g sample 
is then ground to 90% -140 mesh. Replicates are chosen at random and an additional 
200 g sample is riffle split and ground to 90% -140 mesh. For total digestion analysis, a 
0.125 g pulp is gently heated in a mixture of ultrapure HF/HNO3/HClO4 until dry and the 
residue dissolved in dilute ultrapure HNO3. For the partial digestion analysis, a 0.500 g 
pulp is digested with 2.25 ml of 8:1 ultrapure HNO3/HCl for 1 hour at 95 C. The solutions 
are then analyzed by ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) analysis. For boron, a 0.1 g 
pulp is fused at 650 C in a mixture of Na2O2/Na2CO3. 
 
The SRC facility is licensed by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) to 
receive, process, and archive radioactive samples. The facility is ISO/IEC 17025:2005 
accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (scope of accreditation #537) and also 
participates in regular interlaboratory tests for many of their package elements. 
 
10.3 Sample Security 

 
Core samples are transported to the SRC laboratory by Purepoint employees. Results 
from the analyses are transmitted by email directly to Purepoint's exploration office in 
Saskatoon and the signed paper assay certificates are mailed. 
 
 
11.  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
Data verification utilized at Red Willow includes internal SRC laboratory quality 
assurance and quality control (QA/QC), comparison of results of the duplicate samples 
and variance of standard samples.  
 
11.1 QA/QC 

 



 

 98 

The SRC Geoanalytical Laboratory uses a Laboratory Management System (LMS) for 
Quality Assurance. The Quality Control measures applied to all methods within the 
laboratory include insertion of analytical blacks, replicates and certified rock standards 
which are systematically inserted in each group of samples and results reported (SRC, 
2007). Laboratory Quality Control results applied are checked and if results are found to 
be outside Quality Control Limits actions are taken to ensure that the samples are 
reprocessed within the quality limits.  
 
The drilling database is compiled directly from Excel spreadsheets sent from SRC to 
Purepoint's Saskatoon office, thus eliminating the errors associated with manual data 
input. The results from individual Excel spreadsheets received for each certificate is 
then moved into a single Access database. Values below the detection limit are given a 
value that is one-half of the detection limits. Results provided in the PDF versions of the 
assay certificates that are received from SRC by email were randomly checked against 
the values in the Access database by the author at the end of all drill programs. All 
anomalous intercepts used in this report were recalculated using original Excel assay 
datasheets from SRC and compared to previous weighted average calculations. 
 
 
11.2 Comparison of Analytical Techniques 
 
The SRC laboratory ran multiple different standards during sample analyses. The 
results for each standard were averaged for the 16 elements of interest, namely Al2O3, 
K2O, CaO, Na2O, MgO, Fe2O3, B, U, As, Bi, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb and V, and plotted 
against the average to visually show the variance at the end of each program. 
 
Comparisons of six analytical methods that have occurred on Red Willow are presented 
as scatter plots in Figure 46. The methods include ICP1-OES_DL, ICP1-OES_DL_2, 
ICP-MS/OES_High CR, ICP-MS/OES_Low CR and two historical methods with details 
included in Table 8. While the specifics of the analytical method used for Hist_Method_2 
(green category) are not known, the method produces comparable analyses to the 
current methods (light blue for sandstone and orange for basement samples) with better 
precision at low U levels and lower detection limits for U. Historic analyses in 
Hist_Method_2 category have no response for U or Ni (brown dots on the probability 
plots in Figure 26). Hist_Method_2 produces unacceptably high detection limits and 
therefore, these samples have been treated as "not analysed."  
 
 
12.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Some occurrences of unconformity-type uranium showings surround the Red Willow 
claims (Figure 47). The Midwest Mine, owned by COGEMA Resources Inc. (69.16%), 
Denison Mines Ltd. (25.17%), and OURD (Canada) Co. Ltd. (5.6%), is located 28 km 
southwest of the Red Willow claims. It has 35 million pounds of U3O8 with an average

and is currently beginning production out of their Eagle Point Uranium deposit, located 
14 km south of the Red Willow claims, which has estimated reserves of approximately 
24.0 million pounds of U3O8 (Cameco website). The Rabbit Lake open pit, Collins Bay 
A–, B– and D–zones as well as Eagle Point underground mine, located 18 km south of 
the Red Willow claims, have been mined out with a total production of 186.3 million 
pounds of U3O8. 
 
Areva Resources Canada Inc. currently holds three mineral permits contiguous with the 
south-western property boundary of Red Willow property and were staked in 1974. The 
McClean Lake mine is located 20 km southwest of the Red Willow claims and is owned 
by Areva Resouces Canada Inc. (70%), Denson Energy Inc. (22.5%) and OURD 
Canada Co.Ltd. (7.5%). Open pit mining at McClean Lake began with the JEB orebody 
in 1995 and was followed by mining of the Sue C, A, E and B orebodies. To date almost 
50 million pounds of U3O8 have been produced at McClean Lake. (Areva website). 
Exploration drilling by Areva and Denison has produced mineralized intercepts close to 
the Red Willow property boundary including Moonlight (2.1% U3O8 over 1.5 m), Lasoy 
(0.23% eU3O8 over 2.0 m), Burnt Island (0.38% eU3O8 over 2.0 m within basement 
rocks) and Tooth Lake (0.22% eU3O8 over 0.1m).  
 
The west border of Red Willow is adjacent to Denison Mines' Turkey Lake property. 
Thirteen diamond drill holes were drilled into the conductor with holes returning 0.065% 
and 0.16% U3O8. 
 
UEX Corporation's Hidden Bay project is contiguous with the southern boundary of Red 
Willow. The Hidden Bay property is: 57,321 hectares in size (42 claims) and hosts three 
uranium deposits, Horseshoe, Raven, and West Bear, all located southwest of the 
Rabbit Lake mine. 
 
Denison Mines owns 58.3% and Eros Resources Corp. (previously Anthem Resources) 
owns 41.7% of their Hatchet Lake property that is comprised of 11 claims (33,930 
hectares) that is contiguous with the northwest side of the Red Willow property. The 
Smith Bay conductor appears to be the eastern terminus of the Crooked-Richardson 
Lakes conductive belt that is currently being explored by the Denison Mines/ Anthem 
Resources Joint Venture. During a 2013 drill program along the Crooked-Richardson 
Lakes trend, uranium mineralization was intersected in two drill holes. The highlight 
assay result was in drill hole RL-13-16, which intersected 0.45% U3O8 over 2.3 metres 
beginning at 124.0 metres down the drill hole. (Anthem Press Release, April 24, 2013).  
 
The Collins Bay Extension project is held by Nu Nova Energy purchased through 
Baywater on June 12, 2015. The property covers 38,672 hectares in 14 mineral claims 
contiguous to southeast side of Red Willow property.  
 
There are multiple small claims staked adjacent to the north edge of the Red Willow 
property. Two of the claims are held by individuals and two claims are held by KALT 



 

 103 

Industries. To the northeast of Red Willow, Kivalliq Energy Corp. owns 6 claims totalling 
13, 741 hectares.  

 
 
13.  INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The 6-kilometer long "S"-shaped Osprey conductor, host to significant uranium 
intercepts, has excellent exploration potential at depth below the known mineralized 
zone and towards the west. The main mineralized zone has only been drill tested at 
shallow depths (average hole length < 160 metres) and is open at depth for further 
stacked, parallel lenses of mineralization. Based on the resistivity results, favourable 
pelitic rocks are located west of the Osprey conductor that may also host mineralization 
within sub-vertical structures and as sub-horizontal stacked lenses. 
 
The fold hinge of the Osprey conductor is considered to require further drilling after a 
fence of three holes drilled in 2008 intersected a vertical, weakly radioactive fault zone 
(Hinge Fault) associated with strong chlorite and hematite alteration. Alteration of the 
basement rocks increases along the northern fold limb towards the fold nose where one 
of the three holes drilled, RW-28, encountered very strong clay alteration. 
 
The Geneva area has a compelling target area based on recently completed ground 
geophysics and drilling. A Pole-dipole array IP survey by Purepoint in 2007 outlined low 
apparent resistivity "chimneys" (LARCs) in the sandstone that coincided with the 
termination of two VTEM conductors in the basement rocks. LARCs within the 
sandstone may represent "chimneys" of hydrothermal alteration associated with 
structures that control uranium mineralization at depth. The two LARCs were also seen 
to correspond with two subtle gravity depressions identified by a limited gravity survey in 
2007. A gravity survey by Rio Tinto in 2012 supported the presence of the two gravity 
anomalies and extended the gravity depressions to where Eldorado Resources Ltd 
intersected very strong basement alteration and 0.22% U3O8 over 1.0 metres within a 
graphitic fault zone (hole RAD-27). A 3-hole fence was drilled just north of RAD-27 and 
intersected uranium mineralization in hole 14RDW008 that was related to the graphitic 
shear returning 0.68% U3O8 over 0.3 metres between 89.1 to 89.4m. The Geneva 
conductor has been shown from drilling to be dark green to black chlorite altered pyritic 
graphitic pelitic gneiss that is approximately 5 metres thick, steeply dipping, and weak to 
moderately sheared. 
 
Immediately east of the Geneva area are VTEM conductors with a relatively short strike 
length that are considered to be priority exploration targets. The prospective target area 
containing the conductors is roughly outlined by three points: the 14RDW008 
mineralization,: to the northeast where high concentrations of radon (a product of the 
decay of uranium) were first detected in Radon Lake in 1971, and to the southeast 
where hole RAD08-09 returned 283 ppm U over 1.1 metres from sandstone just above 
the unconformity. The offset conductors are suggestive of structural complexity within 
the area and they appear to be bounded by bands of granitic rocks (magnetic highs). 
The highly competent granitic rocks would provide a contrast in competency favourable 
for zones of dilatancy and mineral deposition. Additionally, the presence of swamp in 



 

 104 

the area may be due to slumping of the underlying sandstone following hydrothermal 
alteration.  
 
Drilling in the Radon Lake area encountered anomalous sandstone geochemistry in 
hole RAD08-09 and intersected a significant structure in RAD08-10 (140 metres east of 
RW-09). The Radon Lake Grid maybe an extension of Areva's Burnt Island showing 
making the area still attractive for follow-up. 
 
The Topping Island area was explored during the early 1980's after a pitchstone cobble 
was discovered down-ice of the arcuate shaped EM conductor. Purepoint flew a 
VTEMplus over Topping Island in two different directions using a close line spacing of 
125 metres to provide detail of the arcuate, 6-kilometer long, EM anomaly. The survey 
outlined numerous lateral displacements in the conductor that can be confidently 
interpreted as faults, representing high priority drill targets. The Topping Island 
conductor is the eastern terminus of the Crooked-Richardson Lakes conductive belt that 
is currently being explored by the Denison Mines/ Eros Resources Joint Venture that 
intersected mineralization in drill hole RL-13-16 returning 0.45% U3O8 over 2.3 metres.  
 
The 333 area has been prepared for initial drill testing by 3D resistivity and gradient 
array IP surveys. The 333 area is named after a historic overburden drill hole (hole 
#333) that intersected values up to 0.31% U3O8 in glacial till. Based on the recent 
geophysical results, the source of the anomalous till may be a recently outlined EM 
conductor that lies only 200 metres northeast of drill hole #333. The strong conductor 
trends north-south, is 1.1 kilometers in length and, based on the geophysical results, is 
intersected by a northeast trending fault.  
 
At Dancing Lake, favourable EM conductors have now been covered by a gradient 
array IP survey and pole-dipole array IP and are considered drill ready. Follow-up 
drilling is also warranted within the Long Lake area where hole LL08-05 intersected a 
1.6 metre wide radioactive structure within hematite altered pelitic gneiss returning 269 
ppm U over 0.5 metres. The area is host to the historic Long Lake Boulder Train 
discovered in 1975 by Gulf Minerals. The northeast trending boulder train was found to 
be 2 km long, 300 to 400 meters wide and contained a number of radioactive biotite 
schist boulders with the highlight being 0.80% U3O8. 
 
The Golden Eye Shear Zone is located in the northern portion of the claim group and 
joins two historic uranium occurrences, the FDL and AJ showings. At the FDL showing, 
uranium mineralization (1.43% U3O8.grab sample) is associated with the 1 metre wide, 
northeast trending Golden Eye shear zone that crosscuts an outcrop of graphitic biotite-
rich pelitic gneiss. The AJ showing is a radioactive molybdenite-garnet-biotite schist 
subcrop that returned an assay of 0.46% U3O8. Historic data indicates the Golden Eye 
Shear hosts favourable mineralization and is a priority target.  
 
Additional EM targets that are considered worthy of ground geophysics include the 
Ghost Lake and Horse Lake conductors. Follow-up work is also warranted at the Cross 
Lake and CBA areas. Cross Lake is a structurally complex area located near the historic 



 

 105 

Scrimes Lake uranium showings that returned anomalous soil geochemistry during 
1972 by Gulf Minerals. Within the CBA area, located at a the fold nose of a granitic 
dome, the last hole of a twenty hole program (CBA-20) intersected anomalous uranium, 
0.17% U3O8 over 0.8m, within a pegmatite dyke before being lost at a depth of 20m. 
 
The Turkey North conductor is considered to be the northern extension of the Turkey 
conductor where historic drilling has returned intercepts of up to 0.16% U3O8 over 1.0 
meter. The conductor has a strike length of over 5 kilometers and has not been drill 
tested. A primary target area is an interpreted structural break with a related offset of 
approximately 250 meters. 
 
 
14.  RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
Based on the uranium mineralization discovered to date on the Red Willow property and 
its favorable geologic setting, further exploration is warranted. A multi-staged 
exploration program and budget is recommended (Table 10).  
 
 
Stage 1: Fall 2016 and Winter 2016/2017:  
 
Drill testing of the geophysical targets previously identified within the Osprey, Geneva, 
333 and Dancing Lake areas. Fourteen diamond drill holes for a total of 5,600 meters 
are recommended. 
 
Stage 2 is not contingent on positive results from Stage 1. 
 
Stage 2: Summer 2017 and Winter 2017 / 2018:  
 
Ground DC resistivity and gravity surveying should be conducted over the Osprey 
Hinge, Topping Island, Golden Eye, Ghost Lake and Horse Lake conductors. 
Linecutting will be required at all target areas with the exception of the Horse Lake grid 
where the existing grid will need refurbishing.  
 
Follow-up of favourable Stage 1 drill program results and drill testing of the high priority 
geophysical targets. A sixteen hole, 6,400 meter drill program is recommended.
