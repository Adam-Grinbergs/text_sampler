Summary 1-1 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.1 SUMMARY 

The Passendro Project area is located in the Ouaka province of the Central African Republic 
(CAR), some 440km by road from the capital city of Bangui and 60 km north of the local 
principal town of Bambari. 

Exploration work undertaken by Asquith Resources Inc and AXMIN Inc since 1996 has 
progressively resulted in an increase in the resource base to the point where a pre-feasibility 
study was performed by GBM in 2006 to assess the economic viability of a potential 
operation there. Since the results of this pre-feasibility study proved to be favourable, a full 
bankable feasibility study was commissioned to follow. This report represents that study. 

The continued exploration which has added to the resource base as well as the continued 
feasibility investigations have led to a better understanding and definition of the project. The 
improving gold price, a greater understanding of the pit slopes and inherent risks involved, as 
well as improved metallurgical operating parameters through a thorough assessment of the 
comminution characteristics and reagent consumptions, have led to a reassessment of the 
project economics, which are seen to remain attractive. The results of all work carried out to 
date have been compiled into this report and the resultant positive economics suggest that 
the Passendro project implementation would be beneficial for all stakeholders, not least 
because of its associated favourable and robust financial indications. 

The Passendro Permit is situated in an area of relatively poorly developed infrastructure but 
one in which regional developments such as the potential for electricity supply from the 
hydro-electric scheme at the proposed Kembe facility could bring a substantial improvement 
in the future, both in terms of the project economics as well as to the surrounding community 
as a whole. Regional developments will also be supplemented by a proposed enhancement 
of the off-site infrastructure such as the development of the Douala to Bangui road corridor to 
be financed by the African Development Bank and Monetary Union of Central African States 

a facet that is essential for the smooth and successful implementation of the 
project. 

  



 
 
 

Summary 1-2 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.2 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE OF SERVICES 

1.2.1 Introduction 

With the completion of a pre-feasibility study in 2006, which considered both heap leach and 
Carbon in Leach (CIL) process routes at differing annual throughputs, the conclusion was 
that the heap leach option was not optimal. The CIL option however, did exhibit favourable 
economics, so much so that AXMIN made the logical decision to carry the project to the next 
step and perform a full bankable feasibility study for the Passendro project.  

AXMIN approached SENET with a view to appoint them as lead consultant to compile the full 
feasibility report. 

AXMIN appointed various other consultants (SRK, Golder and AMEC) to assist SENET in 
carrying out the bankable feasibility study for the Passendro Project which is envisaged to 
include a 3 million tpa open pit mining and gravity-
of services is discussed below. 

Since the pre-feasibility study, exploration has added to the resource base of the project and 
continued feasibility investigations have led to better definition of the project. The improving 
gold price, as well as improved metallurgical knowledge through additional testwork, has led 
to a reassessment of the project economics. 

The results of all work carried out to date have been compiled into this report and 
conclusions and recommendations have been made. 

1.2.2 Scope of Services

1.3 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION: OWNERSHIP AND HISTORY 

1.3.1 Location and Access 

The Bambari Permits (also known as the Roandji property) cover an area of approximately 
1,000 km2 and are located some 320 km east-northeast of Bangui (440km by road) and are 
centred approximately 60 km north of the town of Bambari. Figure 1-1 indicates the position 
of CAR and the location of the prospects in relation to the geography of Central Africa.

1.3.2 Mineral Rights 

The Bambari property is held under two exploration licences, Bambari 1 (Number RC4-218, 
1 000 km²) and Bambari 2 (Number RC4-244, 1 000 km²), which were issued on 12th March, 
2004, and were valid for three years following which they were reduced in size and renewed 
for a period of a further three years in March 2007. The permits give Aurafrique, a subsidiary 
of AXMIN Inc. the right to explore for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, nickel and iron.  

The total area of the two permits is approximately 1,000 km2 and geographical coordinates 
for the permits are shown in Table 1-1.

1.3.3 Interest in the Property 

held 100% by Aurafrique.  

In order to keep the Bambari licences in good standing Aurafrique is required to pay annual 
surface taxes to the CAR government set for 2004 to 2005 and 2005 to 2006 at FCFA 
15 000 per km2, as well as to undertake exploration on the property with minimum 
expenditure of FCFA 25 000 per km2 (FCFA 50 000 000 for the property). 

On 12th March, 2004, the government of CAR granted a renewal of the Bambari permit, 
which at the same time was split into two permits, Bambari 1 and Bambari 2, in order that 
each would equate to the maximum area of 1,000 km2 as provided  
mining code.  

Aurafrique submitted its application for the renewal of the Bambari Permit on 21st July, 2003 
as the first five year term of the permit (under the old Mining Code) was due to expire on 23rd 
July, 2003. Renewal of the permit is a right (under both the old and new Mining Codes) 
providing the holder of a permit has complied with all necessary requirements of the Mining 



 
 
 

Summary 1-6 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project Bankable Feasibility Study 

Code, such as reporting and payment of permit taxes. Under the new Mining Code 
Exploration permits may be valid for 3 periods of 3 years. Under certain circumstances a 

of the Tanzania Mining Act, 1998. Reduction of the surface area is now a requirement of the 
new Mining Code with 50% of the surface area of an Exploration Licence (Permis de 
Recherche) being relinquished at each renewal.  

1.3.4 Royalties 

The Bambari property is subject to a royalty payable to the government on production, which 
is currently set at 2.25% by law and is confirmed at this level in the Convention signed 
between the CAR Government and Aurafrique SARL. In addition a 2.0% NSR is payable to 
United Reef Limited (a company previously related to the Company) from production once all 
capital expenditure has been recovered by Aurafrique. The Company has the right to 
purchase, during the initial five years of production from the Bambari permit, all or part of the 
2% NSR at a rate of Cdn$500,000 for each 0.5% NSR interest. 

1.3.5 Mineralised Zones 

Other than historic (1929 to 1951) alluvial gold mining by French colonial companies in 
drainages within the Bambari property and small scale artisanal mining for alluvial gold in the 
Ndassima area, there are no other sites of mineralization that have been exploited 
commercially and there is no present or historic mining infrastructure. 

1.3.6 Accessibility 

Access into the property and to the Aurafrique field camp near Ndassima village is by an all-
weather dirt road from the town of Bambari by way of a barge crossing at the Baidou River 
(which has a 15 tonne capacity). The distance from Bambari to Ndassima camp is 
approximately 60 km and takes 90 minutes. For heavier traffic such as bulk fuel shipments 
and heavy equipment, the property can be reached by way of the town of Ippy and the village 
of Djoubissi, which avoids the Baidou river crossing. 

The distance from Bangui to Bambari is 380 km and the road journey by way of the main 
towns of Sibut and Grimari takes between seven and nine hours. By charter aircraft, the 
journey from Bangui Mpoko International Airport to the laterite airstrip at Bambari takes just 
over one hour. 

camp is by an all-weather laterite road and within the active exploration areas, access is 
limited to bush roads and drill access tracks. To the north, Aurafrique has made a dry season 
access road up to the Topa iron ore prospect and this provides access also to the North 1, 
North 2 and Louba reconnaissance gold exploration grids. 

1.3.7 Climate 

The central part of the CAR has one distinct wet period from mid-June until mid-November. 

Maximum dry season temperatures range between 35°C to 40°C, with wet season 
temperatures varying from 15°C to 25°C. For exploration purposes, year round access to the 
Passendro gold prospects is achievable and fieldwork, including drilling, albeit more difficult 
in the wet season, can be undertaken. 



 
 
 

Summary 1-7 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.3.8 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The topography in areas of the Bambari property that are underlain by Archaean greenstone 
rocks is typified by northwest-trending ridges and hill masses of banded ironstone formation 
rising from 100 to 300 metres above the surrounding more gently undulating terrain. Altitude 
within the property ranges from 500 metres to 800 metres above sea level. The property 
straddles the watersheds of the Ouaka and Baidou drainage systems. Both these rivers flow 
year round and the associated dendritic drainage system comprises numerous first and 
second order streams, some of which are perennial. The vegetation cover across the 
Bambari property is classified as savannah forest (small trees, thicket and grasses) though 
gallery forest is developed along drainages and there are stands of tropical forest in places. 
Much of the vegetation around villages is secondary growth. Current land use by the local 
population consists primarily of subsistence farming including manioc (cassava), peanuts, 
sesame, cotton and tobacco. 

1.3.9 History 

There is only one documented report of previous production on the property and this was 
carried out by the Compagnie Équatoriale des Mines (CEM) during the Colonial period. In a 
regional prospecting programme in 1929, CEM discovered two alluvial gold deposits near 
Roandji village (within the Bambari Permit and inside the Passendro exploration grid). The 
Roandji alluvial gold fields were mined commercially by CEM from 1929 to 1951, with total 
gold production estimated at over 1.5 tonnes but no further exploration work was carried out 
until A  

The prospecting permit (or APM) for the Bambari property was initially granted in 1996 to 

Reef is a public Canadian junior resource exploration company. Under an agreement dated 
25th January , 1996 between United Reef and Asquith, the latter acquired a 100% undivided 
beneficial interest to the Bambari APM, subject to a 3% NSR retained by United Reef, which 
was subsequently reduced to 2%, payable after all capital expenditures have been 
recovered. Howe Centrafrique SARL. held legal title in favour of Asquith until 1998 when the 

Aurafrique SARL. 

Aurafrique was subsequently granted a Type A exploration permit for the Bambari property 
with exclusive exploration rights for gold and silver. In 2001, the Type A exploration permit 
was amended by the Minister of Mines and Energy to include exclusive rights to explore for 
iron, copper, lead, zinc and nickel. 

In 2001 AXMIN undertook a reverse takeover (RTO) of Asquith thereby acquiring Aurafrique 
and the Bambari Permit. 

Regional Stream Sediment Sampling Programme 1997 

In 1997, Asquith carried out a regional scale stream sediment sampling survey designed to 
generate exploration targets within a 600 km² target area located in the east-central portion 
of the Bambari property centred on the village of Ndassima.  

Detailed Follow-up Exploration by Asquith 1998 

Within the 64 km2 Passendro grid, Asquith carried out a detailed soil and termite mound 
sampling programme as well as trenching and Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drilling of the principal

soil anomaly that was delineated  d zone. Asquith 
sampled 5,663 termite mounds over the westernmost 40 km2 of the Passendro grid between 
29th April, 1998 and 25th August, 1998. 

Detailed Follow-up Exploration by AXMIN 1999-2004 

AXMIN reviewed the available Asquith data in May 1999 and entered into a Heads of 
Agreement with Asquith to take out an exclusive six month option to become involved in the 
project.  

Reverse Circulation (RC) Drilling Programme 1999-2000 

The RC drilling programme was carried out in two phases in late 1999 and early 2000 and 
comprised 144 RC drill holes and 14 RAB drill holes, totalling some 7,462 metres of drilling. 
The main focus of the drilling programme was the central portion of the Main Zone soil 
anomaly. However, the French Camp soil anomaly was also tested with 4 RC fences and the 
Katsia soil anomaly with one RC fence. 

Reconnaissance Generative Soil Sampling Programme 2000 

In parallel with phase 2 of the RC drilling on the Main Zone and French Camp prospects, 
AXMIN completed reconnaissance scale conventional soil and lag geochemical surveys 
across 200 km2 (10%) of the Bambari property between March and June 2000.  

Follow-up Soil Sampling Programme 2000 

Infill soil sampling and more detailed mapping (1:2,000 scale) covering the most significant 
multi-line soil anomalies identified during the March to June 2000 reconnaissance 
programme were completed on 200 x 50 metre centres, giving a sample density of 105 
samples/km². The interpretation of the results of this follow-up programme confirmed the 
following, previously identified, soil anomalies: 

Ao Grid - three anomalies 
 Ndassima Grid (including the French Camp Extension now known as Nguetepe)  

three anomalies 
 Louba Grid - one anomaly. 

 
RAB Drilling Programme 2002 

A reconnaissance RAB drilling programme commenced during the second quarter of 2002. 
The drilling programme was designed to test extensive gold in soil anomalies within the 
Passendro Grid and was based on the results of the Asquith soil archive study and 1:2,000 
scale mapping of the Main Zone and French Camp mineralised trends. 

The RAB drilling programme resulted in the identification of seven targets worthy of follow-up 
RC and core drilling within the Main Zone, French Camp and Katsia mineralised trends. 

Core and RC Drilling Programmes 2003 to 2005 

In May 2003 AXMIN began systematic core drilling at Passendro. Core drilling and RC 
drilling between May 2003 and August 2004 were concentrated at the French Camp, Katsia 
and Main Zone Prospects and these drilling operations were aimed at defining resources. 
Exploration drilling was also commenced at the Bacanga Head, Katsia and Ngodo 
Prospects. Based on the geological and analytical information generated by these drilling

programmes SRK Consulting prepared a Mineral Resource Estimation in August 2004 and 
this was updated in August 2005. 

Drilling continued up until early 2006 with the aim of upgrading the Mineral Resource 
classification for Katsia and Main Zone and initial investigation of the Baceta and Barbacoa 
Prospects.

Passendro Gold Project Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.4 EXPLORATION & GEOLOGY 

1.4.1 Introduction 

Exploration for primary sources of gold at Passendro commenced in 1998. The work 
programme defined the two principal mineralised trends at Passendro  the 7 km long Main 
Zone Trend and the 8km long French Camp Trend, which are both defined by strong gold in 
soil anomalies. These two more or less parallel northwest trends, shown in Figure 1.4, have 
formed the focus of all subsequent exploration work.   

Up to the end of Feasibility Study resource drilling (end May 2007) some 52,000 metres of 
core and 116,000 metres of RC drilling had been completed which forms the principal source 
of data supporting the Passendro resource base. 

The end Feasibility Study resource statement for all 7 of the Passendro mineralised bodies of 
the Passendro project, carried out by SRK Consulting (UK office), dated 31 June 2007 can 
be summarised as follows: 

 Measured and Indicated Resources - 23.2 Million tonnes, 1,795,000 ounces at an 
average grade of 2.4 g/t Au, and  

 
 Inferred Resources - 16.7 Million tonnes, 1,009,000 ounces at an average grade of 

1.9 g/t Au 
 
Of these Measured and Indicated Resources 96% are contained within the four main 
mineralised bodies, namely the Main Zone (731 koz), Katsia (484 koz), French Camp (326 
koz) and Bacanga Head (175 koz). 

1.4.2 Geology of the CAR  

The location of the Bambari 1 & 2 and Bakala Permits as well as AXMIN

Summary 1-11 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project Bankable Feasibility Study 

The southern part of the CAR straddles the northern margin of the Congo Craton and the 
foreland of the Oubangides Pan African age mobile belt.  

The Archaean basement complex comprises three main components: 

A widespread gneissic-charnokitic series comprising high-grade metasediments and 
granitoids, 
The Mbomou River mafic-ultramafic complex (2.9 Ga) in the south east of the 
country, and  

 The granitoid-greenstone belts of Bandas (2.8 Ga), Boufoyo-Dekoa and Bogoin. 
 
AXMIN regards the Archaean Greenstone belts in the CAR as the westward extension of 
Archaean Greenstone belts in northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which 
extend from Kilo-Moto in northeast DRC (9 million ounces of gold production since 1904) 
west northwestwards to the CAR border as shown in Figure 1-3.

developed in areas of high strain in shear zones predominantly within sericite-chlorite schists 
and quartz schists more often than not close to the contacts with BIF units. Mineralisation is 
often associated with quartz-tourmaline veining which is widespread in the Passendro area. 
The exception to this style of mineralisation is the French Camp where gold mineralisation is 
hosted by BIF and is associated with pyrite and pyrrhotite, which have replaced iron oxides in 
the BIF. 

1.4.5 Data Collection  Procedures and Quality Control 

Throughout the seven year exploration programme at Passendro, AXMIN has used a set of 
prescribed protocols and guidelines for the collection of surface and subsurface exploration 
data. These industry standard protocols have evolved although drilling and sampling 
techniques and QA-QC methodologies have remained more or less standard. Soil, trench 
and drilling data is held in an Access database. 

The field techniques, guidelines and protocols used by AXMIN are listed as follows:- 

Database. 
Survey control and grid establishment. 
Drilling, logging and sampling procedures. 
Core drilling, logging and sampling. 
RC drilling. 
Down hole surveys. 
Density measurement. 
Sample preparation. 
Assaying. 

 QA-QC protocol and checking procedures.  
 
SRK conclude in their analysis as follows:    

s that AXMIN s QA/QC procedures are adequate and it would appear that the 
performance of the Ndassima sample preparation laboratory and the analytical laboratories 
used by AXMIN

Summary 1-17 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.6 ORE RESERVES 

Conventional open pit shovel-truck methods will be used for the mining. The milling rate is 
variable dependent upon the ore type, but in general has been determined to be between 3.2 
million (oxides) and 2.2 million (sulphides) tonnes per year. Presently, it is envisaged the 
mining function will be carried by the mine operator, who may use a mining contractor for 
parts of the project.  

SRK utilised the geological models to optimise, design and prepare a Mine Plan and costing 
schedule. The Whittle 4X software package was used to identify the most economic pit 
designs; and the final engineered designs were completed using the Gemcom software, to 
facilitate the design of the mining areas and the access ramps. The volumes generated from 
the engineered pit designs formed the basis of the mine plan. 

The Whittle process requires various input parameters such as unit costs and other physical 
parameters and include the following:- 

Gold revenue of $650 per ounce. 
 Base mining rate of $1.55 per tonne of material, with adjustments for distance to the 

processing plant, de-watering and the increasing haul from deeper in the pits. 
 Varying Processing recoveries, throughput and costs, which are dependent upon 

several variables including the ore type (i.e. oxide, transitional or sulphide) and pit 
location. 

 Overall general administration and overhead costs, equivalent to $6.3M per year 
 
The Mine optimisations were conducted utilising the geological block models produced by 
SRK Resource geologists, and a series of nested whittle pit shells was produced for each of 
the areas. The various pit shells for the Main Zone and French Camp are graphically 
presented below in Figures 1-7 to 1-8, with the highlighted option indicating the final selected 
pit shell for engineering design. The resultant figures for all of the deposits are presented in 
the appendices.

Summary 1-22 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

In developing the mining schedule each pit was assessed and rated based upon, the gold 
grade, the stripping ratio and the distance to the Processing plant. The determination of the 
final mining schedule was based upon the excavating the higher rated pits (for example the 
highest grade, lowest stripping ratio and least distance), but taking into consideration the 
project following criteria: 

Minimum production of 200,000 ounces of recoverable gold per year, based upon a 
variable production rate for oxide, transition and fresh ore 
Increasing the ore grade recovered in the first two years.  

 A de-rating of the mining production during the first four months of the project for 
training purposes.  

 
The final schedule is based on developing the open pits in the following sequence with an 
initial focus on supplying higher grade ore early in the schedule, but including the French 
Camp deposit at an early stage, for strategic reasons due to proximity of the tailings facility. 

Main Zone 1 and 3, French Camp and Katsia in the pre-production period 
Main Zone 2 in Year1, 
Bacanga Head, Barbacoa in Year 4, and 

 Main Zone 4, Baceta and Nguetepe in Year 5 and 6. 
 
This is simplistically shown in the Table 1-4. 
 
Table 1-4 Open Pits schedule 

 
  *Year -1 refers to Pre production period of four months 
 
The Passendro project is planned to recover 16.8 million tonnes of gold mineralisation over a 
six year period, producing between 2.6 million tonnes to 3.0 million tonnes of ore per year. 
The waste excavation required to expose the ore varies between 22 million tonnes to 24 
million tonnes per year, as shown in Table 1-5.

Summary 1-24 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.7 MINING 

The mining operations will be undertaken by the owner who will be responsible for site 
preparation, haul road construction and maintenance, excavation and haulage of ore to the 
crusher and waste to the waste dumps, oversize breakage and equipment maintenance. 
Conventional open pit mining techniques and equipment, consisting of hydraulic excavators 
in a backhoe configuration loading into off-highway rear dump trucks, will be used.  

A net work of access roads will be developed as required but predominantly during the pre-
production phase, camp construction and mobilisation. The main arterial roads will be 
generally built to a 20m width, and will be engineered utilising in-situ cut and fill. 

There are limited soils available on the site, but where present they will be recovered during 
the pit preparation phase and stockpiled for future use with progressive waste dump 
rehabilitation. 

In the mining area pit benches will be developed in 5 metre horizontal lifts. Excavated 
material will be transported by haul trucks from the working areas directly to either the waste 
dumps or to the ROM stockpile area and feed hopper. A Run of Mine stockpile will be 
available for surcharge materials at the ROM pad area. 

All of the waste material from the excavation area will be hauled to external waste dumping 
areas situated locally to each of the mining pits. Where possible, end tipping will be utilised 
and the dump profile will be progressively extended outwards. As soon as practical after 
mining has been completed the waste dump will be profiled into a gentle sloping formation 
and covered, where possible, with soils or soil forming materials. 

To excavate the in-situ materials will require drilling and blasting to assist fragmentation and 

limit mining dilution, ore loss and safety from falling rocks. 

As part of the eventual closure planning, a bund will be placed around all open pits and the 
open pits will be allowed to fill with water based on the natural ground water levels. All of the 
waste dumps will be battered down to an overall slope of 20°, and the top of the waste 
dumps will be battered at a slope of 1:100 to allow for water to drain away. Topsoil will be 
replaced and seeded. 

The facilities erected by AXMIN will, if not required for ongoing use, be removed and buried 
in the waste dumps. The facility footprint and the haul road network will be rehabilitated and 
returned to its natural state 

The on-site staff at Passendro will undertake the mine planning, mine scheduling, grade 
control and performance monitoring. 

Annual peak material movements range from 6Mt initially (during the four month pre-strip 
period) to between 24Mt to 26Mt for the life of mine. The mining operations will consist of 

- 
been made for some disruption to working during the wet seasons. 

The initial major mining fleet, as presented in Table 1-7, will consist of six (6) excavators, 
fifteen (15) haul trucks, two tracked bulldozers, one wheeled bulldozer, two motor graders, a 
water bowser, with four hydraulic blast hole drill rigs. In addition there will be smaller 
equipment to support the mining fleet, such as service and refuelling trucks, light vehicles 
and crew buses. 



 

Summary 1-25 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

With major production starting in the first year the fleet will increase to seven (7) excavators, 
twenty (20) haul trucks, and additional wheeled loader (positioned at the stockpiles) and a 
water bowser.

Summary 1-26 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

1.8 METALLURGICAL TESTING AND PROCESS PLANT 

Metallurgical testwork on the various Passendro ore bodies was carried out in three phases 
with the aims and objectives: 

 To characterise the Passendro ore deposit and assess the amenability of the various 
ore sources to different unit operations and allow for the selection of the optimal 
process route. 

 To determine the plant design data for each ore type that could be used for the 
feasibility study and subsequent project implementation 

 
Phase 1 tests were carried out by Wardell Armstrong International and completed in October 
2005 under the supervision of GBM and these were mainly scoping tests. 

Phase 2 tests were conducted by SGS Lakefield South Africa under SENET supervision from 
July 2006 to October 2007 and these tests involved mineralogical investigations, 
comminution, head characterisation, gravity recovery, CIL appraisal/optimisation and cyanide 
destruction on leached tailings 

Phase 3 tests were carried out by SGS Lakefield South Africa from December 2007 to March 
2008 and were aimed at establishing the various responses of each lithology within an ore 
body using the optimum conditions established in Phase 2. Comminution tests conducted 
during Phase 2 indicated high variability within each ore body thus further comminution work 
was conducted in Phase 3 in order to ensure that the test samples could be related in some 
fashion to each ore body as a whole.  

The subsections below give a summary of the results. 

1.8.1 Mineralogy 

For all the oxide samples investigated, it was noted that the major minerals were quartz, 
muscovite and kaolite with hematite, goethite and tourmaline occurring as minor minerals. 
Gold occurred as liberated or attached to silicates with about 1% being locked up in gangue 
minerals mainly silicates. Heavy liquid separation tests conducted resulted in a fair amount of 
coarse liberated gold reporting to the sinks (68%) with a low mass pull 0.6%. This means that 
gravity recovery could be used as a technique and oxide ores can be subjected to direct 
cyanidation with no dissolution problems expected. 

For the sulphide samples investigated, it was noted that the major minerals were quartz, 
muscovite/biotite, garnet, chlorite and tourmaline with albite, kaolinite, hematite, goethite and 
sulphides as minor minerals. The main sulphide minerals were noted to be pyrite, 
arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. Trace amounts of chalcocite and chalcopyrite were observed in 
Main Zone sulphides. For Main Zone, French Camp and Bacanga Head sulphides gold 
occurred as liberated or attached to sulphides and silicates with very little locked up in 
gangue or sulphide minerals. Heavy liquid separation tests conducted on these three 
sulphide ores resulted in a fair amount of coarse liberated gold reporting to the sinks (67%) 
with reasonably low mass pulls. This means that gravity recovery could be used as a 
technique and all the three sulphide (Bacanga, French Camp and Main Zone) ores can be 
subjected to direct cyanidation with no dissolution problems expected. Presence of pyrrhotite 
and chalcocite in French Camp sulphides could result in high cyanide consumptions. 

About 28% of gold in Katsia Sulphides was observed to be finely grained and occluded in 
arsenopyrite which could prove to be difficult to liberate and hence likely to result  in poor

Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

recoveries. Heavy liquid separation tests conducted resulted in 47% of the gold reporting to 
the sinks at a mass pull of 0.8%, making gravity recovery an option.  

1.8.2 Comminution 

Comminution tests were mainly conducted on HQ drill samples and in instances where only 
fine material was available the Levin method was used to determine the Bond Ball Work 
Index. Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) tests were performed on PQ drill samples for Katsia 
and Main Zone oxides and on NQ drill samples on Katsia sulphides. The comminution data 
derived from these tests is summarised in Table 1-9. 
 
Table 1-9 Comminution Summary Table 

 
 

 The comminution testwork results indicate that high variability in terms of ore 
characteristics can be expected. The UCS results for both oxides and sulphides 
varied from very soft (<50MPa) to very hard (>250MPa) within the same ore body and 
this should be noted when designing the comminution circuit as ore from each ore 
body can be treated using a mineral sizer (for the soft material) and jaw crusher for 
the hard ore. 

 Based on the UCS results Main Zone & Katsia oxides exhibited extremes in terms of 
competencies, ie very low to extremely high , again this is an indication of presence 
of various lithologies which will be critical in the design of the crushing circuit.  

 Sulphides which were expected to exhibit high competency, also displayed extremes 
in terms UCS results, ie very low to extremely high. 

 The Bond Ball Work indices showed a range of very soft, soft, medium and 
moderately hard and sufficient attention during the design of comminution circuit 
design should address the treatment of the different ore types. 

 Drop weight test (DWi) results of 0.3, t10 of 64.4 and product of A*b of 602.8 place 
Main Zone and Katsia oxides in soft end of the JKTech DWi data base while values of 
DWi = 6.2, t10 = 30.1 and product of A*b = 43.5 for Katsia sulphides place it in the 
moderate range. These results are in agreement with the Bond Ball Work indices 
obtained 

 In one instance where another Main Zone sulphide sample was requested, the result 
indicated that the ore was in the medium category yet the first sample had displayed 
hard properties, an indication of varying lithologies. It will thus be imperative during 
the design of the milling circuit to take into account the likely variations even within 
the same orebody. 

 In all cases the Bond Rod Work Indices were surprisingly lower than the Bond Ball 
Work Indices, a phenomenon Orway Mineral Consultants interpreted to imply 
possible presence of sandstone/siltstone type lithologies.  

 The Bond Abrasion results show that the ore is very moderately abrasive and liner 
consumptions are not expected to be high.

1.8.3 Gravity Recoverable Gold 

Batch laboratory tests conducted at Wardell Armstrong International Laboratory during pre-
feasibility study indicated moderate to high gravity recoverable gold (GRG) results. It was 
against this background that caution was taken in the interpretation of GRG results as it is a 
well understood concept that laboratory Knelson recovers gold very efficiently and to higher 
mass pulls than full scale installed gravity centrifugal units, whose actual plant performance 
is expected to be inferior to laboratory determined GRG. Knelson Africa, were commissioned 
to perform GRG tests and simulation of the results using KCMOD*Pro model to predict circuit 
recovery. The concentrates generated using centrifugal unit were subjected to intensive 
cyanidation to assess the leach kinetics of the concentrates and cyanide consumptions. 
Refer to Table 1-10 for a summary of GRG and intensive cyanidation results. 

Table 1-10 Summary of GRG and Intensive Cyanidation Results 

 
 
Generally, all samples exhibited high gravity recoverable gold and high gravity concentrate 
dissolutions. An exception is noted for Katsia sulphide (TDS) due to occlusion of gold in 
arsenopyrite as noted in the SGS mineralogical report. Due to high gravity recoverable gold 
and the subsequent high dissolution efficiencies within a period of 24 hours, a gravity 
recovery stage has therefore been included in the circuit for the Passendro Process Plant. 

1.8.3.1 CIL Extraction 

Cyanidation tests were conducted on gravity middlings and tailings samples with the aim of 
optimising the grind, leach time and cyanide consumptions for each ore body. In addition 
effect of pre-robbing, oxygen and equilibrium tests were also carried out. The results are 
summarised in Table 1-11.

Table 1-11 Summary of Leach Optimisation Results 

 
 
Generally for oxides, recoveries were comparable for fine and coarse grinds.  However, with 
the sulphides the recoveries increased with fineness in the grind up to optimum levels of 
approximated 80% - 75µm. As a result 80% - 75µm was selected as the optimum grind.  

Leach kinetics indicated that 16-24 hrs will be sufficient for oxides and 24 hrs for sulphides, 
thus 24 hours was selected as the optimum leach time. 

There was a reduction in cyanide consumption when oxygen was added, as would  be 
expected, the leach kinetics improved, with an increase in dissolution of about 2-3% in 24 
hours, both factors which account for an increase in operating profit during operations. 
Oxygen injection into the CIL facility will be used. Oxygen uptake tests showed that higher 
oxygen consumptions (10-20 g/t/h) were obtained when benchmarked against a typical 
Witwatersrand ore with an oxygen uptake rate of 2-9g/t/h, which is consistent with ores that 
would require oxygen addition.  

Carbon loading kinetics and equilibrium isotherms yielded carbon loadings ranging from 
3,600 to 10,000 g/t before high solution tails are realized. These loadings are considerably 
above normal CIL design levels of about 2,000-3,000 g/t implying that a CIL design for 
Passendro will be able to handle the grades envisaged. 

 
1.8.4 Recovery 

Using the variability results, head grade versus actual and predicted recovery variability 
graphs were generated for the three ore types; oxides, transition and sulphides as shown in 
Figure 1-14, 1-15 and 1-16. 

Recoveries can be 
as follows: 

Oxides:    Recovery  =  2.601 ln(Head Grade) + 94.47 
Transition:  Recovery =  1.268 ln(Head Grade) + 93.32 

 Sulphides:   Recovery =  1.155 ln(Head Grade) + 94.52

The relative effectiveness of ferrous sulphate, sodium metabisulphite, sodium metabisulphite 
plus copper, hydrogen peroxide and alkaline chlorination at removing or destroying soluble

1.8.6 Viscosity and Rheology 

Oxides displayed significantly higher yield stress and plastic viscosity values compared to 
sulphides for solid mass concentrations ranging from 40 - 70%. Oxides and sulphides will 
behave as pastes at mass solids concentrations larger than 58% and 67% w/w respectively. 
This will be taken into account when designing the milling and classification circuits. 

However both oxides and sulphides showed a non-Newtonian behaviour at 42% solids by 
weight implying that there may not be a major impact on design of pumps, screens and 
mixers under normal operating conditions. 

1.8.7 Settling 

Settling and flocculent screening tests conducted indicated moderate (15 g/t) flocculent 
consumptions for both oxides and sulphides. Sulphides settle easily and can achieve up to 
65% solids by weight at a settling rate of 2.27 t/m2/hr, a phenomenon supported by 
rheological tests. Oxides displayed moderate settling rates, achieving 50% solids by weight 
at a selling rate of 0.98 t/m2/hr). These results can be used to design the tailings thickener if 
there is need to recover water prior to tailings discharge. 

1.8.8 Process Plant and Design Criteria 

The proposed Passendro Process Plant design will be based on well known and established 
Gravity/CIL technology, which consists of crushing, milling, gravity recovery of free gold 
followed by leaching/adsorption of gravity tailings, elution & gold smelting and tailings 
disposal. Services to the process plant will include reagent mixing, storage and distribution, 
water and air supplies.  

The plant will treat either 3.0 million tonnes per annum of oxide ore or about 2.5 million 
tonnes of transition ore or 2.1 million tonnes per annum of sulphide ore if campaigned 
through the plant separately or a combination if required. Both transition and sulphide ores 
will be crushed through a primary jaw crusher and stockpiled while crushing of the soft oxide 
ore will be accomplished with a mineral sizer. In the event of oxide ore is medium to hard, it 
will be treated through the primary jaw crusher. 

Recovery of gold will be through a combination of gravimetric means and direct cyanidation. 
Loaded carbon from CIL will be acid washed prior to elution, followed by re-activation of the 
eluted carbon. The solution from the elution circuit will be subjected to electrowinning, where 
gold will be deposited onto cathodes as sludge. Periodically the sludge will be washed off the 
cathodes and dried. The dried gold sludge will then be smelted to produce gold bullion which 
will be shipped to the refinery. 

A simplified flow sheet of the Passendro Process Plant is shown in Figure 1-17.

Summary 1-34 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.8.8.1 Crushing 

There will be two separate crushing stations to treat soft and hard ore. Soft rock has been 
identified to potentially cause material handling problems when processed through a jaw 
crusher. As a result a separate ROM bin, apron feeder and MMD type mineral sizer have 
been allowed for to treat this type of ore. The soft ore can at times contain high quantities of 
clay and moisture contents and this configuration is considered prudent. 

The mineral sizer product will be conveyed directly to the SAG mill feed with no stockpiling 
as this might result in rat holing on the stockpile due to presence of excessive amounts of 
fines. 

The balance of the ore being medium and hard rock types will be treated through hard rock 
primary crushing circuit to produce a SAG mill feed of size 100% passing 250mm. A static 
grizzly will be installed above the ROM bin and this will allow for direct tipping or front-end 
loader feeding with no risk of oversize material reporting to the crusher. Due to the hard and 
potentially abrasive nature of the medium and hard ores, an apron feeder will be installed for 
the withdrawal of ore from the ROM bin to a vibrating grizzly feeder to scalp off fines ahead 
of the primary crusher, which (fines) will result in accelerated wear on crusher liners.  

A single stage primary jaw crusher (single toggle) will be designed for the purpose of primary 
crushing as it is easy to operate, maintain and can more easily withstand heavily abrasive 
ores when compared to double toggle jaw crushers. Crushed material will be conveyed to a 
stockpile 24 hour live capacity, conical Stockpile.  

1.8.8.2 Milling & Classification 

An Semi Autogenous, Ball Milling and Pebble Crushing circuit (SABC) will be designed as it 
will provide the flexibility to treat the variable mill feed (soft, medium and hard ores) and will 
be more power efficient compared to SAG and Ball Milling circuit (SAB) or single stage SAG.  

Ore can be campaigned in the mill by ore type or by combining soft rock with medium or hard 
rock depending on the availability of ore types. 

A variable speed drive will be installed on the SAG Mill to cater for variations in the ore 
characteristics during the life of the mine. In instances where soft oxides will only be treated 
the SAG mill will act as a pulper and most of the grinding will take place in the Ball Mill. This 
will have the advantage when dealing with viscosity challenges likely to be encountered  A 
SAG mill bypass conveyor will be allowed for to feed the Ball Mill directly should the need 
arise. 

The installed pebble crusher will handle the recycled pebbles that will not readily break down 
during SAG milling which will result in improved power usage and throughput. 

Classification will be through hydrocyclones. A densifying cyclone cluster will be designed 
from which a cyclone overflow product at 42% solids will be obtained thus removing the need 
for a pre-leach thickener.  

A linear trash screen will be included in the design prior to the leach to remove tramp 
material. 



 
 

Summary 1-35 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.8.8.3 Gravity 

Gravity recoverable gold batch laboratory tests conducted indicated that free gold is available 
in all ore types in significant quantities. In addition intensive cyanidation of the resultant 
gravity concentrates from all ore types, with exception of Katsia sulphide containing a high 
portion of arsenopyrite, showed favourable leach kinetics and extractions. As a result a 
gravity circuit consisting of a centrifugal concentrator, intensive cyanidation reactor and 
electrowinning circuit will be designed to recover free gold from cyclone underflow. This 
circuit will improve overall gold recovery and reduce residence time in the CIL circuit.  

1.8.8.4 CIL  

Gold dissolution on the milled ROM and gravity tails products will be effected via a CIL 
circuit. The decision to go CIL is based on two factors: 

a. testwork results indicated a potential of pre-robbing in the ore 
b. ease of operation of a CIL circuit. 

 
Cyanidation tests conducted indicate satisfactory gold dissolution within a leaching time of 24 
hrs on gravity middlings and tailings, under normal CIL conditions and elevated oxygen 
levels. The leach circuit will be designed to treat a direct feed from the cyclone overflow at a 
solids concentration of 42%. Tests were conducted at natural oxygen levels and introduction 
of oxygen will potentially reduce cyanide consumption and enhance leach kinetics. Oxygen 
will be sparged (injected) into the feed to CIL and all CIL tanks. Introduction of oxygen 
coupled with pre-leaching ahead of CIL will enhance fast leaching kinetics which will result in 
high carbon loadings in the first CIL tank. A carbon addition of 10 g/l will be sufficient for the 
gold adsorption in the CIL circuit. 

Flow from one CIL tank to another will be through inter-tank launders (washing tanks) and all 
tanks will have a bypass facility to ensure continuity in production during periods when a tank 
is taken offline for maintenance. 

The design of the CIL area will also incorporate a fixed Tower Crane which will be used 
during construction and operating phases. During the operating phase, it will be used to 
facilitate cleaning of the inter-stage screens and general maintenance. 

Results from batch extraction and rheological tests were used as the basis for CIL design. 
The feed density to CIL will be designed at 42% solids to cater for flow through the interstage 
screens especially during times when soft oxide ore is being processed which tends to be 
associated with higher viscosities.  

Loaded carbon from the first CIL tank will be pumped to a screen where the screen oversize 
(washed loaded carbon) will gravitate to the acid wash cone and the undersize (slurry) will 
report to the first CIL. A linear screen will be used for this function as opposed to the 
traditional vibrating screen as this will result in a smaller structure as linear screens are non-
vibratory. 

The design of the CIL area will also incorporate a fixed Tower Crane which will be used 
during construction and operating phases. During the operating phase, it will be used to 
facilitate cleaning of the interstage screens and general maintenance. 

1.8.8.5 Cyanide Detoxification 

A linear screen will be incorporated into the design to recover any fugitive carbon.  



 
 

Summary 1-36 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Batch laboratory tests conducted indicated that cyanide destruction could be effected using 
sodium metabisulphite and copper sulphate as a catalyst in a period of 2 hours, reducing 
WAD cyanide in the final tailings to approximately 50ppm. The cyanide detoxification process 
will thus be designed as two stage agitated reactors into which compressed air will be blown.  

Precaution has been taken to include an additional cyanide detoxification facility which will be 
allowed for at the tailings return water system in the event where there will be more return 
water compared to plant process water requirements. This facility will detoxify cyanide in 
solution to <1ppm total cyanide prior to discharge into the environment. This facility will utilise 
hydrogen peroxide, copper sulphate as a catalyst and HCl for pH control (8-9).  

1.8.8.6 Acid Wash 

A cold acid wash circuit capable of taking the full 10-tonne batch will be included to remove 
any carbonates that might otherwise foul the carbon. The circuit will be designed to acid 
wash every batch of carbon before it is eluted by circulating a 3% HCl through the carbon in 
the acid wash column. The acid wash cone will be designed with an overflow weir to facilitate 
elutriation of loaded carbon prior to the acid wash step. The elutriation process will remove 
trash from the carbon such as wood chips and plastics which might otherwise interfere with 
the flow through the strainers during elution. 

1.8.8.7 Elution 

Based on the carbon loadings and the amount of gold to be produced per month, the number 
of elutions calculates to 25 per month and a pressure ZADRA elution method was selected to 
strip gold from the loaded carbon in 10 tonne carbon batches. Even when using this method 
for an elution the number of elutions per month is conservative and this will allow for 
increased number of elutions in the event where peaks in the gold grade to the CIL circuit are 
experienced. Heating of the eluant will be achieved through diesel fired thermic oil heaters.  

1.8.8.8 Electrowinning 

Pregnant solution exiting the column will be directed to three electrowinning cells, operating 
in parallel for CIL, via a flash/header tank where gold will be deposited on the cathodes as 
sludge and the barren solution will be circulated back to the elution tank. A dedicated header 
tank and electrowinning cell will be used to recovery gold from gravity pregnant solution. 
Electrowinning will be carried out through sludging cell type electrowinning cells.  

1.8.8.9 Regeneration 

The carbon regeneration facility will be designed to treat the entire eluted carbon batch within 
a period of 20 hours. The regeneration kiln will be diesel fired. 

1.8.8.10 Calcining & Smelting 

Fully loaded cathodes will be periodically removed from the cells, and the gold sludge 
washed off using a high pressure washer and the solution decanted. The gold sludge will be 
calcined (dried) in an electric fired calcination furnace. Two calcine furnaces will be provided; 
one working and one standby. The calcined sludge will then be mixed with fluxes and loaded 
into an induction smelting furnace. During smelting, metal oxides will form slag and once the 
furnace crucible contents are poured into cascading moulds, gold will solidify at the bottom 
while slag separates easily from the gold. The gold bullion bar(s) will be cleaned, labelled 
and readied for shipping.

Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.8.8.11 Reagents 

Facilities to mix, store and distribute reagents and consumables will be allowed for in the 
design. These reagents and consumables will include grinding media, cyanide, caustic, lime, 
sodium metabisulphite, copper sulphate, hydrogen peroxide, diesel (for plant use only), 
hydrochloric acid and smelting fluxes. The reagent consumptions obtained during bench 
scale laboratory tests were used to estimate the size of the equipment associated with 
mixing, storage and distribution of most of the reagents. As reagents are generally classified 
as a safety risk, safety showers will be incorporated into the design and where there is 
cyanide usage in high concentrations, hydrogen cyanide detectors will be put in place to give 
an early warning in the event of formation of detectable HCN gas. 

 
The design of the reagents area will also incorporate a fixed Tower Crane which will be used 
during construction and operating phases. During the operating phase, it will be used to 
facilitate reagents make up such as lime, cyanide, caustic, sodium metabisulfite, copper 
sulphate and general maintenance. 

a. Lime 

Due to the high transport cost associated with lime, it was decided to procure unslaked lime 
whose available CaO content is greater than 90% compared to hydrated lime with an 
available CaO content of 65-67%. The lime circuit will thus be designed to have a lime 
storage silo with a 2 day capacity, a slaking facility and a storage and dosing facility of slaked 
lime whose capacity will be equivalent to 2 days 

b. Cyanide 

The cyanide make-up and dosing facility will be designed taking into account the total 
cyanide usage in the CIL, elution and intensive cyanidation areas and allowing for one make-
up batch per day and a one-day storage capacity for the dosing and storage tank. 

c. Caustic Soda 

Caustic soda usage will be on a batch basis and thus the make-up tank will double as a 
dosing and storage tank. Total caustic usage in the plant (elution, ILR and acid 
neutralisation) will be used to determine the size of the tank assuming a storage capacity of 4 
days. 

d. Sodium Metabisulphite 

The design of the sodium metabisulphite make-up and storage facility will be based on a 
single make-up per day and 24-hour storage and dosing  

e. Copper Sulphate 

The design of the copper sulphate make-up (preparation) and storage facility will be based 
on a single make-up per day and 24 hour storage and dosing  

f. Hydrogen Peroxide 

Design will assume that hydrogen peroxide will be delivered in 200 L drums at a strength of 
50% which can be pumped into the storage tank using a drum pump. 



 
 

Summary 1-38 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

g. Hydrochloric Acid 

Design will assume that hydrochloric acid will be delivered in 200 L drums at a strength of 
33% HCl which can be pumped into the acid wash tank using a drum pump. 

h. Plant Diesel 

A facility to store diesel in the plant will be designed by taking into account diesel consumed 
by thermic oil heaters and regeneration kiln and assuming a storage facility of 10 days.  

i. Smelting Fluxes 

Smelting fluxes, Borax, Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Nitrate, Silica, Fluorspar and Manganese 
Dioxide, consumptions were estimated by assuming a flux ratio of 58%, 17%, 17%, 5%, 2%, 
1%, to the weight of calcine, respectively. 

j. Grinding Media 

The SAG and Bal
method using abrasion index results obtained from laboratory tests. This translated to 0.088, 
0.124, 0.379 kg/t for the SAG mill grinding media for the oxides, transition and sulphide ore 
respectively. Grinding media consumption for the ball mill worked out to be 0.191, 0.205 and 
0.225 kg/t for oxides, transition and sulphide ore respectively. 

k. Mill Liners 

Two liner changes per mill per annum were assumed based on advice from the liner vendor 
and sharing of experience from other operating mines using the same type of liners 
(Polymet) and grinding media size. 

l. Jaw Crusher Liners 

The estimated number of liner changes per annum was calculated using the abrasion indices 
obtained from laboratory tests and the expected liner life as given by the supply for a given 
throughput. 

1.8.8.12 Air Services  

Oxygen uptake results obtained through batch tests will be used as the basis for the sizing of 
the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit. Low pressure air requirements for the 
detoxification process and general plant will be supplied by two screw compressors, one 
working and one on standby. Instrument air requirements for the entire plant will be supplied 
through use of a dedicated small compressor and air drier with provision to tap from the main 
plant compressors should standby facilities be required. 

1.8.8.13 Plant Water Services 

A weir will be installed across the Baceta River to enable abstraction of water, using 
submersible pumps, to a water storage dam. Two submersible pumps, one working and the 
other standby, will be installed in the raw water storage facility to enable pumping of water to 
the process and raw water ponds located in the plant area. These pumps will be sized to 
cater for the commissioning, dry and wet seasons where raw water demands vary 
significantly.   



 
 

Summary 1-39 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

The raw water pond located in the plant will be sized for a storage capacity of 24 hours. Raw 
water distribution to various areas of use within the plant will be effected through designated 
pumps such as mill cooling water, gland water, raw water, fire water pumps, etc. 

The process water pond located in the plant will be sized at a storage capacity of 24 hours. 
Process water will be distributed from the process water pond to areas of use through low 
pressure high volume mill process water, high pressure low volume spray water and hosing 
water pumps.

1.9 WASTE, TAILINGS AND WATER MANAGEMENT 

1.9.1 Introduction 

In 2005, AMEC Earth & Environmental (AMEC) was requested to visit the Passendro project 
site to review the concession area and develop pre-feasibly level designs for potential 
Tailings Management Facility (TMF) sites. The pre-feasibility study (finalised during May 
2006) subsequently addressed a series of TMF site options, alternative tailings deposition 
systems, preliminary costs and summarised project recommendations for further study. 
AMEC were subsequently instructed during October 2006 to develop a feasibility design for 
the preferred TMF location together with designs for a potential Water Storage Dam (WSD). 

The feasibility designs for the TMF and WSD accommodate appropriate statutory 
requirements for the Central African Republic, recommendations from the EU Waste 
Management Directive (Directive 2006/21/EC), Best Available Techniques (BAT) for the 
management of tailings, the Equator principals, and operator requirements with respect to 
the safe, efficient, environmentally acceptable storage of the mine waste products. 

1.9.2 Site Selection 

Twelve potential TMF valley sites were identified and individually appraised to confirm the 
optimum location. The 2005 selection process confirmed that the optimum location for the 
TMF and WSD, with respect to minimum environmental impact, land use, location, proximity 
to future mine infrastructure and economics, is located within the Baceta River eastern 
catchment area, west of the mineralised zone, adjacent to French Camp, south of the 
proposed process plant site, Figure 1-18. 

Figure 1-18 Optimum TMF and WSD Sites 

 



 
 

Summary 1-41 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.9.3 Tailings Delivery Options 

The tailings product to be produced by the process plant will be in the form of a sandy silt 
residue (Figure 1-19), comprising some 70% silt discharged in the form of a slurry with 
between 38% and 42% solids by weight.  

Figure 1-19 Passendro Tailings Sample PSD 

 
 
Three tailings delivery and deposition methods have been considered, these are: 

Filter Cake:  The tailings product is passed through additional thickeners and/or a pressure 
belt filter system to dewater the total product to its optimum moisture content. The caked 
tailings are then delivered to the deposition area by either articulated truck or a dedicated 
overland conveyor system, for controlled deposition. As the Passendro project has a positive 
water balance, the recovery of a high percentage of process solutions from the tailings at the 
process plant is not required for water conservation. Consequently, analysis of the 
environmental advantages and disadvantages against operational costs, suggests that the 
development of a filter cake system is not the optimum solution for the project. 

Paste/Thickened Tailings:  The tailings product is discharged via additional thickeners to 
reduce the pulp density to at least 70% solids by weight. They are then delivered to the 
depository using positive displacement pumps for either, co-disposal with stripped 
overburden or, discharged from a series of open-end discharge points to form a natural 
cone-shaped depository. Analysis of environmental advantages and disadvantages against 
operational costs together with the paucity of suitable sites and potential problems in 
controlling moisture contents following discharge during high rainfall events, suggested that 
the development of a paste delivery system is not the optimum solution for the project. 



 
 

Summary 1-42 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Slurry Tailings: This consists of discharge of the un-thickened total tailings product at the 
process plant pulp density and delivery via a centrifugal pumping system to the TMF for sub-
aerial deposition. Three alternative discharge options comprising, open end discharge pipes, 
hydrocyclones and spigotting, have been appraised with respect to environmental 
management and operational costs.  

The analysis suggests that the most appropriate method for the delivery of tailings to the 
TMF is via a slurry transport system. 

1.9.4 Design Basis Storage Requirement 

The Passendro project is based on a number of discrete ore bodies known as Main Zone, 
French Camp, Katsia, Bacanga Head, Baceta, Barbacoa and Nguetepe prospects. To exploit 
the disseminated oxide ore and epithermal vein-style materialisation, a series of open pits 
(up to 120 m deep) are proposed. The majority of the ore will be won from the Main Zone 
and Katsia open pits, potentially blended with ore from other pits and treated using a 
conventional gravity and Carbon in Leach (CIL) process. The feasibility design of the TMF 
has been based on process design parameters as advised by SENET during 2007, and as 
summarised on the proposed run of mine excavation schedule, Table 1-13 prepared by SRK. 

Table 1-13 200,000 oz Run of Mine Excavation Schedule 

 
 
For the purposes of this feasibility study AMEC have assumed that the maximum ore 
production will be 3 Mtpa up to a tonnage of 17 Mt, for an initial project life of 6 years, with 
the potential for increasing to 21 Mt over an additional 1 year. 

The sequential embankment crest elevations required to safely retain the tailings have been 
. The analysis confirms that for the 

retention of 18 Mt of tailings, its associated supernatant pond and the catchment runoff 
volume from a probable maximum flood (PMF) event, the crest elevation for the pre-
deposition starter embankment will be 406 m RL, with a final elevation of 416 m RL. An 18 m 
high embankment will ultimately be developed (when measured at its highest point), which 
can be easily raised to 418 m RL, for the future safe storage of 21Mt of tailings, Table 1-14.

1.9.4.1 Tailings Deposition Characteristics 

Calculations have been undertaken to estimate the actual potential for the tailings to fail 
during a seismic event. The analysis indicates that for drained sub-aerial tailings deposition, 
the tailings will not be prone to liquefaction and are therefore unlikely to fail under earthquake 
loading.  

Geochemical analysis undertaken by others suggests that during the first two years of 
production tailings discharged to the TMF are unlikely to exhibit a potential for acid 
generation. These tailings will consequently be used to cover the majority of the TMF basin 
area. During year 6 some only 8% of the tailings are scheduled to be fresh sulphides with 
33% transitional material. Blended tailings discharged to the TMF will potentially exhibit the 
potential for acid generation however; the magnitude requires to be confirmed. In the interim, 
AMEC recommend that during years 5 and 6 (prior to closure), production of the oxide, 
sulphide and transitional tailings are phased to enable sulphide tailings to be anaerobically 
encapsulated by the oxide tailings.  

1.9.5 Tailings Management and Disposal 

A pumped slurry transportation system with a spigot distribution system is best solution for 
optimal management of the Passendro tailings, Figure 1-20. 



 
 

Summary 1-44 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Figure 1-20 Typical Spigot Detail 

 
 
Tailings will be slurried within the process plant and pumped to the TMF via a dedicated 
450 mm diameter HDPE pipeline. At the main embankment, the tailings will then be 
sequentially sub-aerially discharged onto the upstream beach from a series of spigots, which 
shall be opened and closed to allow for the formation of 100 mm thick layers. These will be 
allowed to desiccate and consolidate prior to placement of the next layer. This tailings 
disposal strategy ensures effective material deposition, maintenance of a sufficient freeboard 
to accommodate extreme flood storage requirements, and ensures that the interim and final 
location of the supernatant pond is efficiently controlled. This sequential deposition strategy 
also mitigates against potential wind borne particulate emissions from the exposed tailings 
beach, which can be of an environmental concern during operation of the facility. 

In addition to spigotting of tailings from the embankment, tailings will also be discharged from 
the western environs of French Camp open pit, to confine the supernatant pond within the 
middle of the TMF, remote from the future open pit works. 

1.9.6 TMF and WSD Embankment Design 

Due to the lack of evidence of active faults within 10 km of the site, the Seismic Risk of the 
Passandro TMF and WSD are classified as low. The seismic design parameters have 
consequently been defined with reference to International Commission on Large Dams 
(ICOLD) Bulletin 98 (1995) Tailings Dams and Seismicity, with supplementary information 
from ICOLD Bulletins 46 (1983) and 72 (1989) which deal with Seismicity and Dam design. 
Incremental embankment raises will consequently be constructed, initially using the 
downstream method of construction (when the rate of rise is high), and then by the upstream 
method of construction, Figure 1-21. 

 



 
 

Summary 1-45 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Figure 1-21 TMF Embankment Cross Section 

 
 
The embankment section will include filter drains which, will be designed to effectively 
manage drainage from the deposited tailings and from within the embankment, lowering the 
internal phreatic surface and enhancing the embankments stability. A typical arrangement for 
the upstream and starter embankment drains are illustrated on Figure 1-22. 

Figure 1-22 TMF Upstream Underdrainage System 

 
 
To ensure the ongoing safety and design validation of the facility, instrumentation will be 
incorporated into the embankment cross-section to monitor performance of the structure with 
respect to its vertical and horizontal movement, and elevation of the internal phreatic surface.  

The TMF will be sequentially raised each year to safely accommodate the total tailings 
product. The typical arrangement for the first year is illustrated in Figure 1-23. Operational 
flexibility and future expansion potential has consequently been included in the TMF 
feasibility design.  

1.9.7 General Arrangement 

The TMF is located 0.5 km west of French Camp open pit, directly south of the Passendro 
process plant (Figure 1-23), within a minor stream tributary which reports to the Baceta 
River. The site comprises a 600 m long natural amphitheatre valley which rises from 
397 mRL at the centreline of the proposed TMF, to an elevation of 404 mRL within the 
stream invert at the eastern edge of the valley. The eastern and southern slopes then rise at 
approximately 10% to form hill crests with elevations in excess of 506 mRL. The northern

boundary slope rises to approximately 420 mRL, before the landform drops down into the 
adjacent WSD valley.

The TMF starter embankment will be formed to 406 m RL by the placement of compacted 
selected lateritic earthfill taken either from initial open pit excavation pre-stripping works or, a 
dedicated borrow area upstream of the TMF. Tailings slurry will be delivered from the 
process plant to the facility via a single 450 mm diameter HDPE pipeline and distributed 
around the facility prior to sub-aerial discharge onto adjacent slimes beach. Following 
hydraulic discharge, water released from the slurry, together with precipitation runoff, will 
report directly to the supernatant pond from where it will be abstracted via a side slope 
decant system for either return to the process plant or detoxification.  

1.9.8 Site Surface Water Management 

Protection of natural water quality and water resources is a key issue for TMF design. The 
environmental impact of the TMF on surface waters will be mitigated by the provision of a 
storm water interception and diversion system. The diversion system will intercept seasonal 
run-off from the catchment north and south of the TMF and divert it into either, the northern 
WSD or, the Baceta River. Flow in excess of the capacity of the diversion system will 
overflow into the TMF and be retained within the supernatant pond. Typical cross sections for 
the diversion facilities are illustrated on Figure 1-24.

Figure 1-24 Typical Cross Section Through Access Road and Stormwater Diversion 

 
The diversion system will ensure that the TMF has a minimal impact on the Baceta River and 
that adequate compensation flows are maintained downstream. 

1.9.9 Groundwater Protection 

The TMF impoundment area will be stripped of all vegetation and topsoil, shallow ripped, 
rolled and compacted to enhance density and its natural in situ permeability characteristics. 
As such, the majority of the TMF basin area will be protected with a natural lateritic mineral 
liner underlain by low permeability Schist. Where extensive horizons of higher permeability 
BIF (Banded Ironstone Formations) are evident and the potential for localised high zoned 
seepage is possible a lining will be installed. Sections of the TMF basin will consequently be 
either, lined with up to 2 m of approved low permeability lateritic earthfill (compacted in situ 
over the excavated BIF intrusion outcrop) or, locally lined with a 1.5 mm thick HDPE 
geosynthetic low permeability membrane. The extent to the BIF outcropping within the TMF 
basin has been approximately identified following the feasibility level geotechnical site 
investigations and from condemnation drilling. The actual extent requires to be validated at 
the detailed design stage.  

1.9.10 Supernatant Water Management 

The operating system for the tailings depository will be focused on the safe storage of solid 
waste, maintenance of stability of the containment structures and effective control of the 
quality and quantity of surface water stored in the depository. A side slope decant system will 
be provided, with sufficient capacity, to regulate the volume of water stored in the facility and 
to discharge it via two penstocks and control valves, to the downstream decant return water 
pond, Figure 1-25.

Figure 1-27 Plan of Return Water Ponds 

 
 
Water decanted from the TMF pond will be discharged by gravity via two 450 mm diameter 
penstocks to a downstream valve control house, Figure 1-26 and a 10,000 m3 capacity 
decant water return pond, Figure 1-27. The HDPE lined decant water return water pond. 

Up to 83% of the abstracted supernatant water volume will be pumped from the decant 
return pond directly to the process plant, with the balance directed to the detoxification plant 
and the adjacent 6,000 m3 detoxification pond, for neutralisation and safe discharge to the 
Baceta River. The supernatant pond will consequently be managed to ensure that return 
water is effectively clarified. 

1.9.10.1 Water Balance 

To estimate process water supply, seasonal hydrological and the mine water balance 
parameters have been modelled on a monthly time step, containment requirements and the 
magnitude of discharge to the water treatment plant and/or environment. The typical project 
wide water balance is illustrated in Figure 1-28 



 
 

Summary 1-50 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Figure 1-28: Typical Water Balance 

 
 
The average, maximum and minimum (average) monthly precipitation and evaporation data 
sets appropriate for the project site have been adopted to model the TMF water balance for 
monthly time steps, at each sequential TMF development phase. To maintain the required 
safe freeboard height between the supernatant pond and the TMF embankment crest, the 
surface area of the supernatant pond is assumed to be no larger than 33% of the sequential 
TMF impoundment area. Precipitation events within the TMF catchment have been equated 
against potential losses (evaporation, minor seepage and pore water retention), and 
balanced to identify monthly gains or losses. These results have been equated against the 
monthly process plant water requirements to establish the volume of water that can be safely 
reclaimed from the supernatant pond, the volume of water that will require to be neutralised, 
and the volume of fresh water that will potentially be abstracted from the Baceta River. A 
summary of the maximum and minimum water balance results is presented on Table 1-15.

1.9.10.2 Make Up Water Management 

As demonstrated by the water balance, additional fresh water and dry season supernatant 
pond makeup water will be required by the process plant. For the start-up operations and 
during subsequent dry seasons, make-up fresh water will require to be pumped from the 
Baceta River to the WSD retention facility. The volume of water stored within the WSD will 
also be augmented by local catchment runoff and seasonal precipitation. Additional 
augmentation of the WSD retained volume through the pumping of the dewatering volume 
from the open pits, has not been addressed at this time but will be taken into consideration 
as part of the site wide water management plan. 

The WSD will comprise a low permeability earthfill retention wall constructed to a maximum 
height of 10 m above the valley invert, Figure 1-29. 

Figure 1-29 Typical Sections through the Water Storage Dam 

 
 
A side channel spillway will also be provided to regulate the volume within the facility and to 
safely discharge excess water during high rainfall events, Figure 1-30. As with the TMF, a 
monthly time step water balance has been undertaken to estimate the volume of make up 
water pumped from the Baceta River. The maximum and minimum water balance results are 
shown on Table 1-15.

1.9.11 Operation and Maintenance of Facility 

An operations and maintenance (O&M) manual will be prepared as part of the detailed 
engineering design for both the TMF and WSD. A key element in this manual will be the 
procedures for controlled disposal of tailings and for effective and safe management of water 
within the depository. A further key part of this manual will be the procedures for performance 
monitoring of the two structures to ensure compliance with design requirements and as part 
of the regular safety assessments of both facilities.  

During the operational life of the TMF, annual capital works will be required as part of the 
staged development of the facility. The implementation of these capital works will be 
described in the O&M manual and will be fully integrated with the ongoing operation and 
maintenance of the facility. 

1.9.12 Closure of the Facility 

will be developed based on 
guidelines similar to those prepared by the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and 
Mines (1995) or the Minerals Industry Research Organisation of UK (MIRO, 1999). The plan 
will incorporate a long-term objective for closure and rehabilitation, which will permit the mine 
operator to leave the site in a condition that, requires limited on-going maintenance and 
monitoring.  

Management and operational requirements for implementing the environmental procedures 
are reviewed in the detailed Environmental Impact Study (EIS), and the costs appraised as 
part of the overall project strategic plan. 

 



 

Summary 1-53 April 2008

1.9.13 Capital Cost 

The total cost of the pre-deposition TMF including the basal preparation, WSD civil works, 
but exclusive of supply and installation of the tailings delivery pumps, decant barges, mine 
dewatering pumps and delivery pipelines, industrial detoxification facility, electrical supply 
and reticulation, is estimated at US$ 5.3M (i.e., US$3.4M for TMF and US$ 1.9M for WSD, 
(inclusive of 10% P&G and 15% contingencies and unmeasured items). The equivalent cost 
estimate for TMF final works (including closure), with the embankment constructed to 
417 mRL is US$ 11.1M. Construction to a final elevation of 416 mRL will reduce the year six 
total cost by $0.48M. The estimated costs are exclusive of detailed engineering, additional 
field investigations (topographic survey and geotechnical) and construction management and 
supervision fees.

Table 1-17 Water Dam Estimated Construction Costs 

 

1.9.14 Conclusion 

Based on the project production parameters provided, a disposal system design has been 
developed which is robust, suits the planned mine and process plant operational methods, 
meets the environmental requirements for a secure TMF and WSD, and provides flexibility 
for possible future mine expansion. 

1.9.15 Recommendations 

To implement the detailed design stage for the TMF and WSD, a programme of further field 
investigations, topographic survey and laboratory test work will be required.

1.10 HUMAN RESOURCE ELEMENT AND MANPOWER 

1.10.1 Human Resource Element 

AXMIN 

fundamental in its quest to be a successful gold mining development company. 

The key policy will be to ensure that the company attracts and develops, motivates and 
 

 range of issues that if addressed correctly will 
benefit the stakeholders, some of which are listed below:- 

Manpower or workforce. 
Surrounding communities. 
Incumbent businesses in the area. 
CAR government. 

 Company management. 
 
A balanced strategy will be created to satisfy the expectations of the above stakeholders. It 
will take into account the fundamental factors that are described later in greater detail. A list
of relevant topics is as follows: - 

Recruitment.  
Remuneration. 
Housing. 
Industrial relations. 
Safety and health. 
Emergency response procedure. 
HIV/aids policy. 
Training and development. 
Community liaison. 
Grievance mechanisms. 

 Security. 
 
The first part of this section describes the principles to be adopted when it comes to 
implementation in each of the above areas.  

Finally, the proposed workforce is described in some detail. 

1.10.2 Recruitment 

Several aspects need to be considered in order to match the right person for the right job. 
This will include items mentioned in the headings below 

1.10.2.1 Criteria Considered 

Competence and Education (Qualifications). 
 Experience. 

Integrity. 
Teamwork. 
Training culture.  
Promotion. 

 Skills. 



 

Summary 1-55 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Social partnership.  
Non-discrimination. 
Multiculturalism.  

 Safety. 
 
1.10.2.2 Major Characteristics 

The major criteria that will be used by the company will be the level of competence and 
experience that a potential employee brings to a given position. Moreover, the capacity for 
transfer of these skills further, so as to create an efficient and effective work-force will be 
considered. 

However the reality of the socio-economic situation of the immediate external environment 
dictates that not all skills will be available locally. Candidates will be initially made from the 
neighbouring locales; only in the event that these skills are unable to be found locally, will the 
recruiting be opened to wider zones.  

1.10.2.3 Effective Recruiting 

AXMIN can only be successful if it recruits skilled and diligent personnel. The company 
therefore cannot recruit personnel according to subjective criteria, e.g. who one knows , 
nepotism or arbitrary recommendations. The company will ensure that discrimination is 
avoided and that a fair chance is given to all applicants. All of the above precepts are to be 
transparent and readily accessible by all. To this end recruitment notices are published in 
Sango, French and English and in the relevant zones concerned. 

1.10.2.4 Conclusion 

The Passendro project will comprise of two phases. Firstly, a construction phase, which will 
last approximately two years. During this period there will be steady increase in the number 
of personnel to a maximum, whereupon it will reduce as the construction nears completion. 
Personnel recruited for this phase will need to understand the limited nature of the work.  

The operational phase which will last until the end of the life-of-mine becomes more 
important towards the end of the construction phase. This is considered to be the more 
permanent work-force. For this reason greater care will be taken when recruiting for this 
period. 

Preference will be given to those personnel involved in the construction phase who have 
shown exceptional initiative and a desire and record of acquiring new skills rapidly.  

1.10.3 Remuneration Policy 

Remuneration will comply with all the legal requirements of the Central African Republic. It 
will also be aligned to the Mining Industry Collective Agreement once this is agreed and 
signed. Any future agreements at an operational level 
that might occur between the company and the workforce will also be considered. 

The Company further aims to have a remuneration policy, which rewards and recognizes 
performance.  

The remuneration for each category of job will reflect the minimum salary scales as defined 
in the Mining Industry Collective Agreement, to ensure that all legal requirements are met. 
The philosophy of the company will be to pay affordable and competitive salaries, which for 



 

Summary 1-56 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

the most part will be defined in the  and will likely exceed these 
prescribed minimum levels. 

1.10.4 Accommodation Policy 

Employees will originate from many different sources, possess different cultural backgrounds 
and levels of skill. For this reason, a housing policy had to be developed which would cater to 
this wide range requirements so as to best match each with a suitable set of conditions. 

The company housing policy is outlined in summary below:- 

1.10.4.1 Expatriates 

These employees who have skills, knowledge or experience that is unavailable in a host 
basis to the 

operation, are housed in international grade housing at the staff camp on the mine property. 
The camp will have central catering and lounge facilities. Contracts will be typically single 
status, with quarterly rotations of three weeks to country of hire. Senior expatriates will have 
family visiting rights. 

1.10.4.2 Senior Managers (Nationals of Host Country)  

Certain senior Managers need to be close to the operation in order to manage emergency 
situations as and when they arise and to manage their responsibilities effectively. Therefore, 
senior Managers of the mine, who are host country nationals, will be housed at the staff 
camp on the mine property. Contracts will be single status, with quarterly rotations to city of 
origin. 

1.10.4.3 National Employees Recruited from Outside the Local Area  

These employees will be provided with housing via a Housing allowance or the provision of 
single status accommodation. To minimize transport costs, mine housing will be located 
close to the mine.  

Mine housing should be located close to an existing village so that the structures will be 
sustainable and form part of the village into the future. This policy also facilitates employees 
taking part in cultural and community religious activities and making use of local 
infrastructure such as markets. 

Such a village will comprise a selection of dwellings and infrastructural support buildings as 
described below. Such a facility will cater for approximately 400 workers:- 

Location  Nguetepe 
 

Single status dwelling 18 m2 per worker: 2 x 9 m2 rooms  brick wall, grout interior

1.10.4.4 National Employees Recruited by the mine from the Local Area 

Employees from local villages will be encouraged to remain in their existing accommodation 
and contribute to the economic well-being of their communities. 

1.10.5 Industrial Relations Policy  

This pertains in particular to the relationship that will exist between the Company 
management and the workforce.  

The Company in its Industrial Relations Policy will follow the CAR Labour Code and all other 
applicable texts and laws. 

The Company also recognizes the right to unions, and union representation of all workers. 

The Company will negotiate an agreement  with the establishment 
of employee representatives which will govern the detailed relationship between the 
company and its employees. It will cover, but not be limited to, such items as: 

Job classifications. 
Equivalent work week for the various job classifications, overtime and holidays. 
Seniority. 
Leave. 
Premiums and indemnities. 
Evaluation and promotion. 
Medical care. 
Recruitment centres.

1.10.6 Safety and Health Policy 

Safety is of prime importance to the Company. The Company will provide safety equipment 
as required by each worker. The requirements of the Labour Law will be adhered to. 

1.10.6.1 Pre-Employment Medical 

Prior to permanent employment the Company will ensure an examination is conducted by its 
 



 

Summary 1-58 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Ensure the employee is not exposed to an unacceptable level of risk through the 
performance of his or her duties. 
Ensure other employees all persons are not exposed to unacceptable risk due to the 
medical condition of the employee.  

 Provide baseline data on the health of employees. 
 
Principles of confidentiality will be observed. 

1.10.6.2 Health Monitoring 

may from time to time monitor the effect of certain aspects of the work environment 
(including but not limited to dust, noise and chemicals) on the health of individual employees. 

Monitoring programs will be developed and implemented in consultation with employees 
concerned. Any information collected as part of the process will be made available to the 
individual and will be treated as confidential.  

1.10.6.3 Medical Facilities 

A single structure medical facility will be built on the mine property, which will cater for minor 
injuries and stabilisation of serious injuries prior to evacuation to a hospital. This facility will 
also cater for periodic medical examinations of employees to detect and prevent the 
development of disease or health impairment as a result of the working environment. The 
clinic will also treat minor ailments but will not provide treatment for chronic conditions. 
Medical records will be maintained for each employee and an active immunisation 
programme will be maintained. A dispensary and a mini medical laboratory will also be 
housed in the same structure. 

Evacuation to a hospital will take place by road in a suitably equipped ambulance or by air 
from the mine's airstrip. 

The mine will employ a doctor and nurses. During the initial construction phase a paramedic 
will be employed on the site, and will be able to call on the services of a Company doctor 
when required. As work progresses a doctor will be made available for the site. 

An evacuation procedure for seriously ill patients will be in place at all phases of construction 
and mining operations. 

1.10.7 Emergency Response Procedure 

It is planned to have an effective emergency response plan in the event of an unplanned 
event, which could result in environmental damage or legal liability for the Company in terms 
of it legal commitments. 

Such an event could be:-  

A potentially hazardous chemical or effluent spill. 
Fire. 
Gaseous emissions. 
Breakout of contaminated workings. 
Pit slope failure. 
Power outage. 
Other emergencies requiring special services e.g. transportation accidents. 

 Natural forces, e.g. major rainfall event or earthquake. 



 

Summary 1-59 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

 
A procedure will be developed so as to provide guidance to ensure that: 

Danger to the environment, personnel, contractors and the public is minimized. 
Legal liability is managed and minimized. 
Public relations are effectively managed during and following an emergency. 

 Reporting is effective and corrective and follow-up actions are implemented. 
 
The procedure will define the responsibilities from management level down to labourer level. 

1.10.8 HIV/AIDS Policy 

The Central African Republic has not escaped the effects of this world-wide phenomenon so 
that there is a significant proportion of the population that already have AIDS or are HIV 
positive. It is therefore urgent to undertake interventions in the general population, reinforced 
by greater focus towards some target groups. 

The Company will continue to exhibit and promote a spirit of fairness and non-discrimination, 
substantiated by the undertakings mentioned below; 

 The Company will not discriminate against qualified people with HIV/AIDS in terms 
of job application, recruitment, promotion, dismissal, salary, training and any other 
job conditions or job privileges. 

 The Company acknowledges that an employee with HIV infection may wish to 
pursue activities compatible with his/her status as well as his/her work.  

 The Company will collaborate with local government institutions, medical facilities, 
and NGOs in the prefecture to ensure medical support to employees capable to fill 
out their position and will adapt their work conditions favourably. Their medical 
background will be held confidentially. 

 The Company will ensure a safe work environment to all its employees. The 
Company will continue to be informed on HIV/AIDS and will communicate regularly 
with its personnel. 
The Company will not require HIV testing during medical examinations prior to hiring 
an applicant. Nevertheless, a voluntary testing procedure will be encouraged.  

 The Company will conduct education interventions to its employees on prevention of 
HIV/AIDS including attitudes and behaviour towards HIV-infected colleagues in 
order to avoid conflict situations at work or discrimination. 

 As a result, the Company has set up an HIV/AIDS committee that will be trained to 
ensure that employees in each department and their communities are informed and 
educated on the HIV infection. The HIV/AIDS committee is made up of the Senior 

al Doctor, Community Relations Officer and 
one Employee Representative for each department. The employees have meetings 
within the departments and the community to pass on the information.

1.10.9.1 Mining Personnel 

It is essential that positions requiring specific skills be filled initially by expatriates, who will 
provide knowledge and experience for the mining operations and will train the lesser 
experienced personnel. It is expected that as the knowledge base increases more local 
personnel will fill more senior and supervisory positions. 

All staff will undergo a mandatory safety induction prior to entering site. Once an appointee 
has been selected for a position a suitably competent person will train that employee, no 
person will be allowed to perform work for which they have not received training. 

Regular refresher training will be provided and will be conditional on returning from leave or 
long absence. 

It will be a policy to train and upgrade CAR personnel to replace expatriate labour over time 
where possible. 

All expatriate staff will be required to work and train local personnel, and pre-employment 
aptitude tests and specialized selection testing will be conducted to ensure that they have the 
necessary ability and willingness to do this. 

1.10.9.2 Plant Operating and Maintenance Personnel 

Again, due to lack of processing skills in Central African Republic, the need for training was 
identified as one of the key elements of the feasibility study and SENET appointed Dan 
Grodzian and the Rigonda Group of Companies to carry out a study on training of the locals, 
who will over time, replace the expatriate personnel.  Dan Grodzian has been involved with 
training and skills development on mines recently commissioned in French speaking West 
African countries. 

A training program outlined in Figure 1-31, is specific to the plant operators but can be used 
for plant maintenance and administration personnel as well.

Summary 1-62 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Important points to note from the training program are: 

The training program will commence during the construction phase some 8 months 
before production and will intensify towards commissioning.  
Every attempt will be made to ensure the training officers are complemented by 
French speaking experienced expatriate operators. 

 Wherever possible the locals employed by the EPCM contractor will be given 
employment opportunities. 

 There is a need to train some locals to be trainers who in turn will be very useful in 
the training of other locals as they understand the culture. 
Suppliers of critical equipment and reagents will be used in specialized training such 
as cyanide safety aspects, operation of mills, maintenance of mills, etc. 

 External consultants will be brought in from time to time to assist the training officers 
to ensure that expatriates are replaced over time. 

 
1.10.10 Community Relations Policy 

The Company recognizes how important it is to co-exist in a harmonious spirit with the 
surrounding community. It is the duty of the Company to facilitate realistic ideas to this end 
and provide a measure of tangible support, so that the entire region might benefit from an 
increased level of economic activity     

In general, the Community Liaison Policy of the Company is based on measures that ensure 
and promote mutual understanding and partnership. 

This policy includes the following aspects: 

The creation of a Public Relations Office with a Community Liaison Officer position to ensure 

stakeholders and that the issues and concerns from the communities are addressed. 

 partnership objectives are as follows: 

The company is here to make a profit with the eventual exploitation and sale of gold. 
 The company will share some of the benefits of the project with:- 

o local communities. 
o governing ministries. 
o n sectors such as health and education. 

 
 In order to make this project work, the company requires, among other things:- 

o Competent, moral manpower. 
o Security in the region. 
o Local agriculture and animal husbandry. 
o Construction materials (wood, bricks). 
o Furniture for offices and houses. 
o Cloth and clothing. 
o Road development from Bangui to Bambari. 

 

involvement and participation, as briefly summarized below:- 

The investigation of the villages and households to determine their standard of 
living, and to assess their concerns regarding the project. 

 The creation of a Community Consultative Committee (CCC) as a close and regular 
community partner. 



 

Summary 1-63 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

The planning of indemnification or compensation for people whose activities may be 
compromised. 
The installation of communication boards in the surrounding villages to ensure that 
all stakeholders are regularly informed and aware of the project activities and 
progress. Consequently accept their feedback and concerns. 
The distribution of Project Information Documents (PID) in both French and Sango, 
and a slide show to explain the Company, its plans, its needs and benefits to the 
community. 

 The establishment of a grievance mechanism that provides the opportunity for 
stakeholders to express their grievances so that the company can manage them 
appropriately. 
The establishment of focus groups to respond to questions and concerns of local 
stakeholders.  

 The encouragement of local market gardening through the purchase of local 
vegetable and fruit produce. 

 
The company will also intensify its communication efforts with stakeholders in national, 
regional and local government, NGOs and other community bodies in the area immediately 
surrounding the Passendro Project. 

Great care will be taken to ensure that expectations within the communities are not inflated, 
which is common to many mining projects, but that when the implementation and operational 
phases finally commence that expectations remain aligned with reality and are understood as 
such. 

There is a recognition that the company will compensate any households in existing 
settlements that need to be relocated. Negotiations regarding these resettlement and 
compensation issues will be attended to by the appropriate judicial authorities and the 
affected communities. 

In addition to the typical grievance procedures that will be in place within the work 
environment, the Company has also put in place a simple mechanism to manage complaints 
from the community. Grievances that remain unresolved after this will be transferred to the 
courts by one of the parties. 

1.10.11 Security Policy 

A workforce and community must be able to co-exist in a secure environment. The 
development of this mine may result in an influx of persons to the surrounding area whose 
expectations will include that of an increased beneficial position due to directly obtaining 
employment with the mine or simply benefiting from the inherent spin-off gains. It is certain 
that not all expectations will be satisfied, which may lead to a certain amount of discontent. 
Whilst every attempt will be made to educate all to a realistic vision of expectations, it is clear 
that an increased security presence in the area will be of benefit to all. Tasks to be covered 
by a security presence will include:-  

Increased policing presence. 
Protection of assets. 
Protection of the community from being exposed to inherent mine risks e.g.. blasting 
and hazardous chemicals. 

 Gold escort. 
 



 

Summary 1-64 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

The above issues therefore require a security policy that is both integrated yet seamless, 
which seeks to address each and every aspect of the implementation, operational and 
closure stages of the Passendro Project. 

AXMIN propose to have the following security arrangements in place; 

In-house senior Security Manager. 
 Contractor-sourced mine security force, whose purpose will be the security within 

the mine perimeter.  
Increased Gendarmerie presence in the area. 
It is possible that the CAR authorities will require the presence of a small military 
contingent o protect the explosives that will be used in mining operations. 

 Local personnel will likely be recruited for further low-key security services. 
 
AXMIN further propose to abide by the following principles when drawing up the 
encompassing security elements;  

Consultation of professional services. 
Training. 

 Communication  with government, community liaison officer, and between the 
different layers of security arms in place. 
Transparency. 

 Consideration of Voluntary Principles which includes observation of IFC 
Performance Standard 4. 

 
1.10.12 Conclusion  

 whislt at the same 
time complying with the relevant laws of the country. 

 
1.10.13 Manpower Summary 

In order to effectively manage the operations at Passendro, the labour schedule was drawn 
up by assuming three main areas; mining, processing and administration. These three main 
areas were in turn broken down into the respective disciplines. Table 1-18 gives a summary 
of the total labour complement. 



 

Summary 1-65 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Table 1-18 Total Labour Complement for the Passendro Project 

 
 

In developing the Passendro staffing levels the following assumptions were made: 

 2 x 12 hour shift operation per day, 7 days a week for mining labour and supervisory 
staff. Management, technical and maintenance staff for mining will work day shift 
only. 

 3 x 8 hour shift operation per day, 7 days a week for the process plant operators and 
supervisory staff. Management, technical and maintenance staff for the process 
plant will work day shift only. 
Fly in and fly out on a 10 weeks in and 3 weeks out roster for all the expatriate 
labour  

 1 x 8 hour shift operation, 5 days a week for most of the general and administration 
staff. 

 
Due to lack of experienced personnel in Central African Republic, it was assumed that 
expatriates will be employed in the majority of managerial and supervisory positions for the 
first three years of the operation and these will be replaced with the locals who will have 
undergone training.  

Where possible, expatriate labour was further split into two categories on the basis of level of 
skill and management experience. Senior managers constituted the higher cost top 
management tier, whereas suitable middle manager or foreman level and artisans were 
thought to be able to be sourced from other African and Asian countries, where their skills 
have already been well developed due to existing operations there.   

1.10.13.1 General and Administration 

The total general and administration complement is estimated to be 213 in the general 
management, accounts, human resources, warehouse & logistics, safety & health, training, 
security, camp general maintenance and environmental departments. A labour summary is 
given in Table 1-19.

1.10.13.2 Mining 

The manpower requirement for the mining and associated operations has been based upon 
the equipment required to achieve the production schedule at the productivities and 
performances already described. A mining superintendent will head the mining operations, 
technical services and maintenance. Table 1-20 is a summary of the labour requirements for 
mining operations, geology and grade control, mining engineering and mining maintenance.  

There will be a requirement for a substantial amount of expatriate workers, initially to 
commission and operate the mining equipment, and then to identify and train the local 
workforce utilising on-the-job methods.  

During the initial preparation period the labour compliment is expected to total 249 mining 
personnel, engaged in the mining operations, the maintenance of the mining equipment, the 
support and technical staff and management. Eighteen of these positions will require 
expatriate personnel, three of which will form the management team and fifteen the 
operational trainers and technical leaders. 

The total labour compliment is expected to rise to just over 300 mining personnel by the Year 
2 of production. The three management positions will remain as expatriates, whilst with the 
shadowing and training of local labour is anticipated that only four other expatriate positions 
will remain.

Summary 1-68 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.11 ONSITE INFRASTRUCTURE 

The selected Passendro site is a green field site without any existing infrastructure except for 
the existing Ndassima Exploration camp. Some laterite roads exist providing access to local 
villages scattered around the area. The proposed infrastructure will support the mining and 
plant operation. Where possible, facilities will be integrated so that they can be used by 
mining and processing groups.  

1.11.1 Mining Infrastructure 

The infrastructure required to support the mining operations have been designed to provide 
integrated facilities for both the mining and processing areas such as canteen, change 
houses and fuel storage. 

The main mining administrative block includes a separate area for the general offices and 
working areas for the mining department and associated services.  

The following infrastructure has been allowed for in the mining facilities:- 

Main workshop and repair facilities, to maintain the fleet of haul trucks and major 
mining equipment. 
Auxiliary workshop, housing the drill rig repair shop, the tyre repair services and the 
minor equipment, such as light vehicles. 
Mining equipment re-fuelling centre. 

 Explosive storage, which will be located away from the main facilities. 
 
Raw materials, such as ammonium nitrate and/or explosive emulsions, fuel oil and primary 
explosives used in the explosive manufacturing process will be brought to site by road, and 
stored until required.  

1.11.2 Plant and Administration Infrastructure 

1.11.2.1 In-plant Roads 

Granular surfaced in-plant roads, 5 m wide, complete with drainage facilities will be provided 
to enable access to all the warehouses, workshops, process plant and power station. 

1.11.2.2 Buildings 

A dedicated plant control room located on top of the CIL tanks will be provided and this will 
house the SCADA system and will provide operators an elevated view of the entire plant.  

A security office and change house will be constructed at the access to the plant which will 
have a clean / dirty change house fitted with lockers, showers and ablutions. There will be a 
security search zone located between the clean and dirty sides of the change house. The 
security search zone will provide the security personnel the means to do individual body 
searches, isolation rooms and general scanning. In addition a first aid room will also be part 
of this building. The main access gate to the plant will also form part of the security building 
as this will enable control of vehicle access to the plant via airlocks and interlocked gates. 

A workshop equipped with two indoor mobile equipment repair bays complete with all the 
tools required for a workshop of this nature and a 5 tonne overhead travelling crane will be 
provided to enable repair of process plant equipment. Offices for warehouse, maintenance 
and planning personnel will be provided as part of this building. In addition a small vehicle 



 

Summary 1-69 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

repair bay and one outdoor wash bay equipped with high pressure water monitors and a 
sloped concrete pad to an oil/water separator.  

The administration building will be of a single-storey prefabricated panel construction. The 
buildings will include general areas for engineering, geology and administration personnel 
and offices for the General Manager, Mine Manager, Plant Superintendent, Administration 
Superintendent, Chief Geologist, Chief Engineer and Security Chief. The mining and geology 
offices will be in a single building adjacent to the administration offices. 

A fully equipped assay laboratory will be included on the plant site. The laboratory will 
perform daily analysis of mining and process samples. The laboratory will be a single-storey 
structure. 

Three warehouses will be provided to store all general items including plant spares, lime and 
cyanide and other plant reagents. Where required these warehouses will be equipped with 5-
tonne overhead cranes to enable easy movement of goods. 

1.11.2.3 Sewerage Treatment 

Sewerage treatment will be through biological treatment plant technologies for both the plant 
and camp. This technology has been selected over others due to the fact that it can 
withstand fluctuating loads that normally take place during shift change-over.  Both the camp 
and plant sites at the mine will each have an independent sewage treatment plant capable of 
handling the waterborne waste generated by about 200 persons per site. The final effluent of 
these plants will comply with either local standards or a suitable international standard e.g. 
SA General Standard for Discharge as published in Regulation No. 991 of 18 May 1984.  

1.11.2.4 Water Services 

To provide a source of start-up water for plant operation and a secure emergency storage 
facility and to supplement the process raw water makeup demand for normal uninterrupted 
plant operations, a 1.5 million m3 capacity Water Storage Dam (WSD) will be developed as 
part of the Passendro Gold Project. 

Raw water stored in the reservoir will be pumped to the process plant for make-up 
operations. Only a maximum of 83% of the water volume discharged to the Tailings 
Management Facility (TMF) will be reclaimed from the TMF supernatant pond. The balance 
of the plant water requirements will be raw water abstracted from either the Baceta River or 
the WSD. During the dry season, when return water from the supernatant pond is reduced 
further, additional make up water requirements for the process plant will be abstracted from 
the WSD. To maintain a suitable retention volume within the WSD, fresh water will be 
seasonally pumped from the Baceta River into the reservoir. 

1.11.2.5 Potable Water Distribution 

Raw water will be supplied to the potable water treatment plant through boreholes around the 
vicinity of the camp area. The treatment plant will be located at the camp-site, as this area 
will be the main consumer of potable water. Fresh water supplied by boreholes will be 
treated and stored in a lined, above-ground potable water storage tank adjacent to the fresh 
water tank. The plant will be designed to supply 5m3/hr of potable water. 



 

Summary 1-70 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.11.2.6 Fire Water 

There will be an electric and diesel powered fire water pumping system. The electric 
powered pump will be used in the event of a fire and the diesel pump will be a back up in 
case electrical power is not available. A jockey pump will be provided to maintain the 
pressure in the fire water header during normal plant runs. An alarm will be sounded at the 
plant site for low system pressure. 

The fire water system will consist of a buried fire water loop and hydrant system at the plant 
site and ancillary buildings and at the process plant. Hose cabinets will be placed at the fire 
hydrant locations and the system supplemented with portable fire extinguishers placed within 
the process facilities. The administration building and mine dry and canteen will have 
sprinkler systems. 

A complete self-contained fire alarm system will be installed in all buildings to meet the 
relevant  

1.11.2.7 Communications 

A satellite communication system is envisaged to provide communication for the project 
unless one of the mobile telephone providers installs a system in the area of the mine.  

The system will, through a host of hardware and servers, provide e-mail access to the 
operational force. There will be controlled and monitored Internet Access, as well as 
telephony around the mine and to the outside world. Phone communication will be via Voice 
Over Internet Protocol (VOIP). 

The system will manage data transfer in such a way that large files transfers will not affect 
phone communication. 

1.11.2.8 Security 

Both the plant and camp site will be surrounded with a 2.4 m fence topped with 0.5m high 
razor wire in order to keep range animals and unauthorized people off the plant site. Normal 
access to the plant site and expatriate camp will be restricted to one access at the main gate, 
which will be equipped with a gatehouse manned 24 hours per day. Other emergency access 
gates will be provided for but will be kept locked at all times. 

A similar 2.8 m high chain link security fence will be erected around the process plant and 
ponds, substations and explosive storage areas. 

Gold bullion bars will be transported by means of a pick-up vehicle to the landing strip once a 
week. 

Furthermore, the plant will be fitted with CCTV cameras installed at strategic locations, 
minimising the amount of cameras to be installed.  

1.11.2.9 Transport 

Plant personnel will be transported to from the surrounding villages as well as from the main 
plant camp by busses. Light vehicles will supplement the busses if required. 

1.11.2.10 Air Strip 

An airstrip will be constructed to the South of the process plant. It will be designed to have a 
length of approximately 2.8 km by 45 m wide.  



 

Summary 1-71 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.11.2.11 Staff Housing 

A permanent camp will be constructed to house senior and junior staff members who will 
mainly comprise of expatriates. The senior staff accommodation which will consist of pre-
fabricated modular 2 to 4 bedroomed housing units (depending on seniority) will cater for 47 
people being senior and middle management. A four bedroomed guest house will be located 
in this camp to cater for visitors. 

The junior camp section will form an integral part of the complex and will house 43 persons. 

Located in a central position will be the canteen, entertainment area, gym, laundry, infirmary, 
camp office and guard house facilities.  

A further operations camp will be developed at Nguetepe and the village will comprise a 
selection of dwellings and infrastructural support buildings. Such a facility will cater for 
approximately 400 workers and will be equipped with 8 water wells for the supply of water 
and a 250 kVA and power will be supplied from gensets. 

1.11.3 Power Supply and Distribution 

1.11.3.1 Power Supply 

The sizing of the power supply system was based on a typical instantaneous installed motor 
power demand of 10.455 MW, which excluded standby motors. This load was determined by 
taking into account the process loads of the process plant, ancillary building loads including 
the workshops, warehouses, mining infrastructural requirements, administration buildings, 
staff camps and the village where locals will be housed.    

Two power generation options were looked at during the study, heavy fuel oil and diesel. 
Operating costs were used as criteria to select the power generation means, which 
effectively became heavy fuel oil. 

The Wartsila power plant consisting of 3 x 12V32 engines will be supplied complete with a 
fuel tank yard, HFO treatment equipment, lubrication facility, electrical distribution switchgear 
and other requirements associated with such a plant (such as black starts, diesel standby 
gensets, cooling system, fume exhaustion, compressed air system, fire fighting, water 
treatment). The gensets will be designed to supply 15,638 kWe at the generator terminal 
based which will allow for plant start ups. Once the plant is in steady state running mode, 
only two engines need to be operated with the third one acting as a standby. 

1.11.3.2 Power Distribution 

A 6.6 kV overhead power line from the power plant will feed power to various destinations 
and step down outdoor oil filled transformers, from 6.6 kV to 415V will be installed close to 
the area of use. Power distribution to SAG mill VSD and Ball mill motor will be done at 6.6kV. 

The process building and power system modules will generally include outdoor oil-filled 
-

type transformers local circuitry 415 V, one-phase distribution panels and local control 
devices. All electrical distribution will be in cable trays using armour interlocked PVC coated 
cables. 



 

Summary 1-72 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

The process and plant site ancillary facilities switchgear and electrical equipment will be 
installed in modular electrical rooms adjacent to or within their respective buildings where 
economically feasible. 

In non-process areas, such as the administration building, dry/canteen, sewage treatment 
plant, fuel storage facility, water tanks and workshop complex, a combination of armoured-
type cable and rigid galvanized steel conduit and wire system will be used in exposed areas. 

Motor control centres will be complete with motor starters, contactors, disconnect switches, 
transformers, panels, circuit breakers and fuses. 

1.11.3.3 Fuel Storage and Distribution 

Total diesel and heavy fuel oil (180cSt) consumptions for the entire mine were determined to 
be 880 m3 and 1500 m3 per month respectively. The fuel storage facility was then sized to 
store supplies of each fuel type equivalent to two months. Heavy fuel oil will be stored in 2 x 
1500 m3 tanks equipped complete with loading, metering, heating, treatment and dispensing 
facilities while diesel will be stored in 2 x 1000 m3 tanks complete with loading, metering and 
dispensing equipment. 

Transport of HFO from Bangui to the plant site is assumed to take place in unheated tankers, 
since it is assumed that the high ambient temperature of 38°C will maintain the HFO in a fluid 
form and prevent solidification. Diesel fuel will be delivered to the site by tanker truck. 

Lubricants will be delivered to the site in drums. The drums will be stored in a secure area. 
The lubricants will be distributed to hose reels in the truck shop service bay with barrel 
pumps. 

Diesel fuel requirements for the mining equipment and process and ancillary facilities will be 
supplied from a diesel fuel storage tank located at the truck shop. Diesel fuel distribution will 
be limited to loading and unloading facilities and metering equipment at the diesel fuel tank.

1.12 OFF SITE INFRASTRUCTURE & LOGISTICS 

Importing goods and equipment into Central African Republic would involve crossing two 
international borders which in itself presents challenges associated with customs and excise. 
The problems are further compounded by lack of infrastructure in this region of Africa. It was 
thus realised at the early stages of the study that executing the logistics of the project will be 
difficult, and the logistics train will have to:  

Identify access route to site. 
Identify port facilities and capabilities at point of discharge. 
Determine most efficient routing and method of transport to site. 
Determine road / bridge upgrade requirements to ensure the safe delivery of all 
shipments. 
Investigate project insurance requirements. 
Determine total logistics budget to complete the movement to site of all project 
cargo. 
Complete a methodology to enable control of all movements. 
Establish a shipping procedure specific to the project. 
Identify staff resource requirements along the supply chain and at project site.  

 Determine customs and excise requirements in the CAR and the effect on project 
programme / budget.  

 
1.12.1 Routing 

Three route options were considered as follows: 

Durban to Douala by sea and Douala to site by road freight. 
Durban to Matadi by sea, Matadi to Kinsasha via road or rail, Kinshasa to Bangui by 
barge and Bangui to site via road. 

 Johannesburg to Bangui via chartered aircraft and airfreight. 
 
Based on economic considerations and practicalities the Durban-Douala-site route shown in 
Figures 1-32 and 1-33 was selected and the main portion of the transport and logistics study 
was focused on this route.

The port of Douala has been selected as the base port for the study. Douala is the capital 
and principal port of Cameroon. The port has a rated capacity of 7.5 million tonnes per 
annum with road and rail link facilities to Central African Republic. The port is served by 40 
foreign flags which ensure the connection with other ports located on the five continents 
making it easier to import capital equipment, reagents, consumables and spares from any 
port in the world. 

1.12.2.1 Transit Time 

It was established from the study that it will take approximately 56 days to transport cargo 
from Durban to site as shown in Figure 1-34 and due to poor road conditions, where 
possible, cargo must be moved in dry season. Due to the long distance from port to site, it is 
recommended that cargo be transported in convoy, with escort vehicle equipped with repair 
and maintenance kits and communication equipment.

1.12.3 Road and Bridge Survey 

A road and bridge survey was carried out between Bangui and site. Two possible routes to 
site, Bangui to site via Ippy and Bangui to site via Kombele were surveyed. The Bangui to 
Kombele route was considered as the more feasible option as it will be about 90 kilometres 
shorter than the other one. 

However this route crosses Baidou River, which is currently being serviced by a pontoon 
ferry with a capacity of about 12-15 tonnes. It is envisaged that the ferry operation would be 
replaced by a concrete bridge that will enable heavier loads to pass along this road. It will 
make the journey shorter, resulting in a discount on transport costs. The cost of the bridge 
will be offset against the lower transport costs. 

In addition there are 6 small bridges that are not wide enough to accommodate the trucks 
intended to be used that will be replaced by permanent low-maintenance structures such as 
multiple cell reinforced concrete box culverts. The costs for the Baidou Bridge and another 
six small bridges have been included in the capital cost estimate. 

1.12.4 Method of Costing 

The total tonnage to be shipped during the project phase was determined and in order to 
reduce total costs the estimate has been calculated using a combination of shipping methods 
i.e. appointing dedicated charter vessels in addition to utilizing scheduled containerized 
vessels into Douala.  

In coming up with project cargo schedules, it was noted that due to the weight/volume ratio 
the most cost effective form of transport would be to combine the transportation of structural 
steel cargo with mechanical equipment that has a high volume ratio.  



 

Summary 1-77 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

The SAG and Ball Mill will be transported on a dedicated charter vessel in sections to Douala 
and in convoy from Douala to site.  

The most effective transport method for all the piping and valves would be break bulk cargo 
due to the volume constraints.  

To obtain the optimum ratio of weight volume and therefore minimise shipping costs 
containers would be packed with a mixture of high volume and high tonnage cargo. 

1.12.5 Documentation 

 of the 
project to be met, a written guide and plan will be a requisite to enable better understanding 
of how the logistics will be performed. This logistics execution plan will outline the 
responsibilities of all stakeholders (contractor / company / suppliers / other interested parties) 
and will indicate how cargo management and control from time of receipt by the contractor to 
time of delivery is to be achieved. A comprehensive project logistics and execution plan was 
developed during the study.

1.13 MINE CLOSURE AND SUSTAINABILITY 

1.13.1 Introduction 

The Company will seek to diligently apply the principles of a conscientious closure plan 
which seeks to ensure that the mine is closed in a safe manner extending into the future, but 
at the same time adopt further principles of sustainability, wherever possible.  

The intention is to do more than 'Design for Closure', but also prepare 'Post-Mining 
Sustainable Use Plans for the mine site and affected area.  

In planning for closure, there are four key objectives that were as follows; 

Protect public health and safety. 
Eliminate as far as possible any environmental damage.  
Attempt to achieve a productive use of the area or a reasonable return to its original 
condition.  

 Where possible, provide for sustainability of social and economic benefits resulting 
from mine development and operations.  

 
Elements that can have potential impacts can be summarized as follows; 

 Physical Stability  buildings and structures selected to remain, workings, pit 
slopes, underground openings, etc. must be stable and not move so as to eliminate 
any hazard to the public health and safety. 

 Geochemical Stability - minerals, metals and 'other' contaminants must be stable, 
that is, must not leach and / or migrate into the receiving environment at 
concentrations that are harmful. Weathering oxidation and leaching processes must 
not transport contaminants in excessive concentrations into the environment. This 
applies to both surface waters and groundwater. All polluted areas must be 
remediated.  

 Land Use - the closed mine site should be rehabilitated to pre-mining conditions or 
conditions where possible that are compatible with the surrounding lands or 
achieves an agreed alternative productive land use. 

 Sustainable Development - elements of mine development that contribute to the 
sustainability of social and economic benefit and post mining should be maintained 
and transferred where possible. 

  
Once the initial plan has been developed and is accepted, it will be regularly updated to 
ensure that the plan remains current and optimized.  

1.13.2 Indicators 

In order for regulators, the mining company and other stakeholders to evaluate the success 
and reliability of closure measures, definition of appropriate indicators will be made during 
closure planning.  

These will be related, amongst other things, to the following;  

Surface and groundwater quality. 
Long term stability of structures remaining on site  

 Land use and aesthetics - On completion of the closure and rehabilitation program, 
ecologically functional and stable landforms which are visually acceptable should be 
returned to the community. 



 

Summary 1-79 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

 Social and economic impacts related to a potential reduction in economic potential 
of an area and the potential long term burden placed on future generations related 
to post mining maintenance.  

 Economic consequences.  
 

1.13.3 Rehabilitation Objectives  

Mining projects are typically divided into components during closure and rehabilitation 
planning.  

Typical mining site components Include:-  

Open pits.  
 Rock dumps.  

Tailings impoundment systems.  
Water management.  
Buildings and equipment.  
Landfills and other wastes.  

 Infrastructure.  
 
A series of rehabilitation objectives and measures require to be addressed in the three broad 
categories as outlined above including Physical Stability, Chemical Stability -and Land Use  

Based on the above principles a general plan for rehabilitation has been proposed in Table 
1-22. 

Table 1-22 General Rehabilitation Plan 
STRUCTURE FATE REHABILITATION REQUIRED 

Open Pits Remain/Remove Consider backfilling where possible. The final pit slopes will be 
conditionally stable and it will be necessary to fill them with water at the 
same rate as the natural water table rises. 

The development of pit lakes is considered the preferred alternative from 
both technical and economic considerations.  

Rock Piles/Waste 
Dumps 

Remain Re-contouring  to prevent erosion and landslides, topsoil spreading and 
re-vegetation. 

Tailings 
Management 
Facility 

Remain Topsoil spreading and re-vegetation. Ongoing monitoring of piezometers, 
water boreholes etc. 

Water Dam Remain Consideration will be given to transferring this to the local population as a 
useful asset. Periodic monitoring will be required. 

Buildings and 
Equipment 

Remain/Remove The principle will be that usable materials or buildings will be removed 
and buried or salvaged, else remaining structures brought to ground level 
and removed with foundations down to 1 m below surface. Topsoil will be 
applied and re-vegetation undertaken. 

Landfills & Other 
Wastes 

Remain The principles of re-contouring, application of topsoil and re-vegetation 
will be applied here 

Infrastructure Remain/Remove 
Before commencing demolition of water supply wells and buildings at the 
site, discussions will be held with the local communities to determine 
their interest in receiving these facilities for use in community social or 
economic development activities.  

   
1.13.3.1 Audits and Reviews 

Technical Audits and Reviews will be completed in order to review the safety, stability and 
environmental liability of mine facilities such as tailings systems and waste dumps, to identify 
the safety, stability and environmental liability risks of each structure and to provide 



 

Summary 1-80 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

recommendations for the improvement of safety measures and procedures to enable 
appropriate international standards to be achieved.  

These Audits and Reviews will typically be completed by independent professional 
specialists and will consist of the following:  

Information collection.  
Field inspection.  
Review of the operating history and compliance of the facility, operating plans, 
management systems, emergency response plans and closure plans. 
Identification of the relevant risks.  
Development of recommendations to mitigate the risks.  

 Reporting.  
 
1.13.4 Custodial Transfer - Sustainability 

Mining is a temporary use of the land. The succeeding custodian's (and associated 
stakeholders) interest is in the continued sustainable use of the land and commences only 
when the Closure Plan is completed. Custodial transfer of mined land and post mining 
requires inclusion of a 'Post-Mining Sustainable Use Plan' as part of the 'Closure Plan'.  

The Company will actively look to address the issues of sustainability with respect to physical 
issues as well as social issues so that if undertaken successfully, then the environment for 
progress towards sustainability of the surrounding communities of interest will be optimised. 

1.13.4.1 Physical Issues 

a. Infrastructure 

On-site infrastructure will likely be of limited use after closure but office buildings could be 
used for administrative purposes by the local authority.  

Housing for staff will be provided in an area where the local authority will not be significantly 
impacted by the loss of service payments and rates if applicable if a large proportion of the 
workforce leaves the area after closure. The village selected for housing AXMIN
workforce will already have a diversified economy, so that there is less likelihood of 
destabilising the property market and of a boom or bust situation developing during 
operations.  

Whilst the main HFO power station will be removed, it is possible that some form of 
sustainable local solar or hydro power provision will already be in place which could be used 
sustainably for lighting particularly for those areas where it is deemed suitable, e.g. public 
areas.  

b. Transportation 

Any new roads and bridges will be handed over to the relevant communities, wherever it is 
agreed by both parties that it will serve as a sustainable benefit.  

c. Water 

AXMIN has undertaken to sink boreholes to supply some of the closer local communities with 
water.  The necessary skills will be put in place to ensure the continuing functioning of any 
such infrastructure installed by the Company. 



 

Summary 1-81 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

d. Services 

The provision of water and electricity to the communities has been discussed above. There is 
a possibility that the Kembe hydro-electric scheme could come to fruition during the mine life. 
The Company will co-operate with the local authority so that both they and the mine could 
ensure a benefit, both during and after the mine life. 

1.13.4.2 Social Issues 

a. Skilled or Unskilled Labour Force 

To further enhance the sustainability of employment at Passendro, skills training in 
alternative forms of livelihood may be provided, particularly when retrenchment is envisaged. 

b. Retrenchment 

Clearly a mine has a finite life and the labour force will need to acquire alternative 
employment upon closure of the mine. The Company will abide by the laws of the Central 
African Republic and its Labour Code with respect to the orderly retrenchment of the 
Passendro labour force. The procedure will follow the subsequent basic steps:- 

The Company will request approval from the Inspector of Labour for a collective 
dismissal due to a suspension of activities. 
Approval is granted subject to investigation by the Government Inspector. 

 The Company pays to the employees their lawful rights (leave, notice, compensation 
of dismissal) in accordance with the text of the Labour Laws and the 

. 
Minutes of the meeting are captured by the Government Inspector at the end of 
procedure. 

 The Company issues an employment certificate to the employees. 
 
The payments as set out in the ement for retrenchment compensation are 
calculated as follows: - 

For a work period from 3 to 5 years  ½ months salary 
For a work period from 5 to 7 years  1 months salary 
For a work period from 7 to 10 years 2 months salary 
For a work period from 10 to 15 years 3 months salary 
For a work period from 15 to 20 years 4 months salary 

 For a work period beyond 20 years  6 months salary. 
 

c. Medical 

Employees will have medical aid benefits and therefore the workforce will not impact 
significantly on the capacity of any state hospitals and clinics during the life of the mine. Post 
closure, it is likely that the mine medical facilities may be left as a benefit for the community. 
This is also complemented by some of the staff who will have already been trained during 
their tenure and could conceivably continue to provide a sustainable service going forward 
under the local authority.  

d. Schooling 

The Company will be encouraging single status accommodation for skilled and imported 
personnel. It is unlikely that there will be any large impact as a result of the requirements of 
the local workforce for schooling of their children on the existing capacity of school facilities

in the area. Nevertheless, the Company will address any issues through the already 
established community committees to deal with the various social impacts that might arise.    

1.13.5 Financial Implications 

The Company has made provision for the capital involved with its closure and rehabilitation 
plan. Whilst actions relating to closure and their associated costs have been discussed in 
other sections, Table 1-23 summarises that which has been provided for and its source

1.14 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 

1.14.1 Introduction 

Golder Associates (UK) Ltd were appointed to perform an Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessment (ESIA). This section of the Feasibility Study describes the environmental and 
socio-economic context for development of the Passendro Project (the Project). It explains 
AXMIN -economic practice, the regulatory 
context for Project development and the ESIA process to be applied to the Project. The ESIA 
will be a stand alone document issued separately from this report. 

1.14.1.1 AXMIN Environmental and Socio-Economic Approach 

AXMIN
Environmental, Health and Safety Policy for the construction and operational phases of the 
Project, outlines the individual and collective responsibility that staff and representatives of 
the company must take towards health, safety and environmental issues. The importance of 
community engagement is also highlighted in the current Code of Conduct.  

AXMIN  is possible to carry out operations such that there 

optimize safety in the workplace.  

AXMIN has and is in the process of further developing a Human Resources policy and a 
policy on HIV specific to the Project.  

1.14.1.2 Regulatory Context 

AXMIN lation and 
also follow the guidelines of the Equator Principles and the World Bank Group.  

a. CAR Regulatory Requirements 

The Mining Code and associated decree of the CAR require that an ESIA be completed and 
approved prior to commencement of Project construction. Terms of Reference (ToR) for the 
Passendro Gold Mine Project were developed and issued during 2007 following negotiation 
with and approval from the CAR government. The ToR ensure that the ESIA conforms to 
relevant CAR laws and regulations, the Mining Code and associated decree as well as the 
draft CAR Environmental Code and international standards of good practice for gold mining.  

In order to make sure that the local community had strong input into the Project, AXMIN 
initiated discussions with local stakeholders in July 2005 during the exploration phase of the 
Project. Further consultations have been held, both formally and informally, since then. 
Issues of concern and suggestions identified by local stakeholders were considered in 
development of the ToR. The ToR requires the ESIA to explain: 

 the potential environmental and social impacts of the Project throughout the full 
development cycle  from exploration through construction, operation, closure and 
post-closure. 

 a public consultation and disclosure plan to ensure that local communities and other 
key stakeholder are informed of the Project and have an opportunity to express their 
opinions concerning the Project. 

 proposed mitigation activities to minimise adverse impacts. 



 

Summary 1-84 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

 the nature and significance of residual impacts (those adverse impacts that occur 
after mitigation has been applied) and ongoing monitoring and management plans to 
address these.  

 a closure plan to ensure that proper reclamation and rehabilitation of the site occurs 
after the mine ceases operation. 
a social development plan to maximise benefits to the local community and promote a 
sustainable economy. 

 International Standards. 
 
Fifty-
Equator Principles (July 2006) as an industry benchmark, in order to ensure that projects are 
financed and developed in a manner that is socially responsible and reflect sound 
environmental management practices.  

For projects that are located in non-OECD countries or countries that are not designated as 
-

Principles use the IFC Performance Standards and Environmental Health and Safety 
Guidelines as the benchmark standards for environmental and social performance. The 
Performance Standards are listed below: 

Performance Standard 1: Social and Environmental Assessment and Management 
System. 
Performance Standard 2: Labour and Working Conditions. 
Performance Standard 3: Pollution Prevention and Abatement 

 Performance Standard 4: Community Health, Safety and Security. 
Performance Standard 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. 

 Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural 
Resource Management. 
Performance Standard 7: Indigenous Peoples. 

 Performance Standard 8: Cultural Heritage. 
 
Performance standards are referenced as appropriate in the different environmental and 
socio-economic sections of the ESIA. 

1.14.2 ESIA Process 

As noted above, the ESIA is being prepared in accordance with the ToR for the Passendro 
Gold Mine Project.  

1.14.2.1 Environmental Assessment Methods 

The impact assessment includes both environmental and social assessments and consists of 
six main steps: 

 Assessment of the scope of issues through consultation and professional expertise. 
This involves identification of project activities that could contribute to environmental 
change. 
Evaluation of the potential effects. 

 Description of mitigation measures inherent in the project design; these measures 
have been developed during analysis of alternatives and additional discussions 



 

Summary 1-85 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

between the engineering and the ESIA teams throughout the project planning 
process; 
Impact analysis and characterisation of residual effects. 

 As necessary, identification of monitoring to evaluate and track performance. 
 
Mitigation applies to the construction, operations, closure and post-closure Project phases to 
minimize or eliminate potential adverse effects and, where possible, enhance environmental 
quality. The ESIA will use the following tools and procedures to analyze and address 
potential Project impacts: 

 Quantitative and qualitative information on the existing baseline environmental and 
socioeconomic conditions. 

 Predictive tools (models) and methods to quantitatively and qualitatively describe 
future environmental and socioeconomic conditions. 

 Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the significance of potential effects, 
including reference to management objectives, baseline conditions and the views of 
AXMIN and stakeholders. 

 Characterisation of potential residual effects after the application of mitigation and 
their consequences for the environment. 

 
Key to the mitigation strategy is the environmental and social design of the Project. The 
AXMIN engineering design team have worked with the environmental and social teams 
during Project planning to develop solutions to avoid or minimise potential impacts at the 
planning stage. This has produced a Project description which is the subject of assessment 
and reporting. The ESIA report will be provided separately from this Feasibility Study.

1.15 CAPEX AND OPEX COST ESTIMATE 

1.15.1 Capital Costs 

The capital cost estimate for the Passendro Project is based on an owner operated open pit 
mine feeding a process plant located in the Central African Republic. The mine is designed 
to process 3 million tonnes per annum using conventional grinding and carbon-in-leach (CIL) 
processing method to produce approximately 203,000 oz per annum of gold. The total 
estimated cost of bringing the project into production is US$ 201,468,181 and is inclusive of 
10% contingency and working capital as summarized in the table below. In addition 
sustaining capital costs have been shown below the construction capital.  

The capital costs estimate in the Table 1-24 exclude any costs for feasibility studies 
scheduled prior to the start of basic engineering. The level of accuracy of the capital cost 
estimate is within the 10% to 15% of the overall project costs as of 4th quarter 2007 and does 
not include any escalation factors.

 The remaining 11% of costs are distributed amongst de-watering, grade control, soil 
stripping, restoration works and other smaller items. 

 
1.15.7 Processing Plant Operating Costs 

The annual process plant operating costs for the life of the mine for the Passendro Project 
are summarized in Table 1-31. The estimated costs were based on the prices of reagents 
and consumables obtained in the 4th quarter of 2007, annual processed throughput of about 
3 million tones. 

Operating cost for individual ores (oxides, transition and sulphides) were determined and 
using this information, weighted mean costs were generated taking into account the ratios in 
which the ores will be treated as provided by the mining and production schedule developed 
by SRK.  

Escalation, depreciation and taxation were not taken into account in compiling the operating 
costs. In addition, no contingencies were allowed for in the estimate of operating costs as 
there is high level of confidence in the reagent consumptions determined during testwork and 
the subsequent quotations from the suppliers. Refer to Table 1-31 for the overall process 
LOM costs 

Table 1-31 Overall Process Costs LOM 

 
 
1.15.8 General & Administration Operating Costs 

General and administration costs were estimated to be US$6.544 million per annum. These 
costs cater for administration labour which has been derived from first principles and a range 
of other costs associated with administration such as camp costs, office supplies, 
telephones, computers, safety supplies, clinic supplies, vehicles, insurance, etc as 
summarized in the table below. In addition assay costs were estimated at US$1.271 million 
per annum to cover grade control, plant and environmental samples as summarised in Table

Summary 1-93 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

1.16 MARKETING AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 

Passendro Project economics has been evaluated using the discounted cashflow method, by 
taking into account year on year milled tonnages and grades for the ore and the associated 
recoveries, gold price (revenue), operating costs, bullion transport and refining charges, 
royalties and capital expenditure (both initial and sustaining). The project has been evaluated 
as stand-alone and 100% equity financed, with no debt financing. 

The key assumptions used in the financial analysis are: 

Gold Price:  A gold price of US$750 per ounce was assumed  
 Construction Capital Expenditure:  Capital expenditure payments have been 

assumed to be 30% and 70% in Project Years 0 and 1 respectively that is 30% in 
the first 12 months and the balance in the following 12 months for the 24 month 
project duration.  

 Royalties:  The Bambari property is subject to a royalty payable to the government 
on production, which is currently set at 2.25% by law and is confirmed at this level in 
the Convention signed between the Government of Central African Republic and La 
Société Aurafrique SARL on the 30th of January 2006. In addition the Bambari 
property is subject to a 2% net smelter royalty 

Payment of the NSR will commence once all capital expenditures have been 
recovered by Aurafrique. Commencing one year from the date of commencement of 
the first commercial production and until such time as all capital expenditures have 
been recovered URL will annually receive advance royalty payments of 
Cdn$500,00, payable in cash or spares, for each 0.5% royalty interest during the 
initial five years of production from the Bambari property. Aurafrique has elected to 
pay Cdn$100,000 for production years 2 & 3 and exercise the option to purchase 
the remaining 2% NSR in production Year 4. 

 Tax:  The agreement between Aurafrique and the government of the Central African 
Republic is that tax will only be applicable after 5 years of production 

 Depreciation:  A straight line method over 10 years was used as the basis for 
depreciation from the time production commences for all mechanical equipment. In 
addition, any other intangible capital and capital associated with the Passendro site 
only, e.g. tailings dam raises, will be depreciated over the remaining life of mine. 
AXMIN has elected to transfer the historical exploration cost amounts of 
US$60million for depreciation and taxation purposes only and these costs are not 
part of the project costs. 
Inflation:  In line with the practice in the mineral industry, no inflation was applied to 
the cashflow analysis 

 Equipment Resale Value:  The process plant equipment resale value has been 
assumed at 20% of the plant equipment costs while the mining equipment has been 
assumed at 6.7% of the equipment value. 
Working Capital:  This has been returned at the end of mine life. 

 Oil Price: An oil price of US$80 per barrel was assumed 
 
Financial analysis results are summarized in Table 1-33. 
 



 

Summary 1-94 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

Table 1-33 Summary of financial analysis results 

 
 

Major highlights of the financial analysis are as follows: 

Gold Production: Life of mine average production of 203,607 ounces per annum.  
 Direct Operating Costs: Life of mine average cash operating costs of US$ 361 per 

troy ounce is inclusive of mining, processing, assay, general and administration. 
 Total Cash Operating Costs: Life of mine total costs of US$ 379 per troy ounce is 

inclusive of direct operating cost, refining and royalty charges.  
 Total Project Costs: Total project costs of US$562 per troy ounce are inclusive of 

construction capital, life of mine operating costs and sustaining capital. This cost 
represents the break even gold price for the project. 
Net Present Value (NPV): The project will realise an NPV of US$163.9 million on a 
discount rate of 5% and a gold price of US$750 per troy ounce. 

 Net Cashflow: Net cashflow of US$233.4 million will be realised at a gold price of 
US$750 per troy ounce.   

 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) & Payback Period: Project IRR of 29.4 % with a 
2.19 year pay back period will be realized for the assumed production and capital 
expenditure. 

 
1.16.1 Sensitivity Analysis 

Sensitivity analysis was performed on the after tax profits by varying the major key variables 
(gold price, capex opex and fuel price) to ± 30 % of the base case cashflow and each 
sensitivity was performed independent of the other and indicated that the project is most 
sensitive to gold price followed by operating costs and then capital expenditure. 

The sensitivity analysis results of the sensitivities are summarized Tables 1-34 to 1-37 for 
gold price varying from US$675 to US$975 per ounce and capex, opex and fuel price 
variations of ±10%. In addition the impact of varying these key variables to ±30% is shown in 
the Figures 1-35 and 1-36.

1.17 IMPLEMENTATION 

The project schedule that was developed for implementing the Passendro Project is shown in 
Figure 1-37 and shows a 24 month implementation period from the time an EPCM company 
is appointed to commencement of commissioning. In this period is included the following: 

9 months for detailed engineering 
 16 months for construction 

 
The project milestones include the following: 

Completion of feasibility study in April, 2008. 
Commencement of detailed engineering, procurement and contracts administration 
in May, 2008. 
Completion of the ESIA report, and submission there of that to the relevant 
authorities in May, 2008 
ESIA approval in October, 2008. 
Placing orders for long lead delivery items in July, 2008. 

 Mobilization for construction in November, 2008, following the ESIA approval and 
receipt of permits. 
Completion of detailed engineering in April, 2009. 
Commencement of mining pre-production in March, 2010. 
Completion of construction in July, 2010. 

 Completion of commissioning of the processing facility in October, 2010. 
 
It is envisaged that AXMIN will appoint an independent engineering company to execute the 
project on an EPCM basis. It is likely that a soft start approach will be followed, during which 
sufficient design and engineering work will be performed to enable long lead items to be 
ordered. This soft start will roll into a full EPCM contract once the mining permit is obtained. 

It has been assumed that construction of some infrastructure necessary for easing project 
logistics such as the bridges and air strip will overlap with detailed engineering. 

Procurement of long lead items such as the mills, power station and mining fleet was 
assumed to take place 3 months after the contract award. It will take 80 weeks to fabricate 
the mills and another 16 weeks to deliver them so site so this will be the critical part of the 
project. 

Commissioning has been assumed to take place over a 4 month period in order to achieve 
design tonnage.

access roads to site are in bad condition. Control of the logistics and their cost implications 
will be fundamental in maintaining reasonable operating costs. Especially vulnerable is the 
import of essential commodities such as project equipment, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oil, 
explosive materials, plant reagents and consumables. Transport costs may increase due to 
the few participants that could  monopolise the market. This would impact negatively on the 
project as transport costs contributes to a major portion of the overall project operating costs. 

1.18.1.2 Hydrology and Ground Water Conditions  

Slope stability: The current study has been developed under the assumption that all the 
working faces within the operating pits can be de-watered prior to mining, thus enabling a 
steeper angle of working. Final definition of the final excavated slope angles and ultimately 
the mining reserves has been assessed with the completion of the hydrogeological drilling, 
testwork and modelling. Although the results of drilling and pump test work show that the pit 
slopes can be de-watered, more analysis is required to improve knowledge and confirm 
detailed design. 

1.18.1.3 Heavy Fuel Oil Supplies  

At the present moment use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) in country is minimal. If TRADEX SA, a 
Cameroonian based company, is unable to provide the quantity of HFO required to run the 
generators due to logistical reasons then diesel could be use as an alternative which could 
translate to an increase of operating costs by more than US$20 million over the life of the 
mine which could have major implications on the project financials. 

1.18.1.4 Viscosity 

During rheology and viscosity tests oxides behaved as pastes at mass solids concentrations 
larger than 58% w/w. This could result in lower throughput for soft oxides. Testwork to 
pursue the use of viscosity modifiers should be undertaken and if not successful then the 
SAG Mill should be used as a scrubber during periods when oxides with a lot of fine material 
are being treated. 

1.18.2 Opportunities 

1.18.2.1 Reserves & Mineral Resources 

An opportunity exists to increase the mineral resources through: 

 Further drilling, specifically targeting the areas which have not been closed off by 
drilling and further exploration at the Nguetepe deposit. 

 Proving up underground extensions and continued exploration of the permit area for 
additional ore bodies. 

 
An opportunity exists to increase ore reserves through: 



 

Summary 1-100 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

 Upgrading of Inferred Mineral Resources through further drilling as well as completion 
of appropriate technical studies demonstrating their technical feasibility and economic 
viability. 

 
1.18.2.2 Coarser Grinds for Oxides 

The grind optimization tests showed that recoveries are similar for oxides at fine and coarse 
grinds. A grind of 80% -75µm was however selected as the optimum grind to accommodate 
the sulphide ore types. In practice oxides could be milled at a coarser grind (80% -150µm) 
which could result in reduced power consumptions. In addition milling the oxides to a coarser 
grind could also result in higher throughputs resulting in higher gold production and possible 
reduced reagent consumptions. All these factors could result in reduced operating costs 

1.18.2.3 Hydropower 

The proposed Kembe hydro-electric power facility provides a potential opportunity for 
reducing power costs substantially when realised. Though it is unlikely that the facility will be 
online for the start of production at Passendro, the inherent benefits of hydroelectric power 
over those of fuel oil generator sets in terms of unit power costs would result in significantly 

.   

1.18.2.4 Biofuel and Alternative Fuels 

In addition to the Kembe hydro-electric project, AXMIN is discussing across the fence power 
supply with two companies and this holds the potential to significantly reduce power costs.
The two possibilities are: 

through the use of crude oil fired generators with the oil being imported from nearby 
Chad 

 the use of biofuel in fluidised bed boiler powering a steam turbine. This would 
commence with the wood cut down in clearing the site, a total of 300,000 m3 and 
continue with either imported tire derived fuel and/or locally produced bio fuel such as 
cotton seeds or jatropha seeds. 

 
Both the above possibilities are being examined and can be studied sufficiently prior to 
finalising the decision on the power source. 

1.18.2.5 Schedule 

The schedule shows project duration of 24 months which can be reduced by ordering long 
lead items prior to detailed engineering.  

1.18.2.6 Gold Price 

A gold price of US$750/oz was assumed in the financial analysis against an actual of greater 
than US$900. If the price of gold is greater than US$750 at the time of operation this will 

 

1.18.3 Conclusions and Recommendations 

Since AXMIN became involved in the Central African Republic, considerable effort and 
expenditure has been incurred to delineate what is now believed to be a significant gold 
resource and reserve at Passendro. This feasibility report attests to the extensive amount of 
exploration, tests and study work carried out on the project. It is believed that the level of 
accuracy used here is sufficient to consider this report to be bankable with its demonstration 



 

Summary 1-101 April 2008 
Passendro Gold Project  Bankable Feasibility Study 

 

of the technical feasibility for developing a gold mine at Passendro that will produce in 
excess of 1.2 million ounces of gold over a 6 year production period.  

There are several ore bodies associated with this project, all of which have been well defined 
and demonstrate good continuity of geology and grade. The ore bodies are narrow in places 
and mining and associated grade control practices will need to be carefully controlled. 
Nevertheless, AXMIN in association with their respected advisor consultants are confident of 
the successful implementation of this project both from a mining and a process point of view. 
Only proven and tested technologies have been considered for both disciplines. The 
metallurgy of the various ore types has been extensively tested and is consequently well 
understood. 

The feasibility study has demonstrated that the Passendro ore deposits can be economically 
mined using open pit method and processed through conventional gravity/ CIL technology at 
an annual rate of about 3 million tonnes per annum. 

Project economics conducted reveal the following salient factors pertaining to the Passendro 
Project:- 

Processed Tonnage  16.8 million tonnes 
Grade    2.37 g/t 
Recovery   94.1% 
Throughput   3 million tonnes per annum 
Life of Mine   5.92 years 
Annual gold production 203,000 oz per annum 
Total cash costs  US$ 379 per oz. 

 Capital Cost   US$ 219.771 million (including sustaining & working  
        capital) 

At a gold price of US$ 750 per ounce the NPV, IRR and payback period may be expressed
as follows:- 

NPV at 0% discount rate is  US$ 233 million  
NPV at 5% discount rate is    US$ 164 million 
NPV at 10% discount rate is   US$ 112 million. 
IRR     29.4 % 

 Payback period   2.19 Years 
 
These returns are considered attractive and commensurate with returns warranted by the 
risk involved for an investment in a gold project in a remote location. AXMIN are constantly 
looking for ways in which the economics of the project may be improved, nevertheless are of 
the opinion that the exhibited rates of return are currently attractive and achievable. 

There still remains considerable upside to extend the reserves and life of mine by proving up 
underground extensions and by continued exploration of the permit area for additional ore 
bodies. 

Other than a higher long term gold price, further upside possibilities include the conversion of 
resources to reserves, reduced power costs by using Kembe hydro-electric power and 
reduced reagent consumptions. 

The robust and attractive economic indications expressed above demonstrate the benefits of 
implementation of the Project. It is therefore recommended that the commencement of the

development of the Passendro Project be approved with the intention of producing first gold 
at the end of the second quarter of Year 2010.
