Executive Summary 
 
Introduction 
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is an advanced project exploring the mineral potential of 
historical tailings from the former United Keno Hill Mines ("UKHM") mill located in 
the town of Elsa, Yukon. The Elsa tailings are impounded on the south-eastern slopes 
of the McQuesten River valley approximately 400 metres from the UKHM mill  
 
Milling operations at Elsa started in the 1930s and continued almost without 
interruption until 1988.  Historical production records indicate that approximately 
4,050,000 tons of tailings were deposited at the Elsa site. Historical resource estimates 
on the Elsa Tailings Project were made by UKHM in 1970 and 1988.   
 
On June 29, 2009 SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") was commissioned by 
Alexco Resource Corporation ("Alexco") to prepare a mineral resource estimate for 
the Elsa Tailings Project.  The resource herein represents a first resource estimate for 
the deposit prepared for Alexco.   
 
This technical report documents the resource model constructed by SRK. It was 
prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators' National 
Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted 
CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice 
Guidelines." 
 
Property Description and Agreements 
 
The land under the control of Alexco comprises 717 surveyed quartz mining leases, 
864 unsurveyed quartz mining claims, and two crown grants. The total area 
approximates 24,300 hectares.  Certain UKHM claims may be subject to unknown or 
unregistered royalties and/or agreements.   
 
Quartz mining leases provide mineral title to the area occupied by the tailings and are 
part of a large land package controlled by Alexco through its subsidiaries, Elsa 
Reclamation and Development Co. ("ERDC") and Alexco Keno Hill Mining Corp.   
The tailings are located on Quartz Leases: Orchid 1, 3, 15, 26, 31 & 37; Betty and 
Mud.   
 
Alexco's rights to much of the Keno Hill property are held through the ERDC, a 
wholly owned subsidiary.  In June 2005, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PWC"), a 
court appointed interim receiver and receiver-manager of United Keno Hill Mines 
Limited and UKH Minerals Limited (collectively "UKHM"), selected Alexco as the 
preferred purchaser of the assets of UKHM. In February 2006, following negotiation 
of a Subsidiary Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of 
Yukon, and Alexco, the Supreme Court of Yukon approved the purchase of the assets 
of UKHM by Alexco through its wholly owned subsidiary, ERDC. The UKHM assets 
comprised two Crown Grants, 674 mining leases, 289 mineral claims, an ore 
concentration plant, various buildings and equipment, as well as partial ownership 
interest in three mining leases, 36 mineral claims, in addition to a leasehold interest in 
one mineral claim.  PWC and Alexco entered into an agreement (the "Purchase 
Agreement") dated August 4, 2005, as amended on November 2, 2005 and January 31, 
2006. Alexco assigned the Purchase Agreement to its wholly owned subsidiary ERDC 
on February 6, 2006.   "Interim Closing" of the UKHM transaction was completed on 
April 18, 2006.  Alexco assumed responsibility for care and maintenance operations at 
the UKHM property.  On November 30, 2006, Alexco terminated a contract with a

local contractor and started conducting operations utilizing its own employees and 
equipment.  Title to all UKHM assets was transferred to Alexco ("Final Closing") in 
November 2007, following the approval of a "Type B" Water License by the Yukon 
Water Board.  
 
All quartz mining leases have been legally surveyed whereas the quartz mining claims 
have not.  In addition, in 2006 and 2007, 650399 BC Ltd., a wholly owned Alexco 
subsidiary, staked 673 mineral claims (full size and fractional) adjacent to and 
contiguous with the UKHM property and purchased 36 quartz claims and 37 quartz 
mining leases from a third party.  In 2008 and 2009, Alexco took four existing claims 
to lease, acquired an additional 18 claims from a third party, and amalgamated 55 
additional existing bordering claims into the holdings.  Mineral exploration at Keno 
Hill was initially permitted under the terms and conditions set out by the Yukon 
Government in the Class III Quartz Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00186, issued on 
July 5, 2006 and valid until July 4, 2011. Alexco subsequently obtained a Class IV 
Quartz Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00240 on June 17, 2008.  The two permits were 
amalgamated on December 8, 2008 under #LQ00240 which is valid until December 
16, 2018.   
 
Under the terms of a legal agreement with the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Yukon, Alexco is indemnified from any and all environmental liability 
that may be presented by the historic tailings. However, if Alexco were to nominate 
any part of the tailings as a production unit under the above agreement, responsibility 
for addressing water- related environmental liabilities would fall to Alexco.  
 
Location Access and Physiography 
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is included within the historic Keno Hill mining camp, 
located in central Yukon. The closest town is Mayo, located on the Stewart River, 
about 45 kilometres to the south. Mayo is accessible from Whitehorse via a 407 
kilometre all weather road; the town is also serviced by Mayo airport, which is located 
just to the north. A gravel all-weather road leads from Mayo to the project areas.  
Historically, the mining camp was linked by river route to the outside world; since 
1950, the all-weather highway, which was also used for transporting the ore, has been 
the main link. 
 
The Keno Hill area is characterized by rolling hills and mountains with relief up to 
1200 metres.  Slopes are generally gentle with steeper slopes on the north sides of 
Keno Hill and Sourdough Hill.  The Elsa Tailings are located on the south slope of the 
McQuesten valley centred along the Flat and Porcupine Creek drainages. 
 
History 
 
Milling operations at Elsa started in the 1930s, operating almost continuously until 
1988.  A lead concentrate with a periodic zinc concentrate was produced from milling 
operations.  A cyanide leach circuit was added in 1958 and operated periodically to 
1981 depending on prevailing economics.    
 
It is estimated that in total approximately 4,050,000 tons of tailings were deposited at 
the Elsa site. Most of this material was allowed to run out onto the flank of the 
adjacent valley without engineered impoundment. The original ground surface was 
covered with small trees, brush and a vegetative mat of moss, all of which was 
eventually covered by the tailings. 
 
The northern portion of the tailings was drilled by UKHM in 1970 and in a second 
drilling campaign from 1987 to 1988 covering the rest of the tailings area at that time.

Metallurgical testing of the tailings was undertaken in 1988 and 1995 by UKHM and a 
joint venture between UKHM and government agencies.   
 
Regional and Local Geology 
 
The tailings lie on the south slope of the McQuesten valley.  The rounded out shape of 
the valley can be attributed to at least one episode of glaciation followed by the 
deposition of glaciofluvial sands and gravels related to kame terraces. The 
glaciofluvial sands and gravels were deposited at higher valley elevations with till 
deposited at lower valley sides and valley bottoms.  During the retreat of glacial ice the 
McQuesten valley bottom was covered by a shallow lake resulting in the deposition of 
lacustrine silt. The lacustrine silt became increasingly organic and transitioned to peat 
as the glacial lake became in filled with sediments.   
 
The Elsa Tailings cover an irregular area of approximately 130 hectares and range 
from 0.1 to over 4 metres in thickness. While the valley flank on which the tailings 
have been deposited is relatively smooth topographically, points of higher elevation 
occur as uncovered "islands" within the body of the tailings. The earliest site of 
tailings deposition appears to have been directly into Porcupine Creek with the 
material being mostly flushed downstream into Flat Creek. Beginning in 1946, tailings 
were directed away from the creeks producing small terraced accumulations 
immediately below the mill. Somewhat later a pipeline was constructed that 
discharged tailings further into the valley in the area between Porcupine and Flat 
Creek.  Ten major mines supplied feed to the Elsa Mill during its operation in the 
1930s through 1950s.From the 1960s to 1980s ore was processed by the mill 
underwent a transition from high grade mineralization to lower grade mineralization 
from small open pits and underground operations. 
 
Deposit Type and Mineralization 
 
The tailings consist of generally unconsolidated silty fine grained sand with minor 
medium sand grained material, of a variable grey to light brown colour characterized 
by thin beds to laminae.  Detailed mineralogical examination shows that the sand 
grains are angular and locally aggregated and cemented by limonite. The dominant 
minerals are quartz and siderite (80 percent) with the balance composed of muscovite 
and other silicate minerals along with pyrite. Occasional grains contain lead and zinc 
sulphides and trace amounts of lead and zinc oxide minerals have been identified.  
 
Drilling 
 
UKHM initially carried out a percussion drilling program targeting the thicker 
northern portion of the tailings in 1970.  A total of 114 vertical drill holes were drilled 
to an average depth of three metres.  Drill hole spacing was reported at approximately 
60 metres.  From 1987 to 1988 a second drilling program was completed by UKHM 
using a rotary drill for a total of 379 vertical holes (1,770 metres).  Alexco and SRK 
examined historical data and methodologies associated with these programs and 
conclude that UKHM drilling data were too unreliable to be used for resource 
evaluation and classification according to CIM best practice guidelines.   
 
Alexco drilled 283 vertical sonic drill holes over the deposit in 2009 for a total of 910 
drilled metres.  The Alexco drilling campaign consisted of drill holes spaced at 50 
metres with lines orientated at an azimuth of 45 degrees. Average thickness of the 
tailings is 2.3 metres ranging from a maximum thickness of 7.5 metres to a minimum 
of 0.2 metres.

Tailings core material is inherently difficult to handle as it is unconsolidated and, in 
some cases, is saturated with water.  Because of the nature of the core material some 
challenges in core recovery, logging and sample collection exist.  SRK is of the 
opinion that the drilling and sampling performed by Alexco was conducted with care 
and that the location and handling of the core yielded reasonable samples. 
 
Sampling Method, Approach and Analyses 
 
Drill core was sampled generally at each run length of 1.5 metres or to the lower 
tailings contact.  The entire core was sampled to provide a known volume for density 
measurements.  Sampled core intervals were placed in polyethylene bags secured with 
"zip ties."   
 
All samples were analyzed by the ISO 9001 accredited ALS Chemex laboratory in 
North Vancouver, British Columbia.  Upon receipt, samples were placed under ovens 
for high temperature drying and weighed when dry.  Following splitting and 
pulverization samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic 
emission spectrometry using a four acid digestion. Thirty three elements including 
silver, lead and zinc were analyzed using this method.  Gold assays were analyzed 
using fire assay with atomic absorption spectrometry.   
 
Quality control samples were placed systematically into the sample stream. Every 20 
samples contained at least one blank sample, one standard of known value, and one 
request for a duplicate assay of the previous sample.  
 
The dry density for each of the 2009 sonic drill samples was determined for each of 
the assayed cores.  Dry density was calculated using the dry weight of the sample from 
the assay laboratory divided by the drilled interval volume which was based on 
sampled interval length and the inside diameter of the core tube.   
 
Data Verification 
 
SRK compared 10 percent of the drill hole data assays to original assay certificates.  
No errors were found in the drill hole assay data base.  During the site visit, SRK 
examined three pits and briefly logged the pit walls of three trenches.  SRK also 
reviewed drill core photos for the sampling program.   
 
 
 
Mineral Resource Estimation 
 
Resources were estimated based on 283 drill holes from the 2009 Alexco sonic drilling 
program.  The data set comprises 546 sampled intervals with silver, lead, zinc and gold 
assays.   
 
A wireframe model of the tailings body was generated by Alexco using high resolution 
topographic surveys and tailings/sub-surface contacts from the drilling program.   
 
Based on tailings assays the tailings area was subdivided into five domains:  A low 
grade silver-lead, low grade gold, high grade silver-lead, high grade gold, and a zinc-
specific gravity domain.  A sixth separate domain was created for an isolated area 
away from the main tailings impoundment.   
 
All tailings drill holes were composited to 1.5 metre intervals from top to bottom with 
a minimum composite length of 0.20 metres to allow for thin portions of the tailings 
impoundment. A review of composite statistics and cumulative frequency plots for the

metal assays domains indicates that it is not necessary to cap high grade values within 
the drill hole composites.   
 
Specific gravity composites average 1.7 with a significant dispersion of values ranging 
from 0.4 to 4.6.  Specific gravity composites were capped at a high value of 4.0 and 
low value of 0.75 for resource estimation. 
 
Variography was undertaken to characterize the spatial continuity of the metal grade 
data within each resource domain and to determine appropriate grade interpolation 
ranges.  Variograms were developed for four domains including gold, silver, lead, zinc 
and specific gravity composites.  Two structure variograms were developed for each 
variable in the X and Y directions only.  The relatively narrow depth of the tailings 
precluded development of variograms in the Z direction.  Variograms for the high 
domains with insufficient composites to determine variogram models were assumed to 
be the same as for low grade domains.  Datamine Studio 3 was used to develop a sub-
blocked model for the deposit.   
 
Metal grades and specific gravity were estimated in the block model using ordinary 
kriging for each of the separate domains and estimate variables.  Only one estimation 
pass was made. 
 
Estimation was verified by visual comparison of composited drill holes, cross-
validation and estimation of resources using inverse distance squared and nearest 
neighbour routines at no cut-off. 
 
While drilling and sampling procedures, tightly spaced drilling, and assay results 
provide a high level of confidence, the inherent challenges related to drilling and 
sampling unconsolidated material are reflected in significant outliers in specific 
gravity determinations. These outliers could not be fully explained by expected 
specific gravity ranges or measurable sampling errors.  For this reason SRK is of the 
opinion that it is appropriate to classify the Elsa Tailings resource blocks as Indicated. 
This is because the estimates are based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques that are spaced closely enough 
for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.  
 
Mineral Resources Statement 
 
Mineral Resources for the Elsa Tailings Project have been estimated at 2.49 million 
tonnes at 119 grams of silver per tonne ("gpt silver") , 0.12 gpt gold, 0.99 percent lead, 
and 0.70 percent zinc at a 50 gpt silver cut-off grade.  The Mineral Resource Statement 
for the Elsa Tailings deposit is tabulated in Table i.

Mineral Resources for the Elsa Tailings Project have been classified according to the 
"CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definition and Guidelines" 
(December, 2005) by Mr. G. David Keller, P. Geo (#1235) an "Independent Qualified 
Person" as defined by National Instrument 43-101. 
 
Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
Six domains were generated by SRK to separate high grade zones for silver, lead and 
gold.  An additional domain was generated for a geographically distinct tailings area 
that is physically separate from the main tailings.  Metal grades were estimated 
separately for each domain using ordinary kriging.  Capping was not applied to metal 
assays or composites.  Dry specific gravity composites were capped using a lowest and 
highest capping value.   
 
After validation and classification, SRK used silver and gold grades to determine 
"reasonable prospects for economic extraction."  The basis of this determination was 
metal grades, heap leach recoveries and estimated mining and processing costs from 
comparable projects.   
 
The mineral resource statement prepared by SRK is reported at silver cut-off grades of 
50 gpt, which are based on the likely extraction scenario.  All material in the resource 
estimate is above this grade. 
 
Recommendations 
 
It is SRK's opinion that resources for the Elsa Tailings Project have been defined to 
sufficient accuracy to support the preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment 
("PEA").  Alexco has embarked on extensive metallurgical test work to document the 
metallurgical properties of the tailings material and evaluate appropriate processing 
options. This aspect is critical for the PEA study.  Untested areas containing additional 
tailings are known to occur peripherally to the current resource area. These zones offer 
potential to increase the current resource and are recommended for exploration 
sampling. Estimated costs for the recommended programs are summarized in Table ii.

Program Cost [CD$] 
Preliminary Economic Assessment $200,000 
Drilling Program $50,000

1 Introduction 
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is an advanced project delineating the mineral 
potential of historical tailings from the former United Keno Hill Mines 
("UKHM") mill located in the town of Elsa, Yukon. The Elsa tailings are 
impounded on the south-eastern slopes of the McQuesten River valley 
approximately 400 metres from the UKHM mill. . 
 
Milling operations at Elsa started in the 1930s and continued almost 
continuously until 1988.  Historical production records indicate that 
approximately 4,050,000 tons of tailings were deposited at the Elsa site. Most 
of this material was allowed to run out onto the flank of the adjacent valley 
without engineered impoundment. The original ground surface was covered 
with small trees, bush and a vegetative mat of moss, all of which was 
eventually covered by the tailings. In 1958 a dam was constructed to prevent 
tailing-laden water from moving to the west along the Flat Creek drainage. At 
the same time the tailings discharge point was moved from Porcupine Creek to 
a point further east, forcing the tailings to accumulate behind the dam. Over 
time, two additional dams were constructed below the first dam to control run 
off across older tailings. 
 
Historical resource estimates on the Elsa Tailings Project were made by 
UKHM in 1970 and 1988.   
 
On June 29, 2009 SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") was commissioned 
by Alexco Resource Corporation ("Alexco")  to prepare a mineral resource 
estimate for the Elsa Tailings Project.  The mineral resource statement reported 
herein represents a first evaluation of mineral resources prepared for the Elsa 
Tailings Project for Alexco.   
 
This technical report documents the mineral resource estimate for the Elsa 
Tailings Project. It was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian 
Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, 
and in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines." 
 

1.1 Qualification of SRK 
 
The SRK Group comprises over 800 professionals, offering expertise in a wide 
range of resource engineering disciplines.  The SRK Group's independence is 
ensured by the fact that it holds no equity in any project and that its ownership 
rests solely with its staff.  This permits SRK to provide its clients with 
conflict-free and objective recommendations on crucial judgment issues.  SRK 
has a demonstrated track record in undertaking independent assessments of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, project evaluations and audits, 
technical reports and independent feasibility evaluations to bankable standards 
on behalf of exploration and mining companies and financial institutions 
worldwide.  The SRK Group has also worked with a large number of major 
international mining companies and their projects, providing mining industry 
consultancy service inputs.

resource estimates since 1986. Mr. Keller visited the property from August 5 
to 9, 2009. 
 
Dr. Weiershäuser is a consulting geologist with SRK and has been employed 
by SRK since February 2007. Dr. Weiershäuser has not visited the property. 
 

1.2 Scope of Work 
 
The scope of work, as outlined in a memo to Alexco dated July 17, 2009 
includes a review of previous resource estimates, recommendations for a new 
drilling and sampling program, estimation of mineral resources based on the 
2009 Alexco drilling campaign and the preparation of an independent technical 
report in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1 
guidelines. This work would typically involve an assessment of the following: 
 
 Audit of the new exploration drilling results; 
 Validation of new wireframes; 
 Geostatistical analysis and variography; 
 Mineral resource estimation; 
 Validation of estimates; and 
 Recommendations for additional work.

1.4 Site Visit 
 
In compliance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, Mr. G. David 
Keller visited the Alexco site at Elsa from August 5 to August 9, 2009 in 
conjunction with visits to two concurrent Alexco projects.  Mr. Keller 
dedicated time to the Elsa Project from August 7 to August 9, 2010.  The 
purpose of the visit was to: 
 
 Examine tailings impoundment area and tailings material; 
 Examine open trenches and cuts in tailings impoundment area; 
 Review and discuss previous drilling and sampling data; and 
 Formulate a drilling and sampling strategy with Alexco to evaluate mineral 

resources for the project. 
 
SRK completed the site visit before the Alexco sonic drilling program started 
and did not witness the execution of the drilling and sampling program.  SRK 
was involved in the planning stage for the drilling program and discussed the 
program extensively with Alexco staff.  SRK examined core photos and data 
from the drilling program.

2 Reliance on other Experts and 
Declaration 
 
SRK's opinion contained herein and effective June 16, 2010, is based on 
information provided to SRK by Alexco throughout the course of SRK's 
investigations, which in turn reflect various technical and economic conditions 
at the time of writing. Given the nature of the mining business, these 
conditions can change significantly over relatively short periods of time.  
Consequently actual results may be significantly more or less favourable.   
 
This report includes technical information, which requires subsequent 
calculations to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages.  Such 
calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently 
introduce a margin of error.  Where these occur, SRK does not consider them 
to be material.   
 
SRK is not an insider, associate or an affiliate of Alexco and neither SRK nor 
any affiliate has acted as advisor to Alexco or its affiliates in connection with 
this project. The results of the technical review by SRK are not dependent on 
any prior agreements concerning the conclusions to be reached, nor are there 
any undisclosed understandings concerning any future business dealings.   
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is located within the historic Keno Hill mining camp. 
Minimal new surface disturbances have occurred within the project area 
arising from surface drilling. Potential environmental liabilities associated with 
the Elsa Tailings Project were excluded from the work program. As such, no 
verification was conducted by SRK and no opinion is expressed regarding the 
environmental aspect of this project. 
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is part of a larger property which comprises two 
Crown grants, 717 mining leases, six surface leases, three fee simple lots and 
864 unsurveyed mineral claims (copies presented in Appendix A) covering an 
aggregate area of approximately 150 square kilometres ("km2"). Alexco 
informed SRK that the titles are in good standing and that as of October, 2009, 
they are wholly owned by Alexco free of liens. For the purpose of this 
assignment SRK has not verified the status of the mining titles with the 
Government authorities. 
 
SRK was informed by Alexco that there are no known litigations potentially 
affecting the Elsa Tailings Project.

3 Property Description and Location 
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is located within Alexco's Keno property situated in 
the Mayo Mining District approximately 450 kilometres north of Whitehorse, 
Yukon. The area is covered by NTS map sheets 105M/13 and 105M/14. 
Access to the property is via a paved, two-lane highway from Whitehorse to 
Mayo (407 kilometres) and an all-weather gravel road northeast from Mayo to 
Elsa (45 kilometres) – a total distance of 452 kilometres.  
 
The tailings are impounded on the south-eastern slope of the broad McQuesten 
River valley centred along the Flat and Porcupine Creek drainages and are 
located approximately 400 metres northwest of the abandoned town of Elsa. 
 

3.1 Land Tenement 
 
The land under the control of Alexco comprises 717 surveyed quartz mining 
leases, 864 unsurveyed quartz mining claims, and two crown grants. The total 
area approximates 24,300 hectares outlined in Figure 1.  Certain UKHM 
claims may be subject to unknown or unregistered royalties and/or agreements.   
 
Quartz mining leases provide mineral title to the area occupied by the tailings 
and are part of a large land package controlled by Alexco through its 
subsidiaries, Elsa Reclamation and Development Co. ("ERDC") and Alexco 
Keno Hill Mining Corp.  The tailings are located on Quartz Leases: Orchid 1, 
3, 15, 26, 31 & 37; Betty and Mud.  
 

3.2 Underlying Agreements 
 
Alexco's rights to much of the Keno Hill property are held through ERDC, a 
wholly owned subsidiary.  In June 2005, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP 
("PWC"), a court appointed interim receiver and receiver-manager of United 
Keno Hill Mines Limited and UKH Minerals Limited (collectively "UKHM"), 
selected Alexco as the preferred purchaser of the assets of UKHM. In February 
2006, following negotiation of a Subsidiary Agreement between the 
Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon, and Alexco, the Supreme 
Court of Yukon approved the purchase of the assets of UKHM by Alexco 
through its wholly owned subsidiary, ERDC. The UKHM assets comprised 
two Crown Grants, 674 mining leases, 289 mineral claims, an ore 
concentration plant, various buildings and equipment, as well as partial 
ownership interest in three mining leases, 36 mineral claims, in addition to a 
leasehold interest in one mineral claim.  PWC and Alexco entered into an 
agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") dated August 4, 2005, as amended 
November 2, 2005 and January 31, 2006. Alexco assigned the Purchase 
Agreement to its wholly owned subsidiary ERDC on February 6, 2006.  In 
February 2006, following the negotiation of a Subsidiary Agreement between 
the Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon, and Alexco, the 
Supreme Court of Yukon approved the purchase of the assets of UKHM by 
ERDC.  "Interim Closing" of the UKHM transaction was completed on April

LW-GDK / jfc – ab - jps Alexco_Tailing_Resource_TR_3CA020_003_LW_GDK_ab_jfc_JPS_20100616.doc, June 16, 2010 

18, 2006. Alexco assumed responsibility for care and maintenance operations 
at the UKHM property.  On the Interim Closing, among other things, Alexco:  
 
 Deposited CD$10 M in trust to be used exclusively to fund ERDC's 

contribution to the cost of the reclamation of the pre-existing 
environmental liabilities of the UKHM property; 

 Obtained possession of the mineral claims and leases, titled property and 
crown grants of UKHM and the equipment on the UKHM properties for 
the purposes of contracted care and maintenance and exploration by ERDC 
of the UKHM property.   

 
On November 30, 2006, Alexco terminated a contract with a local contractor 
and started conducting operations utilizing its own employees and equipment.  
Title to all UKHM assets was transferred to Alexco ("Final Closing") in late 
November 2007, following the approval of a "Type B" Water License by the 
Yukon Water Board.  A water licence is the main operating licence in the 
Yukon and is required in order to use water and to deposit waste in or near 
water. On January 24, 2008, Alexco applied for a "Type B" Water Licence 
covering its proposed underground exploration program at Bellekeno. 
Commercial production and processing cannot commence until a Type "A" 
Water Licence is obtained.  Finally, previous environmental assessments of the 
property outlined the need for a comprehensive abandonment/reclamation 
plan, which was required by the historic operating water licence. UKHM 
submitted an abandonment plan in 1990; however, government regulatory 
agencies judged it deficient in several respects. Alexco is formulating an 
Existing State of Mine Closure Plan for the entire district as part of its 
agreements with the Governments.  The quartz mining claims and leases 
currently owned by Alexco cover an aggregated area of approximately 24,300 
ha, forming an east-northeast trending belt about 29 kilometres long and up to 
eight kilometres wide within the Keno Hill Mining District (Figure 4.2).  The 
titles of the following land assets were transferred to Alexco after the issuance 
of a Type "B" Water Licence on 14 November 2007: 
 
 100 percent of 637 quartz mining leases, 2 Crown grants, and 85 quartz 

mining claims; 
 50 percent of 3 quartz mining leases; 
 70 percent of 29 quartz mining claims; 
 65 percent of 7 quartz mining claims. 
 
All quartz mining leases have been legally surveyed whereas the quartz mining 
claims have not.  In addition, in 2006 and 2007, 650399 BC Ltd., a wholly 
owned Alexco subsidiary staked 673 mineral claims (full size and fractional) 
adjacent to and contiguous with the UKHM property and purchased 36 quartz 
claims and 37 quartz mining leases from a third party.  In 2008 and 2009, 
Alexco took four existing claims to lease, acquired an additional 18 claims 
from a third party, and amalgamated 55 additional existing bordering claims 
into the holdings.  Mineral exploration at Keno Hill was initially permitted 
under the terms and conditions set out by the Yukon Government in the Class 
III Quartz Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00186, issued on July 5, 2006 and 
valid until July 4, 2011. Alexco subsequently obtained a Class IV Quartz 
Mining Land Use Permit – LQ00240 on June 17, 2008.  The two permits were

amalgamated on December 8, 2008 under #LQ00240 which is valid until 
December 16, 2018.  
 
Under the terms of a legal agreement with the Government of Canada and the 
Government of Yukon, Alexco is indemnified from any and all environmental 
liability that may be presented by the historic tailings. However, if Alexco 
were to nominate any part of the tailings as a production unit under the above 
agreement, responsibility for addressing water- related environmental 
liabilities would fall to Alexco.  
 

3.3 Royalties 
 
Future production from the Keno Hill Silver District, including the Bellekeno 
Mine, is subject to a 1.5 percent NSR royalty, capped at CD$4.0 M, payable to 
the Government of Canada. This royalty is a condition of the Subsidiary 
Agreement. Payment of the royalty does not begin until all pre-production 
capital has been recouped plus an additional allowance for district exploration 
of approximately CD$6.2 M.   
 
Alexco and Silver Wheaton Corporation ("Silver Wheaton") entered into an 
agreement on October 2, 2008 (the "Silver Purchase Agreement") whereby 25 
percent of all future silver production from the Keno Hill Silver District will be 
delivered to Silver Wheaton in exchange for a payment of US$3.90/oz as well 
as a payment by Silver Wheaton of US$50 M for use in the development and 
construction of the Bellekeno Mine.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local 
Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 
 

4.1 Accessibility 
 
The Elsa Tailings Project is included within the historic Keno Hill mining 
camp, located in central Yukon. The closest town is Mayo, located on the 
Stewart River, about 45 kilometres to the south. Mayo is accessible from 
Whitehorse via a 407 kilometres all weather road; the town is also serviced by 
Mayo airport, which is located just to the north. A gravel all-weather road 
leads from Mayo to the project areas.  Historically, the mining camp was 
linked by river route to the outside world; since 1950, the all-weather highway, 
which was also used for transporting the ore, has been the main link. 
 
Gravelled tracks have been built on top of the tailings impoundment for 
monitoring and reclamation work.   
 

4.2 Local Resources 
 
Three phase power is available in many parts of the district as well as limited 
telephone service. A large number of roads constructed for past mining 
operations are still serviceable. The old company town of Elsa, located toward 
the western end of the district, comprises several buildings that are currently 
being used for storage, maintenance work, and housing. A new camp and 
kitchen have been constructed at Flat Creek, just west of Elsa. 
 

4.3 Climate 
 
The central Yukon is characterized by a sub-arctic continental climate with 
cold winters and warm summers. Average temperatures in the winter are 
between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius but can reach minus 60 
degrees Celsius. The summers are moderately warm and in July average 
temperatures are around 15 degrees Celsius. Exploration and mining work can 
be carried out year-round. 
 
Because of its northern latitude, winter days are short; north-facing slopes 
experience 10 weeks without direct sunlight around the winter solstice. 
Conversely, summer days are very long, especially in early summer around the 
summer solstice. Annual precipitation averages 28 centimetres; half of this 
amount falls as snow, which starts to accumulate in October and remains on 
the ground into May or June.

4.4 Physiography 
 
The Keno Hill area is characterized by rolling hills and mountains with relief 
up to 1200 metres.  Slopes are generally gentle with steeper slopes on the north 
sides of Keno Hill and Sourdough Hill.  The Elsa tailings are located on the 
southslope of the McQuesten valley, centred along the Flat and Porcupine 
Creek drainages as outlined in Figure 2.   
 
Valleys and slopes of the Keno Hill area are moderately to densely vegetated 
with grasses, shrubs and predominantly conifer forests.  The tailings 
impoundment area is sparsely vegetated with occasional grass and shrubs with 
moderate to densely vegetated areas fringing the tailings area.  Typical terrain 
of the tailings impoundment is presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

5 History 
 

5.1 District History 
 
The history of the Keno Hill mining camp is well described in Cathro (2006); 
the information presented in this section draws heavily from that source.  The 
Keno Hill mining camp area has a rich history of exploration and mining 
dating back to the beginning of the 1900s. Earliest prospectors had been 
working the area around Mayo for gold, especially after the Klondike gold 
rush of 1898. The first silver was found in 1901; however, interest was low 
due to the prospector's interest in gold alone despite an assay from 1905 
yielding more than 10 kilograms per ton ("kg/t") silver. Small-scale mining 
commenced in 1913 with a first shipment of 55 tons of ore to a smelter in San 
Francisco. Due to the First World War, interest in the area had dwindled by 
1917.   
 
In the early 1920s, the Treadwell Yukon Company Limited ("TYC") became 
interested in the Keno Hill area and, under the leadership of Livingston 
Wernecke, acquired a number of claims and started mining. By 1941, in just 
under 18 years, when Wernecke died in an accident, TYC had produced 1,381 
tons of silver and 43,772 tons of lead. More than half of that amount came 
from the Keno Hill mine.  By this time a number of mines were in production, 
including: Sadie-Ladue, Lucky Queen, Silver King, Elsa, and Hector-Calumet; 
combined, about 85 percent of the camp's production came from these mines. 
Interestingly, no zinc was recovered. 
 
Wernecke's death in 1941 and the onset of the Second World War resulted in 
the closure of TYC's properties. After the war a new company, Keno Hill 
Mining Company Ltd., (later United Keno Hill Mines Ltd.), purchased the idle 
TYC assets and resumed production. Almost immediately a major new vein 
was discovered by underground diamond drilling in the Hector Calumet mine, 
propelling United Keno Hill Mines ("UKHM") to the forefront of Canadian 
silver production.  
 
The 1950s proved to be the most profitable period in the history of the camp, 
but by the early 1960s, minable reserves lagged production and considerable 
money was being spent in exploring for new deposits. A significant discovery 
was made at what would become the Husky mine in the late 1960s. In 1977 the 
first in a series of open pits was initiated primarily targeting low grade 
mineralization and pillars left near the surface of historic underground 
workings.  
 
Low silver prices, labor shortages and rising environmental costs forced 
UKHM to cease production in early 1989. Total production for the camp to 
1989 is estimated to be 5.34 million short tons grading 40.1 ounces per ton 
Silver, 6.7 percent Lead and 4.1percent zinc (Cathro, 2006). Leasing of 
specific properties contributed a small amount of continued production through 
1990.

Between 1990 and 1998 The Dominion Mineral Resources and Sterling 
Frontier Properties Company of Canada Limited ("Dominion"), after acquiring 
a 32 percent interest in UKHM, carried out extensive reclamation, remediation 
and exploration work preparatory to reopening the camp. However, financing 
problems eventually forced Dominion to abandon its rights which reverted to 
UKHM. Environmental liabilities and site maintenance costs eventually drove 
UKHM into bankruptcy, resulting in the Federal Government of Canada 
inheriting the assets.  
 
In 2006 Alexco was selected as the prime contractor for environmental 
remediation work on the former UKHM property. Alexco was also allowed to 
purchase the property assets. Between 2006 and present Alexco carried out 
surface exploration throughout the district eventually concentrating on 
development of the historic Bellekeno mine area through extensive 
underground excavation and drilling. 
 

5.2 Elsa Tailings History 
 
The files of UKHM contain several documents related to the Elsa Tailings 
impoundment, most detailing earlier efforts to estimate contained metals in the 
tailings. A summary of this information follows: 
 
Two mills have been sited at Elsa over the years; 1.) A flotation mill operated 
by the TYC during the late 1930s and early 1940s, which was refurbished in 
1945, 2.) A new mill constructed after 1945 when the previous mill was 
destroyed by fire in 1949.  The existing mill operated almost continuously 
from 1949 until 1988. Both mills produced a lead flotation concentrate and 
sometimes a zinc concentrate. A cyanide circuit to leach mill tails also 
operated during the years 1958 to 1966, 1968 and 1979 to 1981 as dictated by 
the prevailing economics of the time. 
 
It is estimated that in total approximately 4,050,000 tons of tailings were 
deposited at the Elsa site. Most of this material was allowed to run out onto the 
flank of the adjacent valley without engineered impoundment. The original 
ground surface was covered with small trees, brush and a vegetative mat of 
moss, all of which was eventually covered by the tailings. In 1958 a dam was 
constructed (Dam #1) to prevent tailings-laden water from moving to the west 
along the Flat Creek drainage. At the same time the tailings discharge point 
was moved from Porcupine Creek to a point further east, forcing the tailings to 
accumulate behind Dam #1. Over time, two additional dams were constructed 
below Dam #1 to control run off across older tailings (Figure 2). 
 
In 1970 a portion of the active tailings pond was sampled using an in-house 
percussion drill. The drilling covered the northerly part of the tailings where 
the depths of material were relatively modest ten feet (three metres) for the 
most part. Borehole spacing was approximately 200 feet (sixty metres). No 
detailed description of the drilling or sampling has been found in existing 
records. Assay certificates showing the results were also not found. Over the 
next eighteen years additional tailings were deposited in this area.

In 1987 and 1988 the upper, thicker and generally higher grade portion of the 
tailings was sampled using a rotary drilling rig. Approximately 379 holes were 
drilled for a total of 5,396 feet (1,770 metres). Samples were collected over 
five -foot intervals and analyzed for silver, lead, zinc, and iron. Some samples 
were also analyzed for cadmium and non-sulphide lead.  

 
Using the 1970 and 1987 to 1988 drilling results historical resources for the 
tailings were estimated at 4.05 million tons grading approximately 3.14 ounces 
per ton silver (108 gpt silver) of material.  The reader is cautioned that this 
historical mineral resource estimate was prepared before the development of 
National Instrument 43-101 guidelines and the reported figures should not be 
relied upon. 
 
Metallurgical test work on tailings were undertaken by UKHM in 1988 and 
again in 1995 in a project jointly funded by two government entities and 
UKHM.  The 1995 test work was summarized in a report by Hawthorne 
(1996).  UKHM excavated pits at a number of points to collect additional 
samples for gravity separation, flotation and leach tests for the 1995 test work.  
 
Alexco excavated several test pits in the tailings area as part of an ongoing 
study of possible reclamation closure options (SRK, 2009).

6 Geological Setting 
 
The Elsa Tailings are the net result of 85 years of mining activity in the Keno 
Hill district.  As such a regional geology section is included in the report as 
background for the origin of tailings material.   
 

6.1 Background Regional Geology 
 
The Keno Hill mining camp is located in the north western part of the Selwyn 
Basin in central Yukon Territory, Canada. The area is characterized by the 
Robert Service Thrust Sheet and the Tombstone Thrust Sheet; these thrust 
sheets are overlapping and trend north-westerly. The area is underlain by 
Upper Proterozoic to Mississippian rocks that were deposited in a shelf 
environment during the formation of the northern Cordilleran continental 
margin (Figure 5). A compressional regime that possibly existed during the 
Jurassic, but certainly during the Cretaceous, produced thrusts, folds and 
penetrative fabrics of various scales. Early large scale deformation (D1) 
produced recumbent folds, resulting in local structural thickening of strata. A 
second  deformational event (D2; and possibly third, D3, Roots, 1997) 
produced gentle south westerly plunging syn- and anti-form pairs. Layering in 
these structures are axial planar to the D1 recumbent folds.  
 
The Robert Service Thrust Sheet is composed of Late Proterozoic to Cambrian 
sandstone, locally with interbedded limestone and argillite, a Cambrian to 
Middle Devonian succession of siltstone, limestone and chert, and Upper 
Devonian argillite, chert, and chert pebble conglomerate. The latter unit 
unconformably overlies the lower units. 
 
The Tombstone Thrust Sheet consists of Devonian phyllite, felsic meta-tuffs 
and metaclastic rocks, overlain by Carboniferous quartzite. This latter rock 
unit is locally thickened due to folding and or thrusting and hosts the 
mineralization of the Keno Hill camp.  
 
Intrusive rocks formed during four episodes of plutonism. Early Palaeozoic 
fine-grained diabase occurs as metre-scale dikes and sills in the Upper 
Proterozoic to Lower Cambrian rocks. During the Mid-Triassic, gabbros to 
diorites formed pods of various sizes, primarily in the Devonian and 
Mississippian rocks of the Tombstone Thrust Sheet. A third phase of 
plutonism took place around 92 million years ago in the early Cretaceous and 
resulted in widespread and voluminous Tombstone intrusions of commonly 
granitic to granodioritic composition. The youngest magmatic activity 
occurred around 65 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous and resulted in 
the formation of peraluminous megacrystic potassium feldspar granite. 
 
In addition to the Keno Hill silver mining camp, where polymetallic veins 
were exploited, the area hosts a number of occurrences and showings of 
tungsten, copper, gold, lead, zinc, antimony and barite. 
 
Tin, tungsten, and molybdenum occurrences are possibly related to the suite of 
Cretaceous intrusions, whereas lead, zinc, and barite occur in stratiform

6.2 Background Property Geology 
 
The local geology is characterized by three meta-sedimentary rock units: 
Lower Schist, Central Quartzite, and Upper Schist (Figure 6). Individual layers 
are thought to be conformal and are metamorphosed to greenschist facies 
assemblages.  Regional metamorphism is believed to have occurred in the 
Middle Cretaceous, about 105 million years ago.   
 
The Lower Schist is of Devonian to Mississippian age and is composed of 
graphitic, calcareous, and sericitic schist, thin and locally thick-bedded 
quartzite and minor greenstone of Middle Triassic age. The greenstone forms 
sills and/or boudins consisting of metadiorite and metagabbro. The sills and 
boudins form bodies up to one kilometre long and 30 metres thick. They occur 
primarily on Keno Hill. Weathering of the Lower Schist is pronounced and 
results in small silica fragments supported by a clay matrix.  The fast 
weathering prevents outcrops from forming. The lower contact of this unit has 
been truncated by the Tombstone Thrust Fault. 
 
The Mississippian Central Quartzite, also known as the Keno Hill Quartzite, 
has a structural thickness of approximately 700 metres and consists of bedded 
and massive quartzite with minor schist and phyllite layers as well as 
greenstone horizons, which occur most commonly in the lower half of the 
Central Quartzite. The thickness of this unit is especially great in the Keno Hill 
area, which is likely due to the presence of a D1 fold nose and accompanied 
structural thickening in the Keno Hill area.  Underground exposure has 
revealed tight isoclinal folding. Internal fracturing leaves the unit prone to 
weathering, resulting in the formation of felsenmeer down slope, where large 
slabs of quartzite accumulate. This unit is the most important host to the 
mineralization of the Keno Hill camp.   
 
A package of Cambrian quartz-mica schist, quartzite, graphitic schist, and 
minor limestone comprise the Upper Schist. The Robert Service Thrust Fault 
separates the Upper Schist from the younger Central Quartzite.

6.3 Tailings Property Geology 
 
The Elsa tailings lie on the south slope of the McQuesten valley.  The rounded 
out shape of the valley can be attributed to at least one episode of glaciation 
that was followed by the deposition of glaciofluvial sands and gravels related 
to kame terraces. The glaciofluvial sands and gravels were deposited at higher 
valley elevations with till deposited at lower valley sides and  valley bottoms.  
During the retreat of glacial ice, the McQuesten valley bottom was covered by 
a shallow lake resulting in the deposition of lacustrine silt. The lacustrine silt  
became increasingly organic and transitioned to peat as the glacial lake became 
in filled with sediments.   
 
Feed to the Elsa mill came solely from polymetallic vein deposits scattered 
throughout the Keno Hill district. Approximately 4.6 million tons of ore 
having an average head grade of 37.3 ounces. per ton silver, 6.4 percent lead 
and 4.4 percent zinc are documented to have been processed by the facility. 
Mill feed sources changed over time and the mineralogical character of the ore 
varied as a result. Production of near surface oxidized mineralization often 
contained ore minerals which were not readily amenable to flotation. A 
cyanide leach plant was employed to recover some of the silver not reporting 
to concentrates, but the economics associated with a fluctuating silver price 
forced the plant to run only intermittently. Zinc minerals occur erratically in 
the veins of Keno Hill and a zinc flotation concentrate was not always 
produced. From 1972 to 1988 zinc head grades averaged less than one percent 
and much of the metal was allowed to flow out in the tailings. Beginning in 
1979 open pits became an important source of mill feed lowering the overall 
head grade and supplying a mixed oxide and sulphide ore.

7 Deposit Types 
 
The Elsa Tailings cover an irregular area of approximately 130 hectares and 
range from 0.1 to over four metres in thickness. While the valley flank on 
which the tailings have been deposited is relatively smooth topographically, 
points of higher elevation occur as uncovered "islands" within the body of the 
tailing. The earliest site of tailings deposition appears to have been directly 
into Porcupine Creek with the material being mostly flushed downstream into 
Flat Creek. Beginning in 1946, tailings were directed away from the creeks 
proper producing small terraced accumulations immediately below the mill. 
Somewhat later a pipeline was constructed that discharged tailings further into 
the valley in the area between Porcupine and Flat Creek. An earthen dam (#1 
Dam) was constructed in 1958 across upper Flat Creek and the tailings 
discharge line moved again, this time to the east forcing material to be 
deposited behind the dam.  
 
Ten major mines supplied feed to the Elsa Mill during its operation. 
Production from the 1930s, 40s, and 1950s was dominated by high-grade 
deposits such as Elsa mine and Hector-Calumet mine on Galena Hill. The 
1960s saw a transition in ore sources with the reopening of the Silver King 
mine and discovery of the high-grade Husky deposit. The 1970s and 80s 
witnessed the demise of old producers and the introduction of lower grade 
material from open pits and smaller underground operations such as Ruby, No 
Cash and Keno 700.

8 Mineralization 
 

8.1 Tailings Composition 
 
The tailings consist of generally unconsolidated silty fine grained sand with 
minor medium sand and trace clay grained material, of a variable grey to light 
brown colour characterized by thin beds to laminae (Figure 7).   Exposures in 
test pits show that near surface the material is darker in colour suggesting it is 
more oxidized than the deeply buried tailings.  Detailed mineralogical 
examination shows that the sand grains are angular and locally aggregated and 
cemented by limonite. The dominant are quartz and siderite (80 percent) with 
the balance composed of muscovite and other silicate minerals along with 
pyrite. Occasional grains contain lead and zinc sulphides and trace amounts of 
lead and zinc oxide minerals have been identified via x-ray diffraction.  
 
The tailings material is moderately to weakly consolidated in some areas 
occasionally forming indurated crusts near the top of the tailings surface.  
Some pits examined by SRK show indurated crust at depth probably developed 
during previous surface exposure.  Small scale cross beds are observed locally 
in tailings pits. The sub-surface/tailings contact is typified by dark grey clays 
and silt as well as black organic matter as shown in pit trench near drill hole 
H19 in Figure 8.

10 Drilling 
 

10.1 Introduction 
 
The Elsa Tailings were drilled by UKHM and Alexco to delineate the 
geometry of the tailings, collect samples for assay and support evaluation of 
mineral resources.  A summary of the drilling completed on the tailings is 
provided in Table 1.

Alexco 2009 Sonic 283 910

 
 

10.2 Drilling Procedures 
 

10.2.1 UKHM Drilling 
 
In 1970 UKHM carried out a percussion drilling program targeting the thicker 
northern portion of the tailings.  A total of 114 vertical drill holes were drilled 
to an average depth of three metres.  Drill hole spacing was reported at 
approximately 60 metres.  Very little historical data is available for this drilling 
program. 
 
From 1987 to 1988 a second drilling program was completed by UKHM using 
a rotary drill for a total of 379 vertical holes (1,770 metres).  This program 
covered the southern portion of the tailings impoundment that was not covered 
by drilling completed in 1970.  Holes were spaced approximately 100 feet (30 
metres) apart.  Depths of tailings were determined by scrutinizing the drill 
cuttings for organic material and changes in sample grades.  Drill cuttings for 
the entire drilled interval were sent for analysis.  Limited assay certificates for 
this program are available. 
 
Alexco and SRK examined historical UKHM data and methodologies and 
concluded that drilling data is too unreliable to be used for resource evaluation 
and classification and does not conform to CIM best practice guidelines.  The 
main concerns are centred on non-coring drilling methods used by UKHM.  It 
is SRK's opinion that the drilling methodologies used by UKHM probably 
resulted in: 
 
 Sample contamination from the borehole wall ; and 
 Poor accuracy in determining the subsurface tailings contact.

10.2.2 Alexco Drilling 

 
Alexco drilled 283 vertical sonic drill holes over the deposit in 2009 for 910 
drilled metres.  The Alexco drilling campaign consisted of drill holes spaced at 
50 metres with lines orientated at an azimuth of 045 degrees (Figure 10).  
Average thickness of the drilled tailings is 2.3 metres ranging from a 
maximum thickness of 7.5 metres to a minimum of 0.2 metres.  As none of the 
drill holes exceeded 7.5 metres in depth. No down hole surveys were deemed 
necessary.   
 
Alexco contracted Boart-Longyear of Edmonton, Alberta to complete the 
drilling program using a sonic drill mounted on a tracked carrier.  A sonic drill 
uses simultaneous high-frequency vibrational and low-speed rotational motion 
accompanied by down-pressure to advance a flush thread drill pipe. As the 
drill string is advanced, material is pushed up into the pipe.  The drill bit used 
by Boart-Longyear was 3.854 inches (9.79 centimetres) in diameter.  No water 
or other fluids were used in the drilling process.   
 
Alexco drilling procedures consisted of drilling 5 foot (approximately 1.5 
metre) runs.  For each five foot run the drill string was removed from the hole 
in order to remove core.  Once it had been established that the tailings had 
been completely drilled and the tailings/subsurface interface had been reached, 
drilling was halted.  The base of the tailings was identified in most cases by a 
layer of organic material or visible changes in the oxidation and composition 
of the drill core. 
 
Core for each run was removed by vibrating the drill pipe so that core was 
slowly vibrated out of the pipe and in to a polyethylene sleeve that the drill 
helper pulled back as the sleeve was filled.  When sample recovery proved 
difficult, the hole was abandoned and a new hole was started in close 
proximity to the original hole.  
 
In some instances portions of the sample would fall out of the open ended bit 
as the pipe was pulled up after each run, particularly if the material was water 
saturated. The lost portion of the sample was retrieved in the following drill 
run or a new hole was drilled with an extra long run to "sandwich" saturated 
sections between firmer stretches of tailings or drill material. 
 
Polyethylene sleeves containing tailings cores were opened in trays for logging 
and sampling at each drill site. The cores were initially examined to establish 
that the lower tailings contact had been drilled. All drill core was then logged 
and photographed.  A typical core sample from drill hole P-13 is shown in 
Figure 9. 
 
Tailings core material is inherently difficult to handle as it is unconsolidated 
and, in some cases, is saturated with water. Because of the nature of the core 
material, challenges in core recovery, logging and sample collection can result 
from: 
 
 Water saturated material becoming very fluid;

 Compaction of drilled material during drilling process; 
 Bottom few centimetres of drill run may be left in hole; and 
 Recovery of unconsolidated material between drilling runs is difficult to 

assess. 
 
SRK completed the site visit before the sonic drilling program started and did 
not witness the execution of the drilling and sampling program. SRK was 
involved in the planning stage for the drilling program and discussed the 
program extensively with Alexco staff. SRK examined core photos and data 
from the drilling program. SRK is of the opinion that the drilling and sampling 
performed by Alexco was conducted with care and that the location and 
handling of the core yielded reasonable samples. 
 

10.3 Collar Survey 
 
Drill hole collar locations were established prior to drilling using a GPS in 
real-time communication with a base station operated by a professional 
surveyor. The base station occupied an established survey point which is part 
of the district wide survey control grid. The point is located immediately north 
of the tailings area. Survey accuracy is estimated to be within 20 centimetres. 
Proposed collars were marked with pickets and the drill holes drilled within 20 
centimetres of the location.

11 Sampling Approach and 
Methodology 
 
In most cases 1.5 metre (five foot) drill runs were employed during drilling, 
but very short runs and runs up to 3.05 metres in length were combined in 
some instances to produce a continuous series of core samples.  After logging, 
the entire core from each run interval was placed in a polyethylene sample bag 
securely closed with plastic zip ties.  A sample tag with a number from a 
continuous series was placed in the bag and the outside of the bag was marked 
with the same number. Sample intervals were variable but the contact between 
tailings and the previous surface always acted as a sample boundary.

12 Sample Preparation, Analyses and 
Security 
 
All polyethylene sample bags were packed in enclosed wooden crates with 
screws holding the lids in place. The crates were loaded into a covered semi-
trailer and shipped to a motor freight company depot in Whitehorse, Yukon 
where they were transferred to commercial freight trucks destined for the ISO 
9001 accredited ALS Chemex laboratory in North Vancouver, British 
Columbia.   
 

12.1.1 Sample Preparation and Analyses 
 
Upon arrival at the ALS Chemex laboratory, each entire sample was weighed 
and dried in a high temperature oven at 120 degrees Celsius.  Dry weight of 
the entire sample was then determined.  The dried sample was then 
homogenized and split into three subset samples of one kilogram using a rotary 
splitter.  One of the sample sub sets was then pulverized until 85 percent of the 
material was less than 75 micrometres.  The initial analytical method applied 
was inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (Chemex code 
ME-ICP61 and ME-OG62) using a four acid digestion on a one gram sample 
charge. Thirty-three elements including silver, lead and zinc were analyzed 
using this method.  Gold assays were analyzed using fire assay with atomic 
absorption spectrometry on a 30 gram sample charge (Chemex code Au-
AA25). The ALS Chemex Vancouver laboratory is also accredited ISO 17025 
by the Standards Council of Canada (Accreditation No. 579) for certain test 
procedures including the one used to assay the Elsa Tailings samples. 
 

12.1.2 Analytical Quality Control Measures 
 
Quality control samples were placed systematically into the sample stream. 
Every 20 samples contained at least one blank sample, one standard of known 
value, and one request for a duplicate assay of the previous sample. The blank 
material consisted of ordinary masonry sand.  
 
The standard material used by Alexco is PB 131 produced by WCM Minerals 
of Burnaby, British Columbia.  The reference material has been used 
successfully by Alexco previously as quality control sample for drilling 
programs at the Bellekeno deposit.  Although the material has not been 
certified, WCM Minerals recommended values are: 
 
Lead 1.04 % 
Zinc 1.89 % 
Silver 262 gpt 
 
Although no gold values for PB 131 are recommended Alexco used this 
material as a gold reference material.   
 
Results of the Alexco quality control assay results are provided in Appendix A.

12.1.3 Sampling Bias 

 
In the opinion of SRK, the quality control data collected by Alexco is 
comprehensive and the assaying results delivered by ALS Chemex are reliable 
for the purpose of resource estimation.  
 

12.1.4 Specific Gravity Data 
 
UKHM applied a blanket density of 1.6 to the tailings in their historic resource 
evaluation. There is no documentation detailing how they arrived at this value.   
 
Bulk density field measurements were determined in 2007 by SRK as part of a 
test pitting program.  A standard metal cylinder designed for testing was 
inserted into near surface tailings and removed without compressing the 
material so that the entire cylinder was filled with tailings.  The cylinder and 
tailings were then measured using a hand held spring scale.  The wet density of 
the material was then calculated by subtracting the weight of the cylinder from 
the weight of the cylinder plus tailings to determine the weight of the tailings 
material.  This weight was then divided by the volume of the cylinder to 
determine wet tailings density.  Dry density was measured by visually 
estimating moisture content.  The average measured density for tailings 
material was 1.9 grams per cubic centimetre.   
 
Alexco also conducted density measurements using 10 Shelby tubes, which 
were pushed into the tailings and removed by a drill rig.  This method was 
problematic because poor core recovery affected nearly all samples.  These 
results were not used for specific gravity investigations. 
 
The dry specific gravity for each of the 2009 sonic drill samples was measured 
for each of the assayed cores.  Dry density was determined using the dry 
weight of the sample from the assay laboratory divided by the sampled interval 
volume.  Sampled interval volume was calculated by interval length multiplied 
by the inside area of the core barrel which has an inside diameter of 0.0762 
metres.  Specific gravity results from this methodology ranged from 0.4 to 4.6 
with a mean of 1.7.   
 
The range of specific gravity results is problematic; however, extensive 
analysis and review of results by SRK and Alexco did not identify specific 
sources of possible errors that invalidate the entirety of the results.  Therefore, 
possible errors in measurements were attributed to the inherent difficulties of 
sampling unconsolidated material.  It is SRK's opinion that these specific 
gravity values are appropriate for use in estimating block specific gravity.

13 Data Verification 
 
SRK compared 10 percent of the drill hole data assays to original assay 
certificates.  No significant errors were found in the drill hole assay database. 
 
During the site visit, SRK examined three pits and briefly logged the pit walls.  
A summary of the logs are provided in Appendix B. 
 
The 2009 sonic drill hole program was completed after the SRK site visit.  As 
such drill core was not examined or reviewed by SRK.  As the entire drill core 
was sent for analysis, no core remained for subsequent examination.  SRK did 
review Alexco drill core photos taken immediately before sampling.

15 Mineral Processing and 
Metallurgical Testing 
 

15.1 Introduction 
 
The following is based on a note from Kappes, Cassiday & Associates of 
Reno, Nevada dated June 3, 2010 that summarizes test work completed to date. 
 

15.2 Summary of Metallurgical Test Work 
 
A series of metallurgical tests have been run on individual and composite 
samples of the Keno Hill Tailings material.  The existing test work is 
preliminary in nature and is focused on identifying the best method for silver 
recovery.  The results presented herein detail the recovery of silver and show 
that silver can be recovered using standard hydrometallurgical techniques. 
 
In late 2009, the laboratory facility of Kappes, Cassiday & Associates 
("KCA") in Reno, Nevada, received reject and pulp sample splits from ALS 
Chemex .  The samples received were either pulp samples previously prepared 
by ALS Chemex or reject (drill cuttings) material.  The samples received 
represented drill sampling of the Keno Hill Tailings located in the Yukon.  
 

15.3 Sample Composition 
 
Alexco provided an aerial photograph of the tailings showing the drill hole 
identification numbers divided into four separate locations.  The drill hole 
numbers were cross referenced to KCA sample numbers and four composite 
samples were created from the reject material. 
 

15.4 Cyanide Shake Tests 
 
A portion of the 548 previously prepared pulp samples from ALS Chemex 
were used for cyanide shake tests.  These shake test were conducted over a 
period of 24 hours at room temperature using a shaking table. The samples 
were then centrifuged and the solution was decanted and analyzed for silver 
utilizing flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (FAAS) methods.  Each 
sample was tested individually.  For this report the results of the shake tests 
were averaged to generate an estimated overall recovery for the tailings 
material.  The results are shown in Table 2. 
 

15.5 Bottle Roll Tests 
 
A series of 40 bottle roll leach tests were conducted to determine the maximum 
amount of cyanide leachable silver.  Tests were conducted at various cyanide 
concentrations and grind sizes typical of an agitated leach process.  The 
average results are shown in Table 2.

15.6 Column Leach Tests 
 
Column leach tests were conducted to determine the maximum amount of 
recoverable silver in a heap leach.  Because the tailings have been ground to a 
p80 of 200 microns KCA conducted a number of agglomeration and 
percolation tests.  These tests help to quantify the amount of cement necessary 
to build a stable production heap that will maintain permeability.  The results 
of these tests showed that the tailings material needs a significant amount of 
cement to meet desired requirements.   
 
The column leach program is currently underway.  At the time this report was 
issued only one set of column leach test data was available.  The material in 
this set of column leach tests was agglomerated with 25 kg/tonne of cement.  
Percolation was poor and another set of tests is planned at higher cement 
levels.  The material with 25 kg/tonne cement continues to leach showing that 
silver recovery is possible even under less than ideal conditions.   
 
The existing column leach results are incomplete as the tailings have only been 
under leach for 36 days.  The incomplete silver recovery is shown in Table 2. 
 
Table 2 summarizes the recoveries and chemical consumptions for the various 
tests conducted by KCA on the Keno Hill Tailings.

Consumptions.

The silver recoveries shown in Table 2 represent the results of the current 
metallurgical testing program.  Due to the fact that these tests are preliminary 
there exists the potential to increase silver recovery with further metallurgical 
test work.

16 Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve Estimates 
 

16.1 Introduction 
 
In July 2009, SRK was commissioned by Alexco to prepare a mineral resource 
estimate for the Elsa Tailings Project.  The resource estimate follows two 
historical resource estimates completed by UKHM.   
 
The resource estimation work was completed in Toronto by Mr. G. David 
Keller, P. Geo (APGO #1235) an "independent qualified person" as this term 
is defined in National Instrument 43-101. 
 
The mineral resource statement presented herein represents the first resource 
evaluation prepared for the Elsa Tailings Project for Alexco. 
 
This section describes the resource estimation methodology used by SRK and 
summarizes the key assumptions and parameters used to prepare the mineral 
resource model for the Elsa Tailings Project. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable 
representation of the mineral resources found in the project at the current level 
of sampling.  The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with 
generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserves Best Practices" guidelines and are reported in accordance with 
Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101.  Mineral 
resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will 
be converted into mineral reserve.  
 

16.2 Resource Data 
 
Data used to evaluate the mineral resources for the Elsa Tailings Project was 
provided by Alexco as an Access database containing drilling information for 
283 drill holes from the 2009 sonic drilling program.  No historical data was 
used for this project.  The data set comprises 546 sampled intervals with silver, 
lead, zinc and gold assays for each interval.   
 
SRK has validated the data by: 
 
 Checking the minimum and maximum values for each quality value field 

and confirming those outside of expected ranges; 
 Checking for gaps, overlaps and out of sequence intervals for both assay 

and lithology tables; and 
 Reviewing of analytical quality control data. 
 
It is SRK's opinion that the drill hole database is appropriate for the estimation 
of mineral resources.

16.3 Solid Body Modelling 
 
The tailings were modelled by Alexco.  Alexco combined the upper and lower 
surfaces to generate a three dimensional wireframe model.  High resolution 
topographic survey over the tailings and mapping tailings extents from drilling 
and air photo interpretation were used to generate an upper surface.  The lower 
surface was generated from tailings/sub-surface contacts determined from 
sonic drilling data. 
 
SRK reviewed the Alexco wireframe model and considers it accurate and 
appropriate for the estimation of mineral resources. 
 

16.4 Domaining 
 
SRK investigated the spatial distribution of assays and composites over the 
tailings area generating grade contours maps for gold, silver, zinc and lead.  
Based on these contour plots the main tailings area was subdivided into five 
domains.  Contiguous high and low grade domains were generated for gold 
and silver-lead assays.  As these domains represent distinct grade distributions 
the domains overlap and are not contiguous with each other metal domains.  A 
separate domain comprising of the entire main tailings area was generated for 
variables that did not show distinct distributions of the tailings area.  A sixth 
separate domain was created for an isolated area in the Porcupine Creek, in a 
gully above the main tailings area.  This domain is discrete from all metal 
grades and specific gravity values defining other tailings domains.  Domains 
generated by SRK are listed below: 
 
 AGHG-high grade silver-lead;  
 AGLG-low grade silver-lead; 
 AUHG-high grade gold; 
 AULG-low grade gold; 
 ZINC-not domained, includes dry specific gravity; and 
 Proximal-isolated tailings in gully above main tailings area. 
 
The High Grade, Low Grade, and Proximal domains are shown in Figure 11.  
The AGHG domain is delineated on the basis of silver grade contours and is 
situated on the southwest margin of the main tailings.  The AGLG domain 
occupies all areas not covered by the AGHG domain.  Both AGLG and AGHG 
domains were used to estimate silver and lead grades only.  The AUHG 
domain is delineated by gold contours and occupies the southern to south-
eastern margin of the main tailings.  The AULG domain covers all areas not 
covered by AUHG.  Zinc grades do not show any distinct grade zoning and 
therefore cover the entire main tailings area excluding the Proximal domain.  
Similarly, specific gravity data do not show any distinct zoning and therefore 
cover the entire tailings area (ZINC) excluding the proximal domain.

16.5 Statistical Analysis and Compositing 
 

16.5.1 Assays 
 
A summary of raw undomained and uncomposited raw assay data for the 
tailings is provided in Table 3.  Drill hole data was composited to a length of 
1.5 metres based on 87.7 percent of sampled intervals being at 1.5 metres as 
shown Figure 12.  A check of the sample lengths for each of the eight domains 
yielded similar results.   
 
Composite statistics for each of the eight domains are summarized in 
Appendix C.  A review of composite statistics, cumulative frequency 
histogram plots, and an examination of the spatial distribution of higher grades 
in the tailings model indicate that capping is not required.  Cumulative 
frequency plots for the low grade silver domain are provided in Figure 13.

16.5.2 Specific Gravity 

 
Specific gravity measurements of dry sonic drilling material resulted in a wide 
range of results from 0.4 to 4.6.  The wide range of values particularly above 
4.0 and below 1.0 is of some concern and SRK undertook a number of analysis 
and examinations:  
 
 Back calculation of lead and zinc grades to galena and zinc densities core 

specific gravity; 
 Scattergram plots of specific gravity values with assay grades and sample 

length; 
 Generation of specific gravity variograms with uncapped data and using 

caps on low and high values; and 
 Visual examination of spatial occurrence of high and low values in model. 
 
The above checks did not provide conclusive evidence that the specific gravity 
data was biased or that the data was seriously flawed.  Based on this, SRK 
concludes that variations observed in the specific gravity data are due to the 
inherent challenges of sampling unconsolidated material but that the data is of 
sufficient quality for use in resource estimation.  Summary statistics for 
specific gravity composites are provided by domain Appendix C. 
 
Drill hole specific gravity data were composited at 1.5 metres and capped 
using a low capping value of 0.75 (any values blow 0.75 where assigned a 
value of 0.75) and a high capping value of 4.0.  No specific gravity values 
were capped in the Proximal domain but 11 values were capped (2 high caps 
and 9 low caps) in the ZINC domain. 
 

16.6 Variography 
 
Variography was undertaken to characterize the spatial continuity of the metal 
grade data and specific gravity within each resource domain and to determine 
appropriate grade estimation ranges.  Variogram models were developed for 
the AULG, AGLG, and ZINC domains only for the X and Y directions as 
there were insufficient composites for developing variograms in the Z 
direction.  Variograms for gold were generated in the AULG domain, silver 
and lead in the AGLG domain, zinc dry specific gravity (DSG) in the ZINC 
domain.  In developing the variograms, a nugget effect of about 20 percent was 
assumed for all variograms.  Two structured variograms were developed for 
the three domains.  The variogram for silver is presented in Figure 14.  Other 
variograms are presented in Appendix D. 
 
Variograms were not generated for the high grade domains and the proximal 
domain as there were too few composites for analysis.  AULG and AGLG 
variogram models were assumed for high grade gold (AUHG) and silver-lead 
domains (AGHG) as well as the Proximal domain.  The DSG variogram was 
also assumed for Proximal domain specific gravity estimation.  A summary of 
variogram model parameters is given in Appendix D.

16.7 Block Model Parameters 
 
A sub-blocked model for the Elsa Tailings was generated using Datamine 
Studio 3.  The block model coordinates are based on the local UTM 
coordinated grid (NAD 83, Zone 8).  The parent block size is 10 by 10 by 10 
metres which are sub-blocked to 1.25 metres in the X and Y directions and 
0.01 metres in the Z direction.   
 
The block model Z direction of 10 metres was designed to be larger than 
maximum thickness of the tailings so that one block covers the entire thickness 
of tailings in each block.  SRK considers vertical variations of grade in the 
deposit too small scale to model accurately with the sampling data available. 
This is not considered an important factor from a mining perspective.  
Similarly, the block model was chosen to be horizontal rather than inclined as 
the deposit slopes at an average of less than two degrees.  The definition of the 
Elsa block model is presented in Table 4.

16.8 Grade Estimation 
 
Metal grades and specific gravity were estimated using ordinary kriging. Metal 
grades were estimated separately in each domain from capped composite data 
from that domain.   
 
Metal grades and specific gravity were estimated in a single run using ordinary 
kriging and considered hard boundaries for all domains.  Only composites 
within each domain were used to estimate domain blocks.  Silver and lead 
grades were estimated only for AGHG, AGLG domains.  The ZINC domains 
were used to estimate zinc and specific gravity values and the HGAU and 
LGAU domains were used to estimate gold only.  All metal grades and 
specific gravity values were estimated in the Proximal domain.  As vertical 
grade variations across the tailings thickness are not considered, a large radius 
of 40 metres was used for the search ellipse Z range.  Estimation parameters 
for all estimates are: 
 
 Search ellipse range, 500 by 500 by 40 metres (X, Y and Z directions); 
 Minimum composites per estimate: eight; and 
 Maximum composites per estimate: 150. 
 
Estimates were made using full blocks only, with full block values assigned to 
each sub-block contained in the full sized block.  A cross-section of the 
estimated block model with estimated grades is provided in Figure 15and 
Figure 16.  A three dimensional view of the estimated silver grade block model 
is provided in Figure 17.

16.9 Estimation Validation 
 
Estimates were verified by comparing estimated block values to composite and 
uncomposited drill hole data.  Additional verification was undertaken using 
cross validation and comparing ordinary kriging estimates against two other 
estimators for the low grade silver domain at no cut-off (inverse distance 
power of two and nearest neighbour).  All validation checks confirm that the 
block estimates are appropriate and reflect the underlying borehole sampling 
data. 
 

16.10 Mineral Resource Classification 
 
Mineral Resources for the Elsa Tailings Project have been classified according 
to the "CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definition and 
Guidelines" (December, 2005) by Mr. G. David Keller, P. Geo (APGO#1235) 
an "Independent Qualified Person" as defined by National Instrument 43-101. 
 
While drilling and sampling procedures, tightly spaced drilling, and assay 
results provide a high level of confidence, the inherent challenges related to 
drilling and sampling unconsolidated material are reflected in significant 
outliers in specific gravity determinations that could not be fully explained by 
expected specific gravity ranges or measurable sampling errors.  For this 
reason,  SRK is of the opinion that it is appropriate to classify the Elsa Tailings 
resource blocks as Indicated because the estimates are based on detailed and 
reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate

techniques that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity 
to be reasonably assumed. The level of confidence in the estimates is sufficient 
to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of this deposit.   
 

16.11 Mineral Resources Statement 
 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(December 2005) defines a Mineral Resource as: 
 

"[A] concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid 
inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized minerals in or on the 
Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality 
that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral 
Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge." 

 
The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally 
implies that quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and 
that mineral resources are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade taking into 
account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries.  For the tailings 
deposit, a potentially economic cut-off grade was determined to be 50 grams 
per tonne ("gpt") silver based on the following assumptions:   
 
 Silver price US$17 per troy ounce; 
 Gold price US$1,000 per troy ounce; 
 Heap leach recovery of 85 and 35 percent for silver and gold, respectively; 

and 
 Mining, processing and G&A costs of US$18.92 per tonne. 
 
As all estimated block silver grades in the model are above 50 gpt, it is SRK's 
opinion that all material within the Elsa Tailings block model can be 
adequately reported as a Mineral Resource amenable for surface mining within 
the meaning of CIM Definition Standards. 
 
Mineral Resources were estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 
"Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" 
guidelines. The Mineral Resources may be affected by further infill and 
exploration drilling that may result in increases or decreases in subsequent 
resource estimates. The mineral resources may also be affected by subsequent 
assessments of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, socio-
economic and other factors.  
 
The Mineral Resources for the Elsa Tailings Project are estimated at 2.49 
million tonnes at 119 gpt silver, 0.12 gpt gold, 0.99 percent lead, and 0.70 
percent zinc at a 50 gpt silver cut-off grade.  All tailings material has been 
found to be potentially economic.  The mineral resource statement for the Elsa 
Tailings deposit is presented in Table 5.  A tonnage and grade chart for the 
model is provided in Figure 18.

18 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
Exploration work by Alexco is professionally managed and procedures used 
conform to industry best practice. During the SRK review, challenges in 
sampling unconsolidated material were recognized particularly with respect to 
the measurement of dry specific gravity values.  However, it is SRK's opinion 
that these challenges do not materially impact on the quality of the resource 
estimates reported herein. SRK is of the opinion that the exploration data are 
sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the estimated boundaries of 
the block model and support evaluation and classification of mineral resources 
in accordance with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource 
and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" and CIM "Definition Standards for 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves" guidelines. 
 
Six non-contiguous and in some cases overlapping domains were generated by 
SRK to separate high grade zones for silver, lead and gold.  An additional 
domain was generated for a physically distinct tailings area that is separate 
from the main tailings.  Metal grades were estimated separately for each 
domain using ordinary kriging.  Capping was not applied to metal assays or 
composites.  Dry specific gravity composites were capped, using a lowest and 
highest capping value.   
 
After validation and classification, SRK used silver and gold grades to 
determine "reasonable prospects for economic extraction."  The basis of this 
determination were metal grades, heap leach recoveries and estimated mining 
and processing costs from comparable projects.   
 
The mineral resource statement prepared by SRK is reported at a silver cut-off 
grade of 50 gpt which is based on the likely extraction scenario.  All material 
in the resource estimate is above this grade. 
 
Alexco has identified other areas adjacent to unestimated or currently 
modelled areas as outlined in Figure 19.

19 Recommendations 
 
It is SRK's opinion that resources for the Elsa Tailings Project have been 
defined to sufficient accuracy to support the preparation of a Preliminary 
Economic Assessment ("PEA").  Alexco has embarked on extensive 
metallurgical test work to document the metallurgical properties of the tailings 
material and evaluate appropriate processing options. This aspect is critical for 
the PEA study.   
 
In addition, untested areas containing additional tailings are known to occur 
peripherally to the current resource area. These zones offer potential to 
increase the current resource and are recommended for exploration sampling.  
Estimated costs for the recommended programs are summarized in Table 6. 
 

Table 6.  Estimated Costs of Recommended Programs. 

Program Cost [CD$] 
Preliminary Economic Assessment $200,000 
Drilling Program $50,000 
Total $250,000
