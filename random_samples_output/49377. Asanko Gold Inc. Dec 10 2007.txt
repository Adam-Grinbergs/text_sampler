1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

Coffey Mining Pty Ltd ("Coffey") has been commissioned by Keegan Resources Incorporated 
("Keegan") to prepare an Independent Technical Report on the Esaase Gold Project in the 
country of Ghana, West Africa, in order to provide an update of the Mineral Resources as at 
19th October 2007.  This report complies with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth 
in the Canadian Venture Exchange (CNDX) Corporate Finance Manual, National Instrument 
43-101, Companion Policy 43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1. 

1.2 Location 

The Esaase Gold Project is located in southwest Ghana, West Africa, approximately 35km 
northeast of the regional capital Kumasi.  Travel time between Kumasi and Esaase is 
approximately 1 hour by car.  The concession is reached by tarred and secondary lateritic 
roads. 

1.3 Ownership 

The Esaase Gold Project and the mining lease on which it is based are owned 100% by 
Keegan Resources Ghana, a fully owned subsidiary of Keegan.  The Government of Ghana 
retains the right to take a 10% interest in the project under Section 8 of the Ghanaian Mining 
Act.  The Lease is also subject to a 3.5% NSR owed to the Government of Ghana. 

1.4 Geology 

The Esaase gold project area contains a system of gold-bearing quartz veins hosted by tightly 
folded Birimian-age sedimentary rocks.  This package includes mudstones, siltstones, and 
lesser feldspathic sandstones. 

The Esaase resource area is defined by a distinctive structural boundary that divides the more 
deformed, altered and mineralized siltstone shale unit in the hanging wall from the more 
massively bedded greywacke in the footwall.  All rocks in the siltstone/shale package are 
moderately to strongly folded and foliated with shale generally displaying better development 
of foliation than siltstone. 

1.5 Mineralisation 

The veins are synkinematic, forming as sets of sub-vertical and horizontal to gently dipping 
veins.  Most veins are folded about the dominant axial plane cleavage. 



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  2 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

The lower grade zones (1 to 5g/t Au) and up to 100m in width occur in strong quartz -sericite - 
iron carbonate - sulphide altered metasediments, The overall trend of these bodies is 
northeast with a moderate dip to the west.  The higher grade quartz veins which are currently 
the focus of artisanal mining in the area (5 to 127g/t Au), trend north and have dips that vary 
from vertical to sub-horizontal. 

1.6 Project Status 

Keegan has completed an initial wide spaced exploration program and have defined a maiden 
inferred resource.  The project is currently at the stage of infill drilling to increase the current 
identified resource classification. 

1.7 Resources 

Resource estimates for the Esaase Gold Project have been generated by Coffey Mining on 
the basis of analytical results available up to 30th September 2007.  The resource model was 
derived via geological interpretation and modelling of the mineralised zone. 

Multiple Indicator Kriging ('MIK') estimation with indirect lognormal change of support to 
emulate mining selectivity was selected as an appropriate estimation method based on the 
quantity and spacing of available data, and the interpreted controls on, and styles of, 
mineralisation under review. 

Coffey Mining also completed a detailed assessment of all analytical quality control data 
applied in resource estimation.  At the time of resource estimation, no material bias had been 
identified, and the analytical precision for both field duplicate and re-assay data lie within 
accepted industry limits. 

The summarised Resource Statement in Table 1.7_1 has been determined as at 
19th October 2007 and has been prepared and reported in accordance with Canadian National 
Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of February 2001 (the 
Instrument) and the classifications adopted by CIM Council in December 2005.  The resource 
estimate has been classified as an Indicated and Inferred Resource based on the confidence of 
the input data, geological interpretation, and grade estimation. 

Furthermore, the resource classification is also consistent with the Australasian Code for the 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of December 2004 
(the Code) as prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of 
Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Mineral Council of Australia 
(JORC).

1.8 Conclusions 

The geological understanding of the Esaase Gold Project has evolved greatly since the 
commencement of the Keegan exploration program.  The knowledge acquired to date and 
exploration success over the last two years confirms the potential of Esaase and surrounding 
areas. 

1.9 Recommendations 

Coffey considers that the proposed exploration and development strategy is entirely 
appropriate and reflects the potential of the Esaase Gold Project.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Background Information on Ghana 

The Republic of Ghana is a West African country covering 239,460 square kilometres (about 
the size of Britain).  It is one of the five African nations along the northern coastline of the Gulf 
of Guinea, and is bordered on the west by Cote d'Ivoire, to the north by Burkina Faso, and to 
the east by Togo.  The country consists mostly of low savannah regions with a hilly central 
belt of forest.  Ghana's distinguishing geographic feature is the Volta River, on which was built 
the Akosombo Dam in 1964.  The damming of the Volta created the enormous Lake Volta, 
which occupies a sizeable portion of Ghana's south-eastern territory.  The country lies 
immediately north of the equator and has a largely tropical climate. 

Ghana's population is estimated at 22.9 million (July 2007), generally concentrated in the 
south of the country.  The capital, Accra, is a modern coastal city with a population rapidly 
approaching 2 million people.  The second largest city, Kumasi, lies in the heart of the Ashanti 
region and has about 860,000 people.  Ghana has a large variety of African tribal or sub-
ethnic units.  The main groups include the Akan (44%), Moshi-Dagomba (16%), Ewe (13%) 
and Ga (8%) people.  Birth rates are high compared with world averages and the annual rate 
of population growth is one of the highest in the world, although about average for sub-
Saharan Africa.  Ghana has a relatively young population, with almost one-half of the total 
population less than 20 years of age.  More than two-thirds of the population live in rural 
areas.  The majority of the population are Christian (63%).  The northern ethnic groups are 
largely Muslim (16%).  Indigenous beliefs (21%) are also practised throughout the country.  
English is the official language.  Twi is the most widely spoken African language.  Ghana 
consists of 10 administrative regions.  The country is bisected by the Greenwich meridian and 
operates on Greenwich Mean Time. 

Throughout the first half of the twentieth century Ghana (then known as the Gold Coast) was 
a British colony.  It was the first sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to be granted 
independence on 6 March 1957.  Following a national referendum, it became a republic in 
July 1960.  Between 1966 and 1992 periods of democratic rule alternated with military rule.  
By 1992 the economy had stabilised, a new constitution was put in place and Ghana returned 
to democracy with the election of Jerry Rawlings as president.  Rawling's National Democratic 
Congress party continued in power throughout the 1990s, being replaced by the New Patriotic 
Party in the 2000 democratic election.  Ghana has now enjoyed 17 years of continuous 
democratic rule, with political freedoms and stability which are the envy of other African 
countries.  Ghana is governed under a multiparty democratic system, with elected presidents 
allowed to hold power for a maximum of two terms of four years.  The most recent election 
was held in December 2004 and was won for the second time in a row by the New Patriotic 
party.  The re-elected president is John Kufour.  Next elections are to be held in December 
2008.  The constitution prevents presidents from running for a third term.

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

Ghana has a developing mixed economy based largely on agriculture and mining.  Despite 
economic difficulties, it is still one of the most developed countries in tropical Africa.  The 
gross national product ("GNP") is growing about as rapidly as the population.  The GNP per 
capita is among the lowest in the world, though it is above average for western Africa.  The 
domestic economy of Ghana is dominated by subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 
about 37% of the gross domestic product ("GDP").  Most of the working population (60%) 
grow food crops (plantain, cassava, maize, yams, rice, groundnuts, etc) for local consumption.  
The most important cash crop is cocoa.  Lesser cash crops include palm oil, rubber, coffee 
and coconuts.  Cattle are farmed in northern Ghana.  The most important source of foreign 
exchange is gold mining, followed by cocoa and timber products.  Manganese, bauxite and 
diamonds are also mined.  Tourism is growing rapidly.  Gold represents Ghana's major export 
commodity.  Ghana is the world's tenth and Africa's second largest producer of gold, with gold 
production of 2.0Moz in 2005.  The unit of Ghanaian currency is the Ghanaian Cedi.  The 
exchange rate is presently 0.99 Ghana Cedis to the US dollar. 

Ghana has substantial natural resources and a much higher per capita output than many 
other countries in West Africa.  Nevertheless, it remains dependent on international financial 
and technical assistance.  Inflation, decreasing currency exchange rate and high interest rates 
have caused concern in recent years, but are improving with more stringent fiscal and 
monetary policies.  Since the early 1980s, the government of Ghana has made a sustained 
effort to improve and liberalise the fiscal policies of the country in order to attract private 
investment and stimulate economic growth.  Many state-owned companies have been 
privatised.  The result has been a sustained period of real economic growth and an 
improvement in the country's balance of payments.  However, persistent problems remain 
such as relatively high inflation and unemployment rates. 

Under the constitution of Ghana the judiciary is independent of government and cannot be 
overruled by the president or the parliament.  The head of the judiciary is the Chief Justice.  
The judiciary rules on civil, criminal and constitutional matters.  The system includes the 
Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court and Regional Tribunals.  There is also a 
Judicial Council, with representatives from all parts of the justice system, which acts as a 
forum to observe and review the functioning of the judiciary and to recommend reforms to 
government.  The constitution also dictates that there is an Attorney General who is a Minister 
of State and is the principal legal adviser to the government. 

4.2 Project Location 

The Esaase concession is located in southwest Ghana, West Africa (Figure 4.2_1).  It is 
located in the Amansi East district, in the Ashanti Region, approximately 35km northeast of 
the regional capital Kumasi.

Figure 4.2_1 
Location of Esaase Concession SW Ghana 

 
4.3 Land Area 

The Esaase mining concession is approximately 10km in a northeast direction by 4km in a 
northwest direction covering 42.32km2.  The centre of the concession is located at 1º 53' west, 
6º 34' north.  The concession boundaries have not been legally surveyed, but are described 
by latitude and longitude via decree.  Figure 4.3_1 depicts a plan map of Esaase concession, 
showing creeks, contours, roads, and concession boundary. 

Coffey Mining has not independently verified, nor is it qualified to independently verify, the 
legal status of the mineral properties in Ghana in which Keegan is understood to have an 
interest.  In preparing this report, Coffey Mining has assumed that the properties are lawfully 
accessible for evaluation and also mineral production. 

4.4 Mining Claim Description, Agreements and Encumbrances 

The Esaase Permit has been granted by the Government of Ghana.  The permits have been 
granted to Keegan by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and cannot be contested by any other 
company.  The government maintains a 10% carried interest in all permits within the country.  
This government interest does not occur until the Exploitation Stage. 

The Esaase Permit is classified as a mining permit and allows the company to carry out 
mining provided certain conditions and fee payments are maintained with the Ministry of 
Mines and Energy.  All mining permits granted in Ghana are for a thirty year period.  The 
Esaase lease was granted on 4th September 1990 to Bonte Gold Mining, which subsequently 
went into bankruptcy in 2002.

Esaase Licence 

 
Sammetro Company Limited (Sammetro) subsequently bought the concession from the Bonte 
Liquidation Committee (BLC) set up by the Ghanaian Government.  Keegan entered into an 
option agreement on the 3rd May, 2006 with Sammetro to purchase a 100% interest in the 
property (subject to the 10% government carried interest and a 0.5% NSR owed to BLC). 

The original agreement made on the 3rd May, 2006 included:- 

 Cash payments of US$100,000 to the bank from which Sammetro borrowed funds by 
May 17, 2006 (paid), 

 US$100,000 to Sammetro by June 30, 2006, which payment Sammetro delivered to the 
BLC (paid), 

 US$100,000 to the BLC by December 30, 2006 (paid), 

 US$40,000 to Sammetro on May 3, 2007 (obligation renegotiated, see below), 

 US$100,000 to the BLC by June 30, 2007(paid), 

 US$100,000 to the BLC by December 30, 2007 (paid), 

 US$50,000 to Sammetro on May 3, 2010 and every year thereafter until production 
(obligation renegotiated, see below), 



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  12 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

 US$200,000 to the BLC on production (paid in advance); and 

 US$100,000 to Sammetro on production (obligation renegotiated, see below). 

Keegan also agreed to the Issuance of 780,000 common shares of Keegan to Sammetro over 
a three year period with 40,000 common shares of Keegan to Sammetro upon exchange 
approval (issued); 120,000 common shares of Keegan to Sammetro on May 3, 2007 
(obligation renegotiated, see below); 240,000 common shares of Keegan  to Sammetro on 
May 3, 2008; and 380,000 common shares of Keegan to Sammetro on May 3, 2009 
(obligation renegotiated, see below).  Keegan entered into a finder's fee agreement dated 
June 5, 2006, whereby Keegan paid US$10,000 and issued 4,000 common shares as finder's 
fees with respect to this acquisition. 

On June 14, after having already issued the cash and share payments and completing the full 
work expenditure indicated in the previous paragraphs Keegan announced that it had signed 
a new option agreement so that all further unpaid cash and share payments to Sammetro 
were no longer owed. In lieu of these payments, Keegan paid $850,000 to a creditor of 
Sammetro and issued 40,000 additional common shares to Sammetro subsequent to the 
period.  During the period, Keegan paid a finder's fee of US$85,000 with respect to the 
renegotiation of the option agreement. 

Keegan was subsequently granted the full Esaase Mining Lease by the Minerals Commission 
and Minister of Mines, Lands and Forestry with no further obligation to any party aside from 
the NSR and government commitments. 

4.5 Environmental Liabilities 

The Bonte Gold Mining alluvial operation has resulted in a large silting of the associated 
drainage system utilised by the dredging operation. 

Under the agreement with the liquidation committee acting on behalf of the Ghanaian 
Government, Keegan assumes no environmental liability to any resulting environmental 
liabilities arising form the operations of Bonte Gold Mines. 

4.6 Permits 

All resources and areas of more significant exploration potential defined to date lie within the 
Esaase Permit.  The Permit provides Keegan the right to explore for minerals and also to 
mine under the general mining code of Ghana.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

The concession is accessed from Kumasi city by taking an asphalt road west 10km to the 
Bibiani Junction at Asenemuso and then southwest 10km to the village of Wioso.  At Wioso a 
secondary asphalt road is taken 8km south to the village of Amankyea then by secondary 
gravel roads a further 11km via the villages of Ahewerwa and Tetrem.  The Esaase project is 
accessed by a series of secondary roads and footpaths. 

5.2 Physiography and Climate 

The annual rainfall is in the range of 1500mm to 2000mm with temperatures ranging from 
22°C to 36°C.  A major rainy season occurs from April to July followed by a minor one from 
September through to October. 

The concession is drained by the Bonte River.  The Bonte River is bounded on both sides by 
steep hills that reach heights of approximately 500mASL.  The area is predominantly 
subsistence farmland producing mainly food crops such as plantain, corn, cassava, yam, 
tomatoes and some cash crop such as cocoa and oil palm.  About 50% of this land is covered 
with secondary forest and thick brush.  The valley floor has been extensively placer mined 
and now consists primarily of placer tailings. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Esaase exploration camp and surrounding villages are connected to the national 
electrical grid.  Mobile phone communication is accessible in most parts of the concession.  A 
satellite dish is installed in the exploration camp for internet access.  The nearest medical 
clinic and police station are located at Toase-Nkawie, on the Bibiani Highway, 20km from the 
exploration camp.  Hospitals and most government offices are available in Kumasi.  Food and 
general supplies are also purchased in Kumasi

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Ownership and Exploration History 

The Bonte area has a long history of artisanal mining, associated with the Ashanti Kingdom.  
There is also evidence of adits driven by European settlers, between the period 1900 to 1939, 
although no documented records remain of this activity. 

In 1966 to 1967 the Bonte river valley alluvial sediments were drilled and an historical 
estimated resource was defined of 22 million m3 at 0.24g/t Au.  In 1990, the Bonte mining 
lease was granted to Akrokerri-Ashanti Gold Mines (AAGM) and was later transferred to 
Bonte Gold Mining (BGM), a local subsidiary of AAGM.  BGM had reportedly recovered an 
estimated 200,000oz of alluvial gold on the Esaase concession and another 300,000oz 
downstream on the Jeni River concession, prior to entering into receivership in 2002. 

The Esaase mining concession, including the camp facilities at Tetrem, was bought from the 
Bonte Liquidation Committee by Sametro Company Limited, a private Ghanaian company.  In 
May, 2006, Keegan signed a letter of agreement with Sametro to earn 90% of the Esaase 
mining concession over a 3 year period of work commitments and option payments.  The 
government of Ghana retains the remaining 10%. 

Since mid 2006, Keegan has undertaken an aggressive exploration program combining soil 
geochemistry and IP geophysical surveys followed by diamond and reverse circulation 
exploration and resource drilling. 

6.2 Resource and Reserve History 

To the authors' knowledge, no previous Resource Estimate has been carried out on the hard 
rock component of the Esaase Gold Deposit.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The geology of Ghana is comprised predominantly of rocks of the Birimian (2.17-2.18Ga) and 
to a lesser extent of units of the Tarkwaian (2.12-2.14Ga, after Davis et al. 1994). 

The Birimian consists of narrow greenstone (volcanic) belts, which can be traced for hundreds 
of kilometres along strike but are usually only 20 to 60km wide, separated by wider basins of 
mainly marine clastic sediments.  Along the margins of the basins and belts there appears to 
be considerable interbedding of basin sediments and volcanoclastic and pyroclastic units of 
the volcanic belts.  Thin but laterally extensive chemical sediments (exhalites), consisting of 
cherts, fine-grained manganese-rich and graphitic sediments, often mark the transitional 
zones.  The margins of the belts commonly exhibit faulting on local and regional scales.  
These structures are fundamentally important in the development of gold deposits for which 
the region is well known. 

The Tarkwaian on the other hand, consist of a distinctive sequence of metasediments 
(quartzites, conglomerates and phyllites) occurring within a broad band along the interior of 
the Ashanti Belt.  They host important paleoplacer gold deposits in the Tarkwa district.  
Equivalent rock types occur in other belts of the region but in relatively restricted areas.  In the 
type locality at Tarkwa, the sequence is in the order of 2.5km thick, whereas in the Bui belt, 
comparable units are about 9km thick sediments that mark a rapid period of erosion and 
proximal deposition during the late-stage of an orogenic cycle. 

All of the Birimian sediments and volcanics have been extensively metamorphosed; the most 
widespread metamorphic facies appears to be greenschist, although in many areas, higher 
temperatures and pressures are indicated by amphibolite facies. 

Detailed structural studies in the region are fairly limited.  Studies in the western part of the 
region (Milesi et al., 1992) have proposed several separate phases of folding and fracturing.  
However, a regional synthesis by Eisenlohr (1989) has concluded that, although there is 
considerable heterogeneity in the extent and styles of deformation in many areas, most of the 
structural elements have common features, which are compatible with a single, extended and 
progressive phase of regional deformation involving substantial northwest-southeast 
compression.  According to Feybesse et al. (1994), as well as Ledru et al. (1994), this 
extended period of compression resulted in early stage north-south sinistral (left lateral) faults 
of regional extent and later stage dextral (right lateral) faults oriented approximately northeast-
southwest.  A considerable amount of thrusting with a south-easterly vergence was localized 
along the margins of the major volcanic belts.  This is well displayed on the northwest margin 
of the Ashanti Belt in Ghana. 

Figure 7.1_1 below shows the southwest geology of Ghana highlighting the Keegan projects 
of Esaase and Asumura.

7.2 Project Geology 

The Esaase project area contains a system of gold-bearing quartz veins hosted by tightly 
folded Birimian-age sedimentary rocks.  Geological mapping on the property has been 
completed by a combination of an IP survey and resource definition drilling and associated 
outcrop mapping. 

The rocks of the property can be divided into high resistivity and low resistivity meta-
sedimentary units (Figure 7.2_1).  Within the resource zone, the host rocks can be divided 
between shale and siltstone (hanging wall) and greywacke (footwall).  The shale and 
siltstones are thinly to thickly interbedded grading from massive siltstone through mixed shale 
and siltstone to shale only.  For mapping purposes, Keegan have divided the rocks into four 
categories based on the relative abundance of shale and siltstone. 

 Siltstone = ≤ 20% shale bands or layers 

 Siltstone with shale = 20-50% shale bands or layers 

 Shale with siltstone  = 20-50% siltstone bands or layers 

 Shale  = ≤ 20% siltstone bands or layers

Figure 7.2_1 
Map of Esaase Concession 

IP Resistivity and Alluvial Mining 

 
The Esaase resource area is defined by a distinctive structural boundary that divides the more 
deformed, altered and mineralized siltstone shale unit in the hanging wall from the more 
massively bedded greywacke in the footwall.  All rocks in the siltstone/shale package are 
moderately to strongly folded and foliated with shale generally displaying better development 
of foliation than siltstone. 

Within the shale/siltstone package, closed to tight folds plunge 30 to 60o to the north.  The 
folds are asymmetric with shallowly dipping west limbs and steeply dipping east limbs.  Fold 
limbs and some noses are characterised by zones of higher strain resulting in segmentation of 
more competent units and development of shear fabrics.  Strong transposition is common in 
these zones, which are termed "fold-shear-transposition zones" (FST zones).  The orientation 
of these zones appears to be axial planar, striking north to north-northeast and dipping steeply 
northwest.  In the footwall zone of the deposit, the greywacke shows markedly less 
deformation, and bedding appears to dip uniformly and steeply to the east

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The target deposit being explored for is the mesothermal auriferous sulphide (arsenopyrite 
and pyrite) and quartz vein style mineralisation.  This is by far the most important type of gold 
occurrence in West Africa and is commonly referred to as the Ashanti-type in recognition of 
the Obuasi area being the type locality and the largest gold deposit in the region.  Milesi et al. 
(1992) recognize that these deposits are largely confined to tectonic corridors that are often 
>50km long and up to several kilometres wide and they usually display complex, multi-phase 
structural features, which control the mineralisation. 

The most common host rock is usually fine-grained metasediments, often in close proximity to 
graphitic, siliceous, or manganiferous chemical sediments.  However, in some areas, mafic 
volcanics and belt intrusions are also known to host significant gold occurrences.  Typically, 
these deposits feature early-stage disseminated sulphides in which pyrite and arsenopyrite 
host important amounts of gold.  They also feature extensive late stage quartz veining and 
stockwork systems in which visible gold is quite common and accessory polymetallic 
sulphides are frequently observed.  This type includes most of the important lode/vein 
deposits in Ghana such as at Obuasi, Prestea, Bogosu, Bibiani and Obotan.

9 MINERALIZATION 

Mineralisation at Esaase is associated with a system of gold-bearing quartz veins hosted by 
tightly folded Birimian-age sedimentary rocks.  The veins are synkinematic, forming as sets of 
sub-vertical and horizontal to gently dipping veins.  Most veins are folded about the dominant 
axial plane cleavage. 

The lower grade zones (1 to 5g/t Au) are up to 100m in width and occur in strong quartz -
sericite - iron carbonate - sulphide altered metasediments.  The overall trend of these bodies 
is northeast with a moderate dip to the west.  The higher grade quartz veins which are 
currently the focus of artisanal mining in the area (5 to 127g/t Au), trend north and have dips 
that vary from vertical to sub-horizontal. 

Figure 9_1 shows lower grade disseminated mineralization displaying bleached to rust-red 
quartz-kaolinite-iron oxide weathered metasediments with higher grade sheeted vein 
mineralization.  Grades shown in Figure 9_1 are composited over 5m intervals. 

 
Figure 9_1 

Trench 9700B 

 
Figure 9_2 shows higher grade quartz vein hosted mineralization within altered wall rock.  The 
sheeted quartz veins strike ~350º and dip ~75 º west

10 EXPLORATION 

There had been no modern day hard rock exploration completed on the Esaase project prior 
to the commencement of exploration by Keegan in mid 2006. 

10.1 Soil Sampling Program 

Keegan commenced a soil sampling program immediately upon acquisition of the Esaase 
Concession in June 2006.  This program extended the initial soil sampling completed in March 
2006 as part of initial due diligence on the concession.  To date Keegan has received gold 
analytical results for over 4,000 samples on the property.  Figure 10.1_1 shows the gold-in-
soil contour map derived from these samples.  The contours parallel the large resistivity 
breaks defined by the IP survey.  The resource area currently overlies only a small portion of 
the soil anomalies associated with a greater than 50ppb response. 

 
Figure 10.1_1 

Gold in Soil Contour Map 

 

10.2 Induced Polarization (IP) Program 

An IP program was completed in 2006.  Keegan processed data for 72 line-kilometres of 
surveying on 23 lines.  The significant results of the IP have been previously discussed in the 
geology sections and are shown in Figure 7.2_1.

10.3 Introduction 

Drilling at the Esaase Gold Project has been managed by Keegan and Coffey Mining 
geologists.  Surface Reverse Circulation ('RC') and Diamond Core ('DC') drilling have been 
completed at the project.  The ongoing drill program is designed to test the mineralised 
corridor delineated from soil sampling, trenching, drilling and geophysical interpretations.  The 
initial 14 diamond drillholes were completed by Eagle drilling contractors with the remainder 
completed by Geodrill contractors.  Both of these drilling companies are reputable Ghana 
based companies providing RC and Diamond drilling services consistent with current industry 
standard.  Table 10.3_1 summarises pertinent drilling statistics for all holes drilled on the 
Esaase concession at the time of commencement of the resource estimate study.  A total of 
198 drillholes have been completed of which 151 of these drillholes (in the currently defined 
resource area) were used for the resource estimation study.

10.4 Drilling Procedures 

10.4.1 Accuracy of Drillhole Collar Locations 

Drillhole collars were surveyed by an Coffey Mining surveyor utilising a Thales Promark 3 
DGPS unit.  This unit was validated as returning sub centimetre accuracy when compared to 
the topography pickup completed by Coffey Mining using a Geodimeter 610S total station.  
These instruments have an accuracy of greater than 1cm and are considered conventional. 

10.4.2 Downhole Surveying Procedures 

Drillholes were surveyed on approximately 50m downhole intervals, using a Reflex EZ-Shot®, 
an electronic single shot instrument manufactured by Reflex of Sweden. 

These measurements have been converted from magnetic to UTM Zone 30North values.  The 
factor used to convert between the two grids is -5 degrees. 

10.4.3 Reverse Circulation Drilling Procedures 

Keegan supervised RC and diamond drilling was completed by Geodrill using a UDR KL900-02 
multipurpose track mounted rig.  RC rods were 4½ inch diameter and the drill bit used was a 
standard 5½ inch diameter.

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

10.5 Diamond Drilling Procedures 

The initial 14 diamond drillholes (HQ and NQ) were completed by Eagle Drilling using a 
Longyear 38 skid mounted diamond drill.  The Geodrill rig utilised in the RC drilling is 
multipurpose and completed the remaining diamond component of drilling also.  The core was 
oriented by a combination of the spear technique and the Ezimark orientation device. 

10.6 RC and Core Sampling Procedures 

The sampling procedures followed during RC and DC drilling are detailed in Section 12, as is 
the sample quality assessment. 

10.7 Summary Results 

It is not practical to include a listing of all sample results, as a total of 37,267 RC samples and 
diamond core samples have been collected to date.  Table 11.7_1 summarises pertinent 
statistics relating to the RC and core sampling program.

11 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

11.1 RC Sampling and Logging 

RC drill chips were collected as 1m intervals downhole via a cyclone into PVC bags, and then 
weighed prior to splitting. 

The collected samples were riffle split using a three tier Jones riffle splitter.  A final sample of 
approximately 2kg was collected for submission to the laboratory for analysis.  Keegan 
analysed all 1m samples. 

RC chip trays were systematically compiled and logged with all bulk rejects being stored at 
the Keegan exploration camp in Esaase. 

11.2 Diamond Core Sampling and Logging 

The sampling of the core was subject to the discretion of the geologist completing the 
geological logging.  Initially, nominally 2m intervals were taken unless geological features 
were identified requiring smaller intervals.  After December 2006, nominally 1m intervals were 
taken.  26.4% of diamond core sampling was submitted as whole core.  The remaining 73.6% 
was submitted and half core.  After the marking out of the required interval, the core was 
generally cut in half by the electric diamond blade core saw.  The cut is made 1cm to the right 
(looking downhole) of the orientation line with the left side being retained and the other half 
broken up for assay. 

In the upper oxide zone, where the core was too friable for diamond saw cutting, the 
procedure was to dry cut or cleave the core. 

Core structure orientations were routinely recorded to assist in determining the controls on 
mineralisation, in establishing a reliable geological model for resource estimation, and to 
provide additional geotechnical information to determine likely blast fragmentation and pit 
stability characteristics. 

The core is transferred from the trays and pieced together on a V-rail (angle iron) rack and the 
orientation line (bottom of hole), determined by the orientation tool recorded during drilling, is 
drawn along the entire length of the assembled core. 

Geotechnical logging has recorded percentage core recovery, RQD percentage, rock type, 
weathering, rock strength and fractures per metre.  This basic geotechnical logging is 
considered appropriate at this stage of project development. 

11.3 Sample Recovery 

Sample recovery for RC drilling was noted as very good and averages approximately 30kg 
per metre drilled.  Bulk sample weights have been systematically recorded for each metre 
drilled. 



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  25 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

Sample recovery in Diamond holes was very good although recoveries for core from the 
moderate to highly weathered saprolite and highly fractured and brecciated zones returned 
poor recoveries.  Keegan utilised HQ3 drilling to minimise the core loss in the weathered 
zones. 

11.4 Sample Quality 

The sampling procedures adopted for drilling are consistent with current industry best 
practise.  Samples collected by diamond coring within the highly weathered zones are of 
moderate quality, with the remainder being high.  Sample recoveries and quality for the RC 
drilling are high with drilling switching to diamond core once wet samples were noticed. 

Twinning of the DC drilling and RC drilling has not been completed by Keegan at this stage 
and it is difficult to determine if any negative bias has resulted in the DC drilling due to the use 
of water.  A number of the DC holes had poor recovery in the highly weathered zone and 
there exists potential to wash the fine gold associated with the fractures and veining and 
therefore underestimate the gold content. 

RC field duplicate samples are routinely collected to allow assessment of the field sampling 
error (or bias) once the laboratory error, determined from analysis of pulp duplicates, has 
been subtracted.  Acceptable reproducibility has been identified during an assessment of RC 
field duplicate data (Section 14.2) generated and no distinct bias is evident.

12 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

12.1 Sample Security 

The close scrutiny of sample submission procedures by Keegan technical staff, and the rapid 
submission of samples from drilling for analysis, provides little opportunity for sample 
tampering.  Equally, given the umpire assaying via an external international laboratory and the 
regular 'blind' submission of international standards to both the primary and umpire assay 
facilities, any misleading analytical data would be readily recognised and investigated. 

Current Keegan sampling procedures require samples to be collected in staple closed bags 
once taken from the rig.  They are then transported to the Esaase camp to be picked up by 
the laboratory truck.  The laboratory truck then takes them to the laboratory directly. 

Reference material is retained and stored at the Keegan exploration camp at Esaase, as well 
as chips derived from RC drilling, half-core and photographs generated by Diamond drilling, 
and duplicate pulps and residues of all submitted samples.  Assessment of the data indicates 
that the assay results are generally consistent with the logged alteration and mineralisation, 
and are entirely consistent with the anticipated tenor of mineralisation. 

12.2 Analytical Laboratories 

Preparation and assaying of samples from the Esaase deposit has been carried out at two 
independent laboratories:- 

 SGS Tarkwa (SGS) (from April 2007). 

 Transworld Tarkwa (TWL) (from October 2006). 

12.3 Sample Preparation and Analytical Procedure 

12.3.1 Transworld Tarkwa 

The assay method applied by TWL Tarkwa for the Esaase drilling is summarised below.  All 
aspects of sample preparation and analysis were undertaken at TWL Tarkwa. 

 Sample Preparation 

 3kg or less of sample is dried, disaggregated, and jaw crushed to 3mm. 

 Sample is pulverised to a nominal 95% passing -75 micron using an LM2 pulveriser. 

 Two pulp samples are taken for analysis and pulp storage. 

 Sample Analysis 

 50g charge, Fire Assay fusion, lead collection, AAS determination to 0.1ppm.

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

12.3.2 SGS Tarkwa 

The methodology for the 50g fire assay from the SGS Tarkwa laboratory, is the same as that 
completed at TWL. 

12.4 Adequacy of Procedures 

Analytical procedures associated with data generated to date are consistent with current 
industry practise and are considered acceptable for the style of mineralisation identified at 
Esaase.  Quality control procedures are described in the next section.

13 DATA VERIFICATION 

13.1 Quality Control Procedures 

The quality control procedures adopted by the Keegan and the relevant analytical laboratories 
are listed in point form below. 

13.1.1 Keegan 

Keegan has undertaken the procedures recommended by Coffey Mining from January 2007, 
and include:- 

 Insertion of 9 (Geostats Standards and CDN Resource Standards) internationally 
certified standard reference material (5% of samples). 

 Insertion of Blank material (5% of samples). 

 RC Field duplicates taken (5% of samples). 

 Diamond Core Field duplicates completed by a second split at the 3mm jaw crushing 
stage. 

 Submission of selected Umpire samples to SGS. 

 Review of the Keegan and the internal laboratory QC data on a batch by batch basis. 

The assay quality control procedures applying to the various laboratories is summarised in the 
following sections. 

13.1.2 SGS Tarkwa 

The following quality control procedures are adopted by SGS which is part of the global group 
of SGS laboratories with ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation:- 

 Cross referencing of sample identifiers (sample tags) during sample sorting and 
preparation with sample sheets and client submission sheet. 

 Compressed air gun used to clean crushing and milling equipment between samples. 

 Barren quartz 'wash' applied to the milling/pulverising equipment at the rate of 1:10. 

 Quartz washes assayed to determine the level of cross contamination. 

 Sieve tests are carried out on pulps at the rate of 1:50 to ensure adequate size reduction. 

 Assaying of certified standards at the rate of one per batch of 20. 

 A minimum of 5% (1:20) of the submitted samples in each batch are subject to repeat 
analysis. 

 Blank samples are inserted at the rate of approximately 1:30. 

 Industry recognised certified standards are disguised and inserted at a rate of 1:30. 



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  29 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

 Assaying of internal standards data. 

 Participation in two international round robin programs; LQSi of USA and Geostats of 
Australia. 

13.1.3 Transworld Tarkwa 

TWL applies most of the QC procedures used by SGS although it only participates in the 
Geostats round robin umpire assay program and it does not utilise the CCLAS computer 
system. 

13.2 Quality Control Analysis 

The quality control data analysed by Coffey Mining includes:- 

 Standard and blanks (both Field and Laboratory). 

 RC Field duplicates. 

 Laboratory repeats. 

 Re-assayed pulps. 

 Umpire assaying. 

The assay quality control data, as they pertain to resource estimates completed on the basis 
of data available, have been subset into the categories above, and reviewed separately. 

The quality control data has been assessed statistically using a number of comparative 
analyses for available datasets.  The objectives of these analyses were to determine relative 
precision and accuracy levels between various sets of assay pairs and the quantum of relative 
error.  The results of the statistical analyses are presented as summary plots, which include 
the following:- 

 Thompson and Howarth Plot showing the mean relative percentage error of grouped 
assay pairs across the entire grade range, used to visualise precision levels by 
comparing against given control lines. 

 Rank % HARD Plot, which ranks all assay pairs in terms of precision levels measured as 
half of the absolute relative difference from the mean of the assay pairs (% HARD), used 
to visualise relative precision levels and to determine the percentage of the assay pairs 
population occurring at a certain precision level. 

 Mean v's % HARD Plot, used as another way of illustrating relative precision levels by 
showing the range of % HARD over the grade range. 

 Mean vs %HRD Plot is similar to the above, but the sign is retained, thus allowing 
negative or positive differences to be computed.  This plot gives an overall impression of 
precision and also shows whether or not there is significant bias between the assay pairs 
by illustrating the mean percent half relative difference between the assay pairs (mean % 
HRD).

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  30 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

 Correlation Plot is a simple plot of the value of assay 1 against assay 2.  This plot allows 
an overall visualisation of precision and bias over selected grade ranges.  Correlation 
coefficients are also used. 

 Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot is a means where the marginal distributions of two datasets 
can be compared.  Similar distributions should be noted if the data is unbiased. 

Comments on the results of the statistical analyses for each laboratory are provided below 
while a compilation of the descriptive statistics and graphical plots are presented as 
illustrations in Appendix 1. 

13.2.1 Transworld Laboratory, Tarkwa 

TWL Duplicate Repeats 

At TWL, every 20th sample is duplicated.  A duplicate is two separate samples taken from the 
total pulped sample.  Duplicate repeats are analysed in the same batch and are therefore not 
subject to intra-batch variance.  Only assays greater than 10 times the detection level 
(>=0.1ppm Au) are included in the assessment and data are divided into drillcore (HQ and 
NQ, 118 assays) and riffle split 1m RC drill chips (246 assays).  Results show equivalent 
means between the duplicate repeats and precision within acceptable limits for both diamond 
core and RC samples. 

TWL Pulp Respray 

After initial calibration of the AAS with control standards, the batch is sprayed (the aspirator 
tube is placed in the DIBK layer and approximately 1ml is sprayed into the AAS flame).  On 
combustion, the absorbance is measured by the AAS and the strength of the absorbance is 
proportional to the gold concentration).  At the end of spraying, the operator returns to every 
10th samples and performs the same operation and this is the Pulp Respray.  At the end, 
control samples are again presented to the AAS to verify that short term drift has not 
occurred.  Only assays greater than 10 times the detection level (>=0.1ppm Au) are included 
in the assessment and data are divided into drillcore (HQ and NQ, 154 assays) and riffle split 
1m RC drill chips (553 assays).  Results show equivalent means between the duplicate 
repeats and precision well within acceptable limits for both diamond core and RC samples. 

TWL Check Repeats 

Check repeats occur where high grade samples are encountered or where the result is out of 
sequence (eg 0.01-0.04-0.02-1.2-0.03: Result 1.2 is out of sequence and would be repeated).  
A repeat is a second 50g sample taken from the same kraft envelope as the original analysis 
(Au1) and is thus different from the duplicate repeat.  Check Repeats are analysed later than 
the original assay (in a different batch) and may therefore be subject to intra-batch variance 
compared with the original result.  Only assays greater than 10 times the detection level 
(>=0.1ppm Au) are included in the assessment and data are divided into drillcore (HQ and 
NQ, 265 assays) and riffle split 1m RC drill chips (573 assays).  Results show equivalent 
means between the duplicate repeats and precision within acceptable limits for both diamond 
core and RC samples

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

TWL Pulp Reassay 

Only pulp reassays greater than or equal to 10 times the detection level (0.1ppm Au) are 
considered for analysis and these comprise 568 riffle split 1m RC drill chip assays.  Results 
show a slightly lower mean for the reassays and acceptable precision. 

TWL Lab Standards and Blanks Analysis 

Six certified standards were inserted by TWL into the sample batches at a rate of one in 
twenty in addition to preparation blanks and reagent blanks at a similar rate.  A total of 
3,512 standards and blanks assays are available for analysis.  Results generally show a 
positive bias of between -0.44% to 3.05%.  This positive bias is more evident for higher grade 
standards. 

13.2.2 SGS Laboratory, Tarkwa 

SGS Duplicate Second Split 

This comprises RC and diamond core field duplicates and is achieved by taking a second split 
at the 3mm jaw crushing stage of the sample preparation.  Results show equivalent means 
and a high level of precision between the original and the reassay. 

SGS Replicate First Split 

These assays represent a random repeat assay with four random repeats completed from 
each batch of 50 samples.  Results show equivalent means and an acceptable level of 
precision between the original and the reassay. 

Lab Standards and Blanks Analysis 

Four certified standards were inserted by SGS into the sample batches at a rate of one in 
twenty in addition to preparation blanks and reagent blanks at a similar rate.  A total of 
938 standards and blanks assays are available for analysis.  Results show a relative low bias 
of up to -2.09%. 

13.2.3 Keegan QAQC 

Keegan Field Standards and Blanks 

A total of 10 Certified Standards and one blank have been included in sample batches sent to 
TWL and SGS.  A total of 2,963 assays were available for analysis.  Results and show a 
significant positive bias of up to 7.19% for Transworld Laboratories.  This positive bias is more 
evident at higher grades.  Blind standards analysis at SGS shows a significant negative bias 
of up to -10.67% however is generally around 3% to 4%.  Again, the worst result is shown by 
the highest grade standard.

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

Keegan Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates totalling 932 and 1,270 have been sent to TWL and SGS respectively.  Only 
assays returning values greater than ten times the detection limits (>0.1ppm Au) have been 
considered in the analysis.  Results show equivalent means for both drillcore and RC chips 
and acceptable levels of precision for the type of duplicate. 

Keegan Assay Resplits (Umpire) 

In January and February 2007 a total of 1,197 RC samples were re-split and sent for analysis 
at SGS Tarkwa (TWL was the primary laboratory for the initial analysis).  Only assays 
>0.1g/t Au are considered in the analysis and a total of 481 assay pairs are available for 
analysis.  Results show a significantly lower mean (by 15.6%) for analysis completed at SGS. 

13.3 QAQC Conclusions 

Coffey Mining believes that the current QAQC systems in place at Esaase to monitor the 
precision and accuracy of the sampling and assaying are adequate with the exception that a 
program of umpire assaying should be initiated.  Pertinent conclusions from the analysis of 
the available QAQC data include:- 

 Use of Certified Standard Reference material has shown a significant relative low bias for 
SGS Laboratories, Tarkwa. 

 Use of Certified Standard Reference material has shown a significant relative high bias 
for Transworld Laboratories, Tarkwa. 

 Repeat analyses have confirmed that the precision of sampling and assaying is within 
acceptable limits for sampling of gold deposits. 

13.4 Bulk Density Determinations 

A total of 3550 bulk density determinations have been collected for the Esaase deposit by 
Coffey Mining.  The readings were taken over a range of lithological and weathered profiles by 
Coffey Mining technicians.  The procedure used is detailed below and works on the 
Archimedies Principle.  A custom set of "Bulk Density" scales with a weighing hook located 
underneath (purchased from Corstor South Africa) was utilised for the measurements:- 

 10cm billet of clean dry (dried in an oven for 4 hours at 60oC) core is weighed. 

 Core is immersed in paraffin wax then reweighed to establish weight of the wax. 

 Core is then suspended and weighed in water to determine the volume. 

The Bulk Density is then calculated as Bulk Density core = [Mass core] / [(Mass air – Mass 
water) – (Mass wax / 0.9)]. 

A statistical analysis of the results is presented in Section 17.4.

13.5 Survey Control 

13.5.1 Topography 

Topography has been generated from a Total Station survey completed by Coffey Mining 
surveyors in 2007.  This topography is to an accuracy of +/-30cm and compares well with the 
drillhole collar survey data.  Coffey Mining considers the topography to be of high confidence. 

13.6 Data Quality Summary 

On the basis of the Coffey Mining involvement in consulting to Keegan since January 2007, 
the appropriateness of the exploration procedures relating to resource delineation can be 
summarised as follows:- 

 Diamond and RC drilling have been undertaken by reputable contract drilling companies 
using industry standard drilling equipment and procedures. 

 Survey control is accomplished by surveying of drillhole collars using high accuracy 
surveying equipment.  Drillhole locations are well established in relation to the UTM grid. 

 Drillhole sampling procedures are consistent with acceptable industry standards. 

 Assaying procedures are considered consistent with acceptable industry standards. 

 QAQC procedures are adequate, although further analysis of the high bias noted in the 
TWL assay data and the low bias noted in the SGS assay data is required. 

 Bulk density stratification based on Diamond core data is considered acceptable for 
resource calculation. 

 The umpire sampling program needs to be undertaken on a regular basis. 

 Drillhole twinning of DC and RC needs to be undertaken to determine if a bias exists. 

13.7 Source Data 

Keegan has maintained all digital and hard copy data for the Esaase Gold Project.  In 
summary, the following key digital data relevant to the resource estimation study are 
available:- 

 Drillhole databases containing collar location data, downhole survey data, assay data, 
and geology data. 

 Internal documentation including geological logging tables. 

 Density databases. 

 In addition, reference data and support documentation relevant to the resource 
estimation study are available as are internal company reports.

15 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Preliminary metallurgical testwork was conducted on behalf of Keegan by Coffey Mining in 
July 2007, to determine potential amenability of oxide, transition and fresh ore zones to heap 
leach and / or CIL processing routes.  Testwork was completed at the IML laboratory in Perth, 
Western Australia.  All three ore zones displayed amenability to conventional gold recovery 
via cyanidation with reasonable gold recoveries and reagent consumptions at both 'as 
received' RC chip sizing and after grinding to typical CIL size ranges. 

Mineralogical examination of the three ore zones indicated the presence of coarse gold in the 
transitional and fresh samples.  This gold was generally fine at around 10µm and occluded in 
pyrite, with the exception of the fresh sample which contained larger, free gold grains up to 
300µm in size.  Sulphide was predominately pyrite and minor arsenopyrite. 

The 'as received' bottle roll tests conducted at approximately 1mm were used to indicate the 
likely amenability to heap leaching.  The oxide material produced a recovery of 85.8% with a 
residue of 0.18g/t which is within the range of heap leach viable ores.  The RC chip sample 
had a P80 sizing of 478µm which is considerably finer than would be achieved in a full scale 
crushing operation and requires follow up bottle roll and column testwork at coarser size 
fractions to confirm gold recovery and percolation rate information. 

The fresh and transitional zones produced recoveries of 66.8% and 65.3% respectively, with 
considerably higher residues ranging from 0.60g/t – 0.74g/t.  These samples, although 
potentially heap leachable, were also considerably finer (P80 sizing of ~1mm) than would be 
achieved in a full scale crushing plant, and hence gold recoveries at coarser size fractions 
need to be investigated further.  A summary of the 'heap leach' bottle roll tests are shown 
below.  Both the transition and fresh samples were also of a relatively high gold grade, which 
can bias the 'percentage' gold recoveries.  At a lower head grade, with the same residue 
value (as would be expected), the 'percentage' recovery would be significantly lower.

The cyanidation testwork carried out at differing grinds was used to estimate the likely 
performance of a conventional CIL process route, including grind sensitivity, indicative gold 
recovery and reagent consumptions for each ore zone.  In all three cases, maximum 
recoveries were achieved at 75µm, however the oxide material showed little difference in 
recovery and residue grades below 300µm.  The grind dependent nature of the fresh and 
transitional ores corresponds with the mineralogical data, in that the fine gold occluded in 
sulphide grains is liberated at finer grind sizes.  Residue analysis indicated that a large portion 
of the non-leached gold resided in the -45µm fraction.  A summary of the results for the P80 
grind size at 75µm is given below.

16 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

16.1 Introduction 

Coffey Mining has estimated the Mineral Resource for the Esaase Gold Project as at 
19th of October 2007.  All grade estimation was completed using Multiple Indicator Kriging 
('MIK') for gold.  This estimation approach was considered appropriate based on review of a 
number of factors, including the quantity and spacing of available data, the interpreted 
controls on mineralisation, and the style of mineralisation.  The estimation was constrained 
with geological and mineralisation interpretations. 

16.2 Database Validation 

The resource estimation was based on the available exploration drillhole database which was 
compiled by Coffey Mining in MS Access.  The database has been reviewed and validated by 
Coffey Mining prior to commencing the resource estimation study. 

Data included samples from extensive trenching, but only the RC and diamond drilling sample 
data were included for use in the modelling process. 

The database was validated in Micromine software and the checks made to the database 
prior to loading into Vulcan included:- 

 No overlapping intervals. 

 Downhole surveys at 0 depth. 

 Consistency of depths between different data tables. 

 Check gaps in the data. 

A total number of 145 samples from 6 sample batches were destroyed during a fire at the 
SGS laboratory in Tarkwa.  These samples have been replaced by -999 in the database.  
Other changes that were made to the database prior to loading into Vulcan included:- 

 Replacing less than detection samples with half detection. 

 Replacing intervals with no sample with -999. 

 Replacing intervals with assays not yet received with -999. 

The resource dataset has been described in Section 11.  In summary, samples were 
composited to 3m down-hole lengths with residual intervals less than 3m length being 
retained and all composites being length weighted to minimise data loss.  The resulting file 
contained 10,883 composites with gold grades.  A total of 151 RC and diamond drillholes 
were used in the resource modelling study.

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

16.3 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 

Based on grade information and geological observations, oxidation and mineralised domain 
boundaries have been interpreted and wireframes modelled to constrain resource estimation 
for the Esaase deposit. 

Interpretation and digitising of all constraining boundaries has been undertaken on cross 
sections orientated at 100º (drill line orientation).  The resultant digitised boundaries have 
been used to construct wireframe surfaces or solids defining the three-dimensional geometry 
of each interpreted feature.  The interpretation and wireframe models have been developed 
using the Vulcan mine planning software package. 

16.3.1 Mineralisation Interpretation 

For the purpose of resource estimation, two mineralised domains were interpreted and were 
modelled on a lower cut-off grade of 0.4g/t Au.  The domains are listed below and depicted in 
Figure 16.3.1_1 and Figure 16.3.1_2. 

 Footwall Domain:  Designated Zone 1.  A moderately to steeply dipping zone hosting the 
bulk of the mineralisation and entirely contained within the sedimentary sequence.  This 
domain dips more steeply towards the north and is depicted in Figure 16.3.1_1 on the 
right. 

 Hangingwall Domain:  Designated Zone 2.  A parallel to sub-parallel zone of 
mineralisation, structurally higher than the footwall domain and depicted on the left in 
Figure 16.3.1_1.

16.3.2 Weathering Interpretation 

Composites were also coded by the weathering profile.  The profile has been modelled from 
drill data and comprises of strongly weathered saprolite, moderately weathered saprock, 
transition material and fresh units.  In general weathering surface broadly parallel the 
topographical profile although weathering tends to be deeper within zones of mineralisation 
and tends to parallel the footwall to the mineralisation where the footwall approaches the 
surface.  On some sections the intermixing of the weathering types can be quite complicated.  
All of the weathering surfaces have been utilised in terms of dividing the gold mineralisation 
into secondary domaining for statistical analysis and incorporated into the resource model for 
the purposes of assigning tonnage factors.  Figure 16.3.2_1 is an example section 
(at 9,840mN, local grid) showing the distribution of weathering types and the interpreted 
position of the top of fresh rock.

16.4 Statistical Analysis 

The lengths of the samples were statistically assessed prior to selecting an appropriate 
composite length for undertaking statistical analyses, variography and grade estimation.  
Summary statistics of the sample length indicates that 87.6% of the samples were collected at 
1m intervals, 10.2% was collected at 2m intervals and the remainder (2.2%) was sampled at 
irregular intervals less than 2m.  Statistical analysis was undertaken based on 3m composites 
of the gold assay data for the resource dataset drilling completed at Esaase.  All composites 
inside and outside the wireframes were flagged as separate domains.  A total of 
10,833 composites were used in the modelling process from a total of 151RC and diamond 
drillholes. 

Summary statistics were generated to compare assayed RC samples and drillcore samples.  
Only assays greater than 0.3g/t Au were considered.  These are presented in Table 16.4_1.  
The means of two types of sampling are similar with the medians being equivalent.  
Differences may be explained by the effect of high grade outliers. 

Separate statistics were generated for each domain.  The data was further subdivided, and 
flagged, into sub-domains based on weathering profile.  Summary statistics for each modelled 
domain are presented in Table 16.4_2.

Figure 16.4_1 to 16.4_2 shows log histograms and probability plots of gold grades for Zones 1 
and 2.  Populations of gold grades are close to lognormal and show strong positive skewness 
for both domains and this is typical of many gold deposits.  The coefficient of variation ('CV') 
of Zones 1 and 2 are moderately high indicating that it may be difficult to maintain a high 
degree of selectivity in mining. 

Conditional statistics for data within each domain to be estimated by Multiple Indicator Kriging 
are listed in Table 16.4_3. 

Bulk density determinations were coded by weathering interpretation in the database and 
density values for the weathering subdivisions were subsequently extracted from the 
database.  Summary statistics are presented in Table 16.4_4 below.

16.5 Variography 

16.5.1 Introduction 

Variography is used to describe the spatial variability or correlation of an attribute (gold, silver 
etc).  The spatial variability is traditionally measured by means of a variogram, which is 
generated by determining the averaged squared difference of data points at a nominated 
distance (h), or lag (Srivastava and Isaacs, 1989).  The averaged squared difference 
(variogram or γ(h)) for each lag distance is plotted on a bivariate plot, where the X-axis is the 
lag distance and the Y-axis represents the average squared differences (γ(h)) for the 
nominated lag distance.

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  47 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

Several types of variogram calculations are employed to determine the directions of the 
continuity of the mineralisation:- 

Traditional variograms are calculated from the raw assay values. 

Log-transformed variography involves a logarithmic transformation of the assay data. 

 Gaussian variograms are based on the results after declustering and a transformation to 
a Normal distribution. 

 Pairwise-relative variograms attempt to 'normalise' the variogram by dividing the 
variogram value for each pair by their squared mean value. 

 Correlograms are 'standardized' by the variance calculated from the sample values that 
contribute to each lag. 

Fan variography involves the graphical representation of spatial trends by calculating a range 
of variograms in a selected plane and contouring the variogram values.  The result is a 
contour map of the grade continuity within the domain. 

The variography was calculated and modelled in the geostatistical software, Isatis.  The 
rotations are tabulated as input into Isatis (geological convention), with X representing rotation 
around Z axis, Y representing rotation around Y` axis and Z representing rotation around X``.  
Dip and dip direction of major, semi-major and minor axes of continuity are also referred to in 
the text.  Modelled correlograms were generally shown to have good structure and were used 
throughout. 

16.6 Esaase Deposit Variography 

Grade and indicator variography was generated to enable grade estimation via MIK and 
change of support analysis to be completed.  In addition, Gaussian variograms were also 
investigated.  Seven indicator thresholds (Table 16.6_2) were investigated for each domain.  
Interpreted anisotropy directions correspond well with the modelled geology and overall 
geometry of the interpreted Domains. 

16.6.1 Zone 1 

Grade variography shows good structure and displays moderate anisotropy between the major 
and semi-major axes.  Two spherical models have been fitted to the experimental correlogram, 
with the correlogram exhibiting a high relative nugget effect (calculated by dividing the nugget 
variance by the sill variance) of 45%.  The short-range structure, which has been modelled with 
ranges of 20m, 15m and 3m for the major, semi-major and minor axis respectively, accounts for 
half of the non-nugget variance.  The overall ranges fitted to the Zone 1 correlogram are 75m, 
40m and 9m for the major, semi-major, and minor axis respectively. 

The interpreted major direction of continuity dips at 15º towards 036º50'.  The modelled grade 
variogram plot is provided in Figure 16.6.1_1.

Modelled indicator correlograms display a range of relative nugget values from 35% to 65% 
and this is broadly comparable with the grade variogram nugget of 45%.  Table 16.6.1_1 
presents the fitted grade and indicator variogram models for Zone 1. 

16.6.2 Zone 2 

Grade variography shows good structure and displays moderate anisotropy between the 
major and semi-major axes.  One spherical model has been fitted to the experimental 
correlogram, with the correlogram exhibiting a moderate to high relative nugget effect of 50%.  
The spherical model has been fitted with minor ranges of 12m, 8m and 4m.  A second 
exponential model has been fitted with overall ranges of 90m, 50m and 25m for the major, 
semi-major and minor axis respectively.  The short range structure accounts for slightly more 
than half of the non nugget variance. 

The interpreted major direction of continuity dips at 13º towards 34º25'.  Table 16.6.2_1 
presents the fitted grade variogram and indicator variogram models for Zone 2 while the grade 
variogram plot is provided in Figure 16.6.2_1.

16.7 Block Modelling 

16.7.1 Introduction 

A three-dimensional block model was constructed for the Esaase deposit, covering all the 
interpreted mineralisation zones and including suitable additional waste material to allow later 
pit optimisation studies. 

16.7.2 Block Construction Parameters 

A sub-block model was used to construct the Esaase mineralisation and background models 
(Table 16.7.2_1).  Block coding was completed on the basis of the block centroid, wherein a 
centroid falling within any wireframe was coded with the wireframe solid attribute.  The block 
model was rotated to 045º to adequately represent the overall strike direction of 
mineralisation.

Elevation -250 500 750 5/1 

 
The parent block size was selected on the basis of the average drill spacing (40 - 80m section 
spacing) and the variogram models, which indicate estimation of blocks smaller than the data 
spacing is not practical.  A parent block size of 10mE x 40mN x 5mRL was selected as 
appropriate.  Sub-blocking to a 2.5mE x 2.5mN x 1mRL size was completed to ensure 
adequate volume representation. 

The attributes coded into the block models included the weathering and mineralisation 
models.  A visual review of the wireframe solids and the block model indicates robust flagging 
of the block model. 

Bulk density has been coded to the block model based on the weathering profile.  The 
average bulk density for each subdivision, as presented in Table 16.7.2_2, was coded via a 
block model script.  A description of the density measurement methodology can be found in 
Section 14.4.

16.8 Grade Estimation 

16.8.1 Introduction 

Resource estimation for the Esaase mineralisation was completed using MIK within 
Zones 1 and 2.  Ordinary Kriging, Inverse Distance Squared and Nearest Neighbour 
estimates were also completed within these domains to allow comparison with the post 
processed etype mean. 

Grade estimation was carried out using the Vulcan implementation of the GSLIB kriging 
algorithms.  Calculation of selective mining unit estimates was undertaken using the 
Coffey Mining developed scripts.  A description of the MIK estimation methodology is provided 
in Section 16.8.2.

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

16.8.2 The Multiple Indicator Kriging Method 

The MIK technique is implemented by completing a series of Ordinary Kriging ("OK") 
estimates of binary transformed data.  A composite sample, which is equal to or above a 
nominated cutoff or threshold, is assigned a value of 1, with those below the nominated 
indicator threshold being assigned a value of 0.  The indicator estimates, with a range 
between 0 and 1, represent the probability the point will exceed the indicator cutoff grade.  
The probability of the points exceeding a cutoff can also be considered broadly equivalent to 
the proportion of a nominated block that will exceed the nominated cutoff grade. 

The estimation of a complete series of indicator cut-offs allows the reconstitution of the local 
histogram or conditional cumulative distribution function (ccdf) for the estimated point.  Based 
on the ccdf, local or block properties, such as the block mean and proportion (tonnes) above 
or below a nominated cutoff grade can be investigated. 

Post MIK Processing - E-Type Estimates 

The E-type estimate provides an estimate for the grade of the total block or bulk-mining 
scenario.  This is achieved by discretising the calculated ccdf for each block into a nominated 
number of intervals and interpolating between the given points with a selected function 
(e.g.: the linear, power or hyperbolic model) or by applying intra-class mean grades.  The sum 
of all these weighted interpolated points or mean grades enables an average whole block 
grade to be determined. 

The following example shows the determination of an E-Type estimate for a block containing 
three indicator cutoffs. 

The indicator cutoffs and associated probabilities calculated are:- 

Indicator Cutoff Grade Aug/t 
Indicator Probability 

(cumulative) 

minimum grade * 0 0.00 ** 
indicator 1 1 0.40 
indicator 2 2 0.65 
indicator 3 3 0.85 

maximum grade * 4 1.00 ** 
Note : *   Cutoff grades determined by the user. 

**  Indicator probability is assumed at the minimum and maximum cutoff. 
 
The whole block grade can now be determined in this block with the following parameters 
used for the purposes of the interpolation:- 

 Number of discretisation intervals:      4. 

 Linear extrapolation between all points (median grade between nominated cutoffs).

Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

The worked example is then calculated with the following steps:- 

 Interval 1 (0-1g/t Au) median grade x probability/proportion attributed to the interval 
(0.5g/t Au x 0.40 = 0.200). 

 Interval 2 (1 - 2g/t Au) median grade x proportion (1.5g/t Au x 0.25 = 0.375). 

 Interval 3 (2 - 3g/t Au) median grade x proportion (2.5g/t Au x 0.20 = 0.500). 

 Interval 4 (3 - 4g/t Au) median grade x proportion (3.5g/t Au x 0.15 = 0.525). 

 Calculate total grade average all calculated intervals ((0.2+0.375+0.500+0.525)/1) = 
1.60g/t Au. 

It is also possible from this example to calculate the proportion and grade above a nominated 
cutoff (e.g. 2g/t - at sample support or complete selectivity).  The following steps would be 
undertaken to calculate the tonnes and grade at sample selectivity using a 2g/t cutoff:- 

 Interval 3 (2 - 3g/t Au) median grade x proportion (2.5g/t Au x 0.20 = 0.500). 

 Interval 4 (3 - 4g/t Au) median grade x proportion (3.5g/t Au x 0.15 = 0.525). 

 Calculate total grade average all calculated intervals ((0.500+0.525)/0.35) = 2.93g/t Au 
with 0.35% of the block above the cutoff. 

The effect of using a non-linear model to interpolate between cutoffs is to shift the grade 
weighting associated with that cutoff away from the median.  For Esaase, the intra-class 
means based on the cut composite data have been used to reconstitute the ccdf and produce 
block statistics. 

It is noted, however, that the calculation of the E-type estimate and complete selectivity often 
does not allow mine planning to the level of selectivity which is proposed for production.  To 
achieve an estimate which reflects the levels of mining selectivity envisaged, a selective 
mining unit ("SMU") correction is often applied to the calculated ccdf. 

Support Correction (Selective Mining Unit Estimation) 

A range of techniques are known to produce a support correction and therefore allow for 
selective mining unit emulation.  The common features of the support correction are:- 

 Maintenance of the mean grade of the histogram (E-type mean). 

 Adjustment of the histogram variance by a variance adjustment factor (f ). 

The variance adjustment factor, used to reduce the histogram or ccdf variance, can be 
calculated using the variogram model.  The variance adjustment factor is often modified to 
account for the likely grade control approach or 'information effect'.

√ 

In simplest terms, the variance adjustment factor takes into account the known relationship 
derived from the dispersion variance. 

Total variance = variance of samples within blocks + variance between blocks. 

The variance adjustment factor is calculated as the ratio of the variance between the blocks 
and the variance of the samples within the blocks, with a small ratio (e.g. 0.10) indicating a 
large adjustment of the ccdf variance and large ratio (e.g. 0.80) representing a small shift in 
the ccdf. 

Two simple support corrections that are available include the Affine and Indirect Lognormal 
correction, which are both based on the permanence of distribution.  The discrete gaussian 
model is often applied to global change of support studies and has been generated on the 
composite data set as a comparison.  The indirect lognormal correction was applied to the 
Esaase MIK grade estimates. 

Indirect Lognormal Correction 

The indirect lognormal correction can be implemented by adjusting the quantiles (indicator 
cutoffs) of the ccdf with the variance adjustment factor so that the adjusted ccdf represents 
the statistical characteristics of the block volume of interest. 

This is implemented with the following formula:- 

q' = a x qb 
q = quantile of distribution. 

q' = quantile of the variance-reduced distribution. 

where the coefficients a and b, are given by the following formula:- 

 
a =  

 

m CV2 + 1  
 f. CV2 + 1 M  

 

 
b =  

 
 

ln (f. CV2 + 1) 
 

 

ln (CV2 + 1) 
 

m  = mean of distribution. 
f  = variance adjustment factor . 
CV = coefficient of variation. 

 
At the completion of the quantile adjustments, grades and tonnages (probabilities are then 
considered a pseudo tonnage proportion of the blocks) at a nominated cutoff grade can be 
calculated using the methodology described above (E-type).  The indirect lognormal 
correction, as applied to the Esaase deposit, is the best suited of the common adjustments 
applied to MIK to produce selective mining estimates for positively skewed distributions.

16.9 Multiple Indicator Kriging Parameters 

MIK estimates were completed for relevant domains using the indicator correlogram models 
(Section 16.6), and a set of ancillary parameters controlling the source and selection of 
composite data.  The sample search parameters were defined based on the variography and 
the data spacing, and a series of sample search tests performed in Isatis geostatistical 
software.  A total of 16 indicator thresholds were estimated for Zones 1 and 2 (see 
Tables 16.6.1_1 and 16.6.2_1). 

The sample search parameters are provided in Table 16.9_1.  Soft boundaries were used in 
the estimation pass 1 which, for example, allows samples lying within Zone 1 to be used for 
the estimation of Zone 2.  For successive estimation passes, hard boundaries were which 
does not allow samples lying within Zone 1 to be used for the estimation of Zone 2. This 
strategy allows adequate estimation in areas where the 2 estimation domains are adjacent to 
each other.  A three-pass estimation strategy was applied to each domain, applying 
progressively expanded and less restrictive sample searches to successive estimation 
passes, and only considering blocks not previously assigned an estimate.  In addition, each 
estimation domain was divided into north and south portions to allow for a change in dip in the 
domain.

All relevant statistical information was recorded to enable validation and review of the MIK 
estimates.  The recorded information included:- 

 Number of samples used per block estimate. 

 Average distance to samples per block estimate. 

 Estimation flag to determine in which estimation pass a block was estimated. 

 Number of drillholes from which composite data were used to complete the block 
estimate.

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  56 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

The MIK estimates were reviewed visually and statistically prior to being accepted.  The 
review included the following activities:- 

 Comparison of the E-type estimate versus the mean of the composite dataset, including 
weighting where appropriate to account for data clustering. 

 Visual checks of cross sections, long sections, and plans. 

Alternative estimates were also completed to test the sensitivity of the reported model to the 
selected MIK interpolation parameters.  An insignificant amount of variation in overall grade 
was noted in the alternate estimations. 

Applying the modelled variography, variance adjustment factors were calculated to emulate a 
5mE x 16mN x 2.5mRL selective mining unit ("SMU") via the indirect lognormal change of 
support.  The intra-class composite mean grades (Table 16.4_2) were used in calculating the 
whole block and SMU grades.  The change of support study also included the calculation of 
the theoretical global change of support via the discrete Gaussian change of support model. 

An 'information effect' factor is commonly applied to the originally derived panel-to-block 
variance ratios to determine the final variance adjustment ratio.  The goal of incorporating 
information effect is to calculate results taking into account that mining takes place based on 
grade control information.  There will still be a quantifiable error associated with this data and 
it is this error we want to incorporate.  This is achieved in practice by running a test kriging 
estimation of an SMU using grade control data (the results required to incorporate this option 
in the change of support do not depend on the assay data so the grade control data can be 
hypothetical).  The incorporation of the information effect is commonly found to be negligible, 
however can have a significant effect in some cases.  In this case, the information effect factor 
has not been applied. 

The variance adjustment ratios are provided in Table 16.9_2.

19 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Drilling and studies completed to date have defined an Inferred and Indicated Mineral 
resource at Esaase.  The data collected is considered to be of moderately high quality and 
suitable for resource estimation. 

Further scope exists to improve the geological and resource estimation confidence in the 
regions currently defined as an Inferred Resource along with extensional drilling along the 
general corridor of defined mineralisation. 

It is recommended that:- 

 Further checks are completed of the bias identified in the TWL and SGS data and ensure 
that if a bias is identified in future results, it is identified and re-assayed if required. 

 Additional bulk density data is collected.  This data should include a determination of the 
moisture content. 

 Twinning of diamond holes using RC should be completed to enable a comparative 
analysis of the sampling methods to be completed. 

 Scoping level economic evaluations are completed to investigate the potential to 
economically exploit the deposit. 

 Infill drilling is completed to at least 40m by 40m to improve the confidence and increase 
the resource category. 

 Additional drilling is completed to further define the periphery of the deposit where 
insufficient drilling exists to define high confidence resources.  This also applies to similar 
geochemical and geophysical signatures identified in the ongoing regional exploration 
program. 

Keegan have provided a comprehensive 12 months exploration and resource definition 
program and budget for the Esaase Gold Project.  The second phase of exploration proposed 
is contingent on the level of success resulting from the first phase. 

Expenditure for the Esaase Gold Project (US$) is detailed below in Table 20_1.  

The first 6 months program involves pit optimization and scoping level economic evaluations 
on inferred resources, which will determine a rough estimate of the amenability of the deposit 
to different scenarios of mining, milling and ore beneficiation.  RC drilling of current 
exploration and resource extension targets will continue concurrently as will the 
commencement of infill drilling designed to move the near surface mineralization from the 
inferred category to the indicated category.  This will be combined with hole twinning, the 
collection of additional bulk density, assay lab checks, detailed regolith and structural studies, 
ongoing community development programs and the initiation of baseline environmental and 
socioeconomic studies. 



Coffey Mining Pty Ltd 

Esaase, Ghana, West Africa – PESA02 Page:  61 
Esaase Gold Deposit Resource Estimation – November 2007 

The second 6 month phase will involve more extensive RC and diamond drilling to assess the 
depth potential of the resource and further develop metallurgical and geotechnical databases 
to be used in engineering scoping studies.  Infill drilling will continue to move inferred category 
resources to the indicated category. Exploration will also continue on specific targets that 
have potential to increase the resource inventory.  Further economic analysis via pit 
optimisation and economic scoping studies will be applied to resources moved to the 
indicated category in order move the project further towards the pre-feasibility stage.

Coffey considers that the proposed exploration and evaluation strategy is consistent with the 
potential of the project, providing that it is appropriately staged in order to assess the results 
of on-going exploration.  The proposed expenditure is also generally considered to be 
adequate to cover the cost of the proposed programs and the budgets are adequate to meet 
minimum statutory expenditure requirements.
