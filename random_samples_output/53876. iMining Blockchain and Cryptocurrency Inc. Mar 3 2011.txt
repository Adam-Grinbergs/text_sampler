1.  Summary 

This technical report is intended to summarize geology, mineralization and previous work at the 
Mercedes property, southeastern Sonora, Mexico, located 250 kilometres east-southeast along 
Federal Highway 16 from the state capital, Hermosillo.  The author was commissioned by Parlane 
Resource Corporation ("Parlane") to visit the site, confirm previous exploration activities, collect 
check samples and recommend a work program based on the findings.  The resulting document 
conforms to NI 43-101 and is intended for submission to the BC Securities Commission and TSX 
Venture Exchange. 
 
Mercedes is an early stage exploration property prospective for high sulphidation epithermal style 
for gold-silver mineralization.  Previous operators conducted two programs of drilling on a 
mineralized ridge "La Lamosa" and encountered low-grade gold mineralization returning intervals 
including 144m averaging 0.49g/t gold and 12.4g/t silver from surface (08MER001) and 57m 
averaging 1.15g/t gold and 13.5g/t silver from surface (08MER003).  No resources or reserves 
exist on the property.   
 
This document was prepared by Dale Brittliffe, P.Geo, in accordance with the requirements of NI 
43-101 and Form 43-101F.  The writer relies primarily on background information sourced from a 
2008 report detailing diamond drilling on the property during that year.  During a property visit on 
October 24th and 25th 2010, the author collected 16 rock samples and supervised collection of 30 
soil samples.  
 
Property 
The property is accessible year round though seasonal high rainfall may affect some access 
trails.  The main prospect area is less than 500m from a gated highway turnoff. The Property is 
comprised of 3 contiguous claim blocks, totalling 360.8 hectares (Table 1; Figure 2).

In 2007, Norma Mines S.A. de C.V. ("Norma") signed a contract with owner Sr. Rodolfo Cuevas 
Coffey who signed the agreement in his own right and as legal counsel for Sr. Aniceto Martinez 
Barcelo whereby Norma could acquire 70% of the property from the owners upon signature of the 
agreement and payment of 50,000 US dollars. Norma Mines was the claim operator responsible 
for payment of taxes to keep claims in good standing.  In addition, after a period of two years from 
the date of signing, Norma had the option of purchasing the additional 30% ownership for 
$1,800,000 minus the original $50,000.  Claim status is discussed in section 4 and 6.  
 
On March 26th 2008 Galena Capital Corporation ("Galena") completed acquisition of Norma 
Canada and her Mexican and Peruvian subsidiaries, acquiring all issued and outstanding 



 

 

securities in Norma Canada in consideration of the issuance of 4,200,000 common shares of 
Galena (Galena news release March 25th 2007).  With this acquisition, Galena gained control of 
six mineral properties, of which Mercedes was one.  
 
In September 2010, Parlane signed a Letter of Intent with Galena by which, following an initial 
payment of US$10,000, Parlane would be granted a three month evaluation period on the 
property.  Should Parlane elect to continue, it could earn Galena's 70% share of the Mercedes 
property for a total of US$105,000 in staged payments over one year from the expiry date of the 
review period.  Galena was to retain a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty purchasable by 
Parlane for the sum of $1,000,000 at any time (Parlane news release September 8th 2010).  This 
LOI was subsequently terminated and replaced with an updated Option Agreement directly 
between Parlane and the owner as reported on February 22nd 2011 (Parlane news release 
February 22nd 2011). 
 
The Termination and Settlement Agreement (Parlane news release February 22nd 2011) sees 
Galena relinquish its 70% exploitation and profit interest in the Property.  In consideration of the 
termination agreement, Galena retains a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty, payable on any 
metal produced after 50,000 gold equivalent ounces of metal are produced by Parlane.  In 
addition, Parlane agrees to pay Galena $15,000 within 15 days of the agreement and an 
additional $75,000 within 12 months of the date of the agreement.   
 
The new Option Agreement between Parlane, though its fully owned Mexican subsidiary and the 
owner, Rodolfo Cuevas Coffey "Coffey", gives Parlane the right to earn a 100% interest in the 
Property and all rights thereto for the consideration of an initial payment of US$25,000, an 
additional payment of US$25,000 within six months and a final payment of U$450,000 within 
twelve months. Upon transfer of the full sum of US$500,000 Coffey will immediately transfer all 
right, title, interest and ownership to Parlane's Mexican subsidiary.  
 
Geology 
The property is located within the Sierra Madre Occidental province, a historically productive, 
regionally extensive Tertiary volcanic field which stretches from the United States /Mexico border 
to central Mexico.  Mercedes is located toward the western edge of the province and is underlain 
by a volcanic assemblage locally comprising andesite and dacite tuffs which have been intruded 
by granodiorite-monzonite quartz feldspar porphyry stocks.  Outcrop in key areas of the property 
are strongly altered brecciated intrusives and some volcanics.  Zoned assemblages of silica, 
phyllic, argillic and distal propylitic alteration are recognised.  The main prospect area "La 
Lamosa" is a prominent, highly oxidized red ridge, visible from the highway.   
 
Gold and silver are target commodities sought at Mercedes and the property exhibits textures and 
alteration consistent with high sulphidation epithermal mineralization. 
 
History 
In addition to small workings in the southeast of the property, previous exploration work includes 
two phases of drilling.  IN 1996 Compania Minera Fernanda S.A. de C.V. completed 15 Reverse 
Circulation holes for 1018m and in 2008 Norma Mines S.A. de C.V. drilled 10 diamond drillholes 
for a total of 1133m.  Both drill programs tested the La Lamosa area and returned anomalous 
results. 
 
There is question over the reliability of the RC drilling assays and it is possible that contamination 
was a source of error.  Diamond drilling conducted by Norma Mines in 2008 confirmed the 



 

 

presence of broad anomalous grades but did not replicate the tenor of those previously reported.  
Data from the 2008 program are considered reliable based on previous reporting (Rioux 2008). 
The author of this report has not viewed original assay certificates or core from this program. 
 
Environmental and Permitting 
To the best of the author's knowledge there are no existing environmental liabilities recognized on 
the property.  Previous mine workings are limited in extent and there are no obvious waste dumps 
in the area.  To the author's knowledge no mineral processing involving chemicals has been 
undertaken on the property.  Many of the drill sites created previously have been washed clean of 
cuttings by high rainfall during seasonal downpours.  
 
Parlane will be required to apply for environmental and surface work permits to conduct 
exploration activities at Mercedes. 
 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
Showings on the Mercedes property display alteration and textures consistent with high-
sulphidation epithermal gold-silver systems and "La Lamosa" prospect represents a target 
amenable to drill testing.  Currently the prospective zone measures just 200m long with a width of 
up to 30m, down dip continuity is suggested by previous drilling though drill orientations were not 
optimal.  Further work is recommended to test the true width and down-dip continuity of this zone.   
  
The author recommends a first pass program designed to both evaluate the property as a whole 
and determine the grade and extent of La Lamosa.  The recommend exploration program totals 
US$600,000 and comprises 2,000m of diamond drilling in 13 holes, property wide geological 
mapping and prospecting including collection of up to 200 rock chip samples and a 200 point soil 
sampling grid of 30m spaced intervals on ten, 100m spaced lines.  Recommended exploration is 
designed to evaluate La Lamosa and identify additional analogous zones.  Favourable results 
would warrant additional work on the property. 
 
 



 

 

2.  Introduction and Terms of Reference 

The Mercedes property is located in southeastern Sonora, Mexico, 250km southeast along 
Federal Highway 16 from Hermosillo and 20km west of Yecora, Sonora.  The district is 
prospective for epithermal gold/silver mineralization and previous work on the property includes 
access construction, rock chip sampling, RC drilling and diamond drilling.   
 
This document was commissioned by Parlane Resource Corporation, a Canadian exploration 
company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.  Dale Brittliffe, P.Geo. visited the property on 
October 24th and 25th 2010 to conduct a site inspection, collect rock samples for analysis and to 
locate key drill collar and access trail locations.  A property report summarizing geology, 
mineralization and previous work was prepared in this NI43-101 compliant document on the 
Mercedes property and recommends a first pass exploration program totalling $600,000. 
 
The objective of this report is to summarize the information available on the Mercedes Property, 
and compare with check samples taken during the field visit.  The author will draw conclusions 
about the exploration potential of the property and recommend further work. 
 
This technical report is prepared in compliance with the requirements of National Instrument 43-
101 and Form 43-101F. It is intended that this report be filed with the British Columbia Securities 
Commission and TSX Venture Exchange as required by Parlane Resource Corporation. 
 
This report was based primarily on one report detailing Diamond Drilling program in 2008 by Luc 
Rioux P.Geo. 2008).  Said document was prepared as a 43-101 compliant document (referred to 
in Galena Capital Corporation MD&A Sept 30,2008 www.sedar.com ) though it is not clear 
whether this was submitted to regulatory bodies.  Mr Rioux in turn relied on information from a 
1996 report on Reverse Circulation Drilling program.   
 
Confirmation work by the author includes rock sampling, soil sampling and GPS recording of 
access trails and drillhole collar locations.  The rock samples confirmed anomalous results within 
expected ranges and locations, a single soil line was run across the anomalous portion of the 
property to provide an orientation survey and record the geochemical response of the mineralized 
zone.  A total of 16 hand samples and 30 soil samples were collected during the site visit. 
 
Literature references are found in Section 20, and the reliability of the data is discussed in Section 
3 and 14. 
 
To the author's knowledge no mineral exploration permits were current at time of writing.  The 
author encountered no obvious environmental problems during the literature review or site visit. 
Previous mine workings are limited in extent and there are no obvious waste dumps in the area.  
To the author's knowledge no mineral processing involving chemicals has been undertaken on 
the property. While effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of these statements, the author 
is not qualified to comment on Mexican exploration permit process or environmental status issues 
and recommends independent advice be sought on these issues. 
 
All monetary values quoted herein are reported in US Dollars.  All measurements of length, area 
and distance are in metric values.  
 



 

 

3.  Reliance on Other Experts 

The writer of this document relies primarily upon the information compiled and reported in a 2008 
Technical Summary prepared for Galena Capital Corporation and Norma Mines S.A. de C.V. 
(Rioux 2008).  Additional information has been taken from the Geological Monograph of the State 
of Sonora, from the Consejo de Recursos Minerales (Mexican government) and NI 43-101 
compliant reports prepared for Alamos Gold Inc and Minas de Oro Nacional S.A. de C.V. on the 
Mulatos Deposit and for Grayd Resources on the La India Resource.  All references are included 
in Section 20 and 43-101 compliant reports are available to the public at www.sedar.com. 
 
Historical diamond drilling and rock sampling is of sufficient standard to provide useful information 
for inclusion in a database of background information for this study.  To the author's knowledge, 
no downhole surveys were conducted during the 2008 drilling, nor were collar locations accurately 
surveyed.  Diamond drill assays appear to be consistent throughout the data viewed by the 
author, these data were presented in digital spreadsheet and text file versions of the reported IPL 
assay certificates, no original assay certificates were been sighted.  Diamond drill results from 
2008 were not directly verified by check sampling as the core was not available at the time of the 
author's site visit in Mexico.  Core is reportedly in storage in Hermosillo and may possibly be 
accessed by arrangement. 
 
RC drill results have not been verified by the author as neither the source report nor assay sheets 
were available at time of writing.  The author's confirmation of historical drilling is limited to 
collection of GPS coordinates of key concrete collar monuments for both RC and diamond drill 
sites and rock chip sampling in up-dip projections of mineralization as indicated by geological and 
historical evidence.   
 
The author draws the reader's attention to the 2008 43-101 compliant report "Technical Summary 
Report on the Mercedes Property" prepared by Mr Luc Rioux P.Geo.  During 2008 Mr Rioux acted 
as Q.P. at Mercedes, overseeing a 10 hole diamond drilling program conducted by Norma Mines 
and the report was prepared as a 43-101 compliant technical summary of the property.  It is not 
clear whether this report was submitted to the BC securities commission though the author of this 
report is satisfied that Mr Rioux's report reflects actual diamond drilling conducted and QA/QC on 
sampling was undertaken at Mercedes.  Direct confirmation of assay results is not possible at the 
time of writing of this report and no original assay certificates were viewed by the author 
  
The 2008 report appears to have been prepared to NI 43-101 standards though the author of this 
document recognises the use of some language in the older report such as "ore body" and 
"deposit" used when describing Mercedes, an early stage exploration project with no 43-101 
compliant mineral resource or reserve.  These terms should be avoided until such time that a 
resource or reserve is calculated as the term implies an economically viable, accessible mineral 
occurrence on the property.   
 
An older technical report documenting the 1996 RC drilling program, unseen by the author but 
referred to extensively in the 2008 report, was not 43-101 compliant.  All historical exploration 
data referred to herein are sourced directly or indirectly from these two reports and while direct 
confirmation of drill assays has not been possible, they are considered of reasonable quality for 
use as an indication of the location and extent of mineralization, no more.  Additional confirmation 
work in the way of re-sampling available core and further drilling is required to advance the 
property.   
 



 

 

Geographical locations of the claim boundaries used in plans and maps herein were sourced from 
Rioux (2008).  The claim location map presented in that report did not include annotation 
describing the coordinate system and did not appear to match the WGS84 system used to report 
drillhole collar locations.  Comparison of topographic contours on the original map with field check 
GPS data indicate that the 2008 map was presented in NAD27 (Mexico) Zone 12 and it is this 
interpretation used herein.  The author considers this to be the case though recognises that there 
may be error in the original map and recommends current title maps/survey data be sourced to 
establish the exact claim boundaries.  
 
Claim status information is discussed in Section 4 and 6. Information regarding modifications to 
the mining law in 2006 was obtained from private communication with the issuer. Although this 
information is believed to be reliable, the author is not qualified to comment on Mexican mining or 
tenure legal matters and cannot verify the information.  
 
The author of this report has viewed a mineral title summary dated October 15th 2010 prepared by 
a legal firm based in Mexico City entitled "Mining Concessions Legal Interim Title Report".  The 
document was supplied to the author by Parlane and describes three mineral claims including 
current ownership status, applicable liens/agreements and lists payments required in order to 
keep the claims in good standing while waiting issue of the Mining Concession Titles.  Although 
this information is believed to be reliable, the author is not qualified to take responsibility for its 
accuracy. 
 
To the author's knowledge no mineral exploration permits were current at time of writing.  The 
author encountered no obvious environmental red-flags during the literature review nor did he 
observe visible environmental issues while conducting the site visit.  While effort has been made 
to ensure the accuracy of these statements, the author is not qualified to comment on Mexican 
exploration permit process or environmental status issues and recommends independent advice 
be sought on these issues.

Current title information are sourced from an unsigned, digital document entitled "Mining 
Concessions Legal Interim Title Report" dated October 15th 2010 prepared for Parlane Resources 
by Mexican Lawyer by RB Abogados of Mexico City.  The document indicates that all three 



 

 

fractions of the Mercedes Property are in good standing until at least the year 2048. To retain 
these property rights, the claim holder must continue to maintain their semester payments, and 
report annually any activities conducted on the property.   
 
To the best of the author's knowledge, the property has been legally surveyed and the mineral 
rights owned by Norma Mines S.A. de C.V., a private Mexican company (70%) and by Sr. Rodolfo 
Cuevas Coffey (owner of the C.R. and Ampliacion Mina del Oro claims), and Mr Aniceto Martinez 
Barcelo (owner of La Mina del Oro), Mexican citizens (30%). 
 
Pursuant to a signed contract (August 2007), Norma Mines S.A. de C.V. (70%) and Sr. Rodolfo 
Cuevas Coffey who signed the agreement in his own right and as legal counsel for Aniceto 
Martinez Barcelo (30%), the owners were to provide the mine concessions and Norma Mines 
$50,000 US dollars at signature of contract. Norma Mines also must file exploration work and pay 
the taxes in order to keep the claims in good standing. Although this information is believed to be 
reliable, the author disclaims responsibility for such information. 
 
On March 26th 2008 Galena Capital Corporation ("Galena") completed acquisition of Norma 
Canada and her Mexican and Peruvian subsidiaries including Norma Mines S.A. de C.V., 
acquiring all issued and outstanding securities in Norma Canada in consideration of the issuance 
of 4,200,000 common shares of Galena (Galena news release March 25th 2007).  With this 
acquisition, Galena gained control of six mineral properties, of which Mercedes was one 
 
In September 2010, Parlane signed a Letter of Intent with Galena by which, following an initial 
payment of US$10,000, Parlane would be granted a three month evaluation period on the 
property.  Should Parlane elect to continue, it could earn Galena's 70% share of the Mercedes 
property for a total of US$105,000 in staged payments over one year from the expiry date of the 
review period.  Galena was to retain a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty purchasable by 
Parlane for the sum of $1,000,000 at any time (Parlane news release September 8th 2010).  This 
LOI was subsequently terminated and replaced with an updated Option Agreement directly 
between Parlane and the owner as reported on February 22nd 2011 (Parlane news release 
February 22nd 2011). 
 
The Termination and Settlement Agreement (Parlane news release February 22nd 2011) sees 
Galena relinquish its 70% exploitation and profit interest in the Property.  In consideration of the 
termination agreement, Galena retains a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty, payable on any 
metal produced after 50,000 gold equivalent ounces of metal are produced by Parlane.  In 
addition, Parlane agrees to pay Galena $15,000 within 15 days of the agreement and an 
additional $75,000 within 12 months of the date of the agreement.   
 
The new Option Agreement between Parlane, though its fully owned Mexican subsidiary and the 
owner, Rodolfo Cuevas Coffey "Coffey", gives Parlane the right to earn a 100% interest in the 
Property and all rights thereto for the consideration of an initial payment of US$25,000, an 
additional payment of US$25,000 within six months and a final payment of U$450,000 within 
twelve months. Upon transfer of the full sum of US$500,000 Coffey will immediately transfer all 
right, title, interest and ownership to Parlane's Mexican subsidiary.  
 
Gold, silver and to a lesser extent copper are the target commodities sought at Mercedes. There 
is one main area of known to host gold, silver and copper mineralization "La Lamosa" and a 
smaller, secondary occurrence "Mina del Oro" that has seen limited historical production.  Further 
details about the mineralized zones and previous work is contained in Section 6 and 9 



 

 

 
During the site visit, the author took GPS readings at key locations including access trails, 
concrete collar monuments and flagged sample locations.  The coordinate system quoted in the 
2008 report is "WGS84" and these coordinates were converted to North American Datum 1927 
"NAD27" (Mexico), Zone 12.  This coordinate projection system is in wide use in Mexico and 
further work on the property should consider using this system.   
 
The sole source of claim boundary data for use in maps herein was the 2008 diamond drilling 
report by Rioux.  As mentioned above, the previous report quoted drilling coordinates in WGS84.  
During data compilation for this report, certain maps from the 2008 were registered in WGS84 for 
GIS purposes and converted to NAD27.  Drill coordinates extracted using this method were 
successfully located in the field in NAD27 (Mexico) Zone 12 very close to expected locations.  
This method was also applied to the 2008 claim map, "Norma Mines S.A. de C.V. Prodiedades 
Actuales Septiembre 2008" with the intention of tracing claim boundaries for use in GIS 
applications (Figure 2).  The said map showed claim boundaries as an overlay upon a low-
resolution topographic contour basemap, a UTM grid was included but the coordinate system not 
specified.  When outlines were digitized and converted as per the drillhole data, the resulting map 
did not match the field-confirmed location of drillholes nor the contours match the ridge location.  
When registered in NAD27 (Mexico) Zone 12, however, the basemap contours and strings did 
match known drillhole locations and the location of the ridge as depicted in Riuox 2008.  The 
author's GPS record of highway and access trail locations also support the original 2008 map 
being presented in NAD27 (Mexico) Zone 12. 
 
Government 1:50,000 topographic mapping is presented in ITRF92, very similar to WGS 84 and 
was used to double check the process described above with the same result.  It is the opinion of 
the author that this is a "most likely" explanation based on previously reported data but cannot 
assume responsibility for the claim locations based on these assumptions alone, confirmation in 
the form of survey data or a government mineral title map should be sought.

5.  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 
 

The Mercedes Property is accessible from the state capital of Hermosillo by paved Federal 
Highway 16 (Figure 3).  The Property is a 3.5 hour drive from Hermosillo, the town of Yecora lies 
another 40 minutes to the east.  The central portion of the property is located near the 250 
kilometre post.  "La Lamosa" Prospect area is located 500m east of the highway turnoff and is 
accessed by a gated, well formed ranch access trail directly from the highway.  Access to the 
property is in places steep and requires a 4 wheel drive.  
 

 
               Figure 3  Regional Location Plan – Mercedes Property 

 
The project sits on what appears to be the edge of an erosional window in the thick tertiary 
volcanic sequence of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) and traverses a range of elevations 
from the low, intrusive dominated valley bottoms in the north and east to a higher rim of mixed 
volcanics/intrusives in the west and south.  The local topographic relief is expressed by 
mountainous terrain of up to 1,400 metres above mean sea level (amsl) while the sierra along 
Highway 16 to the south reaches elevations over 2000m as the highway winds its way towards  
Yécora. The average elevation within the property limits is between 1,100 and 1,400 metres amsl.  
 
La Lamosa Hill area was the focus of recent historical exploration and comprises a red coloured, 
highly oxidised, visually striking hill extending from the highway grade (Plate 1).  Local vegetation 
consists of evergreen trees (mostly pines, cypress and evergreen oaks) reflecting typical lower 
alpine vegetation (Plate 2), the lower areas consist of low bushes and grasses.  
 



 

 

 
  Plate 1  Red coloured La Lamosa Hill - looking north from Highway 16, note powerlines in foreground, Tertiary 
upper volcanics are visible as steep cliffs in the right background 

 
 
The months of April to September are warm, and a heavy rainy season might impact the 
accessibility of the secondary roads giving access to the property. The months of October to 
March are cold with minimum temperatures often reaching the freezing point. 
 
Infrastructure and support services are available to the project.  Highway 16 passes through the 
western portion of the claims as it climbs eastward toward Yécora.  Numerous access trails exist 
and all main showings may be reached by way of these.  Refurbishment of some secondary 
tracks will be necessary in order to make them passable for vehicular traffic.  There is no water 
available within the property limits, water (for drilling purposes) was historically trucked in from a 
nearby well.  Electricity, mail and phone services are available in Yécora. An electrical line (C.F.E) 
passes through the property has it parallels the paved Federal Highway 16.  Accommodation is 
available at Yécora or in the nearby village of Santa Ana. 
 
The town of Yécora and the smaller village of Santa Ana have an available work force and 
equipment providers are also available to provide personnel and services to any future 
exploration and/or development needs of this property.

6.  History 
The exact date of original mining exploration activities in the area is unknown; however a history 
of mining exploration and development is reported in local verbal accounts. A history of mining in 
the Yécora district is reported to date back as far as the 1600's when a Jesuit missionary by the 
name of Alonso Victoria founded the town of San Idelfonso de Yécora in 1673, the town was later 
named Yécora by the Governor of Sonora, Adolfo de la Huerta on August 28, 1916 (Rioux 2008). 
 
6.1  Claim ownership and changes to land holdings 

In 2007, Norma Mines S.A. de C.V. (Norma) signed a contract with Sr. Rodolfo Cuevas Coffey 
who signed in his own right and as legal counsel for Sr. Aniceto Martinez Barcelo whereby Norma 
could acquire 70% of the property from the owners upon signature of the agreement and payment 
of 50,000 US dollars. Norma Mines was the current claim operator responsible for payment of 
taxes to keep claims in good standing.  In addition, after a period of two years from the date of 
signing, Norma had the option of purchasing the additional 30% ownership for $1,800,000 minus 
the original $50,000.  The author has viewed a legal title opinion commissioned by Parlane 
Resource Corp drawing on information from Mexican Mines Bureau and specifically the Public 
Registry of Mines which confirms the owners and agreements in place and although this 
information is believed to be reliable, the author disclaims responsibility for such information. 
 
On March 26th 2008 Galena Capital Corporation ("Galena") completed acquisition of Norma 
Canada and her Mexican and Peruvian subsidiaries, including Norma Mines S.A. de C.V., 
acquiring all issued and outstanding securities in Norma Canada in consideration of the issuance 
of 4,200,000 common shares of Galena (Galena news release March 25th 2007).  With this 
acquisition, Galena gained control of six mineral properties, of which Mercedes was one. 
 
In September 2010, Parlane signed a Letter of Intent with Galena by which, following an initial 
payment of US$10,000, Parlane would be granted a three month evaluation period on the 
property.  Should Parlane elect to continue, it could earn Galena's 70% share of the Mercedes 
property for a total of US$105,000 in staged payments over one year from the expiry date of the 
review period.  Galena was to retain a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty purchasable by 
Parlane for the sum of $1,000,000 at any time (Parlane news release September 8th 2010).  This 
LOI was subsequently terminated and replaced with an updated Option Agreement directly 
between Parlane and the owner as reported on February 22nd 2011 (Parlane news release 
February 22nd 2011). 
 
The Termination and Settlement Agreement (Parlane news release February 22nd 2011) sees 
Galena relinquish its 70% exploitation and profit interest in the Property.  In consideration of the 
termination agreement, Galena retains a 1% Net Smelter Returns (NSR) royalty, payable on any 
metal produced after 50,000 gold equivalent ounces of metal are produced by Parlane.  In 
addition, Parlane agrees to pay Galena $15,000 within 15 days of the agreement and an 
additional $75,000 within 12 months of the date of the agreement.   
 
The new Option Agreement between Parlane, though its fully owned Mexican subsidiary and the 
owner, Rodolfo Cuevas Coffey "Coffey", gives Parlane the right to earn a 100% interest in the 
Property and all rights thereto for the consideration of an initial payment of US$25,000, an 
additional payment of US$25,000 within six months and a final payment of U$450,000 within 
twelve months. Upon transfer of the full sum of US$500,000 Coffey will immediately transfer all 
right, title, interest and ownership to Parlane's Mexican subsidiary.  



 

 

 
6.2  Historical exploration activities 

Minor, small scale historical mining has occurred on the claims although the author is not aware 
of recorded production.  At La Lamosa hill there is evidence of several small test pits and 
excavations though these measure only a few cubic metres and are too small to have been 
productive.   
 
Toward the southeastern corner of the claims are the Mina del Oro workings and the author 
visited two separate excavations.  The workings are within intrusive and volcanic rocks, the first is 
a hand cut inclined shaft sunk in intrusives, now almost completely overgrown and difficult to find 
without a guide.  Hand samples from spoil around the excavation show malachite/azurite and 
pyrite mineralization. The second is a shallow slot excavated along a thin quartz-sericite altered 
structure on the hillside.  Local guides say that workings here are obscured due to a collapse.  
Drilling in 2008 tested these both of these workings (MER-7 to 10) for details see section 6.2.2 
below.  
 
Two phases of drilling were performed on the Mercedes Property.  In 1996, a reverse circulation 
drilling program consisting of 15 drill holes totalling 1,018 metres was completed by Compania 
Minera Fernanda.  In 2008, Galena Capital/Norma mines completed a diamond drilling campaign 
comprising 10 holes for a total of 1133m.  Data and discussion relating to these programs were 
summarized in the 2008 Technical Report (Rioux 2008) and tables 3 and 4 below detail collar 
information from this report.  
 
Geographic coordinates from the previous report were quoted in WGS84 reference coordinate 
system.  The author of this report believes the North American Datum 1927 (Mexico) (NAD27 
Mexico) projection to be more versatile for local, project scale work due to compatibility with some 
private and publicly available datasets and has converted the WGS coordinates into NAD27, 
Zone 12.

6.2.1  Reverse Circulation Drilling 1996 

A report detailing drilling completed by Compania Minera Fernanda in 1996 is referenced by 
Rioux 2008 though a copy was not available at the time of preparing this document.  No 
verification of these data are possible, they are presented as historical work and indicate the 
presence of disseminated gold mineralization of sufficient extent and tenor to warrant further 
investigation.  Figures from the Rioux report are reproduced below for the purposes of illustration.   
 
Figures 4, 5 and 6 below depict 15 RC holes along a northeast trending area measuring 200m x 
50m.  This shape approximates outcropping hematite, limonite and jarosite oxidized and silicified 
brecciated intrusives which form the backbone of La Lamosa hill.  Grades shown on the plans 
indicate that every hole was mineralized, for example YRC 1-1, 4 and 8 all returned over 1g/t Au 
from their entire length.  There is no indication of the type of RC hammer/bit or sampling/splitting 
methods used, nor are there any assay sheets or available to verify these results.  The tenor and 
consistency of mineralization returned from all RC drill holes suggests that contamination was a 
problem during this drilling program.

6.2.2  Diamond Drilling 2008 

Norma Mines S.A. de C.V.'s 2008 diamond drilling program consisted of 10 holes for a total of 
1133m.  The first two holes (08MER-001 and 002) attempted to twin reverse circulation holes 
drilled in 1996 by Compania Minera Fernanda S.A. de C.V.  Norma sought to confirm the highly 
anomalous, consistent values reported from the RC drilling and a diamond core drill was used for 
the program in order to eliminate potential contamination.  The diamond rig's dimensions and 
configuration were such that holes could not be drilled from the original 1996 drill sites.  As a 
result, the diamond holes were located close to the RC holes and with the same orientation but 
did not exactly duplicate them.  To the author's knowledge, no downhole surveys were recorded, 
nor were drill collars accurately surveyed.  
 
Diamond drilling tested several areas on the claim and confirmed anomalous gold values.  Six 
holes were drilled in the La Lamosa Hill locale and four were drilled about the Mina del Oro 
workings (Figure 7).  Assay values discussed below were sourced from Norma Mines' digital 
dataset comprising spreadsheets and digital text files.  Values from these files confirm those 
reported by Rioux (2008), the author of this report did not see original assay certificates. 
 
La Lamosa drilling 
The first six holes were drilled in the La Lamosa Hill area and were designed to confirm previous 
RC grades.  Best results came from the 08MER001-003 and significant intercepts are shown 
below (Table 5).

Holes 08MER001-003 collared within the oxidised zone at La Lamosa and confirmed the 
presence of consistently anomalous mineralization from surface.  Long intervals of low-grade 
mineralization are considered significant in this setting.  Previous operators interpreted the data 
differently, reporting high grade, vein style mineralization but not including the broad, low grade 
intercepts as evidenced by the intercept summaries in (Rioux 2008)   



 

 

 
Figure 7  Diamond Drill Plan - Norma Mines 2008 

Drilling returned encouraging results from the first three holes at La Lamosa.  Subsequent holes 
08MER004-006 stepped along trend to the southwest and failed to intercept broad, low grade 
mineralization.  Current interpretation at La Lamosa sees mineralization contained within a 30m 
wide envelope which in turn contains a central, silicified zone which represents a possible feeder 
structure.  This tabular mineralized package is estimated to strike approximately 0500 and dip 
steeply to the southeast.  Diamond holes 08MER004 - 006 were drilled towards the southeast, the 



 

 

same direction as the interpreted dip of mineralization.  If the target zone did continue along trend 
to the southwest, it would project between the collar locations of holes 004 and 006 to the 
northwest and 005 to the southeast of it (see Figure 8).  This is significant as the holes dip the 
same direction as mineralization and as such, holes 004 and 006 may have collared in the 
footwall and drilled beneath the zone while hole 005 may have collared in the hangingwall and 
drilled above the zone (Figure 8 below). 
 

 
                                  Figure 8  Transverse Section of La Lamosa Diamond Drilling Looking NE 

There is no firm evidence to indicate the continuation of mineralization along trend to the 
southwest however it is the author's opinion that 08MER004-006 did not adequately test the 
possibility and therefore absence of evidence from these holes should not be construed as 
evidence of absence.  
 
Mina del Oro Drilling 
Four holes, 08MER007-010, were drilled in the Mina del Oro locale (Figure 7 above) and targeted 
an area of old workings.  Visible small scale mining at this area focussed on a thin, quartz-
sericite-clay altered structure hosting quartz veining as well as a zone of silicified breccia/vein 
material as evidenced from rubble scattered about a small inclined shaft.  These occurrences are 
roughly 50m apart and may be related to each other.  Workings on the thin structure are not 
visible due to a collapse but outcrop and spoil may inspected on surface. Drill holes 08MER008 
and 009 were drilled from one pad and angled to intersect this structure and returned results of 
1m grading 0.78 g/t gold from hole 08MER008 and 3 individual 1m samples grading 0.31, 0.36 
and 0.45 g/t gold from 08MER009 (see Table 6).   
 



 

 

Hole 08MER010 may have been oriented to intercept mineralization exploited by the small 
inclined shaft 50m southeast of holes 008 and 009 though this is not obvious and it is not clear 
whether the hole was barren because the structure was not mineralized or because the hole 
missed the target.  No obvious target for hole 10MER007 was located by the author on the 
surface and no significant intervals were returned from the hole.

6.2.3  Historical Rock Geochemistry 
During the course of fieldwork, Norma Mines collected 62 rock samples in the area; 3 from 
outlying areas, 4 from Mina del Oro and 55 from three main benches at La Lamosa.  Many of 
these sample sites were located in the field during the 2010 site visit though original assay 
certificates were not available. 
 
A plan showing gold values from historical rock sampling is depicted below in Figure 9.  Strongest 
mineralization was encountered along the La Lamosa hilltop from within the outcropping 
mineralized zone.  Two additional benches were sampled downslope to the south and returned 
low results.  This may be explained using the current exploration model in which the anomalous 
envelope strikes towards 0500 and dips steeply to the southeast – resulting barren hangingwall 
material outcropping along the two southern benches.

6.3  Historical mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates 

Referred to by Rioux (2008), the 1996 report from Compania Minera Fernanda S.A. de C.V. 
estimated a parcel of mineralization at La Lamosa to be 35 metres thick, 80 metres long and 
extending 85 metres down-dip. This evaluation was not prepared in compliance with the current 
CIM standards and definitions for estimating resources as required by NI 43-101 and should not 
be considered a valid calculation. 
 
6.4  Historical production 

To the author's knowledge there has been no historical production other than from small scale 
excavations observed in the Mina del Oro area on the property. 



 

 

7.  Geological Setting 

7.1 Regional Geology 

Publicly available 1:250,000 geological mapping is shown in Figure 10 below.  Mercedes is within 
the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) and is officially underlain by both upper and lower Tertiary 
volcanic packages.  The oldest mapped rocks in the area are Cretaceous plutons, the largest of 
which underlies Santa Ana and San Nicholas west of the property.  Observations made during the 
site visit indicate that there is more intrusive material cropping out at surface than suggested by 
the map below.  The valley to the east of the property area appears to be a large bowl-shaped 
erosional window exposing numerous intrusive stocks within or underlying the volcanics.  The 
geomorphology of the area east of the highway suggests that the valley may represent a large 
collapsed caldera though this is observation only.  
 
Intrusives in the Santa Ana area just west of the project area are granitic to granodioritic in 
composition. Overlying volcanics are mostly andesitic tuffs. Above these units there are rhyolite 
tuffs, ignimbrites, breccias and agglomerates of Lower Tertiary Age. Along with the rhyolite 
extrusives there are dark grey to purple coloured andesitic flows in places.  Overlying these units 
is a polymictic conglomerate of Upper Tertiary Age which shows a discordance with the 
underlying rhyolites, andesites and dacites. All the units were overlain by Quaternary olivine 
basalts exhibiting vesicular textures.

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

Little detailed geological mapping is available for this property, though it is known to be underlain 
by three main geological units: Porphyritic rhyolitic tuff containing numerous quartz crystals, 
Aphanitic andesite flows and tuffs locally brecciated, propylitically altered and sometimes 
mineralized and porphyritic felsic intrusive (logged as QFP - quartz-feldspar porphyry in previous 
drilling campaigns) of granodioritic to monzonitic composition. The intrusive unit is most often 
encountered as a rusty red brecciated and silicified rock in the La Lamosa Hill area.  In this 
location there is a volcanic/intrusive contact on the northern flank of the hill which may prove to be 
the footwall contact of mineralization.  Andesites are typically propylitically altered while the 
variably silicified intrusives display a strong argillic and phyllic alteration. Overlying the 
abovementioned units is a volcanic complex of Upper Tertiary Age which is divided into 2 
separate units: the Lower Volcanics mostly comprised of andesites and dacites and the Upper 
Volcanics mostly comprised of ignimbrites, breccias and agglomerates.  The upper volcanics 
were not observed at the focus of work, La Lamosa, nor Mina del Oro. It is expected that they are 
to be found at higher elevations toward the southwestern and western edges of the property.

The northeast trending oxidized La Lamosa Hill (Plate 3) is variably silicified, grading from 
moderate to intense along the main trend.  Zones of "vuggy silica" were observed, these zones 
often returning the highest gold grades in rock samples.  Alteration assemblages recognised 
within the hematitic intrusive breccia tend to display a zonation away from a silica rich core to 
strong argillic and phyllic type (quartz, clays and sericite), to an argillic type (kaolin and sericite) 
and into propylitic (chlorite-epidote) further away from the mineralized zone.  Tourmaline 



 

 

alteration outcrops near the extreme NE end of the hill though grab samples do not return 
anomalous gold values.  The main La Lamosa area is conspicuously oxidised, easily visible from 
the highway as a bright red hill extending out from the road grade.  Hematite, Limonite and 
Jarosite are the most common iron oxides and are often found in conjunction with some level of 
silicification (Plate 4).  Strongly oxidised, red rocks are often mineralized, best results from grab 
sampling have been returned from highly silicified outcrops (see Plate 6 below).

8.  Deposit Types 

The Mercedes Property lies within an epithermal system and exhibits many characteristics of a 
high sulphidation (HS) or acid-sulphate type. HS gold-silver deposits are common in plutonic-
volcanic arcs and numerous examples exist in the Sierra Madre Occidental within the district.  
There have been many studies on epithermal deposits, a detailed compilation of characteristics 
and genetic models of this diverse style is summarized in Heald et al (1987).  HS deposits are 
characterized by distinctive alteration styles and textures caused by the passage of high 
temperature acidic hydrothermal fluids though suitably fractured or permeable rocks.  Commonly 
they display zoned alteration whereby a central silica core is flanked by advanced argillic 
alteration often containing alteration minerals such as dickite, pyrophyllite, alunite, kaolinite or 
diaspore.  "Vuggy silica" is a texture/alteration product known to be indicative of this style and is 
caused by silica replacement and acid leaching of the soluble components of host rocks in 
proximity to the causative fluid pathways. High sulphidation epithermal deposits can be vein 
hosted or disseminated and are often high tonnage and low grade.  Local examples include 
Alamos Gold's Mulatos Deposit 40km ENE of Mercedes and Grayd Resources' La India Project 
roughly 40km NE of Mercedes.   
 
Previous work at the La Lamosa area reports disseminated gold mineralization hosted within an 
andesitic to rhyodacitic volcanic complex intruded by a quartz-feldspar porphyry (QFP).  The 
resistant spine of the La Lamosa hill is composed of a strongly silicified breccia zone within the 
intrusive close to the volcanic contact and shows strong oxidation in the form of 
hematite/limonite/jarosite staining and strong silica and argillic alteration.  The main control for the 
mineralization at Mercedes is structural and the mineralized showing is oriented 050° dipping 
steeply to the southeast. There is evidence of abrupt changes in alteration over the property and 
detailed mapping would probably identify several additional fault orientations. 
 
Gold occurs in oxide, mixed oxide/sulphide, and sulphide ore types reported in the drilling with 
pyrite being the primary sulphide mineral along with minor amounts of enargite. The best gold 
values were mostly located within the oxidized zone, some in the mixed oxide-sulphide and very 
little within the sulphide zone. Base metal values, especially copper seem to be higher downhole 
indicating a potential zonation. 



 

 

9.  Mineralization 

 
Mineralization at the La Lamosa prospect is hosted by brecciated and sheared quartz feldspar 
porphyry intrusive sometimes near contacts with andesitic flows and tuffs. Mineralization appears 
to be disseminated in much of the strongly oxidized/silicified rock with locally higher grade zones 
reflected in diamond drill results and individual grab samples.  Broad zones averaging around 0.5 
g/t gold were returned from historical diamond drilling and individual metres sampled up to 16g/t 
gold.  Rocks within the mineralized showing are highly altered and often host quartz stringers and 
veinlets.  The strongly oxidized and silica altered portion of the hill has historically returned the 
highest individual grades.  
 
The mineralization control is structural, through faults and shear zones. To the SW of the 
Mercedes there is reportedly a fault showing a general trend of 325° with a -75° dip to the NE. 
This fault is said to mark the contact between the QFP and the andesites and may represent the 
southwest extent of La Lamosa due to a fault offset. One hundred and ten metres northeast, is 
another reported fault oriented 310° dipping -75° to the SW. On the northwestern edge of the 
hematitic zone, the contact between the QFP and the andesites has been determined to be 
oriented to approximately 030°. The most northeastern portion of the anomalous zone is 
comprised of numerous intersections of faults showing variable orientations. It is believed that the 
"feeder" structure for La Lamosa mineralization is oriented approximately 050° within strongly 
fractured, faulted and brecciated zones. 
 
The results obtained from the core diamond drilling program in the La Lamosa Hill area, clearly 
indicate the presence of anomalous gold, silver and to lesser extent copper mineralization and 
warrant further investigation.  
 



 

 

10.  Exploration 

Check sampling was conducted by the author during a site visit in October 2010 and comprised 
rock chip and grab sampling at La Lamosa and Mina del Oro and a single line of soil samples 
taken to characterise La Lamosa's geochemical response. Previous work indicated disseminated 
gold mineralization within oxidised rocks and could be expected to produce a strong soil anomaly.  
The purpose of work was to confirm the presence and potential extent of gold mineralization.  
 
10.1  Rock and Soil Sampling  

Check sampling comprised 16 chip and grab rock samples from key points on the property, Table 
7 below shows details of this work and the plan overleaf Figure 11 shows the locations.  In 
addition, 30 soil samples were taken on 30m intervals across the trend of mineralization (Figure 
12).

Rock sampling included grab and chip samples mostly about La Lamosa .hill in the eastern 
portion of the property. Mineralization appears to be confined to an ENE trending zone roughly 
30m across and 200m long.  Check sampling across this feature was possible at outcrops and 
road cuts.  A good geological cross-section is exposed near the southeastern extent of the 
anomalous zone and sample nos 98067, 68 and 69 represent three continuous chip samples over 
an estimated horizontal width of 26m (Plate 7). 
 

 
Plate 7  Photo showing chip sampling across main mineralized zone at La Lamosa 

The photo looks northeast along the trend of mineralization and shows a central silicified core 
approximately 8m across flanked on either side by oxidized, brecciated and argillically altered 
intrusive rock.  Continuous chip sampling across the intervals returned 1375, 475 and 561ppb 
gold from #986067, 68 and 69 respectively.  These numbers estimate an approximate horizontal 
interval of 26m, weighted average of 785ppb gold. 
 
The silicified zone pictured strikes roughly to 0500 and dips steeply to the southeast.  The zone is 
resistant to erosion compared to the surrounding rock and forms the spine of La Lamosa Hill.  It is 
reasonable to assume that this zone has provided a conduit for hydrothermal fluids and is 
intimately associated with mineralization at this location.  Elsewhere on the property, sililcified 
float was observed to be shedding from several places on the hillside. Previous physical work and 
road building did not obviously test these outlying zones and they may represent targets for 
reconnaissance work.  
 
Results from soil sampling confirm mineralization across the trend, returning a multi point gold 
anomaly over the crest of La Lamosa Hill.  When viewed in conjunction with the rock sampling, an 
anomalous zone measuring up to 200m long is suggested (Figure 12).     
 
Check assaying supports the presence of exposed or near surface gold mineralization at La 
Lamosa which extends for roughly 200m and is at least 26m wide.  Silica rich tourmaline breccias 
sampled from the northeastern end of this zone returned low gold numbers.  The southwestern 
extension of the zone is not obvious at surface and its presence is not clear as the intensity of 
visibly hematitic rock/soil drops considerably in that direction.  Geomorphological indications 
suggest that there are structures running to the northwest and may represent offsetting faults.

11.  Drilling 

Drilling on the property has been described in Exploration History - Section 6. 
 
 

12.  Sampling Method and Approach 

All rock and soil samples were taken by or under the direct supervision of Dale Brittliffe P.Geo.   
during a two day site visit on October 24th and 25th, 2010. The purpose of sampling was to confirm 
mineralization at key showings on the property.  The author had access to an historical report 
detailing previous drilling and discussions on mineralization encountered at the site.  These data 
plus historical grab sample data provided base maps for the investigation.  During October 24th 
and 25th, the author walked all access trails on the La Lamosa and Mina del Oro areas and took 
GPS readings on drill collars and cultural features as they were encountered.   
 
Rock chip samples were taken by hand, sampling and aimed to collect continuous, representative 
samples over desired sample widths.  Only three grab samples were taken from Mina del Oro and 
were noted as such at the time of recording.  Each site was marked with orange spray paint and a 
aluminum permatag. GPS locations and descriptions were recorded in both notebook and sample 
ticket book.  Samples, along with sample tag were placed in labelled plastic sample bags which 
were placed in larger polyweave rice sacks, for transport to the laboratory.  Rock sampling was 
designed to confirm mineralization, not constitute a comprehensive sampling program and as 
such chip intervals were selected to be representative of features being observed, chip sample 
lengths are estimated.  
 
Soil samples were collected on 30m centres using a two man crew and a 30m chain.  Sampling 
began at the crest of La Lamosa hill and ran down each side of the ridge.  The line was oriented 
to approximately 1400/3200 to cut across the mineralization (orientation 0500) at a right angle.  
Samples were collected from holes of approximately 10-15cm depth excavated with a small pick.  
GPS coordinates were recorded in a notebook and the sites marked with flagging tape.  Samples 
were placed into premarked 6x8" Kraft sample bags and all samples put into a polyweave rice 
bag for transport to the laboratory.  
 



 

 

 
13.  Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

Samples were recorded and bagged in polyweave rice sacks.  All samples were transported to 
Hermosillo by the author and sent by local shipping company to Acme Analytical Laboratories' 
Guadalajara facility in Jalisco state.  
 
Soil samples were received by Acme in Guadalajara and were dried at 60 degrees Celcius and 
dry sieved to -80 mesh.  Pulps were transported to Acme's Vancouver lab and a 15 gram sample 
charge was subject to analysis by the 1DX2 method, involving aqua regia digestion with ICP-MS 
analysis for a 37-element suite including gold, silver and copper.   
 
Rock chip and grab samples were prepared in Acme's Guadalajara laboratory and were subject 
to sample prep method R200-250.  Samples were crushed, split and pulverized 250g to 200 
mesh.  Once prepared, pulps were shipped to Acme's Vancouver laboratory where the sample 
pulps were mixed to improve heterogeneity, and a 30g and a 0.5 gram subsample split off.  The 
30g charge was analysed for gold by the 3B01 method, fire assay fusion with ICP-ES finish.  The 
0.5 charge was analysed for a 37-element suite by the 1DX1 aqua regia digestion ICP-MS 
analysis method. 
 
Assay certificates were sent exclusively to the author on completion of the analyses. 
 
Acme's Vancouver laboratory has Quality Management System ISO 9001:2008 accreditation.  
While Acme is working toward the goal, its Guadalajara sample prep facility is not yet registered 
under this system.  Assay results do reflect expected ranges suggested by previous reported 
work and the author of this document is satisfied that gold mineralization is present where it was 
expected and the project warrants further, more rigorous investigation. 
 
 
14  Data Verification  

The author visited the Mercedes Property on October 24th and 25th 2010.  All cat/access tracks on 
the main prospect area were inspected on foot and picked up with a hand-held GPS.  Every 
attempt was made to locate drill collars from the two previous programs.   

The area is steep and receives high rainfall during the wet season.  Seasonal drainage of large 
rainfall volumes has largely removed drill cuttings, clays and other tell-tale signs of drilling at 
several locations.  Some collars were not located on the ground. Eight diamond drill collars from 
the 10 holes 2008 drilling were tentatively located.  Not all of these were marked by concrete 
monuments and in several cases the author was forced to make a judgement as to whether the 
disturbance on the pad was caused by diamond drilling activities.  Guidance in the field was 
supplied by a local from Santa Ana who was involved in both of the previous drilling programs.  
Discrepancy between collected and reported GPS coordinates from these 8 collar sites ranges up 
to 16m and average at 9.5m difference.  This represents broadly acceptable variation between 
handheld 12 channel GPS units and may be considered acceptable as verification that drilling 
was conducted as reported previously.  Accurate pick-up of the collars will be essential for these 
holes to be used for any form of resource calculation.  It is important to note that the author has 
not seen any downhole survey data and can only assume that no readings were taken.   

Concrete hole plugs marking four collars from the 15 hole 1996 RC program were located on the 
ground (see Plate 8 below).  The author assumes that many RC drill pads were disturbed during 



 

 

the 2008 diamond drill program and this would account for the lack of concrete monuments visible 
from the earlier phase of work.

The core from the 2008 diamond drilling program is in secure storage at Norma Mines' Hermosillo 
core shack and storage shed (pers comm).  The core is reportedly available to view by 
arrangement and it would be a useful to view and sample mineralized zones from this work.  
 



 

 

 
15.  Adjacent Properties 

There are several deposits within the surrounding area of the Mercedes Property. The Mulatos 
deposit (gold) is located some 40 kilometres to the ENE and Grayd Resources' La India Gold 
Project is 40km NE. The Santa Ana deposit (copper and silver) is located some 13 kilometres to 
the SW. The La Trinidad deposit (silver) is located some 15 kilometres to the NE. It is also quite 
common to find within the surrounding area some small pits and adits that were exploited for their 
tungsten content.  Personal communication with locals from Santa Ana indicate that several 
prospects surrounding Mercedes have been drilled in the past, up to seven holes are thought to 
have been drilled in surrounding hills by companies such as Peńoles Mining Company.  
 
Alamos Gold Inc's. Mulatos deposit is situated 40km ENE from Mercedes and is a large high 
sulphidation epithermal gold-silver deposit which has been in production for several years.  The 
property is located within a group of concessions totalling 30,325 hectares.  
 
The Mulatos mineral reserve calculation as at the December 31, 2009 states Proven and 
Probable Reserves of 61.6 million tonnes averaging 1.21g/t gold for a total of 2.4 million 
contained ounces of gold, providing a mine life of over 11 years at current production levels.  
(Alamos Gold MD&A ended Sept  30 2009 – www.sedar.com) 
 
Grayd Resources commenced drilling on this high sulphidation epithermal gold-silver property in 
2004 and has an advanced exploration project in La India.  Grayd is working towards production 
and to date measured and indicated resources total 26.77 million tonnes at a grade of 0.883 g/t 
gold for a total contained 760,000 ounces gold.  Preliminary Economic Assessments have been 
recommended with the aim of raising the project to Pre-Feasibility level  (Gray and Giroux 2010).  
 
Mineralization at La India is contained within numerous spatially separate but genetically related 
zones of low grade gold mineralization within a high sulphidation epithermal gold-silver system.   
 
La India and Mulatos are large deposits composed of numerous mineralized zones.  At present 
La Lamosa represents a single mineralized zone at Mercedes.  Going forward, work should focus 
both on defining extents of mineralization at La Lamosa and on identification of additional similar 
occurrences on the property.   



 

 

16.  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Reportedly, in 1996, Minera Fernanda conducted metallurgical testwork. At the time of writing this 
report, the author had not seen the 1996 report, nor supporting data such as metallurgical 
testwork summaries or reports, laboratory used, sample quantities, sample origin, methods 
employed or any other technical information on this work.  Rioux (2008) mentions that testing was 
performed with oxidized material and cyanidation recoveries were 80% for gold and 15% silver 
contained in metallurgical samples. Average grades (writer assumes this is head grade) in this 
testing were between 0.6 and 1.3 g/t Au and 4 to 10 g/t silver. The consumption of reagents was 
approximately 0.70 kilograms of cyanide sodium per metric tonne of mineral.  The data are not NI 
43-101 compliant and should not be relied upon. 
 
 

17.  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

The property remains at an early exploration stage. No data have yet been generated from which 
to estimate either resources or reserves. 



 

 

18.  Interpretation and Conclusions 

Mercedes is an early stage gold exploration property located in the Sierra Madre Occidental of 
southeastern Sonora, Mexico, easily accessed from Highway 16, roughly 3½ hours drive 
southeast of the state capital, Hermosillo.  Parlane Resource Corp has now simplified ownership 
issues by signing a Termination and Settlement agreement with previous option holder Galena 
Resources' fully owned Mexican subsidiary Norma Mines Ltd and signing a new Option 
Agreement directly with the claim owner (Parlane News Release February 22nd 2011). 
 
Previous work indicates that La Lamosa Hill hosts a structurally controlled, low-grade 
disseminated oxide, transitional and sulphide gold bearing zone displaying similar alteration and 
textural characteristics to high sulphidation epithermal deposits in the district.  At surface an 
exposed cross section of the zone displays a silica rich core up to 8 metres wide flanked on either 
side by at least ten metres of brecciated silica and clay altered intrusive rock.  The entire face was 
sampled by check sampling and returned a weighted average of an estimated 26m grading 
0.785g/t gold.  Evidence suggests the mineralized zone strikes towards 0500 and dips steeply at 
75-80 degrees to the southeast. 
 
Two drilling programs and reconnaissance fieldwork including rock grab and chip sampling were 
run by previous operators.  Fifteen RC holes were drilled in 1996 and ten diamond drill holes in 
2008.  Results from the RC program returned highly anomalous results of a consistency that 
suggest downhole contamination was a factor.  The 2008 diamond drilling program sought to test 
these grades and establish the limits of mineralization over the La Lamosa Hill prospect; results 
were generally lower than the previous work and more variable, more realistic in the author's 
opinion.  These results were encouraging, as reinterpretation of the work suggests that the first 
three diamond holes intersected a zone of disseminated gold mineralization up to 30m wide.  
Correlation of this work with observations at surface suggest that the prospective zone may 
extend horizontally for around 200m, down dip extension is unknown and drill testing is 
recommended.  
 
At present the mineralized zone visible at surface measures 200m long by around 30m wide 
although outcrop evidence is limited to 26m of width the true extent is not known.  Data from the 
RC drilling was not available at the time of writing and it is the opinion of the author that the RC 
drilling should be discounted for further work.  Diamond drilling completed in 2008 sought to twin 
two of these holes and test other areas on the property and as such previous work was not 
completed on sections and may not have been optimal at La Lamosa.  A systematic drilling 
program designed to test the width and potential down-dip extensions of the mineralized zones is 
warranted.   
 
Previous operators had interpreted the drill results from the perspective of a high-grade, vein style 
model as evidenced by intercepts reported previously.  Intervals from the first diamond hole 
08MER001 were reported by Rioux (2008) as a series of small intervals exceeding 1g/t gold 
including better intercepts such as 5m averaging 1.45 g/t gold.  If, instead of isolating high grade 
vein hosted intercepts, the operator considers a low-grade disseminated oxide style, the 
component intercepts and interstitial low grade zones average 144m grading 0.49g/t gold from 
surface, the top 144m of the hole may be considered mineralized.  Discovery of significant 
extensions to known mineralization would greatly enhance the property as oxide/transitional 
material from La Lamosa may be ultimately be amenable to heap leaching.  
 



 

 

Reinterpretation of La Lamosa prospect as an elongate, tabular low-grade, disseminated gold 
bearing zone is attractive as it suggests that a large proportion of the rock comprising the hill 
could represent mineralized material The current exploration model includes a 30-50m wide zone 
of mineralization striking toward 0500 dipping steeply southeast, the footwall contact being 
propylitically altered volcanics as seen in road cuts on the northern flank of the hill.  Along strike 
colour anomalies disappear though there are other silica float occurrences in the area and follow 
up surface geochemistry including rock, soil sampling and reconnaissance mapping would be 
essential in evaluating the potential of the property.  High sulphidation deposits such as La India 
40km to the northwest are composed of numerous mineralized zones, often spatially separate 
from each other and it is important to evaluate the entire Mercedes property for additional 
mineralized showings to complement La Lamosa. 



 

 

19.  Recommendations 

The author considers Mercedes prospective for further exploration.  Mineralization is indicated by 
previous drilling and supported by recent rock chip and soil sampling.  Field investigations 
suggest that previous drilling may not have been oriented to intersect the target zone at an 
optimal angle.  Diamond drilling is recommended to test down-dip extensions, establish the width 
and length of mineralization at La Lamosa.  Surface geochemistry including rock chip/grab 
sampling, soil sampling and reconnaissance geological mapping is recommended for outlying 
areas in order to better evaluate the surrounding property.  
 
Drilling is recommended in thirteen holes on four sections for a total of 2000m (Figure 13, Table 
8), successful results would return mineralization over a strike length of 240m and a down dip 
length of up to 250m on section 10520.

In addition to drilling, surface sampling and geological mapping is recommended in order to 
identify and test additional mineralization within the claims.  To this end, systematic 
reconnaissance and detailed geological mapping is suggested over the claim area.  Any altered 
or mineralized rocks should be sampled during this work.  In addition, some 200 soil samples are 
suggested to be run in ten lines perpendicular to the La Lamosa mineralization with the aim of 
locating extensions of the mineralized zone.   
 
Recommended budget totals $600,000 and is detailed in Table 9 below.  Proposed Drill sections 
are included in Appendix I
