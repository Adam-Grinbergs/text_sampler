1 Summary 

1.1 Introduction 

Golden Arrow commissioned independent consultants Bruce Davis, Ph.D., F.AusIMM of BD Resource 

Consulting Inc. and Kyle Howie, B.Sc. (Tech), MAIG, and consultant Bruce Smith, MSc, Chartered 

Professional Geologist, MAusIMM, to provide an updated mineral resource estimate for the Chinchillas 

Project.  Dr. Davis, Mr. Howie and Mr. Smith are qualified persons ("QP's") within the meaning of 

Canadian Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 

Projects ("NI 43-101") and Form 43-101F.     

The purpose of this technical report is to support the mineral resource estimate released August 29
th
, 

2014 in accordance with the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101. This report updates and 

supersedes the previous mineral resource estimate (Davis and Howie, 2013) based on additional data 

from the 2014 Phase III drill program.  

1.2 Property Description and Location 

The Chinchillas Project is located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in the province of Jujuy, 

department of Rinconada, approximately 280 kilometres from the provincial capital of San Salvador de 

Jujuy.   

The Project is composed of two contiguous claims, totaling 1160 hectares.   Golden Arrow is earning a 

100% interest in the claims by paying up to $1.866M in staged payments over four years, with a 

commitment for a $1.2M payment to the vendors upon the commencement of commercial production. 

1.3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

Access to the Chinchillas Project is by paved road to the town of Abra Pampa via National Route No. 9 

and then 66 kilometres west across public gravel roads, through the village of Santo Domingo. Santo 

Domingo is equipped with electricity, natural gas, and water services. Abra Pampa has a hospital, and, 

along with San Salvador, provides other supplies necessary for exploration.  

The topography of the Project area is large rounded hills surrounding an elliptical depression, with an 

altitude ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 masl. 

1.4 History 

The Chinchillas Project area was first prospected and mined in small scale in the eighteenth century by 

Jesuit missionaries, and in the late 1960's there was a period of small underground production by a local 

company, using adits and tunnels. In 1994, Aranlee Resources conducted surface sampling and drilled 

seven reverse circulation drill holes for a total of 780 metres.  Silex Argentina, a subsidiary of Apex Silver, 

acquired the property and began exploration in 2004.  Silex completed 2,220 metres of drilling in seven 

holes.  

In early 2011 Golden Arrow personnel identified the Chinchillas Project as a potential advanced-stage 

acquisition target. The Company completed an option agreement with the underlying landowners in 

August of the same year.   Exploration work commenced in the spring of 2012 following community 

relations meetings and approval of work permits. 

1.5 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

The Chinchillas silver-lead-zinc deposit is located in the Puna geological belt.  Stratigraphy in the belt 

includes metamorphosed Proterozoic sediments in the basement through Paleozoic marine back-arc 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 2 

sediments, to more recent volcanic sequences and continental sediments. The Puna is the most 

important terrane in Jujuy Province for mineral deposits, including: mesothermal quartz veins with native 

gold and base metals; polymetallic quartz-sulphide veins with base and precious metals; gold, tin and 

copper placer deposits; SEDEX deposits with lead-zinc-silver and; Bolivian-type tin-silver sulphide veins 

related to intrusive stocks.   

The Chinchillas deposit is located in a dacitic volcanic centre. The deposit formed at a dilational fault jog 

within a regional scale east-west trending fault structure where an explosive volcanic vent has cut through 

marine meta-sedimentary basement rocks.  The resulting topographic depression or diatreme volcanic 

throat is elliptical in shape, approximately two kilometres long by 1.6 kilometres wide, and infilled with 

pyroclastic rocks (breccias and tuffs). At the contact between pyroclastic volcanics and basement 

metasediments a wide zone of hydraulic fracturing and brecciation of the basement has formed.  Dacite 

dome lavas and subvolcanics intrude on the southern margin of the basin at the contact between 

metasediments and pyroclastics. 

The Chinchillas deposit has significant silver-lead-zinc mineralization in four main areas: the Silver 

Mantos and Mantos Basement zones in the west part of the project, and the Socavon del Diablo and 

Socavon Basement zones in the east part.  

The Silver Mantos zone is situated in the western third of the basin, covering an area of approximately 30 

hectares. Shallow disseminated silver mineralization occurs within clay altered pyroclastic breccias and 

tuffs. This is concentrated in layers or "mantos" that average greater than 20 metres in thickness and are 

situated between the surface and 200 metres depth. Recent drilling highlighted a significant new mantos 

zone at depth (165 to 195 metres) that remains largely unexplored and open to expansion. 

Located below the Silver Mantos, the Mantos Basement is hosted entirely within the basement pelites 

and sandstones and is comprised predominantly of breccias, crackle breccias with minor small veinlets, 

fracture filling and mineralized structures. Mineralization within the Mantos Basement is open to 

expansion at depth, and to the north, east, and west. 

The Socavon del Diablo zone is situated in the eastern third of the basin and defined by drilling over an 

area of approximately four hectares. Mineralization is generally lower in silver and higher in zinc, and is 

dominated by manto-style disseminated sulphides within favorable shallow dipping volcanic tuff horizons, 

and includes crosscutting structures, hydrothermal breccias, and minor disseminated, breccia and veinlet 

hosted mineralization with dacite sub-volcanics.  The Socavon zone is also open to expansion to the 

north and northwest. 

The Socavon Basement zone is currently defined by nine drill holes situated approximately 100 metres 

east of the main Socavon zone, in a mineralized corridor along the main east–west fault that controls the 

volcanic centre, and hosted in basement metasediments.  

1.6 Deposit Types 

The Chinchillas deposit is considered to be part of the Bolivian tin-silver-zinc belt that extends from the 

San Rafael tin-copper deposit in southern Peru into the Puna region of Jujuy.  Deposits with similar 

environments and styles of mineralization include  San Cristóbal, Potosí, Pulacayo and Pirquitas. 

These deposits are generally characterized by intrusion of dacite dome complexes with mineralization 

hosted in shears and breccias within the dacite domes and / or within shears and breccias within the host 

rocks.  More rarely, as in the case of Chinchillas and San Cristóbal, the deposits are disseminated flat 

lying manto bodies within sediments and pyroclastic rocks that are cut by the "feeder" shears. All the 

deposits are known to have large vertical extents.

1.7 Exploration 

Golden Arrow's surface exploration program in 2011 and 2012 included detailed mapping with a special 

emphasis on structures, rock chip sampling, trenching and talus sampling.  These programs identified the 

major structural zones, the strong east-west control on basin formation, and new mineralized targets 

areas.   These interpretations defined drill targets for the Phase I and Phase II drill programs.   In 2013 

the Company completed geophysical surveys (IP/Resistivity, CSAMT, Magnetics) and a re-interpretation 

of the 2008 IP as well as collected 453 soil samples and 174 rock chip samples in a surface exploration 

program.    The work resulted in the identification of new structural zones and areas of mineralization 

around the existing deposit, and the identification of a new target area to the south, called the South 

Dome.  Multiple drill targets were defined for the Phase III drill program in 2014. 

1.8 Drilling  

In 2007 and 2008, Silex Argentina S.A. drilled seven core holes for a total of 2,220 metres.  

Golden Arrow has completed three drilling programs.  The first drilling phase, conducted in May and June 

2012, included 27 drill holes for 3,224 metres of drilling.  The second, conducted between November 

2012 and February 2013, included 49 drill holes and 7,387 metres of drilling.  Between February 24th 

2014 and June 17 2014, Golden Arrow completed a Phase III drill program including 38 drill holes and 

8,985 metres.   

Golden Arrow supplied data for the resource estimate from 121 drill holes with a total of 16,193 samples. 

Nine drill holes were outside the main Chinchillas deposit and excluded from the resource modelling 

database. The data supplied also included historical drilling by Silex consisting of seven core drill holes 

comprising 1,577 samples. No other type of drilling or surface sampling was used in the resource 

estimate. 

1.9 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

All drilling was completed by professional drilling companies using standard industry methods.   

The database from Silex lacks results from several certified reference materials (CRMs or standards), but  

re-sampling work conducted by Golden Arrow validates the Silex data. The results have been 

incorporated into the resource database.  

Sample and assay procedures applied by Golden Arrow in the drilling program are consistent with 

generally accepted industry best practices. The statistical analysis of quality control data show good 

accuracy and precision with no significant contamination. It is the opinion of the authors that the data are 

suitable for the estimation of resources. 

1.10 Data Verification 

No material sample bias was identified by the QP's during the review of the drill data and assays. 

Observation of the drill core during the site visits and inspection and validation of the data collected 

convinced the QP's that the drill data are adequate for the estimation of inferred and indicated resources. 

1.11 Metallurgy 

A metallurgical test program was initiated in January 2013 and continued in stages, with the most recent 

work completed in July 2014.  The test work is undertaken by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd., 

Inspectorate Metallurgical Division, ("Inspectorate") of Richmond, B.C Canada, under the direction of Mr. 

John R. W. Fox, B.Sc., P.Eng. of Laurion Inc., independent consultant to the Company and a Qualified 

Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.  The most recent testing program included locked-cycle

The metallurgical test work program will continue as the project progresses, and in the future will include 

samples from the Socavon Basement. For the purposes of this resource estimate the metallurgical 

parameters and recoveries for the Socavon Basement are assumed to be the same as the Mantos 

Basement, based on similarities in geology and mineralization.    

1.12 Resource Estimate 

The August 28th, 2014 mineral resource estimate for the Chinchillas Project was prepared by Kyle Howie, 

MAIG, in consultation with Bruce Davis, FAusIMM of BD Resource Consulting Inc and Bruce Smith, 

MAusIMM. (See Table 1-2.)  The mineral resource estimate uses drill hole sample assay results and the 

interpretation of a geologic model that relates to the spatial distribution of silver in the deposit. 

Interpolation characteristics were defined based on the geology, drill hole spacing and geostatistical 

analysis of the data. Block grade estimates were done using Ordinary Kriging (OK) with a block size 

measuring 5 metres long, 5 metres wide and 5 metres high. Resources are classified initially based on 

geological interpretation, then further according to their proximity to sample data locations and are 

reported, as required under NI 43-101, according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources 

and Mineral Reserves. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources are uncertain in nature and 

there has been insufficient exploration to classify these inferred resources as indicated or measured, and 

it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured category.

2. Totals may not add correctly due to rounding 
3. A resource constraining shell was developed based on metal prices of US$35.00/ounce silver, 

US$2.00/pound zinc and US$2.00/pound lead.    Within that shell, the resource has been reported using a 
cut-off grade of 40 g/t Ag Eq.  The cut-off was determined using operating costs of US$16.00/tonne for 
processing, US$9.00/tonne for G&A (US$25.00/t total) with metal prices of US$22.00/oz silver, 
US$1.00/pound zinc and US$1.00/pound lead, and a process recovery of 90%, based on the 2014 
Preliminary Economic Assessment. (See reported filed on SEDAR dated January 20th, 2014 for details.)    
The pit slope used for the resource shell is 45 degrees. 

4. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 
estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

5. The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient 
exploration to classify these inferred resources as indicated or measured, and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured category. 

 

No environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant issues are 

known to the author that may currently affect the estimate of mineral resources. 

1.13 Economic Assessment 

On December 5th, 2013 Golden Arrow announced the results of a preliminary economic assessment 

("PEA") for the Chinchillas project to provide a baseline view of the economics of the project.  The full 

details are available in the technical report filed on SEDAR dated January 20
th
, 2014 (Kuchling et al, 

2014).  The PEA was based on the then current 2013 resource estimate filed on SEDAR on June 20th 

2013 (Davis and Howie, 2013).   The expanded resource estimate released on August 29th, 2014 and 

detailed in this report will be used, along with updated economic parameters, to provide an updated 

economic assessment in the future. 

1.14 Conclusions and Recommendations 

The estimated indicated resource for the Chinchillas deposit, using a cut-off grade of 40 g/t of equivalent 

silver, is 24.6 Mt with grades of 91 g/t silver, 0.65% lead, and 0.31% zinc. A further inferred resource of 

22.0 Mt with grades of 57 g/t silver, 0.61% lead, and 0.68% zinc has been estimated using the same cut-

off grade. There remains good potential to expand the current resource, and to define new resources 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 6 

throughout the property.  This expanded resource estimate and recent metallurgical testing warrants 

updating the existing PEA for the Chinchillas deposit. A further economic evaluation beyond a PEA level 

study, such as a Feasibility Study ("FS") or Pre-Feasibility Study ("PFS"), will require converting Inferred 

resources to the measured and/or indicated classification.  A further 15,000 metres of infill drilling is 

therefore recommended to convert the classification of resources.   In addition, in preparation for a 

Feasibility Study the authors recommend 5,000 metres of condemnation, metallurgical, geotechnical and 

hydrogeological drilling and additional detailed metallurgical testing.  The estimated budget for these 

items including the infill drill program is $6.3M.  Golden Arrow should also continue its social and 

environmental programs and initiate the mine permitting process.

2 Introduction 

2.1 Introduction and Terms of Reference 

Golden Arrow Resources Corporation ("Golden Arrow") is a Vancouver-based exploration company that 

trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol GRG.    The Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project 

("Chinchillas" or "the Project") in Jujuy Province, Argentina, is the flagship project for the Company.   

Golden Arrow is a member of the Grosso Group: a management company specialized in resource 

exploration in Argentina since 1993. 

Golden Arrow commissioned independent consultants Bruce Davis, Ph.D., F.AusIMM of BD Resource 

Consulting Inc. and Kyle Howie, B.Sc. (Tech), MAIG, and consultant Bruce Smith, MSc, Chartered 

Professional Geologist, MAusIMM, to provide an updated mineral resource estimate for the Chinchillas 

Project.  Dr. Davis, Mr. Howie and Mr. Smith are qualified persons within the meaning of Canadian 

Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 

43-101") and Form 43-101F.    The scope of work for the mineral resource estimate consisted of auditing 

the database, including aspects of data quality, review of the geologic model, development of a block 

model, and determination of reasonable prospects for economic viability of the available mineral 

resources in the Project, in accordance to the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and Petroleum 

standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves (CIM, 2010).  Dr. Davis conducted geostatistical analysis 

of the drill data and directed and validated the grade estimation in the block model. Mr Howie constructed 

the mineralization, block and resource models, and Mr. Smith provided the geological interpretation.  

The purpose of this technical report is to support the mineral resource estimate released August 29
th
, 

2014 in accordance with the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101. This report updates and 

supersedes the previous mineral resource estimate (Davis and Howie, 2013) based on additional data 

from the 2014 Phase III drill program.  

In January 2014 Golden Arrow filed a technical report in accordance with the guidelines of NI 43-101 to 

support a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") of the Chinchillas Project (Kuchling et al., 2014).  

The PEA report was based on the then current 2013 mineral resource estimate and will be updated in the 

future based on the August 29
th
, 2014 mineral resource estimate and updated economic factors.

4 Property Description and Location 

4.1 Location 

The Chinchillas Project is located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in the province of Jujuy, 

department of Rinconada, approximately 280 kilometres from the provincial capital of San Salvador de 

Jujuy.  The property is centred at approximately at 3,473,150E and 7,512,360N (Gauss Kruger, 

Argentina, Posgar Zone 3; 22⁰30′13″ S, 66°15′39″ W) at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 4,200 masl. 

 

Figure 4-1: Location of the Chinchillas Project and Other Projects and Mines in the District.  

The Chinchillas Project is located within the Bolivian tin-silver-zinc belt (Figure 4-1) which extends into 

northern Argentina. Similar projects in the district include Silver Standard Resources Inc.'s Mina Pirquitas, 

30 kilometres southwest of Chinchillas and the Sumitomo's San Cristobal Mine in Bolivia.  

4.2 Land Tenure 

4.2.1 Exploitation Concessions 

Exploitation concessions in Argentina are called "Minas". Minas are defined by the following categories: 

First Category Minas include substances such as gold, silver, platinum, iron, lead, copper, zinc, 

aluminium, lithium, potassium, etc. and Second Category Minas comprise substances such as precious 

stones in river beds, any metal not included in the first category and others.  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 11 

The Mina is comprised of one or more "pertenencias" which are units of mining properties. Pertenencias 

must be rectangular in shape. In disseminated deposits such as Chinchillas, the pertenencias can 

encompass up to 100 hectares. The mining property fee or "canon" for a Mina is ARS$800 per 

pertenencia per year.   

Individuals are entitled to explore for, exploit and dispose of Minas as owners by means of a legal licence 

or legal concession granted by the competent authority under the provisions of the Argentine Mining 

Code. The legal concessions granted for the exploitation of Minas are valid for an undetermined period of 

time, and are considered "real property" giving the concessionaire the right to recover metals from the 

subsurface vertically underneath the concession, provided that the title holder complies with the 

obligations set out in the Argentine Mining Code. 

The Chinchillas Project consists of two contiguous First Category Minas that cover an area of 

approximately 1160 hectares (See Figure 4-2): 

Table 4-1:  Chinchillas exploitation concessions 

Concession File No Area (hectares) 

Chinchilla 469-M-56 329 

Chinchilla I 079-D-96 830.98 

 

The Chinchilla Mina is broken down into four pertenencias, while the Chinchilla I Mina has 9 

pertenencias. Both Minas are valid and in good standing.   

4.2.2 Option Agreement 

The two Minas are 100% owned by the Daroca family (the "`Vendors") and are subject to an 

Option-to-Purchase Agreement dated July 21, 2011 between the Vendors and the Company's subsidiary, 

Valle del Cura S.A. ("VDC")  Pursuant to the terms of the Option-to-Purchase Agreement and its 

amendment signed in July 2014, Golden Arrow has made option payments as follows:

Total $1,866,000  

 

(*)An amendment to the original Option Agreement was signed on July 11, 2014 whereby the 3rd 

anniversary payment originally scheduled at US$400,000 due July 2014 would be paid over 12 months 

instead of on the anniversary date.  The conditions of the Amendment Agreement include a US$150,000 

payment upon signing, a final payment of US$250,000 due by the end of 12 months, and on the 21st day 

of each month subsequent to the signing an additional payment of US$6,000 is due, for a new maximum 

total 3rd anniversary payment of US$466,000. The Company can at any time make the final payment of 

US$250,000 without penalty, thereby cancelling all further US$6,000 monthly payments.

4.3 Permitting 

Government permits required to conduct exploration and drilling on the Chinchillas Property have been 

obtained. (For additional details please refer to section 20.1.1.) 

4.4 Environmental liabilities 

Prior to initiating work on the Chinchilla Mina, an inspection was performed by the mining and 

environmental authorities regarding potential pre-existing environmental liabilities. There are remnants of 

historic mining activities in the Project area, such as small buildings, small areas of workings excavated in 

the 1960`s, historic drilling platforms, trenches and holes. All of these liabilities were declared as pre-

existing in the Company`s EIA report for the Chinchilla Mina, there were no findings and/or requests by 

the environmental authorities, and the Chinchilla EIA report was approved.   

4.5 Factors and risks 

To the extent known, there are no additional factors or risks that may affect the access, title, right or

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

The Chinchillas Project is accessed primarily by National Route No. 9 from the provincial capital of San 

Salvador de Jujuy, northwards along the Humahuaca River to the town of Abra Pampa. The route 

continues along Provincial Route No. 7 westward for 66 kilometres, through the village of Santo Domingo. 

The roads are maintained by the Province and are accessible year round. Several temporary rivers cross 

the route so four wheel drive vehicles are recommended in the rainy season. 

A second route to the Project is more appropriate for heavy transport vehicles, and is used by traffic to 

the Pirquitas mine situated 30 kilometres to the southwest of Chinchillas. This route follows National 

Route No. 9 northwards from San Salvador de Jujuy to Purmamarca, then turns northwest on paved road 

No. 52 to the town of Susques. From there, National Route No. 40 heads to Provincial Route No. 70 that 

leads to the Project at the Fundiciones mountain pass (Figure 5-1). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure 5-1: Location Map with Access Routes to the Project Area. 

5.1 Physiography, Climate and Vegetation 
 

The Chinchillas Project area has an elliptical, caldera-like shape with steep rolling hills surrounding the 

caldera depression. It is located near the Fundiciones mountain pass, with the Rinconada and Carahuasi 

ranges extending from north to south. Elevations range from about 4,000 to 4,200 masl. The highest 

elevation in the area is Cerro Granada (5,696 masl) 28 kilometres to the southwest. 

The climate is arid to semi-arid, tropical-subtropical influenced by high desert (Blasco, 2011). Rain is 

scarce and mainly occurs during the rainy season (November – March), with a mean precipitation of 300 

millimetres per annum. The annual mean temperature is 18°C, however during the winter it ranges 

from -7.7 ºC to 7.5 ºC. Dry and windy conditions often prevail in the area. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project

The Uquillayoc river runs through the Project area, and is fed by many tributaries. Water volume in the 

Uquillayoc is sufficient to be the main source of water for the village of Santo Domingo (Blasco, 2011). 

Vegetation  is  patchy  to  sparse  and  consists  of  xerophilous  and  steppe  bushes  like  iro  (Festuca 

ortophylia), and coirón (Stipachrysophylla). Acantoliphia haustata is the predominant species with the 

Yareta (Azorella compacta), less frequent. The tola (Parastrepia ssp) and small trees like the queñoa 

(Polylepis tomentella) can be found in depressions (Blasco, 2011). 

Animal species found in the area include mammals such as llamas, puna foxes and vizcachas, as well as 

several mice species, chinchillas and ferrets. Other fauna in the area include lizards, and birds such as 

small rheas, owls, ducks, condors and falcons (Blasco, 2011). 

5.2 Local resources and infrastructure 

Chinchillas is located in the rural zone of Rinconada department. Rinconada has an approximate 

population of 2,500 people. It covers an area of 6,407 square kilometres and has basic public services 

including a police department and health center. The main communities in the department are: Pan de 

Azúcar, Nuevo Pirquitas, Antiguyo, Carahuasi, Casa Colorada, Casti, Ciénaga Grande, Cincel, Rosario 

de Coyaguayma, Esquina Blanca, Laguna Larga, Lagunillas de Pozuelos, Lagunita, Loma Blanca, 

Orosmayo, Liviara, Tiomayo, Ojo de Agua, Pozuelos, Ramadas, Santo Domingo, Uquillayoc and 

Vizcachayoc (Blasco, 2011). 

Golden Arrow's exploration camp is located in the village of Santo Domingo, at an elevation of 4,000 

masl. Santo Domingo is a small community with a school, church, bus transportation, electricity, natural 

gas and water services. Most people in the village are ranchers (sheep and llamas) while others work in 

larger towns like Abra Pampa or Rinconada.  During exploration work periods supplies are obtained from 

Abra Pampa and San Salvador de Jujuy. 

Golden Arrow has invested in building enhancements, and has installed two gas tanks to supply natural 

gas in the village. Health care services are available in Orosmayo or Rinconada, both 30 kilometers 

away. The nearest hospital is located in Abra Pampa, 66 kilometres away. 

Field infrastructure at the Project includes two office containers, a core logging facility, a core cutting 

machine, two storage tents, two cisterns for diesel, ( 7,000 and 10,000 litres) and three warehouses of 144 

square metres each, for the storage of the core boxes, including a bathroom for personnel.  Electricity is 

provided by a 46kva diesel generator. Water supply for domestic and human consumption comes from 

public service and mineral water purchases.

6 History 

Chinchillas was first prospected and mined in small scale in the eighteenth century by Jesuit 

missionaries.  Relicts of ancient furnaces used to melt lead and silver can still be found at the Project 

area (Kulemeyer, 2011). In 1956 Mr. Antonio Mercado requested a concession based on the discovery of 

galena veins in the basement rock. Later in 1968, he sold the mine to the Ing Pichetti who later formed 

the Sociedad Pirquihuasi Company together with the Pirquitas Company, opening some adits and tunnels 

for small production. In 1982 the mine license expired and the mine was acquired by Shell CAPSA S.A. 

From December 1982 to 1989 consulting geologist for Shell, Jorge Daroca carried out some exploration 

work and after Shell dropped the property, Mr. Daroca requested it for himself, convinced of the good 

potential of the area.Roads, remnants of infrastructure, and minor underground workings remain from this 

activity but no records of this work are available. 

In 1994, Aranlee Resources conducted surface sampling and drilled seven reverse circulation drill holes 

for a total of 780 metres. Assay results from this work are available, but there are no samples for 

re-analysis or quality control information, therefore the data have not been incorporated into the resource 

estimate. Locations of drill holes are shown in Figure 10-1. 

In 2004, Silex Argentina, a subsidiary of Apex Silver, conducted preliminary reconnaissance work 

including trenching, pitting and surface sampling, with a total of 165 samples taken.  Between October 

2007  and  July  2008,  40  manual  pits  and  nine  trenches  were  sampled.  Surface mapping was 

also completed at different scales across the Chinchillas property. A total of 1,036 surface samples 

were collected by Silex before drilling 2,220 metres in seven drill holes (Figure 10-1). Drill hole samples 

were taken at one or two metre intervals. Drill hole locations and a summary of intercepts are available 

in Appendix I. Silex had planned to drill 22 holes but cut the program short during the 2008-2009 

financial crisis. In early 2009 Apex entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and with a payment due 

on the property, opted to drop Chinchillas in favor of its more advanced El Quevar project. The core 

from the Silex drill program remains at Chinchillas (Caranza and Carlson, 2012). 

At the beginning of 2008, Quantec Geoscience Argentina S.A. ("Quantec") performed a 16 kilometre IP 

resistivity survey, comprising nine sections. The pole-dipole interval was 50 metres with 300 metres depth 

readings (Figure 6-1). The objective of the program was to detect and delineate sulphides related to an 

intermediate to high-sulphidation epithermal system. The data were presented as pseudo-sections and 

2D inversions of apparent resistivity and chargeability, with 2D level plan maps from 3900m to 4250m 

(Quantec, 2008). The mineralized zones at Chinchillas do not appear to be related to chargeability, and to 

date the IP data have been of limited use. However there is a strong resistivity contrast between volcanic 

units and basement schists and resistivity data have been an effective tool for imaging the volcanic 

diatreme shape (Figure 6-2).

In early 2011 Golden Arrow personnel identified the Chinchillas Project as a potential advanced-stage 

acquisition target. Following a property tour and a review of existing data, the Company completed an 

option  agreement  with  the  underlying  land  owners  in  August  of  the  same  year. Golden Arrow 

subsequently initiated community relations meetings with the local communities at Santo Domingo, 

Livaria, and Rinconada as well as with the individual land owners, and submitted a new environmental 

impact  statement  for  exploration  drilling.  The  Government  of  Jujuy  convened  meetings  of  the 

Environment  and  Mining  Provincial  Committee  ("La  Unidad  de  Gestión  Ambiental  Provincial"  or 

"UGAMP") to approve the environmental impact statement and work plans (see Chapter 20 for additional 

information). At the UGAMP meeting, all environmental, community, political and mining representatives 

agreed to Golden Arrow's exploration plan. The plan was approved in March 2012 for a period of two 

years, and exploration work commenced.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 

The Chinchillas silver-lead-zinc deposit is located in the north-northeast to south-southwest trending Puna 

geological belt in the western half of Jujuy province (Figure 7.1). 

 

Figure 7-1: Jujuy Regional Geology Map with Geologic Terranes by Age, and Location of the 

Chinchillas Project. 

The elevation of the Puna ranges from 3,900 to 6,700 masl.   Basement rocks include Proterozoic 

sediments exhibiting medium to low grade metamorphism.  A series of units overlies the basement 

unconformably, including Paleozoic (Acoite Formation) marine sediments deposited in an early to middle 

Ordivician back arc basin, overlain by Silurian to Devonian sediments (Ramos, 2000; in Board et al., 

2011). The Puna was subjected to compressive events in the Late Ordovician to Early Devonian and the 

Paleogene.   However, by the late Miocene a basin and range geomorphology had developed. This 

resulted in the development of andesitic to dacitic stratovolcanoes and large caldera structures with 

associated extensive ignimbrites. (Soler et al., 2007; in Board et al., 2011). This volcanic activity and its 

associated mineral deposits, was concentrated along certain corridors defined by lineaments such as 

Coranzuli-Lipez, El Toro-Olacapato and Arizaro (See Figure 7-2) (Ramos, 1999, Coira et al., 2004, 

Gorustovich, 2011).  

In recent times, geological activity in the Puna belt has included basaltic volcanism, continental 

sedimentation and the creation of salt flats, or salars. The Puna is the most important terrane in Jujuy

Province for mineral deposits, including: lithium and borate salar deposits; mesothermal quartz veins with 

native gold and base metals; polymetallic quartz-sulphide veins with base and precious metals; gold, tin 

and copper placer deposits; SEDEX deposits with lead-zinc-silver and Bolivian-type tin-silver sulphide 

veins related to intrusive stocks. (Board et al., 2011)

and Modified from Gorustovich S., et al., 2011). 

7.2 District Geology 

The Chinchillas deposit is located in the southern part of the Rinconada Range (Figure 7-3). The range 

has a regional north-northeast to south-southwest trend and is delimited by thrust faults to the west and 

east. Various Miocene age volcanic dome complexes with associated hydrothermal alteration exist in the 

area, including Cerro Redondo, Pan de Azucar, Rachaite, and the Chinchillas dome complex. High angle 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 21 

faulting and folding also characterize the area. Chinchillas is located within a structural window, at the 

intersection of northwest fracturing associated with the Lipez-Coranzuli regional lineament and east-west 

controlling structure and lesser northeast trending structures. 

The Chinchillas deposit is hosted by the Ordovician Acoite Formation, described in Board et.al., (2011), 

as a strongly folded package of low-grade metamorphosed marine sandstone, siltstone and minor shale 

beds. Deformation and folding of these sediments occurred during the Ocloyic Phase (Coira, B. et al., 

2004) of late the Ordovician and they are overlain by Cretaceous marine clastic sediments through a 

major unconformity.  These sediments are then overlain by Oligocene to middle Miocene volcanic, 

continental sedimentary and volcaniclastic lithologies.

Deposit.  (Main structures and trends are also shown.) (Taken and modified from Caffe 2002)

7.3 Property Geology 
 

The Chinchillas deposit is located in a dacitic volcanic centre with an age of 13±1 Ma (Caffe and 

Coira, 2008). The deposit formed at a dilational fault jog within a regional scale east-west trending 

fault structure. At this jog an explosive volcanic vent has cut through marine meta-sedimentary 

Ordovician basement rocks.  The resulting topographic depression or diatreme volcanic throat is elliptical 

in shape, approximately two kilometres long by 1.6 kilometres wide, and infilled with pyroclastic rocks 

(breccias a n d  tuffs). At the contact between pyroclastic volcanics and basement metasediments a 

wide zone of hydraulic fracturing and brecciation of the basement has formed.  Dacite dome lavas and 

subvolcanics intrude on the southern margin of the basin at the contact between metasediments and 

pyroclastics (Figures 7-4 and 7-5).

sedimentary basement rocks, the volcaniclastic sequence infilling the depression, and the dacite 

domes flanking the southern border of the deposit.)

Projected to Surface. 

7.3.1 Marine Sedimentary Basement Sequence 
 

The Chinchillas basin basement lithology (Figures 7-6 and 7-7) is composed of a succession of 

interbedded layers of fine-grained marine sandstones and pelites with minor layers of carbonaceous 

shale. The formation has a low grade of metamorphism and is faulted with local folding. This 

sedimentary sequence corresponds to the Acoite Formation, of Ordovician age. Adjacent to the margins 

of the contact, between the basement sediments and overlying volcanic rock, the basement sediments 

are often intensely fractured and brecciated for thicknesses of up to 150 metres. These breccias are the 

main host of basement mineralization. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 24 

The same basement sequence is found in the South Dome area, up to 1.5 kilometres south of the 

Socavon and Silver Mantos areas, and also hosts mineralization (Figure 7-5).

Figure 7-7: Brecciated Basement Sediments with Fine Volcanic Matrix near Contact Between 

Pyroclastic Sequence and Basement Sediments. 

7.3.2 Pyroclastic  Breccias and Tuffs 

The pyroclastic breccias and tuffs erupted from the volcanic centre and filled in the resulting depression, 

contouring the vent walls.   This most likely occurred via airfall deposition as there is no observed 

evidence for water-lain deposits or sediments. The pyroclastic breccias and tuffs are generally similar in 

composition and vary mainly in clast size and the ratio of matrix to volcanic and basement clasts. 

Contacts between flows are subtle with often just a change in clast size as evidence. The pyroclastics 

mantle the topography, infilling the basin and dipping moderately towards the centre. Contacts between 

the underlying basement sediments and breccias are sharp.   The breccias and tuffs are mainly matrix-

supported but sometimes clast-supported. The clasts are sub-rounded to angular and vary from fine 

grained to large metre-scale blocks. The clast compositions are predominantly re-worked pyroclastic tuffs, 

lava fragments, and intrusive fragments of dacitic composition, with lithoclasts of sedimentary basement 

pelite or sandstone. Most of the volcanic clasts and matrix are altered by intense hydrothermal activity, 

whereas the sedimentary basement clasts are generally better preserved (Figure 7-8).

Figure 7-8: Typical Chinchillas Medium Grained Pyroclastic Breccia with Dacitic Volcanic Clasts 

Dominant and Secondary Dark Grey Clasts of Basement Sandstone and Pelite. 

In some surface outcrops   and drill holes, particularly at Socavon del Diablo, a characteristic coarse 

grained clast-supported breccia is observed (Figure 7-9). Clast type and composition is similar to the 

rest of the pyroclastics within the basin, with dacitic volcanic fragments and lesser pelite and 

sandstone clasts. Clasts range from 2 to 40 centimetres in diameter. Within the matrix and between 

clasts there are often voids, large vugs and sulphide mineralization cementing the breccia. Previous 

companies focused on these breccias and authors have often interpreted them as hydrothermal 

explosion breccias (i.e. Caffe and Coira, 2008). These coarse clast-supported breccias are 

volumetrically minor within the project areas and do not form large volumes of the mineralized bodies 

defined to date. An alternative interpretation is that these breccias are not of hydrothermal origin, rather 

just a coarse-grained pyroclastic breccia, possibly originating near vents within the basin. 

In the South Dome area (Figure 7-10), recent drilling confirmed the presence of argillic altered tuffs and 

breccias sub-outcropping or covered by recent sediments. These tuffs, located outside the main basin of 

Chinchillas, may be related to an additional volcanic center. To the east of the dacite domes, unaltered 

biotitic tuffs outcrop.

below thin cover gravels. 

7.3.3 Dacite Domes 
 

Three main dacite domes outcrop along the southeast edge of the Chinchillas basin between the 

pyroclastic breccias and basement contact. The domes have a medium to fine grained porphyrytic texture 

with phenocrysts of quartz (35 to 45 percent) plagioclase, biotite and minor sanidine (Caffe and Coira, 

2008). The dacite domes are generally massive in texture with limited flow banding and some flow 

brecciation along the margins. Drilling confirms that the dacite outcrops are part of larger bodies located 

below the Socavon del Diablo area. At surface they lie horizontally above tuff breccias (Figure 7-11).

7.4 Alteration 

Typical hydrothermal alteration is described below separately for basement sedimentary sequences and 

pyroclastic volcanics and dacites. 

7.4.1 Alteration in the Marine Sedimentary Basement 

In the basement sedimentary sequence, mineralization is restricted to breccias, fracture filling, and 

veinlets with different frequency or intensity. Alteration of the host pelite or sandstone in general is weak, 

with limited disseminated pyrite and weak clay and chlorite alteration close to sheared structures, and 

oxides of iron and manganese sometimes observed on fractures. Most of the disseminated pyrite is 

syngenetic with the sediments. To date there has been no detailed petrographic studies completed on 

the basement and there may be micro-crystalline pervasive alteration that is not easily visible in hand 

specimen. 

7.4.2 Alteration in Pyroclastic Tuffs and Breccias 

The pyroclastic tuffs and breccias have undergone several different types of alteration, including:   

clay alteration, sericitization, silicification, and carbonate alteration mainly as siderite. The most 

extensive alteration is the clay alteration and this is a mixture of kaolinite and illite. There is also extensive 

fine grained silicification within the suite of rocks. The clay alteration, sericitization, and silicification are 

somewhat contemporaneous as they are observed to overprint each other, indicating that the 

alteration of these rocks was a prolonged and variable event, probably over a range of temperatures 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 30 

and depths. Carbonate alteration is locally pervasive and appears late in most thin sections studied. 

(Marshall and Mustard, 2012.). Plagioclasts are commonly replaced by siderite and illite (Caffe, 2013).  

7.4.3 Alteration in the Dacitic Domes 

The porphyritic dacites were hydrothermally altered to sericite and siderite with minor silicification. 

Alteration is more developed in the matrix and in the plagioclasts (Caffe, 2013). 

7.5 Mineralization 

Mineralization at Chinchillas is dominated by silver with lesser amounts of lead and zinc. 

Mineralization occurs as disseminated sulphides and matrix infilling within the volcanic tuffs and as 

matrix and fracture filling in breccias within the basement meta-sediments. There are rarely mineralized 

shears, veinlets or vein-like structures within the dacites and volcanics. Within the basement lithologies 

shears and structures are more commonly mineralized. Depth of oxidation is just a few metres within the 

volcanics and is insignificant within the basement rocks. Silver, lead and zinc bearing minerals present 

include silver sulfosalts, freibergite, boulangerite, tetrahedrite, schalenblende, sphalerite, (zinc and 

iron), and galena (including argentiferous). Associated mineral assemblages include chalcopyrite, 

quartz, pyrite, siderite, limonites, manganese oxides, cerusite, smithsonite, anglesite and malaquite 

(Marshall and Mustard, 2012 and Coira et al., 1993). 

7.5.1 Main Mineralized Zones 

The resource model for the Chinchillas deposit, as defined to date, includes significant silver-lead-

zinc mineralization in four main areas: the Silver Mantos and Mantos Basement zones in the west part of 

the project, and the Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement zones in the east part (Figure 7-12). The 

main structural elements controlling the location of mineralization are: the inverted cone shape of the 

volcanic diatreme forming the contact between basement sediments and overlying volcanic rocks; and 

the dominant east-west and subordinate north and north-northeast trending structures that control 

formation of the Chinchillas volcanic centre (Figure 7-5). 

 

Figure 7-12: Typical West to East Cross Section of Chinchillas Showing Relations Between 

Mineralized Zones and Dacite 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 31 

7.5.1.1 Silver Mantos  

Located in the upper part of the western area of the deposit, the Silver Mantos zone comprises an area of 

approximately 30 hectares (700 metres by 450 metres) and is currently defined by 68 drill holes, with drill 

hole spacing between 50 and 100 metres (Figure 7-13).  Phase III drilling expanded the resource area to 

the north across the creek that runs west-northwest to east-southeast.  

 

Figure 7-13: Silver Mantos and Mantos Basement Zones with Drill Hole Locations and Mineralized 

Zones Projected to Surface. 

Mineralization is disseminated in several shallow (± 5
0
) dipping layers hosted within clay altered 

pyroclastic tuffs and breccias (Figure 7-14). The mineralization occurs between surface and 200 metres 

depth and is open to expansion to the north and east. Recent drilling (CGA-96 and CGA-126) has 

highlighted the existence of a significant new mantos zone at depth (165 to 195 metres) that remains 

largely unexplored and open to significant expansion. The mantos range between 2 and 60 metres thick, 

averaging greater than 20 metres in thickness. 

Good continuity of the mantos mineralized layers is noted from hole to hole. Petrographic studies on 

samples from the Chinchillas Project area indicate that silver occurs mostly in silver sulphosalts, such as 

freibergite, boulangerite and tetrahedrite, which occur as black fine-grained and disseminated crystals 

with galena and sphalerite in the volcanic tuffs (Marshall and Mustard, 2012 and Ma and Redfearn, 

2014). Sulphide mineralization is also occasionally noted as matrix infill of breccia structures and open 

spaces in coarser tuffs.  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 32 

The geometry of the Silver Mantos (near surface and shallow dip towards the center of the basin) is 

thought to be controlled by the paleo-water table, where mineralizing fluids or gases have percolated up 

through the volcanic pile, and/or along the basement contact, and precipitated upon contact with surface 

waters whose geometry would have reflected the basin topography. In the Silver Mantos area it is 

thought that several main structures control the development of the Chinchillas volcanic centre and 

mineralization. The dominant east-west fault and subordinate north and north-northeast faults all 

intersect at depth and may be the conduits or primary feeder system for mineralization at Silver Mantos. 

 

Figure 7-14: Typical Silver Mantos and Socavon del Diablo Style Fine Grained Disseminated 

Sulphide Mineralization in the Pyroclastic Tuff. 

The Mantos Contact Zone described in previous technical reports (Davis and Howie 2013, Kuchling, et 

al., 2014) is now included in the Silver Mantos zone. Updated geological interpretation from the Phase III 

drill program suggests that the Contact Zone is a deeper mantos type zone with similar lithology and 

mineralization to the Silver Mantos. 

7.5.1.2 Mantos Basement 

Located below the Silver Mantos, the Mantos Basement comprises an area 320 metres wide and up to 

120 metres thick, with an average thickness of 80 metres, dipping from surface at approximately 40 

degrees to the north (Figure 7-13). The zone has been traced down dip approximately 600 metres 

however, 300 metres down dip the mineralized breccia becomes horizontal, at which point it is 100 

metres below surface. The Mantos Basement is hosted entirely within the basement pelites and 

sandstones and is comprised predominantly of breccias, crackle breccias with minor small veinlets, 

fracture filling and mineralized structures (Figure 7-15).  The Mantos Basement is currently defined by 30 

drill holes, with drill hole spacing ranging from 50 to 100 metres. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 33 

The mineralized breccias within the Mantos Basement are aligned with the contact between the 

basement pelite and sandstone units and the overlying pyroclastic breccias. The control on 

mineralization is thought to be a result of two complementary structural features. 

During the violent eruption and development of the volcanic center the basement rocks on the margins of 

the volcanic diatreme underwent a process of intense fracturing and brecciation.  This created space for 

mineralizing fluids to deposit silver-lead-zinc sulphides as infill and breccia cement during and post 

volcanism. 

The location of the Chinchillas volcanic center is coincident with major east–west and subordinate north- 

south and north-northeast secondary structures and it is likely that the development of the volcanism is 

controlled by these structures. These structures are thought to be "feeders" or mineralizing conduits. 

Where these structures intersect the breccia zones developed in the basement near to the volcanic 

diatreme, as in the area of the Mantos Basement, mineralization is preferentially deposited within the 

brecciated and fractured wall rocks. 

Mineralization within the Mantos Basement is open to expansion at depth, and to the north, east, and 

west.

7.5.1.3 Socavon del Diablo 

The Socavon del Diablo zone ("Socavon") is located in the eastern area of the deposit (Figure 7-16), 

where 31 drill holes have defined a mineralized area of approximately four hectares (280 metres by 175 

metres). Drill hole spacing ranges from 30 to 70 metres. Mineralization is dominated by manto-style 

disseminated sulphides within favorable shallow dipping volcanic tuff horizons but also includes 

crosscutting structures, hydrothermal breccias, and minor disseminated, breccia and veinlet hosted 

mineralization within dacite sub-volcanics (Figure 7-17). 

 

Figure 7-16: Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement Zones with Drill Hole Locations and 

Mineralized Zones Projected to Surface. 

Mineral occurrences, textures, alteration and ore types within the volcaniclastic lithologies are similar to 

those described for the Silver Mantos target (Section 7.5.1.1), but the mineralization is thought to be 

related to a different fluid event. There may have been a different vent source within the volcanic 

centre as the Socavon del Diablo mineralization is generally lower in silver and higher in zinc content. 

The mineralization at Socavon is apparently controlled by the intersection of the major basin-forming 

east-west fault and cross-cutting north trending subordinate structure. At this junction old workings, 

including a tunnel and surface cut, exposed a small face of coarse, vuggy breccia with clasts up to 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 35 

a half metre in diameter cemented by silver-lead-zinc mineralized sulphides (Figure 7-9). This was 

typically interpreted by previous explorers as a hydrothermal breccia. Drilling has confirmed this breccia 

to be volumetrically small and it forms only a minor part of the Socavon mineralized area. The majority of 

the mineralization occurs as disseminated sulphides within pyroclastic tuffs similar to the Silver Mantos. 

The shape of the greater mineralization at Socavon is an inverted cone structure which is probably 

controlled by intersecting faults allowing upward percolating fluids to contact the surface water table.  

The Socavon zone is also open to expansion to the north and northwest. 

Figure 7-17: Galena-Ag veinlets in Dacite  

7.5.1.4 Socavon Basement 

The Socavon Basement zone is currently defined by nine drill holes (CGA-28, -29, -71, -85, 98, 13, 75, 

107 and 115) situated in a mineralized corridor along the main east–west fault that controls the volcanic 

center, 107 metres east of the main Socavon zone (Figure 7-16). The east-west fault and associated 

mineralization are near vertical and hosted in basement metasediments. Additional drilling is required to 

further understand the shape and origin of this block, to connect this fault corridor and the main Socavon 

zone and to expand the resource along strike and at depth.  

7.5.2 South Dome Area 

The South Dome area is located immediately south of the outcropping dacite domes in an area of 1.2 by 

1.2 kilometres (Figure 7-5). Magnetic, IP/Resistivity and CSMAT geophysical surveys carried out during 

2013, plus detailed geological mapping, defined a series of targets that were tested with nine core holes 

in the Phase III drill program. This drilling encountered wide zones of low grade silver-zinc-lead 

mineralization. The current resource estimate does not include any of the drilling in South Dome area. 

Mineralization is open in all directions and additional drilling is required. This area represents an 

important target for future exploration.  

7.5.2.1 Mn Breccia Target 

Within the South Dome area, the "Mn Breccia" target (Figure 7-18) was tested by three holes. It is a 

breccia outcropping over an area 600 by 300 metres with a distinct triangular shape. The clasts in the 

breccia are fragments of pelites and sandstones from  the basement with manganese-iron oxides filling 

open spaces and coating the clasts. The limited drilling on this target intersected mineralization over a 

wide zone, including 84 metres averaging 26 g/t silver and 0.7 % zinc in hole CGA-124,  and 15 metres 

averaging 181 g/t silver and 1.1 % lead in hole CGA-113.

7.5.2.2 Pascua Target 

The Pascua target (Figure 7-18) is located 1.2 kilometres south of Socavon del Diablo and was 

delineated based on large geophysical anomalies with no detectable surface expression. In each of four 

holes in this area, low grade mineralization was encountered throughout the brecciated basement rocks, 

including prolific microveinlets of sphalerite, galena and siderite in each hole. These basement rocks are 

partially covered by pyroclastic tuff breccias. Outcrops of basement rocks on the south edge of this target 

show silver-lead-zinc mineralization in the form of sub parallel veinlets in a similar situation to the 

outcrops south of the Mantos Basement.  

7.5.2.3 Socavon Extension 

Mineralized argillic and brecciated tuffs in contact with the dacite domes to the south east represents only 

a thin unit of less than a few meters of thickness. Hole CGA-110 drilled in this area remained in basement 

material nearly its entire length, cutting 17 metres at 3.4% zinc and 0.5% lead starting at 218 metres 

(Figure 7-18). This could represent a deep extension of the Socavon del Diablo zone. 

 

Figure 7-18: South Dome area immediately south of the dacite domes.  

7.5.3 Resource Expansion and Other Target Areas 

Mineralization at Chinchillas in the Silver Mantos, Mantos Basement, Socavon Basement and 

Socavon del Diablo are still open to expansion, particularly the deeper zones of Silver Mantos in the east, 

Mantos Basement to the north and Socovon Basement. The South Dome area provides further potential to 

add significant resources to the project. Other targets with only a few drill holes provide significant scope 

for increasing the size of the resource, including: the northern slope of the basin; the area between the 

Silver Mantos and Socavon zones; and the dacite domes. Figure 7-19 below summarizes the main 

areas and targets for future drilling. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 37 

The rest of the area within the concessions remains untested, however it has the potential of being 

mineralized and could include additional future targets.

8 Deposit Types 

The Chinchillas deposit is considered to be part of the Bolivian tin-silver-zinc belt which occupies the 

back-arc portion of the central Andes and extends from the San Rafael tin-copper deposit in southern 

Peru to northern Argentina (Figure 8-1). The Bolivian tin-silver deposits are associated typically with 

felsic volcanic domes of broadly rhyodacitic composition (Cunningham et al., 1991). The Chinchillas 

deposit is modeled as a Tertiary aged diatreme volcanic center that has intruded the Paleozoic basement 

schists. The resulting depression, filled with volcanic breccias and tuffs is approximately 1.5 kilometres 

in diameter. Mineralization occurs within the basin, hosted in favorable volcanic tuff units, hydrothermal 

breccias and along faults and structural zones as well as on the margins of the basin within footwall 

schists and across the schist volcanic contacts. The mineralization occurs mostly as disseminations, 

veinlets and matrix filling (Figure 8-2). 

 

 

Figure 8-1: Bolivian Tin-Silver-Zinc Belt with Major Deposits 

The Chinchillas Project geology has some similarities to the San Cristóbal Mine in Bolivia where silver- 

zinc-lead is mined from an open pit with a similar dacite dome complex and mineralization disseminated 

in adjacent basin-filling sediments. The San Cristóbal mine has estimated reserves (June 30, 2011) of 

285 million tonnes, grading 1.41% zinc, 0.48% lead, and 53.0 g/t silver or 484 Moz of silver, 4 Mt zinc and 

1.3 Mt lead (www.minerasancristobal.com, September 2014).   Chinchillas has similarities to many other 

nearby Bolivian-type tin-silver-zinc deposits, namely: Potosí (Local co-operative miners and UNESCO 

mining world heritage site in Bolivia) and Pulacayo (27 Moz silver  Probable reserve; 

www.apogeesilver.com, October 2014) and Pirquitas (Silver Standard Resources Inc., 74 Moz Silver in 

Proven and Probable reserves; www.silverstandard.com, August 2014).  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 39 

 

Figure 8-2: Chinchillas Project Deposit Model (Not to Scale) 

These deposits are generally characterized by the intrusion of dacite dome complexes with 

mineralization hosted in shears and breccias within the dacite domes and / or within shears and breccias 

within the host rocks. More rarely, as in the case of Chinchillas and San Cristóbal, the deposits 

include disseminated mineralization in flat lying manto bodies within sediments and pyroclastic rocks. 

Each of the nearby deposits has some similar characteristics to Chinchillas, and several have mining 

histories spanning hundreds of years.  The  study  of  these  nearby  deposits  has  helped  in  the 

understanding of Chinchillas and forms the basis for continuing exploration (Figure 8-3). In particular, all 

the deposits are known to have large vertical extents, with both Potosí and Pulacayo mined over 1,000 

metres of vertical extent, implying that there could be potential for additional mineralization at depth at 

Chinchillas. At Pulacayo, Potosí and San Cristóbal, where associated domes are present there has been 

significant mineralization found within the domes. 

At Chinchillas the mineralization encountered in the basement Ordovician schist has similar 

characteristics to the Pirquitas style mineralization, where shears and breccias are hosted within the 

same regional Ordovician schist (Acoite Formation). This has provided a model for exploration of 

"Pirquitas" style feeder mineralization.

9 Exploration 

Exploration activities during 2011 and 2012 involved detailed mapping in areas of known surface 

mineralization with special emphasis on the structures to understand the controls of the mineralization 

(Figure 9-1). A total of 173 rock chip samples were collected at the Project. 

Figure 9-1: Chinchillas Geology and Structure 

Two trenches were completed at Chinchillas with an excavator. One was at the southern contact of Silver 

Mantos where five samples averaged 208 g/t silver over five metres (by hole CGA-33). The other 

trench was dug 120 metres east of hole CGA-31 (and north of the creek) at a small showing of a 

breccia with iron oxides. A breccia with a N20E strike assayed 178 g/t silver over 0.9 metres. It shows the 

presence of mineralization on the north side of the creek within volcanic rocks (Caranza and Carlson, 

2012). 

Talus sampling was carried out on the north margin of Uquillayoc River, on the west side of Labor 

Potrero, and on the south margin of the dacitic dome. Results on the north area showed anomalous 

values of silver, lead and zinc, later successfully intersected by drill holes CGA-59, CGA-75, CGA-107 

and CGA-115.  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 42 

The 2013 geophysical surveys (IP/Resistivity, CSAMT, Magnetics) together with the re-interpretation of 

the 2008 IP survey was useful for targeting the South Dome area. Detailed mapping is in process in this 

area, and together with 453 soil samples and 174 rock chip samples recently collected, will define the 

future drilling program in the area.  

Overall the rock chip samples, trench samples, talus samples and mapping were not designed to be 

representative of the deposit nor used in any resource calculation, rather the program was completed as 

an aid to target drilling. The main interpretations from this program and the resulting drill targets were: 

 Identification of north and northeast trending structural zones that aided the discovery of the 

feeder zones beneath Silver Mantos. 

 Identification of mineralization on the northern side of the basin, and targeting of drill holes to 

extend Silver Mantos to the north. 

 Identification of strong east-west control on the basin formation and the targeting of drill holes that 

defined the feeder zones for the Socavon del Diablos. 

 Identification of brecciation and stockworking in South Dome area with mineralization defined 

over wide intervals.

10 Drilling 

10.1 Summary 

Five drill programs have been completed on the Chinchillas property (Figure 10-1).  Aranlee Resources 

completed the first historical program in 1994, which included seven RC holes (CH1 to CH7). The results 

from these holes were not used in the current resource model as there is no quality control data. 

In 2007 and 2008, Silex Argentina S.A., a subsidiary of Apex Silver, drilled seven core holes (CHD-10 to 

CHD-16) for a total of 2,220 metres. 

In 2012, 2013 and 2014 Golden Arrow completed three drilling programs.  Phase I, conducted between 

May 2nd and June 26th 2012, included 27 drill holes for 3,224.5 metres of drilling (CGA-17 to CGA-43).  

Phase II, conducted between November 14th 2012 and February 27th 2013, included 49 drill holes and 

7,387.5 metres of drilling (CGA-44 to CGA-92). Phase III, conducted between February 24th 2014 and 

June 17th 2014, included 38 drill holes and 8,984.6 metres (CGA-93 to CGA-129).  

Golden Arrow supplied data from 121 HQ size core drill holes with a total of 16,193 samples and 21,706.6 

metres length. Nine drill holes with a total of 2675.5 metres were outside the area of interest and 

excluded from the resource modelling database. The data supplied included the historical drilling by Silex 

consisting of seven core drill holes comprising 1,577 samples from 2,220 metres total length. No other 

type of drilling or surface sampling was used in the resource estimate.  

Appendices I and II provide tables of the location and orientation of drill holes at the Chinchillas Project, 

for historic and Golden Arrow drilling, respectively. Figure 10-1 shows the location of drill holes. 

10.2 Silex Argentina S.A. Drilling 

In 2007 and 2008, Silex Argentina S.A. drilled seven core holes (CHD-10 to CHD-16) for a total of 2,220 

metres. Drill core was HQ3 size (6.11cm diameter). Silex conducted a basic QA/QC program including 

blank, duplicate and SRM samples. Golden Arrow re-surveyed all the Silex drill collars using a differential 

GPS.  The remaining half core was re-logged and quarter core re-sampled at intervals for additional 

quality control checks. The Silex drilling cut two target zones. Holes CHD-10 and CHD-12 cut mineralized 

Socavon del Diablo breccias.  Holes CHD-14, -15 and -16 targeted deep mineralization at the centre of 

the volcanic throat. The holes averaged 350 metres in length and were unsuccessful at locating 

significant deep mineralization, however holes CHD-15 and -16 did cut the Silver Mantos target at shallow 

depths (between 5 and 55m). These Silver Mantos intercepts were interpreted as narrow vertical 

structures.  Subsequent re-logging by Golden Arrow re-interpreted these intercepts as disseminated flat 

lying mineralization within pyroclastic breccias.

10.3 Golden Arrow Drilling 

10.3.1 Methodology 

Energold Argentina S.A. ("Energold") was the contract diamond driller for Golden Arrow throughout Phase 

I and II drilling.   All drill core was HQ diameter (6.35 centimetre) except for 21 holes, (CGA-44, 53, 55,57, 

59, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 77, 81, 82, 85, 87, 89 and 91) which were drilled with the S-3 rig 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 45 

with HQ diameter up to 150 metres deep and then reduced to NTW diameter (5.71 centimetre) until the 

end of the hole.  Phase III drilling was performed by Falcon Drilling Argentina using HQ3 (6.11 

centimetre) diameter except for hole CGA-127, which was reduced to NQ (4.76 centimetre) from 182 

metres to the end of the hole. The drill cores were extracted and placed in appropriate boxes marked with 

drill hole number and the depth in metres. The boxes were transported by trained personnel from Golden 

Arrow. Once the drilling of a hole was complete, the contractor performed the measurement of the 

deflection of the hole, using single shot reflex instruments at 50 metre intervals down the hole. Some of 

the shallow (less than 100 metres) vertical holes were not surveyed. Once finished (depth, azimuth, dip), 

the information was transferred to Golden Arrow geologists in digital format. Following completion, the drill 

pad was cleaned and a PVC tube was cemented at the drill collar with hole number, depth and azimuth 

inscribed on a metal ticket. 

The Golden Arrow drilling team followed a detailed written drilling and safety protocol for handling drill 

core (see Chapter 11). Once the core boxes reached the core shed, they were reviewed and organized. 

Measurements of recovery of every metre of the core and geotechnical measurements (fracture 

frequencies and RQD) were recorded. The core in the boxes was subsequently photographed. Select 

intervals were temporarily removed for measurement of specific gravity. Golden Arrow staff recorded 

geological descriptions and marked the samples at one metre intervals in mineralized zones and two 

metre intervals in areas with no expected mineralization. The core was split using an electric saw and 

sampled according to marked intervals. 

10.3.2 Program Details 

Golden Arrow's first drilling program, conducted between May 2nd and June 26th 2012, included 27 drill 

holes for 3,224.5 metres of drilling (CGA-17 to CGA-43). The program included one diamond drill core rig 

with the team working 24 hours in two shifts. 

The second drilling program, conducted between November 14th 2012 and February 27th 2013, included 

49 drill holes and 7,387.5 metres of drilling (CGA-44 to CGA-92). Hole CGA-51 had low recoveries within 

mineralized zones. Hole CGA-92 was re-drilled in the same location. The second phase drill program 

used two diamond drill core rigs with the team working 24 hours in two shifts. 

The third drilling program conducted in the first half of 2014 was performed with a track mounted drill rig. 

On hole CGA-96 the rods were trapped at 194.3 metres, ending in mineralization, and it was re-drilled at 

hole CGA-126. A similar situation occurred at hole CGA-112, which was re-drilled at hole CGA-112B.   

The average recovery from the 19,604.6 metres drilled was 93 percent, including the first six metres 

where recovery was commonly less than 50 percent. 

Appendix II includes summary tables of the mineralized intercepts from all drill programs.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

The following details the sample preparation, analysis and security details used by Golden Arrow in the 

Phase III drill campaign.  For details of methodologies used by Silex Argentina in the earlier drill 

campaign, the reader is referred to section 11.1 of the previous technical reports (Davis and Howie, 2013; 

Kuchling et al., 2014). 

11.1 Sampling Method and Approach 

For details of Golden Arrow drilling procedures please refer to Section 10.3.1.   Subsequent to drilling, 

the core was placed in wooden boxes and Golden Arrow´s technicians measured the recovery and RQD. 

A handheld XRF analyzer was used to measure approximate silver, lead and zinc values every metre. 

These results were useful to identify mineralized intervals and check subsequent assay values.  

All core in boxes was photographed and the specific gravity was measured every 10 to 20 metres (Section 

11.5). The core was logged and samples were marked with an interval of one metre in mineralized zones 

and two metres in areas with no expected mineralization. The entire hole was sampled and assayed. The 

core was marked and cut in half for sampling using a diamond saw. Half the core was returned to the box 

while the other half was bagged.  Corresponding tags were inserted, one in the plastic sample bag and the 

second in the wooden box. Quality control samples were inserted in sample bags and allocated in order 

for the laboratory to have a control sample in every batch.  

11.2 Sample Custody and Security 

Samples bags were placed in larger sacks (between six and ten samples per sack) and were sealed. 

Sealing numbers were recorded in the Chain of Custody database. The sacks were shipped by private 

truck to the Alex Stewart (Assayers) Argentina S.A. laboratory in Mendoza, ("Alex Stewart") where the 

sample preparation and analysis was performed.  

Samples were received by the laboratory and the reception was reported to Golden Arrow. No damage or 

missing samples were ever reported during transportation. 

11.3 Sample Preparation 

Samples were prepared by method P-5 which includes drying the samples at 90°C, crushing t h e  

entire sample up to 80 percent passing 10 mesh, splitting 1,000 grams with a Jones riffle splitter and 

pulverizing to 95 percent passing 140 mesh. The pulverized material or pulp was then sampled and 

200 grams of pulp was sent to the laboratory. 

11.4 Sample Analysis 

Alex Stewart was the primary laboratory and ALS in Peru ("ALS") was used as t h e  secondary 

laboratory (see Section 11.6.5 for details). All samples were tested for a suite of 39 elements 

including silver, lead and zinc by a four acid digestion method and analysis by ICP (method ICP-MA-39). 

Silver greater than 200 ppm was assayed by fire assay using a 50 gram sample with gravimetric finish 

(method Ag4A-50).  Lead and zinc greater than 10,000 ppm were re -assayed by an oxidizing acid 

digestion for ore grade material and reading by ICP (method ICP-ORE).  

Alex Stewart is an international laboratory certified under ISO 9001:2008, ISO 17025:2008 and ISO 

14001: 2004. 

11.5 Specific Gravity 

During the Phase III drill program, Golden Arrow collected 565 samples of core approximately ten 

centimeters long every 15 metres to determine specific gravity ("SG"). Samples were dried for two hours 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 47 

at 90°C in an electric oven. After cooling, the samples were sealed with a plastic film to cover the entire 

piece of core. The weight of the plastic was ignored in the calculations since the volume was 

insignificant (less than 1 gm of plastic film compared with the 900 gram average weight of each sample). 

The samples were weighed in air and then weighed in water while hanging from a frame. The results 

from 565 samples produced an average specific gravity of 2.38, but as expected, the SG values of the 

basement rocks and dacites (2.57 and 2.38 respectively) were considerably greater than the volcanic tuffs 

(2.06). The average of SG from samples collected from the Phase II drill program was 2.25. This is 

consistent with the fact that during Phase III more basement material was drilled and sampled. The formula 

applied for the calculation was: 

SG =   (Weight in air) / (Weight in water) 

The following graphic shows the specific gravity results of Phase III drilling. 

 

Figure 11-1: Specific Gravity results by Golden Arrow grouped by rock types 

The three highest SG values of tuffs correspond to deep intervals of tuffs in between basement rocks, 

probably volcanic vents as described in Chapter 7. In the case of the basement samples, there is no 

evident reason for the low SG values, but the two highest values have high galena content.     

11.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

The same Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) system established for the previous drilling 

phases was used in this third drilling phase. The system specifies the procedures for handling and 

sampling of the core, the logging, the QC samples to include in the batches and the procedure for the 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 48 

chain of custody.  QC samples, including blanks, duplicates, and certified reference materials (CRM's) 

were inserted in each batch in the field to check the precision and accuracy of the laboratory. 

A total of 1142 quality control samples were inserted as shown in Table 11-1.

11.6.1 Blanks 

Coarse and fine blanks were used to detect contamination problems and cross labeling in the process. 

The blank used was not a certified material from a vendor. It was made from a tuff breccia with no silver 

mineralization and low grade base metals values. It was sampled by Golden Arrow personnel and 

assayed by Alex Stewart Assayers showing the following grades:

GA67298 <0.5 42 200 

GA67299 <0.5 59 84 

AVERAGE <0.5 66 173 

 

An internal certificate was produced (BL-CH-1G) with these averages. The blank material used for QC 

purposes was not certified by a round robin process at several accredited laboratories; however, assay 

QC results indicate the material appears to be sufficiently homogeneous to detect sample contamination.  

The acceptance values were three times the reference value. In the case of the silver the acceptance 

value was three times the detection limit (1.5 ppm silver).  

The fine blanks were made from the fine rejects of coarse blanks of the previous drilling phase. The 

original assays were averaged and an internal report was produced (BL-CH-2F). Average values were: 

<0.5 ppm silver, 23 ppm lead and 69 ppm of zinc. The acceptance values were three times the reference 

value.  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 49 

During the present drilling phase, a total of 169 coarse blanks and 162 fine blanks were inserted in the 

batches as part of the QC program. Silver values on both coarse and fine blanks were below the limit of 

detection except for one sample of 0.6 ppm silver. Lead and zinc values were also below the acceptance 

limit except for one sample with 222 ppm lead in one coarse blank. 

 

Figure 11-2: Silver values in Coarse Blanks (BL-CH-1G) and Fine Blanks (BL-CH-2F) 

11.6.2 Field Duplicates 

Field duplicates were intended to check the homogeneity of the mineralization, the sampling error in the 

splitting and any cross labeling of samples. They were generated by cutting the samples in half, so the 

duplicate and its original each represent one quarter of the entire core. A total of 164 pairs of field 

duplicates were produced. 

The pairs with values close to the lower detection limit were removed due to the poor repeatability of 

results. The criterion applied was six times the lower detection limit, which corresponds to 3 ppm of 

silver, 12 ppm of lead and 6 ppm of zinc. The same criterion was applied for the coarse and fine 

duplicates and for the comparison between the primary and secondary laboratories. 

For the evaluation of the data, three types of graphics were produces: X/Y with the Coefficient of 

Determination R

The field duplicates from the Phase III drilling show a better correlation than from the previous Phase II 

drill program (Davis and Howie, 2013.). As shown in Table 11-3, the Coefficient of Determination (R
2
) 

improved for the silver and lead values. In this phase of drilling, the percentage of pairs with less than 

30% MPD increased from 69 to 75%. A similar improvement was seen for the lead and zinc assay results.

The reason for this improvement may be due to additional care while cutting the duplicates samples (one 

quarter of the core). Each quarter was systematically weighed to assure similar weight in both sub-

samples. 

A group of five pairs of field duplicate samples with a difference of more than thirty percent for one metal 

were re-assayed. Table 11-3 demonstrates that re-assays confirm the original values. The differences 

are, therefore, attributed to the variability of the mineralization.

11.6.3 Coarse and Fine Duplicates 

During the Phase III of drill program coarse and fine duplicates were incorporated in the quality control 

process. A total of 1.8% of the coarse rejects (at 10 mesh) were re-labeled with a new number, re-

assayed at Alex Stewart and considered as coarse duplicates. The same procedure was applied to the 

fine rejects (pulps) and these were considered as fine duplicates. Assay of the fine duplicates is not 

intended to validate the assay process since each part of the duplicate pair was assayed in the same lab. 

Figure 11-5 shows a summary of all three types of duplicates for the silver. Similar curves were produced 

for the lead and zinc.

Figure 11-5: Silver Values from Three Types of Duplicates 

11.6.4 Certified Reference Materials 

A set of Certified Reference Materials (CRM) was used to check the accuracy and precision of the 

laboratory. During Phase III, three reference materials were used: 1-CH, 2-CH and 3-CH. These were 

originally prepared by ACME-Mendoza at the request of Golden Arrow from rejects of previous drill 

core from the Chinchillas Project. The 1-CH and 2-CH standards have low and average silver grades 

and were packaged in 30 gm envelopes because they don't require fire assay. 3-CH with high silver 

content was packaged in 120 gm envelopes.  

The results of all silver standard assays fell within two standard deviations of the expected value 

except for one sample of STD-2CH (Figure 11-6). This sample fell over three standard deviations from 

the expected value. In this case, three samples from immediately prior to the standard in question and 

three samples immediately following the standard in the assay stream we re-analyzed. The assays from 

the six samples fell within 6% of the originals in all the cases and re-analysis of the standard fell within 

one standard deviation. Therefore, no remedial measures were applied to any surrounding sample 

results.

In the case of the lead and zinc, all the values fell within two standards deviations except for four cases 

on the 2-CH and one case on the 1-CH where values fell in the range between two and three standard 

deviations of lead (Figures 11-8 to 11-10). Re-analysis of the samples on either side of the subject 

samples fell within 7% of the original values in all cases.  

 

Figure 11-8: Lead values from Reference Materials 1-CH, 2-CH and 3-CH 

Lead values for 2-CH (lower grade) are more erratic but no bias is evident as shown in Table 11-4. ICP 

precision degrades at lower grades causing larger differences.  

Average zinc grade of 1-CH is slightly higher than the reference value, and the average for 2-CH is 

slightly lower than the reference value; however, the differences are not practically significant.

11.6.5 Secondary Laboratory for Checks 

ALS Peru was used as secondary laboratory. A total of 181 pulps were sent to ALS to be tested by 

method ME-ICP61 based on a four acid digestion and reading by ICP-OES. Samples greater than one 

percent lead or zinc were re-tested using ore grade method Pb-OG62 and Zn-OG62. Samples in the 

range of 100-1,500 ppm silver were re-assayed by ore grade method Ag-OG62 which used an Aqua 

Regia digestion and ICP or AAS analytical finish. Samples above 1,500 ppm silver were re-assayed by 

fire assay with gravimetric finish (method Ag-GRA21). ALS Peru is part of an international laboratory 

system and has ISO 9001:2008 and 17025:2005 certifications.  

As with the field/coarse/fine duplicates, the lab duplicate pairs with values close to the lower limit of 

detection were removed due to the poor precision of results, leaving only the greater than three ppm 

silver values.

Figue 11-11 shows the comparison for the silver-lead-zinc values. The comparison between the two 

laboratories shows an acceptable agreement between sample pairs.  

Additionally, 21 selected pulps were sent to SGS as a third laboratory for checks. Figure 11-12 shows 

agreement between Alex Stewart and SGS is acceptable and the original values of Alex Stewart are 

validated.

11.7 Conclusions and recommendations 

The authors believe that the database meets or exceeds industry standards for data quality and integrity. 

Further the authors believe the sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures are adequate to 

support resource estimation.

12 Data Verification 

12.1 Database Validation 

12.1.1 Collar Coordinate Validation 

Validation of collar elevation data was done by comparing elevations from Differential GPS ("DGPS") field 

surveys against the satellite photo digital elevation model ("DEM"). Precision of the DGPS is between 15 

and 70 centimetres. The GeoEye high resolution stereo ortho-rectified DEM purchased by GRG provided 

elevation values for comparison. Most elevation differences in the collars were less than one metre. The 

largest difference occurred for hole CGA-94, where the difference of 2.51 metres was due to the pad 

elevation being below the original topo surface.  

12.1.2 Down-Hole Survey Validation 

Before the beginning of Phase III drilling it was noted that the correction of the magnetic declination 

between true north and magnetic north was correct in angle but had the opposite direction. For this 

reason, all azimuths of drill holes of Phases I and II were corrected by 13 degrees counterclockwise.  

The down-hole survey data were validated by searching for large discrepancies between the dip and 

azimuth reading against the previous reading. No significant discrepancies were found.  

12.1.3 Assay Verification 

All the collars, surveys, geology and assays were exported from Micromine Geobank software into excel 

files and then into Leapfrog software. The validation process of Geobank confirms that each sample ID is 

associated with a drillhole, there are no identical sample ID's, all FROM_TO data are zero or positive and 

no interval can exceed the total depth of the hole. To validate the data, the following checks were 

confirmed: 

 The maximum depth of samples were checked against hole depth; 

 The values of less than the detection limit were converted into a positive number one-half the 

detection limit; 

 The highest silver values and at least one random value from each drill hole were checked 

against the original assay certificate 

 The units were converted from parts per million (ppm) into percent (%) for lead and zinc values 

Two methods of analysis were used for silver. Initially, samples were analysed using a four acid 

digestion followed by ICP-OES. Samples with silver values greater than 200 ppm were further analyzed 

by fire assay on a 50 gram sample charge with a gravimetric finish.   

Recoveries values on Phase III drilling averaged 95.7% for the mineralized intervals and 93.6% for 

the overall. There is no indication that grade is related to core recovery. 

Silex drillhole assay data were validated as reported in the previous Mineral Resource Estimate 

(Davis et al, 2013).  

12.2 QA/QC protocol 
 

A review of the QA/QC protocols was conducted prior to drilling and formalized in a detailed QA/QC 

manual developed by Golden Arrow. Onsite reviews were conducted during all the three drilling phases 

(years 2012, 2013 and 2014) by QP Bruce Smith. The procedures for core processing, the insertion of 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 59 

blanks and standards, and for the duplicate sampling regime were examined. The QA/QC program has 

been conducted in accordance with industry best practice as described in Section 11 of this report.  

12.3 Geological Data Verification and Interpretation 

While several geology variables were captured during core logging, only lithology was used to constrain 

the resource estimation. Therefore, geology data verification was limited to determining that the lithology 

designation was correct in each sample interval.  This included the following: 

 

 From – to intervals for gaps, overlaps and duplicated intervals; 

 Collar and sample id mismatches; 

 Correct geology codes. 

 

A geological legend was provided by Golden Arrow and compared to the values logged in the database. 

Data were loaded into the Leapfrog Geo® software and examined for discrepancies in logging. Errors 

were fixed after consultation with field geologists. 

Initial geological modelling was done in Leapfrog software by the field geologists in the exploration office 

and revised and updated by QP's Bruce Smith and Kyle Howie. The geological model is reasonable and 

adequate for use in the 2014 resource estimate. 

12.4 Conclusion 

No material sample bias was identified by the QPs during the review of the drill data and 

assays. Observation of the drill core during the site visits and inspection and validation of the data 

collected convinced the QP's that the drill data are adequate for the estimation of inferred and indicated 

resources.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

A metallurgical test program was initiated in January 2013 and continued in stages, with the most recent 

work completed in July 2014.  The test work is undertaken by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd,                                       

Inspectorate Metallurgical Division ("Inspectorate") of Richmond, B.C Canada, under the direction of Mr. 

John R. W. Fox, B.Sc., P.Eng. of Laurion Inc., independent consultant to the Company and a Qualified 

Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.  To date all testing has been bench-scale. Results from 

the early test work stages are summarized in the previous technical report (Kuchling et.al., 2014).   

The following is a summary of the most recent testing program, on composite samples from the Silver 

Mantos zone, ("MAN-2") the Socavon del Diablo Zone ("SOC-2") and the Mantos Basement zone ("BAS-

1"). This program included locked cycle testing, providing the most representative view of the overall 

metallurgical performance of the samples to date.  The following summary is excerpted from the final 

report titled "2014 Project Report on Metallurgical Testing on the Chinchillas Project" prepared by Bureau 

Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd,   Inspectorate Metallurgical Division (Chen and Redfearn, 2014):   

[Seven core] samples [received on October 15, 2013 weighing 102 kg] were air dried and 

separated into three composites.  Each composite was individually crushed to 6 mesh, mixed and 

split into the required samples for testing. Silver contents range from 94.2 to 150.6 g/tonne and 

base metals include lead and zinc. 

In this testing program, it was confirmed that Chinchillas samples are usually amenable to 

conventional lead and zinc flotation process. For most of the samples, the majority of Ag was 

recovered in Pb circuit. Overall Ag, Pb, and Zn recoveries are above 95%. Most products cleaned 

well. Upgrading of composites BAS-1, MAN-2, and SOC-2 generated Pb products with grades 

ranging from 65% to 79% Pb while Zn products graded 52 to 62%.  

Locked cycle tests on three samples (BAS-1, MAN-2, and SOC-2) proved that very high Ag and 

Pb recoveries in Pb circuit can be achieved along with good Pb grades. For composites BAS-1 

and SOC-2, good Zn concentrates grading 51.8% and 60.1% respectively were obtained. The 

overall metallurgical performance is summarized in the following table:

The metallurgical test work program will continue as the project progresses, and in the future will include 

samples from the Socavon Basement, which is a newly defined zone. For the purposes of this resource 

estimate the metallurgical parameters and recoveries for the Socavon Basement are assumed to be the 

same as the Mantos Basement, based on similarities in geology and mineralization.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 

14.1 Introduction 

This section presents a summary of the key database, statistical, geostatistical and block modeling 

parameters used in the generation of the August 29
th
 2014 Chinchillas Mineral Resources estimate. This 

resource estimate was generated using Leapfrog and Vulcan® ("Vulcan") software V9.0. 

14.2 Drill Hole Database Preparation 

Golden Arrow supplied data from 121 HQ size core drill holes with a total of 16,193 samples for a total 

length of 21,706.6 metres. Nine drill holes with a total of 2,675.5 metres length were outside the main 

Chinchillas deposit and excluded from the resource modelling database. The data supplied also included 

historical drilling by Silex consisting of seven core drill holes comprising 1,577 samples from 2,220 metres 

total length. No other type of drilling or surface sampling was used in the resource estimate.  

All drill hole data were supplied as Excel® spreadsheets by Golden Arrow. The spreadsheets were 

exported from a master Geobank® database and were then loaded into an Access® database for 

validation purposes. The files contained collar, assay, geology, down-hole survey and specific gravity 

data. The Access database was loaded to both Leapfrog and Vulcan software via ODBC. The data 

supplied were checked as described in Section 12. 

14.3 Domaining 

14.3.1 Geological Domains 

Golden Arrow supplied geological data in the form of down-hole logging, surface mapping and 

geophysical data as well as a sectional interpretation and initial 3D model of geology using drillhole and 

surface mapping data. These data were used to create three dimensional wireframes that were in turn 

used to code individual blocks within the block model. Leapfrog software was used to construct the 

geology domain wireframes. The drill hole data supplied contained more lithological detail than could be 

modeled so the data were grouped into three main geologic units: pyroclastic tuffs, basement and dacite. 

Only geological units within the extents of the block model were considered. 

The geology model consisted of a tuff-filled vent complex formed in a schist basement and later intruded 

by dacite domes as shown in Figure 14-1 to 14-3. The wireframes representing the three main geologic 

units were constructed and validated in Leapfrog and then exported into Vulcan to code the block model.

14.3.2 Mineral Zone Domains 

The block estimates were constrained using four distinct mineral domains: Silver Mantos, Mantos 

Basement, Socavon del Diablo ("Socavon") and Socavon Basement. The domain wireframes were 

generated in Leapfrog using an iterative approach to create coherent shapes representing the four 

domains. Mineral domains for silver, lead and zinc were created independently. It is important to note that 

the creation of the domains involved grade thresholds well below expected economic cut-off grades. The 

domains are shown in Figure 14-4 below, with additional representations in Figures 14-5 through 14-9.

Figure 14-5: Plan view showing Mineralized Zone Domains 

14.3.2.1 Silver Mantos Domain 

The Silver Mantos domain ("MT") is hosted entirely within the pyroclastic tuffs and breccias on the 

western side of the deposit (see examples in Figures 14-6 and 14-7). It does not extend beyond the 

margin of the vent. It is essentially disseminated mineralization with some fracture and void filling within 

the host rock, with no significant veining. It is modeled as a tabular series of interconnected discontinuous 

lenses. The domain also includes hanging wall mineralization on the contact between the tuffs and 

basement schist. This was modelled as a separate zone in the previous resource estimate (Davis and 

Howie, 2013) but is incorporated in the current estimate due to similar grade statistics and the same host 

lithology. While the domain is primarily based on the geology, a silver grade threshold of 10 ppm was 

employed to further constrain the ultimate domain shape. 

Separate domains were created for lead and zinc. Grade thresholds of 0.15% lead and 0.15% zinc were 

applied to the geology to restrict domain shapes for these metals.

NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 66 

 

Figure 14-6: Section Looking West Showing Silver Mantos Domain 

14.3.2.2 Mantos Basement Domain 

The Mantos Basement domain ("MB") is contained entirely within the basement metamorphosed pelites 

and sandstones on the western side of the deposit (see examples in Figures 14-6 and 14-7). 

Mineralization is hosted predominantly as fracture filling in crackle breccias, small veinlets and 

mineralized faults. It is hosted within the footwall of the tuff/basement contact. A structural trend similar to 

the 50 degree east dip of the tuff/basement contact is incorporated as the final element in the 

development of the MB domain. 

Separate domains were created for lead and zinc. Grade thresholds of 0.15% lead and 0.15% zinc were 

applied during the construction of the domains.

NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 67 

14.3.2.3 Socavon del Diablo Domain 

The Socavon del Diablo domain ("ST") lies on the eastern side of the Project area. It is hosted within the 

pyroclastic tuffs and breccias filling the vent and includes dacite in some areas (see example in Figure 

14-8). Vertical faulting is observed in the center of the zone associated with coarse breccias. The ST 

domain has more vertical continuity than other areas reflecting the stronger influence of vertical 

geological features in this area. ST is silver-poor and zinc-rich compared to the other domains.  

Therefore, a lower silver grade threshold of 5 ppm was applied to accommodate lower average silver 

grades. The same 0.15% lead and zinc thresholds were applied when developing the ST lead and zinc 

domains. 

 

Figure 14-8: Section Looking West Showing Socavon Domain 

14.3.2.4 Socavon Basement Domain 

The Socavon Basement domain ("SB") lies on the eastern side of the Project area. It is hosted entirely 

within the basement pelites and sandstone (see example in Figure 14-9). It is occurs within the footwall of 

the tuff/basement schist contact and has a strong linear control along the major east-west trending 

Chinchillas fault zone. Similar modelling methods were used and grade thresholds of 10ppm silver, 0.15% 

lead and 0.15% zinc were applied in the development of domains.

Figure 14-9: Section Looking West Showing Socavon Basement Domain 

14.4 Compositing 

The drill hole data were composited using Vulcan into nominal one metre lengths in order to standardize 

lengths and give the sample 3-D coordinates. A composite length of one metre was chosen as it is the 

most common sampling length used. Composites were coded by mineral zone domains for statistical and 

geostatistical analysis and for grade interpolation. Metals were composited independently by zone. No 

grade capping was applied prior to compositing.     

14.5 Statistical Data Analysis 

Boxplots in Figure 14-10 show that the frequency distributions of silver by mineral zones are similar 

except for the Socavon del Diablo domain where the grades tend to be lower. The lead and zinc domains 

(Figures 14-11 and 14-12) are slightly different from the silver domains. Lead domain distributions tend to 

be similar to the general silver shapes except the ST distribution is about the same as the SB. Zinc 

appears to increase slightly going from MT/MB to SB/ST with ST having the highest average grade in all 

four domains. The unit named "None" in the boxplots contains all composites outside any mineral domain.

14.6 Variography  

The degree of spatial variability and continuity in a mineral deposit depends on both the distance and 

direction between points of comparison. Typically, the variability between samples is proportionate to the 

distance between samples.  If the variability is related to the direction of comparison, then the deposit is 

said to exhibit anisotropic tendencies, which can be summarized by an ellipse fitted to the ranges in the 

different directions. The semi-variogram is a common function used to measure the spatial variability 

within a deposit. 

The components of the variogram include the nugget, the sill, and the range. Often samples compared 

over very short distances (including samples from the same location) show some degree of variability. As 

a result, the curve of the variogram often begins at a point on the y-axis above the origin; this point is 

called the nugget. The nugget is a measure of not only the natural variability of the data over very short 

distances, but also a measure of the variability which can be introduced due to errors during sample 

collection, preparation, and assaying. 

Typically, the amount of variability between samples increases as the distance between the samples 

increase. Eventually, the degree of variability between samples reaches a constant or maximum value; 

this is called the sill, and the distance between samples at which this occurs is called the range. 

The spatial evaluation of the data was conducted using a correlogram instead of the traditional variogram. 

The correlogram is normalized to the variance of the data and is less sensitive to outlier values; this 

generally gives cleaner results. A spherical model was used. 

Correlograms were produced for each domain and metal using Sage2001® software and parameters 

transferred to Vulcan for grade estimation. Bearing, dip and plunge are given using Vulcan conventions. 

Table 14-1 summarizes the variography parameters for the four Chinchillas domains.

14.7 Block Model Construction 

The block model was constructed using Vulcan software. The block model volume encompassed all the 

area of drilling in the Project. The extent of the model is described in Table 14-2 and shown in Figure 

14-13.

7511800 North 1100m 5m 220 

3750       Elevation 550m 5m 110 

 

A 5m x 5m x 5m block size was chosen as being a realistic selective mining unit for the deposit. 

The boundaries used during construction of the block model included the topography surface supplied by 

Golden Arrow and the geological domains. There are no significant underground or surface workings to 

consider.  The topographic model used was supplied by PhotoSat
TM

 ("Photosat") and is a high resolution 

one metre digital elevation model supplied in Geotiff format. It was verified using four control points taken 

with differential GPS. The geological boundaries used are the domain wireframes were generated in 

Leapfrog and imported into Vulcan. 

14.7.1 Specific Gravity 

Measurements of specific gravity (see Section 115) were conducted on 983 samples in the Golden Arrow 

drill hole database. Measurements range from 1.34t/m
3
 to 2.91t/m

3
. Measurements were performed by a 

certified laboratory (Alex Stewart) initially, and later by Golden Arrow staff. Comparisons were performed 

between the two pyroclastic tuff units and between the two basement units but the differences were found 

to be insignificant so measurements were simply coded by lithology, and values were assigned to blocks 

based on their geology. Table 14-3 shows assigned values.

14.8 Metal Grade Interpolation 

Metal grades were interpolated into the blocks separately by domains.  Interpolation methods include: 

ordinary kriging, nearest neighbour, and inverse distance methods for comparative purposes. 

14.8.1 Search Distance 

The sample search distance for each interpolation was 100m x 100m x 50m. The long axis of the search 

ellipsoid was oriented in the direction of greatest continuity for each domain. 

14.8.2 Sample Restrictions 

Block estimates require a minimum of seven and a maximum of 13 composites. Composites were also 

limited to no more than six from an individual drill hole. This effectively means that a minimum of two drill 

holes are required within the search distance to estimate a block grade. 

14.8.3 Boundary Treatment 

Boundary relationships can be used to determine the inclusion or exclusion of sample data points used in 

the interpolation of one particular grade domain, and also to assist in confirming geological 

interpretations. A gradational contact (or soft boundary) generally allows the interpolation parameters to 

include a limited number of samples from an adjoining domain, while a sharp contact (or hard boundary) 

will restrict the sample points used in the interpolation to its own domain. 

At Chinchillas, only samples within the relevant ore domain are used in the block estimate (in effect a 

"hard boundary").  Contact profiles show that the mineral domains used to constrain the estimates tend to 

occur in distinct locations, (refer to Figure 14-14). There is, therefore, generally little contact between two 

zones. The exception is between MT and MB where the contact profile shows there is a distinct grade 

difference between the zones. It makes sense then to treat each of mineral zones separately for the 

interpolation of grade.

14.8.4 Treatment of Outlier Grades 

Histograms and probability plots were generated from composited sample data to show the distribution of 

each metal in each estimation domain. These were used to identify the existence of anomalous outlier 

grades in the composite database. A top cutting approach was used to limit the effect of outlier grades for 

each metal in each of the four estimation domains. The top cuts were determined using an iterative 

approach whereby the top cut was progressively lowered until approximately 5% of the gross metal was 

removed compared to the uncut estimate for each zone and metal. The results are shown in Table 14-4.

14.9 Block Model Validation 

Grade models were validated by four methods: 

14.9.1 Visual Comparison 

Colour-coded block model grades were compared with composite grades on section and plan plots (refer 

to Figures 14-15 through 14-18). The correspondence between sample grades and estimated values 

appeared to be appropriate given the continuity of mineralization.

14.9.2 Comparison of Global Mean Grades  

Global estimated grades for ordinary kriging, inverse distance, and nearest neighbour models were 

compared. Theoretically, ordinary kriging and the nearest neighbour estimate should be "declustered" and 

produce close to the same global mean value. It was found that the global means for all metals and zones 

were within a few relative percent.

14.9.3 Change of Support 

The relative degree of smoothing in the block estimates was evaluated using the Hermitian Polynomial 

Change of Support ("Herco") method, also known as the Discrete Gaussian Correction (Journel and 

Huijbregts, 1978). With this method, the distribution of the hypothetical block grades can be directly 

compared to the estimated ordinary kriging model through the use of pseudo-grade/tonnage curves. 

Adjustments are made to the block model interpolation parameters until an acceptable match is made 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 78 

with the Herco distribution. In general, the estimated model should be slightly higher in tonnage and 

slightly lower in grade when compared to the Herco distribution at the projected cut-off grade. These 

differences account for selectivity and other potential ore-handling issues which commonly occur during 

mining. 

The Herco distribution is derived from the declustered composite grades which have been adjusted to 

account for the change in support moving from smaller drill hole composite samples to the larger blocks in 

the model. The transformation results in a less skewed distribution, but with the same mean as the 

original declustered samples. An example of a Herco plots from the Socavon silver model is shown in 

Figure 14-19:      

 

Figure 14-19:  Herco Plot for Silver Mantos 

The change of support models show the OK models for silver in the MT and MB domains may be smooth 

in comparison; however, the amount of smoothing is not extreme. The models are appropriate for the 

statement of resources and as the basis for engineering studies. There is less smoothing in the estimates 

for the ST and SB zones. Again, the models are still appropriate for the intended purposes. Overall, the 

desired degree of correlation between models has been achieved. It should be noted that the change of 

support model is a theoretical tool intended to direct model estimation. There is uncertainty associated 

with the change of support model, and its results should not be viewed as a final or correct value.   

14.9.4 Swath Plots 

A swath plot is a graphical display of the grade distribution derived from a series of bands, or swaths, 

generated in several directions throughout the deposit. Using the swath plot, grade variations from the 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 79 

ordinary kriging model are compared to the distribution derived from the declustered nearest neighbour 

grade model. 

On a local scale, the nearest neighbour model does not provide reliable estimations of grade, but, on a 

much larger scale, it represents an unbiased estimation of the grade distribution based on the underlying 

data. Therefore, if the ordinary kriging model is unbiased, the grade trends may show local fluctuations on 

a swath plot, but the overall trend should be similar to the nearest neighbour distribution of grade. 

Swath plots were generated in three orthogonal directions that compare the ordinary kriging and nearest 

neighbour estimates for silver, lead, and zinc in the zones.  

Examples for silver, zinc and lead are shown in Figures 14-20 to 14-22 below. The results suggest there 

is good correlation between the models; the degree of smoothing in the ordinary kriging model is evident 

in the peaks and valleys shown in the swath plots.

14.10 Metal Equivalent Formula 

A silver equivalent formula is used for selecting blocks above a cut-off grade. Silver equivalent values 

were calculated for lead and zinc as follows: 

(Recovery * (metal % to lbs) * metal price/lb)/ silver price per troy ounce = equivalent silver ounces * 

ounces to grams 

Recovery is assumed to be 100%.  Conversion factors used were: 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 82 

 Percentage to lbs = 22.046 

 Grams to troy ounces = 1/31.1034 

Table 14-6: Silver Equivalent Input Parameters 

Metal Metal Price Unit Metal Price  Recovery (%) 

Ag USD/troy ounce $22.00 100 

Pb USD/lb $1 100 

Zn USD/lb $1 100 

 

For example a block estimated as 1.5% Zinc, 2% Pb and 50ppm Ag would be equivalent to  

Silver equivalent from zinc = (1.5 *22.046 *1.00/22.00)*31.1034 = 46.75 ppm 

Silver equivalent from lead = (2 *22.046 *1.00/22.00)*31.1034 = 62.34 ppm 

Silver equivalent from all metals = 46.75 + 62.34 + 50 ppm = 159.09 ppm Ag equivalent 

The formula for equivalent grades can be summarized as: 

  AgEq = (Pb * 31.172) + (Zn% * 31.172) + Ag gpt 

 

14.11 Resource Classification 

All resources have been classified as inferred or indicated. No measured resources have been classified. 

No mineral reserves have been classified. Mineral reserves can only be estimated on the basis of an 

economic evaluation that is used in a prefeasibility or feasibility study. No environmental, permitting, legal, 

title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing or other relevant issues are known to the author that may 

currently affect the estimate of mineral resources. As per NI 43-101, mineral resources, which are not 

mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is also no certainty that these 

inferred and indicated mineral resources will be converted to the measured category through further 

drilling, or into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. 

Several factors were considered in the classification of resources at Chinchillas. These included  

 CIM and JORC guidelines 

 Spatial continuity of mineralized drill hole intercepts 

 Geostatistical relationships between composites. 

 Drill hole density 

 Geology 

14.11.1 Inferred Category Criteria 

Blocks may be estimated as inferred where "geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify 

geological and grade continuity". (Joint Ore Reserves Committee, 2012). All blocks estimated inside the 

Silver Mantos, Mantos Basement, Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement ore domains within 50 

metres of the nearest drillhole were judged to meet this criteria and have been classified as inferred. 

Table 14-7 summarizes the rules applied to classify resources. 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 83 

14.11.2 Indicated Category Criteria 

Mineralization may be classified as indicated when the nature, quality, amount and distribution are such 

as to allow confident interpretation of the geological framework and to assume continuity of 

mineralization. (Joint Ore Reserves Committee, 2012).  

The only domains displaying this level of continuity of mineralization are the Silver Mantos and Mantos 

Basement domains. The drill hole density is sufficient and the continuity of mineralization between drill 

holes is evident. The mineralization is relatively predictable and Golden Arrow geologists provided a 

robust interpretation of mineralization in these zones.  

At Socavon del Diablo and Socavon Basement domains, although some areas have sampling density 

similar to the Mantos zones, the overall drill density and understanding of geology and mineralization 

mechanisms are not sufficient to classify any resources as indicated. 

Blocks classified in the indicated category must be no further than 35m from the nearest drill hole.  Table 

14-7 summarizes the rules applied to classify resources. 

Table 14-7: Resource Classification Criteria 

Resource Classification Criteria 

Inferred Category 

Must be inside any ore zone wireframe.  Blocks must be interpolated with a 

minimum of seven composites from two drill holes. Block must be no further than 

50m from nearest drillhole  

Indicated Category 

Only blocks with Silver Mantos and Mantos Basement domain wireframe 

considered for inclusion. Blocks must be interpolated with a minimum of seven 

composites from three drill holes. Block must be no further than 35m from nearest 

drillhole.

14.12 Mineral Resources 

14.12.1 Resource Constraints - Pit Shell 

NI 43-101 states that "all estimates resulting from each of the cut-off grade scenarios must meet the test 

of reasonable prospect of economic extraction".  Therefore resources were constrained using a pit shell 

generated using the floating cone method and NSR parameters used in the January, 2014 PEA report 

(Kuchling et al., 2014) (see Figure 14-24). 

Metal prices of of $35 per ounce of silver and $2 per pound of lead and zinc were used to generate an 

open pit constrained resource.  

Assumed operating parameters are listed as follows: 

 Mining: $2.45/t (ore and waste). 

 Process: $16.00/t ore 

 G&A: $8.30/t ore 

 45 degree pit slope. 

The NSR values are determined using the following formulas by ore type: 

Silver Mantos:        NSR=(Pb% * 39.584)+(Zn% * 28.109) + (Aggpt * 1.028) – 4.988 

Socavon del Diablo:        NSR=(Pb% * 39.584)+(Zn% * 31.856) + (Aggpt * 1.044) – 14.915 

Mantos Basement, Socavon Basement: NSR=(Pb% * 40.212)+(Zn% * 32.231) + (Aggpt * 1.024) – 

13.866 

It is important to note that the NSR parameters including prices have only been used for generating a 

resource-constraining pit shell. Resources within the constraining shell are summarized using silver 

equivalent grades calculated using metal prices shown in Table 14-6.

NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 85 

14.12.2 Cut-Off Grade Determination 

Within the constraining pit shell, the resource has been reported using a cut-off grade of 40 g/t AgEq 

(Figure 14-24).   The cut-off is based on PEA operating costs of $16/t for processing, $9/t for G&A ($25/t 

total) with a silver price of $22/oz and a process recovery of 90%.   Therefore the cut-off grade is 

determined as: $25/(22/31.1*90%) = 40 g/t. 

14.12.3 Mineral Resources Tabulation 

Table 14-8 summarizes the mineral resources for the Chinchillas Project, at a 40g/t silver equivalent cut-

off.

Notes: 

6. The AgEq formula used is (Pb x 31.172) + (Zn x 31.172) + (Ag x 1).   
7. Totals may not add correctly due to rounding 
8. A resource constraining shell was developed based on metal prices of US$35.00/ounce silver, 

US$2.00/pound zinc and US$2.00/pound lead.    Within that shell, the resource has been reported using a 
cut-off grade of 40 g/t Ag Eq.  The cut-off was determined using operating costs of US$16.00/tonne for 
processing, US$9.00/tonne for G&A (US$25.00/t total) with metal prices of US$22.00/oz silver, 
US$1.00/pound zinc and US$1.00/pound lead, and a process recovery of 90%, based on the 2014 
Preliminary Economic Assessment. (See reported filed on SEDAR dated January 20th, 2014 for details.)    
The pit slope used for the resource shell is 45 degrees. 

9. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 
estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 
sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. 

10. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient 
exploration to classify these inferred resources as Indicated or Measured, and it is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured category.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 

No marketing studies have been completed at this stage and Golden Arrow has not entered into any 

contracts. 

19.1 Commodity Pricing 

Resources reported in Chapter 14 are summarized using silver equivalent grades calculated using metal 

prices of $22/oz silver and $1/lb for lead and zinc These commodity price assumptions were developed 

by Golden Arrow using a review of recent comparable peer reports and projected price information and 

were deemed reasonable by the Qualified Person.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact 

The Company has made considerable efforts in environmental programs and community engagement. 

The following presents a brief summary of the environmental aspects, permitting and social or community 

impacts of the work program to date.   

20.1 Environmental Setting 

20.1.1 Drilling Permit Process 

In Jujuy province, drill permits are issued following the completion and acceptance of an Environmental 

Impact Assessment report (EIA). The EIA is submitted for review to the Provincial Environmental 

Management Unit, or UGAMP ("Unidad de Gestión Ambiental Provincial" in Spanish). The UGAMP is a 

multi-stakeholder group chaired by a technical appointee from the Mining Department who recommends 

approval or rejection of the EIA and related work application to the provincial mining authorities. Meetings 

are held to allow UGAMP members to review the proposed materials with members of the Company.   

UGAMP representatives reviewing the work applications for the Chinchillas Project have included:  

 Local Communities of Santo Domingo, Orosmayo, Liviara 

 Mining Workers Unions 

 Provincial Department of Water Resources 

 Department of Mines and Energy 

 Provincial Secretary of Mining  

 Surface Landowners 

 Provincial College of Geologists 

 Provincial Department of Environment 

 Provincial Department of Human Rights and Indigenous Communities 

 National University of Jujuy 

 Chamber Mining Jujuy  

 National Parks Administration 

 Corporation for the Development of the Pozuelos River, and 

 Representatives from Golden Arrow. 

When the UGAMP process has been successfully completed the EIA is accepted and an Environmental 

Impact Declaration ("DIA" for Declaración de Impacto Ambiental in Spanish) is awarded.  These are valid 

for a two-year period, after which they must be renewed in order for drilling to continue.   

The Chinchillas Project consists of two contiguous properties (minas) as described in Chapter 4. Golden 

Arrow completed the UGAMP process for the Chinchilla mina and received its first DIA in March 2012. 

Following a second UGAMP, this permit was renewed in March 2014 for a further two years. Golden 

Arrow received the first DIA for the Chinchilla I property in July 2013 following a successful UGAMP 

process.  

20.1.2 Surface Monitoring 

Golden Arrow maintains Fauna and Flora and Surface Water Quality Monitoring Programs.  Field surveys 

have been undertaken, in which local residents from Santo Domingo participated and assisted with data 

collection.  



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 93 

The goal of the Fauna and Flora Monitoring Program is to develop baseline data and evaluate any 

potential changes over protected fauna and flora species. 

The goal of the Surface Water Quality Monitoring Program is develop baseline data and evaluate the 

quality of hydrological resources on the surface. Samples of surface water are collected and analyzed for 

baseline reference.  

20.1.3 Laguna de los Pozuelos 

Situated 25 km northeast of Chinchillas is the "Laguna de los Pozuelos", a National Natural Monument 

protected by the "Administracion de Parques Nacionales" (National Parks Administration) as well as a 

RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance and the core zone of a Biosphere Reserve.  It covers a 

surface of approximately 16,000 hectares and in this area all economic activities, including mining, are 

prohibited.  

Argentina has established 13 Biosphere reserves recognized under UNESCO's Man and Biosphere 

Programme.  "Biosphere reserves are sites established by countries and recognized under UNESCO's 

Man and the Biosphere ("MAB") Programme to promote sustainable development based on local 

community efforts and sound science." (www.unesco.org)  The Pozuelos Biosphere Reserve core zone is 

surrounded by a buffer zone of approximately 380,000 hectares that is administered by the Jujuy multi-

sector organization Corporation for the Development of the Pozuelos River  (CODEPO, for Corporación 

para el Desarrollo de la Cuenca de Pozuelos in Spanish).  As shown in Figure 20.1, the Secretaria de 

Minería  GIS data indicate that the Chinchillas property is located just inside the buffer zone, while 

boundaries provided by the Universidad Nacional de Jujuy (UNJ) follow the UNESCO model and divide 

the buffer zone into an outer transition zone, with the Chinchillas property located outside of both zones.   

Although neither are definitive, the Ministry data of the buffer outline is the most recent and has been 

adopted for this report.  In either case, economic activities, including mining and exploration, are allowed 

in these areas, following the UGAMP process described above and the mine permitting process 

described in section 20.2.   Furthermore, Knight Piésold believes that proper and conscientious 

development of the Chinchillas deposit can be done in accordance with the UNESCO objectives in a 

manner that will not impact the conservation values of the Laguna de Pozuelos.  Knight Piésold does not 

believe the Reserve buffer zone designation represents an impediment to the continued development of 

the Chinchillas deposit.

20.1.4 Historic Liabilities 

Some remnants of historic mining activities in the Project area, such as small buildings and historic drilling 

platforms, trenches, tunnels and holes still exists in the area. All of these liabilities were declared as pre-

existing in the Company's EIA report for the Project. 

20.2 Social & Community Aspects 

Golden Arrow has been working closely with local authorities and communities since 2011. The area of 

influence of the Project includes the communities of Santo Domingo, Liviara, and Orosmayo. In general, 

the communities are engaged in rural activities and their settlement patterns and spatial dispersion 

responds to pastoral activity. Golden Arrow has designed and implemented a Community Relations Plan 

for the long-term cooperation with the local communities. At this early stage of work the communities of 

Liviara and Orosmayo have been consulted and informed about the Company's works and plans, but the 

immediate area of the Chinchillas Project is part of the Santo Domingo community and this community 

has participated most actively in the Project plans and works.   

Golden Arrow regularly participates in community assemblies to discuss hiring personnel, benefits and 

other improvements to the community. In addition, Golden Arrow has established access agreements 

with local landowners in the Chinchillas Project area.

23 Adjacent Properties 

Silver Standard Resources Inc´s Pirquitas silver-zinc mine is located 30 kilometres to the southwest of the 

Chinchillas Project in Jujuy province. Pirquitas' 2013 mineral resources and reserves summary includes 

measured resources, inclusive of reserves, of 53 Moz silver and indicated resources of 100.2 Moz silver
1
. 

As outlined in Section 8, Pirquitas and Chinchillas share some geologic characteristics. The host rocks 

and mineralization in the Mantos and Socovon Basement zones at Chinchillas are similar in style to the 

Pirquitas deposit mineralization.  As such, the Pirquitas deposit provides an important exploration model 

for the Chinchillas Project.  

Glencore Xstrata's Aguilar silver, lead, zinc mine is located 90 kilometres southeast of Chinchillas within 

the same province of Jujuy. Glencore published 2013 measured and indicated reserves of 7.1Mt at 4.2% 

zinc, 4.3% lead and 98 g/t silver
2
. Aguilar has been in almost constant production for 80 years. Lead 

concentrates produced from the mine are treated in Aguilar's smelter in Palpala, Jujuy and the zinc 

concentrate is treated at the AR Zinc smelter, located in Santa Fe province, central Argentina. Although 

the Aguilar deposit has different geology (mineralization is hosted in a skarn re-mobilized sedex 

environment) the mine gives important indications of logistics and economic costs of mining in Jujuy and 

Argentina, as well as examples of potential alternative ore processing in Argentina. 

Properties directly adjacent to the Chinchillas Project include: Carahuasi to the south (543-M-2006), cateo 

855-S-2007 to the west, cateo 854-S-2007 to the east, Conquista II (1644-R-2011) to the east and north, 

and cateo 627-C-2006 to the north. Mineral deposits of real or potential economic significance are not 

known to exist on these properties.  

The author has visited Pirquitas and Aguilar mines to compare the geology with Chinchillas. Resource 

and Reserve information for Pirquitas and Aguilar deposits has been obtained from Silver Standard´s and 

Glencore's public data on their respective websites. This information was not considered during the 

resource estimation and is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization at the Chinchillas Project.

economic assessment in the future. 

24.1 Proposed Development Plan 

The project concept for the purposes of the PEA is to develop an owner-operated open pit silver-lead-zinc 

mine with an on-site concentrator using conventional flotation concentration methods to produce a silver-

bearing lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate.  

A series of pit optimizations were run using the resource block model, applying a range of metal prices 

and recoveries, and estimated costs for mining, processing, and general and administrative (G&A). The 

operational pits were designed based on the optimized shells, and the potentially mineable portion of the 

resource was estimated within those pits. The ultimate pit contains a total of 81 million tonnes of 

combined mill feed and waste material including 25 million tonnes of mill feed, for a strip ratio of 2.2:1. 

The mill feed tonnages incorporates an ore loss factor of 3% and dilution at 10%. 

Existing infrastructure to support mining is in place and the Project has two all season access routes. 

Power is available at the nearby village of Santo Domingo; however it is not sufficient for the processing 

operation and project development would require additional power supplies to be sourced. The water 

consumption for the future operations of the project is estimated to be approximately 0.75 M m
3
/year and 

would be sourced from local and regional wells. Site water management facilities will include diversion 

channels for non-contact water and collection channels for contact water. Water will be conserved and 

recycled to the maximum extent possible. Chinchillas will produce thickened tailings that will be stored 

within a lined tailings impoundment that will be constructed and expanded in stages using mine waste 

rock to distribute expenditures over the life of the mine. 

A mill production rate of 6,000 tonnes per day is assumed. The production schedule includes one year of 

pre-production pre-stripping, mainly to acquire material to build the tailings starter dam, followed by 

twelve years of operating mine life.  

The proposed processing flow sheet is typical of that for many lead-zinc-silver ores, consisting of primary 

crushing, grinding in SAG/Ball mills and differential flotation to sequentially float ore from the pulp, 

producing first a silver-bearing lead concentrate and then a zinc concentrate. The rougher concentrates 

will subsequently be cleaned to enhance concentrate grades.  

It is assumed that lead and zinc concentrates will be shipped to a smelter/refinery via Antofagasta, Chile. 

An estimated 64.5 million ounces of silver are to be produced through the life of the mine, at an average 

head grade of 86.1g/t silver. In addition, 253 million pounds of zinc and 305 million pounds of lead will be 

produced with average head grades of 0.56% zinc and 0.64% lead respectively. 

The potentially mineable tonnages utilized in the PEA contain both Indicated and Inferred resources. The 

reader is cautioned that Inferred Resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the

economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, 

and there is no certainty that value from such Resources will be realized either in whole or in part. 

 

24.2 Capital and Operating Costs 

The capital cost estimate summarized in Table 24-1 was developed to a level commensurate with that of 

a Preliminary Economic Assessment in order to evaluate the Chinchillas project overall viability. After 

inclusion of the contingency, the capital cost estimate is considered to have an accuracy of ±35%, Q4 of 

2013. It is estimated that the initial capital cost would be in the range of $202 million.

24.3 Economic Analysis 

The PEA project economics are based on long term metal prices of $US 22.00/oz silver, $US 1.00/lb 

lead, $US 1.00/lb zinc.  Management has assumed a base case long-term price scenario of $22 per 



 
 

Chinchillas Silver-Lead-Zinc Project   
NI 43-101 Technical Report  Page | 101 

ounce of silver and an 8% discount rate.  The silver price was based on a survey of silver price forecasts 

between $22 and $23 per ounce in 2015, the estimated Project start date.  The revenue is mainly derived 

from silver with lead and zinc as by-products.  The lead-silver concentrate generates 88% of the total 

revenue.  Table 24-3 summarizes the parameters of the cash flow model.

Average Ag recovery (Pb Con) % 85% 

Life of Mine years 12 

Total Unit operating cost  $/t feed $27.96 

Total Unit cash cost without credits $/oz Ag $10.96 

 

The economic analysis includes a provincial mining royalty of 3% on the mine head value and a federal 

income tax at 35%.  The export tax rate has been assumed at 7.5%, which is based on a 10% tax rate 

less a 2.5% credit for projects located in the Puna region, as outlined in Resolution No. 762/93 of the 

Ministry of Economy of Argentina.  Table 24-4 summarizes the financial analysis from the economic 

model.

 Before Tax After Tax 

NPV 0% (millions) $451.4 $289.7

A sensitivity analysis was conducted for several metal price cases, as summarized below in Table 24-5.  

The economic results for the variable metal prices do not incorporate modifications to the production plan 

tonnages and grades that may be driven by the variable prices. The same production profile is maintained 

for all price scenarios. The analysis indicates that the project demonstrates positive economics at all three 

silver price scenarios.

The PEA is considered preliminary in nature. All mineralized material classified as indicated and inferred 

mineral resources are considered in the pit optimization and mine plan. Mineral resources, which are not 

mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. In addition, inferred resources are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would 

enable them to be characterized as mineral reserves, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in 

upgrading these resources.

25 Interpretations and Conclusions 

All exploration data, methods and resource estimates detailed in this report were completed to be 

compliant with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 as set forth in CIM Standards on Resources and 

Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines.   

The preliminary economic assessment detailed in Kuchling et al. (2014) was based on the then current 

2013 resource estimate (Davis and Howie 2013).  The PEA study was initiated with a goal of providing 

investors and interested parties with a preliminary view of the potential economics of the Project, and to 

provide management with guidance for the future exploration and development processes.  One of the 

conclusions from that report was that there remained very good potential to expand the resource at 

Chinchillas.   As such, the Phase III drill program was initiated, and led to the expanded resource 

estimate detailed in this report.   This updated resource estimate and study will form the basis for an 

updated PEA. 

The authors conclude that: 

 There is a good understanding of the geology and mineralization of the deposit.  

 Exploration drilling, sampling, sample preparation, assaying, specific gravity measurements and 

drill hole surveys have been carried out in accordance with industry standard best practices and 

are suitable to support resource estimates. Sampling and assaying include appropriate quality 

assurance and control procedures. 

 The resource model developed for the Chinchillas deposit uses accepted modeling and grade 

estimation methods. The model is a reasonable reflection of deposit geology. 

 The estimated indicated resource using a cut-off grade of 40 g/t of equivalent silver is 24.6 Mt 

with grades of 91 g/t silver, 0.65% lead, and 0.31% zinc. A further inferred resource of 22.0 Mt 

with grades of 57 g/t silver, 0.61% lead, and 0.68% zinc has been estimated using the same cut-

off grade. 

 Metallurgical studies, including locked-cycle tests, have been completed on representative 

samples. The results indicate that the recovery of silver, lead, and zinc is likely to be very good. 

Additional metallurgical testing will be required to confirm the optimum processing for all 

mineralization types.   

 The PEA outlined in Kuchling et al., (2014) concluded that: "The Chinchillas deposit demonstrates 

several attributes well suited for a potential mining operation, including near-surface 

mineralization, good silver grades, access to infrastructure and amenability to conventional 

mining and processing. The project demonstrates positive economics at a range of silver prices, 

based on the current technical assumptions; however, the economics are highly leveraged to the 

price of silver."  The expanded August 29
th
, 2014 resource estimate detailed in this report 

warrants updating the economic study for the Chinchillas deposit.  

 Upgrading of the resource categories will be required to further advance the project to feasibility. 

 There is good potential to expand the current resource, and to define new resources throughout 

the property.

26 Recommendations 

The preliminary economic assessment (Kuchling et al., 2014) of the Chinchillas deposit indicates potential 

for it to be a viable mining operation.     The subsequent exploration drill program and re-estimation of 

resources for the deposit has added significantly to the initial resource base and therefore the potential 

exists that an updated PEA based on this new estimate will show significant gains.  A further economic 

evaluation beyond a PEA level study, such Feasibility Study (FS) or Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS), will 

require converting Inferred resources to the Measured and/or Indicated classification through an in-fill drill 

program.   

The following activities are recommended to advance the Chinchillas Project:  

 Update the existing PEA based on the results of the 2014 exploration program and metallurgical 

testing. 

 Initiate Feasibility Study (FS) or Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS).  In preparation for that study, the 

following is recommended: 

o A further 15,000 metres of infill drilling to convert Inferred resources to the Measured and 

Indicated classifications.   The estimated budget is $4.5M. 

o 5,000 metres of condemnation, metallurgical, geotechnical and hydrogeological drilling. 

The estimated cost is $1.5M. 

o Continue with metallurgical testing.  The estimated cost $0.3M. 

o Golden Arrow should continue with its social and environmental programs 

o Initiation of the mine permitting process.   

A detailed plan and budget for a PFS or FS is recommended once the above work programs are 

complete.
