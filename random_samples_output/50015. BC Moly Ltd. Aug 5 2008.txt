1.  SUMMARY 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Watts, Griffis and McOuat Limited ("WGM") was retained by Columbia Yukon Explorations 
Inc. ("Columbia Yukon") to conduct a technical review of the Storie molybdenum property 
in the Liard Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada, and prepare a National Instrument 
43-101 ("NI 43-101") compliant report with an updated Mineral Resource estimate.  In June 
2007, WGM prepared a NI 43-101 report based on the results of historic drilling and 2006 
drilling by Columbia Yukon.  This report includes the results of the 2007 drilling program. 
 
For the purposes of the first report, Robert M. Kuehnbaum, P.Geo., Senior Associate 
Geologist of WGM, visited the Storie property on April 24, 2007, during which time 
verification surface sampling was done.  Drill core, stored off-site at the former townsite of 
Cassiar, was also sampled on April 24 and 25.  Mr. Kuehnbaum re-visited the project on 
July 10 to 12, 2007, during the beginning of the 2007 drill program, during which time 
additional surface and drill core verification sampling was done.  Columbia Yukon provided 
digital and hard copies of some technical information, as well as their databases of drillhole 
and analytical data.  Other technical information was obtained from the digitized assessment 
records of the BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, as well as published 
articles. 
 
Mintec, Inc. ("Mintec") was retained by Columbia Yukon to prepare a Mineral Resource 
estimate for the Storie Deposit based on the results of some historic and 2006 and 2007 
drilling.  Mintec's report was provided to WGM and has been incorporated into this report. 
 
Property Location and Status 
 
The Storie Property (the "Property") is situated about 6 km southwest of Cassiar, British 
Columbia.  Cassiar is located 15 km (by road) west of Highway 37 which provides access to 
Watson Lake, Yukon, in the north and Dease Lake and Stewart, BC, to the south.  Access to 
the Property is by a purpose-built road.  The Property lies between about 1,400 m and 
1,750 m above sea level. 
 



    

- 2 - 

The Property consists of three mineral tenures, with a nominal total area of 916.552 ha, 
wholly owned by Columbia Yukon.  The Property was under a five-year option agreement 
with Eveready Resource Corporation ("Eveready"), but Columbia Yukon exercised the 
option by satisfying all required exploration expenditures, share issuances, and cash 
payments, in less than two years.  Eveready retains a 2.5% net smelter return royalty, which 
Columbia Yukon may partly or completely purchase.  The Property has been converted into 
the current British Columbia "cell"-based land tenure system, and there are plans for 
Columbia Yukon to acquire cell fractions on the northern edge of the Property when a 
neighbouring claim is converted. 
 
Geology and Mineralization 
 
The area of the Storie Deposit is underlain by a variety of quartz monzonites and a quartz-
feldspar porphyry.  The units generally grade into one another over mostly short distances (up 
to 2-3 ms); some contacts, however, are relatively abrupt, locally cross structural 
discontinuities, or may be defined by aplite dykes.  The Storie Deposit is cut by northerly and 
easterly trending faults, most notably the west-southwest-trending Crone Fault.  In drill core, 
there are numerous zones of gouge and slickensided fractures; crushed or brecciated zones are 
common.  Faulting has locally disrupted the molybdenum mineralization.  Alteration types 
include kaolinization and sericitization, pyritization, quartz veins, K-feldspar-muscovite-
quartz-pyrite bands (adjacent to some fractures), silicification, and chloritization; discernable 
alteration patterns have not yet been recognized. 
 
The Storie molybdenum deposit consists of one or more vertically separate and 
interconnecting, tabular to lensoid bodies, generally dipping moderately to the north-
northeast.  There is no large-scale quartz stockwork or vein system typical of most porphyry 
molybdenum deposits.  Molybdenite, the only economic mineral, occurs as selvages on, or 
within quartz veinlets and as coatings on fracture surfaces, grains or smears on slickensided 
fractures, rosettes and disseminations.  An earlier study concluded that the predominant 
fracture sets trends west-southwest and dips northwest, and that molybdenum grade correlates 
with fracture density.

Drilling 
 
Historic exploration covered the period 1959 to 2005, and included resource estimates in 
1979 and 1980 by Shell Canada. 
 
In 2006, Columbia Yukon drilled 20 NQ diamond drillholes totalling 4,953 m.  All but one 
were located and oriented to twin historic (mostly Shell Canada) holes; a few of the older 
historic holes are, however, vertical, and were not truly twinned.  In 2007, 75 NQ holes and 
one HQ hole were drilled, totalling 23,073 m.  Nineteen of the holes were drilled in areas 
beyond the then-known resource area, while the remainder were laid out as fill-in holes to 
upgrade resources; three were twins of 2006 drillholes to test for molybdenum loss during 
sampling procedures. 
 
During the 2006 drilling, overall drill core recovery in individual drillholes was 95% to 
98% in the initial six holes, but decreased to 82% to 92% thereafter, possibly due to overly 
aggressive drilling after the initial holes.  Recovery in individual holes was quite variable.  
Low-recovery intervals were associated with both low and relatively high molybdenum 
contents, but there was some evidence of possible local, drilling-related molybdenite loss.  
Greater care was taken during the 2007 program to maximize recovery by controlling 
advance, and recovery improved significantly: of the 76 holes drilled, 70 had >95% recovery, 
and lesser recovery (as low as 90.5%) in the remaining holes can be accounted for by surface 
weathering or local bad ground conditions. 
 
Correlation of molybdenum contents between the 2006 drillholes with twinned 1971 and 1980 
holes is reasonable to very good.  Between 2006 and 1979 drillholes, the correlation is 
moderately good to fair, and differences can be mostly explained by incompatible hole 
orientations.  Pre-1971 drillholes were vertical, and correlation with subsequent twinning 
holes is problematic.  In 2007, WGM concluded that the 1971, 1979 and 1980 analytical data 
can be reliably used, where needed, for the Mineral Resource estimates.  Only four pre-1971 
holes were included in the 2007 WGM Mineral Resource Estimate.  For the 2008 Mineral 
Resource estimate, only historic holes from 1979 and 1980, and Columbia Yukon's 2006 and 
2007 drillholes were used.

QA/QC Programs 
 
Columbia Yukon conducted thorough QA/QC programs with the introduction of blanks, 
several standards (three in 2006, one in 2007) and duplicate samples into the analysis stream; 
in addition, in 2007, blind samples were sent to a second laboratory for comparison with the 
primary set of analyses. 
 
Results indicate that sample preparation and analytical procedures for samples from the 2006 
and 2007 diamond drilling program were adequate.  Blank sample results indicate that lab 
contamination, if any, was insignificant.  The results of the external standards appear to be 
precise and reasonably accurate; the pulp repeats (including assay repeats) also showed a high 
degree of repeatability.  Re-split sample pairs from different portions of crushed core show a 
lower degree of repeatability than pulp re-analyses, reflecting the nuggety character of 
molybdenite mineralization.  For the 2007 program, alternate laboratory re-analysis of 
selected pulps was done for comparative purposes; there was very good correlation between 
assay pairs from the two laboratories. 
 
2008 Mineral Resource Estimate 
 
Mintec was retained by Columbia Yukon in February, 2008, to update 3-D modeling of the 
deposit and complete a Mineral Resource estimate for the deposit.  The work done by Mintec 
includes: 
 
• Collection of all available drilling and topographic information; 
• Development of a 3-D solid of mineralized domain; 
• Geostatistical analysis of the data; 
• Development of a 3-dimensional block model; and  
• Resource estimation and classification. 
 
The number of drillholes used in this evaluation was 125. All drillhole assay and survey 
information was received in "csv" format. The total drilling in the current database is 
35,548 m including the unassayed intervals.  However, the majority of the intervals are 
assayed for Mo. The topography contours were received as polylines. 



    

- 5 - 

 
Mintec did not check the assay data information for consistency except for the minor 
corrections.  Thus, the data provided was assumed to be verified by Columbia Yukon for 
accuracy. 
 
Mintec received 14 scanned, hand interpreted geological sections and rock type drillhole 
intervals from Columbia Yukon.  After calculations and review of statistics per rock type, 
Mintec decided to create two domains, within a mineralized envelope, representing above and 
below the geological contact between rock type 2 and 3.  
 
The geological contact polylines were interpreted on the 170° drillhole sections following the 
scanned geological sections as a guide.  The polylines were later snapped to the drillhole 
intervals, and linked to create a surface. The surface was extended above topographic limits, 
following the general trend of the geological contact, and closed to create a 3-D wireframe 
solid.  This solid was assigned a Material Type of LITH with code 1.  The 3-D model blocks 
and the drillhole assays were assigned a LITH code of 1 if they were within the lithology 
solid and an LITH code of 2 if they were outside the lithology solid. 
 
Mintec also built a mineralized envelope (3-D wireframe model) in the deposit based on the 
drillhole assay information only. The mineralized polygons were interpreted on the 170° 
drillhole sections.  These polygons were extended 70 m from the outer drillholes on each 
section. The polygons were linked to the mineralized solid.  The solid was assigned a Material 
Type of MZONE with code of 1.  The 3-D model blocks and the drillhole assays were 
assigned an MZONE code of 1 if they were within the mineralized solid. 
 
The 3-D model blocks and the drillhole assays were assigned a geologic domain code 
("DOMN") code of 1 if they were within the mineralized solid and within the lithology solid; 
they were assigned a domain code of 2 if they were within the mineralized solid and outside 
the lithology solid. 
 
Geostatistical analysis of the drillhole data for the Storie molybdenum deposit was done for 
Mo using the available assay data, and the 5 m composites.  The average grade of Mo in the 
database at zero cutoff grade for the available intervals is 0.048% Mo.  
 



    

- 6 - 

The variogram analysis for the deposit was done for Mo grade within the mineralized domain 
to determine the spatial continuity of the mineralization in the deposit and to define the 
parameters for the grade interpolation of the block model.  The directional variograms were 
modeled using an exponential model, displaying generally good correlations in short ranges 
of 25-50 m.  There were also continuing but decreased correlations in the longer ranges 
depending on the direction of the mineralization. 
 
Based upon the mineralized solid (3-D wireframe model) and the geostatistical analysis of the 
assay data, a 3-D block model of the deposit was built with 10x10x10 m-size blocks for 
Mineral Resource estimation.  The block grades were interpolated for all items using the 
Inverse Distance Cubed Weighting ("ID3") method.  Mo grade was also interpolated using 
Ordinary Kriging ("OK") and Polygonal methods for checking and comparison. 
 
The DOMN that was assigned to each block and composite data was utilized during the grade 
interpolation to make sure the composites from the same domain are used for the blocks in 
that domain. 
 
Mintec received 121 specific gravity ("SG") analyses from Columbia Yukon.  After statistical 
analysis, the specific gravity results showed no correlation with molybdenum assays.  Mintec 
interpolated density values into the blocks using the available drillhole density data.  The 
density values received were composited using 10 m benches and interpolated with an Inverse 
Distance Squared weighting method.  A weighted average of 121 densities was calculated to 
be approximately 2.6 g/cm3 and used as a background value for the 3-D model blocks with no 
assigned density value. 
 
Outlier high grade cutoffs were applied for Mo within the mineralized domain during the 
interpolation to restrict the smearing effect of very high grades.  The cutoff was based on the 
cumulative probability plot and statistical analysis of Mo grade distribution. 
 
The Mineral Resources were based on the grade interpolations using the ID3 method.  
Comparison of the global resources from ID3 and kriging showed that the results from the 
kriging method had much smoother grade estimates as expected.  The Mineral Resource 
classification was based on the geostatistical variogram ranges and Mo grade interpolation 
parameters in the deposit.

Total Indicated Mineral Resources in the deposit at zero cutoff are approximately 148 million 
tonnes grading 0.049% Mo.  Total Indicated Mineral Resources in the deposit at 0.035% Mo 
cutoff are approximately 85 million tonnes grading 0.069% Mo.  The Inferred Mineral 
Resources at the same cutoff are about 26 million tonnes grading 0.064% Mo.  The Indicated 
and Inferred Mineral Resources for Mo at incremental cutoffs from different methods are 
shown below.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Columbia Yukon's 2006 and 2007 work has largely focussed on verifying and upgrading 
resources which were previously known.  The Storie Deposit is presently open to the north 
(where it dips to depth), to the east, and to the west.  In addition, there is at least one untested 



    

- 8 - 

molybdenum occurrence (M Zone) which merits further investigation.  Further work is 
warranted. 
 
Columbia Yukon has planned an aggressive program (already underway) for 2008, including: 
 

 Up to 30,000 m of NQ diamond drilling, which will be laid out on 50 m x 50 m centres to 
delineate the deposit further to the west where there has been only very little (historic) 
drilling; 

 A Phase III environmental baseline study, including hydrological, climate, and wildlife 
(and habitat) assessments; 

 Metallurgical tests; and, 
 An updated NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate following the 2008 drill 

campaign. 
 
A laboratory has been contracted to independently prepare drill core sample on site, and all 
samples will be assayed for molybdenum only.  This will results in reduced shipping costs 
and much shorter analytical turn-around time, and the ability to monitor QA/QC results 
(blanks, standards and inter-laboratory results) on a timely basis. 
 
In WGM's opinion, Columbia Yukon's proposed program is very reasonable and appropriate.  
WGM, however, makes the specific recommendations, including: 
 

 Analysis for molybdenum oxide content in drill core, in the near-surface intervals (up to 
20-25 m) for those drillholes which form part of the Mineral Resource; and 

 Analysis of the remaining half of core for at least one complete, well-mineralized 
drillhole. 

 
Mintec noted that if a high grade zone that seems to be continuous through the center of the 
deposit can be better defined geologically or structurally with further drilling, the block grade 
smoothing that occurs from the interpolation can be minimized and the grade of the Mineral 
Resource estimates can be improved. 
 
A budget proposed by Columbia Yukon for the 2008 program is C$6,120,000, including a 
5% contingency and additional analytical work suggested by WGM.

2.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 
2.1  GENERAL 
 
In early 2007, Columbia Yukon Explorations Inc. ("Columbia Yukon"), 2489 Bellevue 
Avenue, West Vancouver, British Columbia V7E 1E1, retained Watts, Griffis and McOuat 
Limited ("WGM") to conduct a technical review of the Storie molybdenum deposit, in the 
Liard Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada, in which Columbia Yukon had the right to 
earn up to 100% interest, and to prepare a National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") 
compliant report.  The purpose of the WGM independent review and NI 43-101 report was to 
review the technical merits of the project, to identify fatal flaws, if any, carry out a program 
of independent check sampling, and prepare an NI 43-101 compliant Inferred Mineral 
Resource estimate.  Mr. Robert Kuehnbaum, Senior Associate Geologist of WGM, visited the 
Storie Property (the "Property") on April 24, 2007, and sampled drill core at an off-property 
site.  Discussions were held at the Property, at Columbia Yukon's facilities in Cassiar, and at 
the Vancouver office with J. Kowalchuk, P.Geo., Vice President Exploration of Columbia 
Yukon, regarding technical information about the Property.  This was reviewed in a previous 
WGM report by Kuehnbaum and Lindinger (2007). 
 
On July 11, 2007, Columbia Yukon retained WGM to conduct a similar technical review of 
the Storie deposit, and to prepare an updated NI 43-101 compliant report, including an 
NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate incorporating additional drillhole data 
derived from the 2007 exploration program.  Mr. Kuehnbaum again visited the Property on 
July 10 and 11, 2007, and sampled additional drill core.  Discussions were held with 
Mr. Kowalchuk, P.Geo., and other on-site geologists, including the project manager, 
regarding technical information about the Property. 
 
In February, 2008, Columbia Yukon retained Mintec, Inc. ("Mintec") of Tucson, Arizona, to 
prepare a Mineral Resource estimate for the Storie Deposit.  Mintec's report was provided to 
WGM and has been incorporated into this report. 
 
There has been a significant amount of exploration, including historic diamond drilling done 
on the Property by previous owners, and in 2006 and 2007 by Columbia Yukon, but 



    

- 10 - 

Columbia Yukon has done no engineering work, except initial metallurgical testing which is 
still in progress. 
 
The opinions and conclusions presented in this report are based on information received from 
Columbia Yukon.  WGM received full cooperation and assistance from Columbia Yukon 
during the site and office visits, and during preparation of this report. 
 
2.2  TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
This report is prepared in compliance with NI 43-101 and presents a review of the geology 
and Mineral Resources of the Storie molybdenum deposit in northern British Columbia.  
WGM did not review legal, environmental, political, surface rights, water rights or other non-
technical issues which might indirectly relate to this report as Columbia Yukon has retained 
legal counsel for these purposes. 
 
It is Columbia Yukon's intent to use this WGM report for filing on SEDAR, to have a 
Mineral Resource estimate compliant with the definitions and standards of NI 43-101 and the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM"), and for ongoing project 
financing. 
 
2.3  SOURCES OF INFORMATION 
 
Technical information in this report is derived from a variety of sources, including: 
 
1) assessment reports housed in the files of the British Columbia government;  
2) technical articles in scientific publications;  
3) lithological and geotechnical drill logs prepared in 2006 and 2007 by Columbia Yukon;  
4) an assessment report recently submitted by Columbia Yukon to British Columbia's 

Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources; and  
5) other files, such as analytical certificates, provided to WGM by Columbia Yukon. 
 
Documents in items 1) and 2) used in the preparation of this report, listed under "References", 
are available to the public. 
 



    

- 11 - 

WGM also had verbal discussions with professional geoscientists who have consulted and/or 
done field work for Columbia Yukon. 
 
Columbia Yukon has reviewed a previous draft of this report.  Nevertheless, this report is the 
responsibility of WGM which alone has been in charge of its overall presentation. 
 
2.4  UNITS AND CURRENCY 
 
Throughout this report, common measurements are in metric units.  Tonnages are shown as 
tonnes (1,000 kg), and million tonnes ("Mt"); other weights are in grams ("g").  Linear 
measurements are metres ("m") or kilometres ("km").  Metal contents are given as parts per 
million ("ppm") or percent ("%"); precious metal values (gold and silver) as grams per tonne 
("g Au/t" and "g Ag/t").  Areas are reported in hectares ("ha").  Volumetric measures are in 
millilitres ("mL"). 
 
All financial data are quoted in Canadian dollars ("C$"). 
 
2.5  DISCLAIMER 
 
This report or portions of this report are not to be reproduced or used for any purpose other 
than to fulfill Columbia Yukon's obligations pursuant to Canadian provincial securities 
legislation, including disclosure on System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval 
("SEDAR"), and if Columbia Yukon chooses to do so, to support a financing in Canada or 
elsewhere, without WGM's prior written permission in each specific instance.  WGM does

3.  RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
 
WGM reviewed a digital copy of the option agreement between Eveready Resources 
Corporation, the previous owner of the Storie Property and Columbia Yukon, but WGM has 
verified neither the validity nor the legality of the agreement.  The option has now been 
exercised, as outlined in Section 4.3. 
 
For WGM's 2007 report and this report, WGM has relied almost exclusively on:  
 
1) the "historic" work of previous operators of the Storie molybdenum project mostly during 

the period 1979 to 1980, summarized in several technical reports. 
2) a 2005 compilation by Velocity Resources Canada Ltd. of previous work.  
3) the results of Columbia Yukon's 2006 and 2007 drilling programs contained in their 

databases, as well as analytical spreadsheets and certificates. 
4) a report prepared by Columbia Yukon on the 2007 drill program and submitted to the 

government for assessment work credit (Wesa and Kowalchuk, 2008. 
 
Although WGM has been able to confirm very little of the historic work, it is WGM's opinion 
that the work was mostly done in a thorough and professional manner, although QA/QC 
procedures are not in line with current standards.  The historic exploration was done prior to 
the introduction of the concept of the "Qualified Person", but WGM has no information to 
suggest that the past operators and authors were not qualified by virtue of applicable 
experience or professional membership in an engineering association.  Columbia Yukon's 
2006 and 2007 exploration drilling programs were carried out under the direction of the 
Qualified Person for Columbia Yukon, Mr. John Kowalchuk, P.Geo., Vice President of 
Exploration.

4.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
 
4.1  LOCATION 
 
The Storie molybdenum deposit is situated in the Liard Mining Division, about 6 km 
southwest of the Town of Cassiar, British Columbia (Figure 1).  Cassiar is 540 km from 
tidewater at Stewart, British Columbia, 125 km north of Dease Lake, B.C., and 137 km from 
the Alaska Highway west of Watson Lake, Yukon Territory.  Cassiar is 1,190 air km from 
Vancouver. 
 
Geographic coordinates are 59°14'30"N latitude and 129°51'24"W longitude.  Magnetic 
declination is 23°40'E. 
 
4.2  LAND STATUS 
 
The Property consists of three mineral tenures listed in Table 1 and shown on Figure 2.  The 
Bunny and Pinks tenures, formerly "legacy claims" (see below), were previously 
100% owned by Eveready Resource Corporation ("Eveready"), but are now 100% owned by 
Columbia Yukon.  WGM reviewed the tenures in Table 1 on the Province of British 
Columbia's Mineral Titles Online ("MTO") website.

In 2005, the Province of British Columbia implemented MTO, an internet-based "mineral 
tenure online" system, whereby mineral tenures can be secured on-line for a fee of $2 per 
hectare.  The MTO grid is latitude-longitude referenced (NAD 27), based on National 
Topographic System maps.  Mineral rights may be acquired by registering a mineral claim 
"cell", which is a ¼ subdivision of a 30-second by 45-second "unit"; a cell varies in area from 
about 16 hectares to about 21 hectares, depending on its latitude.  Older claims, referred to as 
"legacy claims" were grandfathered, and their boundaries have priority until such time that 
they are converted to cell tenures. 
 
The BUNNY and PINKS tenures listed in Table 1 were originally "4-post" claims (now 
legacy claims), which pre-date the MTO system.  In December, 2007, Columbia Yukon 
converted the BUNNY and PINKS tenures into the MTO grid system.  In the process, the 
BUNNY2 tenure was acquired.  When a legacy claim is converted, it must fit into the cell 
grid system.  There is no obligation for a holder of any adjacent legacy claim to convert the 
claim to the cell grid system.  This may result in overlap between a cell tenure and an adjacent 
legacy claim.  On Figure 2, the lightly outlined areas on the north side of 571372, the east side 
of 571370, and most of 576613 are areas of overlap presently held by other parties, but which, 
if the neighbouring legacy claims are converted, will belong to Columbia Yukon.  Columbia 
Yukon has informed WGM that an arrangement has been made with Eveready whereby 
Eveready will convert its legacy claim to the north (395420) such that Columbia Yukon will 
acquire the overlap areas of tenures 571372 and 576613, and Columbia Yukon will then 
transfer title of tenure 576613 to Eveready. 
 
Annual assessment requirements for exploration work are $4 per hectare in each of the first 
three years after a tenure is issued, and $8 per hectare thereafter.  Assessment credits may be 
applied to give a mineral tenure an expiry date of up to 10 years ahead of the application date.  
An equal amount of cash may be paid in substitution for exploration expenditures (cash-in-
lieu).  An assessment filing fee of $0.40 per hectare per year is also required. 
 
Reporting of the 2007 work by Columbia Yukon has been filed for assessment credits; there 
will be credits sufficient to allow for moving the expiry date to 10 years in advance, the 
maximum allowable.  The unused remainder can be banked for future credits.

4.3  NATURE OF COLUMBIA YUKON'S INTEREST 
 
On March 20, 2006, Columbia Yukon entered into an option agreement to earn a 
100% interest in two claims referred to as the "Storie Property" from Eveready.  Under the 
terms of the option agreement, Columbia Yukon was granted the right to earn a 100% interest 
in the Property by spending a total of $4,000,000 on exploration, issuing 600,000 shares and 
paying Eveready $1,150,000 in cash over a five-year period.  As announced on 
October 16, 2007, Columbia Yukon accelerated its exploration program, share issuances and 
cash payments, and exercised the option.  Eveready retains a 2.5% net smelter return ("NSR") 
royalty; as outlined in the option agreement, Columbia Yukon may purchase part or all of the 
royalty at a rate of $1,600,000 per each 1.0% ($4,000,000 total). 
 
As discussed in the 2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007), the original option 
agreement with Eveready allowed Columbia Yukon the right to explore for any molybdenum 
occurrence or deposit discovered by Columbia Yukon on 40 units of neighbouring legacy 
claims ("Adjacent Claims"), as well as the right of first refusal, with respect to any potential 
sale, disposition of transfer of any of Eveready's rights, on a number of other mineral claims 
in the general area owned 100% by Eveready ("Right of First Refusal Claims").  Columbia 
Yukon's rights in respect of both the Adjacent Claims and Right of First Refusal Claims 
terminated when the option agreement with Eveready was exercised. 
 
4.4  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ISSUES 
 
New Jersey Zinc had left on the Property parts of their camp established during their 
exploration phase ending in about 1971.  During the 2006 exploration program, Columbia 
Yukon removed the remains of the old camp from the site; this was recognized by the 
Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources.  In 2007, Columbia Yukon removed all 
litter and refuse left by previous operators and contractors dating back to the 1960s; this work 
was documented and submitted to the government. 
 
It is WGM's understanding that, as outlined in the now-exercised option agreement between 
Eveready and Columbia Yukon, there were no discharges or spills of toxic or hazardous 
substances, and no toxic or hazardous substances were disposed of or treated on the Property 
prior to Columbia Yukon's first program in 2006.  As far as WGM is aware, none is presently 
stored there.  During the July, 2007, site visit, WGM observed only material and equipment 



    

- 18 - 

necessary for the ongoing Columbia Yukon drill program.  Columbia Yukon's exploration 
program is ongoing but 30% of the 2006 and 2007 drill stations were reclaimed in 2007. 
 
It is WGM's understanding, to the extent outlined in the now-exercised option agreement 
between Eveready and Columbia Yukon, that "there are no pending or ongoing actions taken 
by or on behalf of any native persons pursuant to the assertion of any land claims with 
respect to lands included in the Property." 
 
There is a settlement of the Good Hope Lake Band of the Kaska Dene First Nation at Good 
Hope Lake, approximately 35 km towards Watson Lake on Highway 37; the Cassiar area is 
within their traditional territory.  A number of band members were employed in the past at the 
Cassiar asbestos operations, and the band were receptive to Columbia Yukon's plans during 
informal discussions.  In 2007, Columbia Yukon initiated more formal dialogue with the 
Kaska Dene First Nation, on behalf of the Dease River Indian Band ("the Band"), which led 
to the announcement, on November 13, 2007, that Columbia Yukon had entered into a 
Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with the Band, which will cover the entire mineral 
exploration phase of the Columbia Yukon's Storie project, which is estimated to take the 
2008 and 2009 field seasons to complete. 
 
Under the MOU, Columbia Yukon has agreed to make a number of financial contributions 
and work-related opportunities available to the Band, and the Band has agreed to support the 
exploration of the Storie Property.  As part of the MOU, Columbia Yukon and the Band also 
agreed to promptly commence additional negotiations towards concluding a detailed Socio-
Economic Participation Agreement that is intended to cover a broad range of interests related 
to the potential future development of a mine on the Storie Property, including economic and 
business opportunities, skill development and training for the Band, as well as establishing 
protocols for environmental monitoring and protection and conservation of the Band's 
cultural heritage.  The Band and Columbia Yukon intend to have the Participation Agreement 
in place well before a feasibility study for the Storie Property is finalized. 
 
In 2006, Columbia Yukon commissioned Dillon Consulting Limited of Richmond, British 
Columbia ("Dillon"), to carry out an initial environmental baseline study, which consisted of 
a surface water quality program and preliminary literature and background information 
review.  The water sampling was done at selected sites in and around the project area, and 
monthly sampling (except winter) was done at six sites.  Measured parameters included 



    

- 19 - 

conventional water quality (e.g., pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids), sulphates, nutrients 
and metals (total and dissolved).  In 2007, a second phase study was done, also by Dillon, 
including:  
 
1) continued water sampling at the same sites. 
2) hydrological studies using water level loggers in three drainages. 
3) the installation of two climate stations at the Cassiar townsite and in the drilling area on 

the Property, with the recording of information throughout the summer and winter 
months. 

4) fisheries habitat assessment and fish sampling in drainages in the area (no fish found). 
5) benthic invertebrate sampling at four locations in drainages. 
6) identification of wildlife, particularly large mammals, and habitat use. 
 
WGM has reviewed two documents which only outlined the work done, but detailed results of 
the studies to date are not available.  Dillon has informed WGM that work proposed for 2008 
includes: continuation of the water sampling; hydrological (water level) studies; climate 
monitoring; additional fish sampling and studies; and expanded wildlife and vegetation 
studies, including amphibians, birds (spring breeding species and raptors) and species at risk.  
In addition, Dillon anticipates an archaeological study; traditional use/ecological studies; 
groundwater, geochemical assessments (the latter to address potential acid rock drainage); 
and socioeconomic baseline studies, in addition to First Nations and community 
consultations. 
 
4.5  PERMITS 
 
The 2007 drilling program was carried out under permit(s) from the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines and Petroleum Resources.   
 
On March 17, 2008, Columbia Yukon submitted a Mineral & Coal Notice of Work and 
Reclamation Program ("NoW") for proposed 2008 drilling – up to 40,000 m in 145 holes, 
including 19 holes permitted but not completed in 2007 – along with an Emergency Response 
Plan.  The NoW is the only application necessary, as it covers aspects of land disturbance and 
reclamation (drill set-ups, access trails, sumps and settling ponds), water use, timber cutting 
and occupational first aid, amongst other items. 
 



    

- 20 - 

On May 15, 2008, authorization under a "Mineral & Coal Exploration Activities & 
Reclamation Permit" was received by Columbia Yukon.  A reclamation security deposit of 
$15,000 made in 2006 was increased to $25,000 for the 2008 program. 
 
Upon completion of any year's field work, an "Annual Summary of Work for Exploration 
Activities" must be completed and submitted to the government.

5.  ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
5.1  ACCESS 
 
Cassiar is connected to Highway 37 by a 15 km macadamized paved road.  Highway 37, a 
two-lane paved road in very good condition, provides access to the Alaska Highway (120 km 
from the Cassiar cutoff), Watson Lake, Yukon (143 km), and Dease Lake and Stewart, British 
Columbia.  Watson Lake (population about 1,500, including the Liard First Nation) is the 
nearest commercial centre.  The closest major centre for supplies is Whitehorse, Yukon. 
 
A 1,200 m long gravel airstrip is located three kilometres from Cassiar.  It was occasionally 
used by Cusac Gold Mines Ltd. prior to the closure of the Table Mountain Mine in late 2007; 
it is now used infrequently, but is in very good condition.  AlkanAir, based in Whitehorse, is 
available for a charter into the Cassiar airstrip.  Casual helicopter service is available from 
Dease Lake and Whitehorse.  Columbia Yukon has acquired the surface rights to the airstrip. 
 
The Property is accessible by four wheel drive vehicle from the Cassiar airstrip, on a 5-km 
loose surface road.  The road was repaired for the 2006 drilling campaign, and was upgraded 
for the 2007 program.  Winter access into the Property would be possible by bulldozing the 
road. 
 
5.2  CLIMATE AND VEGETATION 
 
An interior west-coast type climate – with moderate to high precipitation of just over 40 cm 
annually, warm summers and cold winters – typifies the area.  Temperatures at the elevations 
and latitude of the Property vary from -35° to -40°C in January (winter average -10° to -
15°C), to 25° to 32°C in the summer (summer average 20°C).  The property is usually snow-
free from late June to mid-September, although the exploration season is somewhat longer.  
Some snow on the uppermost northeast facing slopes may remain year round. 
 
The Property is above treeline, and vegetation is limited to alpine grass, shrubs and other low-
lying vegetation.  Cassiar is not far below the local treeline.  Although the region has been 
glaciated, there is little glacial debris; much of the area is talus-covered.  Soil is poorly 
developed, and there is only scattered bedrock exposure. 



    

- 22 - 

 
5.3  LOCAL RESOURCES 
 
The former asbestos mine at Cassiar, operated by Cassiar Asbestos, closed in 1992.  At its 
peak, Cassiar had a population of about 1,500, but when mining ceased, most of the townsite 
was removed.  A church, hockey arena, four mine-era apartment blocks and the former mill 
building are still standing.  The tramline which transported ore from the asbestos mine to the 
mill was purchased, but the buyer has left it standing. 
 
Camp facilities are seasonably available in Cassiar.  The four apartment blocks at the east end 
of town are operational for ongoing site reclamation work.  Columbia Yukon used one of 
them in 2006 and 2007 for crew housing, and has leased the entire camp facilities for 2008 
and 2009.  Jade is extracted on a seasonal basis from the Cassiar asbestos waste dumps. 
 
Electrical supply in Cassiar is locally supplied by two diesel generators.  The nearest point of 
a British Columbia electrical grid is the town of Stewart, some 350 km to the south.  Watson 
Lake has diesel-generated electricity for local use only. 
 
There is not a large established mining-trained labour force in the general area.  Cusac Gold 
Mines Ltd. employed general labour from around Cassiar and Watson Lake, but most skilled 
miners were from other regions. 
 
Delineation of the Storie Deposit is still in the middle stages, and in-depth consideration has 
not been given to possible locations for waste rock and tailings storage, or a plant site.  
Nevertheless, the site of the abandoned mill in Cassiar could potentially be used for a new 
mill. 
 
There are two ponds in the saddle at the base of the slope of the Storie Deposit. The larger 
pond, about 20 m across, was probably the main source of water for earlier drilling 
campaign(s), and was used by Columbia Yukon for the 2006 and 2007 drilling programs.  
Water was taken from Troutline Creek during the Cassiar asbestos mining period, and water 
flows year-round.

5.4  PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
Elevation on the main area of interest on the Property varies from about 1,400 to 1,750 m.  
The area consists mostly of a gentle, north-facing slope averaging 33o, crossed by drill access 
roads, which terminates in the south by steep cliffs above moderate slopes which fall into 
Lang Creek valley.  The relief on this peak is unusually subdued compared with the much 
more severe terrain of the neighbouring slopes; east and west of the main area of interest, 
elevations rise quickly (see Figure 2).

6.  HISTORY 
 
 
Historic exploration covering the period 1959 to 2005, including resource estimates in 1979 
and 1980 by Shell Canada was thoroughly reviewed in the 2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum 
and Lindinger, 2007).  No new information has been located.

7.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
 
7.1  REGIONAL/LOCAL GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
 
Aspects of regional geology, as well as local geology and mineralization, were reviewed in 
the 2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007).  Figure 3 from the previous report 
is reproduced herein to reflect the revised Columbia Yukon property boundaries. 
 
7.2  PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
 
7.2.1  LITHOLOGIC UNITS 
 
The following discussion of the geology, alteration and structure of the Storie Deposit and 
surroundings is based mostly on historic work done up to 1980, but has been modified by 
Columbia Yukon on observations from the logging of the 2007 drill core as well as 
petrographic analysis.  Columbia Yukon has also created a series of geological sections 
through the deposit. 
 
Smitheringale (1980) and Bloomer and Gourlay (1980), following each of Shell Canada's 
drilling programs, described four main mappable intrusive rock units (see Figure 4), all 
classified as quartz monzonite, and distinguishable on the basis of color, grain size, and 
phenocryst content; two of the units were assigned sub-units.  The following is from 
Columbia Yukon (Wesa and Kowalchuk, 2008). 
 
Unit 1 - Porphyritic Quartz Monzonite:  This is the uppermost unit.  It is light pinkish-grey, 
generally unaltered, and mostly coarse-grained.  It consists of plagioclase, K-feldspar and 
quart, and minor biotite and opaque minerals.  Large (>4 cm) K-feldspar phenocrysts, 
comprising 20-50% of the rock, sit in a medium-grained groundmass.  The unit locally 
contains narrow intervals of Unit 2. 
 
Unit 2A – Quart Monzonite:  This unit is distinguished by phenocrysts of K-feldspar, 
plagioclase and quartz (5-10%) in a groundmass of fine-grained, pale to medium grey quartz 
and biotite.  Feldspar varies in size from 0.5 to 3 cm, and there are some Rapakivi-textured 
phenocrysts of K-feldspar rimmed by plagioclase. 







    

- 28 - 

Unit 2B – Quartz Monzonite:  This is an uncommon lithology, and is compositionally the 
same as Unit 2A, but is distinguished by clusters of coarse-grained biotite.  Bloomer and 
Gourlay (1980) described "bimodal biotite" occurring as 2-3 mm clusters of flakes and as 
<1 mm flakes in the groundmass, imparting a distinct "pepper biotite" texture. 
 
Unit 3A – Quartz Monzonite:  This most prominent unit in the Storie Deposit consists of 
intergrown K-feldspar, plagioclase and quartz, with minor biotite and opaque minerals.  It is 
light pinkish-grey, non-porphyritic to K-feldspar-quartz-porphyritic, but is dominantly 
medium-grained (2-8 mm) and K-feldspar-porphyritic.  It locally resembles Units 2 and 4. 
 
Unit 3B – Quartz Monzonite:  This unit is transitional between Units 3A and 4.  It consists 
of medium-grained K-feldspar, plagioclase and quartz.  It is distinguishable from Unit 3A by 
its pink colour from more abundant groundmass K-feldspar.  Locally, the unit contains fine- 
to medium-grained euhedral quartz, in which case may be a coarse-grained variation of Unit 
4. 
 
Unit 4 – Quartz-Feldspar Porphyry:  This is lowermost unit in the deposit area.  It consists 
of a pink, fine-grained groundmass with variable amounts of 1-5 mm phenocrysts of quartz 
(eyes), K-feldspar and plagioclase.  Bloomer and Gourlay (1980) noted that the groundmass is 
saccharoidal. 
 
Contacts are generally abrupt gradations that are characterized by changes in groundmass size 
and changes in phenocryst content and size.  These gradations take place in zones that range 
in size from 10 cm to 2-3 m.  Locally, aplite lenses up to several metres in thickness mark the 
contacts.  The contact between Unit 3 and Unit 4 shows the greatest variation from 
gradational to abruptly gradational to zones where it is masked by shearing, slickensides, and 
brecciation. 
 
Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008) note that, although Storie Deposit molybdenum mineralization 
occurs in all rock types, most of the elevated molybdenum grades occur in Units 3 and 4. 
 
7.2.2  STRUCTURE 
 
The Storie Deposit is cut by northerly and easterly trending faults reflecting regional trends.  
The most prominent structure is the Crone Fault, a marked topographic feature which cuts the 



    

- 29 - 

deposit at 055° to 060° and dips at about 60° to the northwest (Figure 4).  Bloomer and 
Gourlay (1980) interpret that normal movement with a dip-slip component of approximately 
100 m downthrow to the north.  Other northerly trending and easterly trending faults have 
been inferred from the juxtaposition of Units 2 and 3 at surface. 
 
Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008) report a splayed, northeasterly striking fault that crosses the 
Crone Fault just east of drillhole ST07-66. 
 
In drill core, the faults appear as shears with gouge seams, slickensided fractures.  These 
zones are numerous and not easily correlated between drillholes.  The boundaries between 
lithological units appear to be favoured sites for faulting and shearing.  In general, faulting 
has further complicated the contact relationships between the units.  Few of the structures 
have been identified on the surface.  Crushed or breccia zones adjacent to slickensided 
fractures are common; some are macrobreccia, while others consist of a stockwork-like 
pattern of closely-spaced hairline fractures (Bloomer and Gourlay, 1980; Smitheringale, 
1980). 
 
The faulting has not severely displaced the deposit but has, however, locally disrupted the 
mineralization, as illustrated by mechanically-dispersed molybdenite in black clay in gouge 
zones, slickensided molybdenite fractures, and broken molybdenite bearing quartz veins.  
Brecciation is regarded as post mineralization and related to faulting.  It is noteworthy that the 
mineralization has long been considered to be best developed in the porphyry unit 
(e.g. Panteleyev, 1979) but Shell Canada considered that there is a strong structural influence; 
Columbia Yukon concurs that structure may be a significant control or influence. 
 
Pautler (2005) includes a map which shows the "X Fault", a structure roughly parallel to the 
Crone Fault.  It passes southern edge of the Storie Deposit in the area of the southernmost 
historic drillholes (Figure 3).  No mention of the X Fault is made in either of the Shell Canada 
reports, but it may be significant since it appears to be in proximity to the m Zone 
molybdenum occurrence.  A structural analysis based on an aeromagnetic survey flown on 
behalf of Coast Silver in 1969 (Crosby, 1969) shows a number of interpreted east-northeast-
trending (as well as north-northwest-trending) faults, two of which seem to correlate well 
with the Crone and X Faults; this may explain the original identification of the X Fault.

7.2.3  ALTERATION 
 
According to Smitheringale (1980), alteration in the Storie Deposit consists of: 1) widespread 
slight to moderate sericitization of plagioclase; 2) local more intense sericitization and 
kaolinization of plagioclase and K-feldspar; 3) widespread pyritization (disseminated and in 
fractures); 4) the development of 1 mm to 10 cm quartz veins; 5) the development of 
K-feldspar muscovite-quartz-pyrite bands adjacent to gently north-dipping fractures; and 
6) uncommon pervasive silicification in 0.5 to 2 m thick zones.  Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008) 
report that phyllic (quartz-sericite±carbonate) alteration is commonly pervasive in zones from 
metres to tens of metres wide, and that it is typically superimposed on potassic-silicic 
alteration; argillic (kaolinite) alteration typically overprints other alteration types. 
 
Smitheringale was unable to correlate alteration from drillhole to drillhole, and concluded that 
there was no discernable zonation to alteration patterns, with only a local exception at the 
northern end of the deposit.  The poor hole-to-hole correlation has been confirmed by 
Columbia Yukon (Wesa and Kowalchuk, 2008).  If the structures are responsible for 
influencing the distribution of alteration and mineralization, it is quite possible that the 
generally steeply-inclined drillholes have crossed alteration boundaries at angles too low to 
make hole-to-hole correlation possible. 
 
Columbia Yukon has interpreted that alteration associated with faulting is primarily chloritic 
with local chlorite porphyroblasts, a type not described by Shell Canada but observed by 
WGM in the drill core.  It is likely that this type of hydrothermal alteration is post mineral.  
Post mineral, fault-related alteration, including chlorite, has been described from the Ruby 
Creek molybdenum deposit in the Atlin area (Blower, 2005).  In addition, complete clay 
(argillic) alteration of plagioclase occurs on the hangingwall (north) side of the Crone Fault.

8.  DEPOSIT TYPE 
 
 
The characteristics and distribution of porphyry molybdenum deposits were reviewed in the 
2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007).

9.  MINERALIZATION 
 
 
The following is based on observations by Panteleyev (1979), Smitheringale (1980) and 
Bloomer and Gourlay (1980), with recent observations by Columbia Yukon geologists (Wesa 
and Kowalchuk, 2008). 
 
The Storie Deposit consists of interconnecting, tabular to lensoid zones of mineralization, 
thinner at the southern end, generally dipping and thickening to the north; the zones generally 
strike west-southwest and dip moderately (15° to 45°) to the north-northwest.  As currently 
defined by drilling, the lateral dimensions are approximately 700 m by 600 m, slightly 
elongated with an east-west direction. 
 
Columbia Yukon has identified a higher–grade zone covering an area of about 200 m x 400 m 
within the Mineral Resource area, which is defined by 30 historic and Columbia Yukon 
drillholes on 50 m centres.  Within this area, drillhole intercepts vary from 0.067% Mo across 
118.9 m (158.5 to 277.4 m) in historic Shell Canada hole 79-2, to 0.110% Mo across 139 m 
(59 to 198 m) in Columbia Yukon hole ST07-72.  This higher-grade area appears to be 
dipping to the west. 
 
As noted above, mineralization is concentrated along intrusive contacts, where movement has 
occurred.  Although there are narrow mineralized quartz veinlets at the Storie Deposit, 
Panteleyev (1979) interpreted that the deposit lacks breccia zones and large-scale quartz 
stockworks or vein systems typical of porphyry molybdenum deposits, and mineralization 
appears to have taken place in a high-temperature, vapour-dominated environment with low 
overall water content. 
 
Molybdenite, the only economic mineral present, occurs as coatings on fracture surfaces, as 
selvages on or within 0.1 to 2 mm quartz (-pyrite) veinlets, and as grains and smears along 
slip surfaces and slickensided fractures.  Some coarse rosette molybdenite occurs in easterly-
trending quartz veins south of the Crone Fault.  There are small pockets of disseminated 
mineralization in quartz-feldspar porphyry, which suggests that the porphyry is the last 
intrusive phase.  Some molybdenite is also present as microscopic grains interstitial to 
muscovite and altered feldspars in fresh rock (usually Units 1 and 2).  Smitheringale (1980) 
noted that, up to the end of the 1979 program, there was no correlation between the zone of 



    

- 33 - 

mineralization and a particular rock type, but that significant mineralization had been found 
only within a region containing intervals of soft green and opaque white, saussuritized 
plagioclase.  Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008) confirm the association of significant 
mineralization with the alteration, but also note that the mineralization preferentially occurs in 
Units 3 and 4 (Section 7.2.1). 
 
Following the 1979 Shell Canada program, Smitheringale (1980) studied the fracture system, 
including joints, veinlets, slickensides, black clay fault gouge and K-feldspar alteration bands.  
Fracture or veinlet fillings include quartz, pyrite, green muscovite, gypsum or anhydrite, 
chlorite, pink K-feldspar, sparse fluorite (with muscovite) and beryl, limonite and a secondary 
molybdenum oxide mineral (ferrimolybdite).  Fluorite occurs locally with coarse-grained 
muscovite in fractures.  The mineral most commonly associated with molybdenite is pyrite.  
A K/Ar radiometric date of 71.4±2.5 Ma was reported from sericite from a mineralized vein. 
 
The predominant set of fractures strikes east-northeast and dips to the northwest.  There is 
also a steeply inclined set of fractures that were intersected at angles to core axis of mostly 
>25° in moderately inclined (-60°) drillholes in 1971, but at mostly <15° in older vertical 
holes; this, combined with a study of fractures in outcrop, led to a decision by Shell Canada to 
drillholes at -70° at an orientation of 170°. 
 
Smitheringale (1980) analyzed the fracture orientations (angles to core axis) in the 1979 
drillholes; there is significant variation in relative proportions and attitudes of vein sets across 
the deposit.  No mention is made of oriented core. 
 
There is a good correlation between MoS2 content and fracture density, which demonstrated 
to Smitheringale that the most important mode of molybdenite mineralization is in fractures. 
 
Ferrimolybdite, typically an oxidation product of molybdenite, occurs in the near-surface 
segments of some drillholes, as well as in surface mineralization.  Its presence is noteworthy 
because the molybdenum which it contains is included in standard molybdenum analyses, but 
it cannot be recovered by standard flotation techniques.  Shell Canada analyzed for 
molybdenum oxide in the first five drillholes in their 1979 program, and found "insignificant 
amounts", except in the top 20 m of several holes where the proportion of molybdenum oxide 
to total molybdenum varied from a few percent to 50%.  Below 20 m, most samples contained 
<0.001% oxide, and only a few samples contained more than 0.002% (maximum 0.005%) 



    

- 34 - 

(Smitheringale, 1980).  Columbia Yukon has not so far analyzed for molybdenum oxide, 
which would be of significance only in drillholes where the upper 20 m are included in the 
Mineral Resource Estimate.  WGM recommends that Columbia Yukon identify which holes 
are thus affected and analyze those parts of drillholes for molybdenum oxide. 
 
Significantly, Pautler (2002, 2005) briefly discussed the "M Zone" about 1 km east of the 
Storie Deposit.  In 1968, Coast Silver is reported to have completed a four-hole diamond 
drilling program just within the Cassiar Stock on the X Fault, a structure parallel to the Crone 
Fault.  Bloomer (1980) reported that mineralization is similar to that in the Storie Deposit 
(disseminations and fracture fillings of molybdenite with sericite, pyrite, gypsum, quartz and 
fluorite) but it is erratic, and the drillholes intersected generally less than 0.1% MoS2.  
Bloomer's description had conflicting reports of an intersection of 0.23% MoS2 over 130 m 
and/or 0.23% MoS2 over 5 m in one hole (M-2); only portions of the core were split and 
assayed.  These data cannot be confirmed, but the occurrence should be investigated. 
 
As shown in historic and recent drilling, mineralization, where present, is reasonably 
consistent; high-grade "spikes" are not numerous, and tend to occur in isolated 3 m intervals 
within longer sections of mineralization.  "Spikes" surrounded by very low-grade rock also 
occur in the upper and lower parts of the deposit.

10.  EXPLORATION 
 
 
10.1  2006 PROGRAM 
 
Work by Columbia Yukon in 2006 was mostly limited to the diamond drilling discussed in 
Section 11. 
 
In 2006, a LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) topographic survey was flown over the 
area.  LIDAR is an airborne survey which uses laser light detection tied to a ground-based 
location established in the area.  It is capable of penetrating vegetation and producing true 
"ground" elevations; also, it is insensitive to light shadows in steep terrane which are 
problematic to photograph-based topographic systems. 
 
10.2  2007 PROGRAM 
 
Although the majority of work done by Columbia Yukon in 2007 was diamond drilling 
(Section 11), geophysical surveying and accurate geographic surveying were also done. 
 
During the 2007 field season, Columbia Yukon contracted, to Ridge Resources of Smithers, 
British Columbia, the establishment of a 41-km picketed and GPS-surveyed grid over the 
known extent of the deposit and beyond, including the steep slopes descending to the south 
into the valley of Lang Creek.  From August 8 to 29 and September 22 to October 11, another 
contractor, Peter E. Walcott and Associates, completed 19.5 km of 3-Dimensional Induced 
Polarization ("IP") surveying over this grid.  The survey was designed to locate other 
potentially mineralizing structures similar to the Crone Fault such as the X Fault, which had 
been interpreted to trend parallel to, and south of, the Crone Fault (see Section 7.2.2).  The IP 
survey succeeded in locating the position of both the Crone Fault and X-Fault (Wesa and 
Kowalchuk, 2008).  Weather conditions in October caused the survey to be stopped when less 
than 50% of the planned survey had been completed.  The contractor has not provided a 
written report, and the results of the survey are not further discussed herein. 
 
The historic drillholes had been ground-surveyed in the past in the NAD 27 UTM system, and 
Columbia Yukon transposed the coordinates into NAD 83 (Zone 9), the UTM system in 
current use throughout British Columbia.  The 2006 drillhole collars for the 2007 Mineral 



    

- 36 - 

Resource estimate were located using a hand-held GPS instrument, with accuracy of probably 
no better than 5 m.  During the latter part of September, 2007, Columbia Yukon contracted 
AllNorth Consultants Ltd., from Prince George, British Columbia, to complete a high-
resolution GPS survey of main access roads, trails, historic and recent drill collars and the 
Cassiar airstrip.

11.  DRILLING 
 
 
11.1  2006 PROGRAM 
 
Between August 11 and October 12, 2006, a total of 4,953 m of NQ diamond drilling in 
20 holes were done by Columbia Yukon on the Storie Deposit.  All holes were collared at an 
azimuth of 170° (S10°E), inclined at -70°.  All holes except one were set up close to (mostly 
less than 10 m away from) Shell Canada or older historic drillholes, with the intent of 
twinning the historic holes.  During the April, 2007, WGM site visit, all 2006 drill collars 
were buried under snow, and there was some confusion over the location of ST06-11 since its 
identification post was found beside the collar of historic hole 79-7; as a result, the previous 
WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007) incorrectly reported ST06-11 and 79-07 as 
twinned holes, whereas they are in fact approximately 66 m apart. 
 
Drillhole deviation was determined with a single-shot Reflex EZ-Shot digital survey 
instrument.  Drill runs were measured in feet, necessitating the conversion of core box tag 
intervals to metric measurements prior to logging.  Locations of 2006 drillholes were 
determined by a hand-held GPS unit. 
 
Additional details of the drilling techniques and mineralized intervals are presented in the 
2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007).   
 
11.2  2007 PROGRAM 
 
Between June 6 and November 3, 2007, a total of 23,073 m of NQ diamond drilling in 
76 holes was done by Columbia Yukon on the Storie Deposit.  Five of the drillholes were lost 
and rods were left in the holes.  In addition, hole ST07-92 reached a depth of only 28 m 
before the onset of winter forced its abandonment.  During the campaign, there were up to 
four drill rigs on the Property at the same time, provided by DJ Drilling, based in Watson 
Lake, Yukon, and FB Drilling Services, based in Cranbrook, British Columbia. 
 
Nineteen of the drillholes were drilled with the objective of potentially expanding the zone of 
mineralization beyond the "historic" area of known mineralization, in particular to the east 
and south, and on structural targets south of and parallel to the Crone Fault.  Fifty-four of the 



    

- 38 - 

drillholes were for infill drilling with the objective of upgrading Mineral Resources from the 
Inferred category of the 2007 estimate by WGM.  Three drillholes twinned 2006 drillholes, 
with the objective of analyzing whole core to determine the extent of molybdenum loss, if 
any, during core sawing. 
 
As with the 2006 and most of the historic holes, the 2007 holes were collared at an azimuth of 
170° (S10°E), inclined at -70°.  Two of the holes were collared at an azimuth of 145° (S35°E) 
and inclined at -55° to cross the Crone Fault at a higher, more favourable angle than by the 
normal orientation. 
 
Standard wireline drilling techniques, with a 10-foot (3.05-m) NQ core barrel, were used 
throughout the 2007 campaign.  One of the 2007 twin drillholes was completed with HQ drill 
equipment; it encountered difficult ground, and was lost prematurely at a depth of 249 m. 
 
Polymers and muds were used with the objective of maximizing recovery.  In addition, the 
drill contract stipulated that a certain recovery was to be achieved for each drillhole.  During 
the 2007 program, drill cuttings (sludge samples) were recovered from nine holes to test for 
the degree of molybdenite loss from fracture surfaces.  In addition, sludges generated during 
the sawing of core were sampled in order to test for the potential preferential loss of 
molybdenite during the cutting operation. The results of the drill and saw sludge sampling are 
discussed in Section 12.5. 
 
The casing of each drillhole was left in the hole and cut off 10 to 30 cm above ground level.  
A painted post was wedged into the top of casing, and the hole number affixed on a metal (or 
equivalent) label.  In 2007, Columbia Yukon surveyed all drillhole collars from the 1979 and 
1980 Shell Canada programs and the Columbia Yukon 2006 and 2007 campaigns, using high-
resolution GPS in the UTM system used throughout British Columbia, NAD 83 (Zone 9). 
 
Drillhole deviation was determined mostly with an Icefield instrument, some with a Reflex 
EZ-Shot survey instrument.  Measurements were normally taken at about 50% of the hole 
depth and at the toe.  Three or four measurements were taken in three longer holes, and only 
one reading taken at the toe or part way down in six holes.  Vertical deflections were mostly 
minor: between 3° downward and 8° upward, but mostly between 0° and 4° upward.  Lateral 
deflections were overall moderate: one hole deflected 6° to the left, while all others deflected 
between 1° and 23° to the right.  These deflections are much greater than those from the 2006

drilling.  Surveying instruments often have programming to record magnetic intensity 
(susceptibility), but no record was kept by Columbia Yukon to determine if magnetic minerals 
(pyrrhotite and magnetite) might be the cause of some of the larger lateral deflections.  
However, magnetic minerals have not been reported from the Storie Deposit.  Measurements 
were not taken in drillholes ST07-21 because of malfunctioning equipment, or in the five lost 
holes. 
 
Drill runs were measured in feet, necessitating the conversion of core box tag intervals to 
metric measurements prior to logging. 
 
Density measurements were done on 121 core samples by SGS Canada Inc. ("SGS"), using 
the wax-coating, water displacement method.  Samples were selected from historic Shell 
Canada (1979-1980) drillholes, as well as 2006 and 2007 Columbia Yukon drillholes.  
Densities of individual samples vary from 2.35 to 3.02 g/cm3, and average 2.59 g/cm3.  For 
the Mineral Resource estimate (Section 17), Mintec interpolated density values into the 
blocks using the available drillhole density data.  The density values received were 
composited using 10 m benches and interpolated with an Inverse Distance Squared weighting 
method.  A weighted average of 121 densities was calculated to be approximately 2.6 g/cm3 
and used as a background value for the 3-D model blocks with no assigned density value.  A 
density of 2.6 g/cm3 was used by WGM in the 2007 report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 
2007). 
 
Neither WGM (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007) nor Mintec (this report) found any 
correlation of density with grade of molybdenum mineralization. 
 
Samples of historic and recent drill core from across the deposit were selected and sent by 
Columbia Yukon to Vancouver, B.C., metallurgy laboratory of SGS, for the purpose of 
providing a representative composite sample for metallurgical testing.  In addition, three 
intervals from the single HQ 2007 drillhole, totalling 10 m, were submitted to SGS, but these 
are being held in reserve; the remainder of the whole core was analyzed. 
 
During 2007, Columbia Yukon moved all historic drill core from previous storage locations, 
along with 2006 and 2007 core, into the former hockey arena in Cassiar.  This freed the core 
racks in the logging facility for the large amount of projected 2008 core.

12.  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
 
12.1   GEOTECHNICAL LOGGING 
 
In 2006 and 2007, the collection of geotechnical data was completed as outlined in 
"Geotechnical Data Collection for Exploration Geologists", Field Procedures Manual – Non-
Oriented Core. 
 
All logging and sampling was done in a steel-clad building, the former dry of the Cassiar 
asbestos mine.  The building, leased by Columbia Yukon, was kept locked when not in use. 
 
Separate Excel spreadsheet geotechnical logs were kept for each drillhole.  Core was re-
assembled in core boxes to best fit, and the length of core between drillers blocks (normally 
3.05 m apart) was measured to determine core recovery.  Rock quality designation ("RQD") 
was also determined over the same interval by measuring the cumulative length of pieces of 
competent core 10 cm or greater in length; this is normally expressed as a percentage of each 
3.05 m interval. 
 
A first reasonable estimate of compressive strength, or hardness, was done for each interval 
with a field identification test, using simple mechanical tests with finger, knife or geological 
hammer. 
 
A visual and subjective degree of breakage number, based on the mean spacing of breaks or 
the diameter of fragments, was also assigned to each 3.05 m interval.  There are six categories 
describing from fault gouge with minor rock fragments (size <0.5 inch) to broken rock with 
fracture spacing <2 in (<5 cm), and a further nine categories reflect increasing mean sizes or 
spacings of fractures. 
 
A "degree of weathering" category was also assigned to each interval.  The number of joints 
or fractures in each core run (joint frequency) was also counted and recorded. 
 
The bulk of the geotechnical data had not been processed or compiled by Columbia Yukon at 
the time of writing of this report.

12.2  LITHOLOGICAL LOGGING AND SAMPLING 
 
No information on sampling techniques is available for surface work or drilling prior to 1979.  
During the Shell Canada programs in 1979 and 1980, core was split with a mechanical 
splitter, with one-half retained.  Sampling length was 10 ft (3.05 m).  Overall core recoveries 
were reported to be about 95%. 
 
For the 2006 program, after geotechnical logging, drill core was marked at 1 m intervals 
throughout each drillhole.  The core was then descriptively logged onto a Word-based form, 
and photographed (four boxes at a time).  The descriptive logs include: rock types; alteration 
types and relationships; locations and orientations of veins, fractures and other structural 
features; and sulphide mineralization.  Coded logs were prepared for drillhole ST-06-01 
to -03, but this practice was not continued through the remainder of the 2006 program. 
 
During the 2007 program, logging was done on spreadsheets, with information recorded about 
lithological description, structure (faults and shears), alteration and mineralogy (sulphides and 
veining) in columns in simplified form.  A coded log was prepared for hole ST07-21, but the 
logging process was found slow in the field, and was discontinued. 
 
Lithologic boundaries or structural features were not a factor in the selection of sampling 
intervals.  All mineralization was marked for continuous sampling over 3 m intervals, 
coinciding with the metre marks, with few exceptions; this compares with historic sampling 
done on 10-ft (3.05 m) intervals.  In accordance with normal sampling procedures, each 
interval was recorded in an assay tag book, and a removable portion of that sample's tag 
fastened to the core box.  In 2006, the tag was placed at the end of the sample interval; in 
2007, at the beginning of the interval.  Sample intervals were marked on the core with a china 
marker, with a line scribed for sawing. 
 
The core was cut in half with a rock saw, and half the core placed, with the remaining 
numbered tag, into a numbered plastic sample bag.  Sample identification numbers and their 
intervals from the sample tags recorded into a spreadsheet and all tag books archived. 
 
Badly broken intervals were generally sawed.  If the core was very crumbly, however, a 
spoon was used to extract about half of the material; this may have resulted in a non-
representative sample in some cases.  For the 2008 program, a commercial laboratory has 



    

- 42 - 

been contracted to install facilities and provide personnel to crush and split samples at the 
Cassiar facility; an on-site riffle splitter could be used to make the division of crumbly 
intervals much more systematic. 
 
In 2006 and 2007, Columbia Yukon did not re-sample any of the remaining halves of core to 
check for the amount of molybdenite loss, if any, during the sawing procedure.  In 2007, 
however, saw sludges were collected from a number of holes (Section 12.5.1).  In the field, a 
second tag (the next number in the sample sequence) was inserted into about every 20th 
(2006) or 30th (2007) sample bag, signifying to the laboratory that they were to prepare and 
analyze another sample from a second split of the coarse reject. 
 
In 2006, one of a set of three standards was placed into the sample sequence, as well as a 
blank sample.  In 2007, only one standard was used.  This is more fully described in Sections 
13.4 and 13.5. 
 
For delivery to the lab, samples were placed in numerical order and put into large rice (fibre) 
bags which were sealed with heavy-duty plastic zip locks.  A numbered security tie was then 
added to each rice bag.  The samples were kept in the logging facility which was locked 
overnight. 
 
When a sufficient number of samples had accumulated to comprise as a single shipment, the 
shipment was given an identification number, and the fibre bags of that shipment were 
tabulated by their security tags and the sample identification numbers (assay tags) contained 
in each bag.  The group of bags selected for that shipment was photographed. 
 
Samples were delivered by a Columbia Yukon technician in a company vehicle to Dease Lake 
where they were shipped by freight truck.  In 2006, the samples went to Eco Tech Laboratory 
Ltd. ("Eco Tech") in Kamloops, British Columbia; in 2007, to Acme Analytical Laboratories 
Ltd. ("Acme") in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
 
In 2006, a total of 1,621 drill core samples were taken and analyzed; in 2007, a total of 7,907 
core samples were taken for analysis, exclusive of laboratory resplits (duplicates), Columbia 
Yukon duplicates, repeat pulps, blanks and standards.

12.3  DISCUSSION 
 
In general, WGM did not observe any reason to suspect that the 2006 or 2007 drill core 
samples were not representative or biased during core handling and processing.  In zones of 
relatively low recovery, however, not only is there the possibility that some molybdenite was 
lost, but also that this problem may have been compounded by the taking of perhaps 
unrepresentative halves of badly broken core. 
 
Overall recovery in individual 2006 drillholes varied from 84.2% to 98.2%, including 
relatively poor recovery intervals in the first drill run below casing, presumably in surface-
weathered rock.  Recovery was best in the initial six drillholes (94.9% to 98.2%) but fell to a 
maximum of 92.4% thereafter.  This was due to either a change in ground conditions or 
drilling technique(s); however, the drill crews changed on or about the seventh hole, and the 
fall-off in recovery could therefore have been due to more aggressive drilling.  As noted 
above, recovery in the 1979 Shell Canada NQ drilling program was estimated at 95%. 
 
For the 2006 drillholes, WGM examined the descriptive, geotechnical and analytical logs for 
a number of holes in which recovery may be a factor.  There are zones of low recovery 
wherein the molybdenum contents are lower than in the intervals immediately above and 
below, suggestive of possible drilling-related molybdenite loss.  Equally, in some drillholes 
there are well mineralized intervals which have low core recoveries.  Most of the low-
recovery intervals are described as having broken or crushed core or slickensided, sheared or 
gouged rock.  In the 2007 report, WGM was unable to comment with any confidence how 
recovery may have affected the overall grades of mineralized intervals. 
 
Overall, recovery significantly improved during the 2007 program due to modified drilling 
techniques.  Of the 76 drillholes, 68 had >96% recovery, and 70 had >95% (up to 99.8%) 
recovery.  Of these, 43 had >98% recovery.  In several holes, including two with 91.2% and 
93.4% recovery, poor recovery in the probably surface-weathered material at the beginning of 
holes often accounted for much of the core loss.  Other low-recovery holes often have 
intermittent zones of crushed and/or lost (washed out) core.  In particular, there are five holes 
(ST07-71 to -74, and -87) all located on the same drill section, in which recovery varied from 
90.5 to 94.4%.  Because the holes were completed by two different rigs (and crews), and 
because they are flanked by holes with excellent recovery, Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008) 



    

- 44 - 

concluded that poor ground conditions were probably the cause of low recovery.  Still, the 
worst 2007 holes were much improved over the worst of the 2006 holes. 
 
Columbia Yukon has not compiled the 2006 and 2007 geotechnical data as described in 
Section 12.1.  WGM examined a portion of the geotechnical logs.  Even taking the surface-
weathered zone into consideration, RQDs (0 to 99%), breakage factors (1-15) and 
compressibility (R0 to R5) are highly variable, even within the same hole.  It should be noted 
that, for holes ST06-01 to -20 and ST07-21 to -31, only categories 1 to 6 were used for the 
breakage factors, instead of the full range of 1 to 15; these erroneous data should be removed 
from the geotechnical database. 
 
12.4  TWINNED DRILLHOLES 
 
Table 2 presents the results of two 2007 NQ drillholes which were twinned with 2006 NQ 
drillholes.  The objective of the twinning was to determine molybdenum loss, if any, during 
the sawing and sampling processes.  The entire core of the 2007 drillholes was sampled and 
analyzed in 1.5 m intervals.  The 2006 drillholes had been sampled in 3 m intervals with half-
core.  WGM calculated the average Mo grade across similar twinned intervals. 
 

TABLE 2. 
TWINNED DRILLHOLES: RESULTS OF 2007 WHOLE CORE & 2006 HALVED CORE  

Drillhole From To Interval %Mo  From To Interval %Mo 
 (m) (m) (m)   (m) (m) (m)  
ST06-20 27.0 114.0 87.0 0.058 including 42.0 114.0 72.0 0.065 
ST07-41 23.0 111.5 88.5 0.082 including 23.0 101.0 78.0 0.084 
          
ST06-05 27.0 309.0 282.0 0.075 including 108.0 309.0 201.0 0.091 
ST07-87 29.5 311.5 282.0 0.071 including 110.5 311.5 201.0 0.089 

 
ST07-41 and ST06-20 are located 1.4 m apart.  In the selected intervals, molybdenum 
contents are significantly (29-41%) higher in the 2007 drillhole, which could indicate 
molybdenum loss in the 2006 drillhole samples.  It is significant, however, that the two 
drillholes are not parallel: ST06-20 had deflected almost 15° to the right (azimuth 184.8°) at a 
depth of 24 m, and maintained that azimuth to 207 m; ST07-41 had deflected only 8° to the 
right (azimuth 178.2°) at a depth of 308 m.  At the bottom of the intervals of interest 
(111-114 m), the holes were probably about 15 m apart. 
 



    

- 45 - 

ST07-87 and ST06-05 are located 5.0 m apart.  Because rods were lost in hole ST07-87, no 
survey measurements were taken, and it cannot be determined if the two holes were truly 
twinned.  Nevertheless, the results from the selected intervals are comparable, with the grade 
from the 2007 hole slightly less than from the 2006 hole. 
 
The whole core from HQ diameter drillhole ST07-91, a twin of hole ST06-10, was sampled 
and analyzed in 1 m intervals.  Ten metres of core in three separate intervals was not sampled, 
but was sent in its entirety to SGS for potential use in metallurgical tests.  Results are 
presented in Table 3. 
 

TABLE 3. 
COMPARISON OF TWINNED HOLES ST07-91 (HQ) AND ST06-10 (NQ) 

Drillhole From To Interval %Mo Drillhole From To Interval %Mo 
 (m) (m) (m)   (m) (m) (m)  
ST07-91 21.0 71.0 50.0 0.063 ST06-10 24.0 72.0 48.0 0.058 
 75.0 144.0 69.0 0.103  75.0 144.0 69.0 0.113 
 147.0 171.0 24.0 0.105  147.0 171.0 24.0 0.040 
 187.0 211.0 24.0 0.031  183.0 207.0 24.0 0.042 

 
The three missing intervals from ST07-91 make comparison of the twinned holes difficult, 
since two of the intervals are in relatively high-grade zones: the missing interval 71-75 m is 
straddled by two samples containing 0.103 and 0.194% Mo; the interval 144-147 m by 
samples containing 0.338 and 0.192% Mo.  The first three intervals reflect these missing data.  
Both holes deviated very little but, because the collars are 10 m apart, the location of 
comparable intervals in ST06-10 is ambiguous.  Two of the intervals are better mineralized in 
ST06-10, including the 69 m well-mineralized interval from 75 to 144 m, whereas the 24 m 
interval (147 to 171 m) is much better-mineralized in ST07-91.  Overall, weighted averages 
of the intervals in Table 3 suggest that ST07-91 is somewhat better mineralized, but the 
missing data make this inconclusive. 
 
In summary, whether or not significant molybdenum is being lost during the sample 
preparation process, based on the data from whole-core-analysis twinned NQ and HQ holes, 
is presently inconclusive.  Because core from the HQ drillhole was not halved for analysis, 
and because some of it is missing, it cannot be evaluated if the use of larger diameter core 
would result in more representative analyses.

12.5  DRILL AND SAW SLUDGE SAMPLING 
 
12.5.1  DRILL SLUDGE SAMPLING 
 
In Section 9, the suggestion by Smitheringale (1980) that that the most important mode of 
molybdenite is in fractures was presented; if this is in fact the case, some molybdenite loss 
can be expected during drilling. 
 
In 2007, Columbia Yukon collected drill cuttings (sludges) from parts, or all of, nine 
drillholes to test for molybdenite loss during the coring process.  These results were tabulated 
by Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008) on a sample-by-sample basis.  Results are very erratic, as 
might be expected from varying densities of fracture-related mineralization, the presence of 
faults or otherwise broken and ground core, as well as the variations of drill and water 
pressure.  From Columbia Yukon's tabulated data, WGM calculated averages across higher- 
and lower-grade intervals of each hole, and found no correlation between molybdenum loss, 
or gain, and core grade.  Although the averages of sludges from seven of the nine holes 
contained 11 to 97% more Mo than the core, the sludges from two of the holes contained, on 
average 15% and 32% less Mo than the core. 
 
Overall, the sludges contained 26% more Mo than the core.  An estimation of the approximate 
percentage of molybdenum in the core that was lost would require factoring in the weights of 
the sludge and core samples from each hole; this has not been done. 
 
12.5.2  SAW SLUDGE SAMPLING 
 
Core will preferentially break at fractures and quartz veinlets, some of which will be 
mineralized.  Mineralization could be plucked by the saw from the exposed core faces, which 
would be reflected by higher Mo in the saw sludges than in the core results.  In 2007, 
Columbia Yukon initiated a trial test of possible molybdenum loss through the core sawing 
procedure.  The process involved draining the saw tray of water, and scraping out the sludge 
after cutting each 3 m core sample interval. 
 



    

- 47 - 

Sample-by-sample molybdenum results were tabulated, along with the corresponding core 
analyses, by Wesa and Kowalchuk (2008).  WGM calculated that the average molybdenum 
contents of the sludges for the initial four drillholes were 4%, 44%, 58% and 61% higher than 
of the core, whereas in the final three holes, the sludges from individual holes contained <1%, 
6% and 13% more Mo than the core.  The decline over time was due to Columbia Yukon's 
ability to minimize molybdenum loss from the core by using only sufficient water flow to 
keep the saw blades from overheating.

13.  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
 
13.1  1979-1980 DRILLING PROGRAMS 
 
The 1979 drill core was analyzed at Chemex Labs Ltd. in Vancouver for total molybdenum 
using a hot perchloric acid digestion; some samples were analyzed for silver, gold, tungsten 
and oxide molybdenum.  Chemex, a prominent Canadian laboratory at the time, is now ALS 
Chemex, part of the international ALS Laboratories Group.  Analysis for molybdenum oxide 
was discontinued after the initial five drillholes (see Section 9).  The analytical certificates for 
those holes list the content of total molybdenum (Mo%) and the content of MoS2, which was 
calculated by subtracting the amount of molybdenum oxide from total Mo, and multiplying 
the remainder by 1.668 (Smitheringale, 1980).  Contents of silver, tungsten and gold were 
minor, and analyses were discontinued. 
 
As a check of the splitting and sampling techniques, sixty-one samples of remaining core 
from drillhole 79-2 were submitted to Chemex; as reported by Smitheringale (1980), results 
were comparable: the mean of the original samples was 0.086% MoS2 compared with a mean 
of 0.087% MoS2 in the second core halves.  Shell Canada also checked the analytical 
accuracy by submitting all of the pulps from one drillhole (79-3) to a second lab, Min-En 
Laboratories Ltd. (now part of the Assayers Group) in North Vancouver for re-analysis.  The 
Min-En results were on average 16% higher than the Chemex results; both labs used the same 
pulps and a similar digestion, but Smitheringale concluded that the difference was the result 
of sample preparation. 
 
The 1980 drill core samples were analyzed by Chemex Labs Ltd., in Calgary.  Molybdenum 
contents were reported as %MoS2, but the methodology is unknown. 
 
Laboratory certificates are available for most of the 1979 and 1980 sampling; a complete set 
of the 1979 drill logs was compiled by Pearson and Muja (2005).

13.2  2006 DRILLING PROGRAM 
 
Samples were not prepared for analysis in any way on site; as far as WGM is aware, no 
sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director or associate of Columbia 
Yukon. 
 
Eco Tech, established in 1976, is an ISO 9001-registered laboratory located in Kamloops, 
British Columbia (registration CDN 57172-02). 
 
At Eco Tech, samples were catalogued and dried.  Rock samples are two-stage crushed and riffle-
split to 80% passing 10 mesh.  A 250 g sub-sample was pulverized to 90% passing 150 mesh, 
rolled and homogenized, and placed in a pre-numbered bag. 
 
A 0.5 g sample was digested with 3 mL of a 3:1:2 (HCl:HN03:H20) which contains beryllium 
(which acts as an internal standard) for 90 minutes in a water bath at 95°C.  The sample was then 
diluted to 10 mL with water, and analyzed for 27 elements on a Jarrell Ash ICP unit.  The lower 
and upper detection limits for molybdenum are 1 ppm and 10,000 ppm, respectively. 
 
For molybdenum "assay" (values reported as percent molybdenum, or % Mo), a suitable sample 
weight was digested with nitric, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and perchloric acids in Teflon 
beakers.  After cooling, the digested sample was bulked up to 200 mL volume with water and 
analyzed by an ICP instrument.  The lower detection limit is 0.001% Mo. 
 
One repeat sample pulp was run for each batch of 20 samples, or less.  Certified reference 
material standards are run with each batch.  Results are compared and must fall within control 
limits (± two standard deviations) to be accepted. 
 
Results are collated by computer and are printed along with accompanying quality control data 
(repeat samples and standards).  Results are printed and faxed and/or mailed to the client. 
 
13.3  2007 DRILLING PROGRAM 
 
Samples were not prepared for analysis in any way on site; as far as WGM is aware, no 
sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director or associate of Columbia 
Yukon. 



    

- 50 - 

 
Since 1996, Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. ("Acme") has been an accredited laboratory, 
conforming to the requirements of international quality standards through the International 
Standards Organization, for ISO 9001:9002.  Analytical services include classical wet 
assaying, fire assaying, and instrumental analysis for major and trace elements.  The last 
includes multi-element analysis by induced coupled plasma–emission spectrometry 
("ICP-ES") and induced coupled plasma–mass spectrometry ("ICP-MS") for whole rock trace 
elements. 
 
At Acme, samples were dried at 60°C, jaw crushed to 70% passing 10 mesh (2 mm), then 
riffle split to produce 250 g samples.  Each 250 g sample was then pulverized to 95% passing 
150 mesh (100 microns) in a mild-steel ring and puck mill.  Pulp sub-samples of 0.5 g were 
weighed into test tubes, and 15 to 30 g sub-samples weighed into beakers. 
 
For routine analysis, a modified Aqua Regia solution of concentrated HCl and HNO3, and 
demineralised H2O, in a 1:1:1 ratio, was added to each sample to leach for one hour in a hot 
water bath at >95°C.  After cooling, the solutions were made up to final volume with 5% HCl.  
Sample weight to solution volume was 1 g to 20 mL.  Solutions were then aspirated into a 
Jarrel Ash AtomComp 800 or 975 ICP or Spectro Ciros Vision emission spectrometer and 
analyzed for 30 elements.  The lower and upper detection limits for molybdenum are 
1 ppm and 2,000 ppm, respectively.  WGM refers to these results in this report as "ICP" 
results. 
 
Samples containing >300 ppm Mo were re-analyzed using a larger (1 g) sample and a greater 
dilution.  A volume of 30 mL of Aqua Regia (as above) was added to each sample.  Samples 
were digested for one hour in a hot water bath (>95°C), cooled for three hours, and made up 
to volume (100 mL) with dilute (5%) HCl.  Very high-grade samples require a 1 g to 250 mL 
or 0.25 g to 250 mL sample/solution ratio for accurate determination.  Acme's QA/QC 
protocol requires simultaneous digestion of a reagent blank inserted into each batch.  Sample 
solutions were aspirated into a Spectra Ciros Vision ICP emission spectrograph.  The values 
are reported as percent molybdenum (% Mo) and are referred to in this report as "assay" 
results.  The lower detection limit is 0.001% Mo. 
 
As part of Acme's QA/QC protocol, an analytical batch, consisting of 36 samples, 
incorporates: a sample-preparation blank carried through all stages of preparation and 



    

- 51 - 

analysis as the first sample; a pulp duplicate to monitor analytical precision; a -10 mesh reject 
duplicate to monitor sub-sample variation; a reagent blank to measure background; and an 
aliquot of in-house standard reference materials to monitor accuracy. 
 
A number of samples submitted to Acme were later randomly selected by Acme to send to Eco 
Tech for re-analysis.  Drill and saw sludges, as well as blanks and standards, made up a 
significant proportion of these samples.  For the comparison, all samples not derived from drill 
core were filtered out of the database.  Eco Tech's sample preparation procedures are outlined 
above; analytical procedures in Section 14.3.2. 
 
13.4  RESULTS OF 2006 QA/QC PROGRAM 
 
13.4.1  BLANKS 
 
In the field, standards and blanks were routinely inserted by Columbia Yukon into the sample 
stream every 16th or 20th sample (not counting duplicated and standards), on an alternating 
basis.  As reviewed in the 2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007), two 
different blanks were used;  neither showed any evidence of laboratory contamination, 
although one result of 382 ppm Mo could have been from an incorrectly labelled sample of 
drill core, which cannot be verified by WGM. 
 
13.4.2  STANDARDS 
 
In the field, one of three different standards was inserted on a revolving basis about every 20th 
sample, so that each standard was used about every 60th sample in the sequence. Each was 
analyzed 30 to 33 times and, two of the standards were also routinely assayed. 
 
As discussed in the 2007 WGM report, the results demonstrated a very good level of 
laboratory accuracy, as the average for molybdenum of each of the three standards was 
essentially identical to its accepted value.  There was no appreciable variation of geochemical 
or assay results with time, and it is noteworthy that the variation within a single day could 
reflect a significant portion of, or even completely reflect any long-term variations. 
 



    

- 52 - 

13.4.3  ASSAYING 
 
All samples which returned a first analysis of >500 ppm Mo were assayed using the 
procedure outlined above.  In the 2007 WGM report, a very good correlation between the two 
results was demonstrated. 
 
13.4.4  PULP RE-ANALYSIS 
 
The laboratory routinely re-analyzed pulps by taking a second aliquot (301 samples).  If the 
sample contained >500 ppm Mo, a second assay was also done (48 samples).  The 2007 
WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007) demonstrated a nearly a 1:1 correspondence 
between the replicate pairs of analyses (ppm Mo).  For samples containing less than 
1,000 ppm Mo, the maximum differences between pairs are less than 10% from the mean of 
each pair.  Similarly, there is very good replication with assay pairs.  Variation is likely due to 
a combination of analytical variation and non-homogeneous pulps. 
 
13.4.5  LABORATORY RE-SPLIT PAIRS 
 
About every 35th sample, the laboratory prepared a second sample from the coarse reject by 
riffle-splitting to approximately 250 g, followed by pulverizing, and analyzing in the regular 
sample batches in the same way as for the original sample (described above).  An analysis of 
the pairs was not provided, and WGM did not extract the data from the analytical certificates 
because the preparation and analytical methodologies are the same as for the Columbia 
Yukon re-split pairs discussed below. 
 
13.4.6  COLUMBIA YUKON RE-SPLIT PAIRS 
 
Every 15th to 20th sample, Columbia Yukon placed a second tag (the next sample number in 
the sample sequence) into the bag of an already-tagged sample, which designated to the lab 
that a second split of the already-tagged core sample was to be taken following crushing in 
the same manner as the internal laboratory re-split pairs.  The pulp of the second re-split was 
kept separate from the original sample.  Because any samples containing >500 ppm Mo were 
resubmitted for assay, there is also a subset of assay pairs shown in the last diagram. 
 



    

- 53 - 

As stated in the 2007 WGM report, the scatter of analysis and assay pairs is noticeably greater 
than for pulp duplicates.  This was attributed to a nugget effect for molybdenite because of its 
locally coarse grain or aggregate size and irregular distribution on a sample scale throughout. 
 
13.4.7  SUMMARY 
 
Kuehnbaum and Lindinger (2007) concluded that sample preparation and analytical 
procedures for samples from the 2006 diamond drilling program were adequate.  Blank 
sample results indicate that lab contamination, if any, was insignificant.  The results of the 
external standards were precise and reasonably accurate; the pulp repeats (including assay 
repeats) also showed a high degree of repeatability.  Re-split sample pairs do not demonstrate 
the same degree of repeatability, but this is not unexpected considering the nature of the 
mineralization. 
 
The core logging and sampling facility used by Columbia Yukon was secure and, because it is 
easily accessible by non-employees, was kept locked at all times when not in use. 
 
13.5  RESULTS OF 2007 QA/QC PROGRAM 
 
13.5.1  BLANK 
 
The "granite" blank was obtained from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. ("CDN") in Delta, 
British Columbia.  The pulverized material is available in bulk, but was pre-packaged in 
pouches for Columbia Yukon for easy insertion into the sample stream. 
 
There were 280 blank samples analyzed, approximately every 30th sample.  All but one 
sample contain 3 to 8 ppm Mo.  One sample with 40 ppm can probably be accounted for by a 
numbering error: the sample is listed as a "rock pulp" in the corresponding laboratory 
analytical sheet, but the sample preceding it contains 4 ppm Mo, and has other trace metal 
contents (particularly thorium) which suggest that it is a blank.  There is no suggestion of 
laboratory contamination at the analytical level. 
 
In addition to any prepared blank that will be used in the 2008 program, WGM recommends 
that Columbia Yukon obtain a blank that will require crushing upon arrival at the laboratory.  
Occasionally inserting the coarse blank immediately after a sample which is visibly highly 



    

- 54 - 

mineralized will help to monitor proper cleaning of the crusher and pulverizing equipment 
between samples. 
 
13.5.2  STANDARD 
 
A single reference standard was used in the 2007 program: CDN-MoS-1, also obtained from 
CDN.  The source material is mill feed from the Endako (molybdenum) Mine in central 
British Columbia.  The sample was subjected to a 12-lab round robin test, and the mean and 
standard deviation ("SD") calculated for all data.  Outliers beyond the mean ±2 SD were 
removed and a new mean ± 2 SD calculated: 0.065% ± 0.008% Mo.  There is no certified 
geochemical value (in ppm) for the standard. 
 
The standard was introduced after approximately every 30th sample.  The mean and SD for 
285 ICP analyses of the 2007 program standard are 632 ±31 ppm Mo, equivalent to 
0.063% ±0.003% Mo; the maximum and minimum contents are 741 and 547 ppm, 
respectively. 
 
Because the standard exceeds 300 ppm Mo, inserts were usually, but not always, assayed.  
The range of values in 238 assays is 0.044% to 0.071% Mo, with a mean and standard 
deviation of 0.064% ± 0.003% Mo.  Ignoring the assay of 0.044% makes very little 
difference, resulting in a mean and standard deviation of 0.064% ± 0.002% Mo.  The results 
demonstrate a very good level of laboratory accuracy. 
 
Although the standard is close to the grade of the Storie Deposit of 0.064-0.069% Mo, as 
determined by Mintec in this report using a 0.035% Mo cutoff, there are many higher-grade 
spikes (>0.2% Mo) encountered in drillholes, and a number of composite intervals in historic 
holes in the higher grade zone that contain in excess of 0.09% Mo.  Accordingly, for the 2008 
program, Columbia Yukon is returning to the use of three standards with a broader range of 
accepted molybdenum contents. 
 
With information provided by Acme for the dates of laboratory reports, WGM reviewed the 
trend of the standard results over time, for both ICP geochemical and assay results.  The ICP 
data show no distinguishable trend over time, although there is often a considerable range of 
values for the standard within a given certificate.  There are five results (547 to 569 ppm Mo) 
that fall below the accepted mean minus 2 SDs of the standard, expressed as ppm (570 ppm), 



    

- 55 - 

and one that lies above the mean plus 2 SDs (equivalent to 730 ppm).  These stray values are 
from certificates in which the standard sample returned other values which are acceptable, so 
the values beyond the 2SD limits may be accounted for by the small sub-sample size. 
 
The standard assay data also display no discernable trend over time (Figure 5), although the 
variation from a single report can cover a significant range.  Only one value (0.044% Mo) lies 
beyond the range of the mean ±2 standard deviations (0.057% to 0.073% Mo).  Significantly, 
the ICP result for the sample, 563 ppm Mo, is close to the grade of the standard, so the stray 
assay value cannot be explained.

13.5.3  ASSAYING 
 
In the laboratory, all samples which returned a first ICP analysis of 300 ppm Mo or greater 
were assayed using the procedure outlined above.  Results are shown in Figure 6.  The small 
population below 300 ppm/0.30% Mo reflects the fact that sequential core samples from parts 
of drillhole ST07-51 and -52, and all of hole ST07-53 were assayed regardless of the initial 
ICP geochemical results.  Because the upper detection limit of the initial ICP analysis is 
2,000 ppm Mo, there may be a slight bias in the regression fit above an ideal 1:1 ratio. In 
addition, there is some scatter in a relatively small number of samples that could simply 
reflect sample inhomogeneity due to the "nuggety" distribution typical of molybdenite 
mineralization.  (This is further discussed below.)  Overall, however, the correlation between 



    

- 56 - 

the two sets of data is acceptable.  The slight positive shift from the ideal 1:1 (actually 
1:10,000) correlation is likely influenced by the lack of original geochemical values 
>2,000 ppm, the upper detection limit of the Acme method.

13.5.4  PULP RE-ANALYSIS 
 
The laboratory routinely re-analyzed pulps by taking a second aliquot.  If the sample 
contained >300 ppm Mo, a second assay was also done for many samples – but not always. 
There is nearly a 1:1 correspondence between the replicate pairs of ICP analyses (ppm Mo), 
as demonstrated on Figure 7.  Of 248 repeat pairs, 22 show differences of >10% between 
individual analyses and the mean of each pair; 185 have differences of >5%.  There is a 
distinct trend of higher percent differences in lower-grade samples: the highest difference, 
80%, is in a pair of samples that averages only 20 ppm Mo. 
 
Similarly, there is excellent replication with assay pairs, as shown on Figure 8.  For only 10 of 
106 pairs do samples vary more than 5% of the mean of the samples pairs; the maximum 
difference is 21%.  As with the ICP results, discussed above, WGM notes a distinct 
correlation between higher percent differences in sample pairs with lower molybdenum grade: 
all 10 of the pairs average <0.05% Mo.  Variation is likely due to a combination of analytical 
variation and non-homogeneous pulps.

13.5.5  LABORATORY RE-SPLIT PAIRS 
 
About every 30th to 40th sample, the laboratory prepared a re-split and analyzed it using the 
routine methods.  A review of the pairs was not provided, and WGM did not extract the data 
from the analytical certificates and database because the preparation and analytical 
methodologies are the same as for the Columbia Yukon re-split pairs discussed below. 



    

- 58 - 

13.5.6  COLUMBIA YUKON RE-SPLIT (DUPLICATE) PAIRS 
 
Approximately every 30th sample (total of 283 samples), Columbia Yukon placed a second 
tag (the next sample number in the sequence) into the bag of an already-tagged sample, which 
instructed the laboratory to prepare a re-split of the already-sampled core.  The second sample 
was prepared from the coarse reject by riffle-splitting to approximately 250 g, followed by 
pulverizing, and analyzing in the regular sample batches in the same way as for the original 
sample (described above).  Most, but not all, of the re-splits containing >300 ppm Mo were 
also assayed – a total of 84 samples. 
 
As was found for the much smaller number of re-splits from the 2006 core samples, the 
scatter of 2007 analyses and assay pairs is much greater than for pulp duplicates (Figures 9 
and 10).  This is thought to be attributable to a nugget effect, due to irregular distribution and 
grain size of molybdenite throughout a sample.  The mean molybdenum contents of the first 
and second sets of ICP results are 342 and 337 ppm, respectively, showing any nugget effect 
to be smoothed out over a large sample population.  The assayed sample pairs appear to 
display less correspondence, possibly due to the fact that the samples are higher-grade than 
the norm, and may contain a higher proportion of coarse molybdenite.  The mean 
molybdenum contents of the first and second sets of assays are 0.107% and 0.095%, 
respectively; however, removing the two samples with the poorest correspondence between 
assays (left chart, Figure 10) results in means of 0.091% and 0.090% Mo, respectively.

13.5.7  INTER-LABORATORY ANALYSES 
 
The samples for inter-laboratory check analyses were selected by Acme, and the batch 
included a large number of sludge sample pulps, as well as blanks, standards and duplicates 
from drill core samples.  WGM eliminated all but core samples, but any laboratory and 
Columbia Yukon re-splits (duplicates) were included. 
 
The ICP results of 382 sample re-analyses are shown on Figure 11.  The correlation is slightly 
less than the ideal 1:1 ratio, which WGM believes is the result of the absence of samples with 
>2,000 ppm from Acme samples; these are simply reported as ">2000" ppm, and were left out 
of the chart.  This is supported by the excellent overall correlation between the 144 assay 
pairs shown on Figure 12.  The two very different samples in Figure 11 are unexplained. 
 
The overall scatter of the inter-laboratory pulp re-analysis for ICP is greater than for the 
Acme repeat analyses (Section 13.5.4).  There are a number of sample pairs which differ 
considerably.  It is suspected, but cannot be verified, that some of these are due to manual 
sample number entry.  The scatter of inter-laboratory assay pairs (see Figure 12) is similar to 
the scatter of Acme pulp re-assays (see Figure 8).

13.5.8  SUMMARY 
 
The sample preparation and analytical procedures for the 2007 drilling program appear to 
have been adequate.  As indicated by blanks, lab contamination, if any, was insignificant; the 
blanks, however, were pre-pulverized and did not undergo crushing and pulverizing in the 
laboratory. 
 
The results of the single external standard submitted by Columbia Yukon appear to be 
reasonably precise and accurate.  Pulp repeats, including assay repeats, show an overall high 
degree of repeatability.  Consistent with results from the 2006 drillholes, 2007 re-split sample 
pairs do not show the same degree of repeatability; the scatter is thought be due to the 
nuggety nature and irregular distribution of the molybdenite. 
 
The results of re-analysis of random samples by a second laboratory are overall consistent 
with the results of the primary analyses.

14.  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
 
14.1  DRILLHOLE COLLAR LOCATIONS 
 
Because of heavy snow cover during WGM's April, 2007, site visit, only two historic drill 
collars could be located.  By July, 2007, however, almost all of the snow had melted, and 
WGM measured the locations of three historic holes and a thirteen of Columbia Yukon's 
2006 and 2007 holes.  Multiple-count (minimum 100) readings were taken, using a hand-held 
GPS instrument.  Data are presented in Table 4.  Given the relative inaccuracy of the hand-
held unit, there is very good correspondence between the WGM and Columbia Yukon high-
resolution readings.

14.2  DRILLHOLE AUDITS 
 
14.2.1  HISTORIC AND 2006 DRILLHOLES 
 
Analytical results for two of the twenty 2006 Columbia Yukon drillholes, ST06-07 and -14, 
were compared against the digital laboratory certificates.  No errors were encountered.  In 
drillhole ST06-01, an erroneous manual conversion was made from 402 ppm Mo to 
0.402% Mo, instead of 0.040% Mo (sample not assayed).  In the process of reviewing the 



    

- 63 - 

2006 drillholes for the twinned comparisons (Section 14.2), only one minor meterage error 
was found in another hole. 
 
As discussed in Section 6, drill logs with % Mo assay results for all of the Shell Canada 1979 
drillholes and most of the corresponding analytical certificates are available.  These data were 
entered by Columbia Yukon into drillhole databases.  Only assay certificates (%MoS2) are 
available for the 1980 drilling; the sample numbers were organized by drillhole (e.g. 80-3-1, 
80-3-2 etc. for samples from hole 80-3), and are listed in the certificates largely in order.  It is 
unknown, however, if the lists of 1980 samples contain introduced standards, blanks, or 
duplicates.  Consequently, to compile their database of 1980 and pre-1979 historic drillholes, 
Columbia Yukon measured the intervals and used the %Mo or %MoS2 assay values on paper 
cross-sections.  All of the 1979 and 1980 drillholes (with analytical data from collar to toe) 
and whichever earlier drillholes were on the sections were tabulated in this way.  Columbia 
Yukon assumed that the sampling and analytical interval for all historic drillholes was 10 ft 
(3.05 m), unless otherwise indicated on the cross-sections, drill logs or sample summaries. 
 
WGM audited 11 of the historic holes by comparing the data from the 1979 drill logs or on 
the cross-sections with the analytical database generated by Columbia Yukon.  There were 
several meterage entry errors, but these could be easily spotted and corrected.  Five of the 
holes were verified; one of them may have two minor errors generated when Shell Canada 
transferred data from the certificates to sections, but this cannot be confirmed.  Other errors 
included a few minor rounding off or entry errors in the 3rd decimal place and the repeat of 
one low-grade interval; none of these would significantly affect the average grade of the 
well mineralized intervals in their respective drillholes.  More noteworthy errors include the 
displacement of the decimal and entry of the wrong digit in the second decimal place 
(0.0X% Mo or MoS2):  0.071% instead of 0.021% MoS2; 0.37% instead of the correct 
0.037% MoS2; 0.7% rather than 0.07% MoS2; and 0.5% rather than the correct 0.05% MoS2.  
The isolation of most of the intervals will not result in changes to the higher-grade intervals.  
The last interval, in hole DH-21, falsely increases the grade of a 50.3 m interval from 
0.088% to 0.104% Mo, but this drillhole was not used in the WGM Mineral Resource 
estimate. 
 
WGM also checked the footage and/or meterage entries for all of the drillholes used in the 
Mineral Resource estimate and not previously reviewed, with several adjustments made 



    

- 64 - 

(see Section 17), but did not audit Columbia Yukon's data entry from historic cross-sections 
to the database. 
 
WGM concluded that any errors that may have been remaining in the database should not 
have significantly affected the 2007 Mineral Resource estimate discussed in the previous 
WGM report by Kuehnbaum and Lindinger (2007).  Columbia Yukon has since thoroughly 
reviewed the entire historic and 2006 databases. 
 
14.2.2  2007 DRILLHOLES 
 
WGM reviewed for molybdenum a significant portion of the Columbia Yukon database 
against final Acme analytical certificates.  Blanks, standards, and replicate and duplicate 
samples were not included in the audit, and only those samples potentially a part of the 
Mineral Resource Estimate (original drill core samples) were included.  Of these, WGM 
randomly reviewed approximately 18% of the ICP geochemical values for molybdenum, and 
21.8% of the assay values.  No errors were found in either case.  There were, however, a 
number of problems with mislabelling blanks as standards and vice-versa, but these have been 
corrected by Columbia Yukon. 
 
14.3  COMPARISON OF TWINNED 2006 AND HISTORIC DRILLHOLES 
 
Nineteen of the 20 holes from 2006 were positioned to twin historic holes.  In the previous 
WGM report, Kuehnbaum and Lindinger (2007) compared the results of the 2006 drillholes 
with historic holes in order to validate historic data for inclusion into the 2007 Mineral 
Resource Estimate.  WGM concluded that two of the pairs (ST06-14/DH-2 and ST06-08/DH-
21) showed poor correspondence because the historic hole was vertical, whereas the 2006 
holes were inclined.  Two holes thought to be twinned, ST06-11 and 79-7, are actually 
separated (see Section 11.1). 
 
Table 5 summarizes: 1) the overall results for the entire shorter drillhole of each pair and a 
similar interval for the other of each pair; and 2) higher-grade intervals, if any, within each of 
the holes.  The three sets of holes mentioned above, and included in the 2006 report, have 
been omitted.  A fourth pair, ST06-13/80-20, correlates poorly, which was thought to be due 
to a large collar separation (21.5 m) based on an original erroneous hand-held GPS location 
for hole 80-20; based on accurate 2007 surveying, however, the holes are only 2.6 m apart.

There is very good correlation between the 2006 drillholes with the two 1971 holes and seven 
of the 1980 drillholes: 10% difference or less between the overall drillhole or higher-grade 
intervals.  Other 2006 – 1980 hole correlations are reasonable, except for the pair ST06-
13/80-20, which can at present not be explained.  (The best mineralization in 80-20 is beneath 
the bottom of ST06-13, and ST06-13 drillhole could be deepened.)  Imperfect correlation 



    

- 66 - 

could also be due to the fact that no historic drillholes were surveyed for lateral or vertical 
deviation, so the amount of divergence at depth between the historic and 2006 drillholes is 
unknown, and possibly very significant.  The 2006 drillholes occasionally deviated 
significantly.  Also, in general, correlation lessens between pairs with increasing collar 
separation. 
 
Correlation between 2006 and 1979 drillholes is moderately good to fair, and differences can 
be mostly explained by incompatible hole orientations, since the orientations of the 1979 
holes varied from 156° to 170° azimuth and -68° to -76° inclination (see Table 7 for details). 
Differences in recovery could also be a factor.  WGM believes that, because the 1979 and 
1980 samples were collected by the same company and analyzed by the same laboratory, 
albeit in different locations (Vancouver and Calgary, respectively), the 1979 drillhole data are 
reliable. 
 
Significantly, the weighted averages of the better-mineralized intercepts in drillholes (right 
columns in Table 5) – excluding ST06-13/80-20 – are: 0.084% Mo (1,635 m) for the 2006 
drillholes; and 0.086% Mo (1,604 m) for the historic drillholes. 
 
Kuehnbaum and Lindinger (2007) concluded that the 1971, 1979 and 1980 analytical data 
could be reliably used, where needed, for the preliminary resource estimate outlined in the 
2007 WGM report.  The 1979 and 1980 holes were used in the Mineral Resource Estimate in 
this report. 
 
Also, Kuehnbaum and Lindinger noted that weaker correlation between "twinned" holes 
which have differing nominally steeply inclined orientations, or significantly differing collar 
locations, suggests that there may be a steep component to the molybdenum mineralization, 
possibly reflecting the influence of structural channelways, or clusters of steeply dipping 
veinlets or molybdenite-coated fractures. 
 
14.4  WGM SURFACE AND DRILL CORE SAMPLE ANALYSES 
 
14.4.1  APRIL 2007 SAMPLING 
 
During WGM's visit to the Storie Property on April 25, 2007, rubble from historic trenches 
near drillhole 79-07 was sampled.  Two large composite grab samples (31170 and 31171) of 



    

- 67 - 

selected, visibly mineralized quartz-feldspar porphyry from the rubble contained 864 and 
496 ppm Mo.  A third composite grab sample (31172) was collected from outcrop of 
unmineralized quartz monzonite; it contained 12 ppm Mo.  Samples locations are shown on 
Figure 4; descriptions and an analytical certificate were presented in the 2007 WGM report 
(Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007). 
 
Twelve 3 m intervals of core from 12 different 2006 drillholes were also sampled.  Results, 
along with original Columbia Yukon analytical data, are given in Table 6.

All surface and drill core samples were put into bags with sequential, uniquely-numbered tags 
and closed with wire.  They remained in the locked core logging facility overnight, with 
Mr. Kuehnbaum retaining the only key.  The samples were taken by Mr. Kuehnbaum by 
vehicle to Whitehorse where he personally arranged for air shipment to Acme Analytical 
Laboratories Ltd. ("Acme") in Vancouver the following day.  Samples were analyzed for a 
40-element package, including molybdenum. 
 
At Acme, each sample was dried at 60°C, jaw crushed to 70% to passing 10 mesh, then riffle 
split to produce a 250 g sample.  The 250 g sample was then pulverized to 95% passing 
150 mesh (100 μm.  A 1 g sample of the pulverized material was weighed into a Teflon test 
tube, with duplicates and reference material added to the sample sequence.  To each sample 
was added 20 mL of a mixture of H2O-HF-HNO3-HClO4, and the solution was heated until 
dry.  A 16 mL aliquot of 50% HCl is added to the residue and heated in a hot water bath 
(about 95°C) for 30 minutes.  After cooling, the resulting solutions were transferred to 
100 mL flasks and made to volume with 5% HCl.  Calibration standards and reagent blanks 



    

- 68 - 

were inserted at this point.  Solutions were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma 
atomic-emission spectrometry ("ICP-ES") followed by ICP mass spectrometry ("ICP MS") 
for a 40-element package.  If a standard result falls outside the range of two standard 
deviations from the mean, the batch is re-run. 
 
An analytical batch comprised 33 samples.  QA/QC protocol incorporated a sample-prep 
blank, a pulp duplicate to monitor analytical precision, a -10 mesh reject duplicate to monitor 
sub-sampling variation (for drill core), two reagent blanks to monitor background, and 
aliquots of in-house standards.  The twelve WGM drill core samples and three surface rock 
samples were run as part of a larger batch of samples. 
 
14.4.2  JULY 2007 SAMPLING 
 
During WGM's visit to the Property on July 10 and 11, 2007, only a minor amount of surface 
sampling was done including: outcrop from an old trench, thought to have been excavated by 
Casmo Mining Ltd. in the mid-1960s, in the area of drillhole DH-1; and rubble from the drill 
station of hole ST06-11.  Samples locations are shown on Figure 4, and descriptions of the 
two samples are presented in Table 7.  The only metal of significance is molybdenum.  The 
analytical certificate is included in Appendix I.

All surface and drill core samples were put into bags with sequential, uniquely-numbered tags 
and closed with wire.  They remained in the locked core logging facility overnight.  The 
samples were taken by Mr. Kuehnbaum by vehicle to Dease Lake where he personally 
arranged for truck freight shipment to Eco Tech in Kamloops, British Columbia.  Samples 
were analyzed for a 28-element package, including molybdenum. 
 
At Eco Tech, the samples were prepared as outlined in Section 13.2.  A 0.5 g sample was 
digested with 3 mL of a 3:1:2 (HCl:HNO3:H2O) containing beryllium (which acts as an internal 
standard) for 90 minutes in a water bath at 95°C.  The sample was then diluted to 10 mL with 
water, and analyzed on a Jarrell Ash ICP unit.  The lower and upper detection limits for 
molybdenum are 1 ppm and 10,000 ppm, respectively.  Results were collated by computer and 
are printed along with accompanying quality control data (repeats and standards).   
 
For over-limit molybdenum assays, 2.0 g of sample were digested in aqua regia in 200 mL 
phosphoric acid flasks. Appropriate standards and repeat/re-split samples accompany the 
samples.  The digested solutions are made to volume with water and allowed to settle.  An 
aliquot of sample is analyzed on a Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP ICP unit.  The lower detection 
limit is 0.001% Mo.  Instrument calibration is done by verified synthetic standards, which 
have the same matrix as the samples, and is verified by the analysis of the certified reference 
material.  Results are collated and are printed along with accompanying quality control data 
(repeats, re-splits, and standards).

14.4.3  DISCUSSION 
 
Sampling done during either of WGM's site visits could clearly not repeat the many 
thousands of rock and drill core samples taken and analyzed over the years, but simply 
independently confirm that economically significant grades of molybdenum, in particular, are 
present.  Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the two halves many of the drill core 
samples, as evidenced in Tables 7 and 8, is puzzling. 
 
Overall, the mean of the WGM samples is about 87% of the mean of the samples from the 
original core halves; however, 14 of the 19 WGM samples returned lower molybdenum than 
the first (Columbia Yukon) core halves, and some of the results differ dramatically.  The 
scatter between pairs is greater than the scatter between sample re-split pairs from the original 
core halves (Section 13.5.5).  For the 2006 core samples, the results of reject re-analyses 
(re-splits, right column, Table 6) of four samples which showed the worst correspondence 
with the Columbia Yukon analyses are much closer to the initial WGM results than to the 
Columbia Yukon results.  Assays of pulps from the WGM 2007 core samples returned results 
closer to the ICP geochemical results. 
 
There is no reason to suspect sampling bias during the 2006 or 2007 programs, and Columbia 
Yukon geologists suggested that occasional mineralized veins approximately parallel to the 
drill core axis could explain the discrepancies between core halves; a vein would fall entirely 
or mostly into one side of the sawn core.  Another explanation could be from molybdenite 
falling into the core tray during breakage, but this should result in higher Mo contents in the 
re-sampling analyses; this was certainly not the case for the sample 31167, but could be for 
sample 3401 (see Tables 7 and 8, respectively). 
 
Although variation between the results of individual 3 m core halves may be smoothed out 
over a broad mineralized interval, this could only be tested by consuming the remaining core 
from a drillhole. A useful procedure might be to analyze the two halves of a drillhole as 
separate entities, which would then provide not only a direct comparison between adjacent 
samples, but also composite grades from each of the two halves of the core, and an average 
grade of the combined (whole) core.  Molybdenite loss during sawing would have to be 
minimized.

15.  ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
 
WGM is unaware of any current activity on adjacent properties.  Claims occupying the 
northern and eastern boundaries of the Property are held by Eveready Resource Corporation 
("Eveready").  Because Eveready is a private corporation, any work in progress or planned is 
not available in the public record.  Historic work on the Magno silver-lead-zinc vein on 
Eveready's claim 221627, northeast of the Storie Deposit, was discussed in the 2007 WGM 
report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007). 
 
Velocity Minerals Ltd. ("Velocity", formerly Velocity Resources, Inc.) recently 
commissioned a NI 43-101 technical report on the Cassiar Moly Deposit and Mt. Haskin 
properties in the Cassiar area.  The tenures on which the Cassiar Moly Deposit is located 
adjoin the southern boundary of the Columbia Yukon property.  A minor surface evaluation 
program was recommended by Ostonsoe (2007), but it is uncertain if Velocity is proceeding 
with exploration in 2008.  Historic work and geology of the deposit were previously discussed 
in Section 7.2.

16.  MINERAL PROCESSING METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
 
WGM is unaware of any mineral processing or metallurgical testing done prior to the 
beginning of Columbia Yukon's programs. 
 
In 2007, samples of historic and recent drill core from across the deposit were selected and 
sent by Columbia Yukon to the metallurgy laboratory of SGS in Vancouver, British 
Columbia, for the purpose of providing a representative composite sample for metallurgical 
testing.  In addition, three intervals from the single HQ 2007 drillhole, ST07-91, totalling 
10 m, were submitted to SGS, but these are being held in reserve.  A metallurgical study is in 
progress, but the final report was not ready at the time of preparation of this report.

17.  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
 
17.1  2007 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
In the 2007 WGM report (Kuehnbaum and Lindinger, 2007), WGM prepared a Mineral 
Resource estimate for the Storie Molybdenum Deposit using 38 drillholes, primarily NQ 
(47.6 mm) diameter, from drilling programs completed in 1979, 1980 and 2006.  Where 
previous (historic) drillholes were twinned by 2006 drillholes, the Mo grades from the later 
holes were used.  Where data from 1979-2006 drillholes were lacking, four pre-1979 
drillholes were used; however, these accounted for less than 5% of the overall Mineral 
Resource. 
 
Based on only seven core samples taken by WGM on the April, 2007, site visit, WGM used a 
density of 2.60 g/cm3.  A simple plan polygonal model was used for the 2007 Mineral 
Resource estimate.  Using a cutoff of 0.035% Mo, a maximum open pit mining depth of 
325 m and an assumed 1.5:1 waste to "ore" stripping ratio, the Storie Deposit was estimated 
to contain an Inferred Mineral Resource of 101.6 million tonnes grading 0.067% Mo. 
 
All references to "Mineral Resource Estimate" in the ensuing discussion refer to Mintec's 
2008 Mineral Resource estimate. 
 
17.2  2008 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE, GENERAL 
 
The following Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by Mintec. 
 
The current Storie deposit database contains a total of 125 drillholes.  The total does not 
include the drilling prior to 1979 which was excluded at the client's request.  Figure 13 shows 
a 3-D view of the topography of the deposit and the drillholes.  Elevation on the main area of 
interest on the Property varies from about 1,400 to 1,750 m.  Figure 14 shows a plan view of 
the topography contours of the deposit and the drillhole locations.  Figure 15 shows the 
average drillhole spacing by bench.

17.3  DEFINITIONS  
 
The Mineral Resource estimate was prepared and carried out in accordance with the 
provisions of NI 43-101 guidelines and the CIM standards.  For the purposes of this report, 
the relevant definitions for the CIM Standards are as follows: 
 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid 
inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and 
precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form 
and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge.  

 
An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and 
limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade 
continuity.  The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drillholes.  

 
An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of 
technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced 
closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
 
A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well 
established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production 
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is 
based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological 
and grade continuity.

17.4  GEOLOGIC MODELING  
 
A first pass set of mineralized polygons was interpreted on the 170-degree drillhole matching 
set of 14 sections.  Generally, the polygons were built using the first and last assay interval 
with Mo greater than 0%.  If there was a large inter-burden with no grade assigned near the 
start of a drillhole, then the polygons were pulled down to the next assay interval.  These 
polygons were extended 70 m from the outer drillholes on each section.  Nodes were 
automatically generated every 25 m along the polygons lines, using the densify function, to 
ensure a smooth transition to 3-D wireframe.  The polygons were then linked to generate in 
Mintech's geological software package a mineralized solid.  The two ends of the solid were 
extruded an extra 25 m and closed.  The solid was then sliced on a new set of 30 sections at 
20 m increments and the sliced polygons were updated and readjusted where necessary.  They 
were then densified to 25 m and linked to form a final mineralized solid.  The ends were just 
closed in place.  The solid was assigned a Material Type of MZONE with code of 1. 
 
The drillhole assays were assigned an MZONE code of 1 if they were within the mineralized 
solid.  Drillholes were reviewed on screen to ensure matching with original assay intervals.  
Intervals at the start of some drillholes were edited to ensure all high grades were flagged 
with MZONE code of 1 and low grade intervals flagged with MZONE code of 2.  Figure 16 
shows Section 7 with the Mineralized envelope and drillholes displayed.

A first pass set of geological contact polylines between rock types 2 and 3 were interpreted on 
the 170° set of 14 drillhole sections following the scanned geological sections, supplied by 
Columbia Yukon, as a guide.  The polylines were snapped to the drillhole intervals, nodes 
were automatically generated every 15 m to ensure a smooth 3-D wireframe and linked to 
create a surface.  The surface was extended above topographic limits, following the general 
trend of the geological contact, and closed to create a 3-D wireframe solid.  The portion of the 
solid above the topographic surface was then cut and removed.  This solid was assigned a 
Material Type of LITH with code 1.  
 
The 3-D model blocks and the drillhole assays were assigned an LITH code of 1 if they were 
within the lithology solid and an LITH code of 2 if they were outside the lithology solid.  
Drillholes were reviewed on screen to ensure matching with original rock type intervals.  
Some intervals were edited to ensure all original rock type 1 and 2 were flagged with LITH 
code of 1. 
 
The 3-D model blocks and the drillhole assays were assigned a geologic domain ("DOMN") 
code of 1 if they were within the mineralized solid and within the lithology solid; they were 
assigned a domain code of 2 if they were within the mineralized solid and outside the 
lithology solid.  Figure 17 shows Section 3 with Lithology envelope and drillholes displayed. 
 
Figure 18 shows a 3-D view of the mineralized and the lithology solid with the drillholes and 
the topography. 
 
17.5  GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 
The geostatistical analysis of the Storie Deposit included the statistical analysis of assays and 
composite grade items, spatial continuity analysis of the mineralization using variograms, and 
the determination of interpolation parameters for deposit modeling. 
 
17.5.1  ASSAY STATISTICS 
 
The current Storie Deposit database contains a total of 125 drillholes of various lengths.  The 
average depth of the holes is about 284 m.  There are four holes less than 100 m in length, 
while the longest hole is 487 m.  However, the majority of the holes are from 200 to 400 m in 
length.

The total drilling in the current database is 35,548 m, including the unassayed intervals.  Most 
intervals were assayed for molybdenum (Mo).  The total length of assayed intervals is 
35,581 m with 12,139 assay intervals.  The unassayed or missing Mo intervals are set to zero.  
Mintec was told by Columbia Yukon that only intervals containing greater than 400 ppm Mo 
for 2006, and greater than 300 ppm for 2007 were assayed for % Mo.  Therefore, setting the 
missing assay intervals to zero may result in a little underestimation of grade.  However, the 
majority of these intervals are outside the mineralized domain.  The total number of assays 
with the assigned mineralized domain code is 10,650, with only 44 missing Mo assays set to 
zero.  The majority of the assay intervals are 3 m in length. 
 
Statistical analyses of assay data were performed for Mo within the mineralized domain.  
General statistics—number of samples, total length, mean value, standard deviation, 
maximum value, and coefficient of variation—were calculated for reference.  Table 9 gives 
the summary statistics of assays for each of these items in the database at zero cutoff grade.  
Table 10 gives the summary statistics of assays per rock type for each of these items in the 
database at zero cutoff grade.

The original Mo assays were stored into MO item.  The assay intervals that are assayed in 
some of the 2007 holes were stored in MOICP item.  The final Mo grade was the result of 
merging MO and MOICP items.  When no MO was available, and MOICP>0, then MO was 
replaced by MOCIP.  These resulting Mo values were stored into MOMOD item and were 
used for the subsequent study. 
 
Figure 19 shows a histogram of Mo assays.  Figure 20 shows the log normal histogram of Mo 
assays.  They have a skewed distribution with some outlier high grades.  Figure 21 shows the 
probability plot in logarithmic scale of all Mo assays.  Based on the probability plot and the 
assay statistics, the Mo assays were capped at 0.75% corresponding the top 0.1% of assays.  
These capped assays were stored into MOCUT item in the database.  Table 11 gives a list of 
the capped assays.  There is a total of nine assays in this list.

The drillhole assay intervals were also composited on 10 m downhole intervals honouring 
DOMN boundaries.  These composites were only used for Polygonal (Nearest Neighbour) 
interpolation. 
 
The cumulative probability plots were used to examine the Mo composite grades at the tail of 
the distribution curve that might behave differently than the rest of the grades.  Based on these 
plots and composite statistics, an outlier high-grade cutoff grade of 0.2% Mo was identified.  
This approximately corresponds to Mean +3 x Std. Dev.  Figure 24 shows the cumulative 
probability plots in logarithmic scale for Mo.

17.5.3  VARIOGRAPHY  
 
Variogram analysis for Mo was done using 5 m composites within the mineralized domain.  
The type of variogram used for the analysis was the correlogram.  The sill of the variogram 
from a correlogram is normally equal to one (1.0).  This makes it easier to compare the 
variogram models from different geologic units and for different items. 
 
Directional variograms were calculated from 0o to 315o at 45o increments in horizontal 
directions, and at 0o, 30o, 60o and 90o dip angles.  Since the variogram in any given direction 
is the same as the variogram in the opposite direction, these angles cover all directions needed 
to check the continuity of the mineralization in the deposit. 
  
Vertical variograms at smaller lags were used to determine the nugget effect which was then 
manually entered when calculating a 3-D auto-fit model based on the directional variograms. 
 
The directional variograms essentially exhibit the continuity of the mineralization for 
different directions in a mathematical form.  Using the "auto-fit" option in Mintec's 3-D 
variogram modeller, mathematical models were fit to the directional variograms calculated.  
The selected 3-D model is the "best" fit that minimizes the error between the theoretical 
model and the experimental curves for all directions considered.  The parameters of the 
variogram model are a necessary input in kriging, but they are also helpful for defining the 
search distances used in the interpolation of the block grades. 
 
Figure 25 shows the downhole combined variogram used with 5 m lags for calculating the 
nugget.  Figure 26 shows the final exponential model fit to the directional variograms for Mo 
calculated within the mineralized domain.  Figure 27 shows the variogram contours generated 
based on these directional variograms on the horizontal plane.  Figure 28 shows the 3-D 
variogram ellipsoids sliced at principal orthogonal planes—horizontal, W-E vertical and N-S 
vertical. 
 
Besides the grade variograms, a global median indicator variogram for Mo was computed to 
help determine the distance ranges used in the resource estimation and classification.  Using a 
0.035% Mo grade, the 5 m composites were tagged 0 if they were below the cutoff, and 1 if 
above.  Figure 29 shows the global variogram of these indicators at 0.035% Mo cutoff and the 
theoretical exponential model fit.  Table 13 summarizes the variogram model parameters

17.6  3-D BLOCK MODEL  
 
A 3-D block model of the deposit was built with 10x10x10 m-size blocks for Mineral 
Resource estimation.  The block model covered an area of 1.6 km by 1.7 km on plan, and 
0.64 km vertically.  Table 14 gives the model coordinate limits and dimensions.

17.7  GRADE INTERPOLATION  
 
The interpolation plan and the search parameters for Inverse Distance Cubed weighting 
("ID3") and Ordinary Kriging ("OK") methods were based on the geostatistical analysis and 
variogram model ranges.  According to this plan, Mo was interpolated within the domains in 
the model with the inverse distance weighting method and kriging, using 5 m fixed length 



    

- 91 - 

composites honouring geological domains.  The composites whose lengths are less than 2.5 m 
were not included in the interpolation.  Composite to block geologic domain code matching 
was applied so that the blocks were interpolated using the composites that have the same 
domain code. 
 
Besides the inverse distance weighting and the ordinary kriging methods, the Mo grades were 
also interpolated using the Polygonal (or Nearest Neighbour) method for comparison and 
checking of the global bias.  For polygonal interpolation, 10 m composites were used to 
match to the bench height.  Inverse Distance results were stored into MOIDW item in the 
model. Kriging and Polygonal method results were stored into MOKRG and MOPLY items, 
respectively. 
 
ID3 and kriging interpolations were done in two passes.  The first pass consisted of a 
maximum 3-D search distance of 100 m applied along the major axis ellipsoid. The second 
pass was more restrictive with the search distances along major, minor and vertical axes of 
ellipsoid were reduced by a third.  Thus, a 67 m search was used along the major axis 
ellipsoid.  The results of the second pass overwrote the first pass using an ellipsoid search 
based on the variogram ranges determined for the mineralized domain.  A minimum of 2 and 
a maximum of 10 composites, with 2 composites from the same hole, were used for the 
interpolation in both passes.  Table 16 gives a summary of the interpolation parameters used 
for Mo.

An outlier high-grade cutoff was applied for Mo during the interpolation of block grades 
based on the cumulative probability plot results and statistical analysis.  The cutoff used was 
0.2% Mo grade.  The influence of the composites higher than these cutoffs was limited to 
15 m to avoid smearing.  From 15 m to the full search distance, these composites were capped 
to 0.2% Mo. 
 
17.8  SPECIFIC GRAVITY  
 
Mintec received 121 specific gravity ("SG") analyses from Columbia Yukon.  After statistical 
analysis, the specific gravity results showed no correlation with molybdenum assays. Mintec 
interpolated density values into the blocks using the available drillhole density data.  The 
density values received were composited using 10 m benches and interpolated with an Inverse 
Distance Squared weighting method using the grade interpolation search parameters.  A 
weighted average of 121 density measurements was calculated to be approximately 2.6 g/cm3.  
This value was used as a background value for the 3-D model blocks that had no density 
information. 
 
17.9  MODEL VALIDATION  
 
The Mo grade item was also interpolated using OK and the polygonal method for comparison 
with ID3 results.  In the case of the polygonal method, the nearest 10 m composite intercept 
was used to assign the block grade within mineralized domain. 
 
The grade-tonnage curves from the three methods are compared. As expected, the polygonal 
method resulted in fairly higher grade distribution with less tonnage than those of ID3 and 
kriging methods.  Because of using a power of 3 in the inverse distance weighting, the ID3 
results are between kriging and polygonal methods.  Table 17 gives the Mineral Resources 
(Indicated) at 0.035% Mo cutoff from different methods.  Figure 30 shows the grade-tonnage 
curves for Mo from ID3, OK and polygonal methods. 
 
Sections and plan maps of the grades from the block model were generated to check the

17.10  RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 
The classification of the Mineral Resources was based on the geostatistical analysis of Mo 
grades and the drillhole spacing in the deposit.  An economic pit using the Lerchs-Grossman 
(L-G) algorithm with $30 Mo price, 85% Mo recovery with $12/t milling cost was designed 
to define the Mineral Resources.  The Mo price used is approximately the moving average 
price of Mo for the last three years.  All blocks within this pit had IND1 code equal to 1 
indicating they were inside. The blocks outside the pit were assigned IND1=0. 
 
The following parameters that are stored in the block model were considered to classify the 
Mineral Resources into Measured, Indicated and Inferred: 
 

DISTN  Distance to the nearest drillhole from the center of the block 
NDDH  Number of drillholes used in the interpolation of a block 
KVAR  Kriging estimation variance 
IND1 Flag indicating if a block is within an Economic Pit Design ($30 Mo pit) 

 
Because of the lack of detailed geologic information and current drillhole spacing, no blocks 
were assigned a Measured category.  Therefore, only Indicated and Inferred categories were 
considered. 
 

A block was considered as an Indicated Mineral Resource (CLASS=2) if the distance to the 
nearest drillhole from the block was less than or equal to 45 m, provided that it satisfied the 
other criteria.  The number of drillholes requirement was based on three distance intervals.  
For the distance to the nearest hole from 0-15 m range, at least one drillhole and from 
16-30 m, at least two drillholes were required.  For the distances 31-45 m, there had to be at 
least three drillholes used for the grade interpolation of the block. 
 
All the Indicated blocks also had to be below the threshold of 0.7 for the kriging estimation 
variance.  The kriging variance requirement, based on the 95th percentile kriging variance 
value, was added to make sure that the composites around the interpolated blocks were well 
distributed.  If the number of drillholes or the kriging variance requirement was not satisfied 
within these distance ranges, then the block was placed into Inferred category (CLASS=3). 
 
A block was considered an Inferred Mineral Resource if the distance to the nearest drillhole 
from the block was greater than 45 m.  The blocks outside the Economic Pit Design ($30 Mo 



    

- 97 - 

pit), and the blocks below 1,250 m elevation were excluded and not considered in the Mineral 
Resources. 
 
The distances used in the resource classification were based on the drilling density and the 
information from the global median indicator variogram determined for Mo at 0.035% cutoff 
grade.  The first and second structure ranges of the indicator variogram are approximately 24 
and 67 m, respectively.  Although the variogram range for the second structure extends to 
67 m, the correlation between composites beyond the first structure decreases more rapidly.  
Therefore, a distance value between the first and second structure ranges (45 m) was used for 
the Indicated Mineral Resources. 
 
Table 18 summarizes the Indicated Mineral Resources for Mo at incremental cutoffs from 
different methods.  Similarly, Table 19 summarizes the Inferred Mineral Resources.

18.  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
 
WGM is unaware of any other available technical information pertaining to the Storie 
molybdenum project.  Although much of the historic record has been lost, it was apparently 
accessible to Shell Canada Resources Ltd. at the time of their drilling programs in 1979-1980.  
The company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell Canada Ltd.; the two companies 
amalgamated in January, 1986, and Shell Canada Ltd. ceased active exploration for minerals.  
In 2006, Columbia Yukon contacted Shell Canada and New Jersey Zinc, but the historic 
information is no longer available.  Although the historic drilling data could be of interest, it 
is likely that it has been, or will be, supplanted by the new data from Columbia Yukon's 
extensive 2006 to 2008 programs. 
 



    

- 99 - 

19.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
The Storie Deposit was discovered almost 50 years ago and has been extensively explored by 
diamond drilling, but its limits remain unresolved. Columbia Yukon's work to date has been 
focussed on verifying and upgrading resources which were previously known, although the 
recent work has identified a higher-grade zone.  The Storie Deposit is presently open to the 
north (where it dips to depth), to the east, and to the west.  In addition, there is at least one 
untested molybdenum occurrences (M Zone) which merit further investigation.  Further work 
is warranted. 
 
During the 2006 and 2007 drilling campaigns, a quality control programs consisting of 
sample blanks, standards and duplicates (re-splits) was implemented to ensure the quality of 
the analytical data; in addition, laboratory repeat (replicate) analyses were done.  Inter-
laboratory reanalysis was also done for selected samples.  Based on standards, the results are 
accurate; based on replicate analyses, the results appear to be precise. 
 
In WGM's previous NI 43-101 report, it was concluded that the drilling of twinned holes has 
shown that data from 1979 and 1980 drillholes, as well as some of the pre-1979 historic holes, 
are reliable for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation, and that discrepancies can 
generally be explained by differences in the orientations of twinned holes.  Based on the 
analytical results whole core from three NQ and HQ 2007 drillholes twinning 2006 holes for 
which half-core was analyzed, it is inconclusive that significant molybdenum is being lost 
during the sample preparation process.  Overall, drill cuttings (sludges) contain more 
molybdenum than core, indicating some molybdenum loss during drilling, but that has not 
been quantified. 
 
WGM is satisfied that Columbia Yukon's 2006 and 2007 logging, sampling and storage 
procedures have been, and are planned to be, done in a professional manner and are in general 
accordance with standard industry practice.  The project databases have been well-organized 
for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation. 
 
Utilizing drillholes from 1979, 1980, 2006 and 2007, a Mineral Resource estimate of the 
Storie Deposit has been prepared by Mintec.  The drillhole information received from 



    

- 100 - 

Columbia Yukon geologists has been the basis of this study and was used for interpolation the 
Mo grades into the 3-D model for Mineral Resource estimation. 

 

The geostatistical analysis for the deposit was completed for Mo within the mineralized 
geologic domains to determine the spatial continuity of the mineralization in the deposit. A 
3-D block model of the deposit was built with 10x10x10 m-size blocks for Mineral Resource 
estimation.  The following points summarize the conclusions from this work: 

 

• Inverse Distance Cubed Weighting method was used to interpolate Mo grades into the 3-
D block model using 5 m composites. Ordinary Kriging and polygonal grade 
interpolations were also done for checking and comparison;  

• Composite to block code matching was used to limit the interpolation to the geologic 
domains, and outlier high-grade restrictions and capping were applied during the 
interpolation; 

• Total Indicated Mineral Resources in the deposit at zero cutoff grade are approximately 
148 million tonnes grading 0.049% Mo; 

• Total Indicated Mineral Resources in the deposit at 0.035% Mo cutoff are approximately 
85 million tonnes grading of 0.069% Mo; 

• Total Inferred Mineral Resources in the deposit at 0.035% Mo cutoff  are approximately 
26 million tonnes grading 0.064% Mo; 

• The Mineral Resource classification was based on the geostatistical variogram ranges and 
Mo grade interpolation parameters in the deposit; and 

• There is a potential for additional Mineral Resources in the deposit with more exploration 
and drilling, and to convert the Inferred Mineral Resources in some areas of the deposit 
into Measured or Indicated categories, and increase the confidence on the Mineral 
Resources.

20.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
Columbia Yukon is planning an aggressive diamond drilling program for 2008; as of the 
effective date of this report, drilling is already underway. 
 
Columbia Yukon has made arrangements with Loring Laboratories Ltd. ("Loring") of 
Calgary to set up a sample preparation facility in Cassiar; it will be operated by Loring 
personnel.  It is planned that samples will be crushed and riffle-split to produce a 250-g 
sample.  This will significantly reduce sample shipping costs and laboratory turn-around time. 
 
Rather than submitting samples for initial trace level ICP analysis followed by assaying of 
samples over a given threshold (400 ppm in 2006; 300 ppm in 2007), Columbia Yukon is 
having all 2008 samples assayed directly, using a four-acid complete dissolution with 
acetylene-nitrous oxide atomic absorption finish; higher-grade samples will be re-weighed 
and assayed gravimetrically.  This will result in further cost reduction, while further 
shortening the analytical process and turn-around time. 
 
Columbia Yukon's QA/QC programs in 2006 and 2007 were very adequate.  Unfortunately, 
the previous delays in laboratory analysis (particularly in 2007 with turn-around times of up 
to two to three months) did not allow timely review of the results of blanks and standards.  
The changes in sample preparation and laboratory analysis put in place for the 2008 program 
will largely overcome this, and allow Columbia Yukon to monitor results, including pulps 
sent to an alternate laboratory at intervals throughout the program, on a timelier basis.  Any 
problems that might arise can be spotted and any corrective measures taken.  Every 20th 
sample is being sent by Loring to Acme for inter-laboratory analysis.  WGM also 
recommends obtaining a coarse blank, which is the only way to independently check any 
potential contamination from the crushing and pulverizing steps. 
 
The ultimate drilling pattern is not yet set, and will depend on results as the program 
progresses.  Columbia Yukon has planned for 30,000 m of diamond drilling, including some 
holes on the southern limits of the deposit, but mostly laid out (50 m x 50 m centres) to 
extend the resource area to the west, where the deposit is open.  Columbia Yukon has a 
contingency to test the deposit to the east towards the m Zone if the full amount of drilling to 
the west is not used.  All 2008 holes are to be accurately surveyed during the field program 



    

- 102 - 

using differential GPS.  Additional density measurements will be taken on drill core samples 
beyond the current resource area. 
 
There is a high grade zone that seems to be continuous through the centre of the deposit. 
Mintec specifically noted that if this zone can be defined better geologically or structurally 
with further drilling in this zone, the block grade smoothing that occurs from the interpolation 
can be minimized and the grade of the Mineral Resource estimates can be improved. 
 
Metallurgical testing, which is presently underway, was originally contained in the 2007 work 
program and budget outlined in the previous WGM report.  The drill core material, however, 
was not submitted to the laboratory until March, 2008, and the tests to determine the process 
variables are more extensive than originally anticipated. 
 
Columbia Yukon is initiating a Phase III environmental baseline study, as outlined in Section 
4.4.  In addition, a contractor, Aero Geometrics of Vancouver, will take a series of aerial 
photographs over the project area in order to assist in detailed evaluation of vegetation. 
 
In WGM's opinion, Columbia Yukon's proposed program is very reasonable and appropriate.  
In addition, WGM makes the following specific recommendations: 
 
• Discrepancies between the results of original Columbia Yukon core samples and samples 

taken on the remaining halves of core by WGM suggest that the molybdenite 
mineralization may be internally complex, at least on a local scale, with veinlets 
subparallel to the drill core locally containing a significant proportion of the 
mineralization.  WGM recommends sampling the remaining half of the core from at least 
one typically mineralized 2008 drillhole to test for the degree of variability of molybdenum 
content in split core halves, and determine if the composite grade across the mineralized 
zone is consistent from one half to the other; and 

 
• As noted in Section 9, Shell Canada found, through limited testing, that molybdenum 

oxides locally comprise a significant proportion of the total molybdenum only in the near-
surface environment, to a depth of 20 m; beneath 20 m, the oxide content was 
insignificant.  WGM recommends that core analysis be expanded to include molybdenum 
oxide in the first 20 m of drillholes, with emphasis on those holes in the current Mineral 
Resource area.  It should be noted that such intervals comprise a small proportion of the 



    

- 103 - 

Storie Deposit.  Several Canadian laboratories, including Loring, are capable of 
performing oxide analysis. 

 
A budget proposed by Columbia Yukon for the 2007 program of C$6,120,000, including a 
5% contingency, is outlined in Table 20.
