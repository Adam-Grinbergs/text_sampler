1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 

This report has been prepared by Consulting Geologist, Mr. A.J. Maynard, BAppSC (Geol), 

MAIG, MAusIMM. Mr. Maynard completed three site visits through the duration of the 

exploration campaign that acquired data for the current mineral resource estimation. The 

project site was visited in March 2005, February-March 2007 and September 2007. 

This Report was prepared at the request of Core Gold Inc. ("Core" or the "Company") and 

resulted from: 

• The aforementioned site visits;  

• A review of geological and geophysical data, drill logs, technical reports and 

selected drill core from exploration programs; and 

• Available production and mining control datasets from the Cerro Verde Mine. 

1.2 Property Description and Location 

Core, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Elipe S.A. ("Elipe"), holds a portfolio of 

exploration properties in Ecuador. Amongst these, Elipe has acquired the rights to five key 

contiguous mining concessions in the Celica area which form the Dynasty Goldfield Project 

located in the Province of Loja. These concessions have been the focus of a series of 

exploration programs from 1995 through 2008. 

 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project is located at the southern end of the Occidental Andean 

Cordillera, 25km from the Peruvian border to the south with central coordinates of latitude 

04º 07' south and longitude 79º 52' west. The town of Celica is about half an hour's drive 

from the Project. 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project consists of 5 mining concessions (Pilo 9, Zar, Zar 1, Zar 3A 

and Cecilia 1) at altitudes ranging from 1,100 – 1,800 m above sea level and covers an area 

of 13,909 hectares. 120+ major veins have been identified over a northeast trending zone 

exceeding 8 km of strike extent.  Exploration drilling to date has predominantly tested to less 

than 100m vertical extent. 

The concessions, Pilo 9, Zar and Zar 1 are subject to a 3% royalty payable to the Ecuador 

Government as part of the Small Scale Mine Licensing currently issued in favour of the 

Dynasty Goldfield Project.  The other two concessions, Zar 3A and Cecilia 1 have not yet 

completed the environmental permitting process.

1.3 History, Exploration and Drilling 

The Spanish-Ecuadorian joint venture company, Enadimsa, claimed 1,350 hectares (ha) in 

the La Zanja (Cerro Verde) area for exploration in 1977. During the 1970s and 1980s the 

United Nations explored the "Curiplaya" area, 2 km east of the Dynasty Goldfield Project. 

Copper and gold were detected in small quantities. During 1991–92, BHP Exploration Ltd. 

covered the general area with concessions, but the tenements eventually lapsed after 

minimal work. Between 2001 and 2003, a private prospecting company, Ecuasaxon, 

undertook investigations in the general area and discovered anomalous gold and silver in 

quartz-sulphide veins in what is now the concession area. 

 

Since Core acquired the project in 2003 until 2007, when the Ecuadorian Government 

introduced an exploration moratorium, it carried out geological mapping, sampling, 

geophysical surveys and diamond drilling. These works resulted in the identification of high-grade 

gold and silver vein systems in the Cerro Verde, Papayal and Trapichillo areas. 

To date, a total of 201 drill holes totalling 26,733.5 metres (m) have been completed by Core, 

at Cerro Verde and Papayal. A further 2,033 rock channel samples were taken from 1,161 

surface trenches at Cerro Verde, Iguana Este, Trapichillo and Papayal by the end of 2007. 

On April 18, 2008, Ecuador's Constitutional Assembly passed a Constituent Mandate 

resolution (the "Mining Mandate"), which provided, among other provisions, for the 

suspension of mineral exploration activities for 180 days, or until a new Mining Act was 

approved. The Mining Act was published in late January 2009. The mining regulations to 

supplement and provide rules which govern the Mining Act were issued in November 2009, 

after which time the Mining Act and Regulations (collectively, the "Mining Law") were 

enacted. 

In July 2013, the Mining Law was amended to distinguishes between large, medium and 

small scale mining operations. The Mining Law provides that operations mining up to 300 

tonnes underground, or up to 1,000 tonnes open pit of mined material per day on an 

individual concession may be categorized as a small scale operation and are required to 

pay a fixed royalty of 3%.  Operations mining between 301 and 1,000 tonnes underground 

or up to 2,000 tonnes from surface of mined material per day on an individual concession 

may be categorized as a medium scale operation. Operations mining in excess of 1,000 

tonnes underground, or in excess of 2,000 tonnes from surface of mined material per day 

on an individual concession are categorized as large scale operations and are required to 

enter into an exploitation contract with the government which sets out specific terms and 

conditions of the particular operation, including a royalty between 5% and 8%.   

On August 21, 2018, The Productive Development Law was passed and amended the 

Mining Law, modifying the mining royalty from 5% - 8% to 3% - 8% (for medium and large 

scale mining) as well as eliminating the windfall tax. 

In February 2016, Core received its Environmental Authorization under new legislation in 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 3 

 

 

Ecuador.  The Dynasty Goldfield Project is qualified under Ecuador's small-scale mining 

regime and subject to a fixed 3% royalty and no windfall tax, with no need to sign a mining 

contract with the Government. The small-scale mining regime allows open pit activities with 

an exploitation volume of up to 1,000 tonnes per day per concession, a total of 3,000 tonnes 

per day for the three concessions under consideration (Pilo 9, Zar and Zar 1).  

New management of Core took control of the Company in September 2016, and in early 

2017, Core commenced limited mining on the Cerro Verde portion of the Dynasty Goldfield 

Project and transported mined material to its wholly owned Portovelo processing facility 

under the small-scale mining regime.    

 

 

1.4 Geology and Mineralisation 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project is part of the larger Dynasty Copper-Gold Belt extending north 

from Peru. The Dynasty Copper-Gold Belt lies within the compressional Inter-Andean 

Graben that is bounded by regional scale faults. The graben is composed of thick Oligocene 

to Miocene volcano- sedimentary sequences that cover the Chaucha, Amotape and 

Guamote terrains. This structural zone hosts several significant epithermal, porphyry, 

mesothermal, S type granitoid, VHMS and ultramafic/ophiolite precious metal and base 

metal mineral deposits. 

The western side of the Core concessions include volcanic rocks (breccias and andesitic 

lavas) belonging to the Cretaceous to Palaeocene Pisayambo Volcanics and Celica 

Formation which has been intruded sporadically by diorite dykes and slightly argillic gold 

bearing quartz veins and veinlets with occasional calcite-barite veins to the south, southeast 

and west. As many as 110 mineralised veins of varying thicknesses and without preferred 

orientation have been identified to date in the Dynasty Goldfield Project. The vertical extent 

of these veins has not yet been fully tested but some veins could be to depths exceeding 

400 m. 

 

The mineralised veins in the volcanics mainly occur along a faulted zone near and sub-

parallel to the contact with the Cretaceous Tangula Batholith outcropping in the east and 

south of the concessions that extends north from Peru. Within the batholith, the quartz veins 

appear to have little depth extent. 

 

The mineralised faults have undergone post mineralization reactivation by a northeast fault 

system that displaced the earlier veins by up to a few metres. A major north east lineament with 

crosscutting features at 90º angle possibly indicates "strike slip" shears with sinistral stress that 

could have generated open spaces for the infilling quartz-sulphide vein systems. 

 

A porphyry intrusion hosting gold, silver and some base metal mineralization has also been 

mapped at Trapichillo (Bravo, 2005). 

 

Three mostly steeply dipping vein systems have been identified to date at Papayal (2.2 km x 2.0 

km), Cerro Verde (1.4 km x 1.0 km) and Trapichillo - Cola (2 km x 2.5 km). Individual veins have 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 4 

 

 

been mapped continuously for up to 2,000 m along strike and remain open at depth beyond the 

current drilling. 

 

The mineralised veins are principally open space fillings along dilational faults. Banded 

seams consisting of quartz and sulphides occur especially at Cerro Verde along with 

massive quartz veins containing disseminated sulphides. The mineralised veins have a low 

carbonate content at Papayal, Trapichillo and Cola, while quartz veins coexist with quartz - 

barite - calcite, and barite being replaced by silica at Cerro Verde and part of Trapiche 

Labrado. 

 

Gold occurs in its native form along with sulphides, including pyrite, sphalerite, galena, 

arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and bornite. 

The gold/base metal mineralization is restricted to the veins and stockworks with associated 

argillic alteration. North-south mineralization zoning has been interpreted. The gold and 

silver grades vary along strike and across the vein width with "ore shoots" or "high grade 

pipes" producing very erratic values up to 600 grams per tonne (g/t) Au and 750 g/t Ag in 

some veins at Trapichillo and Papayal. A total of 74 veins have been identified between 

Cerro Verde - Yaraco- Trapichillo and Quebrada Trapiche Labrado of which 67 average >2 

g/t Au. Seven potentially economic veins were identified at Papayal and five further veins 

with grades >6 g/t Au at Trapichillo. 

 

1.5 Mineral Resource Estimate 

The effective date of the mineral resource estimate is December 31, 2018. Core has utilised 

the sampling results from 967 trenches and 152 drill holes in the Dynasty Goldfield Project 

collected between 2003 and 2008 to estimate the project resource. The QA/QC protocols 

followed by Core while sampling the drill core and trenches met industry standards and 

indicated that the sampling and assays are accurate and unbiased. In the opinion of the 

author, the sampling data is sufficient and adequate for the purposes used in this Report 

including resource estimation. 

The resource was originally estimated using GEMCOM software and verified by non-

software and other software (MineMap) based methods.  The geological modeling and 

resource estimate generated for the 2014 Report (as defined in Section 2.2 below) was 

subsequently imported into MineSight software for completion of a mine to model 

reconciliation of modeled blocks mined in 2017-18 trial mining work as completed through 

31 December 2018.   

The modeled blocks in the 2014 Report were cut against an updated surface for the resource 

area and partial blocks in the 2014 Report mineral resource estimation located above the 

new surface were deducted from the model.  The portion of the model deducted from the 

resource from trial mining at a 2g/t Au cut-off totalled 1.7% (246,000 tonnes) of the total 

mineral resource estimate in the 2014 Report. 

  



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 5 

 

 

The remaining blocks in the model were also reviewed in context of previous variography 

analysis for the available datasets and average drill spacing on nominal 100m spaced drill 

intercepts for the data collected through 2008 and the confidence on reported categories 

has also been revised for the amended blocks cut to current pit shells with previously 

reported Measured resources being converted to Indicated.

1.6 Critical Risk Factors 

The most significant risks associated with the Project are resource risks, risks inherent in 

exploration and mining, poor access to mining areas as a result of remoteness and difficult 

terrain and sovereign risk bought about through changes in government or major changes 

in government policy, laws and regulations, which are common to most mining projects in 

South America. 

1.7 Conclusions and Recommendations 

It is the author's opinion that the property merits further exploration and that Core develops a 

further exploration program. 

The Company intends to initiate further exploration work planned for the Dynasty Goldfield 

Project to underpin a more detailed block model estimation including adjusting to a statistical 

method of kriging for the mineral resource estimation.  Proposed exploration activity is 

anticipated to include, but is not limited to: (i) Comprehensive re-logging and digital 

photograph acquisition of archived diamond core material previously drilled on the project to 

improve geological modelling in 3D that can be used to effectively constrain an estimation 

with kriging methodology (ii) in-fill drilling to confirm confidence in projected mineralisation, 

and selective twinning of previous drilling for verification purposes, (iii) additional 

metallurgical studies to further improve current recovery assumptions and develop 

preliminary economic assumptions for production from deeper underground mineralization.  

The following cost estimate is based upon a systematic exploration drilling program that would 

involve: 

• 10 drill holes for approximately 1,800 m focused on confirmation drilling and 

assessing favourable drill orientations within the existing resource footprint. 

• 40 drill holes for approximately 3,500 m of step-out exploration drilling at Trapichillo 

and Iguana Este over a total area of approximately 4 km2. 

• 20 diamond drill holes for approximately 1,400 m at Papayal Norte over an area of 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 6 

 

 

approximately 1 km
2
. 

• 10 diamond drill holes for approximately 3,300 m of deeper drill tests to assess 

down-dip potential on vein zones with the highest tenor of gold mineralization 

associated with the numerous veins exhibiting attributes of substantial widths and 

continuity for exploitation by underground operations.

This conceptual exploration program would take approximately 12 months to complete with 

an estimated cost of US$4.26M for geophysical surveys, trenching, drilling, mapping and 

metallurgical testwork completed in the earlier phases of the work program, following which 

time a revised mineral resource estimation is anticipated to be completed and a revised 

exploration budget would be issued for further exploration activity to advance the Project in 

context of an initial scoping study over the Project as part of statutory reporting requirements 

to market. Depending on results obtained by this exploration program, the Company may be 

able to proceed towards conducting a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) to determine 

the potential economic viability of the Project. 

 

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 INTRODUCTION 

Core was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon) in 2000. Its common 

shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol "CGLD.V" 

and on the OTCQZ under the symbol "CGLDF". 

2.2 Terms of Reference 

The author of this Report has been requested by Core to update the technical report entitled 

"Dynasty Goldfield Project – Celica, Loja Province, Ecuador" by Al Maynard dated 22 

October 2014 (the "2014 Report") 

2.3 Report Purpose 

This report has been prepared according to NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1 to support 

disclosures made by Core in its 2018 Annual Information Form regarding the Dynasty 

Goldfield Project.  This report provides an updated current mineral resource on the project. 

This report will be filed in Canada on SEDAR and with the TSX Venture Exchange. 

2.4 Field Involvement 

The author visited the Project site and offices of the Company between 11th and 13th March, 

2005, between February 27 and March 3rd of 2007 and between 24th and 28th of September 

2007.  Discussions were held with responsible personnel and data reviewed pertaining to 

geology, mineral resource estimation and environmental issues. 

 

As there has been no further systematic exploration work undertaken by Core since 2008 

and the Company has advised that it currently has no detailed exploration or mining plan for this 

Project, the author determined that a more recent personal inspection was unnecessary. 

 

A site visit was undertaken by Cecilia Artica, Principal Geologist with Mining Plus's Lima 

Offices.  The audit of the project site was completed between October 27th to October 30th, 

2018 to provide an independent assessment of the project site to form a view of the 

exploration potential of the Dynasty Goldfield Project and assess the quality of existing 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc.

rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, the QP does not 

consider them to be material.

independent exploration work, drilled any holes nor carried out any sampling and assaying. 

The author considers the Report to be a true and accurate representation of the exploration 

potential of the Dynasty Goldfield Project. 

 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project is located at the southern end of the Occidental Andean 

Cordillera, 25km from the Peruvian border with central coordinates of latitude 04º 07' south 

and longitude 79º 52' west (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The town of Celica is about half an hour's 

drive from the Project. 

4.2 Tenure 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project comprises five un-surveyed concessions covering a total area 

of 13,909 ha. The mining concessions were acquired between 2001 and 2004 and are held 

100% by Elipe. Table 2 below gives details of the concessions held by Elipe. The Dynasty 

Goldfield Project is comprised of two gold mineralised porphyry-style systems associated 

with large quartz-sulphide vein swarms and stockworks, named the Cerro Verde and 

Papayal systems. The main mineralized deposit is located at Cerro Verde within the Pilo 9 

and Zar 1 concessions. 

 

The concession boundaries are based on map grid coordinates and the vertices of the 

concessions were surveyed and located on land.  The concessions have also been 

registered with the mining registry ARCOM (Agencia Regulacion y Control Minero). 

 
All known mineralised zones, mineral resources, mine workings, waste deposits and 

important natural features and improvements described in this report are wholly located within 

the boundaries of the Company's concessions listed in Table 2.

Table 3: Mining Concessions at Dynasty Goldfield 

Mineral rights in Ecuador are held by individuals or corporations as mining concessions upon 

application to, in the form mandated by regulation, and approval by the Government. 

 

A mining concession may not exceed 5,000 contiguous "mining hectares", a mining hectare 

having a dimension of one hectare on the surface and, conceptually, continuing vertically to 

the center of the earth, thus having a wedge-shape in the vertical dimension.  

 

A mining concession has a term of duration of up to 30 years, and will be automatically 

renewed for equal periods, providing that before expiration a written notice of intention to 

renew shall be made by the concession holder. 

 

Only the following are valid reasons for the extinction of a mining concession: 
 

• completion of the term of the concession, no notice of intention to renew being given; 

• reduction or abandonment at the discretion of the concession holder; and 

• failure to pay the concession fees. 

4.3 Royalties, Rights and Encumbrances 
 

Three concessions, Pilo 9, Zar and Zar 1, are subject to a 3% royalty in favour of the Ecuador 

Government in accordance with the Mining Law as amended in July 2013 which 

distinguishes between large, medium and smaller scale mining operations. The Mining Law 

provides that operations mining up to 300 tonnes of mined material per day on an individual 

concession may be categorized as a smaller scale operation and are required to pay a fixed 

royalty of 3%, operations mining between 301 and 1,000 tonnes of mined material per day 

on an individual concession may be categorized as a medium scale operation and are 

required to pay a fixed royalty of 4% and operations mining in excess of 1,000 tonnes of 

mined material per day on an individual concession are categorized as large scale 

operations and are required to enter into an exploitation contract with the government which 

sets out specific terms and conditions of the particular operation, including a royalty between 

5% and 8% and the application of a windfall tax. 

 

  



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 11 

 

 

Under Ecuador mining law the holders of mining concessions may install such infrastructure 

as they require, including but not limited to processing plants, smelters and refineries, 

providing that those plants are on the concession and only process minerals from the 

concession on which they are situated. 

 

Ecuadorian Mining Law states that concession holders have an implied right to use water 

and the right to benefit from any easements. Holders of mining rights may alter the course 

of rivers, as long as it does not affect third parties and as long as it is done with authorisation 

from the National Council of Water Resources. 

 

The Dynasty Goldfield concessions give the Company the right to mine the subsurface but 

not the surface minerals which belong to local residents. The Company may purchase this 

land at a fair price agreed with the owners or may negotiate access. 

 
To retain the property under the Ecuadorian Mining Law requires: 

• payment of an annual conservation fee per hectare; 

• an annual environmental update report for the concessions including details of the 

environmental protection works program to be followed for the following year. These 

works do not need approval; and 

• an annual report on the previous year's exploration and production activity.

4.4 Environmental Permitting 
 

In Ecuador, before exploration work can commence on mining concessions, the 

Environmental Ministry must approve an Environmental Management Plan covering the 

coming year's exploration program. As of October 2016, the concessions Pilo 9, Zar, and 

Zar 1 have been granted the small-scale Environmental License by the Environmental 

Ministry, which allows for exploration and exploitation activities to be undertaken on the 

project.   

 

An Environmental Management Plan aims to mitigate any impacts that may affect the 

environment by conserving the natural environment and remaining in harmony with the socio- 

economic development of villages influenced by the operation of a plant. 

 

A Management Plan for a mining operation would include the following management details: 
 

1. Description of the Project and the environmental means to be applied, including: 
 

(a) Protection of natural elements and native communities; 

(b) Prevention and control of contamination, deforestation, erosion and sedimentation; 

(c) Follow-up and monitoring; 

(d) Rehabilitation and restoration of natural elements; 

(e) Maintenance of infrastructure; 

(f) Emergency and contingency plans; 

(g) Mitigation of any negative impacts; and 

(h) Compensation to persons or communities negatively affected by the Project. 
 

2. Chronology of planned activities. 
 

3. Maps showing locations of planned activities and infrastructure. 
 

4. Waste treatment strategies. 
 

5. Evaluation that the stated program from exploration through to mining and eventual mine 

closure complies with all the relevant laws and regulations. 

6. Environmental Impact Studies for the stages of exploitation, design, construction, operation 

and dismantling. 

 

7. Environmental training and education programs for employees. 
 

The implementation of these programs will be carried out through the Company's technical, 

administrative staff and field workers.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

The most important access roads in the area are: 

• The Pan-American Highway which links Loja with Catacocha to the north and Macará 

to the south; 

• The Machala- Zaracay - Loja road which connects the Provinces of Loja and El Oro; 

• The Loja-Zamora-Gualaquiza road which connects Loja with the Province of Zamora 

Chinchipe. 

The paved Pan American Highway traverses the length of the concessions and thence 

access is gained via gravel roads and footpaths on steep to moderate sloped hills in certain 

areas. The steep topography with deeply incised river valleys means that transport can be 

difficult in areas not serviced by pre-existing tracks and roads. The topography however 

provides opportunities for cost effective development of portal access in some areas to 

potentially establish future mining of mineralization with underground mining methods.

Page 15 

 

 

 

Figure 3: Access to Concessions. 
 

 

5.2 Proximity to Population 
 

The area covered by the concessions is generally lightly populated with only a few widely 

scattered small villages. The nearest town is Celica, approximately 6 km away by road 

(Figure 2). The closest city is Loja, about 120km to the east by road. The local village, La 

Zanja, has a small general store but few other amenities. Each of these areas could provide 

a labour pool, as necessary. 

There are no informal miners on the concessions. 
 

5.3 Local Resources & Infrastructure 
 

Small local airports are located at Loja (La Toma- Catamayo), Machala, Macará and 

Gualaquiza connecting with the larger airports at Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca. 

 

Electricity for any future mining operations would need to either be generated on site, or there 

is a possibility to connect to the national electrical grid.  Water would need to be sourced from 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 16 

 

 

the local rivers, or the potential for access to ground water rights will need to be reviewed. 

The concessions provide sufficient surface and access rights for mining operations and 

suitable areas for any potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, heap 

leach pad areas and potential processing plant sites should mining commence, however 

formal studies on these items has not been undertaken given that the project is still in the 

early stage exploration phase. 

 

5.4 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The terrain is moderately steep and sparsely vegetated with low acacia scrub incised by 

shallow ephemeral river beds that are typically dry. The elevation ranges from 1,830m in the 

northeast of the Project area down to 1,100m on the south-eastern edge of the concessions. 

Slopes are mainly moderately steep, with an average grade of 20% while some intervening 

slopes are locally as steep as 30%. 

5.5 Climate 

The climate is described as dry equatorial with medium temperatures and low rainfall with 

relatively low seasonal variation in temperature and rainfall. Table 3 below summarises 

meteorological information obtained over a ten-year span through 2018 at two 

meteorological stations located 5  km and 15 km from the Project.

5.6 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The location of Loja with a population of approximately 170,000 approximately 100 km by 

road from the Project area and numerous nearby small villages and towns could provide 

both the labour force and all other facilities a mining operation needs, e.g. hotels, food 

supply, material supplies, communication resources, public security and government 

institution representatives. A strong mining background for the district guarantees skilled 

workers for underground mining and the availability of basic mining-related material in the 

Project area. Several rivers could be dammed to supply adequate fresh water for mining 

operations throughout the year. 

 

6.0 EXPLORATION HISTORY 

6.1 Prior Ownership 

In 1977, a Spanish-Ecuadorian joint venture company, Enadimsa, claimed 1,350 ha in the 

La Zanja (Cerro Verde) area for exploration. During 1991–92, BHP Exploration Ltd. covered 

the general area with concessions but the tenements eventually lapsed. Minimal work was 

carried out in the Dynasty area by BHP, having focused their efforts on other areas in 

Ecuador. 

6.2 Previous Exploration 

During the 1970s and 1980s the United Nations explored the "Curiplaya" area, 2 km east of 

the Dynasty Goldfield Project. The group drilled a total of 13 holes. Copper and gold were 

detected in small quantities.  

Between 2001 and 2003, a private prospecting company, Ecuasaxon, undertook 

investigations in the general area and discovered anomalous gold and silver in quartz-

sulphide veins in what is now the concession area. 

 

Results from historical exploration were not used in calculating the mineral resource estimates 

contained herein. 

 

Exploration by previous management of Core (previously Dynasty Metals and Mining Inc.) 

completed from 2003 to 2007 forms the basis of both the mineral resource estimation in the 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 18 

 

 

2014 Report and the mineral resource estimation herein.  

 

Small-scale trial mining has occurred on the Project since January 2017; however, 

information obtained from the ongoing mining activity does not provide new information that 

materially impacts the mineral resource estimation on the remaining material.  Datasets 

acquired on the project from recent mining activity are used in a mine to model reconciliation 

(provided in Section 13 of this report) for the purposes of (i) an assessment of confidence 

on current modeling for mineral resource estimation and (ii) to assess the impact of 

exploitation on the existing mineral resource model and deduct ounces as required to reflect 

the exploitation. 

 

The small-scale exploitation to date in the opinion of the author does not form a material 

impact on the mineral resource estimation and the author confirms that he is not in 

possession of any new information or data that materially impacts on the reliability of the 

estimates of Mineral Resources for the Dynasty Goldfield Project.   

 

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project is part of the larger Dynasty Copper-Gold Belt extending north 

from Peru. 

Subduction of the Pacific Ocean Nazca Tectonic Plate beneath the South American 

continent has produced crustal deformation forming the Andes mountain range over the last 

25 million years (Figure 5). The resultant compressional forces have produced several 

Tertiary and Quaternary tectonic basins along major regional faults that cut both the Pacific 

and Amazonian piedmonts and the Andean range itself (Figure 6). 

 
The Dynasty Copper-Gold Belt lies within the compressional Inter-Andean Graben that is 

bounded by regional scale faults. The graben is composed of thick Oligocene to Miocene 

volcano- sedimentary sequences that cover the Chaucha, Amotape and Guamote terrains. This 

structural zone hosts several significant epithermal, porphyry, mesothermal, S type granitoid, 

VHMS and ultramafic/ophiolite precious metal and base metal mineral deposits.

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

The western side of the Dynasty concessions include volcanic rocks (breccias and andesitic 

lavas) belonging to the Cretaceous to Palaeocene Pisayambo Volcanics and Celica 

Formation (Figure 7). The Celica Formation volcanics are highly fractured and composed of 

monolithic volcanic breccia, green andesite and some sub-volcanic andesite. This unit is 

intruded sporadically by diorite dykes and slightly argillic gold bearing quartz veins and 

veinlets with occasional calcite-barite veins to the south, southeast and west. As many as 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 21 

 

 

110 mineralised veins of varying thicknesses and without preferred orientation have been 

identified to date in the Dynasty Goldfield Project. The vertical extent of these veins has not 

yet been fully tested but some veins could exceed 400 m. 

 

The mineralised veins in the volcanics mainly occur along a faulted zone near and sub-

parallel to the contact with the Cretaceous Tangula Batholith outcropping in the east and 

south of the concessions. The Tangula Batholith is believed to be a northern extension of 

the large batholith forming coastal Peru. Within the batholith, the quartz veins appear to have 

little depth extent. 

The mineralised faults have undergone post mineralization reactivation by a NE fault system 

that displaced the earlier veins by up to a few metres. A clear example of this shift is recorded 

in a dominant vein in the NE sector of Cerro Verde called La Foto. 

A wide circular structure is located north and west of the neighbouring Casas Quemadas 

which forms the Yaraco and Cola valleys. 

The Catamayo River, in the west of the Dynasty concessions, follows a north east lineament 

with tributaries converging at a 90º angle possibly defining a structural "strike slip" with 

sinistral stress. This dilational stress shearing could have generated open spaces for the 

infilling quartz-sulphide vein systems. 

In the Lucarqui area, at the beginning of the Papayal and Trapichillo track, a microdiorite 

with numerous magnetite and epidote filled fractures is exposed that is interpreted to be a 

possible late igneous event unrelated to the Tangula Batholith. 

A porphyry intrusion hosting gold, silver and some base metal mineralization has also been 

mapped at Trapichillo (Bravo, 2005).

See Item 8.3 for mineralization information. 

 

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Deposit Model 

The Dynasty Goldfield mineral deposits are typical of plate boundary tectonic zones. 

Extensive epithermal gold/silver vein systems were formed by late stage hot acidic sulphur 

rich hydrothermal solutions, under intense pressure from the nearby batholith, being forced 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 23 

 

 

along dilational faults and fractures. The mineralized solutions reacted with the volcanics 

resulting in the precipitation of quartz with variable barite and sulphide minerals along with 

gold and silver. These veins range in thickness from 15 cm to 1.6 m, are easily identifiable 

in surface outcrops, and have multiple strike orientations and variable dips. To date, 110 

quartz veins hosting gold mineralization have been identified. These epithermal veins make 

up all the reported resources at the Dynasty Goldfield. 

A younger low-grade Cu-Au mineralised porphyry has been identified at La Zanja, Trapiche 

Labrado and west of Trapichillo. Drilling by Core at Trapiche Labrado produced intersections 

up to 103 m @ 0.2% Cu and 0.5 g/t Au, including 33m @ 0.32%Cu and 0.9g/t Au from 142m 

drill depth in diamond drill hole DDH138. Mapping and sampling at La Zanja have identified 

significant rock-chip Cu anomalies and widespread sericitic alteration. 

8.2 Alteration 

The dominant argillic alteration associated with the mineralization occurs along the vein 

margins as haloes, from a few centimetres to about 4 m thick, with feldspars altered to ilite, 

kaolinite and epidote. Only a few veins show abrupt transition from the quartz vein to the 

propylitic zone. Sericitic alteration fringes are hardly determinable. Most of the quartz veins 

are banded comb type, crustiform, and porous. The gold and base metal mineralization is 

located on the edges of the comb textures and within the outer bands in the banded quartz 

having formed during the latter phases. Some pale weathered adularia is found along the 

edge of the Esperanza, La Foto and Venado veins. 

The andesite and green breccia host rocks are almost unaltered with only a weak chlorite 

alteration, typical of deuteric regional alteration. Brecciated and tectonic shear zones in the 

andesites, near the Catamayo River and along the paved road, exhibit minor epidote and 

hydrothermal alteration. 

At Cerro Verde and Trapiche Labrado Creek, a widespread propylitic halo is distinguishable, 

apparently associated with a diorite intrusion located to the south of the mineralised zones. 

Between Trapiche Labrado and La Zanja, there is widespread sericitic and argillic alteration 

associated with quartz veinlets and stockworks with abundant silicified boulders along La 

Zanja Creek.



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 24 

 

 

 

8.3 Mineralization 

Three mostly steeply dipping vein systems have been identified to date: Papayal (2.2 km x 

2.0 km), Cerro Verde (1.4 km x 1.0 km) and Trapichillo - Cola (2 km x 2.5 km). Individual 

veins have been mapped continuously for up to 2,000 m along strike and remain open at 

depth beyond the current drilling (Figure 8 to Figure 10). 

The mineralised veins are principally open space fillings along dilational faults. Banded 

seams consisting of quartz and sulphides occur especially at Cerro Verde along with 

massive quartz veins containing disseminated sulphides. The mineralised veins have a low 

carbonate content at Papayal, Trapichillo and Cola, while quartz veins coexist with quartz - 

barite - calcite, and barite being replaced by silica at Cerro Verde and part of Trapiche 

Labrado. 

Gold occurs in its native form. Sulphides, in roughly decreasing order of abundance, are as 

follows: 

• iron as pyrite 

• zinc with variable iron as sphalerite 

• lead as galena 

• arsenic as arsenopyrite 

• copper as chalcopyrite 

• copper as bornite 
 

The gold/base metal mineralization is restricted to the veins and stockworks with associated 

argillic alteration. A black silver mineral occurs sporadically in the more northern areas of 

the Papayal 5 vein. Traces of malachite and neotocite have been identified within the argillic 

alteration zones along Trapiche Creek and in some peripheral veins south of Papayal 1. 

Sphalerite is very scarce except in the distal Papayal 3 and 5 veins. 

North-south mineralization zoning has been interpreted with a more epi-mesothermal 

system in the south becoming more epithermal and low sulphur towards the north at 

Trapiche Labrado. The galena and sphalerite content increases towards the NE towards 

Papayal. Chalcopyrite and covellite are rare but found throughout the entire district however 

copper does not represent an economic target. 

The gold and silver grades vary along strike and across the vein width with "ore shoots" or 

"high grade pipes" producing very erratic values up to 600 g/t Au and 750 g/t Ag in some 

veins at Trapichillo and Papayal. The distribution of values at Cerro Verde is more even, 

averaging between 5 g/t Au and 35 g/t Ag in almost all the veins, however the "mineralised 

pipes" have a greater length and depth than at Trapichillo and Papayal. 

  



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 25 

 

 

A total of 74 veins have been identified between Cerro Verde - Yaraco-Trapichillo and 

Quebrada Trapiche Labrado of which 67 average >2 g/t Au. Seven potentially economic 

veins were identified at Papayal and five further veins with grades >6 g/t Au at Trapichillo.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Exploration 

Core commenced exploration within the Project area after it acquired the rights to the 

concessions in 2003 using staff employed by the Company. This work consisted of 

geological mapping, trenching, channel sampling of trenches, geochemical soil and 

geophysical surveys and diamond drilling with the aim of identifying mineralised vein 

systems. Core was successful in its preliminary exploration efforts having discovered twelve 

mineralised vein systems at Papayal, Cerro Verde and Trapichillo-Cola (Figure 8 to Figure 

10). 

Drilling commenced in 2005 and by the end of 2006 a total of 58 drill holes for 2,602m had 

been completed in the Papayal and Cerro Verde project areas. The most important veins 

recognized are Papayal 1, Papayal 3, Papayal 5, La Esperanza, Los Encuentros, La Gorda 

and La Foto. These veins are within a NE – SW trending zone approximately 11 km long by 

3 km wide that includes swarms of massive quartz, quartz-calcite and quartz-calcite-barite-

siderite veins with varying amounts of sulfide. These veins are typical epithermal veins, 

commonly crustiform with combs and sporadic banding. 

Between 2006 and 2008 a further 143 drill holes were completed for 24,131m at Cerro Verde 

and north Papayal. At least 45 veins were identified in this drilling program with the most 

important veins being the Iguana, Flaca, Encuentros 2, Picos, Clavo, Foto Sur, Kaliman, 

Venado, Barita and Larga. 

The best gold and silver intersections were obtained at Cerro Verde and Yaraco along with 

significantly improving grades towards the north of Papayal. 

There has been no further drilling or exploration at Dynasty Goldfield since February 2008, 

and no sampling work that have a material impact on the in-ground mineral resource 

estimation.  Since early 2016, Core has completed small scale trial mining on the Cerro 

Verde prospect area within the greater Dynasty Goldfield Project.  As at December 31st, 

2018, the small scale mining activity at Cerro Verde has extracted mineralised material from 

4 of the 53 veins modelled within the resource estimate from the 2014 Report.  Additional 

datasets including regular trenching and mapping of the open pit operations have yielded 

substantial data for a mine to model reconciliation to assess confidence on ~1.4% of the 

total resource in the 2014 Report.  Available datasets, however, do not provide information 

within the remaining mineral resource estimation.  Datasets are applied to a reconciliation 

of the model here-in, and mined volumes in the resource have been deducted from the 

current mineral resource estimation, but do not provide additional information to underpin 

re-modelling of the existing resource at this time. 

  



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 29 

 

 

A total of 2,033 rock channel samples were taken from 1,161 surface trenches at Cerro 

Verde, Iguana Este, Trapichillo and Papayal by the end of 2007 (Table 5). Significant drilling 

and trenching results are summarized in Table 6 to 9. 

Core's exploration field work began with recognizing surface outcrops of altered rocks, 

structures, veins and mineralization. Once a vein outcrop/target has been selected, detailed 

geological mapping was carried out together with structural and positioning observations. 

In terms of Core's trenching protocol, after a surface vein outcrop was mapped and 

technically recorded, several photographs were taken from different angles. The trench is 

carefully planned always perpendicular to the vein strike. Trenches can be made manually 

or using an excavator depending on the access facility. Manual trenches (pick and shovel) 

have been the more appropriate and easy exploration surface works being developed in the 

concession areas. They have been extremely useful and providing accurate, solid and 

abundant data. 

A trench was planned after general geological and geochemical sampling has been carried 

out, and after having obtained the corresponding surface land permits and fulfilling all 

environmental requirements. The trench is designed in a manner such that there will be 

minimum impact to soil and agriculture. 

After starting a trench program in a specific location (vein), a differential GPS landmark is 

set to have a topographical control to tie all exploration works/sampling using tape and 

compass or total station. In places where no differential GPS land marks where located, a 

normal GPS location UTM PSAD56) was used. 

A trench at Dynasty, an elongated pit of about 1.2 m wide and 1.5 m to 3 m deep, dug until 

finding fresh rock of the target of interest or vein/structure. Trenches along structures such 

as veins are designed with 25 m (majority) to 50 m spacing along vein strike. They are dug 

by hand using picks and shovels and manpower. The organic surface layer is segregated, 

as well as each single soil horizon (A, B, C), in order to conduct appropriate reclamation 

afterwards. 

Once the structure/vein was clearly exposed in the trench, all technical measurements and 

recordings are executed. UTM coordinates (usually PSAD 56 for Ecuador) at the beginning 

of the trench plus direction and sampling distances; elevation, vein bearing and dipping, 

geological, mineralogical and petrographical observations, photographs, etc. 

The trench depth depends on the soil cover and also the topographical location of the 

exploration point. Normally flat or valley sectors have a thicker soil layer (up to 3 m) than 

those located in higher elevations. Watershed lines normally show outcropping solid rock. 

Once the trench is completely clean and the structure/vein exposed clearly, a perpendicular 

channel of about 5 cm wide x 5 cm deep is constructed with a portable saw or using chisel 

and hammer. One or several samples of about 1 m length or less are collected from the 

structure/vein taking care to avoid contamination. The vein foot and hanging walls are also 

sampled if they show evidence of mineralization such as quartz veinlets. Each sample 

normally weighs about 5 to 6 kg. The aim is to sample the totality of the mineralized rock, 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 30 

 

 

but when sample is bigger that the specified weight then an in situ riffling is executed to 

obtain a representative sample. The remaining sample material is normally used to replicate 

samples (duplicates). 

 

9.2 Adequacy of Exploration 

In the opinion of the author, the exploration programs completed to-date by Core were 

appropriate for the known deposit types and mineralization styles and have delineated 

significant gold–silver mineralization and, if continued, could well continue to develop the 

exploration potential of the Project.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Drilling 

To date, a total of 201 drill holes totalling 26,733.5 m have been completed by Core at Cerro 

Verde and Papayal. 

Two Hydracore 2000 wire-line diamond drills owned by Elipe were used for this drilling. All 

drilling was carried out using triple tube gear to maximize core recovery. The upper 10 m of 

each hole was drilled with HW (76 mm core diameter) rods and cased off, then HQ (63 mm 

core diameter) rods were used to 100 m followed by NQ (48 mm core diameter) for the 

remainder of the hole. The holes diameters are usually between 15 mm and 22 mm larger 

than the core diameters. 

Downhole surveying was carried out on all drill holes with dip and azimuths measured 

regularly down the length of the hole, generally at 50 m intervals. 

At the completion of each drill run the core was carefully transferred from the core barrel to 

the core trays. At the end of each shift the core trays were sealed with lids and transported 

to the core storage facility near the mine office where the core recovery, lithology and 

structural features of core was logged by the field geologist. After the core was logged by 

the geologist the core was marked up and sampled. 

Since the drilling was all collared at the surface and the locations of drill sites were 

determined by accessibility in steep topography, and the orientation of the mineralised veins 

varied considerably along strike and down dip, the holes intersect the veins at various 

oblique angles. Most holes intersect the veins nearly perpendicular to strike but at 

penetration angles well less than perpendicular to the dip. As a result the drill intersection 

widths are significantly longer than the vein true width, however the resource modelling 

considers the drilling in 3D and adjusts the drill intersections accordingly. 

Drilling targets were determined by detailed geological mapping and the channel sample 

assay results from trenches. Assay results in the drilling showed that higher grade gold and 

silver mineralization extends from the surface to depths of up to 250 m. Core's drilling 

program confirmed the existence of widespread gold and silver mineralization over the area 

drilled and extended the continuous strike length of the mineralized corridor to approximately 

3.5km of surface mineralization. 

See Item 9.2 for further information on results of Core's drilling at the Dynasty Goldfield 

Project. 

Sampling Method and Approach 
 

The core recoveries were recorded for every hole and in all cases recoveries exceeded 95% 

over the mineralised intervals. 

 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 35 

 

 

After the field geologist logged the core, the sampling limits determined by logged veins and 

alteration zones were marked with a pen, and then another line was marked along the long 

axis of the core along which the core would be split by diamond saw. This line is marked as 

close as possible perpendicular to the edges of the quartz veins and designed to make an 

unbiased and representative sample of the mineralization in the veins and altered zones. 

The core was then cut by diamond saw along the marked lines by trained technicians with 

one half of the core retained in the core tray for future reference and the other half bagged 

in a uniquely labelled calico bag to be dispatched to the laboratory for chemical analysis. 

The calico bags were stored in sealed plastic drums until they were dispatched to the 

laboratory under continual supervision by a Company representative to ensure the security 

of the sample. 

A total of 3,555 samples from drill core were collected by trained company staff for chemical 

analysis at BSI Inspectorate Sample Preparation Laboratory, an internationally accredited 

laboratory located at Quito and certified as complying with ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate FS 

34143). In most holes only veins and mineralised structures, as logged by the geologists, 

were analyzed for Au along with 32 other elements including Ag, Cu, Pb and Zn. In a few 

holes where wide zones of Cu mineralization were logged by the geologist, continuous one 

metre samples were collected through the mineralised zone. The split core is presently 

stored at Core's facility at Divino Niño outside Celica. 

The author reviewed drill core from several holes and confirmed the presence of the quartz 

veins and sulphide mineralization as previously logged in the core. Observed core recovery 

was good ranging from 95% to 100% and the sampling orientation is representative for the 

core inspected.  A more recent inspection of the core storage facility found that maintenance 

of the core facility has been neglected since completion of the drilling programmes.   

From more recent inspections, a number of wooden boxes storing both cut, and un-cut (un-

sampled) core material are found to be in poor condition from a combination of factors 

including a lack of core shelving system, resulting in over stacking and wooden boxes 

damaged by vermin, insects and rotting over time.  Core Gold has recently initiated a 

program to recover core from damaged boxes and put into new boxes, however a small 

percentage of the core is anticipated to be unrecoverable for future sampling and reference 

purposes (Artica, 2018). 

Trenches were cut at all three prospects to enable geological mapping below any 

overburden and to take samples below the surficial weathering zone of the veins and altered 

zones exposed in the trenches, generally at between 1.5m and 3.0m depth. The sampled 

channels 5cm wide and 5cm deep were cut by either chisels or portable diamond saw along 

the cleaned trench floor producing samples each weighing an average 5-6kg. The trenches 

were cut as close as possible perpendicular to the veins to a maximum depth of 3.0m. 

Samples were collected between geological boundaries by trained personnel, covering the 

mapped mineralization as well as additional 1.0m samples in the mapped footwall and 

hangingwall waste. The geological boundaries, generally quartz veins and highly altered 

zones, between which the samples are collected were identified by field geologists. Care

was taken that these samples represented the intervals being sampled and there was no 

bias due to selectively sampling any particular type of rock or mineral such as soft or sheared 

zones. The sample limits were accurately surveyed by Differential GPS (DGPS). 

 
 

 

Figure 13: Photograph of Sampled Trench. 

The drilling, trenching and sampling methods employed at Core are considered by the author 

as appropriate and meet all the necessary mining industry standards for the type and style 

of mineralization tested and has resulted in unbiased representative samples suitable for 

resource modelling and estimation. 

The samples collected from the trenches were from below the surficial weathering zone in 

fresh rock. 

It is the author's opinion that the sampling methods are appropriate for the gold/silver 

mineralization.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

11.1 Sample Methods 

Trench samples were stored in plastic bags of 30 x 60 cm and sealed with plastic locks. A 

sampling record was kept by geologists with the corresponding sample ID and description 

(geology, structural, location UTM, mineralogy, lithology, etc.) for each sample. Trench 

sampling locations were charted using aluminum tags. 

 

A standard, blank and duplicates were inserted each batch of 50 samples comprising 

approximately 6% of QA/QC sampling. 

Once trench sampling was completed, the trench is immediately reclaimed according to the 

Environmental Managing Plan approved by local authorities. 

Before submitting samples to BSI Inspectorate, each sample bag was fully re-checked and 

weighted to ensure it has been properly identified. Sacks able to contain no more than eight 

samples each were utilized to facilitate transportation. A chain of custody was set for the 

transportation process and confirmation as received once samples reached the lab. 

 

Requested sample assay results were reported in ppm. 
 

All the sample preparation, i.e. drying, crushing and pulverising, was done at the BSI Inspectorate 

Sample Preparation Laboratory in Quito, Ecuador by the laboratory staff. The following 

procedures were employed at the laboratory: 

• dried for at least 12 hours at 60º C; 

• crushed in a jaw crusher to 95% -10 mesh (95% of the sample will pass through a wire 

sieve with 2.0 mm openings); 

• pulverised in a ring pulveriser to 95% -40 mesh (0.4 mm openings) then split in a Jones 

riffle splitter; 

• 300 g of material retained for further processing with the remainder stored in the BSI 

warehouse; 

• pulverised in a Labtech ring pulveriser to > 95% -150 mesh then split in a Jones riffle 

splitter; and 

• 100 g pulp splits sent to the laboratory's facilities in Lima, Peru for analysis with the 

remaining 200 g stored in the BSI warehouse. 

11.2 Chemical Analysis Method 

Gold was analyzed using the fire assay (FA) method on 30 g charges followed by either Atomic 

Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) detection or gravimetric measurement of gold, depending on the 

weight of the gold button produced by the fire assay method. Silver assays were determined using 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 38 

 

 

 
aqua regia digestion with an AAS assay finish. A further 31 other elements including copper, lead 

and zinc were analysed by the Inductive Coupled Plasma (ICP) method. 

The laboratory followed industry standard QA/QC procedures when preparing and analysing 

the samples including the use of blanks, standards and repeats. Where anomalies were 

found in the QA/QC results appropriate action was taken, usually the sample batch was 

completely re-assayed. 

11.3 Specific Gravity Measurements 

A total of 19 samples, mostly drill core, were submitted to the National Metallurgical Laboratories 

of the Escuela Politecnica Nacional Departamento de Metalurgia Extractiva (the "Institute") for 

Specific Gravity (SG) tests using the waxed sample - water displacement method. The average 

measured SG for the mineralization was 2.7, which is typical for a massive quartz vein. The 

Institute is located in Ecuador, and although its laboratory does not have an international 

accreditation it is the highest-ranking university in Ecuador and as such is competent to conduct 

SG testing.

11.4 Sample Security 

Core employed rigorous sample security procedures when transporting samples between 

the sampling sites and at the laboratory. The samples were recorded and logged before 

being sealed in plastic drums on site and were continuously monitored by Company 

personnel until they were delivered to the laboratory where all the samples were checked 

against the Company's inventory by the laboratory staff and a receipt was issued for every 

delivery. 

11.5 Sample Locations 

All drill hole collars and sample trenches have been surveyed by qualified surveyors using 

differential GPS (DGPS) instruments with accuracies within 10cm in all 3 dimensions. 

All drill holes had their dip and azimuths measured regularly down the length of the hole, 

generally at 50 m intervals, to measure any down-the-hole deviations. 

11.6 Adequacy of Sample Preparation, Security and Analytical 

Procedures 

It is the author's opinion that the sampling methods, preparation, security and analytical 

procedures have been adequate and in keeping with requirements for this stage of 

exploration work and to define the resources in the categories as stated. There is no 

evidence that the sample techniques used have resulted in any sample bias and they are 

therefore representative of the mineralization being tested by the sampling. 

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

Core used a variety of QA/QC techniques to measure the accuracy and precision of the 

assays in the database including the use of standards, blanks and duplicates. 

Recognised gold standards from Gannet Industries of Australia were used to determine the 

accuracy of the gold assays. Standards were inserted at a rate of one every 40 (2.5%) in 

each batch of samples, collected from drill core and trenching, sent to the laboratory for 

chemical analysis. 

Blanks inserted in sample batches measure any contamination between samples during the 

preparation stage at the analytical laboratory. Blanks were prepared by Core from unaltered, 

dark green, massive, fine grained andesite sourced on site. These blanks were included in 

each sample batch, collected from drill core and trenching, and if a blank returned an 

elevated gold or silver value the samples were re-assayed. 

Duplicates inserted in sample batches measure the accuracy and repeatability of sampling 

and laboratory assays. Duplicates of pulps were regularly assayed at sample intervals of 1 

per 40 to 60 samples. Figure 14 to Figure 18 show plots of the QA/QC data. The graphs 

show that the QA/QC results are within acceptable limits of +/- 3 Standard Deviations.

Figure 18: Plot of Blank Assays within +/- 3SD. 

No independent samples were collected by the author to verify the quality of the assays in 

the database since the QA/QC procedures followed by Core are sufficiently rigorous to 

ensure the assays used in the resource modelling are reliable. 

The author verified the integrity of the database by comparing several assay certificates as 

received from the laboratory with their transcription into the Company's database and 

records. The transcribed assays were found to be accurate. 

In the opinion of the author, the data is sufficient and adequate for the purposes used in this 

Report including resource estimation, and that the sample preparation security and 

analytical procedures followed relating to the Project are adequate for ensuring that the data 

is suitable for the resource model, as described in this Report. 

 

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL 

TESTING 

No metallurgical or mineral processing tests have been carried out by Core on the Project 

other than bulk density measurements. 

Small scale mining operations at the Dynasty Goldfield Project ongoing since early 2017 

have been advanced in accordance with the Mining Law as amended in July 2013 and is 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 43 

 

 

the first fully permitted open pit mine in Ecuador.  The 2013 amendment(s) to the Mining 

Law distinguishes between large, medium and smaller scale mining operations. The Mining 

Law provides that operations mining up to 300 tonnes underground and 1000 tonnes per 

day open pit of mined material per day on an individual concession may be categorized as 

a smaller scale operation 

Small scale mining in 2017 commenced proximal to the southern extent of the Dynasty 

resource area on a prospect area previously referred to as Cerro Verde.  The Cerro Verde 

mine has only exploited 5 veins to date (Gorda-Foto, Encuentros, Venado and Esperanza 

veins) of 120 veins in the existing resource model, and in the mine development process 

Core has identified an additional 6 'blind' veins' in ongoing development work. 

Oxide material to a depth of up to 60m on the Esperanza Vein have been shipped to Core's 

wholly owned Portovelo processing facility.  In the 12 month period ending 31 December 

2018, metallurgical recoveries at the Portovelo plant have ranged from 80 to 85% and 

averaged 82.3% through a plant that was purpose built for sulphide material.  Increased 

recoveries are anticipated to be achievable with metallurgical study work and optimisation 

of a plant design for the material being processed. 

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

The Mineral Resource Estimates described in this section have been prepared for the 

Dynasty Goldfield property to conform with the guidelines set forth by National Instrument 

43-101 and incorporates terms as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy 

and Petroleum Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines 

(adopted in 2014). The interpretation, assumptions and parameters used in preparing this 

estimate are described in the following sections. 

The Dynasty Goldfield deposits are considered to be a gold/silver deposit. Other minor 

mineral concentrations have not been considered as part of these estimates. 

14.1 Geological and Resource Modelling 

Further feasibility work will be required to determine the extent to which the estimate of 

Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, 

taxation, socio- economic, marketing, political and other relevant issues. 

The Company's previous mining operations at its Zaruma Project, where similar style 

mineralization was mined from late 2013 through 2015 producing approximately 61,769 

ounces of gold sales from 239,000 tonnes of mineralised material mined at an estimated 

average mining grade of 8g/t Au.  The Zaruma operation used an economic cut-off grade 

based on the cut-off grade estimate calculation in Table 11. Since the mineralization at 

Dynasty Goldfield is similar to Zaruma, this calculation has been considered a reasonable 

conceptual basis for a cut-off grade determination at Dynasty Goldfield.

Further to the economic factors considered by a comparative analysis of the Company's 

previous operations (Table 11 above), the Company has also engaged in small scale trial 

mining on the Dynasty resource area from early 2017 on a small portion of the project area 

referred to as the Cerro Verde Mine.  The Cerro Verde operation underpins the previously 

reported basis for a similar economic cut-off grade based on the cut-off grade estimate 

calculation in Table 12 .

There is no material changes to economic assumptions used for the basis of the cut-off 

grade applied in the 2014 Report versus the current report.  A reasonable economic cut-off 

grade for underground mining of mineralised quartz veins at Dynasty Goldfield, based on 

the calculations in Tables 11 & 12, has been rounded down to 2.0 g/t Au. 

14.2 Mine to Model Reconciliation  

Core Gold commenced small scale mining on a portion of the mineral resource estimation 

in early 2017.  The author has completed a review of a mine to model reconciliation of the 

exploitation completed as at 31 December 2018 against the mineral resource estimation 

previously announced in the 2014 Report. 

The small scale exploitation currently being carried out has been assessed to have a non-

material impact on the existing resource estimation, with any data collected relating to 

material deducted from the resource estimation, the small scale mining activity from 2017

through 2018 does not generate any new information or data relating to the current mineral 

resource estimation. 

Five mineralised veins previously modelled are impacted by the trial mining at Cerro Verde.  

In mining the area of the five modelled veins more than eleven individual veins were 

developed for mining in the 2-year period ending 31 December 2018.  

Including the additional "blind" veins not identified in drilling or surface sampling to be 

modelled, the total volume mined 69% more mineralised tonnes at a 2 g/t Au cut-off versus 

the model, averaging 3.37 g/t Au mining grade (against a 3.96 g/t Au modeled grade), which 

is 15% lower gold grade than the estimated grade in the model for the total volume of 

material mined.  This yields a total 44% increase in gold ounces extracted (and 46% increase 

in silver ounces) in the volume of material mined in trial mining on 1.4% of the current model. 

On average, for the five veins modelled, mining 44% more mineralised tonnes at a 2 g/t Au 

cut-off, averaging 3.28 g/t Au (against a modeled 3.96 g/t Au), which is 17% lower than the 

estimated grade for the modelled blocks versus the mined veins in the model.  This yields a 

total 19% increase in gold ounces extracted (and an 18% increase in silver ounces) in a vein 

to vein comparison of the portion of the modeled veins representing 1.4% of the total 

resource.

mineral resource estimation in Table 15 above. 

14.3 Method 

Resources for all the identified veins from trenching and drilling through completion of 

exploration activity in 2008 were calculated using the polygonal method. This method was 

considered appropriate by the Company and the author for vein mineral deposits exhibiting no 

major variations and tectonically controlled. 

Long sections were created along each vein separately with the topography as the upper 

limit.  Polygons were then created around the drilling and trench samples with squares with 

sides in the 2014 Report.  Veins were wireframed in GEMCOM software for determination 

of mineralised volumes, and the level of confidence was assigned based on preliminary 

variogram statistics as follows: 50 m for Indicated Resources and >50 m – 100 m for Inferred 

Resources. See Appendix 1 for resource cross-sections for selected veins incorporated in 

the resource estimate.  

The author determined that trench sampling was appropriate in the context of surface 

exploration for the types of deposits at the Dynasty Goldfield Project. Trench sampling 

followed a continuous channel sample in the mineralized rock at the bottom of each trench. 

The samples were larger than those obtained by drill core and the assays were similar to 

those from drilling and enabled the Company to derive accurate and direct vein structural 

data. Both trench and drill samples could be replicated and re-assayed. 



Form 43-101F1 -  Core Gold Inc. 
Page 49 

 

 

The polygonal estimates are based on a total of 201 drill holes totalling 26,733.5 m at Cerro 

Verde and Papayal along with a further 2,033 rock channel samples taken from 1,161 

surface trenches at Cerro Verde, Iguana Este, Trapichillo and Papayal. 

The area of each polygon was multiplied by the vein width to get a volume of the vein, then 

multiplied by the specific gravity (2.7) to calculate the tonnes. Veins <0.20 m were not 

considered in the resource calculation. Indicated resources were only derived from drilling 

samples while veins sampled by trenching, without diamond drilling, were only categorized 

as Inferred. Vein estimated true thickness, density and precious metal grades were assumed 

constant in the polygon area surrounding a drill intersection. The search ranges (radii) used 

based on experience at similar deposit resources. 

All resource modelling in the 2014 Report was carried out by qualified local geologists 

supervised by either a geologist or mining engineer who are members of the AusIMM. 

For the purpose of this report, the geological modeling and resource estimate generated for 

the 2014 Report was imported into MineSight software for completion of a mine to model 

reconciliation of modeled blocks mined in 2017-18 trial mining work as completed through 

31 December 2018 (refer to Section 14.2 above).   

The modeled blocks in the 2014 Report were cut against an updated surface for the resource 

area and partial blocks in the 2014 Report mineral resource estimation located above the 

new surface were deducted from that model.  The portion of the model deducted from the 

previously reported resource as a result of trial mining at a 2g/t Au cut-off totalled 1.7% 

(246,000 tonnes) of the total mineral resource estimate in the 2014 Report. 

The previously reported resource of 2,909,000 tonnes averaging 4.7 g/t Au (437,000 oz Au) 

measured and 3,958,000 tonnes averaging 4.6 g/t Au (585,000 oz Au) indicated is revised 

to 6,662,000 tonnes averaging 4.65 g/t Au (991,000 oz Au) indicated as a result of polygons 

deducted from the model as a result of small scale mining on the project and measured 

category resource being re-classified as indicated in the current mineral resource estimate.  

The previously reported Inferred resource estimate of 7,825,000 tonnes averaging 4.4 g/t 

Au is revised to 7,284,000 tonnes averaging 4.4 g/t Au as a result of small-scale mining on 

the project.  With no material change to the available data for estimation of resource on the 

remaining mineralisation, the QP considered the adjustment to the mineral resource 

estimation appropriate to account for any depletion of the resource estimate due to small 

scale, near surface operations completed on a small portion of the known area of 

mineralisation. 

The QP has considered the methods used to estimate the resources and the parameters 

used including the minimum vein widths, lower cut-off grades and upper grade cutting and 

believe that they are reasonable for the style of mineralization being modelled and the mining 

methods that would be used.

The Dynasty Goldfield Project has no unusual environmental, permitting, legal, title and 

taxation features that will materially affect any future mining operations. The country has a 

long history of mining and there are several successful mining operations nearby on similar 

mineral deposits. 

 

Critical risk factors applicable to the project are as follows: 
 

- Mining cost risk: mining costs are rising in the current world market, the effect of which 

could be offset by lower labour costs in Ecuador. 

- Metallurgical risk: test work needs to be completed to assess recoverability of both 

precious and base metals. 

- Sovereign, country, geographical and topographical risks. 

- Market price of precious metals: a significant decrease in the market price of precious 

metals could affect the viability of any future development on this project.

16.0 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

The Dynasty Goldfield Project comprises of five mining concessions in southern Ecuador. 

These concessions have been the focus of a series of exploration programs since 1995. The 

Project area has undergone mapping, sampling, geophysical surveys and diamond drilling. 

These works resulted in the identification of high-grade gold and silver vein systems in the 

Cerro Verde, Trapichillo, Iguana Esta and Papayal areas. 

 

A total of 967 trenches and 201 drill holes have been sampled in the Dynasty Goldfield from 

2003, when Dynasty acquired the concession rights, to February 2008. Dynasty has not 

engaged in any further exploration activity since that time.   

 

A resource estimate has been calculated using polygonal methods. Table 18 summarises the 

current mineral resource estimate for the Dynasty Goldfield Project:

It is the author's opinion that there is good potential for outlining further gold and silver 

resources at depth and along strike of the same geological structures that Core have already 

been successfully explored. 

 

The author makes the following observations regarding sample collection:  

 

Drilling 

• Core have employed drilling methods and associated procedures to ensure the 

highest core recovery possible. 

• Drill collar and downhole surveying follows industry best practice so the potential for 

significant impact on results is minimal. 

 

• The sampling methods and QA/QC protocols followed by Core when sampling the drill 

core meet industry standards and would provide reliable assays suitable for resource 

estimation. 

 

• The geological logging of the core is considered to be in line with industry best practice 

and consistent with other systems employed at narrow-vein deposits. 

 

• Structural logging of core does not incorporate any method of core orientation to 

calculate or estimate vein orientations in the core logging.

Page 55 

 

 

 
Trenching 

 

• The sampling methods and QA/QC protocols followed by Core when sampling 

surface trenches meet industry standards and would provide reliable assays suitable 

for resource estimation. 

 

• Weathering effects at the surface could produce biased results, depending on the 

nature of the weathering either high or low, so assay results of samples collected at 

the surface should not be projected deeper than the weathered zone for resource 

estimation. 

 

Sample preparation and assaying 
 

• Sampling of diamond drill core and trenches is of a consistent and of a repeatable nature, 

with appropriate QA/QC methodologies employed. 

 

• The assay method used is considered to be appropriate for this style of mineralization. 

• The laboratories used for chemical analysis are internationally accredited. 

• The level of compliance and lack of bias displayed by the standard reference samples, 

duplicates and blanks is good and demonstrates the reliability of the gold and silver grades 

used for the Mineral Resource estimate. 

 

• Security of samples being transported to the laboratory is adequate. 
 

Mineral resource estimates 
 

• The data density from sampling trenches and diamond drilling is sufficient for the reported 

resources in the assigned categories however further surface mapping, trenching and 

diamond drilling is required on most of the veins explored to date before there is sufficient 

reliable data for a definitive feasibility study. 

• The polygonal estimation method is valid for the narrow veins modelled however the 

author recommends that the resource estimates are progressively updated using more 

modern computer modelling methods with mining industry standard software. 

 

• Geostatistical variography should be used on the vein assays to statistically determine 

valid search distances for grade interpolations and resource categorisation. 

 

• The reconciliation of the current model against trial mining on 1.4% of the resource 

where 19% more ounces of gold were mined than estimated in the modelled veins 

of the polygonal resource estimates, and 44% more gold was mined in the same total 

pit volume as a result of additional veins discovered in the process of mining.

The main risks pertaining to this project are as follows: 

• Resource risk due to changes in geological interpretation, variations in the grade 

mined, assumed mining and processing parameters and new geological information 

and/or sampling data; 

• Commodity prices and exchange rates are constantly changing; 

• Risks inherent in exploration and mining include, among other things, successful 

exploration and identification of ore reserves, satisfactory performance of mining 

operations if a mineable deposit is discovered and competent management; 

• Risks associated with obtaining renewal of tenements upon expiry of their current 

term, including the grant of subsequent titles where applied for over the same 

ground. The grant or refusal of tenements is subject to ministerial discretion and 

there is no certainty that the renewal of tenements will be granted; 

• The risk of material adverse changes in the government policies or legislation of 

Ecuador that may affect the level and practicality of mining activities including 

regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of 

minerals and environmental protection; 

• Environmental management issues with which the Company may be required to 

comply from time to time; 

• Poor access to mining areas as a result of remoteness and difficult terrain; and 

• The availability and high cost of quality management, contractors and equipment for 

exploration, mining, and the corporate and administration functions and the cost of 

identifying, negotiating with and engaging the same. 

Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Substantial 

expenditures are required to establish ore reserves through drilling, to develop metallurgical 

processes to extract the metal from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to develop 

the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. The 

economics of exploring and developing mineral properties is affected by many factors 

including, among others, the risks pertaining to the project outlined above. 

No assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of minerals will be realized 

or that any potential quantities and/or grade will ever qualify as a reserve, or as a 

commercially mineable (or viable) deposit which can be legally and economically exploited. 

Where expenditures on a property have not led to the discovery of mineral reserves, incurred 

expenditures will generally not be recoverable.

17.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

It is recommended that the Company continues with surface mapping, trenching and diamond 

drilling, to fully delineate the extent of the mineralization along strike and at depth in all the 

known veins. 

Further infill drilling on the higher-grade veins is required to improve the reliability of the 

resource estimates prior to commissioning a preliminary economic assessment (PEA).  

Additional studies are required to define variography of the deposit and define on optimal 

drill spacing for definition of drill spacing for any continuation of resource delineation work.  

A more detailed block model based on statistical spatial interpolation method such as kriging 

to generate a block model. 

Large diameter core holes should be drilled in the better defined, and most likely to be mined, 

veins to provide representative samples for metallurgical testing to determine optimal 

processing plant design to maximise gold and silver recoveries. 

It is recommended that the Company continues with its existing "Social Program" to maintain 

good relations with the local populace. 

Exploration activity is proposed to include, but is not limited to: (i) Comprehensive re-logging 

and digital photograph acquisition of archived diamond core material previously drilled on 

the project to improve geological modelling in 3D that can be used to effectively constrain 

an estimation with kriging methodology (ii) in-fill drilling to confirm confidence in projected 

mineralisation, and selective twinning of previous drilling for verification purposes, (iii) 

additional metallurgical studies to underpin assumption or predictions to underpin 

anticipated preliminary economic assumptions.  The following cost estimate is based upon 

a drilling program that would involve: 

• 10 drill holes for approximately 1,800m focused on confirmation drilling and 
assessing favourable drill orientations within the existing resource footprint 

• 40 drill holes for approximately 3,500 m of step-out exploration drilling at Trapichillo 
and Iguana Este over a total area of approximately 4 km2. 

• 20 diamond drill holes for approximately 1,400 m at Papayal Norte over an area of 
approximately 1 km2. 

• 10 diamond drill holes for approximately 3,300m of deeper drill tests to assess 
down-dip potential on vein zones with the highest tenor of gold mineralisation 
associated with the more veins with attributes of substantial widths and continuity. 

This conceptual exploration program would take approximately 12 months to complete, 

during which time a revise mineral resource estimation should be completed with initial 

scoping study level economic considerations to determine if the Company may be able to 

proceed towards conducting a PEA.
