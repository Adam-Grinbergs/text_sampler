 1 SUMMARY 
INTRODUCTION 

Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was requested by 

Duluth Metals Limited (DML) to update the resource estimate that Scott Wilson RPA 

had prepared in July 2008 for the Nokomis Cu-Ni-PGE-Au Deposit and to prepare a 

Technical Report complying with the requirements of National Instrument (NI) 43-101.  

The Nokomis Deposit is located on the DML Nokomis Property near Ely, Minnesota, 

U.S.A.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA, and precursor firm Roscoe Postle Associates Inc., have prepared 

previous NI 43-101 Resource Estimates and Technical Reports on the Maturi Extension 

Properties (previous name for the Nokomis Property) for Wallbridge Mining Company 

Limited/Wallbridge America Corp. (WM) dated December 2005 (Cargill, 2005a), and 

DML dated May 2006, August 2007 and July 2008.  NI 43-101 compliant Preliminary 

Assessment reports on the Nokomis Property were prepared by Scott Wilson RPA in 

January 2008 and January 2009. 

 

LAND STATUS 

The Nokomis Property is located in northern Minnesota, Lake County, Townships 

61N and 62N, Range 11W.  

 

State leases, private leases and federal permits for the Nokomis Property are 

registered to Duluth Metals Corp. (DMC), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned 

subsidiary of DML. DML is a corporation registered in Ontario, Canada that is listed on 

the Toronto Stock Exchange. DMC has also leased private mineral rights and owns 480 

acres (194 ha) of private surface rights within the property.  DML and DMC are both 

authorized to carry on business in Minnesota.   

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

DML, through its U.S. subsidiary DMC, now holds seven State of Minnesota non-

ferrous mineral leases, two federal prospecting permits and four private leases covering 

11 contiguous parcels of lands containing the Nokomis Deposit.  These combined 

properties are referred to as the Nokomis Property.  The total Nokomis land package held 

by DMC covers 3,001 acres (1,215 ha) as measured by its mineral rights holdings.  The 

lands are located in the Superior National Forest area, but some of the surface and 

subsurface rights are held by either the State of Minnesota or by private landowners.  

Each lease or permit is subject to rules which may differ between jurisdictions.   

 

Additional state and private lands outside the Nokomis Property have been leased or 

optioned and added to DMC's holdings. These additional lands either lie within the 

Duluth Complex and are prospective for further discoveries of economic mineral deposits 

or are considered to be strategic for the development of the Nokomis Deposit. DMC's 

total holdings now stand at approximately 18,500 acres (7,487 ha) of mineral rights and 

14,000 acres (5,666 ha) of surface rights. 

 

EXPLORATION HISTORY 

Exploration has been conducted in the vicinity of the Nokomis Property, both in the 

Duluth Complex and in the footwall metasedimentary and granitic rocks, since the late-

1800s for iron and, from the 1950s, for copper and nickel.  Drilling for copper and nickel 

has been carried out by major mining companies including Inco, Duval, Kennecott, 

Newmont and US Steel.  In 1985, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources re-

analyzed core from the early copper-nickel exploration drill holes and found significant 

PGEs.  This prompted the re-evaluation of a number of known deposits in the western 

portion of the Duluth Complex.  

 

Recent exploration by DML's predecessor company, WM, began in 1999 primarily 

on the adjoining Maturi Property and nearby Spruce Road Property, now held by 

Franconia Minerals Corporation (Franconia).  WM began acquiring lands that now 

comprise the Nokomis Property in 1999 and 2000.

From March 2006 to January 2007, DML diamond drilled 10,384.5 m (34,070 ft.) in 

11 holes (MEX 001 to 011 inclusive).  

 

From January 2007 to January 2008, DML completed 81 drill holes for a total of 

71,303 m (233,933 ft.).  This campaign included four wedge cuts from hole MEX-0075M 

and one wedge cut from hole MEX-0081M (both metallurgical sampling holes).  

 

From January 2008 to the end of April 2008, DML drilled 40 holes totalling 23,723 m 

(77,832 ft.), including 19 wedge holes for metallurgical samples.  MEX-0108, drilled in 

April 2008, was the last hole used in the previous resource estimate (Routledge, 2008). 

Note that the assay data for hole MEX-0106 was missing from the 2008 estimate but was 

added to the database for inclusion in the 2009 estimate. 

 

From April 2008 to March 2009 an additional 91 holes were drilled, including 43 

wedge cuts for metallurgical sampling. These holes, which total 48,014 m (157,527 ft.), 

have been used to update the geological wireframes and the Nokomis resource estimate 

of Routledge (2008). MEX-0109 is the first hole in this latest series. 

  

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

The Nokomis Property overlies rocks belonging to the Precambrian Superior 

Province.  Specifically, the deposit is located in the northern part of the Duluth Complex, 

a composite intrusion that occupies an area of approximately 6,500 km2.  This intrusion, 

which has a northeast-southwest orientation, extends for approximately 240 km from the 

Ontario border to the City of Duluth, and attains a width of up to 50 km on surface.   

 

The Duluth Complex consists of anorthositic, troctolitic, gabbroic to 

ferrogranodioritic, and granitic/granophyric rocks.  Footwall contacts on the west and 

north sides of the intrusion are sharp against metagreywackes and slates of the Middle 

Precambrian Virginia Formation, the Biwabik Iron Formation of the Mesabi Range, and 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 1-4 

the Early Precambrian monzonites of the Giants Range Batholith.  The contact and base 

of the complex dip shallowly to moderately southeast at -10˚ to -35˚.  

 

The Nokomis Property is underlain by the South Kawishiwi Intrusion (SKI), one of 

the 12 intrusions making up the Duluth Complex.  The Nokomis Deposit is hosted by an 

assemblage of ultramafic and mafic rocks, varieties of troctolites and gabbros. It is 

located at the base of the SKI where it parallels the footwall contact with Giants Range 

monzonites.  

 

As currently modelled, the Nokomis Deposit consists of a generally tabular-shaped 

zone of disseminated copper-nickel-iron sulphide mineralization.    Locally, the Nokomis 

mineralization straddles the SKI-Giants Range Batholith contact and higher-grade copper 

values may be concentrated near the hangingwall and footwall parts of the main body.  

The Nokomis mineralization dips from -35° to -25° toward the southeast and extends to 

vertical depths of more than 1,300 m (4,265 ft.). The Nokomis Deposit has a strike length 

of approximately 5.5 km and is open at depth and along strike.   

 

MINERAL RESOURCES  

Scott Wilson RPA has reviewed data for the Nokomis Deposit and has independently 

estimated Mineral Resources in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101 and the 

definitions set out by the CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves adopted by the CIM Council on December 11, 2005.  The resource estimate is 

based on diamond drilling and core sampling data and employs 3D computer block 

modelling with a combination of ordinary kriging for base metal interpolation and inverse 

distance squared (ID2) for platinum-group elements (PGE) and precious metal grade 

interpolation. The search strategy is constrained by wireframe models of the deposit 

constructed at a cut-off grade of 1.0% copper equivalent (CuEq).  The wireframes were 

constructed using the preliminary metallurgical recoveries and long term metal prices 

from the Scott Wilson RPA Preliminary Assessment study (January 2008). 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com

The Cu-Ni-PGE mineralization of the Nokomis deposit is, in part, the down-plunge 

extension of the Maturi Deposit. The latter is located on the northwest side of the DML 

property within the Franconia Federal Lease lands. To create the Nokomis deposit model 

the recent drilling and assay data from the Nokomis Property has been combined with 

similar data from historic holes located on and off the Nokomis Property. Some of the 

publicly available historic data has incomplete or missing values for Co, PGE, Au and Ag 

assays. Consequently, the missing grades for these elements were calculated using a 

linear regression equation using the recent, and more complete, MEX dataset. Details of 

the linear regression methodology can be found in Routledge (2008).   

 

Using the current and historic data, a geological wireframe has been created for an 

area that is larger than the current Nokomis Property. The wireframe is closest to the 

surface (within about 130 m or 427 ft.) in the northwestern part of the model and deeper 

on the southeastern side (about 1,300 m or 4,265 ft.). In order to constrain the resource 

estimate, the geological wireframe was clipped using the Nokomis Property boundary. 

The resource estimate is based entirely on diamond drilling and core sample assays. 

Copper equivalent (CuEq%) is based on Net Smelter Return Factors as determined for 

the Preliminary Assessment by Scott Wilson RPA dated January 18, 2008 and reflects 

expected metal prices and process recovery and refining charges.    

 

Table 1-1 presents the Indicated and Inferred Resources at a 1% CuEq cut-off and 

various copper cut-off grades.  Based on Scott Wilson RPA's review of metal prices, 

process recoveries, refining costs and future underground mine operating costs for the 

Nokomis Deposit, the 1.0% CuEq cut-off grade is reasonable for the statement of 

Indicated and Inferred Resources at this time. 

 

In addition to the six elements shown in Table 1-1, Scott Wilson RPA has also 

estimated the silver content of the Nokomis Deposit. Within the Indicated category, there 

are 37 million ounces of silver (550 million tonnes at 2.116 g/t Ag), while the Inferred 

category contains 18 million ounces (274 million tonnes at 2.056 g/t Ag). Silver is

reported separately because there is no information on silver recoveries and, 

consequently, it could not be included in the CuEq calculation.

MINERAL RESERVES 

No Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the Nokomis Property. 

 

ENVIRONMETAL STATUS 

In order to operate as an exploration and mining company in the State of Minnesota, 

DML must abide by all federal and state laws pertaining to exploration, development, 

extraction, processing, reclamation, material storage, handling and disposal, inter-state 

and intra-state transportation, international trade and treaty, labour and other laws, 

statutes and permits required for this industry and the particular location(s) in which it 

operates. On private lands held under lease, the agreement requires that all exploration 

and mining operations conducted on leased land be done in compliance with all laws, 

ordinances, regulations, rules, orders, permits and requirements now existing or hereafter 

enacted, adopted or made by federal, state and municipal authorities having jurisdiction 

over such exploration and mining operations. 

 

METALLURGY 

Initial metallurgical testing of a 252 kg composite sample of drill core was completed 

by SGS Lakefield Research in Lakefield, Ontario (SGS Lakefield) and reported by DML 

in a press release dated October 3, 2007.  These initial tests, using conventional 

floatation-concentration with recovery by the proprietary PLATSOL™ process, achieved 

recoveries of 94.9% for Cu, 71.8% for Ni, 83.9% for Pt, 85.4% for Pd and 61.3% for Au.  

Further metallurgical testing on drill core composites (using sample rejects) and solid 

core from dedicated metallurgical drill holes is underway at SGS Lakefield (DML press 

release dated January 15, 2008).  DML reports that this phase of metallurgical testing is 

still on-going (December 2009) and no results are available.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Scott Wilson RPA has independently estimated both Indicated and Inferred Mineral 

Resources for the Nokomis Deposit using 3D block modelling and grade interpolation by 

ordinary kriging and inverse distance squared.  The depth, tonnes and grade profile for 

this deposit indicate bulk underground mining should be the preferred method of 

exploitation.   

 

The Nokomis Deposit is located within DML's Nokomis Property within which the 

2007-2009 diamond drilling has been concentrated.  The Cu-Ni-Co-Au-PGE bearing 

mineralization extends up-dip (off the property) to the west and northwest and is more or 

less, continuous with the mineralization known as the Maturi Deposit.  

 

The wider-spaced drilling pattern from previous years was reduced by in-fill drilling 

in 2007, 2008 and 2009. As shown in this report, the closer-spaced drilling has created a 

larger Indicated Resource category for the Nokomis Deposit when compared to the 2007 

and 2008 estimates. In fact, the majority of the 2007-2009 drill holes are located within 

the Indicated Resource domain. The Nokomis Deposit remains open down-dip and along 

strike, where there is the potential for additional resources.  

 

The resource estimate is based entirely on diamond drilling and core assaying from 

both DML and previous explorers. Scott Wilson RPA has checked DML's drilling and 

assaying methodology and notes that it has been carried out to current industry standards.  

Scott Wilson RPA was unable to verify the methodology of the previous explorers but 

notes that the Indicated Resource (higher-confidence) is defined mostly by DML's recent 

MEX series holes which have verifiable data. The estimate does use some of the historic 

drill holes that are known to have less reliable down-hole surveys and generally lack 

cobalt, gold and PGE assays. In general, these historic holes are located within the 

Inferred Resources category.   

 

In order to use the pre-DML holes, the missing cobalt, gold and PGE grades were 

estimated as "calculated values" derived from a regression analysis of the more complete 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 1-9 

DML assays. This permits interpolation of grades into those resource blocks that extend 

across the north and west property boundaries. Because of the uncertainties attached to 

these historic holes the resource classification for these blocks is lower than that for 

blocks using the MEX series drilling data. Even with these minor uncertainties, Scott 

Wilson RPA's believes that the database is suitable for resource and reserve estimation. 

 

The resources on the Nokomis Property were reported by clipping the resource block 

model at the property boundary. Property boundaries follow the State Public Land 

System and, for the most part, are not evident on the ground, although a Township survey 

marker has been located.  Going forward with exploration and potential development, a 

boundary survey will be necessary.  Since the Nokomis Deposit is, in part, continuous 

down dip from the Maturi Deposit located on Franconia's land to the west and northwest, 

accurate positioning of the boundary is necessary to delineating resources on the 

respective properties.   

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

This Scott Wilson RPA Resource Estimate Update indicates that the Nokomis 

Deposit merits further work, much of which was recommended in the Preliminary 

Assessment.  Areas of concentration include: 

1. Upgrade drilling to benefit mine development planning, provide metallurgical 
samples, and provide samples for waste rock characterization.  

 
2. Continue with environmental baseline data collection, scoping, modelling, 

sampling, and inventory, and continue to focus on the requirements needed for 
permitting.  

 
3. Undertake rock quality and mine planning studies. 
 
4. Continue flotation and hydrometallurgical test work and conduct pilot plant 

operations to confirm recoveries, to allow the development of detailed process 
design criteria, and to demonstrate product purity samples. 

 
5. Tailings chemistry and disposal should be evaluated, including options for paste 

backfill.   
 
6. Initiate the Pre-Feasibility stage of assessment.

RECOMMENDED PROGRAM AND BUDGET 
DML has initiated all of the recommendations set out in the January 08, 2009 

Preliminary Assessment and these activities are at various stages of completion. For 

example, approximately 38 metric tonnes of metallurgical bulk sample has been collected 

using a large diameter PQ drill program and this core is currently securely stored at Ely, 

Minnesota in sealed drums purged with nitrogen.  

 

A recommended program and budget for the continuation of these activities through 

to the end of 2010 is shown in Table 1-2.

 2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF 
REFERENCE 
INTRODUCTION 

Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was asked by Duluth 

Metals Limited (DML) to update the previous resource estimate (Scott Wilson RPA, July 

2008) for the Nokomis Deposit, in Minnesota, U.S.A., and to prepare a Technical report 

complying with the requirements of National Instrument (NI) 43-101.  Scott Wilson 

RPA, and precursor firm Roscoe Postle Associates Inc., have prepared other NI 43-101 

Technical Reports on the Maturi Extension Properties (the former name of the Nokomis 

Property) for Wallbridge Mining Company Limited (WM) dated December 30, 2005 

(Cargill, 2005a), and for DML dated May 31, 2006, August 8, 2007, January 8, 2008, 

July 18, 2008 and January, 2009.   

 

The Nokomis Property is located approximately 22 kilometres southeast of the town 

of Ely, in northern Minnesota, U.S.A.  The property hosts a large zone of copper-nickel-

PGE mineralization known as the Nokomis Deposit. This deposit is located near the base 

of the Duluth Complex at depths varying from 130 m to more than 1,300 m (425 ft. to 

4,270 ft.) below surface. Exploration drilling of the Nokomis Deposit is at an advanced 

stage, with 155 diamond drill holes (and numerous wedge cuts) having been completed 

by DML between 2006 and mid-March 2009. An initial resource estimate was prepared 

for DML by Scott Wilson RPA in June 2007 followed by a Preliminary Assessment  in 

January 2008.  A further resource estimate was prepared by Scott Wilson RPA in July 

2008 and this was followed by another PEA in January, 2009. Drilling, including large 

diameter core for collection of a bulk sample, metallurgical test work and environmental 

baseline studies, is ongoing.  Results of these work programs will be used to provide 

inputs into a Pre-feasibility Study.  

 

A new geological wireframe has been created for the Nokomis deposit using a 1% 

CuEq cut-off grade. The CuEq formula was defined in a previous Preliminary

 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND 
LOCATION 

State leases and federal permits for the Nokomis Property are registered to Duluth 

Metals Corp. (DMC), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of DML. 

DML is a corporation registered in Ontario, Canada that is listed on the Toronto Stock 

Exchange. DMC retains leased private mineral rights and owns 480 acres (194 ha) of 

private surface rights overlying leased mineral rights within the property.  DML and 

DMC are both authorized to carry on business in Minnesota.   

 

The Nokomis Property is located in northern Minnesota, Lake County, Townships 

61N and 62N, Range 11W in the U.S.G.S. Kangas Bay and Bogberry Lake 7.5 Minute 

quadrangles (Figures 4-1, 4-2 and 4-3).  The properties are centred approximately at: 

 

• North latitude 47° 47' 0"; west longitude 91° 42' 30" 
• UTM coordinates Zone 15, 595,500E, 5,295,300N (NAD 83 CONUS) 
• UTM coordinates Zone 15, 595,516E, 5,295,082N (NAD 27 CONUS).  
 

LAND DESCRIPTION AND DULUTH METALS HOLDINGS 
Land in Minnesota is held by a combination of private leases, State leases, and federal 

permits, and this land is subject to typical United States split-estate holdings, where the 

surface owner(s) may be different from the subsurface owner(s).  Various rights are also 

subject to United States split-estate rules so that, for example, the mineral rights owner 

may be different from the hydrocarbon rights owner.  According to U.S. law, in split-

estate situations, mineral rights are considered to be the dominant estate and take 

precedence over other rights associated with the property, including those associated with 

surface ownership.  However, the mineral owner must show due regard for the interests 

of the surface estate owner and occupy only those portions of the surface that are 

reasonably necessary to develop the mineral estate.

DML, through its U.S. subsidiary DMC, now holds seven State of Minnesota non-

ferrous mineral leases, two federal prospecting permits and four private leases covering 

11 contiguous parcels of lands containing the Nokomis Deposit.  These combined 

properties are referred to as the Nokomis Property.  The total Nokomis land package held 

by DMC covers 3,001 acres (1,215 ha) as measured by its mineral rights holdings (Figure 

4-3).  The lands are located in the Superior National Forest area, but some of the surface 

and subsurface rights are held by either the State of Minnesota or by private landowners.  

Each lease or permit is subject to rules which may differ between jurisdictions.   

 

Additional state and private lands outside the Nokomis Property have been leased or 

optioned and added to DMC's holdings. These additional lands either lie within the 

Duluth Complex and are prospective for further discoveries of economic mineral deposits 

and/or are considered to be strategic for the development of the Nokomis Deposit. 

DMC's total holdings now stand at approximately 18,500 acres (7,487 ha) of mineral 

rights and 14,000 acres (5,666 ha) of surface rights. 

 

U.S. National Forests are protected forests and woodland areas in the United States.  

National Forests are controlled by the federal government and managed by the United 

States Forest Service, under the direction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  

Commercial use of National Forests is permitted and in many cases encouraged.  The 

management of these lands focuses on timber harvesting, livestock grazing, mining, oil 

and gas extraction, water, wildlife management and recreation. The U.S. Bureau of Land 

Management, a division of the U.S. Department of Interior, has management 

responsibility for federal minerals beneath the National Forests.

 The Superior National Forest, which encompasses more than 3 million acres (1.21 

million ha) of land in northeast Minnesota, was established in 1909 by President 

Theodore Roosevelt.  The Nokomis Property is completely enclosed within the forest 

boundaries.  The Superior National Forest is open to commercial development, including 

mining. DMC's private and state holdings fall under Minnesota State rules even though 

they lie within the National Forest. 

 

The state leases are issued by the State of Minnesota, Department of Natural 

Resources, and the federal prospecting permits are issued by the U.S. Bureau of Land 

Management.  The seven state leases cover an area of 1,120 acres (530 ha) and the two 

federal prospecting permits cover an area of 1,044.3 acres (423 ha).  Four private mineral 

leases cover an additional 836 acres (338 ha) and are held pursuant to agreements with: 

 

• RGGS Land & Minerals, Ltd. (RGGS) dated as of January 1, 2006  

• St. Croix Lumber originally dated December 15, 2006 

• Maki group dated March 17, 2007 

• Fosters dated February 12, 2008 
 

All of these private interests are unrelated to and wholly at arm's length from DMC. 

 
STATE LEASES 

State leases to explore for, mine and remove metallic minerals are held for a period of 

50 years; DMC was granted its leases during 2000, 2007 and in 2008.  These leases are 

subject to an incremental rental fee of $1.50 per acre for the initial three years, increasing 

to $5.00 per acre for the next three years, $15.00 per acre for the next five years, and 

finally $30.00 per acre for each remaining year.  DMC is currently paying $15.00 per 

acre per year.  Rights conveyed in these leases exclude the extraction of iron ore, taconite 

ores, coal, oil, gas and other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons, which would be covered 

under separate state leases. The timing of the payments and increments are adjusted to the 

date of issuance. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 4-7 

In Minnesota, an operating mining company pays a production royalty in addition to 

lease payments and income taxes.  The base royalty rate is 3.95% of the Net Return 

Value. In the case of two leases, an additional bonus rate of 0.50% is applied.  This 

royalty is paid by the lessee to the State of Minnesota for metallic minerals and 

associated mineral products recovered from the state-leased premises.  The base rate is 

escalated for such recovered metallic products that have a Net Return Value greater than 

$75.00 per Ton of Dried Crude Ore. The latter is indexed to the unadjusted Producer 

Price Index for All Commodities (1982 = 100.0), as published by the Bureau of Labour 

Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labour, tied to the index for November 1994 

(the "Base Index" which equalled 121.5), and is to be calculated for the first month in the 

calendar quarter in which the royalty payment will be made.  By way of example, based 

on the above formula, the escalated base rate of $75.00 per Ton of Dried Crude Ore 

would equal $115.35 per Ton of Dried Crude Ore as of October 2009 (based on recent 

published BLS statistics).  The rate rises to the maximum 20% if such Net Return Value 

exceeds $444.01 per Ton of Dried Crude Ore (indexed as stated above to $681.56 as of 

October 2009).    

 
FEDERAL PROSPECTING PERMITS 

DMC's federal prospecting permits were issued in December 2001.  They have been 

held for their initial period of two years and have been extended for a subsequent four 

years.  Per the standard property advancement procedures for federal prospecting permits, 

DMC will convert its federal prospecting permits to a preference rights lease in order to 

retain and further explore and develop the properties.   In the case of these and other 

federal prospecting permits in the Superior National Forest, deadlines for making 

applications for lease have been extended by the BLM. The earliest due date is now May 

2011. According to federal regulations, in order to obtain a preference rights lease, the 

applicant must hold a federal prospecting permit for the area it wants to lease, apply for a 

preference rights lease, submit the first year annual lease payment, provide information 

required as stated in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 3507.17, including 

maps, a proposed mining and processing approach, a description of saleable products and 

markets, utilities and infrastructure in the area, and the applicant must demonstrate that it 

has discovered a valuable deposit covered by its prospecting permit.  A valuable deposit 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 4-8 

is principally defined by the geologic assessment of the mineral deposit, detailing the 

type and extent of exploration, including results, that has taken place on the lands covered 

by the federal prospecting permit, as well as the exploration on adjacent non-federal lands 

that are part of any future resource and/or reserve estimation. Valuable mineral deposit 

lands may include lands covered by the federal prospecting permit as well as adjacent 

non-federal lands that may be required for the development and operation of any 

potential future operations associated with minerals found on the federal prospecting 

permit, such as mill and processing sites. 

 

DMC will be submitting its application for a preference rights lease on its federal 

prospecting permits in accordance with federal regulations and specific application dates.  

The preference rights lease applications are currently due in May 2011. 

 
PRIVATE LEASED LANDS 

DMC currently has leases from RGGS covering fourteen 40 acre (16 ha) parcels, 

situated in Lake County, Minnesota, which comprise the Private RGGS Leased Lands.  

These leases are leased in an "as is" condition to DMC for the purposes of exploring, 

prospecting, drilling and test-pitting the properties. The leases grant DMC the sole and 

exclusive right to mine and extract and to carry on mining, milling and refining 

operations with respect to all mineral substances of a metalliferous nature.  The RGGS 

Leases provide for a production royalty of 5% of the Net Return Values on products 

recovered in the mill concentrate obtained from the Private Leased Lands, less certain 

additional allowable charges. 

 

On December 15, 2006 DMC leased mineral rights from St. Croix Lumber (St. 

Croix). In July 2007, the agreement was amended to include additional lands which 

increased the total number of acres to 229 acres (93 ha). This lease gives DMC 50% of 

the mineral rights on the 229 acres (93 ha). The complementary mineral rights have been 

leased from the State of Minnesota. Royalty payments are proportional to the percentage 

of the interest owned. After the commencement of commercial production, a royalty 

payment of 3% of the Net Return Value is due.  

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 4-9 

Two other private mineral leases were acquired in 2007 and 2008 from the Maki 

group and the Fosters. Together, these two leases cover 160 acres (65 ha). These leases 

are for partial interests of the same mineral land. Royalty payments are proportional to 

the percentage of the interest owned. After the commencement of commercial 

production, a royalty payment of 3% of the Net Return Value is due. 

 

Surface rights totalling 440 acres (178 ha) over existing DMC mineral leases were 

purchased in March 2008. This provides DMC with private surface rights for exploration 

operations and possible future development infrastructure. These surface rights overlie 

160 acres (65 ha) of the St. Croix / State leases and all but 40 acres (16 ha) of the RGGS 

mineral rights lease in section 35.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS 

In the vicinity of the Nokomis Property, DMC has acquired additional mineral and 

surface rights in the form of leases, options and/or purchased lands (Figure 4-4).   

 

In February 2008, DMC secured an option for surface rights on 1,845 acres (747 ha); 

this is known as the Dunka Property. This option provides DMC with a potential surface 

tailings impoundment area as well as a location for future plant facilities. In April 2008, 

DMC acquired an additional 29 State leases covering 8,842 acres (3578 ha) to the south 

of the Nokomis Deposit. This property is now referred to as the Land O' Dixie.  Some of 

these mineral leases are for less than 100%.  

 

In May 2008, DMC acquired an option to purchase 1,320 acres (534 ha) of surface 

rights in proximity to the Nokomis Deposit. This land package is referred to as the 

Northland Properties. In July 2008, DMC leased 2,614 acres (1058 ha) of private mineral 

rights on lands largely contiguous to the State of Minnesota leases secured in April 2008 

(as documented in the previous paragraph). These private mineral lands have been 

combined with the state leases and are now included with the Land O' Dixie Property. In

March 2009 DMC leased an additional 816 acres (330 ha) of State lands which have also 

been incorporated into the Land O' Dixie Property.  

 

DMC acquired additional lands from the State in March of 2009. These new leases 

make up four other projects referred to as Rook, Hoyt, Lands End, and Cascade. They 

total 5,915 acres (2394 ha). A small portion of the mineral leases are for less than 100% 

of the mineral rights.

 6 HISTORY 
Exploration for iron deposits in the vicinity of the Nokomis Property has been on-

going since the late-1800s. Since the 1950s, exploration has focused on the copper and 

nickel deposits of the Duluth Complex and related footwall metasedimentary and granitic 

rocks. Drilling for copper and nickel has been carried out by many major mining 

companies including Inco, Duval, Kennecott, Newmont and US Steel.  In 1985, the 

Minnesota Department of Natural Resources re-analyzed core from the early copper-

nickel exploration drill holes and found significant PGEs.  This has prompted the re-

evaluation of a number of known deposits in the western portion of the Duluth Complex.  

 

In 1999, Wallbridge Mining (the predecessor company to DML) explored two smaller 

areas known as the Maturi Property and the Spruce Road Property. These two properties 

are peripheral to the current Nokomis Property, and the Spruce Road Property is now 

held by Franconia Minerals Corporation (Franconia).  WM began acquiring lands that 

now comprise the Nokomis Property in 1999 and 2000. In late 2005, WM spun-out its 

Minnesota properties into DML. 

 

From March 14, 2006, to January 08, 2007, DML diamond drilled 10,384.5 m 

(34,070 ft.) in 11 holes (MEX 001 to 011 inclusive). In part, the program was based on 

recommendations from Cargill (2005a).  Some of the planned holes had to be relocated 

due to access issues relating to the unseasonably warm winter of 2005/2006.  Exploration 

on the property to mid-May 2006 was reported by Routledge (2006). 

 

From January 2007 to January 2008, DML completed 81 drill holes for a total of 

71,303 m (233,933 ft.).  This campaign included four wedge cuts from hole MEX-0075M 

and one wedge cut from hole MEX-0081M (both metallurgical sampling holes).   

 

From January 2008 to the end of April 2008, DML drilled 40 holes totalling 23,723 m 

(77,832 ft.), including 19 wedge holes for metallurgical samples.  MEX-0108, drilled in 

April 2008, was the cut-off hole for the previous resource estimate (Routledge, 2008). 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 6-2 

Note that the assay data for hole MEX-0106 was missing from the 2008 estimate but was 

added to the database for inclusion in the 2009 estimate. 

 

From April 2008 to March 2009 an additional 91 holes were drilled, including 43 

wedge cuts for metallurgical sampling. These holes, which total 48,014 m (157,527 ft.), 

have been used to update the geological wireframe and the Nokomis resource estimate of 

Routledge (2008). MEX-0109 is the first hole in this latest series.

Properties.  The reports are available on SEDAR.

 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
The Nokomis Property contains rocks from the Precambrian Superior Province.  

Specifically, the deposit is located in the northern part of the Duluth Complex, a 

composite intrusion that occupies an area of approximately 6,500 km2.  This intrusion, 

which has a northeast-southwest orientation, extends for approximately 240 km from the 

Ontario border to the City of Duluth and attains a width of up to 50 km on surface.   

 

The Duluth Complex consists of varieties of anorthositic, troctolitic, gabbroic, ferro-

granodioritic, and granitic/granophyric rocks.  Footwall contacts on the west and north 

sides of the Duluth Complex are sharp against metagreywackes and slates of the Middle 

Precambrian Virginia and Rove Formations, the Biwabik Iron Formation of the Mesabi 

Range, Neoarchean metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Vermilion 

greenstone belt, and granitoids of the Giants Range batholith.  The contact and base of 

the complex dip shallowly to moderately southeast at -10˚ to -35˚.  

 

The Nokomis Property is underlain by the South Kawishiwi Intrusion (SKI), one of 

the 12 intrusions making up the Duluth Complex.  The Nokomis Deposit is hosted by 

ultramafic and mafic rocks, and varieties of troctolites and gabbros. It is located at the 

base of the SKI where it parallels the footwall contact with monzonites of the Giants 

Range batholith.  

 

As currently modelled, the Nokomis Deposit consists of a generally tabular-shaped 

zone of disseminated copper-nickel-iron sulphide mineralization.  Locally, the Nokomis 

mineralization straddles the SKI-Giants Range batholith contact and higher-grade copper 

values may be concentrated near the hangingwall and footwall parts of the main body.  

The Nokomis mineralization dips from -35° to -25° toward the southeast and extends to 

vertical depths of more than 1,300 m (4,265 ft.). The main mineralization has a strike 

length of approximately 5.5 km and is open at depth and along strike.

 9 MINERALIZATION 
The reader is referred to Scott Wilson RPA's August 8, 2007 and January 8, 2008 

reports on the Maturi Extension Properties for details.  The reports are available on 

SEDAR.   

 

In addition to the types of mineralization described in earlier Scott Wilson RPA 

reports, DML has identified granite-hosted copper-nickel and PGE mineralization within 

the 2.7 billion year old Giants Range batholith. The latter is a regionally extensive unit of 

granitoid rocks in the footwall of the Duluth Complex.  This granite-hosted 

mineralization occurs beneath the interpreted SKI magma channel within the Nokomis 

deposit. Although it is superficially similar to the known hangingwall mineralization, it 

varies in character, mineralogy, and tenor at depth.   Typically, granite-hosted 

mineralization is dominated by nickel/cobalt-rich pyrrhotite within irregular semi-

massive sulphide veins at or below the troctolite contact. This mineralization changes 

with depth to disseminated chalcopyrite-bornite-millerite mineralization enriched in Cu 

and PGEs. 

 

The mineralization is hosted within the contact thermal aureole to the Duluth 

Complex and is interpreted to be directly derived from the Duluth Complex.  Footwall 

style mineralization is encountered in approximately one-quarter of the holes that have 

been drilled to date, with about eighty percent of these holes containing mineralization in 

the hangingwall which continues directly into the footwall with little or no breaks.   

 

The sulphide mineral assemblage in the footwall is dominated by chalcopyrite and 

bornite.  Pentlandite is the principal nickel-bearing mineral, although trace amounts of 

nickel also occur in pyrrhotite. Chalcopyrite, cubanite, talnakhite and bornite are the 

principal copper-bearing minerals.  The footwall mineralization is known to extend 

locally at least 61 m (200 ft.) into the footwall and is an important exploration target.

 10 EXPLORATION 
Prior to 2006, the DML exploration programs on the Nokomis Property (known as the 

Maturi Extension Properties at that time) consisted of re-logging, quartering and re-

assaying of drill core (or assaying grab samples of already quartered core) from six Duval 

drill holes. In addition, one Newmont hole (NM-03) drilled on an adjacent property was 

sampled.  A 3D computer model of the geology of the properties was created (Peterson, 

2001a) and the exploration potential was assessed on the basis of the new model (Cargill, 

2005a).  From 2006 to June 2007, DML diamond drilled 45 holes on the properties 

totalling 36,747.44 m (120,562.5 ft.).  Downhole electromagnetic geophysical surveys 

were performed on several drill holes.  Core composites were also submitted to SGS 

Lakefield Research in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada (SGS Lakefield), for flotation and 

hydrometallurgical recovery tests.   

 

Drilling continued on the properties over the fall and winter of 2007-2008, with five 

rigs on site.  This program consisted of in-fill drilling, using NQ and PQ size drill core, 

and step-out drilling using NQ drill core on the existing Nokomis Resources Block. In 

addition, NQ size exploration holes were drilled to help define new mineralization in the 

Eastern Exploration Area.  During this campaign, DML drilled holes MEX-46 to MEX-

108 totalling 83,886.46 m (275,218.05 ft.), including 21 wedge holes for 17,674.07 m 

(57,985.80 ft.) on the Nokomis Deposit.  This brought the DML drilling to 108 holes 

totalling 120,633.9 m (395,780.51 ft.).  After this drilling, a second metallurgical sample 

was submitted to SGS Lakefield for testing.  The sample was approximately 1,100 kg and 

consisted of NQ core rejects from 12 of these drill holes within the various geographic, 

mineralogic and grade spectra of the Nokomis Deposit.  Testing is currently underway on 

this sample; no results are available at this time (December 2009). 

 

From April 2008 to March 2009 an additional 90 holes were drilled, including 41 

wedge cuts for metallurgical sampling. These holes, which total 74,240.37 m (243,570.77 

ft.), have been used to update the geological wireframe and the Nokomis resource 

estimate of Routledge (2008). MEX-0109 is the first hole in this latest series.

Note that the number of metres/feet described above includes the parent hole portion 

of wedge holes (that is, from the surface collar). The actual cored metres/feet of the 

wedged holes begins at the kick-off point in the parent hole which is less than the number 

quoted here. 

 

In the field, the casings for these drill holes have not been removed which will allow 

for later down-hole geophysical surveying. Each hole has been capped with a painted 

casing extension. None of the holes has been prepared for permanent abandonment (as 

per Minnesota State law). The authors observed a number of these casings during the 

various site visits.

 11 DRILLING 
DML DRILLING AND DRILL HOLE DATABASE 

The 2006 to 2008 DML drilling campaigns have been documented in Routledge 

(2008). The reader is referred to this report (filed on SEDAR) for further information.  

 

The current resource estimate uses 360 drill holes including 66 related wedge cuts (63 

by DML and 3 by other companies). The total meters drilled is 247,337 (811,474 ft.) of 

which 50,331 m (165,128 ft.) was drilled as wedge cuts. The database includes 141 holes 

drilled by companies other than DML (which amounts to 52,463 m; 172,123 ft.). These 

holes were included to assist with the wireframe modelling of the Nokomis Deposit on its 

up–dip side (where it joins the Maturi Deposit) and to aid in the interpolation of grades 

near the margins of the property. 

 

Note that the number of metres/feet described above includes the parent hole portion 

of wedge holes (that is, from the surface collar). The actual cored metres/feet of the 

wedged holes begins at the kick-off point in the parent hole which is less than the number 

quoted here. 

 

Figure 11-1 shows the location of the drill holes used in the current resource estimate.

DRILL HOLE SURVEYS 
HISTORIC 

Inco holes were surveyed at the collar with only acid dip tests taken down hole.  As a 

result, the position of the toe and mineralized intervals is somewhat uncertain because of 

the lack of azimuth deviation data.  Dip tests were taken at intervals ranging from 15 m 

(50 ft.) to 61 m (200 ft.).  Inco collar surveys were originally in Inco's New Minnesota 

grid system and were converted by WM to UTM NAD27 coordinates which required a 

20.42 m (67 ft.) shift west and 42.0 m (138 ft.) south and a grid origin correction to 

539,980.4E, 5,199,956.8N.  Scott Wilson RPA converted the coordinates to NAD 83 for 

use in the Nokomis resource estimation database. 

 

The Duval, Newmont, Kennecott and US Steel drill holes were all vertical with no 

down-hole azimuth deviation recorded.  The US Steel holes have dip tests and, of the 

others, only DU-03 and NM-03 have acid dip tests.  The other historic holes have no 

down-hole surveys.  

 

Collars of most historic drill holes were relocated in the field, using GPS, by the 

Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI), University of Minnesota at Duluth.  

Additional historic drill holes have been relocated in the field, using GPS and metal 

detectors, by DMC. 

 
DMC 

DMC hole collars are field-spotted using a hand-held GPS unit and recorded in local 

UTM coordinates.  In 2007, all of the historic drill collars (up to and including MEX-

104) were surveyed by NL Surveying using a differential GPS. This practice was 

continued for the later series of holes (MEX-105 to MEX-155) using a Trimble GPS 

system. The precision for the collar locations is within a few centimetres. 

 

Down-hole deviation surveys were documented by two different tools produced by 

FLEXIT AB, based in Sweden. Holes MEX-11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24 and 26 used a 

FLEXIT MultiSmart tool while the remaining holes were surveyed using a FLEXIT Gyro 

tool. Readings were generally taken at ±6.1 m (20 ft.) intervals and coincided with 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 11-4 

running the survey as the rods were pulled in 20 ft. lengths at the end of drilling the hole.  

The FLEXIT MultiSmart tool is a magnetic field-based instrument that measures azimuth 

and dip of the hole.  The tool also records errors based on the fluctuation in magnetic 

field strength which allows for a degree of internal correction by the tool itself. It also 

allows the technician/geologist to review and perform manual adjustments or review 

spurious readings as appropriate.  Spurious readings in the Duluth Complex rocks may be 

caused by variable magnetite contents. 

 

Previous reviews of the down-hole survey data by Scott Wilson RPA (for holes up to 

MEX-108) showed that the FLEXIT MultiSmart dip readings were generally acceptable 

but the azimuth readings were noisy. Adjustments were made by DMC to the azimuth 

portion of the affected holes (9 holes).  The use of the FLEXIT Gyro tool for the majority 

of the MEX-series holes eliminated the need for corrections due to magnetic field noise.  

For the last series of holes (MEX-109 to MEX-155) only minor corrections were made to 

the down hole survey dataset. Scott Wilson RPA notes that some holes (e.g. MEX-0139) 

have no survey information because the rods were stuck in the hole and could not be 

surveyed.  These holes plot as vertical traces in Gemcom. 

 

ASSAY DATABASE 
The assay database contains 360 drill holes with 21,716 intervals.  Of these, 21,007 

are assayed intervals (Cu and/or Ni) totalling 38,385.40 m (125,936 ft.).  Co was not 

assayed in 6,039 of the entries. Similarly, 6,003 samples have no Au values in the 

database while 6,077 samples have no Pt values and 5,969 samples have no Pd values. 

 

The MEX series of holes drilled by DML have 15,503 assays over an aggregate 

interval of 25,423.53 m (83,411 ft.). Table 11-1 summarises the zero values within the 

MEX portion of the database. None of the zero values are from samples used to update 

the last resource estimate (that is, they are complete for Cu, Ni, Au, Pt, Pd and Ag).

Within the Nokomis Deposit mineralized envelope, as described in Item 17, the drill 

holes contain 8,748 assays from 14,536 m (47,690 ft.) of core.  For Cu, 28 of these 

samples have no values while Ni has 29 entries with no values. In both cases, the zero 

values are from either historic holes (not DMC) or from metallurgical hole MEX-091M-

W3. For Co, there are 1523 samples with zero values while Au has 1524 samples with 

zero values.  In both cases, the values used for the interpolation were estimated from a 

regression analysis (documented in Routledge, 2008) so that the database was complete. 

For Pt, there are 1524 zero values while Pd has 1522 zero values. As with Co and Au, the 

missing Pt and Pd values were estimated from a regression analysis.

 12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
The sampling method and approach for drill holes pre-dating MEX-109 are described 

in Routledge (2008). For the recent drill holes (MEX-109 to MEX-155) DML followed 

the same methods and procedures used for the initial 108 MEX holes. Inspections of the 

logging facility and core storage areas were made during the recent site visit to Ely 

(Figure 12-1).  No issues were found for the core logging and storage areas. 

 

Sample lengths for holes within the resource model range from 0.12 m (0.4 ft.) up to 

13.9 m (45.6 ft) although there is one anomalous sample length of 30.48 m (100 ft.) for 

hole 34883 (pre-DML hole).  Figure 12-1 shows the sample lengths distribution.

 13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES 
AND SECURITY 

For sample preparation and analysis pre-dating hole MEX-109 the reader is referred 

to Routledge (2008).  Note that DML continued with the same laboratory for analysis of 

samples from the 2008-2009 drilling program.  

 

Core samples were crushed, mass reduced and milled to pulps at ALS Chemex's 

preparation facility in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. The pulps were then shipped to the 

ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver, Canada for analysis. ALS Chemex is an 

independent, commercial mineral laboratory that is ISO 9002 certified and is accredited 

under ISO/IEC 25 guidelines.   

 

The sample preparation and analytical procedures used are as follows: 

 
• Core samples numbers are entered into the Laboratory Information Management 

System (LIMS). This system employs bar coding and scanning technology for 
chain of custody reporting as samples are tracked from sample preparation 
through analysis and computer-generated certificate reporting. 

 
• If necessary, samples are oven-dried. Each sample is then jaw crushed to a point 

where more than 75% of the material is less than 2 mm (equivalent to 10 mesh). 
 

• A 250 g cut is taken by riffle splitting with the balance stored as coarse rejects.  
 

• The 250g cut is pulverized in a ring and puck grinding mill to a point where more 
than 85% of the samples is smaller than 75 μm (equivalent to 200 mesh). This 
sub-sample is then carefully homogenized.   
 

• Barren material is used to clean the mill between sample batches to minimize 
contamination. 

 
• For precious metal analysis, a one assay ton (±30 g) aliquot of the pulp is fire 

assay fused (FA) for one hour at 1,050ºC and then subjected to a four-acid 
digestion using a HF-HNO3-HClO4-HCl leach. This solution is analyzed for Pt, 
Pd and Au using inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometry (FA-
ICP-AES: ALS Chemex, method PGM-ICP23).   
 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 13-2 

Detection limits for method PGM-ICP23 are:  
Metal Method Detection limit 

Pd FA-ICP-AES 0.001 ppm 
Pt FA-ICP-AES 0.005 ppm 
Au FA-ICP-AES 0.001 ppm 

 
• Copper, nickel, cobalt, silver and 29 other elements are analysed using method 

ME-ICP61. For this analysis, a 0.5 g portion of the pulp is digested using a HF-
HNO3-HClO4-HCl leach with subsequent analysis by ICP-AES. 

 
Detection limits for method ME-ICP61 are: 

Metal Method Detection limit 
Ag FA-ICP-AES 0.5  ppm 
Cu FA-ICP-AES 1.0  ppm 
Ni FA-ICP-AES 1.0  ppm 
Co FA-ICP-AES 1.0  ppm 

 

If copper and nickel exceeded 10,000 ppm (1%) using method ME-ICP61, a pulp-

split was re-assayed by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) using methods Cu-OG62 

and Ni-OG62.  

 

Detection limits for method OG62 are: 
Metal Method Detection limit 

Cu OG62 0.01% 
Ni OG62 0.01% 

 

 Scott Wilson RPA again notes that these analytical methods entail total digestion of 

the samples. Consequently, the reported Ni values represent a combination of Ni from 

silicates and Ni from sulphides. The Ni in silicate minerals is generally not recoverable 

by conventional processing. Scott Wilson RPA recommends selective digestions of some 

of these samples to assess the Ni contribution from these two sources. 

 

DML used a formal Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) and security 

program for their 2008-2009 drilling campaigns. Company blanks and reference 

standards were included in the sample stream for each drill hole.  In addition, core for 

two sample intervals in each hole were quartered as duplicates and both sets of quartered 

core were submitted for analysis.  The average of the duplicates is entered in the resource 

estimation drill hole database.  The earliest blank samples were prepared from crushed 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 13-3 

cinder block but this was replaced by Dresser Trap rock (a volcanic rock) for the majority 

of the analytical program. Reference standards WMG-1 or WPR-1 were obtained from 

CANMET.  ALS Chemex carries out its own internal QA/QC for analyses.  As a security 

measure, and to assure the nature of control samples was "blind" to the laboratory, all 

QA/QC samples were labelled with numbers independent of hole information and sample 

type and were in sequence with core samples.    

 

All core was directly retrieved from the drill by DML staff on a daily to twice daily 

basis and logged at a secure company facility in Ely, Minnesota. Samples in plastic bags, 

and accumulated in rice bags, were transported by truck by a chartered and bonded 

independent carrier to the ALS Chemex laboratory in Thunder Bay, Ontario.  Samples 

were recorded, prepared (as described above) and shipped to the ALS Chemex laboratory 

in Vancouver, British Columbia, for assaying and analysis.

 14 DATA VERIFICATION 
The Nokomis Deposit is not exposed at surface within the DML property. 

Consequently, check-sampling of the mineralization can only be performed using 

diamond drill core stored at either the company site in Ely, MN or at the Minnesota State 

Core library in Hibbing, MN.   

 

The historic drill core from previous explorers on the property is held at the 

Minnesota State Core library in Hibbing, MN.  This same facility houses some core from 

the early DML holes although the majority of the MEX series of holes are located at 

DML's facility at Ely, MN.  The Minnesota DNR, Minnesota Geological Survey (MGS), 

University of Minnesota (UMN), and the Natural Resource Research Institute (NRRI), 

have all analyzed drill core samples from the Nokomis Property to positively verify the 

types and amounts of mineralization present within the deposit. The extensive re-assaying 

of the core has meant that only a limited amount of sample material is available for 

check-assaying (Routledge, 2008).  Consequently, Scott Wilson RPA did not conduct 

independent sampling of the recent Nokomis Deposit drill core. Instead, Scott Wilson 

RPA has visually estimated the copper grades of the core and the predicted values agree 

well with the actual assays.   

 

When re-sampling the old core, WM relied on the blanks, duplicates, and standards 

inserted into the sample stream by Swastika Laboratories for its data verification (Cargill, 

2005a). For DML's 2006-2007 drilling, DML personnel routinely compared visual 

estimates from core logging, and digital photos when necessary, with analytical results 

from ALS Chemex to ensure that results were as expected.  QA/QC samples, including 

quarter-core duplicates, blanks, and reference standards, were also inserted into the 

sample stream with each batch of samples.  Results were reviewed to assure that there has 

been no contamination and that analytical accuracy was maintained.  If a problem was 

identified, the assays for the hole were re-done.  The approach used by DML for their 

2006-2007 samples was also used for the recent drill holes (MEX-109 and higher).

Scott Wilson RPA spot-checked a number of ALS Chemex certificates against 

database records and found no entry errors (a couple of minor errors were detected for 

SG values in the database and these were removed). In addition, any negative values for 

the metals in the database were re-set to half the appropriate detection limit.  

 

While on site, Scott Wilson RPA confirmed the location of the casings of a selection 

of drill holes using a hand held global positioning system instrument (Garmin Etrex), 

accurate to ±6 m (±20 ft.).  Core logging and sampling records were also examined for 

several drill holes and the checks confirmed that the DML work conforms to industry 

standard practices.  

 

QA/QC 
Scott Wilson RPA reviewed the complete QA/QC dataset for the MEX series holes 

(which also includes the QA/QC data already reviewed by Routledge, 2008). The QA/QC 

data comes from the blanks, quarter-core duplicates and reference standards inserted into 

the sample stream.  

 

In general, the field blank samples returned low values for the six elements of interest 

(Cu, Ni, Co, Au, Pt, Pd) which suggests that the preparation stage was contamination-

free. Only one Trap rock blank out of 345 samples (number 153336) returned anomalous 

values for all 6 elements (Figure 14-1). Although the affected batch was re-run the 

contamination still persisted suggesting that the blank sample is not completely free of 

base and precious metals. Scott Wilson RPA recommends that DML investigate the use 

of some other material for use as a blank.  

 

Scott Wilson RPA reviewed the laboratory values returned for the Canmet WMG-1 

reference standard within each sample batch for the MEX holes. The values for Cu, Ni, 

Co, Au, Pt and Pd were compared with the certified or provisional mean and standard 

deviations of this reference standard. This assessment is designed to test for bias (Figure 

14-1).  Overall, the majority of the values for each element fall within +/- 3 standard 

deviations of the certified mean. However, some of the values returned for Cu, Au, Pt and 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 14-3 

Pd clearly lie outside the specification limits. In most instances, these biased values have 

no clear pattern although the final batches (around fifty) consistently display erratic 

values. To rectify the issue, DML replaced standard WMG-1 with standard WPR-1 and 

the affected batches were re-run with cross-checks at different laboratories. The updated 

values were entered into the database for use in the current resource estimate.

Table 14-1 compares the averages for the dataset with the averages for the standard 

on a metal by metal basis. Overall, there are no significant issues when comparing the 

averages. 

 

DML has not submitted any samples to an alternative accredited laboratory for check 

assaying and further confirmation of the accuracy of the assays.  Scott Wilson RPA 

recommends that selected ALS Chemex pulp splits, for various grades from low to high, 

be submitted to an outside laboratory for check analysis. This is standard industry 

practice.  

 

In Scott Wilson RPA's opinion, the drill hole and assay database is adequate for 

resource and reserve estimation.

 15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
Properties of interest in the vicinity of the Nokomis Property with historic or NI 43-

101 compliant resources in the public domain include: Birch Lake, Maturi and Spruce 

Road held by Franconia; Mesaba (formerly the Babbitt Deposit) held by Teck Cominco 

American Inc.; and NorthMet (formerly the Dunka Road Deposit) held by PolyMet 

Mining Corporation (PolyMet).  Franconia drilled multiple holes on the Birch Lake 

Deposit in 2005 and completed a Preliminary Assessment in January 2006.  Franconia 

completed a NI 43-101 Preliminary Assessment Technical Report on the Maturi and 

Birch Lake Properties in October 2006.  Franconia also carried out a drilling program at 

Birch Lake in 2007-2008 and recently updated its resource estimate for the Birch Lake 

deposit.  

 

PolyMet purchased the Cliffs Erie, LLC (Cliffs Natural Resources) taconite plant and 

tailings basin near Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota, in 2005 and completed its definitive 

feasibility study on the NorthMet Deposit in 2006.  The State of Minnesota has released 

the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for PolyMet's NorthMet project. The 

release of this draft EIS is part of the pre-permitting and pre-development activities for 

the NorthMet project. After public comments and review, the State will issue the final 

EIS and a Record of Decision on the project which will be followed by the issuance of 

permits. With the issuance of permits PolyMet will initiate construction, currently 

forecast for late 2010. 

 

Teck Cominco is currently working on its Mesaba Deposit and has undertaken 

advanced processing tests of Mesaba mineralization using its proprietary CESL process.   

 

Encampment, a private company, has conducted geophysical surveys and has initiated 

drilling near its Filson Creek property.

 16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The following is taken from the 2008 report of Routledge. No additional 

metallurgical work has been reported by DML. 

 

NOKOMIS METALLURGICAL TEST WORK 

Bench-scale flotation test work on a composite sample of drill core from the Nokomis 

Deposit was undertaken in 2007 at SGS Lakefield for DML.  The composite graded 

0.75% Cu, 0.24% Ni, 0.19 g/t Pt, 0.43 g/t Pd and 0.12 g/t Au.  The primary objective was 

to establish the general amenability to flotation recovery of base and precious metals and 

to produce a bulk concentrate for testing by hydrometallurgical (pressure leaching) 

means.  

 

Pressure leaching test work was limited to a preliminary evaluation of the proprietary 

PLATSOL™ process, developed at SGS Lakefield by International PGM Technologies 

Ltd. It is considered the preferred option for treatment of Nokomis material. The 

PLATSOL™ process is based on a conventional high pressure, high temperature acid 

leach, but incorporates the use of chloride to solubilise gold and PGMs. 

 

Additional testing is now underway at SGS Lakefield and Coleraine Minerals 

Research Laboratory. 

 

SUMMARY RESULTS 
Scott Wilson RPA has reviewed the SGS Lakefield test work.  The key points are 

summarized below: 

• Ni recovery to concentrate is limited by the amount of silicate Ni, which 
appears to be about 25% in the sample but has been reported to be 0.1% Ni to 
0.3% Ni in the heads.  Consequently, overall Ni recovery of 71.8% was 
projected from tests. 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 16-2 

• The sample tested is reasonably representative of the head grade expected for 
the deposit at a cut-off grade of 0.7% Cu. 

 
• Regrinding of the concentrate had a negative effect on Ni flotation in the test 

work, however, it is expected that regrinding (around a P80 of 19 µm) will be 
required to adequately liberate pentlandite.  This needs further investigation. 
 

• The PLATSOL™ test work was limited to a single test on a 100 g sample of 
bulk concentrate.  Recoveries reported from the work are only "projections" 
and should be viewed with caution until further work is completed.  Overall 
PGM recoveries are higher than seen in testing other concentrates. 

 
• The production of separate concentrates, a low grade bulk concentrate (6.3% 

Cu, 4.5% Ni) and a reasonably high grade Cu concentrate (28% Cu, 1.0% Ni) 
at overall recoveries of 95% for copper in the copper concentrate and the bulk 
concentrate and 61% for nickel in the bulk concentrate, may merit 
consideration as an alternative processing route. This process route, including 
only a concentrator without a hydrometallurgical plant, should be further 
investigated. 

 

SAMPLES 
Test work was conducted on a composite sample received on May 3, 2007, 

comprising approximately 225 kg contained in 13 pails from the Nokomis Deposit.  After 

crushing to -6 mesh and blending, a 10 kg sample was set aside for Bond Work Index 

(BWI) testing and another 80 kg sample was crushed to -10 mesh, homogenized and split 

into 2 kg charges for flotation test work.  The 150 kg remainder was stored for future use. 

 

The composite sample approximates the average grade and mineralogy of the 

Indicated Resource at Nokomis at a 0.7% Cu cut-off grade.  Head analyses of the 

composites from the SGS Lakefield report are shown in Tables 16-1 and 16-2. 

 

MINERALOGY 
A QEMSCAN mineralogical study was conducted in conjunction with the test work 

to determine the deportment of copper and nickel mineralization.  A 2 kg sample was 

ground in a ball mill for 25 minutes and classified into four size fractions.  A polished 

section from each fraction was prepared and submitted for QEMSCAN analysis.  A 

significant observation was that a significant portion of the nickel (about 22%) is non-

sulphide.  The agreement between wet chemical analysis and QEMSCAN analytical 

results was reasonable.

The distribution of chalcopyrite, cubanite and pentlandite increases in the finer 

fractions.  Pyrrhotite distribution remains almost constant in all fractions.  About 80% of 

total copper in the ore is in chalcopyrite and 18% in cubanite.  Pentlandite was the only 

nickel mineral detected. 

 

GRINDING 
A sample submitted for Bond ball mill work index determination was found to have a 

BWI of 16.3 kWh/t at a product size of 150 microns. The Nokomis ore is considered 

medium hard.

 16-4 

FLOTATION 
The test work program included a series of rougher kinetic flotation tests to evaluate 

the response of the ore to the effect of grind and reagents.  Rougher kinetic tests indicated 

that a primary grind of 100 µm is appropriate for the recovery of Cu and Ni.  Copper 

rougher recovery can reach 95%, but the maximum nickel recovery was only 78%, 

primarily due to the presence of Ni in the unrecoverable silicates.  However, Ni 

recoveries from the sulphide fraction can also reach 95%. SIPX (Sodium Isopropyl 

Xanthate) provided the best recoveries of sulphides and should be used if bulk flotation is 

pursued. 

 

Three cleaner tests were conducted primarily to assess the rougher concentrate 

regrind P80.  One test was completed with no regrind, one at a P80 of 35 μm and another at 

P80 of 19μm.   Regrinding had a positive effect on copper, with the highest recovery 

attained at a P80 of 19 μm, however, Ni recovery was adversely affected by finer grinding 

resulting in the poorest recovery.  It is theorized that slower flotation kinetics of 

pentlandite is likely due to the finer particle size.   

 

Additional cleaner tests were conducted with the aim of optimizing conditions ahead 

of locked cycle testing.  Two of the cleaner tests were conducted on 10 kg of feed to 

generate concentrate for downstream work.  Two locked cycle tests were conducted to 

assess the effect of recirculating products on metallurgy and also to generate sufficient 

concentrate for downstream testing and tailing for environmental testing.   

 

Because the expected process will involve hydrometallurgical treatment of a flotation 

concentrate rather than conventional smelting, the grade of concentrate produced is of 

secondary importance to recovery, provided that the sulphide sulphur level in the 

concentrate is sufficient to maintain a satisfactory heat balance in the autoclave. 

 

The first locked cycle test, LCT-1, was completed to produce two separate 

concentrates.  The final copper concentrate grade was 28.5% Cu and 1.0% Ni with a 

recovery of 67.3% and 7.4%, respectively (from the last 2 cycles).  A bulk concentrate 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 16-5 

with a concentrate grade of 6.3% Cu and 4.5% Ni at a recovery of 27.3% Cu and 61.1% 

Ni was also produced.  The second locked cycle test, LCT-2, was conducted to produce a 

bulk concentrate only.  The LCT-2 bulk concentrate graded 12.3% Cu and 3.1% Ni with 

a recovery of 95.2% and 72.5%, respectively (from the last 2 cycles). 

 

The test work indicates that a concentrate comprising about 5% to 6% of the ore 

weight is appropriate.  At this concentration ratio, and subject to more definitive test 

work, expected metal recoveries are 94% to 95% for copper, 69% to 73% for nickel, and 

approximately 73% to 87% for platinum group metals and gold.  

 

PRESSURE LEACHING 
A single batch pressure leach test was conducted to establish preliminary metal 

extractions and to confirm general amenability of the Nokomis flotation concentrate to 

the PLATSOL™ process. Batch pressure leach tests are considered adequate to 

demonstrate gold and PGM behaviour under PLATSOL™ conditions, while semi-

continuous test results are better used to establish base metal leach rates. The results 

show that high base metal and PGM extractions can be obtained with the process. 

 

Tables 16-3 and 16-4 summarize analyses of the flotation concentrate derived from 

cycle flotation tests and used in the pressure leach program.

FUTURE TEST WORK 

Future test work on Nokomis should include more definitive bench scale flotation test 

work, as well as grindability and other work required for preliminary process design. 

Assuming that the flotation response is generally similar, additional test work will be 

undertaken to obtain more concentrate feed for PLATSOL™ testing.  Data will be 

obtained in order to plan a pilot plant campaign.   

 

A 38 metric tonne bulk sample of Nokomis mineralization has been collected as feed 

for pilot plant flotation test work to generate concentrate for an integrated PLATSOL™ 

program to prove the process at pilot scale and to generate process design data.  

 

Environmental test work should also be pursued with the future work and, in 

particular, the possibility of having a separate storage for pyrrhotite tailings.  

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 

The proposed process for Nokomis involves flotation of a bulk sulphide concentrate 

containing copper, nickel, PGMs and gold and subsequent leaching and recovery of 

metals using the proprietary PLATSOL™ process. The PLATSOL™ process includes 

pressure leaching of concentrate under conditions suitable for simultaneously solubilising 

the base and precious metals. The pressure leach process will be followed by liquid/solid 

separation, recovery of PGMs and gold from the clarified solution by precipitation or 

adsorption, copper and nickel recovery using solvent extraction and electrowinning to 

produce cathode, and precipitation of a cobalt product from a bleed stream. This expected 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 16-7 

general process is illustrated in the following simplified flow sheet (Figure 16-1), and 

may be subject to change as the test work proceeds. The copper and nickel would be a 

direct saleable product, and the cobalt and PGM-gold products will be shipped to 

refineries for processing.     

 

The PLATSOL™ process has undergone extensive test work at SGS Lakefield, using 

material from PolyMet's NorthMet deposit. However, this process has not been 

commercially demonstrated.  

 

The predicted metal extractions for Nokomis are shown in Table 16-5.

 17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL 
RESERVE ESTIMATES 
MINERAL RESOURCES 

SUMMARY 
Scott Wilson RPA has reviewed drilling data (for holes drilled to the end of March, 

2009) for the Nokomis Deposit and has independently estimated Mineral Resources in 

accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards on 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, as adopted by the CIM Council on December 

11, 2005.  The resource estimate uses data from all relevant drill holes, including the core 

sample assays, down hole surveys and specific gravity data, to generate a model of 

interpolated grades using two different methods: ordinary kriging for base metals and 

inverse distance squared (ID2) for PGE and precious metals. The interpolation routines 

were constrained by the wireframe models for the deposit which were constructed at a 

cut-off grade of 1.0% copper equivalent (CuEq). The CuEq formula is based upon Net 

Smelter Return factors determined for the Preliminary Assessment by Scott Wilson RPA 

(January 18, 2008). 

 

The Nokomis Deposit is, in part, the down-plunge continuation of the Maturi Deposit 

located on the Franconia Federal Lease. This lease adjoins the DML property on its 

northwest side.  In order to construct a complete grade model for the mineralization the 

historic data from this, and other adjacent properties, was used to create a larger 

wireframe and database.  Unfortunately, many of the historic holes lacked assay values 

for one or more of Co, PGEs, Au or Ag. To overcome this problem, the values for these 

metals were estimated using a regression formula derived from the recent MEX drill 

holes (a more complete set of values is available for Cu, Ni, Co, Au, Ag, and PGEs in the 

DML MEX series of holes). The estimated values were entered by Scott Wilson RPA 

into the resource estimation database.   

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 17-2 

The DML property boundary has been used to clip the wireframe so that the mineral 

resource estimate is only for that portion of the deposit that lies within the DML property 

boundary. The resource estimate is based entirely on diamond drilling and core sample 

assays.  

 

Indicated and Inferred Resources are shown in Table 17-1; both CuEq and Cu cut-off 

grades are shown. Based on Scott Wilson RPA's review of metal prices, process 

recoveries, refining costs, and underground mine operating costs likely to apply at the 

Nokomis Deposit site, the 1.0% CuEq cut-off grade is reasonable for the statement of 

Indicated and Inferred Resources at this time.

5. Resources were estimated to a maximum depth of approximately 1,350 m. 
6. Copper equivalent (CuEq%) is based on Net Smelter Return Factors as determined for the Preliminary 

Assessment by Scott Wilson RPA dated January 18, 2008.  
7. Metal Prices used were $1.75/lb copper, $7.00/lb nickel, $10.00/lb Co, $600/oz Au, $1100/oz Pt and 

$350/oz Pd. 
8. Copper equivalent (CuEq%) = Cu% + 3.03 x Ni% + 0.63 x Co% + 0.30 x Au g/t + 0.76 x Pt g/t + 0.24 x Pd 

g/t based on expected metal prices and process recovery and refining charges. 
9. TPM is Au g/t + Pt g/t + Pd g/t. 
10. Co, Au, Pt, Pd grades, that are lacking in historic drill holes, have been entered in the resource database 

based on regression of assay grades from DML drill hole assays.

DATABASE 
The resource estimate for the Nokomis Deposit is based on 314 intercepts. Of these, 

242 intercepts are from the MEX-series holes (for a cumulative total of 10,157 m, or 

33,323 ft., including wedges) and 72 intercepts are from historic drill holes (for a 

cumulative total of 4,033 m or 13,232 ft.).

WIREFRAME MODEL AND CUT-OFF GRADE 
Two wireframes were created for the Nokomis Deposit using a 1.0% CuEq value over 

a minimum width of 3 m (9.8 ft.): 

 

1. The Main Nokomis wireframe. The mineralization within this wireframe 
occurs at or near the footwall of the Duluth Complex and it may locally 
continue for several metres into the altered, granitic basement rocks. 
 

2. A smaller, discrete Footwall Zone of mineralization hosted within granitic 
rocks of the basement. Continuity of this mineralization is imperfect 
although grades greater than the cut-off value can be traced between holes 
in the modelled area. 

 

The CuEq formula defining the wireframes is based upon Net Smelter Return factors 

determined for the Preliminary Assessment by Scott Wilson RPA (January 18, 2008) 

using such inputs as metal prices, mill and PLATSOLTM leach recoveries and various 

market assumptions.   

 

The wireframe for the Nokomis Deposit is approximately 6.1 km long and 2.5 km 

wide with its long axis oriented northeast-southwest. The mineralization comes to surface 

just outside the north and northwest sides of the DML property boundary. The deepest 

part of the wireframe is located approximately 1,310 m (4,298 ft.) below surface.  The 

Footwall Zone within the granitic rocks in the central portion of the deposit is 927 m 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 17-4 

(3,041 ft.) long in the northeast-southwest direction and 414 m (1,358 ft.) wide in the 

northwest-southeast direction.  Table 17-2 shows the average thicknesses of the two 

zones. Figures 17-1 and 17-2 are plan and section views respectively of the Nokomis 

Deposit wireframes (the Footwall Zone, in cyan, is beneath the Main Zone, in red).   
 

ASSAYS AND ASSAY STATISTICS 
In most cases, the samples from the historic drill holes (pre-MEX series) were only 

assayed for Cu and Ni. In order to use the historic holes for grade interpolation Scott 

Wilson RPA used the recent drill holes (MEX series) to determine the correlation 

coefficients for all six assayed elements (Ni, Cu, Co, Au, Pt and Pd). The calculated 

linear regression equations for the MEX series data were used to calculate the missing 

entries for Co, Au, Pt and Pd in the historic holes. Compositing and grade interpolation 

routines were then applied to both the calculated values (historic holes) and the 

laboratory determined values (MEX series holes).  The formulae used are: 

 

 Co = 0.0317Ni% + 0.037 (R2 = 0.5977) 

 Au = 0.1199Cu% + 0.0018 (R2 = 0.5396) 

 Pd = 0.4718Cu% +.0029 (R2 = 0.6814) 

 Pt = 0.43Pd g/t + 0.0024 (R2 = 0.7474) 

 

Scott Wilson RPA examined descriptive statistics for the assays within the 

wireframes (Table 17-3).  

 

COMPOSITING 
To regularize the sample support for grade interpolation the raw assays were 

composited to equal lengths of 3.5 m (11.5 ft.).  This length is longer than 96% of the raw 

assay sample lengths.  Statistics for the composites within the wireframes are shown in 

Table 17-4.  Composites shorter than one metre (3.28 ft.) were omitted from the 

interpolation routine.  A comparison of average grades between the excluded and retained 

composites indicated no grade bias introduced by the exclusion.

GRADE CAPPING 
Scott Wilson RPA examined histograms and cumulative frequency plots for Cu and 

Ni assay grades within the wireframes to determine if any outliers should be capped. 

Both copper and nickel show almost normal distributions (slight positive skew) with a 

few values above 3% for copper (<0.12% of the assays) and 1.0% for nickel (<0.25% of 

the assays). Scott Wilson RPA elected to leave these few values uncapped (Figure 17-3). 

An analysis of the average grades for Cu and Ni in the uncapped and capped datasets 

found negligible impact.  

 

BULK DENSITY 
DML measured 15 cm (0.5 ft.) lengths of mostly split core for their specific gravity 

(SG). Samples were routinely taken at 1.52 m to 3.05 m (5 ft. to 10 ft.) intervals down the 

hole in the MEX series holes to provide a database of 2,789 tests.  SG determinations 

were done by water displacement in a graduated cylinder.  Scott Wilson RPA correlated 

the mineralized host rock types with SGs to arrive at a length-weighted average SG of 

3.01 for the mineralized zone.  A bulk density of 3.01 t/m3 was used for volume 

conversion to tonnage for the resource estimate. 

 

BLOCK MODEL 
A 3D block model was created for the Nokomis Deposit using 50 m by 50 m by 10 m 

blocks (164 ft. by 164 ft. by 33 ft.).  Model specifications are shown below.

For this update, the block model was expanded to accommodate the new Main Zone 

wireframe that was created to include data from the latest drilling programs.  The model, 

which is not rotated because the drill grid is oriented north-south, contains 1,725,000 

blocks for a volume of 43,125 million m3 (887,568 ft3). The block model carries the 

following attributes:  rock/ore type, bulk density, Cu, Ni, Co, Au, Pt, Pd and Ag.   

 

For volumetric control within the wireframes, the GEMS 6.1.4 software estimates the 

percentage of any resource block that falls inside and outside the wireframe.  This 

contrasts with other mining software that use smaller blocks (sub-blocks or sub-cells) to 

improve the precision of the wireframe volume estimate.  

 

VARIOGRAPHY 
Down-hole linear semi-variogram composite grades were used to determine the 

nugget (C0) for 3D variography.  Scott Wilson RPA constructed semi-variograms for 

strike, dip, and thickness directions for Cu and Ni for this estimate using the updated 

dataset.  Results of the variography are shown below:  

 
Copper       

Axis Orientation Co C1 Range (m) C2 Range (m) 
Strike 052ºAz./0º 0.33 0.34 49 0.33 268 
Dip 142ºAz./-20º 0.33 0.34 64 0.33 337 
Thickness 322ºAz./-70º 0.33 0.05 33 0.62 39 

 
Nickel       
Axis Orientation Co C1 Range (m) C2 Range (m) 

Strike 052ºAz./0º 0.33 0.29 53 0.38 189 
Dip 142ºAz./-20º 0.33 0.29 96 0.38 347 
Thickness 322ºAz./-70º 0.33 0.15 14 0.51 46 

 

The variograms for both copper and nickel are shown in Appendix A. The difference 

in C1 ranges between this report and that of Routledge (2008) is believed to reflect the 

influence of closer-spaced samples from the multiple wedge-cuts in the metallurgical 

holes. In addition, this report uses a larger data set within a larger wireframe which will 

create differences in the variogram outputs.

INTERPOLATION 
Scott Wilson RPA used ordinary kriging (OK) for Ni and Cu grade interpolation with 

kriging profiles developed from the Ni and Cu variograms.  Inverse distance squared 

(ID2) interpolation was used for Au, Pt, Pd and Ag, using Cu variogram range search 

distances. Cobalt was interpolated using the Ni OK and search parameters.  Anisotropic 

(ellipse) search distances were established from the copper and nickel variography.   

 

For OK and ID2, a minimum of four composites and a maximum of 12 composites 

were used to populate the blocks during Pass 1. To assign grades to all blocks in the 

wireframes, Scott Wilson RPA employed second and third interpolation passes with 

expanded searches.  For Pass 2, a minimum of two composites was used while Pass 3 

used a minimum of one composite. In both cases (Passes 2 and 3), the maximum number 

of composites was 12.  Search distance parameters are:

RESOURCE REPORTING AND CLASSIFICATION 
Resource blocks within the wireframe were only counted if they fell within the DML 

property boundaries (magenta lines in Figure 17-8).  

 

Scott Wilson RPA classifies the resources in the Nokomis Deposit as Indicated or 

Inferred Mineral Resources using CIM definitions. For Nokomis, Indicated Resources are 

blocks lying within 100 m (328 ft.) of a composite value while Inferred Resources are 

blocks where the nearest composite value is greater than 100 m (328 ft.).  This distance is 

approximately two-thirds of the variogram distance. A region of contiguous blocks 

(shown as a brown line in Figure 17-8) was selected and reported as Indicated Resources 

within the DML property boundary. Any other resource blocks within the property 

boundary were classified as Inferred Mineral Resources.   

 

MODEL VALIDATION 
The grade interpolation results were validated by: 

• On-screen checks to ensure that the interpolated block grades, within reason, 
match the local composite values. 

• Comparison of average assay, composites and block grades (Table 17-5).  

• A numerical comparison of the copper grades (Indicated) for OK with the 
results for interpolation by inverse distance squared (ID2) and Nearest 
Neighbour (NN).   

• A review of the spatial distribution of Indicated Resource blocks at 
incremental cut-off grades to verify that the resource remains reasonably 
continuous at increasing copper cut-offs.  

 

The block grades compare reasonably well to both the assay and composite values when 

all three data types are viewed together on screen.  The decrease in average grades from 

assays to composites is expected (Table 17-5) but the increase in average block grade (by 

6% from the composites) suggests minor grade smearing of some higher values (even 

though the grade range, variance and coefficient of variation have all decreased).   Grade 

differences between the interpolation methods were less than 1% which tends to support 

the veracity of the OK model.  Finally, resource blocks in the zones are reasonably 

continuous at copper cut-offs up to 0.8%.

 19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA has independently estimated both Indicated and Inferred Mineral 

Resources for the Nokomis Deposit using 3D block modelling and grade interpolation by 

ordinary kriging and inverse distance squared.  The depth, tonnes and grade profile for 

this deposit suggest that bulk underground mining should be the preferred method of 

exploitation.   

 

The Nokomis Deposit is located within DML's Nokomis Property within which the 

2006-2009 diamond drilling has been conducted.  The Cu-Ni-Co-Au-PGE bearing 

mineralization extends up-dip (off the property) and up-plunge to the west and northwest 

and is more or less continuous with the mineralization known as the Maturi Deposit.  

 

The wider-spaced drilling pattern from previous years was reduced by in-fill drilling 

in 2007, 2008 and 2009. As shown in this report, the closer-spaced drilling has created a 

larger Indicated Resource category for the Nokomis Deposit when compared to the 2007 

and 2008 estimates. In fact, the majority of the 2007-2009 drill holes are located within 

the Indicated Resource domain. The Nokomis Deposit remains open down-dip and along 

strike, where there is the real potential for additional resources. As well, within the 

mineralized envelope, copper and nickel display good grade continuity over significant 

distances and there is the opportunity to expand the poorly-tested footwall mineralization 

through additional drilling. 

 

The resource estimate is based entirely on diamond drilling and core assaying from 

both DML and previous explorers. Scott Wilson RPA has checked DML's drilling and 

assaying methodology and notes that it has been carried out to current industry standards.  

Scott Wilson RPA was unable to verify the methodology of the previous explorers but 

notes that the Indicated Resource (higher-confidence) is defined mostly by DML's recent 

MEX series holes which have verifiable data. The estimate does use some of the historic 

drill holes that are known to have less reliable down-hole surveys and generally lack 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 19-2 

cobalt, gold and PGE assays. In general, these historic holes are located within the 

Inferred Resources category.   

 

 In order to use the pre-DML holes, the missing cobalt, gold and PGE grades were 

estimated as "calculated values" derived from a regression analysis of the more complete 

DML assays. This permits interpolation of grades into those resource blocks that extend 

across the north and west property boundaries. Because of the uncertainties attached to 

these historic holes the resource classification for these blocks is lower than that for 

blocks using the MEX series drilling data. Even with these minor uncertainties, Scott 

Wilson RPA believes that the database is suitable for resource and reserve estimation. 

 

The resources on the Nokomis Property were reported by clipping the resource block 

model at the property boundary. Property boundaries follow the State Public Land 

System and, for the most part, are not evident on the ground, although a Township survey 

marker has been located.  Going forward with exploration and potential development, a 

boundary survey will be necessary.  Since the Nokomis Deposit is, in part, continuous 

down dip from the Maturi Deposit located on Franconia's land to the west and northwest, 

accurate positioning of the boundary is necessary to delineate resources on the respective 

properties.

 20 RECOMMENDATIONS 
This Scott Wilson RPA Resource Estimate Update indicates that the Nokomis 

Deposit merits further work, much of which was recommended in the last Preliminary 

Assessment (January 2009).  Areas of concentration include: 

 

1. Upgrade drilling to benefit mine development planning, provide additional 
metallurgical samples, and provide samples for waste rock characterization.  

 
2. Continue environmental baseline data collection, scoping, modelling, sampling, 

and inventory, and continue to focus on the requirements needed for permitting.  
 
3. Undertake rock mechanic and mine planning studies. 
 
4. Continue flotation and hydrometallurgical test work and conduct pilot plant 

operations to confirm recoveries, to allow the development of detailed process 
design criteria, and to demonstrate product purity samples. 

 
5. Tailings chemistry and disposal should be evaluated, including options for paste 

backfill.   
 
6. Initiate the Pre-Feasibility stage of assessment. 
 

RECOMMENDED PROGRAM AND BUDGET 
DML has already initiated all of the recommendations set out in the Preliminary 

Assessment and is in various stages of completion of those activities. Approximately 38 

metric tonnes of metallurgical bulk sample has been collected by a large diameter PQ 

drill program.  This core is currently securely stored at Ely, Minnesota, in sealed drums 

purged with nitrogen. 

 

A recommended program and budget for the continuation of these activities through 

to the end of 2010 is shown in Table 20-1.

APPENDIX B 

HIGHER-GRADE AREAS 
Six areas of higher-grade mineralization within the larger global resource have been 

manually defined within the 1% CuEq Nokomis wireframe (Figures 25-5 and 25-6).  

Three of these areas, which are informally termed the Eastern, Central and Western 

Areas, represent regions of more or less contiguous blocks above a nominal cut-off grade 

of 0.7% Cu. Table 25-1 shows the cumulative Inferred and Indicated Resources for these 

three areas. Tables 25-2 and 25-3 show the Indicated and Inferred Resources, 

respectively, for each area. 

 

In addition, three other higher-grade areas have been defined using the same criteria. 

These areas are called Areas A, B and C. Table 25-4 shows the Indicated Resources for 

Areas A, B and C, and Table 25-5 shows the Inferred Resources for Areas B and C.  Note 

that Area A has no Inferred Resources.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resource estimation and classification.  
2. Mineral Resources are estimated at a zone definition (wireframe) cut-off grade of approximately 1.0% Cu 

equivalent grade (CuEq). 
3. The approximately 1.0% CuEq cut-off grade includes all material in the wireframe zones. 
4. Bulk density is 3.01 t/m3. 
5. Resources were estimated to a maximum depth of approximately 1,350 m. 
6. CuEq% is based on Net Smelter Return factors as determined for the Preliminary Assessment by Scott 

Wilson RPA dated January 18, 2008. 
7. Metal Prices used were $1.75/lb Cu, $7.00/lb Ni, $10.00/lb Co, $600/oz Au, $1100/oz Pt and $350/oz Pd. 
8. CuEq% = Cu% + 3.03 x Ni% + 0.63 x Co% + 0.30 x Au g/t + 0.76 x Pt g/t + 0.24 x Pd g/t based on 

expected metal prices and process recovery and refining charges. 
9. TPM is Au g/t + Pt g/t + Pd g/t. 
10. Co, Au, Pt, Pd grades that are lacking in historic drill holes have been entered in the resource database 

based on regression of assay grades from DML drill hole assays.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resource estimation and classification. 
2. Mineral Resources are estimated at a zone definition (wireframe) cut-off grade of approximately 1.0% Cu 

equivalent grade (CuEq).  
3. The approximately 1.0% CuEq cut-off grade includes all material in the wireframe zones. 
4. Bulk density is 3.01 t/m3. 
5. Resources were estimated to a maximum depth of approximately 1,350 m. 
6. CuEq% is based on Net Smelter Return factors as determined for the Preliminary Assessment by Scott 

Wilson RPA dated January 18, 2008.  
7. Metal Prices used were $1.75/lb Cu, $7.00/lb Ni, $10.00/lb Co, $600/oz Au, $1100/oz Pt and $350/oz Pd. 
8. CuEq% = Cu% + 3.03 x Ni% + 0.63 x Co% + 0.30 x Au g/t + 0.76 x Pt g/t + 0.24 x Pd g/t based on 

expected metal prices and process recovery and refining charges. 
9. TPM is Au g/t + Pt g/t + Pd g/t. 
10. Co, Au, Pt, Pd grades that are lacking in historic drill holes have been entered in the resource database 

based on regression of assay grades from DML drill hole assays.
