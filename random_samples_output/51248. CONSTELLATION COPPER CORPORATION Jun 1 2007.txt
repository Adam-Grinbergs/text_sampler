San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

Executive Summary (Item 3) 
Property Description and Accessibility 
The Constellation Copper Corporation (CCC) San Javier Copper Project is located 
approximately 140km east-southeast of Hermosillo on the western flank of the Sierra Madre 
Occidental in Sonora, Mexico.  The property is located south and east of the town of San Javier, 
and is accessible from Hermosillo by a paved and well-maintained two-lane highway. 

The land position held by CCC consists of four separate options to purchase eight concessions 
totaling 687.2695ha.  These concessions are 100% controlled by CCC and have no royalty 
attached.  

The climate at San Javier is semi arid with a pronounced dry season from October to June and a 
monsoon season from June through September. 

While the topography in the immediate vicinity of the three deposits is extremely rugged, there is 
a large area of flat to gently sloping topography immediately to the east of Cerro Verde sufficient 
for a heap leach and process facility.  This area lies outside the concessions held by CCC but is 
within ground for which CCC hold surface exploration rights.  

Geology and Mineralization 
The deposits being examined within the concessions have been interpreted to be of the iron-
oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) style hosted within Laramide-age intermediate-to-felsic volcanic 
rocks.   

Significant copper mineralization is hosted primarily within hydrothermal-tectonic breccias and 
associated stockworks.  The breccias commonly exhibit massive specularite replacement.  The 
degree of copper mineralization is strongly associated with specularite and with intense structural 
preparation. 

Drilling demonstrates that the original sulfides, primarily chalcopyrite, have been oxidized to 
depths exceeding 200m below the existing topography.  Within this oxidized zone, copper 
mineralization consists primarily of copper oxides, silicates, and carbonates as fracture filling 
and occupies sites of original sulfide mineralization.  Chalcocite is also present in the oxidized 
and transitional zones. 

The depth of oxidation appears to be highly variable and primarily controlled by structural 
penetration from the topographic surface. 

Three deposits have been defined to date aligned along a southwest-northeast trend.  From 
southwest to northeast, these are Cerro Verde, Mesa Grande and La Trinidad.   

Exploration 
Cerro Verde is at an advanced exploration stage having been explored by previous owners 
including Phelps Dodge (eight core holes in 1996) and Peñoles (18 core holes in the 1960-
1970's).  CCC has drilled a further 57 core and 14 reverse circulation drillholes at Cerro Verde in 
2006; an additional 7 holes have been drilled at La Trinidad and Mesa Grande. 

Surface mapping and sampling and drilling have demonstrated a zone of significant copper 
mineralization extending 1,200m along strike, 400 to 500m across strike and 200m deep.

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

The copper mineralization at Cerro Verde is extremely continuous with significantly mineralized 
intervals ranging from 20 to 200m in boreholes.  Copper grade attenuates rapidly and often 
appears to be truncated by post mineral structural movement that may be related to basin and 
range extensional faulting.  

The Mesa Grande deposit lies some 2km northeast of Cerro Verde and is yet poorly defined.  
Surface mapping has outlined significant areas of stockwork development and alteration 
bleaching; however drilling is still in early stages.  A few drillholes on the eastern flank have 
returned significant oxidized copper mineralization. 

The mineralization that has been identified at Mesa Grande is confined to the eastern area of the 
much larger mesa.  While access for drill sites is not as problematic as at Cerro Verde the eastern 
face is sufficiently steep, with cliffs several 10's of meters high, to warrant careful planning and 
design.  

La Trinidad lies approximately 100m north of the northern extent of Mesa Grande.  La Trinidad 
was mined for copper in the past using underground mining methods.  The historic workings 
were mapped and sampled in 1994 by Orcana Resources Limited.  The sample map shows an 
interpreted zone of mineralization of 20 to 30m in width trending to the northwest with grades 
ranging from 0.81% to 2.12% total copper.  These results should be viewed with some caution as 
additional copper oxides may have been deposited by efflorescence on the surface of the 
workings subsequent to mining.   

CCC does not have the historic production records for La Trinidad.  The underground map 
prepared by Orcana outlines a stope of approximately 50m in length by 8m in width, however 
the vertical extent and dip of the mineralization is not shown and the extracted volume cannot be 
calculated. 

Mineralization at La Trinidad appears to be hosted by a rhyolitic rather than andesitic host rock 
as at Cerro Verde or Mesa Grande, however the ore mineralogy and association of copper with 
specular hematite appears to be the same.  

The current exploration program is designed to: 

• Further delineate the  Cerro Verde deposit to a level consistent with a pre-feasibility 
study in 2007; 

• Advance Mesa Grande to the point of defining the extent and geometry of mineralization 
in order to assess the merits of proceeding to a comparable data density for incorporation 
into the Cerro Verde study.  This may be concurrent or subsequent to the initial Cerro 
Verde study; and 

• Undertake confirmatory exploration at La Trinidad to test the indications given by the 
Orcana investigation. 

This work will include:  

• Infill drilling to increase sample data density; verification and independent confirmation 
of the results of previous drilling results by previous holders of the property; 

• Appropriate QA/QC verification on pre-CCC core when submitted for re-assay;  

• Metallurgical testing of the various mineralized rock types identified to date; and

• Further petrographic studies to identify the various copper bearing minerals and 
understand the relationship between mineralogy and acid solubility. 

As of the date of this report, CCC has not initiated any environmental studies, or applied for any 
permits in support of development or exploitation.  

Resource Estimation and Statement 
The resource was estimated using a two-pass procedure of defining a grade shell at 0.1% copper 
with the use of indicator kriging and then estimating grade inside that shell with ordinary kriging, 
using only composites inside the shell. 

A pit optimization was run using a floating cone algorithm with the following parameters: 

• Copper Price - $2.40/lb; and 

• Copper recovery based on ratio of the sum of acid soluble and cyanide copper to total 
copper. 

SRK validated the model by visual examination of the composites and block grades in cross-
section and plan view, confirming assay and composite statistics, and producing swath plots by 
northing, easting, and elevation.  It is SRK's opinion that the resource has been estimated 
according to industry standards. 

The resource at Cerro Verde is entirely classified as inferred and is contained within an 
optimized pit at $2.40 copper.  The resource is 85Mt at 0.35% copper, containing 629Mlbs of 
copper and is listed in Table 1.

Inferred 81.0 0.35 629.0 

 

Conclusions and Recommendations 
The San Javier Project consists of an early stage development project at Cerro Verde and 
exploration targets at La Trinidad and Mesa Grande.  A significant body of near surface, 
contiguous oxide copper mineralization has been delineated at Cerro Verde. This report contains 
a mineral resource estimation for the Cerro Verde deposit, which is entirely inferred at this stage 
of development.  Exploration at the project is on-going. 

The drilling that has been done consists of fans of core and RC holes with collars spaced at about 
100m.  The sample spacing therefore has a wide variability.  The drill program that is in progress 
is designed to reduce the sample spacing and thereby increase the knowledge of geologic 
controls on mineralization. 

The assaying has been conducted by a certified laboratory and a program of laboratory QA/QC 
has been instituted.  CCC recognizes that some improvements could be made to the QA/QC 
procedures, particularly with the standard samples. 

Data verification procedures have revealed some inconsistencies in recording values below 
detection limit.  However, no errors were found in recording values above detection limit.  SRK 
considers the database reliable for use in resource estimation.

Constellation Copper Corp.  IV 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 
 

The resource estimation has been conducted within industry standards and has been validated by 
SRK.   

SRK recommends that CCC review the database and correct the inconsistencies regarding the 
recording of values below detection limit. 

Further metallurgical testwork should be done on the property.  SRK acknowledges that CCC 
has column tests in progress that will help in establishing metallurgical recoveries. 

Significant mineralization has been delineated at Cerro Verde.  SRK recommends that CCC 
continue drilling and initiate a preliminary assessment on the project.

2 Property Description & Location (Item 6) 
The San Javier Property lies 140km east-southeast of Hermosillo in the state of Sonora, Mexico, 
and immediately adjacent to Mexican Highway 16, a paved two-lane road (Figure 2-1).  The 
coordinates are 28º 34' N; 109º 44' 30'W.  The property is approximately 3km southeast of the 
small town of San Javier. 

The project consists of three separate areas, Cerro Verde, La Trinidad, and Mesa Grande.  A 
resource estimate has been prepared for Cerro Verde and is presented in this report.  

2.1 Mineral Titles 
The property consists of two non-contiguous groups of concessions (Figure 2-2) 100% controlled 
by CCC through an option to purchase agreement.  Group 1 contains the Cerro Verde deposit 
and is 379.81ha in area and consists of five separate concessions.  Group 2 contains the Mesa 
Grande and La Trinidad deposits, is 307.4595ha in area and consists of three separate 
concessions.   

The properties have all been legally surveyed in accordance with Mexican requirements for a 
legal survey before granting title. 

A complete listing of the concessions within each group is presented in Table 2.1.1 below.

CCC holds the rights to these concessions by purchase option agreements with the various claim 
holders.  CCC must honor a set payment schedule to the holders in order to retain these rights.  
The concession status allows both exploration and exploitation.  The underlying exploitation 
rights are valid for 50 years from the effective date and extend  to, or beyond, the year 2040. 

On August 29, 2006, Eduardo Robles, acting as Special Mexican Counsel to CCC, issued a letter 
of opinion to the underwriters, regarding the validity of the concessions.  The statement of 
opinion from this letter is presented below: 

"I do not know of any fact, reason, or law pursuant to which the Report, the Concessions, the 
2005 Status Certificates, the Work Reports, the Receipts, the 2006 Status Certificates, and the 
Contracts (collectively, the "Opinion Documents") would have ceased to be current or valid.

Constellation Copper Corp.  2-2 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

After having reviewed the Option Contracts, I have come to the conclusions (the "Conclusions") 
(as qualified below and save for the information still missing) that (i) the Concessions are in 
good standing and marketable from a legal viewpoint, (ii) the Concessions grant their owners 
full mineral resources exploration and exploitation rights, subject only to the fulfillment of the 
requirements and obligations provided in the Mining Law and its Regulations, and (iii) Terrazas 
and SJC, either as owners of certain of the Concessions or as holders of exploration and 
exploitation rights under the Contracts or as holders of options to purchase certain of the 
Concessions pursuant to the Contracts, lawfully hold and exercise those mineral rights and 
lawfully hold the right to purchase the said Concessions, subject only to the provisions of the 
Mining Law and its Regulations and to the respective Contracts." 

2.2 Location of Mineralization 
The Cerro Verde mineralization is completely contained within the Group 1 set of concessions, 
as illustrated in Figure 2-2. 

2.3 Royalty Agreements & Encumbrances 
CCC has informed SRK that there are no royalties or taxes for extraction of copper at the San 
Javier Project. 

No usable facilities or property improvements exist on the concessions that are directly 
applicable for the mining and processing envisioned for the project.  Access roads for 
exploration drilling were constructed by PD in support of their drilling.  These roads provide 
access to Cerro Verde and Mesa Grande and have been used by CCC in their 2006 drilling 
campaign. 

While small scale mining for silver, copper and gold in the vicinity was encouraged by the 
Mexican government, only the small underground workings at La Trinidad lie within the CCC 
concessions.   

2.4 Surface Ownership 
The surface is owned by the Ejido of San Javier.  CCC has an agreement with the Ejido for 
exploration activities. 

2.5 Permits 
Permits will be required for construction and production approval.  As of the date of this report, 
CCC has not initiated any environmental studies nor applied for any permits in support of 
development or exploitation.   

2.5.1 Required Permits & Status 
CCC, in conjunction with its consultants, has identified all permits that will or are likely to be 
required for mining.  In summary, the required permits and the issuing agencies are listed below: 

• Letter of Authorization for Construction Activities.  This is issued by Mexico's lead 
environmental review agency, Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 
(SEMARNAT), following a positive review of an Environmental Impact Evaluation and, 
if necessary, a Risk Assessment; 

• Operating License. The documentation necessary to obtain an Operating Licence is 
typically developed during the construction period; SEMARNAT;

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure & Physiography (Item 7) 

3.1 Access to Property 
The property is immediately accessible from paved Highway 16 and from the town of San Javier 
by unimproved ranch and exploration roads (Figure 2-1).   

3.2 Climate 
The climate is semi-arid with a pronounced monsoonal season from June through September and 
is extremely dry the remainder of the year.  Precipitation varies between 300 to 700mm/yr.  The 
annual temperature varies from +12oC to +35oC.  

Climate will not be factor regarding mine operations. 

3.3 Physiography 
The property topography is extremely rugged with the three deposits located on steep to very 
steep hills rising as much as 300m above the plain to the west.  The elevation of the area around 
San Javier ranges from 400 to 1,300m. 

3.4 Vegetation  
Vegetation consists primarily of relatively thick scrub with small to medium sized trees lying 
along sheltered watercourses.  The area is green during the three-month monsoon season and dry 
for the remainder of the year. 

3.5 Local Resources & Infrastructure 
The property lies between 2 and 3km from the town of San Javier, population 304.  The San 
Javier workforce is small and almost fully employed by the many small coal-mining operations 
in the immediate vicinity and cannot be considered a resource for a probable workforce.  The 
larger town of Tecoripa lies 25km west of the project area and is a source of fuel, supplies and 
labor.  However, most major supplies, including labor, will come from the capital city of 
Hermosillo. 

Despite the steep topography in the immediate vicinity of the deposits, a large gently sloped area 
lies immediately to the east that offers sites for leach pads and process facilities (Figure 3-1).  A 
small perennial stream will either be diverted to the east to control drainage in the proposed 
facility area or will be dammed to form a small reservoir.  Waste rock disposal would be largely 
incorporated as fill for ramps for access to the possible pit(s).  However, additional waste dump 
sites have been identified as shown in Figure 3-1. 

Electrical power is available from an existing line owned by the Federal Power Agency (CFE).  
The power line passes within 2km of the property and has the capacity to supply a small to 
medium sized operation. 

Approximately 2km of unpaved road leading to the project from the highway will be upgraded to 
accommodate mine traffic.

4 History (Item 8) 
4.1 Ownership 
The San Javier properties were held by Servicios Industriales Peñoles S.A. De C.V. (Peñoles) 
from the late 1960's through the mid-1970's.  Magma Copper Company (Magma) held the 
property briefly in 1994.  Minera Corner Bay (Corner Bay) held the rights from 1994 to 1999 
with Phelps Dodge (PD) being involved in a joint venture arrangement in1995-1998.   

Also in 1994, the Finnish mining company Outukumpu Oyj (Outukumpu) participated in a brief 
joint venture with Orcana Resources Ltd (Orcana) and drilled a series of nine holes at La 
Trinidad. 

4.2 Past Exploration & Development 
Exploration activity has consisted primarily of mapping and surface sampling with relatively 
minor drilling by Peñoles and PD.   

Regional work done by PD, while exploring under a joint venture agreement with Laminco 
Resources Inc. (Laminco), now Zaruma Resources Inc. (Zaruma), consisted of geological and 
geophysical studies in an area which partially overlapped the San Javier Project.  The results are 
presented in a report prepared in 2003 for Zaruma by Professor R.P. Viljoen of the Republic of 
South Africa and provides a general geological description and geological map as well as 
radiometric surveys for potassium, uranium, thorium and total magnetic field. 

The La Trinidad deposit was worked underground on a small scale.  CCC does not have the 
historic production records for La Trinidad.  The underground map prepared for Orcana in 1994 
outlines a stope of approximately 50m in length by 8m in width, however the vertical extent and 
dip of the mineralization is not shown and therefore the extracted volume cannot be calculated.  
Subsequent sampling of the underground workings was done in 1994 to test both the grade and 
the acid soluble component of the copper mineralization.   

Peñoles drilled a total of 18 core holes, of which 12 have assay results composited to interpreted 
mineralized lengths.  Unfortunately, neither the core nor the assay interval information is 
available to CCC.  These drillholes are not be usable in resource estimation, however they are 
valuable for directing additional drillhole locations and orientations.  

PD built a broad network of drill roads on Cerro Verde and to a lesser extent on Mesa Grande, 
and drilled a total of 18 core holes sampled on 2m intervals (Figure 4-1).  CCC has the assay and 
geological data for 7 of these holes and remaining core halves for the 11 drillholes for which 
assay and geological data are missing.  

CCC has undertaken a fairly aggressive campaign of both core and reverse circulation (RC) 
drilling from the available drill sites prepared by PD.  These drillholes have been arranged in a 
fan pattern to maximize coverage in all directions (Figure 4-2).  Additional sites will be needed 
for infill drilling.  CCC drilling through December 2006 consists of 57 core holes and 21 reverse 
circulation (RC) holes.  CCC's drilling program is more fully described in Sections 8 and 9. 

Assays have been performed for total copper (tCu) and 32 elements by ICP.  Assay intervals 
with tCu > 0.1.0% have been followed by sequential analysis for acid soluble and cyanide 
soluble copper to provide information on the spatial distribution of acid solubility for an SX-EW 
process.

4.3 Historic Mineral Resource Estimates 
PD prepared a resource estimate for Cerro Verde by cross sectional polygonal means using both 
Peñoles and PD drillhole results.  This resulted in an estimate of 96Mt at an average grade of 
0.28%Cu.  The basis for this estimate was not available for review by the author.  This estimate 
was not prepared according to NI 43-101 guidelines and SRK cannot verify the results. 

4.4 Historic Production 
The Mexican government encouraged small-scale mining for silver, copper, and gold in the 
vicinity, but the only production within the San Javier concessions was from small underground 
workings at La Trinidad.  No production data is available for the operation.  A map of the 
underground workings prepared for Orcana in 1994 outlines a stope of approximately 50m in 
length by 8m in width, however, the vertical extent, and dip of the mineralization is not shown 
and therefore the extracted volume cannot be calculated.

5 Geologic Setting (Item 9) 
5.1 Regional Geology 
The San Javier project lies within the Sonoran Cu-Mo-W Province which represents the 
southeastern extension of the porphyry copper province of the southwestern United States.   

The Sonoran Province is divided by the Mojave-Sonora Megashear which formed as left-lateral 
transform faults and oblique rift systems developed along a Jurassic Age volcanic arc complex of 
volcanics and basin sediments.  This structure separates Precambrian rocks which are considered 
to be of two distinct age provinces (Anderson and Silver, 1979). 

The Precambrian rock exposures in northern and eastern Sonora on the east side of the Sonoran 
Megashear consist of strongly deformed greenschist-grade volcanic and sedimentary rocks 
deposited about 1.7 Ga ago.  On the west side of the Sonoran Megashear, in northwestern 
Sonora, the Precambrian rock consists of upper-amphibolite facies intrusives, schist, and 
feldspathic gneiss, with U-Pb zircon isotope ages between 1.7 and 1.8 Ga (Anderson et al., 
1980). 

Proterozoic basement rocks are overlain by Paleozoic and Mesozoic clastic and carbonate 
sedimentary rocks which are intruded and overlain by intermediate-to-felsic Laramide igneous 
rocks.     

The region is structurally complex with Jurassic Age transform and rift faulting, Laramide Age 
compressional faulting and folding, and subsequent dissection by two or more episodes of 
extensional basin and range faulting in the Tertiary.  Dominant regional structural trends are N-S, 
NW-SE and NE-SW.   

The Sonoran Province hosts many metallic deposits including Laramide Cu-Mo porphyry 
systems and Tertiary precious metals deposits.  Prominent mineral deposits in the region include 
the major porphyry copper deposits of Cananea and La Caridad, large volcanic-hosted precious-
metal deposits throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental, and a number of other igneous-related 
and basin-related deposit (Staude et al, 2001). 

5.2 Local Geology 
Figure 5-1 illustrates the local geology of the San Javier Project.  Locally, the oldest rocks are 
the Upper Triassic Barranca Group, a 3,150m thick sequence of sandstones, conglomerates, 
siltstones, and shales with coal horizons.  The Barranca Group appears to have been deposited in 
a single east-west trending basin 110km long and 40km wide surrounded by areas of irregular 
high relief which has been interpreted to represent a paleo-rift valley system.  

The Barranca is comprised of three formations, from oldest to youngest, the 1,150m thick 
Arrayanes Formation, the 1,400m thick Santa Clara Formation, and the 600m thick Coyote 
Formation. 

The Arrayanes and Santa Clara Formations are composed of fluvial and marine-deltaic 
sandstones, conglomerates, shales and siltstones, with the Santa Clara hosting horizons of coal 
and volcanic tuffs.  The coal is mined locally in numerous small underground operations.  The 
Coyote Formation is composed of alluvial fan deposits of poorly-sorted, clast-supported pebble 
to boulder conglomerates.

Figure 5-1:  Local Geology of the San Javier Project 

 

The Barranca Group is overlain locally by the Tarahumara Formation, consisting of 
propylitically altered andesitic to dacitic lava, agglomerate, and volcanic breccia, with 
subordinate felsic pyroclastic components.  The age of the Tarahumara Formation is somewhat 
uncertain, in part due to pervasive alteration, and in part due to xenolithic inclusions.  Even so, 
ages of 73 and 70Ma, and 90 and 89Ma have been obtained from U-Pb age dating.  All of these 
ages are older than the 65 to 55Ma K-Ar and U-Pb ages for plutons of the Sonoran batholith in 
east-central Sonora determined in other studies (McDowell et al 2001). 

Rhyolitic volcanic rocks of Oligocene to Miocene Age, related to the Sierra Madre Occidental 
upper volcanic stage, overlie Laramide Age volcanics and are found in the area.

5.3 Property Geology 
Within the concessions held by CCC, outcrops consist of the Barranca Group and the 
Tarahumara Formation.  Exposures of the Barranca within the concessions include at least both 
the Santa Clara and Coyote Formations.  The copper mineralization is hosted by the Tarahumara 
formation. 

The Tarahumara Formation is a thick volcanic sequence composed mainly of massive andesite 
volcanic breccias with intercalated layers of andesite flows and volcaniclastic sandstone and 
conglomerate.  The volcanic breccias were probably deposited as laharic mudflow deposits, 
agglomerates, and avalanche debris flows.  This is evidenced by the textures, and the fact that 
bedding or other primary planar features are almost never present.  

The breccias consist of poorly-sorted, sub-angular fragments from a few millimeters to as much 
as 50 - 60cm in size.  The igneous matrix of the breccias is usually porphyritic and consists of 
altered, subhedral plagioclase phenocrysts, 1 to 4mm in size, in a groundmass consisting of small 
feldspar laths, hornblende, and magnetite-ilmenite.  

Within copper mineralized areas, much of the groundmass of mafic minerals has been 
hydrothermally altered to specular hematite.  Porphyritic flow units are nearly identical to the 
andesite breccias, but lack fragments except for areas proximal to auto-brecciated flow margins.  

Clasts in the andesitic breccias are usually volcanic in nature and consist predominantly of 
porphyritic andesite with lesser amounts of rhyolite and dacite.  Volcanic breccias in the upper 
part of the section grade downward into a lower sequence of sedimentary breccias with a more 
clastic appearing matrix, containing subrounded fragments, and a exhibiting a more polymict 
character due to the presence of clasts of underlying Barranca Group sedimentary rocks 
(quartzite, chert, and mudstone). 

While the Tarahumara Formation within the property consists primarily of andesite, more felsic, 
quartz-bearing units have been mapped at La Trinidad.  The nature of the contact between this 
felsic rock and the andesite is not clear and may be gradational, however the pervasive alteration 
and hematite staining demand close observation for valid distinctions to be made.  Exposures in a 
road cut at La Trinidad show what might be felsic feeder dikes crosscutting Barranca Group 
sedimentary rocks, although the lateral juxtaposition may also be the result of offset along 
closely spaced normal faults.   

5.3.1 Structure 
Structural trends of identical orientation (NW-SE, N-S, and NE-SW) to the regional trends are 
expressed throughout the property.  These appear to have acted as control on the location and 
orientation of brecciation and mineralization.  In addition, high-angle east-west, and low angle 
structures of varying strike bound mineralized zones in a fashion that suggests post-mineral 
offset. 

Figure 5-2 presents a preliminary map of the surface geology at Cerro Verde compiled by CCC's 
site geologist.  Surface mapping at Mesa Grande and La Trinidad is not yet sufficiently advanced 
to prepare a similar compilation from field maps.

6 Deposit Types (Item 10) 
The mineral deposits being investigated at San Javier have been identified as belonging to the 
Iron Oxide-Copper-Gold (IOCG) type.  This style of deposit has become increasingly recognized 
as more significant deposits are being discovered.  They have been broadly characterized by 
David V. Lefebure of the British Columbia Geological Survey (1995). 

A number of IOCG style deposits have been discovered in western Mexico from the Baja 
Peninsula and Sonora in the north through Sinaloa and into Narayit to the south, as well as on the 
Baja peninsula.  The occurrences in Mexico are typically associated with mafic to intermediate 
volcanics and range in age from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.  These deposits appear to 
belong to a middle Mesozoic belt of Fe-oxide (+Cu, Au) occurrences along the Cordillera 
(Barton and Johnson, 1996). 

IOCG deposits exhibit a wide range of sizes and suites of economic metal.  Recoverable metals 
may include Fe, Cu, Au, Ag, U, P and Rare Earth Elements (REE).  Polymetallic IOCG deposits, 
e.g. Fe, Cu, +Au, are generally the more valuable.  Deposits may exceed 1,000Mt grading greater 
than 20% Fe, but are more frequently in the 100 to 500Mt range.  The Olympic Dam deposit in 
Australia has estimated reserves of 2,000Mt grading 1.6% Cu, 0.06% U3O8, 3.5gpt Ag and 
0.6gpt Au.  The Ernest Henry deposit in Australia is estimated to contain 100Mt at 1.6% Cu and 
0.8g/t Au (Lefebure, D.V., 1995). 

Some of the deposits, typically hematite rich, are characterized by breccias at all scales grading  
inward from weakly fractured host rock to iron oxide matrix-supported breccia (sometimes 
heterolithic) to zones of 100% Fe oxide in the core of the brecciation zone.  

Breccia fragments are generally angular and range up to more than 10m in size, although they 
are more frequently less than 1m.  Contacts with host rocks are frequently gradational over 
centimeters to meters (Lefebure, D.V., 1995).

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

7 Mineralization (Item 11) 
Mineralization is strongly structurally controlled by both high- and low-angle faults.  Post-
mineral structural displacement is responsible for the current geometry of mineralization.   

The Tarahumara Formation exhibits pervasive propyllitic alteration throughout the property and 
beyond.  Local zones of alteration within the CCC concessions include sericitic and potassic 
alteration associated with stockworks and specularite in veins and massively replacing the 
groundmass of the brecciated andesite.  The location of the stockworks is often indicated at 
surface by locally intense bleaching of the rock.   

Cerro Verde exhibits strong structural controls with regards to both specularite replacement and 
copper mineralization.  This is consistent with the IOCG model described by Lefebure (1995) 
who lists as key characteristics: 

• Strong structural control with emplacement along faults or contacts, particularly narrow 
grabens; and 

• Hydrothermal activity on faults with extensive brecciation.  
At Cerro Verde, a large core of hydrothermally brecciated, intensely specularitized and 
sericitized andesite that is mineralized with copper is exposed. Within this core zone, specularite 
may constitute over 50% of the rock as seen in hand specimens.  Drilling indicates that this core 
zone extends as much as 200m below the surface.  The mineralized zone trends about N40oE and 
is about 1,100m long and 400m wide. 

The eastern margin of Mesa Grande exhibits similar alteration styles to Cerro Verde, although 
the dimensions of any brecciated core zone have not been yet been identified because of the 
more limited drilling and surface exposure in these areas.  La Trinidad, however, does not exhibit 
the same styles of brecciation and specularite hematite infiltration as observed at Cerro Verde 
and Mesa Grande.  The rocks at La Trinidad are intensely argillicly altered with more earthy 
hematite after pyrite, and mostly lack hydrothermal specularite breccias.  

The zones of intense alteration served as favorable hosts for copper mineralization.  There is a 
strong correlation between the degree of specularite replacement and the extent of copper 
mineralization.  

Copper sulfide mineralization, observed in deep drillholes, consists of chalcopyrite as 
disseminated blebs and micro-fracture filling.  Chalcocite is also present, and as an acid soluble 
sulfide, is more important to CCC.  Other copper sulfide minerals common to IOCG deposits, 
such as bornite, have only been observed petrographically. 

Iron alteration and copper mineralization are often found to attenuate sharply with transition 
from mineralized to un-mineralized rock occurring over the space a few meters to less than a 
meter.  Sharper boundaries have been observed which suggest structural offset.   

Nearly complete oxidation of sulfides is indicated in some drillholes to a depth of 200m from 
surface.  Weathering and sulfide oxidation are important at San Javier as the current project is 
being investigated as a potential SX-EW process.  The oxidation interface is indicated to be 
highly irregular and largely controlled by structural penetration from surface.  Drilling may not 
be sufficient to capture this surface and consideration is being given to incorporating oxide and 
sulfide distinctions into a more encompassing acid recoverability model.

Constellation Copper Corp.  7-2 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

The relatively well-drilled Cerro Verde deposit appears to be capped by 10 to 15m of leached 
rock generally barren of significant copper mineralization.  Only limited amounts of supergene 
enrichment has been indicated in drillhole sample assays, however.  This is likely due to the 
generally sulfide-poor nature of the mineralized system which, upon oxidation, failed to establish 
acid-leaching conditions sufficient to mobilize copper.  The extreme topographic contrast in the 
area may also have contributed by permitting the escape of dissolved metals to surface waters 
and thereby preventing fluid ponding; copper precipitation against a near-surface water table 
may have contributed as well.  Surface mapping at Mesa Grande suggests that similar near-
surface leaching may be present overlying the identified stockwork areas.  

Within the oxidized zone, copper mineralization exists as secondary copper oxides and 
carbonates filling both pene-contemporaneous and post-mineral fractures.  Minor disseminations 
and micro-veinlets exist within the specularite matrix probably represent sites of original sulfide 
mineralization.   

The principal copper minerals in the oxide zone are malachite, azurite, and chrysocolla.  
Chalcocite has been observed in thin section and is believed to be a common interstitial 
constituent within felted specularite where high total copper assays were returned.  The more 
visually obvious oxides, carbonates, and chalcopyrite are commonly observed in logging.  It is 
not practically possible to distinguish chalcocite from specularite in the core. 

Anomalous gold mineralization, sometimes exceeding 1ppm, has been found in multi-element 
analyses done on core samples.   CCC does not consider gold mineralization to be potentially 
important for the project, due primarily to the envisaged process route for copper that would 
preclude gold recovery. 

Uranium and rare earth elements are commonly associated with IOCG deposits.  Regional 
airborne radiometrics done by PD have indicated the presence of anomalous uranium in some 
areas, consistent with other IOCG deposits.  However, these anomalies lie outside of the 
concessions held by Constellation.  Uranium is regarded by the Mexican government as a 
strategic element and its presence in potentially economic amounts may deter independent 
development for other metals.

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

8 Exploration (Item 12) 
CCC's current exploration program consists of: 

• Surface mapping and field analysis using Niton portable X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) 
multi-element element analysis;  

• Diamond core and RC drilling; and 

• Re-examination and re-analysis of existing core from previous lease holders. 
The drilling program includes sampling the drillholes on 3m intervals and analysis for total 
copper and sequential analyses for acid soluble and cyanide soluble copper to provide an 
indication of potential SX-EW process recoverability.   

The acid soluble assay indicates the proportion of copper oxides, carbonates and silicates easily 
dissolved in sulfuric acid.  The cyanide soluble analysis indicates the proportion of copper 
resident as other copper minerals, primarily chalcocite, that are not easily dissolved in the 
laboratory, but which would be amenable to the SX-EW process.  

A multi-element analysis is also done as part of the total copper analysis process. 

During the logging of the core and chip samples, a NITON portable XRF analyzer is used to 
provide an early indication of copper mineralization.  This analysis is indicative only and the 
results are not intended to be used for any quantitative purpose.  

Five petrographic slides have been studied by Petrographic Consultants International (PCI) on 
core samples which have been selected based on the relationship between the sequential analysis 
results to better understand the underlying mineralogical relationship with recovery. 

In addition, CCC is preparing bulk metallurgical samples from core for column testing to 
determine the amenability of the mineralization to acid leaching 

As of the date of this report, a near surface, contiguous body of copper oxide mineralization has 
been identified at Cerro Verde.  Significant copper oxide mineralization has been found in 
drillholes at Mesa Grande; however, the boundaries and extent of this mineralization have not 
yet been defined.  A smaller contiguous body of copper oxide mineralization has been indicated 
by historical work at La Trinidad.  CCC has not yet undertaken any systematic verification of the 
mineralization. 

CCC is conducting their entire exploration program directly, using contract drilling and a 
commercial laboratory.  The contracted core drilling company is Major Drilling de México S.A. 
de C.V. (Major), the reverse circulation (RC) drilling is conducted by Layne de México S.A. de 
C.V. (Layne) and the laboratory is International Plasma Laboratory Inc. (IPL) in Richmond, 
British Columbia, Canada and its contracted sample preparation laboratory, Sonora Sample 
Preparation Laboratory (SSP).  A significant proportion of the historical data, primarily the core 
drilling done by Peñoles at Cerro Verde, are only usable as exploration guides and are not be 
usable for resource estimation.  A proportion of the Phelps Dodge drilling can be used following 
re-logging and re-analysis of the remaining core, as well as the seven holes for which reliable 
assays are available.  The Orcana/Otukumpu drilling at La Trinidad is expected to be usable 
pending re-logging and re-analysis of the remaining core.

CCC commissioned Cooper Aerial Surveys Co. (Cooper) to conduct an aerial survey of the area 
to produce topographic data of the concessions and areas outside the current exploitation rights 
to plan for potential mine facilities.  This work has been completed and is incorporated into the 
resource model. 

It is the SRK's opinion that the work done to date by CCC is well conceived and has been 
executed to industry standards.  The drilling procedures are more fully discussed in Section 9.

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

9 Drilling (Item 13) 
Several historic drilling campaigns have been undertaken on the San Javier targets by a number 
of previous leaseholders.  Some of the information from these campaigns serves as general 
guides to CCC in focusing their present and planned efforts, as neither the original assay 
information nor the remaining core are available.     

There were a total of 18 core holes drilled by PD during their tenure on the property.  All PD 
drilling was HQ (63.5mm) sampled on nominal 2m intervals.  Drillholes 1 through 7 from the 
PD drilling campaign have assays on 2m intervals with geologic logging; the remaining half core 
of these holes no longer exists.  No assay or geologic logs exist for drillholes 8 through 18 from 
the PD campaign; however, complete core halves for these holes exist and are in CCC's 
possession.  CCC plans to re-log and re-assay these holes for inclusion in the drillhole database.  
These holes will be sampled on a 3m interval by CCC to correspond to their current sample 
spacing.  Analysis will include the same total copper, sequential copper, and multi-element 
analyses currently being done by CCC on their drillhole samples.  To date, two of the holes have 
been re-assayed and are included in the database; both are outside the Cerro Verde area.   

CCC also possesses the core halves from the nine drillholes done by Orcana/Otukumpu at La 
Trinidad.  This core will be re-assayed and re-logged for incorporation into the database. 

9.1 CCC Drilling 
CCC completed a total of 57 HQ core and 21 (RC) drillholes in the 2006 drilling campaign.  
Core drilling is ongoing in 2007.  Table 9.1.1 lists the holes drilled by PD and CCC on the San 
Javier Property and the locations are shown in Figure 9-1.  Appendix B is a complete listing of 
the drillholes.

CCC drilling has been hampered by the difficult terrain and most of the drilling has been done 
from sites prepared by PD.  The drilling consists of fan arrays that include a vertical hole and 1 
or more angled holes drilled from a single site. A back sight and front sight are set out to align 
the drill rig in the proper orientation; the angle of the hole is set up by the driller and checked by 
the geologist.  The spacing of the collars is irregular, and varies from about 70 to 250m.   

The core drilling is conducted by Major using HQ sized tools and the RC drilling was done by 
Layne, using a 13.34cm hammer bit.  The RC drilling was drilled on a dry basis; the sample was 
directed through a cyclone and then into a 3 tier Jones splitter, collecting a 1/16 sample, or about 
6kg.

Constellation Copper Corp.  9-4 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

The drill collars are surveyed by a contracted professional surveyor from Hermosillo, using a 
stationary GPS base station and subsequent triangulations of drillholes with an accuracy of 0.1m.  
None of the holes has been surveyed for downhole deviation.  The average depth of the CCC 
holes is about 180m and the deviation should not be significant for holes of this depth.   

Core and RC samples are collected at the drill rig by CCC personnel and transported to a 
dedicated sample handling facility in San Javier.  The core and RC chips are logged by the 
project geologist with a broad spectrum of lithological, structural, mineralogical, structural and 
alteration-associated observations.   

After logging of the core by the geologist, the core is sawn at the core facility and one-half of the 
core is placed in plastic sample bags for transport to SSP in Hermosillo for sample preparation.  
The remaining core halves are replaced in their respective locations in the core boxes and stored 
on steel shelves at the core facility in San Javier. 

The rock at San Javier is uniformly massive and core recovery is generally very good.  
Approximately 95% of the core samples have 75% or greater recovery, while 87% have 90% 
recovery or greater.   

The mineralization is disseminated and not confined to a single horizon and thus, the relationship 
between drillhole intersection and true thickness is not relevant in this situation.  The drillholes 
generally penetrate the mineralized material and occasionally bottom in the Barranca Formation.  
The drilling at Cerro Verde covers an area of about 1,200m x 500m, elongate in the northeast 
direction. 

A drillhole location map is shown in Figure 9-1 and an east-west cross-section and a north-
section are shown in figures 9-2 and 9-3.

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

10 Sampling Method & Approach (Item 14) 
10.1 Sampling Method 
Core and RC samples are collected at the drill rig by CCC personnel and transported to a 
dedicated sample handling facility in San Javier where the core is photographed.  The project 
geologists log the core and chips for lithologic characteristics and the core is logged for such 
geotechnical qualities as core recovery, rock quality determination (RQD), and rock mass rating 
(RMR).   

After logging is complete, the geologist marks the sample intervals on the core; the sample 
intervals are 3m unless there is a geological reason to change the length.  The core is sawn 
lengthwise and one-half of the core is placed in plastic sample bags for transport to SSP in 
Hermosillo for sample preparation.  The remaining core halves are replaced in their respective 
locations in the core boxes and stored on steel shelves at the core facility in San Javier.  The RC 
samples are collected at the drill by the drilling contractor under supervision of CCC.  A three 
tier Jones splitter is placed directly under the cyclone, resulting in a 1/16 split of the 3m sample.  
The sample bags are pre-marked with the drillhole ID and drill interval. 

The samples are picked up by at the sample facility by SSP personnel or contractor. 

10.2 Sample Location 
The drilling has been done from sites on existing roads.  The spacing of the collars is irregular, 
and varies from about 70 to 250m (Figure 9-1).  CCC has tried to maximize the use of the sites 
by fan drilling with the layout generally consisting of one or more inclined holes and a vertical 
hole.  The spacing of the samples therefore varies considerably with depth.  The area covered by 
the drilling is several hundred hectares over a length of 1,200m and a width of 500m and the 
samples are distributed throughout that area, although the sample distance is quite variable. 

10.3 Sample Quality 
Given the nature of the mineralization in the oxidized zone and the hardness and solubility 
contrast between the country rock and oxide copper minerals there is potential for loss of 
mineralization or upgrading in RC drillhole samples.  This potential will be especially present in 
wet holes, and logs should carefully note the presence and location of any water table.  To date, 
no water has been encountered in any of the drillholes and there is no evidence that the RC 
samples have undergone the loss or upgrading of mineralization described above. 

There are 5,835 samples in the drillhole database, including all the CCC holes and those PD 
holes for which there are assays.  In the Cerro Verde resource area there are 5,486 samples.  The 
length of the PD samples is 2m and the length of the CCC samples is 3m.  The sample interval is 
appropriate for the massive type of mineralization. 

The rock at San Javier is uniformly massive and core recovery is generally very good.  
Approximately 95% of the core samples have 75% or greater recovery, while 87% have 90% 
recovery or greater.  Core recovery in the database is calculated in a spreadsheet and shows some 
evidence of instances of typographical errors in the recovered length column which should be 
checked. 

Drilling methods and orientations of drillholes are appropriate for the topography and 
mineralization.  The sampling and on-site sample handling of the core was observed by SRK and

was performed to industry standards and no biases are anticipated due to the sampling method.  
SRK did not observe the RC drilling as it was not being used at the time of the site visit.  SRK 
also did not visit SSP or the IPL lab and cannot form an opinion of their adherence to official 
procedures, but notes that IPL is an accredited laboratory.  SRK did not observe any negative 
factors that might affect the accuracy or reliability of the results.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses & Security   
(Item 15) 

The sample preparation on site is limited to sawing of the core in the case of core drilling and 
splitting of the sample in the case of RC drilling.  All other sample preparation is performed by 
the independent laboratory, IPL and its contractor, SSP.  The core sawing is done under the 
supervision of the site geologist by local employees of the company.  The RC sample splitting 
and collection is done by the driller's assistant. 

The author does not believe that any aspect of the sample preparation was conducted by an 
officer, director, or associate of CCC. 

11.1 Sample Security 
Core and RC samples are transported to CCC's sample and core housing center in San Javier by 
CCC employees.  This facility is an enclosed and partially roofed courtyard with access by way 
of a locking gate to the rear and a lockable door to the front. 

The samples from core halves are prepared for shipping to SSP in Hermosillo at this facility.  
The samples are transported from San Javier to Hermosillo by employees or contractors of SSP. 

Results from the analyses are transmitted by email directly to CCC's office in Denver, and as 
signed paper assay certificates. 

11.2 Sample Preparation & Assaying 
The SSP facility at Hermosillo prepares a pulp and forwards this on to IPL in the Vancouver area 
for assay.  Figure 11-1 is a sample preparation and analysis flowsheet as used at the prep facility.  
The sample is crushed to -10 mesh and then riffle split to a 250g sample with the remainder 
retained as coarse reject.  The 250g sample is pulverized to -150 mesh, packaged, and sent to IPL 
for analysis.  A split of the 250g pulverized sample is retained by SSP. 

IPL is officially registered with and certified by the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and 
Parks (BCMOE) and the Canadian Association for Environmental Analytical Laboratories 
(CAEAL); it also has ISO9001:2000 certification.  IPL's analytical procedures comply with the 
applicable requirements of the BCMOE, Environment Canada, American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM), American Water Works Association (AWWA) and United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 

IPL's analysis consists of 4 acid digestion of the sample with total copper analyzed by Atomic 
Absorption (AA) and a 32-element ICP package.  Samples that return a total copper value greater 
than 0.1% undergo a sequential digestion copper analysis of acid soluble copper, cyanide soluble 
copper and residual copper.  These measures correspond closely to the proportion of 
oxide/carbonate, secondary chalcocite, and primary sulfide proportions of the total Cu 
mineralization.  The total of acid soluble and cyanide soluble components approximate the 
proportion of Cu that may be anticipated to be recoverable under commercial heap leach 
conditions.

11.3 QA/QC 
A laboratory Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program is in place at San Javier, 
consisting of a regular program of duplicate pulp analyses, blind inclusion of standards and 
blanks by CCC, and re-assay of pulps by IPL for internal checking. 

Pulp Duplicates 
The samples intervals chosen for duplicate pulps were based on set intervals for each hole.  The 
samples for the core duplicates were prepared by sawing one-half the core into 2 separate 
samples, resulting in 2 samples of one-quarter core each.  In the case of the RC samples, two 
samples were collected at the drill rig and submitted to the lab.     

This has implications for variability in each case, with the core duplicates introducing an 
expectation for higher variability for the samples selected for duplicates, while the variability for 
the RC samples should be consistent with the total RC sample database.

Constellation Copper Corp.  11-3 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

SRK notes that a better procedure would be to randomly select the intervals for duplicate pulp 
preparation and that the samples be submitted with blind sample numbers to the laboratory.  To 
date, 206 pulp duplicates from 5452 assay intervals have been analyzed for total copper.  These 
duplicates demonstrate a correlation coefficient of 89% for all data and 96% with the removal of 
1 obvious outlier.  Half absolute relative difference (HARD) analysis of the pulp duplicates 
reveals that 80% of the duplicates show less than 14.3% relative difference from the original 
assay values, while 90% show less than 20.6% relative difference (Figure 11-2).  Figure 11-3 is a 
scatter plot of tCu in the pulp duplicate versus tCu in the original sample. These results confirm a 
level of reproducibility acceptable for resource estimation.

In addition 92 pulp duplicates have been run for acid soluble, cyanide soluble and residual 
copper.  These exhibit correlation coefficients of 96%, 95%, and 94% respectively for all of the 
duplicates.  HARD analyses show that 80% of the samples show less than 14.3%, 20%, and 
15.6% relative difference, respectively, and that 90% of the samples show less than 27%, 33%,

and 22% relative difference, respectively.  In part, the lower reproducibility is due to the smaller 
data set, but some component will be due the higher inherent variability of the value being tested. 

Standard Samples 
The standards program requires improvement.  Too many standards have been used in the 
program so far and the total numbers of analyses for each are too small for statistically valid 
analysis Figure 11-4).  In addition, the standard samples were prepared from material taken from 
another CCC mine so that none of the standards is from San Javier itself.  That said, the IPL 
standards exhibit excellent reproducibility with variation of no more than 0.01% from the 
accepted value in 16 samples analyzed.

12 Data Verification (Item 16) 
The drilling database is compiled directly from spreadsheets sent from IPL to CCC's Denver 
office, thus eliminating the errors associated with manual data input.   

SRK compared the database assays and the IPL assay certificates of 10 drillholes from the 
database of 97 holes.  The following errors were found: 

• Values below detection limit for acid soluble copper, cyanide soluble copper and residual 
copper were not recorded in the database for 8 of the 10 holes; 

• Iron values in 2 holes were not recorded in the database; and 

• Total copper below detection limit was not recorded for 1 hole. 
Values below detection limit should be given a value, typically one-half of the detection limit.  If 
the value is not recorded, then it is usually treated as not assayed and is ignored in the estimation 
process.   

The pulp duplicates were averaged in the database.  Although this is not incorrect, the more 
common method is to record the first value and then use the second in a QA/QC analysis.  There 
were no other significant errors found in the database.  

SRK suggests that CCC should thoroughly review its database for consistency in recording of 
values below detection limit and for inclusion of all variables used in the resource estimation, 
calculation of specific gravity, and copper recovery.  SRK also notes that these errors would not 
have a significant impact on the resource estimation provided in this report. 

No independent samples from existing core were taken for analysis by SRK because the copper 
oxide mineralization is visible at hand specimen scale.

13 Adjacent Properties (Item 17) 
Numerous small-scale deposits adjacent to the concessions have been exploited in the past.  
These operations were subsidized by the Mexican Government by construction in the 1950's of a 
small flotation mill in the valley east of Cerro Verde for treating sulfide-based metal ores. 

No production records are available that present tonnes and grade of the material mined.  For the 
most part, these deposits were small narrow-vein precious metal deposits hosted in the Barranca 
Group sediments, and are therefore unrelated to the deposit style being investigated at San Javier 
by CCC.

14 Mineral Processing & Metallurgical Testing 
(Item 18) 

The metallurgical test work for San Javier is preliminary at this stage which is consistent with the 
project level.  CCC had sequential digestion analyses done on samples where tCu was greater 
than 0.1% in the original assay.  This analysis is fundamentally a metallurgical test which 
quantifies the proportion of copper that would be recoverable under SX-EW process.  The 
theoretical recovery is obtained by adding acid soluble copper and cyanide soluble copper and 
dividing the result by the total copper.  The principal advantage of this test is that it establishes 
metallurgical characteristics at the scale of individual drillhole assay intervals.  

In addition to the sequential digestion analyses, a total of 37 48-hour bottle roll tests on 
pulverized material were completed in March 2007.  Four were bulk samples taken at the surface 
and 33 were composites assembled from core.  The samples were selected by CCC in 
conjunction with their metallurgical consultant, Process Engineering, LLC.  The samples were 
prepared by SSP and the test work was conducted by Metcon Research of Tucson, AZ.   

The bulk samples ranged in grade from 0.41% to 2.81% tCu and the core composites ranged 
from 0.13 to 1.28% tCu.  In general, the bottle roll test recoveries correlated well with the 
recoveries calculated from the sequential digestion assay.  The results are shown in Figure 14-1.

Figure 14-1:  Comparison of Bottle Roll Tests and Recoveries Calculated from Sequential 
Copper Analysis 
 

While the results of the bottle roll tests versus the results of the sequential assays is generally 
good, one should note that the bottle roll tests do not extract the copper in chalcocite like the 
cyanide soluble step would in a sequential copper assay.  So, for those samples with a significant 
amount of copper that shows up in the cyanide step, the bottle roll results will report a lower 
copper extraction than what might be indicated by the sequential assays. 

In addition, several column tests were initiated in 2007, however results will not be available for 
several months.

15 Mineral Resources & Reserves (Item 19) 
CCC has completed a resource estimation for the Cerro Verde portion of the San Javier Project, 
using Techbase software.  The database includes all drilling completed through December 31, 
2006; the resource estimate was completed as of March 31, 2007.  The general approach for 
grade estimation was to define a grade shell using indicator kriging at a cut-off of 0.10% total 
copper (tCu).  Grades were estimated inside the grade shell, using only composites inside the 
grade shell.  All blocks were considered to be Inferred for this report.   

The resources are reported within a pit shell developed by CCC, using a floating cone algorithm.  
The mining and process costs are consistent with a large-scale open pit heap leach SX-EW 
operation in Mexico.  The Cu price used was $2.40/lb and the recovery was based on the ratio 
between the sum of acid and cyanide soluble copper and total copper. 

SRK has reviewed the database, the estimation parameters, and grade estimation results and has 
validated the model by visual comparison of the composite grades to the block model grade and 
by construction of swath plots comparing composite and block grades. 

15.1 Resource Database 
The database for the San Javier Project was furnished to SRK as a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet 
consisting of four worksheets with the following information: 

• Collars and orientations – dhid, easting, northing, elevation, total depth, azimuth, and 
inclination; 

• Assays – dhid, from, to, total copper(%), acid soluble copper(%), cyanide soluble 
copper(%), residual copper(%), copper solubility(%), acid consumption(kg/t), and 
iron(%); 

• Composites – dhid, from, to, mid-x, mid-y, mid-z, total copper(%), acid soluble 
copper(%), cyanide soluble copper(%), copper recovery(%), acid consumption(kg/t), 
iron(%), indicator, and estimated indicator; and 

• Block model data – midx, midy, midz, total copper(%), SG, tonnes, copper indicator, 
copper recovery(%), Fe(%), recovered Cu(%), various economic values. 

The resource database used for the Cerro Verde estimation is a subset of the entire drillhole 
database described in Section 9; a summary is presented in Table 15.1.1 and the drillholes are 
illustrated in Figure 15-1.

The drillholes are spaced on a nominal 100m x 100m grid at the collars.  The holes have been 
drilled in fans to make maximum use of the existing drill pads.  The distance between the holes 
therefore ranges from a few meters at the collar to 100m at depth.   

The resource database contains values for total Cu, acid soluble Cu, cyanide soluble Cu, residual

15.2 Specific Gravity 
It was anticipated that specularite would play a major role in local SG values; consequently, an 
approach for developing SG from an Fe% grade model was developed.  A suite of 100 assay 
intervals were selected that had broad representivity with respect to geographic distribution in 
the deposit and Fe and tCu content.  These samples were submitted to IPL for SG analysis by the

Le Chatelier method.  The results confirmed the expectation of the relationship between SG and 
Fe with a high degree of correlation.   

The resulting distribution was analyzed and a conditional relationship established based on the 
Multiple Multiplicative Factor (MMF) model (Figure 15-3) which exhibited the best fit with the 
data and expresses the sigmoidal characteristics that would be expected with SG asymptotic to 
propylitzed andesite on the low end and asymptotic to pure specularite on the high end. The 
equation for calculating SG was derived from the MMF model and is presented below.

15.3 Topography 
Initial topography at the site was at a relatively low resolution and drillhole collars were located 
by GPS only.  Locational errors between drillhole collars and topography ranged from 0 to 
120m.  CCC commissioned an aerial survey of topography and a resurvey of collar locations 
which was carried out in December 2006 by Cooper.  The new topography is much improved 
with a resolution of + 2m.  The drillhole collars are generally in very good agreement with 
topography with the exception of several holes that appeared correct in northing and easting but 
incorrect with respect to elevation.  The elevations of these holes were adjusted to match 
topography. 

15.4 Block Model 
A block model was constructed with the block size of 15m square in plan view and 10m high.  
The coordinates of the model are shown below:  

• East:  22807.5 to 24022.5; 

• North:  60007.5 to 61612; and 

• Elevation:  565 to 1065. 
The block dimensions in X and Y are generally too small for the current data spacing, resulting 
in an average number of block numbers between samples of approximately five and a maximum 
of approximately seven.  Small blocks relative to data spacing will result in significant over-
smoothing and poor local estimation for the majority of blocks.  However, the size selected is 
convenient for mine simulation and preliminary production scheduling, and will be more 
appropriate for the anticipated sample spacing once infill drilling is completed with an average 
number of blocks between samples of less than three. 

15.5 Geologic Model 
The mineralization is hosted in the volcanic breccias and flows of the Tarahumara Formation.  
The drillholes generally do not penetrate the contact with the underlying Barranca Formation.  
The geological model used in this estimation is based on the characteristics of a structurally-
controlled IOCG deposit having mineralized zones associated with breccia and stockwork 
development.  The width of the stockwork and breccias range from a few 10's of meters to over 
200m.  The primary structural orientation indicated by brecciation and specularite mineralization 
appears to be north-northeast and subvertical, however a strong secondary orientation trending 
northwest appears to be a significant, if not the primary, control on copper mineralization.   

The sparse drilling combined with widely varied drillhole orientation precludes development of a 
deterministic model for controlling grade estimation.  For this reason, a probabilistic approach 
was taken to define volumes representing significant mineralization.  The procedure used an 
indicator at 0.1% copper to define the mineralized blocks and is described more fully in the 
grade estimation section below. 

15.6 Compositing 
The drillholes were composited on 5m intervals starting at the top of the hole; if the last interval 
at the bottom of the hole was less than 5m in length it was excluded from the composite file.  A 
histogram of all total copper composites is shown in Figure 15-4 and the statistics are given in

15.7 Resource Estimation 
The resource estimation procedure is a two-step process of indicator kriging to define a grade 
shell and then ordinary kriging within the shell to assign grade to the blocks.  

15.7.1 Indicator Estimation 
This type of estimation first separates the composite data into higher grade and lower grade 
groups based on an appropriate cut off value. These two data groups are used to flag blocks in 

SRK Consulting (US), Inc.  June 01, 2007 
San Javier.NI 43-101.162304.MA.05.doc  



Constellation Copper Corp.  15-8 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

the model based on their proximity to the higher or lower grade composites. Once this is 
achieved all the higher-grade blocks are estimated using only the higher-grade composites and 
lower grade blocks estimated using the lower grade composites. This technique precludes the 
necessity of manually creating very complex grade shells to control grade assignment. 

For the San Javier data, a range of indicator values were examined ranging from 0.05% tCu to 
0.30% tCu. The 0.1% tCu indicator value was selected based on examination of down-hole grade 
profiles and variance contour plots.  The first step was to flag all of the composites below 0.1% 
with a value of 0 and those above with a value of 1.  This procedure effectively subdivides the 
composites into upper and lower grade data sets.  Variograms were constructed on the indicator 
values in order to determine appropriate search directions and ranges for the indicator model.   
Figure 15-6 shows the directional variograms for the 0.1% indicator value.

The composite indicator values were then kriged to the blocks using the following parameters: 

• Major axis:  90m at 00, N135E; 

• Semi-major axis:  67m at 90, N45E; 

• Minor axis:  45m at 00, N45E; and 

• Minimum/Maximum composites:  6/36. 
The kriging produced a range of values between 0.00 and 1.00 for each block meeting the search 
criteria.  Sections were plotted and examined for correspondence between specific indicator 
threshold values and composite values in drillholes in order to select the value to use for defining 
the probability cloud.  Visual examination is complicated by the pyramidal drillhole fans, and on 
any given section examples of conflicting values can be found.  Consequently, an alternative 
approach was developed that compared the indicator estimates directly to the drillhole 
composites as described below. 

The block values were back loaded to the composites, assigning to each composite the estimated 
indicator value from the block closest to that composite.  The composites were dumped to a 
spreadsheet.  Columns were established that tallied the positive errors (i.e. indicator estimates 
above a threshold that should have been below) and negative errors (i.e. indicator estimates 
below a threshold that should have been above).  These were based on a single variable that 
specified a given threshold indicator estimate value.  This variable was varied for each indicator 
until the positive and negative errors balanced.  This returned an indicator value for block 
selection that is more defensible than the visual examination approach originally attempted.  The 
selected block indicator threshold value was 0.48, which showed 158 positive errors and 157 
negative errors. 

Having made the value selection, the blocks available to receive a grade estimate were thus 
defined, i.e. those having a value at or above the selected threshold, as were the composites to be 
used, i.e. those having the back loaded block indicator value above the determined threshold.   

Using the composites having the back loaded indicator values results in a loss of some 
composites above the tCu values on which the indicators are based, and inclusion of others 
below the tCu values as well.  This approach is analogous using a wireframe to define the 
volumes for estimation and select data for estimation: there would be the loss of composites 
above the cutoff that lay outside the envelope, and inclusion of composites below the cutoff 
within. 

The results were examined in plan and section and good agreement was found between the 
selected threshold values and drillholes.  Examination of these sections reveals a few gaps 
between widely spaced drillholes in regions strongly indicated to be mineralized.  

Table 15.7.1.1 summarizes the tCu composites within the 0.10% grade shell resulting from the 
indicator kriging run.  Figure 15-7 is a histogram and cumulative frequency chart of the data.

Copper Estimation 
Interpretable directional variograms are not yet possible for the total Cu value.  Consequently, 
the global variogram for total copper was used to estimate total Cu within the blocks identified as 
eligible for estimation.  This global variogram (Figure 15-8) has a range of 100m, which insured

that any block eligible to receive an estimate by being above the selected indicator threshold did 
so.  Conversely, limiting the blocks eligible to receive an estimate by use of the indicators, 
removed the opportunity for over-extrapolation.

The tCu values were then kriged to the blocks using the following parameters: 

• Major, semi-major and minor axes:  100m at 90, N00E; and 

• Minimum/Maximum composites:  2/12. 
No detailed analysis for grade capping was done; however, only 6% of the metal resides in 
blocks having estimates > 1.0% tCu.  Of the 1,628 composites used in estimation, 72 were above 
1.0% tCu, which equates to 6% of the metal deriving from 4.4% of the data.  This simple 
analysis strongly suggests that outliers are not an issue.  

CCC did not estimate tCu in blocks that were below the indicator threshold in this estimation.  
SRK suggests that this should be done in future estimations.   

The mean grade of the block estimates above a 0.1% tCu is 0.340%.  This is nearly an exact 
agreement of the mean grade of all composites used in estimation of 0.338% tCu, with a 
difference of only 0.59%.   This metric, while comparing a naive statistic against one informed 
by spatial distribution relative to the variograms, is nonetheless strongly indicative of an 
unbiased overall estimate. 

Cross-sections of the block grades, corresponding to the cross-sections of the drillholes shown in 
Figures 9-3 and 9-4, are shown in Figures 15-9 and 15-10.

Copper Recovery Estimation 
The value for Cu recovery was calculated in the composites according to the formula: 

 Cu Recovery  = ((Acid sol. Cu + CN sol. Cu)/ tCu) 
This value was then kriged in estimation.  In general this approach is less than optimal, and 
ideally acid soluble and cyanide soluble Cu will be estimated separately with Cu recovery being 
calculated in the block model from the three separate estimates.  There is no direct correlation 
between acid soluble Cu which derives from Cu oxides and carbonates and cyanide soluble Cu 
which derives from chalcocite.   

The results were examined in plan and section and despite shortcomings of the approach, were 
found to agree well with drillhole data and expectations of the geometry of Cu recovery. 

Fe and SG Estimation   
Fe was estimated into the model to use in assigning SG to the individual blocks.  Fe and SG are 
highly correlated as described in Section 15.2.  Fe estimation was not constrained by the 
indicator envelopes as the SG of waste is as important as the SG of ore, and the imperfect 
correspondence between specularite breccia and Cu mineralization. The variance of Fe% was 
examined and well-structured directional variograms were developed which formed the basis for 
estimation.  

The blocks were then assigned an SG value based on the Fe grade and the equation shown in 
Section 15.2.  The Le Chatelier SG approach is done on pulps and consequently represents a 
maximum value without consideration of natural void space in the rock.  In general, the rock 
mass at San Javier is very compact and tight; however, a 3% downgrade factor was applied to 
account for fracture voids 

15.7.3   Model Validation 
SRK model validation consisted of: 

• Confirmation of assay and composite statistics; 

• Compositing the database to compare to the CCC composites; 

• Variogram checks; 

• Review of estimation procedures and parameters; 

• Visual examination of composite and block grades in cross-section and plan views; and 

• Swath plots of the tCu grades by easting, northing and elevation (Figures 15-11 through 
15-13). 

SRK's validation procedures confirmed the validity of the resource estimation, but notes that the 
block grades are slightly higher than the composite grades in the three swath plots.

15.8 Mineral Resource Statement 
The entire resource is classified as inferred due to the wide spaced drilling and the preliminary 
nature of the metallurgical testwork. 

To produce a resource statement, CCC conducted a floating cone analysis using economic 
parameters consistent with large-scale open pit mining in Mexico and Cu SX-EW process.  The 
parameters are presented below in the context of a cut-off calculation based upon recoverable Cu 
grade.  Recoverable copper is the ration between the sum of acid soluble Cu and cyanade soluble 
Cu divided by tCu.  CCC and SRK have not yet developed costs that would apply specifically to 
the San Javier deposit but the costs used in this statement of inferred resources are reasonable.

The results were reported within the raw pit, no access design was done.  In light of the current 
over-smoothing of grade, no modifying factors for ore loss or dilution were applied. 

The total resource for the Cerro Verde deposit is 81 Mt at 0.35% tCu, containing 629M lbs of 
copper (Table 15.8.2).  The entire resource is classified as inferred.

San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

17 Interpretation & Conclusions (Item 21) 
 The San Javier Project consists of an early stage development project at Cerro Verde and 
exploration targets at La Trinidad and Mesa Grande.  A significant body of near-surface, 
contiguous oxide copper mineralization has been delineated at Cerro Verde. This report contains 
a mineral resource estimation for the Cerro Verde deposit, which is entirely inferred at this stage 
of development.  Exploration at the project is on-going. 

The drilling that forms the basis of the resource database consists of fans of core and RC holes 
with collars spaced at about 100m.  The sample spacing therefore has a wide variability.  The 
drill program that is in progress is designed to reduce the sample spacing and thereby increase 
the knowledge of geologic controls on mineralization. 

The assaying has been conducted by a certified laboratory and a program of laboratory QA/QC 
has been instituted.  CCC recognizes that come improvements could be made to the QA/QC 
procedures, particularly with the standard samples. 

Data verification procedures have revealed some inconsistencies in recording values below 
detection limit.  However, no errors were found in recording values above detection limit.  SRK 
considers the database reliable for use in this resource estimation. 

The resource estimation has been conducted within industry standards and has been validated by 
SRK.

18 Recommendations (Item 22) 
SRK recommends that CCC review the database and correct the inconsistencies regarding the 
recording values below detection limit. 

Further metallurgical testwork should be done on the property.  SRK acknowledges that CCC 
has column tests in progress that will help in establishing metallurgical recoveries. 

Significant mineralization has been delineated at Cerro Grande.  SRK recommends that CCC 
continue drilling and initiate a preliminary assessment on the project.

20 Glossary 
20.1 Mineral Resources & Reserves 
Mineral Resources 
The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (August 2000).  
Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the 
Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated 
Resources as defined below.   

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 

Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined.

Constellation Copper Corp.  20-2 
San Javier   NI 43-101 Technical Report 

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.
