TECHNICAL REPORT 
ARIZONA LODE PROPERTIES 

Yavapai County, Arizona 
ALLIANCE MINING CORP. 

 

SUMMARY 
 

Technical report describing all of their properties in central Arizona. The purpose of the report 
is to compile all information in one report and to provide direction for future exploration. 
 
The author visited the subject properties on February 21 and 22, 2011.  During this time a heavy 
snowfall occurred in the Prescott area.  Despite this, a helicopter was used to visit the outlying 
properties not accessible by road because of snow cover. The author was accompanied by Jan 
Ross, President of Alliance. 
 
The property comprises 199 claims in four separate areas covering approximately 4111 acres 
north and south of Highway 89 between Prescott and Congress Arizona, in an area with 
numerous old copper and gold mines and prospects.  
 
Alliance has completed a number of preliminary sampling programs on some of the properties, 
with previous Technical reports filed on SEDAR by the late Ron Wells, P.Geo. and by Craig 
Parkinson PG.  
 
The State of Arizona has produced approximately 14 million ounces of gold historically from 

-sized mines, and in 1965 ranked 
eighth among gold producing states. The county of Yavapai is particularly well endowed with 
numerous small gold (past productive) mines and a variety of copper deposits, primarily of 
volcanogenic affiliation but also in breccia pipes with porphyry affiliation. 
 
Since 1980 there has been a significant decline in gold production, probably related to low 
metal prices (gold and copper) and a political climate that was unfavorable towards mining, and 
it is not believe that there is a single operating gold mine in Arizona at the present time.  
Recently, these factors have seen major improvements and there has been renewed interest in 

 
 
In the late 1800s, the Placerita gold mining camp, which includes the area covered by the 
Placerita Properties, was a small Spanish community and the miners worked placer and gold 
quartz-oxide veins. There are numerous shallow underground workings dating from this period, 
including adits, shafts, and remnants of small mills and a crushing plant.  The four Placerita 
areas named Placerita North, South, West and East include the old prospects known as Boston

Arizona, Gold Hill, Gold Pit, Gold Eagle, Gold Chest, Gold Spring, Gold Bug and Gold Beetle, 
Silver Crown, Trails End Mine and Bodie mine. 
 
In early 2011, Alliance completed an airborne geophysical survey program over the Copper Hill 
(Boston Arizona) area adjacent to the past productive Copper Basin area now being 
rehabilitated by Freeport McMoran.  A separate survey was completed over the Silver Crown 
and Placerita South claims adjacent to the past productive Zonia mine, which has been 
described as a porphyry copper deposit but which is actually a sheared volcanogenic feeder 
zone.  Both surveys outlined anomalous magnetics and electromagnetic anomalies which need 
to be examined in more detail, preferably by a geophysicist.  An initial examination of both 
areas has now been completed by Brian Beck PG, consulting geologist for Alliance. 
 
The author has compiled considerable historical material and combined with the previous work 
done by Alliance, additional work recommended is compilation, geological mapping , target 
generation and comprehensive exploration programs on the two key areas, Copper Hill 
(Placerita West) and Silver Crown (Placerita South).  Some of the lower priority properties with 
gold targets and drill permits in place may be suitable for farming out to other junior 
companies. 
 
A budget of $750,000, including contingencies has been proposed in two phases, with diamond 
drilling contingent on success of the initial general exploration phase.

TECHNICAL REPORT 
ARIZONA LODE PROPERTIES 

Yavapai County, Arizona 
ALLIANCE MINING CORP. 

INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE  
 

Technical report describing all of their properties in central Arizona. The purpose of the report 
is to compile all information in one report and to provide direction for future exploration and as 
part of the requirements for listing on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV). 
 
The author visited the subject properties on February 21 and 22, 2011.  During this time a heavy 
snowfall occurred in the Prescott area.  Despite this, a helicopter was used to visit the outlying 
properties not accessible by road because of snow cover. 
 
The property comprises 199 claims in four separate areas north and south of Highway 89 
between Prescott and Congress Arizona, in an area with numerous old copper and gold mines 
and prospects.  

RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 
In this report, the author has relied in part on previous Technical reports written for Alliance by 
the late Ron Wells, P.Geo. and by Craig Parkinson RPG.   A number of other Technical Reports 
for the Zonia copper property have also been referenced as well as government maps and 
publications.  Much of the information concerning the Silver Crown Mine is from a detailed 
report by Franklin W Mack completed for owner Newell Newton in August 1992. Brief reports 
by Brian Beck PG (Arizona) detailed work done on the Silver Crown and Goldcop areas (west of 
Copper Basin). 

THE COMPANY 

exploring precious metal and base metal resource properties  principally in the Prescott area, 
Yavapai County Arizona.   
 
On Septe

and commenced trading on the Canadian Trading and Quotation System Inc.  or CNSX) 
under the ticker symbol ALM. As a result of this listing the Company also became a reporting 
issuer in the Province of Ontario.  The Company is in the exploration stage so it does not have 
active mining operations or cash flow.

Each claim is 1500 ft. x 600 ft. = 20.66 Acres.  All claims expire on Sept 1, 2011 unless fees and 
rentals are paid.  A complete listing of titles is provided in an Appendix.  Location and claim 
maps are shown on the following pages.  The claims have not been surveyed.  The properties 

there are no existing environmental or social issues which would affect title.  The area of the 
properties may be used for grazing, hunting and recreations.  The author has no specific 
knowledge of surface rights which may conflict with the claims.  The properties encompass old 
mines and showings known as, Gold Pit, Gold Eagle, Boston Arizona, Gold Spring, Gold Beetle, 
Placerita, Silver Crown, Bodie and Trails End, and possibly others unnamed or renamed. 
 
Cautionary Note:  In sections 17 and 18 of the Goldcop claims (Western Placerita) there are 
some old claims in the area that had no  but may still be active with BLM. These 
claims need to be found and surveyed and may result in the loss of some area, yet to be 
determined.

common shares within 45 days of the agreement, payment of $20,000 on the first anniversary 
date of the agreement and a final payment of $30,000 on the second anniversary date. The 
vendors will hold a net smelter royalty of 2% which the Company can purchase back for 
$500,000.00.  The Company also entered into an agreement dated September 11, 2010 with a 
mineral placer claim holder to acquire the right to stake lode mineral claims over two placer 
claims that are on hard rock that were part of the former Silver Crown Mine property. 
Compensation consists of a cash payment of $5,000 (of which $2,500 has been paid) and 
issuance of 75,000 common shares within 45 days of entering into the agreement and a further 
$5,000 within 90 days of the agreement. The Placer claim holder will retain a 2% Net smelter 
royalty on lode claims placed over the placers which the Company can purchase back for 

$25,000 within one year of the agreement.  All payments in these agreements are in US dollars. 
Alliance also staked a total of 24 lode mineral claims adjoining the Silver Crown Mine property 
which now places the former mine property close to its original historical size. 

 

Reclamation and Permitting 
 
A considerable number of old mines and prospects exist in the Prescott/Wilhoit area.  Previous 
surface disturbances caused during historic gold exploration and small scale mining occur 
throughout the property area. Many old workings including adits, shafts and cuts/trenches 
occur; some of these are documented on topographic maps, but many are not.   
 
Future surface disturbance during exploration will require placing bonds with the Bureau of 
Land Management offices in Phoenix Arizona.  Any drilling will require a notice of operation 
(NOI) OR Plan of Operation (POO) to the BLM. and may take up to 3 months to process. A bond 
is posted upon acceptance of the notice of operation.   
 
As of August, 2009, the Company submitted a plan of operation to the USDA Forest Service for 
drilling the Trails End Gold Mine. The plan has been preliminary approved and final approval 
will be granted upon posting reclamation bonding. On August 18, 2009, the Company also 
announced it had submitted plans of operations for drilling the Gold Beetle#1 and Gold Beetle 
#2 Gold Mine Properties. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requested certain revisions to 
the plan. This revised plan has now been resubmitted to the BLM for approval This revised plan 
was put on hold until the company could complete an airborne survey and now plans to re-
submit a new plan from the results of the survey and follow up geophysical work. The Company 
has permits in hand for the Gold Pit Mine Property and the Golden Eagle Mine which would 
allow four drill sites on each property.  Permits to drill the other properties would have to be 
negotiated with the Bureau of Land Management. 
 
Claim locations are shown in the following figures.  Enlarged versions are available in PDF 
format but the size of the claim blocks makes it difficult to portray at page size scales.

ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY  
 

Access 
Access to the properties is generally good with numerous ranch and mine roads extending 
northward and southward from Highway 89 at Wilhoit and Kirkland Junction.  The most difficult 
properties to access are the Bodie Mine and Trails end mines situated in the mountains east 
and south of the Hassayampa River.  Access is by 4WD vehicle and is dependent on road 
conditions.  For these two properties and the Boston-Arizona mine, the writer used a helicopter 
chartered from Phoenix. 
 

Climate 
The climate in this part of Arizona is semi-desert with low rainfall, hot dry summers and short 
cool winters. Snow accumulations are minimal in January and February but did occur just prior 
to the property inspection.  Scrub vegetation on the properties is commonly dense including 
manzanita trees, catclaw, acacia, and cacti; some areas are difficult to access because of the 
thick vegetation cover. Wildlife in the area includes red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, mule 
deer, turkey, antelope, javelina, and cottontail rabbit. 
 

Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
Power has been supplied to many of the nearby ranches and settlements in the area and 
particularly to the Zonia Mine.  Supplies and services are most easily available in Prescott. The 
nearest railroad is the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at Congress, 42 km (26 mi) from 
the Silver Crown mine or at  Kirkland, approximately 26 km (16 mi) northwest of the mine. 
Phoenix is the nearest major airport with regularly scheduled air service with flights from major 
US and Canadian cities.  There are local airports at Prescott and Wickenburg and there is an old 
airstrip at the Zonia mine (condition unknown).  Helicopters are available at Flagstaff or at 
Phoenix. 
 

Physiography 
The area is on the western slope of the Bradshaw mountains, elevations range from 3,400 feet 
at the level of the Hassayampa River to about 6000 feet at the top of the highest claim (Bodie 
Mine) The area is one of strongly dissected topography with myriad stream drainages (generally 
dry) and rounded hills.

HISTORY  
 
A discussion of general mining history has been amended from the Parkinson Report (2007): 
 
The state of Arizona has produced approximately 14 million ounces of gold from 1860 through 

-sized mines, and in 1965 ranked eighth among gold 
producing states. Since 1980 there has been a significant decline in gold production, probably 
related to low metal prices (gold and copper) and a political climate that was unfavorable 
towards mining, and it is not believe that there is a single operating gold mine in Arizona at the 
present time.  Recently, these factors have seen major improvements and there has been 

 
 
In the late 1800s, the Placerita gold mining camp, which includes the area covered by the 
Placerita Properties, was a small Spanish community and the miners worked placer and gold 
quartz-oxide veins. There are numerous shallow underground workings dating from this period, 
including adits, shafts, and remnants of small stamp mills (crushing plants). 
 
Significant mining in Arizona began in the 1870s and 1880s. Lode and placer gold mines 
dominated production until 1900, and after that time most annual gold production was a 
by-product of large-scale porphyry copper mining. Yavapai County ranked first in Arizona gold 
production until 1959, with production of approximately 3.5 million ounces. In the general area 
of the Placerita Properties, production occurred predominantly in small-scale gold mining 
operations involving narrow underground vein development. 
 

t is clear from the presence of old mine workings observed during 
the Site Visit that certain areas of the Placerita Properties have been mined historically, a 
review of the historic property files held in the Phoenix offices of the Arizona Department of 
Mines and Mineral Resources indicates that much of this work was poorly documented. In 
addition, there is a lack of consistency in claim and property names. There is no documentation 
of any exploration in the Placerita Properties area between 1962 and 2002. 
 
Each of the properties or major showings  has its own local history, which is outlined under sub-
headings in Mineralization .  To some extent, because of the large number of old showings

GEOLOGICAL SETTING  
           
Regional Geology 
 
The Placerita Properties are located within the Transition Zone in North-central Arizona 
between the Basin and Range Province to the southwest and the Colorado Plateau to the 
northeast. 
 
The Colorado Plateau features flat to gently dipping Mesozoic to Paleozoic age sedimentary 
rocks cut by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. This lies well to the north of Prescott.  
 
The Basin and Range Province is a Mesozoic extensional region characterized by steep faults, 
block uplift, and subsidence. Older Paleozoic to Proterozoic rocks are exposed in uplifted 
basement blocks while younger Cenozoic to Recent sedimentary and volcanic sequences are 
preserved in basins or in some cases as flows on mountain tops.  
 
The Transition Zone exhibits features in common with both. In the Transition Zone, most 
of the Paleozoic rocks have been removed by erosion, exposing the older underlying 
Proterozoic meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks (Yavapai Schists) and granitic intrusions. 
The predominant rock types in the Placerita area are meta-sedimentary and metavolcanic 
schists, granitoid intrusions of varying compositions, andesite, and basalt. 
 
The Precambrian Yavapai Series, (schists) consists of metamorphosed volcanic and tuffaceous 
sedimentary rocks. The rocks total approximately 40,000 ft. in thickness near the Iron King Mine 
to the north of the Silver Crown property, but decrease to about 8,000 ft. in the area of the 
Bagdad deposit to the northwest. The Precambrian sedimentary and volcanic rocks are 
enclosed by the granite and gneissic batholiths. The Yavapai Series strikes northeast and the 
lithological units are steeply dipping. The entire Precambrian sequence has been subjected to 
folding and faulting and the volcanic and sedimentary units have been metamorphosed to 
greenschist facies. The Precambrian units have been intruded by the quartz porphyry bodies 
which range in age from Mesozoic to Cenozoic. 
 
Portions of the area are covered by younger basalts, fanglomerates, and alluvial material. 
 
The best geological map for the area is that by DeWitt et al., portions of which have been 
reproduced in this report.  Unfortunately, the map does not include the Zonia-Silver Crown or 
any adjacent areas.

LOCAL GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

Boston Arizona Mine 
351910 E/3821400 N 
(Figures 8  9 and 10) 

 
The Boston Arizona mine is situated at about 5400 ft. elevation at the head of a drainage which 
flows south-westward to Skull Valley (approximately   4 miles or 6000 meters distant).  The 
mine which has an access road in unknown condition has a 200 ft. shaft, a winze from the 90 ft. 
level and drifts at several levels, total length unknown.  There is no access to the workings and 
there is water in the mine.  Location and a mine plan are shown in the accompanying figures.  
The Boston Arizona mine could not be visited because of snow conditions, but copper 
mineralization was seen in dark colored skarnified volcanics on the ridge south about ¼ mile 
distant. 
 
The Boston Arizona Mine, situated east of Skull Valley on the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe 
railroad, was discovered by two pioneer mining men Judge Griffin and WB Clark.  It was then 
acquired by John  H. Robinson, city manager for Prescott and was known as the Robinson 
property.  It was then acquired by Mark Bradley, and in 1927 was developed by the Arizona 
Boston Development company. 
 
In 1945 there is record of a shipment of 140 tons of ore assaying  1 oz/ton silver, 0.01 oz/ton 
gold,  0.9% lead 0.55% copper and 16.2% zinc.  After shipping and smelting charges there was a 
deficit.  At one time 50 tons per day were being produced and shipped to the Peru Mine at 
Deming New Mexico. 
 

1952 it was owned by Mrs. Martha Preston of Prescott.

In 1966-67 it was explored by  McFarland and Hullinger, who were also shipping copper fluxing 
ore from the Commercial mine nearby.  Noranda examined the mine in 1978 and completed a 
claim sketch.   
 
An historic account states 
a 25 foot drift run to the north, and 30 foot to the south (both showing mineralization.  Again at 
the 100 foot a station is cut with a 20 foot drift to the north and a 10 foot drift to the south. The 
ore pitched on the 20 foot drift and in the bottom of the shaft at 160 feet, a cross cut was driven 
which again picked up the ore, easily encountering the strike of the ore body, Fifteen feet of 
concentrating  
 
Indication from historical data (see mine plan) is that the mineralization was high grade zinc 
with copper, lead. Gold silver values within a shear that was relatively shallowly-dipping. The 
formation in which the ore occurs is porphyry diorite and Yavapai schist. The veins are 
intersected by porphyry dykes at right angles to the mineralization.  A newspaper account 
relates that: The outcropping can be followed from the shaft south over 800 feet and north 600 
feet in an oxidized condition. Then vein foot wail to the hanging wall varies from 75 feet to 125 
feet; where the shaft is sunk, the vein is about 125 feet wide, showing gossan, clear across with 
the exception of one intrusive schist dike about 6 feet in width.  The mineralization is likely a 
zinc rich replacement lens, possibly a volcanogenic massive sulphide body. 
 
Due to snow conditions, the Boston Arizona mine could not be accessed, but the mine was seen 
from the air, and copper mineralization was seen on the ridge above the mine in two locations 
 

Gold  Hill mine 
 
Waypoints 160-165  350321 E/3820333N  (Figure 11) 
 
The Gold Hill mine is situated on a west facing slope west of Copper Basin Wash at about 5250-
5400 ft. elevation.  There is a large dump and a water tank near the dump.  An inclined working 
is near the dump and open cuts above and other workings in the gully to the north.  The Mint 
Shaft mine lies about 1500 meters (1 mile) to the south west and Copper Basin mines are about 
2 miles to the northeast.  There is an un-named mine marked on the topographic map about a 
mile to the north.  The Gold Hill property was visited briefly.  History and mineralization of the 
Gold Hill mine are unknown at this time.   Mineralization aside from oxidized material indicative 
of pyrite decomposition, was not observed on the dumps, but is believed from the historical 
descriptions at hand to be pyritic disseminations in intrusive material.

Silver Crown Mine 
352829E/3798381N  (Figure 12) 
 
The Silver Crown mine is located at 352829E/3798381N, accessed from a ranch road which exits 
the Highway 89 at Kirkland Junction and heads south to Zonia Mine.  At a prominent windmill, 
(Waypoint 139) a rough branch road leads 4 miles southwest to the mine.  The mine is about 1 
mile south of the Copper Crown mine marked on the topographic sheet and is covered by 
waypoints  142-144.  It lies on the southwest slope of a prominent rounded ridge trending  
southwest (max elevation 4650 ft.).  Access roads cross the area of the claims. 
 
The Silver Crown mine is a past productive underground mine situated north and east of the 
Zonia Copper mine, in the Walnut Grove mining district.  Placer gold washing was done on 
French Gulch in the claim area, and placer equipment is still present, indicating some (small 
scale) placer  mining is still being done.  It was discovered about 1880, and in in 1962 was 
owned by Clarence Stoddart and C,D and Vera Ridell.  In 1968, Silver Crown Mine staked 
additional claims in the area.  In 1979 it was owned by Arizona Michigan Mining Company and 
in 1992 by Newell Newton.  The original property was 11 unpatented claims with one main 
underground adits and two shafts.  Copper-gold-silver mineralization occurs in quartz veins and 
shears either parallel to foliation in the metamorphosed volcanic schists or at a slight angle. 
There is little information on the original mine workings.  Apparently there have been 27 
historical diamond drill holes but only logs for 5 holes have been recovered. 
 

 activity have been 
-Mexican occupation of Arizona

was packed out on mules down to the Hassayampa River for milling and processing in arrastras.  
 

 
Activity resumed  about 1957 by the Arizona-Michigan Mining Company. Some development 
work was done and some inefficient milling attempts were made.  The company expended 
about $2.3 million in mine development, mill construction and  drilling 27 diamond drill holes.  
Newton was one of the principals of Arizona Michigan, and after failing to raise additional 
money for mining he let the claims lapse to re-stake in his name. He held the property for years 
afterwards until 2002, trying to raise money for further exploration /mining before transferring 
claims to present owners who worked for him. As they were looking for high grade gold zones 
lower grade bulk tonnage potential was not of interest to him at that time. Some smelter 
records indicate concentrates had gold, silver copper and mainly lead.

In 1982, Gora Morning Mines but accomplished very little work except for limited underground 
sampling and construction of a small mill.  Values in gold, silver, lead and copper were reported 
by Mack (1992) but the sample locations and widths are not known, and so the results are of 
little use.  An adit was driven by Newell Newton toward  a rich intercept from Diamond drillhole 
10. (This may be the tunnel seen in French Gulch).   Mr. Newton staked the property when it 
came open in 1992.  It was reported that Phelps Dodge performed several geophysical surveys 
over  portions of the Silver Crown claims (adjoining the Zonia Mine).  At this time, the author 
has not seen this data. The author visited the Silver Crown and French Gulch areas which occur 
on the Newton claims (The Silver Crown mine is on optioned claims and the adjacent area to 
the west and adjoining the Zonia Mine is covered by Newton claims staked by Alliance. 
 
The Silver Crown/Newton claims encompass the same stratigraphy as the Zonia mine and 
mineralization is similar in type and origin.  The Zonia reports are particularly useful in 
interpretation of the Silver Crown area. 
 
Bodie Mine 
(Figures 13-15) 
 
Bodie Mine and Trails End Mine are located on rough roads that extend up Crooks Canyon on 
the east side of Hassayampa River  in the Bradshaw Mountains and Humboldt National Forest. 
Bodie Mine is about 2 miles north of the Trails End Mine.  Waypoints 156 and 157 mark an open 
cut and shaft which may mark the northern limit of the Bodie Mine workings.  Access was 
limited by snow and only the waypoints noted were visited, the Mine itself was seen from the 
air but access was uncertain by helicopter.  The Elouise mine is marked on the topographic map 
about 4000 feet east of Bodie Mine.  Jeep trails cross the area allowing access by 4WD vehicles 

place on a road/trail which leads over Union Mountain to Prescott (Senator Highway).  There 
are numerous old mines and workings in this area of the Bradshaw Mountains. 
 
A brief statement of the history of the property has been prepared by W. B. Blaylock., one of 
the owners, as a part of the data submitted in making application for a Reconstruction Finance -
Corporation mine loan, excerpts from USGS Bulletin782.  U.S. Geological Survey and from the 
report of the U.S. Mint. 1883. 
 
The Bodie mine was first worked in the eighteen seventies (see U.  S. Bureau of Mint Report for 
1883. copy of which accompanies  Exhibit B).  This work consisted  of a tunnel driven 450-ft., 
connecting with a shaft sunk 130 feet.

Sometime in the late 90 s Mr. Frank Murphy obtained the property and started an extensive 
development program. The exact date that this work was begun is not known. but it is known 
that they were working in 1904., The mine was closed down in the early part of 1908, as a 
result of the financial panic of that period and has never been fully reopened  since. 
 
In the development, work done at this time consisted of sinking the shaft to a depth of 335 feel 
with drifts running off at the 100 feet level and 240 feet level.  On the 315 feet level, the drift 
was run for 1675 feet. The drift on the 100 feet level connects with a shaft 200 feet south of the 
main shaft.   
 
In 1906 John Hays Hammond made a report on the property  (this report was destroyed in the 
burning of the Congress hotel in Prescott in 1923). As a result of this report a railroad grade was 
surveyed into the property and work started on the  road bed. A three compartment working 
shaft was started up by the New York tunnel.  This shaft would have connected with the 1675 
feet drift off  the 315 feet level of the main shaft at a depth of 400 feet. 
 
During the first World War several carloads of ore were cobbed and  shipped by leases, who 
claimed that the ore averaged 40% lead and 16 oz. silver.  This is all the ore known to have been 
shipped from the property. There are approximately 700 to 1000 tons of ore on the dump. No 
stoping has been done in the mine. 
 
In 1940-41 the applicant opened the New York tunnel (see Map No. 1. Exhibit B) which had 
been closed for over 60 years.   A nice body of ore was found, the average width of which is five 
feet. Near the end of the tunnel, a slight fault occurs.   A crosscut was driven to the east by the 
applicant.  After cutting through two feet of basalt dike, a vein four feet In width was picked up. 
In continuing the crosscut on through four feet of basalt, another vein was cut for a distance of 
three and one-half feet, but the opposite wall  was not reached. 
 
In 1980  A visit was made to the shaft collar at the Bodie Mine, Hassayampa District. Yavapai 
County, by the Arizona Bureau of Mines personnel.  They reported  
shaft approximately 30 ft. below the collar. The collar has slipped for the first 10 -15 ft. and from 
that point down to the water the shaft walls appear in excellent shape and have no timber. One 
sample was taken of high grade material collected from the dump. That sample is catalogued as  
13 0+38 60". The material on the dump includes a significant amount of galena and pyrite in 
quartz vein material. A small amount of scattered wood debris is all that remains of previous 

 
 
Mineralization, as noted in the previous paragraph, is quartz vein material with galena and 
pyrite.  The vein may have some affinity with volcanogenic activity.  The author saw the main 
shaft area but was not able to access it because of snow.  As an alternative, the helicopter was 
parked on the access road above the NW working and the author traversed to an open cut and 
shaft from which three samples were taken.  The samples, marked waypoints 155, 156, and 157

Trails End Mine 
368577E/3798416 N  (Waypoints 153-154) 
(Figures 13, 16) 
 
Much of the information herein is derived from a report by Plen Dickson, P.Eng. in 1983 for 
Unistar  Technologies Corp., a TSX (then VSE) company.  Another prospect, the Yankee Boy 
Mine is marked on the topographic sheet about 4000 feet east of the Trails End Mine.  The 
Trails End mine has also been known as the Clorinda, Toby Shaft, Arizona Klondyke and Circle 
Cross or Gold Ridge property.  History of the mine as summarized from Dickson is : 
 
Placer gold was found as early as 1863 in the area on the Hassayampa and Lynx Creeks 
(Prescott area) by a party of pioneers under the leadership of Joseph Walker. The discovery of 
additional placers on larger streams in the area led to the location of numerous gold and silver 
bearing veins on Bigbug, Lynx, and Hassayampa Creeks.  Prospecting and mining continued to 
be limited as the area remained a stronghold of the hostile Apache Indians for some time. 
 
The Trails End property is said to have been worked by Geo. Pearce and Bros. in the early days. 
Their work was reported to have been confined to the White Oak claim but was suspended 
when sulphides were encountered. In 1903 and 190% John Henry Cross located 5 claims. The 
Yavapai Magazine, July 1915, P. 16 reports that Cross was responsible for the then existing 
workings which consisted of  a  100 ft. shaft,  a 70 foot drift to north from bottom of shaft. A 
100 foot drift to south from bottom of shaft and a 90 foot tunnel that intersected the vein (6 
feet wide) just above the camp on a second ledge.  The magazine also reports that Cross paid

for the above work from bullion extracted by using an arrastra (implying substantial native 
gold). 
 
In 1917, the property was taken over by the Circle Cross Mining Co. who did some work but for 
which, details are not available. 
 
Mr. W.B. Blaylock acquired the property in 1920 and deepened the shaft to its present depth; 
did additional drifting; and did some work on the White Oak Claim.  A water supply, camp 
buildings and a hoist installed by Blaylock at this time have since vanished. Very little work was 
done on the property in later years, but it is reported that Mr. Blaylock held the claims for a 
number of years. 
 
A Mr. W.C. Dean staked the property about 1965 with a one-half interest going to Mr. Clyde 
Walker on recording. Mr. Walker later sold his interest to two Smith brothers in the area.  Mr. 
Neal Mischke, the owner in 1983, acquired the property from the above owners in 1975.  Mr. 
Mischke dewatered the main shaft to the first level and the Toby Shaft. Any mining by Mr. 
Mischke has been small and confined to a surface cut some 2,000 feet east of the above 
workings.  
 
In 1983, Vancouver TSE companies Bridgewest Development Corp. and Unistar Technologies 
Corp. held the Trails End and other properties in Arizona.  From the Dickson report of 1983, the 
following information has been gleaned: 
 
Geology of the property was briefly described by Plen Dickson in his 1983 report:  (Quoted 
verbatim below): 
 

-Cambrian 
Yavapai schists. Igneous rocks consist of medium grained granite, some diorite, large 
areas of aplite, and basic dikes which are now amphibolite schists. These rocks as a 
whole are known as the Bradshaw granite.   That portion of the Bradshaw granite in which the 
Trails End property lies is known as the Crooks Complex. Rock compositions are similar, but the 
complex differs in that its marked by alternations of diorite, aplite, gabbro, schist and granite. 
 
The complex is largely igneous and the trend of the bands is often transverse to the 
adjacent schists. It is reported that the contacts between the separate acid and basic 
bands are igneous in all cases and enclosed belts of schists are numerous. 
Granitic intrusions and uplift to form the Bradshaw Mountains has caused fissuring and 
fracturing of the rocks which permitted the formation of structures such as the 
mineralized veins of the district. 
 
The mineralized vein is a true fissure. In the area of the Clorinda and Toby Shafts the 
vein is from 4· to 8 feet in width with quartz sometimes on one wall, but more 
frequently on both walls, separated by 1 to 3 feet of amphibolite schist forming 
generally the central part of the vein.

The strike of the structure is N 650 E with a dip of 800 to the south. Some minor 
deviations from this occur in both strike and dip. 
 
Mineralized vein material has been found on surface through exposures, trenches, pits 
and tunnels over a strike length of some 3,500 feet. The claim groups cover an 
additional potential strike length of some 4,000 feet to the northeast and 

 
 
Dickson summarized lite dyke has been 
traced for some 3,500 feet of strike length on the property and potential for an additional 7,000 
feet of strike length exists.  The vein exists in the Crooks Complex of the Bradshaw granite where 
similar veins on other properties have been persistent on strike and to depth.   Development 
consists of a 155 foot shaft with 228 feet of drifting on the first level (with some stoping) with an 
unknown amount of development on the lower levels. A number of old pits and shallow caved 
adits exist on the property - very little information is available on the latter . 
Mineralization is described by Dickson as follows: 
 
Quartz and amphibolite schist constitute the greatest portion of the mineralized 

structure. Sulphide mineralization is mainly pyrite although it is generally low overall. 
Some chalcopyrite has been observed by the author and mention is made of it in old 
reports. Pyrite in the quartz is mainly coarse grained. The author has observed some pyrite in 
the amphibolite schist and this appears to be all gradations from fine to coarse. The 
author has not observed any other types of sulphide and mention is not made of any in 
reports.  Sulphides have been leached from the upper 40 feet of the vein and to some extent to 
as far as the first level. The pyrite in the amphibolite does not appear to be leached 
appreciably. 
 
Dickson did not observe any free  any gold, but it is reported to be free and also associated 
with the sulphides . 
 
 
Sampling by Dickson in 1983 on the first level has returned assay values as high as 2.68 oz. 
Au/Ton from quartz veins (among other lower values).    
 
Dickson suggested  because of the persistence of the structure, good gold values in one 
mineralized shoot and other favourable conditions a three phase program of grid layout, 
geological mapping, rehabilitation of the old workings, sampling, rotary-percussion hole drilling, 
map making and metallurgical test-work should be done.  
was possible in the Trails End mine as safety of the workings was uncertain and the area was 
covered by snow.

Gold Pit 
358277E/3811512N 
(Figures 18-19) 
 
The Gold Pit Gold Chest and Golden Eagle claims are located near the town of Wilhoit Arizona 
near the Prescott mining district  on U.S. Forest Service land.  The Gold Pit claim is in the south 
central part of Section 25, T13N, R3W, and the Golden Eagle claim is in the southeast corner of 
Section 4, T12N, R3W.  Both claims are  within weathered and altered granite with local thick 
quartz veins and gouge zones.   
 
The Gold Pit mine is a short distance east of the Highway 89 at waypoint 125, or 
358143E/3811470N.  A shaft and a mine symbol are marked on the topographic map.  Access is 
by a road or trail approximately 500 ft. downhill and east from the highway.  An open cut or 
shaft is present at Waypoint 126 (358277E/3811512N) and a short adit at waypoint 127 
(358319E/3811497N) on the same trail.  History of the Gold Pit is not well known.  Gold 
mineralization is in quartz veins and breccias on the wall of the shaft.  Minor copper stain was 
noted at the adit.  Additional claims are staked by Alliance to the north, with several workings 
noted on the topographic sheet.  These were not visited because of snow conditions. 
 
 
As described by Parkinson (2006);  
weathered and iron-altered granite.  Sample Gold Pit 1 is from the west edge of the caved shaft 
and is an 8-foot channel sample of strongly weathered granite with moderate limonite and 
weak hematite alteration.  The strike of the altered granite appears to be towards the 
northeast.  Sample Gold Pit 2 is from the back face of a somewhat caved adit located southeast 
of the shaft and about 40 feet from sample Gold Pit 1.  Sample Gold Pit 2 is an 8-foot channel 
sample within broken granite with abundant sulfides and strong limonite staining and 
bleaching.  The strike of the altered zone appears to be toward the southwest and may intersect 
the zone of altered granite where sample Gold Pit 1 was collected.  This relation suggests a

Gold Eagle 
355810E/3808639N 
(Figure 18) 
 
The Gold Eagle claims are located about a mile and a half southeast of the settlement of Wilhoit 
(named after a prospector) and access is from highway 89 about ½ mile east of Wilhoit, on a 
road which follows Orofino Wash.  The showings are marked by small dumps on a ridge just 
north of Orofino Windmill.  Waypoints 130-132 mark small workings from which the authors 
samples were taken.  History of the property is not well documented.  Mineralization is 
quartz/sulphide veins hosted by granitic rocks.  The Gold Eagle prospect  is assigned a moderate 
priority and has an active drill permit 
 
 
Parkinson noted:  The Golden Eagle claim is situated within granite and granite porphyry with 
variable pervasive and vein-controlled silicification and iron alteration.  Sample Golden Eagle 1 
is from a prospect pit within broken porphyrytic granite with moderate pervasive silicification 
and quartz veins, and strong limonite and hematite alteration.  The veins are vertical and strike 
275 degrees.  Sample Golden Eagle 2 is from a shallow prospect within fractured granite which 
exposes as 2-foot gouge zone containing 6-inch quartz veins.  The granite shows strong limonite 
alteration, and the sample site is near a shaft with a 12-feet-wide quartz vein on the surface.  
Sample Golden Eagle 3 is from a mining dump pile about 30 feet down slope from sample site 
Golden Eagle 2.  The dump pile consists of quartz vein pieces up to six inches long that contain

Gold Beetle 
Waypoints 136-138 
UTM 349513.26/3792885.85 
(Figure 20) 

 
The Gold Beetle property is situated in the vicinity of the historic settlement of Placerita.  The 
property is described as follows by Parkinson (2007):   
 
The Placerita Gold Mining Camp dates back to the late 1800s with initial placer gold mining 
followed by the discovery and development of lode gold deposits using adits and shallow shafts. 
Records of this work are poor to absent. Exploration in the 1920s and 30s was dominantly by 
Hassayampa Gold Mining Company at Placerita (Contact Claim Group) and Gold Spring to the 
west. In the claim areas gold mineralization was reported from northeast- and northwest 
trending veins over generally narrow widths. Very little exploration has been documented in the 
property area since the 1930s. 
 
The gold-bearing vein system on the Gold Beetle Claim trends southeast and is hosted within 
granite. The claim hosts several mineralized veins up to two meters wide in a significant 
structural zone. The Gold Beetle claim area lies in a schist-hosted setting with indications of 
gold mineralization. 
 
Preliminary sampling by Alliance in 2003 returned assay results indicating the presence of gold 
mineralization within veins on the property. Sixteen vein and wall rock samples taken by Ronald 

 Gold 
Beetle claim is gold-mineralized. Analysis of the 16 samples collected by Kamloops Geological 
Services  the late Ron Wells)  exhibited gold assay values ranging from <0.03 grams per ton 
(g/t) to 119 g/t, with an average of 8.7 g/t. 
 
The present author looked at the Gold Beetle adit and confirmed the geology as presented by 
Parkinson.  Two confirmatory samples were taken:  The sample marked Gold Bug may actually 
be on the Gold Beetle claim.  An attractive looking epithermal style vein float from one of the 
dumps (M322678) has barium values but no gold in this sample; it should however be 
investigated further.  The property is described in more detail in  2007 Technical 
Report.  The prospect is assigned medium priority.

Gold Spring 
(Figure 23)  UTM 347039.8E/3792657N/ ELEV 5011.201 

 
The Gold Spring showing lies within Gold Spring 2 claim situated west of the main Placerita gold 
mining camp within a northeast trending silicified (Yavapai Series) schist belt with local larger 
quartz veins. The Gold Spring #2 claim may lie along the same northeast-trending zone as the 
Gold Beetle #2 claim.  A shallow shaft (depth unknown) exposes a copper mineralized structure 
which may be a shear.     
 

A copper-mineralized quartz vein up to two feet wide is 
exposed in old workings and has a westerly strike. Sampling by Alliance returned 5.96g/t Au 
from a grab sample in a shaft and 2.33 g/t Au from a grab sample from the shaft dump. Gold 
values in the 0.1 to 0.34 g/t range were obtained from 50 quartz veinlet/schist and soil samples.  
Further sampling is recommended in this area . 
 
The present author did not enter the shaft, and sampled quartz material selected from the 
dump.  This material assayed 0.23 g/t gold, 151 ppm arsenic 190 ppm lead and 205 ppm 
copper, all moderately but not strongly anomalous. 
 
Considerable additional mapping is required in the area.  The prospect is assigned low priority. 

 

Gold Bug 
 
The gold Bug 2 showing could not be visited because of snow and access problems.   The author 
has no specific information on this showing, which is situated about 3500 feet northwest of 
Placerita.  Mapping, prospecting and sampling is required.  The prospect is assigned low 
priority. 
 
 

Other showings 
 
 
There may be other showings known or unknown on the numerous claims held by Alliance in 
the Placerita area.

EXPLORATION  
 
Alliance has completed a number of surface sampling programs on various parts of the 
properties, chiefly the Placerita and Copper Basin areas.  A number of NI43-101 technical 
reports by Wells, and Parkinson address mainly the Placerita area showings  Gold Bug, Gold 
Beetle and related veins. 
 
During February 11th to 15th 2011 Geotech Ltd. Of Aurora Ontario carried out a helicopter-
borne geophysical survey over Copper Hill & Silver Crown blocks situated about 11 km west of 
Prescott, Arizona, United States. 
 
Principal geophysical sensors included a versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) 
system, and a cesium magnetometer. Ancillary equipment included a GPS navigation system 
and a radar altimeter. A total of 379.5 line-kilometres of geophysical data were acquired 
during the survey. 
 
Recently, Brian Beck completed a brief letter report describing the airborne geophysical survey 
with respect to the local geology of two areas, the Boston Arizona area (Placerita West claims) 
and the Silver Crown area (Placerita South claims): 
 
The processed survey results are presented as the following maps: 
 

Total Magnetic Intensity 
B-Field Z Component Channel 
Calculated Time Constant (TAU) 
Electromagnetic stacked profiles of the B-field Z component 
Electromagnetic stacked profiles of the dB/dt Z component 
Fraser Filtered X Component 
3D Voxel grid from Resistivity Depth Image (RDI) 

 
 
During the survey the helicopter was maintained at a mean altitude of 86 metres above the 
ground with a nominal survey speed of 80 km/hour. This allowed for a nominal EM bird 
terrain clearance of 51 metres and a magnetic sensor clearance of 73 metres. 
 
The survey was flown using a Sinton Helicopters (A star) 350 B3 helicopter, registration 
N354SH. The helicopter is owned and operated by Geotech Aviation. Installation of the 
geophysical and ancillary equipment was carried out by a Geotech Ltd crew.

Geology and Interpretation by Brian Beck PG 
 

COPPER HILL AREA 
 
The Copper Hill area geology within the claim region can be described as being mainly the 
Government Canyon Tonalite (GCT) of the early Proterozoic (1.2 to 1.4 billion years).  This GCT 
grades from a diorite to a granodiorite, but is mainly a tonalite.  Intruded into the GCT is a series 
of late Cretaceous Breccia Pipes (BP) and the Copper Basin Stock.  These BPs ranges in size from 
0.1 to 1 kilometer (km) in rough diameter and all of them show some form hydrothermal 
alteration.  Most of these BPs are reported to be associated with copper and gold 
mineralization.  From the attached map of the Copper Hills area, there were four BPs observed 
with various copper oxides, Chalcopyrite and Pyrite within the claim area.  The observed BPs 
ranged from 0.15 to 0.25 km in diameter.  All of these exposed BPs have had some form of past 
mining activities ranging from surface trenching to inclines with depths at least 50 meters or 
more.  All of the open workings were in poor condition and unsafe for entry.  The biggest BP 
within the claim area is at sample locations 21 thru 23. 
 
The BPs are the reported sources of most of the known mineralization within the region. Each of 
the observed BPs has a silica replacement cap that is generally less than 20 meters in thickness 
and was not consistently found across the BPs.  All of the upper portion of the BPs were highly 
leached with the pyrite and chalcopyrite being replaced with various iron oxides.  The 
granodiorite within the leached zones had conversions to 40% sericite, but was generally less 
than 15%.  All of the observed BPs were in a general north-south trend on the western side of 
the Copper Hills claim block.  East of these exposed BPs, the area is covered with various 
Miocene volcanic flows. 
 
There northern portion of the Copper Hills claim area is in an isolated block of Green Schist that 
is roughly 1.5 km square.  Within this block is the Arizona Boston Mine, which has been 
developed on a near vertical section of altered schist with a mineralized vein between 0.5 and 2 
meters.  The apparent mineralized structure in 1.1 km long.  This area has had core drilling and 
we observed at least 11 different drill sites along the main structure.  There is between 2,000 
and 3,000 tons of mined rock that appears to have a high content of pyrite and chalcopyrite on 
the mine dumps.   
 
Airborne  Geophysics 
 
From the report issued by Geotech, Ltd. on the Copper Hills area in March 2011, a series of 
geophysical features were observed on the various maps produced.  For the Copper Hills Area 
VTEM (electrical conductivity) dB/dt and the Fraser Filtered dB/dt plots indicate that there is a 
general pattern of features that trend from the southwest to the northeast and can be grouped 
into three (3) general trend areas: South, Central and North.  The Total and Magnetic Vertical

Gradient maps shows a similar pattern of  features trending from the southwest to the 
northeast. 
 
1. South Area 
The southern trend is located just northwest  of the town of Wilholt, Arizona.  The western and 
central portion of this trend are down faulted by a known fault and the published USGS maps of 
the area indicate that this area has between 100 and 350 meters of modern sediment cover.  
This is in close agreement with the indicated depths of the geophysical survey.  The eastern 
portion of this trend is located along the contact of the Government Canyon Tonalite (Peeples 
Valley pluton) and the southern portion of the Copper Basin Stock.  This area is known for 
various BPs and past mining activity within the Finch Mining District (1936 to 1949).  This area is 
reported to have produced 17,000 pounds of copper, 100 oz of gold and 1,000 oz of silver. 
 
The majority of this trend is down faulted, covered with alluvium or has Miocene volcanic flow 
cover.  The known mining within this trend is within windows of the volcanic flows. 
 
2. Central Area 
The central trend starts at the southwest corner of the Copper Hill Claim area, trends north 
through the claim area and turn northeast just before the Copper Basin Road.  The biggest 
known producing mines in this region are located within this central trend area - Thumb Butte,  
Anderson Silver, Zachariah Mining, Silver Gulch Lode, Verde Annex, Tri-metallic Group, Copper 
Basin and Adeline Mercury within the Copper Basin and Thumb Butte Districts (1901 to 1968).  
These districts have a reported production of 19 million pounds of copper, 508,000 pounds of 
lead, and 1.4 million pounds of zinc with 1,300 oz of gold and 46,000 oz of silver.  All of the 
reported mineral occurrences are within BPs. 
 
South of Copper Basin Road for a distance of approximately 3km, this trend is covered by 
Miocene volcanic flows.  
 
3. North Area 
The north trend starts near the Arizona Boston Mine area and to the northeast.  All of the 
known mining activity has occurred at the Arizona Boston Mine and to the west.  There is no 
reported mining activity to the east and most likely is due to the very rugged conditions and lack 
of roads in this area.  The Arizona Boston Mine is a known producer (1910 through 1949) with a 
reported production of 17,000 pounds of copper, 100 oz Au and 1,000 oz Ag.  Activity was again 
conducted in the 1970s and 1980s with all of the reported production being stockpiled outside of 
the mine (2,000 to 3,000 tons).

SILVER CROWN AREA 
 
Observed Features 
 
The Silver Crown claim area is consists of early Proterozoic Metavolcanics and Metasediments 
that are reported to have been derived from an early offshore volcanic arc system surrounded by 
a shallow sea.  Most of the metamorphic grades are green schist facies with a few areas grading 
into low grade amphibolite facies.  The amphibolite facies are found adjacent to the younger 
granodiorite intrusives.    
 
All of the mineralized areas observed were within the Proterozoic Metavolcanics and 
Metasediments and appear to be related to the known volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits 
common to the area.  The USGS has characterized the VMS to relative temperature of deposition 
of the mineralization.  According to the latest published information by DeWitt (1996 & 2008): 
 

1) The higher grade copper bearing VMS deposits are located nearer to the volcanic 
sources with temperature ranges from 400 to  450 C. 
 
2) The copper, lead, and zinc bearing VMS are medium temperature depositions with 
ranges  from 250 to 400 C. 
 
3) The higher grade silver and gold bearing VMS being the lowest temperature deposits 
with  ranges less than 250C. 

 
Adjacent to the Silver Crown claim area is the Zonia mine, which is reported to be a VMS 
mineralized with combination temperature range from 300 to 450C.  The observed 
mineralization within the Silver Crown claim area would appear to be mainly in the temperature 
range of less than 300C.   Some of the Silver Crown mineralized areas appear to have been 
remobilized by the younger Quartz-Tourmaline dikes. 
 
The geologic units encountered within the Silver Crown claim area are:   
 
Miocene to Oligocene 
 
Basalt- Capping most of the southern hill tops within the Silver Crown area are basalt flows and 
appear to have a thickness of 4 to 8 meters.  These units are black with up to 30% vesicles and 
most have a weathered zeolite filling.  These basalt flows are generally horizontal. 
 
Rhyodacite - A combination of flows and domes appear to be present in the southern portion of 
the Silver Crown Area.  The observed structure suggest that a lopolithic feature is partly exposed 
along the southern Whitehead Ranch Road.  These units are light to dark gray with minor vesicle 
development and flow banding.  Two exposures of this unit had hematite and magnetite banding 
up to 15mm in thickness.

Latite-andesite - Dikes of Latite-andesite were observed on the eastern side of the Silver Crown 
area at the contact between the green schist and the granodiorite.  These dikes are 1 to 3 meters 
in width and have surface expressions of less than 50 meters.  These units have a weathered 
yellowish gray-green color and have numerous xenoliths of various rock types.  Most of these 
dike have phenocrysts of plagioclase from 0.3 to 11mm with occasional biotite.  The dikes are 
near vertical with a dip to the south and trend N15W to N5E. 
 
Quartz-Tourmaline Dikes - The Quartz (Milky)-Tourmaline (Schorl) dikes are found throughout 
the area in occur in two different apparent modes: 
 

1) Along the eastern side of the Silver Crown Area there is a zone that varies from 10 to 
100 meters at the contact between the granodiorite and the green schist.  These dikes cut 
across the green schist, aplite dikes, and the granodiorite.  The dikes in this area have 
xenoliths of the surrounding rocks.  These dikes parallel the contact with the 
granodiorite, but do not have a consistent trend, width, or length. 

 
2) These dikes were observed at and within the altered schist zones with the known 
mineralization. These dikes commonly have limonite replaced pyrites and carbonate 
xenoliths.  The dikes in these areas are generally less than 0.2 meters in width and have 
surface expressions of less than 20 meters.  No general trend was observed, but varied 
from N15E to N30W. 

 
 
Uncertain Age 
 
Aplite Dikes - Very fined grained aplite dikes are observed in various locations within the 
granodiorite and green schist.  These dikes are less than 1 meters in thickness, have various dips 
and trends.  Observed lengths were less than 20 meters. No apparent relationship observed to 
any other unit. 
 
Aplite-Pegmatite Dikes - Medium to coarse grained aplite-pegmatite dikes are observed in 
various locations within the green schist.  These dikes are less than 0.5 meters in thickness and 
trend mainly to the north with various near vertical dips.  No apparent relationship observed to 
any other unit. 
 
Proterozoic  
 
Peeples Valley Granodiorite - This unit appears to be present on both sides of the Silver Crown 
area.  This Granodiorite consist of a fine to medium-grained, equigranular.  Sparse biotite up to 
0.2mm are observed.  The exposed unit on the eastern side of the Silver Crown area has Epidote 
replacements (up to 60%) parallel to contact with the green schist.  This granodiorite is part of 
the Government Canyon Tonalite. 
 
Prescott Granodiorite -  This unit appears to be present as isolated outcrops on the eastern side 
of the Silver Crown area.  This Granodiorite is weathered, consist of a medium-grained, 



A R I Z O N A  G O L D  P R O P E R T I E S                                 P a g e  | 62 
 

B.J.PRICE GEOLOGICAL CONSULTANTS INC.  June 2011 

inequigranular, biotite rich rock that is greenish in color.  Most of the exposures have a tectonic 
foliation.  
 
GREEN SCHIST 
 
The following is a general description of the observed features within the Green Schist: 
 
Basaltic Flows- Generally black in color, very fined grained, partly replaced in various areas 
with silica.  These units are less than 1 meter in thickness and follow the general depositional 
trend of the surrounding green schist.  Surface expressions are less than 50 meters.  These units 
were only observed near the apparent VMS mineralized zones. 
 
Iron-formation/ Metachert - Generally less than 0.5 meters, laterally discontinuous beds of 
oxide-facies iron formation, impure marble and metachert.  Locally, bedding textures appear to 
be observed.  These units were only observed near the apparent VMS mineralized zones. 
 
Green Schist - Most of the Silver Crown area has exposures of a green schist facies.  This schist 
has five general appearances: 
 

a) Blocky, dark gray green schist near slate texture, moderately to highly fractured with 
little  if any alteration. 
 
b) Muscovite schist with some hornblende, blocky texture. 
 
c) Iron-stained, blocky, reddish green schist near slate texture, highly fractured with 
 alteration to clay common. 
 
d) Silica replaced, iron-stained, reddish-brown, massive schist. Usually in association 
with  mineralized zones. 
 
e) Completely altered schist to various forms of clays with colorations ranging from 
green to  orange to black. 

 
Other Features 
 
Fracture Zones - These areas have limited surface expressions and cross all rock units.  The 
feature could be a fault or some sort dislocation feature.  Unknown relationship.

MINERALIZED AREAS 
 
From the field work so far, the observed mineralized areas within the Silver Crown area are in  
the altered schist zones and mainly consist of the schists described above as c, d, & e.  See 
attached plot. 
 
The observed sulfide mineralization occurrences are: 
 
Pyrite- Three different occurrences: 
 1) Very thin layers within a manganese oxide quartz, massive. 
 2) Equitant grains up to 0.2mm within a limey schist. 
 3) Equitant grains up to 8mm within an altered schist 
 
Arsenopyrite- Only found on the dumps at the southern shaft on Gold Bug 2.  Occurrence is in 
massive layers up to 6mm thick within a manganese oxide quartz. Grains up to 2mm. 
 
Galena - Galena was observed within the same sample as the arsenopyrite.  Separate grains up 
to 3mm. 
 
Magnetite - Magnetite was commonly observed with manganese oxide quartz with grains up to 
0.4 mm.  
 
All other mineralized areas were heavily oxidized to limonite and hematite. 
 
 
Faulting  
 
The entire area just east of the claim area is faulted downward. There is at least several hundred 
feet of recent volcanics and alluvium covering the area. 
 
There is feature that has the appearance of a fault that trends east-west across the northern 
portion of the area.  This feature appears to have had some remobilization of the encountered 
VMS zones and redeposited the mineralization within the observed breccia zones. 
 
Air Geophysics 
 
From the report issued by Geotech, Ltd. on the Silver Crown area in March 2011, a series of 
geophysical features were observed on the various maps produced.  For the Silver Crown Area 
VTEM (electrical conductivity) dB/dt and the Fraser Filtered dB/dt plots indicate that there is a 
general pattern of features that trend from the southwest to the northeast and can be grouped 
into three (3) general trend areas: West, Central and East.  The Total and Magnetic Vertical 
Gradient maps shows a similar pattern of  features trending from the southwest to the northeast. 
 
1) West Trend 
The west trend is starts within the southwestern portion of the claim area and trends along the 
entire western side of the claim area.  This trend encompasses the Zonia Mine area and would 



A R I Z O N A  G O L D  P R O P E R T I E S                                 P a g e  | 64

indicate that all of the observed mineralization are part of the same trend.  The Zonia Mine is 
part of the Zonia Mining District (1901 to 1974) with a reported production of 30.3 million 
pounds of copper, 250 oz of gold and 4,000 oz of silver.  The reported gold and silver produced 
from this area is low due to the pad leaching of the mined ores for copper.  No direct attempt for 
gold and silver recovery was made.  The Zonia Mine is currently under permit application for 
further mining activity with an estimated 15 million pounds of copper available. 
 
The southern end of this trend is covered by the apparent Rhyodacite lopolith and landslides. 
 
2) Central Trend 
The central trend extends from the southern portion of the claim area through the northern end 
of the claim area.  The southern portion of this trend is covered by apparent shallow landslides, 
basalt flows and heavy brush.  The northern portion of this trend has most of the exposed 
mineralization within the altered schist zones and includes the Silver Crown Mine area.  The 
northern portion of this trend is part of the Walnut Grove Mining District (1941 to 1964) with a 
reported production of 40,000 pounds of copper, 560,000 pounds of lead, 200 oz of gold and 
30,000 oz of silver.  Most of the production being reported from the Silver Crown Mine. 
 
3) East Trend 
The east trend is a series of features that can be broken into southern, central and northern.  The 
southern portion of this trend is covered landslides, but includes the Placerita Shaft and Mine.  
The Placerita Mine is reported to have produced mainly lead, silver and gold, but there are 
official published reports on the production.  The central area of this trend aligns with the 
granodiorite exposures on Mahoney Ridge and the apparent epidote replacements and the 
quartz/tourmaline dikes along the western side of Mahoney Ridge.   North of this central area, 
the trends are very weak and most likely reflect the downward faulting observed in this area.  
Further to the north are two features that are mainly covered with Miocene volcanic flows.  
There are several mines in this area, but no reported productions.

CONCLUSIONS 
  
From the field work to date, the following general statements and conclusions were made by 
Brian Beck PG 
 

Copper Hills Claim Area 
 
General Observations 
Most of the observed mineralized areas are within the late Cretaceous Breccia Pipes (BPs.   
The BPs within the claim area are less than 0.25km in diameter with silica replacement caps. 
All of the observed BPs have leached zones with conversions to 40% sericite. 
Expect for the southern BP within the claim area, all of the sulfide mineralization has been 
oxidized to limonite and hematite. 
The existing mine workings are in poor condition and need to be made safe per the Mine Safety 
Act (fencing, closures, etc.). 
 
Geophysical Trends 
There are three general trends within the geophysical data for the Copper Hills Area. 
Two thirds of the southern trend features appear to have been down faulted to depths between 
100 and 350 meters. The majority of the southern trend is covered with alluvium or Miocene 
volcanic flow cover. The known mining within this trend is within windows of the volcanic cover. 
The central trend has a series of observed BPs with mineralization and most of the major 
production mining within the region. There is a 3km area within the central trend that is covered 
with Miocene volcanic flows. 
The northern trend would appear not have been explored due to the lack of roads and rough 
terrain. 
 

Silver Crown Area 
 
All of the mineralized areas observed were within the Proterozoic Metavolcanics and 
Metasediments and appear to be related to the known volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits 
common to the area.   
Within the claim area, there are seven (7) different altered schist areas where mineralization 
was observed. 
The existing mine workings are in poor condition and need to be made safe per the Mine Safety 
Act (fencing, closures, etc.).

B.J.PRICE GEOLOGICAL CONSULTANTS INC.  June 2011 

Geophysical Trends 
 
There are three general trends within the geophysical data for the Silver Crown Area. 
The western trend is located along the entire western side of the claim area and includes the 
Zonia Mine.  The observed mineralization within the western trend would appear to be 
extensions of the known Zonia Mine VMS zones. 
 
The southern end of the central trend is covered by landslides and volcanic flows.  The northern 
end of this trend contains the Silver Crown Mine and most of the observed mineralized 
structures. 
 
The eastern trend can be broken into three different regions with known mining in the southern 
and northern portions.  The majority of this trend is covered with alluvium and volcanic flows. 
 
DRILLING 
 
Alliance has not completed any drilling on any of their Arizona properties, but is planning to drill 
several of the prospects in 2011, subject to financing. 

 

SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
Because of time and weather constraints, rock samples taken by the author were selected.  
These were samples of the mineralized zones generally 1-2 kilograms, taken, where possible, 
from across outcropping zones or selected from dumps.   
 
Sampling data from Ron Wells reports (2003 and 2004 are reproduced below: 
 
The 2003 sampling by Alliance was conducted during preliminary prospecting and involved chip 
and grab sampling. This was not under direct geologic supervision and sample locations are 
often approximate. Sampling by PGS involved standard chip and grab sampling with UTM 
coordinates obtained by a GPS device. Sampling in old underground workings was difficult 
because of dangerous conditions and variable surfaces. Surface outcrops and some old cuts 
were badly weathered with local slumps again making sampling difficult. 
 
The 2004 sampling program by Alliance involved rock, soil, and stream sediment sampling with 
follow-up sampling of mineralization. The object of the vein sampling was to identify gold 
mineralized areas. The sampling by Alliance, Wells, and PGS are of standard quality and the 

 
since the sampling was intended to determine the presence of anomalous metallic 
mineralization, the samplers intentionally targeted material that would likely result in higher 
concentrations of gold mineralization. Therefore, the assay results may not represent the

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
The samples were labelled with a number and remained in possession of the author until 
delivery to UPS shipping, from where they were shipped directly to ALS Chemex Laboratory in 
North Vancouver BC.  ALS Chemex (Now ALS Minerals) is an ISO Certified laboratory widely 
used by junior and international mining and exploration companies.  Neither the author nor the 
company (Alliance) have any affiliation with the laboratory.  The rock samples were analyzed by 
standard fire assay and ICP wet chemical methods, and are regarded as reliable. 
 
Sampling protocols on the latest (2007) sampling by Parkinson are reproduced below: 
 
Parkinson Geologic Services, Inc. followed the applicable Mineral Exploration Best Practices 

Guidelines recommended by the Canadian Council of Professional Geoscientists and 
established by the Mining Task force of the Toronto Stock Exchange and Ontario Securities 
Commission. The geochemical exploration samples were collected in new, clean, finely-woven, 
cloth sample bags and tightly tied to prevent contamination from external sources.  
 
Craig L. Parkinson, President of Parkinson Geologic Services and independent Qualified Person, 
either personally collected the samples or directly supervised the collection of the samples. PGS 
transported the samples directly to their office and then shipped the samples directly to Jacobs 
Assay Office, 1435 South 10th Avenue, Tucson AZ, 85713 (520-622-0813) for laboratory 
analysis. Sample security measures were exercised during sample collection, transport, 
storage, packaging, and shipment to the laboratory. 
 
PGS instructed Jacobs Assay Office to analyze for gold (Au) by fire assay and 35 trace 
elements by ICP .  
 
The sampling data from past years by KGS and PGS has been reviewed and the results from the 
properties appear to be reliable.

Zonia Mine Property 
 
The Zonia Property is approximately 140 km (88 mi) from Phoenix and 42 km (26 mi) from 
Prescott by road. The geographic coordinates of the property are Latitude 

  The property adjoins the Silver Crown property (Placerita 
South) on the southwest boundary.

exploration and development work prior to the 1960s, including the Shannon Copper Company, 
Anaconda Copper Mines and Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company,  Hammon Copper 
Company, U.S. Bureau of Mines and Gold Fields American Development Co. and Miami Copper 
Company.  
 
In 1964, McAlester Fuel Company obtained the Zonia property and carried out exploration work 
and an extensive program of short drill holes. After delineation of the Zonia copper deposit and 
favourable results of pilot leaching studies, open pit mining and heap-leaching began in 1966. 
Some 7.1 million tons was placed on three asphalt lined leach pads and leached with dilute 
sulphuric acid. From 1966 to March 1975, McAlester produced 33.3 million pounds of cement 
copper for a recovered grade of 0.23%. The copper recovery achieved is uncertain because the

In addition to the heap leaching operation, two areas containing about 7.7 million tons of 
broken material were leached in situ by McAlester for recovery of 2.7 million pounds of copper 
by 1975. 
 
After the Zonia mine production period, a number of other companies optioned or held the 
property and carried out exploration and evaluation work. 

 1971 - Homestake Mining Company 
 1977 - Phelps Dodge Corporation 
 1980 - American Selco Ltd. 
 1981 - Nerco Minerals Company 
 1982 - Queenstake Resources Ltd. 
 1983 - Antioch Resources Ltd. 
 1988 - Zonia Company 
 1993-96 - Arimetco, Inc. 

 
In 1996 Equatorial Mining North America, Inc. (Equatorial) optioned the property from the 
bankruptcy court and in 2000 to 2001 completed 18,243 ft. of reverse circulation drilling on the 
Zonia property. Mintec, Inc. estimated mineral resources and reserves based on the Equatorial 
drilling combined in a digital database with results of previous drilling, mainly 85,000 ft. of 
rotary drilling by McAlester. In 2004, St Genevieve Resourtces (SGV) purchased the property 
from the court.  The property is now owned by Redstone Resources Corporation, a private 
company based in Lakewood Colorado (previously Copper Mesa Mining Corporation and 
Ascendant Mining Corporation). 

Geology 
 
The Zonia deposit is contained with the steeply dipping Precambrian Yavapai Series, which 
consists of metamorphosed volcanic and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. The Precambrian units 
have been intruded by the quartz porphyry bodies which range in age from Mesozoic to 
Cenozoic. Portions of the area are covered by younger basalts, fanglomerates and alluvial 
material. 
 
Rocks at the Zonia Property consist of Precambrian rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks with intercalated 
andesitic rocks, all generally altered to sericite schists. They are intruded by monzogranite to 
granodiorite and by diabase dikes.  The quartz-sericite schists host the Zonia mineralization, 
which is of the porphyry copper type. Chrysocolla, malachite, azurite, melaconite and cuprite 
are the most common copper minerals. Quartz and jasper commonly accompany the ore 
minerals; oxides are ubiquitous in the mineralized zones. Oxidation has been pervasive and 
deep. The Zonia copper deposit has a northeasterly strike length of about 7,000 ft. and 
horizontal width varies from 200 ft. to 1,500 ft. It consists of one or more zones that dip at 
various angles to the northwest. The zones are generally in the order of 200 ft. wide and 
commonly occur in sub parallel groups of two or more. Most of the deposit has been drilled to 
depths of 400 ft. or less.

Current Mineral Resources 
 
No mineral reserves have been estimated on the Zonia property.   
 
Scott Wilson RPA in 2006 estimated the Mineral Resources of the Zonia copper deposit using 
the results of the previous rotary and RCD holes as  63 million tons averaging 0.37% TCu (total 
copper) at the recommended cut-off grade of 0.25% T Cu.   Scott Wilson RPA at that time 
classified all of the Zonia mineral resource as inferred since only a limited amount of verification 
had been carried out on the drill hole database.  The Scott Wilson RPA resource estimate and 
classification is in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards incorporated in NI 43-101. 
TetraTech completed a Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) on Zonia Mine for Redstone  in 
December of 2009, which determined a Measured and Indicate Resource of 30.2 million tons 
grading 0.36% copper and an additional inferred resource of 84.2 million tons of copper grading 
0.3%Cu with a 0.2%Cu cut-off. Total copper contained within these resources was estimated at 
717 million pounds of copper.  
 
The known deposit at Zonia has been defined by 646 drill holes and over 182,000 feet of rotary, 
reverse circulation and diamond core drilling. In 2009 Redstone Resources drilled an additional 
45 confirmation holes to lend further credence to the estimated deposit, and has expanded the 
deposit size. 
 
In April of 2011 Tetratech completed an updated PEA for Redstone  identifying 108.9 million 
tons of Measured and Indicated copper resource averaging 0.29% copper and 92.4 million tons 
of Inferred Copper Resource averaging 0.23% copper.   For the full report refer to the "April 
2011 Zonia Copper Project Preliminary Economic Assessment" in the Reports and Studies 
section on Redstone s website  www.zoniamine.com that has more recent information. 
 
The Placerita South claims of Alliance Mining adjoin the Zonia Mine on the south. 
 

Copper Basin 
 
The following description of Copper Basin is condensed from a paper by Johnston and Lowell in 
Economic Geology (1961).  The Copper basin property is held by Freeport McMoran and is in 
rehabilitation mode. 
 
The Copper Basin district, Yavapai County, Arizona, contains a "porphyry copper" type copper-
molybdenite deposit in which the bulk of ore mineralization appears to have been controlled by 
pipe structures. 
 
Major ore deposits of Precambrian age in nearby areas include the famous United Verde and 
United Verde Extension mines at Jerome about 25 miles to the northeast and the (currently 



A R I Z O N A  G O L D  P R O P E R T I E S                                 P a g e  | 77 
 

B.J.PRICE GEOLOGICAL CONSULTANTS INC.  June 2011 

active note 1961 reference)  Iron King mine near Humboldt, about 15 miles to the east. Bagdad, 
a porphyry copper deposit of Laramide (?) age is about 35  miles west of Copper Basin. 
Numerous smaller mines and prospects are present in widely distributed mining districts in the 
region, many of which have not been studied in detail or classified. 
 
Mineralization is associated with a composite stock of presumed Laramide age which has 
intruded older Precambrian metamorphosed sediments and intrusive rocks. The Laramide stock 
is thought to have an elongated "beet" shape with a restricted orifice at depth. Its intrusive 
units range in composition from diorite to aplite, but mineralization appears to be most closely 
associated with quartz monzonite and quartz monzonite porphyry units. Mineral deposits of 
the district have a rough zonal arrangement with copper-molybdenum mineralization in the 
center surrounded by an aureole of lead-zinc-silver occurrences. 
Mineralized breccia pipes are roughly c cylindrical, near vertical s structures Ranging in 
diameter from 50 feet to 600 feet. A composite  pipe is composed of a central core of 
heterogeneous  rotated angular to rounded rock  fragments surrounded by a zone of none-
rotated crackle breccia. The fragments are cemented by quartz and may be mineralized with 
pyrite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite. 
 
The pipes re thought to have been conduits through which late magmatic fluids, collecting near 
the restricted root of the stock ,passed upward.  An individual pipe was initiated by passage of 
fluid upward along a vertical line such as an intersection of faults or fractures. From this 
channel fluid worked into the adjacent fractured rocks and corroded fragments that were 
eventually loosened and moved in the conduit, gradually enlarging the pipe. Quartz later 
precipitated filling all of the open space and choking the conduit. Successive flexures of the 
stock or recurrent movement on regional-faults fractured this quartz in some of the pipes, and 
later hydrothermal solutions tended to follow these conduits, both because of their location on 
deep-seated structures and because the fractured quartz provided relatively high permeability. 
 
Hydrothermal solutions, preceding and accompanying ore deposition, spread outward from the 
pipes and formed overlapping aureoles of alteration.  Pyrite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite 
were deposited along fracture surfaces throughout a large area in Copper Basin, but higher 
grade mineralization was generally confined to fractured pipe structures. 
 
The Copper Basin claims are now owned by Freeport McMoran, who have completed 
environmental remediation in the area.  Numerous other pipes were seen in the area of 
Alliances claims west of Copper Basin. Alliance has three known breccia pipes on its claims 
according to  Brian Beck (2011).

The Copper Basin discussion is included because the Placerita West (Goldcop and Boston 
Arizona) claims adjoin this historically productive camp on the west, and work done recently by 
Brian Beck has shown that breccia pipes exist on the property. 
 

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING  
 
Alliance has done no mineral processing or metallurgical testing, which are premature at this 
preliminary stage of exploration. 
 

MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES  
  
There are no mineral reserves or resources on any of the Alliance properties. 

 

OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
There is undoubtedly additional historical information existent for some of the Alliance 
properties.  However, Alliance management have made a diligent effort to acquire all easily 
available data.  The author is not aware of any additional information, the absence of which 
would make this report incomplete or misleading. 
 
There are no environmental or social issues known to the author which would impede the 
project.  There may be surface rights and water rights held by ranchers and others, and access 
to some of the properties may cross ranch lands, requiring good relations. 
 

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
Alliance has completed a number of preliminary sampling programs on some of the properties, 
particularly the Placerita area properties, with previous Technical reports filed on SEDAR by the 
late Ron Wells, P.Geo. and by Craig Parkinson PG.  
 
In the late 1800s, the Placerita gold mining camp, which includes the area covered by the 
Placerita Properties, was a small Spanish community and the miners worked placer and gold 
quartz-oxide veins. There are numerous shallow underground workings dating from this period, 



A R I Z O N A  G O L D  P R O P E R T I E S                                 P a g e  | 80

including adits, shafts, and remnants of small mills and a crushing plant.  The four Placerita 
areas named Placerita North, South, West and East include the old prospects known as Boston 
Arizona, Gold Hill, Gold Pit, Gold Eagle, Gold Spring, Gold Bug and Gold Beetle, Silver Crown, 
Trails End Mine and Bodie mine. 
 
In early 2011, Alliance completed an airborne geophysical survey program over the Copper Hill 
(Boston Arizona) area adjacent to the past productive Copper Basin area now being 
rehabilitated by Freeport McMoran.  A separate survey was completed over the Silver Crown 
and Placerita South claims adjacent to the past productive Zonia mine, which has been 
described as a porphyry copper deposit but which is actually a sheared volcanogenic feeder 
zone. 
 
Both surveys outlined anomalous magnetics and Electromagnetic anomalies which need to be 
examined in more detail, preferably by a geophysicist.  An initial examination of both areas has 
now been completed by Brian Beck POG, consulting geologist for Alliance. 
 
The author has compiled considerable historical material and combined with the previous work 
done by Alliance, additional work recommended is compilation,  geological mapping , target 
generation and comprehensive exploration programs on the two key areas, Copper Hill 
(Placerita West) and Silver Crown (Placerita South).  The Bodie and Trails end properties 
represent good gold and silver targets respectively but have not had any recent geological work 
and geological mapping and target generation arte required. Some of the lower priority 
properties with gold targets and drill permits in place may be suitable for farming out to other 
junior companies. 
 
In all, the property package includes some worthwhile prospects, worthy of additional work 
with the goal of generating a number of drill targets. 
 
A budget of $750,000, including contingencies has been proposed in two phases, the drill stage 
being contingent on favourable results in Phase 1.

RECOMMENDATIONS  
 

1. At present there is a scarcity of target maps for each of the properties, claim maps 
showing claim names, geological maps for each of the prospects 

2. A composite base map showing all claim boundaries on a topographic base map or 
orthophoto is recommended, as well as working base maps for each prospect. 

3. Geological mapping is needed at each prospect to identify prospective drill areas 
4. At present, the priority prospects, not necessarily in order are 

a. Silver Crown property 
b. Copper Hill copper property 
c. Trails End gold property 
d. Bodie silver-lead property 

5. At the Silver Crown and adjacent Placerita claims, a comprehensive grid-based 
exploration program is suggested. Geological mapping, soil sampling and ground 
magnetometer, and EM, possibly even IP is recommended. 

6. Similarly for the Copper Hill properties including Gold Hill and Boston Arizona, 
comprehensive mapping programs are required with the goal of defining drill targets.  

Sampling is required to define the size and grade of these pipes, prior to any drill plans. 
7. The Trails End mine has reported high grade gold; the property needs geological 

mapping and drill target preparation. 
8. Similarly for the Bodie mine where silver values are reported, almost no current 

geological observations are available; the property requires a comprehensive mapping 
program. 

9. Other properties are accorded lower priority and all require geological mapping and 
target evaluation.  Lowest priority not necessarily in order would be Gold Pit Gold Eagle 
and Gold Spring. 

10. Offsetting the Gold Pit and Gold Eagle priorities to some extent is the drill permits held 
for these two areas. 

11. For this reason, the two above properties might be suitable for a farm out to another 
public company for earn in with drilling.  Some mapping and prioritization of targets will 
be required prior to this. 

12. The geophysical data generated by the airborne survey should be reviewed by a 
qualified and experienced geophysicist for specific recommendations. 

13. Extension of the surveys, preferably by ground methods is suggested for the Bodie and 
Trails End properties. 

14. Following the above work, the properties  may  be suitable for individual comprehensive 
reports. 

15. Other worthwhile properties may exist in this heavily mineralized but underexplored 
belt.
