1 SUMMARY 

Introduction 

On February 14, 2017, Northern Empire Resources Corp. ("Northern Empire") contracted Norwest 

Corporation ("Norwest") to complete a resource estimate on the Sterling Property, which 

included the deposits in the Sterling area, as well as the Daisy, Secret Pass, and Sunday Night 

Anomaly (SNA) deposits. This resource estimate is included in this Technical Report, which has 

been prepared in accordance with the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects. On February 15, 2017, Northern Empire announced that it had 

entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire a 100% interest in the Sterling Property from Sterling 

Gold Mining Corporation ("SGMC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Metals Corporation 

("Imperial"), for a price of US$10,000,000. On April 3, 2017, Northern Empire announced that that 

Letter of Intent been modified such that there was now an irrevocable exclusivity period and the 

purchase price had been increased by US$100,000. 

Norwest personnel included Derek Loveday, Sean Ennis, and Allan Turner, all of which are 

Qualified Persons on this project and inspected the deposits in the Sterling area on February 21, 

2017. Derek Loveday and Allan Turner completed inspections of the deposits in the North Block 

on February 22, 2017. The Effective Date of this Technical Report in March 29, 2017. 

Sources of Information 

Information and data provided by Northern Empire were used as the basis for estimating gold 

resources within the Sterling Property. Norwest did not conduct field work, other than a site visit, 

and did not independently drill, complete geophysical logs on drill holes, or collect and analyze 

samples. The provided technical data has been validated for errata prior to modeling. Northern 

Empire provided Norwest with exploration sample data, geologic models, internal technical 

reports, underground survey data and surface topography data. 

Property Description and Location 

The Sterling Property covers 14,109 acres (5,710 hectares) on the east side of the Bare Mountain 

range in Nye County, southern Nevada, U.S.A.  The Sterling Property is located 185 km northwest 

of Las Vegas, (Figure 1-1). The Bare Mountain Range is bounded to the east by Crater Flat and the 

northern Amargosa Desert to the south. It is located at the southern end of Pahute Mesa, in the 

Great Basin watershed. Bare Mountain is part of the southern Walker Lane.

Mineral Tenure 

The Sterling Property is 100% owned by Imperial of Vancouver, Canada, through its wholly-owned 

U.S. subsidiary SGMC. The Sterling Property is subject to a 2.25% Net Smelter Return royalty, on 

certain claims as shown in Figure 1-2. 

On February 14, 2017, Northern Empire entered into a letter of intent with SGMC to acquire a 

100% interest in the Sterling Property, located in Nye County, Nevada. 

The Sterling Property consists of four mining claim blocks: 

• Sterling – comprised of 272 unpatented lode mining claims and one millsite water well 

claim; 

• Daisy-Fluorspar Canyon - comprised of 361 unpatented lode mining claims; 

• Mary-Goldspar – comprised of 17 unpatented lode mining claims; and 

• Tungsten Canyon – comprised of 57 unpatented lode mining claims. 

 

The four claim blocks have a total of 707 unpatented mining claims; which cover about 14,109 

acres (5,710 hectares).  

The land is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under the terms of the 

Mining Act of 1872 and subsequent amendments. The claims are recorded in the Nye County 

Recorder's Office in the Court House in Tonopah, Nevada and the Nevada State Office of the BLM 

in Reno. The annual BLM fees are $144 per claim, and are due on September 1. At the time of 

writing, the claims were in good standing. Annual rental fees are to be paid to the BLM, under a 

Notice of Intent to Hold Mining Claims, along with a registration fee that is filed annually at the 

Nye County Recorder's Office.

Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

The Sterling Property is located at an elevation of approximately 4,000 feet (1,219 m), on the 

lower and eastern slopes of Bare Mountain. The Sterling Mine and infrastructure are at 

approximately 4,100 feet (1,250 m) elevation.  

The Sterling Property is accessible by road from Las Vegas, approximately 115 miles (185 km) via 

U.S. Highway 95.  A well maintained eight-mile (13 km) gravel road turns off the north side of 

Highway 95 at mile 45.9. 

The climate in the region is arid, characterized by very hot summers and mild winters; 

temperatures normally range from 110°F (43°C) in the summer to 30°F (-1°C) in the winter. 

Infrastructure consists of an Underground Operations and Maintenance area adjacent to the 144 

Zone portal that was used to support the underground mining of the 144 Zone Deposit. The area 

includes a drying room, an office trailer/lunchroom and covered concrete slab for maintenance 

work on the underground equipment. 

History 

Deposits in the Sterling Mining Area 

The Sterling mining area, formerly the Panama Mine (also Bittlecomb Shaft), operated 

intermittently between 1906 and 1940. Historic records indicate that the breccia zone averaged 

0.400 oz/ton (13.7 g/t) gold, while footwall rocks averaged 0.040 oz/ton (1.37 g/t) gold (Gillstrom, 

2006).   

Between 1940 and 1970 there was limited work completed in the Sterling area (Smithies et al., 

2015). Cordilleran Exploration staked and drilled the Sterling claims in 1973. The company 

continue to map, drill, and sample the Sterling claims until 1977.  

The Sterling Mine Joint Venture (SMJV) was formed in 1980 that was comprised of Saga, E&B 

Explorations Inc., Derry Michener Booth Venture Number 1, and the Geomex Partnership. The 

SMJV was formed after receiving positive results from testing the exposed zone for heap leaching.  

The SMJV began mining the Sterling Deposit in April 1980, and conducted its first gold pour on 

July 1, 1980 (Smithies et al., 2015).  



 
 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-6 

Total gold production from the Sterling Mine between 1980 and 2000 was 194,996 troy ounces 

from 941,341 short tons (853,984 tonnes) of ore (see Note 1 below), with an average gold grade 

of 0.217 oz/ton (7.44 g/t). Recoveries averaged 88% without milling (Gillstrom, 2006).1 

Although the Sterling Mine was not in operation from 2000 to 2012, exploration continued.  Most 

the exploration that was completed on the Sterling claims concentrated on the 144 Zone, 

although some drilling was completed on the Panama Zone.  

North Block Deposits  

Gold prospecting in the Fluorspar Canyon area was active in 1905 (Marr, 2006). A camp was 

implemented at Telluride in 1905; however, this venture did not survive the year. Fluorite was 

discovered in 1916 by J. Irving Crowell in the Fluorspar Canyon that developed into the Daisy 

(Crowell) Mine that operated continuously from 1918 to 1986, and produced 250,000 tons of 

fluorite (Marr, 2006). Cordex and Gexa discovered seven gold deposits along the Fluorspar 

Canyon, which include; The Canyon, West, South, Enif Trench, Secret Pass, Mother Lode, and SNA 

areas, all of which occur proximal to the Fluorspar Canyon Detachment Fault that juxtaposed 

Paleozoic and Tertiary rocks in the Fluorspar Canyon (Marr, 2006; Greybeck and Wallace, 1991). 

The Secret Pass, South and West Zones (Daisy), and SNA deposits comprise the North Block 

deposits that are identified as containing significant mineralization.   

Geological Setting and Mineralization 

The deposits on the Sterling Property are typical of sedimentary and volcanic-hosted gold deposits 

in the western U.S., particularly in the Great Basin in Nevada. These deposits include sediment-

hosted, disseminated precious metal deposits; known as Carlin-type deposits, as well as 

epithermal-style deposits hosted in volcanics (Teal and Jackson, 1997). 

From oldest to youngest, stratified rock units on the Sterling Property range from the Upper 

Proterozoic to Ordovician part of the stratigraphic section. The host rocks of the 144 Zone 

mineralization span the bottom of the Bonanza King Formation and the top of the Carrara 

Formation. The South and West Zones (Daisy Deposit) are in the Cambrian Carbonate rocks and 

the Secret Pass Zone is in the Miocene ash-flow tuff (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991).

Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-7 

The Sterling deposits, which include the Sterling, Burro, Ambrose, Water Tank Hill, and Panama, 

occurred mainly at and below the Sterling Thrust contact between the Wood Canyon (above the 

thrust) and Bonanza King formations, and locally along the Burro fault. The main mineralized 

zones generally form longitudinal 'pipes' along the thrust, following the intersections between 

minor NNE-trending high-angle faults and the thrust. 

Gold mineralization in the North Block deposits are hosted by Tertiary volcanics and Paleozoic-

aged rocks. The Secret Pass Deposit is in Tertiary volcanics, while the Shear Zone, South and West 

Zones (Daisy), and SNA deposits are in altered Paleozoic-aged carbonates (Marr, 2006).  

The West Zone of the Daisy Deposit is hosted by limestone of the Nopah Formation – Halfpint 

Member (Marr, 2006). The highest gold values are associated with intense silicification, fluorite, 

and iron oxide. The mineralized intervals commonly contain arsenic, antimony, mercury, thallium. 

A low angle fault forms the footwall (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991).  

The South Zone of the Daisy Deposit is hosted by silty limestones and calcareous siltstones of the 

Carrara Formation. Mineralized intervals in this zone are characterized by weak decalcification 

and increased pyrite.  

The Secret Pass Zone gold mineralization occurs within Miocene ash-flow tuffs that have 

undergone propylitization, argillization, and silicification. Secret Pass has anomalous 

concentrations of arsenic, antimony, mercury and thallium.  Silver is also associated with the gold 

but in low concentrations of 4 Au: 1 Ag.  

Exploration and Drilling 

Deposits in the Sterling Area (Sterling Deposit) 

Between 1973 and 2015, 1,491 core and RC holes were drilled on the deposits in the Sterling area 

(Table 1.1). Most of the post-2000 drilling on the Sterling claims focussed on the 144 Zone.

at 527550E/4081800N, and a southwest corner at 526500E/4080700N (NAD 83, Zone 11). As the 

purpose of the sampling program was to independently assess the presence of gold in the host 

rocks,  the  collected  samples  were  biased  to  altered  rocks  (i.e.  silicified  or  gossanous)  that 

commonly  were  associated  with  structures  such  as  sheared  intervals.  As  such,  the  spacing 

between the samples varied from metre‐scale to 0.5 km spacing.  

Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

Much of the detailed documentation of the assays used for the underground  infill samples has 

been lost; however, most of the actual underground drill and sample locations and assay values 

were preserved on the 50 different level drawings. These level plans were all scanned to make 

`jpg` pictures; then digitized in AutoCAD as 2D vector CAD files; then imported into MineSight®3D, 

to create a full three‐dimensional wire frame Model of all the old workings at the Sterling Mine. 

Historic  samples  (pre‐2000)  used  in  the  resource  calculations  presented  in  this  report were 

analyzed on site at the original Sterling Mine  lab. As mentioned above and  in the next section, 

most of the original paper assay records have been lost. The historical report titled "Development 

Plan Sterling Mine, Nevada" Swallow (1998) states: 

"All drill hole samples, face samples, and rib samples are assayed by atomic absorption method 

in the mine lab. High grade drill hole samples are sent to commercial labs for fire assays. The mine 

has produced reliable and consistent  results over  the past eighteen years as verified by check 

assays from independent labs." 

Between  February  19  and  21,  2017,  geological  staff  from Northern  Empire  collected  20  rock 

samples from the Fluorspar Canyon area near the Daisy deposits. Rock chip samples were taken 

from 19 of the locations, while Sample 256279 was taken from material that was not in situ. An 

appropriate  amount  of  sample  was  collected  from  each  sample  location.  Each  sample  was 

described,  given  an  independent  sample  identification  number,  and  the  coordinates  of  each 

sample  location  in NAD  83,  Zone  11 was  recorded. All  samples were directly  transported  by 

Northern Empire personnel to ALS Minerals in Reno, Nevada, which is an independent certified 

laboratory. 

Data Verification 

Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the open pit deposits at the Sterling mine site on February 21 

and 23, 2017. Norwest Qualified Persons located in the field and verified the locations of collar 

locations at Water Tank Hill and in the 144 Zone area. Host rocks and the alteration assemblage 

that is associated with the Sterling Deposit is consistent with those of typical Carlin‐style deposits.  

In addition, the faults observed at the Sterling Deposit align with those previously recorded at the 

mine site. 



 
 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-11 

Norwest Qualified Persons also reviewed the core boxes that contained the core that was drilled 

on the Sterling Property in 2013 and 2014 as part of the "SU" series drill campaign, and verified 

the presence of alteration that aligned with that described at the Sterling Deposit. The core is 

housed in a storage facility at the Sterling Mine site office complex.  In addition to examination of 

the 2013 and 2014 drill core, assay certificates and representative samples from the Sterling 

deposits, analysed during the 2011 program, were verified to be stored at the storage facility at 

the Sterling Mine site office complex.  Laboratory assay certificates from 2006 to 2009 were 

available in excel spreadsheet format, and were spot checked by Norwest Qualified Persons to 

verify the accuracy of the geochemical data included in the Sterling model. 

Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the Secret Pass open pit on February 22, 2017. The location 

of four drill collars were located in the vicinity of the open pit.  Alteration and host rock mineralogy 

was examined by the Norwest Qualified Persons from rocks collected from the Secret Pass 

Deposit, which supported that the Secret Pass Deposit has characteristics of an epithermal-style 

deposit.  

Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the existing Daisy open pit mine workings on February 22, 

2017. The host rocks and mineralization in the vicinity of the Daisy Deposit area were examined 

and aligned with the interpretation that the host rocks in the vicinity of the Daisy Deposit 

supported the deposit being a Carlin-style.  

Sunday Night Anomaly Deposit: Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the proposed location of the 

Sunday Night Anomaly Deposit on February 22, 2017.  

On February 23, 2017, Norwest's Qualified Persons located and reviewed chip sample trays from 

holes drilled on the Beatty Volcanics Project in January 1982, and on the Fluorspar Canyon Project 

in 1985. The core is housed in a storage facility at the Sterling Mine site office complex. 

Limitations to Data Validation by Qualified Person 

Sterling Deposit 

Sampling protocol, sample chain of custody, original geological descriptive logs, and the original 

assay certificates could not be located for samples analysed pre-2000, most of which were 

analysed at the on-site Sterling Mine Laboratory. As such, the quality of the pre-2000 analysed 

from the Sterling Mine laboratory could not be validated.

North Block Deposits 

With exception of the chip boards that were collected during the 1982 and 1985 drilling 

campaigns, no additional original datasets were accessible to Norwest's Qualified Persons. 

It is the Norwest's Qualified Person's opinion that the data provided to Norwest is adequate for 

the purposes used in this Technical Report. 

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Production at the Sterling Mine has shown, through historical operations, that the mineralized 

rock is amenable to cyanide leaching using heap leach technology. The Sterling Mine was in 

operation from 1980 through 2002. Mineralized rock mined from underground and open pit 

sources was hauled to a 27-acre lined heap leach pad, stacked and leached with a cyanide 

solution. The mined material was placed at its run of mine size gradation without primary or 

secondary crushing. 

With over 20 years of actual heap leach results, it was deemed not necessary to conduct any new 

metallurgical tests on the gold mineralization associated with the Sterling deposits.  

Metallurgical testing confirmed that the Sterling Mine mineralized rock was amenable to cyanide 

leaching using heap leach technology. The main reagents used are sodium cyanide and lime. The 

test work reported that 0.25 pounds of cyanide per ton of rock is required and 3 pounds of lime 

per ton of rock. 

Mineral Resource Estimates 

In accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards, Qualified Persons employed at Norwest validated 

the drill hole and sample data set, and created geologic models for the purposes of generating 

resource estimates within the area encompassing the North Block deposits and Sterling Property.  

Information used to compile the geologic models used for resource estimation included the 

following information provided by Northern Empire: 

• exploration sample data; 

• geologic models; 

• underground survey data; 

• internal technical reports; and  

• surface topography data.  

 



 
 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-13 

Norwest independent geologic models used for gold resource estimation were constructed using 

MineSight® (v11.00-1) software using 3D block modeling methods. The model dimensions and 

extent are outlined in Figure 1-3. All models were constructed using the Sterling Mine grid 

coordinate system that uses imperial units. Original work by Norwest in the construction of the 

geologic models is limited to:  

• 3D block models covering pit areas and mineralized zones identified from provided drill 

hole records and solids of the mineralized intervals; 

• independent geostatistical analysis of the sample data and estimation algorithms; and  

• construction of Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) pit shells using independently assessed mining

Prior to modeling the provided exploration and sampling data was checked for errata. This 

included, but was not limited to, the following checks: 

• anomalous drill hole collar locations in undisturbed areas; 

• overlapping sample intervals; 

• outliers in grade and thickness; and  

• lithologic and grade matching provided mineralization solids.   

Mineral Resource Estimates 

Tables 1.5 through Table 1.8 outline the gold resource estimates for the Sterling Deposit and 

North Block deposits. The resource estimates are based on pit constrained surface resources (note 

– Sterling Deposit includes discussion of potential incremental tonnage below resource pit shell 

as discussed below). The surface resource includes mineralized gold blocks limited to within a 45-

degree constant slope pit shell.  All resource estimates include estimates of contained ounces 

within the constrained pit shells as discussed in Section 14.  Table 1.9 summarizes the base case 

gold resources for each of the deposit areas in imperial and metric units. 

Modifying factors considered for the definition of mineralized zones into classified resources of 

eventual economic interest include the following: 

• Metallurgical recovery factors ranging from 80 – 88% depending on rock type for 

conventional heap leach operations. 

• Gold price of $1,200 per ounce. 

• Allowance for dilution and mining losses in the calculation of the cut-off grade. 

• Mining costs of $2.10/ton mined and combined leaching, site costs and overhead of 

approximately $3/ton placed on the leach pad. 

• Refining and royalty costs of $16/oz with a payable metal factor of approximately 97%. 

 

For the Sterling Deposit, resources defined as "non-pit constrained" represent mineralized 

tonnages of potential economic interest if selective underground mining of mineralized zone 

below the projected pit shell limits was carried out.  If underground mining methods, similar to 

those employed previously at Sterling Mine were utilized subsequent to surface mining, a cutoff 

grade of 0.05 oz per tonne could be supported (based on mining costs of $45/ton). 

Note – The base case for the Inferred Resource for each deposit is indicated by shading and bold 

type face in the respective tables.

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-21 

The accuracy of resource estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of available 

data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at 

the time; the estimates presented herein are considered reasonable. However, they should be 

accepted with the understanding that additional data and analysis available after the date of the 

estimates may necessitate revision. These revisions may be material.  

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources 

will ultimately be reclassified as Proven or Probable reserves.  Mineral resources which are not 

mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

Mineral Reserve Estimates 

This Technical Report does not include an estimate of reserves. The available exploration data is 

not sufficient to support the preparation of a Pre-Feasibility Study; therefore, in accordance with 

the requirements of National Instrument 43-101, the reported resources cannot be classified as 

reserves. 

Mining Methods 

The Sterling Mine utilized a combination of open pit truck-shovel and underground mining 

methods. The Secret Pass and Daisy deposits had also been mined by surface methods.  The North 

Block deposit pits have been analyzed from an open pit mining perspective and are amenable to 

being mined as a conventional open pit mining operation.  For the purposes of this report, it is 

assumed that similar methods would be utilized. 

Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 

There are no known ongoing environmental issues with any of the regulatory agencies. An 

environmental assessment was recently completed for the Project. Results indicate limited 

biological and cultural issues, air quality impacts appear to be within State of Nevada standards, 

traffic and noise issues are present but at low levels, and socioeconomic impacts are positive. 

The Project has the four major permits required to operate the Project as planned. The amended 

Plan of Operations for the BLM was approved on May 12, 2016. The necessary bonding for 

implementation of this permit still needs to be placed with the BLM. Bonding is further discussed 

within the report. The amended WPCP was approved on October 23, 2015. The permit expires on 

March 15, 2018. Therefore, a renewal application must be submitted to the Bureau of Mining 

Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) in early September 2017 in order for the permit to remain in 

effect during the renewal process. The Nevada Reclamation Permit for the Project was issued in 

2007 and is good for the life of the Project; however, it appears that permit has not been amended 

to incorporate the new mining and heap leach facility. This is because the amount for the bonding 

has not be finalized between the BMRR/BLM and the operator. The air quality operating permit 



 
 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-22 

was issued on June 16, 2014 and expires June 16, 2019. A renewal application must be submitted 

in early April 2019 in order for the permit to remain active during the renewal process. 

There are no known social or community issues that would have a material impact on the Project's 

ability to extract mineral resources. Identified socioeconomic issues (employment, payroll, 

services and supply purchases, and state and local tax payments) are anticipated to be positive.  

Interpretations and Conclusions 

Four gold deposits are identified on the Sterling Property. These deposits are Sterling, Daisy, 

Secret Pass and SNA. The Daisy, Secret Pass and SNA deposits are located north of the Sterling 

Deposit and are collectively called the North Block deposits. The Sterling, Daisy, and Secret Pass 

deposits were previously mined. Sterling, Daisy and SNA are carbonate-hosted and classified as 

Carlin-type deposits, while Secret Pass is volcanic-hosted and classified as an epithermal deposit. 

Gold mineralization is concentrated along faults or is aligned with the regional structural fabric.   

The available data for these deposits is sufficient to support an Inferred gold mineral resource 

within each deposit. These resources have been classified as Inferred due to lack of 

documentation for a substantial amount of the historical sampling and assay programs. Much of 

available data was collected between 1980 to 1997, before the current stringent quality control 

standards were implemented for resource reporting.  

Resource estimates are separated into two categories, namely pit constrained surface resources 

and remaining non-pit constrained resources below. The surface resource includes the gold 

resource limited to within a 45-degree constant slope pit shell whose limits are defined by fixed 

gold price of US$1,200 per ounce and mining cost of US$2.10 per ton (US$2.31 per tonne) and 

gold recoveries in the range of 80 – 88% (dependent upon rock type and particle size).  Only pit 

constrained resources are reported for the North Block deposits.  All resource estimates include 

estimates of contained ounces within the constrained pit shells.   

The Sterling Deposit contains both pit constrained and non-pit constrained resources.  The Sterling 

Deposit non-pit constrained resources have been defined based on underground mining methods 

similar to those previously used at Sterling Mine using a cutoff grade of 0.05opt based on a 

US$45/ton mining cost.   

Potential risks that impact the accuracy of the Inferred gold resource estimate include: 

• Much of the available data was collected between 1980 and 1997, before the current 

stringent quality control standards were required for resource reporting.  



 
 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 1-23 

• The accuracy of the underground excavation survey data impacting the Sterling resource 

cannot be directly measured since these galleries are no longer accessible due to safety 

concerns and/or they may have collapsed.  

• North Block resource estimates are based on grade trends observed in the provided assay 

data only. These grade trends are associated with structural features and lithologies not 

recorded in sufficient detail in the available exploration data as of the effective date of 

the resource estimate. 

Recommendations 

Resource confidence for the Sterling and North Block deposits can be improved to Measured and 

Indicated status from the current Inferred level of assurance, by implementing confirmatory and 

infill drilling, sampling and through use of higher resolution topographic information.  A viable 

topographic survey method is Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey.  Classification as 

measured and indicated resources would support potential reserves definition once pre-

feasibility level evaluation was completed. 

Table 1.10 shows an estimate of what is required to increase the level of assurance in accordance 

with CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines. The 

proposed method of drilling would include both core and RC holes.

Implementation of the above recommended program will provide the following material benefits: 

• Twinned samples will be fire assayed by independent certified laboratories to assess the 

accuracy of the Atomic Absorption assay method that is implemented at Sterling Mine.

• Twinning of historical holes and comparison of assay and lithologic records to assess the 

accuracy of historical records. 

• Infill coring and RC drilling will provide the structural, lithologic and grade for better 

refinement of the North Block deposit mineralization models. 

• Metallurgical testing will provide additional information to refine gold recovery methods. 

• Completion of a LiDAR survey will help identify and reconcile natural soil/waste 

movement overlying the current resource areas that may be material to the estimate. In 

addition, a LiDAR survey can help to identify potential fault locations.

2 INTRODUCTION 

On February 14, 2017, Northern Empire Resources Corp. ("Northern Empire") contracted Norwest 

Corporation ("Norwest") to complete a resource estimate on the Sterling Property, which 

included the Sterling deposits, as well as the Daisy, Secret Pass, and Sunday Night Anomaly (SNA) 

deposits. The Sterling Property is located in Nye County, Nevada. This resource estimate is 

included in this Technical Report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements 

of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  

On February 15, 2017, Northern Empire announced that it had entered into a Letter of Intent to 

acquire a 100% interest in the Sterling Property from Sterling Gold Mining Corporation ("SGMC"), 

a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Metals Corporation ("Imperial") for a price of 

US$10,000,000.  On April 3, 2017, Northern Empire announced that that Letter of Intent had been 

modified to include an irrevocable exclusivity period and the purchase price had been increased 

by US$100,000. 

Information and data provided by Northern Empire were used as the basis for estimating gold 

resources within the Sterling Property. Norwest did not conduct field work, other than a site visit, 

and did not independently drill, complete geophysical logs on drill holes, or collect and analyse 

samples. The provided technical data has been validated for errata prior to modeling. Northern 

Empire provided Norwest with exploration sample data, geologic models, internal technical 

reports, underground survey data and surface topography data. 

Norwest Corporation personnel included Derek Loveday, Sean Ennis, and Allan Turner, all of which 

are Qualified Persons on this project and inspected the deposits in the Sterling Mine area on 

February 21, 2017. Derek Loveday and Allan Turner completed inspections of the deposits in the 

North Block on February 22, 2017. The Effective Date of this Technical Report in March 29, 2017. 

The accuracy of resource and reserve estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity 

of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.  Given the data 

available at the time this report was prepared, the estimates presented herein are considered 

reasonable.  However, they should be accepted with the understanding that additional data and 

analysis available subsequent to the date of the estimates may necessitate revision.  These 

revisions may be material.

The following text used material presented in the internal report titled "Sterling Gold Mine, 

Nye County Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling, January 21, 2015. 

4.1 Description and Location 

The Sterling Property covers 14,109 acres (5,710 hectares) on the east side of the Bare 

Mountain range in Nye County, southern Nevada, U.S.A. The Sterling Property is located 185 

km northwest of Las Vegas, (Figure 4-1). The Bare Mountain Range is bounded to the east by 

Crater Flat and the northern Amargosa Desert to the south. It is located at the southern end 

of Pahute Mesa, in the Great Basin watershed. Bare Mountain is part of the southern Walker 

Lane.   

The Sterling Property is in Townships 12 and 13 South and Ranges 47 and 48 East, and is at 

latitude 36°49'40"N and longitude 116°38'00"W. The UTM coordinates are 532000E, 

4075000N, Zone 11N. Sterling has operated as an open pit and underground operation in the 

past, complete with surface facilities, which have been permitted. Access to the Sterling 

Property is through country maintained roads. 

4.2 Mineral Tenure 

The Sterling Property is 100% owned by Imperial of Vancouver, Canada, through its wholly-

owned U.S. subsidiary SGMC. The Sterling Property is subject to a 2.25% Net Smelter Return 

royalty, on certain claims, as noted in Section 4.4 and shown in Figure 4-2. 

On February 14, 2017, Northern Empire entered into a letter of intent with SGMC to acquire 

a 100% interest in the Sterling Property, located in Nye County, Nevada. 

The Sterling Property consists of four mining claim blocks:

The four claim blocks have a total of 707 unpatented mining claims; which cover about 14,109 

acres (5,710 hectares). A detailed list of all the mining claims, as provided by Imperial on 

September 26, 2016, is presented in Table 4.1. 

The land is administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under the terms of 

the Mining Act of 1872 and subsequent amendments. The claims are recorded in the Nye 

County Recorder's Office in the Court House in Tonopah, Nevada and the Nevada State Office 

of the BLM in Reno. The annual BLM fees are $144 per claim, and are due on September 1. At 

the time of writing, the claims were in good standing. Annual rental fees are to be paid to the 

BLM, under a Notice of Intent to Hold Mining Claims, along with a registration fee that is filed 

annually at the Nye County Recorder's Office.

4.3 Legal Survey of Property 

At the time of writing, Carlin Trend Mining Services, located in Elko, Nevada, is conducting a 

ground survey diligence of Imperial's mining claims.  The gold mineralization responsible for 

the resource estimates outlined in Section 14 falls primarily within the current Sterling 

Property claims boundaries. Northern Empire is currently completing a title opinion on the 

Sterling Property. 

4.4 Royalties and Other Encumbrances 

Lands affected or controlled by Sterling are under the jurisdiction of the United States Federal 

Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Las Vegas Field Office and the Tonopah Field Office. 

The mineral rights to the Sterling Property are 100% owned by Imperial through its wholly 

owned U.S. subsidiary SGMC, subject to a 2.25% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty on certain 

claims. The NSR is payable to Saga Exploration Company (2%) and Franco Nevada U.S. 

Corporation (0.25%), and is illustrated on Figure 4-2. Permitting and Environmental Liabilities 

EM Strategies, Inc., a permit acquisition strategy and government relations consulting firm, 

provided the following information on environmental considerations, permitting, and social 

and community impacts. 

4.4.1 Introduction 

Historically, gold-bearing rock was produced both by underground and open pit mining 

methods and processed by heap leaching technology from December 1980 until suspension 

of operations in April 2003. Exploration activities identified an underground gold deposit 

(referred to as the 144 Zone) and the permits were modified for the development and 

exploitation of this deposit, with approvals in November 2011. Since that time, the 

underground 144 Zone of the Sterling Mine was developed, the heap leach facility was 

expanded, and a new gold recovery plant was installed. 

The Sterling Mine is operated under Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Plan of Operations 

N-71676 (Plan), Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) Bureau of Mining 

Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) Reclamation Permit 0065, and NDEP Water Pollution 

Control Permit (WPCP) number: NEV0089016. 

The current existing disturbance for the Sterling Mine area is 162.8 acres (including 

exploration activities). All existing disturbance is on public lands administered by the BLM.

4.4.2 Permit Summary 

The Project has the four major permits required to operate the Project as planned. The 

amended Plan of Operations for the BLM was approved on May 12, 2016. The necessary 

bonding for implementation of this permit still needs to be placed with the BLM. Bonding is 

further discussed below. The amended WPCP was approved on October 23, 2015. The permit 

expires on March 15, 2018. Therefore, a renewal application must be submitted to the Bureau 

of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR) in early September 2017 in order for the 

permit to remain in effect during the renewal process. The Nevada Reclamation Permit for 

the Project was issued in 2007 and is good for the life of the Project; however, it appears that 

permit has not been amended to incorporate the new mining and heap leach facility. This is 

because the amount for the bonding has not be finalized between the BMRR/BLM and the 

operator. The air quality operating permit was issued on June 16, 2014 and expires June 16, 

2019. A renewal application must be submitted in early April 2019 in order for the permit to 

remain active during the renewal process. 

4.4.3 Mercury Operating Permit 

No mercury permits have been issued for the Project. Therefore, a refinery cannot be 

operated. Currently, there is no refinery on the Project. If at a point in the future a refinery is 

needed for operations, then acquisition of the permit would take between six months and 

one year. 

4.4.4 Other Permits 

In addition to the principal environmental permits outlined above, Table 4.3 lists other 

notifications or ministerial permits that may likely be necessary to operate the Project. At this 

time, it is unknown if these notifications and ministerial permits have been obtained.

4.5 Environmental Study Results and Known Issues 

As previously outlined, the Sterling Mine has been in place for over 30 years. There are no 

known ongoing environmental issues with any of the regulatory agencies. An environmental 

assessment was recently completed for the Project. Results indicate limited biological and

Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 4-20 

cultural issues, air quality impacts appear to be within State of Nevada standards, traffic and 

noise issues are present but at low levels, and socioeconomic impacts are positive. 

4.6 Waste Disposal, Monitoring, Water Management  

Waste rock characterization has been conducted on the Project and results indicate that the 

waste rock and mineralized intervals are generally non-reactive, are not acid generating, and 

do not leach metals. As a result, waste rock management is expected to be by random 

placement with only quarterly sampling of the placed materials. 

4.7 Social and Community Issues 

Social and community impacts have been and are being considered and evaluated for the 

various plan amendments performed for the Project in accordance with the National 

Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other federal laws. Potentially affected Native American 

tribes, tribal organizations and/or individuals are consulted during the preparation of all plan 

amendments to advise on the proposed Projects that may have an effect on cultural sites, 

resources, and traditional activities. 

There are no known social or community issues that would have a material impact on the 

Project's ability to extract mineral resources. Identified socioeconomic issues (employment, 

payroll, services and supply purchases, and state and local tax payments) are anticipated to 

be positive.  

4.8 Mine Closure and Bonding 

A Final Plan for Permanent Closure (FPPC) for the Project was submitted to the BMRR with 

the WPCP application for the existing portions of the site in 2003. As described in the FPPC, 

the proposed heap leach closure approach consisted of fluid management through 

evaporation and then covering the heaps with waste rock and growth media and then 

revegetating. The FPPC does not address any residual heap drainage that should be expected 

and will be managed with evaporation cells. This will require an amendment to the WPCP 

when the new heap leach pad nears the end of its operational life. Waste Rock dumps and 

other facilities would be regraded, covered with growth media and revegetated. The closure 

scenario for the heap leach pads will result in conditions that will likely require long-term 

management of the evaporation cells and associated ancillary facilities at the site, which will 

require a financial instrument to cover those cost into the future.  



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 4-21 

 

The current bond at the Project is approximately $3,262,419, which covers the current 

facilities on the Project. According to BMRR, approximately $4,125,548 in additional bonding 

is needed to commence construction of the expanded operations of the Sterling Gold Mine, 

for a total reclamation bond of approximately $7,387,967. It should be noted that the costs 

to complete the reclamation, as outlined in the reclamation costs estimate for the bonds is 

approximately 35 percent less than the bond amount, due to the regulatory agency's markups 

and overhead. In addition, the actual costs for the Sterling Mine to implement their 

reclamation would likely be even less than those outlined in the reclamation cost estimate.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The following text used material presented in the internal report titled "Sterling Gold Mine, 

Nye County Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling, January 21, 2015. 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The Sterling Property is located at an elevation of approximately 4,000 feet (1,219 m), on the 

lower and eastern slopes of Bare Mountain. The Sterling Mine and infrastructure are at 

approximately 4,100 feet (1,250 m) elevation. The present leach pad is on the upper edge of 

the adjacent pediment 3,800 feet (1,158 m). The local terrain is characterized by rounded or 

craggy ridges separated by ephemeral, gravel-filled washes. Several small cinder cones, about 

one million years old, occur in Crater Flat, located about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) east-southeast of 

the mine. 

5.2 Property Access and Proximity to Population Centers 

The Sterling Property is accessible by road from Las Vegas, approximately 115 miles (185 km) 

via U.S. Highway 95. A well maintained eight-mile (13 km) gravel road turns off the north side 

of Highway 95 at mile 45.9, as shown on Figure 4-1. The gravel road is maintained by Nye 

County and Sterling personnel. Beatty, Nevada which is located 15 miles (24 km) northwest 

of the property, is the closest town. The nearest major airport is in Las Vegas. 

Beatty is the nearest centre for lodging and basic services, with a population of approximately 

1,200. Beatty has general stores, gas stations, several motels, elementary and high schools, 

emergency firefighting facilities and an ambulance service and nursing station. The town is on 

a major transportation route between Las Vegas and Reno/northern California, which 

expedites delivery of supplies and shipments. 

5.3 Climate 

The climate in the region is arid, characterized by very hot summers and mild winters; 

temperatures normally range from 110°F (43°C) in the summer to 30°F (-1°C) in the winter. 

The average annual precipitation is 4 inches (10 cm). Snow occurs mainly in the winter or late 

spring. Other times of the year rain occurs with occasional thunderstorms. The evaporation 

rate is in the order of 60 inches (152 cm) per year. High winds are frequent during the winter. 

Typical desert vegetation is found in the area. Occasionally, high winds and frost or snow, in

January and February, freeze water lines on the Sterling Property for several days causing 

minor interruptions to the gold leaching system. Otherwise, the climate does not impact year-

round operations 

5.4 Infrastructure 

Infrastructure consists of an Underground Operations and Maintenance area adjacent to the 

144 Zone portal that was used to support the underground mining of the 144 Zone deposit. 

The area includes a drying room, an office trailer/lunchroom and covered concrete slab for 

maintenance work on the underground equipment. 

A lime silo is located on the waste dump, with a size of 50 ton. During previous operations, 

lime was added to the underground mine feed rock prior to being transported and stacked 

onto the heap. The lime addition insured that the pH of the cyanide leaching solution does 

not drop below 10.5. 

The main office, two additional office trailers, assay laboratory, covered sample preparation 

area, gated fuel storage area, and main diesel driven electricity generator are in a permitted 

area along the county access road into the mine. 

The Sterling Mine has no living quarters or canteen; mine personnel live in Beatty, Las Vegas, 

Pahrump or communities in the Amargosa Valley and commute daily. Bottled potable drinking 

water is supplied to the mine employees from Beatty. 

Water for the Sterling Mine and gold recovery plant is drawn from a well (USW VH-2) in Crater 

Flat. The well was originally drilled by Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company for the 

U.S. Department of Energy and completed to a depth of 4,000 feet (1,219 m). Water was 

encountered at 1,100 feet (335 m) but subsequently rose to 460 feet (140 m). In 1984, the 

former Sterling Mine Joint Venture obtained permission to pump water for mine use. Water 

is stored in a lined and fenced reservoir at the well site. The Sterling Mine provides several 

fresh water troughs around the minesite (from the well) for use by the local wild life.  

Outside communication is provided from a microwave tower at Lathrop Wells and wirelessly 

transmitted to a receiver/transmitter on top of Water Tank hill and then distributed to the 

144 Zone Office, the processing facility office and the Main Site Office. Cellular phone 

reception is also obtainable at certain locations on site.

Gasoline and diesel fuels are trucked in periodically and stored in fuel tanks. Mining and 

leaching supplies are provided by distributors located in Las Vegas and Pahrump. 

A leach Pad processing facility was installed in 2012, to processing the 144 Zone mined 

material. 

A 'sprung structure' covered with canvas was erected over the adsorption desorption - 

recovery circuit. 

It is the understanding of the Author that the surface rights for the mining operations and 

mine waste disposal areas are sufficient.

Resource and/or Reserve Estimates 

Note 1 - This section contains reference to historical resources and reserves estimates and 

production figures.  These are Historical Estimates under NI 43-101 and do not meet the current 

guidelines for resources and reserves definition.  These figures are historical and are provided 

for contextual purposes only. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the 

historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves, and Northern Empire is not 

treating the historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves. 

6.3.1 Deposits in the Sterling Mining Area – 1906 to 1940 

The Sterling mining area, formerly the Panama Mine (also Bittlecomb Shaft), operated 

intermittently between 1906 and 1940. Historic records indicate that ore (see Note 1 above) 

mined in the breccia zone averaged 0.400 oz/ton (13.7 g/t) gold, while footwall rocks averaged 

0.040 oz/ton (1.37 g/t) gold (Gillstrom, 2006).   

Shaft #1 was found to have 3 levels; one at 20 feet (6.1 m), the main, second
 
level, at 67 feet (20.4 

m) and the third level at 87 feet (26.5 m). The third level was filled with debris and was not 

accessible. The top two levels consisted of a room approximately 30 feet (9.1 m) wide (EW), 60 

feet (18.3 m) long (NS), from 6 (1.8 m) to 10 feet (3.05 m) high. Both had drifts extending from 

the south and north ends. Five samples were taken from the floor in the main area of the second 

level. The five samples assayed 0.392, 0.422 0.225, 0.295 and 0.287 oz/ton (13.4, 14.5, 7.7, 10.1 

and 9.8 g/t) gold.  The two drifts extending from the second level were in dolomite with no

apparent target area. Only the second level was sampled. The top half of this shaft was removed 

during the initial mining of the Ambrose Pit (Smithies et al., 2015).   

The second shaft, Shaft #2, is located 100 feet (30.5 m) south of Shaft #1. It has a depth of 98 feet 

(29.9 m), with one main level at 68 feet (20.7 m). At the bottom level, the shaft was offset and 

extended down another 30 feet (9.1 m). The 68-foot level was mapped and 13 samples were 

collected. Most of the samples were low grade, except for one sample that contained 0.231 

oz/ton (7.9 g/t) gold. The location of this sample was further tested in 2001 by drill hole ST01-2. 

Assay results from hole ST01-2 returned 0.362 oz/ton (12.4 g/t) over 30 feet (9.1 m) (Smithies et 

al., 2015).   

Between 1940 and 1970 there was limited work completed in the Sterling area (Smithies et al., 

2015).   

6.3.2 Sterling Area Exploration – 1970 to 1980 

Cordilleran Exploration staked and drilled the Sterling claims in 1973. The company continue to 

map, drill, and sample the Sterling claims until 1977. Thirty-five holes were completed during this 

campaign. In 1978, the entire holdings were leased to Saga Exploration Company (Saga). Saga 

completed 11 rotary holes from surface and put in a short adit to expose the mineralized zone 

(Smithies et al., 2015).   

6.3.3 Sterling Mine – 1980 to 2000 

The Sterling Mine Joint Venture (SMJV) was formed in 1980 that was comprised of Saga, E&B 

Explorations Inc., Derry Michener Booth Venture Number 1, and the Geomex Partnership. The 

SMJV was formed after receiving positive results from testing the exposed zone for heap leaching.  

The SMJV began mining the Sterling Deposit in April 1980, and conducted its first gold pour on 

July 1, 1980 (Smithies et al., 2015).   

The original historic start-up operation extracted a tonnage of 120,000 tons (108,864 tonnes) at 

0.300 oz/ton (10.3 g/t) gold. The Sterling Mine ran continuously from 1980 to 1997 with an 

average grade of 0.217 oz/ton (7.4 g/t), and high-grade mineralization averaging between 0.4 

(13.71 g/t) and 7.0 oz/ton (240 g/t) (Gillstrom, 2006).   

Initial mining in 1980 focussed on the relatively flat lying portion of the Main Zone (now called the 

Sterling Zone) through underground operations. All underground mining was accomplished using 

rubber-tired haulage and jackleg and 'long hole' drilling (Smithies et al., 2015).   

The Ambrose Zone was discovered in 1981. Mining of the Ambrose Pit started in 1982 and 

continued until 1986. During this time, the Ambrose Pit produced 125,807 tons (114,132 tonnes) 



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 6-4 

of mineralized rock at 0.184 oz/ton (6.3 g/t) gold, that amounted to 23,148 oz (719,997 grams) of 

gold being produced (Smithies et al., 2015).   

Following the completion of the mining operation of the Ambrose Pit, an open pit operation was 

started at the Sterling Zone in mid-1986. Operation at the Sterling Pit was completed in early 

1988.  During this time, the Sterling Pit produced 41,083 tons (37,270 tonnes) at 0.287 oz/ton  

(9.8 g/t) gold, with at total of 11,790 oz (366,710 grams) of gold being produced. This open pit 

operation was followed by mining at the Burro Pit; which started in early 1988 and was completed 

in late 1989. The Burro Pit produced 33,435 tons (30,332 tonnes) at 0.243 oz/ton (8.3 g/t) gold, 

with 8,125 oz (252,706 grams) of gold being produced (Smithies et al., 2015).   

In 1995, Cathedral Gold Corp. acquired an option interest in the Goldspar Property. The Goldspar 

Property is 1,700 acres in size, and is adjacent to the Sterling Mine to the north (Nevada Bureau 

of Mines and Geology, 1995).  In 1996, Placer Dome U.S. Inc. (Placer Dome) secured an option on 

the Sterling Mine to explore for deep sulfide-bearing mineralization below the known oxidized 

mineralization zone, following the discovery of a small, high-grade sulphide deposit, averaging 2 

opt gold, at the mine. Placer Dome conducted surface and underground mapping, as well as 

airborne geophysical surveys, which that identified drill targets below the delineated Sterling 

Deposit (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1996). 

Reduced levels of economic mineralization and depressed gold prices forced the Sterling Mine to 

be put on standby for part of 1997 (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1997).  Following 

commencement of the mining operations, the Sterling Mine produce until 1999 (Nevada Bureau 

of Mines and Geology, 1999). After production ceased at the Sterling Mine, the pad continued to 

be leached until October 2001.  Material on the heap was turned over for more complete 

recovery. Gold recovery continued until August 2002 when a final strip was carried out (Smithies 

et al., 2015).   

Total gold production from the Sterling Mine between 1980 and 2000 was 194,996 troy ounces 

from 941,341 short tons (853,984 tonnes) of ore (see Note 1 above), with an average gold grade 

of 0.217 oz/ton (7.44 g/t). Recoveries averaged 88% without milling (Gillstrom, 2006). Table 6.1 

shows a summary of the historical production from the deposits in the Sterling area from 1980 to 

2000, as documented by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology and the Nevada Mineral 

Industry Special Publications.  These figures are historical and are provided for contextual 

purposes only.

6.3.4 Sterling Mine – Panama Pit Exploration during the 1980s 

In 1988, while the Sterling Mine was in production, an exploration program was completed to 

further assess the Bittlecomb shafts of the old Panama Mine. In 1982, the pre-WW2 Bittlecomb 

Shaft workings were re-surveyed and sampled by Sterling's surveyors. From this work, a 

preliminary geologic model was completed, a drill program was initiated and the mineralized area 

was renamed the Panama Zone (Smithies et al., 2015). 

Highlights from the drilling campaign included a hole that averaged 0.166 oz/ton (5.7 g/t) gold 

over 35 feet (10.7 m) that starting 20 feet (6.1 m) below the collar, as well as a hole that averaged 

0.18 oz/ton (6.2 g/t) gold over 30 feet (9.1 m) at a depth of 160 feet (48.8 m) below surface. The 

drill results from the deeper mineralization in the east renewed interest in the underground 

potential of Panama, and when the next phase of drilling began, 16 additional surface holes 

targeted this mineralized zone (Gillstrom, 2006). Highlights from this 16-hole program included 

the delineation of a mineralized zone that started 55 feet (16.8 m) below the surface and 

continues to about 135 feet (41.1 m), with the Sterling Thrust at the mid-point. The main zone of 

mineralization consisted of 60 feet (18.3 m) that averaged 0.319 oz/ton (10.9 g/t) gold (Gillstrom, 

2006). Following this drilling campaign, a narrow test drift was run over to the Panama Zone and 

a raise that ramped up into the center of the zone was completed (Smithies et al., 2015). 

6.3.5 Sterling Mine – 2000 to 2011 

Although the Sterling Mine was not in operation from 2000 to 2012, exploration continued.  Most 

the exploration that was completed on the Sterling claims concentrated on the 144 Zone, 

although some drilling was completed on the Panama Zone.  

Panama Zone 

In 2001, four reverse circulation (RC) holes were drilled in the Panama Zone. Two of the holes, 

drilled vertically, were successful in passing through the upper part of the Panama zone, showing 

a true thickness of about 20 feet (6.1 m). Hole ST01-1 intercepted 0.369 oz/ton (12.6 g/t) gold 

over 25 feet (7.6 m) and Hole ST01-2 intercepted 0.326 oz/ton (11/2 g/t) gold over 30 feet (9.1 

m). The zone dips at approximately 45 degrees to the southeast. The mineralized breccia in this 

zone is oxidized and has all the same characteristics of the Sterling mineralization.  

144 Zone 

In 2001, to test the area around Hole 89-144, Hole 01-7A was set to intersect the Reudy Fault at 

a high angle and at the appropriate depth of about 700 feet (213 m) below the surface. Hole 01-



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 6-7 

7A confirmed the mineralized zone previously identified by Hole 89-144. In 2001, five RC holes 

were also drilled in this area, two of which intercepted significant gold mineralization below the 

Sterling Thrust in a north-dipping band of silty carbonate near the Reudy Fault. One of the holes 

intercepted 100 feet of 0.15 opt gold, while the second hole intersected 0.57 opt at 45 feet 

(Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 2002).  

In 2002, Imperial completed 17 drill holes that expanded the 144 Zone to 500 feet by 750 feet.  

The 144 Zone was approximately 700 feet below the surface and remained open in all directions.  

The gold mineralization in this zone occurs at the silty carbonate rocks and breccias at the contact 

between the Bonanza King Dolomite and the underlying Carrara Limestone.  An additional  

29 claims were staked in 2002 to secure the land package associated with the 144 Zone (Nevada 

Bureau of Mines and Geology, 2003).   

In addition to drilling, a Natural Source Audio-Magneto Telluric (NSAMT) geophysical survey was 

carried out over the 144 Zone in December 2002.  NSAMT focussed on the use of natural electric 

and magnetic fields, generated in the earth's crust by global atmospheric or solar events, to 

identify features or structural trends that might reflect the principal controls on 144 Zone 

mineralization, such as dolostone-limestone contacts, dikes, bodies of silicification, and cavernous 

or clay-rich fault zones (Gillstrom, 2006). By the end of 2003, a total of 46 surface holes had been 

completed to delineate the 144 Zone.  

In 2006, an NI 43-101 Technical Report on the 144 Zone reported a resource of 214,600 tons 

(194,685 tonnes) at 0.216 oz/ton (7.4 g/t) gold (Gillstrom, 2006). The report recommended the 

construction of a decline ramp for further drill delineation.   

In 2007, a 3,352-foot (1022 m) long underground decline, which included two exploration drifts 

off the main decline, was completed. Chip sampling of the ribs while completing the exploration 

drifts yielded an intersection of over 150 feet of an average of 0.039 opt gold. The mineralization 

was hosted in breccias that resembled the lower grade breccias that surround the higher-grade 

mineralization in the 144 Zone (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 2007).  

In 2008, following the completion of a decline and exploration drifts in 2007, 52 holes were drilled 

into the 144 Zone, totalling 13,000 feet. The underground drilling program discovered and defined 

the east extension of the 144 Zone, as well as the discovery of an open mineralization trend on 

the west side of the 144 Zone and a potential latite dike. The latite dike divided the main 144 Zone 

from the east extension. The highest intercepts from the 2008 drilling program are summarized 

in Table 6.2 (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 2008).

In 2009, 22 exploration and delineation drill holes were completed in 2009 in the 144 Zone. Nine 

holes were drilled to test the northern extent of the 144 Zone.  This program determined that 

gold mineralization in the 144 Zone was concentrated within a high angle east-west fault zone, as 

opposed to the usual contact zone between the Bonanza King dolomite and the Carrara 

limestone.  The east-west fault zone also defined the southern boundary of the overlying Sterling 

mineralized zones.  Four holes were drilled to test the potential of the latite dike (Nevada Bureau 

of Mines and Geology, 2009).  In addition, four holes were drilled to test the western margin of 

the 144 Zone, one of which intercepted 101.5 feet (30.9 m) of 0.062 opt of gold that included an 

interval of 16 feet (4.9 m) of 0.107 opt gold.  Five holes were drilled beyond the known southern 

limit of the 144 Zone, all of which encountered variably mineralized breccias. One of these holes 

intercepted 80 feet (24.4 m) averaging 0.089 opt gold, including a 20-foot (6.1 m) interval that 

graded at 0.243 opt gold. During this time, permitting was completed on the 144 Zone (Nevada 

Bureau of Mines and Geology, 2009).   

In February 2010, Imperial began work on the 3,220-level underground access ramp to provide 

access to the western edge of the 144 Zone (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 2010).   

In 2011, $6.1 million was spent on exploration and development (Nevada Bureau of Mines and 

Geology, 2011).  Twenty-six underground core holes were drilled, totalling 3,009 feet.  Most the 

holes were drilled on the 3,180 level to delineate the northern limb of the 144 Zone. The 

remaining holes were drilled to the north and south of the known 144 Zone to find any outlying

mineralization. The program also successfully tested the bottom edge of the new Sterling push 

back pit, with hole ST11-088 intersecting 0.188 oz/ton (6.4 g/t) gold over 35 feet (10.7 m).   

During 2013, 52 core holes totalling 5,800 feet were drilled to further delineate the 144 Zone at 

the 3,180-foot level, as well as to explore part of the 3,320-foot level.  Some of the important 

intercepts included 40 feet averaging 0.163 opt Au that contained a five-foot interval of 0.494 opt, 

49 feet with an average of 0.173 opt Au that contained a 10-foot interval of 0.166 opt Au, and 70 

feet averaging 0.166 opt Au that contained 16 feet at 0.476 opt Au (Nevada Bureau of Mines and 

Geology, 2013).   

The 2014 exploration program focused on delineating the 144 Zone east of the dike.  Twelve 

underground core holes (total 2,813 feet) and eighteen surface core holes (5,385 feet) were 

drilled during this program.  In addition, a long-hole drill completed 202 holes that totalled 7,055 

feet. Sample highlights from the long hole drill program included 50 feet grading 0.215 opt gold, 

and 25 feet grading 0.217 0.215 opt gold.   

Mining of the 144 Zone was completed in 2014.  Table 6.3 summarizes the Sterling Mine annual 

production and shipped gold between 2012 and 2015 as published in the 2014 and 2015 Imperial

6.4 North Block Deposits - Historical Exploration, Development Work, Mineral Resource 
and/or Reserve Estimates 

Gold prospecting in the Fluorspar Canyon area was active in 1905 (Marr, 2006). A camp was 

implemented at Telluride in 1905; however, this venture did not survive the year. Fluorite was 

discovered in 1916 by J. Irving Crowell in the Fluorspar Canyon that developed into the Daisy 

(Crowell) Mine that operated continuously from 1918 to 1986, and produced 250,000 tons of 

fluorite (Marr, 2006). Cordex and Gexa discovered seven gold deposits along the Fluorspar 

Canyon, which include; The Canyon, West, South, Enif Trench, Secret Pass, Mother Lode, and SNA 

zones, all of which occur proximal to the Fluorspar Canyon Detachment Fault that juxtaposed 

Paleozoic and Tertiary rocks in the Fluorspar Canyon (Marr, 2006; Greybeck and Wallace, 1991). 

The Secret Pass Deposit, Daisy Property, SNA Deposit comprise the North Block deposits that are 

identified as containing significant mineralization.  Each of these deposits are reviewed in the 

following sections.   

6.4.1 Secret Pass Deposit 

Exploration of the Secret Pass area in 1979, as part of a uranium exploration program, identified 

disseminated gold in ash-flow tuffs (Marr, 2006).  Mineralized tonnage at the Secret Pass Zone 

were estimated at 12M tons (10.9M tonnes) that graded at 0.026 oz/ton (0.9 g/t) gold (Greybeck 

and Wallace, 1991).  These estimates are considered Historical Estimates as outlined by National 

Instrument 43-101 Guidelines, and subsequently do not meet the current criteria. These figures 

are historical and are provided for contextual purposes only. A Qualified Person has not done 

sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources or reserves, and 

Northern Empire is not treating the historical estimates as current mineral resources or 

reserves. 

6.4.2 Daisy Property – 1985 to 2001 

In 1985, Cordex geologists identified the presence of gold at the Daisy Mine. To follow up on this 

discovery, Cordex drilled 228 holes on the Daisy Property (Marr, 2006).   

Between 1993 and 1994, Inter-Rock Gold completed the first stage of exploration on the Daisy 

Gold property.  In 1995, Inter-Rock and Rayrock agreed on a plan to develop the Daisy Property. 

The Daisy Property was 11 square miles and contained five sulfide and/or oxide gold-bearing 

mineralized zones aligned along an east-northeast trend; the Secret Pass, Mother Lode, SNA (also 

termed "Joshua Hollow"), South and West Zones (Daisy Deposit).   

The West Zone includes gold mineralization hosted in the Halfpint and Dunderberg Shale 

Members of the Nopah Formation.  The highest gold grades are associated with intense

silicification and fluorite mineralization. Anomalous concentrations of arsenic, antimony, mercury 

and thallium are present with gold in the Halfpint Member (Marr, 2006). 

The South Zone is hosted by silty limestones and calcareous siltstones of the Carrara Formation 

which are located beneath alluvial cover immediately south of the Daisy Mine.  Subtle alteration 

is present with some decalcification.  Anomalously high arsenic occurs in the zone and silver, 

copper, molybdenum and thallium tend to correlate with gold values. 

In 1996, Inter-Rock Inc started producing gold from the Daisy Mine. The first phase of a drilling 

program to define additional reserve on the 13.7 square mile Daisy Property was conducted 

(Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1996).  The Daisy Mine was in production between 1997 

and 2001.  In 1998, Rayrock Resources purchased the remaining 65% purchase of the Daisy Mine 

(Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1998).  Then in March 1999, Glamis Gold acquired the 

Daisy Mine (Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, 1999).   

Table 6.5 shows a summary of ownership and production of the Daisy Mine from 1997-2001.

SNA is located approximately 2,000 feet south east of the Mother Lode deposit. SNA is hosted in 

lower Paleozoic rocks and Tertiary dacitic porphyry of an estimated age of 14 Ma. SNA was 

explored by U.S. Precious Metals (40%), GEXA Gold Corp (40%) and Degerstrom (20%) in 1989.  

The oxide component of the Mother Lode Deposit was mined out in 1992 (Nevada Bureau of 

Mines and Geology, 1992). These figures are historical and are provided for contextual purposes 

only. 

Soil and Rock Sampling Program North of SNA Deposit (2016) 

During 2016, a soil sampling and geological mapping in an area of favorable geology along the 

Northern Flank of Bare Mountain, north of SNA was conducted by Imperial (Imperial Metals 

Corporation, 2016). The samples were assayed for gold (ppb), mercury (ppb) and antimony (ppm).  

The soil sampling program involved three different surveys.  One to the south heading from SE to 

NW. The second runs from south to north in four lines that appear to be at 100 m spacing between 

samples and 200 m between the lines.  The third is located to the east of the second and runs SW 

to NE in six lines are approximately 50 m spacing between samples and 100 m.  The results show 

that high anomalies of gold (>5ppb Au) is often associated with higher concentrations of Antimony 

(>20ppm Sb).  Mercury does not seem to have a strong correlation with gold anomalies.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

The following text used material presented in the internal report titled "Sterling Gold Mine, Nye 

County Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling, January 21, 2015. 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The deposits on the Sterling Property are typical of sedimentary and volcanic-hosted gold deposits 

in the western U.S., particularly in the Great Basin in Nevada. These deposits include sediment-

hosted, disseminated precious metal deposits; known as Carlin-type deposits, as well as 

epithermal-style deposits hosted in volcanics (Teal and Jackson, 1997). 

The Great Basin is a physiographic and tectonic region west of the Rocky Mountains, from 

southern Oregon to southern California and Arizona, and which is characterized by profound 

crustal extension and high heat flow beginning in the mid-Tertiary (about 35 to 40 million years 

ago). In the characteristic basin and range physiography, fault-bounded mountain ranges are 

composed mainly of metamorphosed Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, originally 

deposited on the rifted paleo-continental margin (miogeocline) of ancestral North America. The 

intervening basins or flats are underlain at depth by thinner sections of the same rocks, but are 

filled with great thicknesses of younger volcanic deposits and erosional detritus related to Basin 

and Range magmatism and tectonics. 

The Bare Mountain District lies within the Walker Lane Tectonic Belt, a NW-trending mega- 

lineament in southwestern Nevada (Figure 7-1), which hosts several significant gold mining 

districts, especially epithermal gold-silver deposits. The Walker Lane is fundamentally a deep- 

seated, Miocene tectonic boundary between Basin and Range extension in the western Great 

Basin, and subduction-related tectonics and calc-alkaline magmatism of the Sierra Nevada. It is a 

complex zone characterized by extension and dextral strike slip, but involving other fault systems 

related to Miocene tectonics, including domains of ENE-striking sinistral strike-slip structures and 

low- and high-angle normal faults. 

Ductile deformation occurred in the Mesozoic, when crustal shortening produced large-scale, 

overturned folds and thrust-repetitions of these strata. Fold and thrust vergence was generally to 

the northwest. Metamorphic grade was low to moderate (greenschist or lower). The age of this 

deformation is assumed to be Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, as Late Cretaceous granitic rocks do 

not appear to be affected. Episodic Tertiary extension produced both low-angle and high-angle 

normal faults. At least some of the high-angle faults post-date the low-angle structures. Some of

Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 7-2 

the latter are possibly reactivated Mesozoic thrusts. Some of the high-angle faults have oblique 

slip, with a right-lateral component. 

Most of the Bare Mountain Range comprises strongly deformed, but generally north-dipping, 

Upper Proterozoic and Paleozoic rocks (Figure 7-1). Siliciclastic lithologies dominate the Upper 

Proterozoic to Lower Cambrian part of the stratigraphy in the south of the range. In the Middle 

Cambrian there is a transition to carbonate-rich lithologies, with dolostones and limestones 

dominating the stratigraphy northwards through to the Upper Devonian, above which is a 

Mississippian unit of immature siliciclastics. The youngest rocks in the Bare Mountains are Tertiary 

igneous rocks of the Southwestern Nevada Volcanic Field, a large region of mid- to late Miocene 

silicic ash-flow tuffs and lesser silicic to mafic lavas and intrusions. 

On Bare Mountain, the Southwestern Nevada Volcanic Field volcanic rocks are restricted to the 

northern flank, in the hanging-wall of the north-dipping Fluorspar Canyon Detachment Fault 

(Figure 7-1). Minor intrusions, however, occur throughout the range, comprising felsic to 

intermediate, porphyritic dikes related to the latter part of the 'main magmatic stage' of the 

SWNVF. These quartz latite dikes, approximately 13.9 Ma old (K-Ar, biotite), generally trend north, 

and commonly appear to occupy the fault zones.

7.2 Local Stratigraphy and Structural Geology 

Figure 7-2 shows a simplified geology map of the Sterling deposits, while Figure 7-3 shows the 

local geology of the North Block deposits. The major units are reviewed in the following sub-

sections.  

From oldest to youngest, stratified rock units on the Sterling Property range from the Upper 

Proterozoic to Ordovician part of the stratigraphic section. The host rocks of the 144 Zone 

mineralization span the bottom of the Bonanza King Formation and the top of the Carrara 

Formation. The South and West Zones (Daisy Deposit) are in the Cambrian-aged  Smokey Member 

of the Nopah Formation comprised of Carbonate rocks and the Secret Pass Zone is in the Miocene 

Crater Flat Tuff deposit (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991). The SNA deposits are hosted in altered 

Paleozoic-aged carbonates thought to be the Antelope Valley Formation of the Pogonip Group 

(Monsen et al., 1992). 

Miocene quartz latite dikes of the SWNVF occur throughout the Sterling property, but most are 

along or close to the Reudy Fault zone (see below, under Structure). They normally range in 

thickness from 5 feet to about 30 feet, though some are considerably thicker. Most trend north- 

south, and were probably intruded along faults or fractures. Clay-alteration of the dikes ranges 

from weak to locally intense. The dikes slightly pre-date the most important hydrothermal activity 

and gold mineralization at Sterling. 

The Tertiary volcanics, which occur to the north of the Fluorspar Canyon Detachment, are 

primarily composed of rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs, and air fall tuffs derived from the calderas of the 

Southwest Nevada Volcanic Field (Marr, 2006).

7.3 Structures 

7.3.1 Bare Mountain Panel 

The lowest panel, which forms the major part of Bare Mountain, comprises a regular stratigraphic 

section, which generally strikes east-west and dips about 60 north. The Bare Mountain Panel is 

deformed by north-trending, high-angle faults related to Tertiary extension. East-side-down 

displacements are predominant, resulting in right-lateral separations of stratigraphic contacts. A 

few faults show small, west-side down displacements. The amount of strike-slip associated with 

the faulting is not clear. 

The 144 Zone is in Bonanza King-Carrara rocks of the Bare Mountain panel. The mineralized zone 

is completely blind, and lies beneath the Sterling Thrust Panel, as outline in the section below. 

7.3.2 Sterling Thrust Panel 

On top of the Bare Mountain Panel is the Sterling Thrust, which carries a panel of overturned, 

west-facing Wood Canyon Formation and overlying (older) Stirling Quartzite. These strata 

typically strike northeast and dip gently to moderately southeast. The Sterling Thrust is gently 

folded, but generally dips to the east or southeast. Thus, the thrust and the overturned folding 

are each west- or northwest-verging, and are potentially coeval and Jurassic to Early Cretaceous 

in age. The mined-out Sterling Deposit occurs along the Sterling Thrust. A window in the Sterling 

Thrust Panel south of the Sterling Mine area exposes north-dipping Carrara Formation of the 

underlying Bare Mountain Panel ('Carrara Window', Figure 7-2). The Carrara Formation is not 

mineralized in the window, but its down-dip, northward projection under the Sterling Thrust is 

mineralized in the 144 Zone, along with the overlying Bonanza King Formation. 

7.3.3 Nopah Fault Panel 

The highest structural panel forms the hanging-wall of the low-angle Nopah Fault. This is a large 

detachment fault which overlies the Sterling Thrust Panel and, in southern Bare Mountain, also 

overlaps the lowest (Bare Mountain) structural panel. The fault dips 20 to 30 east-southeast, 

and trends northeast. 

The hanging-wall of the Nopah Fault on the Sterling Property is mainly Nopah Formation. 

However, east of Sterling, overturned Goodwin limestone and Ninemile Formation of the Pogonip 

Group structurally overlie older Nopah Formation dolostone. 

The Nopah Fault Panel (Figure 7-3) is structurally much higher than the 144 Zone and does not 

impact its structural setting, or that of the main Sterling Deposit.

7.3.4 The Fluorspar Canyon Detachment Fault 

The Fluorspar Canyon Detachment Fault, situated on the north flank of Bare Mountain, marks the 

boundary between Paleozoic carbonate and siliciclastic sediments in its footwall and the Tertiary-

age volcanics in its hanging wall. This fault is a low angle-north dipping structure that hosts several 

past producing gold deposits including those of Secret Pass and Mother Lode (Taylor et al., 2010).   

7.3.5 Other Important Faults 

BURRO FAULT. The Burro Fault truncates the northwest edge of the Sterling Thrust. The Burro 

Fault is a normal, dip-slip fault that strikes northeast and has dips that range from 45 along its 

southeast portion of the structure, to dips ≥ 60° along its southwest portion of its structure. 

Vertical displacement on the Burro Fault varies from 300 or 400 feet (down to the southeast) in 

the Burro-Sterling Pit areas, to about 800 feet in the southwest. Several small klippen or salients 

of the Wood Canyon Formation overlay the Bonanza King Formation on the up-faulted, northwest 

side of the Burro Fault. The Burro Fault is presumed to underlie the entire Sterling Deposit (Figure 

7-2 to Figure 7-4), and potentially the 144 Zone (Rees and McAndless, 2001). 

REUDY FAULT. The Tertiary Reudy Fault is the principal structure associated with the 

mineralization in the 144 Zone. It is an east-side-down normal fault, east of the Sterling Mine area, 

and cuts through the Sterling Thrust Panel and underlying Bare Mountain Panel. It trends just east 

of north and dips about 60 to 80 east. The surface expression of the fault above the 144 Zone is 

not obvious, as Stirling Quartzite outcrops on both sides. Its approximate surface trace is marked 

by several zones of strong fracturing, microbreccia, slickensides, and local limonite or hematite 

staining. Its geometry is understood mainly from drill data. Slip on the fault is not clear: both 

subhorizontal and dip-slip slickenlines have been observed on surface and underground (the fault 

zone has been crossed in Sterling Mine workings north of the 144 Zone). Overall it is thought to 

be mainly dip slip, or oblique slip with a minor right lateral component. The kinematics might be 

complicated because of several stages of displacement. The vertical separation component is in 

the order of 250 feet or more. Several quartz latite dikes are closely associated with the Reudy 

Fault zone. The fault is thought to pre-date the dikes because the latter are not appreciably 

displaced (Figure 7-4). 

STERLING MINE FAULTS. Minor faults in the Sterling Deposit trend north to north-northeast, and 

have typically small displacements which don't affect the map pattern although they give rise to 

irregularities on the Sterling Thrust surface apparent in drill sections. However, they are significant 

because they are intimately associated with mineralization, and were almost certainly conduits 

for hydrothermal fluids.

Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 7-9 

RANGE FRONT FAULT. A significant, north-trending fault, or series of faults, flanks the eastern side 

of Bare Mountain, generally known as the Range Front fault. The gravity survey indicates that 

there is no abrupt, buried fault scarp, but pediment that extends for at least 1.5 miles  

(2.5 km) under Crater Flat. The pediment dips about 20 under the gravels, and is cut by several 

high- angle faults with moderate vertical separations (hundreds of feet).

7.4 Mineralization 

7.4.1 Deposits in the Sterling Mine Area (Sterling Deposit) 

The deposits in the Sterling area, which include the Sterling, Burro, Ambrose, Water Tank Hill, and 

Panama (Figure 7-3 and Figure 7-4), occurred mainly at and below the Sterling Thrust contact 

between the Wood Canyon (above the thrust) and Bonanza King formations, and locally along the 

Burro Fault (Figure 7-4). The main gold-bearing mineralized zones generally form longitudinal 

'pipes' along the thrust, following the intersections between minor NNE-trending high-angle 

faults and the thrust. 

This structurally controlled gold mineralization is localized in faults, silty carbonate beds, solution 

breccias, "breccia pipes", and karst collapse breccias (Panama Mine) within the thrust. Gold occurs 

as submicron to micron size particles hosted by argillaceous arkosic siltstones, arkosic sandstones, 

quartzites, dolomites, limestones and breccias, and can reach up to four microns in strongly 

oxidized host rocks. 

Brecciation, silicification, decalcification, carbonate remobilization, oxidation, argillic and sericitic 

alteration with minor primary sulfides (pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, stibnite, cinnabar, galena, 

sphalerite and others) occur with gold mineralization. Also, elevated levels of arsenic, antimony, 

fluorine, zinc, silver, molybdenum and tungsten correlate strongly with gold mineralization. 

Two stages of known hydrothermal activity occurred in the Sterling deposits. The earliest, 

approximately 100 million years ago, is the Cretaceous thermal event. This event introduced 

minor silica and sulfides, and aided in ground preparation to facilitate emplacement of metals 

during the main mineralization event. During the Tertiary, the main phase of mineralization 

introduced gold, silver, arsenic, antimony, molybdenum, and fluorine with other minor elements. 

Variably anomalous copper, lead, zinc and barium display a moderate association with gold. The 

Sterling gold deposits is assumed to have formed at temperatures from 150°C to 175°C, reaching 

up to 300°C proximal to feeder channels, as concluded by assessment of mixed layered clays and 

fluid inclusions. 

Grades in the Sterling Mine varied significantly. Production from the Sterling open pit and 

underground mine, between 1980 and 1997, had an average grade of 0.217 oz Au/ton. Higher 

grade gold mineralization was intermittently encountered, which can range from 0.4 to 8.0 opt. 

Silver content is negligible.

Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 7-12 

Age of the Sterling Deposit Mineralization 

The main mineralization and alteration at Sterling Deposit is cut by quartz latite dike with an 

emplacement age of 13.9 million-years. Castor (1999) proposed that the mineralization occurred 

slightly younger than 12.9 million years based on dating of Miocene alteration and volcanics in 

the immediate area.  

The general dimensions of the mineralized zone at the Sterling Deposit covers an area 

approximately 2000 ft wide by 2,500 ft long extending from outcrop and plunging towards the 

south to a maximum depth of approximately 850 ft below surface. The mineralization is 

continuous from surface. 

7.4.2 Mineralization of the North Block Deposits 

Gold mineralization in the North Block deposits are hosted by Tertiary volcanics and Paleozoic-

aged rocks. The Secret Pass Deposit is hosted in Tertiary Middle Miocene Crater Flat Tuff deposit, 

while the Shear Zone, South and West Zones (Daisy) is hosted in the Smoky Member of the 

Cambrian aged Nopah Formation. The SNA deposits are hosted in altered Paleozoic-aged 

carbonates thought to be the Antelope Valley Formation of the Pogonip Group (Monsen et al., 

1992). Regardless of host rock, north-striking normal faulting is the principle control for 

mineralization (Marr, 2006). The highest gold grades commonly being associated with fault 

intersections (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991). The mineralized zones in the North Block deposits 

have features that are typical of Carlin-type and epithermal deposits. 

The West Zone of the Daisy Deposit is hosted by limestone of the Nopah Formation – Halfpint 

Member (Marr, 2006). The highest gold values are associated with intense silicification, fluorite, 

and iron oxide. The mineralized intervals commonly contain arsenic, antimony, mercury, thallium. 

A low angle fault forms the footwall (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991).  

The general dimensions of the mineralized area of the West Zone of the Daisy Deposit covers an 

area approximately 700 ft wide by 1,500 ft long extending from outcrop and plunging towards the 

east to a maximum depth of approximately 500 ft below surface. The mineralization is 

discontinuous from surface. 

The South Zone of the Daisy Deposit is hosted by silty limestones and calcareous siltstones of the 

Carrara Formation. Mineralized intervals in this zone are characterized by weak decalcification 

and increased pyrite. Alteration and mineralization are controlled by a shallow, north dipping 

east-west striking fault that juxtaposes the hanging wall of the Bonanza King dolomite and the 

footwall of the Carrara Formation. Increased gold concentration is present at intersections where

high-angle faults cut the hanging wall dolomite. There are anomalously high concentrations of 

arsenic in the mineralized zone, and gold concentrations correlate with increased concentrations 

of silver, copper, molybdenum and thallium. The massive fluorite veins that were extracted from 

the Daisy (Crowell) Mine, are in the dolomite of the Bonanza King Formation above the gold 

mineralization. Mining in the lower levels of the Daisy Mine exposed oxidized breccia zones that 

locally contain significant gold values of up to 6.7 metres (22 feet) in length that has an average 

gold grade of 0.224 opt. Drilling failed to indicate significant tonnage down-dip along the structure 

that juxtaposes the Bonanza King and Carrara formations (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991). 

The general dimensions of the mineralized area of the South Zone of the Daisy Deposit covers an 

area approximately 1,000 ft wide by 1,000 ft long with most the mineralization occurring at a 

depth of between 500 ft to 1,000 ft below surface. The mineralization is discontinuous.   

Although some geological differences do occur between the South and West Zones (Daisy 

Deposit), for this resource estimate, these two deposits were estimated together and are termed 

the Daisy Deposit. 

The Secret Pass Zone gold mineralization occurs within Miocene ash-flow tuffs that have 

undergone propylitization, argillization, and silicification. Secret Pass has anomalous 

concentrations of arsenic, antimony, mercury and thallium. Silver is also associated with the gold 

but in low concentrations of 4 Au: 1 Ag. The Secret Pass Zone mineralization is controlled by the 

Fluorspar Canyon Detachment Fault (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991).   

The general dimensions of the mineralized zone at Secret Pass covers an area approximately 1,000 

ft wide by 1,700 ft long extending from outcrop and plunging towards the northeast to a 

maximum depth of approximately 750 ft below surface. The mineralization is discontinuous from 

surface. 

The SNA Deposit is covered with gravels and Tertiary units that overlay Ordovician sediments. The 

SNA Deposit is interpreted to be hosted Paleozoic carbonates and siliciclastic rocks (Marr, 2006). 

Monsen et al. (1992) thought the SNA deposit was hosted by the Antelope Valley Formation a 

medium-gray limestone and silty limestone. 

The general dimensions of the mineralized zone at SNA covers an area approximately 1,500 ft 

wide by 1,500 ft long extending from outcrop and plunging towards the north to a maximum 

depth of approximately 550 ft below surface. The mineralization is discontinuous from surface.

7.4.3 Age of Mineralization of the North Block Deposits  

The age of mineralization for the SNA anomaly is thought to be 14 million years (Nevada Bureau 

of Mines and Geology, 1989). Mineralization in the South and West Zones (Daisy Deposit) and 

Secret Pass Deposit are proposed to be between 11 and 13 Ma (Nevada Bureau of Mines and 

Geology, 1993) that are associated with Tertiary expansion post-detachment of the Fluorspar 

Canyon. The Tertiary expansion resulted in high angle northerly-striking faults that were 

important in mineralization in the Fluorspar Canyon area (Greybeck and Wallace, 1991).

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Four gold deposits are identified on the Sterling Property. These deposits are Sterling, Daisy, 

Secret Pass and SNA. The Daisy, Secret Pass and SNA deposits are located north of the Sterling 

Deposit and are collectively called the North Block deposits. Sterling, Daisy and SNA are 

carbonate-hosted and classified as Carlin-type deposits, while Secret Pass is volcanic-hosted and 

classified as an epithermal deposit. Gold mineralization is concentrated along faults or is aligned 

with the regional structural fabric. With several past producing mines on the Sterling Property, in 

addition to the permits and additional infrastructure, the Sterling Property warrants additional 

exploration. 

8.1 General Characteristics of Carlin-Type and Epithermal Gold Deposits 

Distinguishing characteristics of sedimentary rock-hosted Carlin-type gold deposits are presented 

in Table 8.1, and low-sulphidation epithermal deposits in Table 8.2, both of which are from Table 

1 of Hofstra and Cline (2000).

9 EXPLORATION  

Between February 19 and 21, 2017, geological staff from Northern Empire collected 20 rock 

samples from the Fluorspar Canyon area near the Daisy deposits. Rock chip samples were taken 

from 19 of the locations, while Sample 256279 was taken from material that was not in situ. The 

samples were taken from an area that is approximately 0.6 km2, which has the northeast corner 

at 527550E/4081800N, and a southwest corner at 526500E/4080700N (NAD 83, Zone 11). As the 

purpose of the sampling program was to independently assess the presence of gold in the host 

rocks, the collected samples were biased to altered rocks (i.e. silicified or gossanous) that 

commonly were associated with structures such as sheared intervals. As such, the spacing 

between the samples varied from metre-scale to 0.5 km spacing.  

All samples were sent to ALS Minerals' office in Reno, Nevada. Following sample preparation, 30 

g pulverized sub-samples were fire assay tested and finished with an inductively coupled plasma 

atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis to assess gold content. For samples that were 

determined during this initial test to contain more than 10 ppm gold, as was the case with samples 

256277 and 256283, an additional 30 g sub-sample was again fire assayed, and subsequently 

finished with a gravimetric technique (FA-GRAV). Table 9.1 shows a summary of the gold assay 

results that were determined for each of the analysed samples.

256288 20-Feb-17 Rock Chip Daisy Area 0.91 0.289 

 

It is the Author's opinion that these 20 collected samples provide sufficient confirmation that gold 

is associated with in situ host rocks on surface in the Daisy area in the North Block.

10 DRILLING 

This section summarizes the exploration drilling in the Sterling and North Block deposits between 

1980 and 2014. Drill programs were not completed by Northern Empire or Norwest and, as such, 

a drill plan is not included in this section. Additional historical information about the previous 

drilling campaigns is provided in Section 6.   

10.1 Exploration Drilling and Bulk Sampling Programs on the Sterling Deposit 

The following text used material presented in the internal report titled "Sterling Gold Mine, Nye 

County Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling, January 21, 2015. 

Between 1973 and 2015, 1,491 core and RC holes were drilled on the Sterling Deposit. Most of 

the post-2000 drilling on the Sterling claims focused on the 144 Zone. A 2001 program involved 

four reverse circulation (RC) to tested the Panama Zone and a 2011 39 RC hole program further 

assessed an area between the Ambrose and Burro Pits, as well as the Water Tank Hill Pit. The 

program also successfully tested the bottom edge of the new Sterling pushback pit.  Hole ST11-

088 hit 0.188 opt gold over 35 feet.  Table 10.1 outlines the drilling programs, which include a 

long hole precision drilling program, that were completed between 1973 and 2015. Figure 10-1 

shows the drilling plan for the programs completed between 1973 and 2015 and Figure 10-2 is a 

representative schematic cross section through the Sterling Deposit.

10.1.1 Drilling Procedures 

The following text references material presented in the internal report titled "Sterling Gold Mine, 

Nye County Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling, January 21, 2015. 

The drilling programs up  to 1996, with a  total of 1,128  rotary holes across  the property were 

drilled mostly  in a grid pattern.   The grid pattern was commonly 20 feet spacing between drill 

holes, with 40  to 100  foot  spacing between  rows. The  surface  rotary drill holes were  logged, 

sampled and analyzed at five foot intervals down the entire length of the hole.   

"As part of the 2001 exploration program on the Sterling Property, 4 delineation holes were drilled 

targeting the Panama Zone. Two of the holes, drilled vertically, were successful in passing through 

the upper part of  the Panama  zone,  showing  a  true  thickness of  about 20  feet. Hole  ST01‐1 

intercepted 0.369 opt gold over 25 feet and Hole ST01‐2 intercepted 0.326 opt gold over 30 feet. 

The zone dips at approximately 45 degrees to the southeast. The mineralized breccia in this zone 

is oxidized and has all  the same characteristics of  the Sterling mineralization."  (Smithies et al., 

2015).  

Norwest was provided with previous geological models by Northern Empire  that  included  the 

collar survey with surveyed NAD 83, Zone 11 Easting, Northing, elevation, azimuth, dip and depth.  

Norwest was provided with  information for samples drilled between 2006 and 2011, and core 

photos from the 2008 drilling campaign. The original assay certificates from the 2006 and 2009 

programs  were  provided.  The  depth  of  relevant  sample  intervals  and  assay  results  were 

determined from the previous models, while more recent information regarding the more recent 

drilling and intercepts was also provided by Smithies et al. (2015). The relationship between the 

sample length and true thickness of mineralization is unknown for the historical data. Additional 

information regarding the historical drilling is summarized in Section 6.   

10.1.2 Accuracy and Reliability of Results 

The drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability 

of the results were outlined by Smithies et al (2015). 

"Historical work done prior to 2001 may not always have employed the full quality control checks 

that are currently being used in the exploration industry. Additionally, most of the historic assay 

records from the Sterling onsite assay lab were only stored on paper at the mine site and were 

lost or destroyed when the mine office was moved in 2007. 

It should also be noted that there can be significant differences between 2017 practices today 

and the sampling and assaying standards used  in exploration drilling and mine operations  infill

sampling and drilling.    It  is not uncommon for an operating mine with a  long record of proven 

laboratory results to have a much reduced frequency of duplicates and standards. Similarly, the 

chain of custody associated with handling / processing the infill samples can be much less formal 

at existing operations. The costs savings associated with the reduced oversight of the many infill 

samples are significant" (Smithies et al., 2015).

10.2 Exploration and Bulk Sampling on the North Block area 

Nevada Mineral Industry reports from 1979-2015 mention exploration and drilling activities on 

the North Block areas.  Norwest was provided with a geological model of the North Block area. 

The Tables 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 summarize the holes drilled for the SNA, Secret Pass and the South 

and West Zones (Daisy Deposit) that were included in the model. There was more drilling that 

occurred which was not included in the model and therefore not part of this report.  The year that 

the hole was drilled, the type of hole and the target is not known.  A more detailed description of 

exploration and production on the North blocks can be found in Section 6.  Figure 10-3 shows the 

Daisy Deposit Drill plan for historic holes included in the model and Figure 10-4 is a schematic 

cross section through Daisy South. Figure 10-5 is the SNA drill plan for all historic holes included 

in the model and Figure 10-6 is a schematic cross section through the SNA deposit.  Figure 10-7 

displays the Secret Pass Drilling Plan and Figure 10-8 is a representative schematic cross section 

through the Secret Pass deposit.   

The total number of holes drilled at the South and West Zones (Daisy Deposit) are 112 for a total 

of 55,690 feet. 

Table 10.2  

South and West Zones (Daisy Deposit) Historical Drilling 

Series Name # Holes Feet Drilled

The total number of holes drilled at SNA is 149 for a total of 52,562.5 feet.

10.2.1 Drilling Procedures 

Norwest was provided with a geologic model of the including the collar surveyed in NAD 83, Zone 

11 Easting, Northing, Elevation, Azimuth, Dip and Depth. There is no information on the drilling 

procedures followed for the North Block drilling.  There is no additional information on the 

relationship between sample length and true thickness of mineralization and the orientation of 

mineralization beyond what was provided to Norwest as a previous geological model.  Norwest 

was not provided with original drillhole logging and sample thicknesses.  The results of any 

significant higher grade intervals within lower grade intersections were summarized in Section 6.   

10.2.2 Accuracy and Reliability of Results 

Norwest was not provided with the drilling procedures or original logging of drillholes.  Accuracy 

and Reliability of the result is the same as stated in the Sterling section.

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 11-1 

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

The following text is primarily a duplication of Section 11 from the internal report titled "Sterling 

Gold Mine, Nye County Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling,  

January 21, 2015. In addition, analyses from the 2017 surface sampling program are included 

below. 

11.1 Sterling Deposits 

11.1.1 Scrutiny of Historic Underground Samples 

Much of the detailed documentation of the assays used for the underground infill samples has 

been lost; however, most of the actual underground drill and sample locations and assay values 

were preserved on the 50 different level drawings. These level plans were all scanned to make 

`jpg` pictures; then digitized in AutoCAD as 2D vector CAD files; then imported into MineSight®3D, 

to create a full three-dimensional wire frame Model of all the old workings at the Sterling Mine. 

11.1.2 Samples Collected During Mining to 1998 

As shown in Table 10.1, during the Sterling Mine life, 1,228 surface rotary drill holes were 

completed. At the same time as this surface drilling was occurring, extensive underground 

definition drilling, mapping and sampling programs were being carried out. The combination of 

results from these programs found extensions to many mineralized zones, tightened controls on 

the block model, and help increase the known reserve during each year of operation. 

The surface rotary drill holes are logged, sampled and analyzed at five foot intervals down the 

entire length of the hole. Development headings and stopes are mapped and chip-sampled full 

height at 5-10 foot intervals along the rib pillars. Underground faces are also chip-sampled full 

height during development and stoping. All drill hole samples, face samples and rib samples were 

assayed by atomic absorption method in the Sterling Mine lab. 

Quality Control Pre-2001 

Historical reports have stated there were no notable discrepancies between the Sterling Mine 

assay results and check assays by outside assay laboratories. However, as with many old past 

working mines there is no detailed supporting documentation of the sample preparation, analysis, 

and security. 

The most convincing evidence of a properly functioning grade control system and assay lab is that 

the regular gold balance showed no irregularities / shortfalls being reported between the assay 

grades of the sampled material relative to the actual gold production shipped to the refiner. For

obvious security reasons, any differences between the reported gold grade sent to the leach pad 

and the resulting gold production delivered to the refiner would have been well scrutinized on an 

ongoing basis. There is no greater proof of assay grade accuracy then the refiner acknowledging 

the receipt of the correct number of gold ounces. 

11.1.3 Current Quality Control 2001 and 2011 Programs 

Imperial and previous owners have been actively prospecting the Sterling and adjacent properties 

for over 40 years. The following section describes the Quality Control procedures followed by 

Imperial Metals during their 2001 to 2011 programs.   

Since 2001, project management, logging and sampling, and the analysis of the drilling results at 

the Sterling Property have been implemented by Imperial's geological staff, or contract geologists 

working closely under Imperial's supervision and guidelines. Operating standards and criteria 

have been consistent, with careful management and security of data sets. This continuity has 

facilitated verification of material data. 

Drill cuttings for assay/geochemical analysis have been collected at five foot intervals consistently 

throughout all the RC and Core programs. In the 2001 RC drilling programs, all logging and sample 

enumeration was done or supervised by Imperial's Geological Staff. Digital output of logs was 

checked line by line against original hand logs.  The cuttings for each interval, emerging from the 

drill outlet were separated into two identical samples with a Johnson splitter; complete mixing 

was provided by the cyclone device immediately preceding the splitter outlets. The resulting pair 

of cuttings was collected in two identically numbered synthetic cloth bags which were allowed to 

dry somewhat before being placed into two corresponding nylon sacks. Each sack would be filled 

with 5 or 10 sample bags (depending on volume of recovery) representing 25 ft. or 50 ft. of 

consecutive samples, and the sack taped closed. One set or suite of these sacks of samples was 

retained on the property, and selected intervals were analyzed by the mine's own (atomic 

absorption) laboratory facilities for guidance. The other suite was kept in locked storage until it 

was sent out for independent assay. 

To assess the quality of outside laboratory procedures and reproducibility of results, blank and 

duplicate samples were inserted into the suites submitted to the outside laboratory. In general, 

one blank and one duplicate were run for each 100 feet (20 samples) of drill cuttings. For blanks 

a regular sample would be removed from a drill suite, and renumbered with a fictitious number 

corresponding to a non-existent depth interval greater than the ultimate length of that hole 

(unknown to the laboratory). In its place, a correctly numbered blank sample was inserted. 

Material for blanks was obtained from past drill holes, known (from fire assay) to contain gold 

values below the detection limit. When the fire assay results were received, they were checked 



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 11-3 

after insertion into the logs. The blank's value would be replaced with the correct assays for the 

corresponding sample number and re-checked, with no surviving errors. 

Material for duplicates was obtained from the split of the drill cuttings. As in the case of blanks, 

these samples were given fictitious numbers, avoiding any source of confusion or error with the 

regular suite. They were not inserted into the regular suite like the blanks, but were simply added 

to the end. 

Starting in 2008, all drilling programs at the Sterling Mine began using a standardized quality 

control program. The program consisted of a blank, standard and duplicate added to every series 

of 20 samples. Standards were formatted to know high, medium and low gold values. One blank 

and one duplicate were submitted for every 20 samples from the drill core. Material for blanks 

was obtained from old drill core (not related to the any Sterling Zones) known from fire assay to 

contain no more than 5 ppb gold. Blanks were frequently inserted into the sample sequence 

immediately following an interval suspected of being strongly mineralized, to check for inter- 

sample contamination during preparation and analysis in the laboratory. Duplicate samples were 

obtained by quartering the sample. If possible, duplicates were not selected from intervals of poor 

recovery, to conserve the available rock. If this was unavoidable, special care was taken to ensure 

a representative sample was taken. Standards and blanks were placed every 15 samples. 

Duplicates were used when good core recovery made it applicable. During the 2011 program drill 

cuttings were collected in a 5-gallon bucket, with samples taken at 5 foot intervals and each being 

sampled in duplicated  

Once the material had been collected, it was poured into sampling bags which had been pre- 

labeled by the geologist. A portion of the sample was retained in a chip tray for reference 

purposes. If no sample was recovered (e.g. loss of circulation), the driller wrote "no recovery" on 

the sample bag and the chip tray area is left unfilled. 

Sample bags and chip trays were left in a designated area for the geologist. The geologist 

transported the samples to the Sample Preparation Facility for processing. All duplicates were 

placed in secured storage. After the geologist logged each sample, a copy of the log was then 

submitted to the lab. The log was used for verifying the total number of samples and if any 

samples have been misplaced, lost or not recovered. Any discrepancies that still existed after 

referring to the log were settled by examining the chip tray. The samples were then prepared for 

laboratory analysis. All shipments included QC samples which were assigned a unique sample 

identification number.

The procedure for the 2011 program consisted of entering logged sample lengths (in feet) with 

an attached sample number. The 2011 QA/QC program included blank, duplicate and standard 

reference materials being inserted into the drilling sample sequence and submitted to the outside 

laboratory (Florin Analytical Services LLC), as totaled on Table 11.1. Approximately one QA/QC 

sample was inserted within every 10 consecutive drilling samples, accounting for roughly 10% of 

the mainstream (MS) samples submitted for analysis. By design, blank and duplicate assays were 

excluded from admission into the proper geological log-sample sequence, ensuring no corruption 

of actual results by quality control entries.

The use of standard reference material allows for the monitoring of bias and precision. The 

standard reference material used in the QA/QC program was obtained from "CDN Resource 

Laboratories" located in Langley, British Columbia. The material was certified by an independent 

geochemist (Dr. Barry Smee). The standard reference material consisted of three different grades 

(low, medium and high grade). 

Blank samples were inserted into the sampling stream to monitor for cross-contamination or 

miss-sequencing during sample prep or analysis. Material for blanks was obtained from past drill 

holes that contained gold values below detection limit. All submitted blank samples assayed 

below 0.0015 oz/st. 

Duplicate samples were taken to measure the precision of the analysis and how the analytical 

uncertainty can change with grade. Material was obtained from the corresponding suite of 

cuttings retained on site. All duplicate samples assayed within +/- 20% of the original sample 

value. 

When received, assay results were inserted against the corresponding sample number, and 

checked. 

The digital database was then sent to Imperial's head office in Vancouver, where the results of 

the data entry were re-checked again before being incorporated into the Sterling digital database. 

Further visual and geostatistical checks were carried out after the new data was loaded into 

MineSight®3D (mining software).

Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 11-5 

The February 2017 rock sampling program involved running standards, duplicates and blacks, the 

results of which were provided in a QC Certificate by ALS minerals laboratory in Elko, NV, USA. 

11.1.4 Analyses of Samples 

Historic samples (pre-2000) used in the resource calculations presented in this report were 

analyzed on site at the original Sterling Mine lab. As mentioned above and in the next section, 

most of the original paper assay records have been lost. The historical report titled "Development 

Plan Sterling Mine, Nevada" Swallow (1998) states: 

"All drill hole samples, face samples, and rib samples are assayed by atomic absorption method 

in the mine lab. High grade drill hole samples are sent to commercial labs for fire assays. The mine 

has produced reliable and consistent results over the past eighteen years as verified by check 

assays from independent labs." 

All 2001 samples were analyzed by Bondar Clegg, an independent geochemical services company. 

The Qualified person was not able to verify the accreditation of Bondar Clegg but they were 

acquired by ALS Chemex, an ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accredited lab in 2001. The sample sacks were 

picked up by Bondar Clegg personnel and taken to Sparks, Nevada for preparation. Samples were 

crushed, split and pulverized to –150 mesh. The pulps were then transferred to their laboratory 

in North Vancouver for gold fire assay with a lower detection limit of 5 ppb, and 35-element 

analysis by the ICP-OES technique, using aqua regia digestion. Copies of the results were 

forwarded to the project manager in Vancouver and to the Mine Geologist at Sterling. 

A new on-site atomic absorption assay (AA) lab was installed at the Sterling Mine in 2011.  

Initially, while the onsite lab was being tuned up, it was used only for check assays, with the main 

sample going to Florin Analytical Services in Reno, or the Mount Polley Mine Lab in BC, Canada." 

Florin Analytical Services is an independent commercial lab part of Kappes, Cassidy and Associates 

(KCA).  Florin Analytical Services is not accredited by any standards association.  Mount Polley 

Mine is owned by Imperial Metals who owned Sterling Mine at the time and are therefore not 

independent of the Sterling Mine.   

"The 2011 drilling program was conducted in November and December of 2011, by which time 

the on-site lab was being used as the main lab at the mine. All the 2011 samples were assayed at 

the mine, with duplicates of all high-grade sections going to the Assay lab at the Mount Polley 

Mine in Canada for fire assays." 

The samples collected from the February 2017 program were sent to ALS Minerals in Elko, NV, 

USA (accredited laboratory under ISO/IEC 17025:2005).  The assay certificates from ALS minerals 



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 11-6 

have been obtained and the assay results independently verified.  The sample preparation the lab 

performed was; received sample weight, crushing QC test, Pulverizing QC test, fine crushing (70% 

<2mm), split sample (riffler splitter) and pulverize split to 85% <75um.  The analytical procedures 

conducted by ALS were a 48 element four acid ICP-MS, Trace Hg by ICPMS, Au 30g FA ICP-AES 

finish and AU 30g FA-GRAV finish.  The results of the assay were based solely on the content of 

the sample submitted.  ALS Minerals provided Northern Empire with a QC certificate and a 

Certificate of Analysis for all 20 samples they tested.   

The proposed mining program in this report would also use the onsite lab for all analysis, with 

regular check assays going to Florin Analytical Services in Reno. 

11.1.5 Security of Samples 

Security procedures for assays samples that were being followed during the original operation of 

the Sterling Mine, were typical of operations run at that time. Samples were delivered from the 

surface drilling rig or from underground by the Mine Geologist or Supervising Shifter to the sample 

preparation area at the end of each shift. The samples were then in the care of the Mine Assayer 

and his staff for drying, splitting and assaying. Assays findings were then sent to the Mine Manager 

for distribution. A split at regular intervals was sent to an independent lab for check assaying. The 

remainder of the drilling samples were stored in locked storage trailers and/or locked steel 

containers for long-term storage. 

During the 2001 and 2011 drilling programs, all drill cuttings and core samples were removed from 

the drill site during drill shifts by a geologist. The sacks or core boxes were taken to the logging 

trailer, or to windowless steel containers which are used for permanent storage of all samples and 

core. The trailer and container lock combinations were known only to the Exploration Manager, 

the Mine Manager, and the geologists logging and sampling the drill core. 

Core samples were placed in individual heavy-duty plastic bags and closed with special plastic zip 

straps which have a unique, alpha-numeric, non-sequenced code on each tag. Once closed, the 

bag cannot be opened without destroying the tag.  The tag number was recorded in the sample 

tag booklet. Thus, any illegitimate re-bagging of the samples could be demonstrated by 

discrepancies in sample bag closure. 

From the available information reviewed, it is the Author's opinion that the sample preparation, 

sample security, and analytical procedures are adequate.

11.2 North Block Deposits 

There is no available information about the preparation, analyses and security of samples taken 

from material sampled during drilling of the North Block deposits.  

Between February 19 and 21, 2017, geological staff from Northern Empire collected 20 rock 

samples from the Fluorspar Canyon area near the Daisy deposits. Rock chip samples were taken 

from 19 of the locations, while Sample 256279 was taken from material that was not in situ. An 

appropriate amount of sample was collected from each sample location, which are shown on 

Table 9.1. Each sample was described, given an independent sample identification number, and 

the coordinates of each sample location in NAD 83, Zone 11 was recorded. All samples were 

directly transported by Northern Empire personnel to ALS Minerals in Reno, Nevada, which is an 

independent certified laboratory under the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and conforms with 

the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025:2005 (CAN-P-4E) 

Following cataloguing of the received samples, the samples were processed in ALS Minerals' 

laboratory facility in Elko, Nevada (accredited laboratory under ISO/IEC 17025:2005) . Processing 

of the samples involved completion of a fine crush so that 70% of the material was less than 2 

mm in size. Samples were then split via a Riffle Splitter. The resulting split samples were then 

pulverized so that 85% of the material had a size less than 75 µm. ALS Minerals completed quality 

checks of the crush and pulverization procedure, as stated on Certificate of Analysis EL17034628. 

Following completing of the sample processing, 30 g sub-samples from the pulverized material 

was sent to ALS Minerals' laboratory in Vancouver (accredited laboratory under ISO/IEC 

17025:2005). All samples were fire assay tested, and finished with an inductively coupled plasma 

atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis to assess gold content. For samples that were 

determined during this initial test to contain more than 10 ppm gold, as was the case with samples 

256277 and 256283, an additional 30 g sub-sample was again fire assayed, and subsequently 

finished with a gravimetric technique (FA-GRAV).  

It is the The Norwest's Qualified Person's opinion that the sample preparation, sample security, 

and analytical procedures completed by ALS Minerals' laboratory facilities was adequate.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Data Verification Procedures Applied By Qualified Person 

12.1.1 Sterling Deposit -  

Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the open pit deposits at the Sterling mine site on February 21 

and 23, 2017. Norwest Qualified Persons located in the field and verified the locations of drill hole 

collar locations at Water Tank Hill and Panama; listed in Table 12.1.  Host rocks and the alteration 

assemblage that is associated with the Sterling Deposit is consistent with those of typical Carlin-

style deposits.  In addition, the faults observed at the Sterling Deposit align with those previously 

recorded at the mine site. 

Norwest Qualified Persons also reviewed the core boxes that contained the core that was drilled 

on the Sterling Property in 2013 and 2014 as part of the "SU" series drill campaign, and verified 

the presence of alteration that aligned with that described at the Sterling Deposit. The core is 

housed in a storage facility at the Sterling Mine site office complex.  In addition to examination of 

the 2013 and 2014 drill core, assay certificates and representative samples from the Sterling 

deposits, analysed during the 2011 program, were verified to be stored at the storage facility at 

the Sterling Mine site office complex.  Laboratory assay certificates from 2006 to 2009 were 

available in excel spreadsheet format, and were spot checked by Norwest Qualified Persons to 

verify the accuracy of the geochemical data included in the Sterling model.

Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the existing Daisy open pit mine workings on February 22, 

2017. The host rocks and mineralization in the vicinity of the Daisy Deposit area were examined 

and aligned with the interpretation that the host rocks in the vicinity of the Daisy Deposit 

supported the deposit being a Carlin-style. 

Sunday Night Anomaly Deposit: Norwest's Qualified Persons visited the proposed location of the 

Sunday Night Anomaly Deposit on February 22, 2017.  

On February 23, 2017, Norwest's Qualified Persons located and reviewed chip sample trays from 

holes drilled on the Beatty Volcanics Project in January 1982, and on the Fluorspar Canyon Project 

in 1985. The core is housed in a storage facility at the Sterling Mine site office complex. 

12.2 Limitations to Data Validation by Qualified Person 

12.2.1 Sterling Deposit 

Sampling protocol, sample chain of custody, original geological descriptive logs, and the original 

assay certificates could not be located for samples analysed pre-2000, most of which were 

analysed at the on-site Sterling Mine Laboratory. As such, the quality of the pre-2000 analysed 

from the Sterling Mine laboratory could not be validated. 

12.2.2  North Block Deposits 

With exception of the chip boards that were collected during the 1982 and 1985 drilling 

campaigns, no additional original datasets were accessible to Norwest's Qualified Persons.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The majority of the following text is from the report titled "Sterling Gold Mine, Nye County 

Nevada, U.S.A.", by D. Smithies, G. Gillstrom, and P. Sterling, January 21, 2015. 

13.1 Past and Present Production 

Production at the Sterling Mine has shown, through historical operations, that the mineralized 

rock is amenable to cyanide leaching using heap leach technology. The Sterling Mine was in 

operation from 1980 through 2002. Mineralized rock mined from underground and open pit 

sources was hauled to a 27-acre lined heap leach pad, stacked and leached with a cyanide 

solution. The mineralized rock was placed in the leach pad at its run of mine size gradation without 

primary or secondary crushing. The historic production at the Sterling Mine is shown in Table 13.1. 

Table 13.1 

Historic Sterling Mine Production 1980 - 2002 

Historic Sterling Production 

Total Tons Stacked on the Heap 941,340 tons 

Average Grade 0.217 opt 

Production of Gold Ounces 194,996 ounces 

 

In the third quarter of 2011, construction of a new 3.5-acre (300,000 ton) heap leach pad 

expansion project commenced. Construction was completed in March of 2012 and leaching with 

cyanide solution started in April 2012. The first gold pour from the 144 Zone occurred in July 2012. 

At the end of 2012, a total of 2,852 ounces of gold had been poured and shipped to Johnson 

Matthey in Salt Lake City. 

The 144 Zone underground mining operation production to March 2014 is listed in Table 13.2.

Note 1 – The term ore is used for historical context and sufficient work has not been done to support its 

classification under current NI43-101 criteria. 

 

The leaching of the stack with a cyanide solution continued for several months after completion 

of the underground operation in early 2015, to insure the highest return of recoverable gold. 

 

The permitting of a future 20-acre heap leach pad was in process when the Sterling Mine was 

placed in care and maintenance. Approval for construction of the future heap leach facility has 

been secured; however, construction is on hold. The new heap leach facility will receive blasted 

rock from an open pit operation. Based on the current price of gold, material between the Sterling 

Pit, Ambrose Pit and Burro Pit will be incorporated into one large Pit. The process to recover the 

gold from the blasted rock will use the existing infrastructure for the planned 3.5-acre heap 

expansion. The only addition other than the heap leach pad expansion will be the construction of 

a 1.4-million-gallon surge pond. The existing surge pond will become the intermediate pond for 

the new fluid management strategy. 

13.2 Metallurgical Test Programs 

With over 20 years of actual heap leach results, it was deemed not necessary to conduct any new 

metallurgical tests on the gold mineralization associated with the Sterling deposits. Before 

starting mining in the 144 Zone, a comprehensive metallurgical test program was performed on 

mineralization from it to assess if it was equally amenable to heap leach extraction. 

The test work focused on two areas of gold mineralization; West of the Dyke (main mineralized 

body) and East of the Dyke (smaller lower grade zone). Metallurgical test work was carried out at 



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 13-3 

Kappes, Cassiday and Associates (KCA) in Reno, Nevada, and at the Sterling Mine near Beatty, 

Nevada. 

The nature of the test work was to determine the optimum economical gold recovery from 

underground material at different particle sizes. The results from the test program were used to 

determine whether leaching Run-of-Mine (ROM) rock would yield the best economic recovery of 

gold or if size reduction was required using crushing equipment. The tests were conducted in 

logical sequence to determine an acceptable commercially viable process. 

The test program used standard laboratory cyanide leaching procedures. The mineralized rock 

was tested on particle sizes as follows; Run-of-Mine (ROM minus 6 inch), minus 3 inch, minus ¾ 

inch, minus 10 mesh and minus 200 mesh. The final recovery for the 144 Zone was predicted to 

be 70%.  

13.3 Reagents 

Metallurgical testing confirmed that the Sterling Mine mineralized rock is amenable to cyanide 

leaching using Heap Leach Technology. The main reagents used are Sodium Cyanide and Lime. 

The test work reported that 0.25 pounds of cyanide per ton of material is required and 3 pounds 

of Lime per ton of mineralized rock. 

The lime will be blended with the blasted rock as it is hauled to the pad. Each truck receives a 

fixed amount of Lime from a Lime silo. Cyanide will be received in liquid form from Cyanco and 

pumped into the solution lines feeding the heap leach operation.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Approach 

In accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards, Qualified Persons employed at Norwest validated 

the drill hole and sample data set, and created geologic models for the purposes of generating 

resource estimates within the Sterling Property that includes the Sterling Deposit and North Block 

deposits.  

The geologic model construction outlined below was used as the basis for estimating mineral 

resources. 

14.2 Basis for Resource Determination 

NI 43-101 specifies that the definitions of the CIM Guidelines be used for the identification of 

resources. The CIM Resource and Reserve Definition Committee (2014) produced the following 

statement: 

"Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, 

Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence 

than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher 

level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than a 

Measured Mineral Resource." 

The CIM Definition of Resources (2014) is as follows:  

"A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or 

on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity 

and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted 

from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling." 

"Material of economic interest refers to diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural 

solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals." 

The committee went on to state the following:  

"The term Mineral Resource covers mineralization and natural material of intrinsic economic 

interest which has been identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and within 



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 14-2 

which Mineral Reserves may subsequently be defined by the consideration and application of 

Modifying Factors. The phrase 'reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction' implies a 

judgment by the Qualified Person in respect of the technical and economic factors likely to 

influence the prospect of economic extraction. The Qualified Person should consider and clearly 

state the basis for determining that the material has reasonable prospects for eventual economic 

extraction. Assumptions should include estimates of cut-off grade and geological continuity at the 

selected cut-off, metallurgical recovery, smelter payments, commodity price or product value, 

mining and processing method and mining, processing and general and administrative costs. The 

Qualified Person should state if the assessment is based on any direct evidence and testing." 

"Interpretation of the word 'eventual' in this context may vary depending on the commodity or 

mineral involved. For example, for some coal, iron, potash deposits and other bulk minerals or 

commodities, it may be reasonable to envisage 'eventual economic extraction' as covering time 

periods in excess of 50 years. However, for many gold deposits, application of the concept would 

normally be restricted to perhaps 10 to 15 years, and frequently to much shorter periods of time." 

14.3 Data Sources 

Information used to compile the geologic models used for resource estimation included the 

following information provided by Northern Empire: 

• exploration sample data; 

• geologic models; 

• underground survey data; 

• internal technical reports; and  

• surface topography data.  

Exploration sample data comprised 5-foot incremental sample results of gold grades in troy 

ounces per ton (opt). Lithologic rock codes associated with the sample results were also included 

in the sample data set for the Sterling property, and to a lesser extent, for the SNA deposit of the 

North Block. The remaining North Block deposits exploration drilling sample results did not 

include associated rock codes. The Sterling sample dataset also included sample results from 

underground rib (sidewall) workings. All exploration sample data was accompanied by orientated 

survey coordinates using the Sterling Mine grid system in imperial units of measurement. 

Provided geologic models included 3D block models covering the Sterling Deposit and SNA deposit 

of the North Block. The Sterling Deposit block models comprised three separate models each 

covering three geographic areas of the Sterling Deposit. These are: Ambrose-Panama Pit in the

Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 14-3 

southeast, Sterling Pit in the west central area and Burro-WTH Pit areas in the north. The Sterling 

Deposit block models also included mineralized zone solids and solids of underground workings 

below the current pits. These block models were used by Imperial for their internal and ongoing 

resource evaluation of the Sterling and SNA deposits. 

Included with the provided block models were internal Imperial Technical Reports that included 

documentation on provided geologic models, high-level theoretical mine plans for the Sterling 

Property and presentation slides of the North Block deposit gold mineralization potential.   

Surface topography data covering the extent of Sterling Deposit and North Block deposits was 

provided by Northern Empire. The surface topography data was provided in the Sterling Mine grid 

system and identified by Norwest to be accurate for resource estimation to at least an inferred 

level of assurance for both the Sterling and North Block deposits. 

Figure 14-1 illustrates the surface topography and exploration drill hole locations covering the 

extent of Norwest's independent geologic models for the Sterling Deposit and the North Block 

deposits. Figure 14-2 illustrates key features of the provided data of relevance to Norwest's 

geologic model of the Sterling deposit, notably drilling and sampling extent, provided mineralized 

solid, underground works and associated sidewall sample locations. Figure 14-3 is a high-level 

illustration of the exploration drilling and sampling coverage of Norwest's three North Block 

models, called Daisy, Secret Pass and SNA. 

14.4 Models 

Norwest independent geologic models used for gold resource estimation were constructed using 

MineSight® (v11.00-1) software using 3D block modeling methods. The model dimensions and 

extent are outlined in Figure 14-1 and subsequent Section 14 illustrations. All models were 

constructed using the Sterling Mine grid coordinate system that uses imperial units. Table 14.1 

outlines the 3D block model parameters for the individual resource areas.

The Sterling model covers the three existing surface pits as illustrated in Figure 14-1, namely: 

1. Ambrose-Panama Pit 

2. Sterling Pit 

3. Burro-WTH Pit 

 

The Daisy model covers two regions of the Daisy deposit, namely: Daisy West, centered around a 

historic mining pit shown in Figure 14-1 and Daisy South located southeast of the Daisy West pit, 

also illustrated in Figure 14-1. The Secret Pass model also includes a historical surface pit as is 

indicated in Figure 14-1. There is no history of previous mining within the bounds of the SNA 

deposit. 

Original work by Norwest in the construction of the geologic models is limited to:  

• 3D block models covering pit areas and mineralized zones identified from provided drill 

hole records and solids of the mineralized intervals; 

• independent geostatistical analysis of the sample data and estimation algorithms; and  



 
 

 

 

Northern Empire Resources Corp.  993-1 
Technical Report 
Sterling Property, Nye County, Nevada, USA: A Property Under Option to Purchase by Northern Empire 14-8 

• construction of Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) pit shells using independently assessed mining 

extraction costs and revenue.  

Prior to modeling the provided exploration and sampling data was checked for errata. This 

included, but was not limited to, the following checks: 

• anomalous drill hole collar locations in undisturbed areas; 

• overlapping sample intervals; 

• outliers in grade and thickness; and  

• lithologic and grade matching provided mineralization solids.  

  

The total number of sample sites and assay intervals used in the four separate geological models 

are outlined in Table 14.2. The Sterling model sample sites and assay intervals listed in Table 14.2 

are limited to relevant data penetrating the provided mineralized solid and includes underground 

rib and face samples.  In the Daisy, Secret Pass and SNA model sample sites refers to the number 

of drill holes used to model the mineralized zones.

A geostatistical evaluation of the sample data listed in Table 14.2 was completed using MineSight® 

software. Figure 14-4 illustrates the 3D anisotropic grade trends for a single structure as derived 

from multi-directional semi-variogram analysis of the provided data. As illustrated in Figure 14-4 

the Sterling and SNA deposits have a north-south (WN Plan) dominant grade trend whereas the 

Daisy and Secret Pass deposits indicate southwest to northeast dominant grade trend. The grade 

trends are consistent with the regional mineralization described in Section 7. 

Ordinary kriging has been used for estimating gold grades (opt) into the 3DBM using semi-

variogram grade trends illustrated in Figure 14-4. Although no significant nugget effect at high 

grade cut-offs (greater than 0.2 opt) was observed in the provided sample data, the sampled data 

used for grade estimation was capped at three standard deviations. Additional estimation 

parameters used for modeling are listed in Table 14.3.

Significant material differences between the modeling of Sterling Deposit and North Block 

deposits include the following: 

• For the Sterling Deposit model, only those sample intervals penetrating the provided and 

validated mineralized interval solids were estimated into blocks coded with the 

mineralized interval solid volume. The North Block deposit sample sites did not include 

rock code data of sufficient quality to outline solids of the mineralized intervals together 

with assay results. Instead, North Block mineralized zones were identified exclusively on 

grade distribution trends using geostatistical parameters outlined in Figure 14-4 and Table 

14.3. 

• The volume of the underground works has been removed from the Sterling topography 

volume to exclude the underground volume from the gold resource. There is no known 

underground mining within the mineralized zones of North Block deposits. 

• Un-sampled (null-grade) 5-foot composite intervals for the North Block exploration 

drilling were replaced with zero (0) grade and a maximum number of composite samples 

of six were used for estimating block grades in the North Block deposits as opposed to 15 

used for the Sterling deposit. This difference in approach was to ensure that there was no 

estimation of gold grades into blocks penetrated by North Block drill holes whose nearest 

grade interval includes un-sampled, likely waste rock, intervals. The Sterling Deposit has 

a defined mineralized zone solid and as such there is no risk associated with estimation 

of gold grades into surrounding waste rock intervals.  

Figure 14-5 provides examples of the gold grade distribution for the Sterling and North Block 

models. The Sterling model grade trends are best illustrated in plan view where the semi-

transparent blocks indicated highest grades to be orientated along the western boundary of the 

fault constrained mineralized zone and along north-south orientated subsidiary displacements to 

the Sterling thrust plane located within or below the solid of the mineralized zone.

Grade trends in the North Block deposits shown on Figure 14-5 are best illustrated in cross-

section.  

The Daisy deposit has three mineralized zones that include:  

• remaining mineralized zones within the current Daisy Pit at West Zone (Daisy West); 

• a mineralized zone east of the current Daisy Pit; and  

• a deeper mineralized zone in the south east at South Zone (Daisy South). 

The mineralization at Secret Pass plunges towards the northeast away from the current pit to a 

depth of approximately 750 ft (229 m) below surface. Observation of the provided surface 

topography data and confirmed from the site inspections, showed that that there was a highwall 

failure into the current pit. This waste material volume has been accounted for in the Secret Pass 

geologic model as indicated in Figure 14-5. The mineralized zones identified in the SNA deposit 

increase in depth from south to north to a maximum depth indicated in the Figure 14-5 cross 

section of approximately 550 ft (167 m).     

Outputs from the Sterling and North Block models were compared with information in the 

provided Imperial internal Technical Reports, the results of which are consistent with reported 

mineralization trends, grade and tons.

14.5 Gold Resource Estimates 

The resource estimates are based on pit constrained surface resources (note – Sterling Deposit 

includes discussion of potential incremental tonnage below resource pit shell as discussed below). 

The surface resource includes mineralized gold blocks limited to within a 45-degree constant slope 

pit shell.  All resource estimates include estimates of contained ounces within the constrained pit 

shells as shown on Tables 14.4A through 14.7B.  Table 14.8A and 14.8B summarize the base case 

gold resources for each of the deposit areas in imperial and metric units. Note – The base cases 

for the Inferred Resource for each deposit is indicated by shading and bold type face in the 

respective tables. 

The pit shell is defined by a 0.01 opt minimum gold cut-off grade, a US$2.10 per ton (US$2.31 per 

tonne) mining cost, and a gold price of US$1,200 per oz.  Mine rock and mineralization density 

was based on 2.5 tonnes/m3 for all areas except Secret Pass, which was assigned a 2.2 tonnes/m3 

density due to the volcanic nature of the host rock.  Modifying factors considered for the 

definition of mineralized zones into classified resources of eventual economic interest include the 

following: 

• Metallurgical recovery factors ranging from 80 – 88% depending on rock type for 

conventional heap leach operations. 

• Gold price of $1,200 per ounce. 

• Allowance for dilution and mining losses in the calculation of the cut-off grade. 

• Mining costs of $2.10/ton mined and combined leaching, site costs and overhead of 

approximately $3/ton placed on the leach pad. 

• Refining and royalty costs of $16/oz with a payable metal factor of approximately 97%. 

Truck and shovel surface operations are the primary mining method. Mining, leaching, site and 

smelter royalty and other cost inputs have been based on historical site costs adjusted for current 

regional cost/factors.  The level of detail of cost estimation and mining evaluation is deemed to 

be appropriate for the definition of resources prior to undertaking a preliminary economic 

assessment (PEA) level evaluation. A range of minimum cut-off grades based on the factors listed 

above are presented for each resource type that represent a reasonable prospect for eventual 

economic extraction. For comparison, average gold grades are listed using both imperial 

measurement in oz per ton (opt) (A-series) and metric measurements in grams per tonne (g/t) (B-

series).  

For the Sterling Deposit, resources defined as "non-pit constrained" represent mineralized 

tonnages of potential economic interest if selective underground mining of mineralized zone 

below the projected pit shell limits was carried out.  If underground mining methods, similar to

those employed previously at the Sterling Mine were utilized subsequent to surface mining, a 

cutoff grade of 0.05 oz per tonne could be supported (based on mining costs of $45/ton).

These resources have been classified as Inferred due to lack of documentation for a substantial 

amount of the historical sampling and assay programs. Much of exploration data was collected 

from 1980 to 1997, before the current stringent quality control standards were required for the 

reporting of resources.  

As defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, "An Inferred Mineral 

Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated 

based on limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but 

not verify geological and grade or quality continuity."   

The pit shell used to define surface constrained resources is illustrated in Figure 14-6. The plan 

view extent of the mineralized grade shell at 0.03 opt (1.0 g/t) cut-off together with the pit shell 

crest is illustrated in Figure 14-7. 

14.6 Cautionary Statement 

The accuracy of resource estimates is, in part, a function of the quality and quantity of available 

data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Given the data available at 

the time; the estimates presented herein are considered reasonable. However, they should be 

accepted with the understanding that additional data and analysis available after the date of the 

estimates may necessitate revision. These revisions may be material.  

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and there is no assurance that any mineral resources 

will ultimately be reclassified as Proven or Probable reserves.  Mineral resources which are not 

mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

The following is a list of potential risks that impacts the accuracy of the Inferred gold resource 

estimate: 

• Much of exploration data was collected from 1980 to 1997, before the current stringent 

quality control standards were required for the reporting of resources. 

• The accuracy of the underground excavation survey data impacting the Sterling Deposit 

resource cannot be directly measured since these galleries are no longer accessible due 

to safety concerns and /or may have collapsed. 

• North Block resource estimates are based on grade trends observed in the provided assay 

data only. These grade trends are associated with structural features and lithologies not 

recorded in sufficient detail in the available exploration data as of the effective date of

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Qualified Person has been unable to verify the information below, and the information below 

is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization of the Sterling Property that is subject to this 

Technical Report. 

The Diamond Queen (Goldspar) Mine, situated along the east flank of Bare Mountain, is located 

north of the deposits in the Sterling area (Figure 7-1). The Diamond Queen Mine ceased 

operations in 1967. Prior to 1958, the Diamond Queen Mine produced gold from small breccia 

pockets or pods along faults, but no production records are available (Smithies et al., 2015).  

The Mother Lode Deposit location is at the base of the northeast flank of Bare Mountain, about 

15 km northwest of the Yucca Mountain, near the eastern end of the Fluorite Canyon Fault. The 

deposit amenable to open pit mining was mined-out in 1992 (Nevada Bureau of Mines and 

Geology, 1992). Goldcorp owns the claim blocks that encompass the Mother Lode Deposit  

(Figure 4-2). 

The North Bullfrog property, owned by Corvus Gold Inc., is located 10 km north of Beatty, Nevada, 

and 8 km north of the Bullfrog Mine, which previously was owned by Barrick Gold Corporation 

(Figure 7-1). The North Bullfrog Property consists of approximately 75 km2 of mining claims. North 

Bullfrog Property is a large, low-sulphidation, epithermal bulk-tonnage gold system that is 

primarily hosted in middle Miocene Sierra Blanca Tuff. The precious metal mineralization is hosted 

in 1) high-grade, structurally controlled fissure veins and associated stockworks, and 2) in low-

grade disseminated or replacement deposits in altered volcanic rocks (Wilson et al., 2016). 

Opposite the Sterling Mine, on the west side of the Bare Mountains is the Reward Property, now 

containing both the Reward and Gold Ace deposits. Atna Resources has since gone into 

receivership and the Reward Property is held by Waterton Global (Nov. 26, 2014, PR Newswire).  

The Reward Property was classified by Atna Resources as an epithermal, low-sulphide stockwork 

gold deposit (Figure 7-1).

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Four gold deposits are identified on the Sterling Property. These deposits are Sterling, Daisy, 

Secret Pass and SNA. The Daisy, Secret Pass and SNA deposits are located north of the Sterling 

Deposit and are collectively called the North Block deposits. The Sterling, Daisy, and Secret Pass 

deposits were previously mined. Sterling, Daisy and SNA are carbonate-hosted and classified as 

Carlin-type deposits, while Secret Pass is volcanic-hosted and classified as an epithermal deposit. 

Gold mineralization is concentrated along faults or is aligned with the regional structural fabric.   

The available data for these deposits is sufficient to support an Inferred gold mineral resource 

within each deposit. These resources have been classified as Inferred due to lack of 

documentation for a substantial amount of the historical sampling and assay programs. Much of 

available data was collected between 1980 to 1997, before the current stringent quality control 

standards were implemented for resource reporting.  

The resource estimates are based on pit constrained surface resources (note – Sterling Deposit 

includes discussion of potential incremental tonnage below resource pit shell as discussed below). 

The surface resource includes mineralized gold blocks limited to within a 45-degree constant slope 

pit shell.  All resource estimates include estimates of contained ounces within the constrained pit 

shells including modifying factors as discussed in Section 14.  Modifying factors considered for the 

definition of mineralized zones into classified resources of eventual economic interest. 

For the Sterling Deposit, resources defined as "non-pit constrained" represent mineralized 

tonnages of potential economic interest if selective underground mining of mineralized zone 

below the projected pit shell limits was carried out.  If underground mining methods, similar to 

those employed previously at Sterling Mine were utilized subsequent to surface mining, a cutoff 

grade of 0.05 oz per tonne could be supported. 

  Tables 25.1 and 25.2 summarize the base case gold resources for each of the deposit areas in 

imperial and metric units.

• *Denotes resources that are calculated based on cyanide soluble assays. 
• CIM definitions are followed for classification of Mineral Resource.  

• Mineral Resource surface pit extent has been estimated using a gold price of US$1,200 per ounce and a US$2.10 per ton mining cost 
and gold recovery ranging from 80 – 88% depending upon rock type. 

• Sterling non-pit constrained resources below the surface pit and targeted for underground mining are based on a gold price 
of US$1,200 per ounce and mining costs of $US45 per ton.  Other modifying factors remain unchanged.  

• Totals may not represent the sum of the parts due to rounding.  

• The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by Derek Loveday, P. Geo. of Norwest Corporation in conformity with CIM 
"Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian 
Securities Administrators NI43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Potential risks that impact the accuracy of the Inferred gold resource estimate include: 

• Much of the available data was collected between 1980 and 1997, before the current 

stringent quality control standards were required for resource reporting.  

• The accuracy of the underground excavation survey data impacting the Sterling resource 

cannot be directly measured since these galleries are no longer accessible due to safety 

concerns and/or they may have collapsed.  

• North Block resource estimates are based on grade trends observed in the provided assay 

data only. These grade trends are associated with structural features and lithologies not 

recorded in sufficient detail in the available exploration data as of the effective date of 

the resource estimate. 

 

Based on Norwest's evaluation and resource estimates, it has been concluded that the Sterling 

Property merits additional exploration and evaluation to further the development of the property.  

Norwest's recommendations for the next stage of exploration and evaluation are contained in 

Section 26.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Resource confidence for the Sterling and North Block deposits can be improved to Measured and 

Indicated status from the current Inferred level of assurance, by implementing confirmatory and 

infill drilling, sampling and through use of higher resolution topographic information.  A viable 

topographic survey method is Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey.  Classification as 

measured and indicated resources would support potential reserves definition once pre-

feasibility level evaluation is completed. 

Table 26.1 shows an estimate of requirements to be completed in the next phase to increase the 

level of assurance in accordance with CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves 

Best Practices" guidelines. Additional phases of drilling will be required as the project advances 

to further increase the level of assurance of each of the deposits. The proposed method of drilling 

would include both core and RC holes.

Implementation of the above recommended program will provide the following material benefits: 

• Twinned samples will be fire assayed by independent certified laboratories to assess the 

accuracy of the Atomic Absorption assay method that is implemented at Sterling Mine. 

• Twinning of historical holes and comparison of assay and lithologic records to assess the 

accuracy of historical records. 

• Infill coring and RC drilling will provide the structural, lithologic and grade for better 

refinement of the North Block deposits mineralization models and solids of the 

mineralized intervals.

• Metallurgical testing will provide additional information to refine gold recovery methods. 

• Completion of a LiDAR survey will help identify and reconcile natural soil/waste 

movement overlying the current resource areas that may be material to the estimate. In 

addition, a LiDAR survey can identify potential fault locations.
