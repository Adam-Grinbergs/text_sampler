1.0 SUMMARY 
 

1.1 Executive Summary 

INTRODUCTION 
 

This Back Forty Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) "Technical Report" was completed 

by the authors for Aquila Resources Inc. (Aquila).  This Technical Report conforms to the 

CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves definitions referred to in National Instrument 

(NI) 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  

 

Hudbay Minerals Inc. (Hudbay) and Aquila have entered into a Joint Venture Agreement on 

the Back Forty project, with Hudbay as operator and currently owning 51% of the project.  

Hudbay has the option to increase its ownership interest in the project to 65% by completing 

a feasibility study and submitting a mine permit application to the State of Michigan. 

 

The Back Forty property consists of approximately 6,700 acres of private and state mineral 

lands located in Lake and Holmes Townships owned by the Hudbay Aquila Back Forty Joint 

Venture (BFJV) through leases, outright purchases, options to purchase, and State of 

Michigan metallic mineral leases.  This acreage does not include land tenure outside the 

immediate surrounding area of the Back Forty Project Area (property).  The property land 

block is situated in Township 35N, Range 29W, portions of Sections 1, 11, and 12, in T35N, 

R28W, portions of Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, all in Lake Township, as well as in T36N, R28W 

portions of Section 32 and 33 in Holmes Township, Menominee County, Michigan. The 

project is centered at latitude 45° 27' N and longitude 87° 51' W. 

 

The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered 

too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would 

enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the PEA 

assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. 

 

The Back Forty volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit is one of a number of deposits located 

throughout the Ladysmith-Rhinelander volcanic complex in northern Wisconsin and western 

Michigan.  The complex lies within the lower Proterozoic Penokean Volcanic Belt (PVB).  

The PVB is part of the Southern Structural subprovince of the Canadian Shield.  The Back 

Forty deposit lies within a felsic centre as do most of the other deposits in the belt.  Host 

rhyolites are strongly altered by quartz-sericite-pyrite.  Mineralization at the Back Forty 

deposit consists of discrete zones of 1) zinc or copper-rich massive sulfide, which may 

contain significant amounts of gold, 2) stockwork stringer sulfide, which can be gold, zinc, 

and copper-bearing, 3) precious metal-only, low sulfide mineralization, and 4) oxide-rich, 

precious metal-bearing gossan.

Between 2002 and 2010, 478 exploration diamond drill holes and five geotechnical diamond 

drill holes were drilled at Back Forty for a total of approximately 94,000 meters.  Currently, all 

drill core is logged geologically, geotechnically and marked for sampling at the field office 

facility then transferred to a nearby core facility in Carney, MI for photographing, cutting, 

sampling and archiving.  

 

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

The potential economic viability of the Back Forty deposit was evaluated using measured, 

indicated and inferred mineral resources and a discounted pre-tax cash flow analysis 

approach.  In summary, based on the assumptions used for this PEA the results indicate 

that: 

 

• Proposed life of mine of approximately 7 years at a full production rate of 3,000tpd 

and a payback of capital after 3 years of mining  

• Average unit operating costs of $36.79/tonne mined and processed over the life of 

the project 

• Total LOM capital of $272.3M, includes $224.7M for initial project capital required to 

build the mine, site infrastructure, sulfide flotation and oxide leach plant and 

purchase of new mining equipment to achieve commercial production 

• The project has a pre-tax cash flow of $211.8M, with a NPV8% of $73.6M and an 

18.2% IRR 

• Over the LOM Back Forty is expected to produce 77,200 tonnes of copper 

concentrate, 323,500 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 295,300 ounces of gold and 

2,561,700 ounces of silver contained in gold-silver alloy dore product and within the 

copper concentrate 

• Net payable gross revenue of $786.8M is from copper and zinc concentrates and 

gold-silver alloy dore 

 

The portion of the measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred 

mineral resources used for evaluation purposes in the PEA is shown in Table 1.1, after 

applying allowances for dilution and mining losses based on an assumed mining production 

schedule and pre-tax cash flow analysis.

Table 1.1 

 
 
The mine plan assesses the potential economic viability of mining only the nearer surface 

mineralization by open pit methods.  Potential underground mining of deeper mineralization 

is not evaluated in this report. 

 

The two types of mineralization will be hauled from the open pit mine to the proposed 

processing area.  The gold bearing oxide material will be fed from its crushed stockpile to the 

approximate 600tpd Oxide leach plant, where it will be ground, leached with a cyanide 

solution to dissolve the gold and silver and washed via a series of counter current 

decantation thickners.  The sulfide material will be ground and treated by froth flotation at an 

approximate rate of 2,500tpd to produce a copper mineral concentrate and a zinc mineral 

concentrate. 

 

The capital and operating costs used for the preliminary economic assessment are based on 

a mixture of new quotations from suppliers and contractors, similar recent project costs, and 

cost database information from Foth, Lyntek, SRK, and Hudbay.   

 

A sensitivity analysis for the Back Forty project cash flow is summarized in Figure 1.1.  The 

project is most sensitive to the metal price followed by mined grade, operating costs and 

capital costs respectively.

CONCLUSIONS 

 

This technical report has used investigation and analysis that are considered appropriate for 

a preliminary economic assessment level of study.   

 

The following presents the interpretations and conclusions of this preliminary economic 

assessment: 

 

Geology 

The Back Forty volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit is one of a number of deposits 

located throughout the Ladysmith-Rhinelander volcanic complex in northern Wisconsin 

and western Michigan. The complex lies within the lower Proterozoic Penokean 

Volcanic Belt (PVB). The PVB is part of the Southern Structural subprovince of the 

Canadian Shield. The Back Forty deposit lies within a felsic centre as do most of the 

other deposits in the belt. Host rhyolites are strongly altered by quartz-sericite-pyrite.  

Mineralization at the Back Forty deposit consists of discrete zones of 1) zinc or copper-

rich massive sulfide, which may contain significant amounts of gold, 2) stockwork 

stringer sulfide, which can be gold, zinc, and copper-bearing, 3) precious metal-only, 

low sulfide mineralization, and 4) oxide-rich, precious metal-bearing gossan. 

 

Mineral Resource 

The mineral resource estimate with an effective date of October 15, 2010 was used for 

this PEA.  The geological model of mineralization was initially constructed by Aquila 

personnel and Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) reconstructed new mineral wireframes 

to assess the bulk mining potential of the significant gold and lower grade base metal 

mineralization outside the original model.  Gold and zinc both contribute significantly to 

the economics and cut-offs of 1g/t gold or 0.5% zinc was used to delineate the 

mineralization.  The quantity of silver was also used as a guide to ensure that 

significant value was not missed.  In general, the modelling attempted to contain as 

much material with significant amounts of these three elements, while maintaining as 

little 'barren' material as possible.  Eleven separate domains were modelled, including 

the cross-cutting dyke material, and given unique numeric zone codes.  Resource 

classification strategy included parameters used in the estimate based on the gold 

variograms and the assumption that the majority of the deposit would be extracted by 

open pit methods.  The resource was classified into measured, indicated and inferred 

resources based on a minimum number of composites estimated within a 

predetermined search distance.  NSR ($/tonne) was assigned to each block by 

combining the contribution by each element from proposed metal recovery and 

applying metal prices.  Golder assigned two NSR cut-off values to reflect the 

"reasonable prospects" for economic extraction and the assumption that a good 

portion of the Back Forty deposit can be extracted through open pit methods.  To 

accomplish this, Golder carried out a Whittle pit optimization exercise.

Processing 

Metallurgical test programs were performed independently on the oxide and sulfide 

mineralization.  Average mill head grades were based on a preliminary mine 

production schedule to predict the average recovery of gold, silver, copper and zinc.  

The assumed sulfide recoveries were estimated independently by metallurgical type, 

but based on an assumed blend material through the flotation plant.  The two distinct 

types of mineralization will be processed in two separate plants.  The oxide material 

containing gold and silver, will be processed using an agitated cyanide leach, CCD 

and Merrill Crowe process producing a final gold-silver alloy dore product in the oxide 

plant.  The sulfide plant will produce copper and zinc concentrates via selective 

flotation of the individual minerals from the material.  The copper concentrate will 

contain gold and silver credits while zinc concentrate will include lead.  However, no 

lead credits are expected. 

 

Infrastructure 

The Back Forty property has paved road access and includes a power line and a site 

office.  The proposed project infrastructure for this preliminary economic assessment 

consists of on-site and off-site activities to support a mining operation.  The offices and 

mine facilities required for the project are the mine/processing complex which includes 

mineralized storage areas, crushers, conveyors, milling equipment, tailings thickener, 

oxide plant, sulfide plant, and a reagent building.  Other structures will include a 

laboratory, mine offices, warehouse, employee locker rooms, first aid station, fueling 

stations, truck wash, and various tanks to contain fuels and chemicals.  A 115 acre 

engineered facility will be constructed on the property that proposes a co-disposal of 

both tailings and waste rock.  Upon completion of the mining activities, final 

reclamation of this facility will commence.  A new 4.5km power transmission line will be 

built from an existing 138kV transmission line northeast of the property.  A new power 

substation planned at the southeast corner of the project will provide power for the 

plant facility and mine site with 13.8kV distribution voltage.  Improvements of existing 

near and on-site roads and construction of new haulage roads will be required.  A rail 

line is situated approximately 13km east of the project site and tie-in switches will be 

installed for the concentrate load-out siding.  It is assumed that fresh water will be 

supplied from wells to be drilled on the property.  The site is located on the western 

shore of the Menominee River approximately 64km northwest of the Port of 

Menominee and 89km southwest of the Port of Escanaba.  The rail line corridor 

passes through both ports and it may be feasible to utilize these services and forgo 

capital of a rail siding load-out facility. 

 

Environmental and Permitting 

Environmental baseline investigations were initiated in 2007 to meet regulatory 

requirements for advancement of the project and protect the surrounding environment.  

As with any proposed project, a number of permits are required or may be required 

prior to construction of the project.  A Mining Permit Application must describe the 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 16  
 

proposed project and how Part 632 requirements will be met.  The application will 

include information as listed in the rules under R425.201.  Permit preparation and 

environmental baseline studies have been completed or are currently ongoing to allow 

permit applications to be submitted in 2012.   

 

Mine Plan 

The mine plan assesses the potential economic viability of mining only the nearer 

surface mineralization by open pit methods.  Potential underground mining of deeper 

mineralization is not evaluated in this report.  The portion of the measured, indicated 

and inferred mineral resources used for evaluation purposes in the PEA above the 

NSR cut-off values, including allowances for dilution and mining loss and based on a 

pit optimization study assumes a seven year full production mine life.  The pit design 

includes the river constraint to the west and wetland constraint to the southwest.  The 

overall pit depth of 170m from surface incorporates a 17m wide haulage ramp at a 

10% gradient and 6m high mining benches.  The mine design includes an 8m catch-

berm at the contact between overburden and rock.  An annual production schedule 

was generated with the objective of meeting a target total processing rate of 

approximately 3,000tpd.  Preproduction stripping of one year in advance was planned 

to prepare the pit for sustained plant feed.  The maximum mining rate is about 

14,000tpd over a five year period that includes mineralization and waste material.  

Mine operation is based on mining by the owner's workforce and contractor mining 

was not assessed in this study. 

 

Economics 

Based on the assumptions used in this preliminary economic assessment the Back 

Forty project has a pre-tax cash flow of $211.8M with a NPV8% of $73.6M and a 18.2% 

IRR with a start date of January 1, 2012 of the project.  The LOM capital costs are 

estimated to be $272.3M, which includes $224.7M for project capital.  Project payback 

occurs in the third year of production. 

 

While there can be risks associated with mining projects, many of those risks can be 

mitigated with appropriate information gathering and engineering review.  The author 

summarizes main risks associated with the Back Forty project as follows: 

• Ability to achieve operating and capital cost estimates 

• Ability to secure environmental permits  

• Forecasted metal commodity prices 

 

The author summarizes the following opportunities for improvement with the Back Forty 

project: 

• Extension to life of mine through the discovery of additional resources 

• Further geotechnical investigations may lead to reduction of stripping quantities 

• Expansion of the open pit into the southwest wetland constraint provides additional 

run of mine plant feed

• Trade off study of owner operated fleet versus contract mining 

 

Industry standard mining, metallurgical investigation, and economic evaluation practices 

have been used to assess the Back Forty deposit. There is adequate geological and other 

pertinent data available to generate a preliminary economic assessment. 

 

Subsequent higher level engineering studies will need to further evaluate these risks and 

opportunities. 

 

This study is preliminary in nature and uses inferred resources to evaluate the project.  

Subsequent studies may or may not verify the findings of this preliminary economic 

assessment.  There is still significant amount of information that is required to complete the 

assessment, at this point the project does not appear to have any fatal flaws.  The study met 

its original objective of providing a positive preliminary review of the potential economic 

viability of the Back Forty project. 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

It is recommended by the author that the Back Forty project complete a mineral resource 

update and conduct additional metallurgical testwork.  The mineral resource update will 

include drilling information since November 2010 and should include interpretation of each 

mineralized domain.  Additional metallurgical testwork should be conducted using samples 

from each mineralized domain that more closely resembles the expected production grade 

from each mineralized domain.  If the recommended mineral resource update and 

metallurgical testwork is successful, a pre-feasibility level of study should be initiated. 

 

The cost estimate for the mineral resource update is expected to be in the range of $50,000 

to $100,000 and the additional metallurgical testwork is expected to be in the range of 

$200,000 to $400,000.   

 

1.2 Technical Summary 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 

The Back Forty project consists of a series of land packages in Lake Township, Menominee 

County, Michigan.  The Back Forty Joint Venture (BFJV) controls approximately 6,700 acres 

of private and state mineral lands located in Lake Township through leases, outright 

purchases, options to purchase, and State of Michigan metallic mineral leases.  

 

The property can be accessed from Green Bay, Wisconsin via the US 41 highway north 

approximately 125km to Stephenson, Michigan.  From Stephenson west along County G12 

Road for approximately 16km west turning north on River Road for approximately 5km to the 

field office and project site.

LAND TENURE 

 

The Back Forty property is wholly owned by the BFJV.  Four key parcels enclose the known 

zinc-copper-gold-silver mineralization and its extensions.  Options to purchase three other 

adjoining parcels considered important for development were exercised in 2009 and 2010.  

The BFJV has full rights to pursue its exploration plans on these parcels; there are no legal 

impediments to the BFJV pursuing its mineral exploration plans on these parcels.   

 

EXPLORATION 

 

Geophysical surveys, and to a lesser extent, geologic mapping, have been the primary 

means of exploration on the Back Forty project.  Sparse outcrop mapping in the immediate 

deposit area has yielded structural and geochemical data supporting the general deposit 

model, although outcrop distribution does not allow for any delineation of mineralization.  All 

rhyolite outcrops mapped in the area are highly pyrite-sericite-quartz altered.  Ninety percent 

of the whole-rock analyses of the Back Forty samples (mostly drill core) are considered 

intensely altered.  Altered and mineralized outcrops extend north and west of the Back Forty 

deposit for up to 500m.  Current sampling, whether from drilling or outcrop, has not identified 

the limit of strong pyrite-sericite-quartz alteration associated with the VMS mineralization.  

Indications are that mineralization may continue beyond the currently modelled resource. 

 

Down hole geophysical surveys were conducted to aid future exploration drilling programs.  

Exploration drilling and follow-up delineation drilling along with core sampling on the property 

conducted over several campaigns since 2002, has provided the necessary information for 

mineral resource estimation.

*Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All 
figures have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. The cut-off grades are 
based on metal price assumptions of US$0.95 per pound zinc, US$2.50 per pound copper, US$0.59 
per pound lead, US$900 per troy ounce gold and US$15.00 per troy ounce silver. Metallurgical 
recoveries were determined and used for each of eight metallurgical domains determined for the 
deposit.  
† Cut off grades for each of six metallurgical domains based on NSR values, average cut-off grade 
for open pit resource contained within an optimized pit shell US$20.  
‡ Cut off grades were determined for each of five metallurgical domains based on NSR values, 

average cut-off grade for underground resources outside of an optimized pit shell is US$62.  

 

The mineral resource estimate for the Back Forty deposit was a collaborative effort between 

Hudbay, Aquila and Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) personnel.  The geological model of 

mineralization was initially constructed by Aquila personnel.  In order to assess the bulk 

mining potential suggested by recent drilling, which identified significant gold and lower 

grade base metal mineralization outside the original model, Golder reconstructed new 

mineral wireframes.  With both gold and zinc contributing significantly to the economics of 

the deposit, a cut-off of 1g/t gold or 0.5% zinc was used to delineate the mineralization.  The 

quantity of silver was also used as a guide to ensure that significant value was not missed.  

In general, the modelling attempted to contain as much material with significant amounts of 

these three elements, while maintaining as little 'barren' material as possible.  The resulting 

mineral envelopes generally followed previously modelled zonal interpretations, but with 

fewer domains, and containing some additional lower grade material.  Eleven separate

domains were modelled, including the cross-cutting dyke material, and given unique numeric 

zone codes. 

 

Resource classification strategy included estimation parameters used in the estimate based 

on the gold variograms, and also took into account the assumption that the majority of the 

deposit would be extracted by open pit methods with little possibility for selectivity relative to 

the model's block size.  Blocks graded within the ranges corresponding to the gold variogram 

sill with the minimum eight samples (maximum 24) were classified as measured.  Those 

graded with ranges at twice the distance of the measured were classified as indicated, and 

blocks neither measured or indicated were classified as inferred.  Some continuity was given 

to classification by generating two volumes encompassing the majority of blocks meeting 

either the measured or indicated criteria.  All blocks captured within each of these envelopes 

were then assigned the appropriate classification. 

 

The block model resource estimate and resource classification reported herein are a 

reasonable representation of the global gold, zinc, silver, and copper mineral resources 

found in the Back Forty deposit.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 

demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral 

resource will be converted into mineral reserve.  

 

In parallel with ongoing exploration efforts Hudbay has been conducting and completing the 

necessary environmental studies and compilation for preparation of application to the State 

of Michigan for consideration of mining the Back Forty Project.  These efforts are ongoing as 

the need to consider the economic nature of the deposit is constant.   

 

MINING METHODS 

 

The mine plan assesses the potential economic viability of mining only the nearer surface 

mineralization by open pit methods.  Potential underground mining of deeper mineralization 

is not evaluated in this report.  The portion of the measured, indicated and inferred mineral 

resources used for evaluation purposes in the PEA above the NSR cut-off values, including 

allowances for dilution and mining loss and based on a pit optimization study assumes a 

seven year full production mine life. 

 

The deposit is overlain by glacial till and alluvial overburden and partially weathered bedrock 

underneath the bedrock.  A geotechnical assessment provided inter-ramp slope angle 

parameters and recommended a water diversion catch-berm between the overburden and 

bedrock.  A geotechnical cut-off wall located in overburden between the Menominee River 

and open pit is planned to reduce potential water seepage into the pit.  

 

The ultimate pit design was guided by a Whittle pit shell that includes the river constraint to 

the west and wetland constraint to the southwest.  The overall pit depth of 170m from 

surface incorporates a 17m wide haulage ramp at a 10% gradient and 6m high mining

benches.  An annual production schedule was generated with the objective of meeting a 

target total processing rate of approximately 3,000tpd.  Preproduction stripping one year in 

advance was planned to prepare the pit for sustained plant feed.  The average stripping ratio 

of waste to mineralization is 3.52 and the maximum mining rate that includes waster material 

is about 14,000tpd over a five year period.  Mine operation is based on mining by the 

owner's workforce and contractor mining was not assessed in this study. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 

Metallurgical test programs were performed independently on the oxide and sulfide 

mineralization.  Average mill head grades were based on a preliminary mine production 

schedule to predict the average recovery of gold, silver, copper and zinc are shown in Table 

1.4.  The assumed sulfide recoveries were estimated independently by metallurgical type, 

but based on an assumed blend material through the sulfide flotation plant.  

 

Table 1.4 Process Recovery and Product Specifications 

 
 

The two distinct types of mineralization will be processed in two separate plants.  The oxide 

material containing gold and silver, will be processed using an agitated cyanide leach, 

counter-current decantation and Merrill Crowe process producing a final gold-silver alloy 

dore product in the oxide plant.  The sulfide plant will produce copper and zinc concentrates 

via selective flotation of the individual minerals from the material.  The copper concentrate 

will contain gold and silver credits while zinc concentrate will include lead.  However, no lead 

credits are expected. 

 

PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

 

The Back Forty property has paved road access and includes a power line and a site office.  

The proposed project infrastructure for this preliminary economic assessment consists of on-

site and off-site activities to support a mining operation. 

 

The offices and mine facilities required for the project are the mine/processing complex 

which includes mineralized storage areas, crushers, conveyors, milling equipment, tailings

thickener, oxide plant, sulfide plant, and a reagent building.  Other structures will include a 

laboratory, mine offices, warehouse, employee locker rooms, first aid station, fueling 

stations, truck wash, and various tanks to contain fuels and chemicals. 

 

A 115 acre engineered facility will be constructed on the property that proposes a co-

disposal of both tailings and waste rock.  Upon completion of the mining activities final 

reclamation of this facility will commence. 

 

A new 4.5km power transmission line will be built from an existing 138kV transmission line 

northeast of the property.  A new power substation planned at the southeast corner of the 

project will provide power for the plant facility and mine site with 13.8kV distribution voltage. 

 

Improvements of existing near and on-site roads and construction of new haulage roads will 

be required.  A rail line is situated approximately 13km east of the project site and tie-in 

switches will be installed for the concentrate load-out siding.  It is assumed that fresh water 

will be supplied from wells to be drilled on the property.  The site is located on the western 

shore of the Menominee River approximately 64km northwest of the Port of Menominee and 

89km southwest of the Port of Escanaba.  The rail line corridor passes through both ports 

and it may be feasible to utilize these services and forgo capital of a rail siding load-out 

facility. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT  

 

Environmental baseline investigations were initiated in 2007 to meet regulatory requirements 

for advancement of the project and protect the surrounding environment.  As with any 

proposed project, a number of permits are required or may be required prior to construction 

of the project and to date the following the baseline and engineering studies have been 

completed or are currently underway: 

• Geologic and related geotechnical studies 

• Groundwater and surface water hydrology 

• Geochemical characterization of waste rock and tailings 

• Wetlands 

• Aquatic biology, vegetation, and wildlife 

• Air quality and meteorology 

• Cultural and historical resource studies 

 

Key environmental protection issues that have been recognized and incorporated into the 

engineering design of the proposed project to mitigate, to the extent possible, potential 

impacts are as follows: 

1. Mine pit proximity to the Menominee River 

2. Management of waste rock and tailings and site reclamation 

3. Water discharge 

4. Archeological artifacts 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 23  
 

5. Wetlands protection 

6. Listed and protected species and sensitive habitat in the area 

7. Particulate emissions 

 

The Back Forty mineralization is reactive and may potentially generate acid rock drainage 

and the waste from processing must be stored in a properly designed facility.  The State of 

Michigan has specific requirements of acceptable methods of mine waste storage and 

management and the project has designed a waste rock and tailings management facility 

that meets these requirements. 

 

Site monitoring of groundwater and surface water runoff is required throughout operations 

and after mine closure.  After mine closure, some or all of the monitoring network will remain 

in place and monitored for 20 years.  

 

A Mining Permit Application must describe the proposed project and how Part 632 

requirements will be met.  The application will include information as listed in the rules under 

R425.201.  Permit preparation and environmental baseline studies have been completed or 

are currently ongoing to allow permit applications to be submitted in 2012.   

 

The Back Forty project has from the onset placed high priority on community considerations 

and impacts.  The project team continues to engage the community and meet internally on a 

weekly basis to discuss ways to build upon this foundation.  Michigan's industrial base has 

been in a downward trend for several decades, influenced heavily by the automobile industry 

in downstate Michigan.  The Menominee area economy capitalizes on its location on Lake 

Michigan and the Menominee River bordering Wisconsin.  Industries include shipbuilding, 

auto and airplane parts, chemicals, helicopter design and construction, wicker furniture, 

health care and paper making.  Fishing, boating, water and winter sports, hunting, and 

observing wildlife are popular leisure activities and contribute to the local economy through 

tourism. 

 

As part of the overall stakeholder engagement program for the project, the Back Forty team 

has made a concerted effort to proactively engage Native American tribes that may have an 

interest in the mine.  Native American tribes are located throughout Michigan and the upper 

Midwest of the US, and these tribes often show an interest in mining projects for a variety of 

reasons, including economic development opportunities, environmental concerns, and 

cultural interests due to historic ties with the area. 

 

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

 

The LOM capital costs are estimated to be $272.3M, which includes $224.7M for project 

capital as summarized in Table 21.1.  Project capital costs are estimated to be $195.6M plus 

a $29.0M contingency.  Included in the project capital cost are $13.1M for mine equipment, 

$11.9M for pit preparation, haul road and preproduction, $170.6M for site and project

infrastructure that includes a copper and zinc concentrator and a separate oxide plant 

producing a gold-silver dore.  

 

Sustaining capital adds an additional $43.8M to the LOM plus a $3.8M contingency.  The 

majority of the sustaining capital is $22.6M for mine site closure, $15.1M for the ongoing 

construction and development of the waste rock and tailings management as the mine 

progresses.  The remainder of the sustaining capital is $0.9M for additional mobile 

equipment, $3.8M for mine development, $1.3M for mine general and administration and 

$0.5M for additional site infrastructure.  

 
Table 1.5 LOM Capital Costs (US Dollars) 

 
 

Operating costs using first principles, assumptions and productivities formed the basis of the 

cost estimate.  Based upon this work, the total operating costs are estimated to be 

$36.79/tonne mined and processed or $277.3M for the life of mine, shown in Table 1.6.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 

This Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) "Technical Report" on the Back Forty 

polymetallic volcanic hosted massive sulphide was completed for Aquila Resources Inc. 

(Aquila).  The purpose of the Technical Report is to describe the results of a PEA completed 

on the Back Forty Project, located in western Lake Township, Menominee County, Michigan 

U.S.A.  Hudbay and Aquila have entered into a Joint Venture agreement on the Back Forty 

Project, with Hudbay as the operator and currently owning 51% of the project. This Technical 

Report conforms to the CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves definitions referred to in 

National Instrument (NI) 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

 

The Back Forty Project is at an early stage of evaluation and this PEA mine plan and 

economic model includes the use of measured, indicated and inferred resources. The PEA is 

preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would 

enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. Mineral resources that are not mineral 

reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

 

Aquila Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration and development company headquartered out 

of Toronto, Ontario with field offices located in Stevenson, Michigan, mineral exploration 

projects in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 

 

Hudbay is an integrated Canadian mining company that produces zinc, copper, gold, silver 

and zinc oxides from mines and plants in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and has assets in 

North and South America principally focused on the discovery, production and marketing of 

base and precious metals.  

 

On September 10, 2010, Hudbay exercised its option to earn a 51% joint venture interest in 

Aquila's Back Forty Project. Pursuant to the agreement, Hudbay was obligated to expend 

US$10M on the project in order to earn its 51% interest. Hudbay has the option to increase 

its ownership interest in the project to 65% by completing a feasibility study and submitting a 

mine permit application to the State of Michigan. 

 

A summary of the Qualified Persons (QPs) responsible for each section of this report is 

detailed in Table 2.1 and certificates of QPs are included in this technical report.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

The Back Forty Joint Venture (BFJV) controls approximately 6,700 acres of private and state 

mineral lands located in Lake and Holmes Townships through leases, outright purchases, 

options to purchase, and State of Michigan metallic mineral leases.  This acreage does not 

include land tenure outside the immediate surrounding area of the Back Forty Project Area.  

The Back Forty Project Area (property) land block is situated in Township 35N, Range 29W, 

portions of Sections 1, 11, and 12, in T35N, R28W, portions of Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, all 

in Lake Township, as well as in T36N, R28W portions of Section 32 and 33 in Holmes 

Township, Menominee County, Michigan. The project is centered at latitude 45° 27' N and 

longitude 87° 51' W (Figure 4.1). 

 

4.1 Property Interests, Title, Taxes and Other Legal Obligations 

The Back Forty property is fully controlled by the BFJV. Four key parcels enclose the known 

zinc-copper-gold-silver mineralization and its extensions.  Options to purchase three other 

adjoining parcels considered important for development were exercised in 2009-2010 

(Parcels 3, 4, 5).  The status of properties is summarized below and shown in Figure 4.1.  In 

addition, peripheral properties were also purchased or optioned and are described below. 

 

Hudbay conducted due diligence and concluded that the purchase, purchase option and 

lease agreements controlling the key parcels are in good standing and all rental and property 

tax obligations are current.  No state or local taxes are levied against the mineral estate 

interests

4.2 Description of Properties 

4.2.1 Key Parcels 
 

The information presented below for the key parcels is extracted from a title opinion prepared 

for Aquila in May 27, 2009 by the law office of Steven J. Tinti.  Based on records filed with 

the Menominee County Register of Deeds Office and the agreements examined, Mr. Tinti 

concluded that under Michigan law:  The BFJV has full rights to pursue its exploration plans 

on these parcels; there are no legal impediments to the BFJV pursuing its mineral 

exploration plans on these parcels.  Figure 4.2 shows the parcels in the immediate deposit 

area. 

 

• State Lease M-00775 (40 acres).  One hundred percent of the surface is owned by 

the BFJV through purchase.  The severed mineral estate is held under a state lease. 

This lease calls for rental payments that include US$6/acre ($240) for year 2010 to 

2011 and is subject to a sliding scale production royalty (see section 3.3). The rental 

payments increase to US$10/acre beginning in 2012. 

 

• Government Lot 1 (approximately 47 acres of private surface and mineral estate in 

fee simple) in T35N, R29W, Section 1.  A purchase agreement for this property was 

executed in mid-2006.  It calls for an initial payment of US$1.3 million followed by 

yearly instalments over a period of nine years.  There is no retained production 

royalty for the property. 

 

• Aquila Parcel 1 (approximately 39 acres).  The surface is owned 100% by the BFJV.  

This includes a BFJV ownership of a 20% mineral interest.  Another 70% mineral 

interest is leased to the BFJV by agreements with the heirs of a mineral estate.  This 

gives the BFJV a total of 90% mineral interest in this property to date. The estimated 

county property tax obligations for assessment year 2010 (same for each succeeding 

year until 2011) are approximately US$3,057. 

 

• State lease M-00776 (240 acres of state surface and mineral estates in fee simple 

and 40 acres of state mineral estate).  The lease agreement calls for annual rentals 

and a sliding scale production royalty up to seven percent on any future production 

(see section 3.3).  Rental payments for year 2010 and 2011 are US$6/acre 

(US$1,440). The rental payments increase to US$10/acre beginning in 2012. 

 

• Aquila Parcel 2: (Approximately 17 acres). The surface is owned 100% by the BFJV.  

This includes BFJV ownership of a 20% mineral interest. Another 70% mineral 

interest is leased by the BFJV by lease agreements with the heirs of a mineral 

estate.  This gives the BFJV a total of 90% mineral interest in this property.  The 

property abuts Parcel 1 and may be important in future deep exploration west of the

known deposit.The estimated county property tax obligations for assessment year 

2010 (same for each succeeding year until 2011) are approximately US$2,059. 

 

• Contiguous Parcels 3, 4, and 5 were acquired in 2009 and 2010 when Aquila 

exercised an Option to Purchase for each.  No known economic mineralization had 

been identified on these parcels, but they are considered key development lands.  

Parcel 3 consists of private fee simple surface and minerals now wholly owned by 

the BFJV.  The mineral estate for this parcel was previously listed under State of 

Michigan ownership.  A 2010 title search led to the discovery that the mineral estate 

was held by the surface owner.  The State has acknowledged this correction and the 

purchase agreement with the surface owner was amended to reflect the surface 

owner's mineral interest and retained royalty.  Parcel 4 is a 100% private surface fee 

simple and mineral interest purchase.  The mineral interest for Parcel 5 (100% 

surface purchase by the BFJV) are partially private (80 acres) and partially state 

owned held under lease number M-00773 (120 acres).  This lease calls for rental 

payments that include US$6/acre ($720) for year 2010 to 2011 and is subject to a 

sliding scale production royalty (see section 3.3).  The rental payments increase to 

US$10/acre beginning in 2012.  The estimated county property tax obligations for 

assessment year 2010 (same for each succeeding year until 2011) are 

approximately US$8,157. 

 

4.2.2 Peripheral Properties 
 

The BFJV purchased or optioned properties peripheral to project lands.  These include: 

 

• S1/2-SE1/4-NW1/4 and part of Govt. Lots 2 and 3, T35N, R28W, Section 6 (Parcel 6, 

Figure 4.2: 42 acres), purchased in 2009. 

 

• Parts of Govt. Lots 1 and 2, T35N, R28W, Section 6 (Parcel 7, Figure 4.2: 2 acres), 

purchased in 2010. 

 

• Parts of Govt. Lots 2 and 3, T35N, R28W, Section 6 (Parcel 8, Figure 4.2: 4 acres), 

purchased in 2011. 

 

• Option to Purchase: Part of NW¼-NE¼, T35N, R28W, Section 4 (Figure 4.1: 16 

acres). This option carries an annual payment of US$7,000 for three years beginning 

in 2010. 

 

• Option to Purchase: SE¼SW¼, T36N R28W, Section 33 (Figure 4.1: 40 acres).  This 

3-year option carries an escalating annual payment that is $20,000 in 2011. 

 

The BFJV's current property inventory includes 2,670 acres of full or partial private severed 

mineral interests outside the immediate Back Forty Project area. The title origins of these

leased mineral interests are primarily by quit-claim, and the BFJV is currently undergoing a 

review of their title quality to determine whether or not to continue holding them under lease.

4.3 State of Michigan Metallic Minerals Leases 

Michigan state leases (M00775, M00776, M00772 and M00773) in the resource area were 

previously nominated by and awarded to Minerals Processing Corporation (MPC) as early as 

2002 on a non-competitive basis. These and other state leases in the Back Forty project 

area originally held by MPC have been subsequently assigned to Aquila and now the BFJV. 

The current leases call for a 10-year term that can be extended to 20 years by paying 

advance royalty.  

 

Other terms include a one-time US$1/acre minimum bonus bid, a rental rate commencing at 

US$3/acre per year for the first five years and US$6/acre per year for years six through ten. 

 

In the absence of mining operations, a minimum advance royalty payment (deductible from 

production royalty) is due for years eleven through twenty. The advance royalty payment rate 

begins at US$10/acre in the eleventh year and escalates by US$5/acre per year until the 

twentieth year when the rate is US$55/acre. If production occurs, a royalty must be paid to 

the State. A sliding scale production royalty with no deductions of incurred costs is utilized 

based on an "adjusted (indexed for inflation) sales value" per short ton of dry ore (per long 

ton for iron ore). For base and precious metals, it is calculated on a quarterly basis whereby 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 37  
 

the gross sales value (revenue received by the mine from a smelter or processor, i.e. 

"smelter return) is divided by ore production which is then adjusted for inflation (using the 

producer price index for all commodities). The resulting adjusted sales value per short ton of 

ore (other than iron ore) is subject to the following rates: 2% on value less than US$12/ton; 

this rate is increased by 1% for each US$6 increase in the value above US$12 to a 

maximum of US$71.99/ton; at or above US$72/ton a 7% rate applies. The State of Michigan 

allows for renegotiation of production royalties (rates and method of calculation) at any time 

during the term of the lease. 

 

At the time of this report, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment 

(DNRE) had completed reforming the current mining lease agreement that clarifies and 

expands the royalty schedule. The new lease format calls for basically similar terms including 

rental rates and advance minimum royalty payments but includes a much improved 

production royalty schedule. The new production royalty is also based on "smelter return" 

that includes processor deductions for 1) base smelting and refining charges, 2) sampling 

and/or assay charges assessed by the smelter, 3) penalties for impurities that are deducted 

from the assay value of the ore (adjusted sales value). No deductions for operation of the 

mine, on-site enrichment of ore, or transportation to the smelter, will be allowed in calculating 

smelter returns. None of these costs can be recouped by deductions against the adjusted 

sales value. The production royalty is calculated the same way as in the old lease for base 

and precious metals but uses a different royalty schedule as is shown in Table 4.1.

          Above   $500.01  10% 10.50% 

 

The new royalty rates are much improved and more in line with industry standards. As with 

the old lease, royalty rates in the new lease agreement may be renegotiated any time during 

the lease term. Although the BFJV has no new state leases, it does have the option to 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 38  
 

renegotiate the production royalty in the older leases to the more favourable rates. A 

renegotiated production royalty is particularly important for leases M00775 and M00776 that 

control portions of the identified resource. The BFJV is involved in continuing discussions 

and negotiations with state agencies regarding royalty agreements.  However, there is no 

guarantee that any negotiations with the State regarding modification of State lease 

production royalty rates will be successful. 

 

4.4 Permitting 

4.4.1 State Exploration Permits 
 

No formal licenses or registrations are required for companies conducting metallic 

exploration drilling in the State of Michigan. However, an Exploration Plan must be submitted 

to the MDNRE describing any exploration activities proposed to take place on State-owned 

mineral estates. In addition, for exploration work on State-owned surface lands, a Use Permit 

is required. At the time of this report, Aquila has submitted a permit application for permits 

FMD-033-2010-003 and 2010-2, which will be valid until November, 2012. 

 

Diamond core drilling is regulated by the MDNRE. A written and/or verbal notice to the 

MDNRE is required before any drilling operation can be undertaken. Proposed drill sites on 

State-owned land must be inspected and approved by the MDNRE. All drill holes must 

eventually be cemented from top to bottom, although holes may be left open for a length of 

time at the discretion of the company.  Companies must also submit a drill hole plugging 

report for each hole upon abandonment and a report including a lithologic log and collar 

location.  Drill sites in wetlands also require a permit. Lead times for approval vary depending 

on environmental sensitivity of the site (winter drilling is usually required at these sites). For 

exploration drill holes that are expected to encounter Paleozoic rocks overlying Precambrian 

bedrock, whether on private or state land, a Michigan Part 625 permit must be applied for 

and accompanied by a bond payment.  The amount of the bond varies depending on number 

and depth of holes.  The bond is returned after hole abandonment is verified.  No drilling 

permit is required for holes targeted in Precambrian bedrock where no Paleozoic rocks are 

expected to be encountered.   

 

4.4.2 Mine permits 
 

Michigan has developed requirements for new non-ferrous mines (Part 632 of NREPA). The 

new regulations are a consolidation of previous requirements into one mine permit 

application (MPA). The application will be accompanied by an environmental assessment 

(EA) which would be supported by a mine and reclamation plan, a baseline environmental 

assessment, impact and risk analysis, monitoring and quality assurance plan, bonding, 

water, air and a national Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits.  The BFJV is 

planning on submitting the MPA in the second quarter 2012.

4.5 Zoning Issues 

Lake Township, in which the Back Forty deposit is located, has enacted a "Zoning 

Ordinance".  This ordinance allows mining in all four of the township's zoning districts 

(Agriculture and Forests, Forest Management, Town Development and Lakeshore - River 

districts) via a conditional use permit. The Township has also enacted a separate "Mineral 

Extraction Ordinance" that specifies local requirements and conditions under which mining 

operations must operate in the township.  As written, portions of the ordinance duplicate and 

in some instances conflict with existing state regulations that govern nonferrous mineral 

mining in Michigan (Part 632 of Public Act 451 - Natural Resource and Environmental 

Protection Act, as amended).  Part 632 clearly establishes the State of Michigan's role in 

permitting and regulation of nonferrous mining, and specifically limits the authority of local 

government. It appears likely that most of the Lake Township Mineral Extraction Ordinance is 

unenforceable. However, the Township can regulate such local issues as noise levels and 

traffic.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 Physiography 

The area lies along the east bank of the Menominee River and consists of low, rolling hills 

with maximum topographic relief of thirty meters and intervening swamps (in part prairie-

savannah); mean elevation is approximately 200 to 300 meters above sea level.  Vegetation 

is mostly immature hardwood-pine forest (Figure 5.1) and swamp/prairie-savannah grasses; 

swampy areas also occur along creeks and secondary tributaries.  The climate is temperate, 

allowing exploration, potential development, and potential mining activities to take place year 

round. 

 

Figure 5.1 Typical Landscape of the Back Forty Project 
 

 

 

5.2 Climate 

Regional climate information was obtained from the Midwest Regional Climate Center station 

in Stephenson, Michigan from 1948 to 2001.  Regionally, July is the warmest month with a 

mean temperature of 17.1ºC and January is the coldest month with a mean temperature of 

minus 10.7ºC. 

 

The region receives approximately 79cm of precipitation annually, on average.  Record high 

and low precipitation measurements were 109cm in 1959 and 20.50 inches in 1998.  August 

is the wettest month, with an average 9.5cm of precipitation, and February is the driest 

month with 2.4cm of precipitation.  The area receives an average of 162cm of snowfall per

Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 41  
 

year, with the most accumulation occurring in January.  The most snowfall over a one year 

period was approximately 107 inches in 1970-1971.  There was no recorded snowfall during 

the months of June, July, or August over the period from 1948 to 2001. 

 

From July 14, 2007 to July 13, 2009 ambient temperature averaged 5.8°C, with a low of 

minus 33.3°C on January 26, 2009 and a high of 35.2°C on July 31, 2007.  Total 

precipitation during this time was 106cm.  Winds occurred 37.6 percent of the time, 

predominantly from the south southwest, southwest, northwest, and north northwest sectors.  

The average wind speed for all directional sectors was 8.4km per hour. 

 
The local climate will not impede an open pit mining operation at the Back Forty and the 
expectation is to operate on a year round basis. 
 

5.3 Access 

The Back Forty property is located approximately 55km south-southeast from Iron Mountain, 

and approximately 19km west of Stephenson Michigan, within the Escanaba River State 

Forest, shown in Figure 5.2.  Access from Stephenson is via County G12 Road. North on 

River Road and travel approximately 5km to the project field office.  A number of drill roads 

connect with River Road and cross the property. Infrastructure on the property includes a 

power line and paved road access.

5.4 Site Sufficiency 

In the immediate area of the Back Forty deposit, the BFJV contains approximately 580 acres 

of contiguous key parcels that are potentially available for surface development.  This is 

adequate to address the potential space requirements of mining operations, processing 

plant, overburden, rock and tailings storage.  The project is also located within ready access 

to water and power needs, including a 138kV transmission line that crosses the northeast 

corner of the project area site.

6.0 HISTORY  
 
No previous exploration or production occurred on the property prior to 2001, when 

construction of a new domestic water well on the MRT property intersected massive 

sphalerite mineralization. Richard Lassin, a Michigan-based geologist, first recognized the 

potential of the property.  A business associate, Harry Kleiman who owns a water well drilling 

company, was hired to deepen the MRT property well and brought Lassin massive sulphide 

cuttings derived from the completed well.  Subsequent assays of the cuttings confirmed the 

well had indeed penetrated twelve meters (forty feet) of zinc-rich massive sulfide.  Surface 

investigations of the property revealed the presence of favourable pyritic quartz-sericite 

schist outcrops and an auriferous gossan that were thought to be capping massive sulphide 

mineralization at depth. Lassin and Kleiman shortly thereafter formed VMS Development 

Company LLC (VMSD) and began acquiring private and state mineral interests in the 

surrounding area. 

 

Attempts to acquire the MRT property were unsuccessful and VMSD began to contact 

companies as potential partners to continue land acquisition and exploration of the area. 

Minerals Processing Corporation (MPC) was contacted in the spring of 2002. In the fall of 

2002, the Menominee River Exploration Company, LLC (MREC) joint venture between 

VMSD and MPC was formed after preliminary gravity and electromagnetic surveys on land 

adjacent to the MRT property had identified strong gravity and conductivity anomalies 

associated with the locations of the water well and gossan. Exploration and land acquisition 

continued thereafter; a strong gravity anomaly (LK anomaly) was identified immediately to 

the east of the MRT property. 

 

In February of 2002, two diamond drill holes were completed along the eastern edge of the 

MRT property on state mineral estate leased to MREC.  These holes targeted a 1.5 milligal 

gravity anomaly coincident with a strong Max-Min electromagnetic conductor.  Although the 

first hole (108401) failed to intersect any significant mineralization, the second hole (108402) 

penetrated thirty-seven meters of massive sulphides grading 9.1% zinc and 5.7g/t gold after 

penetrating the capping gossan that graded 21.9g/t gold. The East Zone had been 

discovered. 

 

Shortly thereafter, the Back Forty Joint Venture (BFJV) was formed between the MREC and 

the American Copper and Nickel Company, Inc (ACNC), INCO's American subsidiary.  

ACNC could earn sixty percent interest in the project by spending US$10 million over six 

years.  After protracted negotiations, a purchase option was finally arranged for the MRT 

property.  In October 2002, drilling commenced and continued through early May of 2003. 

With up to five drill rigs operating, a total of 20,450 meters in seventy-one holes were 

completed. This drilling partially delineated a zinc-copper-gold-silver rich VMS deposit.  

However, ACNC deemed the deposit's potential size as too small to meet their minimum 

requirements of at least twenty million tonnes.

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 44  
 

 

ACNC attempted unsuccessfully to sell its position in the BFJV.  It still had not vested its 

sixty percent interest.  By mid-2003 ACNC had negotiated with MREC an immediate 

withdrawal from the project in exchange for a retained seven percent net profits interest 

(NPI) in any future deposits developed within the project area.  With ACNC out of the joint 

venture, MREC began seeking a new partner to help advance the project.  However, in early 

2004, a new company, Aquila Resources Corporation (ARC), was formed for the purpose of 

going public with the project.  It was not until mid-2006 that ARC merged with JML 

Resources through a reverse take-over and was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. 

 

Once listed, the new company, renamed Aquila Resources Inc., raised additional exploration 

capital to restart drilling operations.  By early September 2006, the MRT property was re-

acquired and two drilling rigs were brought back to focus on drilling the shallow portions of 

the deposit. An additional 14,600 meters in eighty holes were completed by mid-November, 

2006, to fill in gaps in earlier drilling.  In early 2007, Datamine International was 

commissioned to conduct a rigorous geostatistical resource estimation that included 2006 

drilling results.  In April of 2007, Aquila announced the approval to list on the Toronto Stock 

Exchange. 

 

Exploration drilling continued into 2008, resulting in 354 drill holes to be compiled into a new 

resource estimate.  In 2008, SRK Consulting, Toronto, was contracted to provide a new 

resource calculation.  During 2008, SRK evaluated data from the Back Forty including 

drilling, survey, core logging, assay and quality control procedures, data entry and 

management procedures, review of geological interpretation, and inspection of drill core.  

The mineral resource statement was released in January, 2009. 

 

In August of 2009, Hudbay Minerals - Toronto entered into a Subscription, Option, and Joint 

Venture Agreement allowing Hudbay to earn a majority share of the Back Forty Project and 

become the operator.  Under the agreement, another phase of drilling started in the fall of 

2009 and continued until June of 2010.  The total number of drill holes increased to 478. 

Golder Associates, Mississauga, Ontario were retained to calculate an updated mineral 

resource, which was released in October, 2010. 

 

In September 2010, Hudbay announced that, pursuant to the terms of a Subscription, Option 

and Joint Venture Agreement with Aquila Resources Inc., Hudbay had exercised its option to 

earn a 51% joint venture interest in Aquila's Back Forty Project in Michigan's Upper 

Peninsula after expenditures of $10 million on the project.  Hudbay can increase its 

ownership interest in the project to 65% by completing a feasibility study and submitting a 

mine permit application to the State of Michigan.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 

 
The Back Forty volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit is one of a number of deposits 

located throughout the Ladysmith-Rhinelander volcanic complex in northern Wisconsin and 

western Michigan. The complex lies within the lower Proterozoic Penokean Volcanic Belt 

(PVB), also known as the Wisconsin Magmatic Terranes. The PVB is part of the Southern 

Structural Subprovince of the Canadian Shield (Figure 7.1). 

 

Figure 7.1 Schematic Geological Map of the Great Lakes Region Showing Principal 
Volcanic Belts (after Franklin and Thorpe, 1982) 

 

 
 

Sims and others (1989) have divided the PVB into the Pembine-Wausau and 

Marshfieldsubterranes, separated by the Eau Pleine shear zone.  Each subterrane is 

characterized by volcanic island-arc-basin assemblages containing abundant calc-alkaline 

metavolcanic units and lesser amounts of sedimentary rocks; they generally lack major 

regional oxide-facies iron formations. Sims and others (1989) have established an Early 

Proterozoic age, ranging from 1,889 to 1,835 million years (Figure 7.2).  The PVB is in 

contact with another major terrane to the north designated the "Northern Penokean Terrane"

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 46  
 

(NPT). The contact between these terranes is marked by the Niagara fault zone, which is 

believed to be a paleosuture (Sims et al, 1989). 

 
Figure 7.2 Geologic map of northern Wisconsin and western Michigan showing major 

terranes (after Sims et al, 1989) 

 
 

The NPT is characterized in part by a thick turbidite platform sequence, which was deposited 

at a continental margin on Archean basement. Subordinate interbedded tholeiitic 

metavolcanics and major Superior-type oxide-facies iron formations occur within the 

package.  This supracrustal sequence has been interpreted to correlate with the Marquette 

Range Supergroup in Michigan. Both terranes (NPT and PVB) have been affected by the 

Penokean Orogeny, which occurred from 1,900 to 1,840 million years, and resulted in major 

folding and faulting, regional metamorphism, and emplacement of major granitic intrusions.  

On the basis of regional gravity and magnetic data, three volcanic complexes have been 

defined in the PVB: the Ladysmith-Rhinelander volcanic complex, which dominates the 

northern portion of the Pembine-Wausau subterrane; the Wausau complex, to the south, 

which has been intruded over much of its extent by the Wolf River batholith; and the Eau 

Claire complex, in the Marshfield subterrane. 

 

Geological, geophysical and geochemical data compiled since the 1960's define three 

depositional environments in the 1,880 to 1,860 million year old Ladysmith-Rhinelander 

complex, with each containing VMS mineralization: 1) a main volcanic-arc sequence, forming 

the structural core of the complex, 2) a laterally equivalent and/or possibly younger back-arc

basin, volcanic-volcaniclastic succession that includes a series of mafic volcanic piles, and 3) 

major felsic volcanic centres in the back-arc basin and along the flanks of the main volcanic 

arc.  The three mineral districts in the Ladysmith-Rhinelander complex are defined by 

clustering of VMS deposits and occurrences as shown in Figure 7.3 (DeMatties, 1994). 

 

Figure 7.3 Geologic Map of Northern Wisconsin and Western Michigan Showing 
Volcanic Complexes, Distribution of VMS Districts and Major Ore-related Meta-argillite 

Formations (after DeMatties, 1994) 

 
 

The spatial distribution of the three districts appears to be linear, trending in an east-west 

direction (the so called "Highway 8" trend) and are separated from each other by thirty to fifty 

kilometres.  However, a more complicated arrangement of individual deposits and 

occurrences is evident within each district. It is interesting to note the Back Forty deposit is 

isolated from the known districts; located at the east end of the belt and east of the 

Menominee River in Michigan. The nearest significant deposit is the Catwillow occurrence 

located at the east end of the Crandon district, approximately fifty kilometres northwest of the 

Back Forty Project.  The distance from the Crandon district is significant given the average 

distance between districts of thirty to fifty kilometres.  This distribution suggests strongly that 

the Back Forty deposit lies within a new, but as yet unrecognized, district at the extreme east

end of the belt.  As a result, the Back Forty discovery has created a larger district-scale 

potential for the BFJV. 

 

Together, the approximately fourteen known VMS deposits account for over 150 million tons 

of base and precious metal mineralization.  The average deposit size in this district is 

approximately 2.5 million short tons; this average is high compared to other VMS districts 

worldwide (DeMatties, 1994).  The Back Forty deposit exceeds in size most deposits 

discovered in the belt to date.  The identified VMS deposits are classified by metal content 

into three groups based on zinc and copper ratios (DeMatties, 1994 and 1996). These 

include Cu, Zn-Cu and Zn-Pb-Cu (Figure 7.4).  Each group exhibits various styles of 

mineralization that include sheets, mounds, stacked lenses and replacements.  Calculated 

zinc and copper ratios for the Back Forty deposit place it in the Zn-Cu group; this group is 

dominant in the belt. 

 
Figure 7.4: Classification of VMS Deposits Based on Copper and Zinc Ratios 

 

 
 

7.2 Property Geology 

Published small-scale (1:250,000) geologic maps of Northeastern Wisconsin indicate the 

area to the west of the Back Forty project area is underlain by the 1,760 to 1,870 Ma old 

Athelstane Quartz Monzonite, an intrusive complex composed of tonalite, granodiorite and 

granite.  The plutonic complex is bounded on the north, east and south by metavolcanic 

rocks of the Beecher Formation and contains numerous metavolcanic rock inclusions.  The 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 49  
 

volcanics generally face outward from the margin of the intrusive complex.  Dykes of 

Athelstane Quartz Monzonite extend a short distance into the Beecher Formation (Jenkins, 

1973).   

 

The Beecher Formation consists of a stratigraphically lower, 3,000m thick sequence of calc-

alkaline andesite to dacite flows and an upper 300m thick section of interbedded felsic ash, 

crystal tuff, lapilli tuff, coarser fragmental rocks and locally black slates near the stratigraphic 

top of the formation.  The Back Forty deposit is hosted by a volcanic complex quite similar to 

the upper volcaniclastic section of the Beecher Formation.  Zircons extracted from rhyolite 

crystal tuff and intrusive rhyodacite porphyry from Back Forty have yielded a U/Pb age of 

1,874 +/- 4 Ma (Schulz et al., 2008).  This age is consistent with the published age of the 

Athelstane Quartz Monzonite.  It is likely that the felsic sequence at Back Forty is a member 

of the Beecher Formation.  The lateral extent of this volcanic center is unknown at this time.  

However, drilling and gravity surveys indicate it is truncated to the west and north by 

Athelstane Quartz Monzonite, but likely extends further to the east and south, beneath 

Cambrian sandstone sediments. 

 

Detailed core logging and lithogeochemical studies completed to date by Aquila have 

established at least four lithologic units within the portion of the felsic centre hosting the Back 

Forty mineralization. Regional deformation has produced a penetrative foliation; locally 

shears have been observed. The foliation is developed best in rhyolite crystal tuff units that 

have the strongest sericite alteration. In the fragmental units, clasts are commonly stretched 

parallel to foliation. In the bedded tuffaceous unit, schistosity is parallel to relict bedding. 

 

Based on geologic relationships and apparent offsets, high angle, north-south striking faults 

were inferred striking through the central portion of the deposit.  A detailed review of drill core 

and geotechnical data did not confirm these as major, through-going structures.  A second 

set of west-southwest trending, high-angle faults were also previously interpreted.  These 

faults in general parallel the axial plane of the anticlinal fold.  The principal east-west fault 

has been confirmed by a review of drill core and geotechnical data, and appears to strike 

through the southern portion of the East Zone massive sulphide and continue west to form 

the northern boundary of the Hinge Zone massive sulphide, as well as the southern 

boundary of the Pinwheel Zone.  

 

7.3 Mineralized Zones 

Mineralization at the Back Forty deposit consists of discrete zones of: 1) zinc or copper-rich 

massive sulphide, which may contain significant amounts of gold, 2) stockwork stringer 

sulphide, which can be gold, zinc, and copper-bearing, 3) precious metal-only, low-sulphide 

mineralization, and 4) oxide-rich, precious metal-bearing gossan.

7.4 Massive Sulphide Mineralization 

To date, VMS-style mineralization has been identified at two stratigraphic levels within the 

felsic sequence.  The Main Zone is stratigraphically lower than the Tuff and Pinwheel zones.  

Another Deep Zone was identified as a possible third, lower mineralized horizon.  In this 

section, massive sulphide refers to rocks composed of at least eighty percent sulphide, 

rather than the more common cut-off of sixty percent for massive sulphides.  Semi-massive 

sulphide mineralization is considered to contain ten to eighty percent sulphides. 

 

7.4.1 Main Zone Massive Sulphide 
 
The Main Zone is composed of three separate massive sulphide bodies (referred to as the 

East, Hinge, and South Limb Zones) that form parts of a plunging anticlinal structure and are 

considered the same horizon.  These bodies are hosted by Rhyolite 1 (footwall) along and 

stratigraphically below their contact with Rhyolite 2 (hangingwall).  These horizons are 

stacked, strata-bound massive sulphide bodies that are enveloped locally by stockwork and 

semi-massive sulphide mineralization.  Pervasive sericite and disseminated pyrite alteration 

as well as variable silicification are abundant and extend outward for an undetermined 

distance.  The Main Zone extends along strike for over 450 meters in a west-southwest 

direction; it is up to 100 meters wide and subcrops at its eastern end under thin (less than 

ten meter) glacial overburden or local Paleozoic sandstone.  The stockwork-stringer sulphide 

envelope grades outward into a semi-conformable disseminated (less than ten percent) 

pyritic halo that extends throughout the entire altered Rhyolite 1 host unit for an 

undetermined distance.  The zone has been extensively disrupted by variably altered quartz 

feldspar porphyry (QFP) intrusions. 

 

The East Zone subcrops east of the Keeweenawan dyke under glacial overburden, which is 

less than ten meters thick; locally, erosional outliers of Paleozoic sandstone are less than 0.5 

meter thick. 

 

The Hinge zone, in part offset by faulting, has been folded tightly into a cigar-shaped body 

that plunges moderately at approximately forty degrees to the southwest along the axial 

plane of the anticlinal fold; the South Limb is separated from the Hinge by a laterally 

persistent QFP dyke and remains open to the southwest.  Further west, the horizon is 

apparently offset downwards again between Sections 35225E and 35200E. Between 

sections 35200E and 35100E, deformation of the Hinge horizon likely has resulted in tectonic 

thickening of this unit (up to approximately seventy meters in the "hinge" area).  Beyond 

Section 35100E to the west, the Hinge horizon appears to pinch out against a QFP dyke. 

 

The South Limb Zone is interpreted to represent the steeply-dipping southern fold limb of the 

anticline where it is steeply dipping to the south, while plunging to the west-southwest; this 

interpretation is supported by lithogeochemical data.  Locally, shearing is common, resulting 

in an overall uniform thickness and lens-shaped geometry.

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 51  
 

 

The Hinge and South Limbs zones are separated by large, variably-altered QFP dykes that 

flood the axial plane area of the anticlinal fold.  This syn- or post-mineralization QFP 

intrusion(s) has intruded, cut off and obliterated portions of both horizons.  To the west, the 

model suggests that the South Limb may be pinching and swelling down plunge into a series 

of thin to thick lenses that occupy the south limb of the anticline.  Drilling continues to support 

the above interpretation.  The South Limb remains open along strike. 

 

7.4.2 Deep Zone 
 
The Deep Zone is located north of one of the QFP dykes, juxtaposed to the South Limb 

Horizon.  Recent geological and geochemical data interpretation suggests that the Deep 

Zone may be the down-dip continuation of the South Limb, where it has been folded and 

rotated.  This interpretation leaves significant spatial potential for further resource discovery 

between the South Limb and the Deep Zone as well as down dip of the Deep Zone. 

 

The Deep Zone is relatively enriched in copper compared to zones of the main horizon (East, 

Hinge, and South Limb) and suggests that a more copper-rich portion of this VMS system 

occurs at depth. 

 

Recent drilling (LK-479) suggests that massive sulphide mineralization continues at depth on 

strike to the southwest at least 300 meters from the previously modelled extent of both the 

South Limb and the Deep Zone. 

 
7.4.3 Tuff and Pinwheel Zones 
 
The Tuff and Pinwheel Zones occur at the south and northwest ends of the property, 

respectively.  Stratigraphic and structural data suggest that both zones are located at higher 

levels in the volcanic sequence, but on opposite limbs of the anticlinal fold and that they are 

in fact the same unit.  In cross sections and three-dimensional models, both zones appear to 

have bowl-shaped geometries reminiscent of small relict depositional basins or local graben 

structures.  However, no structures have been identified that would support the graben 

model. 

 

The Tuff Zone is hosted in the stratigraphically upper portions of the intensely sericitized and 

locally chlorite-altered Rhyolite 2 unit as well as within the siliceous tuffaceous sediment unit. 

The Tuff Zone has been traced along strike to the southwest by drilling (parallel to the Main 

Zone) for nearly 300 meters.  It is steeply dipping to the south and occupies the southern 

limb of the anticlinal structure.  However, this zone is not as deformed as the massive Main 

sulphide horizon and is much thinner (less than ten meters).  The horizon possibly subcrops 

in the northeast along Sections 35175E and 35150E but plunges southwest (to at least 

Section 35050E) similar to massive sulphide horizons of the Main Zone.  The down plunge 

extent of the zone remains unknown and untested by drilling, but recent drilling (LK-479)

intersected Tuff Zone-style mineralization associated with tuffaceous sediments 100 meters 

on strike to the west of the previously modelled extent of the Tuff Zone. 

 

The Pinwheel Zone is a shallow, isolated erosional remnant located structurally along the 

gently north-dipping northern limb of the anticlinal fold.  It has a strike length of at least 150 

meters, is up to 100 meters wide, and up to forty meters thick.  The massive sulphide is 

typically fine-grained and contains abundant pyrite with variable amounts of chalcopyrite and 

sphalerite.  The massive mineralization reaches a thickness of up to twenty meters before 

grading into underlying stockwork mineralization, which contains abundant pyrite and 

chalcopyrite. 

 

7.5 Copper Mineralization 

Drilling has shown that the VMS mineralization of the Main and Tuff Zones is generally 

copper-poor.  The most consistent copper mineralization has been intersected in the 

Pinwheel Zone.  Whether the higher copper grades (compared to the rest of the deposit) are 

due to late genetic zone refining or due to generally higher fluid temperatures during 

deposition has yet to be determined.  Elevated copper values (above 0.5 percent) have been 

intersected in the Deep Zone at a depth of approximately 400 meters.  Mineralization 

consists of a deformed massive to semi-massive sulphide zone within the core of the 

anticline.  Drill hole LK-479, which intersected massive sulphide mineralization similar to that 

of the Deep Zone,suggests that this body plunges down to the west-southwest for at least 

300 meters. 

 

Elevated copper values are related also to a late remobilization event that resulted in the 

formation of chalcopyrite-pyrite stockwork mineralization under the Deep Zone.  This 

mineralization was intersected by borehole 108470 between 393.2 and 403.7 meters.  The 

sulphide mineralization is clearly late and overprints thin massive sulphide bodies and 

altered/mineralized quartz crystal tuff of the Rhyolite 1 unit;chalcopyrite veins, replacement 

blebs and wisps are common.  The twenty-four meter interval graded 1.42% copper and 

0.84g/t gold. 

 

Late chalcopyrite - pyrite overprinting also occurs locally as found in the extension of 

borehole 108422, where a tuffaceous sedimentary rock unit was intersected. The hole 

intersected chalcopyrite-pyrite-pyrrhotite-quartz veins and stringers from 500 to 508 meters; 

the veins and stringers disrupt and locally brecciate a section of delicately laminated exhalite 

consisting of alternating layers chert and pyrite. 

 

7.6 Stockwork Mineralization 

The stockwork-stringer envelope is better developed stratigraphically below the massive 

sulphide but does occur above and lateral to the Main massive sulphide horizon as well.  

Stockwork-stringer mineralization occurring stratigraphically below the South Limb is very

limited laterally, and much of it appears to have been displaced and altered by QFP intrusive 

as previously described.  Mineral assemblages include mainly pyrite (commonly gold-

bearing), minor sphalerite and variable amounts of chalcopyrite as veins, veinlets, 

laminations, massive replacements and disseminations hosted by the Rhyolite 1 unit. 

Deformation has similarly affected and folded the stockwork-stringer envelope. 

 

7.7 Precious Metal-Rich, Low Sulphide Mineralization 

In addition to gold values in both the massive and stockwork-stringer sulphide zones, 

significant gold and silver mineralization in surrounding host-rocks has been identified.  This 

mineralization typically contains less than 10 percent sulphide, although locally it may 

contain more. Host rocks include tuffaceous sediments and underlying rhyolite tuff (the 90 

Zone), sheared rhyolite (NS Zone), and quartz-feldspar porphyry (PM Zone).  

 

Significant gold of the "90" Zone occurs in silicified tuffaceous sediments and upper chlorite-

altered Rhyolite 2 generally focused at the same horizon and up dip from the Tuff Zone.  The 

zone consists of 5%-10% disseminated pyrite with lesser arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and 

galena.  The host rocks are variably oxidized (hematitic) and variably silicified.  Gold 

mineralization appears to be structurally controlled, crosscutting the section.  Some near-

surface gold may have been concentrated by supergene oxidation, although some high-

grade gold occurs in unoxidized rocks as well.  The 90 Zone extends from a depth of 

approximately 105 meters to subcrop just below the overburden and for 400 meters on 

strike. 

 

Locally, bonanza-grade gold and silver of the NS Zone occurs in sheared rhyolites and 

rhyolite ash tuffs.  Sulphide contents vary from trace to 5% and consist mainly of 

disseminated pyrite and galena with rare arsenopyrite.  The mineralization is generally flat 

lying and shallow.  Stratigraphically and structurally it appears to be a southward 

continuation of the Pinwheel Zone/Pinwheel Gossan across the East-west fault. 

 

Gold mineralization is also hosted by the large QFP intrusion that occupies the anticlinal fold 

hinge (Porphyry Margin or PM Zone).  Gold in the PM Zone occurs near, at, and/or across 

the footwall contact of the intrusion in the east and central portions of the deposit proximal to 

massive sulphide zones. Gold mineralization is associated closely with pervasive, moderate 

to intense silica alteration. Sulphide mineral assemblages include fineto medium-grained 

pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and locally visible free gold. 

Sulphides occur as disseminated grains, blebs, veinlets and wisps; thicker sulphide veinlets 

have a chlorite halo.  

 

In general assay data indicate good correlation between lead-copper and gold values for all 

zones.

7.8 Gossan (Supergene) Mineralization 

Near surface iron-oxide and precious metal-rich gossans cap the East Zone and the 

Pinwheel Zone.  Both are consistently enriched in gold and in the case of the Pinwheel 

Gossan, silver and copper.  No significant supergene base-metal enrichment has been 

identified in the East Gossan. 

 

The East Gossan caps the East Zone massive sulphide.  It subcrops under glacial 

overburden and at its eastern extent is capped by Paleozoic sandstone.  The East Gossan is 

generally 3 to 5 meters thick, hematitic, and very gold-rich. 

 

The Pinwheel Gossan caps the Pinwheel Zone massive sulphide in the west-central portion 

of the deposit.  The gossan locally exhibits a brecciated texture, probably formed by collapse 

of stratigraphic hanging wall rocks during volume reduction from supergene oxidation of the 

massive sulphide horizon.  Botryoidal textures exhibited by iron minerals and poorly 

developed cellular boxwork have also been noted locally in the outcrop.  In addition, 

columnar hematite/limonite observed in outcrop suggests supergene deposition above the 

water table, with the iron derived from adjacent massive pyrite (Blanchard, 1968).  Remnant 

disseminated magnetite in the gossan suggests a cherty iron formation (exhalite) protolith in 

this portion of the zone.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPE 
 

The zinc-copper-gold-silver bearing sulphide mineralization identified on the Back Forty 

property exhibits typical characteristics of VMS mineralization (Figure 8.1). This deposit type 

has been well documented in the literature since the early 1970's (Franklin et al., 1981) and 

the exploration model for the PVB was refined after the discovery of Flambeau (DeMatties et 

al., 1996). 

 

Figure 8.1 Schematic Cross Section through a VMS Mound 
 

 
 

Volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits form in a marine volcanic environment by the 

circulation of hot hydrothermal fluids near spreading centres.  Cold seawater infiltrating 

ocean crust off-axis is progressively heated by hot magma underlying the rift zone.  Heated 

and buoyant fluids leach metals from the surrounding rocks.  Metallic sulphides precipitate at 

or near the rock-water interface as a result of rapid changes in Eh and pH triggered by rapid 

mixing with cold ambient seawater.  Precipitated sulphides form massive mounds, fracture 

and cavity fills, as well as replacement textures.  Metal zoning is common with copper-rich 

zones at or near the centre and zinc-rich zones at the fringes of a sulphide mound.  Multiple 

replacement events and zone refinement are common, often due to changes in the internal 

plumbing system. VMS deposits are known in the Precambrian (e.g. Kidd Creek, deposits in 

the Noranda Camp), the Paleozoic (e.g. Rammelsberg), Mesozoic (e.g. Windy Craggy, 

Cyprus), and Cenozoic (e.g. Tag).

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
Geophysical surveys, and to a lesser extent, geologic mapping, have been the primary 

means of exploration on the Back Forty Project.  Sparse outcrop mapping in the immediate 

deposit area has yielded structural and geochemical data supporting the general deposit 

model, although outcrop distribution does not allow for any delineation of mineralization.  All 

rhyolite outcrops mapped in the area are highly pyrite-sericite-quartz altered.  Ninety percent 

of the whole-rock analyses of the Back Forty samples (mostly drill core) are considered 

intensely altered when plotted on HAI, ISER, and IFRAIS alteration scales.  Altered and 

mineralized outcrops extend north and west of the Back Forty deposit for up to 500 meters.   

Current sampling, whether from drilling or outcrop, has not identified the limit of strong pyrite-

sericite-quartz alteration associated with the VMS mineralization.  Indications are that 

mineralization may continue beyond the currently modelled resource. 

 

9.1 Geophysics 

Previous ground geophysical surveys completed over the prospect area were conducted by 

initial operator MPC and include horizontal loop electro-magnetic (Max Min), total field 

magnetics and gravity. Ground and down-hole pulse electromagnetic surveys (PEM) were 

conducted during the 2002 to 2003 drilling program.  The ground and down-hole geophysical 

surveys were conducted by Crone Geophysics with interpretation provided by ACNC 

geophysicists.  Four loops were laid out to locate extensions of the sulphide deposit. 

 

Additional PEM surveys that were conducted in the immediate Back Forty resource area 

were run during middle to late 2006 and 2007 with interpretation provided by Clark 

Jorgenson in 2007 and 2008.  All electromagnetic responses were modelled with the 

"Maxwell" program developed by Electromagnetic Imaging Technology of Perth, Australia. A 

number of geophysical targets were tested successfully; other targets could not be explained 

through drilling. 

 

A total of 98 drill-holes, approximately 29,000 meters, received down-hole PEM surveying. 

 

A regional heli-borne VTEM (Vertical Time Electromagnetic) survey was conducted in the fall 

of 2007.  The survey was run to the east of the Back Forty deposit, and covered over 

approximately 500 square kilometres and totalled 3,889 line-kilometres.  The survey covered 

the general trend of VMS deposits of the PVB. 

 

As of 2010, all PEM and VTEM surveys were currently under review by Hudbay personnel 

and contractors.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
Drilling on the property was conducted over several campaigns.  Between 2002 and 2011, 

563 boreholes totalling nearly 105,000 meters were drilled.  Drilling and sampling are 

described in more detail in the following sections.  A year by year summary of drilling is 

summarized in Table 10.1.  Figure 10.1 shows the traces of drill holes projected to surface.  

 

The first program, conducted by ACNC, started in February 2002 and continued to late May 

2003.  Drilling was contracted to Midwest Drilling Co., a Canadian company, using up to five 

Longyear 44 skid-mounted drill rigs.  In addition, a small number of holes were drilled by 

Kleiman Pump and Well of Iron Mountain, MI.  The program consisted of seventy-one 

boreholes (20,600 meters), from which approximately 7,600 assay samples and 340 whole-

rock samples were collected. 

 

The second drill program occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Drilling was completed by 

Idea Drilling Company (Idea) of Virginia, Minnesota, using two CS-1000 skid/trailer-mounted 

rigs.  This program delivered 13,190 meters of core in eighty BTW sized holes.  The majority 

of the drilling targeted the East and Pinwheel Zones. 

 

The third drilling program was completed in 2007. One hundred and eighteen boreholes 

(27,800 meters) were completed by Boart Longyear of Wyeth, Virginia and Idea.  Boart 

Longyear drilled twenty-two NQ sized holes (5,060 meters).  Idea utilized two drilling rigs, 

one of which drilled thirty-three NQ2 sized holes (10,300 meters) while the other rig drilled 

sixty-four BTW sized holes (12,400 meters).  This drilling program tested a number of targets 

throughout the resource area. 

 

A fourth drill program was completed in 2008 using three drilling rigs; one from Boart 

Longyear and two from Idea.  The former company completed fifteen NQ sized holes (2,600 

meters).  Idea completed thirteen NQ2 sized holes (4,850 meters) and thirty-eight BTW sized 

holes (6,500 meters).  Similar to the previous year, drill targets were distributed throughout 

the resource area. 

 

From the October 2009 to May 2010, another phase of drilling was mounted.  Two rigs were 

used: one from Idea (trailer mounted Hagby) and one from Boart-Longyear (skid-mounted 

44).  For this program, Idea drilled the first 20 holes on the project using NQ2 and the holes 

were oriented (total 1327 meters).  Idea subsequently completed 93 NQ3 split-tube oriented 

holes and one extension using BTW for a total of 8681 meters.  Idea also drilled 11 holes 

outside the immediate deposit area that were not used for the updated resource calculation 

(1388 meters).  Boart-Longyear completed 11 NQ3 split-tube oriented holes that were 

included in the updated resource totalling 1,492 meters.  In addition, Boart-Longyear 

completed five NQ3 "geotechnical" holes that targeted the conceptual open pit walls (971

meters).  The core from these holes was archived in entirety, i.e. not cut and assayed, so 

they are not included in the current resource calculation. 

 

Drilling from 2009 to 2010 outside the immediate Back Forty deposit approximately 600 

meters to the east was targeted on ground magnetic and gravity anomalies.  Anomalous zinc 

and gold mineralization in altered rhyolites and sediments was encountered in two holes.  

Drill hole PTL-1 intersected 10.0 meters of 0.61% zinc, including one 1.5 meter sample of 

1.08% zinc.  PTL-2 encountered an interbedded sequence of flows and tuffaceous 

sediments including a chlorite-altered fragmental zone containing 26.5 meters of 0.54% zinc, 

with smaller zones exceeding 1% zinc, a lower interval of tuffaceous sediments containing 

12.5 meters of 0.51% zinc, and an underlying siliceous breccia with 6 meters of 1.1g/t gold, 

including 1.5 meters of 2.67g/t gold.  This suggests that prospective host rocks continue to 

the east of the Back Forty deposit for at least 600 meters.  These two holes are not part of 

the Back Forty Mineral Resources.

The Back Forty project drilled 78 holes in a series of drilling programs from September 2010 

to November 2011.  The programs consisted of drilling 22 high grade gold targets at depth, 

four geophysical targets and 22 relatively shallow holes to delineate the Pinwheel Gossan 

Zone.  A total of 11 holes were drilled to collect metallurgical samples, 12 for condemnation 

purposes and 5 holes to install monitoring wells for groundwater purposes.  This drilling is 

not part of the current mineral resource estimate.  

 

Ground conditions are generally good resulting in excellent core recovery: between 90 and 

100 percent.  NQ and BTW sized core from each hole was logged by Aquila personnel. 

Information collected includes lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization.  Rock quality 

determinations (RQD) were also calculated over drilled intervals and specific gravity was 

measured on select samples. Oriented core from the 2009 to 2011 program were 

geotechnically logged in addition to geologically logged. 

 

All project data are located using the local UTM survey grid using North American Datum 

1983 (NAD-83), although prior to 2009 NAD-83 coordinates were converted to NAD-27.  

Borehole collar location was determined with a high resolution differential GPS unit (Locus 

system).  Geologic, assay and directional survey data were compiled manually, entered into 

Excel spreadsheets, then entered into Datamine Studio 3 for analysis and interpretation on 

plans, cross sections, and three-dimensional wireframes. 

 

Downhole borehole deviation was monitored during drilling using initially multi-shot Sperry 

Sun camera tool and later using a FlexIt Smart tool. Both instruments determine azimuth 

deviation by magnetic methods.  Downhole surveys were conducted approximately every six 

meters for the length of the drillhole.

11.0 SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND 
SECURITY 

 

11.1 Core Sampling 

Boxed core samples from a secure area at the drill sites were transported daily to the nearby 

Aquila field office, located on the property.  Prior to 2009, core was geologically logged and 

marked for sampling and cutting and sampling took place at the BFJV's field office facility. 

From 2009 to 2010 core was logged geotechnically and geologically, then marked for 

samples at the field office facility and transferred to a new core facility in Carney, MI (27 

kilometres away) for photographing, cutting, sampling and archiving.  Virtually all the core of 

both mineralized and unmineralized material from all holes was sampled by sawing the core 

length-wise and retrieving half the split core for assaying.  Typically, core of mafic dykes 

were not sampled unless they exhibited mineralization.  Assay intervals are generally 1.5 

meters in length honouring geological boundaries.  A total of 45,688 core samples have been 

collected and analyzed.  Core samples were sent to one of five assay laboratories.  In 

addition, 757 samples were sent for whole-rock analysis to one of two laboratories, and 605 

samples were used for metallurgical testing.  Table 11.1 shows a breakdown of the number 

of samples by drill hole, laboratory and year. 

 

Aquila used six primary laboratories for assaying core samples collected on the Back Forty 

project (refer to Table 11.1).  ALS Chemex Labs, Accurassay Lab, Accurassay, and 

Inspectorate America laboratories were used for primary drill core precious metal, base 

metal, and trace element analysis.  Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) of Ancaster, 

Ontario and SGS Mineral Services as umpire laboratories.  Whole-rock major element 

analyses of core samples were primarily performed by SGS Mineral Services (formerly XRAL 

Laboratories) with a small number by ALS-Chemex.  ALS-Chemex and SGS laboratories are 

accredited to ISO 9001 by QMI and ISO 17025 by the Standards Council of Canada for a 

number of specific test procedures, including fire assay for gold with atomic absorption (AA) 

and gravimetric finish, multi-element by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 

spectrometry ICP-AES, and AA assays for silver, copper, lead and zinc.  Accurassay is also 

accredited ISO 17025 by the Standards Council of Canada for a number of specific test 

procedures, including fire assay for gold with AA and gravimetric finish as well as copper, 

nickel, cobalt and zinc by aqua regia digestion and AA finish.  The laboratories also 

participate in a number of international proficiency tests, such as those managed by 

CANMET and Geostats.  Inspectorate America is ISO 9001:2008 accredited and participates 

in CANMET proficiency testing.  Actlabs is accredited ISO 17025 by the Standards Council 

of Canada for a number of specific test procedures including fire assay for gold with AA and 

gravimetric finish, and multi-element analysis using aqua regia and multi acid extraction and 

ICP-AES.

Inspectorate's lab in Sparks, Nevada.  ALS-Chemex prepared samples were sent to 

Vancouver for analysis.  Samples prepared by Accurassay were analyzed in Thunder Bay. 

Inspectorate prepared and analyzed samples in the same facility in Sparks. NV.  All pulps 

and coarse rejects were returned to Back Forty warehouse facilities in Michigan.   

 

11.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis 

 

11.2.1 2002 to 2003 Sampling Program 
 

The 2002 to 2003 drilling campaign generated approximately 8,000 samples that were 

submitted to ALS Chemex for analyses.  Samples were shipped to Elko, Nevada where they 

were prepared using standard sample preparation procedures (CRU-31).  The crushed reject 

was mixed by splitting once on a Jones riffle and then by recombining the two fractions (not a 

normal part of ALS Chemex's standard procedure).  A minimum of 250 grams of the crushed 

reject was split for pulverization (PUL-31) using a Jones riffle.  ALS-Chemex was instructed 

to clean the pulverizers with only pure silica sand after processing batches of highly-

mineralized samples and before processing low-grade samples (near the contact between 

massive and stringer zones).  Prepared pulps were then sent to Vancouver, BC for analysis. 

 

In Vancouver, all samples were analyzed for gold by fire assay with AA finish (code Au-

AA25) on thirty-gram charges.  The lower and upper detection limits for this package were 

ten parts per billion to 100 parts per million, respectively.  Higher-grade samples were re-run 

with a gravimetric finish upon request.  All samples were also analyzed using a multi-element 

package (code ME-ICP61).  ME-ICP61 consists of a four-acid digestion, "ore grade" ICP 

package with over-limit samples re-assayed for copper, lead, zinc and silver by four-acid 

digestion followed by AA (code AA62).  A limited number of samples were analyzed for 

mercury by aqua regia digestion and flameless AA spectrometry (Hg-CV41 with detection 

limits of 0.01-100 parts per million), and for total sulphur by Leco furnace and Infrared 

Spectroscopy (code S-IR08 with detection limits of 0.01-50 percent). 

 

Specific gravity for a limited number of core samples was determined using the pycnometer 

method on pulverized samples (code OAGRA08b).  An additional 465 samples were sent to 

XRAL labs (now SGS) for whole rock geochemical analysis by tetraborate fusion X-ray 

fluorescence spectrometry (code XRF103).  All pulps and rejects were returned from ALS-

Chemex and stored indoors at Minerals Processing Corporation's Ropes Gold Mill facility in 

Humboldt, Michigan. 

 

11.2.2 2006 Sampling Program 
 
A total of 5,972 samples were assayed in 2006.  Samples from boreholes LK-72 to LK-93 

(2,270 samples) were sent to ALS Chemex.  Samples from boreholes LK-94 to LK-151, as 



Back Forty Deposit

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 64  
 

well as samples from the extensions of boreholes LK-78, LK-80, LK-81, and LK-88 (3,702 

samples) were sent to Accurassay. 

 

Samples sent to ALS Chemex were shipped to their Thunder Bay preparation laboratory 

where the samples were crushed, split, and pulverized according to their standard procedure 

(PREP-31).  The PREP-31 procedure includes the following steps: the entire sample is 

crushed until more than seventy percent of the samples passes a two-millimeter screen; the 

sample is split to 250 grams using a riffle splitter; and the split is then pulverized to greater 

than eight-five percent passing a seventy-five micron mesh. Prepared samples were shipped 

to Vancouver for assaying. All samples were analyzed for gold by thirty-gram fire assay and 

AA finish (code AA25). Detection limits for this method are 0.01 to 100 parts per million. All 

assay results greater than three parts per million gold were automatically re-run using thirty-

gram fire assay with gravimetric finish (code Au-GRA32). The detection limit for these re-

runs was 0.05 to 1,000 parts per million gold. 

 

All samples were also assayed for a suite of trace elements using a four-acid digestion 

followed by ICP-AES (Code ME-ICP61a, ME-ICP61a or ME-OG62, depending on the 

expected levels). Samples sent to Accurassay were crushed to ninety percent passing eight 

mesh, then a 250 gram split was taken and pulverized to ninety percent passing 150 mesh 

(code ALP1). All samples were analyzed for gold by thirty-gram fire assay with AA finish 

(code ALFA1).  The lower detection limit of this assay type was five parts per billion. All 

results greater than five parts per million gold were re-analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric 

finish with a lower detection limit is five parts per million (code ALFA3). 

 

Low- and intermediate-grade samples were analyzed for a thirty-two element suite using a 

three-acid digestion followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS, 

code ICPMA). High-grade samples were analyzed using "ore grade" three-acid digestion with 

an AA finish. Coarse rejects and pulps were returned and stored in Aquila's indoor core 

storage facility in Daggett, Michigan. 

 
11.2.3 2007 to 2008 Sampling Programs 
 
In 2007 and 2008, Aquila continued to submit assay samples to Accurassay for assaying 

using the same procedures described above. In 2007, a total of 12,210 samples were 

submitted for analysis. A total of 10,433 samples were analyzed in 2008. The reliability of 

Accurassay results was determined by submitting a number of samples to Actlabs for check 

assaying. 

 

In 2007, 1,575 samples were sent to the SGS Laboratories in Don Mills, Ontario for mercury 

and trace metal analysis. In addition, 222 samples were submitted for whole rock analysis to 

SGS, Lakefield.

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 65  
 

In 2008, 1,075 samples from the regular sample stream were submitted to Actlabs in 

Thunder Bay, in order to assess the quality and turn-around time of that lab in comparison to 

Accurassay. 

 

At Actlabs up to five kilograms of the sample were dry crushed to eighty percent minus ten 

mesh, followed by a riffle split and pulverization of 250 grams to ninety-five percent -150 

mesh (code RX1).  Three types of analyses were performed: a gold and silver fire assay with 

a gravimetric finish (code 1A3); a multi-element, four-acid digestion followed by inductively 

coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP/OES) (code 1F2); and an "ore grade" 

ICP scan for copper, lead, zinc, silver (code 8). 

 

Samples were prepared at SGS using standard preparation procedures (PRP89) consisting 

of a dry crush of a sample less than three kilograms in weight to seventy-five percent 

passing two millimeters.  This step was followed by pulverization of a 250 gram split to 

eighty-five percent passing seventy five micrometers.  Gold was assayed either by using a 

standard fire assay procedure on thirty gram charges with either an AA spectrometry 

(FAA313), or by gravimetric finish (FAG303).  Base- and trace-metals were analyzed using 

either a thirty-two element four-acid digestion with an ICPAES finish (code ICP40B), or a 

fifty-element, four-acid digestion with ICPAES and ICP-MS finish (ICM40B).  The latter 

package was used to test for indium, gallium and other rare metals that might provide added 

value to the sulphide mineralization.  Package ICP90Q was used to test potential ore-grade 

base metals. Cold vapour analysis was used to test for mercury (CVA14C). 

 
11.2.4 2009 to 2010 Sampling Programs 
 
During 2009 and 2010, a total of 7,742 samples (6,885 intervals of core, along with 630 

quality control samples, and 227 field splits) were sent to Inspectorate America Corporation 

Analytical Laboratories in Sparks (Reno, Nevada) for analysis.  At Inspectorate, samples of 

up to 2.0kgs were dried for up to 24 hrs, crushed and riffle split to ~250g, and then 

pulverized to >90% -150 mesh (SP-RX-2K). 

 

The samples were submitted for the standard GENX 10 package, which consists of a fire 

assay for Au (Au-1AT-AA), an ICP run (GNX10-AR-ICP) for metals Ag, As, Bi, Cu, Mo, Pb, 

Sb, Zn (by aqua regia digestion, ICP analysis), and analysis for Hg (Hg-AR-TR).  A fire 

assay-gravimetric finish (Au-1AT-GV) was performed on all gold results greater than 3ppm.  

Ore grade analyses by AA for zinc (Zn-AR-OR), Cu (Cu-AR-OR), and Pb (Pb-AR-OR) was 

run on overlimits (i.e. those values exceeding 10,000 ppm). 

 

A total of 213 check (umpire) assays were performed by SGS in Toronto, Ontario on pulps 

initially analyzed by Inspectorate during the 2009 to 2010 program.  SGS analyzed gold by 

fire assay with gravimetric finish (FAG303) and 40 trace elements by ICP (ICP40B, multi-acid 

digestion).  ICP over limits for silver were rerun using ore grade analysis by AA (AAS21E) 

and for copper, lead, or zinc by ICP (ICP90Q).

April 2012 Page 66  
 

In addition, 12 core samples were submitted to SGS, Lakefield, Ontario for whole rock 

analysis (XRF76C). 

 

11.3 Specific Gravity 

Between 2007 and 2009, Aquila completed approximately 597 specific gravity 

measurements on core samples using a standard weight-in-water, weight-in-air 

determination.  An electronic scale with an accuracy of ±0.1 gram was used for weight 

measurements.  The scale was mounted on a tripod standing over a large pail of water 

beneath the scale.  Dry core pieces were weighed on the scale and then in a metal basket 

suspended in water.  The metal basket was balanced on the scale to zero.  The entire split-

core interval that was sampled for assaying was weighed in two or more operations.  The 

following procedures were used to ensure measurements are accurate: 

 

• Core was washed to remove material remaining from diamond saw cutting. 

• Core was dried after washing. 

• Measurements were repeated periodically and checked to maintain accuracy of 

measurements. 

• Accuracy of scale was checked and adjusted by using standard set of weights as 

part of standard procedures. 

 

In addition, Aquila received specific gravity measurement on core samples submitted for 

assaying as follows: 

 

• Eighty-eight core specific gravity measurements by G&T Metallurgical Services 

laboratory via the Stewart Group. 

• 261 pycnometer (ALSG2) specific gravity measurements (including forty-one repeat 

measurements) by Accurassay in Thunder Bay. 

• Thirty-seven specific gravity measurements by pycnometry by ALSChemex (GA-

GRA08b) in Vancouver. 

 

11.4 Security 

For the 2009 to 2010 programs, core was removed directly from split-tube core barrels and 

placed in 3m long aluminum core "V" rails.  It was then transported by Aquila personnel 

directly to the Aquila field office located less than one mile away from the drill rig.  These rails 

were placed inside the Back Forty core logging garage, which is secured by lock and alarm 

systems.  The core was geotechnically logged in the logging garage and then transferred to 

wooden core boxes by Aquila personnel.  Once transferred to wooden boxes, the core was 

geologically logged and marked for sampling.  The wooden core boxes were then covered 

and transported to the Back Forty core warehouse in Carney, MI.  The core was 

photographed, cut, sampled, and shelved at the Carney facility.  The Carney core warehouse 

is secured by locks and alarm system.  The core samples were packed and shipped from the

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 67  
 

Back Forty core warehouse facility by ground courier directly to Inspectorate America Labs in 

Reno.  

 

Prior to 2009, all core was housed either in the outdoor fenced storage at the field office or at 

the indoor Daggett core warehouse.  As of 2010, all core from previous programs was 

transferred to the Back Forty core warehouse in Carney and was photographed prior to 

archiving.   

 

All digital computer files, including core photographs, logs, and data, are saved onto a 

central server at the Back Forty JV main office in Stephenson, MI.  The entire contents of the 

server are backed-up onto a tape drive and removed from the premises on a daily basis. 

 

11.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 

The exploration work conducted by Aquila was carried out in general compliance with 

industry best practices using a quality assurance and quality control program.  All aspects of 

the exploration data acquisition and management, including mapping, surveying, drilling, 

sampling, sample security, and assaying and database management, were conducted under 

the supervision of appropriately qualified geologists. 

 

The analytical quality control data for the Back Forty project includes both internal and 

external quality control measures. Aquila used IS0-17025 and ISO-9001-accredited 

laboratories which implemented internal laboratory measures consisting of inserting quality 

control samples (blanks and certified reference materials and duplicate pulps) within each 

batch of samples submitted for assaying. 

 

Aquila also implemented external analytical quality control measures for all samples 

submitted for assaying.  This included inserting quality control samples (blanks and certified 

reference material) with each batch of core drilling samples, field splits, and submitting 

analyzed pulps for check (umpire) assays to an alternate laboratory. 

 

11.5.1 Previous Quality Control Evaluations 
 
An evaluation of the 2002 to 2008 analytical quality control measures and results can be 

found in previous technical reports (Keller, 2009; Dematties, 2007; Dematties, 2004).  These 

reports concluded that exploration data from the Back Forty Project was acquired using 

adequate quality control procedures that generally meet industry best practices for a 

resource delineation-stage exploration property. 

 
11.5.2 2009 to 2010 Quality Control Program 
 

Quality control for the 2009 to 2010 sampling program involved inserting external reference 

standards and blanks into the sample stream.  Reference standards were purchased from 

CDN Resources Laboratory (CDN), Delta, BC, which prepares standards under the 



Back Forty Deposit

supervision of Duncan Sanderson, Certified Assayer of British Columbia.  At CDN, material 

is dried, crushed, pulverized and screened.  The screened material is mixed for five days in a 

double-cone mixer.  Splits are taken and sent to up to fifteen laboratories for round robin 

assaying. 

 

Standards chosen for use at Back Forty include high- and low-grades of gold-only standards 

and several different multi-element standards that contain some or all of the following metals 

at varying grades: gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc.  Table 11.2 shows the reference standards 

employed during the 2009 to 2010 program and the number of individual element analyses 

obtained.  A total of 490 mineral reference standards were used.

Aquila used two blank samples (CDN-BL-2 and CDN-BL-3) prepared from barren granitic 

rock by CDN.  These blanks were certified to contain low precious metals by D. Sanderson, 

a licensed assayer of British Columbia after independent analysis of the material at ten 

commercial laboratories.  Aquila also used bulk quartz sand as a blank.  A total of 140 blank 

samples were used in 2009 to 2010. 

 

Field splits of core samples provided an additional check on analytical consistency.  The 

preparation of these samples involved breaking core from a selected sample into less than 

three centimeter-sized fragments, randomly mixing them, and splitting the fragments into two 

separate samples.  While these core splits are not considered true field duplicates, they 

served as a general check on the reproducibility of the analyses. A total of 227 these 

pseudo-duplicates were used.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

12.1 Verifications by Aquila  

 
All drill hole data is verified and checked by Aquila senior geologists before entry in the drill 

hole database.  In addition, a number of internal checks on the data are undertaken when 

data is entered into a drill hole viewers and resource modelling programs. 

 

In 2010, Aquila initiated a program of loading all geologic and analytical data into EQuIS, a 

structured database.  This required a review of all prior geologic logs, sample spreadsheets, 

geotechnical data, and analytical methods, which provided an additional verification of the 

data.   

 

12.2 Verifications by Hudbay 

 
12.2.1 Site Visit 
 

A report submitted to Hudbay by independent geological consultant Craig Taylor on June 21 

2009 as part of Hudbay's due diligence efforts reviewed the operating practice and 

procedures utilised by Aquila Resources Inc., for processing diamond drill core.  Among the 

conclusions stated the procedures and practices employed were deemed adequate and 

accurate.  A random independent selection of core sampling was also conducted and all 

values resulted in an accepted range except for one sample for high grade gold.  The chain 

of custody and the verification of the root database versus the sample certificates were also 

conducted and the contained information was found to be accurate. 

 

Subsequent visits to the property by Cashel Meagher, P.Geo. with Hudbay and observations 

on these visits provide confidence that suitable procedures and practices are being 

maintained and adhered to.  The most recent of these visits was October 18th 2010. 

 

12.3 Verification of Analytical Quality Control Data 

Table 12.1 shows the number and percentage of quality control samples incorporated in the 

Back Forty Project 2009 to 2010 program.  The overall percentage of quality check samples 

was 18.4%.  This proportion is considered adequate for the purposes of tracking the quality 

of assays.

12.3.1 Performance of Field Blanks 
 

Field blanks are used to monitor contamination introduced during sample preparation and to 

monitor analytical accuracy of the laboratory.  Three blank materials CDN-BL-2, CDN-BL-3, 

and sand (called 'Blank' and was purchased in bulk) were used for insertion into sample 

stream.  A total of 140 blanks were analyzed (Note: Approximately 30 analyses were used to 

determine the average analysis of 'Blank'). 

 

For gold analyses, 132 samples measured at or below detection limit and another six 

measured in the less than 100ppb range.  Two gold analyses were anomalous.  Silver 

performed similarly with all but 122 samples at or below detection limit, another 17 samples 

were less than 1ppm, and one sample was considered anomalous.  The anomalous silver 

sample also registered low, but anomalous, levels of gold, lead and zinc.  All other base 

metal analyses were within acceptable limits for blank material.  Based on the performance 

of the blanks as a whole (99% of analyses within acceptable limits for blanks) the anomalous 

samples did not affect the integrity of the assay data. 

 

12.3.2 Performance of Reference Material 
 

Time-domain (based on drill hole) performance of reference standards are plotted by 

element and standard in Appendix A.  Analyses by Inspectorate America (IAC) were within 

accepted limits of error with one exception.  Some analytical jobs consistently returned lead 

and zinc values greater than three standard deviations for standards that contained lead and 

zinc near 1%.  Discussions with Inspectorate determined that 1% lead and zinc values are 

near the upper limit of analysis for the ICP package, and are at the 1% lower limit for the AA 

range.  Although original ICP analyses were largely within acceptable limits of error, many 

were slightly over 1%.  These samples were subsequently sent for ore-grade AA analysis.  

The ore grade AA analysis was found to be slightly out of calibration, which gave the results 

a high bias.  Inspectorate addressed the over limit reporting protocol, as well as the AA 

calibration issue, and adequately reassayed all affected samples.

A linear regression plot of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc for 213 replicate analyses of 

pulps originally analyzed by IAC and subsequently by SGS Toronto is shown in Figure 12.1.  

Comparative analyses are robust, with regressions for all five elements falling within 

acceptable limits of deviation.  A similar plot of gold analyses obtained by fire assay with AA 

finish versus the same sample analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish exhibits similar 

results (Figure 12.2).

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL 
TESTING 

 

The following test programs have been performed on the oxide and sulfide mineralization 

from the Back Forty deposit.  The test programs were performed by the following 

metallurgical testing laboratories and their test information is detailed below: 

 

• Resource Development, Inc. 

• SGS/Lakefield Services 

• G&T Metallurgical Services, Ltd. 

 

13.1 OXIDE MINERALIZATION METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Metallurgical testing of the oxide mineralization was completed by Resource Development 
Inc., (RDi) and SGS Canada (SGS) and this section summarizes the results of the reports 
shown in Table 13.1.

from the Michigan State Back Forty Project 

 

13.1.1 Progress Report No. 1 for Metallurgical Testing of Back Forty Oxide Ores - RDi 

 

1) Oxide mineralization testing was performed on composites of samples designated as 

East Gossan (EG) and Pinwheel Gossan (PWG). The EG composite assayed 25.20g/t 

gold and 10.23g/t silver and the PWG composite assayed 5.59g/t gold and 75.17g/t 

silver. 

2) Bond Ball Mill Work indices (BBMWi) were determined at a grind of 100-mesh for both 

composite samples. Composite sample EG has a BBMWi = 15.52 and Composite 

sample PWG has a BBMWi = 12.0. 

3) Abrasion indices (Ai) were determined for both composite samples.  Composite sample 

EG has an Ai = 0.0526 and Composite sample PWG has an Ai = 0.0291, indicating that 

the ore is non-abrasive. 

4) A total of 20 cyanide leach tests were performed on the two composite samples.  The 

test results indicate the following: 

a. Both the gold and silver minerals appear to leach very quickly as the majority of the 

mineral extractions took place in six hours of leach time; 

b. A primary grind of P80 = 150 mesh appears to be the optimum grind for both of the 

composites;

c. A NaCN concentration of 0.75g/L or higher will maximize the gold extraction 

d. A pre-aeration time of four hours appears to slightly reduce the NaCN consumption; 

however, without pre-aeration the NaCN consumptions were also reasonable; and 

e. The leach pulp density can be increased to 45% by weight without any detrimental 

effect on the Au extraction 

 
13.1.2 Metallurgical Testing of Three Gold-Bearing Samples from the Michigan State 

Back Forty Project 
 
Oxide mineralization testing was performed on composites of samples designated as 90 
Gold Zone, PM Gold Zone, and East Gossan (EG). The 90 and PM Gold Zone samples were 
received as drill cores and the EG was received as assay rejects. 
 
1) Bottle roll cyanidation tests were performed on each of the composite samples resulting 

in the following: 

a. The 90 Zone composite sample assayed 1.97g/t gold and 38.1g/t silver;  

b. The PM Zone composite sample assayed 2.62g/t gold and 41.4g/t silver; and 

c. The EG composite sample assayed 41.0g/t gold and 8.7g/t silver 

2) The BBMWi for the EG composite sample was 15.0kWh/t, indicating a moderate degree 

of hardness. 

3) Carbon in Leach (CIL) and Carbon in Pulp (CIP) tests were performed on each of the 

composite samples resulting in the following: 

a. Direct cyanide leaching of the 90 Zone composite resulted in 86% gold recovery and 

37% silver recovery; 

b. Direct cyanide leaching of the PM Zone composite resulted in 95% gold recovery and 

51% silver recovery;  

c. Direct cyanide leaching of the EG composite resulted in 96% gold recovery and 45% 

silver recovery; 

d. Gold and silver extractions were similar for both CIL and CIP tests; 

e. Silver extractions were higher in the CIL and CIP tests for the EG composite in 

comparison to the tests performed without carbon; 

f. All leached samples were amenable to cyanide detoxification using the SO2 air 

process; and 

g. Since sodium metabisulfite (a partially neutralized form of SO2) was used in the 

laboratory tests to allow for the accurate addition of reagents, the hydrated lime 

requirement for pH control in a commercial plant using SO2 gas would likely be 

higher by approximately 0.5 moles of hydrated lime per 1.0 moles of SO2 (or 0.58 

grams of hydrated lime per gram of SO2). 

 

13.1.3 Metallurgical Design 
 
Based on the proposed LOM production schedule the design of the oxide leach circuit is 

planned for approximately 600 to 650 tonnes/day.  Lyntek has relied upon the process 

information provided by RDi to design the leach plant.

13.2 SULFIDE MINERALIZATION METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 

The sulphide mineralization metallurgical testing was completed by G&T Metallurgical 
Services, Ltd, (G&T) and this section provides a summary of these three reports shown in

13.2.1 Metallugical Assessment of the Back Forty Deposit KM2775 

 

The Back Forty Project is an advanced exploration stage volcanogenic massive sulphide 
deposit with extensive metallurgical test programs and program KM2775 was aimed at 
developing a process flowsheet to treat the Back Forty mineralization using the following 
objectives:  

1) Prepare a composite from drill core samples, similar in chemical composition to Main 

Zone Composite 1, tested in KM2047. 

2) Determine the metallurgical response of the new composite to a sequential pyrite circuit, 

using the flowsheet schematic previously determined in KM2047, Test 111 for the bulk 

and zinc circuits. 

3) Investigate the effect of various collectors in the pyrite circuit to maximize gold and silver 

recovery to the concentrate. 

4) Determine the potential for gold and silver leaching from the pyrite concentrate. 

 

The composite used in this program was constructed from 18 drill core samples from a 
program that commenced in late October 2010 and was completed by mid May 2011. 

 

13.2.1.1  Chemical Assays 

 
1) Two composite samples (Main Zone Composite 1 and Main Zone Composite 2) were 

prepared in this program in an attempt to prepare a composite similar in chemical 

composition to Main Zone Composite 1, which was prepared and tested in previous 

project KM2047.  The chemical composition of the two composites was determined by 

standard assaying techniques.  

2) The zinc content of Main Zone Composite 2 was much lower than that of Main Zone 

Composite 1; therefore, no test work was conducted on this material.  The test work was 

conducted on Main Zone Composite 3. 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 78  
 

3) The copper content on Main Zone Composite 3, at 1.23%, was considerably higher than 

that of Main Zone Composite 1.  The zinc and gold content were also slightly higher.  

Lead content was similar at 0.08%, while silver content was slightly less at 11g/t. 

 

13.2.1.2  Flotation Response 
 
A series of cleaner tests were conducted using the flowsheet schematic developed in 
KM2047, Test 111, followed by a sequential pyrite circuit.  Various collectors were examined 
in the pyrite circuit to investigate further gold and silver recovery.  The following points may 
be of interest:  
 
1) Bulk and zinc circuit metallurgical performance differed significantly from the 

performance of Main Zone Composite 1 in KM2047.  This was expected, given the 

variance in mineralization chemical composition. 

2) Use of Cytec Aero 5688, in the pyrite circuit, at both pH 8.0 and pH 12.0 resulted in poor 

gold and silver recoveries to the pyrite concentrate.  Using Potassium Amyl Xanthate 

(PAX) as the collector, in the pyrite circuit, resulted in the highest silver and gold 

recoveries to the pyrite concentrate.  For these tests, on average, silver and gold were 

9% and 7% recovered to the pyrite rougher concentrate, grading 11g/t silver and 3g/t 

gold.  Due to lack of test budget, no other collectors were tested. 

3) The pyrite rougher concentrate I and II, and pyrite rougher concentrate III, from Test 5, 

using PAX, were subjected to standard cyanidation bottle roll leach tests.  Silver and gold 

from the flotation feed were 1.1% and 2.3%, respectively, extracted to solution from 

pyrite rougher concentrate I and II.  Silver and gold recovery from the feed to solution, 

from pyrite rougher concentrate III, was determined to be 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively. 

4) Although gold and silver recoveries to the pyrite concentrate were low, so was pyrite 

recovery to the pyrite concentrate.  It is unknown if gold and silver flotation behaviour are 

in fact associated with pyrite flotation. 

 

13.2.1.3 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
1) The sample tested in this program, designated Main Zone Composite 3 was prepared in 

order to be similar in chemical composition to Main Zone Composite 1 that was tested in 

KM2047.  Main Zone Composite 3 contained similar levels of lead to Main Zone 

Composite 1 however it contained higher copper, zinc, iron, and gold values. 

2) As requested by the client, the flowsheet schematic used in KM2047, Test 111 was used 

to initially float a bulk concentrate followed by a sequential zinc circuit.  The flowsheet 

was modified to include a sequential pyrite circuit to further recover gold and silver.  In 

this program, however, due to the difference in chemical composition of the new sample, 

the metallurgical performance of Main Zone Composite 3 in the bulk and zinc circuit, 

varied from that of Test 111, KM2047.  For the new sample, both copper and zinc 

metallurgical performance was inferior to Main Zone Composite 1, as were gold and 

silver recoveries to the bulk concentrate.

3) Two collectors were utilized in the pyrite circuit to investigate improved recovery of gold 

and silver from the zinc circuit tail.  The addition of Cytec Aero 5688 at both pH 8.0 and 

12.0, resulted in very poor recoveries of gold and silver to the pyrite concentrate.  Using 

PAX, at pH 12.0, resulted in silver and gold recoveries of approximately 9% and 11% into 

a pyrite concentrate grading, on average, 11g/t and 3 g/t silver and gold. 

4) The pyrite rougher concentrate I and II from Test 5 were combined to generate enough 

mass for a standard cyanidation bottle roll test.  Pyrite rougher concentrate III from Test 

5 was also subjected to a standard bottle cyanidation test.  Approximately 19% of the 

silver and 52% of the gold from pyrite rougher concentrates I and II was extracted to 

solution after 48 hours of leaching.  This converts to a recovery of 1% of the feed silver 

and 2% of the flotation feed gold.  Silver and gold recoveries to the leach liquor from 

pyrite rougher concentrate III were 78% and 55%, respectively, after 48 hours of 

leaching.  This converts to a recovery of 1.1% of the feed silver and 1.5% of the feed 

gold. 

5) Both gold and silver recoveries to the pyrite concentrate were low. However, pyrite 

recovery, based on iron and sulphur recoveries, was also low in the final pyrite 

concentrate, using PAX as the collecting agent.  It is unknown whether gold and silver 

from the zinc rougher tails are associated with pyrite.  More aggressive flotation of pyrite 

in the pyrite circuit would provide information in regards to gold and silver flotation 

behaviour. 

6) Assessing gold and silver occurrence and their association with other minerals in both 

the pyrite concentrate and rougher tailings is also recommended.  This analysis will 

assist in determining the best means for recovering gold and silver from the zinc rougher 

tailings. 

7) Due to the un-optimized flotation performance in the bulk and zinc circuits, gold and 

silver losses were 15% and 5% greater than in Test 111 from KM2047.  As a result, 

incremental gold and silver recoveries, to the pyrite concentrate and subsequent 

cyanidation, are overstated. 

8) We recommend that, prior to investigating pyrite flotation and cyanidation performance, 

the bulk and zinc circuit flotation be optimized. This will allow for a more representative 

feed to the pyrite circuit and, hence, more meaningful data generation for optimization 

work in the pyrite circuit. 

 

13.2.2 Flowsheet Development Program, Back Forty Deposit KM2047 
 

A flowsheet development test program was carried out on a suite of composite samples 
taken from the Back Forty project.  Initially, the suite of composites tested was quite large. 
Later, blended composites were constructed to reduce the number of samples required to 
represent the main zones.

13.2.2.1 Flowsheet Considerations 
 
1) Ore hardness testing on both the individual samples and blends indicated that the Back 

Forty mineralization is soft.  Two standard BBMWi tests, carried out on two blended 

composites returned average BBMWi values of 10.0kWh/t. 

2) From a mineralogical perspective, the nine samples analyzed using modal analysis, were 

dominated by pyrite content.  The majority of the composites analyzed contained 

between 70% to 80% pyrite.  The next most abundant sulphide mineral was sphalerite 

ranging from about 0.1% to 13%.  Copper sulphide content ranged from about 0.3% up 

to over 5%. 

3) Based on the modal data, a primary grind sizing of between 75 to 100µm K80 will be 

required to achieve adequate two-dimensional chalcopyrite and sphalerite liberations. 

The mineral fragmentation data, derived from the modal analysis indicated sufficient 

chalcopyrite and sphalerite liberation to affect good rougher flotation response. 

4) A conventional copper-zinc flowsheet was used to process the blended composites. A 

zinc sulphate and sodium cyanide depression scheme was used to depress the zinc from 

a bulk copper (plus precious metal) flotation stage.  The bulk rougher concentrate was 

reground to between 15 to 20µm K80 prior to three stages of dilution cleaning at pH 10. 

5) The pH in the bulk rougher tailings was adjusted to pH 12 and conditioned with copper 

sulphate prior to zinc rougher flotation.  The zinc rougher concentrate was reground to 

about 15µm K80 prior to three stages of dilution cleaning at pH 12. 

 

13.2.2.2 Locked Cycle Testing – Blended Composites 
 
Locked cycle testing of four blended composites - South Limb (Test 100), East Hinge 
Massive (Test 101), East Hinge Stringer (Test 110), and Main Zone (Test 111) produced 
good metallurgical results for both copper and zinc.  
 
1) The four blended composites produced good copper metallurgical performance with 

average copper recoveries of 81% into the bulk concentrate.  Average copper content in 

the bulk cleaner concentrate was 28.3% at the average recovery.  Average gold and 

silver recoveries to the bulk concentrate were 49.3 and 41.5%, respectively.  The 

average gold and silver content was 113 and 775g/t. 

2) Average zinc circuit metallurgical performance was excellent with an average zinc 

recovery of 96% into a zinc concentrate grading 54.1%. 

3) For the Tuff Zone composite, both lead and zinc metallurgical performance was good.  

About 86% of the feed lead was recovered into a lead concentrate assaying about 65% 

lead.  Zinc recovery, to the zinc concentrate, was 93% at 54.3% zinc content. The lead 

concentrate contained 64 and 71% of the feed gold and silver.  The lead concentrate 

assayed about 25g/t and 1,842g/t gold and silver, respectively. 

4) The remaining three composites produced bulk concentrate containing between 75 to 

80% of the feed copper.  The copper/bulk concentrates contained between 15 and 26% 

copper.  Gold recovery to the bulk concentrate was 32 and 38% for the Pinwheel

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 81  
 

Extension and Deep Zone composites.  These gold recoveries to the bulk concentrate 

are about 10 to 15% lower than for the blended composites. 

5) The Pinwheel Extension composite produced zinc recovery of 88% at 56.4% zinc grade 

in the zinc concentrate.  The Deep Zone and Pinwheel Sulphide Copper Rich composites 

did not have enough zinc in the feed to achieve high zinc recoveries. 

 

13.2.2.3 Locked Cycle Testing – Non-Blended Composites 
 
Locked cycle testing of four non-blended composites: Tuff Zone (Test 98,102,107), Pinwheel 
Extension (Test 131), Deep Zone (Test 132), and Pinwheel Sulphide Cu-rich (Test 119) 
produced reasonable metallurgical results for both copper and zinc. 
 
1) For the Tuff Zone composite, both lead and zinc metallurgical performance was good.  

About 86% of the feed lead was recovered into a lead concentrate assaying about 65% 

lead.  Zinc recovery, to the zinc concentrate, was 93% at 54.3% zinc content.  The lead 

concentrate contained 64 and 71% of the feed gold and silver.  The lead concentrate 

assayed about 25 and 1,842g/t gold and silver, respectively. 

2) The remaining three composites produced bulk concentrate containing between 75 to 

80% of the feed copper.  The copper/bulk concentrates contained between 15 and 26% 

copper.  Gold recovery to the bulk concentrate was 32 and 38% for the Pinwheel 

Extension and Deep Zone composites.  These gold recoveries to the bulk concentrate 

are about 10 to 15% lower than for the blended composites. 

3) The Pinwheel Extension composite produced zinc recovery of 88% at 56.4% zinc grade 

in the zinc concentrate.  The Deep Zone and Pinwheel Sulphide Copper Rich composites 

did not have enough zinc in the feed to achieve high zinc recoveries. 

4) Whole mineralization cyanidation and gravity concentration tests were carried out on the 

four composites that were designated as precious metal targets.  On average, about 

42% of the feed gold was recovered into a gravity concentrate containing 5% of the feed 

mass.  This concentrate was further upgraded and 29% of the feed gold was recovered 

into a concentrate ranging in gold content from 100 to 3,500g/t. 

5) The four precious metal composites also responded very well to gold extraction using 

cyanidation techniques.  On average, about 93% of the feed gold was extracted during a 

48 hour cyanidation bottle roll test.  Un-optimized sodium cyanide consumptions ranged 

between 0.5 to 1.5kg/t in these tests. 

6) Cyanidation bottle roll tests were also carried out on the zinc rougher tailings stream 

produced in locked cycle tests on the blends and individual samples.  On average, about 

15% of additional feed gold recovery can be achieved through this process. 

7) Mercury levels of about 50g/t in the bulk concentrate and over 300g/t in the zinc 

concentrate may also cause some problems with marketability of both concentrates. 

8) Cadmium levels of 150g/t in the bulk concentrate may cause marketing problems for this 

product. 

9) Combined arsenic and antimony concentrations in the bulk concentrate produced from 

the South Limb blend were above penalty limits.

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 82  
 

10) The minor element data for the concentrates needs to be analyzed by a concentrate 

marketing specialist to determine the potential marketability of each concentrate. 

 
A mercury level of 350ppm in the zinc concentrate is assumed and a penalty of $1.75/t for 
every 100ppm in excess of 100ppm is included in the project economics.  

 

13.2.3 Preliminary Metallurgical Assessment of the Back Forty Deposit – KM1983 
 
The main objective of the KM1983 test program was to evaluate the mineralogical and 

fragmentation properties of seven composite samples.  The information generated from 

these mineralogical studies were used to help direct subsequent metallurgical test programs.  

These composites represented the seven major mineralization types that were identified 

within the Back Forty project mineral resources at the time of the assessment.  Also included 

in the program was one preliminary scoping rougher flotation test on each of the composites. 

 
13.2.3.1 Initial Investigations 
 
The major mineralization types investigated in this program were as follows: East Zone + 
Hinge, Pinwheel, South Limb, Tuff Zone, Gossan Pinwheel, Gossan East and Stringer Zone. 
Half-core samples representing each of the above mineralized types were received at G&T 

on March 27, 2007.  Individual core intervals were combined to generate the seven 

composites. 

 

The metals of economic interest are copper, zinc, silver and gold.  One composite, the Tuff 

Zone, also contains potentially economic concentrations of lead.  The Gossan East and 

Gossan Pinwheel composites are mainly precious metal targets although the Gossan 

Pinwheel contains potentially economic concentrations of copper. 

 

Copper and zinc are the metals of economic interest in the East Zone, Pinwheel, South Limb 

and Stringer Zones.  Only the Tuff Zone has significant concentrations of lead and provision 

for recovery of lead may need to be considered for this mineralized type. 

 

Concentrations of arsenic, antimony, mercury and cadmium were analyzed in the head 

samples.  Arsenic concentrations are running between 800 to 1,300g/t and will likely 

concentrate to unacceptable levels in the final concentrates.  Mercury, cadmium and 

antimony all have the potential to concentrate to penalty levels in the final concentrates. 

 

The East Zone, Pinwheel and South Limb composites are essentially massive sulphides 

comprised of 80 to 90% pyrite.  The balance of the mineralization contained in these 

composites is comprised of non-sulphide gangue, sphalerite and chalcopyrite. 

 

The mineralogical composition of the Tuff and Stringer Zone composites is about 50% non-

sulphide gangue.  Pyrite content in these samples is significantly lower at about 37%.  The 

Gossan Pinwheel and Gossan East composites are essentially non-sulphide mineralization 

types with elevated concentrations of gold.  High chalcopyrite content in the Gossan

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 83  
 

Pinwheel composite could present difficulties if cyanidation were the preferred recovery 

method for gold. 

 

13.2.3.2 Conclusions 
 
Modal analysis and scoping rougher flotation tests were conducted on seven composite 

samples from the Back Forty project.  The seven composites were reported to represent 

seven distinct mineralized zones within the deposit. 

 

1) The composites were ground to between 85 and 147µm K80 prior to being sized for 

modal analyses.  The modal data indicates that from a physical perspective, a copper, 

lead and zinc separation should be possible in the rougher circuit.  The efficiency of the 

separation will also be highly dependent upon flotation circuit chemistry.  The flotation 

size for two of the composites, the Pinwheel and Tuff zones, will require a finer primary 

grind to achieve good mineral separations. 

2) Zinc deportment to the bulk rougher concentrate was high for both the Tuff and Stringer 

zone composites.  Zinc depressants, not used in the scoping rougher flotation tests, will 

be required in the bulk rougher circuit. 

3) Gold recoveries to the bulk rougher concentrate varied between 8 and 89% in the 

rougher flotation scoping tests.  Less than half the gold was recovered to the bulk 

concentrate for the Pinwheel and East Gossan composites.  These two composites had 

the highest feed gold content at 17 and 21g/t respectively.  The Tuff and Stringer zones 

had the best gold recoveries to bulk rougher concentrate at 85 and 89%. 

 

13.3 Metallurgical Design 

Lyntek has relied upon all of the above oxide and sulfide mineralization test reports as well 

as the preliminary proposed life of mine information to design the sulfide mineralization 

process circuitry.  The preliminary mining plan summarized the tonnes from each mineralized 

type that would be delivered to the oxide mineralization and sulfide mineralization processing 

plants.  The summary also presented the average grade of each of the mineralized types. 

 

On the basis of the information supplied from the preliminary mine design and with 

consultations with Hudbay, average grades for each mineralized type was selected for 

predictions of the average grade and recovery of copper, zinc, gold and silver from the 

deposit. 

 

RDi employed the data available, and the results of the various laboratory studies to prepare 

the following estimates of grades and recoveries of the values from the main mineralization 

types in the deposit as shown in Table 13.3 and 13.4.

Table 13.3 is based on the results from locked cycle testing, with the exception of the data 

for "Stringer".  There were no locked cycle studies conducted on mineralized material 

designated "Stringer."  The mineralized material from the "Stringer" portion of the deposit has 

been assumed to have the same metallurgical characteristics and response to flotation as 

the material designated "Main."  The values in the table reflect the adjustment to the 

metallurgical response of the material designated "Main" based on the lower copper, zinc 

and precious metals associated with the "Main Stringer" portions of the deposit.  

 

Over the life of mine the copper, zinc and precious metal grades of material fed to the sulfide 

flotation mill are expected to vary, as will the blends of the various mineralized rock 

designations.  The variations in grades are due to observed variations seen in core sample 

analyses, and variations in the blends of material that will be mined each year.  Production 

concentrates from the sulfide flotation mill will therefore vary, but the final projected 

concentrate grades and recoveries can be adjusted by factoring data from previous locked 

cycle testing on numerous mineralized samples.  Additionally, data from open cycle tests on 

similar materials from the deposit were employed in the preparation of the data presented in 

Table 13.3.  

 

The following additional laboratory studies are recommended to confirm and further define 

the process operations and projected metallurgical results over the life of the mine: 

1) Open cycle rougher and cleaner flotation tests should be conducted on additional 

samples of the sulfide mineralization material types that will be encountered over the 

life of the mine.   



Back Forty Deposit

____________________________________________________________________________________ 

 

April 2012 Page 85  
 

2) Locked cycle flotation tests should then be conducted on the same material studied 

in the open cycle tests described above. 

3) Both open cycle and locked cycle flotation tests should be conducted on samples 

prepared to represent the various blends of rock types that will be mined on a year 

by year blend basis. 

4) Detailed mineralogy (Qemscan) studies should be conducted on flotation 

concentrates that fail to meet required market grades to determine the extent of 

locking, and/or rimming of gangue material with the valuable minerals.  The 

mineralogy may also have to be extended to examination of final flotation tailing 

products where the overall recovery of copper and zinc are below economical levels. 

5) Emphasis on additional flotation testing on the material designated "Stringer" should 

be a priority, due to the large portion of the deposit in this designation. 

6) Agitated cyanide leaching tests need to be continued to confirm the operating 

parameters for the various mineralized material types.  The leaching studies should 

expand to include additional samples of non-sulfide rock types that contain elevated 

levels of precious metals, but are low in copper, zinc or both.  The low grade sulfide 

mineralized materials may or may not be suitable for treatment in the sulfide flotation 

plant.  Additional testing will be needed to determine the most economical process 

for these materials based on recoveries of precious metals by leaching and by 

flotation.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

14.1 Introduction 

The November 29, 2010 Back Forty deposit Mineral Resource Estimate was completed by 

Greg Greenough, P.Geo., and reviewed by K. Palmer, P.Geo. of Golder Associates Ltd 

(Golder).  The estimate incorporated data analysis, 3-dimensional solids modelling, and a 

block model utilizing Datamine Studio v2 (Datamine) in extended (double) precision. 

 

The Back Forty resource model consists of six mineralized zones constructed by Golder, 

based on drill hole geology and metal grade data.  Mineralization is broken by two cross-

cutting mafic dykes and two sub-parallel qtz-porphyry dykes, also modelled by Golder, as 

well as an east-west trending fault model supplied by Aquila.  Golder used top of bedrock 

drilling data and a topographic survey data to develop topography and overburden surfaces.  

The overall trend of the deposit is in a west-south-west east-north-east direction, with a 

length of approximately 1km, extending to a depth of over 500m. 

 

Although the anticlinal nature of this occurrence results in holes drilled from various angles, 

drill spacing in all directions in the upper portions (~200m) is 20m or less, and stretches to 

approximately 40m in the lower portions. 

 

This resource estimate is an update to the February 25, 2009 independent NI 43-101 mineral 

resource estimate submitted to Aquila by SRK Consulting.  The February 25, 2009 estimate 

was based on a complete data set of 325 drill holes and approximately 39,800 assayed 

intervals.  Drilling carried out by Aquila since the February 2009 estimate increased the 

available data to 51,652 assayed intervals in 479 holes. 

 

In the opinion of Golder, the block model resource estimate and resource classification 

reported herein are a reasonable representation of the global polymetallic mineral resources 

found in the Back Forty deposit at the current level of sampling.  The mineral resources are 

reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 

and have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 

Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices". 

 

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability.  

There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral 

reserves.  Mineral reserves can only be estimated as a result of an economic evaluation as 

part of a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study of a mineral project.  Accordingly, at 

the present level of development there are no mineral reserves on the Back Forty project.

14.2 Drill-Hole Data 

The Back Forty drill hole database information supplied to Golder by Aquila included a total 

of 479 surface drill holes.  The final collar, survey, and lithological data were supplied in csv 

format on July 16, 2010, and the final assay data was supplied in csv format on July 15, 

2010.  Five geotechnical holes contained no assay data and were removed from the collars, 

survey and geology files before import to Datamine. 

 

The drill hole data provided to Golder by Aquila is shown in Table 14.1.

The data was imported into Datamine and de-surveyed using internal processes.  Intervals 

greater than 10m were composited to 10m, and a 'dummy' data file included in the process 

for more accurate desurveyed holes.  A list of drill hole names and collar locations is 

provided in Appendix B. 

 

14.3 Geological Interpretation 

Digital terrain model (dtm) surfaces representing the topography and base-of-

overburden/top-of-bedrock were generated from the drill hole collars and the vertical depth to 

bedrock calculated by Datamine respectively. 

 

Main lithological features observed in the drill hole data and controlling the mineralization 

consist of two vertical cross-cutting mafic dykes, and two vertical quartz-feldspar porphyry 

(QFP) dykes running sub-parallel to the trend of the deposit. 

 

With both gold and zinc contributing significantly to the economics of the deposit, a cut-off of 

1g/t gold or 0.5% zinc was used to delineate the mineralization.  The quantity of silver was 

also used as a guide to ensure that significant value was not missed.  In general, the

modelling attempted to contain as much material with significant amounts of these three 

elements, while maintaining as little 'barren' material as possible.  The resulting mineral 

envelopes generally followed previously modelled zonal interpretations, but with fewer 

domains, and containing some additional lower grade material. 

 

Eleven separate domains were modelled (Table 14.2), including the cross-cutting dyke 

material, and given unique numeric ZONE codes. 

 
Table 14.2 Back Forty Resource Modeling Domains 

ZONE Description 

1 Previously modelled Pinwheel Massive Sulphide (MS) zone 

2, 3 Lower grade sulphide stringer mineralization; includes previously 
modelled Sulphide Stringer Zones (Hinge Zone SS, Hinge Zone2 
SS, and East Zone), and Porphyry Gold Zones 

9.1 Massive Sulphides, lying within Zone 3, plunging south-west; 
Previously modelled as Hinge Zone MS and East Zone MS 

9.2 Previously modelled as Deep MS 

55.1 Previously modelled as Pinwheel Gossan 

55.2 Previously modelled as East Zone Gossan 

38 (2) Two cross-cutting mafic dykes 

11 (2) Two sub-parallel Quartz-Feldspar Porphyry dykes 

 

The outer limits of the mineralization were extended using a distance of approximately 1/3 

the drill spacing (to the closest un-mineralized hole or from the last mineralized hole) as a 

control.  Surface meshes (dtms) were made from the digitized points in the general plane of 

the deposit using control strings for the outer limits.  This method is useful for removing 

irregularities in the outer limits, and also for minimizing interpretational bias that can exist in 

wireframes generated from section or plan strings/polylines. 

 

To ensure proper sample capture, points defining the mineralized envelope were snapped to 

the end points of the appropriate drill hole intervals and validated through visual checks.  The 

volumes were verified to ensure that there were no intersections or invalid (open or shared) 

edges. 

 

Boolean wire frame facilities in Datamine were used to provide correct contacts between the 

mineralized zones, cross-cutting dykes and gossan zones, as well as any upper limits 

extending to the bedrock/overburden contact. 

 

Aquila reviewed all Golder wireframe solids and found them appropriate for their geological 

interpretation and are shown in Figure 14.1

14.4.2 Data Capture 
 

The mineralization wire frame volumes were used to capture drill hole samples.  Samples 

with centres lying within the wireframe were selected, and since almost all points defining the 

volume are snapped to the appropriate ends of the samples no significant sample lengths 

appear outside. 

 

Length-weighted statistical analysis of the captured samples for each mineralized zone is 

presented in Table 14.4.  All statistics except LENGTH are weighted by LENGTH x SG 

except SG, which is weighted by LENGTH only.

14.4.3 Correlations 
 

Table 14.6 shows a correlation matrix developed from the Back Forty raw assay data.  No 

significant correlations between any of the potentially economic elements are obvious.  

However, the close relationships between SG and S, as well as S and Fe were used to 

calculate, through regression, values for SG where they did not exist in the assay data 

(detailed in Section 14.4.4).  It should be noted that these analyses are based on 8,664 

samples for S vs. Fe, and 358 for SG vs. S.  Analysis was also done on each mineralized 

zone, with no appreciable differences from those summarized in Table 14.6.

Only 510 assayed specific gravity (SG) values were contained in the Back Forty captured 

sample data, but the good correlation to S mentioned above allowed the regression formula; 

SG = 0.04018 x S + 2.64708, to be generated for 4,970 captured samples with missing SG.   

The close correlation between S and Fe was used to generate the regression formula; S = 

1.17563 x FE – 0.0026 x FE – 1.13942 for data with missing S where Fe exists, and by 

association, used this to calculate SG for another 6,987 captured samples (Figure 14.3). 

 
Figure 14.3 Back Forty SG vs. S and S vs. Fe 

 
 

Of the 9,786 remaining samples with missing SG, 9,404 were assigned the length-weighted 

average measured SG of the associated lithological unit observed in the logs (Table 14.7).

were assigned the length-weighted average SG across all rock types (except massive and 

semi-massive sulphides) of 2.90 (Table 14.8).

14.4.5 Capping Strategy 
 

Grade capping of composites was determined using composite statistics, histograms, 

cumulative frequency plots, analysis of contained metal and visual examination of the 

distribution of high grade across all domains.  The effect of any capping on copper grades 

was determined to be minimal and none were applied. 

 

The approach for Back Forty was to minimize the loss of contained metal through grade 

capping in favour of restricting the amount of grade spreading through more restrictive 

search parameters (minimum/maximum samples, octants, etc.). 

 

A summary of the capping values is shown in Table 14.9, summary statistics of the capped 

composites are in Table 14.10, and summary statistics of the un-capped composites are 

included in Appendix D.

A histogram of the captured sample data lengths was used to determine an optimum

intervals in most of the mineral zones ranged between 1.4 and 1.5m, and averaged 1.43m 

across all zones.  At the chosen composite length of 1.6m, 94% of the raw samples are 

combined into longer lengths, and 6% are split into smaller lengths. 

 

Figure 14.4 Captured Sample Length Histogram 

 
 

Prior to compositing, non-assayed intervals of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc were 

assigned 0.0 values. 

 

A compositing process mode was used that does not eliminate any samples from the 

compositing process, but rather forces all samples to be included by adjusting the composite 

length, while keeping it as close as possible to the chosen composite interval.  The maximum 

possible composite length will be 1.5 times the interval.

Since no correlation between density and any of the elements to be estimated were 

observed, density-weighting was not used in composite generation and grade estimation.  

Statistics for composite sample data are shown in Table 14.10.  Note that the total length of 

composited samples is the same as the corresponding captured samples total length (Table 

14.4).

14.5 Resource Estimation 

14.5.1 Unfolding 
 

The unfold process within Datamine Studio 2 was used to transform the composite sample 

data coordinates into an unfolded coordinate system, as defined by the mineralized 

geometries' footwall and hanging wall contacts.  This transformation essentially removes 

bends, pinches and swells in the mineral model, allowing for more robust variogram 

calculations and grade estimation. 

 

Strings representing the footwall and hanging wall contacts of the deposit are constructed 

and tagged, as shown in Figure 14.5.  These strings are then used to 'unfold' the composite 

samples into the transformed coordinate system shown in Figure 14.6.  The same unfold 

strings are used in the grade estimation process to unfold the blocks into the same 

transformed system as the composite samples.  In the Datamine unfolding system: the X-

axis in folded space becomes UCSA in unfolded space and represents the thickness of the 

zone; the Y-axis in folded space becomes UCSB in unfolded space and represents the 

down-dip direction of the zone; and the Z-axis in folded space becomes UCSC in unfolded 

space and represents the strike direction of the zone. 

 

Checks throughout the unfolding process are carried out to ensure that all samples were 

properly captured and unfolded. 

 

Zones 1, 2, 3, and 9.1 were unfolded separately, while the gossan zones (55.1 and 55.2) and 

deep massive zone (9.2) were estimated in folded space due to their relatively small regular 

geometry.

14.5.2 Grade Variography 
 

Variogram contours were calculated and plotted for each element, in each zone, to test for 

potential plunge in the grade continuity (see example gold contours for Zones 1 and 9.1 in 

Figure 14.7).  Any preferred orientation indicated by the contours should be validated 

through visual investigation of the sample data.  In the case of the Back Forty mineral zones, 

no obvious preferred orientation (non-orthogonal to the unfolded coordinates) supported by 

visual validation was observed, so no rotations were applied to the experimental grade 

variogram calculations.  Note that when working in the unfolded coordinate system, strike 

and dip rotations are already accounted for and so the only rotations required will be that 

needed to account for a plunge in the continuity.

A more complete set of variogram contours can be found in Appendix E. 

 

Experimental variograms were calculated for gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc and SG 

(density) in each zone using the parameters shown in Table 14.11.  Note that no rotations 

were applied to the unfolded and gossan zones while rotations were applied to Zone 9.2 

(deep massive), approximating its geometric orientation. 

 

Interactive fitting of models to the experimental variograms was carried out using Datamine.  

In addition to the normal variograms, the process calculates pair-wise relative variograms, 

which are the same except that every term in the calculation is divided by the average value 

of the two samples contributing to that term.  These pair-wise relative variograms were used 

in the variogram modelling process for all elements except SG.

Variogram modelling assumed the best fit using an anisotropic two structure spherical model.  

As can be seen by the variogram modelling results in Table 14.12 and Figure 14.8, the first 

structure ranges for all directions are relatively short.  The second structure ranges were 

used to help define the search distances used in the grade estimates.  (A third structure with 

long ranges and a very small variance was added for each model to give the variography 

some relevance in those final Kriged estimates using very long searches.)  Figures of all 

variogram models can be found in Appendix F.

14.5.3 Block Model Definition 
 

The block model for all mineralized zones and cross-cutting dykes covers a 3D block in UTM 

coordinates from 434330 to 435482 East, 5033090 to 5033658 North and -450 to 276 

Elevation (local elevation).  Generally, block shape and size should be a function of the 

geometry of the deposit, density of sample data, and expected potential smallest mining unit 

(SMU).

On this basis, an 8m (E-W) by 8m (N-S) by 6m (Elevation) parent block size was employed.  

It is expected that in the bottom third of the deposit where data is less dense, there will be 

some over-smoothing of grade with these block dimensions.  This is, however, addressed in 

large part by the variance correction applied later in the modelling process.  The block model 

definition parameters are summarized in Table 14.13.

The mineralization and dyke envelopes were filled with blocks, using the block model volume 

parameters described in Table 14.14.  Sub-blocking was permitted at the boundaries to get 

accurate volume representations.  To allow more thorough validation techniques, regularized 

models were also generated (all blocks put back to the parent cell size), with the field 

FILLVOL representing the volume of the block lying within the wireframe.  Volume checks of 

the 'split' block model for each zone versus the wireframes showed good representation (see 

Table 14.14).

To account for the cross-cutting features of the Mafic and QFP dykes and the occurrence of 

massive zones within the lower grade envelopes of Zones 2 and 3, the models were added 

together in the following sequence, with blocks of the second model overprinting those of the 

first: 

1) Zones 1, 2, and 3 combined (no overlaps) 

2) Massive zones added (replaces some blocks in Zone 2 and 3) 

3) QFP dykes added (replaces some blocks in all previous zones) 

4) Mafic dykes added (replaces some blocks in all previous zones) 
 

The retained ZONE field in the final model was used to identify each domain for grade 

estimation with the appropriate composites.

14.5.4 Estimation Methodology 
 

Block model grades for gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and SG were estimated using 

Ordinary Kriging (OK).  Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimates of the same elements provided 

declustered sample grades for block model validation. 

 

Anisotropic searches were performed, using the variogram model ranges for each element 

as a guide for each of the three axes, orthogonal to the unfolded plane of the deposit for the 

unfolded zones, and rotated as defined by the geometric orientations of the gossan and deep 

massive zones.  The search parameters for all elements are summarized in Table 14.15.

**  Fourth search same as third search, but without octant restrictions 
 

Three searches were utilized to Krige as many blocks in the model as possible.  The first 

search reflected the ranges determined in the variogram modelling.  The second search 

factored these ranges by two in the strike and dip directions but less in the thickness 

direction, to keep grade spreading to a minimum.  The third search factored the second 

search by approximately three in strike and dip directions, but again less across the 

thickness.  As part of the Kriged estimate, the search volume used in the interpolation of 

each block was written to the model file.  This information was used in the resource 

classification, to help differentiate between Measured, Indicated and Inferred resource. 

 

Octant restrictions were used in the first three searches, with a minimum of one sample in 

each of at least five octants required to estimate a grade.  Octant restrictions can tend to 

cause blocks along the contacts to remain un-graded.  To compensate for this, un-graded 

blocks from the interpolations using the searches in Table 14.15 were retrieved from the 

model and the estimation re-run using a fourth search parameter, which was the same as the 

third, but without octant restriction. 

 

During the modelling process, QFP and Mafic dyke material containing significant grade 

values (mainly along the contacts) were included in mineralization envelopes as much as 

possible.  There were still a significant number of samples in the dyke material however that 

contained low grade 'background' values for all of the elements, and in rare instances higher 

grade spikes occurred.  To eliminate the risk of high grade estimation within these mostly 

uneconomic lithological units, the high grade spikes were removed through capping, and the 

length-weighted mean grades of the capped data for each type of dyke material applied to

the Kriged block model.  Table 14.16 summarizes the capping values applied and the mean 

grades applied to the block model for QFP and Mafic dykes.

Also, the length-weighted mean SG of 2.75 for QFP and 2.78 for Mafic was applied to blocks 

representing these dykes. 

 

The distribution of grades within each of these dyke units is provided in histograms included 

in Appendix G. 

 

14.5.5 Variance Correction (Smoothing Assessment) 
 

The variability of individual block grades in the model must be close to that of the declustered 

sample data (NN) otherwise estimates of tonnages above a cut-off from the block model will 

be slightly inaccurate.  If the actual variance is too low, tonnages will tend to be overstated 

and grade understated, while if the variance is too high, tonnages will tend to be understated 

and grade overstated.  This comparison of actual variance to the theoretical variance can be 

called the smoothing ratio.  A smoothing ratio of >1 indicates over-smoothing, and a 

smoothing ratio of <1 indicates under-smoothing. 

 

The smoothing assessment in a grade interpolation compares the variance between the 

blocks obtained with each modeling technique to the theoretical variance of the block 

geometry according to the variogram model.  Factors used in the assessment include the 

block model cell size, variography, grade estimate search parameters, and the cell 

discretization used in the estimate.  Results of the smoothing assessment for the key 

elements of the Back Forty estimate are presented in Table 14.17.

It is generally accepted that if the difference between the block model global variance and 

the NN global variance is greater than approximately 20%, a variance correction should be 

considered. 

 

Lognormal smoothing corrections for each interpolated element are applied separately to 

each mineralogical domain, and correctly applied should result in: 

• The mean grades of the corrected and un-corrected grades should be the same. 

• The corrected global variance should be close to the expected global variance. 

 

Checks of the Back Forty show that these criteria were met.  A detailed tabulation of the 

variance correction parameters and validation statistics are provided in Appendix H. 

 

14.5.6 Net Smelter Return (NSR) Calculation 
 

Back Forty is a polymetallic sulphide deposit with each metal contributes to the value of the 

mineralization.  The mineral resources are therefore reported by utilizing a net smelter return 

("NSR"), based on preliminary metallurgical recovery test results shown in Table 14.18 and 

current long term metal pricing supplied by Hudbay.  The eight metallurgical domains 

determined by the testing were previously applied to numerous mineralogical domains.  With 

fewer domains in this resource estimate, the metallurgical test results were examined for 

similarities and appropriate association with the current mineral domains.

Current metal pricing supplied by Hudbay and used in the NSR calculation consisted of:  

900.00 (US$/oz.) gold; 15.00 (US$/oz.) silver; 2.50 (US$/lb.) copper; 0.70 (US$/lb.) lead; and 

0.95 (US$/lb.) zinc. 

 

The NSR ($/tonne) was assigned to each block by combining the contribution by each 

element.  For each element, the metal recovery was assigned to the blocks according to 

Table 14.18, recovered metal content per tonne calculated, and metal pricing applied. 

 

Since NSR values would be used as a cutoff in the resource reporting, and the proper 

distribution of blocks above a cutoff relies on a smoothing assessment (see section on 

Variance Correction), a corrected NSR (NSR_COR) was also assigned to each block using 

the same process, but using the corrected grades. 

 

14.6 Mineral Resource Classification 

Resource classification strategy included estimation parameters used in the estimate based 

on the gold variograms, and also took into account the assumption that the majority of the 

deposit would be extracted by open pit methods with little possibility for selectivity relative to 

the model's block size. 

 

Blocks graded within the ranges corresponding to the gold variogram sill with the minimum 

eight samples (maximum 24) were classified as Measured.  Those graded with ranges at 

twice the distance as those Measured were classified as Indicated, and blocks neither 

Measured or Indicated were classified as Inferred. 

 

Some continuity was given to classification by generating two volumes encompassing the 

majority of blocks meeting either the Measured or Indicated criteria.  All blocks captured 

within each of these envelopes were assigned the appropriate classification. 

 

14.7 Block Model Validation 

14.7.1 Visual Checks 
 

The Kriged block model (corrected for smoothing) was visually inspected in plan and section 

to ensure reasonable estimates when compared to the composite sample file.  Figure 14.9 

shows gold g/t on a typical section, and zinc percentage on a typical plan for the Back Forty 

deposit.  Note in the section view, higher grade (orange-red) following the contact as a result 

of the unfolding option.

14.7.2 Statistics 
 

Statistical comparisons between the composite samples, Nearest Neighbour estimates, and 

Kriged grade interpolations for each element, by zone, are presented in Table 14.19.  The 

Nearest Neighbour represents the declustered composite data.  Clustering of the drill hole 

data will result in differences between the global means of the composites and Nearest 

Neighbour estimates.  The global means of the Nearest Neighbour and Kriged estimates 

should also be similar, and for the most part this is the case for the Back Forty estimate.  Any 

noticeable differences are most likely the result of a number of holes at relatively low angles 

to the orientation of the mineralization, such as in the lower areas of Zones 1, 2, and 3, which 

are mostly classified as Inferred Resource.

14.8 Resource Statement 

The mineral resources for the Back Forty deposit are reported in accordance with Canadian 

Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and have been estimated in conformity 

with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best 

Practices" guidelines.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not necessarily 

demonstrate economic viability.  There is no certainty that all or any part of this mineral 

resource will be converted into mineral reserve.  The resource estimate was completed by 

Greg Greenough, P.Geo (APGO #0825) an independent qualified person as this term is 

defined in National Instrument 43-101.  The effective date of this resource estimate is 

November 29, 2010. 

 

The mineral resources are reported at two cut-off grades (NSR) to reflect the "reasonable 

prospects" for economic extraction, and the assumption that a good portion of the Back Forty 

deposit can be extracted through open pit methods.  To accomplish this, Golder carried out a 

Whittle pit optimization exercise using a NSR cut-off of $20. 

 

As described in Section 14.5.5 (Variance Correction) tonnages above a cut-off based on the 

'smoothed' grades from the block model will be slightly inaccurate.  To capture the correct

number of blocks, the tonnage above cut-off on the corrected grade must first be determined, 

and the cut-off adjusted to provide the same tonnage when applied to the 'smoothed' grade. 

To provide the correct tonnage of blocks above cut-off within the pit the cut-off was adjusted 

to $22.30 and applied to the smoothed NSR value.  The NSR of blocks lying outside and 

below the pit shell were compared to an adjusted underground mining cost of $60.80 

(original cut-off = $62.00) for the reporting of resource (Table 14.20).

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

No mineral reserves can be defined at the current time for the Back Forty deposit.  By 

Canadian Institute of Mining definition, reserves can only be declared after a minimum of a 

preliminary feasibility study has been completed.  The level of detail of this Technical Report 

does not meet, nor is intended to meet a preliminary feasibility study level of assessment.

16.0 MINING METHODS 
 

16.1 Introduction 
 

Back Forty mineralization extends to depths of more than 500m below surface.  This 

technical report assesses the potential economic viability of mining only the nearer surface 

mineralization by open pit methods.  Potential underground mining of deeper mineralization 

is not evaluated in this report. 

 

Significant features of the deposit include: 

• Proximity to the Menominee River, which limits the surface extent and depth of a 

potential open pit; and 

• Metallurgical characterization.  This PEA includes two processing methods to recover 

economic minerals from two general types of mineralization. Higher sulphide base 

metal mineralization is amenable to flotation concentration whereas low sulphide 

higher gold content mineralization requires leaching to recover contained gold.   

 

Open pit mining aspects of this preliminary economic assessment have been prepared by 

SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK").  

 

This preliminary economic assessment is not adequate to definitively confirm the economics 

of the Back Forty project.  A pre-feasibility study, or feasibility study, as defined in Canadian 

Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101, is required for this purpose.   

 

The portion of the measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred 

mineral resources used for evaluation purposes in the PEA above the cut-off value, including 

allowances for dilution and mining loss, is referred to as Run-of-Mine ("ROM") in this report.  

SRK cautions that ROM quantities cannot be considered Mineral Reserves.  The ROM 

quantity estimates presented in this conceptual study are based partly on Inferred Mineral 

Resources which do not support pre-feasibility level work or estimates of Mineral Reserves.  

Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated to form the basis for approximately 9% of ROM 

quantity estimates. There is no guarantee that further exploration will upgrade any of the 

inferred mineral resources.  

  

16.2 Geotechnical and Hydrological 
 

The deposit is overlain by glacial till and alluvial overburden ranging from 2 to 22m in 

thickness.  The upper 10 to 35 m of the bedrock below the overburden is partially weathered.  

A geotechnical assessment based on an earlier conceptual Back Forty pit that utilized 5m 

benches provided inter-ramp slope angle (IRA) parameters ranging from 48° to 52° in fresh 

rock depending on orientation, 39° to 45° in weathered rock depending on orientation, and

25° in overburden. An 8m catch-berm at the contact between overburden and rock was 

recommended. 

 

A geotechnical seepage cut-off wall located in overburden between the Menominee River 

and the open pit and described in Section 18.2, is planned to reduce potential seepage into 

the open pit.  Preliminary estimates of total groundwater infiltration into a potential open pit 

range from 28 and 83m
3
/hour.  Precipitation in the project area is estimated at 790mm 

annually.  The average annual pit dewatering rate is expected to be less than 135m
3
/hour, 

which is considered manageable.  

 

16.3 Mine Planning Block Model 
 

The resource block model data was exported from Datamine software (utilized for resource 

estimation) to MineSight software for mine planning purposes. 

 

The Datamine resource block model is based on 8x8x6m "parent" blocks, with "sub-blocking" 

to smaller block sizes at geological domain contacts.  Datamine mineralized block data, 

regularized to the 8x8x6m parent block size, was exported to an ascii file.  Each regularized 

8x8x6m block in the ascii file contained information on up to three geological domains within 

the block, including: the resource domain name; the portion of the regularized block 

represented by the domain; the domain Au grade, Ag grade, Cu grade, Zn grade, Pb grade, 

specific gravity ("SG"), block resource classification, and the preliminary net smelter return 

("NSR") estimate utilized for resource cut-off purposes. 

 

The geological domain envelopes, conceptual pit shell utilized for resource estimation, 

topographical surface, weathered bedrock surface, fresh bedrock surface, and various other 

features such as rivers, roads, property lines, and the proposed facility locations were 

provided to SRK in dxf format and imported into MineSight. 

 

MineSight block models utilize fixed block sizes, with model items identifying the 

percentages of the block within the geological domain contacts.  SRK constructed a 

MineSight block model using the following general steps: 

 

• The ascii data was imported into a MineSight 8x8x6m block model containing up to 

three geological domains per block.  For each domain the domain code, the 

percentage of the block within the domain, and the domain metal grades, SG, and 

resource NSR were imported.  The resource classification code for each block was 

also imported.   

• As a check the MineSight mineral resources within the conceptual resource shell and 

above the resource cut-off were reported, which very closely matched the mineral 

resource statement; 

• For mining purposes the selective mining unit ("SMU") is estimated as a whole 

8x8x6m block.  Block grades were diluted to whole block weighted averages by

combining all the mineralized and barren portions of each block.  Each block was 

assigned an overall geological domain code representing the majority of the 

mineralization in the block; 

• Metallurgical type designations as described in Section 16.4 were coded into each 

mineralized block in the model; 

• Updated net smelter return estimates ($/t) as described in Section 16.5 were 

estimated for each mineralized block, based on the metallurgical type and grades of 

the block, and coded into the model. 

 

16.4 Metallurgical Types 
 

For the purposes of this preliminary economic assessment Back Forty mineralization has 

been categorized into metallurgical types.  The deposit includes both sulphide mineralization 

and gold bearing gossans.  Portions of the sulphide mineralization are low in base metals but 

contain gold mineralization that is of economic interest.  It is proposed to process the higher 

base metal content sulphide mineralization through a flotation plant to produce copper and 

zinc concentrate.  It is proposed to process the low base metal high gold content 

mineralization through a leach plant to recover contained precious metals. 

 

The Back Forty resource model mineralization is located within eleven resource modelling 

domains that are described in Section 14.3 Geological Interpretation.  Five of these domains 

do not require metallurgical coding as they will not be processed separately.  These include 

Zones 11 and 38, which are four virtually barren mafic and quartz feldspar porphyry dykes, 

and Zone 9.2, which is located deeper than the open pit area of interest. 

 

Three resource modelling domains are easily correlated to metallurgical types.  Zone 9.1 

represents massive sulphides that will be processed by flotation.  Zones 55.1 and 55.2 

represent gossans that require leaching to recover contained gold.   

 

The remaining three resource modelling domains, i.e. Zones 1, 2 and 3, represent lower 

grade sulphide mineralization.  As described in Section 7 Geological Setting and 

Mineralization of this report some areas within these three zones contain significant gold 

values but low base metal grades and are not amenable to flotation processing.  Site 

geologists prepared preliminary envelopes or wireframes encompassing these high gold low 

base metal areas.  Mineralized blocks within these wireframes were coded into the mine 

planning block model as metallurgical types NS, 90Z, and PM, and are expected to require 

leaching to recover contained precious metals.  The remaining portions of Zones 1, 2 and 3 

have been coded as metallurgical types PWCu, Stringer2, and Stringer3, and are expected 

to be processed via flotation.  A cross-reference table of geological domains and 

metallurgical types is presented in Table 16.1 and an isometric view of the metallurgical 

types is presented in Figure 16.1.

16.5 Net Smelter Return (NSR) Estimation 
 

The Back Forty project contains potentially economic gold, silver, copper and zinc 

mineralization envisaged to be recovered utilizing two processing methods that produce 

concentrates and dore.  For mine planning purposes the net smelter return (NSR) for each 

block was updated based on the metal grades and metallurgical type designation.  Key 

inputs for mine plan NSR estimation include metal prices, metallurgical parameters (process 

recovery and product specifications by metallurgical type) and concentrate and dore terms, 

which are summarized below.  Royalties, which are discussed in Section 22 Economic 

Analysis, have not been incorporated in block model NSR estimates. 

 

16.5.1 NSR Metal Prices 
 

Metal prices of US$1,100/oz gold, US$22/oz silver, US$2.75/lb copper and US$0.95/lb zinc 

were provided by Hudbay for the purposes of block model NSR estimation. 

 

16.5.2 Process Recovery and Product Specifications 
 

Estimated process recovery for the various metallurgical types, as presented in Section 13 

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing, are summarized in Table 16.2.

16.6 NSR Cut-Off Values 
 

NSR estimates do not incorporate mining costs, on-site processing costs, or general and 

administrative costs.  To be economically processed the NSR of the in situ mineralization 

must at least be sufficient to cover these costs.  Mining costs are estimated at about $3.00/t 

Run-of-Mine (ROM) mineralized material and $2.50/t for waste.  Only the additional cost to 

mine as ROM or plant feed versus as waste rock is included in the marginal cut-off value 

estimates.  The marginal in situ NSR cut-off value ("CoV") for flotation feed and leach feed is 

estimated at $25/t and $39/t respectively as shown in Table 16.4.

16.7 Pit Optimization 
 

Pit optimization was conducted using Whittle™ software.  This software utilizes the Lerchs-

Grossmann (LG) algorithm to generate a pit shell that provides the maximum operating 

margin or cash flow (before capital, taxes or discounting) based on a resource model and a 

set of input economic and technical parameters.  A series of nested pit shells can be

generated by varying or factoring unit revenue estimates (referred to as "Revenue Factor" or 

"RF").   Nested pit shells are utilized for incremental and present value analysis, and to guide 

phase pit and ultimate pit design.   

 

16.7.1 Pit Optimization Parameters 
 

Pit optimization economic parameters include revenue estimates, and unit mining costs, unit 

processing costs, and unit general & administrative costs.   Unit NSR ($/t) values for each 

mineralized block were utilized for revenue estimation.  These NSR values incorporate metal 

prices, product freight, smelting, and refining costs, product payable terms, and process 

recovery. 

 

Pit optimization technical parameters include preliminary estimates of dilution and mining 

loss, and pit overall slope angles.  Overall pit slope angles, which include allowances for 

haulage ramps, are derived from geotechnical inter-ramp slope angle criteria, adjusted for 

the expected haulage ramp configuration.  The input parameters also include river and 

wetlands mining footprint constraints provided by Hudbay.  Back Forty pit optimization input 

parameters are summarized in Table 16.5. 

 

Note that NSR values are applied to inferred mineral resources in this preliminary economic 

assessment.

Figure 16.2 Pit Optimization Results 

 
 

Pit Shell W3-41 is the base case or "breakeven" shell generated utilizing the input 

parameters in Table 16.5.  Pit Shell W3-31, generated utilizing a revenue factor of 0.80, 

provides the maximum cash flow or operating margin on a discounted basis.  Analysis of the 

results shows that the incremental cash flow or operating margin on shells larger than #31 is 

less than $1/t mined.  For these reasons Pit Shell W3-31 is considered the optimum pit shell 

and was selected to guide pit design. 

 

Pit shell W3-31 contained quantities are summarized in Table 16.6.  The shell is illustrated in 

Figure 16.3.  Note that the pit shell is constrained by the river setback constraint and SW 

wetland constraint.

16.7.3 Wetland Constraint Sensitivity Analysis 
 

An additional Whittle pit optimization run (W4) was performed excluding the southwest 

wetland mining constraint, in order to determine the sensitivity of the mining quantities to the 

wetland limit.  The resulting selected pit shell W4-31 is illustrated in Figure 16.4.  Quantities 

contained within Shell W4-31 compared to Optimum Shell W3-31 (selected to guide pit 

design) are shown in Table 16.7.  The analysis shows that there is potential for 1.2 million 

tonnes additional ROM or plant feed requiring 7.8 million tonnes of additional stripping if the 

wetland mining constraint is excluded.  It is estimated that this could potentially provide 

approximately $35M additional operating margin based on the pit optimization unit cost and 

NSR estimates, but may increase capital and closure costs.  A larger waste disposal site 

would be required and closure costs would likely increase since the tentative closure plan 

under consideration involves backfilling the depleted pit with waste rock and tailings.

16.8 Pit Design 
 

Ultimate pit design is guided by Whittle pit shell W3-31, which includes the river constraint 

and wetland constraint.  The ultimate pit layout is illustrated in Figure 16.5. 

 

The pit design includes a 17m wide haulage ramp at a 10% gradient, which is suitable for 

two-way traffic by 40-ton articulated haulage trucks, including allowances for shoulder berm 

and ditch.  Near pit bottom the ramp is narrowed to 11m, which is suitable for single lane 

traffic.   Articulated trucks were selected because they are not as wide as rigid frame mining 

trucks and can therefore operate on narrower haulage ramps, which minimizes waste 

stripping.  At Hudbay's request the design also includes an 11m wide 12% gradient service 

road in the north wall to provide long term access to the 150m elevation pit bottom in the 

Pinwheel area.  The overall pit bottom is located at the 54m elevation for a total pit depth of 

about 170m. 

 

Rock pit slope angles utilized in the design are summarized in Table 16.8.  Berm widths and 

the vertical intervals between berms were adjusted slightly versus geotechnical criteria in 

order to suit the 6m high mining benches proposed in this study.  The resulting inter-ramp 

slopes shown in Table 16.8 vary by 1 or 2 degrees versus the geotechnical criteria presented 

in Section 16.2.  Overburden inter-ramp slopes of 25 degrees were utilized.  The design 

includes an 8m catch-berm at the contact between overburden and rock.

The design utilizes inter-ramp slope angles in weathered rock and overburden, rather than a 

detailed configuration incorporating benches and berms.  This approximation is considered 

adequate for this preliminary economic assessment and is not expected to materially impact 

pit quantity estimates.

16.9 Pit Quantities 
 

16.9.1 Dilution and Mining Loss 
 

The selective mining unit is considered to be an entire 8x8x6m resource block.   Based on 

external dilution estimated at 0.8m per contact with waste, and a preliminary analysis of the 

number of above cut-off value blocks in contact with waste blocks, external dilution is 

estimated to equate to 5% for flotation met types and 8% for leach met types.  Mining losses 

resulting from misdirected truckloads and excessive dilution in areas during excavation is 

estimated at -3.5%. 

 

Combining all mineralization and barren waste within each block also introduces some 

internal dilution.  Comparing in situ resource estimates with final ROM quantities indicates 

that overall total dilution (i.e. internal plus external) averages 9%.  An analysis of contained 

metal and total NSR indicates that combining all mineralization and barren waste within each 

block also introduces mining losses, since it results in some block NSRs falling below the 

cut-off-value.  The overall total mining loss is estimated at -6%. 

 

The leach metallurgical type mineralization subset was analysed separately.  The leach 

metallurgical type mineralized zones are generally narrow in width and located adjacent to 

barren rock, so incur higher dilution and mining losses versus flotation metallurgical type 

zones.  It is estimated that total dilution (internal and external) and mining loss for leach 

metallurgical type mineralization is 13% and -10%, respectively.   

 

Designating the metallurgical type of the entire block based on the majority of the 

mineralization in the block results in some intermixing of in situ mineralization, particularly in 

the Pinwheel Gossan area.  It is estimated that roughly 13% of in situ pinwheel gossan 

mineralization is located in blocks containing principally PWCu and is therefore mined as 

PWCu.  Similarly some PWCu mineralization is included in principally PWG blocks, and is 

therefore mined with PWG.  If PWG mineralization can be mined with more selectivity than 

on an entire block basis this would increase PWG gold head grades.  The intermixing issue 

does not arise with the East Gossan deposit, since this tabular deposit was treated as an 

exception to whole block mining, and is mined as a separate zone. 

 

16.9.2 Ultimate Pit Quantities 
 

Ultimate pit quantities are summarized in Table 16.9.  The portion of the measured mineral 

resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources used for evaluation 

purposes in the PEA is shown in Table 16.9, after applying allowances for dilution and 

mining losses and utilizing the NSR cut-off values presented in Section 16.6, i.e. $25/t NSR 

value for flotation metallurgical types and $39/t NSR value for leach metallurgical types.

The contained quantities in Table 16.9 were reconciled to the resource statement.  The 

designed pit is considerably smaller than the conceptual pit shell utilized to define open pit 

mineral resources and contains about 55% of total open pit measured, indicated and inferred 

mineral resources.  Only about 75% of the resources within the designed pit limits contribute 

to the in-pit resource estimates in Table 16.9, because the updated NSR and cut-off value

 This preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would 

enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary 
economic assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability.

described in Section 16.5 and 16.6 result in the exclusion of lower grade resources from the 

in-pit resource quantities.  These lower grade resources are included with the 23.3 million 

tonnes pit waste rock quantity estimate in Table 16.9. 

 

SRK cautions that mineral resource quantities in Table 16.9 cannot be considered Mineral 

Reserves, since the quantities are based on a conceptual study and include inferred mineral 

resources.  Mineral Reserves must be based on at least a prefeasibility study as defined in 

NI 43-101 and cannot include inferred mineral resources.  There is no guarantee that further 

exploration will upgrade any of the inferred mineral resources to the measured or indicated 

category.   

 

16.10 Production Schedule 
 

16.10.1 Pit Production 
 

An annual production schedule was generated with the objective of meeting a target total 

processing rate (i.e. flotation feed plus leach feed) of approximately 3,000 tonnes per day.  

The life of mine pit production schedule is summarized in Table 16.10 based on mining 

activities commencing in 2014. 

 

The production schedule is based on mining the ultimate pit bench-by-bench without phases 

or subdivisions.  Preproduction stripping is required in 2014 in order to prepare the pit for 

sustained plant feed, followed by seven full years of operation.  In general only about two 

benches are mined annually in the first four years of operation.  This increases to six 

benches annually in the latter three years of the schedule, which equates to a maximum pit 

sinking rate of 36m per year.  The maximum mining rate is about 14,000tpd over a five year 

period 2016 to 2020. 

 

Table 16.10 Pit Production Schedule Summary 

 
 

Pit ROM production by metallurgical type is summarized in Table 16.11, which shows that 

the majority of 2015 pit production is leach metallurgical type ROM.  Large quantities of 

flotation met type ROM are mined starting in 2016.

16.10.2 Process Plant Feed 
 

The plant feed schedule is summarized in Table 16.12.  Based on available feed from the pit, 

leach plant processing begins in 2015 and flotation plant processing begins in 2016. The 

feed schedule shows maximum leach processing at 220kt/year (about 600 tonnes per day) 

and a maximum flotation processing at 900kt/year (i.e. 2500 tonnes per day).  The majority 

of leach metallurgical type ROM is located at higher elevations in the open pit and is mined 

and processed over the first six years of operation.  Flotation feed continues until 2023, 

utilizing ROM rehandled from stockpile in the final year (after the pit is depleted).

16.11 Mine Operation 
 

16.11.1 General 
 

Mine operation is based on mining by the owner's workforce.  Contractor mining was not 

assessed for this study.  The operating schedule is assumed to be 24 hours per day, 360 

days per year, with four crews working 12-hour shifts on a 4-day-on 4-day-off rotation.  

During 2014 and the final two years of the operation two 8-hour shift per day operation is 

proposed, due to the lower mining rates.

16.11.2 Drilling and Blasting 
 

Based on the selected bench height of 6m and a 127mm (5") blasthole diameter, a drill 

pattern of 3.5m burden by 4.0m spacing by 7m hole depth was selected for both in-pit 

resources and waste rock.  Drill cuttings will be sampled and assayed, for grade control 

purposes.  It is anticipated that rock blasting will utilize emulsion explosives, at a powder of 

0.30kg/t.  Overburden will not require drilling or blasting.   

 

It is estimated that a two unit drill fleet will meet anticipated drilling requirements.  The 

selected Down-The-Hole (DTH) drill is capable of drilling 110 to 203mm holes so blasthole 

diameters could be adjusted during the mining operation if required. 

 

It is recommended that future Back Forty engineering studies include analysis of drilling and 

basting parameters and their effect on blast clearance for the operation.  It may be 

necessary to adjust the blasthole diameter, drill pattern burden and spacing, and the 

explosives charger per hole in order to minimize fly rock and blast clearance distances. 

 

16.11.3 Loading 
 

A 6.0m
3
 Front End Loader (FEL) and a 4.65m

3
 backhoe excavator are proposed for the pit 

loading function.  Both loading units can be utilized for ROM and waste excavation.  A 

second smaller FEL with a bucket capacity of 4.0m
3 

is required at the crusher as a tramming 

loader, to reclaim the crusher ROM stockpile.  

 
16.11.4 Hauling 

 
The selected hauling units are articulated dump trucks with a nominal capacity of about 40 

tons.  The selected trucks and the loading units are considered a good match in terms of the 

number of bucket passes per truck load.  

 

The process plant location and the waste dump layout are illustrated in Figure 18.1.  Haul 

distances to the crusher and waste dump range from 1km in 2014, to 2km for ROM 

resources and 3km for waste in 2021.  The uphill portion of the haulage profiles gradually 

increases due to an increasing pit depth and a higher waste dump, which necessitates 

haulage fleet additions over the mine life.   

 

A seven unit haulage fleet is proposed.  The 2019 truck fleet size was calculated at eight 

units, due to the long haul distances and high strip ratio.  It is envisaged that the production 

schedule could likely be adjusted with further mine planning and the number of trucks 

smoothened to seven units.  Other available options include either leasing a truck for a year 

or purchasing a used truck.

16.11.5 Support 
 

Production support equipment includes: 

• Two tracked bulldozers, 410hp power 

• One grader, 14 foot blade 

• One watercart: 20,000L capacity 

• One service truck 

 

Other smaller auxiliary equipment units, such as pickup trucks, light towers, dewatering 

pumps, etc, will also be required. 

 
16.11.6 Pit Equipment Fleet 

 
Pit production equipment acquisitions over the mine life are summarized in Table 16.13.  The 

table is based on acquiring units in the year previous to when they are needed for service.  

An exception is equipment needed for 2014 preproduction stripping, which is assumed 

acquired early in 2014.  Equipment acquisitions in 2014 therefore include units required for 

operation in either 2014 or 2015.

16.11.8 Mine Capital and Operating Costs Estimates 
 

Estimated pit equipment capital costs are summarized in Table 16.15.  "Production 

Equipment" capital is based on the acquisitions shown in Table 16.13 including allowances 

for spare buckets and overhaul of the smaller units.  The unit costs utilized are based on 

information obtained from industry cost reference guides and reference to other projects.  

"Other Pit Equipment" capital cost is estimated at approximately 8% of production equipment 

capital, based on reference to other projects.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS  
 

17.1 Introduction 

The two types of mineralization (gold and silver bearing oxide material, and sulfide material 

containing copper and zinc), will be hauled from the mine to the processing area.  The first 

stage of processing will be crushing, and both mineralized types will be fed independently 

through the same crushing system and stored in separate stockpiles. 

 

The gold bearing oxide material will be fed from its stockpile to the oxide leach plant, where it 

will be ground, leached with a cyanide solution to dissolve the gold and silver and washed 

via a series of counter current decantation thickeners.  The gold and silver will be recovered 

from the solution with zinc powder then refined into a crude alloy called dore.  The solid 

residue from leaching will be treated to destroy residual cyanide, dewatered and disposed in 

a tailings management facility. 

 

The sulfide material will be ground and treated by froth flotation to produce a copper mineral 

concentrate and a zinc mineral concentrate.  The concentrates will be filtered to remove 

water and loaded into bulk bags (super sacks) for shipment to smelters.  The tailings will be 

dewatered and disposed in a tailings management facility. 

 

17.2 Crushing 

The run of mine mineralized oxide and sulfide material will be transported by haul trucks to a 

stockpile receiving area.  In the receiving area the material will either be dumped directly into 

the primary crusher feed hopper or onto separate stockpiles, by mineralization type, for 

blending (oxide with oxide, sulfide with sulfide).  Each mineralization type dumped in the 

stock piles is independently fed with a front end loader into the three-stage crushing circuit 

and crushed to less than 9.5mm.  The fine material products will be stored on separate 

dedicated reclaim stockpiles. 

  

17.3 Oxide Processing Plant 

The oxide material, containing gold and silver, will be processed in an agitated cyanide 

leach.  The resulting leach solution, containing the dissolved gold and silver, is washed from 

the tailings in a counter-current decantation (CCD) system.  A Merrill Crowe process then 

removes the gold and silver using zinc precipitation and the resulting concentrate is refined 

in a tilt-pour furnace to produce a gold-silver alloy dore product. 

 

The oxide plant has a capacity to leach about 234,000 tonnes of oxide material per year 

during full production with an average annual production of 17,000 troy ounces gold and 

145,000 troy ounces silver per year.

The crushed oxide material will be conveyed to the oxide plant where the material will be 

ground, in water, in a 750 HP ball mill.  The ball mill will operate in closed circuit with hydro-

cyclone classifiers to produce a final product size of 80% passing 105 microns (150 mesh).  

Milk-of-lime is added to the mill feed to maintain the slurry at an alkaline pH.  

 

Referring to Figure 17.1, an overall oxide plant flow sheet, gold and silver are first dissolved 

from the material by the cyanide leach process.  The precious metal bearing solution 

(pregnant liquor) is separated from the solid residue by CCD washing.  The gold and silver 

are recovered from the pregnant solution by zinc dust precipitation in a Merrill-Crowe plant 

and dore is produced by high temperature refining.   

 

The hydro-cyclone overflow (fine ground product) flows into an air-sparged pre-leach 

aeration tank to oxidize residual sulfide minerals that would otherwise consume cyanide.  

The pre-leach tank is sized for a four hour slurry residence time.  The slurry overflows the 

pre-leach tank into the agitated leach circuit.  In the leach circuit, the slurry flows through five 

leach tanks in series with a total slurry residence time of 36 hours.  Cyanide solution is 

added to the leach tanks at a rate sufficient to produce and maintain a 1 gram per litre 

concentration in the slurry in order to dissolve the gold and silver.  Milk-of-lime is added to 

the pre-leach and the leach to maintain high pH conditions for the leaching process. 

 

Metallurgical test work results demonstrated that a gold recovery of 88% and a silver 

recovery of 65% can be achieved from the oxide material.  The precious metal laden cyanide 

solution (pregnant solution) is separated from the slurry by a four-stage thickener system that 

is operated with a counter-current wash system.  The pregnant liquor overflow from the wash 

system goes to the Merrill-Crowe process. 

 

In the Merrill-Crowe system pregnant solution is prepared for zinc precipitation by 

clarification and de-aeration.  In the proposed plant the relatively coarse solids are removed 

with a device called a "pinned bed" clarifier this is followed by polishing in a pressure 

clarifying filter to remove the micron size material.  Oxygen is removed from the clarified 

solution in a vacuum de-aeration tower. 

 

Gold and silver are then precipitated from the clarified, de-aerated pregnant solution with 

powdered zinc that is slurried with barren solution.  The zinc slurry is mixed with the pregnant 

solution by gravity feeding the zinc into the inlet of the precipitation filter feed pump.  This 

pump feeds the zinc precipitate to a filter press that has been pre-coated with diatomaceous 

earth (DE).  Filtrate (barren solution) is recycled to the counter-current wash circuit for use as 

process water and for mixing with the powdered zinc, as described above. 

 

The resulting filter cake, a mixture of gold, silver, zinc and DE, is dried in a vacuum assisted 

electric mercury retort that evaporates water and any mercury contained within the cake.  

The mercury is condensed and sold or properly disposed.  The mercury-free material is then

smelted in a propane-fired furnace and cast into a gold-silver dore.  Smelting furnace slag 

will be recycled within the gold room area.  

 

Residual cyanide in the CCD wash circuit underflow slurry and in the sludge from the 

clarifying filters (tailings) will be destroyed in an oxidation circuit.  The slurry will flow through 

two cascading agitated, aerated tanks and will be mixed with sodium meta-bisulfite to cause 

the oxidation.  The sodium meta-bisulfite will be metered into the tanks from a hopper/screw 

feeder assembly.  The detoxification process has a two-hour retention time to insure 

complete cyanide destruction. 

 

The detoxified tailings slurry will then be combined with the tailings from the sulfide plant.  

The combined tailings will flow to a thickener to recover water for treatment and use in the 

processing plants.  The combined thickener underflow will be pumped to a tailings treatment 

plant for further processing and placed in a waste management facility. 

 

A water consumption estimate has been prepared for the oxide processing facility.  These 

estimates are based upon processing 28.8 tonnes/hour of oxide material and are 

summarized in Table 17.1 below.

17.4 Sulfide Processing Plant  

The sulfide processing plant will produce copper and zinc concentrates via selective flotation 

of the individual minerals from the sulfide material.  The copper concentrate will contain gold 

and silver credits while zinc concentrate will include lead.  However, no lead credits are 

expected. 

 

The sulfide plant will process approximately 900,000 tonnes annually resulting in an average 

production of 11,000 tonnes of copper concentrate and 43,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate. 

 

Crushed sulfide material will be conveyed to the sulfide plant where the material will be 

ground in a 2,750 HP ball mill. The ball mill will operate in closed circuit with hydro-cyclone 

classifiers to produce a final product size of 80% passing 53 microns (270 mesh). 

 

Copper and zinc minerals are recovered in sequential flotation circuits as shown in Figure 

17.2.  The primary copper flotation circuit consists of a single conditioning tank, a rougher 

flotation cell bank (flotation cell sizes: 10m
3
 x 6), and a scavenger flotation cell bank (10m

3
 x 

3).  The rougher and scavenger concentrates will be thickened and reground in a stirred 

media detritor.  Rougher and scavenger concentrates plus the second cleaner tailings are 

ground in the stirred media detritor to produce a product size of 80% passing 30 microns 

before cleaner flotation.  The reground copper concentrate will be cleaned in three stages of 

smaller flotation cells (3m
3
 x 5; 3m

3
 x 2; 3m

3
 x 1).  Lime is added to maintain a pH of 10.5 in 

the stirred media detritor.  The primary copper collector is Aerophine 3418A to enhance gold 

recovery and Methyl Iso-Butyl Carbinol (MIBC) will be used as a frother. 

 

Tailings from the copper circuit are thickened to recover water for reuse in the ball mill 

grinding circuit.  The thickened copper tailings are fed to the zinc flotation circuit.  The 

thickened copper tailings are pumped to the first of two conditioner tanks at the head of the 

zinc circuit and are diluted with water recovered from the downstream zinc tailings thickener.  

Copper sulfate is added to the slurry to activate the zinc sulfide mineral (sphalerite) and 

make it available for flotation.  Sodium Iso-propyl Xanthate (SIPX) is used as the collector for 

the zinc minerals and MIBC is used as the frother.  

 

The primary zinc circuit consists of a rougher flotation cell bank (flotation cell sizes: 10m
3
 x 

6), and a scavenger flotation cell bank (10m
3
 x 3).  The rougher and scavenger concentrates 

will be thickened before being reground in a stirred media detritor.  Rougher and scavenger 

concentrates plus the second cleaner tailings are sent to the stirred media detritor for 

regrinding to produce a product size of 80% passing 30 microns before cleaner flotation.  

The reground zinc concentrate will be cleaned in three stages of smaller flotation cells (3m
3
 x 

6; 3m
3
 x 5; 3m

3
 x 4).  Additional lime is added to the stirred media detritor to increase the pH 

to 11.5.

Target concentrate grades are 30% copper (nearly pure chalcopyrite the primary copper 

mineral) and 52% zinc, respectively.  Both concentrates are dewatered with high capacity 

thickeners and filter presses.  Concentrate filter cakes will be loaded into bulk bags (super 

sacks) for transportation to smelters. 

 

Final tailing material from the flotation circuit will be combined with the detoxified tailing 

material from the oxide gold leaching plant and thickened to 55% solids in a high capacity 

thickener.  The thickened solids slurry will be pumped to the tailings treatment facility for 

further processing.  The processed tailings solids will be transferred to a tailing storage 

facility for final disposal. 

 

A water consumption estimate has been prepared for the sulfide plant.  These estimates are 

based upon processing 110.8 tonnes/hour of sulfide material and are summarized in Table 

17.3.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The infrastructure and logistic requirements for the Back Forty project for the on-site and off-

site activities are discussed in this section.  The proposed surface site plan for the Back 

Forty project is shown in Figure 18.1. 

 

18.1 Plant Site Layout and Infrastructure 

The offices and mine facilities will include the mine/processing complex which includes 

mineralized storage areas, crushers, conveyors, milling equipment, tailings thickener, oxide 

plant, sulfide plant, and a reagent building.  Other structures include a laboratory, mine 

offices, warehouse, employee locker rooms, first aid station, fueling stations, truck wash, and 

various tanks to contain fuels and chemicals.  The areas in and around these facilities will be 

surfaced with an impermeable surface. 

 

A general arrangement plan of the processing facilities is shown in Figure 18.2.  The figure 

illustrates the spatial relationships among the mineralized material receiving and crushing 

areas, the oxide plant, the sulfide plant and other supportive building locations. 

 

Due to the winter climate at the project site, all the process facilities will be located indoors.  

Enclosed buildings will be necessary for most mineralized material processing areas.  The 

copper and zinc tailings thickeners will be located outside due to their large diameters.   

 

18.1.1 Crushing 
 

The 3-stage crushing plant is situated on the east side of the mill site inside an approximate 

18m x 50m building (900m
2
).  The crushed oxide and sulfide mineralized material are 

transported and stored in their designated covered stockpiles using a radial stacking 

conveyor.  Each mineralized type then flows from its stockpile via apron feeders and belt 

conveyors to its designated grinding circuit. 

 

18.1.2 Oxide Plant Building 
 

The oxide plant equipment layout plan is shown in Figure 18.3.  All the equipment necessary 

to process the oxide material is located within an approximate 30.5m x 91.5m building 

(2,790m
2
 floor area).  The Oxide plant layout plan is shown in Figure 18.3.  The grinding, 

leach, CCD and tailings detoxification circuits occupy the east and center part of the building.  

The Merrill Crowe gold recovery and the gold refinery process equipment are located 

towards the west end.  The building will be an insulated, metal-clad, structural steel building 

with a pitched roof and continuous ridge vent.  The floor will be constructed on a slab-on-

grade with concrete foundation footings for structural steel supports.  The floor will have 

suitable surface coating and curbs for spill containment.

18.1.12 Fresh Water Supply System 
 

The fresh water sell pumps, each having a capacity of 125m
3
/h, will be capable of providing 

the make-up plant water demand under unfavorable reclaimed water conditions when the 

water treatment plant is not operating.  Under these conditions, the raw water demand could 

reach 125m
3
/h. 

 

The fresh water well supply pumps will be used to keep a 610m
3
 capacity fresh water/fire 

water supply tank filled.  Two fresh water supply pumps, one operating and the other on 

stand-by mode, will provide raw water to the following tanks: 

 

• a 390m
3
 capacity reclaim water supply tank where fresh make-up water is added to 

the water received from the water treatment plant and the combined water is used as 

the plant process water supply, 

• a 38m
3
 capacity domestic water supply tank, and 

• a 1.9m
3
 capacity seal water storage tank.  

 

The fresh water pumps draw the water from the upper portion of the fresh water/fire water 

supply tank in order to reserve the lower portion of the tank for firewater storage.  

 

18.1.13 Domestic Water Supply 
 

As the domestic water tank is filled from the raw water supply, the water feed to the tank is 

chlorinated using a sodium hypochlorite dosing system.  The resulting potable water is 

pumped throughout the plant for use in all safety-showers, eye wash stations, the change 

house, restroom facilities and drinking fountains. 

 

Raw and potable water piping in the plant area will either be buried below the frost line, 

routed through heated buildings or heat traced and insulated.  Manual drain points will be 

included to allow emptying of pipelines should conditions dictate.

18.1.14 Process Water System 
 

Two, one operating and one standby, reclaimed water supply pumps will pump the process 

water throughout the oxide and sulfide plant buildings for use in the grinding, flotation and 

reagent make-up areas of the facility.   

 

Process water piping in the plant area will be routed through heated buildings and provided 

with manual drain points to allow emptying of pipelines should conditions dictate. 

 

18.2 Cut-off Wall Geotechnical Investigation 

A geotechnical investigation was completed in November 2011 by Golder Associates Ltd. to 

assess the cut-off wall construction alternatives for the project.  The proposed open pit is 

bounded to the west by the Menominee River.  The geotechnical evaluation was completed 

to design a seepage cut-off wall to be installed between the proposed open pit and the 

adjacent Menominee River.  The cut-off wall will reduce seepage loss from the Menominee 

River to the open pit and improve the stability of the pit slope. 

 

Five boreholes were drilled to investigate the subsurface geotechnical and hydrogeological 

conditions along the proposed cut-off wall alignments.  The geotechnical conditions 

encountered underlying the proposed alignment were overburden soil overlying the 

weathered zone of bedrock.  Fresh bedrock was encountered below the weathered zone in 

one of the boreholes drilled. 

 

Based on the conditions encountered during the field investigation and seepage analysis 

completed, four construction alternatives were presented (conventional long-reach 

excavation, clamshell excavation, cutter soil mixing, and trench cutter) for evaluation.  Any of 

the four selected alternatives would provide a technically viable solution but the trench cutter 

and cutter soil mixing options were deemed to be the best alternatives to move forward with 

during the final design stage. 

 

18.3 Tailings and Waste Rock Management Facility 

Mine waste with acid rock drainage (ARD) characteristics must be stored in a properly 

designed facility.  The State of Michigan has specific requirements of acceptable methods of 

mine waste management (Part 632 of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 

Act No. 451 of 1994 as amended (Part 632)).  The rules addressing treatment and 

containment of materials, including waste rock and tailings, are contained in R425.409.  

Geochemical studies completed on the waste rock and sulfide mineralization confirm that the 

material does contain ARD characteristics and it will need to be managed appropriately 

through an engineered facility.

The present design proposes a 115 acre co-disposal facility for both tailings and waste rock.  

Figure 18.5 shows the final co-disposal design after mining and milling and prior to site 

reclamation.  The main features of the new tailings and waste rock management facility 

(TWRMF) will include the following: 

 

• The volume of tailings and waste rock to be contained is approximately 17.1 million 

cubic meters.  This includes a 15% contingency and assumes no co-mingling of 

tailings into waste rock voids. 

• A 3:1 (horizontal:vertical) interior and exterior embankment slopes 

• A composite liner consisting of a GCL and a 60 mil HDPE liner 

• Base leachate collection system designed at a 0.5% slope with a maximum drainage 

distance between the pipe of approximately 45m.  The liner slopes at a minimum of 

2% to the leachate collection system trenches. 

• A sideslope drainage layer 

• The exterior slope is 3.5:1 on the north and northwest west slopes and 2:1 on all 

other slopes. 

• The elevation of the liner is designed to provide separation from the groundwater 

table. 

• The liner construction is separated into three major phases with two leachate 

extraction sumps. 

• The total earthwork required to prepare the site to sub base (bottom of 0.3m select 

soil) grades is 841,000m
3
 of cut (in-place) and 550,000m

3
 of fill (in-place). 

• A 3.05m setback has been maintained from regulated wetlands (with the exception of 

the haul road crossing). 

 

Upon completion of mining activities final reclamation of the TWRMF will commence.  A 

mixture of ARD generating tails and waste rock material will be backfilled via heavy haul 

trucks into the open pit.  The remaining tails and waste rock within the TWRMF will be re-

graded to achieve the final desired reclamation slopes.  A cap will then be placed over the 

TWRMF that consists of a GCL and 60 ml HDPE liner. 

 

18.4 Ore and Tailings Pipelines 

The oxide and sulfide mineralization is trucked from the open pit mine by haul trucks which 

will deposit the material in a stockpile area for processing.  The waste rock will be trucked 

from the open pit to the TWRMF for permanent disposal.  Tailings will be pumped from the 

tailings thickener located by the mill via a pipeline for storage in the TWRMF.  Once open pit 

mining is completed,a mixture of tailings and waste rock ARD generating material will be 

trucked into the open pit for final reclamation.  Mixture of tailings and waste rock will be 

amended with limestone and placed back in the open pit for final reclamation.

18.5 Electrical Power System 

The preliminary power source and routing of the overland power transmission line is based 

on discussions with M. J. Electric LLC of Iron Mountain, Michigan in which they stated there 

is an existing substation located south of Rosebush Lake near the intersection of North River 

Road and River Road (approx. UTM coordinate 437344. m E, 5036494. m N).  An existing 

138kV transmission line runs east out of the substation for about 1.3km (approx. UTM 

coordinate 438650. m E, 5036499. m N) then turns southeast towards Lake Mary parallel to 

route 356.  At a distance approximately 2.32km (approx. UTM coordinate 439998. m E, 

5034608. m N) a new power transmission line take off servicing the mill complex will be 

connected running in a southwest direction for about 4.46km (approx. UTM coordinate 

435990. m E, 5032700. m N) at which point it turns west for about 0.8km (approx. UTM 

coordinate 435180. m E, 5032700. m N) terminating near a new substation for service to the 

mill complex. 

 

Medium voltage power is available from the new power substation located at the southeast 

corner of the Project.  The proposed substation will provide the plant facility with 13.8kV 

distribution voltage from the incoming138kV overhead power transmission line. 

 

Two 13.8kV overhead distribution lines running northeast and west will service the on-site 

project infrastructure.  The northeast bound overhead line will travel directly to the crushing 

building and then continue along the edge of the truck turn around road in order to reach the 

truck shop and the fuel station.  The west bound overhead line will travel to the sulfide plant 

and continue between the plant and the maintenance shop and administrative office, 

providing power to each building.  At the change facility it will split into two overhead 

distribution lines, one heading west and one heading north.  The west bound line will provide 

power to the warehouse, truck scale and terminate at the security and first aid station.  The 

northbound line will provide power to the laboratory and travel around the north side of the 

oxide plant where it will terminate at the proposed distribution transformer. 

 

18.6 Access and Site Roads 

The joint venture has had existing agreements with surface land holders with respect to the 

right to access in respect to the undertaking of all types of exploration, development, and 

mining on the concessions. 

 

The majority of the road from the local community of Stephenson to the project site in Lake 

Township has been upgraded from its present state and is suitable for semi-trailer traffic.  

The improvement of existing near and on-site roads and construction of new haulage roads 

will also be required.

______________________________________________________________________________________   

 

April 2012 Page 160  
 

A haul road between the processing facility, mine pit, and the tailings and waste rock 

management facility will also be installed.  The road is currently proposed to be a 17m wide 

corridor with a maximum 8% slope.  The haul road and associated contact water collection 

system will have an impermeable surface which will be treated with water or a dust 

suppressant to mitigate dust from mine traffic. 

 

18.6.1 East Access Road Project 
 

All plant, equipment, operating supplies and finished product will be transported to the Back 

Forty project by road to and from the Lake Township site.  The site is well serviced by a 

number of classified roadways including US Highway 41, hard surfaced county roads and 

secondary town roads.  The local roadways currently provide immediate access to the 

project site but only the county system will be considered to provide routine material haulage 

access.  Of these roadways, only a portion are graded as all-season access allowing year-

around normal gross axle loading in the spring. There are no known bridge weight 

limitations. 

 

Due to current public use patterns, township roadways in the vicinity of the proposed mine 

site are not being considered at this time to service the primary requirements for material and 

employee access.  In order to effectively bypass much of the Lake Township system, we are 

proposing a plant-site road plan which includes 6,200m of new access road through State 

and Back Forty owned land northeast of the mine site. 

  

The estimated cost for the east access road construction initiative is $3,000,000.  We are 

presently applying for a state easement across land east of the deposit for the east access 

road and plant site power line.  The project will be classified as a public roadway conditional 

on requirements of the state easement.  It is proposed that the east access road and 

associated plant power line easements will share the same right-of-way.  Drainage ditches 

and culverts will be placed in accordance with the site drainage requirements. 

 

18.6.2 River Road Relocation Project 
 

Due to the fact that the western part of the Back Forty deposit underlies the current River 

Road right-of-way, there will be a requirement for open pit by-pass road construction for 

670m.  The bypass will consist of road relocation construction between the western wall of 

the proposed pit excavation and the Menominee River. 

 

After discussions with the County Road Commission, Lake Township and the community, 

indications are that the proposed direct bypass was recommended as the most preferable 

alternative.  

 

The estimated cost for the bypass road construction project is $800,000.  The road will be 

engineered and configured according to County requirements and standards.  Appropriate

sound and visual screening will be provided between the pit excavation and the newly-

established right-of-way. 

 

After reclamation, the River Road right-of-way will be returned to its current configuration.   

 

18.6.3 Proposal for a County Upgrade of Swanson Road County Route 356 
 

Our environmental impact assessment results indicate that mitigation of potential traffic and 

road use issues associated with the proposed mining operation be fully considered.  A 

proposed east access road will provide access to the mine site from County Route 356 near 

the southern border of Holmes Township.  A request will be made to the County to upgrade 

the approximately 8km distance of Swanson Road and County Route 356 to full non-

seasonal status so there will be no truck load limitations during the spring "break-up" period.  

This is the only remaining road section to Daggett and Route 41 that has seasonal status.  

The current seasonal load limitations on the Holmes Township section of this road (65% of 

the 75,000kg GVW limit) is inadequate to service the 24 hour / 7 day per week / 365 day per 

year schedule anticipated for the proposed mining operation. 

 

The Menominee County Road Commission was made aware of our need for the proposed 

road upgrade.  The estimated cost to the county is predicated on further investigative drilling 

of the roadbed material. 

 

18.7 Railroad Siding 

The activity on the Canadian National (CN) rail system in the area is robust and the track is 

in excellent condition.  The CN line is approximately 13km from the site.  Zinc and copper 

concentrate products from the project can be railed originating at Daggett, MI with a 

connection along the CN system through Escanaba, MI to Sault Ste. Marie, ON and 

eastward.  The Canadian National system provides rail access to major copper and zinc 

smelters in Canada.  

  

Opposing track main line tie-in switches on the main CN line will be installed for the 

concentrate load-out siding.  A requirement for 3,200m of CN controlled and Back Forty 

owned parallel tracks will be installed.  There will be a proposed concentrate load-out 

building that will facilitate super sack packaged zinc and copper concentrate product.  The 

proposed siding will handle 15 to 20 gondola or boxcar rail cars per week.  The budgeted 

amount for this facility is $4,450,000.  The Michigan DOT Economic Program may provide a 

grant and/or loan for expansion of these rail service facilities. 

 

18.8 Water Supply 

It is assumed that fresh water for use on the site will be obtained from wells to be drilled on 

the property.  Further work to determine potential water well locations will be undertaken. 



Back Forty Deposit 
Preliminary Economic Assessment 

 
 
 

 

______________________________________________________________________________________   

 

April 2012 Page 162  
 

Process water will be recycled to the extent possible and mine water will be pumped to the 

mill to supplement the water needs.  Water may also be taken from wells for the process 

water requirements. 

 

A positive water balance should be attainable.  A waste water treatment plant has been 

included in the estimate to treat excess water prior to release to the environment. 

 

18.9 Ports and Shipping 

The Back Forty project site is located on the western shore of the Menominee River 

approximately 64km northwest of the Port of Menominee and 86km southwest of the Port of 

Escanaba.  The site is currently accessible during the summer months by water and air. 

During construction, operation and reclamation activities supplies, equipment, bulk materials 

and concentrate shipped to the Port of Montreal could be transported by ship or barge.  

Over-size and heavy pre-fabricated plant and camp sub-assemblies will be carried in special 

transport ships.  

 

The CN rail line corridor passes through both Ports and logistics firms are present at both 

sites and can respond at every point of transport.  There are warehousing, stevedoring, 

trucking and shipping services and infrastructure available at both locations.  It may be 

feasible to utilize these services and forgo the capital cost of our own rail-siding trans-loading 

facility.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 

19.1 Market Studies 

The projected copper concentrates with high amounts of gold and silver would be desirable 

by smelters due to the enriched gold and silver amounts.  Penalty charges for zinc and lead 

in the copper concentrates were applied based on agreements that Hudbay has with 

smelters.  Zinc concentrates with a grade of 52% zinc are expected to be sold to smelters at 

normal industry market terms and a small mercury penalty was assumed.  

 

The Back Forty project plans to negotiate contracts with refineries for the sale of the gold-

silver dore.  Negotiations are contemplated for the sale of concentrates to be produced from 

the future phases of the project.  Current assumptions for dore are typical of, and consistent 

with, standard industry practice.  The expected contracts for the supply of copper and zinc 

concentrates are expected to be in line with industry norm.  

 

The metal prices used in the economic analysis were supplied by Aquila and are based on a 

three year historic average. 

 

The author has reviewed the metal treatment charges, payable amounts and commodity 

price projections by Hudbay and the results support the assumptions used in this technical 

report.  

 

19.2 Contracts 

There are currently no contracts related to the mining, processing, or handling of product 

sales from the project. This is normal for a project at this stage.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, AND 
SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 
Hudbay and Aquila have completed and are in the process of completing a broad range of 

environmental and related engineering studies to meet regulatory requirements and protect 

the surrounding environment.  This section describes the studies that are being completed 

and the permitting requirements for the project.   

 

20.1 Baseline Environmental and Related Engineering Studies 

Environmental baseline studies were initiated in 2007.  To date the following baseline and 

engineering studies have been completed or are currently underway. 

 

20.1.1 Geologic and Related Geotechnical Studies 
 

To date the project has completed four different, yet related, geologic and geotechnical field 

programs.  These programs include: 

 

1. Exploration drilling to characterize economic mineralization and geology; 

2. Subsurface geotechnical drilling in the vicinity of proposed mine infrastructure; 

3. Geotechnical drilling in the vicinity of the proposed mine development to complete 

the pit wall stability analysis; and 

4. Geotechnical drilling in the vicinity of proposed mine development to aid in the design 

of a low permeability barrier wall between the open pit mine and adjacent 

Menominee River. 

 

20.1.2 Groundwater and Surface Water Hydrology 
 

Starting in 2008, the project commissioned a study to characterize regional groundwater and 

surface water conditions.  Numerous groundwater monitoring wells were installed as part of 

the study.  The monitoring wells were sampled on a quarterly basis for a period of two years 

to document baseline groundwater flow patterns and groundwater quality.  Tests were 

completed to document the hydraulic characteristics of the various hydrostratigraphic units 

pertinent to mine development. 

 

Concurrent with the regional groundwater study, the project commissioned a regional 

hydrology study to characterize surface water conditions in surrounding rivers and lakes.  

Surface water monitoring stations were established and monitored for a period of two years 

to document baseline surface water chemistry and flow conditions in the vicinity of the 

project site.

______________________________________________________________________________________   

 

April 2012 Page 165  
 

More recently, the project completed detailed field programs to characterize and document 

hydraulic characteristics of the Precambrian bedrock in a localized area around the proposed 

mine.  This work was completed in mid-2011. 

 

The project is currently in the process of synthesizing site characterization data into a 

numerical groundwater flow model for use in mine planning and environmental impacts 

analysis. 

 

20.1.3 Geochemical Characterization of Waste Rock and Tailings 
 

In 2009, a detailed study was commissioned on the geochemistry of the waste rock and 

tailings that will be generated from the operation.  The project has followed industry 

standards related to the characterization of the waste streams to assess the potential for acid 

rock drainage and metals leaching from the waste materials that will be generated.  Static 

testing programs have been completed.  Kinetic testing has been ongoing for over 18 

months.  Mineralogical testing has been completed.  Data from these studies are being used 

to aid in the development of engineering plans for the tailings and waste rock storage 

facilities and reclamation plans for the project. 

 

20.1.4 Wetlands 
 

Wetland studies have been completed to document baseline wetland conditions.  Wetland 

boundaries have been delineated and reviewed with regulatory personnel.  Wetland 

biologists have surveyed wetlands to document baseline habitat.  Wetland hydrology has 

been characterized through the installation of hydrologic monitoring equipment. 

 

20.1.5 Aquatic Biology, Vegetation, and Wildlife 
 

The project commissioned in 2007 with baseline studies to document the aquatic biology in 

regional water ways.  The completed field studies documented baseline aquatic vegetation, 

fisheries, and macro invertebrates.  Concurrent with the aquatic biological studies, the 

project commissioned in 2007 documented baseline vegetative and wildlife conditions in the 

vicinity of the project.  Collectively, these studies have documented the occurrence of a small 

number of threatened, endangered, and special concern species in the study area.  This 

data will be used in evaluating the potential impacts of the project.  

 

20.1.6 Air Quality and Meteorology 
 

The project commissioned in 2007 a study to document baseline air quality and meteorologic 

conditions at the site.  Two years of quarterly air quality and meteorological monitoring data 

were collected, beginning in the third quarter of 2007.  Wind speed and direction, 

temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, and particulate matter 10 microns and less (PM10) 

were collected.  These data will be used in evaluating the potential impacts of the project.

20.1.7 Cultural and Historical Resource Studies 
 

The property and proposed development area has been investigated for the existence of 

cultural resources and historical artifacts.  Identified locations of potential cultural resources 

will be incorporated into the overall project design to mitigate potential impacts to existing 

cultural resources.   

 

20.2 Key Environmental Protection Issues 

The following items represent key environmental protection issues that will be incorporated 

into the engineering design of the proposed project to mitigate, to the extent possible, 

potential impacts. 

 

20.2.1 Mine Pit Proximity to the Menominee River 
 

This deposit is located adjacent to the Menominee River that borders Michigan and 

Wisconsin.  The mineralized material will be extracted from an open pit in close proximity to 

the river.  Concerns include mine dewatering impacts on river flow, structural integrity of the 

pit wall between the river and open pit mine, and the potential for post-reclamation impacts 

on water quality in the river.  The design, operations, and monitoring program will account for 

those concerns.  The configuration of an open pit mine adjacent to a river and satisfactory 

reclamation has been successfully completed at the Flambeau Mine in Ladysmith, Wisconsin 

which is located in a similar geologic and hydrologic environment. 

 

20.2.2 Management of Waste Rock and Tailings and Site Reclamation 
 

The waste rock and tailings that will be generated from the project will contain sulfide 

mineralization and the potential for acid rock drainage and metals leaching.  The engineering 

plans, required as part of the treatment and containment plan, for storage and management 

of waste materials includes engineering designs to mitigate impacts from acid rock drainage 

by incorporating appropriate liners, covers, and leak detection systems.  Specially designed 

storage facilities and waste handling methods will prevent environmental impacts during 

mining activities and after mining ceases.  Further detail is described in the next section. 

 

20.2.3 Water Discharge 
 

Water sources during operations include groundwater inflow into the mine pit, water 

infiltrating through mineralized material and tailings/waste rock piles, runoff water from the 

mining operations area, and excess water from mill operations.  This water will be collected 

in a lined contact water basin and routed to the water treatment plant.  The treatment plant 

will be designed to treat excess water to required standards so that water discharged to the 

environment will meet applicable water quality standards.

April 2012 Page 167  
 

20.2.4 Archeological Artifacts  
 

The presence of cultural resources such as Native American artifacts, especially close to 

waterways, is not uncommon in this region.  Mining structures will be sited to avoid or 

mitigate impacts to cultural resources located in the vicinity of the mine operations. 

 

20.2.5 Wetlands Protection 
 

Wetlands identified on the property have been delineated and the delineated wetland 

locations have been approved by the local regulatory agency.  Regulated wetlands identified 

within the project boundary will not be directly affected by the proposed mining operation.   

 

20.2.6 Listed and Protected Species and Sensitive Habitat in the Area 
 

Vegetative and wildlife studies have been conducted and a small number of threatened, 

endangered, and special concern species have been identified in the area.  Their habitat is 

located in areas outside of the proposed mining activities.  Monitoring of those species and 

habitats are anticipated to be part of the monitoring program required as a condition of the 

issued permit.  The location of mine facilities will incorporate and mitigate potential impacts 

to the identified species. 

 

20.2.7 Particulate Emissions 
 

The waste rock and tailings that will be generated from the project will produce particulate 

emissions as it is crushed and processed for market.  The engineering plans, required as 

part of the air permit includes engineering designs to mitigate impacts from particulate 

emissions by incorporating appropriate containment equipment such as enclosed areas with 

bag houses, spray bars, and wetting of roadways. 

 

20.3 Waste Disposal  

Back Forty mineralized material is reactive and potentially acid generating.  Any water runoff 

that flows through the waste generated from processing must be stored in a properly 

designed facility.  The State of Michigan has specific requirements of acceptable methods of 

mine waste management (Part 632 of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 

Act No. 451 of 1994 as amended (Part 632)).  The rules addressing treatment and 

containment of materials including waste rock and tailings are contained in R 425.409. 

 

As the mine is developed, waste rock will be placed on the lined disposal facility.  As the 

deposit is accessed and milling begins, tailings will be placed on the lined disposal facility.  A 

portion of the waste rock and tailings will be amended with limestone and returned to the pit 

upon reclamation.  Residual waste rock and tailings not used for backfilling the open pit will 

remain in the lined disposal facility and will be capped with an engineered cover.

April 2012 Page 168  
 

20.4 Site Monitoring 

Monitoring is required throughout operations and after mine closure.  A groundwater and 

surface water monitoring network extending beyond the mine site, initiated in baseline 

environmental studies, will be supplemented to provide operational monitoring in accordance 

with the permit.  After mine closure, some or all of the monitoring network will remain in place 

and monitored for 20 years. 

 

20.5 Water Management 

Water will be generated during operations from a variety of sources: site storm water; mine 

pit inflow; contact water from waste rock, tailings, mineralized stockpiles, and storage areas; 

and other sources.  A collection system and wastewater treatment plant will be constructed 

and put into operation early in the project.  All waters discharged to the environment will be 

treated to applicable water quality standards.  

 

Once mining ceases, water treatment and management needs will be reduced.  Mine 

facilities will be reclaimed (either removed or converted to other uses) and water sources 

requiring treatment will be eliminated.  After mine closure, wastewater will be limited to 

whatever water is collected from the closed tailings/waste rock disposal facility.  Post closure 

treatment of residual water from the disposal facility is likely to be required for about 10 years 

after mine closure. 

 

20.6 Project Permitting Requirements 

As with any proposed project, a number of permits are required or may be required prior to 

construction of the Back Forty project: 

 

A Mining Permit Application must describe the proposed project and how Part 632 

requirements will be met.  The application will include information as listed in the rules under 

R425.201 as follows: 

 

• A permit application form; 

• A permit application fee; 

• An environmental impact assessment; 

• A mining, reclamation, and environmental protection plan; 

• A contingency plan; 

• Financial assurance; 

• A list of other necessary permits; and 

• An organizational report. 

 



Back Forty Deposit

______________________________________________________________________________________   

 

April 2012 Page 169  
 

The environmental baseline studies provide a basis upon which to describe the potential 

environmental impact of the proposed project.  Impacts on the following topics must be 

addressed: 

 

• Topography and drainage; 

• Soils; 

• Geology and Hydrology; 

• Water supply (public and private); 

• Wetlands and flood plains; 

• Natural, wild and scenic rivers; 

• Wilderness areas; 

• Flora and fauna; 

• Threatened and endangered species; 

• Cultural, historical, archeological resources; 

• Air quality, meteorology, and climatology; 

• Aesthetic resources; 

• Noise, light, and seismicity; and 

• Feasible and prudent alternatives analysis. 

 

The water discharge permit application will be either a National Pollutant Discharge 

Elimination System application for discharge to surface water, or a groundwater discharge 

permit application for discharge to groundwater.  In both applications, a water balance for the 

facility, wastewater treatment plant design, and predicted influent and effluent concentrations 

are to be described. 

 

Water withdrawal registration and permitting may be required under Part 327 – Great Lakes 

Preservation based on the amount of water required for mine operations and withdrawn from 

the waters of the state.  The permit requirements and evaluation will be completed as the 

mine operation and design is finalized. 

 

An air permit application will include emissions inventory, demonstration of compliance with 

applicable standards by modeling, description of pollution control equipment, and a fugitive 

dust control plan. 

 

A stormwater permit application including construction phase soil erosion, sedimentation, 

and control will be required.  An operational phase stormwater permit application may be 

necessary that describes routing and stormwater treatment. 

 

A well and septic permit application addressing potable and sanitary water for the facility will 

be required.

Federal and state required plans such as Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure 

Plan, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, and Pollution Incident Prevention Plan will be 

required. 

 

The company continues to evaluate the applicability of local-zoning requirements in the 

context of the pre-emptive requirements of Michigan's Part 632 mining regulation. 

 

Permit preparation and environmental baseline studies have been completed or are currently 

ongoing.  Permit applications are anticipated to be submitted in the third quarter 2012. 

 

20.7 Social and Community Factors Related to the Project 

The Back Forty project has from the onset placed high priority on community considerations 

and impacts.  We continue with many of our original means of engaging the community and 

meet internally on a weekly basis to discuss ways to build upon our foundation. 

 

The project is located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Menominee County, Lake 

Township.  Menominee County has 14 townships, three villages and two cities.  The 

population of Menominee County is 24,029.  Lake Township has a population of 576, 

consists of 244 households with 164 families residing in the township. 

 

Michigan's industrial base has been in a downward trend for several decades, influenced 

heavily by the automobile industry in downstate Michigan.  The U.P. had an industrial era of 

heavy mining, lumber, and paper-making in the 19th and 20th centuries.  However, those 

industries have waned since the 1970s.  Tourism has grown, but has not restored the 

previous economic vitality. 

 

The Menominee area economy capitalizes on its location on Lake Michigan and the 

Menominee River bordering Wisconsin.  Industries include shipbuilding, auto and airplane 

parts, chemicals, helicopter design and construction, wicker furniture, health care and paper 

making.  Fishing, boating, water and winter sports, hunting, and observing wildlife are 

popular leisure activities and contribute to the local economy through tourism. 

 

Mining in the U.P. continues in both older taconite and iron ore mines which have provided 

needed employment, as well as a recently permitted copper-nickel mine in northern 

Marquette County, also in the U.P.  The Back Forty project will likely benefit from the recent 

precedents set from the Marquette County project.   

 

Following is a list of on-going practices we have adopted to ensure adherence to our host 

community, its needs and sustainability.

into the community to receive feedback pertinent to potential mine plan issues that 

could affect the community. 

• Host Events: We host several events during the year promoting economic growth for 

the region.  We maintain several memberships to various organizations for 

networking purposes and to educate other professionals about our industry. 

• Government: We maintain relationships with local, regional and state government 

officials to keep them abreast of our project and timelines.  We attend government 

meetings, roundtables, and events to keep ourselves informed and to be supportive 

of their efforts to promote responsible development of our natural resources. 

• Lake Township Board: This is the governing body to the area in which our deposit 

lies.  We attend their monthly board meetings and provide exclusive project updates 

to them prior to releasing information to the general public.   

 

20.7.1 Tribal Outreach 
 

As part of the overall stakeholder engagement program for the project, the Back Forty team 

has made a concerted effort to proactively engage Native American tribes that may have an 

interest in the mine.  Native American tribes are located throughout Michigan and the upper 

Midwest of the US, and these tribes often show an interest in mining projects for a variety of

reasons, including economic development opportunities, environmental concerns, and 

cultural interests due to historic ties with the area. 

 

Although not required by regulation, the Back Forty Joint Venture has specifically reached 

out to those tribes that may have an interest in the area based on proximity or historical 

connections.  This outreach has involved several elements, including: 

 

• Meetings for information exchange with representatives of multiple tribes.  These 

meetings have included face to face meetings with tribal council representatives as 

well as environmental, economic development, and cultural staff 

• Written correspondence with regional tribes requesting relevant information 

• Site tours with individual tribes in closest proximity to the project 

• Presentation of baseline studies and conceptual development plans 

• Consultation with the State Archaeologist and the tribal liaisons of the Michigan 

Department of Natural Resources and Michigan Department of Environmental 

Quality to develop study plans and present results to establish appropriate protection 

measures 

 

Tribal outreach activities are planned to continue throughout the development and permitting 

of the project. 

 

20.8 Mine Closure 

The mining, reclamation, and environmental protection plan required under rule R425.201 

requires a plan for the proposed final reclamation operations, including the anticipated 

schedule, sequence, and duration of reclamation as required under R425.204 – Reclamation 

Plan. 

 

The reclamation plan is required to include the following: 

 

• Final land contours; 

• Proposed final land use; 

• Soil erosion and sedimentation structures that will remain after reclamation; 

• Plans and schedules for stabilization of waste rock piles, settling ponds, tailings 

disposal facilities, overburden banks, open pit banks and walls, roads, and facilities; 

• Final disposition of all toxic and hazardous wastes, refuse, and tailings shall be 

managed in a manner that protects the environment and all applicable laws; 

• All shafts and portals are properly sealed to underground workings; 

• All surface structures, infrastructure, rock stockpiles, and tailings disposal areas 

constructed will be removed or converted to a land use in accordance with the 

proposed final land use; 

• All disturbed surface areas will be stabilized and revegetated;

______________________________________________________________________________________   

 

April 2012 Page 173  
 

• Both the mining area and affected area will be reclaimed to achieve a self sustaining 

ecosystem appropriate for the region that does not require perpetual care following 

closure; and 

• Groundwater and surface water monitoring plans. 

 

Mine closure and reclamation cost estimates are the basis of the financial assurance 

requirements of Part 632 as covered under rule R425.301.  Financial assurance applies to all 

mining and reclamation operations covered under the mining permit and are to be sufficient 

to cover the cost to administer and hire a third party to implement the reclamation, 

remediation, and post closure monitoring required.  The financial assurance cost estimate is 

to include costs for reclamation, remediation of contamination of the air, surface water, and 

groundwater along with administrative oversight, fees, and reasonable contingencies. 

 

Financial assurance shall consist of an approved assurance instrument or combination of 

instruments covering at least 75% of the required amount.  Unless modified by forfeiture, 

transfer of ownership or other specified circumstance, financial assurance requirements 

continue through reclamation until the final release upon termination of the mining permit.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 
The capital and operating costs used for the preliminary economic assessment are based on 

a mixture of new quotations from suppliers and contractors, similar recent project costs, and 

cost database information from Foth, Lyntek, SRK, and Hudbay.   

 

21.1 CAPITAL COSTS 

The LOM capital costs are estimated to be $272.3M, which includes $224.7M for project 

capital as summarized in Table 21.1.  Project capital costs are estimated to be $195.6M plus 

a $29.0M contingency.  Included in the project capital cost are $13.1M for mine equipment, 

$11.9M for pit preparation, haul road and preproduction, $170.6M for site and project 

infrastructure that includes a copper and zinc concentrator and a separate oxide plant 

producing a gold-silver dore.  

 

Sustaining capital adds an additional $43.8M to the LOM plus a $3.8M contingency.  The 

majority of the sustaining capital is $22.6M for mine site closure, $15.1M for the ongoing 

construction and development of the waste rock and tailings management as the mine 

progresses.  The remainder of the sustaining capital is $0.9M for additional mobile 

equipment, $3.8M for mine development, $1.3M for mine general and administration and 

$0.5M for additional site infrastructure.

Bloomberg three year historic average (April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2012). 

 

The flotation copper circuit average recovery used in the economic analysis is 75%, and the 

gold and silver recoveries are 53% and 47% respectively.  The average copper concentrate 

grade is 24% copper.  The flotation zinc circuit average recovery is 89% and the average 

zinc concentrate grade is 51% zinc.  The oxide plant average recovery was 88% for gold and 

65% for silver.  RDi employed the data available, and the results of the various laboratory 

studies to prepare the estimates of grade and recovery.  The average mill recoveries used in 

the economic analysis are shown in Table 22.4.  See section 13.3 Metallurgical Design for 

the estimated values by individual ore type.

The capital and operating costs used for the preliminary economic assessment are based on 

a mixture of new quotations from suppliers and contractors, similar recent project costs, and 

cost database information from Foth, Lyntek, SRK, and Hudbay. 

 

Third party smelter terms and refinery costs are based on Hudbay long term contract 

agreements and assumptions, summarized in Table 22.5.  Other model parameters used in

22.4 Taxes and Royalties 

22.4.1 Taxes 
 

The information presented for taxes was prepared by Tim Lynott, Finance Manager with 

Hudbay.  The Back Forty project will be subject to federal and state income taxes as well as 

the General Property Tax Act (GPTA) 1893 PA206, which is an ad valorem tax based on the 

true cash value (TCV) of the non-ferrous mining property as defined by the state geologist. 

 

The combined federal (US) and state (Michigan) tax rates are assumed to be 38% for the life 

of the project. 

 

Regarding the GPTA, the true cash value is defined as the net present value (NPV) of the 

metals to be mined in a 10 year period as determined from data provided by the company.  

The general calculation is to multiply the tons of ore to be mined each year by concentration 

of metal by predicted pricing (usually at the smelter) less projected deductible costs to come 

up with the TCV. This number is re-evaluated each year as inputs may vary. 

 

A preliminary draft of legislation is currently being circulated at the state level to introduce a 

simplified severance tax on non-ferrous metal mining properties which would replace the 

GPTA as it relates specifically to mining properties.  Different drafts have ranged from 1.8% - 

2% applicable tax rates on a range of base amounts from net proceeds (net income) to gross 

revenues.  There is not a final draft version as of this date. 

 

22.4.2 Royalties 
 

The Back Forty project is subject to three different royalty agreements that were included as 

part of the cash flow analysis in the preliminary economic assessment as follows: 

1. A 7% of Net Distributable Earnings (NDR) on all mineral products produced from the 

property to American Copper & Nickel Company, Inc.  The full 7% NDE is only 

applicable after the project preproduction expenditures have been recovered.  Prior 

to recovering the preproduction expenditures the NDR is reduced to 20% of the 7% 

or 1.4%.  The NDE is calculated on a quarterly basis after subtracting the applicable 

operating and capital mine site costs that include processing of the ore and all 

applicable smelter or refiner costs incurred. 

2. A 3.5% royalty based on net smelter return (NSR) by surface mining or a 2.5% NSR 

for underground mining from the Ganzer claim.  The NSR is defined to mean the 

entire proceeds received from a smelter, reduction of the charges for transportation 

of the mineral substances to the place of sale, all charges, costs, deduction penalties 

made or imposed by the smelter or refiner for treating, processing, beneficiating, 

smelting and refining the mineral substance but excludes all milling and mining costs. 

3. A state of Michigan mineral production royalty applies to the land parcels that are 

part of the state mining lease, which is also based on a NSR as defined above.  The

NSR royalty percentage is a sliding scale that increases as the NSR value per ton 

increases, see Section 4.3 of this report for details.  The average NSR royalty 

payment used for this PEA cash flow analysis was 3.7%.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

The author is not aware of any relevant work on properties immediately adjacent to the Back 

Forty project. 

 

The Back Forty property lies within the Penokean volcanic belt of Northern Michigan and 

Wisconsin and this section summarizes the non-ferrous mining and exploration activities of 

the belt.  Approximately 105km north of the Back Forty deposit is the operating nickel-copper 

Eagle Mine.  Presently, there are six advanced exploration properties that are scattered 

throughout Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Southern Ontario.  

Aquila Gold presently has three gold exploration properties in the Upper Peninsula and 

Wisconsin and the Aquila/Hudbay Alliance is exploring three more in the same region.  Table 

23.1 summarizes the non-ferrous properties of the Penokean Volcanic Belt by commodity, 

company and location.  The table does not include the prolific native copper mining district of 

the Keweenaw Peninsula in the northern part of the Upper Peninsula.  The mineralization of 

the non-ferrous properties noted in the table is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization 

on the Back Forty site.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  
 

This technical report has used investigation and analysis that are considered appropriate for 

a preliminary economic assessment level of study.   

 

The following presents the interpretations and conclusions of this preliminary economic 

assessment: 

 

Geology 

The Back Forty volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit is one of a number of deposits 

located throughout the Ladysmith-Rhinelander volcanic complex in northern Wisconsin 

and western Michigan.  The complex lies within the lower Proterozoic Penokean 

Volcanic Belt (PVB).  The PVB is part of the Southern Structural subprovince of the 

Canadian Shield.  The Back Forty deposit lies within a felsic centre as do most of the 

other deposits in the belt.  Host rhyolites are strongly altered by quartz-sericite-pyrite.  

Mineralization at the Back Forty deposit consists of discrete zones of 1) zinc or copper-

rich massive sulfide, which may contain significant amounts of gold, 2) stockwork 

stringer sulfide, which can be gold, zinc, and copper-bearing, 3) precious metal-only, 

low sulfide mineralization, and 4) oxide-rich, precious metal-bearing gossan. 

 

Mineral Resource 

The mineral resource estimate with an effective date of October 15, 2010 was used for 

this PEA.  The geological model of mineralization was initially constructed by Aquila 

personnel and Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) reconstructed new mineral wireframes 

to assess the bulk mining potential of the significant gold and lower grade base metal 

mineralization outside the original model.  Gold and zinc both contribute significantly to 

the economics and cut-offs of 1g/t gold or 0.5% zinc was used to delineate the 

mineralization.  The quantity of silver was also used as a guide to ensure that 

significant value was not missed.  In general, the modelling attempted to contain as 

much material with significant amounts of these three elements, while maintaining as 

little 'barren' material as possible.  Eleven separate domains were modelled, including 

the cross-cutting dyke material, and given unique numeric zone codes.  Resource 

classification strategy included parameters used in the estimate based on the gold 

variograms and the assumption that the majority of the deposit would be extracted by 

open pit methods.  The resource was classified into measured, indicated and inferred 

resources based on a minimum number of composites estimated within a 

predetermined search distance.  NSR ($/tonne) was assigned to each block by 

combining the contribution by each element from proposed metal recovery and 

applying metal prices.  Golder assigned two NSR cut-off values to reflect the 

"reasonable prospects" for economic extraction and the assumption that a good 

portion of the Back Forty deposit can be extracted through open pit methods.  To 

accomplish this, Golder carried out a Whittle pit optimization exercise.

Processing 

Metallurgical test programs were performed independently on the oxide and sulfide 

mineralization.  Average mill head grades were based on a preliminary mine 

production schedule to predict the average recovery of gold, silver, copper and zinc.  

The assumed sulfide recoveries were estimated independently by metallurgical type, 

but based on an assumed blend material through the flotation plant.  The two distinct 

types of mineralization will be processed in two separate plants.  The oxide material 

containing gold and silver, will be processed using an agitated cyanide leach, CCD 

and Merrill Crowe process producing a final gold-silver alloy dore product in the oxide 

plant.  The sulfide plant will produce copper and zinc concentrates via selective 

flotation of the individual minerals from the material.  The copper concentrate will 

contain gold and silver credits while zinc concentrate will include lead.  However, no 

lead credits are expected. 

 

Infrastructure 

The Back Forty property has paved road access and includes a power line and a site 

office.  The proposed project infrastructure for this preliminary economic assessment 

consists of on-site and off-site activities to support a mining operation.  The offices and 

mine facilities required for the project are the mine/processing complex which includes 

mineralized storage areas, crushers, conveyors, milling equipment, tailings thickener, 

oxide plant, sulfide plant, and a reagent building.  Other structures will include a 

laboratory, mine offices, warehouse, employee locker rooms, first aid station, fueling 

stations, truck wash, and various tanks to contain fuels and chemicals.  A 115 acre 

engineered facility will be constructed on the property that proposes a co-disposal of 

both tailings and waste rock.  Upon completion of the mining activities, final 

reclamation of this facility will commence.  A new 4.5km power transmission line will be 

built from an existing 138kV transmission line northeast of the property.  A new power 

substation planned at the southeast corner of the project will provide power for the 

plant facility and mine site with 13.8kV distribution voltage.  Improvements of existing 

near and on-site roads and construction of new haulage roads will be required.  A rail 

line is situated approximately 13km east of the project site and tie-in switches will be 

installed for the concentrate load-out siding.  It is assumed that fresh water will be 

supplied from wells to be drilled on the property.  The site is located on the western 

shore of the Menominee River approximately 64km northwest of the Port of 

Menominee and 89km southwest of the Port of Escanaba.  The rail line corridor 

passes through both ports and it may be feasible to utilize these services and forgo 

capital of a rail siding load-out facility.

Environmental and Permitting 

Environmental baseline investigations were initiated in 2007 to meet regulatory 

requirements for advancement of the project and protect the surrounding environment.  

As with any proposed project, a number of permits are required or may be required 

prior to construction of the project.  A Mining Permit Application must describe the 

proposed project and how Part 632 requirements will be met.  The application will 

include information as listed in the rules under R425.201.  Permit preparation and 

environmental baseline studies have been completed or are currently ongoing to allow 

permit applications to be submitted in 2012.   

 

Mine Plan 

The mine plan assesses the potential economic viability of mining only the nearer 

surface mineralization by open pit methods.  Potential underground mining of deeper 

mineralization is not evaluated in this report.  The portion of the measured, indicated 

and inferred mineral resources used for evaluation purposes in the PEA above the 

NSR cut-off values, including allowances for dilution and mining loss and based on a 

pit optimization study assumes a seven year full production mine life.  The pit design 

includes the river constraint to the west and wetland constraint to the southwest.  The 

overall pit depth of 170m from surface incorporates a 17m wide haulage ramp at a 

10% gradient and 6m high mining benches.  The mine design includes an 8m catch-

berm at the contact between overburden and rock.  An annual production schedule 

was generated with the objective of meeting a target total processing rate of 

approximately 3,000tpd.  Preproduction stripping of one year in advance was planned 

to prepare the pit for sustained plant feed.  The maximum mining rate is about 

14,000tpd over a five year period that includes mineralization and waste material.  

Mine operation is based on mining by the owner's workforce and contractor mining 

was not assessed in this study. 

 

Economics 

Based on the assumptions used in this preliminary economic assessment the Back 

Forty project has a pre-tax cash flow of $211.8M with a NPV8% of $73.6M and an 

18.2% IRR with a start date of January 1, 2012 of the project.  The LOM capital costs 

are estimated to be $272.3M, which includes $224.7M for project capital.  Project 

payback occurs in the third year of production. 

 

While there can be risks associated with mining projects, many of those risks can be 

mitigated with appropriate information gathering and engineering review.  The author 

summarizes main risks associated with the Back Forty project as follows: 

• Ability to achieve operating and capital cost estimates 

• Ability to secure environmental permits  

• Forecasted metal commodity prices

The author summarizes the following opportunities for improvement with the Back Forty 

project: 

• Extension to life of mine through the discovery of additional resources 

• Further geotechnical investigations may lead to reduction of stripping quantities 

• Expansion of the open pit into the southwest wetland constraint provides additional 

run of mine plant feed 

• Trade off study of owner operated fleet versus contract mining 

 

Industry standard mining, metallurgical investigation, and economic evaluation practices 

have been used to assess the Back Forty deposit. There is adequate geological and other 

pertinent data available to generate a preliminary economic assessment. 

 

Subsequent higher level engineering studies will need to further evaluate these risks and 

opportunities. 

 

This study is preliminary in nature and uses inferred resources to evaluate the project.  

Subsequent studies may or may not verify the findings of this preliminary economic 

assessment.  There is still significant amount of information that is required to complete the 

assessment, at this point the project does not appear to have any fatal flaws.  The study met 

its original objective of providing a positive preliminary review of the potential economic 

viability of the Back Forty project.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

It is recommended by the author that the Back Forty project complete a mineral resource 

update and conduct additional metallurgical testwork.  The mineral resource update will 

include drilling information since November 2010 and should include interpretation of each 

mineralized domain.  Additional metallurgical testwork should be conducted using samples 

from each mineralized domain that more closely resembles the expected production grade 

from each mineralized domain.  If the recommended mineral resource update and 

metallurgical testwork is successful, a pre-feasibility level of study should be initiated. 

 

The cost estimate for the mineral resource update is expected to be in the range of $50,000 

to $100,000 and the additional metallurgical testwork is expected to be in the range of 

$200,000 to $400,000.
