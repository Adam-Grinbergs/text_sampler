43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 30	

1. SUMMARY 

In February 2015, InnovExplo Inc. ("InnovExplo") was retained by Pascal Dubé, 
Director Technical Services for Centerra Gold Inc. ("Centerra") to prepare a technical 
report (the "report") on the Trans-Canada property (the "property") in accordance 
with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") 
Standards of disclosure for mineral projects and its related form 43-101F1. 
InnovExplo is an independent mining and exploration consulting firm based in Val-
d'Or (Québec).  
 
The triggering factor of the herein technical report is the disclosure of the partnership 
between Centerra and Premier Gold Mines Limited ("Premier Gold") jointly formed 
for the exploration, development and operation of the Trans-Canada Property, 
published on February 5, 2015. The transaction was completed on March 9, 2015. 
This technical report also presents a mineral resource estimate for the Hardrock 
deposit on the Hardrock Project of the Trans-Canada Property which was prepared 
by InnovExplo and published in a report titled "Technical report and mineral resource 
estimate update for the Hardrock deposit (according to National Instrument 43-101 
and Form 43-101F1" (Brousseau et al., 2014).  
 
This report refers to and presents the results of the Preliminary Economic 
Assessment ("PEA") for the Trans-Canada Property released in March 2014 (St-
Laurent et al., 2014). The PEA included both the Hardrock and the Brookbank 
projects. The Key Lake and Viper projects as well as the Kailey deposit were not 
included in the PEA.  
 
The Hardrock deposit is the largest of the four gold deposits on the Trans-Canada 
Property and was exploited by the former Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt and 
Mosher mines. The Hardrock deposit area covered by the 2014 mineral resource 
estimate in this report is located in the townships of Errington and Ashmore on NTS 
sheet 42E/10, approximately 5 km south of the town of Geraldton. The Hardrock 
Project consists of a contiguous block of patented claims, mining leases, Licences of 
occupation and staked claims covering an aggregate area of 4,517.5 hectares, on 
July 4, 2014. All of the claims, leases and Licences of occupation are held by 
Premier Gold. The patented claims, leases and Licences of occupation for the 
Hardrock Project are subject to terms under a number of agreements. 
 
The Hardrock Project is located within the Wabigoon terrane in the Archean Superior 
Province. The Wabigoon terrane has long been recognized as a composite terrane 
comprising volcanic-dominated domains with a central axis of variable-age plutonic 
rocks (Davis and Jackson, 1988; Percival et al., 2002b; Percival and Helmstaedt, 
2004). 
 
The local geological setting of the Hardrock deposit is represented by the southern 
sedimentary unit of the Beardmore-Geraldton Belt. The southern sedimentary unit in 
the Geraldton area is characterized by multiple horizons of magnetite-rich chert 
banded iron formation (BIF) within a thick sequence of interlayered sandstone-
argillite and minor polymictic conglomerate. The sequence is intruded by medium- to 
coarse-grained diorite sills and feldspar-quartz porphyry dykes, which, together with 
the sedimentary rocks, are folded by tight to isoclinal, regional F2 folds, e.g., the Ellis 
Syncline and Hard Rock Anticline (Pye 1951; Horwood and Pye 1951).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 31	

Most mineralized occurrences in the Hardrock deposit area lie in a zone of 
deformation to the immediate north of, and genetically linked to, the Tombill-
Bankfield Deformation Zone. Numerous Z-folds on various scales were formed in the 
deformation zone. Auriferous vein systems in the MacLeod-Cockshutt and Hard 
Rock mines are hosted by one of the Z-folds. This structure plunges shallowly west 
(Horwood and Pye, 1951) and is mimicked by minor parasitic folds in the BIF. Gold 
deposits in the Hardrock deposit area are classic examples of epigenetic non-
stratiform banded iron-formation (BIF)-hosted gold deposits (historical North Zone 
and West Zone).  
 
Mineral Resource Estimate 

The 2014 Hardrock Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared by Karine Brousseau, 
P.Eng., under the supervision of Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo., using all available 
information (Brousseau et al., 2014). The main objective of the mandate assigned by 
Premier Gold was to update the 2013 Hardrock Mineral Resource Estimate which 
was prepared by InnovExplo and published in a report titled "Technical Report and 
Mineral Resource Estimate for the Hardrock Deposit (compliant with National 
Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)" (Brousseau et al., 2013). The Hardrock 
deposit was mined in the past as the Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt and Mosher 
mines. 
 
The mineral resources presented herein are not mineral reserves since they have no 
demonstrable economic viability. The result of this study is a single Mineral 
Resource Estimate for fifteen (15) gold-bearing zones and a remaining 
undifferentiated envelope. The estimate includes indicated and inferred resources for 
both a Whittle-optimized in-pit volume and a complementary underground volume. 
The effective date of the estimate is July 4, 2014 based on the Whittle-optimized pit 
parameters and cut-off grades parameters. 
 
The 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate detailed in this report was made using 3D 
block modelling and the inverse distance square interpolation (ID2) method for a 
corridor of the Hardrock deposit with a strike-length of 5.7 km and a width of 
approximately 1.7 km, down to a vertical depth of 1.8 km below surface. 
 
The estimate is based on a total of 1,417 surface drill holes which corresponds to the 
drill holes completed and validated at the close-out date of May 26, 2014. This 
selection of 1,417 drill holes contains a total of 259,640 sampled intervals taken from 
621,373.8 m of drilled core. 
 
Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, and the specific 
interpolation parameters, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the current (updated) 
Hardrock In-Pit and Underground Mineral Resource Estimate can be classified as 
Indicated and Inferred resources. The estimate has been prepared in accordance 
with CIM standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.  
 
The overall results of the current Mineral Resource Estimate are presented in table 
below (Section 14 – Table 14.1.11).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 33	

OVERALL, InnovExplo estimates that the Hardrock deposit has a total Indicated 
Resources of 89,037,100 metric tonnes grading 1.70 g/t Au for a total of 4,870,356 
ounces of gold. Total Inferred Resources are estimated at 23,146,700 metric 
tonnes grading 3.69 g/t Au for a total of 2,743,638 ounces of gold.  
 
For the IN-PIT portion, InnovExplo estimates that the Hardrock deposit has a total 
Indicated Resources of 83,867,800 metric tonnes grading 1.47 g/t Au for a total of 
3,972,542 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 0.50 g/t Au. Total Inferred 
Resources are estimated at 10,225,000 metric tonnes grading 1.53 g/t Au for a 
total of 501,349 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 0.50 g/t Au. 
 
For the UNDERGROUND portion, InnovExplo estimates that the Hardrock deposit 
has Indicated Resources of 5,169,300 metric tonnes grading 5.40 g/t Au for a 
total of 897,814 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 3.00 g/t Au. Total Inferred 
Resources are estimated at 12,921,700 metric tonnes grading 5.40 g/t Au for a 
total of 2,242,288 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 3.00 g/t Au. 
 
Conclusion and Recommendation 

The objective of InnovExplo's assignment was to prepare an updated mineral 
resource estimate for the Hardrock deposit using recent diamond drill holes and an 
updated litho-structural model, covering the area of the past producing Hard Rock, 
MacLeod-Cockshutt and Mosher mines. This technical report and the mineral 
resource estimate presented herein meet this objective. The PEA study, released in 
March 2014, was included in this report for reference purposes; the PEA was based 
on InnovExplo's previous mineral resource estimate. 
 
After conducting a detailed review of all pertinent information and completing the 
2014 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo concludes the following: 
 

 The geological and grade continuities of the fifteen (15) gold-bearing zones of 
the Hardrock deposit were demonstrated. 

 The additional infill drilling provided sufficient information to update the 
previous (2013) mineral resource estimate.  

 The estimate of overall Indicated Resources now stands at 4.87 Moz and 
total Inferred Resources at 2.74 Moz. The In-Pit Indicated Resources have 
increased to 3.97 Moz. 

 The overall 2014 Indicated Resources represent a 50% increase in ounces 
compared to the 2013 estimate. The 2014 Inferred Resources represent a 
27% decrease in total ounces compared to the 2013 estimate.  

 The new estimate includes a deeper and steeper pit when compared to the 
previous estimate. 

 Not all of the Inferred Resources were converted into Indicated Resources in 
the pit area, so this could have an impact on any future economic study. 

 The potential is high for upgrading Inferred Resources to Indicated 
Resources with more diamond drilling in multiples zones.  

 There is also a potential to upgrade Indicated Resources to In-Pit Measured 
Resources with detailed geological mapping, infill drilling and systematic 
surface channel sampling. 

 
InnovExplo concluded that the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate presented herein 
allows the Hardrock deposit to advance to the feasibility study stage for which the

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 34	

potential viability of an open-pit project has been demonstrated by the March 2104 
PEA.  
 
InnovExplo considers the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate to be reliable, thorough, 
based on quality data, reasonable hypotheses, and parameters compliant with NI 43-
101 and CIM standards regarding mineral resource estimations. 
 
Based on the results of the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo 
recommends that the Hardrock deposit be advanced to the next phase, which would 
be the preparation of a feasibility study and environmental test work. The 
environmental work should include baseline studies in preparation for permitting, and 
to validate assumptions made for water treatment facilities. 
 
Further definition drilling is also recommended to upgrade Inferred resources to the 
Indicated category and to more accurately assess the potential of all zones in the 
2014 Whittle shell. The drilling is currently underway. 
 
The ongoing outcrop mapping, stripping and channel sampling work should be 
completed and the results can be used to verify and establish the structural and 
grade continuity in the proposed pit area. This work will also provide the data needed 
to confirm the dilution factors and convert Indicated Resources to In-Pit Measured 
Resources. This recommendation was completed in 2014. 
 
InnovExplo recommends generating a more precise 3D model of the remaining 
historical openings, which would have a positive impact on handling any 
mineralization adjacent to the voids created by historical mining. This 
recommendation is currently underway. 
 
The definition drilling and outcrop mapping program results should be used to update 
the litho-structural model. The creation of more constrained wireframes for some of 
the mineralized zones is also recommended to optimize the grade interpolation.  
 
The recommended feasibility study should be based on an updated mineral resource 
estimate that includes future diamond drill holes, channel samples and updated 3D 
models of voids and mineralized zones. 
 
For the purpose of verification and training, an RC and production blast hole drilling 
program is recommended in the proposed pit area. This program could improve the 
penetration rate, cost and rig performance, verify the analysis and sampling 
protocols, and serve to train personal on RC and blast hole drilling. It could also be 
used to develop grade control procedures and convert Indicated Resources to In-Pit 
Measured Resources as well. 
 
In summary, InnovExplo recommended in 2014 a two-phase work for the geological 
program as follows: 
 

 Phase 1 

o Definition drilling to upgrade Inferred resources to an Indicated 
category in the proposed pit area (drilling is underway); 

o Mapping, stripping and channel sampling (completed in 2014); 



 
 www.innovexplo.com

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 35	

o 3D model update, including the litho-structural and void models (3D 
model update is underway); 

o Update of the current mineral resource estimate to include future DDH 
and 3D model updates. 

 
 Phase 2 

o RC and production blast hole drilling program; 
o Additional mapping and stripping (2015). 

 
A cost estimate was prepared for the recommended two-phase geological work 
program to serve as a guideline for the project. The 2014 budget for the proposed 
program is presented in the table below (Section 26, Table 26.1.1.). 
 
The estimated cost for Phase 1 would amount to approximately $6.6M and would 
include definition drilling, the completion of the ongoing mapping program, 3D model 
updates and an update of the current mineral resource estimate.  
 
The estimated cost for Phase 2, which would include the RC and production blast 
hole drilling program and additional mapping and stripping, is approximately $2.8M.  
 
The estimated budget for the feasibility study is $15M in expenditures for 2014 and 
2015, including the implementation of a community relation strategy. 
 
Estimated costs as proposed in 2014 for the recommended work program 
(Table 26.1.1) 
Budget for Phase 1 Cost Estimate 

Definition drilling $5,000,000 
Mapping, stripping and channel sampling (underway) $300,000 
3D model updates $150,000 

Updated mineral resource estimate for the Hardrock 
deposit $80,000 
Subtotal $5,530,000 
Contingency (20%) $1,106,000 
Total Phase 1 $6,636,000 

Budget for Phase 2  

RC and production blast hole drilling program $2,000,000 
Additional mapping and stripping (2015) $300,000 
Subtotal $2,300,000 
Contingency (20%) $460,000 
Total Phase 2  $2,760,000 

 TOTAL  $9,396,000 
 
 
InnovExplo is of the opinion that the recommended two-phase work program and 
proposed expenditures are appropriate and well thought out. InnovExplo believes 
that the proposed budget reasonably reflects the type and amount of the 
contemplated activities.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 36	

2. INTRODUCTION 

In February 2015, InnovExplo was retained by Pascal Dubé, Director Technical 
Services for Centerra to prepare a technical report (the "report") on the Trans-
Canada property (the "property") in accordance with Canadian Securities 
Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") Standards of disclosure for 
mineral projects and its related form 43-101F1. InnovExplo is an independent mining 
and exploration consulting firm based in Val-d'Or (Québec).  
 
On March 9, 2015, Centerra and Premier Gold's wholly owned subsidiary, Premier 
Gold Mines Hardrock Inc.("Premier Hardrock"), formed the TCP Limited Partnership 
for the exploration, development and operation of the Trans-Canada Property.  
Under the partnership, the Trans-Canada Property is comprised of the following 
exploration properties:  Hardrock, Brookbank, Key Lake and Viper. The triggering 
factor of the technical report herein is the disclosure of the partnership between 
Centerra and Premier Gold. 
 
Centerra is a Canadian-based gold producer, operating, exploring, developing and 
acquiring gold properties in Asia, Canada and other markets around the world. 
Centerra's principal operations are located in the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. 
Centerra's common shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange 
(TSX: CG). Centerra is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 
 
Premier Gold is a Canadian-based mineral exploration and development company,

Gold has a diverse portfolio of advanced-stage gold exploration properties located in 
Northwestern Ontario - Canada and Nevada - USA. Premier Gold's common shares 
are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: PG). 
 
This report also refers to and presents the results of the Preliminary Economic 
Assessment ("PEA") for the Trans-Canada Property released in March 2014 (St-
Laurent et al., 2014). The PEA covered both the Hardrock and the Brookbank 
projects. The purpose of the PEA was to provide a full description of the mine and 
mill design studies and to provide a cost estimate and economic evaluation for each 
individual project. The PEA was prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd. ("Stantec") 
using the 2013 Hardrock Mineral Resource Estimate performed by InnovExplo Inc. 
(Brousseau et al., 2013) and the 2013 Brookbank Mineral Resource Estimate 
completed by Micon International Ltd (Murahwi et al., 2013). The Key Lake and Viper 
projects as well as the Kailey deposit were not included in the PEA.  
 
The Trans-Canada Property (Fig. 2.1) is located in northern Ontario approximately 
200 km northeast of Thunder Bay. It consists of four projects with a cumulative strike 
length of more than 100 kilometres, located along or in close proximity to the Trans-
Canada Highway between the towns of Geraldton and Beardmore in the Province of 
Ontario. The Trans-Canada Property consists of three contiguous blocks comprising 
360 patented mining claims and 676 unpatented mining claims covering an 
aggregate area of 28,550.64 hectares. The projects within the Trans-Canada 
Property are Hardrock and Key Lake (283 patented mining claims and 49 
unpatented mining claims totalling 9,826.19 ha), Brookbank, (77 patented mining 
claims and 609 unpatented mining claims totalling 15,314.46 ha) and Viper (20 
unpatented mining claims totalling 3,430.99 ha).

and development of the Trans-Canada Property. 
 

 HARDROCK 

 Terms of Reference 

This technical report provides a mineral resource estimate for the Hardrock deposit 
on the Hardrock Project of the Trans-Canada Property prepared by InnovExplo in 
2014 (Brousseau et al., 2014). This resource estimate includes new and re-sampled 
historical drill holes. The area covered by the resource estimate is 5.7 kilometres 
long by 1.7 kilometres wide and extends to a depth of 1,800 metres below surface.  
 
Some of the Hardrock information and results presented herein were taken from the 
2014 PEA presented in the NI 43-101 report prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd and 
released in March 2014 (St-Laurent et al., 2014). This information has not been 
modified in any way, with the exception of section 20.1.12.3 in accordance to 
comments from Premier Gold and the QP of this section. The changes 
accurately reflect the QP's current understanding of the permitting 
requirements for the project. The QP is of the opinion that these changes have 
no impact on the permitting costs allocated in the PEA. 
 
The Hardrock deposit is the largest of the four gold deposits on the Trans-Canada 
Property. The Hardrock Project constitutes an approximately 15-km-long land 
package in the Geraldton mining camp (refer to Fig. 4.1.2). The Hardrock deposit 
was exploited by the former Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt and Mosher mines 
(refer to Fig. 6.1.1). 
 

 Principal Sources of Information 

InnovExplo's review of the Hardrock Project and the Hardrock deposit was based on 
published material in addition to data, professional opinions and unpublished 
material submitted by Premier Gold. InnovExplo has reviewed the data provided by 
Premier Gold and/or by its agents. InnovExplo has also consulted other information 
sources, principally the Mining Claims Information database for the status of mining 
titles and the Geology Ontario online warehouse for assessment work (both available 
via the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines website), as well as technical 
reports, annual information forms, annual reports, management's discussion and 
analysis reports, and press releases published by Premier Gold on the SEDAR 
website. 
 
InnovExplo conducted a review and appraisal of the information used to prepare the 
sections relating to the Hardrock deposit and project, including the conclusions and 
recommendations, and believes that such information is valid and appropriate 
considering the status of the project and the purpose for which the report is 
prepared. The authors have fully researched and documented the conclusions and 
recommendations made in the report.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 40	

Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical 
Report", dated March 13, 2014 and prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent 
et al., 2014).  
 
InnovExplo has not modified, updated or edited in any way the Brookbank 
sections presented in this report, including the Brookbank Mineral Resource 
Estimate.  
 
The March 2014 PEA compared two cases. The base case includes a milling facility 
at each of the two proposed mines (Hardrock and Brookbank). Option B involves 
only one milling facility at the Hardrock deposit that would process mineralized rock 
from both deposits. Option B forgoes the OPEX and CAPEX for a milling facility at 
the Brookbank deposit. In Option B, the mineralized rock from the Brookbank deposit 
would be trucked to the Hardrock milling facility. The base case was prepared in the 
summer of 2013 and Option B was reviewed in Q4 of 2013. The final PEA report 
examines both the base case and Option B.  
 
Site visits to the Brookbank site and the Beardmore Northern Empire Mill took place 
in the week of March 18 to 22, 2013. During the visit to the Brookbank Property, 
mineralized exploration diamond drill core was examined along with the overall 
condition of the site. Visits to the Beardmore Northern Empire Mill were completed to 
determine the condition of the existing site for proposed milling of the Brookbank 
feed material. 
 
Each of the following QPs is responsible for his/her contribution as noted in Table

 NOTE REGARDING THE 2014 PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT  

Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) means a study, other than a Preliminary 
Feasibility Study or Feasibility Study, which includes an economic analysis of the 
potential viability of mineral resources. PEA is defined only in National 
Instrument 43-101, not in the CIM definition standards. A PEA is preliminary in 
nature; it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative 
geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 
them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the 
preliminary economic assessment will be realized. A PEA use the concept of 
"mineral resources within a conceptual mine plan" or "mineral resources within a 
PEA design plan". If an issuer can qualify mineral reserves or make a production 
decision based on the PEA, it may be misleading to call it a PEA. A mineral reserve 
is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated mineral resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. The results of a Feasibility 
Study may reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or 
financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. 
 

 UNITS AND CURRENCIES 

All currency amounts are stated in Canadian Dollars ($, C$, CAD) or US dollars 
(US$, USD). Quantities are stated in metric units, as per standard Canadian and 
international practice, including metric tons (tonnes, t) and kilograms (kg) for weight, 
kilometres (km) or metres (m) for distance, hectares (ha) for area, and grams (g) or 
grams per metric ton (g/t) for gold grades. Contained gold is stated in troy onces 
(oz). Wherever applicable, imperial units have been converted to the International 
System of Units (SI units) for consistency. A list of abbreviations used in this report is 
provided in Appendix I.

3. RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

This technical report has been prepared by InnovExplo at the request of Centerra 
and Premier. InnovExplo employees Karine Brousseau, P.Eng., and Carl Pelletier, 
P.Geo., both qualified and independent persons as defined by National Instrument 
43-101, were assigned the mandate to study technical documentation relevant to the 
report, to perform a mineral resource estimate update on the Hardrock deposit, and 
to recommend a work program if warranted. InnovExplo has reviewed the mining 
titles and their status, as well as any agreements and technical data supplied by the 
issuer (or its agents) and any available public sources of relevant technical 
information. 
 
Some of the geological and/or technical reports for projects in the vicinity of the 
Hardrock Project were prepared before the implementation of NI 43-101 in 2001. 
The authors of such reports appear to have been qualified and the information 
prepared according to standards that were acceptable to the exploration community 
at the time. In some cases, however, the data are incomplete and do not fully meet 
the current requirements of NI 43-101. InnovExplo have no known reason to believe 
that any of the information used to prepare this report is invalid or contains 
misrepresentations. InnovExplo relied on reports and opinions as follows for 
information that is not within the authors' fields of expertise: 
 

 The issuer supplied information about mining titles, option agreements, 
royalty agreements, environmental liabilities, permits, and details of 
negotiations with First Nations. InnovExplo is not qualified to express any 
legal opinion with respect to property titles or current ownership and possible 
litigation. This disclaimer applies to sections 4.2 to 4.4 in the technical report. 

 Venetia Bodycomb, M.Sc., of Vee Geoservices provided the linguistic editing 
for draft versions of sections 2, 3, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1,11, 12.1, 
14.1, 23.1, 25 and 26 of the present report.  

 
InnovExplo believes the information used to prepare this report and to formulate its 
conclusions and recommendations is valid and appropriate considering the status of 
the project and the purpose for which the report is prepared. The authors, by virtue 
of their technical review of the project's exploration potential, affirm that the work 
program and recommendations presented in the report are in accordance with 
NI 43-101 and CIM technical standards. 
 
This report, including the March 2014 PEA, was compiled through the efforts of 
qualified persons as described in Section 2 (Introduction). The authors have sourced 
the information for this report from an amalgamation of several reports listed in 
Section 27 (References).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 43	

4. PROPERTY DESCRIPTIONS AND LOCATIONS 

In the Province of Ontario, mining is largely regulated by the provincial government, 
with the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) and the 
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) acting as the two main oversight 
bodies. The Canadian federal government may also be involved in the mining 
process when First Nations matters arise or where the subject lands are federally 
regulated, as is the case for uranium mining or for lands with navigable water bodies. 
 
The following descriptions were taken from Winton (2012).  
 
Staking Claims  

Mining claims can only be obtained by an entity that holds a prospector's licence 
from the MNDM. A licenced prospector is permitted to enter onto provincial Crown 
and private lands that are open for exploration and stake a claim on those lands. 
Notice of the staked claim can then be recorded in the mining register maintained by 
the MNDM. Once the mining claim has been recorded, the prospector is permitted to 
conduct exploratory and assessment work on the subject lands. To maintain the 
mining claim and keep it properly staked, the prospector must adhere to relevant 
staking regulations and conduct all prescribed work thereon. The prescribed work is 
currently set at C$400 per annum per 16-hectare claim unit. The prescribed work 
must be completed as no payments in lieu of work can be made. No minerals may 
be extracted from lands that are the subject of a mining claim – the prospector must 
possess either a mining lease or a freehold interest to mine the land. 
 
A mining claim can be transferred, charged or mortgaged by the prospector without 
obtaining any consents. Notice of the change of owner of the mining claim or charge 
thereof should be recorded in the mining registry maintained by the MNDM. 
 
Mining Lease  

If a prospector wants to extract minerals, the prospector may apply to the MNDM for 
a mining lease. A mining lease, which is usually granted for a term of 21 years, 
grants an exclusive right to the lessee to enter upon and search for, and extract, 
minerals from the land, subject to the prospector obtaining other required permits 
and adhering to applicable regulations. 
 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Ontario Mining Act (the Act), the holder of a mining 
claim is entitled to a lease if it has complied with the provisions of the Act in respect 
of those lands. An application for a mining lease may be submitted to the MNDM at 
any time after the first prescribed unit of work in respect of the mining claim is 
performed and approved. The application for a mining lease must specify whether it 
requests a lease of mining and surface rights or mining rights only and requires the 
payment of fees. 
 
A mining lease can be renewed by the lessee upon submission of an application to 
the MNDM within 90 days before the expiry date of the lease, provided that the 
lessee provides the documentation and satisfies the criteria set forth in the Act in 
respect of a lease renewal.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 44	

A mining lease cannot be transferred or mortgaged by the lessee without the prior 
written consent of the MNDM. The consent process generally takes between two and 
six weeks and requires the lessee to submit various documentations and pay a fee. 
 
Freehold Mining Lands  

A prospector interested in removing minerals from the ground may, instead of 
obtaining a mining lease, make an application to the MNR to acquire the freehold 
interest in the subject lands. If the application is approved, the freehold interest is 
conveyed to the applicant by way of the issuance of a mining patent. A mining patent 
can include surface and mining rights or mining rights only. 
 
The issuance of mining patents is much less common today than in the past, and 
most prospectors will obtain a mining lease in order to extract minerals. If a 
prospector is issued a mining patent, the mining patent vests in the patentee all of 
the provincial Crown's title to the subject lands and to all mines and minerals relating 
to such lands, unless something to the contrary is stated in the patent. 
 
As the holder of a mining patent enjoys the freehold interest in the lands that are the 
subject of such patent, no consents are required for the patentee to transfer or 
mortgage those lands. 
 
Licence of Occupation  

Prior to 1964, mining licences of occupation (MLO) were issued, in perpetuity, by the 
MNDM to permit the mining of minerals under the beds of bodies of water. MLOs 
were associated with portions of mining claims overlying adjacent land. As an MLO 
is held separate and apart from the related mining claim, it must be transferred 
separately from the transfer of the related mining claim. The transfer of an MLO 
requires the prior written consent of the Ministry. As an MLO is a licence, it does not 
create an interest in land. 
 
Land Use Permit  

Prospectors may also apply for and obtain a land use permit (LUP) from the MNR. 
An LUP is considered to be the weakest form of mining tenure. It is issued for a 
period of 10 years or less, and is generally used where there is no intention to erect 
extensive or valuable improvements on the subject lands. LUPs are often obtained 
when the land is to be used for the purposes of an exploration camp. When an LUP 
is issued, the MNR retains future options for the subject lands and controls its use. 
LUPs are personal to the holder and cannot be transferred or used as security.

 Agreements and Encumbrance 

On July 4, 2014, the Hardrock Project consists of a contiguous block of patented 
claims, mining leases, licences of occupation and staked claims covering an 
aggregate area of 4,517.5 hectares (Figs. 4.1.2 to 4.1.4). All of the claims, leases 
and licences of occupation are beneficially held by the Limited Partnership. The 
patented claims, leases and licences of occupation for the Hardrock Project are 
subject to terms under a number of agreements. A detailed list of mining titles, 
ownership, and royalties is provided in the Appendix II. 
 

 Agreement with Roxmark Mines Ltd – 2007 

This agreement is summarized from the Premier Gold 2007 Annual Information Form 
available on the SEDAR website.  
 
Pursuant to a letter of intent dated September 24, 2007, entered into between 
Premier Gold and Roxmark Mines Limited ("Roxmark"; now amalgamated with 
Goldstone Resources Inc.), Premier Gold acquired the right to earn up to a 70% 
interest in certain mineral claims which are 100% owned by Roxmark (the "Geraldton 
Project"). The Geraldton Project consists of 113 mineral claims located in the 
Ashmore and Errington townships in the Geraldton Greenstone belt of northwestern 
Ontario. Under the terms of the Roxmark letter of intent, Premier Gold could earn an 
initial 51% interest in the Geraldton Project by paying to Roxmark $500,000, issuing 
250,000 common shares of Premier Gold, and incurring $7,000,000 in exploration 
expenses on the Geraldton Project over a four-year term (the "Geraldton Earn-In").

 Claims staked by Premier Gold and Roxmark Mines L:imited – 2007 

Between 1 October and November, 2007, Premier Gold staked four (4) claims 
located in Errington and Ashmore townships, covering an aggregate area of 288 ha 
(see Appendix II). Premier Gold personnel established the claim boundaries by GPS. 
These claims are covered by the Roxmark JV Agreement and, therefore, are owned 
70% by Premier Gold and 30% by Roxmark. 
 

 Agreement with Lac Properties Inc. – 2008 

This agreement is summarized from the Premier Gold 2008 Annual Information Form 
available on the SEDAR website.  
 
Effective December 18, 2008, Premier Gold entered into an agreement (the "G-L 
Agreement") with Lac Properties Inc. ("Lac Properties") pursuant to which Premier 
Gold purchased from Lac Properties, a 100% interest in the mining claims commonly 
known as the Geraldton, Ozone Creek and Eva Summer properties (the "G-L 
Properties") together with certain equipment and other assets related thereto (the 
"G-L Assets"). Premier Gold satisfied the purchase price for the G-L Assets by: 
 

 Issuing to Lac Properties 500,000 common shares of Premier Gold; 
 Paying to Lac Properties the amount of $1,000,000; 
 Depositing $1,000,000 in an environmental reclamation trust fund in 

connection with the G-L Assets 
 Entering into a royalty agreement with Lac Properties which provides for, 

among other things, the payment to Lac Properties of a 3% net smelter return 
royalty (NSR) in respect of the G-L Assets; and 

 Assuming certain liability and obligations of Lac Properties in respect of the 
G-L Assets. 

 
No royalty shall be payable for or with respect to reasonable quantities of product 
which are not sold but which are used for assaying, treatment, amenability, 
metallurgical, test work, piloting or other analytical processes or procedures. 
 

 Agreement with Roxmark Mines Ltd – 2008 

This agreement is summarized from the Premier Gold 2009 Annual Information Form 
available on the SEDAR website.  
 
Pursuant to a letter of intent dated September 18, 2007 and amended on July 18, 
2008, between Premier Gold and Roxmark (now amalgamated with Goldstone 
Resources Inc.), the companies agreed to form a joint venture in the Thunder Bay 
Mining Division, Ontario with respect to: 
 

 Certain mining claims that were 100% owned by Roxmark (the "Roxmark 
Claims");  

 Certain mining claims to be staked by Premier on behalf of the joint venture 
(the "Staked Claims"); and 

 Certain mining claims commonly known as the Geraldton property that were 
acquired by Premier Gold from Lac Properties (the "Lac Claims", and, 
together with the Roxmark Claims and the Staked Claims, the "Hardrock 
Project").

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 51	

 
Pursuant to the Roxmark Letter of Intent, Premier Gold acquired the right to earn a 
51% interest in the Roxmark Claims by paying $500,000 to Roxmark, issuing 
250,000 common shares of Premier Gold to Roxmark, and incurring $7,000,000 in 
exploration expenses on the Hardrock Project over a four-year term (the "Roxmark 
Earn-In"). In addition, Premier Gold was granted the option, immediately upon 
fulfilling the Hardrock Earn-In, to increase its interest in the Roxmark Claims to 70% 
by paying an additional $250,000 to Roxmark, issuing an additional 150,000 
common shares of Premier Gold to Roxmark and electing to bring the Hardrock 
Project to a production decision within five years of completing the Hardrock Earn-In 
period (being September 2016) (the "Roxmark Option Obligations"). If Roxmark 
proposes to dispose of any of the common shares of Premier Gold issued to it under 
the Roxmark Letter of Intent, Premier Gold has the right to place such common 
shares within a 10-day period following the notice of such disposition. 
 
Under the terms of the Roxmark Letter of Intent, upon Premier Gold's acquisition of 
the Lac Claims in December 2008, Premier was deemed to have given its notice of 
intention to exercise its option to increase its interest in the Roxmark Claims to 70%, 
subject to satisfaction of the Roxmark Earn-In and the Roxmark Option Obligations, 
with Roxmark acquiring a 30% interest in the Lac Claims upon such satisfaction.  
 
Premier Gold satisfied the Hardrock Earn-In and the Hardrock Option Obligations, 
and, as a result, Premier Gold and Roxmark held a 70% interest and a 30% interest, 
respectively, in the Hardrock Project. Roxmark was subsequently acquired by, and 
amalgamated with Goldstone Resources Inc. 
 

 Acquisition of Goldstone Resources Inc. by Premier Gold – 2011 

This acquisition is summarized from the Premier Gold 2011 Annual Information Form 
available on the SEDAR website.  
 
On August 16, 2011, Premier Gold acquired all of the outstanding common shares of 
Goldstone Resources Inc. ("Goldstone") pursuant to an arrangement (the "Goldstone 
Arrangement") under Section 182 of the OBCA. Goldstone's principal asset was its 
30% interest in the Hardrock Project. As a result of the Goldstone Arrangement, 
Premier Gold holds a 100% interest in the Hardrock Project.  
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Goldstone Arrangement, all of the common shares of 
Goldstone were transferred to Premier Gold, and former holders of common shares 
of Goldstone received 0.16 of a Premier Gold common share plus $0.0001 in cash in 
exchange for each common share of Goldstone so transferred. All of the outstanding 
common shares of Goldstone were then transferred from Premier Gold to a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Premier Gold incorporated for the purposes of the Goldstone 
Arrangement ("Premier Subco"), and Goldstone was amalgamated into Premier 
Subco to form a new amalgamated corporation with the name Goldstone Resources 
Inc. ("Goldstone Amalco"). As a result of the Goldstone Arrangement, Goldstone 
Amalco  is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Premier Gold. Under the terms of the 
Goldstone Arrangement, holders of options exercisable for common shares of 
Goldstone received a fully-vested option (each a "Premier Replacement Option") 
granted by Premier Gold to acquire 0.16 of a Premier Gold common share plus the 
fractional amount of a Premier Gold common share that, immediately prior to the 
effective time of the Goldstone Arrangement, had a fair market value equal to

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 52	

$0.0001 in cash in exchange for each outstanding option to acquire Goldstone 
common shares. The outstanding warrants (the "Goldstone Warrants") to acquire 
Goldstone common shares remained outstanding in accordance with their terms, 
which terms provided that each warrant will be exercisable to acquire 0.16 of a 
Premier Gold common share plus $0.0001 in cash for each such Goldstone Warrant 
exercised. Pursuant to the Goldstone Arrangement, the Corporation issued an 
aggregate of 16,814,553 Premier Gold common shares and paid an aggregate of 
$10,512.61 to former holders of common shares of Goldstone. In addition, 197,026 
Premier Gold common shares are issuable upon exercise of Premier Replacement 
Options (which have exercise prices ranging from $2.3436 to $5.995). The common 
shares of Goldstone were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange at the close of 
business on August 19, 2011, and Goldstone Amalco has ceased to be a reporting 
issuer. 
 

 Consolidation of the Hardrock Project – 2011 

The completion of the Goldstone Arrangement had the effect of consolidating a 
100% interest in the Hardrock Project for Premier Gold. The issuer also acquired, 
through its acquisition of Goldstone, a portfolio of exploration properties in the 
Geraldton-Beardmore Greenstone Belt, including interests in the Brookbank, Leitch-
Sand River, Northern Empire, Nortoba-Tyson and Key Lake projects. The Key Lake 
Project adjoins the western end of the Hardrock Project and hosts the historical 
Jellico mine of Jelex Mines Limited. Following completion of the Goldstone 
Arrangement, Premier Gold has referred to its Geraldton-Beardmore property 
portfolio as the "Trans-Canada Property" (Fig. 4.1.5) of which Hardrock is the core 
project.

As indicated, there are a number of underlying agreements and royalties that apply 
to some of the mining titles constituting the Hardrock Project. A number of mining 
titles owned by Roxmark in the past are subject to a 3% net smelter return (NSR) in 
favour of Lac Properties and a 5% net profit interest in favour of Algoma Steel Inc. 
Lac Properties is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation. The Lac 
Properties royalty previously owned by Barrick is now owned by Franco-Nevada. 
Algoma Steel was acquired by Essar Global in 2007. Following its purchase by 
Essar Global, Algoma Steel announced that its name had been changed to Essar

Steel Algoma Inc. A number of mining titles owned by Roxmark in the past are 
subject to a 2% net smelter return (NSR) in favour of Essar Steel Algoma.  
 
In one deal, Roxmark, through its subsidiary Beaurox Mines Limited ("Beaurox"), 
purchased the interest held by Ateba Mines Inc. ("Ateba") in the former producing 
Magnet mine in Errington Township (Northern Miner, November 30, 1992). Ateba 
acquired an interest in the Magnet mine through a joint venture with Roxmark in the 
late 1980s. Under the agreement, Beaurox discharged Ateba's debt to Roxmark and 
the private European Mining Finance Company for a 1% NSR on the first 350,000 
tons of ore processed from the mine. The name of the European Mining Finance was 
changed to Griffin Mining Limited in January 1998 following a change in 
management and the business of the company to that of mining. 
 
In another agreement, Roxmark purchased the mining rights on the Bankfield mine 
property from Golden Trio Minerals Ltd for 1,000,000 Roxmark shares and a 3% 
NSR royalty (Northern Miner, November 30, 1992). During the first year of 
commercial production, Roxmark can reduce the NSR to 1.5% with a $500,000 cash 
payment. Following a 1:2 reverse-split in 1994, Golden Trio Minerals Ltd changed its 
name to PCS Wireless Inc. and changed its name again in 1999 to Unique 
Broadband Systems Inc.  

 
 Partnership with Centerra Gold Inc. for the Trans-Canada Property 

Effective March 9, 2015, Centerra, and Premier Gold's wholly owned subsidiary, 
Premier Gold Mines Hardrock Inc. ("Hardrock"), formed the TCP Limited Partnership 
(the "Limited Partnership") for the exploration, development and operation of the 
Trans-Canada Property.  Under the partnership, the Trans-Canada Property is 
comprised of the following exploration properties:  Hardrock, Brookbank, Key Lake, 
and Viper projects (Fig. 2.1).  It does not include the Beardmore/Northern Empire 
property/mill or the Leitch/Sands River and Nortoba-Tyson properties (all of which 
remain solely owned by Premier Gold).   
 
Pursuant to a contribution agreement with the Limited Partnership, Premier Hardrock 
arranged for all claims, leases and licences of occupations comprising the Trans-
Canada Property (other than assets related to Northern Empire, Leitch/Sands River 
and Nortoba-Tyson) to be transferred to the Limited Partnership in exchange for a 
50% interest in the Limited Partnership (through the holding of general partnership 
units). Centerra entered into contribution agreement with the Limited Partnership 
whereby it agreed to contribute $85,000,000 to the Limited Partnership for its 50% 
interest in the Limited Partnership (through the ownership of limited partnership 
units).  The $85,000,000 was distributed to Premier Hardrock pursuant to the terms 
of the amended and restated limited partnership agreement entered into between 
Centerra, Hardrock and a corporation owned 50/50 by Centerra and Hardrock dated 
March 9, 2015 (the "Partnership Agreement").   
 
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, Centerra has agreed to commit up to an 
additional $30,000,000 in cash (the "Centerra Contingent Contribution") contingent 
on the results of an updated mineral resource calculation of the Hardrock Project; the 
amount, if any, will be distributed by the Limited Partnership to Premier Hardrock. 
 
Pursuant to the implementation agreement dated February 5, 2015 among Centerra, 
Premier Gold and Premier Hardrock (the "Implementation Agreement") that was 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 54	

entered into in connection with the Limited Partnership, Centerra committed to solely 
fund up to C$185 million in capital to develop the Trans-Canada Project (following 
which all funding for the Limited Partnership will be made on a pro-rata basis). A 
portion of these funds will initially be used to complete a comprehensive technical 
and economic feasibility study including an updated mineral resource calculation for 
the Hardrock deposit. Subject to the satisfaction of certain feasibility and project 
advancement criteria, the remainder of the funds will be used towards the 
construction and development of the Hardrock deposit in accordance with annual 
programs and budgets approved by the Limited Partnership from time to time. 
 

 Environmental Liabilities and Mine Workings 

These environmental liabilities are summarized from Premier Gold's 2011 and 2012 
annual information forms available on the SEDAR website.  
 
Since the Hardrock Project encompasses past producing mines, there are a number 
of historical facilities and associated potential liabilities on the project, as 
summarized below. Premier Gold is aware of these potential historical liabilities and 
is remediating safety issues and taking the presence of historical contaminants into 
consideration for future development.  
 
The Hardrock mine north tailings have been fully reclaimed and are the location of 
the back nine holes of the Geraldton golf course. It is recommended that this area 
not be disturbed again because extensive work has gone into rehabilitating the north 
tailings area and the recreational activities now associated with it. 
 
The historical Hardrock mine south tailings have been disposed of east of the 
Hardrock mine near the Tenacity deposit in the small bay on Kenogamisis Lake. The 
tailings appear to affect water quality in Kenogamisis Lake based on ongoing water 
quality sampling and analysis. Tailings from the Little Long Lac process plant were 
disposed of in Barton Bay. These tailings also appear to affect water quality in 
Kenogamisis Lake. 
 
Elevated arsenic and mercury concentrations have been recorded in Kenogamisis 
Lake (mostly in the Barton Bay area) from historical mine tailings. Arsenic originates 
from the arsenopyrite in the deposits and from historical roasters, and mercury is 
likely to be from past amalgamations used in the process plants. Other elevated 
metal levels may also be a result of past disposal of unconfined tailings as 
mentioned above, and historical roaster waste. These elevated levels will need to be 
considered in future development work. Acid-generating waste rock located near the 
Tenacity deposit and the Hardrock mine south tailings has been covered with a 
composite clay cap that has been shown to be effective. 
 
Past mine workings have been stabilized with capped shafts and locked head 
frames, and unsafe crown pillars have been fenced. Studies by Golder Associates 
Limited in the early 2000s indicated that the remaining crown pillars are sufficient 
and stable. One unsafe crown pillar located next to the historical Little Long Lac plant 
is fenced to provide protection and Premier Gold has no plans to do further 
remediation at this site. Historical ground control points located between the 
MacLeod shaft and the Hard Rock No. 1 shaft were surveyed by J. D. Barnes in 
2009.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 55	

Under the terms of the G-L Agreement with Lac Properties, an environmental trust 
was established to cover certain additional rehabilitation in the event that a 
governmental or regulatory authority requires Premier Gold to conduct further 
rehabilitation of mining lands on the G-L Properties (including the Lac Claims). 
Beyond the environmental trust amount, Premier Gold is liable for all future costs, 
rehabilitation or clean-up for prior mining or processing activities and for any future 
costs related to closure plans should mining begin on the Hardrock Project. 
 
With respect to the Roxmark Claims, it has been proposed that the former Magnet 
mine site be classified as being in a state of inactivity. The Magnet mine site was 
subject to an inspection by the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and 
Forestry (MNDMF) in October 2009 and 2010. Phase 1 of the rehabilitation has been 
completed. 
 
Premier Gold's operation is subject to environmental regulation primarily by the 
Ministry of the Environment (MOE) in Ontario. The Department of Fisheries & 
Oceans of Canada and the Department of the Environment of Canada have an 
enforcement role in the event of environmental incidents. The operations of Premier 
Gold are subject to environmental regulations promulgated by government agencies 
from time to time. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions 
on spills, releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with 
certain mining industry operations, such as seepage from tailings disposal areas, 
which would result in environmental pollution. In addition, certain types of operations 
require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. 
 

 Permits 

At present, no permits are required for drilling and general surface exploration. 
Permits are required to undertake surface stripping and trenching and drilling when 
the drill site encroaches on Provincial Highway No. 11. The Limited Partnership is in 
the process of obtaining advanced exploration permits and approvals for the 
Hardrock Project from the MNDM and the MOE.  
 
On April 5, 2012, the MNDM approved Premier Gold's Advanced Exploration 
Closure Plan for the Hardrock Project. The closure plan was developed to support 
advanced exploration within the old underground workings and required the 
construction of a ramp and dewatering to allow access. An Environmental 
Compliance Approval (ECA) and a Permit to Take Water (PTTW) was received from 
the MOE on October 23, 2012; however, no dewatering has occurred at this time. 
 

 Governmental Royalties  

Conventional royalties or taxes on possible future mineral production would be due 
to the Ontario and/or federal governments.  
 

 Risks and Uncertainties 

The Limited Partnership is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties due to the 
nature of its business. The Limited Partnership's exploration and development 
activities expose the issuer to various financial and operational risks. Readers are 
advised to study and consider the risk factors outlined below. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 56	

The Limited Partnership's future financial success depends on the ability to raise 
additional capital from the issue of shares or the discovery of property which could 
be economically justifiable to develop. Such development could take years to 
complete and resulting income, if any, is difficult to determine. The sales value of any 
mineralization potentially discovered by the issuer is largely dependent upon factors 
beyond the issuer's control, such as the market value of the products produced. 
 
The resource exploration industry is an inherently risky business with significant 
capital expenditures and volatile metals markets. The marketability of any minerals 
discovered may be affected by numerous factors that are beyond the issuer's control 
and which cannot be predicted, such as market fluctuations, mineral markets and 
processing equipment, and changes to government regulations, including those 
relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and 
environmental protection. 
 
This industry is intensely competitive and there is no guarantee that, even if 
commercial quantities are discovered, a profitable market will exist for their sale. The 
Limited Partnership competes with other exploration companies for the acquisition of 
mineral claims as well for the engagement of qualified contractors. Metal prices have 
fluctuated widely in recent years, and they are determined in international markets 
over which the issuer has no influence. 
 
Exploration and development on the Limited Partnership's project are affected by 
government regulations relating to such matters as environmental protection, health, 
safety and labour, mining law reform, restrictions on production, price control, tax 
increases, maintenance of claims, and tenure. There is no assurance that future 
changes in such regulations would not result in additional expenses and capital 
expenditures, decreasing availability of capital, increased competition, title risks, and 
delays in operations. 
 

 Negotiations with Aboriginal Groups in the Hardrock Project Area 

The following negotiations with First Nations are summarized from the Premier Gold 
2011 Annual Information Form available on the SEDAR website.  
 
The First Nations of Ginoogaming, Long Lake #58 and Aroland assert that the 
mining claims that comprise the Hardrock Project encompass their traditional 
territory. The band offices of Ginoogaming and Long Lake #58 are located near 
Longlac, Ontario, approximately 40 km east of the Hardrock Project, and the Aroland 
First Nation band office is located near Nakina, Ontario, approximately 65 km north 
of the Hardrock Project. From the outset of gaining an interest in the Hardrock 
Project in 2009, Premier Gold engaged with local aboriginal communities and 
continues to do so. On July 27, 2009, Premier Gold announced that it had signed a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Ginoogaming First Nation. The 
agreement establishes a commitment by both parties to develop a mutually 
beneficial, co-operative, productive and positive working relationship with respect to 
exploration activities within Ginoogaming traditional lands and the potential 
development of the Hardrock Project. On development of a feasibility report, Premier 
Gold expects that a timetable will be set to commence negotiation of an Impact and 
Benefits Agreement (IBA) with Ginoogaming. Provisions of the IBA will address 
training, employment, business, investing and related opportunities for Ginoogaming

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 57	

and their members. Premier Gold signed a subsequent Addendum with 
Ginoogaming on December 9, 2011.  
 
On March 18, 2010, Premier Gold announced that it had signed an exploration 
agreement (EA) with Long Lake #58 First Nation. The agreement establishes a 
commitment by both parties to develop a mutually beneficial, co-operative and 
productive working relationship with respect to exploration activities within the 
traditional lands of Long Lake #58 and the potential development of the Hardrock 
Project.  
 
Additionally, Premier Gold continues to engage Aroland First Nation, the Redsky 
Métis Independent Nation and the Métis Nation of Ontario with respect to the 
Hardrock Project. 
 
Aboriginal interests and rights as well as related consultation issues may impact 
Premier's ability to pursue exploration, development and mining at its Hardrock 
Project. Premier has entered or intends to enter into agreements with First Nations 
and other Aboriginal communities in order to manage its relationship with those 
groups but there is no assurance that claims or other assertion of rights by Aboriginal 
communities or consultation issues will not arise on or with respect to Premier's 
Hardrock Project or activities. These could result in significant costs and delays or 
materially restrict Premier's activities. 
 

 Comment on Item 4 

Premier Gold supplied information about the mining titles, option agreements, royalty 
agreements, environmental liabilities, permits, and negotiations with First Nations. 
InnovExplo is not qualified to express any legal opinion with respect to the property 
titles or current ownership and possible litigation. Premier Gold's exploration and 
development activities expose the issuer to various financial and operational risks. 
 

 BROOKBANK  

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 

 General 

The Brookbank Project area hosts the Brookbank, Cherbourg and Foxear deposits 
and the Irwin prospect. 
 
The August 2011, acquisition of Goldstone allowed Premier Gold to add the 
Brookbank, Key Lake, Northern Empire and Leitch-Sand River Projects to its 
portfolio of Projects within the Trans-Canada Property (refer to Figure 4.1.5). 
 
For the purpose of this report, only the Brookbank Project will be discussed in detail 
under this section. 
 

 Location 

The approximate centre of the Brookbank Project is located at 440 100 mE, 5 507 
000 mN, using NAD 83, Zone 16 coordinates, or 49º43'N and 87º05'W using

geographic coordinates. The project area is located within 1; 50,000 scale NTS map 
sheet 42E/12 and lies 10 kilometres (straight distance) to the northeast of the town of 
Beardmore. By road, it is approximately 14 kilometres east of Beardmore along the 
Trans-Canada highway and 12 kilometres north of the highway by gravel road. 
Beardmore is about 205 kilometres by the Trans-Canada highway northeast of the 
airport in Thunder Bay, Ontario. 
 

 Project Size and Ownership 

The Brookbank Project consists of 684 leases and unpatented claims totalling 
15,314.46 hectares. Figure 4.2.1 shows a claims plan for the Project. A summary of 
the mining leases and staked claims for the Brookbank Project are contained in 
Appendix II. 
 
Premier owns 100% of the 18 leased claims that comprise the Brookbank deposit 
with the remaining portion of the Project subject to two Joint Venture (JV) 
agreements with Metalore Resources Limited (Metalore). The first JV is a Premier 
Gold 74%/Metalore 26% split with the second a Premier Gold 79%/Metalore 21% 
split. 
 

 Government Royalties and Permits 

Conventional royalties or taxes on possible future mineral production will be due to 
the Ontario or Federal Governments. 
 
Normally, permits are not required for drilling and general surface exploration. 
Permits are required to undertake surface stripping and trenching and drilling when 
the drill site encroaches on Provincial Highway No. 11. 
 
The royalty and permitting issues are similar for the individual projects within the 
Trans-Canada Property.

 Potential Issues / Environmental Liabilities 

Several past producing mines lie on the Trans-Canada Property and there are a 
number of historic facilities and associated potential liabilities on the property, as 
summarized below. The Limited Partnership is aware of these potential historic 
liabilities, is remediating safety issues, and taking the presence of historic 
contaminants into consideration for future development.  
 
The potential liability issues are the same for each of the individual projects within 
the Trans-Canada Property that contain past producing mines or their historical 
infrastructure. 
 

 First Nations 

The Trans-Canada Property encompasses traditional territories of the Ginoogaming 
and Long Lake 58 First Nations (FN) who both have band offices near Longlac, 
Ontario, approximately 40 kilometres east of the Hardrock Project. Since 2009, 
Premier has enjoyed a cordial working relationship with both FN groups. 
 
On July 27, 2009, Premier Gold signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the Ginoogaming First Nation. The agreement establishes a commitment by 
both parties to develop a mutually beneficial, co-operative, productive and positive 
working relationship with respect to exploration activities within Ginoogaming's 
traditional lands and the potential development of Premier's Hardrock Property. 
Premier indicates that subsequent to entering into the MOU with Ginoogaming First 
Nation and on development of a feasibility report, a timetable will be set to 
commence negotiation of an Impact and Benefits Agreement (IBA). Provisions of the 
IBA will address training, employment, business, investing and related opportunities 
for Ginoogaming First Nation and their members. 
 
On March 18, 2010, Premier Gold announced that they had signed an Exploration 
Agreement (EA) with Long Lake #58 First Nation (LL58). This agreement establishes 
a commitment by both parties for a mutually beneficial, co-operative and productive 
working relationship with respect to exploration activities within LL58's home lands 
and the potential development of the Hardrock Project.  
 

 Other Factors / Risks 

Other than the issues mentioned above, Micon is not aware of any other significant 
factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on 
the Trans-Canada Property including the Brookbank Project.

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, 

AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 HARDROCK 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock Deposit (according 
to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 

 Accessibility 

The Hardrock Project is accessible year round via paved roads from Geraldton or 
Highway No. 11, which crosses the property from east to west (Fig. 5.1.1). The 
project area is located in the Municipality of Greenstone in the Province of Ontario, 
near the ward of Geraldton, which is located approximately 2 km to the north of the 
main area of mineralization associated with the Hard Rock and MacLeod-Cockshutt 
properties and approximately half a kilometre north of the former Little Long Lac 
Mine. The closest major city is Thunder Bay, Ontario, located 250 km to the 
southwest, and it can be reached by the Highway 11, which is also the Trans-
Canada Highway. Public roads are maintained by various levels of government. Drill 
roads provide excellent access to the areas being explored by Premier Gold. 
 
The south portion of the Hardrock Project can be accessed by Highway 11. The 
remainder of the Hardrock Project can be easily accessed by four-wheel drive 
vehicles via numerous logging/bush roads that branch off of the paved highways. 
Those areas of the Hardrock Project not serviced by roads can be accessed by ATV, 
on foot or by boat during the summer and by snowmobile in the winter. 

 
 Climate 

The Hardrock Project has a typical Northern Ontario climate. The nearest permanent 
weather monitoring station is located approximately 14 km north of the Hardrock 
Project at the Geraldton Airport. Weather statistics for the period 1971-2000 indicate 
a mean daily temperature of 3.9°C. Temperatures range between a maximum of 
37°C and a minimum of -50.2°C. The mean annual rainfall is recorded at 546.4 
millimetres and the mean annual snowfall is 244.5 centimetres. On average, 
precipitation is recorded on 167 days during the course of a year. Further climate 
data can be found at www.weatheroffice.gc.ca. Climate conditions do not seriously 
hinder either exploration or mining activities, with only minor adjustments needed for 
seasonal work such as summer surface mapping and winter drill programs on frozen 
lakes. 
 

 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Hardrock Project benefits from local human resources and services in the ward 
of Geraldton, located 2 km north of the project. Geraldton has a population of 
approximately 1,900 people and has all of the services typical for a town of that size 
including food, lodging, wireless, and wireline telecommunications. Although there 
has been no mining activity in the immediate area since 1970, the area has a skilled 
and trainable workforce. Premier Gold has established a field office in the town of 
Geraldton for core logging/cutting, core storage and lodging of out-of-town 
employees. An independent sample preparation facility is located in Geraldton. Other

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property 64	

significant resources include close proximity to the Trans-Canada Highway, Trans-
Canada Pipeline, a Hydro One electrical substation, and a full service regional 
airport located 12 km north of Geraldton. 
The historical mines on the Hardrock Project saw production from the 1930s to 1970. 
The Hardrock Project occurs in a mining friendly district with active mines and milling 
facilities located at Hemlo, Thunder Bay, Kapuskasing and Timmins. Good 
transportation and regional mining-related infrastructure are favourable factors. 
 

 Physiography 

The topography of the project area is relatively flat to gently rolling with local relief up 
to 20 m, largely attributed to glacial deposits that blanket the bedrock. There are no 
distinct topographic features that stand out in relief. Lower lying areas are 
characterized by swamps and ponds with overall very poor drainage throughout the 
area. The surrounding land has an altitude of about 335 metres above mean sea 
level (masl). The largest lake on the Hardrock Project is Kenogamisis Lake and it 
bounds the project area to the east and north. This lake elevation is about 330 masl.  
 
The Hardrock Project is within the northern coniferous section of the boreal forest. 
Predominant tree species include black spruce, tamarack and cedar. Local stands of 
white birch, jack pine and poplar are established on better-drained areas such as 
eskers and moraines.

 BROOKBANK  

The following Brookbank and Key Lake sections are taken directly from the report 
titled "Technical Report on the Mineral Resource Estimates for the Hardrock, 
Brookbank, and Key Lake Projects Trans-Canada Property Beardmore-Geraldton 
Area Northern Ontario, Canada", dated January 30, 2013 and prepared by MICON 
International Ltd (Lewis et al., 2013). 
 

 Accessibility 

The Trans-Canada Property is located in the Municipality of Greenstone in the 
Province of Ontario, between the wards of Beardmore and Geraldton, and is 
accessible year round via paved roads from Beardmore/Geraldton or Provincial 
Highway No. 11 (Trans-Canada Highway) which straddles the Property from east to 
west. The closest major city is Thunder Bay, Ontario, located approximately 250 
kilometres to the southwest of Geraldton, and it can be reached by Highway No. 11. 
Geraldton has a small air strip suitable for small planes, but the air service to and 
from Thunder Bay is infrequent. Thunder Bay is serviced by daily flights from 
Toronto, Winnipeg, and Minneapolis. 
 
The Brookbank Project is reached from Thunder Bay by driving approximately 200 
kilometres eastward along Provincial Highway 11 to a point 14 kilometres east of the 
town of Beardmore. From this location, the property is accessed by driving north for 
a distance of 12 kilometres along the gravel packed Windigokan Lake road. Public 
roads are maintained by various levels of government. 
 

 Brookbank Climate 

The property lies within the Lake Nipigon eco-region of the Boreal Shield Ecozone 
and is marked by warm summers and cold, snowy winters. Weather statistics for the 
period of 1971 to 2000 indicate a mean daily temperature of 3.9°C. Temperatures 
range between a maximum of 37°C and a minimum of -50.2°C. The mean annual 
rainfall is 546.4 mm and the mean annual snowfall is 244.5 cm. On average,

Other significant resources include close proximity to the Trans-Canada Highway, 
the Trans-Canada Pipeline, a Hydro One electrical substation, and a regional airport 
located 12 kilometres north of Geraldton. 
 
The mines on the Trans-Canada Property saw historical production from the 1930s 
to 1970. The Trans-Canada Property is located in an area of active mining and 
processing operations at Hemlo, Kapuskasing, and Timmins, and related services 
are available in Thunder Bay.  
 
Eighty kilometres west of Geraldton is Beardmore, the "Gateway to Lake Nipigon." 
Beardmore started out as a flag station on the CNR before finding itself in the middle 
of the Lake Nipigon gold "rush" in the 1930s. The town faced "rapid expansion" after 
gold was found on the Sturgeon River, which was evidenced by the Timmins-style 
hotels that unfortunately no longer serve as watering holes for the community. 
Today, Beardmore is a forestry and outfitting town, with a baseball field, a church, 
some gas stations, and approximately 40 to 50 houses. Beardmore is the only small 
town between Geraldton and Lake Nipigon, a 170-kilometre journey. The population 
is roughly between 100 and 150 people. 
 
With a cumulative strike length exceeding 50 kilometres, the Trans-Canada 
Properties is sufficiently large enough to accommodate multiple underground and 
open pit operations including ancillary operations. Even for a stand-alone operation, 
the Brookbank Project area (Fig. 4.2.1) on its own covers sufficient surface rights for 
large scale mining operations. 
 

 Physiography 

The topography of the Trans-Canada Property is relatively flat to gently rolling with 
local relief ranging to up to 20 metres that is largely attributed to glacial deposits that 
blanket the bedrock. There are no distinct topographic features that stand out in 
relief. Lower lying areas are characterized by swamps and ponds with very poor 
drainage throughout the area. The largest lake on the property is Kenogamisis Lake 
which bounds the Hardrock Project area to the east. The lake is at an elevation of 
300 metres above sea level. 
 
The Trans-Canada Property lies within the northern coniferous section of the boreal 
forest. Predominant species include black spruce, tamarack, and cedar trees. Local 
stands of white birch, jack pine, and poplar are established on better-drained areas 
such as eskers and moraines. 
 
The region provides habitat for moose, black bear, lynx, hare, wolf, porcupine, 
beaver, and muskrat. Common bird species include grouse, black duck, and wood 
duck.  
 
To date, there have not been any socio-economic or environmental baseline studies 
conducted on the Beardmore Project. 
 

 KEY LAKE 

The description of accessibility, climate, local resources and infrastructure and 
physiography described above for the Hardrock Project is the same as the Key Lake 
Project which, as already mentioned, lies about 12 km west of the town of Geraldton.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  68	

6. HISTORY 

 HARDROCK 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock Deposit (according 
to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 
This section provides a summary of the historical work carried out on the Hard Rock, 
MacLeod-Cockshutt and Mosher mines (Fig. 6.1.1). Table 6.1.1 presents the 
statistics on gold production, diamond drilling and underground development for all 
three mines. A detailed chronological summary of the historical work carried out on 
these mines is provided by Brousseau et al. (2013). Table 6.1.6 summarizes the 
historical work by year since 1980.  
 
In 1931, following the discovery of gold by W.W. Smith at Discovery Point on 
Kenogamisis Lake, F. MacLeod and A. Cockshutt staked the ground adjoining the 
Hard Rock Gold Mines Limited property to the west. Surface exploration led to the 
discovery of gold-bearing quartz veins in 1931. The discovery of larger mineralized 
zones in 1933 led to the organization of a new company, MacLeod-Cockshutt Gold 
Mines Limited. In 1934, shaft sinking began with the No. 1 shaft; followed by the No. 
2 shaft, 600 m to the southeast, in 1936. The MacLeod-Cockshutt mine became the 
fifth producing gold mine in the Little Long Lac area on April 19, 1938 when a mill 
with a rated capacity of 600 tons per day was brought into operation. In 1967, 
MacLeod-Cockshutt Gold Mines Limited, Consolidated Mosher Mines Limited and 
Hard Rock Gold Mines Limited were amalgamated to form MacLeod Mosher Gold 
Mines Limited. Underground operations continued until July, 1970. The mine had 
produced 1,546,980 ounces of gold at an average grade of approximately 
0.14 oz/t Au. This total accounts for about half of all the gold produced by the 10 
mines in the Geraldton gold camp between 1934 and 1970.  
 
In the 1980s, Lac Minerals Ltd (now Barrick Gold Corporation) undertook studies on 
the existing underground reserves at the MacLeod-Cockshutt and neighbouring 
Hardrock mines and carried out lithogeochemical sampling (Gray, 1994). Starting in 
1987, Lac Minerals conducted ground geophysical surveys, followed by 77 diamond 
drill holes, totaling approximately 50,000 feet (15,240 m). Targets, especially those 
with open pit potential, were investigated (e.g., Hardrock D and F; North and South 
Porphyry; and Porphyry Hill zones). In 1992, Asarco Exploration Company of 
Canada Limited entered into a 5-year earn-in agreement with Lac Minerals and in 
1993 carried out a program of reverse circulation overburden drilling and diamond 
drilling, the latter largely focusing on the near-surface portion of the F-Zone and 
targets along the plunging nose of the albite porphyry.

Table 6.1.1 – Gold production, diamond drilling, and underground 
development statistics for the Hardrock, Macleod-Cockshutt, Mosher Long Lac 
and Macleod-Mosher mines (From Ferguson et al., 1971; Mason And White, 1986) 

 
 
 
As a result of this work, a geological resource was calculated for the Porphyry Hill, 
West and East pits as follows (Gray, 1994): 
 

 Pit Resource: 1,920,000 short tons grading 0.079 oz/t Au (with strip ratio, 
including overburden, of 4.76:1) 

 Ramp Resource: 1,160,000 short tons grading 0.127 oz/t Au  
 

These "reserves" are historical in nature and should not be relied upon. It is unlikely 
they conform to current NI 43-101 criteria or to CIM Standards and Definitions, and 
they have not been verified to determine their relevance or reliability. They are 
included in this section for illustrative purposes only and should not be disclosed out 
of context. 
 
Asarco continued their exploration program into 1994, completing reverse circulation 
holes in overburden, sonic holes in tailings, and an additional 40,000 ft of diamond 
drilling, mostly on the aforementioned targets (Gray, 1994). Cyprus Canada Inc. 
assumed Asarco's role in the Lac Minerals agreement in 1996 and drilled 24 holes, 
leading to the discovery of the B-Zone (Mason and White, 1997).  
 
The agreement ended in 1997. Lac Minerals Properties began a rehabilitation 
program. 
 
In 2000, Golder Associates Ltd ("Golder") was retained by Lac Properties Inc. ("Lac 
Properties") to conduct a stability assessment of the F-Zone crown pillar of the 
MacLeod-Cockshutt mine (Telesnicki and Steed, 2007). From November 27 to 
December 12, 2000, Golder conducted a field investigation to determine whether 
caving had occurred above the stoping. One (1) investigation borehole (369.5 m) 
was drilled in order to perform this investigation. The study also included a literature 
review of the properties of the mined material at the Hard Rock mine, rock mass 
classification of the rock core from the investigation borehole, an empirical analysis 
using the Scaled Span crown pillar stability assessment, an analytical analysis using 
the CPillar crown pillar stability assessment, numerical modelling to determine the 



  
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  71 

stability of the crown pillar using PHASE software, and a correlation of numerical 
modelling results with the field investigation and conclusions. 
 
Investigation drilling at the MacLeod-Cockshutt mine allowed Golder to confirm that 
the crown pillar overlying the workings was intact at the time of the study. No 
unravelling or caving of the crown pillar above the working was observed. 
Classification of the rock mass overlying the workings indicated the quality to be 
"good" to "very good". Empirical, analytical and numerical modelling of the stability of 
the crown pillar overlying the mined zone indicated the crown pillar to be stable. Due 
to the depth of the mine workings and quality of the rock mass, it was not considered 
probable that the rock surrounding the mine workings would influence the ground 
surface. 
 
In 2002, Golder was retained by Lac Properties to conduct a stability assessment of 
the crown pillar of the Hard Rock mine (Soni and Steed, 2002). A total of sixteen (16) 
investigation boreholes (2,116.8 m) were drilled to determine whether caving in the 
crown of the stope had occurred. The study comprised a literature review of the 
properties of the mined material at the Hard Rock mine, rock mass classification of 
the rock core from the investigation boreholes, an empirical analysis using the 
Scaled Span crown pillar stability assessment, an analytical analysis using the 
CPillar crown pillar stability assessment, numerical modelling to determine the 
stability of the crown pillar using PHASE software, and a correlation of numerical 
modelling results with the field investigation and conclusions. 
 
Investigation drilling at the Hard Rock mine indicated that the crown pillar overlying 
the workings was intact at the time of the study. No unraveling or caving of the crown 
pillar above the working was observed by Golder and no unexpected geometries 
were encountered. Classification of the rock mass overlying the workings indicated 
the quality to be "good". Empirical, analytical and numerical modelling of the stability 
of the crown pillar overlying the mined zone indicated the crown pillar to be stable, 
even when conservative values were used for stope geometries, for strength, and for 
rock mass classification, thus ensuring an additional built-in factor of safety. Due to 
the depth of the mine workings and quality of the rock mass, it was not considered 
probable that the rock surrounding the mine workings would influence the ground 
surface. 
 
Golder's report noted that target boreholes and subsequent stability analyses were 
based on the best level of knowledge of the mine workings available at the time of 
the study. Any extrapolation or interpretation of mine geometries or rock mass 
conditions between investigation boreholes is at the reader's risk. 
 
In 2007, six (6) diamond drill holes totalling 1,208.1 m were drilled by Lac Properties 
in crown pillars (Murahwi et al., 2011; 2013).  
 
Almost all drilling in 2009 was done in the vicinity of the former Hard Rock, MacLeod-
Cockshutt and Mosher mines, following Premier Gold's acquisition of Lac Properties' 
claims in late 2008. Premier Gold drilled a total of 91,802 m in 346 holes, with work 
focused on the North Iron Formation Area, the Hard Rock–Porphyry Hill Area and 
the Hard Rock–East Pit Area. 
There were two (2) areas where overburden stripping and related work was carried 
out. The GP Zone, located north of the Trans-Canada Highway approximately 1 km 



  
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  72 

west of the Geraldton turn-off, was stripped, washed and sampled. No mapping was 
done. The second area, the TAZ Zone, located approximately 1.5 km west-
southwest of the Little Long Lac mine, was stripped, washed and sampled. No 
mapping was done. 
 
In March 2010, Reddick et al. (2010) published a new NI 43-101 compliant mineral 
resource estimate for the Hardrock deposit. The technical report defined the mineral 
resources as several closely spaced zones considered best suited to open pit 
mining. The minimum cut-off grade, block size and depth below surface used to 
constrain the resources were applied with the assumption of a resource with bulk 
mineable characteristics. Contained metal and mineral resource estimates are 
summarized in Table 6.1.2. 
 
 
Table 6.1.2 – Mineral resources – Hardrock area (Reddick et al., 2010) 

 
 
 
In 2010, three (3) different areas on the Hardrock Project were stripped: 
 

 The East MacLeod Zone, which is located 500 m due east of the MacLeod-
Cockshutt No.1 Headframe along the Trans-Canada Highway (stripping, 
washing, mapping and sampling). 

 The Headframe Zone, which is located at the base of the MacLeod-Cockshutt 
No.1 Headframe at the intersection of the Trans-Canada Highway and 
Highway 584 (stripping and power washing). 

 The Portal Zone, which is located 500 m southwest of the MacLeod-
Cockshutt No. 1 Headframe (stripping, power washing, sampling). Gold 
grades ranged from trace values to 13 g/t Au. A structural study was carried 
out based on observations from the stripped outcrops and drill core. 

 
A regional prospecting program was completed over the summer. Prospective 
targets were selected from regional anomalies. Prospecting covered the majority of 
the active claim group. Various regions of the property yielded gold values in trace 
amounts to 3 g/t Au. 
 
Diamond drilling continued in 2010 on and around the old Hardrock, MacLeod and 
Mosher mine sites. Drilling was accelerated in 2010 with eleven (11) drills operating 
on the Hardrock Project in the fourth quarter. A total of 114,611 m was drilled in 279 
holes. Some limited infill drilling was completed based on the 2009 data and, 
thereafter, regional exploration became a more important focus, with exploration on 
magnetic targets and other historical mine sites on the property. The main zones that 
were drilled in 2010 were the North, F, SP, NN and K zones. New discoveries were 
made in areas containing no historical reserves, namely the F2-Zone and the newly 
discovered K-Zone. The F2-Zone was originally discovered when the bottom level 
was drifted on the 13th level. No follow-up occurred below that level. The K-Zone, 
which is in the North Iron Formation, was discovered during the course of Premier 
Gold's surface drilling when holes delineating the F-Zone were extended northward.

In 2011, Premier Gold drilled 204 diamond drill holes with a total length of 
107,413 m. The drilling program expanded the SP-Zone and F-Zone, some more 
recently identified horizons including the P-Zone and K-Zone, and new discoveries 
including the high-grade Tenacity South Zone. 
 
Murahwi et al. (2011) prepared an updated NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource 
estimate for the Hardrock deposit. Contained metal and mineral resource estimates 
are summarized in Table 6.1.3. 
 
 
Table 6.1.3 – Mineral resources – Hardrock deposit (Murahwi et al., 2011) 

 
 
 
Premier Gold drilled 125 diamond drill holes between January and October, 2012 for 
a total length of 68,549 m. Diamond drilling focused primarily on testing specific 
target areas of the Fortune Zone and its possible extensions, the HGN and P zones. 
The Fortune and HGN zones comprise multiple, en-echelon, narrow-vein veined 
zones located in close proximity to the historical Hardrock mine workings. The 
primary vein zones were identified over a plunge length of roughly 2 km and appear 
to coalesce at depth but remain open further to the west.  
 
A technical report by Murahwi et al. (2013) presented an updated NI 43-101 
compliant mineral resource estimate for the Hardrock deposit. Contained metal and 
mineral resource estimates are summarized in Table 6.1.4.

Table 6.1.4 – Mineral resources – Hardrock deposit (Murahwi et al., 2013) 

 
 
Between October 31, 2012 and August 9, 2013, a total of 153 diamond drill holes 
(72,776.4 m) were drilled on the Hardrock deposit. InnovExplo included these holes 
in its updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate presented in a technical report 
by Brousseau et al. (2013). Premier Gold released the update on October 29, 2013. 
InnovExplo estimated total Indicated Resources of 55,750,300 tonnes grading 
1.81 g/t Au for a total of 3,240,968 ounces of gold, and total Inferred Resources of 
34,711,200 tonnes grading 3.39 g/t Au for a total of 3,784,047 ounces of gold. 
 
For the in-pit portion, InnovExplo estimated total Indicated Resources of 50,228,100 
tonnes grading 1.46 g/t Au for a total of 2,351,947 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade 
of 0.50 g/t Au. Total Inferred Resources were estimated at 17,792,500 tonnes 
grading 1.50 g/t Au for a total of 858,982 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade of 
0.50 g/t Au. 
 
For the underground portion, InnovExplo estimated Indicated Resources of 
5,522,200 tonnes grading 5.01 g/t Au for a total of 889,022 ounces of gold at a cut-
off grade of 3.00 g/t Au. Total Inferred Resources were estimated at 16,918,700 
tonnes grading 5.38 g/t Au for a total of 2,925,065 ounces of gold at a cut-off grade 
of 3.00 g/t Au. Contained metal and mineral resource estimates are summarized in 
Table 6.1.5. 
 
Table 6.1.5 – Mineral resources – Hardrock deposit (Brousseau et al., 2013) 

 
 
Between August 10, 2013 and December 31, 2013, Premier Gold added 144 
diamond drill holes on the Hardrock deposit for a total of 66,606.7 m. None of these 
holes were included in the 2013 Mineral Resource Estimate by Brousseau et al. 
(2013).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  80 

 BROOKBANK 

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 
The Trans-Canada Property has a long history of exploration and mining. However, 
the following descriptions pertain only to the Brookbank Project. 
 

 Exploration History 

The following summary of exploration activities on the project is excerpted and 
updated from the Scott Wilson (2009, now RPA) Technical Report who adapted it 
from Thompson (2006) and is restricted to those leases and claims covering the 
Brookbank, Cherbourg, and Foxear zones. 
 
The earliest known work on the Brookbank Property is a program of surface 
trenching and limited diamond drilling carried out in 1934 by Connell Mining and 
Exploration Co. Ltd. (Connell Mining). A total of 17 trenches, plus numerous test pits, 
exposed a rusty shear zone in mafic flows over a strike length of 396 metres. Gold 
values from samples in this zone were low and erratic, and the results for the 
diamond drilling are not known. Work was suspended in late 1935. 
 
In 1944, Noranda Exploration Company Limited (Noranda) completed detailed 
mapping, trenching, and 1,860 metres of x-ray diamond drilling in 40 holes to test the 
Brookbank Zone. Brookbank-Sturgeon Mines Limited (Brookbank-Sturgeon), a 
predecessor company to Ontex, acquired the claims covering the current property in 
1950; however, there is no record of the work performed (if any) by Brookbank-
Sturgeon. 
 
Between 1974 and 1975, Lynx Canada Explorations Limited (Lynx) completed 
geological mapping, ground magnetic surveys, and diamond drilling over a portion of 
the property. In 1974, Lynx carried out surface mapping and a magnetometer survey 
on the eastward extension of the Noranda showing. In the following year, Lynx 
completed six drill holes totalling 376 metres to test a thin siliceous band along the 
metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact. 
 
In 1981, Metalore optioned the property from Brookbank-Sturgeon and completed 
line-cutting followed by an electromagnetic (EM) survey over the entire grid and a 
very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) survey over selected portions of the 
property. Metalore subsequently drilled 30 holes totalling 3,567 metres. 
 
Between late 1982 and early 1983, Metalore drilled three widely spaced holes 
totalling 330 metres to test the metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact on the 
Brookbank West property and one 453 metre hole on the Foxear property. 
 
From September 1983 to March 1984, Metalore completed an additional 62 drill 
holes totalling 6,946 metres, including four wedges. In July 1984, Metalore 
commissioned a combined helicopter-borne magnetometer, gamma ray 
spectrometer, and VLF survey over its holdings in Sandra, Irwin and Walters 
townships, including the Brookbank Property.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  81 

From 1984 to 1985, Metalore drilled 23 holes, including 14 wedges, on the 
Brookbank zone totalling 4,421 metres, six holes on the Cherbourg zone totalling 
6,684 metres, and 26 holes on the Foxear Zone totalling 2,202 metres. 
 
In 1986, Metalore concentrated on the Cherbourg zone and completed 43 drill holes 
for a total of 4,368 metres. On October 1, 1986, Metalore entered into an exploration 
and development agreement with Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Ltd. 
(Hudson Bay). 
 
In 1987, Hudson Bay drilled 44 holes for a total of 11,203 metres on Brookbank and 
10 holes for a total of 2,777 metres on Foxear. Mineralogical studies and preliminary 
metallurgical testing were completed on one mineralized sample and approximately 
70 drill collars were located and surveyed. 
 
Metalore's agreement with Hudson Bay was terminated in 1988 because of an 
ownership dispute between Metalore and Ontex. In October 1998, Ontex acquired a 
release of Metalore's right to earn an interest in the Brookbank leases, subject to a 
1% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) due to Metalore upon production. 
 
In July 1989, Placer Dome Inc. (Placer) and Metalore signed an option agreement to 
which Ontex was not a party. From early August to late November of that year, 
Placer completed a program consisting of power stripping/trenching, detailed 
geological mapping, channel sampling, and diamond drilling. Placer exposed an area 
of about 650 metres by 15 metres and took 215 channel samples totalling 244 linear 
metres. Detailed mapping was completed at an imperial scale of one inch to ten feet. 
During 1989, drilling at the Brookbank zone consisted of 18 holes totalling 7,010 
metres to test the lateral and down-dip extensions to a vertical depth of 670 metres. 
A Sperry Sun gyro-log system was used to confirm downhole deviations for 13 of the 
1989 holes and 15 of the pre-existing holes. Additional Placer drilling at Cherbourg 
consisted of five holes totalling 1,437 metres with a further two holes totalling 984 
metres drilled at Foxear. Placer dropped its option due to ongoing litigation between 
Ontex and Metalore. 
 
From 1990 through to 1996, the Brookbank Property was the subject of Superior 
Court of Ontario litigation between Ontex and Metalore [Ontex Resources Ltd. v. 
Metalore Resources Ltd. (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 513 (Gen. Div.), with an appeal 
allowed in part (1993) 13 O.R. (3d) 229, 103 D.L.R. (4th) 158, 12 B.L.R. (2d) 226 
(C.A.)]. Costs were subsequently awarded to Ontex [(1996), 45 C.P.C. (3d) 237 
(Ont. Assmt. Officer)]. 
 
Between 1993 and 1994, Metalore completed four holes totalling 533 metres on the 
Brookbank Zone, fifteen holes totalling 2,107 metres at Cherbourg and seven holes 
(including one wedge) totalling 3,323 metres at Foxear. In 1994, reviews of the data 
by both Micon International Ltd. and J.R. Trussler & Associates, on behalf of 
Metalore, were positive and additional work was recommended by both companies. 
However, the ongoing litigation between Ontex and Metalore precluded work being 
done. 
 
In October 1998, Ontex and Metalore announced a settlement whereby Ontex 
acquired a release of Metalore's right to earn an interest in the Brookbank leases 
and Ontex took over as the operator of the Brookbank Deposit and all of the 
Metalore property in the area.

On December 18, 2009, Ontex and Roxmark announced that their respective 
shareholders had voted in favour of the merger transaction between the two 
companies. In connection with the merger Ontex announced that the shareholders 
approved a one-for-three share consolidation, the election of additional directors and 
a name change from Ontex to Goldstone Resources Inc. (Goldstone).  
 
In June 2011, Premier and Goldstone announced that they had entered into a 
definitive agreement whereby Premier would acquire all of the outstanding common 
shares of Goldstone. Under the terms of the deal, each Goldstone shareholder will 
receive 0.16 of a Premier share plus $0.0001 in cash for each Goldstone share held. 
 
On August 16, 2011, Premier Gold Mines completed the previously announced 
acquisition of Goldstone for approximately $104 million. The acquisition of Goldstone 
allowed Premier to add the Key Lake, Brookbank, Northern Empire and Leitch-Sand 
River Projects to its portfolio of Projects within the Trans-Canada Property as well as 
add the remaining portion of the Hardrock Project it did not hold. 
 

 Production History 

The Brookbank Project area includes the Brookbank, Cherbourg, and Foxear gold 
deposits, and the Irwin prospect, but there has not been any historical production 
from this Project. 
 

 Previous Resource Estimates 

A previous resource estimate on the Brookbank Project was completed in 2009 for 
Ontex Resources Limited by Scott Wilson Mining (now Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle 
Associates Inc.). This resource is summarized in Table 6.2.1 and is contained in a 
Technical Report dated May 4, 2009, and entitled "Technical Report on the 
Brookbank Gold Deposit, Beardmore-Geraldton Area, Northern Ontario, Canada". 
 
The 2009 mineral resource estimate is compliant with CIM standards and definitions 
as required by NI 43-101 and is therefore reportable.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  83 

The parameters used to estimate the mineral resources for the 2009 Technical 
Report are as follows: 
 

 The mineral resource estimate follows CIM definitions and conforms to NI 43-
101. 

 A minimum mining width of 1.5 metres and a minimum grade of 1.0 g/t Au for 
Foxear and 2.0 g/t Au for the other zones were used to build mineralization 
wireframes. 

 High assays were capped at 40 g/t Au for Brookbank, 13 g/t Au for 
Cherbourg, and no capping was required at Foxear. Assays were capped 
prior to compositing. 

 Mineral Resources are estimated using an average long-term gold price of 
US$850 per ounce, and a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1.10. 

 
 

 KEY LAKE 

The following Key Lake section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report on the Mineral Resource Estimates for the Hardrock, Brookbank, and Key 
Lake Projects Trans-Canada Property Beardmore-Geraldton Area Northern Ontario, 
Canada", dated January 30, 2013 and prepared by MICON International Ltd (Lewis 
et al., 2013). 
 
The Key Lake Project area includes the past-producing Jellicoe mine and the 
surrounding area previously drilled by Placer in the 1980s and Cyprus in the 1990s. 
The mineral deposit is a vein with a strike length of about 100 m and average width 
of 0.6 m but the mine workings extend for about 1,000 m along strike at depths less 
than 150 m. 
 
Drilling by Placer in the 1980s identified extensive zones of gold mineralization but 
these were initially considered too low grade to be economic (McCormack, L.V. 
1984). Placer conducted additional drilling in 1990. Subsequently, Cyprus confirmed 
two shallow mineralized shoots with average grades greater than 1 g/t (Gasparetto 
and Stevenson, 1996). Infill drilling by Roxmark in 2010 and 2011 expanded the 
resource and continued to identify long mineralized intervals, such as 1.6 g/t (0.047 
oz/st) over a drilled length of 30 m in KL-11-109 (including 11.9 g/t over 0.3 m), and 
some higher grade intervals, such as 5.6 g/t (0.16 oz/st) over 16.1 m in KL-11-112 
(including 31.6 g/tonne over 1.85 m). There has been essentially no drilling below a 
vertical depth of about 250 m. 
 
The Jellicoe mine within the Key Lake Project area produced 5,620 oz of gold from 
1939 to 1941 and an additional 55 oz in 1949 (Mason and White, 1986). The ore 
body was a vein with a strike length of about 100 m and average width of 0.6 m but 
the mine workings extend for about 1,000 m along strike at depths less than 150 m. 
 
There are no previously published resources for the Key Lake Project.

7. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

 HARDROCK REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock Deposit (according 
to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 

 Archean Superior Province 

The Archean Superior Province (Fig. 7.1.1) forms the core of the North American 
continent and is surrounded by provinces of Paleoproterozoic age to the west, north 
and east, and the Grenville Province of Mesoproterozoic age to the southeast. The 
Archean Superior Province was assembled from continental fragments and 
intervening tracts of oceanic crust between 2.72 and 2.68 Ga. 
 
Tectonic stability has prevailed since approximately 2.6 Ga in large parts of the 
Superior Province. Proterozoic and younger activity is limited to rifting of the 
margins, emplacement of numerous mafic dyke swarms (Buchan and Ernst, 2004), 
compressional reactivation, large-scale rotation at approximately 1.9 Ga, and failed 
rifting at approximately 1.1 Ga. With the exception of the northwest and northeast 
Superior margins that were pervasively deformed and metamorphosed at 1.9 to 1.8 
Ga, the craton has escaped ductile deformation. 
 
A first-order feature of the Superior Province is its linear subprovinces, or "terranes", 
of distinctive lithological and structural character, accentuated by subparallel 
boundary faults (e.g., Card and Ciesielski, 1986). Trends are generally east-west in 
the south, west-northwest in the northwest, and northwest in the northeast. In 
Figure 7.1.1, the term "terrane" is used in the sense of a geological domain with a 
distinct geological history prior to its amalgamation into the Superior Province during 
the 2.72 Ga to 2.68 Ga assembly events, and a "superterrane" shows evidence for 
internal amalgamation of terranes prior to the Neoarchean assembly. "Domains" are 
defined as distinct regions within a terrane or superterrane. 
 
The Hardrock Project is located within the Wabigoon terrane. The Wabigoon terrane 
has long been recognized as a composite terrane comprising volcanic-dominated 
domains with a central axis of variable-age plutonic rocks (Davis and Jackson, 1988; 
Percival et al., 2002; Percival and Helmstaedt, 2004). It consists of distinct western 
and eastern segments.

 The Wabigoon Terrane (Wabigoon Subprovince) 

The Hardrock Project lies within the Wabigoon Subprovince of the Archean Superior 
craton, in eastern Canada (refer to Figure 7.1.2). The Wabigoon granite-greenstone 
subprovince, averaging 100 km wide, is exposed for some 900 km eastward from 
Manitoba and Minnesota, beneath the Mesoproterozoic cover of the Nipigon 
Embayment, to the Phanerozoic cover of the James Bay Lowlands (Card and 
Poulsen, 1998). The Wabigoon Subprovince (Fig. 7.1.2) is bounded on the south by 
the metasedimentary Quetico Subprovince, on the northwest by the plutonic 
Winnipeg River Subprovince, and on the northeast by the metasedimentary English 
River Subprovince. The previously described Wabigoon-Quetico subprovince 
boundary is a structurally complex, largely faulted interface. In the Beardmore-
Geraldton area, this interface consists of thrust-bounded panels that represent 
proximal to distal segments of a southward-prograding wedge of clastic sediments 
floored by oceanic basalt (Devaney and Williams, 1989; Williams, 1990; Tomlinson 
et al., 1996). Tabor and Hudleston (1991) suggested that the boundary fault zones 
may represent a suture between contrasting Quetico and Wabigoon 
tectonostratigraphic terranes with a long history of ductile and brittle deformation 
during complex oblique microplate assembly in a dextral transpressive regime. 
 
The Wabigoon Subprovince consists of about 65% plutonic rocks, mainly in the form 
of lobate batholiths and large gneiss complexes cut by more massive plutons, and 
35% supracrustal rocks, mainly in the form of bifurcating, interconnected greenstone 
belts (Card and Poulsen, 1998). The greenstone belts consist of approximately 60% 
tholeiitic and minor komatiitic volcanic, 30% calc-alkalic and minor shoshonitic / 
alkalic volcanic, and 10% metasedimentary rocks. The subprovince can be 
subdivided into western greenstone-rich domains in the Lake of the Woods-Savant 
Lake and Rainy Lake areas, a central dominantly plutonic domain, and an eastern 
greenstone-rich domain in the Beardmore-Geraldton area (Blackburn et al., 1991). 
There are lithological and geochronological differences between these domains. The 
western Wabigoon Subprovince has volcanic rocks as old as 2775 Ma (Davis et al., 
1988) but most of the volcanism and synvolcanic plutonism occurred in the interval 
2745 to 2711 Ma. These metavolcanic units are overlain by synorogenic turbiditic 
and alluvial-fluvial metasedimentary units. Deformation and syn- to post-tectonic 
plutonism occurred in the interval 2711 to 2685 Ma. The central domain consists 
mainly of gneissic and massive plutonic rocks ranging in age from more than 3.0 Ga 
to less than 2.7 Ga. In addition to Neoarchean greenstone belt rocks, there are also 
Mesoarchean (ca. 2.9 Ga) platform-type supracrustal sequences, notably in the 
Lumby Lake and possibly Steep Rock areas. Based on limited geochronological 
data, the diverse arc-type volcanic sequences in the eastern Wabigoon Subprovince 
are thought to be mainly Neoarchean, some as old as 2769 Ma (Anglin et al., 1988). 
However, model Pb ages suggest that volcanic rocks older than 2.8 Ga may also be 
present. 
 
The western Wabigoon Subprovince comprises a number of interconnected 
greenstone belts consisting of 2775 to 2711 Ma mafic, minor ultramafic, and felsic 
volcanic rocks with 2714 to 2696 Ma clastic, turbiditic, and alluvial-fluvial 
sedimentary rocks (Card and Poulsen, 1998) intruded by 2732 to 2685 Ma granitoid 
batholiths and stocks. The metavolcanic rocks are divisible into thick, laterally 
extensive, mafic sequences that commonly form the lower parts of greenstone belts, 
but also occur at higher stratigraphic positions, and thinner, less extensive, diverse 
assemblages of felsic, intermediate, and mafic metavolcanic rocks that conformably 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  87 

and unconformably overlie mafic sequences and are overlain by metasedimentary 
rocks (Blackburn et al., 1985, 1991). The mafic sequences consist of pillowed and 
massive basalt flows with minor hyaloclastite, komatiite, and interflow chemical and 
clastic sedimentary rocks. The basaltic rocks are tholeiitic and some sequences 
display iron-enrichment trends. Although some have MORB geochemistry and 
display slight LREE enrichment and minor Eu anomalies, most lower mafic 
sequences closely resemble low-K island-arc tholeiite (Gill, 1979; Shirey and 
Hanson, 1986). Synvolcanic mafic-ultramafic intrusions ranging from gabbro dykes 
and sills to layered complexes that grade upward from peridotite and pyroxenite to 
leucogabbro and anorthosite are common. 
 
Greenstone belts in the central Wabigoon Subprovince include sequences of both 
Mesoarchean and Neoarchean ages. Tholeiitic and komatiitic units with subordinate 
felsic metavolcanic rocks in the Armstrong area are intruded by 3075 Ma tonalitic 
rocks (Davis et al., 1988). The Lumby Lake Belt north of Atikokan consists of a 
2999 Ma bimodal mafic-felsic sequence with rare komatiite units overlain by iron-
formation, marble, and quartz arenite. The Steep Rock Group near Atikokan is a 
sequence of conglomerate, stromatolitic marble, hematitic ironstone, and ultramafic 
tuff that unconformably overlies the 3003 Ma Marmion batholith and is overlain, 
probably structurally, by mafic and felsic metavolcanic rocks. 
 
Greenstone belts in the eastern Wabigoon Subprovince include mafic and diverse 
volcanic sequences, including subaerial andesite-rhyolite (Blackburn et al., 1991) 
and shallow-water rhyolitic tuff at least 2764 Ma old (Anglin et al., 1988). These 
sequences are separated by major strike-slip faults and associated conglomeratic 
sedimentary accumulations that are interpreted as pull-apart basin deposits 
(Eriksson et al., 1994). 
 
In addition to the Mesoarchean platform-type sequences, there are extensive 
Neoarchean turbidite sequences lying conformably to disconformably above 
metavolcanic rocks, and alluvial/fluvial sequences deposited unconformably on older 
greenstone and plutonic rocks throughout Wabigoon Subprovince (Card and 
Poulsen, 1998). The facies and age relationship between the turbidite units and the 
alluvial/fluvial sedimentary rocks is problematic. In several areas, alluvial/fluvial 
sedimentary rocks unconformably overlying volcanic rocks are in turn overlain 
conformably by turbiditic sedimentary rocks (Turner and Walker, 1973; Teal and 
Walker, 1977). In other cases, rocks of the two facies associations are separated by 
major faults. 
 
The thick turbidite sequences commonly occur along fault and shear zones, possibly 
representing both thrusts and transcurrent structures (Card and Poulsen, 1998). In 
addition to dominant wacke and conglomerate, they include tuffaceous and reworked 
volcanic members. The alluvial/fluvial sequences consist mainly of coarse 
conglomerate and trough crossbedded sandstone with siltstone and subaerial to 
shallow water volcanic rocks including alkalic trachybasalt and andesitic pyroclastic 
rocks. 
 
According to Card and Poulsen, (1998), plutonic rocks of Wabigoon Subprovince 
include: 1) tonalite-granodiorite gneiss, some older than 3.0 Ga; 2) synvolcanic 
mafic-ultramafic intrusions coeval with mafic volcanism; 3) synvolcanic tonalite, 
trondhjemite, and granodiorite plutons coeval with dacitic volcanism; 4) syn- to post-
tectonic gabbro, diorite, monzonite, granodiorite, syenite, and granite intrusions

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  88 

ranging in age from about 2732 to 2685 Ma; and 5) syntectonic, peraluminous, S-
type granite and associated rare-metal pegmatite. 
 
The structural patterns of the interior portions of Wabigoon Subprovince are formed 
by large elliptical or lobate granitoid complexes separated and surrounded by 
cuspate synformal belts of supracrustal rocks and punctuated by conformable to 
disconformable granitoid stocks (Card and Poulsen, 1998). The supracrustal 
sequences generally dip and face away from the batholith contacts, which are 
commonly zones of high strain with steep foliation and stretching lineation. Away 
from these contacts toward the interior parts of the batholiths, foliation commonly 
dips at low angles forming elliptical structures of various dimensions (Schwerdtner, 
1984). The domal structures in the granitoid complexes have been interpreted as 
diapiric (Schwerdtner et al., 1979). However, it is more likely that most are the result 
of upright folding of earlier-formed subhorizontal fabrics (Percival et al., 1985; 
Schwerdtner, 1990). 
 
The structural patterns of Wabigoon Subprovince are primarily attributable to 
Neoarchean polyphase deformation that began before 2710 Ma and ended after 
2680 Ma (Card and Poulsen, 1998). Formation of early thrust-nappe complexes, 
especially in the subprovince boundary zones, was followed by upright folding and 
faulting in a ductile to brittle, dextral transpressive regime resulting from oblique 
north-south shortening. The isotopic age variations and structural evidence for large 
thrust panels of supracrustal rocks indicate that the Wabigoon Subprovince is a 
complex terrane formed in part by tectonic juxtaposition of lithotectonic assemblages 
of diverse ages and origins. 
 
Low-pressure, greenschist-facies metamorphism in greenstone belt interiors grades 
outward to amphibolite facies in the margins and surrounding metaplutonic rocks 
(Card and Poulsen, 1998). Borradaile (1982) noted that metamorphic isograds 
crosscut fold axial surfaces and also the contacts between supracrustal rocks and 
the older plutonic rocks. Peak Neoarchean metamorphism apparently occurred after 
the major 2714 to 2696 Ma folding and plutonism, and was possibly coeval with the 
late 2701 to 2682 Ma plutonism. Uranium-lead isotopic ages of titanite from a variety 
of rock units, interpreted as the age of metamorphism, range from 2701 to 2638 Ma 
and cluster around 2690 Ma.

 Beardmore-Geraldton Belt (BGB)  

The following description of the geological setting of the Beardmore-Geraldton Belt 
(BGB) is mostly modified and summarized from DeWolfe et al. (2007) and Lafrance 
et al. (2004) except where noted. 
 
The 30 km wide BGB (Fig. 7.1.3) extends for 180 km from Lake Nipigon eastward to 
the town of Longlac. The belt is interpreted as a transitional metavolcanic and 
metasedimentary terrane separating the granite-greenstone Onaman-Tashota Belt 
(OTB) to the north from the metasedimentary Quetico Subprovince to the south 
(Kehlenbeck, 1986). The north boundary of the BGB against the OTB is defined by 
the Paint Lake Shear Zone (Reilly, 1988), and the south boundary of the belt against 
the Quetico Subprovince is delineated by the Blackwater River Fault near 
Beardmore (Shanks, 1993). The OTB consists of ~2980 to 2710 Ma supracrustal 
rocks intruded by ~2920 to 2690 Ma granitoid plutons (Stott et al., 2002). 
Immediately north of the BGB, a succession of felsic and intermediate metavolcanic 
rocks in the OTB, that is, the ~2740 Ma Elmhirst-Rickaby assemblage, was erupted 
in a volcanic arc environment prior to the accretion of the BGB (Tomlinson et al., 
1996; Stott et al., 2002). The Quetico Subprovince comprises 2698 ± 3 to 
2688 ± 4 Ma (Davis et al., 1990) felsic to mafic turbiditic wacke and arenite, which 
correlate with the metasedimentary rocks in the BGB (Percival and Williams, 1989). 
The Quetico rocks are metamorphosed to greenschist facies next to the BGB and to 
granulite facies in the centre of the subprovince (Percival 1989). 
 
The BGB comprises six (6) shear-zone-bounded panels of alternating metavolcanic 
and metasedimentary rocks, designated the Northern, Central, and Southern 
metavolcanic units, and the Northern, Central, and Southern metasedimentary units 
(Tomlinson et al., 1996). All units are east-striking and steeply south-dipping. 
Bedding and pillows generally young to the north (Devaney and Williams, 1989). All 
rocks have undergone at least greenschist facies metamorphism, so for simplicity 
the prefix "meta" will be dropped from the name of the rocks and units. 
 
The volcanic rocks of the BGB consist of flows and pyroclastic rocks of 
predominantly basaltic to andesitic composition (Tomlinson et al., 1996). The 
Northern Volcanic Unit (NVU) (Fig. 7.1.3) consists of a 50 to 1000 m thick 
succession of massive basaltic flows with lesser pillowed amygdaloidal flows, flow 
breccias, and interflow sedimentary rocks. The 1 to 5 km wide Central Volcanic Unit 
(CVU; Fig. 7.1.3) consists of lapilli tuff units, massive flows, and pillowed 
amygdaloidal flows. The 3 km wide Southern Volcanic Unit (SVU; Fig. 7.1.3) differs 
from the CVU by the predominance of massive and pillowed flows. A synvolcanic 
quartz-feldspar porphyry dyke in the NVU and a massive felsic flow in the CVU both 
yielded U-Pb zircon ages of 2724.9 ± 1.2 Ma (Hart et al., 2002), which is the best 
available age estimate for volcanism in the BGB. The volcanic rocks are shown to 
have MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) affinity on geochemical discrimination 
diagrams in Devaney and Williams (1989), who suggested that the three volcanic 
units represent MORB-type oceanic crust on which the younger sedimentary rocks 
were deposited. However, more recent work by Tomlinson et al. (1996) near 
Beardmore suggests that the NVU consists of back-arc tholeiitic basalts and 
andesites, the CVU consists of arc calc-alkaline andesites and dacites, and the SVU 
consists of oceanic crust tholeiitic basalts and andesites. Tomlinson et al. (1996) 
interpreted the three volcanic units as components of an early arc and back arc

system that was accreted to the OTB prior to the deposition of the sedimentary 
rocks. 
 
Sedimentary units in the BGB consist of both clastic and chemical sedimentary 
rocks. The Northern Sedimentary Unit (NSU) (Fig. 7.1.3) is a 100 to 800 m wide belt 
of polymictic conglomerate with minor interlayered feldspathic arenite, feldspathic 
wacke, and mudstone (Mackasey, 1975, 1976; Mackasey et al., 1976). The 2 km 
wide Central Sedimentary Unit (CSU) consists predominantly of interlayered 
feldspathic arenite, feldspathic wacke, and mudstone, with minor polymictic 
conglomerate and oxide facies Iron formation. The 3 to 9 km wide Southern 
Sedimentary Unit (SSU) is similar to the CSU but with fewer conglomerate units and 
more iron formation layers. A preliminary study on detrital zircons from the three 
sedimentary units yielded ages that range from ~2922 to 2696 ± 2 Ma, providing a 
maximum depositional age of 2698 Ma for the units (Hart et al., 2002). 
 
Emplacement of a 2698.6 ± 1.3 Ma albite porphyry stock (U-Pb zircon; Corfu, 2000) 
into iron formation of the SSU at the Hardrock mine site near Geraldton provides a 
minimum age for this unit. The overlap in age between the youngest detrital zircons 
in the sedimentary rocks and primary magmatic zircons in the albite porphyry 
suggest that felsic magmatism occurred shortly after, or during, the deposition of the 
sedimentary rocks. 
 
Sedimentary units of the BGB have been interpreted as comprising a southward 
prograding clastic wedge (Devaney and Fralick, 1985; Devaney and Williams, 1989) 
deposited on an older, previously accreted micro arc and back-arc system 
(Tomlinson et al., 1996). The sediments were derived mainly from the erosion of the 
OTB (Devaney and Williams, 1989). The southern sedimentary unit may also include 
mafic volcanic material and reworked sediments from the northern and central 
volcanic and sedimentary units (Tomlinson et al., 1996). The clastic wedge consists 
of alluvial fan and braided-river deposits of the conglomeratic NSU, which grade 
progressively southward to alluvial deltaic deposits of the CSU, submarine fan 
turbidites of the SSU, and the basin-plain environment of the Quetico (Devaney and 
Williams, 1989). Conglomeratic rocks of the BGB are similar to alluvial-fluvial 
conglomeratic rocks of Timiskaming-type sequences (Thurston and Chivers, 1990) 
but the latter are typically associated with alkalic to calc- alkalic volcanic rocks and 
are younger (2676-2670 Ma; Ayer et al., 2005) than the conglomeratic rocks of the 
BGB.

Subsequent imbrication of volcanic and sedimentary units during D1 thrusting of the 
Wabigoon subprovince over the Quetico subprovince (Davis et al., 1988; Lafrance et 
al., 2004) between 2696 ± 2 Ma (Hart et al., 2002), the maximum depositional age of 
the sedimentary rocks, and 2689.9 ± 1 Ma (Corfu, 2000), the age of the Croll Lake 
stock (Fig. 7.1.3), which cuts the CVU, CSU, and NVU in the eastern part of the belt. 
The BGB was subsequently strongly deformed and transposed during a D2 event, 
which produced east-trending regional F2 folds and an associated S2 axial plane 
cleavage. D2 may have occurred before or during intrusion of the Croll Lake stock 
since the stock is only weakly deformed (Macdonald, 1983a), whereas older 
porphyry dykes and stocks, such as the 2698.6 ± 1.3 Ma albite porphyry stock at 
Hardrock, are folded and transposed parallel to the axial plane of regional F2 folds 
(Pye, 1951; Macdonald, 1988; Lafrance et al., 2004). D2 structures and the 
~2690 Ma Croll Lake stock were later overprinted by a regional S3 cleavage and 
unit-bounding dextral shear zones, which formed during regional D3 transpression 
across the belt (Lafrance et al., 2004). Transpression is recognized in many 
greenstone belts of the western Superior Province and is loosely constrained in age 
between ~2690 and ~2680 Ma across the western Superior Province (Lafrance et 
al., 2004). Hornblende in the Humboldt Bay High Strain Zone, a reactivated shear 
zone located 20 km north of the BGB in the OTB, yields 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages of 
~2690 to ~2660 Ma, which are interpreted as the maximum ages for late D3 dextral 
transpression across the shear zone (Culshaw et al., 2006). 
 

 Local Geological Setting (Geraldton Area) 

The following discussion on the geological setting of the Geraldton area was mostly 
taken from Lafrance et al. (2004) except where noted. 
 
The Hardrock deposit lies within the southern sedimentary unit. The southern 
sedimentary unit in the Geraldton area is characterized by multiple horizons of 
magnetite-rich chert banded iron formation (BIF) within a thick sequence of 
interlayered sandstone-argillite and minor polymictic conglomerate. The sequence is 
intruded by medium- to coarse-grained diorite sills and feldspar-quartz porphyry 
dykes, which, together with the sedimentary rocks, are folded by tight to isoclinal, 
regional F2 folds, e.g., the Ellis Syncline and Hard Rock Anticline (Fig. 7.1.4) (Pye, 
1951; Horwood and Pye, 1951). The folded feldspar-quartz porphyry dykes are near 
parallel to lithological contacts along the limbs of the folds, but they cut across 
bedding and are transposed parallel to cleavage in the hinge of the folds  
(Fig. 7.1.5a). 
 
At the MacLeod-Cockshutt mine, several small isoclinal F1 folds in iron formation 
(Fig. 7.1.5b) are folded by parasitic F2 S-folds on the north limb of the Hard Rock 
Anticline. F2 folds are observed on several outcrops, but few were measured 
because most occur in magnetite-rich chert BIF. They have a strong rod-like coaxial 
lineation, which plunges 20°W to 40°W, subparallel to the strike of the axial plane 
cleavage (S2) of the regional folds. S2 strikes 100° and dips 85°SW. The limbs of 
the regional folds and transposed beds in the hinge of the folds are parallel to S2. In 
polymictic conglomerate, volcanic clasts are stretched parallel to S2 on both vertical 
and horizontal sections, whereas granitic clasts remained equi-dimensional to 
slightly elongate parallel to S2. S2 in the conglomerate's sandstone matrix is defined 
by sericitic and chloritic cleavage planes, which overprint the elongate volcanic clasts 
but wrap around the more competent granitic clasts (Fig. 7.1.5c).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  94 

The Tombill-Bankfield Deformation Zone (Pye, 1952) is a 1 km wide high-strain zone 
that extends from the Hard Rock and MacLeod-Cockshutt mines to the Bankfield 
mine near Highway #11 ( Figure 7.1.4). The deformation zone is parallel to S2, and it 
overprints the Ellis Syncline and Hard Rock Anticline. It is defined by metre-wide, S2-
parallel, dextral shear zones, and by a profusion of F3 Z-folds, plunging 20°W to 
30°W. F3 folds have a steeply dipping cleavage (S3) that crenulates S2 and strikes 
20° to 30° anticlockwise of S2 and transposed bedding. The long axes of elongate 
granitic clasts in polymictic conglomerate are parallel to the axial plane of F3 folds. 
S2 has a strike of 100° in the conglomerate sandstone matrix away from the clasts, 
but as it wraps around the clasts, it changes orientation to that of the elongate 
granitic clasts, resulting in a geometry similar to dextral asymmetrical strain shadows 
around rigid objects (Fig. 7.1.5d). 
 
Shear is distributed heterogeneously across the Tombill–Bankfield deformation zone. 
A shallowly plunging lineation defined by millimetre-wide ridges and grooves in 
deformed feldspar–quartz porphyries, and by chloritic and sericitic streaks in all other 
rock types, occurs along S2 and is folded by F3 folds. Cascades of F3 Z-folds are 
bounded by localized narrow shears parallel to S2 (Fig. 7.1.5e). South of the Hard 
Rock mine and the Mosher mine, the shear deformation is concentrated in 
anastomosing, <20 m wide, chloritic shear zones cutting through dioritic intrusions 
and mafic volcanic rocks. A chloritic schistose foliation in the shear zones is dragged 
in clockwise fashion along a shear foliation oriented parallel to S2. The schistose 
foliation and shear foliation are interpreted as S–C fabrics that formed during dextral 
shear (Buck, 1986; Anglin, 1987). Steeply dipping dextral shear bands oriented 
clockwise of S2 are also indicative of dextral shear (Fig. 7.1.5f). 
 
South of the Tombill–Bankfield Deformation Zone, between the McLellan strippings 
and the Mosher mine, the regional S3 cleavage strongly refracts by 20° to 30° in a 
clockwise fashion from sandstone to argillite beds. North of the deformation zone, S3 
occurs as a weak sporadic cleavage oriented anticlockwise of bedding.

 Stripping 

A stripped outcrop exposing the Tombill-Bankfield Fault and a second larger stripped 
outcrop, informally named the Portal stripping, both show excellent overprinting 
relationships between structures and mineralization along the Tombill-Bankfield 
Deformation Zone, providing new key information. They were mapped in detail in 
2012 (Lafrance et al., 2012; Tòth et al., 2013). The Portal (Fig. 7.1.5) and Tombill–
Bankfield strippings (Fig. 7.1.6) occur in a high-strain corridor that encompasses the 
south limb of the Hard Rock Anticline.  
 
Rocks at both stripped outcrops underwent intense deformation during the D2 event, 
which resulted in the development of a penetrative S2 foliation, and were further 
folded and deformed during D3 dextral transcurrent shear. At the Portal stripping, the 
auriferous quartz veins are pre- or early D3 dextral shear, whereas at the Tombill–
Bankfield Fault stripping, fault-fill veins are either syn-D2 event or early D3 shear and 
sulphide mineralization is syn-D3 dextral shear. This suggests that at least two 
mineralizing events occurred in the Geraldton area. Thus, the ore zones may have 
formed, and were possibly upgraded, during more than one mineralization event. As 
the earliest mineralization event predates F4 and F3 folding, polyphase folding is 
likely an important control on the actual geometry and distribution of the ore zones.

 Mineralization 

The following discussion on mineralization was taken from Smyk et al. (2005). 
 
Gold mineralization in the BGB has resulted from the introduction of hydrothermal 
fluids in zones of high crustal permeability (Smyk et al., 2005). Permeability was 
generated by prolonged, multiple periods of deformation which focused not only 
fluids, but magmatic activity and intrusions. In the Hardrock deposit area, a major 
zone of deformation in which the gold mines are located has been alternatively 
termed the Bankfield-Tombill Fault Zone (Pye, 1951; Horwood and Pye, 1951) or the 
Tombill-Bankfield Deformation Zone (TBDZ) (Lafrance et al., 2004). Horwood and 
Pye (1951) noted that the area adjacent to and north of the TBDZ not only has S-
folds related to the regional folding pattern but also Z-folds. The Z-folds in this area 
only occur along the north side of and proximal to the TBDZ. This led Pye (1951), 
Horwood and Pye (1951) and Buck and Williams (1984) to hypothesize that the 
second deformational event was related to the development of east-trending faults. 
This was confirmed by Lafrance et al., (2004) (their D3) and the faulting was 
attributed to transpression causing dextral shear throughout the region. 
 
Most mineralized occurrences in the Hardrock deposit area lie in a zone of 
deformation to the immediate north of, and genetically linked to, the TBDZ. This zone 
of deformation varies from 600 to 100 m in total width (Fig. 7.1.4), while the crush 
zone of the Bankfield-Tombill Fault proper ranges from metres to hundreds of metres 
in width. The crush zone has been intensely silicified (Pye, 1951), carbonatized 
(Anglin and Franklin, 1985) and contains minor amounts of gold (Pye, 1951). 
Numerous Z-folds on various scales were formed in the deformation zone. 
Auriferous vein systems in the MacLeod-Cockshutt and Hard Rock mines are hosted 
by one of the Z-folds. This structure plunges shallowly west (Horwood and Pye, 
1951) and is mimicked by minor parasitic folds in the BIF. The parasitic Z-folds are 
generally less than 5 m in amplitude (Macdonald, 1982, 1983b) and are commonly 
cut by quartz-carbonate veins subparallel to axial traces. Displacement zones, also 
subparallel to axial traces, developed at lithologic contacts on isoclinal fold limbs, 
also host auriferous veins. Veins parallel to axial planes of folds are relatively straight 
and non-sinuous whereas those orientated at an angle to axial planes of Z-folds are 
highly ptygmatically folded.  
 
Gold mineralization is associated with D3 brittle shear zones and folds overprinting 
regional F2 folds (Lafrance et al., 2004). The plunge of the ore zones is parallel to F3 
fold axes and to the intersection of D3 shear zones with F2 and F3 folds. At the 
deposit scale, the plunge of the ore zones is similar in orientation to the plunge of F3 
axes (e.g., North Zone, MacLeod-Cockshutt Mine; Figure 7.1.8) and F2 folds  
(e.g., F-Zone, MacLeod-Cockshutt Mine; Horwood and Pye, 1951). Lafrance et al. 
(2004) provided an estimate for the age of syn-D3 gold mineralization ranging from 
2686 Ma (i.e., the age of the pre-D3 Ottertail granite in the Rainy Lake district) to 
2640 Ma (i.e., the minimum age for the formation of D3 structures and high-
temperature metamorphism in the Quetico Subprovince; Zaleski et al., 1999). On a 
subprovince scale, regional folds that are cut by D3 dextral shear zones are 
promising targets for discovering the next generation of large gold deposits.

 Style of Gold Mineralization  

The following discussion on the style of gold mineralization was mostly taken from 
Smyk et al. (2005). 
 
Horwood and Pye (1951) classified the MacLeod-Cockshutt orebodies and zones of 
mineralization into three distinct types: 
 

 Quartz veins and mineralized zones; 
 Irregular, massive sulphide-quartz lenses in a folded series of sandstone 

and BIF; and 
 Quartz stringer zones in sandstone and subordinate quartz diorite. 

 
The first ore type, exemplified by the South, No. 210 Quartz Vein, and the Nos. 516, 
517 and 519 Drift zones, is manifested by numerous but small lenses of semi-
massive sulphides (coarse pyrite + arsenopyrite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite) 
scattered along the contacts of intrusions and metasedimentary rocks; by 
disseminated, auriferous sulphides in porphyry; and by minor quartz-carbonate veins 
and stringers cutting both the porphyry and the adjacent metasedimentary rocks. 
 
The second ore type is exemplified by the North, North Limb, South Limb and West 
zones. Ore consists of masses, lenses and tongues of almost massive sulphides that 
replace folded wall rock, particularly laminae of incompetent, sheared sandstone and 
magnetite beds in BIF. Sulphides, principally pyrite and arsenopyrite, also replace 
rocks adjacent to steeply dipping, east-trending shear fractures or shallowly west-
dipping, north-trending tension fractures. Fractures are commonly healed by late(r)-
stage quartz. It was reported that replacement-type ore averaged approximately 0.5 
oz/t Au, while fracture-filling ore typically returned between 1 and 3 oz/t Au. 
The third ore type, best exemplified by the F-Zone, consists of numerous quartz 
veins and stringers localized within a wide zone of shearing and fracturing along the 
northern side of the albite porphyry. The veins and stringers range in width from < 1

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  102 

to 10 cm. They appear to be largely confined to sandstone and lean BIF nearer to 
surface and occur in altered quartz diorite at lower levels to the west. Generally, 
quartz stringers are bordered by buff-coloured, sericitized and carbonatized 
sandstone with fine- to coarse-grained pyrite and subordinate arsenopyrite. In iron-
bearing wall rock, sulphides are more predominant and may form small replacement 
lenses. Although the quartz veinlets contain visible gold, much gold is also 
associated with replacement pyrite and arsenopyrite. 
 
The recently exposed outcrop at the base of the No.1 shaft headframe displays 
highly deformed BIF and sandstone, part of a band that extends 600 m east onto the 
Hard Rock mine property and hosts the North ore zone there. The steeply dipping 
BIF contains primary magnetite, but displays some secondary pyrite in association 
with iron carbonatization and quartz veining.  
 

 Alteration Associated with Mineralization 

The Geraldton gold camp is underlain by a lithologically heterogeneous package of 
rocks with anomalous volumes of mafic and felsic intrusions and BIF. Conglomerate 
occurs along the Bankfield–Tombill shear zone, where most of the gold mines are 
located. All of these rocks are highly strained and have attained lower greenschist 
facies metamorphism. Despite lithological constraints, it can be demonstrated that 
chemical alteration near the gold mines often consists of enrichment in Au, Si, K, Ba 
and CO2 and depletion in Mg and Ca (Lavigne, 2009). 

 
 Identification of Gold Mineralization by Premier Gold 

The most significant result of Premier Gold's drilling has been the identification and 
definition of potentially economic mineralization associated with, or adjacent to, 
mineralized zones in proximity to the Hard Rock and MacLeod-Cockshutt mines as 
summarized in the following sections.  
 
Premier Gold has introduced new nomenclature to label the various subzones of 
mineralization at the Hardrock Project as set out in Table 7.1.1. 
 
 
Table 7.1.1 – Premier Gold nomenclature for zones and subzones in the 
Hardrock deposit 

 
 
 

7.1.9.1 North Iron Formation Area 

Mineralization is mostly sulphide replacement-style associated with the BIF unit to 
the north of the main infrastructure of the Hard Rock and MacLeod-Cockshutt mines. 
While Premier Gold refers to mineralization here as occurring in two different zones 
(EP and NN), all of the mineralization is spatially related to the two past-producing 
North and West zones that were mined in the 1950s.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  103 

 
The North Zone is hosted by magnetite-rich iron formation interlayered with grey to 
green mudstone-sandstone (Tòth et al., 2013). Gold-bearing semi-massive sulphides 
have replaced beds in iron formation and possibly interlayered sandstone and 
mudstone (Figs. 7.1.9b to 9f). The sulphides include pyrite +/- arsenopyrite +/- 
pyrrhotite +/- chalcopyrite. The sulphides surround strongly deformed quartz-
ankerite±chlorite veins with chlorite and/or calcite haloes. Pyrite and arsenopyrite 
overgrow earlier sulphide minerals (pyrite-pyrrhotite), and arsenopyrite is in turn 
locally overgrown by later coarse grained pyrite. Iron formation-hosted mineralization 
is commonly surrounded by sandstone-hosted mineralization (Tòth et al., 2013). The 
latter consists of gold-bearing quartz-ankerite veins with a strong sericite-
carbonate±chlorite alteration halo, alternating with semi-massive sulphide 
(arsenopyrite-pyrite) replacement zones roughly concordant to bedding and foliation. 
Sulphide minerals within the alteration haloes are typically zoned with pyrite adjacent 
to the veins and arsenopyrite more distal to the veins. 
 
Gold occurs as inclusions in pyrite and in fractures cutting through pyrite grains (Tòth 
et al., 2013). As the main foliation (S2?) in drill core commonly wraps around pyrite 
grains and euhedral arsenopyrite crystals occur along the foliation and later 
crenulations cleavage, this suggests that the emplacement and growth of sulphide 
minerals and possibly gold, span several deformation events or was emplaced in an 
active deformation zone with possible remobilization during a younger deformation. 
 

7.1.9.2 Hard Rock Area – Porphyry Hill Area  

Mineralization is present as gold-bearing veins and stringers in a greywacke-BIF 
sequence west or north of, and stratigraphically above, the Hard Rock Porphyry or in 
association with contacts of the Hard Rock Porphyry (what Premier Gold refers to as 
the OP, SP and MM zones). In the South Porphyry (SP) Zone, the mineralization is 
hosted in a greywacke–BIF–porphyry mix and occurs as sulphide replacement and 
as disseminated to stringer sulphides. The main sulphides are pyrite and pyrrhotite 
with trace arsenopyrite. Visible gold is rare. 
 
This is the area that the companies Lac Properties, Asarco Exploration and Cyprus 
Canada drilled to define potential open pit mineralization, and it is loosely analogous 
to the up-plunge extension of the F-Zone that was mined underground from the 
1950s to 1970. It is also described as the Asarco Pit Area. 
 
The F-Zone comprises two main styles of mineralization: sandstone-hosted and 
porphyry hosted mineralization and alteration (Tòth et al., 2013). Sandstone-hosted 
mineralization is characterized by quartz-ankerite±calcite veins with chlorite 
selvages. The veins have a strong yellow-brown sericite-(chlorite?) alteration halo in 
mudstone and a strong carbonate-sericite alteration halo in sandstone. Pyrite +/- 
arsenopyrite +/- pyrrhotite +/- chalcopyrite are present in the veins and in their 
alteration halo. Pyrite and arsenopyrite are commonly coarse-grained and rare free 
gold is locally present in the veins. The veins are typically strongly folded and 
commonly transposed and boudinaged parallel to a bedding-parallel foliation. Typical 
sediment-hosted F-Zone style mineralization is shown on Figure 7.1.9a.

Porphyry-hosted mineralization is characterized by a strong alteration halo of 
carbonate (calcite certainly, ankerite?) and sericite±chlorite surrounding deformed 
quartz-ankerite veins. Gold grades are lower within the porphyry relative to the 
interlayered mudstone-sandstone but alteration is more pervasive and gold is more 
evenly distributed.

7.1.9.3 Hard Rock Area – East Pit Area  

Mineralization is present as gold-bearing veins and stringers mostly in sediments 
east or south of, and stratigraphically below, the Hard Rock Porphyry in the vicinity of 
the A and B zones of the Hard Rock mine (which Premier Gold refers to as the 
Tenacity and Hard Rock zones).  
 

 Identification of Gold Mineralization by InnovExplo 

The interpretation of the mineralized zones was principally based on the litho-
structural model elaborated by InnovExplo prior to the current mineral resource 
estimate mandate. Due to the litho-structural approach used in defining the 
mineralized zones, there is no established correlation between currents zones and 
historical zones. as defined by Premier Gold. InnovExplo identified three distinct 
structural domains (Figs. 7.1.10 to 7.1.13) 
 

 A South Domain characterized by a tightly F2-folded stratigraphic sequence 
consisting of (from top to bottom): 

 
o Upper Greywacke 
o Upper BIF  
o Porphyry 
o Lower BIF  
o Mid Conglomerate 
o Mid Ultramafic 
o Mid Greywacke (including Tenacity Zone) 
o Lower Conglomerate 
o Lower Greywacke 

 
 A Central Domain mainly consisting of an undivided greywacke sequence 

which is likely sheared and folded. Two mineralized zones have been defined 
within the Central Domain to constrain zones of higher grade gold 
mineralization inside the undivided greywacke envelope. They are, from 
south to north, the F-Zone and the Central Zone. The F-Zone is a mineralized 
greywacke domain immediately adjacent to the north contact of the Upper IF 
unit. The Central Zone is adjacent to the south contact of the North IF1 unit.  

 A North Domain consisting of a refolded (F3 overprinting F2) sequence of BIF 
and greywacke, with minor porphyry and gabbros. Three BIF units are 
present, interlayered with undifferentiated greywacke. The North Gabbro is 
located between the two northernmost BIF units, and has been submitted to 
at least the F3 folding episode. From top to bottom, the BIF units are: 

 
o North IF 3 
o North Gabbro 
o North IF 2 
o North IF 1 

 
Gold mineralization occurrence by structural domain is as follows: 
 

 In the South Domain, gold mineralization appears primarily associated with 
the "main" anticline (Hardrock Anticline) and preferentially within both BIFs, 
the porphyry, and the Mid Greywacke (Tenacity Zone).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  106 

 In the Central Domain, gold mineralization is mainly constrained with the F-
Zone and the Central Zone. Gold mineralization also occurs within the 
internal portion the Central Domain, but with lesser grade and continuity. 

 In the North Domain, mineralization appears to be preferentially spatially 
associated with the complex refolded area affecting the BIFs and the North 
Gabbro. Gold mineralization occurs within all rock types but shows a 
preferential association to the BIFs and to the gabbro. 

 The South Gabbro unit marks the southern limit of the deposit and is 
interpreted to be spatially associated with the Tombill-Bankfield Fault, but 
shows no evidence of mineralization.

 BROOKBANK GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 
The following summary descriptions are based primarily on previous Technical 
Reports on projects within the Trans-Canada Property by RCI, 2010 and Micon, 
2011, to which the reader is referred for more detail. 
 

 Regional Geology 

The Trans-Canada Property is located in an Archean age greenstone belt known as 
the Wabigoon sub-province (Wabigoon) of the Superior Structural Province that 
contains several narrow, east-west striking sequences of volcanic and sedimentary 
rocks (Fig. 7.2.1). The southern edges of these sequences are spatially related to 
major structural discontinuities thought to be thrust faults that have imbricated the 
sedimentary sequences. The Wabigoon is a 900 kilometre long, 150 kilometres wide, 
granite-greenstone strip that has been subjected to at least two major structural 
events the first of which is an early aggregation of supracrustal assemblages. The 
second deformation relates to the interaction of the Wabigoon with its neighbouring 
geology; which resulted in contrasting patterns between the interior and margins of 
the sub-province (Blackburn et al., 1991).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  110	

In the Beardmore-Geraldton area, the dominant rock types are clastic sediments 
(greywacke and arenite), oxide facies banded iron formations (BIF) and minor mafic 
volcanics. There are a number of younger intrusives, including an albite-rich 
porphyry unit, known as the Hard Rock Porphyry, which is spatially associated with 
much of the gold mineralization in the Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt, and Mosher 
mines. Significant gold mineralization is also often spatially associated with BIF. In 
the case of the Little Long Lac mine, gold mineralization is primarily hosted by an 
arkosic, or quartz greywacke unit.  
 
In addition to the regional and local faulting, locally intense ductile deformation of the 
rocks in the Geraldton area is manifested as tight to almost isoclinal, generally 
upright, polyharmonic folding of major lithologic units, penetrative deformation, 
folding, and boudinage of veins, lithographic units and local transposition of primary 
contacts. The degree of deformation is highly variable over relatively short distances. 
Strain partitioning with different degrees and styles of deformation is apparent in 
deformed rocks that is dependent on both primary lithology and proximity to the 
Bankfield-Tombill Fault. 
 
Gold mineralization in the Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt, and Mosher mines, and 
the Little Long Lac mine (refer to Figure 7.2.1), generally occurs in association with 
sub-vertical structures associated with quartz veins or stringers, minor to semi-
massive sulphides (associated with replacement zones in BIF), weak to moderate 
carbonate and weak to strong sericite alteration. The mineralized zones rake 
shallowly towards the west in the vicinity of the Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt, and 
Mosher mines, and slightly more steeply towards the west at the Little Long Lac 
mine, indicative of a strong structural control that post-dates the tight folding of the 
primary lithological units. 
 
The gold mineralization occurs in a variety of host rocks and the style of 
mineralization is partly a function of the host rock. While the location and overall 
orientation of the mineralized bodies appears to have been largely structurally 
controlled, the response to deformation of the mineralized zones has not been as 
marked as that of the host rocks. Nevertheless, there are areas where local folding 
and boudinage of mineralized veins is apparent. In addition, there are other strong 
secondary controls that influence the extent and intensity of gold mineralization, such 
as the competency contrast between host rocks (as between the Hard Rock 
Porphyry and its contacts with either greywacke or BIF) and the chemical character 
of the host rocks (for example, oxide facies BIF being replaced by sulphides).

 Local Geology 

The Trans-Canada Property lies near the southern boundary of the east-west-
trending isoclinally folded Wabigoon locally known as the Beardmore-Geraldton 
Greenstone Belt (BGGB). The BGGB is comprised of a metavolcanic-
metasedimentary terrane at the boundary of the eastern Wabigoon Subprovince and 
the Quetico Subprovince. The following description is excerpted from Smyk et al. 
(2005). 
 
The BGGB can be subdivided into six east-striking sub-belts, all of greenschist facies 
metamorphic grade. These are the northern metasedimentary sub-belt (NMB), 
northern volcanic sub-belt (NVB), central metasedimentary sub-belt (CMB), central 
volcanic sub-belt (CVB), southern metasedimentary sub-belt (SMB) and the southern 
volcanic sub-belt (SVB) (Devaney and Williams, 1989). 
 
Although these sub-belts are fault-bounded, current consensus suggests that they 
probably reflect an original sedimentary assemblage deposited on a cratonic margin 
in environments ranging from alluvial fan-braid plain in the NMB, through fan delta-
braid delta in the CMB to a submarine fan/ramp in the SMB. Original continuity of 
this succession is supported by consistent stratigraphic trends and sedimentary 
structures that mostly young to the north. Isoclinal folds notwithstanding, the overall 
structure of the BGGB appears to be initially one of stacked, imbricate, internally 
northward-younging sheets which have been interpreted as the product of 
accretionary wedge tectonics. 
 

7.2.2.1 Igneous Rocks 

Mafic metavolcanic rocks of the SVB consist of massive and pillowed flows, with 
minor tuffs, lapilli tuffs, and tuff breccias with associated interflow chert-magnetite 
iron formations. The CVB consists of intermediate massive and pillowed flows with 
significant tuffs, lapilli tuffs and tuff breccias and minor interflow chert-magnetite iron 
formation. The NVB is subdivided into the northern Bish Bay Assemblage (BBA) and 
southern Poplar Point Assemblage (PPA). 
 
The BBA is composed of east striking mafic pillowed to massive flows and rare tuffs 
resembling the SVB. The PPA consists of northwest striking intermediate flows, tuff 
breccias and tuffs resembling the CVB, with subordinate mafic massive and pillowed 
flows. 
 
A number of igneous rock types intrude the supracrustal rocks of the BGGB. These 
include a series of mafic to ultramafic, synvolcanic rocks, intermediate to felsic 
synvolcanic rocks, mafic post-tectonic intrusions and diabase dykes. The 
synvolcanic gabbroic rocks form thin sills sub-parallel to the strike of the mafic 
metavolcanic rocks of the SVB and the BBA. A large composite intrusion within the 
BBA displays both gabbroic and peridotitic phases in its southern and northern parts, 
respectively. A series of intermediate to felsic dikes and sills, ranging from massive 
granodiorite to quartz-porphyritic, feldspar-porphyritic and feldspar-quartz-porphyritic 
phases, occurs within the metavolcanic rocks of the PPA. These units appear to 
have been emplaced along the regional foliation, although some bodies are sub-
horizontal in orientation. A feldspar-porphyritic granodiorite dike intrudes the mafic 
flows of the SVB and resembles the dikes of the PPA. Late, post-tectonic diorite sills 
predominantly occur within the metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks along the 
contact between the SSB and CVB. Additional intrusions located along the northern

and southern contacts of the PPA are generally undeformed diorite sills that display 
chilled contacts with the metasedimentary rocks. A swarm of narrow, generally north-
striking diabase dikes intrudes the supracrustal rocks and appears to be 
predominantly Paleoproterozoic in age. A series of Mesoproterozoic diabase sills of 
the Nipigon Sill Complex intrude all other supracrustal rocks of the BGGB. 
 

7.2.2.2 Sedimentary Rocks 

The NMB, the northern (uppermost) third of the CMB, and the northernmost portion 
of the SMB are dominated by a conglomeratic assemblage with minor amounts of 
sandstone. The clast-supported conglomerates are poorly to moderately sorted, and 
almost always non-graded with a poorly to moderately sorted sand matrix. Bedding 
is defined by variations in average or maximum clast size between units, but it is 
commonly indistinct. Scouring is locally preserved, but most other primary features 
such as imbrication have been destroyed by deformation. Sandstones interbedded 
with the conglomerates commonly appear massive, but in some outcrops planar 
lamination and cross-stratification are present. They have different forms ranging 
from lenses in conglomeratic beds; thin, irregular sheets blanketing conglomeratic 
beds; wedges abutting conglomeratic beds; and thicker units separating 
conglomerate layers. Clast types in the conglomerates are almost exclusively 
igneous, representing a suite of rocks similar to those present in the Onaman-
Tashota volcanic terrane to the north. 
 
The turbiditic association of the SMB can be divided into a clastic association and a 
chemical association, the latter with a high proportion of oxide-facies, banded iron 
formation (BIF) layers. In the chemical association, clastic interbeds are generally 
less than several centimetres thick, and range in grain size from silt to coarse sand. 
Upward-thickening and upward-coarsening trends over several metres are locally 
present, as at Solomon's Pillars and the Leitch Mine near Beardmore. Within the 
overall upward trend, oscillations between silts, sands, and iron formation occur. 
Depending on the relations between these types of beds, four iron formation 
lithofacies associations (IFLA) can be defined. 
 
Conglomerates contain mainly mafic to felsic volcanic and granitic clasts. Although 
flattened clasts indicate that IFLA outcrops are tectonically thinned, their 
associations are primary, with the conglomeratic units erosively cutting down into 
BIF-sandstone packages. Transitions between various IFLA types can be gradual or 
abrupt. Some silt-sand successions containing iron formation exhibit intervals of 
thicker and well-graded clastic beds. They form structured sections up to several 
metres thick within successions that are otherwise generally disorganized. 
 
Clastic units in the lower two-thirds of the CMB and the SMB are divisible into three 
lithofacies associations: a thin-bedded, turbidite-dominated association (LA2); a 
medium-bedded, turbidite-dominated association (LA3); and a thick-bedded 
association (LA4). LA2 consists mostly of graded, less than 10 cm thick siltstone 
and/or sandstone beds that are either unstructured or thin and fine upwards over one 
metre to three metres. LA3 is divisible into two types, LA3a and LA3b. LA3a consists 
of medium- to coarse-grained sandstones with sharp bottom and top contacts. 
Parallel lamination is present near the tops of some of the otherwise massive beds. 
These successions are unstructured. LA3b is similar to LA3a except these beds are 
organized into either upward-thickening or upward-thinning trends. Thick, poorly 
graded sandstones dominate LA4. The beds typically have a coarse sand or pebbly

base, grading into a thick, poorly sorted, massive central area. They are often 
abruptly capped by thin, fine-grained sandstone. Irregular, erosional bases and 
scattered rip-up clasts are common. 
 
Structured, upward-thinning and upward-fining sequences, metres to tens of metres 
thick, are present in the area south of Beardmore. The successions are topped by 
Bouma-style CDE and/or DE turbidites (where C is a cross-laminated sand unit, D is 
a parallel laminated silt unit and E is a mud layer). These are abruptly overlain by 
massive grain flows/high-density turbidites with internal inverse- to normal-graded, 
conglomeratic bands. Pebbles present in the conglomerates are mainly felsic 
igneous rocks (extrusive and intrusive), while rip-up clasts are not the expected 
mudstone or siltstone, but rather clay- and silt-rich, fine-grained sandstone. 
 
Load structures are ubiquitous throughout the area. Commonly, the base of one unit 
sags into the underlying beds. Locally, multiple internal loads are developed, usually 
in the B division (parallel laminated sands). These loads sag into the A division 
(sands and/or coarser-grains), in places extending into the underlying beds. 
 

7.2.2.3 Structure 

After deposition of the clastic succession, the area was subject1ed to thrust faulting, 
regional folding and dextral shearing. Thrust faulting imbricated the regional volcanic 
and sedimentary packages into thrust stacks (Devaney and Williams, 1989). This D1 
thrusting may be associated with uncommon, early, F1 folds. The youngest detrital 
zircon recovered from the sedimentary units is 2690 ±2 Ma and this places a 
maximum age on the thrusting event. 
 
The D2 event is characterized by tight to isoclinal folds and a flattening strain fabric 
identified by transposed bedding and flattened clasts and/or pillows. A homoclinal, 
north-younging sequence of regional extent developed at this time and it appears to 
represent the sheared-off southern limb of a larger syncline. D2 deformation also 
affects altered and gold-mineralized porphyry dykes in the syn-tectonic Croll Lake 
stock which has a U¬Pb age-date of 269 1+3/-2 Ma. An age of 2699±1 Ma for a 
gold-mineralized feldspar porphyry dyke at the Hardrock Mine and identical ages of 
2690±1 Ma for two phases of the Croll Lake stock put constraints on the timing of 
major deformation and hydrothermal activity in the belt. 
 
The final event, D3, occurred as regional transpression developed in the 
compressive framework of the area. Vertical bed orientations developed during D2 
did not refold but rather were overprinted by a steeply dipping, regional cleavage. 
Partitioning of the strain, during east-west dextral shear, between less competent 
argillites and more competent sandstones and porphyries resulted in cleavage 
refraction near lithological contacts. The pervasive cleavage developed in the Paint 
Lake shear zone at this time shows a progressive rotation towards the orientation of 
the zone. This is in contrast to the Barton Bay Lithotectonic Zone (BBLZ) where the 
S2 fabric was reactivated to accommodate the D3 shear. Some folds were 
generated during this interval but they tend to be smaller Z-folds, overprinting limbs 
of regional F2 folds. Shear zones active at this time were dextral with nearly 
horizontal displacements.

 BROOKBANK PROJECT GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

 Geology 

The project gology is summarized in Figure 7.2.2. 
 
The following is an excerpt from Thompson (2006). 
 
The Brookbank Project is underlain predominantly by east-west trending and steeply 
south to vertically dipping metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. Metavolcanic 
rocks consist of massive and pillowed, locally amygdaloidal, flows of basaltic 
composition along with related tuffaceous rocks. Pillowed flows exhibit tops to the 
north. They are locally intercalated with coarser-grained rocks of similar composition 
that have been interpreted as either intrusions or coarse-grained phases at the 
centre of thicker basaltic flows. The metavolcanic rocks are locally intruded by 
quartz-feldspar porphyritic dykes. 
 
Mafic metavolcanic rocks are fault-bounded against domains of metasedimentary 
rocks. The northern domain consists of polymictic conglomerate with pebble- to 
boulder-sized, rounded to subrounded clasts in a feldspar-quartz-sericite matrix. 
Clasts consist of volcanic and intrusive rock types of various compositions, quartz 
pebbles and jasper, the latter suggesting affinity with Timiskaming Formation 
conglomerates in the Timmins (Porcupine) Mining District. 
 
Metasedimentary domains south of Windigokan Lake also contain polymictic 
conglomerate as well as feldspathic and quartzose sandstone and wacke, siltstone, 
minor argillite and hematitic iron formation. 
 
Felsic to intermediate pyroclastic rocks and flows occur in the north part of the 
property and are fault-bounded with mafic metavolcanic rocks across the Paint Lake 
Fault. They consist of tuff breccia, pyroclastic breccia and tuff, and massive to 
porphyritic rhyolite flows. 
 
Intermediate to mafic intrusions cut the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks in 
the central part of the Brookbank Property. They consist of quartz diorite, diorite and 
gabbro. North-trending, flat-lying, locally porphyritic diabase dykes of Keweenawan 
age cut the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks along the western boundary of 
the property in Sandra Township and along the western boundary of Irwin Township. 
 
The Brookbank Project is transected by an east-west trending zone of extensive 
heterogeneous brittle and ductile deformation and hydrothermal alteration and is 
referred to as the "Brookbank Shear Zone". Deformation is locally in excess of one 
kilometre wide and consists of anastomosing bands of intense fissile shearing, 
quartz veining and fracturing with associated ductile deformation around domains of 
less deformed metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The deformation can be 
traced for a minimum of ten kilometres along strike through Irwin Township and 
remains open in either direction.

 Mineralization 

The 6.5 kilometre long Brookbank shear zone hosts the Brookbank, Cherbourg, and 
Foxear deposits. The deposits occur along lithological contacts between mafic 
volcanics and metasediments. Other areas of gold mineralization are present in one 
or more of the localized deformation bands within the hanging wall mafic volcanics, 
which are generally parallel to the Brookbank main zone within the Brookbank shear 
zone structure. 
 
The zones of mineralization at Brookbank, Cherbourg, and Foxear occur within one 
of several bands of intense deformation and hydrothermal alteration at or near the 
contact between domains of mafic flows and polymictic conglomerate. Hydrothermal 
alteration in the vicinity of the mineralization consists of silicification, carbonatization, 
sericitization, chloritization, hematization and sulphidization. This alteration is 
commonly marginal to quartz-carbonate veins, fractures, and stockworks and may 
exceed 50 metres in width locally. 
 
Mineralogical studies indicate that the precious metal mineralization consists of gold-
silver particles with an approximate gold to silver ratio of 80:20. The gold occurs 
primarily as late fracture-controlled mineralization. The mineralization forms elongate 
lenticular particles associated with grain boundaries and possibly crystallographic 
planes. The gold generally consists of fine grained free gold particles, although there 
is very little visible gold even in areas of plus 30 g/t Au assays. Gold values are 
highest in the quartz –carbonate veinlets/stringers. 
 
Sulphide mineralization (pyrite and minor chalcopyrite) is also present within the 
sheared host and quartz veinlets. 
 

 KEY LAKE PROJECT GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

The following Key Lake section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report on the Mineral Resource Estimates for the Hardrock, Brookbank, and Key 
Lake Projects Trans-Canada Property Beardmore-Geraldton Area Northern Ontario, 
Canada", dated January 30, 2013 and prepared by MICON International Ltd (Lewis 
et al., 2013). 
 

 Geology 

The Key Lake Project is located within the Beardmore-Geraldton Greenstone Belt of 
the Wabigoon Subprovince of the Superior Province. The project area is within the 
southern metasedimentary sub-belt on the southern limb of a west-plunging syncline. 
The mineralized zone at Key Lake is 550 to 800 m northeast of the Tombill-Bankfield 
Fault and diverges from it toward the west. It is about 2.5 km south of the contact 
with the central metavolvanic sub-belt. 
 
Metagreywacke is the predominant rock type in the project area and occurs in a 
series of turbidites. A thick section of fine to coarse-grained altered wacke has been 
logged as arkose and hosts most of the gold mineralization. A bed with granule- to 
pebble-size clasts may be a matrix-supported metaconglomerate or a vitric lapilli tuff. 
Magnetite-rich argillite occurs to the north and south of the mineralized zone. 
Banded iron formations may occur farther north.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  118	

The metasedimentary rocks have been intruded by one or more thin (0.5 to 3 m) 
porphyriticaphanitic felsic dikes which are spatially related to gold mineralization. 
Gabbro and diorite dikes occur in some areas and Proterozoic diabase dikes cross-
cut all other rock units. 
 

 Mineralization 

Gold occurs in altered metagreywacke (arkose) and felsic dikes and in thin veins 
cutting these rocks. Gold-bearing altered rocks typically have more than trace 
amounts of pyrite and/or arsenopyrite. Sphalerite and silver were reported by Mason 
and White (1986). Accessory chalcopyrite has been identified in some holes. A 
variety of veins are present including quartz with angular bits of white carbonate 
typically along vein margins, white and gray massive quartz, and dark grey veinlets 
usually less than 3 mm thick composed of quartz and/or very fine grained 
arsenopyrite. Visible gold occurs in veins in both metagreywacke and felsic dikes but 
is not common and rarely occurs in wall rock. 
 
Alteration occurs within and extends beyond the zone of gold mineralization. 
Widespread dolomite/ankerite alteration was detected by staining (Gasparetto and 
Stevenson, 1996). 
 
Zones of greenish, brownish, and rarely yellowish sericitization are more limited and 
envelope all but a small fraction of the gold mineralization. Silicification is more 
limited still and is a very good indicator of gold mineralization. However, a significant 
proportion of the gold mineralization does not occur in silicified rocks.

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

 HARDROCK 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock Deposit (according 
to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 

 Epigenetic Banded Iron-Formation-Hosted Gold Deposits 

This discussion on deposit types was mostly taken from Kerswill (1993). Gold 
deposits in the Hardrock deposit area are classic examples of epigenetic non-
stratiform banded iron formation (BIF)-hosted gold deposits (historical North Zone 
and West Zone).  
 
Important common features of BIF-hosted gold deposits include a strong association 
between native gold and iron sulphide minerals, the presence of gold-bearing quartz 
veins and/or shear zones, the occurrence of deposits in structurally complex 
terranes, and the lack of lead and zinc enrichment in the ores. Banded Iron-formation 
(BIF)-hosted gold deposits have several important common features but can be 
usefully divided into stratiform and non-stratiform types on the basis of empirical 
(non-genetic) characteristics. 
 

 Stratiform Type 

In stratiform deposits, much of the gold is uniformly disseminated in thin, but laterally 
continuous, well- laminated units of cherty, sulphide-rich BIF that are conformably 
interlayered with gold- and sulphide- poor BIF [iron-carbonate- and (or) iron-silicate-
bear- ing] and clastic sedimentary rocks. For the purpose of this section, sulphide-
rich BIF is defined as banded iron-formation that contains more than 5 modal% of 
iron sulphide and/or arsenide minerals (pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and/or 
Iollingite), and is referred to as sulphide BIF. The term sulphide BIF is thus purely 
descriptive and, as such, does not have genetic implications. Stratiform orebodies 
are as deformed or more deformed than associated rocks; iron-sulphide minerals 
show effects of deformation and metamorphism. Oxide BIF is lacking, irrespective of 
metamorphic grade. Late quartz veins and/or shear zones are a volumetrically 
significant component in the ores, but their control on the distributions of gold and 
iron-sulphide minerals is equivocal. Arsenic-bearing minerals such as arsenopyrite 
and lollingite, if present, are generally restricted to alteration zones immediately 
adjacent to late quartz veins. The correlation between gold and sulphur is typically 
much stronger than between gold and arsenic, because much of the gold occurs in 
arsenic-poor sulphide BIF that is relatively distant from late structures. 
 
 Orebody-scale alteration is lacking, and vein-related assemblages are commonly 
chlorite-rich but carbonate-poor. These ores are silver-rich relative to non-stratiform 
ores; gold grains characteristically have gold/silver ratios between 3.0 and 7.0. 
Deposits are rare, can be very large and, compared with non-stratiform deposits, are 
less difficult to evaluate and mine. Although examples are few, they include Lupin 
(Canada), Jardine (U.S.A.), Morro Velho (Brazil), Cuiaba (Brazil), probably 
Homestake (U.S.A.), Agnico-Eagle (Canada) and possibly Vubachikwe (Zimbabwe).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  120	

Stratiform deposits contain sulphide-rich alteration zones immediately adjacent to 
late structures. These alteration zones are generally characterized by arsenic- 
bearing minerals (arsenopyrite and/or shear lollingite) and chlorite. Stratiform ores 
are characteristically sulphide-rich and well laminated. The distribution of the well-
laminated variety of sulphide BIF that characterizes stratiform deposits is apparently 
not controlled by large- or small-scale folds, by late quartz veins or by shear zones. 
Sulphide BIF in stratiform occurrences possesses several features that suggest the 
ores have undergone deformation and metamorphism. 
 

 Non-Stratiform Type 

In non-stratiform deposits, gold is restricted to late structures (quartz veins and/or 
shear zones) and/or shear sulphide BIF immediately adjacent to such structures. Ore 
is confined to discrete, commonly small, shoots separated by barren (gold- and 
sulphide-poor), typically oxide BIF. Orebodies are generally less deformed than 
associated rocks; iron-sulphide minerals are in many cases relatively undeformed 
and unmetamorphosed. Pyrite and/or shear pyrrhotite have clearly replaced other 
pre-existing iron-rich minerals, notably magnetite. Arsenic-bearing minerals are 
common, but not always present; if they are present, a strong positive correlation 
generally exists between gold and arsenic. Orebody-scale alteration occurs and is 
usually typical of that associated with "mesothermal vein" gold deposits. Ores are 
relatively silver-poor, and gold grains generally have gold/silver ratios of >8.0. 
Deposits are relatively common, typically small and, compared with stratiform 
deposits, difficult to evaluate and mine. Examples of non-stratiform deposits are the 
North ore zone at the MacLeod-Cockshutt mine, the Central Patricia mine and 
portions of the Pickle Crow mine (all in Canada), numerous deposits in Western 
Australia, including the Hill 50, Nevoria and Water Tank Hill mines, and several 
deposits in Zimbabwe, including the Lennox Mine. 
 
Non-stratiform deposits contain sulphide-rich alteration zones immediately adjacent 
to late structures and deposits are similar to mesothermal vein-type gold ores. Late 
quartz veins and/or shear zones are present in most known BIF-hosted gold 
deposits. Their occurrence is an obvious exploration guide for non-stratiform ores, 
particularly if concentrations of gold and iron-sulphide minerals are spatially and 
genetically linked to the late structures. Complex folds are characteristic of many 
BIF-hosted gold deposits and may be viewed as a positive feature in evaluating 
exploration targets. The distributions of gold-bearing veins and sulphide-rich zones 
are commonly controlled by fold structures. Major faults ("breaks") of regional scale 
have been recognized near many non-stratiform deposits. 
 
Irregular, massive lenses of sulphides and quartz occur in a folded series of 
greywacke and iron formation in the Hard Rock and MacLeod-Cockshutt mines 
(Horwood and Pye, 1951). These massive replacement lenses (up to 65%, 
sulphides) cut the Z-folded iron formation and are related to quartz-carbonate veins 
up to 0.6 metres wide. Veins are usually barren of gold mineralization except where 
they contain sulphides, consisting primarily of pyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. 
Mineralization is preferentially concentrated in the wall rocks outward from the quartz 
veins and ore is locally banded due to the selective replacement of the less 
competent wacke laminae in the iron formation by sulphides. The main ore zone (the 
North or No. 30 Zone, and the West Zone), mined in the Hard Rock and MacLeod-
Cockshutt mines, was of this type (Horwood and Pye, 1951). The grade from these

zones was generally higher than the grades in the larger F-Zone (associated with 
greywacke). 

 
 Greenstone-Hosted Quartz-Carbonate Vein Deposits 

Greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits occur as quartz and quartz-
carbonate veins, with valuable amounts of gold and silver, in faults and shear zones 
located within deformed terranes of ancient to recent greenstone belts commonly 
metamorphosed at greenschist facies (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007). Greenstone-
hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits are a subtype of lode gold deposits (Poulsen 
et al., 2000) (Fig. 8.1.1). They are also known as mesothermal, orogenic. They 
consist of simple to complex networks of gold-bearing, laminated quartz-carbonate 
fault-fill veins in moderately to steeply dipping, compressional brittle-ductile shear 
zones and faults, with locally associated extensional veins and hydrothermal 
breccias. They can coexist regionally with iron formation-hosted vein and 
disseminated deposits, as well as with turbidite-hosted quartz-carbonate vein 
deposits (Fig. 8.1.2). They are typically distributed along reverse-oblique crustal-
scale major fault zones, commonly marking the convergent margins between major 
lithological boundaries such as volcano-plutonic and sedimentary domains. These 
major structures are characterized by different increments of strain, and 
consequently several generations of steeply dipping foliations and folds resulting in a 
fairly complex geological collisional setting.

Figure 8.1.2 – Schematic diagram illustrating the setting of greenstone-hosted 
quartz-carbonate vein deposits (from Poulsen et al., 2000) 
 
 
The crustal scale faults are thought to represent the main hydrothermal pathways 
towards higher crustal level. However, the deposits are spatially and genetically 
associated with higher order compressional reverse-oblique to oblique brittle-ductile 
high-angle shear zones commonly located less than 5 kilometres away and best 
developed in the hanging wall of the major fault (Robert, 1990). Brittle faults may 
also be the main host to mineralization as illustrated by the Kirkland Lake Main 
Break; a brittle structure hosting the 25 Moz Au Kirkland Lake deposit. The deposits 
formed typically late in the tectonic-metamorphic history of the greenstone belts 
(Groves et al., 2000) and the mineralization is syn- to late-deformation and typically 
post-peak greenschist facies and syn-peak amphibolite facies metamorphism (cf. 
Kerrich and Cassidy, 1994; Hagemann and Cassidy, 2000). 
 
Stockworks and hydrothermal breccias may represent the main host to the 
mineralization when developed in competent units such as granophyric facies of 
gabbroic sills. Due to the complexity of the geological and structural setting and the 
influence of strength anisotropy and competency contrasts, the geometry of the vein 
network varies from simple such as the Silidor deposit, Canada, to more commonly 
fairly complex with multiple orientations of anastomosing and/or conjugate sets of 
veins, breccias, stockworks and associated structures (Dubé et al., 1989; Hodgson, 
1989, Robert et al., 1994, Robert and Poulsen, 2001). 
 
Ore-grade mineralization also occurs as disseminated sulphides in altered 
(carbonatized) rocks along vein selvages. Ore shoots are commonly controlled by: 1) 
the intersections between different veins or host structures, or between an auriferous 
structures and an especially reactive and/or competent rock type such as iron-rich 
gabbro (geometric ore shoot); or 2) the slip vector of the controlling structure(s) 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  123	

(kinematic ore shoot). For laminated fault-fill veins, the kinematic ore shoot will be 
oriented at a high angle to the slip vector (Robert et al., 1994; Robert and Poulsen, 
2001). 
 
At the district scale, the greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate-vein deposits are 
associated with large-scale carbonate alteration commonly distributed along major 
fault zones and associated subsidiary structures (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007). At the 
deposit scale, the nature, distribution and intensity of the wall-rock alteration is 
largely controlled by the composition and competence of the host rocks and their 
metamorphic grade. Typically, the alteration haloes are zoned and characterized, at 
greenschist facies, by iron-carbonatization and sericitization with sulphidation of the 
immediate vein selvages (mainly pyrite, less commonly arsenopyrite). 
 
The main gangue minerals are quartz and carbonate with variable amounts of white 
micas, chlorite, scheelite and tourmaline. The sulphide minerals typically constitute 
less than 10% of the ore. The main ore minerals are native gold with pyrite, 
pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite without significant vertical zoning. (Dubé and Gosselin, 
2007) 
 
The structurally controlled, high grade veins spatially related to the Hard Rock 
Porphyry (what Premier Gold refers to as the OP, SP and MM zones) in the Hard 
Rock and MacLeod-Cockshutt mines are similar to quartz-carbonate-sericite veins 
that host gold in many gold camps in Ontario (Porcupine, Kirkland Lake and Red 
Lake). The veins related to the Hard Rock Porphyry do not host significant tonnages 
of ore from past production, despite their locally high grades. Numerous thin, gold-
bearing quartz stringers occur along shear fractures in zones of faulting, folding and 
shearing at the contact with wacke and Hard Rock Porphyry. When stringers merge, 
elongate replacement or blow-out lenses up to 1 meter long are formed. Normally, 
they occur as thin highly contorted veinlets which follow both shear and tension 
fractures and locally have a gash-like character. Carbonate (ankeritic-dolomite), 
sulphides (pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite) and tourmaline are found 
to be associated with the quartz. Zones A through H were of this type. (Horwood and 
Pye, 1951) 
 
The greywacke (turbidite) associated mineralization is typically characterised by 
narrow, often sheeted, millimetre- to centimetre-scale veins with attendant but highly 
variable degrees of carbonate-sericite-pyrite alteration. This style of mineralization 
forms wide, low grade zones in the former Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt and 
Mosher mines. The F-Zone was the most spectacular zone, accounting for an 
orebody of some 10,000,000 tons at 0.15 oz/t Au (Macdonald, 1983b). The F-Zone 
produced the bulk of the tonnage that came from these mines from the 1950s to 
1970. 
 

 BROOKBANK  

The following description of the deposit types for the Trans-Canada Property has 
been extracted from the March 30, 2010 technical report by RCI. 
 
Economic concentrations of gold in the Geraldton area are typical of Archean 
epigenetic hydrothermal gold deposits normally considered to be mesothermal lode 
gold deposits. The gold mineralization is primarily located in areas of high strain and 
deformation with brittle structures providing a pathway and also hosting 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  124	

mineralization as veins or replacement zones with associated alteration. There are 
also low grade zones that locally have less obvious structural control, less veining, 
and less intense hydrothermal alteration on a hand specimen scale, but these clearly 
have strong deposit scale structural controls. 
 
Despite the strong structural control, there is clearly a significant secondary 
lithological control that has influenced the deposition of gold in Geraldton. There are 
some types of ore that therefore would fall into certain deposit type classes on the 
basis of host rock and vein/alteration characteristics. These would include deposit 
types listed by Poulsen et al. (2000) as: 
 

 Greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein (Hard Rock Porphyry area). 
 Turbidite-hosted quartz-carbonate vein (Little Long Lac, F Zone). 
 Iron-formation hosted vein and disseminated (North Zone and West Zone in 

the North Iron Formation). 
 
The structurally controlled, high grade veins spatially related to the Hardrock 
Porphyry are similar to quartz-carbonate-sericite veins that host gold in many gold 
camps in Ontario (Porcupine, Kirkland Lake, and Red Lake). The veins related to the 
Hard Rock Porphyry do not host significant tonnages of ore from past production, 
despite their locally high grades. These types of veins are typified by zones A to H of 
the Hard Rock Mine (Mason and White, 1986). However, much of the low grade 
mineralization in sedimentary rocks (below) is spatially related to the folded nose of 
the Hard Rock Porphyry and not a great distance from the high grade veins. 
 
The greywacke (turbidite) associated mineralization is typically characterized by 
narrow, often sheeted, mm-cm scale veins with attendant but highly variable degrees 
of carbonatesericite-pyrite alteration. This style of mineralization forms wide, low 
grade zones in the former Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt, and Mosher Mines. The 
F Zone was a very large bulk mineable zone, according to Macdonald (1983) 
"accounting for an orebody of some 10,000,000 tons of 0.15 ounce gold per ton." 
The F Zone produced the bulk of the tonnage that came from these mines from the 
1950s to 1970. The sheeted and narrow veins found in the Little Long Lac Mine were 
hosted by what is termed arkose. The grade here (0.34 opt Au) was substantially 
higher than that in the sediment (greywacke) hosted ore at the Hardrock, MacLeod-
Cockshutt and Mosher Mines. 
 
The iron-formation hosted mineralization is similar to that in Archean age gold mines 
elsewhere in Ontario (Musselwhite and Dona Lake Mines) and elsewhere in northern 
Canada (Lupin, Meadowbank, and Meliadine Mines). This mineralization is typically 
in the form of sulphidized zones on a cm-m scale associated with minor quartz veins 
that transect iron formation beds. The grade from these zones (the North Zone of 
Hard Rock and the West Zone of MacLeod-Cockshutt) was generally higher than the 
grades in the larger F Zone. The North Zone of the Hard Rock Mine was exploited 
from 1938 to 1948 (at which time the known zone was and recovered gold was in the 
0.20 o/t Au range. The West Zone of the MacLeod-Cockshutt Mine was reported to 
grade 0.5 o/t Au but, due to dilution, the recovered grade was 0.224 o/t Au (Horwood 
and Pye, 1951, pg. 84). 
 
According to Smyk et al., (pg. 27, 2005) "although Geraldton is often considered to 
be a BIF-hosted gold camp, it is important to note that less than 30% of the gold 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  125	

came from BIF hosted ore (Macdonald, 1982). Most of the production came from 
clastic sedimentary rocks, particularly at or near the contact with feldspar porphyry 
intrusions. Anglin and Franklin (1985) cited a more consistent spatial relationship 
between gold mineralization, deformation zones, and felsic intrusive rocks." 
 
The mineralization on the Brookbank Project occurs within quartz-carbonate 
veinlets/stringers, fractures and/or stockworks associated with hydrothermal 
alteration. The latter is generally located within bands of intense deformation at the 
contacts between domains of mafic flows and polymictic conglomerate. 
 
Taking into account the deposit models discussed above, previous and current 
exploration activities have been/are focused on the contact zone between the 
sedimentary formation and the volcanic assemblage. This contact zone occurs within 
a broad shear zone that strikes roughly east-west for approximately 6.5 kilometres. 
 

 KEY LAKE 

The Key Lake deposit consists of several lenticular bodies in en-echelon 
arrangement following a north-westerly direction. The mineralization is of a 
volcanoclastic-exhalative nature. Post mineralization processes have concentrated 
the mineralization into isolated high grade patches/pockets.

9. EXPLORATION 

 HARDROCK 

Exploration work performed by Premier Gold before 2014 was summarized in 
Section 6.0 (History). 
 
Since June 1, 2014, Premier Gold has been stripping in the 2014 resource area, east 
of MacLeod Shaft No. 1. The work consists of three strippings with detailed 
geological mapping and channel sampling. The channels are 5 metres apart in the 
E-W direction and sampled to the extent of the outcrop every 1m. The purpose of 
this work is to verify and establish structural elements and grade continuity at 
surface. The newly collected assay results will help confirm dilution factors and 
convert indicated resources into measured resources. Assay results were pending 
and were not used at the time of the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate update. 
 
During 2014, a total of 128 mechanical test pits were completed on the Hardrock 
project to evaluate the overburden thickness. Results of these test pits were not 
used in the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate Update. 
 

 BROOKBANK 

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 
Exploration on the Brookbank Project dates back to the mid-1930s. The historical 
exploration and drilling on the project is described in Section 6 of this report. From 
1999 till 2009, all exploration on the property was conducted by Ontex Resources 
Limited (Ontex). The most significant of all of Ontex's exploration programs was 
achieved in September 1999 when Geoterrex-Dighem Ltd. completed a combined 
helicopter borne magnetic, VLF-EM and radiometric survey along 1,807 line 
kilometres over the entire property in a north-south direction. The airborne program 
included the collection and delivery of total field and calculated vertical gradient 
magnetics, VLF-EM, resistivity, and radiometrics K/Th/U ratio. The results are 
summarized in Figure 9.2.1. 
 
The airborne survey results are reflective of geology and favourable structure and 
alteration but are not a direct guide to mineralization. The Brookbank Deposit 
geophysical signature is very subtle and is too subdued to be a reliable guide to the 
direct location of further mineralization along the favourable structural break between 
known gold zones. The geophysical signature, however, can be used to locate 
alteration on structural breaks that might contain mineralization. 
 
The geophysical targets shown in Figure 9.2.1 have been used to guide the test-
drilling and evaluation programs that have been completed on the Brookbank Project 
to date. Almost all of the completed drilling is in the central part of the claims area. 
Other targets to the east and west of the Brookbank-Cherbourg-Foxear zone remain 
to be investigated in greater detail.

10. DRILLING 

 HARDROCK 

 Drilling and re-sampling included in the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate 

update 

Information in this section was obtained from the Premier Gold exploration team and 
combined with InnovExplo's database compilation. 
 
On the Hardrock deposit, a total of 86,500 m of additional infill drilling was used in 
the 2014 updated mineral resource estimate, which corresponds to completed and 
validated diamond drill holes at the close-out date of May 26, 2014 (Table 10.1.1). 
Between August 10, 2013 and May 26, 2014, Premier Gold added one hundred 
eighty-two (182) diamond drill holes on the Hardrock deposit for a total 79,260.3 m. 
Thirteen (13) diamond drill holes from 2013 were also deepened in 2014 
representing a total of 2,867.3 m of new footage.  
 
Seven (7) historical diamond drill holes were resampled to add new assay results in 
the 2014 updated mineral resource estimates. These holes were not previously 
sampled and had therefore been rejected from the 2013 database (Brousseau et al., 
2013). These holes represent a total of 5,709 m of new footage in the 2014 
database. Additional resampling was also completed on six (6) historical drill holes. 
Table 10.1.1 presents the details of the new footage for the 2014 Mineral Resource 
Estimate Update.

resource estimate 

 
 
 
In 2013 and 2014, Premier Gold carried out two small drilling programs in the area of 
the past producing Bankfield mine. The Bankfield mine is located on the Hardrock 
Project in the west-central part of Errington Township, extending into Lindsley 
Township and enclosing the southwest part of Magnet Lake. This historical mine is 
situated about 10 km west-southwest of the Town of Geraldton. Between December 
15, 2013 and January 24, 2014, two (2) diamond drill holes were drilled for a total of 
1,043 m. Between April 22, 2014 and May 17, 2014, six (6) diamond drill holes were 
added in this area totalling 2,513 m. These holes were not included in the 2014 
mineral resource estimate as they are located outside the resource area of the 
Hardrock deposit. 
 
From August to December 2014, Premier Gold completed 36,213 m of additional 
drilling on the Hardrock Project to confirm continuity of mineralization and to upgrade 
the remaining Inferred mineral resources to Indicated within the open-pit portion of 
the Hardrock deposit. A total of 93 new DDH and one hole was deepened (MM043) 
in this program. These additional meters were not included in the 2014 mineral 
resource estimate. 
 
A total of 8,733 m of historical diamond drill holes were resampled (previously un-
sampled intervals) in 2013 and 2014 on the Hardrock deposit but were not used in 
the 2014 mineral resource estimate update. 
 
Figure 10.1.1 shows the locations of the drill holes included in the 2014 updated 
mineral resource estimate presented in Section 14.1. The new drill holes and the 
resampled diamond drill holes that are not included in the 2014 mineral resource 
estimate update are also presented on this figure. 
 

 Collar Locations, Orientations and Down-Hole Surveys 

Collar locations for the Premier Gold drill holes on the Hardrock Project were 
determined using a cut grid or a hand-held GPS. Subsequent to completion, most 
collars were located using a Trimble GPS survey instrument. Some hole locations 
are only recorded to the nearest metre, even though more accurate measurements 
were possible. Casings were left in the ground by Premier Gold for almost all the 
holes. Once the holes were drilled, Premier Gold determined the drill hole azimuth 
and precise UTM coordinates by placing an APS unit on the drill casing. The 
downhole dip and drill hole orientations were surveyed using a gyroscope unit 
(REFLEX Gyro™). Premier Gold used the azimuth from the APS unit to provide the 
gyro program with a starting number to work from. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  131	

Premier Gold uses the UTM Coordinate System, NAD 83, Zone 16, to record the 
locations (x, y, and z) of its drill collars. 
 

 Core Logging Procedures 

The first time the core is handled is at the drill by the driller helper who takes the core 
from the core tube and places it in core boxes, marking off every 3 m. Once a core 
box is full, the helper wraps the box with tape or wire depending on the preference of 
the drilling company. At the end of each shift, the core is delivered to the core shack. 
Premier Gold personnel remove the wire or tape and bring the boxes to the logging 
trailers. The technicians rotate the core so that all pieces slant one way, at about a 
45° angle. They check that distances are correctly indicated on the wooden blocks 
placed every 3 m. If there is a mistake on any of the blocks, the project manager is 
informed and the drill foreman brought in. If it is an easy fix, the blocks are moved, 
but if not, the drill rods are removed to assess what happened. The core is measured 
in each box and the box labelled. Red lines are drawn along the centre of the core to 
provide a reference for the core cutters. Geological technicians and geologists are 
then responsible for taking photographs of the core. 
 
Rock quality designation (RQD) is done by either geologists or the geological 
technicians. Any breakage under 10 centimetres is recorded. Core from the 
Hardrock deposit is of very good quality and recovery is high. Samples were 
generally taken along the entire length of the holes (continuous sampling). Sample 
length typically ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 m. The sampled core must be considered 
representative and of good quality. Once logged and/or ticketed, the core is stored 
outside in racks until it is brought into the cutshack for sawing. The core of each 
selected interval is cut in half using a typical table-feed circular rock saw, with one 
half placed in a numbered plastic bag for shipment to the laboratory, and the other 
half returned to the core box as a witness (reference) sample. A tag bearing the 
sample number is left in the box at the beginning of the sampled interval. The core 
box is then brought to the core compound for storage. Premier Gold drill core is 
stored at Geraldton.  
 
InnovExplo is of the opinion that the core samples from the Premium Gold drilling 
programs are valid and of sufficient quality to be used in the mineral resource 
estimation herein.

 BROOKBANK  

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 

 Drilling Methods 

Diamond core drilling utilizes an annular diamond-impregnated drill bit attached to 
the end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used 
are fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds. They are set within a matrix of 
varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Holes within the bit allow water to 
be delivered to the cutting face. 
 
Core samples are retrieved via the use of a lifter tube, a hollow tube lowered inside 
the rod string by a winch cable until it stops inside the core barrel. As drilling 
proceeds, the core barrel slides over the core as it are cut. The winch is then 
retracted, pulling the core barrel to the surface. 
 
Once the core barrel is removed from the hole, the core is removed and catalogued. 
The core is washed, measured and broken into smaller pieces using a hammer or 
sawn through to make it fit into the sample trays. 
 
The details of drilling done by the previous operators Lac, Asarco, and Cyprus are 
not entirely available. The core was BQ size and drilling, sampling, and assaying 
were all conducted using the appropriate industry standard methods at the time. One 
of the authors of the 2010 Technical Report, J. Reddick, worked on the property for 
Asarco in 1993 and 1994, and also reviewed the property data when it was held by 
Cyprus in 1997. All exploration work, drilling procedures, and assaying procedures 
are believed to have been conducted in accordance with standard industry practice 
at the time.  
 
All of the diamond drilling between 2007 and 2009 was contracted to Chibougamau 
Diamond Drilling (Chibougamau Drilling), based in Chibougamau, Quebec. The 2010 
drill program was completed by Chibougamau Diamond Drilling, Boart-Longyear 
Diamond Drilling (Boart-Longyear Drilling), and Bradley Bros. Diamond Drilling 
(Bradley Bros. Drilling). The drill rigs were mounted on skids and dragged into 
position using a skidder or bulldozer. 
 
Core diameter for Premier drilling is NQ size (48 mm in diameter) and all drilling was 
recorded in metres. The core was placed in three-row wooden core boxes provided 
by the contractor. The boxes and distance (in metres) were labelled by the drill 
crews. Upon receipt at the Premier core shack, the boxes were then labelled with 
permanent metal tags according to drill hole number, box number, and metres down-
hole. After the core was logged and sampled it was permanently stored in core racks 
at the Magnet Mine site or at a site constructed in 2009 on Old Arena Road near the 
Premier core shack in Geraldton. 
 

 Surveying: Collar Locations and Orientations 

Collar locations for Premier drilling at the Hardrock Property were located using a cut 
grid or by using a hand-held GPS. Subsequent to completion, most collars were 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  134	

located using a Trimble GPS survey instrument. Some hole locations are only 
recorded to the nearest metre, even though more accurate measurements were 
possible. Casings were left in the ground by Lac, Asarco, Cyprus, and Premier for 
almost all of the holes drilled. Many of the Lac, Asarco, and Cyprus holes were 
located and surveyed by Premier using either a hand-held or Trimble GPS survey 
instrument. Drilling by those companies was done using the original mine grid.  
 
Premier is using the UTM Coordinate System, NAD 23, Zone 16, to record the 
locations of its drill collars. 
 

 Surveying: Down-Hole Surveys 

In 2007, a Reflex Instruments down-hole survey tool provided by the drill contractor 
was used with surveys typically taken every 50 metres. More detailed surveys were 
taken at the request of the geologist. This provided both dip and azimuth readings, 
but the azimuth readings are unreliable, due to the iron-rich rocks in the area of the 
drilling. A Reflex Instruments Maxibore tool was also used for down-hole surveys 
starting in November 2007 as standard practice even though azimuth readings were 
still an issue. In May/June 2010, Premier changed to an Icefields Gyro survey tool to 
achieve more efficient and more accurate survey data. 
 
In late 2009 and again in October 2010, a survey determined drill hole orientations 
using a gyroscope at surface on casings for 79 historic holes. Drill holes have not 
had down-hole surveys done using a gyroscope. Most of the drill holes from previous 
operators were only surveyed for dip deviations using acid tests. 
 

 Surveying: Topography 

Although topographic data are available, the GPS data recorded in the field were 
used for drill collar elevation locations. 
 

 Core Logging Procedures 

During the drilling program, core is brought to the Geraldton core shack on a daily 
basis by employees of the drill contractor. The core was logged at the core shack 
(Fig. 10.2.1) where RQD, core box metre intervals, major lithologic units, structure, 
alteration, and mineralogy were recorded on a laptop computer using text, numeric 
code, and percentages and entered into a core logging database. The core was then 
photographed and marked up for sampling. Assay results for samples and quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) materials were entered into the logging database 
when received. All assay and QA/QC results were received electronically. Copies of 
the drill hole logging protocols drilled prior to Premier becoming the operator are not 
available.

 Brookbank Project Drilling and Results 

The drill holes completed on the Brookbank Project to date are shown in Figure 
10.2.2. The drill hole coordinates, azimuths, dips, and lengths are summarized in the 
Appendix. 
 
In zones of uniform lithology, the sampling interval is 1 metre; however, where 
geological/alteration differences exist, the sample interval is reduced to a minimum 
of 0.5 metres or slightly increased to a maximum of 1.5 metres. Two holes, totalling 
1,359 meters, have been drilled by Premier Gold to date, while most of the drilling 
was conducted by Ontex Resources between 1999 and 2008. The most significant 
results are summarized as follows: 
 

 Mineralization on the Brookbank main zone deposit is continuous along strike 
for over a kilometre; the exact limits have yet to be established. 

 Using a mineralization envelope of 0.1 g/t Au, the mineralized horizon is 
cone-shaped in section and is sub-vertical with a slight inclination to the 
south as demonstrated in Figure 10.2.3. 

 The true thickness of the mineralized envelope varies from 20 to 50 metres at 
or close to surface and to 1 to 2 metres at a 750 metre (approximate) vertical 
depth from surface.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  136	

 Within the 0.1 g/t Au envelope, the drill intercepts with mineralization of 
potential economic interest vary in grade from 0.5 g/t to 15 g/t. The variation 
is completely random. The major intercepts are in Appendix Q with the true 
width ranging between 50% and 75% of the core length. 

 
 KEY LAKE 

The description of drilling method, surveying, and core logging procedures described 
above for the Brookbank Project is the same used on the Limited Partnership's other 
Projects within the Trans-Canada Property. 
 
Eight holes have been drilled by Premier Gold to date totalling 3,190 meters. 
 

 MICON COMMENTS 

During the Brookbank and Key Lake site visits, Micon inspected drill cores, reviewed 
drill hole logs plus sampling records and established that core recovery is excellent 
throughout the deposit. There are no drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could 
materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the assay results.  
 
Overall, Micon considers the data obtained from the exploration and drilling 
programs to be reliable.

11. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS, AND SECURITY 

 HARDROCK 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock Deposit (according 
to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 

 Laboratories Accreditation and Certification 

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International 
Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide 
standardization. ISO/IEC 17025 General Requirements for the Competence of 
Testing and Calibration Laboratories sets out the criteria for laboratories wishing to 
demonstrate that they are technically competent, operating an effective quality 
system, and able to generate technically valid calibration and test results. The 
standard will form the basis for the accreditation of competence of laboratories by 
accreditation bodies. ISO 9001 is for management support, procedures, internal 
audits and corrective actions. It provides a framework for existing quality functions 
and procedures. 
 
The main difference between ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 9001 is the accreditation and 
certification. ISO/IEC 17025 stands for accreditation, which means the recognition of 
competence of specific technical competence. ISO 9001 stands for certification, 
which means accordance with a standard assessed by management systems, 
certified by any independent body that is internationally agreed. Also, there is the 
difference with the accurate products. ISO 9001 does not mean accurate products 
are produced. For that, product should be approved by ISO/IEC 17025. Every 
conformity assessment body should have the ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. 
 
The general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories 
are described in the document CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025:2005). These 
requirements are designed to apply to all types of calibration and objective testing 
and therefore need to be interpreted with respect to the type of calibration and 
testing concerned and the techniques involved. The document CAN-P-1579:2014 is 
the Standard Council of Canada's (SCC) requirements for the accreditation of 
mineral analysis testing laboratories. The program is designed to ensure mineral 
analysis testing laboratories meet minimum quality and reliability standards and to 
ensure a demonstrated uniform level of proficiency among these mineral analysis 
testing laboratories. CAN-P-1579:2014 identifies the minimum requirements for 
accreditation of laboratories supplying mineral analysis testing services. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the measurement of all media used in mining 
exploration and processing including sediments, rocks, ores, metal products, tailings, 
other mineral samples, water and vegetation. 
 
The Geraldton (Ontario) facility belonging to Activation Laboratories Ltd ("Actlabs") 
was used for the entire drilling program. Actlabs Geraldton has recently received ISO 
9001:2008 certification through Kiwa International Cert GmbH. Actlabs Geraldton is 
an independent commercial laboratory. 
 
All batches (pulps) re-assayed were sent in another laboratory, either Accurassay in 
Thunder Bay or ALS-Chemex in Thunder Bay. Accurassay Laboratories has ISO/IEC 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  140	

17025 accreditation through the SCC. Accurassay is an independent commercial 
laboratory. ALS-Chemex laboratory is part of the ALS Global Group and has ISO 
9001 certification and ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation through the SCC. ALS is an 
independent commercial laboratory. 
 

 Sample Preparation by Premier Gold personnel 

All quality control samples are prepared and bagged ahead of time by Premier Gold 
personnel. The Premier Gold employee in the cutshack places one half of the ticket 
from the core box into a bag with the sample and staples the other half in the box. 
One half of each quality control sample ticket is placed in the appropriate type of 
control sample bag, which were prepared beforehand. A list of quality control 
samples and their numbers/locations is posted on the wall in the cutshack and 
regularly updated by Premier Gold staff. Five (5) to seven (7) samples are placed in 
a rice bag and the contents identified on the outside of the bag. Each bag and its 
contents are recorded on a notepad and placed in a plastic holder once complete. 
These slips are picked up each morning by a Premier Gold employee and recorded 
in an Excel spreadsheet. Once the batches are complete, Premier Gold personnel 
deliver the bags to the Actlabs Geraldton laboratory and no third party is involved in 
transportation.  
 
Economic samples are sent in batches of thirty-four (34). Each purchase order 
covers one batch of 34 samples consisting of: 
 

 30 regular samples; 
 1 field duplicate sample; 
 1 field blank; 
 1 certified reference material (standard) with a low gold value; 
 1 certified reference material (standard) with a high gold value. 

 
As a quality control check, the Actlabs Geraldton laboratory adds a 35th sample to 
every field batch received, in the form of a coarse duplicate of the last regular 
sample (the 30th sample), constituting a second pulp prepared from the reject. The 
quality of the reject is monitored to ensure that proper preparation procedures are 
used during crushing. For the fusion process, the Actlabs Geraldton laboratory adds 
seven (7) additional quality control samples (2 analytical blanks, 2 certified reference 
materials, 3 pulp duplicates), bringing the fusible batch to a total of forty-two (42). 
The pulp duplicates are necessary to ensure that proper preparation procedures are 
used during pulverization. At Actlabs Geraldton Laboratory, the maximum furnace 
charge of 42 samples ensures that Premier Gold samples are not mixed with others. 
 

 Fire Assay Sample Preparation (Actlabs Geraldton) 

Samples are received at Actlabs Geraldton, sorted and bar-coded. They are then 
placed in the sample drying room and dried at 60°C. Any samples that are damaged 
upon receipt (i.e., punctured sample bag, loose core) are documented and the client 
is informed with pictures.  
 
Samples are crushed to 90% passing -10mesh and split with a Jones riffle, and a 
250 g split is pulverized to 95% passing -150mesh. Sieve tests are performed on the 
crusher at the beginning of each day. Sieve tests are performed on the pulps on the 
1st and 50th sample of each work order; if there is a failure the samples are re-milled 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  141	

to ensure that they pass. There is a pulp duplicate made every 30th sample in 
sample prep and a coarse reject duplicate every 50th. These are all reported on the 
QC portion of the report. Samples are then sent for fire assay. 
 

 Metallic Sieve Sample Preparation (Actlabs Geraldton) 

All samples containing visible gold are prepared with metallic sieve sample 
preparation procedures. 
 
A representative 2,000 g split (Code 1A4-2000) is sieved at 100 mesh (149 microns) 
with fire assays performed on the entire +100 mesh and 2 splits on the -100 mesh 
fraction. The total amount of sample and the +100 mesh and -100 mesh fractions are 
weighed for assay reconciliation. Measured amounts of cleaner sand are used 
between samples and saved to test for possible plating out of gold on the mill. 
Alternative sieving mesh sizes are available but the user is warned that the finer the 
grind the more likelihood of gold loss by plating out on the mill. 
 

 Fire Assay Procedures (Actlabs Geraldton) 

The following description for the fire assay procedures was supplied by Actlabs 
Geraldton. Samples (50 g each) are sent to the fire assay area numbered and in 
order (usually 1 to 34+1). A rack of 42 crucibles are then labelled with an assigned 
letter code and numbered 1 to 42. The sample is mixed with fire assay fluxes (borax, 
soda ash, silica, litharge) and with Ag added as a collector and the mixture is placed 
in a fire clay crucible. The mixture is then preheated at 850°C, intermediate at 950°C 
and finish at 1060°C, with the entire fusion process lasting 60 minutes. The crucibles 
are then removed from the assay furnace and the molten slag (lighter material) is 
carefully poured from the crucible into a mould, leaving a lead button at the base of 
the mould. The lead button is then placed in a preheated cupel which absorbs the 
lead when cupelled at 950°C to recover the Ag (doré bead) + Au. 
 

11.1.5.1 Gravimetric Finish (Actlabs Geraldton) 

Between August 10, 2013 and March 25, 2014, all samples were assayed using fire 
assay with gravimetric finish (1A3-50 code).  
 
After the fire assay procedures, Au is separated from the Ag in the doré bead by 
parting with nitric acid. The resulting gold flake is annealed using a torch. The gold 
flake remaining is weighed gravimetrically on a microbalance. 
 

11.1.5.2 Atomic Absorption Finish (Actlabs Geraldton)  

After March 25, 2014, all samples were assayed using fire assay with atomic 
absorption (AA) finish (1A2-50 code). 
 
The entire Ag doré bead is dissolved in aqua regia and the gold content is 
determined by AA. AA is an instrumental method of determining element 
concentration by introducing an element in its atomic form to a light beam of 
appropriate wavelength causing the atom to absorb light. The reduction in the 
intensity of the light beam directly correlates with the concentration of the elemental 
atomic species. On each tray of 42 samples there is two blanks, three sample 
duplicates and 2 certified reference materials, one high and one low (QC= 7 out of 
42 samples). Actlabs Geraldton generally reruns all gold by fire assay gravimetric 
over 10,000 ppb to ensure accurate values. 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  142	

 
All samples assaying grades over 5.0 g/t Au with atomic absorption were rerun with 
gravimetric finish to ensure accurate values. 
 

 Fire Assay Procedures with Gravimetric Finish (Accurassay Thunder Bay) 

For the gravimetric analysis of gold, each pulp sample (50 g) is mixed with a lead 
based flux. An inquart of silver solution is added prior to fusion for one hour and 
fifteen minutes at 1050°C. 
 
The lead buttons which result from the fusion process contain all of the gold from the 
samples as well as the silver that was added. The buttons are placed in a cupeling 
furnace at 950°C where all of the lead is either volatilized or absorbed by the cupels. 
This generates a prill or doré bead for each sample consisting of the silver plus any 
gold present. 
 
Once the cupels have cooled sufficiently, the bead from each is placed in an 
appropriately labeled test tube. The doré bead is then transferred to a porcelain 
crucible and the silver is dissolved with dilute nitric acid, at around 90°C. The 
remaining gold is washed, removing the silver solution from the crucible. The 
residual wash material is then removed using both decanting and evaporation. The 
resulting gold flakes are annealed into a gold bead and weighed using a micro 
balance. A simple weight comparison is used to mathematically calculate the amount 
of gold in the sample.  
 
At Accurassay Laboratory, a batch consists of 27 or 28 pots, staggered to help 
distinguish batches. There is an internal standard and a blank in each plus two 
duplicates. This leaves room for 23 or 24 discrete client samples per batch. Batches 
are charged three to a load in the Big Bertha furnace for fusion.  
 
The maximum furnace charge of 78 client samples does not ensure that Premier 
Gold batches will not be mixed with those of other companies. 
 

 Fire Assay Procedures with Gravimetric or Atomic Absorption Finish (ALS-

Chemex Thunder Bay) 

The fire assay technique uses high temperature and flux to "melt" the rock and allow 
the gold to be collected. Lead formed from the reduction of litharge (PbO), is 
traditionally used as the collecting medium for silver and gold. The test sample is 
intimately mixed with a suitable flux that will fuse at high temperature with the 
gangue minerals present in the sample to produce a slag that is liquid at the fusion 
temperature. The liberated precious metals are scavenged by the molten lead and 
gravitate to the bottom of the fusion crucible. 
 
Upon cooling, the lead button is separated from the slag and processed in a 
separate furnace for a high temperature oxidation (cupellation) where the lead is 
removed, leaving the precious metals behind as a metallic bead called a prill. 
Traditionally this prill was then partially dissolved in nitric acid (parted) to remove 
silver and the remaining gold determined by weighing (gravimetry). Alternatively, the 
prill can be dissolved in a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid (aqua regia) and the 
concentration determined by spectroscopic methods (AAS, ICPAES or ICPMS). The

concentration is normally expressed as parts per million (ppm), which is equivalent to 
grams per tonne (g/t). 
 
For the AA finish method, a pulp sample is fused with a mixture of lead oxide, 
sodium carbonate, borax, silica and other reagents as required, inquarted with 6 mg 
of gold-free silver and then cupelled to yield a precious metal bead. The bead is 
digested in 0.5 ml dilute nitric acid in the microwave oven, 0.5 ml concentrated 
hydrochloric acid is then added and the bead is further digested in the microwave at 
a lower power setting. The digested solution is cooled, diluted to a total volume of 4 
ml with de-mineralized water, and analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy 
against matrix-matched standards. 
 
For the gravimetric finish method, a pulp sample is fused with a mixture of lead 
oxide, sodium carbonate, borax, silica and other reagents in order to produce a lead 
button. The lead button containing the precious metals is cupelled to remove the 
lead. The remaining gold and silver bead is parted in dilute nitric acid, annealed and 
weighed as gold. Silver, if requested, is then determined by the difference in weights. 
 
At the ALS-Chemex laboratory, the batch size for all fire assay method is 84 
including 6 internal QC. Therefore 78 client samples can be done per batch.  
 
The maximum furnace charge of 78 client samples ensures that Premier Gold 
samples are not mixed with others. 
 

 Results of Quality Control  

11.1.8.1 Blanks 

The field blank used in the drilling program is from a barren sample of crushed white 
marble. One field blank is inserted for every thirty-four (34) samples. 
 
According to Premier Gold's QA/QC protocol, if any blank yields a gold value above 
0.1 g/t Au (10X detection limit for gravimetric finish), the batch containing the blank 
should be re-assayed. All batches (pulps) to be re-assayed were sent to another 
laboratory, either Accurassay in Thunder Bay or ALS-Chemex in Thunder Bay. 
 
For the drilling program that ran from August 12, 2013 to December 31, 2013 on the 
Hardrock deposit, only three (3) of the 1,369 blank results (gravimetric finish from 
Actlabs Geraldton) exceeded this recommended value, representing 0.22% of the 
total blank population (Fig. 11.1.1). For the period between January 2, 2014 and 
April 3, 2014, none of the 229 blank results (gravimetric finish at Actlabs Geraldton) 
yielded a gold value above 0.1 g/t Au (Fig. 11.1.2) 
 
According to Premier Gold's QA/QC protocol, if any blank yields a gold value above 
0.05 g/t Au (10X detection limit for atomic absorption finish), the batch containing the 
blank should be re-assayed.  
 
For the period between April 1, 2014 and May 26, 2014, none of the 164 blank 
results (AA finish at Actlabs Geraldton) yielded a gold value above 0.05 g/t Au  
(Fig. 11.1.3)

 Certified Reference Material (Standards) 

Two (2) certified reference materials (CRMs or standards) were inserted for every 
thirty-four (34) samples during the drilling program. Six (6) standards were used, with 
gold grades ranging from 0.835 to 8.595 g/t Au as follows: 
 

 CDN-GS-5K with a theoretical value of 3.840 ± 0.280 g/t Au 
 CDN-GS-7A with a theoretical value of 7.200 ± 0.600 g/t Au 
 CDN-GS-7B with a theoretical value of 6.420 ± 0.460 g/t Au 
 CDN-GS-8A with a theoretical value of 8.250 ± 0.600 g/t Au 
 SF67 with a theoretical value of 0.835 ± 0.021 g/t Au 
 SN60 with a theoretical value of 8.595 ± 0.223 g/t Au 

 
Premier Gold's quality control protocol stipulates that if any analyzed standard yields 
a gold value above or below two standard deviations (2SD) of the certified grade for 
that standard, then the project manager is informed and must decide whether the 
batch containing that standard should be re-analyzed. All re-analyzed batches

The results of all standards used in the Hardrock drilling program carried out from 
August 12, 2013 to December 31, 2013 are summarized in Table 11.1.1, and those 
used in the program from January 2, 2014 to May 26, 2014 are summarized in Table 
11.1.2.  
 
Overall, more than 94.65% of the available results for standards passed the quality 
control criteria in 2013, while more than 96.70% passed in 2014.

adjusted to three standard deviations (3SD), because the certified gold value is very 
low. If 3SD is used for the quality control protocol for standard SF67, then 89.84% of 
the available results for standards would pass the quality control criteria (26 outliers 
of 256 results). In the case of lower gold results, the gravimetric finish is less 
accurate than AA and can also explain the results for standard SF67. 
 
InnovExplo is of the opinion that all results of the standards are reliable and valid. 
 

 Duplicates 

The quality control protocol requires a coarse duplicate be prepared for 30th sample 
in each batch. The duplicate is prepared by taking half of the crushed material 
derived from the original sample. By measuring the precision of the coarse 
duplicates, the incremental loss of precision can be determined for the coarse-crush 
stage of the process, thus indicating whether two (2) sub-samples taken after 
primary crushing is adequate for the given crushed particle size to ensure a 
representative sub-split. 
 
Duplicates are used to check the representativeness of results obtained for a given 
population. To determine reproducibility, precision (as a percentage) is calculated 
according to the following formula:  
 

 
 
Precision ranges from 0 to 200% with the best being 0%, meaning that both the 
original and the duplicate sample returned the same grade.  
 
A total of 1,357 original–coarse crush duplicate pairs were identified in the database 
corresponding to the period between August 12, 2013 and December 31, 2013. 
Figure 11.1.4 shows a linear regression slope of 0.9497 and a correlation coefficient 
of 98.9%. The correlation coefficient (%) is given by the square root of R² and 
represents the degree scatter of data around the linear regression slope. The results 
obtained indicate an excellent reproducibility of gold values with a gravimetric finish 
at Actlabs in Geraldton. For gold values greater than 1 g/t Au, only 3 outliers are 
observed on the graph because no duplicate pair is outside the lines marking a 
±20% relative difference.

 Conclusions 

A statistical analysis of the QA/QC data provided by Premier Gold did not reveal any 
significant analytical issues. InnovExplo is of the opinion that the sample preparation, 
analysis, QA/QC and security protocols used for the Hardrock project follow 
generally accepted industry standards and that the data is valid and of sufficient 
quality to be used for mineral resource estimation.

Scott Wilson Mining dated May 4, 2009, and entitled "Technical Report on the 
Brookbank Gold Deposit, Beardmore-Geraldton Area, Northern Ontario, Canada". 
 

 Sample Preparation 

11.2.1.1 Laboratory Details 

All aspects of sample preparation and analyses were conducted by the Activation 
Laboratories (Actlabs) in Thunder Bay and Geraldton. Actlabs is totally independent 
of Premier Gold and is ISO 17025 accredited. 
 

11.2.1.2 Preparation Procedure 

The following description is derived from Actlabs information. 
 
Each sample is sorted to insure that all client ID numbers match the manifest that 
was submitted. Samples are then logged into LIMS as per manifest. The samples 
are placed on racks to be placed in the drying room for eight hours at 60°C. The 
whole sample is then crushed to 80% (-10 mesh) using a TM Terminator Crusher. 
The sample is then run through a Humbolt Riffle splitter until the proper amount 
(approximately 250 grams or 500 grams for samples with visible gold) is achieved for 
pulverizing. Material is pulverized with a clean bowl and pulverizing ring to 95% (150 
mesh) with Quality Control sieve testing preformed at the beginning of every new 
job. Every 30th sample is split with analyses performed on both samples for Quality 
Control. Compressed air is used to clean equipment after each step of the process to 
prevent contamination with the bowl and ring cleaned with cleaning sand as well as 
compressed air. When the job is completed the samples are then sent to fire assay. 
 

 Analyses 

11.2.2.1 Fire Assay 

The following description for Actlab's Fire Assay 1A3-50 Package Procedure was 
derived from information supplied by Actlabs. 
 
The samples are sent to the fire assay area numbered and in order (usually 1 to 
34+1). A rack of 42 crucibles are then labeled with an assigned letter code and 
numbered 1 to 42. These crucibles are then charged with flux, silica, and flour. A 
specified amount by the client is cut from each sample and put in their corresponding 
crucible. Every tenth sample is duplicated (sample #-10, -20, and 30). An internal 
blank and standard are inserted at cups #15 and #16, and cups # 31 and #32 
respectively. Once all the samples have been weighed out, then the rack is placed in 
a tumbler for approximately ten minutes to properly mix all the samples along with 
the flux, silica, and flour. 
 
Once mixed, borax is added to every cup along with a shot of silver nitrate. The rack 
is then loaded inside the furnace at 9,500°C for half an hour, then at 10,600°C for 
another half hour for a total of one hour in the furnace. The crucibles are then 
removed from the furnace and the slag poured into molds. The lead buttons are then 
separated from the slag by use of a hammer and placed on its corresponding 
position on a board that is numbered 1 to 42. The buttons are then pounded to 
remove all excess slag. 

  



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  153	

 
The lead buttons are then placed in cupels and loaded into the cupel furnace for one 
hour at 9,600°C until only a silver bead remains. Once cupellation is finished, they 
are removed from the furnace and cooled down. Once cooled, the silver beads are 
then picked and placed into tubes that are labeled the same as the crucibles were. 
The tubes are then forwarded to the wet lab for further processing. 
 

11.2.2.2 ICP with Gravimetric Finish 

The following description for Actlab's ICP Gravimetric Procedures was derived from 
information supplied by Actlabs. 
 
Upon receiving samples from fire assay, internal travellers are made with order 
number, job number, which type of sample it is (1A2, 1A3, 1A4) along with the 
company name, how many samples the rack has, and the due date. 
 
The tubes are checked to make sure a bead is in each tube and then put into 10 ml 
crucibles for digestion. 
 
10 ml of 15% HNO3 (nitric acid) is added to each bead for digestion, then put on a 
hot plate for 15 to 25 minutes. Hot plates are around 90°C. 
 
The nitric acid's purpose is to dissolve everything besides the gold in the bead. 
 
Samples are drained of the acid, rinsed with de-ionized water (DI H2O), three times 
before doing a final rinse with ammonium hydroxide (NH4O8). 
 
The three DI water rinses are to clean the crucibles of any residual acid before doing 
the ammonium rinse so they do not chemically react with each other and 
compromise the integrity of the gold bead. 
 
The ammonium rinse is a sterilization of the cup. 
 
Each sample then goes through the annealing process. 
 
Once annealed, samples are weighed out on a micro-balance and transferred onto 
an Excel spreadsheet. 
 
Every sample is dumped back into their respective cups before another sample is 
weighed without exception. 
 
A calibration check is done every ten samples to assure the micro-balance is 
properly calibrated. The data is then sent to the Actlabs data department in Thunder 
Bay. 
 

 Quality Assurance / Quality Control 

11.2.3.1 Premier Gold Standards 

Between 2010 and 2012, six certified reference materials were used, and a total of 
7,492 standards were inserted with the samples. All results were graphed using plus 
two standard deviations from the mean as the warning limits and plus three standard 
deviations from the mean as the tolerance limits, indicating a failure.  



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  154	

Seven of the reference materials were purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories 
Ltd. (CDN-GS-1D, CDN-GS-2E, CDN-GS-4A, CDN-GS-5F, CDN-GS-5K, CDN-GS-
7A, CDN-GS-7B and CDN-GS-8A), and four of the reference materials were 
purchased from Rocklabs Limited (Rocklabs) in New Zealand (SH35, SL34, SG40 
and SJ53), and one of the materials was a standard prepared at Accurassay (HG-
S1). 
 

11.2.3.2 Premier Gold Blanks 

The blank materials used by Premier were mostly diabase rocks from the Nipigon 
area that were tested for gold prior to using as blank samples. Only in December 
2012 has Premier started to use landscape rock as a blank. A total of 4,178 blank 
samples were inserted for the 2010 to 2012 drilling, with 52 failures. 
 

11.2.3.3 Duplicate Assay Program 

Up until October 3, 2012 Premier used split core for its duplicate samples. Results 
from this program only served to indicate the degree of the nugget effect. After 
October 3, 2012, the duplicate samples consisted of two samples taken from the 
same piece of core which is rifle split at the assay laboratory. Results from the latter 
program are used to monitor the reproducibility of assays. A combined total of 5,906 
check assays or 6.1% were conducted by Premier in 2011 and 2012. 
 

11.2.3.4 Sample Insertion Rate and Reviewing the QA/QC Program Data 

The assay insertion rate used by Premier was two standards (one high and one low), 
a blank, and a duplicate for every batch of 34 samples sent to the assay laboratory.  
Premier conducted an assay check monthly and retests samples that the project 
manager deemed questionable. Monthly graphing for the standard, blank, and 
duplicate sampling was conducted. Cumulative graphing is conducted throughout the 
year to monitor quality of standard, blank, and duplicate samples. 
 

11.2.3.5 QA / QC Results 

When a standard/blank assay is outside three standard deviations, the entire sample 
batch is re-analysed. Micon has reviewed the control and monitoring charts compiled 
by Premier Gold from 2009 to April 2013 and is satisfied that adequate measures are 
in place to ensure the accuracy of assays used in the resource databases. An 
example of the control charts being compiled by Premier Gold is shown in Figure 
11.2.1.

Value of 7.2 g/t Au 
 
 
From the above figure, it is evident that failures are rarely encountered and hence 
the number of repeat analyses. 
 

11.2.3.6 Security 

All Premier's drill core samples are kept within Premier's core logging or sampling 
facility until shipment to the laboratory. Drill core samples are sawn (in half length-
wise) using a diamond saw at its core logging/cutting facility in Geraldton. Samples 
of halved drill core are sealed in labelled plastic sample bags and securely packed 
for shipping. Since June 2009, bags of samples have been shipped by road transport 
to the Actlabs preparation facilities in Geraldton. The samples are delivered to the 
preparation facility by Premier staff. 
 

 KEY LAKE 

The description of sample preparation, analyses and security for the Key Lake 
Project is the same as above for the Brookbank Project.  
 

 MICON COMMENTS 

Micon considers that the sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures of 
Brookbank and Key Lake are adequate to ensure credibility of the assays. The 
QA/QC procedures and protocols employed by Premier are sufficiently rigorous to 
ensure that the sample data are appropriate for use in mineral resource estimation. 
However, Micon recommends that a second laboratory be used as an umpire on 5 to 
10% of its pulps in future sampling programs.

12. DATA VERIFICATION 

 HARDROCK 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock Deposit (according 
to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 
The diamond drill hole database used for the 2014 Resource Estimate presented 
herein was provided by Premier Gold and is referred to as the "Premier Gold 
database" in this section. A drilling program in the Hardrock deposit resource area 
had ended on April 24 2014, therefore the database close-out date was established 
at May, 26, 2014 for the resource estimate update. The last hole included in the 
database is MM596.  
 
InnovExplo's data verification included visits to Hardrock field sites (drill collars and 
strippings) as well as to the logging and core storage facilities. It also included a 
review of selected core intervals, drill hole collar locations, assays, the QA/QC 
program, downhole surveys, information on mined-out areas, and the descriptions of 
lithologies, alterations and structures. Finally, the verification also included a visit to 
the laboratory facilities of Activation Laboratories Ltd ("Actlabs") in Geraldton, 
Ontario. The site visit was completed by Karine Brousseau from May 7 to May 9, 
2014. 
 

 Historical Work 

The historical information used in this report was taken mainly from reports produced 
before the implementation of NI 43-101. In some cases, little information is available 
about sample preparation, analytical or security procedures for the historical work in 
the reviewed documents. However, InnovExplo assumes that the exploration 
activities conducted by earlier companies were in accordance with prevailing industry 
standards at the time.  
 

 Premier Gold Database 

InnovExplo was granted access to the certificate of assays for all the holes in the 
latest drilling programs that took place between August 2013 and April 2014. Assays 
were verified for 5% of the drill holes from these programs.  
 
Minor errors of the type normally encountered in a project database were addressed 
and corrected. The final database is considered to be of good overall quality. 
InnovExplo considers the Premier Gold database for the Hardrock deposit to be valid 
and reliable. 
 

 Premier Gold Diamond Drilling 

All surface drill hole collars on the Hardrock deposit were either professionally 
surveyed or surveyed using a Trimble GPS unit without post-processing. The collar 
surveys are considered adequate for the purpose of a resource estimate, although 
any collar that was only surveyed using a Trimble GPS unit should be professionally 
surveyed. Given that no elevation measurements were gathered by the professional 
surveyor and that the Trimble GPS unit provides a vertical precision of ±1 metre, a 
professional survey of every collar is recommended before proceeding to a more

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  157	

advanced study stage, and the collected data should include the elevation 
measurement.  
 
Although underground drill holes were compiled by the company, this information 
was not provided to InnovExplo. These holes were therefore excluded from the 
current resource estimate since the location data is considered unreliable and the 
assay results could not be verified.  
 
Downhole surveys were conducted on the majority of the holes. The Gyro and/or 
Reflex survey information was verified for 5% of the drill holes from the latest drilling 
programs. No errors were observed in the downhole surveys and no corrections 
were made to the database. Figure 12.1.1 shows some of the casings that were 
reviewed during the site visit.

A1 to A3) MM-544; B) MM-554 and C) MM-005T. All casing locations were within 4 metres of the 
location cited in the database, which is within the accuracy range of the GPS. 
 
 

 Premier Gold Logging, Sampling and Assaying Procedures 

InnovExplo reviewed several sections of mineralized core while visiting the on-site 
core logging and core storage facilities (Fig. 12.1.2). All core boxes were labelled 
and properly stored outside. Sample tags were still present in the boxes and it was 
possible to validate sample numbers and confirm the presence of mineralization in 
reference half-core samples from the mineralized zones. 
 
Drilling was underway in the Bankfield area during InnovExplo's site visit, which 
provided an opportunity for Premier Gold personnel to explain the entire path of the 
drill core, from the drill rig to the logging and sampling facility and finally to the 
laboratory (Figs. 12.1.3 to 12.1.6). InnovExplo is of the opinion that the protocols in 
place are adequate.

 Mined-Out Voids  

In 2013, InnovExplo recommended that the accuracy of the stope and drift 3D 
objects be improved to provide a more accurate representation of the mined-out 
volumes in the historical workings. In 2014, the stope and drift 3D objects were 
updated using all available information on historical plan views, cross sections and/or 
longitudinal views in addition to drill hole information (breakthrough drilling). Based 
on the type of data used to model each void, they were classified as low-, medium- 
or high-precision voids. 
 
Low-Precision Voids: no additional information was found and the voids represent 
extrapolated volumes based on drift plans as provided by Premier Gold in 2013. 
 
Medium-Precision Voids: modelled using only digitized longitudinal views combined 
with breakthrough drilling information.  
 
High-Precision Voids: modelled using digitized plan views and/or cross sections with 
accurate location information for drift and stope positions.  
 
Figure 12.1.9 shows a compilation of the underground voids based on their level of 
precision as a result of the 2014 update.

underground voids: A) Overall view of stopes and drifts by level of precision; B) Close-up 
view of the stopes modelled in 2013; C) Close-up view of the stopes updated in 2014 

 
 
Information on the type of backfill in the stopes was also compiled by Premier Gold 
in 2014 and integrated in the database. The result is a classification of the stopes 
according to three types of backfill: open (filled with water); waste (corresponding to 
a mix of waste and "clinker", which is defined here as a reject from the process 
plant); and sand (corresponding to a wet sand and gravel mix). Figure 12.1.10 shows 
a compilation of the underground voids based on backfill type. The specific gravities 
for each type of backfill were provided by Premier Gold.

InnovExplo considers the refinement of the voids triangulation to be of good quality 
and reliable despite the fact that some uncertainties remain for the low-precision 
voids.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  162	

 Conclusion 

Overall, InnovExplo is in the opinion that the data verification process demonstrated 
the validity of the data and protocols for the Hardrock Project. Despite the fact that 
collar elevation surveys could be improved, InnovExplo considers the Premier Gold 
database to be valid and of sufficient quality to be used for the mineral resource 
estimation herein. 
 

 BROOKBANK 

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 
Micon achieved data verification by visiting and inspecting the facilities of Actlabs in 
Geraldton where the Premier samples for the Brookbank Project are analyzed 
(effective June 2010), conducting two site visits to the project areas, conducting 
independent repeat analyses of selected sample pulps, analyzing monitoring reports 
on the performance of control samples, and performing resource database checks. 
 

 Laboratory Visits 

In order to ensure that sample analyses were being performed to current industry 
standards, Micon visited and inspected the Actlabs facility on February 15, 2011, and 
on November 9, 2011. The sample preparation facilities (see figure 12.2.1) were 
found to be well maintained with adequate measures in place to avoid contamination 
between samples. Analytical equipment and the entire complex are kept in neat 
condition. Records of calibration and performance parameters are kept up to date for 
both testing and measuring equipment. The laboratory's internal QA/QC also 
includes the insertion of a blank and a standard in every sample batch. Analytical 
procedures are satisfactory and the laboratory also conducts metallic screening 
analyses.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  163	

 
 Site Visit 

The Brookbank site visit was conducted by Charley Murahwi, P. Geo., from 
November 8 to 9, 2011. The tasks accomplished included the following: 
 

 Review of drilling, surveying, and sampling procedures. 
 Verification of some of the drill hole collars and review of the survey 

procedures. 
 Examination of drill core and visual verification of mineralized intercepts. 
 Partial validation of analytical results by comparing assays with drill core 

intercepts. 
 Review of QA/QC protocols. 

 
In summary, the main observations are that (a) the diamond drilling of NQ size core 
yields good core recoveries and representative samples; (b) the techniques used for 
down-hole surveys are appropriate; (c) gold mineralization is associated with 
sulphides (mostly pyrite with subordinate variable amounts of arsenopyrite, 
sphalerite and chalcopyrite) and pervasive silicification (see one example of the 
intercepts inspected in Figure 12.2.2); (d) drill core handling, logging and sampling 
are conducted satisfactorily; (e) QA/QC protocols in place are sound; (f) monitoring 
of QA/QC results is done on a real time basis; and (g) assay results generally match 
the mineralized intercepts observed in drill cores.

 Independent Repeat Analyses 

Micon selected 46 sample pulps encompassing a wide range of assay values (from 
low through medium to high) and re-numbered them in a different sequence before 
submitting them to the Actlabs laboratory in Geraldton for repeat analyses using the 
same method previously used. 
 
Comparisons between original (OG) and repeat assays (RA) in Figure 12.2.3 and 
Table 12.2.1 confirm the laboratory's high degree of accuracy (lack of bias) and 
precision with the exception of one mismatch. This mismatch (highlighted in cyan 
and yellow in Table 12.2.1) is attributed to mistaken sample switch. 
 
 

 
Figure 12.2.3 – Comparison of Original (OG) and Repeat Analyses (RA) 
 
 
 

 Review of Monitoring Reports and Control Charts 

Analysis of the monitoring reports reveals that adequate control samples 
incorporating high quality certified reference material (CRM), blanks and duplicates 
were used to ensure accuracy of the analytical database. In a few instances where 
standards failed, appropriate investigations were conducted and re-assaying was 
conducted whenever it was deemed necessary. Micon did not identify any flaws in 
the QA/QC protocols.

 Historical Drilling Data (2000 – 2009 Holes) 

Micon reviewed the validation work that was conducted on the historical drilling data 
by RPA in 2009 and concurs with RPA's findings in justifying the inclusion of the drill 
hole data in the resource database. 
 

 Database Validation 

The resource database validation conducted by Micon involved the following steps: 
 

 Checking for any non-conforming assay information such as duplicate 
samples and missing sample numbers. 

 Verifying collar elevations against survey information for each drill hole. 
 Verifying collar coordinates against survey information for each drill hole. 
 Verifying the dip and azimuth against survey information for each hole. 
 Comparing the database assays and intervals against the original assay 

certificates and drill logs. 
 
The main issue identified is lack of sampling and/or selective (incomplete) sampling 
in some zones/drill intercepts falling within the mineralization envelopes for the 
Brookbank Project. In all such zones, Micon adopted a prudent approach and 
assigned a detection limit assay value of 0.01 g/t Au. It is recommended that Premier 
completes the assaying prior to the next resource update. 
 
Some minor discrepancies involving duplication of sample intervals where duplicate 
analyses had been conducted were easily corrected. 
 

 KEY LAKE 

The site visits were conducted by Charley Murahwi, P.Geo., from November 8 to 9, 
2011. 
 

 DATA VERIFICATION CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS 

On the basis of the verification procedures described above, Micon considers the 
database generated by Premier to be representative of the main characteristics of 
the Brookbank and Key Lake Projects and therefore suitable for use in resource 
estimation. The insertion of a detection limit value of 0.01 g/t Au for a missing assay 
may likely lead to an understatement of the resource grade for Brookbank but 
nonetheless it ensures that all intercepts are used in the estimate with no danger of 
over-estimating the grade. 
 
Micon recommends that all future blanks used to monitor contamination between 
samples should look exactly the same as the other samples in the batch to avoid 
preferential attention. This, coupled with periodic check analyses of the sample pulps 
at an umpire laboratory, will always ensure a high quality database.

13. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

The following section of Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing is taken 
directly from the report titled "Trans-Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank 
Projects, Preliminary Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated 
March 13, 2014, prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 
BBA was retained to complete the preliminary design of the process plant for the 
Hardrock and Brookbank projects. The study involved a review of past and current 
metallurgical test work, the development of a preliminary process flowsheet and 
mass balance, preliminary sizing of major equipment as well as the development of 
capital and operating cost estimates for the selected process flowsheets. 
 

 HARDROCK 

 Historical Testwork 

During 2010 and 2011, scoping level metallurgical test work was conducted in 
two (2) phases by the SGS Canada Lakefield laboratory (SGS) under the 
supervision of Premier Gold Mines. The first phase of test work was performed to 
provide preliminary information regarding the characterization and mineralogy of the 
Hardrock Project property and to investigate the amenability of the samples to gold 
recovery by gravity, flotation and cyanidation. The second phase of the test work 
investigated the same beneficiation processes using new samples. A gold 
deportment study was also conducted to provide mineralogy information. The 
samples used during both test work phases were collected from higher gold grade 
zones containing elevated sulphur content, and it is assumed that they are typical of 
the mineralization found in the deeper part of the deposit (analogous to underground 
mine production). The head grade compositions of the tested samples are shown in 
Table 13.1.1

Comp P2 Phase 2 5.70 3.78 11.0 

 
 
On-going test work, described in Section 13.1.3, is being conducted on samples 
which are of lower gold grade and assumed to be representative of future process 
plant feed head grades from an open pit. The historical test work is not considered 
relevant to the current work, due to the difference in composition when compared to 
the area of the open-pit under study. Herein, as a reference, only historical 
comminution results are reported.

 Comminution Testwork 

Basic grindability tests were performed as part of the historical test work programs. 
During the first phase of test work, Comp 1 and Comp 2 were tested using the 
standard Bond Ball Mill Grinding Work Index (BWI) determination method. During the 
second phase of test work, Comp IF1 and Comp P2 were not subjected to 
grindability testing, but rather a separate composite from the Hardrock Property was 
used for standard Bond Rod Mill Grinding Work Index (RWI) and standard Bond Ball 
Mill Grinding Work Index (BWI) tests. The results from these tests are summarized in 
Table 13.1.2.

database. 
 

 2013 Testwork Program 

13.1.3.1 Sampling 

In May 2013, under the supervision of Premier Gold Mines personnel, 53 intervals 
were obtained from 41 NQ half-core samples. The cores were sorted into 
nine (9) groups (labelled as A through to I) and based primarily on their main 
lithologies and secondly on their zones. A total of five (5) lithologies and 
eight (8) zones were identified for the purpose of sorting the samples. 
 
The samples that formed each group composite were blended at the laboratory and 
a global composite was made using the proportions represented by each group in 
the deposit, in order to be as representative as possible. Five (5) dilution (low gold 
grade) composites from each of the lithologies were also assembled. A full panel of 
elemental assays was conducted on the samples. The most relevant assay results 
(gold grade, sulphide sulphur content, iron content and arsenic content) for each of 
the eight (8) groups are shown in Table 13.1.3. 
 
The global and variability composites were prepared from 320 kg and 650 kg of 
material, respectively. Both composites were sampled from a total of 748 m of core 
samples.

 Sample Preparation 

The 53 intervals used to compile the groups in Table 13.1.3 were first crushed to 
1¼ in. Approximately 15 kg of material was removed from each of the intervals 
(where possible) for SMC testing at the -22.4/+19.0 mm size fraction. 
 
After recombining the products of the SMC tests with their remaining corresponding 
core intervals, the material was stage crushed to 6 mesh. Approximately 10 kg of 
material was removed from selected intervals for Bond Work Index (BWI) testing, 
1.2 kg of material was removed for the Modified Bond Work Index (ModBWi) 
procedure on all intervals and sufficient material was also removed for a head 
sample. The remaining material was stage crushed to -10 mesh and split into test 
charges for both the global composite and the variability samples. 
 
EGRG testing will be performed on the global composite once test work has 
advanced further and the optimum grind size has been determined. The flowchart for 
the 2013 metallurgical test work program is shown in Figure 13.1.1

 Mineralogy 

SGS Lakefield performed a QEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of Materials by 
Scanning Electron Microscopy) and a XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) analysis on the global 
composite to identify the minerals that are present in the sample.  
Minor amounts of sulphides such as pyrite and pyrrhotite were present in the 
sample, representing 2.62% and 1.20% of the sample's mass. Arsenopyrite and 
chalcopyrite were less abundant at 0.11% and 0.01%, respectively. Magnetite was 
the most abundant iron oxide at 7.96%. Quartz (28.6%), plagioclase (19.3%), 
sericite/muscovite (13.8%), chlorite (9.53%) and ankerite (9.48%) accounted for 
most of the minerals in the remaining sample. 
 
A sample of the global composite was also submitted to Surface Science Western 
for analysis of the sub-microscopic gold content and distribution. Sub-microscopic 
gold is considered as refractory gold, chemically locked in the crystalline structure

and cannot be recovered through conventional cyanide leaching without pre-
treatment. Concentration depth profiles for Au, As, S, Cu and Fe were obtained via 
the use of a Dynamic SIMS instrument. The major gold carrier was identified as 
coarse and porous arsenopyrite with gold concentrations of 60.8 ppm and 9.5 ppm, 
respectively. Pyrite was also identified as a gold carrier, but with comparably lower 
gold concentrations at 0.56, 1.36 and 3.75 ppm for the three (3) types of pyrite 
observed (coarse, porous and fine, respectively). Pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and iron 
oxides (magnetite and hematite) showed lower gold concentrations of 0.39, 0.85, 
0.21 and 0.29 ppm, respectively. 
 
Using the information obtained from the two (2) methods, the abundance of each 
mineral coupled with the unrecoverable sub-microscopic gold contained in each 
mineral, the maximum gold recovery attainable can be estimated. In this case, gold 
losses in the global composite are evaluated at approximately 6.0 to 8.5%, 
corresponding to a maximum gold recovery of 91.5 to 94.0 percent. 
 

 Grinding 

A total of 47 samples (including the five (5) dilution samples) were subjected to SMC 
testing. The average results from each group and lithology are presented in Table

Forty-five (45) intervals of the total 47 intervals that were tested qualified as "hard" or 
"very hard". The average Axb value for the mineralized zones using the SMC testing 
method is 29.0. Simulation tools used to size grinding equipment requires that the 
SMC tests be calibrated with Drop-Weight Tests (DWT) from similar lithologies. As

DWTs were not performed to date, the un-calibrated Axb values were not used for 
equipment sizing. Instead, the corresponding Mia, Mih and Mic values were used to 
calculate the global grinding energy balance. 
 
Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWI) tests were performed on the Global Composite, on 
five (5) intervals from the mineralized zone and on the five (5) dilution samples. 
Modified Bond Ball Mill Work Index (ModBWI) tests were performed on 52 intervals 
from the mineralized zone and on the five (5) dilution samples. The ModBWI test 
work was calibrated with the BWI tests and the results vary from -5.17% to +0.57%

The results correspond to a weighted average ModBWI for all the interval samples of 
14.5 kWh/t and a 75th percentile of 15.3 kWh/t. This compares well with the BWI 
result of the Global Composite sample which was 15.2 kWh/t. The 75th percentile of 
the BWI test work results on the mineralized zones at 15.5 kWh/t was chosen as the

Although the gold recovery is higher at the finer grind size, it must be pointed out that 
the mass pull also increased. Based on this information, a gravity circuit was 
included in the conceptual flowsheet. GRG test work will be completed once leaching 
test work has progressed. 
 

 Leaching 

13.1.8.1 McClelland Testwork - Sulphide Impact 

On behalf of an external company, leaching tests were conducted at McClelland 
laboratory on samples from the Hardrock Project property. While the spatial 
representativity of the samples was not reviewed in detail, the testwork is current 
(report issued in 2013) and is pertinent to illustrate the detrimental effect that 
sulphides have on gold recovery. The very high sulphide content present in some of 
the samples indicates that the core intervals were deliberately selected and as such, 
the leaching results have to be used with care. The composition of the samples and 
associated averaged leaching results are shown in Table 13.1.8.

The leaching tests were performed using high cyanide concentrations ranging from 
0.5 up to 2.0 mg/L for each sample and no pre-aeration was applied. Those 
two (2) conditions may explain the high cyanide consumption reported in this 
testwork compared with the current series described in Section 13.1.8.2. 
 
The differences between McClelland's assayed and calculated Au head grades 
range from -17% to +26 %. Differences between the assayed and calculated Au 
head grades are also observed in the SGS testwork, although at a lesser extent, 
which may be explained by the fact that gravity separation was applied prior to 
leaching, which was not the case for the McClelland's series. 
 
Head assays indicate that the gold grade is correlated with the sulphide sulphur 
grade as shown inFigure 13.1.3. Assays from the historical and current test work at 
SGS were also included in the graph for reference.

Figure 13.1.3 – Gold Head Grade vs. Sulphide Head Grade 
 
 
Another observation is that the gold recovery decreases significantly as the sulphide 
head grade content increases beyond 3 percent. The gold recovery and sulphide 
head grade relationship is shown in Figure 13.1.4 along with results from the 
historical and current test work at SGS. In addition to a decrease in recovery, the 
high sulphide content also resulted in higher cyanide consumptions, attaining values 
around 1 kg/t at sulphide sulphur grades above 5 percent. No attempts to determine 
sulphide speciation as a function of sulphide grade was performed.

While the average sulphide content of the process plant feed is not expected to 
reach levels as high as seen in the McClelland test work, there may be times at 
which the sulphide content is far above the average and far below it. Variability 
testing will be performed at the next stage of the project to obtain further information 
on how the material behaves over a wider range of head grades. 
 

13.1.8.2 SGS Testwork – Global Composite 

The global composite described in Section 13.1.4 was submitted to various leaching 
conditions to identify the main operating parameters and to determine the associated 
gold recovery. A cyanide concentration of 0.5 mg/L was maintained during most 
tests, with the exception of two (2) tests for comparison purposes. Aeration was 
maintained for the total duration of the tests except for the series performed with G-2 
Gravity Tailings. The slurry G-2 tests were oxygenated prior to the addition of 
cyanide only. The test work results on the global composite are presented in Table 
13.1.9.

The recoveries as a function of the retention time for the whole rock and gravity tails 
leaching series are shown in Figure 13.1.5 and Figure 13.1.6. 
 

 
 

Figure 13.1.5 – Gold Recovery vs. Retention Time – Whole Rock Leaching 
 
 

 
Figure 13.1.6 – Gold Recovery vs. Retention Time – Gravity Tails Leaching 

 
 
Results for both whole rock and gravity tails indicate that the leaching recovery is 
dependent on the grind size of the feed. Although the use of oxygen shows a faster 
dissolution rate than the use of air during the first six (6) hours of the tests, the gold 
recoveries for both pre-aeration conditions are similar after 24 hours, which is shown 
in Table 13.1.9. In addition, the results show that leaching reaches completion

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  179	

between 30 and 48 hours for both whole rock and gravity tails, irrespective of the 
material's grind size. 
 
Given the preliminary nature of the study, a retention time of 36 hours was selected 
for the design criteria. As most of the gold is recovered within the first 24 hours, the 
possibility of reducing the retention time should be revised during the next stage of 
the project, once confirmation test work on leaching kinetics of the various zones has 
been conducted. 
 
Figure 13.1.5 and Figure 13.1.6 show that the final recovery is similar between the 
two (2) smaller grind sizes. A grind size of 75 µm was chosen as the design criteria 
and recovery was calculated as a function of the mill feed head grade. The average 
gold recovery was estimated to be 89.6% over the life of mine. A trade-off study 
should be completed at the next study phase in order to determine if a finer grind 
size would be beneficial to the project. 
 
The test work does not indicate that gravity prior to leaching has a major impact on 
the metallurgical performance as final tails gold assays of the gravity tails leaching 
are very similar to the whole rock leach results. Nevertheless, the difficulty in 
reconciling the assayed and calculated head grades when gravity is not applied is an 
indication that relatively coarser gold particles may be present in the sample and that 
the process flowsheet configuration must take this fact into account. 
 
Cyanide and Lime Consumption 

Given the high cyanide consumptions observed in the McClelland test work results; 
this parameter was monitored closely when testing the Global Composite. Since it 
was observed during the McClelland test work series that the elevated cyanide 
consumptions were correlated with cyanide concentrations, the test work was 
conducted at 0.5 g/L NaCN concentration and pre-aeration was included to promote 
sulphides oxidation. The results are presented inFigure 13.1.7.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  180	

 
Figure 13.1.7 – Impact of Oxidizing Agent on Cyanide Consumption 

 
 
As can be seen, the cyanide consumption is independent of the grind size but 
strongly dependent on the oxidizing agent used. The lime consumption is also 
affected by the oxidizing agent, although the results are less prevalent than for 
cyanide. Pre-aeration with oxygen still shows lower lime consumption, as seen in 
Figure 13.1.8.

13.1.8.3 Recommended Test Work  

Additional metallurgical test work is recommended prior to initiating the next study 
phase. The following parameters are required to confirm metallurgical performances 
and support the process design criteria: 
 

 Additional grindability test work such as Crusher Work Index, JK Drop Weight 
and SAG Design testing, Bond Rod Mill and Ball Mill Work Index tests as well 
as Bond Abrasion tests to confirm the comminution circuit configuration, 
ensure accurate sizing of crushing and grinding equipment and increase the 
accuracy of the operating cost estimate; 

 Gravity recoverable gold (GRG) tests; 
 Additional cyanide leaching tests to confirm the optimum grind size and 

leaching time; 
 Carbon adsorption test work to determine the expected carbon loading, 

provide data for modeling of carbon contactors and estimate solution losses; 
 Cyanide destruction test work to confirm the applicability of the proposed 

process and confirm associated reagents consumption;  
 Dynamic settling tests and slurry viscosity measurements to determine 

thickener sizing, flocculant consumption and tailings pumping assessment 
tests; and 

 Variability test work to evaluate process robustness. 
 
 

 BROOKBANK 

 Previous Operation 

An existing plant, Northern Empire Mill, is located on the Beardmore property, 
adjacent to the Brookbank Property. The plant, utilizing a conventional crushing, 
grinding, leaching, and carbon-in-pulp flowsheet, processed ore from the Leitch Mine 
during the 1980s at a rate of approximately 200 tpd (US).  
 
During operation, Lakefield Research conducted cyanidation and carbon testing as 
well as size fraction analyses on various mill products (SGS 1984) and subsequent 
cyanidation tests and size fraction analyses on the mill feed (SGS 1985). 
 

 Historical Test Work 

Test work was conducted by Teck Corporation at Lakefield Research of Canada 
Limited (Lakefield) on the Leitch property in the early 1980s. Initial test work included 
bottle roll cyanide leach tests and heap leach tests on run of mine material and 
gravity tailings samples (SGS 1981a, b, c). A pilot plant test was also conducted on 
Leitch samples to evaluate the ore's amenability to heap leaching (Lakefield).  
 
Whole-rock leach, as well as flotation and cyanidation of flotation concentrate tests 
were conducted on Brookbank and Foxear samples by Hudson Bay Exploration and 
Development Co. at Witteck Development Inc. in 1986 (Witteck 1986).  
 
The most recent and pertinent documented test work program was conducted by 
Ontex Resources Inc. (Ontex) at SGS Lakefield (SGS 2007) on Brookbank samples. 
A 70 lb. sample was crushed to ½ inch then roll-crushed to less than 2 mm. The 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  182	

sample was blended then divided into various sub-samples of 10 kg and 2 kg using a 
rotary splitter and submitted to assaying and metallurgical test work.  
 
For the purpose of this study, historical test work results conducted on Leitch 
samples have been assumed to be comparable to Brookbank material given the 
relatively close location of both properties and observed mineralogy. 
 
Previous test work on drill core samples from the property and previous plant 
operations indicate that the run of mine material can be considered as free-milling 
and can be treated with a conventional whole-rock leach flowsheet. 
 
Additional test work was not completed for the purpose of developing this study. 
 

 Metallurgical Samples 

Ontex conducted a test work program on a Brookbank composite made of samples 
of both high grade and low grade material. A total of eight (8) high and low grade 
material samples were combined to obtain a composite of the mineral resource, as 
shown in Table 13.1.10.

Although the selected intervals fall within the mineable zone identified in this study, 
the calculated head grade differs from the average life of mine grade value. 
Furthermore, the calculated head grade of the drill cores sample differs from the 
composite head grade assayed at SGS, which could be due to the presence of free 
gold. 
 
It is recommended that new samples be tested during the following development 
phase. The samples should be selected so that they are representative of the zone 
and the head grade that will be mined. Both the open pit and the underground 
material should be tested separately and as a composite.

 Head Grade Characterization 

Head analysis results from the Ontex test work program at Lakefield Research are 
shown in Table 13.1.11. The results indicate a head grade of 13 g/t Au, 6 g/t Ag and 
2.1% S. In addition, coarse and fine gold assays (screened at 150 mesh) were 
completed.

For the preliminary economic assessment, the head grade is established at 5.3 g/t 
Au based on the mine production plan shown in Section 16. Given the 13 g/t Au 
head grade estimated in the test work, an equivalent ratio was applied to scale the 
silver head grade test work result of 6 g/t Ag to 2.45 g/t Ag for typical plant feed. 
 

 Grind Size 

The test work program conducted in 2007 included the evaluation of the effect of 
grind size on recovery. A 48-hour leach test was conducted on two (2) combined 
gravity tailing samples to evaluate a possible benefit in re-grinding. The first leach 
test was performed without re-grind at a K80 of 79 µm. A second test was conducted 
with a re-grind to a K80 of 49 µm in a laboratory pebble mill. Results indicated an 
increase in gold recovery of 2.7% at the finer grind size. For this study, a grind size 
of 75 µm was selected. However, further testing is recommended to optimize this 
design criterion. In addition, a trade-off study should be conducted to determine if the 
credit from the additional gold recovery would off-set the capital cost of a two-stage 
grinding circuit required for a finer grinding product and its corresponding operating 
cost. 
 

 Gravity Separation 

SGS Lakefield evaluated the gravity recovery on a 10 kg sample at a K80 of 79 µm, 
ground in a laboratory rod mill. The sample was processed with a Knelson 
concentrator and upgraded with a Mozley table. The Mozley table tailings were 
combined with the Knelson concentrator tailings for further processing. Results from 
the gravity test are shown in Table 13.1.12.

The Mozley Concentrate 1-2 indicated a gravity recovery of 28.3% with a low mass 
pull. The gold grade of 38,807 g/t concentrate indicates there is a significant amount 
of free gold in the material and that tabling following gravity recovery could be an 
efficient separation method. However, given the limited amount of test work and the 
preliminary nature of the study, a gravity circuit is not included in the proposed 
flowsheet. Further gravity test work is recommended and, based on the 
aforementioned preliminary results; the benefit of including a gravity circuit should be 
revisited in subsequent studies. 
 

 Whole Ore Leaching 

From 1984 to 2007, various whole-rock leaching tests were conducted on core 
samples or samples taken directly from the operating plant. The results are shown in 
Table 13.1.13.

The results suggest that whole-rock cyanide leaching can be applied for the 
treatment of Brookbank material. Previous test work showed that gold recovery can 
be as high as 93.8%; however, the recovery value has to be put into perspective with 
the head grade of the sample. Based on available Brookbank sample test work, 
previous milling data from Leitch material and an average head grade of 5.3 g/t, a 
gold recovery of 92% has been assumed in this report for the proposed circuit 
configuration.

 Mill Work Indices 

Grindability tests were not conducted for either the rod mill work index (RWi) or the 
ball mill work index (BWi). As a guideline for ball mill sizing, past plant operation 
parameters from the Northern Empire Mill were used to calculate the grinding mill 
specific energy which was established at 16.5 kWh/t. 
 

 Recommended Test Work 

A detailed metallurgical test work program using representative samples of the 
Brookbank material is recommended to obtain data on the following parameters 
required to validate equipment size selection:  
 

 Comminution test work such as crusher work index, JK Drop Weight tests, 
Bond Work Index tests, and Bond abrasion tests; 

 Gravity recoverable gold (GRG) tests; 
 Grind size determination test work for whole-rock leach samples; 
 Cyanide leaching tests at various leaching times with oxygen, air and lead 

nitrate additions; 
 Pre-conditioning tests to determine if pre-aeration would benefit leaching by 

reducing the cyanide consumption; 
 Carbon absorption test work and modeling to determine the average carbon 

loading and solution losses; 
 Cyanide destruction test work to confirm applicability of the process and 

determine associated reagent consumptions; and  
 Dynamic setting tests to determine thickener sizing. 

 
The test work program will also confirm the flowsheet configuration and improve the 
determination of gold recovery.

14. MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

 HARDROCK 

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock deposit (according to 
National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 
The 2014 Hardrock Mineral Resource Estimate herein was prepared by Karine 
Brousseau, P.Eng., under the supervision of Carl Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo., using all 
available information. The main objective of the mandate assigned by Premier Gold 
was to update the 2013 Hardrock Mineral Resource Estimate which was prepared by 
InnovExplo and published in a report titled "Technical Report and Mineral Resource 
Estimate for the Hardrock deposit (compliant with National Instrument 43-101 and 
Form 43-101F1)" (Brousseau et al., 2013). The Hardrock deposit was mined in the 
past as the Hard Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt and Mosher mines. 
 
The 2014 resource area measures 5.7 km along strike, 1.7 km wide and 1.8 km 
deep. The boundaries are presented in Figure 14.1.1. The resource estimate is 
based on a compilation of historical and recent diamond drill holes and a litho-
structural model constructed by InnovExplo. Premier Gold collaborated on the 
update of the litho-structural model. 
 
The mineral resources presented herein are not mineral reserves since they have no 
demonstrable economic viability. The result of this study is a single Mineral 
Resource Estimate for fifteen (15) gold-bearing zones and a remaining 
undifferentiated envelope (see below for details). The estimate includes indicated 
and inferred resources for both a Whittle-optimized in-pit volume and a 
complementary underground volume. The effective date of the estimate is July 4, 
2014 based on the Whittle-optimized pit parameters and cut-off grades parameters. 
 

 In-Pit and Underground Mineral Resource Estimate 

14.1.1.1 Methodology 

The 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate detailed in this report was made using 3D 
block modelling and the inverse distance square interpolation (ID2) method for a 
corridor of the Hardrock deposit with a strike-length of 5.7 km and a width of 
approximately 1.7 km, down to a vertical depth of 1.8 km below surface. Fifteen (15) 
mineralized zones have been interpreted in 3D using GoCAD, based on a litho-
structural model and the drill hole database.  
 

14.1.1.2 Drill Hole Database 

The GEMS diamond drill holes database contains 1,417 surface diamond drill holes 
with gold assay results and specific gravity measurements, as well as coded 
lithological, alteration and structural data and RQD measurements taken from drill 
core logs. All 1,417 drill holes were used in this Mineral Resource Estimate, 
representing the drill holes completed and validated at the close-out date of May 26, 
2014, and located inside the limits of the undifferentiated envelope surrounding the 
fifteen (15) gold-bearing zones (Fig. 14.1.1). The 1,417 drill holes cover the 5.7 km 
strike-length of the project at a fairly regular drill spacing of 50 m, and up to 12.5 m 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  187	

apart close to surface. This selection of 1,417 drill holes contains a total of 259,640 
sampled intervals taken from 621,373.8 m of drilled core.  
 
In addition to the basic tables of raw data, the GEMS database contains several 
tables with the calculated drill hole composites and wireframe solid intersections 
required for the statistical evaluation and resource block modelling. 

 
14.1.1.3 Interpretation of Mineralized Zones 

In order to conduct accurate resource modelling of the Hardrock deposit, InnovExplo 
based its mineralized-zone wireframe model on the litho-structural model (see 
Section 7.1.10). This approach was adopted because: i) gold mineralization is 
intimately associated with specific lithological units and specific structural elements 
and/or domains; and ii) the interpretation of the mineralized zones must take into 
consideration, that for metallurgical purposes, Premier Gold needs to separate out 
mineralized material based on the different "rock types" present on the property. 
 
The detailed litho-structural model was therefore adapted and used as a mineralized-
zone model. 
 
A total of fifteen (15) main lithological units were converted to mineralized zones 
while ensuring that all solids are valid, that they properly overlap each other, and that 
they honor the drill hole database. Overlaps were handled by the "precedence" 
system used by GEMS for coding the block model.

Two of the new lithological units are gabbro units. The North Gabbro is folded and 
conformable with the North IF1 and IF2 units, and the South Gabbro marks the 
southern limit of the deposit. The latter is thicker and shows no evidence of 
mineralization. The South Gabbro is interpreted to be spatially associated with the 
Tombill-Bankfield Fault. The third lithological unit, a minor conglomerate unit 
(Conglomerate 3), is characterized by four (4) slivers hosted in the South Gabbro. 
 
The two new zones are the Central Zone and the F-Zone. The Central Zone is a 
gold-rich area hosted in the greywacke of the geologically defined Central Domain 
(see Section 7.1.10). The Central Zone is adjacent to the south contact of the North 
IF1 unit. The F-Zone is also a mineralized greywacke hosted in the Central Domain, 
and is immediately adjacent to the north contact of the Upper IF unit.  
 
The Envelope Zone was defined as the parts of a rectangular volume that are not 
included in any of the mineralized-zone solids. The envelope zone contains "floating" 
gold intersects for which continuity has not yet been demonstrated or interpreted. 
This envelope corresponds to an undivided greywacke country rock (or possibly 
other type of sedimentary rock).

14.1.1.4 High Grade Capping and Compositing 

For drill hole assay intervals that intersect interpreted mineralized zones, codes were 
automatically attributed based on the name of the 3D solids, and these coded 
intercepts were used to analyze sample lengths and generate statistics for high 
grade capping and composites.

High Grade Capping 

Basic univariate statistics were performed on raw assay datasets grouped by 
lithology using raw analytical assay data, for a total of 258,701 samples. High grade 
capping was established on a lithological basis.  
 
A total of 150 samples were capped at the determined capping limits. The capping of 
high assays affected 0.06% of all samples within the block model. Table 14.1.1 
presents a summary of the statistical analysis for each lithology. Figure 14.1.3 
presents the gold assay probability plots for four (4) lithologies.

Compositing 

In order to minimize any bias introduced by the variable sample lengths, the capped 
gold assays of the DDH data were composited to equal lengths of 1.5 metres ("1.5m 
composites") within all intervals that define each of the mineralized zones. When the 
last interval is less than 1.5 m, the composite length is adjusted to make all intervals 
equal. Automatically generated intersect tails between 0.75 m and 1.5 m were 
manually added to the final composite table. The result is composite lengths that 
vary from a minimum of 0.75 m to a maximum of 3 m. The total number of 
composites used in the DDH dataset is 343,692. A grade of 0.00 g/t Au was 
assigned to missing sample intervals. Table 14.1.2 summarizes the basic statistics 
for the gold composites.

14.1.1.5 Search Ellipsoids  

Each zone and the envelope were estimated separately with their own search 
ellipsoids. The size of each search ellipsoid was created according to the available 
geological and geostatistical information.  
 
Structural domain subdivisions  

Eleven (11) of the fifteen (15) mineralized zones were subdivided into subunits on 
the basis of their structural characteristics. Hinges were separated into antiform and 
synform entities and limbs were separated into north or south dipping. Part of these 
sub-units were also cut by three cutting planes oriented NW-SE that could correlate 
with fault structures, defining three structural domains (west, central and east). 
Cutting planes were defined in GOCAD to separate out hinges from limbs and from 
domains in order to give each of these subunits a "subunit block code" to which 
specific research ellipsoids could be attributed. Figure 14.1.4 and Figure 14.1.5 
illustrate the subdivisions of the Porphyry Zone as well as the cutting planes used, 
and thus represent the methodology applied to subdivide zones.

Taking into consideration the subdivisions defined above, eighty-six (86) distinct 
subunits and a remaining undifferentiated envelope were used to characterize the 
search ellipsoids. 
 
Different search ellipsoids were created for each subunit based on their mean 
azimuth and dip. One search ellipsoid was produced to interpolate the remaining 
envelope using a N100/75 orientation, which corresponds to the orientation of the

unit (3D view sketch looking west) 
 
 
Two sets of search ellipsoids were used for the final interpolation. The ellipsoid 
radiuses from pass 1 were established using a combination of the ranges 
determined from the geostatistical analysis and the interpretation of the true 
thickness of each subunit. The ellipsoid radiuses from pass 2 were fixed at values 
equivalent to 3x the ranges of the first set (Pass 1) to interpolate blocks that were not 
interpolated in the first pass.  
 
 
Table 14.1.3 summarizes the parameters of the final ellipsoids used for interpolation.

14.1.1.6 Bulk Density 

For the current 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate, a total of 5,726 bulk density 
measurements were provided by Premier Gold and integrated into the database. 
Lithology densities were measured at the Geraldton core shack by Premier Gold 
staff. A statistical analysis of the data was performed based on lithological unit, and 
similar average values were then subdivided by zone. Zones S4_2 and S4_3 were 
grouped for statistical study because there were too few density measurements in 
Zone S4_2. A density of 2.00 g/cm3 was assigned to the overburden. For the voids, 
a density of 1.00 g/cm3 was used for drifts and stopes that are classified as "open" 
and assumed to be filled with water. Premier Gold provided density measurements 
for stopes backfilled with sand and waste of 2.02 g/cm3 and 2.08 g/cm3 respectively 
(see details of backfilled stope classification in Section 12.1.6). 
 
Bulk densities were used to calculate tonnages from the volume estimates in the 
resource-grade block model. Table 14.1.4 presents the bulk densities used for each 
zone (average values).

14.1.1.7 Block Model 

A block model was established for the fifteen (15) mineralized zones (and their 
subunits) and the remaining envelope. The block model was extended to cover an 
area sufficient to host an open-pit. The model has been pushed down to a depth of 
approximately 1,800 m below surface. The block model was not rotated (Y-axis 
oriented along a N000 azimuth). The block dimensions reflect the sizes of the 
mineralized zones and plausible mining methods. The upper limit, representing the 
surface, was generated from a combination of drill hole collars and LiDAR survey 
data in areas where no drill hole data were available. Table 14.1.5 presents the 
properties of the block model.

All blocks with more than 0.01% of their volume falling within a selected solid were 
assigned the corresponding solid block code in their respective folder. A percent 
block model was generated reflecting the proportion of each block inside every solid 
(mineralized zones and their subunits, envelope, overburden, stopes and drifts). 
Precedence was respected during the process.

volume in stope or drift, all other folders fixed at 0% 

 
 Medium Precision: Minimum percent of each block coded M_stope or M_drift 

fixed at 35%, all other folders adjusted accordingly 
 

 High Precision: Exact percent for all blocks coded H_stope or H_drift and all 
other folders 

 
 
Table 14.1.6 provides details about the naming convention for the corresponding 
GEMS solids, as well as the rock codes and block codes assigned to each individual 
solid. The multi-folder percent block model thus generated was used in the mineral 
resource estimation.

14.1.1.8 Grade Block Model 

The geostatistical results summarized in this item provided the parameters to 
interpolate a grade model using the 1.5 m composites from the capped grade data to 
produce the best possible grade estimate for the defined resources in the Hardrock 
deposit. The interpolation was run on a point area workspace extracted from the 
DDH dataset. 
 
The interpolation profiles were customized to estimate grades separately for each of 
the mineralized zones and the envelope for the DDH composite population. The 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  202	

inverse distance squared (ID2) method was selected for the final resource estimation 
for all zones. 
 
The composite points were assigned rock codes and block codes corresponding to 
the mineralized zone or the mineralized subunit in which they occur. The 
interpolation profiles specify a single target and sample rock code for each 
mineralized-zone solid or subunit solid, thus establishing hard boundaries between 
the mineralized zones and preventing block grades from being estimated using 
sample points with different block codes than the block being estimated. The 
search/interpolation ellipse orientations and ranges defined in the interpolation 
profiles used for grade estimation correspond to those developed in Table 14.1.3 in 
Section 14.1.1.5. Other specifications to control grade estimation are as follows: 
 

 Pass 1 
o Minimum of four (4) and maximum of twelve (12) sample points in the 

search ellipse for interpolation; 
o Maximum of three (3) sample points from any one DDH 
o Minimum of two (2) drill holes for interpolation 

 
 Pass 2 

o Minimum of two (2) and maximum of twelve (12) sample points in the 
search ellipse for interpolation; 

o Minimum of one (1) drill hole for interpolation 
 

 
14.1.1.9 Resource Category Block Model 

By default, interpolated blocks were assigned to the Inferred category during the 
creation of the grade block model. The reclassification to an Indicated category was 
done for any blocks meeting all the conditions below: 
 

 Blocks interpolated with Pass 1; 
 Blocks interpolated with a minimum of two (2) drill holes; and 
 Blocks for which the distance to the closest composite is less than 35 m. 

 
A series of outline rings were created in plan views using the criteria described 
above. Indicated category solids (or shell surfaces) were created from these rings 
and the blocks were recoded accordingly. Within this indicated category solid, some 
inferred blocks have been upgraded to the Indicated category, whereas outside this 
solid, some Indicated blocks have been downgraded to the Inferred category. 
InnovExplo is of the opinion that this was a necessary step to homogenize (smooth 
out) the resource volumes in each category. Figures 14.1.7 to 14.1.9 show the 
methodology used for the Indicated category classification, as well as the Whittle-
optimized pit shell delimiting the in-pit and underground mineral resources. The 
reader should refer to Section 14.1.3 for further details about the Whittle-optimized 
pit shell.

 Mineral Resource Classification, Category and Definition 

The resource classification definitions used for this report are those published by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in their document "CIM 
Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves". 
 
Measured Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established 
that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate 
application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning 
and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 
 
Indicated Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, 
grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with 
a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration 
and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough 
for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 
 
Inferred Mineral Resource: that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and 
grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited 
sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. 
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  205	

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot 
be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to 
an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. 
Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of 
technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability 
worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from 
estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. 
 

 In-Pit Resource Estimation 

Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, and the specific 
interpolation parameters, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the current (updated) 
Hardrock In-Pit Mineral Resource Estimate can be classified as Indicated and 
Inferred resources. The estimate is compliant with CIM standards and guidelines for 
reporting mineral resources and reserves.  
 
The In-Pit Mineral Resources were estimated using different gold cut-off grades. The 
selected cut-off of 0.50 g/t Au allowed the mineral potential of the deposit to be 
outlined for the in-pit mining option.  
 
The final selected Whittle input parameters and the cut-off grade parameters used 
for the in-pit resource estimation are defined in Table 14.1.7.

The overall slope angle was set at 55°, which reflects the best approximation since 
no geotechnical information has been provided. The gold selling and processing 
costs, the mining dilution, as well as the processing and mining recoveries, were 
provided by Premier Gold and validated by InnovExplo. The Whittle-optimized pit 
shell was designed with a 30-metre buffer around lakes.  
 
Using the parameters shown above in Table 14.1.7, a mill cut-off grade (MCoG) of 
0.50 g/t Au was calculated for the Whittle pit shell optimization using the following 
formula: 
 

MCoG = (Processing + Administration costs + Rehandling + Sustaining Costs) x (1 + Mining Dilution) x 31.1035 
 

((Gold Price – Refining Cost) x (1 – Royalty) x Processing Recovery) 
 
Volumetrics for the in-put resource estimate have been constrained using the 
topography as the top surface and the Whittle-optimized pit-shell as the bottom 
surface. The needling has been set to three (3) needles. 
 
Table 14.1.8 displays the results of the 2014 In Situ1 Mineral Resource Estimate for 
the in-pit Whittle-optimized portion of the Hardrock deposit (the 15 mineralized zones 
and the envelope zone). Figures 14.1.7 to Figure 14.1.9 present the Whittle-
optimized pit-shell trace along typical cross sections. The detailed results of the In-pit 
Mineral Resource Estimate are presented by zone in Appendix III.

 Cut-off grades must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (gold price, exchange 
rate and mining cost). 

 Density (g/cm3) data used is on a per zone basis (envelope: 2.76, porphyry: 2.74, S4_1: 2.77, 
S4_2: 2.76, S4_3: 2.76, IF_N_1: 3.00, IF_N_2: 2.83, IF_N_3: 2.84, I0: 2.90, IF_HL: 2.87, IF_HU: 
2.76, Tenacity: 2.86, F-Zone: 2.76, Central: 2.75, I1_1: 2.77, I1_2: 2.77) 

 A minimum true thickness of 3.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when 
assayed, or a value of zero when not assayed. 

 High grade capping (g/t Au) was done on raw assay data and established on a per zone basis 
(envelope: 70, porphyry: 70, S4_1: 20, S4_2: 20, S4_3: 20, IF_N_1: 40, IF_N_2: 40, IF_N_3: 40, 
I0: 2.5, IF_HL: 50, IF_HU: 50, Tenacity: 70, F-Zone: 70, Central: 70, I1_1: 70, I1_2: 70) 

 Compositing was done on drill hole sections falling within the mineralized zones (composite = 1.5 
m). 

 Resources were evaluated from drill hole using a 2-pass ID2 interpolation method in a block 
model (block size = 10 m x 5 m x 10 m). 

 The inferred category is only defined within the areas where blocks were interpolated during pass 
1 or pass 2. 

 The indicated category is only defined in areas where the maximum distance to drill hole 
composites is less than 35m for blocks interpolated in pass 1. 

 Ounce (troy) = metric tonnes x grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes 
and g/t). 

 The number of metric tonnes was rounded to the nearest hundred. Any discrepancies in the totals 
are due to rounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 

 InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, 
socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource 
estimate. 

 Whittle parameters (all amounts in Canadian dollars): reference mining cost of $1.62; incremental 
bench cost ($/10m bench) of $0.032; milling cost of $10.86/t; 3% royalty; G&A cost of $1.22/t; 
rehandling cost of $0.10/t, sustaining capital of $0.50/t; gold price of $1,339/oz; shell selection at 
revenue factor of 0.711 ($953/oz); mining recovery of 95%; mining dilution of 5% at 0 g/t; milling 
recovery of 90%; and pit slope of 55°. 
 

 
 Underground Resource Estimation 

Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, and the specific 
interpolation parameters, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the current mineral 
resource estimate can be classified as Indicated and Inferred resources. The 
estimate is compliant with CIM standards and guidelines for reporting mineral 
resources and reserves.  
 
The underground mineral resources were estimated using different gold cut-off 
grades. The selected underground cut-off of 3.0 g/t Au allowed the mineral potential 
of the deposit to be outlined for the underground mining option, outside the Whittle-

The underground resource estimate presented herein uses a rounded value of 
3.00 g/t Au for the underground cut-off grade. 
 
A volumetric analysis of the underground resource estimate was carried out using a 
constraining surface constructed by merging the Whittle-optimized pit-shell with the 
bedrock surface in order to calculate the volume of any mineralized zone or 
envelope zone material contained within the bedrock but extending beyond the pit 
boundaries. 
 
Table 14.1.10 displays the results of the In Situ2 Mineral Resource Estimate for the 
underground portion of the Hardrock deposit (15 zones of mineralized material and 
the envelope zone). The detailed results of the Underground Mineral Resource 
Estimate are presented by zone in Appendix IV.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  211	

 BROOKBANK 

The following Brookbank section is taken directly from the report titled "Trans-
Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 

 Brookbank Deposit Resource Estimate 

14.2.1.1 Database Description 

The Brookbank deposit (main zone) has been tested by diamond drilling over a strike 
length of 1,150 metres and down to a vertical depth of 650 metres. The database 
consists of a total of 376 drill holes, of which the majority are concentrated in the 
central part of the deposit. The drill holes are on a variable grid of 25 metres (close 
to surface) to 200 metres at depth. The main components of the database are the 
collar, survey, assay, and lithology tables which were validated as described in 
Section 12.2.5. 
 

14.2.1.2 Topography 

The landscape in the Project area is generally flat with occasional slight or barely 
noticeable undulations; therefore a digital terrain model was not considered critical to 
the resource estimate. The topographic surface was generated using drill hole collar 
elevations. 
 

14.2.1.3 Specific Gravity 

Specific gravity for the different lithologies was determined at Actlabs for several 
samples of each rock type. The averages obtained are presented in Table 14.2.1

Note: CONG = conglomerate, GAB = gabbro, GWK = greywacke, IF = iron formation 

 
 

14.2.1.4 Estimation Methodology Overview 

The Brookbank Project mineral resource estimate was conducted using a systematic 
and logical approach involving geological interpretation, conventional statistical 
analysis on raw data, dynamic modelling, solid creation, statistical analysis on 
composite sample data and grade capping, geostatistical analysis, creation of 
interpolation parameters, block modelling, block model validation and classification.

14.2.1.5 Geological Interpretation 

The Brookbank gold deposits comprise the Brookbank Main, the Cherbourg and the 
Foxear deposits (Fig. 14.2.1) that occur at three different localities within the 6.5 
kilometre long Brookbank shear zone. The deposits are located at and/or near the 
contacts between mafic volcanics and meta-sediments. Thus the deposits appear to 
have both structural and lithological controls. However, the fact that gold 
mineralization is not continuous along the entire shear zone suggests that the 
deposits are related to second order structures rather than the primary shear zone. 
 
 

 
Figure 14.2.1 – Modelled Solids of the Brookbank Deposits 
 
 
Gold mineralization occurs within multiple quartz-carbonate stringers, veinlets and/or 
stockworks that give rise to broad zones of mineralization varying in width from 1 to 2 
metres at a depth of about 700 metres to up to 20 to 50 metres wide at or close to 
surface. This makes the deposit amenable to both selective and bulk mining 
methods. In section, the deposit is sub-vertical and cone shaped.  
 
Analysis of drill hole profiles and sections shows that a large number of drill holes 
(about 40%) were selectively sampled only in those parts perceived to contain 
mineralization. This is demonstrated in Figure 14.2.2 where only a few samples were 
taken from drill hole N-11 in contrast to drill hole 83-B14. 
 
It is more than likely that some mineralized zones may have been missed as a 
consequence of selective sampling. The net result is a likely understatement of the 
resource.

Statistics/Determination of Mineral Envelope 

Statistical analysis of raw assay data was conducted for the Brookbank Main deposit 
primarily to determine the mineralization indicator grade defining the envelope of the 
resource zone. Based on an interpretation of the log-probability curve obtained (Fig. 
14.2.3), the mineral envelope was established at a cut-off grade of 0.1 g/t Au.  
 
Solid Modelling and Compositing 

Using the mineralization envelope cut-off grade of 0.1 g/t Au, the solid representing 
the deposit was modeled. The wireframes were constructed using a 3D interactive 
methodology. The triangulation vertices defining the limits of the solid were snapped 
to the end points of the defined drill hole intervals to ensure proper sample capture. 
Snapped points were validated through visual checks. Waste zones within the 0.1 g/t 
envelope were modeled and discounted from the resource. 
 
The composite length selected was 1 metre based on the mode of the sample 
lengths. This short composite length was deemed necessary to match the selective 
sampling pattern and to differentiate the internal waste zones more precisely. 
Composites were created within the solid/mineralized envelope (lengths downhole) 
and adjusting lengths to avoid rejecting the last composite at the bottom limit of the 
solid. Composites were generated without applying grade capping so that legitimate 
high grade assays were honoured during interpolation, but, spatially restricted to 
prevent grade smearing.

Composites Statistics 

Statistical analysis of composite samples within the solid/mineralized envelope was 
performed to determine the population pattern, grade capping/restriction values, and 
the global mean. A summary of the statistics is presented in Table 14.2.2. The log-
probability plot is shown on Figure 14.2.4. The capping and spatial restriction grades 
are based on significant inflexion points on the log-probability plots at or above the 
99th and 95th percentile, respectively.

Spatial Analysis 

Variography was conducted using composite samples in order to define the 
continuity of the mineralization to establish the maximum range/distance over which 
samples/drill hole intercepts may be correlated, and the optimum parameters for the 
search ellipse to be used in the interpolation of grades. 
 
Initially, a down-hole variogram was computed in order to establish the nugget effect; 
thereafter, three variograms to cover the principal geometrical directions were 
computed and modelled using the nugget effect established from the down-hole 
variogram. The principal results are summarized inTable 14.2.3.

deposit indicates pronounced variability. This variability is also partly attributable to 
selective sampling. 
 
Block Model Definition and Search Parameters 

The block model definition is presented in Table 14.2.4. The upper limit representing 
surface topography was generated from drill hole collars. The parent block size was 
based on drill hole spacing, envisaged SMU and geometry of the deposit. Partial 
percents were used at the solid/mineralization envelope boundary to get an accurate 
volume representation. A volume check of the block model versus the mineralization 
envelope revealed a good representation of the volume of the solid.

Grade Interpolation and Validation 

Block grades were estimated using the Inverse Distance Cubed (ID3) function of the 
GEMS mining software. A four pass estimation procedure was used for the 
interpolation. The search ellipse configurations were defined using variography as a 
guide combined with the geometry of the deposit. The search parameters adopted 
for the resource estimates are summarized in Table 14.2.5.

Table 14.2.6 presents a summary of the parameters and assumptions used for the 
mineral resource estimate. Grade smearing was minimized by restricting the 
influence of values exceeding the restriction grade (RG) of 30 g/t Au shown in Table 
14.2.2. For all passes, the maximum number of samples per drill hole was set to 
control the number of drill holes in the interpolation. 
 
For Pass 1, the minimum number of samples and the maximum samples per drill 
hole for interpolation were designed to ensure that the nearest samples are 
accorded the highest weighting and that a minimum of the three closest holes are 
used in the interpolation.

For Pass 2, the maximum number of samples per drill hole was designed to ensure a 
minimum of two drill holes in the interpolation, to go beyond the limits of Pass 1. 
 
For Pass 3, the minimum number of samples and the maximum number of samples 
per drill hole allowed the bigger ellipse to interpolate grades into the remaining 
blocks not covered by Passes 1 and 2. 
 
Pass 4 parameters were used to ensure that all blocks of the block model were filled.

 Economic Pit Shell Versus Underground 

The resource block model was examined for open pit and underground potential at 
cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t Au and 2.8 g/t Au, respectively. (This is to say the prospects 
for economic extraction were based on cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t Au and 2.8 g/t Au for 
open pit and underground resources, respectively.) 
 
The resource block model was subjected to an analysis using a conventional Lerch-
Grossman algorithm with computer software, to define a series of potentially 
economic open pit shells.  
 
In order to run the Whittle economic pit optimization, assumed operating costs, gold 
recovery, and gold price were required. At this early stage in project development, no 
detailed economic or metallurgical analysis has been completed; therefore, the 
economic parameter estimates were based on Micon's experience with similar 
operations. The metallurgical recovery was based on the historical recoveries in the 
Brookbank-Hardrock district updated for a modern process plant, and the gold price 
was approximately the three-year trailing average. Table 14.2.7 shows the various 
parameters/assumptions used in the open pit analysis as well as the gold cut-off 
grades used for the mineral resource estimate.

 Resource Categorization and Statement 

14.2.3.1 Categorization 

Micon has classified resource blocks in the block model based largely upon the 
drilling density and the passes criteria described in Section 14.2.1.5, while also 
accounting for geological structures. The resource categories are shown on Figure 
14.2.8. At this stage there are no measured resources for the Brookbank project. 
 
Measured Resource 

The measured resource category was assigned to the coherent portions of the 
deposit covered by Pass 1 of the search ellipsoid, excluding islands or sporadic 
small volumes. Adequacy of sample/drill hole coverage was confirmed visually. 
 
Indicated Resource 

The indicated resource category was assigned to coherent portions of the deposit 
covered by Pass 2 of the search ellipsoid, including islands of Pass 1. Good visual 
evidence of adequate sample/drill hole coverage was also considered.

Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other 
relevant issues. There has been insufficient exploration to define the inferred 
resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource. It is uncertain if further 
exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral 
resource category. 
 

14.2.3.4 Mineral Resource Conclusions 

Based on the information available at December 31, 2012, the combined resource 
(open pit and underground) for the Brookbank deposit main zone excluding the 
Cherbourg and Fox Ear areas is 600,000 gold ounces in the indicated category and 
66,000 gold ounces in the inferred category. Micon believes that selective sampling 
may have resulted in the exclusion of some mineralized material from the resource. 
 
A careful analysis of drill hole information demonstrates that there is potential to 
increase the resource along strike as the deposit is still open ended in both 
directions (east and west). This is evident from Figure 14.2.1 and Figure 14.2.2 
which show selectively sampled reconnaissance drill holes with high grade intercepts 
likely following the trend of the main zone. Note that these reconnaissance holes are 
single and rather too isolated to be incorporated into the current 3D model.  
 
In section, the deposit is cone-shaped and is restricted to a vertical depth of about 
700 to 750 metres. This apparent limitation at depth may be an artifact of selective 
sampling and needs to be investigated.  
 

 Mineral Resource Recommendations 

In Micon's opinion, the deposit limits should be established prior to embarking on 
detailed economic studies. Thus, in the short term, defining the overall size of the 
deposit and its characteristics should be prioritized. Accordingly, Micon recommends 
a detailed exploration program east and west of the Brookbank deposit main zone 
along the main volcanic-sedimentary contact. The program should include a re-
examination of existing drill holes located along strike on either side of the deposit

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  225	

and re-sampling the entire drill hole lengths.  
 
New drilling should be carefully and systematically planned to take into account the 
possibility that the continuity of the deposit along strike may be in an echelon pattern.

 KEY LAKE 

The following Key Lake section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report on the Mineral Resource Estimates for the Hardrock, Brookbank, and Key 
Lake Projects Trans-Canada Property Beardmore-Geraldton Area Northern Ontario, 
Canada", dated January 30, 2013 and prepared by MICON International Ltd (Lewis 
et al., 2013). 
 

 Geological interpretation 

The Key Lake deposit comprises a series of 12 domains in an echelon arrangement 
in a north-westerly direction. The mineralization is generally of a low grade in the 
north-west end and medium grade in the southeast end. It has a volcanoclastic-
exhalative nature. Post mineralization processes have concentrated the 
mineralization into isolated high grade patches/pockets. 
 
Statistical analysis of raw assay data was conducted for Key Lake Project and 
deposit primarily to determine the mineralization indicator grade defining the 
envelopes of the resource zones, based on an interpretation of the log-probability 
curves obtained. 
 
 
Table 14.3.1 – Summary of Cut-off Grades for Mineralization Envelopes 

 
 

 Solid modelling/domain definition and compositing 

Using the envelope cut-off grades shown in Table 14.3.1, solids representing each 
deposit were modeled. The wireframes were constructed using a 3D interactive 
methodology. 
 
For the conventional wireframes the triangulation vertices defining the limits of each 
solid were snapped to the end points of the defined drill hole intervals to ensure 
proper sample capture. Snapped points were validated through visual checks. 
 
The composite lengths selected were 3.0 m for Key Lake Project. Composites were 
created within the solids/mineralized envelopes using the selected composite lengths 
down-hole and adjusting lengths to avoid rejecting the last composite at the bottom 
limit of the model. Composites were generated without applying grade capping so 
that legitimate high grade assays were honoured during interpolation, but, spatially 
restricted to prevent grade smearing.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  227	

 Composite Statistics 

Statistical analysis of composite samples within the solids/mineralized envelopes 
was performed to determine population patterns, restriction and/or top-cut values, 
and global means. A summary of the statistics is presented in Table 14.3.2. 
Representative examples of the relevant log-probability plot for each solid/domain in 
the Key Lake Project are shown in Figure 14.3.1.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  228	

 Spatial analysis/variography 

Variography was conducted for each domain/solid using composite samples in order 
to define the continuity of the mineralization to establish the maximum 
range/distance over which samples/drill hole intercepts may be correlated, and the 
optimum parameters for the search ellipse to be used in the interpolation of grades. 
 
For each domain, first a down-hole variogram was computed in order to establish the 
nugget effect; thereafter, three variograms to cover the principal geometrical 
directions were computed and modelled using the nugget effect established from the 
down-hole variogram. The Key Lake variographic analysis results indicate a pure 
nugget effect. The pure nugget effect for Key Lake is consistent with the results of 
physical examination of drill hole intercepts.  
 

 Block model definition and search parameters 

One 3-D block model was constructed using the GEMS version 6.4 mining software. 
The block model construction details are presented in Tables 14.3.3. 
 
 
Table 14.3.3 – Key Lake deposit block model 

 
 
 
Model was constrained by domain solids for Key Lake deposit. The upper limits, 
representing the surfaces/topographies, were generated from drill hole collars. 
Parent block sizes were based on the drill hole spacing and geometry of the deposit. 
Partial percentages were used at the solid/mineralization envelope boundary to get 
an accurate volume representation. Volume checks of the block models versus the 
mineralization envelopes revealed a good representation of the volumes of the 
solids. 
 

 Grade interpolation 

Grade interpolation for gold was performed using the Inverse Distance functions of 
the GEMS mining software. A three pass estimation procedure was used for the 
interpolation. The search ellipse configurations were defined using drill hole spacing 
for the Key Lake deposit combined with the geometry of the deposit. The search 
parameters adopted for the resource estimates are summarized in Table 14.3.4. 
 
 
Table 14.3.4 – Summary of search/interpolation parameters

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  229	

Grade smearing was minimized by restricting the influence of values exceeding the 
restriction grades (RG) shown in Table 14.3.5 Table 14.3.5 also presents a summary 
of the parameters and assumptions used for the mineral resource estimate. For the 
pass, the maximum number of samples per drill hole was set to control the number 
of drill holes in the interpolation.  
 
 
Table 14.3.5 – Summary of parameters and assumptions for the mineral 
resource estimate 

 
 
 

For Pass 1, the minimum number of samples and the maximum samples per drill 
hole for interpolation were designed to ensure that the nearest samples are 
accorded the highest weighting and that a minimum of the three closest holes are 
used in the interpolation. 
 
For Pass 2, the maximum number of samples per drill hole was designed to ensure a 
minimum of two drill holes in the interpolation, to go beyond the limits of Pass 1. 
 
For Pass 3, the minimum number of samples and the maximum number of samples 
per drill hole allowed the bigger ellipse to interpolate grades into the remaining 
blocks not covered by Passes 1 and 2. 
 
The representative resource block model showing distribution of gold grades is 
shown in Figure 14.3.2.

 Resource categorization 

Micon has classified resource blocks in the block model based largely upon the 
drilling density and the passes criteria described in Section 14.3.6, while also 
accounting for geological structures. 
 

14.3.7.1 Measured Resource 

The Measured resource category was assigned to the coherent portions of the 
deposit covered by Pass 1 of the search ellipsoid, excluding islands or sporadic 
small volumes. Adequacy of sample/drill hole coverage was confirmed visually. 
 

14.3.7.2 Indicated Resource 

The Indicated resource category was assigned to coherent portions of the deposit 
covered by Pass 2 of the search ellipsoid, including islands of Pass 1. Good visual 
evidence of adequate sample/drill hole coverage was also considered. 
 

14.3.7.3 Inferred Resource 

The Inferred resource category was assigned to Pass 3 areas, including islands of 
Pass 2. These areas have very limited drill hole information. 
 

 Economic pit shell versus underground 

The overall estimated block grades were examined for both "potential open pit" and 
underground mineral resource material at cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t Au and 2.8 g/t Au, 
respectively. (This is to say the prospects for economic extraction were based on 
cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t Au and 2.8 g/t Au for open pit and underground resources, 
respectively. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  231	

The resource block model was subjected to an analysis using a conventional Lerch-
Grossman algorithm with computer software, to define a series of potentially 
economic open pit shells, using the economic criteria described below. The resource 
block model constrained to a pit shell is shown in Figure 14.3.3. 
 
In order to run the Whittle economic pit optimization, assumed operating costs, gold 
recovery, and gold price were required. At this early point in project development, no 
detailed economic or metallurgical analysis has been completed: therefore, very high 
level economic estimates, typical of the size of a potential operation at the Hardrock 
project were assumed based on Micon's experience with similar operations. The 
metallurgical recovery was based on the historical recoveries in the Hardrock district 
updated for a modern process plant, and the gold price was approximately the three-
year trailing average. Table 14.3.6 shows the various parameter assumptions used 
in the open pit analysis as well as the gold cut-off grades used for the mineral 
resource estimate. 
 

Table 14.3.6 – Various Parameters used in the Open Pit Analysis 

 
 
Once the Whittle pit optimizations were completed, the results were brought back 
into GEMS where the block models were flagged for material in a potential open pit 
with material outside of that being flagged as potential underground material. The 
resulting pit is shown in Figures 14.3.3.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  234	

The Kailey deposit is a separate mineral deposit located within the confines of the 
Hardrock Project. The Kailey deposit is located 1.7 km north of the Hardrock 
Mineralized Corridor. 
 

 Solid modelling/domain definition and compositing 

The lower limit (Envelope Cut-off Open Pit) of the mineralized zones is 0.1 g/t Au. 
Using this envelope cut-off grades, solids representing each deposit were modeled. 
The wireframes were constructed using a 3D interactive methodology. For the 
conventional wireframes the triangulation vertices defining the limits of each solid 
were snapped to the end points of the defined drill hole intervals to ensure proper 
sample capture. Snapped points were validated through visual checks. The 
composite lengths selected were 3.0 m for Kailey deposit. Composites were created 
within the solids/mineralized envelopes using the selected composite lengths down-
hole and adjusting lengths to avoid rejecting the last composite at the bottom limit of 
the model. Composites were generated without applying grade capping so that 
legitimate high grade assays were honoured during interpolation, but, spatially 
restricted to prevent grade smearing. 
 

 Composite Statistics 

Statistical analysis of composite samples within the solids/mineralized envelopes 
was performed to determine population patterns, restriction and/or top-cut values, 
and global means. A summary of the statistics is presented in Table 14.4.1.

This section of the report is taken from the report titled "Trans-Canada Property, 
Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 
Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd and 
describes the results of the technical work undertaken by InnovExplo to produce a 
mine plan for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) Study for the Hardrock 
open pit project. The PEA was based on a Mineral Resource Estimate produced by 
InnovExplo in an earlier report prepared for the issuer titled "Technical Report and 
Mineral Resource Estimate for the Hardrock deposit (compliant with Regulation 43-
101/ NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated December 13, 2013. The PEA has not 
been updated in light of the current Mineral Resource estimate. 
 
References to Premier Gold in this section of the report shall be deemed to be

Cautionary Note 

The reader is cautioned that this Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is 
preliminary in nature as it includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that 
would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty 
that the PEA will be realized. 
 

 HARDROCK 

 Introduction 

This section describes the results of the technical work undertaken by InnovExplo to 
produce a mine plan for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) Study for the 
Hardrock open pit project. The PEA is based on a Mineral Resource Estimate 
produced by InnovExplo in an earlier report prepared for the issuer titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate for the Hardrock deposit (compliant with 
Regulation 43-101/NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated December 13, 2013. The 
PEA is compliant with Regulation 43-101. 
 
Mining of the Hardrock deposit has been designed as an open pit with a planned 
production of 3,650,000 tonnes per year (3.65M tpy) or 10,000 tonnes per day (tpd) 
of mineralized material processed at the mill during the first two (2) years, and of 
6,570,000 tonnes per year (6.57M tpy) or 18,000 tpd of mineralized material 
processed at the mill starting the third year for an average of 365 days per year of 
mill operation and mine operation. 
 

 Preliminary Geotechnical Assessment 

A preliminary geotechnical report for the pit slopes was prepared by Golder. This 
subsection is largely based on the Golder report. The preliminary design 
recommendations are indicated below. 
 

16.1.2.1 Hardrock Project Pit Slope Recommendations 

For purposes of erosion control and long-term slope maintenance, the overburden 
slopes will be excavated unbenched at 2:1 or better for ease of implementaion at 3:1

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  243	

and covered with up to 0.5m of short-haul waste rock from the open pit. A 3:1 slope 
would be more suitable for dozer work and placement of waste rock riprap. 
 
North Wall 

The achievable bench face angle will be the local dip of the foliation, with peak 
orientation in the 75-degree to 80-degree range. It is assumed that the slope should 
be amenable to scaling and breakback will be minimal with excellent wall control 
blasting practices. 
 

 Maximum inter-ramp angle (IRA) = 56 degrees 
 Bench height = 20m (double bench) 
 Design bench face angle = 80 degrees 
 Catch-bench width = 10m 

 
Note that this design provides some additional allowance for crest breakback 
assuming the acceptable minimum catch-bench width to manage rock fall hazards 
and allowing for periodic removal of accumulated debris for a 20m vertical bench 
separation is 8.5m. 
 
East Wall 

Golder recommends that at this stage of mine design, the North wall bench geometry 
and inter-ramp angle be used for the East wall, i.e. an IRA of 56 degrees. 
 
South and West Walls 

These slopes are assumed to have few significant kinematic controls. Achievable 
inter-ramp slope angles will be constrained by what can be accomplished with 
excellent and careful blasting practices and the need for catch-berms to contain rock 
fall and debris. 
 

 Maximum inter-ramp angle (IRA) = 59 degrees 
 Bench height = 20m (double bench) 
 Design bench face angle = 90 degrees 
 Catch-bench width = 12m 

 
The catch-bench width in excess of 8.5m assumes that some crest loss and catch-
bench width loss will occur, particularly on early, upper slopes, as blasting practices 
are refined. Consequently there may be opportunity for slope steepening based on 
slope performance. 
 

 Open Pit Optimization 

The objective of pit optimization and mine design is to evaluate the resource 
amenable to mining and use it as a basis for preliminary mine scheduling and 
economic analysis. 
 
The mineral resource block model developed by InnovExplo was imported into 
Whittle™ software from Dassault Systèmes GEOVIA (formerly Gemcom Software 
International). Design parameters such as operating costs, mine recovery, dilution 
and gold price were used to generate an optimal pit shell. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  244	

The original resource block model has a block size (in metres) of 5 x 5 x 5. 
Reblocking was done at 20 x 20 x 10. Reblocking is used to smooth pit walls and 
bottoms, to make room to use mining equipment, to make room for ramps, and for 
blast design optimization. 
 
To include the ramp in the Whittle analysis, many iterations were made with different 
slope angles. Ultimately, the slope angles that allow consideration of the ramp are 
estimated at 51° for the North, West and South walls and 59° for the East wall. Also, 
a 27° slope in the overburden was assumed. It was necessary to apply a 30-metre 
constraint around Lake Kenogamisis in Whittle because the generated pit outline 
overlapped with the lake.  
 
It was also decided that a temporary stockpile would be built for any mineralized 
material that could not be treated due to mill capacity. The stockpile contains mostly 
low-grade material that will be processed during the project. 
 
At this point in the process, advanced optimization features were used to optimize 
the mining phases, the mine schedule (Milawa NPV), and the stockpiles and cut-off 
grades (SPCO). Simultaneous Optimization (SIMO) was also used but the analysis 
was not completed. It requires throughput adjustments.  
 
InnovExplo evaluated dilution and mine recovery by performing an analysis of 
mineable blocks on typical plan view. To estimate dilution, a 0.5-m offset was applied 
on one side of each block. The dilution was then estimated at an average of 5% pure 
waste and mine recovery at 95% assuming that good blasting practices and good 
dilution control practices will be applied. Both dilution and mining recovery were 
applied to all mineralized material blocks.  
 
The milling costs and milling recovery were provided by BBA. The gold selling cost, 
mining cost and the general and administration costs were based on InnovExplo's 
recent experience. 
 
The Whittle analysis was carried out on an annual basis. In a future study, shorter 
periods should be examined. The Whittle optimization process made use of the 
parameters shown in Table 16.1.1. 
 

 Optimization Results 

A series of potential pit shells were generated by Whittle for the Hardrock project 
based on varying revenue factor. The pit shells were generated from revenue factors 
varying from 0.5 to 1.0. The revenue factors were applied to the base case gold price 
of C$1,300 /oz. The results of the potential pit shells are summarized in Figure 
16.1.1.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  246	

For each pit shell, Whittle calculates a best case scenario where every internal pit 
shell is mined out sequentially and a worst case scenario where mining takes place 
bench by bench. The best case scenario provides the upper NPV boundary limit 
while the worst case provides the lower NPV boundary limit. The optimal pit selected 
usually ranges between the best and worst case boundary limits. Based on the 
analysis of the Whittle pit shells, pit shell number 24 (twenty-four) with a revenue 
factor of 0.72 was chosen as the optimal pit shell for further phasing and scheduling 
for the Hardrock project. This pit shell was chosen because it has the least surface 
impact and the least disturbance on existing infrastructures. 
 
Smaller pit shells were used to determine the project pushbacks. 
 
The Whittle pit shell selected for this PEA generates 89,332,152 tonnes of 
mineralized material from which 72.4% are indicated resources and 27.6% are 
inferred resources, 376,381,926 tonnes of waste, and 15,278,785 tonnes of 
overburden. The estimated life-of-mine (LOM) average grade is 1.18 g/t. The mine 
would produce a total of 3,392,559 ounces of gold with a waste to ore stripping ratio 
of 4.21:1. Table 16.1.2 presents the distribution of mineralized material. 
 
 
Table 16.1.2 – Mineralized Material Distribution 

 
 
 

 Open Pit Design Specifications 

The selected Whittle optimized pit shell was used to design a ramp into the pit and 
the design was smoothed to remove irregularities that are inconsistent with operating 
practices.  
 
For the main pit, the ramp was designed for double-lane traffic in general, except for 
the last four (4) benches where the design calls for a single-lane ramp. Due to its 
smaller size, the east pit was designed with a single ramp (Fig. 16.2). All the other 
smaller pits do not have a final ramp due to their smaller size. The double-lane in-pit 
ramps will be 25.5 metres wide to accommodate a hybrid float of 133-tonne and 225-
tonne off-road class of rear-dump trucks and the single-lane in-pit ramps will be 
18.8 metres wide. The ramp exit is located on the south wall to be near the different 
facilities and stockpiles. 
 
The ramp gradient is 10%, and the ramp exit is planned on the south side of the pit 
to minimize the haulage distance to the waste dump. 
 
In summary, the mine design parameters are: 

 
 Maximum capacity of 225 metric tonnes for off-road haul trucks; 
 10-metre-high mining bench; 
 Double bench at final walls; 
 Ramp gradient of 10%;

 One-way ramp for the last four (4) permanent benches in the main pit; 
 One-way ramp for the east pit; 
 Temporary ramp for the last two (2) benches. 

 
The detailed pit design was achieved using the GEMS™ package software from 
Dassault Systèmes GEOVIA (formerly Gemcom Software International).  
 
The designed pit is approximately 1,415 metres long by 825 metres wide and 
465 metres deep. The detailed open pit design is shown in Figure 16.1.2.

 Mine Pre-Production Schedule 

During pre-production, 1,230,000 tonnes of waste, 400,000 tonnes of overburden 
and 200,000 tonnes of mineralized material will be mined. This amount of waste was 
estimated to start the construction of the dyke, tailings, roads and parking area.

 Mine Production Schedule 

The life-of-mine (LOM) schedule for the Hardrock pit was established to supply the 
mill with 10,000 tonnes per day (tpd) of mineralized material during the first two 
years and 18,000 tpd of mineralized material for the rest of the mine life.  
 
The stripping ratio (waste / mineralized material) varies from year 1 to 13, as 
presented in Table 16.1.3. The overall stripping ratio is 4.38. Table 16.1.3 also 
provides the yearly totals for the mineralized material, waste and overburden to be 
extracted over the course of the project. 
 
 
Table 16.1.3 – Production and Stripping Ratio per Year 

 
 
 
Based on the assumptions presented above, the LOM for the Hardrock project will 
be fifteen (15) years during which thirteen (13) years will be necessary to mine the 
pit. This schedule will yield a total of 89,332,152 tonnes of mineralized material at an 
average grade of 1.18 g/t. Table 16.1.4 provides a breakdown of the grade, quantity 
and source (open pit or stockpile) of the mineralized material to be processed each 
year.

Production during the first two (2) years will be lower, at 10,000 tpd, and production 
at full capacity will start during the third year at 18,000 tpd. The total amount of 
mineralized material to be processed during these first two years will be 7,300,000 
tonnes, for a total of 465,693 ounces of gold. 
 
Year 3 represents the first year of full production (18,000 tpd) for the Hardrock pit. 
Most of the mineralized material will be mined from Year 3 to Year 13; during this 
period, 72,270,000 tonnes of mineralized material containing 2,783,369 ounces of 
gold will be milled. Also during this period, more than 345.9 Mt of waste and 
overburden will be removed.  
 
Mining operations, drilling and blasting will cease in Year 13. In that year, the 
mineralized material stockpile will be the primary supply for the mill and will account 
for most of the production. A total of 5,537,763 tonnes from the mineralized material 
stockpile and 1,032,237 tonnes from the open pit will be processed by the mill 
resulting in the production of 150,300 ounces in Year 13; a reduction from previous 
years due primarily to the lower average grade during this period (0.71 g/t). 
 
During the last 2 years (14 and 15), mining will have completely ceased and the 
mineralized material stockpile will be the only supply for the mill. The total amount of 
mineralized material to be processed during these last two years will be 9,762,152 
tonnes, for a total of 143,501 ounces. 
 
Table 16.1.5 provides the daily production rates for mineralized material, waste and 
overburden per year of production.

 Mining 

Drilling 

A drilling pattern was estimated by InnovExplo. Ten (10) metres of benching and one 
(1) metre of sub-drilling were considered but the final design will be with double 
benches (20m) on final walls. A burden of 6 metres and a spacing of 6.5 metres 
were estimated. It was estimated that a maximum of 4 D55SP drills will be required 
for the project, and that one (1) DR540 drill will be necessary for pre-shear drilling. 
 
Blasting 

The type of explosive used for the project will be emulsion. Non-electric detonators 
will be used. It was assumed that an explosive manufacturing facility would be 
constructed on site considering the volume of explosives needed each year. 
 
Loading and Hauling 

A cycle time was estimated by InnovExplo to calculate the number of trucks required 
for this PEA. The main mining equipment required for this PEA are detailed in Table 
16.1.6. For this preliminary evaluation, InnovExplo used the following parameters: an 
average distance from the open pit to the waste stockpile of 1,408 metres; an 
average distance from the open pit to the mill/mineralized material stockpile of 1,093 
metres; open pit depth per production year; and the daily tonnage of mineralized 
material, waste and overburden shown in Table 16.1.7.  
 
Two types of trucks were considered for the project: 150 tonnes for mineralized 
material, overburden and waste and 250 tonnes for waste only. Diesel shovels were 
considered at this stage, but the option of using electric shovels should be evaluated 
in a future study. Two (2) 6050FS shovels and one (1) 6030FS shovel were selected 
for the project, as well as one (1) 994H front-end loader.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  253	

 BROOKBANK 

This section of the report is taken from the report titled "Trans-Canada Property, 
Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 
Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd. and 
describes the results of the technical work undertaken by Stantec Consulting Ltd. to 
produce a mine plan for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) Study for the 
Brookbank open pit project. The PEA was based on a Mineral Resource estimate 
produced by Micon International in an earlier report prepared for the issuer titled 
"Technical Report on the Mineral Resource Estimates for the Hardrock, Brookbank 
and Key Lake Projects, dated, January 30, 2013. 
 

 Overview 

The mine design considers the resource in the measured, indicated, and inferred 
categories between 325 metre elevation (surface) and -350 metre elevation (675 
metres below surface). Engineering and cost assessment work has been completed 
on the measured, indicated, and inferred resource material to a preliminary 
economic assessment (PEA) level of detail.  
 
The naming convention for the underground sublevels at Brookbank is metres below 
surface (i.e. 125L is 125 metres below surface). The surface elevation is nominally 
325 metres above mean sea level (i.e. 125L is at 200 metre elevation.). 
 
The mineralized resource between surface and -350 metre elevation is steeply 
dipping (85º) with an average width of 5.5 metres. The zone strikes southwest-
northeast with a maximum strike length of 300 metres. The geometry of the zone is 
shown in Figure 16.2.1, Figure 16.2.2, and Figure 16.2.3.

Based on the orientation, size, and suggested competence of the rockmass, open pit 
and underground longitudinal blasthole stoping have been selected as the most 
suitable mining methods. As Brookbank is located in Northern Ontario, personnel 
with mining experience are assumed to be available. The mining method requires 
mobile equipment that is commonly used in the industry. 
 
Figure 16.2.4 presents the envisioned site plan and surface infrastructure. The 
existing infrastructure includes: 
 

 Access roads. 
 Temporary camp facilities including a sewage system and well water supply 

for exploratory diamond drilling work. 
 Core shack.

 Diluted Gold Grade 

A diluted gold grade model has been developed for pit optimization. Developing such 
a model requires some initial assumptions that support a somewhat iterative process 
involving resource geometry, metallurgical recovery, operating costs, and revenue 
assumptions. It has been assumed that there will be dilution material coming from 
within the mineralized envelope at some grade and dilution material external to the 
mineralized envelope with no grade. Contact blocks on the edge of the mineralized 
zone are shown in Figure 16.2.14.

When initially considering a 1.2 g/t Au cut-off grade for processing, it was found that 
the average grade of the material below this cut-off within the mineralized envelope 
is 0.39 g/t Au to the 100 metre elevation and 0.34 g/t Au to the 270 metre elevation. 
When considering dilution of 25%, a weighted average of the mineralized and 
external waste resulted in an 18% reduction in average grade. The total average 
dilution grade will be 0.22 g/t Au within the area considered for open pit mining. 
 
The figures on the following page summarize calculations for economic and marginal 
cut-off grade, which is approximately 1.3 g/t Au.

 Pit Optimization Parameters 

16.2.12.1 Wall Slopes 

In the absence of a formal wall slope geotechnical evaluation, some general 
assumptions have been made for good quality rock. It has been assumed that 10 
metre benches can be doubled up between berms and that perimeter blasting 
techniques, including pre-splitting, will be used to increase bench face angles. 
 
The wall slope design parameters used for pit optimization are summarized in Table 
16.2.5 where it is shown that the inter-ramp wall slope could be approximately 55 
degrees and the overall wall slope with one ramp crossing is approximately 46.5 
degrees. 
 
For purposes of optimization rock was assigned a slope of 50 degrees. An 
overburden model was not available for slope coding. Final design slopes were 
based upon bench face angle and berm width.

16.2.12.2 Metallurgical Recovery 

A metallurgical recovery of 92.0% has been applied globally. A grade recovery 
relationship may be developed in the future with ongoing metallurgical test work but 
no such relationship is currently available. 
 

16.2.12.3 Metal Pricing 

A gold price of US$1,300/troy ounce with an exchange rate of C$1.00 = US$0.97 
was used for pit optimization. A transportation and refining charge of $4.00/ounce 
was applied. Royalties were not applied. 
 

16.2.12.4 Operating Costs 

Operating costs used for pit optimization are summarized in Table 16.2.6. The mine 
operating costs input were an average of three contractor quotes. Processing cost 
estimate of $31.71/t milled was provided by BBA with an additional allowance of 
$6.00/t milled for primary crushing and transportation. The G&A cost estimate was 
provided by Stantec. Mine operating costs were based on contractor mining. The 
mining cost estimates were based on local information from Stantec databases and 
an updated local contractor quotation.

16.2.12.5 Sustaining Capital 

Typically a sustaining capital allowance is made at the pit optimization stage of 
design to allow for incremental mining equipment requirements, capital required for 
tailings capacity increases, etc. Allowance for sustaining capital has not been made 
for the first iteration of optimization. The open pit mine life is expected to be relatively 
short and as a consequence, sustaining capital is not of great importance in the pit 
optimization process. 
 

16.2.12.6 Net Value Calculation 

A net value model item NET1 was populated for optimization. Block grades were 
factored for dilution, metallurgical recovery and a gold value of C$42.82/gram. 
 

16.2.12.7 Resource Classification 

Pit optimization has been undertaken using CATEG item with Measured (1), 
Indicated (2) and Inferred (3) resources. Within the limits of the unsmoothed pits 
developed as part of this study, only indicated resources were available for reporting. 
 

16.2.12.8 Pit Optimization Results 

The diluted model NET1 was used to generate a set of 30 nested pits for revenue 
factors ranging from 0.20 to 1.00. Application of a 1.30 g/t AUID3 in-situ cut-off grade 
resulted in an in-pit resource of 418 kt at 3.51 g/t Au in-situ grade. Application of 25% 
dilution and 10% losses to the in-situ resource results in an in-pit resource of 481 kt 
at 2.52 g/t at a strip ratio of 2.92:1 
 
A bench plan, section and perspective views of the ultimate and selected pit shells 
are shown in Figure 16.2.18 to Figure 16.2.22, as well as summary tables (Table 
16.2.7) of the pit optimization shells and selected pit resources.

 Pit Design 

A pit design was developed using the largest Lerchs Grossman pit limit, PIT30 as a 
guide. The West Pit design was generated using a 20 metre wide haulage road for 
two way traffic. The pit is 420 metres long in the east west direction and 85 metres 
wide in the north south direction and reaches a depth of 50 metres.  
 
A smaller East Pit design was generated using a one way ramp 12 metres wide for 
single lane traffic. The pit is 150 metres long in the east west direction and 90 metres 
wide in the north south direction and reaches a depth of 30 metres. 
 
Adding haulage roads and smoothing of the pit limits to a mineable shape added a 
considerable amount of waste rock to the point of an uneconomic volume.  
 
The West and East Pit preliminary designs are shown in Figure 16.2.23. A red grade 
shell for the net value of the resource at $42.20/t is shown superimposed on the pit 
designs.

The in-situ and diluted recoverable resources are summarized in Table 16.2.8. In-
situ resources were diluted by 25 percent. The average dilution grade was estimated 
to be 0.22 g/t and losses were assumed to be equal to 10% of the original resource. 
All reported resources are classified as "Indicated Resources". 
 
In-pit resources can be materially affected by changes in mining and processing 
costs, metallurgical recovery, and gold price assumptions. Increasing costs, 
reductions in recovery and pricing, results in increased cut off grades and reductions 
in the in-pit resources. The converse is also the case. 
 

 Open Pit Economics 

The open pit economics are summarized in the following table where an overall 
operating surplus is estimated based on the application of the pit optimization input 
parameters for operating cost and revenue assumptions. The surplus for the stand 
alone combined open pits is approximately $4.85 million. The unsmoothed pit 
showed a surplus of approximately $15.1 million. The difference is directly 
attributable to the increase in waste mined to enable access to the pit bottoms, 
smoothing of the pit walls and developing access to the east end of the west pit.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  279	

 Production Schedule 

A preliminary production schedule was prepared for the open pits based on a milling 
rate of 900 t/d for 350 d/yr. This schedule is summarized in Table 16.2.10. The total 
material moved will amount to 3.05 million tonnes. The total material milled will be 
0.5 million tonnes with an average grade of 2.31 g/t. 
 
 

Table 16.2.10 – Open Pit Mine Production Schedule 

 
 
 

 UNDERGROUND MINING 

This section of the report is taken from the report titled "Trans-Canada Property, 
Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 
report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd. and describes 
the results of the technical work undertaken by Stantec Consulting Ltd. to produce a 
mine plan for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) Study for the Brookbank 
underground project. The PEA was based on a Mineral Resources estimates 
produced by Micon International in an earlier report prepared for the issuer titled 
"Technical Report on the Mineral Resource Estimates for the Hardrock, Brookbank 
and Key Lake Projects, dated, January 30, 2013. 
 

 Primary and Secondary Access Underground 

The primary access to the underground mine will be via a single portal and main 
ramp from surface to the working levels. All active production levels will be accessed 
via the ramp (i.e. no captive levels) and personnel, materials, and rock will be 
transferred via the ramp. 
 
Secondary access/egress will be via the main fresh air raise. The fresh air raise will 
be constructed to provide fresh air to the ramp during the development phase and 
throughout the mine life and will be equipped with a manway. 
 

 Stoping Methods 

The resource is steeply dipping (~85 degrees) with an overall nominal thickness of 
5.5 metres. The underground portion of the resource is continuous and homogenous 
across the hanging wall and footwall of the deposit. For the purpose of this study and 
given these parameters, longitudinal longhole (blasthole) stoping with

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  280	

unconsolidated and consolidated rockfill has been selected as the primary mining 
method. 
 
Longhole is a widely used and proven mining method that involves common industry 
equipment and labour skillsets. Longitudinal longhole stoping requires less capital 
and operating development than transverse. There may be locations where the width 
of the resource exceeds 8 metres from hanging wall to footwall. In these instances, 
transverse mining may be considered in future studies but for the purpose of this 
study, longitudinal was used throughout. 
 
Sublevels have been designed at 25 metre vertical intervals (floor to floor) as 
required to mine the resource. On each sublevel, the resource will be accessed from 
the centre and developed east and west along strike to a minimum mining width of 
3 metres. In most cases, an overcut and undercut will be developed to mine the 
resource, but in some instances only an undercut will be developed followed by 
longhole uppers including inverse raising. Longitudinal mining will retreat from the 
outer limits back to the centre access point. The typical stope length will be 25 
metres but may vary at the extremities of the deposit. 
 
The resource has been divided into five mining blocks (Blocks A, B, C, D, and E). 
Mining will progress from the bottom of each block upwards. All stopes will be 
backfilled with waste rock. In some areas unconsolidated rockfill will be used. 
Consolidated (cemented) rockfill will be required when mining adjacent to a 
previously mined stope and to facilitate mining of each sill pillar. 
 
The mining method is illustrated in Figure 16.2.24.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  281	

16.3.2.1 Stope Undercut and Overcut Development 

Sill drifts (stope overcuts and undercuts) will be developed along the strike of each 
zone under geological control (i.e. under the direction of mine geologists). Sill drift 
widths will generally average 5.5 metres and the entire sill from the hanging wall to 
footwall contacts will be developed up to 10 metres wide. There will be some areas 
where the stope widths will be greater than 10 metres. Where sill widths exceed 10 
metres, two drifts will be developed. One drift will be developed along the hanging 
wall and another along the footwall with a pillar dividing the two. The minimum sill 
width will be 5 metres. 
 

16.3.2.2 Production Drilling 

Longholes will be 76 millimetre (3 inch) diameter and drilled with electric hydraulic 
top hammer drills. Typically, longholes will be drilled from the overcut down to the 
undercut sill with some breakthrough holes. In areas where up holes are required, 
holes will be drilled from the undercut to the upper limit of the stope (commonly 
referred to as blind uppers). Other holes will be fanned up along either the hanging 
wall or footwall to the contours of the stope limits. The drill pattern will include a 1.8 
metre ring burden with 2.2 metre spacing between ring holes. A drop raise will be 
drilled and blasted to create the initial void for production blasting. The estimated 
production drilling factor (excluding drop raises) will be 3.9 tonnes per metre of 
longhole. Production drills will be purchased by Premier Gold. Premier Gold drillers 
will be responsible for drilling and blasting production stopes.  
 
To extract each sill pillar, additional development including a haulage drift and 
transverse cross-cuts will be developed on the lower level of the block above. The 
cross-cuts will be extended through the consolidated backfill from the mining of the 
upper block. The development through backfill will be supported with shotcrete. 
To estimate the stope cycle time and productivity, an average daily production 
drilling rate of 140 metres has been used. The drilling rate accounts for lost time 
during the shift, which includes delays such as; workplaces not ready, lack of 
ventilation, insufficient water or air, and other delays resulting in idle time. Stopes will 
average 2,100 metres drilled (including drop raises and contingency for re-drilling) 
requiring approximately 16 drilling days (including moving in and out of the 
workplace). 
 

16.3.2.3 Production Blasting 

Longholes will be loaded with emulsion explosives. The emulsion will be detonated 
with non-electric blasting caps and boosters. The powder factor will be approximately 
1.3 kilograms of explosives per tonne of material. Emulsion storage bins and a 
mobile pump unit will be used for loading. Including the drop raise, stope loading and 
blasting will require approximately 11 shifts and will be completed by Premier Gold 
personnel. 
 

16.3.2.4 Stope Mucking 

Broken muck will be extracted from stopes using 8 cubic yard (8yd) class LHDs. 
When the stope drawpoint brow is closed with muck, the LHD will be operated 
manually. When the drawpoint brow is open, the LHD will be operated via remote 
control with the operator located in a remote bay, a safe distance away from the 
brow. The LHD will tram to a remuck on the level access. Muck dumped into a 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  282	

remuck will subsequently be loaded with an 8 yd LHD into a 50 tonne class haul 
truck (50t truck) and hauled to the surface storage pad. 
 
The production LHD will muck for 14 effective hours per day (including operator 
delays, 85% availability factor, and 50% allowance for remote mucking) and will 
average approximately 1,100 tonnes per day during the mucking cycle, requiring 
eight days to muck a stope. 
 

16.3.2.5 Material Rehandling and Underground Truck Haul 

Broken muck will be rehandled from a remuck with an 8yd LHD, loaded into a 50t 
truck and hauled to surface or to a level where backfilling is in progress. Due to the 
inaccuracy of LHD loading, the truck payload will be approximately 47 tonnes. 
The estimated daily productivity for a truck hauling material from each block to the 
storage pad is summarized in Table 16.2.11.

16.3.2.6 Backfill 

Stopes will be backfilled with unconsolidated and consolidated waste rock. Waste 
rock generated from development and open pit activities will be the primary source of 
backfill. Waste rock from underground and the open pit will be loaded into trucks and 
hauled to the surface waste pile. If a stope is available to be filled during waste 
haulage, the truck will dump waste into a remuck where it will be rehandled by an 
8yd LHD into the open stope. When additional waste is required for fill, the 50t trucks 
will backhaul from the waste pile on surface and deliver underground to a remuck 
near the open stope to be filled. 
 
A portable slurry mixing tank will be used to deliver slurry for waste consolidation in 
the stope. The portable slurry tank will be moved near the open stope requiring 
consolidated rockfill. Cement/water slurry will be transported via a series of 
boreholes from the batch plant located on surface to the underground slurry tank and 
mechanically agitated. A pipeline from the slurry tank will be directed to the open 
stope. The LHD operator will draw slurry from the tank while dumping a load of 
rockfill. 
 
Table 16.2.12 summarizes the waste tonnes generated through the life of the mine 
and the waste used for backfill.

16.3.2.7 Stope Production Cycle 

The production rate for longhole stopes has been based on an average stope size of 
8,600 tonnes, with an estimated 53 day mining cycle (drill-blast-muck-backfill). The 
resulting production from individual stopes will average 175 tpd (not including fill cure 
time). 
 
 

 
Figure 16.2.25 – Stope Production Cycle Time 
 
 
During steady state production, two blocks will be available for mining. Daily 
production will be from four active stopes, with sill development contributing on 
average a nominal 200 tpd (during steady state).

 Development 

There will be two development crews required throughout the project and operating 
period. Mining longitudinally will minimize development versus a transverse mining 
method. 
 
The first development crew will complete ramp access to the bottom of the first block 
(Block A) and continue the ramp down to access the remaining blocks. The second 
crew will complete level development to support production. The estimated 
development quantities are summarized in Table 16.2.13.

16.3.3.1 Ramp and Infrastructure Development 

The ramp will be developed 5.5 metres wide by 5.5 metres high at a maximum 
gradient of 17 percent. The ramp crew will prioritize the ramp face, with development 
to establish the access to each sublevel and associated initial infrastructure as a 
secondary heading. The ramp development crew advance rate will be 4.5 metres per 
day including remucks. The ramp floor will include a layer of ballast material and the 
roadway will be maintained by a grader to minimize equipment maintenance 
requirements. 
 
The main access to the levels will be developed 5.5 metres wide by 5.5 metres high 
up to the remuck. This will accommodate the 8yd LHD and 50 tonne trucks on the 
level for loading. The sublevels and sills will be developed 5.0 metres wide by 4.5 
metres high. Ancillary development such as refuge stations will be developed on the 
sublevel at a height of 4.5 metres. The infrastructure on sub levels will generally 
include: 

 Remucks and truck loading areas; 
 Electrical substations; 
 Material storage bays (on some levels); 
 Cap and powder mags (on some levels); 
 Sumps; 
 Fresh air raise access drifts (on some levels); 
 Refuge stations (on some levels); 
 One fuel and lube station; and 
 One service bay.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  285	

 
A development crew will consist of one lead miner and two development miners. The 
equipment used by the development crews will include a 2-boom jumbo, 8yd LHD, 
bolter, and a scissor lift. The development crews will drill and blast, muck to a 
remuck, and install ground support using the bolter. The crew will install ventilation 
and piping services and will remuck waste into the 50 tonne haul trucks. A fourth 
worker (haul truck operator) will haul the waste rock to another sublevel as backfill or 
to the surface waste stockpile. For the purposes of this study all waste material is 
assumed to be non-acid generating. 
 

16.3.3.2 Sill Development 

The level development crew will develop the sill drifts. The level development crew 
will drill and blast, muck to a remuck, and install ground support using the bolter. The 
crew will remuck broken material into a 50 tonne haul truck and a fourth worker (haul 
truck operator) will haul broken material to surface. Waste will be hauled to a remuck 
on a level where a stope is to be filled with backfill when available. Typical sublevel 
development is shown in Figure 16.2.26.

 Resource Analysis (Dilution and Recovery) 

16.3.4.1 Mining Dilution 

Two sources of dilution have been considered in estimating the Brookbank resource 
mined to surface. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  286	

Planned dilution includes low grade (below cut-off) material and/or waste rock that 
will be mined and will not be segregated from the mineralization. Sources of planned 
dilution include: 
 
Waste rock or low grade material that is drilled and blasted within the drift profile of 
sills. 
 
Waste rock or low grade material included within the drilling limits of the stope 
design. This includes internal waste pockets and footwall and/or hanging wall rock 
that has been drilled and blasted to maximize recovery and/or maintain favourable 
wall geometry. 
 
Several representative stopes have been designed to determine a global average 
grade for planned dilution for Brookbank. Planned dilution is directly reported for the 
representative stopes from the block model. 
 
Unplanned dilution includes low grade resource, waste rock, and/or backfill from 
outside the planned stope limits that overbreaks or sloughs into the stope during the 
mucking cycle and is delivered to the mill. Unplanned dilution was estimated at 15%. 
Visual inspection of core logs and discussions with geologists during a site visit 
indicated that the ground was of good quality. 
 

16.3.4.2 Mining Recovery 

Two recovery factors have been considered in establishing the resource mined to 
surface. 
 
Planned recovery includes the in-situ block model resource that will be accessed, 
developed, and mined. Any indicated mineral resource not included in the mining 
shapes (i.e. stopes) has not been included in the resource mined to surface. 
Reasons that some block model in-situ mineral resource will not be recovered may 
include: 
 
The resource includes a small volume that is separate from the main mining area 
and does not support the cost to develop and mine. 
 
The resource terminates between sublevels and would require mining excess 
dilution to recover. 
 
Random blocks within the block model that cannot be mined as part of an economic 
stope Figure 16.2.27). 
 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  287	

 
Figure 16.2.27 – Level Plan Showing Non-Recovered Resource 
 

A mining recovery factor (unplanned recovery) has been applied to account for 
material that is planned to be mined within the confines of the stope limits, but will 
not be recovered due to factors such as: 
 

 Poor ground. 
 Blasting difficulties (ground does not break properly and cannot be 

recovered). 
 Geometry of the mineralization. 
 Broken material that cannot be extracted (i.e. resting on the footwall, or 

around corners). 
 Unplanned mineralized pillars left in place. 

 
A 90% unplanned mining recovery has been used in estimating the resource mined 
to surface. 
 

16.3.4.3 Block Model Cut-Off Grade 

A 4.5 g/t Au block model cut-off grade was initially used to identify the mining areas. 
The following assumptions were made to establish the initial cut-off grade: 
 
Mine Operating Cost $120 per tonne 
 
Mill Operating Cost $30 per tonne (custom milling and transportation) 
 
Sustaining Capital Cost $20 per tonne 
 
Total Cost   $170 per tonne 
 
Gold Price $1,550 ($CAN) per ounce ($49.83 per gram) 
 

16.3.4.4 Underground Resource Mined to Surface – Estimate 

Based on the in-situ resource identified in the block model, the following 
methodology was used to estimate the resource mined to surface. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  288	

 The block model was reviewed in plan and in section to identify mineral 
resource above the 4.5 g/t Au cut-off grade, and to confirm the longitudinal 
mining method. Some of the areas above the cut-off grade were regarded as 
"outliers". The cost of development to access the "outliers" would be greater 
than the revenue generated from extraction and the mineral resource 
contained in the outliers was excluded. 

 Sublevels were designed at 25 metre vertical intervals, and vertical sections 
were cut through the model at 5 metre intervals along strike. Wireframe 
mining shapes were designed to encompass areas above cut-off ("outliers" 
excluded). 

 The in-situ tonnes and grade within each mining shape were extracted from 
the block model data. The mining shapes include any low grade (below 4.5 
g/t) material within the shape. This material represents planned dilution. 

 The unplanned dilution was estimated based on visual inspection of core logs 
during a site visit to the Brookbank Property and based on experience within 
the region.

16.3.4.5 Ground Support 

Ground support will be installed in all underground excavations. Standard primary 
ground support in the ramp and sublevel development headings will include 1.8 
metre 20 mm resin rebar (#6) installed at a 1.2 metre by 1.2 metre pattern with #6 
gauge welded wire mesh screen installed to within 1.5 metres from the floor along 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  291	

the drift walls. Where the span of the drift exceeds 7 metres (intersections, truck 
loading areas), 3 metre #7 resin rebar will be installed at a 1.7 metre by 1.7 metre 
pattern with #6 gauge screen. Shotcrete may be required for blocky ground 
conditions, if faults and shear zones are encountered. 
 
Ground support in sill drifts will include 1.8 metre 20 mm resin rebar (#6) installed on 
a 1.2 metre by 1.2 metre pattern with #6 gauge welded wire mesh screen along the 
back of the drift and 1.8 metre long (FS35) friction bolts on a 1.2 metre by 1.2 metre 
pattern with #6 gauge wire welded mesh screen installed to within 1.5 metres from 
the floor along the walls. Access along the sill drifts will be required for the life of the 
level. All sill drifts will be shotcreted along the back and walls to maintain 
uninterrupted and safe passage during mining. 
 
For sill widths greater than 10 metres, two sill drifts, i.e. one along the hanging wall 
and another along the footwall, will be driven with a minimum pillar width of 4 to 5 
metres between. In cases where the back span of the stope exceeds 10 metres, 6 
metre cable bolts will be installed. In the brow areas at the mucking horizon, 
additional support such as 6 metre cable bolts will be applied. 
 

 Underground Development Schedule 

A development and production schedule has been completed for the Brookbank 
Project. Underground development will begin in August 2016. The underground 
development and production schedule is summarized in Figure 16.2.30. Additional 
development schedule details have been included in the Gantt charts in the 
Appendix R.

 Underground Production Profile 

Brookbank will operate two shifts per day, seven days per week. Underground crews 
and maintenance workers will work 10 hours per shift. Management, administration, 
and technical services staff will work eight hours per day from Monday to Friday. 
Annual production has been based on 355 days per year. 
 
Each mining block will be extracted from the bottom upward. As the ramp is 
developed, access to the bottom of the blocks will be established. The undercut and 
overcut sill drifts will be developed and stopes will be extracted while the ramp 
development continues downward. A steady state production rate of 900 tonnes per 
day will be achieved in year 2021.

 Ventilation 

The steady state ventilation system design will be a positive or "push" system 
delivering up to 155 m³/s (329,000 cfm) through a dedicated 4.3 metre by 4.3 metre 
intake raise equipped with a manway for egress. Return air will flow up the main 
ramp to surface. The single primary fan will be located on surface and will be 
controlled by variable frequency drive to optimize air volume versus underground 
activity over the life of the mine. 
 
The region surrounding Brookbank has a continental climate that is characterized by 
cold dry winters and relatively warm dry summers. Daily temperatures range from 
+25ºC in summer to -22ºC in the winter. Temperatures as low as -35ºC and as high 
as +35ºC have been recorded. A direct fired propane mine air heating system will be 
installed to maintain approximately +3ºC mine intake air during winter months. A 
mine air cooling system will not be required. 
 
The main fan operating duty points are listed in Table 16.2.19. To obtain actual 
operating performance data, an Alphair ventilation fan was assumed.

16.3.9.4 Main Ramp Development 

The 5.5 metre wide x 5.5 metre high main ramp will be driven at a maximum gradient 
of -17 percent. The longest section of the ramp to ventilate before the first fresh air 
connection from the portal is approximately 610 metres. The auxiliary ventilation 
system is designed for an equivalent length of 640 metres (2,100 feet), which 
includes allowances for corners in the ramp. 
 

 LHD: 250 kW (335 HP) requiring 10.5 m³/s (33,500 cfm). 
 50 t haulage truck: 485 KW (650 HP) requiring 23.3 m³/s (65,000 cfm). 
 Two boom jumbo: 60 kW (80 HP) requiring 3.6 m³/s (8,000 cfm). 

 
The total volume of air required in the ramp has been designed to accommodate an 
LHD and a 50t truck. During ramp development a total of 47 m3/s (100,000 cfm) will 
be supplied via twin 1.22 metre (48 inch) metal ducting to the face. 
 
During ramp development, two 1.22 metre (48 inch) diameter steel ventilation lines 
connected to 75 kW (100hp) fans will be installed. Each duct will provide 23.5 m3/s 
(50,000 cfm). 
 

 Underground Mining Personnel 

The personnel required on site include management, technical services (engineering 
and geology), environmental, administration, maintenance, supervisory, and 
development/production personnel. The estimated annual personnel required on 
payroll are summarized in Table 16.2.23.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  300	

17. RECOVERY METHODS 

The following section of Recovery Methods is taken directly from the report titled 
"Trans-Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 

 HARDROCK 

 Conceptual Flowsheet 

The Hardrock Project is comprised of two (2) phases characterized by different 
throughput tonnages from the open pit mine. Both phases are illustrated in Table 
17.1.1. 
 
 
Table 17.1.1 – Project Phase Parameters 
Parameter Unit Phase I Phase II 
Years Active - 1 - 2 3 – 10 
Mill Throughput tpd 10,000 18,000 
Gold Grade - Average g/t 2.0 1.3 
Sulphide Sulphur Grade - Average % 1.7 

 
 
A preliminary flowsheet for Phase I was developed based on available metallurgical 
test work performed on the Global Composite. The flowsheet includes primary 
crushing, SAG and ball milling, gravity concentration, carbon-in-leach (CIL), cyanide 
destruction, carbon stripping, electrowinning and refining. The conceptual flowsheet 
for Phase I is shown in Figure 17.1.1. 
 
Phase II includes secondary crushing that will be added between the primary crusher 
and the covered rock stockpile. Other major modifications to the flowsheet include 
the addition of a second ball mill line as well as a second CIL line to accommodate 
the increase in tonnage. The gravity circuit, cyanide destruction and refining areas 
will remain as a single line although an additional gravity concentrator and cyanide 
destruction tank will be required. The conceptual flowsheet for Phase II is shown in 
Figure 17.1.2. 
 
Preliminary equipment sizes were selected based on available test work, similarly 
sized plants and typical industrial values. All sizing is based on a single composite 
and does not take into account any variability that may arise within the deposit.

 Crushing and Reclaim 

During Phase I, open pit run of mine material will be delivered to a stockpile or fed to 
the crushing circuit. Stockpiled material will be rehandled by a front-end loader. The 
50 in. x 65 in. gyratory crusher will reduce the rock size to minus 6 in. prior to being 
reclaimed by an apron feeder and conveyed to the crushed rock stockpile. In 
Phase II, the product from the gyratory crusher will be diverted to a double-deck 
screen. The screen oversize will feed a secondary cone crusher. The cone crusher 
product and double-deck screen undersize will be conveyed to the stockpile. 
 
The stockpile will have a 10,400 tonne live capacity which corresponds to an 
autonomy of 24 hours during Phase I and an autonomy of 14 hours during Phase II, 
consequent with the increased throughput. Apron feeders will reclaim the crushed 
rock from the stockpile and convey it to the SAG mill. The key crushing circuit and 
storage design criteria are presented in Table 17.1.2.

The process plant availability has been set at 92% based on typical industrial values. 
During Phase I, the 32 ft. x 14 ft. single-pinion SAG mill (7,500 kW) will be fed at a 
rate of 453 tph and will discharge over a vibrating screen. The oversize of the 
scalping screen will be recycled to the SAG mill feed and the undersize will 
discharge to the SAG mill pumpbox. The slurry will be transferred to the ball mill 
pumpbox, from where it will be pumped to the cyclone cluster. The cyclone 
underflow will feed a 20 ft x 30.5 ft single-pinion ball mill (6,500 kW). The target grind 
size has been set at 80% passing 75 µm. 
 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  304	

In Phase II, the increase in tonnage from 10,000 tpd to 18,000 tpd will lead to an 
increase in the transfer size from the SAG mill which will require additional grinding 
power at the ball mill stage. As a result, the SAG mill discharge pumps will feed the 
slurry to two parallel secondary grinding lines, each equipped with their own 
classification stage. The second grinding line will be equipped with a 22 ft x 32 ft, 
8,500 kW, double-pinion ball mill. The throughput to each line is considered 
proportional to the power of each ball mill and will be distributed as 353 tph to ball 
mill #1 (6,500 kW) and 462 tph to ball mill #2 (8,500 kW). The P80 will remain at 
75 µm for Phase II.  
 
The installation of a pebble crusher was not considered for either phase as 
preliminary mineralogy results indicate the presence of magnetite in the Global 
Composite. In addition, the available RWi data indicates that the RWi to BWi ratio is 
relatively low. This point will require additional investigation in the next study phase. 
For both scenarios, the mills sizing was derived from power calculations based on 
the available information. Modeling will be completed in the next study phase, once 
the required test work data becomes available.

17.1.3.1 Gravity Concentration and Intensive Leach 

In both Phases, a portion of the feed will be diverted from the ball mill circulating load 
to a gravity circuit. The slurry will be screened and processed through centrifugal 
concentrators. The gravity tails will be returned to the SAG mill pumpbox with the 
scalping screens oversize, while the gravity concentrate will feed a batch intensive 
cyanidation system. Periodically, the pregnant solution from the intensive leach 
system will be pumped to the electrowinning circuit. For Phase II, an additional 
screen and gravity concentrator will be required whereas the batch intensive 
cyanidation system will be initially sized to handle the higher gravity concentrate 
throughput. 
 
The preliminary circuit sizing should be reviewed once gravity recoverable gold 
(GRG) test work results become available. 
 
The gravity circuit preliminary design criteria are presented in Table 17.1.4.

17.1.3.2 Pre-Leach Thickening and Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) 

During Phase I, the cyclone overflow will feed a 34 m diameter thickener. The 
thickened slurry will be pumped to the CIL circuit sized for the 10,000 tpd throughput 
scenario. During Phase II, the cyclone overflow from ball mill #2 will be diverted to 
the 34 m diameter thickener and CIL line #1. The cyclone overflow from ball mill #1 
will feed a new 30 m thickener. The thickener underflow will feed the new CIL line #2 
sized for the additional 8,000 tpd. The new line is required to maintain the global 
leaching retention time from Phase I to Phase II. Both configurations are illustrated 
as a block diagram in Figure 17.1.3.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  306	

 
Figure 17.1.3 – Pre-Leach Thickening and CIL - Phases I and II 
 
 
The thickener's sizing is based on similar applications since test work data is not yet 
available. 
 
Each CIL line will be comprised of one (1) pre-aeration tank and six (6) CIL tanks 
with target retention times of 6 hours and 36 hours, respectively. A pre-aeration 
stage is recommended based on cyanidation test work discussed in 
Section 13.1.8.2.  
 
Periodically, when the carbon loading reaches a predetermined value, the contents 
of the first CIL tank will be pumped to the loaded carbon screen before the carbon in 
the following tanks is advanced in the circuit. The retained carbon from both lines will 
feed the stripping circuit while the slurry and wash water undersize will be recycled to 
the CIL circuits. 
 
The preliminary design criteria of the pre-leach thickening and CIL circuits for 
Phases I and II are shown in Table 17.1.5.

 Carbon Stripping, Refining and Cyanide Destruction 

For both Phases, a single line 6-tonne carbon stripping circuit will be used. The 
loaded carbon will be stripped from its gold content in a pressure Zadra elution circuit 
and the resulting pregnant solution will be sent to electrowinning cells where the gold 
will be recovered on the cathodes. The gold will be periodically washed from the 
cathodes, filtered and dried prior to being mixed with fluxes and smelted into doré 
bars. The stripped carbon will be reactivated in a kiln and returned to the last CIL 
tank(s). 
 
The CIL tailings stream(s) will be submitted to cyanide destruction with the SO2/Air 
process before being thickened and pumped to the tailings management facility. 
Preliminary design criteria for stripping, refining and cyanide destruction are 
presented in Table 17.1.6.

17.1.4.1 Tailings Thickening and Handling 

The CIL tailings will be thickened prior to being pumped to the tailings storage 
facility. For Phase I, the tailings will feed a 36 m diameter thickener from which the 
underflow will be transferred to the final tailings pumpbox. In order to facilitate 
operation in Phase II, a new, larger thickener (44 m diameter) capable of accepting 
the flowrate from both CIL lines is proposed. The existing tailings thickener will be 
decommissioned. In the next phase of the project, further analysis will validate if the 
thickener could be reused as a pre-leach thickener. In either case, thickener overflow 
will report to the process water tank. Key tailings thickening and handling preliminary 
design criteria are presented in Table 17.1.7.

17.1.4.2 Reagents 

Grinding media and mill reagents will be delivered to the site by transport truck and 
stored on-site. Grinding media, lime, sodium hydroxide, SO2 and hydrochloric acid 
will be delivered in bulk. Other reagents will be delivered in super bags, tote bins or 
drums depending on their application. 
 
Oxygen will be supplied as bulk liquid during the first two (2) years of operation. A 
Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (VPSA) oxygen plant will be installed for 
Phase II, to account for the higher oxygen consumption. No air distribution backup 
installation is planned.

 BROOKBANK 

 Historical Flowsheet 

Past processing at the Northern Empire Mill was done through a conventional whole-
rock leach circuit. The plant was operated at an average throughput of 200 tpd. Run 
of mine material underwent an initial size reduction step through a 0.91 metre (36 in.) 
x 1.22 metre (48 in.) Morgan Hammer jaw crusher and a secondary step through a 
0.91 metre (3 ft.) shorthead Simons cone crusher. The final grind size of 65% -200 
mesh was attained using a 2.13 metre (7 ft.) x 2.44 metre (8 ft.), 195 HP ball mill. 
The slurry density was increased to 50% solids in a 4.27 metre (14 ft.) thickener and 
the ground product was leached in a circuit consisting of four (4) agitated tanks for a 
total of 63 hours followed by five (5) CIP tanks. Atmospheric carbon stripping, 
electrowinning and the production of a dore bullion completed the gold recovery 
circuit. Chlorine gas was used for cyanide destruction on the carbon-in-pulp (CIP) 
tails stream prior to being pumped to the tailings storage facility. Gravity recovery 
equipment was installed towards the end of the operation. 
 
The plant operated on a discontinuous basis with various feed material (Leitch Gold 
mine, Leitch and Northern Empire dumps, gold concentrate from Macleod-Cockshutt 
mill, low-grade stockpile, bulk sample from East Leitch property, bulk sample from 
Nortoba-Tyson) in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.  
 
This section discusses the Brookbank run of mine material feeding the Beardmore 
mill. This option is the base case scenario which considers the Brookbank deposit as 
a stand-alone project, with its own dedicated milling facility. Option B explores the 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  312	

synergies of trucking the Brookbank material to the Hardrock mill. The flowsheet and 
design of the Hardrock mill are shown in Section 17.1. The Hardrock mill is designed 
to handle 10,000 tpd in Phase I and 18,000 tpd in Phase II. Material trucked from 
Brookbank would enter the Hardrock mill during Phase II. It is assumed that the mill 
will be able to handle the Brookbank material grades which are considerably higher 
than the Hardrock open pit grades. Additional reagents will be required to process 
the higher grade material from Brookbank. As a result, the operating costs of the 
Hardrock mill will increase as the Brookbank material is added to the mill.  
 

 Proposed Flowsheet 

Based on available historical information and test work, the proposed process 
flowsheet remains similar to the historical flowsheet. It includes primary and 
secondary crushing, single stage grinding, carbon-in-leach (CIL), cyanide 
destruction, carbon stripping, electrowinning, and refining. The corresponding block 
diagram is shown in Figure 17.2.1. 
 
The Brookbank Property will produce 900 tpd or 328,500 tpa of rock from an open pit 
and underground mine, with a combined average head grade of 5.3 g/t Au. The 
process plant is designed for an average throughput rate of 41 tph at 92% equipment 
availability. 
 
Equipment sizes were selected based on limited historical test work, similarly sized 
plants, and typical industrial values. 
 
For the purpose of this preliminary economic assessment, it has been assumed that 
equipment in the existing plant will not be reused and that a new building will be 
erected to house the proposed circuit. However the existing building could be 
converted for use as a warehouse for reagents storage.

Run of mine material will be fed via a conveyor belt to a 0.81 metre (32 in.) x 1.14 
metre (45 in.) jaw crusher located at the mine site. The run of mine material will be 
crushed to minus 89 mm (3.5 in.) and will be rehandled with a front end loader into 
40 tonne capacity trucks. Trucks will travel 27 kilometres along the mine access road 
and Highway 11 to the mill where a second crushing step, consisting of a cone 
crusher, will further reduce the rock size to minus 32 mm (1.25 in.). The crushed 
product will be conveyed and stored in a 500 tonne capacity bin.

The pre-leach thickener underflow will feed a series of six (6) carbon-in-leach (CIL) 
tanks with a total retention time of 48 hours, while the thickener overflow water will 
report to the process water tank and will be reused in the grinding circuit at the rate 
of 50 m3/h. 
Periodically, when the carbon loading reaches a predetermined value, the contents 
of the first CIL tank will be pumped to the loaded carbon screen before the carbon in 
the following tanks is advanced in the circuit. The retained carbon will feed the 
stripping circuit while the slurry reporting to the screen undersize will be recycled to 
the CIL circuit.

17.2.8.2 Fresh Water 

Fresh water will be pumped to the fresh water tank adjacent to the mill. The bottom 
part of the tank will serve as a reserve for fire protection while the upper part will be 
dedicated to mill usage for reagents preparation and gland seal water. Less than 
5 m3/h of fresh water will be required as make-up to the process water tank. A total 
of 15 m3/h, including the process water tank make-up, is required for the process 
plant operation.

18. PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

The following section of Project Infrastructure is taken directly from the report titled 
"Trans-Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 
References to Premier Gold in this section of the report shall be deemed to be 
references to the Limited Partnership as the context requires. 
 
 

 HARDROCK 

This section describes the mine site and mill site infrastructure that will be 
constructed. The proposed open pit is located at the intersection of Highway 11 and 
Michael Powers Blvd. which provides access the town of Geraldton. As a result, the 
existing Highway 11 will have to be relocated to accommodate the proposed open pit 
and a number of properties will need to be purchased. The project financials include 
these costs. 
 
Efforts have been made to minimize the area that will be disturbed by the 
construction of these facilities. The general arrangement of mine site surface 
infrastructure is shown inFigure 18.1.1.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  321	

 Mine Site Surface 

The mine site infrastructure will be located west of the proposed open pit and 
between the old highway 11 and the new highway 11 relocation. The surface site 
infrastructure will include: 
 

 Roads 
 Parking areas  
 Temporary mining camp 
 Mine Dry and Office building 
 Repair Shop, Warehouse Building 
 Surface Water Distribution System 
 Non-Acid Generating Waste (NAG) Storage Area 
 Ore Pads 
 Mill feed Storage Area and Crushing Plant 
 Mill Plant 
 Power Distribution System 
 Mine Water Treatment Facility  
 Sewage Treatment Facility 
 TMF Tailings Area 

 
18.1.1.1 Roads 

Existing Highway 11 Road to Site 

The main access to the Hardrock project will be via the western leg of the existing 
highway 11 road. This access to the Hardrock site will be used by personnel, 
material deliveries, and haulage trucks transporting material to the mill. Upgrades to 
the road will not be required as they are assumed to be currently rated for the loads 
expected. The road will be maintained by Premier Gold personnel year round.  
 
Highway 11 Relocation 

Relocation of the existing highway 11 is required to accommodate the Hardrock 
project. Six different options were reviewed and option 2 (4.2 kilometers of new road) 
was recommended to be put forward to the provincial Ministry of Transportation. This 
new road will by-pass the Hardrock project, connect with Michael Powers Blvd, 
provide access to Geraldton and will also allow access to the old highway 11, which 
will be the main road access to the Hardrock Property.  
 

18.1.1.2 Relocation of Existing Properties 

The Hardrock open pit project located at the junction of highway 11 and the Michael 
Powers Blvd, the main access road to Geraldton, Ontario. As a result of this project, 
existing buildings along these major highways will require relocation which includes 
54 residences, a police station, a gas station and general store as well as the 
McLeod tailings area. A security building will be located at the main mine site 
entrance. 
 

18.1.1.3 Parking Areas and Security Building 

Four parking areas have been provided for the project. A central parking facility for 
the mine operations and maintenance crews, offices/work areas for all mine 
technical, supervisor, and management personnel, and mine rescue equipment 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  322	

maintenance and storage. A second parking facility closer to the mill for the mill 
crews, a parking area for the temporary mining camp and a parking area for the 
open pit equipment have also been included. 
 

18.1.1.4 Temporary Mining Camp 

A small temporary mining camp will be located near the main access road to the 
project. The temporary camp will include a mine dry, office and cafeteria facilities 
which will be used during the first two years of the project. The portable trailers will 
be installed to accommodate the construction and development personnel required 
to complete the construction of the garage, administration and mill buildings. 
 

18.1.1.5 Mine Dry, Office Building and Assay Lab 

A two story 50 m x 22 m mine dry and office building has been included for this 
project. The mine dry will be capable of accommodating 300 people and the office 
building will be comprised of conference rooms, washroom facilities, mine rescue, 
first aid and filing rooms as well as office for management staff, operating and 
maintenance, geology, engineering and administration personnel. An assay lab will 
be built within the mill complex. 
 

18.1.1.6 Repair Shop and Warehouse Building 

The shop and warehouse building will be approximately 100 metres by 40 metres in 
size. The shop will have nine bays to service open pit trucks and other surface 
equipment. It will be equipped with an overhead crane and will provide adequate 
space for the storage of maintenance tool cabinets and other items required for 
maintaining the mobile fleet. 
 
The warehouse will be located in the back of the shop and will store mobile 
equipment parts and other material required throughout the life of the mine. The 
repair shop will also have adequate space for office/desks to manage the 
maintenance of the open pit fleet. 
 

18.1.1.7 Surface Water Distribution System 

The surface water distribution system will provide fire water and service water to all 
of the surface buildings on the mine site. This system will also provide water for 
mining personnel working at the mine, for eyewash, safety shower, hand washing, 
toilets and urinals.  
 
The mine site will be connected to the Geraldton municipal water system and 
upgrades to the current system are required. The upgrade costs have been assumed 
to be absorbed by the municipality and have not been included in the project capital 
cost. It is unclear at this time if the potable water can be used for drinking and/or 
cooking consumption and bottled drinking water will be used if required. Operating 
costs for the potable water are deemed small and have not been included in the 
mine operating cost. 
 

18.1.1.8 Non-Acid Generating Waste Rock Storage Area 

The non-acid generating waste (NAG) area is sized to accommodate 390 million 
tonnes of material. The large pile of waste material is estimated to be 60 metres high 
and is an odd shape in order to remain on Premier property. A ditch system 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  323	

surrounding this area will be constructed to collect and sample water to be treated at 
the waste water treatment plant if required. 
 

18.1.1.9 Acid Generating Waste Rock Storage Area 

Until further tests are performed there is no acid-generating waste rock storage area. 
At this time it is assumed that any small amounts of PAG waste will be stored in the 
NAG area.  
 

18.1.1.10 Ore Pads 

Three separate ore pads (178,000 square metres) will be located east of the mill and 
are capable of storing up to 1 million tons of ore material. The three ore pads will be 
lined as some of the ore material is acid generating. As a result, a ditch system will 
be constructed to surround the pad area, collect the run-off water and be treated 
through the waste water treatment facility.  
 

18.1.1.11 Mill Feed Storage Area and Crushing Plant 

A truck dump and primary crusher will be located east of the mill and adjacent to the 
open pit road. The dump will be capable of handling up to 200 tonnes trucks. The 
primary crusher will feed the mill storage area, located north of the mill. The mill feed 
storage area is a fully enclosed area and will accommodate 47,000 tonnes of 
material providing 1.5 days of storage. 
 

18.1.1.12 Process Plant 

The Hardrock mill will include primary and secondary crushing, double stage 
grinding, carbon-in-leach (CIL), cyanide destruction, carbon stripping, electrowinning, 
and refining (more details presented in Section 17). The mill will be built in two 
stages: Phase 1 will be capable of processing up to 10,000 tpd of ore and Phase 2 
will bring the plant capacity to 18,000 tpd.  
 

18.1.1.13 Power Distribution System 

Power for the Hardrock site will be supplied by Hydro One Networks. Sufficient 
capacity and a connection point are assumed available at the intersection of Hwy 
584 and Hwy 11. The existing substation will remain in place however upgrades and 
a new project substation are required to accommodate the Hardrock project. A total 
of $8.0 million has been allocated. 
 
The main site electrical switchyard and substation will be located adjacent to the mill 
and the parking lot. All site primary power distribution will be via overhead lines, with 
local outdoor type e-houses for transformers and load centres at each point of 
utilization.  
General site lighting will be a combination of power line pole mounted fixtures and 
building mounted fixtures at the offices, shop, and other miscellaneous buildings.  
 

18.1.1.14 Mine Water Treatment Facility 

Water treatment is anticipated for mine water, ore pad runoff, waste rock pile runoff, 
and from the TMF discharge. As cyanide in tailings will be destroyed in the mill using 
the Air/SO2 treatment method, the parameters of concern will likely be arsenic, 
metals (likely copper from the Air/SO2 treatment), ammonia, and TSS. It has been 
assumed that water treatment will be carried out using a high density sludge (HDS) 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  324	

clarifier / thickener system, and a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). As the project 
progresses and the flows and concentrations of effluent parameters are better 
understood, further refinement of the best treatment strategy will be possible. 
 

18.1.1.15 Sewage Treatment Facility 

A sewage treatment facility capable of handling a group of 300 people is envisaged 
for this project. A packaged treatment plant will be required with a permitted 
discharge consisting of an outfall pipe and diffuser to the selected surface water 
receiver.  
 

18.1.1.16 TMF Tailings Area 

The TMF (tailings management facility) will be constructed several kilometers to the 
south west of the mine site in two stages, with Stage 1 having capacity to store the 
first 2 years of tailings production at a milling rate of 10,000 tpd, and the relocated 
MacLeod tailings from stripping activities (estimated by Premier to be 1.32 Mt) 
required for open pit construction. Subsequent raises will be carried out to coincide 
with operations, but will likely be done on a 2 year cycle, and consist of downstream 
raises.  
 
The containment dams will be constructed with NAG mine waste rock with upstream 
impermeable membrane and seepage cut off. Construction of the TMF will be done 
largely using the mine fleet, and as such costing for much of the construction has 
been included in the TMF costs. Equipment and trucking costs as well as 
compaction of waste rock along with specialty materials for slope protection, an 
impermeable upstream barrier, and filters have been included in the TMF

(300 USgpm) of water to the water tank. 
 
Pump House No.2 will be located near the water tank. The pump house will contain 
two 20 HP pumps (1 Duty, 1 Spare) used to supply service water for the batch plant 
and service water underground. Average batch plant water consumption is estimated 
to be 3.15 L/s (50 USgpm) and underground peak water consumption is estimated to 
be 16.5 L/s (261 USgpm). Each of the pumps will deliver up to 20.2 L/s (320 
USgpm). Pump House No. 2 will also contain two 40 HP pumps for fire suppression 
in the surface buildings. The fire pumps will each be capable of delivering up to 53.6 
L/s (850 USgpm) of water via a buried DN200 (8") schedule 40 pipe loop that will 
ring the surface buildings and connect to the fire sprinklers in each building. 
 

18.2.1.7 Parking Area 

Two parking areas will be provided. A common parking area will be sized to 
accommodate site personnel and visitors and will be located to the north east of the 
proposed gate house. 
 
A parking area for surface and underground equipment will be located adjacent to 
the warehouse/shop building. Surface service vehicles and underground equipment 
will park in the area during shift change. 
 

18.2.1.8 Non-Acid Generating Waste Rock Storage Area 

The non-acid generating waste (NAG) area is sized to accommodate 2 million 
tonnes of material (1,175,000 m3). A portion of the waste will be used as backfill to fill 
underground stopes. A ditch system surrounding this area will be constructed to 
collect and sample water to be treated at the waste water treatment plant if required. 
 

18.2.1.9 Mill Feed Storage Area and Crushing Plant 

The mill feed storage area will be located west of the NAG area, east of the site 
access road. A geomembrane will be installed to capture runoff water to be treated 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  329	

at the waste water treatment plant. The mill feed storage area will accommodate 
14,000 tonnes of material providing 16 days of storage. 
 

18.2.1.10 Power Distribution System 

Power for the Brookbank site will be supplied by Hydro One Networks. Sufficient 
capacity and a connection point are assumed available at the intersection of 
Windigokan Rd and Hwy 11. Hydro One has been contacted, and a New Customer 
Connection Request has been submitted on behalf of the project such that Hydro 
One can evaluate internally whether sufficient system infrastructure and capacity is 
available. At the time of writing, confirmation has not been received from Hydro One. 
 
To service the site, a new overhead power line from Hwy 11 to site will be 
constructed. Included with the power line are fiber optic services from Hwy 11 for 
business system/internet service. It is assumed that sufficient bandwidth exists at the 
Hwy 11 intersection connection point. 
 
The main site electrical switchyard and substation will be located adjacent to security 
and the parking lot. All site primary power distribution will be via overhead lines, with 
local outdoor type e-houses for transformers and load centres at each point of 
utilization. The electrical distribution system includes an allowance for a diesel 
generator for mine dewatering if required. 
 
General site lighting will be a combination of power line pole mounted fixtures and 
building mounted fixtures at the offices, shop, and other miscellaneous buildings.  
 
Underground facilities will be code compliant but not elaborate. A minimalistic yet 
flexible approach will be used for services, localized lighting, and automation. Most 
electrical equipment will be located within mine power centres (MPC's) located 
adjacent to the point of utilization (e.g. dewatering sumps). 
 
A dual circuit feeder will be provided for underground power, allowing for leap-
frogging of the feeders during development and balancing production loads later on. 
The total load for underground, approximately 3.5 MVA, includes dewatering and 
mining of three faces on two levels each. 
 
The estimate assumes that the electrical feeders will be installed in the ramp, but 
they can be routed down the FAR if preferred. The cables will be terminated in 
junction boxes at each level. 
 
Underground communication will be by leaky feeder, and hardwired telephone. 
There will be no advanced automation or communication systems.

18.2.2.2 Underground Infrastructure 

Mine Dewatering  

Water from mining operations, backfill decant, and groundwater will be collected in 
sumps throughout the mine. The water collected in the sumps will be pumped to 
surface using the mine dewatering system. A total peak inflow of 31.6 L/s (500 
USgpm) has been assumed during full mine production. During development, 
submersible pumps will remove water from the mine, until such time as the main 
pump stations are established. 
 
There will be two main pump stations, one located on the 300L and one located on 
the 600L. Each Main Pump Station will include a settling sump and a clean water 
sump. The settling sump will collect water from borehole sumps, collection sumps 
and from the level. The settling sump will be driven at a -20% grade to allow for LHD 
access to clean out the slimes. The settling sump will be connected to a nearby 
clean water sump using horizontal boreholes. "Clean" water will overflow from the

 HARDROCK 

 Land Use 

The Hardrock Project is located in a relatively remote area of Ontario, approximately 
280 km north east of Thunder Bay. The Project is located just a few kilometers south 
of the community of Geraldton (at the intersection of Michael Powers Blvd and 
Highway 11), which is part of the amalgamated Town of Greenstone, Ontario. 
Topography is relatively flat to gently rolling. The Municipality of Greenstone Official 
Plan (June 2010) designates the current zoning for the project lands as "Rural" and 
as "an area of mineral potential". 
 
The Project is situated within a historic mine site. The former underground 
operations include the MacLeod - Mosher Mine and the Hardrock Mine. Each mine 
site was subject to mine closure work and rehabilitation in the late 1990's.  
Highway 11 (also known as the Trans-Canada Highway) traverses the property in an 
east ‐ west direction immediately north of the Project site. Small town sites related to 
historic mine operations lie to the northwest (MacLeod Townsite) and to the east 
(Hard Rock Townsite).  
 

 Noise and Air Quality 

The Project is located in an environment close to a major highway, but still relatively 
remote. Existing anthropogenic noise sources in the area include the road traffic and 
recreational activities. 
 
There is no heavy industry in the direct vicinity of the Project and background 
concentrations of air contaminants are expected to be minimal. Site specific 
background air quality data is not available for the Project site, however monitoring 
equipment has been installed by Premier and data collection is underway.  
 

 Terrestrial Environment 

The Project lies within the Boreal Shield, a Canadian ecozone where the Canadian 
Shield and the boreal forest overlap. Precambrian bedrock at or near the surface 
plays an important role in shaping the biophysical landscape. Lakes, ponds and 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  337	

wetlands are abundant in this land scape and drainage patterns are typically 
dendritic, with sporadic angular drainage as influenced by bedrock outcrops.  
 
An Environmental Constraint Analysis (ECA) map was completed by Parks 
Environmental Inc. (Parks) within the general vicinity of the Project using data 
collected from Provincial databases. The mapping showed the MacLead Provincial 
Park is located immediately to the east of the study area, south of Highway 11, along 
the shores of Lake Kenogamisis. Three raptor (osprey) nests were also identified 
within the Project area, along with several moose aquatic feeding areas. 
In addition to the ECA mapping, Parks undertook a number of spring terrestrial 
baseline surveys for the Project. These studies and key findings are summarized 
below: 
 

 Ecosite Description and Mapping (Wiltshire/Parks 2013): Forest and 
vegetation communities sampled within the study area were typical of the 
boreal forest in Northern Ontario. Terrestrial plant communities were 65% 
conifer dominated forest, 18% hardwood dominated forest, 4% conifer 
mixedwood, and 9% non-forested. There were no species of interest (i.e. 
rare, threatened or endangered plant species) identified during the time of the 
spring survey. 

 Breeding Birds (Parks 2013a): There were a total of seventy-eight species 
identified during the Breeding Bird survey. In addition, the survey noted a 
number of incidental bird observations in the study area. The following 
species at risk were noted during the survey: Barn Swallow; Olive-sided 
Flycatcher and the Canada Warbler; Eastern Whip-poor-will; American White 
Pelican; and, Bald Eagle (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). The 
Eastern Wood Pewee was also identified during the survey which is a 
species of special concern (COSEWIC 2012). Additional multi-seasonal 
baseline work will be undertaken to confirm breeding/migration and confirm 
the presence or absence of potential species at risk during the environmental 
baseline program.  

 Amphibians (Frogs) (Parks 2013b): There were no frog species located 
during the study which were listed on the Species at Risk list for Ontario 
(Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). 

 
Additional terrestrial environment data collection and analysis were completed by 
Premier in 2014 as part of the environmental baseline program and is continuing in 
2015. 
 

 Hydrology 

The Project is located in the Southewestern Hudson Bay Watershed. The main 
waterbody in the study area is the Kenogamisis Lake. The Lake consists of West 
Barton Bay, Central Basin and Southwest Arm. These are described further below: 
 

 The West Barton Bay Basin - encompasses McKenzie Creek, Magnet Creek, 
Dionne Creek and a number of small tributaries contributing to the western 
part of Barton Bay up to the Main Street Bridge. The total watershed area of 
the West Barton Bay Basin is about 145 km2. It is subdivided into the Magnet 
Creek watershed with an area of 76 km2, the Dionne Creek watershed with 
an area of 49 km2, and small tributaries including Longacre and Marron 
Lakes of total area of about 20 km2. 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  338	

 Central Kenogamisis Lake Basin - encompasses the Barton Bay area 
downstream of Main Street Bridge up to the Highway 11 Bridge and the 
central part of Barton Bay. Hardrock Creek and Mosher Lake are also parts 
of this basin. The total area of the Central Kenogamisis Lake watershed area 
is about 30 km2.  

 Southwest Arm Basin - encompasses South Creek, small creeks around 
Lahtis Road, and Goldfield Creek. The watershed area of Goldfield Creek is 
34 km2 and total contributing area to the Southwest Arm Basin is about 55 
km2.  

 Kenogamisis River Basin - is located upstream of the Southwest Arm Basin 
and encompasses the large watershed area of the Kenogamisis River, 
Parent Creek, Rogers Creek, and McKnight Creek. The total watershed area 
of the Kenogamisis River Basin is about 800 km2. It is the main contributing 
source of water to Kenogamisis Lake.  

 
WESA (November 2013) has undertaken some hydrological work for the Project; 
however, the majority of this is based on predictive modeling. Premier will be 
undertaking additional hydrological (flow and water levels) monitoring as the Project 
progresses. 
 

 Aquatic Environment 

20.1.5.1 Fish and Fish Habitat 

Historic information on the Kenogamisis Lake fish community from 1977 to 2011 was 
obtained from the Ministry of the Environment database (OMOE, 2011). A site 
specific survey was conducted by Parks (Parks 2011) to document baseline 
conditions in Kenogamisis Lake, within the general vicinity of the Project. Preliminary 
fisheries information is summarized below:  
 

 Goldfields Lake: walleye recreational fishery 
 Longacre Lake: commercial baitfish 
 Marron Lake: northern pike recreational fishery  
 South Magnet Lake: northern pike recreational fishery 
 Magnet Creek and McKenzie Creek: migratory corridors for spawning walleye 
 Northern pike and yellow perch have been noted in other watercourses by 

locals 
 
At this time, there are no known aquatic species at risk within the vicinity of the 
Project.  
 
Walleye mark-recapture studies completed in 1991 and 1992 (OMOE, 1999) suggest 
that spawning fish utilize Magnet Creek and the main inflow to Kenogamisis Lake in 
the Southwest Arm as staging and potential spawning areas. No information on 
spawning habitats or activities for other fish species has been assessed, nor have 
creeks, rivers or lakes in the broader watershed been surveyed for spawning 
activities or habitat at this time. 
 
Additional data collection and analysis is underway by Premier, as part of the 
environmental baseline program, to characterize fish and fish habitat.

20.1.5.2 Fish Tissue Metals 

Metals in fish tissue from Kenogamisis Lake have been assessed from 1977 to 2011 
(MOE, 1992, 1999, Parks Environmental Inc. 2012b). Mercury levels in Kenogamisis 
Lake sport fish tissue have been consistent over this period (1977 to present). 
Tissue concentrations of Mercury are generally higher in fish from Barton Bay than 
the rest of Kenogamisis Lake fish. With the exception of elevated levels of Arsenic, 
metal concentrations in Kenogamisis Lake sport fish are typical of those found 
elsewhere in Ontario.  
 
Premier is continuing to undertake fish tissue analysis as part of the Environmental 
Baseline program.  
 

20.1.5.3 Sediment Studies 

Studies of Kenogamisis Lake and Mosher Lake sediments focused on metals and 
total organic carbon (OMOE 1991, Parks Environmental Inc. 2011). 
 
A large number of parameters (TOC, arsenic, chromium, copper, iron, lead, 
manganese, mercury nickel, phosphorus and zinc) in surface sediments exceeded 
PSQG and were statistically higher than background levels in West Barton Bay, 
Barton Bay and the MacLeod Basin of Kenogamisis Lake. This can be predominantly 
related to historic mining and/or municipal discharges to the lake as pre-industrial 
sediments were typically 20% lower.  
 
Mosher Lake sediment arsenic, cadmium and phosphorus concentrations were 
found to be above PSQG and above background levels. Total organic carbon and 
copper also exceeded PSQG but were not statistically different from background 
levels. These elevated metal concentrations are attributed to historic mining 
operations. 
 
Premier is continuing to undertake sediment quality analysis as part of the 
Environmental Baseline program. 
 

20.1.5.4 Benthic Studies 

Several studies assessing the benthic communities in and around Kenogamisis Lake 
have been conducted over the past three decades (OMOE, 1982, OMOE, 1991, 
Cordillera Consulting Inc., 2010). The most recent study by Cordillera Consulting 
(2010) focused on South Creek and the Southwest Arm of Kenogamisis Lake and 
provided baseline benthic community data to which future studies could be 
compared. Additional data collection and analysis is underway by Premier as part of 
the Environmental Baseline program. 
 

 Water Quality 

The majority of water quality studies conducted in the area have focused primarily on 
Kenogamisis Lake (OMOE 1980, 1982, 1991, 2002, SNC Lavalin 2008, Brugger 
2011, Parks Environmental Inc. 2011). Current (2011) water quality is consistent with 
that reported previously in 2010 and earlier studies by SNC Lavalin dating back to 
1996 (SNC Lavalin, 2008;, Brugger, 2011). The water quality of Kenogamisis Lake 
continues to have elevated arsenic, iron and phosphorus concentrations; particularly 
in Barton Bay as a result of historic mining operations and/or municipal development. 
Water quality has changed little over the last twenty years for the majority of 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  340	

parameters, even those which have the greatest number of PWQO exceedances 
(i.e. arsenic, iron, phosphorus). 
 
Studies conducted in April, 2011 (Parks Environmental Inc. 2011) focused on the 
Kenogamisis River Inflow, Goldfield Creek, South Creek, Hardrock Creek, Magnet 
Creek, Mosher Lake, McKelvie Creek, Mineral Creek, Octopus Creek and the 
Kenogamisis Lake Outflow. Results of sampling tributary inflows indicated better 
water quality in comparison to lake values. These watersheds have a known history 
of industrial and/or municipal development. Aside from elevated arsenic, phosphorus 
and iron concentrations in Hardrock Creek, the remaining sampled tributaries did not 
have exceedences of the PWQO or interim PWQO values. 
 
Premier is continuing to undertake a detailed surface water quality sampling program 
as part of the environmental baseline program. 
 

 Hydrogeology 

The Hardrock deposit lies within an east-west oriented greenstone belt, which 
contains assemblages of clastic metasediments and minor mafic volcanics. The 
Project lies along the southern boundary of the Bankfield-Tombill Fault, a major fault 
zone which strikes N 770 W and dips 770 S and shows strong evidence of shearing 
and brecciation (Reddick Consulting Inc., 2010). The extent to which structural 
features, fracturing, and mineral alteration are able to provide secondary porosity 
effects to facilitate groundwater movement has not been investigated. 
 
WESA (2011) completed a hydrogeological investigation in support of a closure plan 
(Premier Gold 2011), which involved the installation and monitoring of five 
groundwater monitoring wells completed to depths ranging from approximately 2.3 to 
4.7 m into bedrock. The monitoring wells were located within the footprint of the 
proposed settling pond area, located southwest of MacLeod Shafts 1 and 2, within 
the general area of the proposed open pit. The borehole logs showed overburden 
thickness to range from 0 - 2.5 m. The upper bedrock was observed to contain sub-
horizontal fractures at a frequency of approximately 1 - 3 fractures/meter. 
Calculations of hydraulic conductivity (K) from falling head tests ranged from 3x10-5 
to 9x10-5 m/s with a geometric mean of 6x10-5 m/s. 
 
Additional hydrogeological investigations will focus on specific issues that may be 
identified as part of the broader environmental assessment (EA), along with targeted 
investigation to support technical feasibility and mine design and additional baseline 
data collection. 
 

 Environmental Geochemistry 

A preliminary assessment of Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) and Metal Leaching (ML) 
from waste rock and ore samples, collected during the advanced exploration stage 
was carried out with the goal of developing a reasonable estimate of volumes of 
these materials that need to be addressed related to ARD/ML. The approach for the 
preliminary ARD and ML investigation is generally consistent with the methodology 
set out in the MEND ("Mine Effluent Neutral Drainage") Prediction Manual for 
characterizing Drainage Chemistry from the local Sulfidic Geological Materials (Price 
2009).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  341	

Approximately 240 samples representing waste rock, ore and overburden were 
collected from the drill core based on the current understanding of the site lithology 
and the estimated production volumes. The samples were analyzed for acid-base 
accounting, total metals and Shake Flask Extraction (SFE) which are on-going. 
Tailings residues will be collected after metallurgical studies have been conducted 
for further characterization and water quality testing. 
 

20.1.8.1 Estimates of Total Rock Mass with Elevated ARD/ML Potential 

SFE samples exceeding the threshold for arsenic (0.5 mg/L) are generally classified 
as Potentially Acid Generating (PAG) or Uncertain with respect to ARD potential. 
Therefore, total masses resulting from ARD and arsenic leaching estimates should 
not be added to avoid double-counting. Instead, it was assumed that the maximum 
mass estimated for specific lithology among all criteria (Neutralizing Potential Ratio 
(NPR) and arsenic) will be a conservative estimate of rock with elevated ARD and/or 
arsenic leaching potential. The conservative estimate is 5.5 Mt for waste rock (1.4 %) 
and 16.6 Mt (19 %) of ore, which may require special management.

 Environmental Management and Mitigation 

20.1.9.1 Water Handling and Treatment 

Non-Contact Water Management 

General site runoff and runoff for the NAG pad will only require treatment for TSS, 
and therefore will be separated from the other mine site flows. This non-contact 
storm water will be collected in rock lined drainage channels and sent through 
sedimentation ponds before being released to the environment. The sedimentation 
ponds will be required to be cleaned out on a regular basis, and sediment will be 
disposed of in the tailings management facility (TMF). 
 
Mine Water Management and Treatment 

Water treatment is anticipated for mine water, ore pad runoff, PAG pad runoff, and 
from the TMF discharge. As cyanide in tailings will be destroyed in the mill using the 
Air/SO2 treatment method, the parameters of concern will likely be arsenic, metals 
(likely copper from the Air/SO2 treatment), ammonia, and TSS. It has been assumed 
that water treatment will be carried out using high density sludge (HDS) clarifier / 
thickener system, and a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). As the project 
progresses and the flows and concentrations of effluent parameters are better 
understood, further refinement of the best treatment strategy will be possible.  
 
Domestic / Sanitary Sewage Treatment 

The Ontario Building Code requires wastewater systems with flow rates of greater 
than 10,000 L/d regulated by the Ontario MOE under the Ontario Water Resources 
Act (OWRA) and require an Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA). Based on 
projections of 300 workers at the project camp, and assigning an average unit flow 
rate of 250 L/person-day, the average sanitary wastewater flow rate would be 
approximately 75,000 L/d. At this flow rate, a subsurface disposal system would be 
classified as a Large Subsurface Disposal System (LSSDS). At this time it has been 
assumed that a package treatment plant will be required with a permitted discharge 
consisting of an outfall pipe and diffuser to the selected surface water receiver.  
 

20.1.9.2 Materials Management 

Ore 

Ore will be stored on three (3) ore storage pads located to the east of the processing 
plant. As information relating to acid generation and metal leaching was limited, and 
the preliminary ARD/ML testing indicated that approximately 19% of the ore could be 
ARD/ML, it was assumed for costing purposes, that the ore storage pads will be 
lined with an impermeable membrane, with runoff collected and sent to the water 
treatment plant prior to discharge to the environment. As the project progresses and 
more information on ARD/ML is acquired, the need for lined ore pads and treatment 
of runoff may be eliminated.  
 
Waste Rock 

Waste rock has been classified as falling into one of two categories, inert (NAG), and 
reactive (PAG/ML). Waste rock classified as inert has been assumed to produce 
runoff that will meet anticipated discharge requirements with possible removal of 
TSS only. Waste rock classified as reactive is assumed to produce runoff that will 
possibly require treatment for metals, pH, and arsenic.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  344	

 
The open pit mine plan estimate approximately 388 Mt of NAG waste rock and 
overburden will be generated over the life of mine. NAG waste rock and overburden 
will be stored to the south of the pit on cleared ground that generally slopes toward 
Kenogamisis Lake. Material is assumed to be placed at a maximum height of 60 m 
at a 1.5:1 slope with a 10 m bench every 10 m. The maximum height of 60 m was 
estimated to be a reasonable height that would be publically acceptable, given the 
close proximity to the highway and nearby residents. An evaluation of the NAG pad 
footprint vs. pile height should be undertake to determine the most efficient pad 
geometry while taking into consideration the public perception and aesthetics of how 
the pile fits in with the surrounding topography. Runoff from the waste rock pile will 
be collected in sedimentation pond(s) for removal of TSS prior to being released to 
the environment. 
 
An estimated 5.5 Mt of waste rock will require water treatment for parameters other 
than TSS. At this stage in the project it is assumed that this material will be stored on 
a lined pad, with runoff collected and sent to the water treatment plant prior to 
discharge to the environment. As the project proceeds and more information on 
ARD/ML is obtained, a detailed waste rock management plan could include an 
evaluation of a co-disposal option of PAG/ML rock with NAG rock, to determine if the 
net discharge would meet regulatory effluent requirements.  
 
Tailings 

The tailings management facility (TMF) for the Hardrock Project was conceptually 
designed to satisfy the design criteria provided in Table 20.1.3.

A TMF siting study was carried out (Stantec, 2013) which identified several potential 
sites that could provide the storage capacity for the estimated mine life. For the 
purposes of this study, TMF Site 5 was selected as the preferred option to develop 
costing. A detailed site evaluation should be conducted as the project proceeds, and 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  345	

site specific environmental and geotechnical information should be gathered as part 
of this evaluation.  
 
Design and Construction Details 

The TMF will be constructed in stages, with Stage 1 having capacity to store the first 
2 years of tailings production at a milling rate of 10,000 tpd, and the relocated 
MacLeod tailings from stripping activities (estimated by Premier to be 1.32 Mt) 
required for open pit construction. Subsequent raises will be carried out to coincide 
with operations, but will likely be done on a 2 year cycle, and consist of downstream 
raises.  
 
Based on available information on subsurface soils, it is not likely that suitable 
impermeable soils will be available in the area for dam construction and therefore it 
has been assumed that rockfill gravity structures will be required with an upstream 
impermeable membrane and seepage cutoff. Rockfill will be sourced from NAG mine 
waste rock.  
 
All containment structures for the TMF will be designed in accordance with: 
 

 Canadian Dam Association (CDA) Dam Safety Guidelines;  
 Ontario Dam Safety Guidelines (ODSG); and  
 Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act 

(LRIA). 
 
Construction of the TMF will be done largely using the mine fleet, and as such 
costing for much of the construction has been included in the TMF costs. Equipment 
and trucking costs as well as compaction of waste rock along with specialty materials 
for slope protection, an impermeable upstream barrier, and filters have been 
included in the TMF construction costs. 
 
Tributaries run through the proposed TMF and NAG rock sites and as such, 
appropriate mitigation will be required based on regulatory approvals. 
 
Waste Disposal 

Solid waste will be collected in steel bins and recycled and reused to the extent 
practical. Paper and cardboard will be recycled; waste steel will be sold as scrap; 
wood and plastic will be salvaged and recycled where possible. All other solid non-
hazardous/non-toxic clean waste (other than domestic garbage) will be disposed of 
at a new clean waste disposal site to be developed for the Hardrock Mine. A suitable 
site will have to be located and a licence obtained. Recyclable solid materials and 
garbage may be collected by a local contractor for recycling or disposal of the 
garbage.  
 
All waste disposal shall be undertaken in accordance with existing regulations. 
Contractors shall be required to conduct all day-to-day operations in such a manner 
as to avoid creating any unpleasant appearances or any conditions that will be 
detrimental to the surrounding area.  
 
The contractor shall ensure that waste oils, fuels, and hazardous wastes (if any) 
shall be handled in a safe manner. Contractors will be required to transport, store

and handle all such substances as recommended by the suppliers and/or 
manufacturers and in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial or municipal 
regulations. 
 

 Reclamation and Closure 

Site Decommissioning, Preparation and Re-Vegetation 

Premier is committed to using environmental management techniques that will 
minimize the potential environmental impact of the proposed mine, mill and 
processing activities, as well as comply with Provincial and Federal Legislated 
requirements and regulations. A conceptual closure plan for the Hardrock Mine Site 
is described here and incorporates requirements of the Ontario Mining Act R.S.O. 
1990, Chapter M.14 (amended by S.O. 2010, c. 18. 23); Part VII under the Act, O. 
Reg 240/00 as amended, and Schedule 1 and 2, Mine Rehabilitation Code of 
Ontario. 
 
At the end of operations of the Project the main features will include the open pit, mill 
processing facilities, offices, storage areas, TMF, and waste rock storage areas for 
NAG/ PAG. Reclamation measures expected for each of the main features are 
described below. The goal at closure is to return the land as close to its natural state 
as practical. Progressive reclamation activities will be carried out where possible 
throughout the mine life; however, the majority of decommissioning and reclamation 
work will take place once mining has been completed.  
 
After closure, reclamation measures will leave the site in a stable condition and 
potential negative impacts mitigated. 
 
Once the proposed mine project is to be permanently closed, all on-site structures 
and facilities will be decommissioned, with all salvageable parts sold or recycled, and 
the remainder disposed of in an appropriate manner. Non-salvageable demolition 
materials and waste may be disposed of in the open pit if permitted by regulatory 
agencies.  
 
The main elements of the reclamation plan and costs are comprised of: 
 

 Permanent deactivation of mine access roads not needed for post-mining 
land access with contouring to restore natural drainages and roadways 
revegetated; 

 Recontouring disturbed areas to blend in with surrounding topography and to 
re-establish natural drainage patterns; 

 Deactivation of water management features that are no longer required such 
as water treatment systems, polishing ponds and ditches. This will include: 
recontouring/spreading of pond berms; backfilling of ponds; backfilling of 
ditches; and re-establishing natural drainage patterns; 

 Mine waste rock surface areas will be amended with a soil cover as needed 
for vegetation and stable drainage conditions established; 

 PAG mine waste rock disposal areas will be capped with a liner to protect 
water quality for the long term and vegetated; 

 The open pit will be allowed to fill with water and the overflow directed to 
established drainages. Allowance is made for public safety measures around 
the pit include resloping, fencing or rock berms; 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  347	

 Natural site run-off and storm flows will be expected to meet downstream 
water quality requirements from all developed areas, including from the plant 
site, mine rock disposal areas, tailings area and pit lake; and,  

 Tailings area drainage is established to provide long term erosion control, 
and vegetated. 

 Once the disturbance sites have undergone preparation they will be re-
vegetated with plant species that are suitable for reclamation and the end 
land uses of the area. The goals of reclamation vegetation will be to: 

 Prevent erosion and sedimentation to protect aquatic resources and prevent 
invasive plant establishment; and, 

 Re-establish a productive land use that is of value for wildlife,, and mitigates 
the residual effects of mining on ecosystems. 

 
PEA Level Closure and Reclamation Costs 

Conceptual closure and reclamation cost estimates include: 
 

 Decommissioning, salvage, and demolition of mine, mill and tailings 
infrastructure, and facilities. Contractor mobilization and demobilization; 

 Site preparation and re-vegetation including resloping, ripping, and soil 
replacement of disturbed areas, tailings management facility and Waste rock; 
and, 

 Post closure monitoring programs. 
 
A summary of reclamation costs are provided in Table 20.1.4. The total reclamation 
cost at mine closure for permanent reclamation is estimated at $26,086,048. All 
costs are presented in 2013 dollars, do not include contingency, and have not been 
adjusted for inflation.

20.1.12.3 Provincial Environmental Assessment(s) 

In Ontario, mining development projects are carried out by private sector proponents 
and are not subject to Provincial EA requirements, although certain ancillary 
activities such as constructing road access, transmission lines, generation facilities 
or modifications to Provincial highways associated with a mining development may 
be subject to the Provincial EA requirements through one or more prescribed Class 
EA processes. Premier Gold Mines has taken the approach to volunteer to 
undertake a provincial Individual EA, which will assess the project in its entirety. 
 

20.1.12.4 Provincial Permits / Approvals 

The possible Provincial permits and approvals required for development at the 
Project site are listed in Table 20.1.6. Provincial regulators responsible for key 
permits/approvals will not approve the permit/approval until after any applicable 
Provincial EAs are complete and approved.

 BROOKBANK 

 Introduction 

As discussed previously, there is minimal exploration infrastructure currently at the 
Brookbank site and there have been no previous mining activities. Ore from the 
Brookbank Mine site would be transported via an existing road approximately 27 
kilometres to a new milling facility (the Beardmore Mill) located at the site of the 
former Northern Empire Mill in Beardmore). All background documents reviewed 
refer to the existing Northern Empire Mill, however, when referring the new proposed 
mill (base case), the term Beardmore Mill is used.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  351	

For the environmental, permitting, social and community impacts related to the base 
case project, both the Brookbank Mine site and the mill site in Beardmore were 
considered. If Option B is pursued, only the Brookbank mine site would be 
considered for environmental, permitting and social/community impacts. All 
environmental permits and costs associated with the original proposed mill facility to 
process ore from the Brookbank deposit at the Beardmore site have been removed 
for the financial evaluation of Option B, while retaining the milling facilities to process 
ore from the Hardrock project. The remainder of this section refers to the base case 
project.  
 
Costs associated with the Beardmore site have been removed for the financial 
evaluation of Option B. The remainder of this section refers to the base case project.  
 
The original mill was built in the 1930s but was inactive from the 1940s until it was 
reopened in the 1980s and a new 200 tonne per day mill and engineered tailings 
disposal system were constructed. The mill was operated intermittently as a custom 
mill until operations were shut down in 1990. The mill was built for the purpose of 
custom milling old waste piles from the Leitch and Northern Empire mines. As 
required by the Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA), monitoring of physical 
and chemical stability is required during the active phase, temporary suspension, 
inactivity, and close-out. 
 
Annual monitoring of effluent from the polishing pond, surface water, groundwater 
and biological monitoring (less frequent) is required in accordance with the existing 
sewage works ECA #2965-85BL3V issued by the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) 
July 20, 2010. This current ECA is an amendment of the former Industrial Sewage 
Works ECA #6593-6SAHWD.

 Current Conditions 

The following section of this report provides a summary of existing data available for 
the Brookbank and Northern Empire Mill sites in Beardmore, Ontario. The mill is not 
owned by the Limited Partnership. This section includes the following information 
and discusses both sites separately.  
 

 Climate; 
 Terrestrial environment; 
 Noise and air quality; 
 Aquatic environment; 
 Hydrology; 
 Water quality; 
 Hydrogeology; and 
 Environmental geochemistry. 

 
In many cases, where information was not available, assumptions were made and 
discussed. 
 

20.2.2.1 Climate 

Climatic conditions were summarized previously in Section 5.2 and are not 
considered a critical issue with respect to development of the project.  
 
The Geraldton Airport weather data is identified to be appropriate in characterizing 
the site conditions as it is the closest permanent climate data station to the proposed 
development; collecting comparable data available over many years; independently 
reviewed for quality of data; and expected to be available going forward. Data is also 
available from Thunder Bay weather stations, which are marginally further from the 
proposed development, but could also be a source of similar information should 
there be any data gaps from the primary source.  
 
Site specific climate data is currently being obtained at a location approximately 60 
kilometres away from the Brookbank site. Obtaining site specific climate data allows 
verification of exactly how representative the Geraldton Airport weather data is of the 
project site. It is reasonable to expect that the single verification of site weather data 
will demonstrate the necessary validity of weather data available from the permanent 
Geraldton Airport weather data station, and it will not therefore be mandatory to 
gather site weather data for the proposed Brookbank development to support any 
potential air and noise environmental concerns at this time.  
 

20.2.2.2 Terrestrial Environment 

Vegetation and Habitat Condition 
 
The Brookbank Property and Northern Empire Mill study areas occur within the 
Boreal Forest Region of Ontario. Woodlands found within this region are typically 
dominated by white spruce, tamarack, jack pine, balsam fir, eastern white cedar, 
trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and white birch (MNR, 2011).  
 
In May 2013, a terrestrial and aquatic environmental baseline study was completed 
in the vicinity of the Brookbank site (NBS, 2013). In addition to this study, Stantec 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  354	

conducted a preliminary review of aerial photography of the project area, as well as 
adjacent lands. Natural cover is dominated by forest cover, including treed wetland 
features, with other wetland types common throughout the area. 
 
Stantec also completed a review of available databases and atlases to document 
provincially rare species and species at risk (SAR), designated natural areas, and 
known areas of significant wildlife habitat. This review included the following key 
information sources: 
 

 Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Natural Heritage Information 
Centre Database (NHIC; MNR 2013a). 

 MNR Land Information Ontario Database (LIO; MNR, 2013b). 
 Various wildlife atlases (Atlas of the Mammals of Ontario, Dobbyn, 1994; the 

Ontario Herpetofaunal Summary, Oldham and Weller, 2000; and the Ontario 
Breeding Bird Atlas, Cadman et al., 2007). 

 
Provincially significant wetlands (PSWs), or areas of natural and scientific interest 
(ANSIs), were not identified for the Brookbank or Northern Empire Mill areas. The 
background review identified known significant wildlife habitat features, including 
moose aquatic feeding and wintering areas within the study area and adjacent lands. 
Other significant wildlife habitat factors (i.e. staging or wintering bird areas, colonies, 
caribou calving/nursery area, etc.) were not identified (LIO, 2013; Ontario Woodland 
Caribou Recovery Team, 2008).  
 
Baseline monitoring will be required to determine the presence of the wildlife habitat 
features, and other potential features identified in the Significant Wildlife Habitat 
Technical Guide (SWHTG; MNR, 2000) such as bat hibernacula, colonial bird 
nesting sites, rare vegetation communities, specialized habitat for breeding birds, or 
amphibian habitat. 
 
It is worth noting that the Project is located within the identified recovery zone for 
Woodland Caribou (Ontario Woodland Caribou Recovery Team 2008; MNR, 2012a). 
Although there are no known caribou calving or nursery areas within the Brookbank 
study site or adjacent lands (MNR, 2013), mine operations should proceed with the 
objectives of the recovery strategy in mind. Baseline monitoring should include 
documentation of existing site conditions and potential habitat conditions for 
Woodland Caribou, to identify any constraints and or mitigation requirements of the 
Project. 
 
Wildlife 

The review of available databases and atlases identified records of provincially and 
nationally rare species and SAR as listed in Table 20.2.1. Consultation with the MNR 
will be required to confirm the information compiled is current and accurate, and to 
request additional natural heritage data if needed. Baseline monitoring may also 
result in the identification of additional species.

Provincially, species are ranked by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk 
in Ontario (COSSARO). Once species are classified "at risk", they are added to the 
Species at Risk in Ontario (SARO) list and protected under the Endangered Species 
Act, 2007 (ESA). Endangered, threatened, and extirpated species listed on the 
SARO list automatically receive legal protection from harm or harassment under the 
ESA. In addition to species protection, the ESA prohibits damage or destruction of 
habitat for endangered or threatened species. A permit from the MNR will be 
required to disturb habitat of any ESA protected species (potential species at the 
Brookbank and Beardmore sites include Eastern Whip-poor-will and Barn Swallow). 
 
The permit application process will require comprehensive mitigation to compensate 
for any loss of protected habitat, and restricted timing windows for vegetation 
clearing and removal of habitat. For species not protected under the ESA, mitigation 
measures will be simply be implemented during construction. 
 
Consultation with the MNR and other relevant agencies will be required to determine 
field requirements for SAR. Any SAR identified within close proximity of the project 
location during the course of site investigations should be addressed under the 
Ontario Endangered Species Act (2007) or the Species at Risk Act as applicable. 
 
Another key legislative consideration includes restrictions imposed by the federal 
Migratory Bird Convention Act, 1994 (MBCA). The MBCA prohibits the killing or 
capturing of migratory birds, as well as any damage, destruction, removal, or 
disturbance of active nests. For this region of the boreal forest, the core nesting 
period occurs between May 16 and August 8 (Canadian Wildlife Service, 2012). If 
sensitive species are found to occur in the project area, the timing window may be 
adjusted for that particular species. To avoid contravention of the MBCA, activities 
such as vegetation clearing are not conducted during the nesting period.

20.2.2.3 Noise and Air Quality 

Noise 

As the Brookbank site is located in a relatively remote environment, it is anticipated 
that baseline sound levels would be well below the MOE night-time limits for rural 
areas (40 dbA). 
 
An increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the Brookbank site would be expected 
both during construction and operation due to sources such as diesel generators and 
heavy-duty vehicles and equipment. However, due to the isolated nature of the site 
from populated areas, it is expected that the noise associated with the mining 
operations would not have significant adverse effects on the human population in the 
area. 
 
The Northern Empire Mill site is located close to the Trans-Canada Highway 
(Highway 11) but is still relatively remote. The town of Beardmore is situated along 
Highway 11, adjacent to the Blackwater River. It is anticipated that baseline sound 
levels could be below the MOE night time limits for rural areas (40 dbA) when the 
mill is not in operation, as transportation traffic noise impact is assessed on a 
different timescale from stationary sources. Existing anthropogenic noise sources in 
the area include the road traffic and recreational activities.  
 
An impact on sound levels in the vicinity of the Northern Empire Mill site would be 
expected during ongoing operations due to sources such as the process equipment 
in operation (crushers, conveyors, screens, ball mills, etc.). It is anticipated that 
much of the process equipment will be located inside a weather structure that will 
also provide some noise transmission attenuation. As identified during a desktop 
study, there are approximately 50 residences just northeast of the Northern Empire 
Mill site, in the town of Beardmore. It is expected that the noise associated with the 
milling operations would not have significant adverse effects on any human 
population of the area. However, the potential for nuisance due to sounds from the 
mill site will be an important factor to consider during detailed monitoring studies. 
 
Noise mitigation measures may be required to ensure both projects meet guidelines 
and to minimize the disturbance to flora and fauna in the vicinity of the proposed 
mine and mill sites. This will be further determined during the baseline monitoring 
and permitting process.  
 
Air 

The Brookbank Property is located in a relatively remote environment and there are 
not any dwellings within the direct vicinity of the site. Unlike the Brookbank Property, 
the Northern Empire Mill is located within proximity to dwellings, situated in the town 
of Beardmore. Other than the existing mill, the town of Beardmore, and Highway 11, 
the surrounding landscape is predominantly in a natural state and dominated by 
boreal forest.  
Heavy industry is not present in the direct vicinity of either site and background 
concentrations of air contaminants are expected to be minimal.  
 
Site specific background air quality data is not available for either site. The nearest 
provincial ambient air quality station is located in Thunder Bay. Air emissions are 
anticipated for both the proposed mine and mill sites. It is anticipated that the primary 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  357	

air-related issue of concern from the Brookbank mining operations will be fugitive 
dust from roads, material extraction, stockpiles, and loading/unloading operations. 
The potential for nuisance due to fugitive dust (especially from roadways) will be an 
important factor to consider during both construction and operations. Air dispersion 
modeling, including dust control, will need to be considered; however, it is not 
anticipated that the Brookbank site will impact any residential properties as no 
receptors have been identified within proximity to the site based on desktop review.  
 
It is anticipated that the primary air-related issues of concern for the milling 
operations will be fugitive dust from roads, outdoor storage of unprocessed materials 
and tailings, and process emissions from the sorting, crushing, screening, and ball 
mill operations. Upon a desktop review of the location, there are approximately 50 
residents within the vicinity of the Northern Empire Mill site. The potential for 
nuisance due to fugitive dust (especially from roadways and uncontrolled source 
operations) will be an important factor to consider during ongoing operations. Air 
dispersion modeling including dust control will need to be considered and source 
permits obtained for the processing operations.  
 

20.2.2.4 Aquatic Environment 

The following section describes the fish habitat and community in the vicinity of both 
the Brookbank Property and Northern Empire Mill sites. 
 
Brookbank Property 

The Brookbank area is located within the greater Lake Superior watershed. Knox 
Lake drains into Foxear Creek, which flows west to join the Namewaminikan River 
approximately 6 kilometres to the west of the study area, which then flows 
approximately 15 kilometres southwest into Lake Nipigon (Fig. 20.2). 
 
The Brookbank site is located in the Foxear Creek subwatershed, which drains into 
the Namewaminikan River, which flows southwest for approximately 15 kilometres 
into Lake Nipigon. Lake Sturgeon and Brook Trout are known to run up the lower 
Namewaminikan River from Lake Nipigon, but are not angled above High Falls 
(Northern Bioscience, 2009), which is located approximately18 kilometres 
downstream of the Brookbank site. Extensive fisheries data on the fish community 
and fish habitat in the Namewaminikan River has been collected as part of an 
Environmental Screening Study for the Namewaminikan River Waterpower Project 
(NBS Group, 2011). There are two hydroelectric facilities located on the 
Namewaminikan River. One is 2.7 kilometres upstream of the confluence of Foxear 
Creek at Twin Falls, and the second is approximately 5.7 kilometres downstream at 
Long Rapids.  
 
Near the confluence of Foxear Creek and the Namewaminikan River, Walleye and 
Northern Pike are the dominant game species. Lake Whitefish have also been 
documented farther downstream, in the basin upstream of Twin Falls. Fish 
community data for rivers and streams in closer proximity to the Brookbank and 
Northern Empire Mill sites are limited. However, Cyprinids and young of the year 
Pike have been observed in many Namewaminikan River tributaries in this area, and 
Burbot and Johnny Darter were documented in Foxear Creek (Northern Bioscience, 
2009).

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  358	

Information on small bodied fish in local lakes is very limited; however some 
information on sport fish is available for local lakes. Potter and Knox Lakes are 
located near the Brookbank site, on a tributary to Foxear Creek. This tributary drains 
through the Brookbank site. Northern Pike have been documented in Knox Lake, but 
other fish species have not been documented in close proximity to the Brookbank 
site. The upper reaches of the Foxear Creek watershed are located approximately 
14 kilometres west of the Brookbank site, near Foxear Lake. Foxear Creek flows 
through a number of lakes upstream of the Brookbank site including: Foxear Lake, 
Ida Lake, Bush Lake, Pasha Lake, Clearall Lake, Bearskin Lake, and Windigokan 
Lake. Tallon Creek is the largest tributary to Foxear Creek, and flows into a bay of 
Windigokan Lake, upstream of the Brookbank site. Tallon Creek also flows through a 
number of small lakes, including Hallow Lake, Nora Lake, Tallon Lake, Still Lake, 
Spawn Lake and Dead Lake (Fig. 20.2). Most of these lakes have Northern Pike, 
Yellow Perch and Walleye populations. Lake Whitefish are documented in 
Windigokan Lake, Pasha Lake, Ida Lake, and Bush Lake. Brook Trout are 
documented in Hallow Lake and Nora Lake, which are in the upper reaches of the 
Tallon Creek watershed.  
 
Based on information from the MNR and some preliminary baseline monitoring just 
upstream of the site, there are currently no known aquatic species at risk within the 
vicinity of the proposed Brookbank site. 
 
Northern Empire Mill 

The existing Northern Empire Mill is located on the south side of the Blackwater 
River, just northeast of Beardmore.  
 
Final effluent flows south via pipeline for approximately 1 kilometre to the final 
discharge point (FDP). From there, the effluent flows overland in a west-southwest 
direction and drains directly into Blackwater River south of the town of Beardmore at 
a location referred to as the effluent discharge location (EDL). The surrounding 
watershed and discharge locations are shown in Figure 20.2 (DST, 2012b).  
 
Drainage from the majority of the site would flow into an intermittent stream, Garnet 
Creek (also known previously as Church Creek) and enter Blackwater River 
upstream of Beardmore. This tributary flows into the Blackwater River on the north 
side of Garnet Drive in Beardmore. Due to the small drainage area and limited 
discharge, this tributary does not likely provide suitable habitat for Walleye and 
Northern Pike. Additional information on flow regime, thermal regime, and fish 
community will be required to assess potential habitat use by Brook Trout in this 
unnamed tributary. The valley of this first order tributary is being considered as a 
potential location for a new TMF and discharge (refer to Section 20.3.3.3). 
 
The Blackwater River is a cold water fishery and supports populations of a variety of 
game fish including Walleye, Brook Trout, Whitefish, Northern Pike, and Lake 
Sturgeon. The Lake Sturgeon population in this area is a part of the Great 
Lakes/Upper St. Lawrence River Population and is currently listed as threatened 
under Ontario's Endangered Species Act. Critical habitat for Lake Sturgeon does not 
appear to be present in the project area, but may be present downstream between 
Beardmore and Lake Nipigon.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  359	

Recent fisheries investigations were conducted specifically in Blackwater River near 
the mill and Garnet Creek in September 2010 (DST, 2012b). A variety of fishing 
methods were used, however, only ten species were captured including several 
forage fish, Burbot, Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and White Suckers.  
 
Based on information from the MNR and some preliminary monitoring, there are 
currently no known aquatic species at risk within the vicinity of the Northern Empire 
Mill, however, more rigorous baseline monitoring will be required.

20.2.2.5 Environmental Geochemistry 

Acid Rock Drainage 

The acid rock drainage assessment is based on historical results of Acid Base 
Accounting (ABA) Testing summarized in the Closure Plan Amendment for the 
Northern Empire Mine and Mill Property (DST 2012a). Historical testing includes 
tailings, waste rock, and ore obtained from different sites around the Beardmore area 
(Table 20.2.2). All samples have neutral to slightly alkaline paste pH and 
Neutralization Potential Ratios above pH  
 
These results indicate that acidic drainage likely will not be associated with ore, 
waste rock, and tailings generated at the Brookbank site, based on the current 
classification of geologic materials used in Canada (Price 2009). However, additional 
testing will be required to satisfy regulatory requirements on a number of samples 
analyzed for ABA.

Leaching of Trace Elements and Nitrogen from Exposed Geological Materials 

Due to a lack of available geochemical information on waste rock, ore, or tailings 
contact water for the Brookbank Property, the approach employed to predict final 
effluent concentrations at the New Beardmore Mill required several assumptions and 
the use of representative or surrogate data from nearby sites. Although there is an 
existing mill, the mill has not been in operation since 1990, therefore the discharge is 
not comparable to active tailings impoundment. An active tailings impoundment 
would receive freshly ground sulfide minerals prone to rapid oxidation and result in 
solutions having elevated concentrations of metals and cyanide from the mill/plant. 
 
Brookbank Property 

At the time this report was completed, monitoring of outflow from the Hardrock Mine 
(in 2012) was considered to be the best dataset mimicking water contacting with ore 
and waste rock. The maximum parameters, including total metal concentrations, 
were selected to represent runoff from both waste rock and ore stockpiles, except for 
TSS and nitrogen species. Concentrations of TSS entering the sedimentation ponds 
in runoff from the stockpiles were arbitrarily assumed to be 300 mg/L. It should be 
noted that concentrations of arsenic at the Brookbank site are considered to be lower 
because the Brookbank resource contains at least ten times less arsenopyrite 
compared to that of the Hardrock Mine. Nevertheless, arsenic concentrations in the 
outflow from the Hardrock Mine were used, representing a conservative assumption.  
 
Mine-water chemistry at the proposed Brookbank site is discussed in the 
Hydrogeology Section (20.2.7), but estimates of concentrations of nitrogen species 
leached from blasting residues with mine water are presented in this section. The 
concentrations of nitrogen species were calculated using Leask and Ferguson 
(1988) approach and based on preliminary mine production schedules and use of 
emulsion for blasting. All lost nitrogen will be leached into the mine water inflows as 
noted in Section 20.2.7.  
 
The results of calculations show that total concentrations of nitrogen species can be 
up to 1 mg/L (as nitrogen) and are expected to be high in the early stages of mining.  
 
Northern Empire Mill 

The polishing pond water quality at the Northern Empire Mill TMF will generally be 
controlled by run-off from beach (exposed) tailings and by the chemistry of discharge 
from the mill.  
 
Run-off from the proposed Beardmore Mill TMF can be predicted, assuming that 
mineralogy of the tailings from deposits of the Beardmore-Geraldton area is relatively 
similar. Caution was exercised using the existing data for the Northern Empire Mill as 
no tailings have been deposited into the TMF since the 1990's, and there has been a 
significant amount of time for dilution due to precipitation and runoff, as well as 
natural degradation. Therefore, the existing data for the site was not considered 
adequately representative and a worst case scenario was developed instead, 
adopting a more conservative approach. The maximum parameters, including total 
metal concentrations, were compiled from the following datasets: 
 

 Monitoring of untreated runoff from rehabilitated McLeod tailings in 2012; and

 Treated effluent from an inactive Northern Empire Mill based on 2011 and 
2012 monitoring.  

 
The chemistry of discharge from the future mill is difficult to predict prior to 
metallurgical testing. Based on the mill design, BBA estimated that the pH of the 
discharge will be ~8.5 and the total cyanide concentration will be <1.0 mg/L. The 
WAD cyanide was assumed to consist of 50% of the total cyanide concentration. 
Other parameters in the discharge are currently assumed to be the same as in the 
runoff from the beach tailings, except for Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The 
concentration of TSS in the tailings pond near the discharge pipe from the mill was 
arbitrarily assumed to be 300 mg/L, based on previous experiences from similar 
sites.

20.2.2.6 Hydrology 

Brookbank Site 

The proposed Brookbank Mine site is located about 6 kilometres east from the 
Namewaminikan River between McCambly Lake, Windigokan Lake, and Knox Lake 
(Fig. 20.2.4). The Namewaminikan River ultimately flows to Lake Nipigon. There are 
no existing HYDAT gauges on the Namewaminikan River. The historic gauge 
(02AD011) at Long Rapids was discontinued in 1987. The closest HYDAT gauge is 
located on the Blackwater River (02AD010) and it has continuous flow and water 
level records from 1971 to present. It is reasonable to assume that the hydrology of 
the Namewaminikan River and its tributaries is similar to the Blackwater River. 
Significant spikes in flows are expected to be observed in the river after rainfall 
events.  
 
The monthly environmental water balance for normal, dry, and wet years for the 
study area are presented in Table 20.2.4. The water balance was calculated based 
on historical Environment Canada climate data for the Geraldton Airport. 
 
The proposed Brookbank mine site is located on Foxear Creek which is a tributary of 
the Namewaminikan River. The watershed area of Foxear Creek upstream of the 
Brookbank Mine site is about 43 km2 which is reasonably sufficient for assimilation 
and mixing of low effluent volumes. Based on regional extrapolation from the 
Blackwater River HYDAT station the 7Q20 at the proposed effluent discharge point 
on Foxear Creek would be 0.03 m3/s. 
 
Currently, there is no water quality data available near the proposed Brookbank Mine 
site. Therefore, it was assumed that background water quality is similar to the 
Blackwater River upstream of the town of Beardmore. The 75th percentile water 
quality concentrations for Foxear Creek for all parameters are accordingly assumed 
to be below Provincial Water Quality Objectives (PWQO). Water quality will be 
investigated as part of baseline monitoring. 
 
All facilities associated with the proposed mine will be located within the Foxear 
Creek watershed and the effluent discharge point would be located in the 
approximate area indicated in Figure 20.2.4 and Figure 20.2.5.

Northern Empire Mill 

The preferred TMF for the purposes of this assessment is located about 2 kilometres 
east of Beardmore in the upper reaches of the Garnet Creek valley. Garnet Creek is 
a tributary to the Blackwater River (Fig. 20.2.2). The HYDAT gauge (02AD010) on 
the Blackwater River records continuous flows and levels from 1971 to present. The 
Blackwater River and its small tributaries show expected seasonal fluctuations with 
significant spikes in flows observed in streams after rainfall events. 
 
Final effluent from the existing polishing pond flows south via an outfall pipeline for 1 
kilometre to the final discharge point (FDP) and from there the effluent drains 
overland in a west-southwest direction and discharges into Blackwater River south of 
the town of Beardmore as shown inFigure 20.2. Drainage from the site flows into 
Garnet Creek, which enters Blackwater River upstream of Beardmore. 
 
The existing receiving water quality does not represent a constraint, as the 
background water quality in the Blackwater River (represented as a 75th percentile) 
is below PWQO for all parameters (Appendix U).  
 

20.2.2.7 Brookbank Property Water Quality 

This section reviews water quality at the proposed Brookbank Mine operations. This 
review is based on the following premises: 
 

 There will not be any milling at the proposed Brookbank Mine site; 
 Tailings will not be generated or managed at the Brookbank site; 
 There will not be any paste backfill preparation at the Brookbank site; 
 There will be waste rock stockpiles at the Brookbank site, with associated 

management of the drainage water; 
 There will be a small pad at the Brookbank site for temporary storage of ore 

which will be trucked to the Northern Empire Mill; 
 Water from dewatering of the proposed Brookbank Mine and from drainage 

of the waste rock piles and temporary ore storage pad will be collected and 
treated as necessary in a treatment plant located at the Brookbank site; and, 

 Final treated water will be discharged to Foxear Creek. 
 
Background 

The following discusses receiving water quality associated with the proposed 
Brookbank Mine site; however, data are not available therefore the assumption is 
made that Foxear Creek water quality is similar to background water quality in the 
Blackwater River reference location (Stn. BWR1). This section also reviews effluent 
quality criteria and water quality objectives compared to effluent quality and dilution. 
 
The closest known background water quality monitoring station with available data is 
located on the Blackwater River upstream of Beardmore and any site discharges 
(Stations BWR1), which is shown in Figure 20.2 (DST, 2012b). This background 
monitoring location is required as part of the Northern Empire Mill's ECA #2965-
85BL3V. Water quality results from the background monitoring station are 
summarized and compared to the Ministry of Environment (MOE) Provincial Water 
Quality Objectives (PWQOs). The average concentrations for all parameters were 
consistently below PWQOs.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  372	

MOE requires the use of the 75th percentile concentration of receiving waters for the 
mixing-dilution analysis of effluent. The 75th percentile represents the background 
water quality of a natural stream. The 75th percentile was calculated based on ten 
measurements from station BWR1. All 75th percentile concentrations in the 
Blackwater River are below PWQO (Appendix U). It is therefore assumed that 
background water quality in Foxear Creek is also below PWQOs. It will be important 
to collect some site specific water quality data as part of the baseline monitoring 
program. 
 
Raw Effluent Quality 

Based on raw effluent quality from other mines in the area and a review of available 
geochemistry (discussed below in Section 20.2.9), the potentially regulated 
parameters, and their expected concentrations in untreated effluent are presented 
inTable 20.2.5. 
 
Effluent Criteria 

Proposed effluent criteria for the Brookbank site were estimated based on the 
following, including: 
 

 Estimated regulated parameters in untreated mine water; 
 Estimated effluent flowrate; 
 O.Reg 560/94 (MISA) limits; 
 Existing and new proposed MMER limits; 
 7Q20 of the receiving surface water; 
 PWQO, and 
 Comparison with the existing ECA for the Northern Empire Mill, the MacLeod 

Mosher Dewatering Project Closure Plan, 2011 (close in proximity) and 
similar projects. 

 
The effluent flowrate was estimated as a 90th percentile of monthly flow, which was 
0.01 m3/s. The 7Q20 for Foxear Creek at the effluent discharge location is 0.03 m3/s, 
which provides a dilution ratio of about 3:1.  
 
Table 20.2.5 shows a summary of estimated untreated effluent quality and various 
relevant regulatory guidelines. All regulated parameters can be divided into two 
groups, those that likely require treatment and those that do not likely require 
treatment, as their concentrations in untreated effluent are below PWQO (Table 
20.2.8). 
 

 Treatment is likely not required for aluminum, cadmium, molybdenum, 
copper, nickel, zinc, cyanide, and pH.  

 Treatment is likely required for arsenic, iron, total ammonia, and TSS. 
 
A sedimentation pond is likely sufficient for removal of iron and TSS. However, 
arsenic and total ammonia may require additional treatment.

20.2.2.8 Northern Empire Mill Water Quality 

The following reviews existing receiving water quality data associated with the 
Northern Empire Mill and its associated tailing management facility (TMF). This 
section also reviews tailings effluent water quality and presents potential effluent 
quality criteria based on historical tailings effluent quality in relation the receiving 
water quality. This review is based on the premise that the proposed Beardmore Mill 
would have the following features: 
 

 The proposed Beardmore Mill TMF would be located in the Garnet Brook 
valley, which is located just south of the unnamed tributary that hosts the 
existing Northern Empire Mill and its TMF; 

 The Beardmore Mill would include cyanide recovery and removal treatment 
within the mill itself prior to tailings being sent to the TMF; 

 All significant drainage from the Beardmore Mill would be routed through the 
proposed TMF and associated polishing pond. 

 Treatment will be provided as appropriate for the TMF decant water, with the 
treatment system located adjacent to the polishing pond just downstream of 
the TMF. 

 The treated water from the Beardmore Mill TMF and polishing pond would be 
conveyed down the Garnet Brook valley by pipe to discharge into the 
Blackwater River at a point downstream of the community of Beardmore 
(Option 4A).

Background Water Quality 

As mentioned previously, Premier Gold is conducting water quality monitoring as per 
the conditions stipulated in the amended Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA) 
for Industrial Sewage #2965-85BL3V. The data for water quality stations BWR1, 
BWR2 and BWR3 (Fig. 20.6, DST, 2012b) were used in this section as these 
stations are considered representative of current conditions. Results from the 
background monitoring stations were summarized and compared to the Ministry of 
Environment (MOE) Provincial Water Quality Objectives (PWQOs).  
 
At the station farthest downstream (Stn BWR3), which is downstream of Beardmore 
and existing site drainage coming from Garnet Creek (DST, 2012b), the average 
concentrations for all parameters were consistently below PWQO. It should be 
noted, however, that a number of individual PWQO exceedances were recorded for 
copper (August 2012), phosphorus (May 2012), zinc (April 2011) and aluminum 
(April 2012 and May 2012).  
 
The 75th percentile was calculated based on 32 measurements from stations BWR1, 
BWR2, and BWR3 during 2012 (Appendix U). All background concentrations 
calculated on this basis are below PWQOs. 
 
Raw Effluent Quality 

Based on raw effluent quality from other mines in the area and a review of available 
tailings geochemistry, the potentially regulated parameters and their expected 
concentrations in untreated effluent are presented inTable 20.2.6.  
 
 
Effluent Criteria 

Proposed effluent criteria for the Beardmore Mill TMF was estimated based on: 
 

 Estimated regulated parameters in untreated tailings water; 
 Estimated effluent flowrate; 
 O.Reg/ 560/94 (MISA) limits; 
 Existing and new proposed MMER limits; 
 7Q20 of the receiver; 
 PWQO, and 
 Comparison with the existing ECA for the Northern Empire Mill, the MacLeod 

Mosher Dewatering Project Closure Plan, 2011 (close in proximity) and 
similar projects. 

 
The effluent flowrate was estimated as a 90th percentile of monthly flow. The 7Q20 
for the Blackwater River at the effluent discharge location is 0.45 m3/s, which 
provides a dilution ratio of approximately 25:1. 
 
Table 20.2.6 presents a summary of predicted untreated effluent quality data and 
various relevant regulatory guidelines. All regulated parameters were divided into 
two groups: those which likely require treatment and those which likely do not require 
treatment, as their concentrations at the mixing point are below PWQO (Table 
20.2.6).

20.2.2.9 Hydrogeology 

Quarternary Geology 

The Brookbank site lies within an area characterized by flat to gently rolling 
topography. Local relief is the result of glacial deposits which overlie bedrock. In the 
area, glacial deposits range from 0 to 30 metres thick and comprise fine to medium 
textured sand with lesser amounts of interbedded gravel, silt, and clay. The 
quaternary geology is described in Ontario Geological Survey Map 2535, Beardmore 
Geraldton Area, 1991 as comprising ice contact glaciofluvial sands and gravels 
adjacent to thin till described as gravelly silty sand diamicton. A search of Ontario 
Ministry of the Environment (MOE) water well records show the three closest well 
records to be located approximately 10 kilometres east and southeast of the site and 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  376	

indicate overburden thickness in the range of 0 to 8 metres. Where present, the 
overburden comprises brown sand or silt with lesser gravel. 
 
Bedrock Geology 

The Brookbank site is contained within a greenstone belt of archean age that lies 
within the Wabigoon Sub-province and the Superior Structural Province. The 
geology is described by Micon International Limited (2013). Rock assemblages are 
dominated by metavolcanic pillowed basalts and clastic metasediments comprising 
conglomerates, sandstones, greywackes and siltstone oriented east-west with steep 
southward to vertical dips. The rocks are intersected by intermediate and mafic 
intrusives. To the north of the site, felsic to intermediate pyroclastics are fault-
bounded across the Paint Lake Fault with mafic metavolcanics. Structural features 
include the "Brookbank Shear Zone" which comprises an east-west tending zone of 
brittle and ductile deformation and hydrothermal alteration. Gold and silver 
mineralization occurs along with accessory pyrite and minor chalcopyrite. 
The Northern Empire Mill site, which lies approximately 15 kilometres southwest of 
Brookbank, in the town of Beardmore, is dominated by mafic metavolcanic basalts 
with lesser intermediate and mafic tuffs, interbedded with thin iron formation and 
minor clastics and intruded by diorites and gabbro. 
 
Groundwater Conditions 

Groundwater Flow 

In the absence of groundwater data, it is assumed that groundwater flow mimics 
ground topographic gradients, with groundwater flow occurring from areas of higher 
elevation, which are areas of groundwater recharge, toward areas of low elevations 
which are typically areas of groundwater discharge. 
 
The overburden sediments which comprise sands with lesser gravels and silts are 
expected to have high to moderate horizontal permeability [hydraulic conductivity (K) 
in the 10-4 to 10-6 m/s range] and are generally conducive to infiltration and 
groundwater flow. Groundwater flow in the underlying bedrock is expected to be 
considerably slower and will occur in secondary porosity features such as fractures, 
fault zones, and weathering zones. The rate of groundwater flow in bedrock is 
proportional to the aperture or width of the opening between the walls of the 
fracture/fault. Typically, bedrock permeability decreases with increasing depth as 
lithostatic pressure of the overlying rock causes fractures to close. In the absence of 
field data, the hydraulic conductivity in bedrock may be expected to be in the range 
of 10-9 to 10-6 m/s, with higher hydraulic conductivities possible in areas of heavy 
fractures or faults. Locally, structural features such as fault zones and fracturing 
could enhance hydraulic conductivity by several orders of magnitude. 
 
Groundwater Yield and Groundwater as a Source of Water 

Of the three closest water wells to the Brookbank site for which MOE water well 
records exist, two were test wells which were completed to depths of 3 metres in 
overburden and 15.3 metres in bedrock. The shallow well was not used and the 
deeper one was installed as a groundwater monitoring well. The third well was 
completed to a depth of approximately 111 metres in bedrock as a water supply well. 
On completion, static water level in the well was 6.83 metres below the top of the 
casing. The well was pump tested at 0.3 L/s [5 gallons per minute (gpm)] for one 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  377	

hour. The water level after one hour was 15.8 metres below top of casing and was 
still falling at the end of the test, indicating that rate of 0.3 L/s was not sustainable.  
 
Groundwater permits to take water (PTTWs) provide a good indication of the 
potential water yielding capacity of an aquifer. A search of the MOE database for 
PTTWs within a 25 kilometre radius of the Brookbank site failed to identify any active 
or historic permits.  
 
The town of Beardmore is located approximately 18 kilometres southwest of the 
Brookbank site. Nineteen MOE well records, mostly centered in the town, were 
identified, three wells were completed in the overburden and 11 were completed in 
the bedrock. The thickness of the overburden ranged from 0 to 33 metres (but 
generally less than 20 metres, in the north portion of town, and less than 10 metres 
in the south portion of town) and consisted mostly of sands and gravels. The 
estimated well yields in three overburden wells ranged from 0.38 to 3.8 L/s (5-50 
gpm) with a geometric mean of approximately 1.4 L/s (18 gpm). Well yields in 
bedrock were lower and ranged from 0.07 to 1.1 L/s (1-20 gpm) with a geometric 
mean of 0.4 L/s (5.6 gpm).  
 
From the available information, it appears that where it is present and thick, the 
overburden can produce higher yielding wells than the bedrock, although the 
variable thickness of the overburden generates uncertainty as to the reliability of 
overburden groundwater as a source of drinking water or process water for the mine 
site. If a groundwater source of water for the site is selected as an option, then a 
program of test hole drilling and pump testing must be undertaken to assess the 
potential for groundwater to provide an adequate supply. It has been assumed that 
groundwater could provide the minimum water requirements for a site staff of 35 
persons. 
 
Groundwater Quality 

Groundwater quality data is not available for the Brookbank site. The closest 
groundwater chemistry to the Brookbank site is from groundwater monitoring 
programs at the Northern Empire Mine, located approximately 15 kilometres 
southwest of the site. 
 
Northern Empire Mill Site Groundwater Monitoring 

Groundwater monitoring at the Northern Empire Mill site, is conducted three times 
annually in accordance with C of A # 2965-85BL3V. Groundwater monitoring is 
described for 2009 and 2010 by DST Consulting Engineers (2012). Groundwater 
monitoring in 2012 was conducted by EXP Services Inc. (2013). 
 
Groundwater monitoring wells MW1 to MW4 are located downgradient of the 
polishing ponds. MW5 is located upgradient of the polishing ponds and northwest of 
the site, and is part of the groundwater monitoring well network associated with the 
Beardmore landfill site. MW6 was added at a later date. At MW1 to MW4, soil varies 
in thickness from 1.1 to 1.5 metres and comprises alluvial sand and silt with till and 
interbedded peat and organic deposits. At MW5, subsurface conditions consisted of 
a thin layer of organics underlain by sand to a depth of 9.75 metres. The wells do not 
penetrate the bedrock and groundwater quality is indicative of very shallow 
groundwater conditions.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  378	

Groundwater quality objectives have not been established for the site, but tailings 
effluent objectives have been set by the Regulator for TSS, total ammonia, total CN, 
Fe, Mo, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, As and pH. 
 
Groundwater samples were field filtered. Generally for monitoring wells MW1 to 
MW3 in 2009 and 2010, TSS and Fe exceeded tailings effluent objectives. Single 
value exceedances occurred for Cu in MW1 in the fall of 2010 and for As in MW2 in 
the spring of 2009. High TSS is likely due to poorly developed sand pack around the 
well screens and is not representative of groundwater conditions.  
 
In 2012, effluent objectives were exceeded in some wells for TSS, total CN, total Fe, 
and dissolved Fe and results were generally consistent with historical data.  
 
Shallow monitoring wells exceeded Ontario Drinking Water Standards, Objectives 
and Guidelines (ODWSOG) for hardness, iron, and manganese.  
 
Estimated Groundwater Inflow to Brookbank Underground Workings 

Useful hydrogeological information could not be found in the existing database on 
the Brookbank site to help estimate potential groundwater flow or water quality.  
 
Recommended Work 

The lack of hydrogeological data for the Brookbank site will require a work program 
to meet future permitting, design and monitoring requirements. This work should 
include the following: 
 

 Baseline groundwater monitoring to identify pre-development conditions at 
key areas of the proposed Brookbank mine site including: waste rock storage 
areas, sewage disposal area, chemical storage areas; 

 Groundwater exploration program to assess potential for groundwater-
sourced water supply; and 

 Hydrogeological investigation of bedrock and overburden for purposes of 
quantifying groundwater inflow rates to underground workings. 

 
 Environmental Management and Mitigation 

20.2.3.1 Brookbank Water Handling and Treatment 

Domestic Water Servicing 

Based on the current mine operating plan, there will be no dormitory or kitchen 
facilities located at the mine site. The domestic water system will provide water for 
use by the personnel at the mine for eyewash, safety shower, handwashing, toilets, 
and urinals, but not for drinking or cooking. 
 
Process Selection 

It is assumed the water treatment systems are classified as non-regulated water 
treatment systems and that they will provide water of sufficient quality to serve: 
safety showers, eye wash stations, handwash sinks, and toilets. Separate bottled 
water will be provided for drinking. 
 
There are numerous water treatment processes that may be implemented to serve 
the domestic water needs at the Brookbank site. The process adopted includes:

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  379	

deep well and pump, pressure tanks, contact tank for NaOCl addition, greensand 
filter for Mn/Fe removal, 50 micron filter, UV disinfection, building to house the 
process, and a minor piping allowance. The exact supply configuration and treatment 
process will need to be evaluated based on actual well testing data and will be 
confirmed in subsequent phases of engineering study. 
 
Sanitary Wastewater Servicing 

This section provides the basis for design and process selection for the sanitary 
wastewater treatment system to serve the proposed Brookbank Mine site. This is the 
wastewater from the sanitary facilities designed for use by the mine employees and 
visitors, such as handwash sinks, toilets and urinals, and safety showers.  
 
Process Selection 

It is estimated that wastewater flows are <10 m3/d. Therefore, design per the Ontario 
Building Code applies. 
 
There are numerous wastewater treatment systems that may be implemented. The 
process listed herein includes: septic tank, grinder pump, raised bed infiltration using 
a system similar to that offered by Ecoflo®, and minor piping allowance. The exact 
sanitary wastewater treatment and disposal process eventually selected may be 
different, pending subsequent phases of engineering.  
 
Mine Supply Water Treatment 

A source of process water is required for underground mining activities. The average 
water demand for underground process use is estimated at 31 m3/hr. according to 
preliminary water balance estimates made for the Brookbank site (see below). A firm 
pumping capacity of 40 m3/hr (11 L/s) is therefore assumed appropriate to cover 
annual variations in process water demand.  
 
Process water supply options which were considered included withdrawal of water 
from Foxear Creek located just north of the mine site, and supply from groundwater 
wells. Insufficient hydrogeologic information is available to confirm a groundwater 
supply could be developed to meet this demand requirement. It is recommended for 
planning purposes that withdrawal of water from Foxear Creek serve for supply. It 
will be necessary to complete a surface water impact study in support of a PTTW for 
the water taking from Foxear Creek to confirm the availability of water from Foxear 
Creek.  
 
Because the site of the raw water pumping station remains undefined, preliminary 
cost estimates for items such as transmission main, power cable, and road access 
were made for the purpose of this study. 
 
Mine Process Water Discharge Treatment 

The treatment program will include the following major components: 
 

 Chemical feed at the influent to the sedimentation pond; 
 HDS treatment plant downstream of the sedimentation pond (operated at a 

slightly different operating pH than the sedimentation pond); 
 Granular media filtration (for consistent removal of metals to low single-digit 

mg/L concentration);

 Possible treatment system for ammonia removal; 
 Outfall pipeline; and 
 Outfall diffuser. 

 
20.2.3.2 Beardmore Mill 

Domestic Water Servicing 

This section provides the basis for design and process selection for domestic water 
treatment for the proposed Beardmore Mill. This system will provide water for use by 
the personnel working at the mill and visitors, for eyewash, safety shower, 
handwashing sink, toilets and urinals; but not for drinking or cooking consumption. 
This evaluation is based on the premise established for the study that there will not 
be overnight dormitory or kitchen facilities at the proposed mill. Water for drinking will 
be provided by delivery of bottled potable water from commercial sources. Water for 
the milling process is addressed separately. 
 
Domestic Water Supply Treatment 

It is assumed the water treatment systems are classified as non-regulated water 
treatment systems and that they will provide water of sufficient quality to serve: 
safety showers, eye wash stations, handwash sinks, and toilets. Separate bottled 
water will be provided for drinking. 
 
There are numerous water treatment systems that may be implemented to serve the 
project. The process listed herein includes: water supply by deep well and pump, 
pressure tanks, contact tank for NaOCl addition, greensand filter for Mn/Fe removal, 
50 micron filter, UV disinfection, building to house the process, and a minor piping 
allowance. The exact treatment process eventually selected may be different, 
pending subsequent phases of engineering study.

different, pending subsequent phases of engineering. 
 
Beardmore Mill Process Water Supply 

A source of process water will be required for the ore milling activities at the 
proposed Beardmore Mill. The average raw water demand for ore milling is 
estimated at 15 m3/hr, according to preliminary water balance estimates made for 
the Beardmore site. A firm pumping capacity of 25 m3/hr is therefore assumed 
appropriate to cover annual variations in process water demand.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  381	

 
Process water supply options which were considered included withdrawal of water 
from the small streams located adjacent to the existing mill such as Garnet Creek, 
supply from groundwater wells, extension of municipal water service to the mill site, 
and withdrawal of water from the Blackwater River. The first three options were 
determined to be infeasible due to estimated insufficient yield from the small 
streams, uncertainty of available yield from groundwater sources, and estimated cost 
and logistic difficulties involved with extension of municipal water.  
 
The only solution considered to be potentially feasible is withdrawal of water from the 
Blackwater River. This would involve construction of a small intake structure with 
screen in the river, a raw water pump station located near the river but out of the 
flood plain, and a raw water transmission pipeline from the pump station to the 
proposed new mill location. 
 
 

 
Figure 20.2.6 – Preliminary Water Balance Estimates for the Beardmore Mill 
Site 
 
 
Because the site of the raw water intake and pumping station details remain 
undefined, preliminary cost estimates for items such as the raw water transmission 
main, power cable, and road access were made for the purposes of this study. 
 
Beardmore Mill Process Water Discharge Treatment 

Tailings slurry from the milling process will be deposited in an engineered TMF 
located in the upper reaches of the Garnet Creek valley. Effluent from the TMF will 
be collected and passed through a chemical conditioning process to assist with 
precipitation and subsequent settling and removal of TSS and co-precipitated 
arsenic within a polishing pond. Treated polishing pond effluent will be released

through a pipeline that will convey effluent down the Garnet Creek valley and 
discharge into the Blackwater River through a diffuser. 
 
The design parameters for the system are as follows: 
 

 Average monthly flowrate: 13 L/s (47 m3/h) 
 90th percentile flowrate: 18 L/s (65 m3/h) 

 
Parameters requiring treatment for removal include the following: total suspended 
solids (TSS), and arsenic (As). 
 
The treatment program will include the following major components: 
 

 TMF drainage pump station to convey tailings drainage to chemical 
conditioning. 

 Chemical conditioning process including FeSO4 and lime dosing systems 
contained in a building. 

 Polishing pond to settle and remove precipitated solids. 
 Effluent pump station to discharge treated effluent into a pipeline down the 

Garnet River valley. 
 Pipeline connection (1.2 kilometres) to Blackwater River. 
 Outfall diffuser into Blackwater River. 

 
TMF Discharge, Pumping Station, and Forcemain 

For budgetary planning purposes, it was assumed that a pumping system would 
deliver TMF discharge to a building containing chemical conditioning equipment. For 
planning purposes, it has been assumed that the pumping station would be located 
adjacent to the downstream end of the TMF. Key system components would include: 
 

 Pumping well; 
 Power cable ; 
 Road access; and 
 Forcemain  

 
20.2.3.3 Materials Management 

Ore Storage 

Transition ore stockpiles will be required on surface at the Brookbank Mine site, and 
the Beardmore Mill site.  
 
At the Brookbank Mine site, it is estimated that a 21,000 tonne coarse ore pad where 
underground trucks will dump to feed a surface crusher and a 14,000 tonne fine ore 
pad where highway trucks can be loaded will be required. These pads will be lined 
with an impermeable membrane, and runoff will be collected in a sump and sent to 
the water treatment plant before being discharged to the environment.  
 
It is assumed that supply of five days of ore (5,000 tonnes) will be stored on surface 
at the Beardmore Mill site. A waste rock pile 30 metres x 30 metres will be 
constructed on surface adjacent to the mill to feed the ore bin. The waste rock pad 
will be lined with an impermeable membrane and runoff will be collected and sent to 
the mill for subsequent treatment.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  383	

 
Waste Rock Storage 

A two million tonne waste rock storage area will be constructed to store waste 
generated from underground and open pit operations throughout the life of the mine. 
It is anticipated that one million tonnes will be used as backfill underground over the 
life of mine, with the remaining two million tonnes needing to be stored on surface. 
Waste rock will be stored to the east of the portal on cleared ground that slopes 
toward the (watercourse). Waste rock will be placed at an average height of 16 
metres at a 1.5:1 slope with a 10 metre bench every 10 metres. Runoff from the 
waste rock pile will be collected in sedimentation pond(s) and sent to the mine water 
treatment plant prior to discharge. 
 
Tailings Management Facility 

Based on historic site information, the existing tailings facility at the Northern Empire 
Mill site is estimated to have a remaining capacity for tailings associate with 100,000 
tonnes of ore processing. It has been assumed that this limited capacity will be used 
during initial startup and commissioning of the mill, and that a new facility will be 
required once full production begins to store the full life of mine tailings. Table 20.2.7 
presents the basis for design of the new tailings management facility.

A high level tailings management facility (TMF) siting study was carried out which 
identified four potential sites to construct a new facility (three of which met the 
capacity requirements of the identified mine reserve). The three potential sites are all 
located to the south of the existing Northern Empire Mill and are shown in Figure 
20.2.7. Option 4 was selected as the preferred site for this level of evaluation as it 
was closest to the mill, had the minimum volume of construction material, and is 
located in the head waters of Garnet Creek, requiring minimal diversion (Fig. 20.2.5). 
A detailed site evaluation should be conducted as the project proceeds, and site 
specific environmental and geotechnical information should be gathered as part of 
this evaluation.

Design and Construction Details 

The TMF will be formed by constructing a containment dam at the west end of the 
facility, and a diversion dam to the east end. A small portion of the headwater runoff 
may require diversion to the adjacent watershed to the east. A polishing pond dam 
will be constructed approximately 200 metres downstream of the west tailings dam. 
 
Based on available information on subsurface soils, it is not likely that suitable 
impermeable soils will be available in the area for dam construction and therefore it 
has been assumed that rockfill gravity structures will be required with an upstream 
impermeable membrane. Rockfill will be sourced from a local quarry and delivered to 
the site via access road that will be constructed to service the TMF. 
 
All containment structures for the TMF will be designed in accordance with: 
 

 Canadian Association of Dams (CDA) Dam Safety Guidelines;  
 Ontario Dam Safety Guidelines (ODSG); and  
 Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act 

(LRIA). 
 
Road Construction 

In preparation for road construction, all organic materials and loose soils should be 
excavated from the embankment footprint area. For grading purposes, the excavated 
areas will be built back to grade with structural fill. Excavated areas should be proof-
rolled prior to placement of structural fill. Any softened or disturbed areas evident 
upon proof rolling will be removed and replaced with suitably compacted structural 
fill. 
 
Structural fill will be placed in lifts and compacted to a minimum of 95% Standard 
Proctor Maximum Dry Density. Structural fill will generally be placed in 300 mm to 
500 mm lifts and suitably compacted with a minimum 10 tonne vibratory roller. In 
rockfill materials where Standard Proctor tests cannot be performed, compaction 
shall continue until no visible movement of the fill under an approved vibratory 
compactor is observed. 
 
Tailings Pipeline Installation 

When preparing a trail for pipeline installation the area must be cleared of all 
unsuitable material. The pipeline must be supported by cribbing to minimize 
deflection of the pipe. Cribbing should be placed every 20 to 50 metres depending 
on the terrain and topography. 
 
Fish Transfer 

A tributary runs through the proposed TMF site. All aquatic habitats within the 
footprint of the TMF must be completely dewatered and removed as part of the 
preparation activities prior to tailings and/or effluent being introduced into the TMF, 
under Section 35(1) of the Fisheries Act. Prior to any site preparation, fish in this 
stream will be live captured and transferred to locations approved by Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada (DFO). An experimental license will be obtained prior to any fishing 
activity. All plans will be discussed with DFO to ensure agreement.

Waste Disposal 

Solid waste will be collected in steel bins and recycled and reused to the extent 
practical. Paper and cardboard will be recycled; waste steel will be sold as scrap; 
wood and plastic will be salvaged and recycled where possible. All other solid non-
hazardous/non-toxic clean waste (other than domestic garbage) will be disposed of 
at a new clean waste disposal site to be developed for the Brookbank Mine. A 
suitable site will have to be located and a licence obtained. Recyclable solid 
materials and garbage may be collected by a local contractor for recycling or 
disposal of the garbage.  
 
All waste disposal shall be undertaken in accordance with existing regulations. 
Contractors shall be required to conduct all day-to-day operations in such a manner 
as to avoid creating any unpleasant appearances or any conditions that will be 
detrimental to the surrounding area.  
 
The contractor shall ensure that waste oils, fuels, and hazardous wastes (if any) 
shall be handled in a safe manner. Contractors will be required to transport, store 
and handle all such substances as recommended by the suppliers and/or 
manufacturers and in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial or municipal 
regulations. 
 

20.2.3.4 Reclamation and Closure 

Site Decommissioning, Preparation, and Re-Vegetation 

Premier is committed to using environmental management techniques that will 
minimize the environmental impact of the proposed mine, mill and processing 
activities, as well as comply with Provincial and Federal legislated requirements and 
regulations. Closure plans for the Brookbank Mine, the Northern Empire Mill, and 
associated TMFs are described here and incorporate requirements of the Ontario 
Mining Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M.14 (amended by S.O. 2010, c. 18. 23); Part VII 
under the Act, O. Reg 240/00 as amended, and Schedule 1 and 2, Mine 
Rehabilitation Code of Ontario. 
 
Preliminary outline closure plans and costs have been provided below for each site. 
 
Brookbank Mine 

Operations at the Brookbank Mine site will include an underground operation, open 
pit operation, a crusher, and waste rock storage (NPAG). New facilities will include 
office, mine dry, storage areas, parking, batch plant, core shack, shop, electrical 
substation, mine water treatment plant, mine drainage water treatment plant and 
warehouse. 
 
The proposed Brookbank Mine site will, throughout all phases of the mining 
operation, be designed to follow environmental best practices and requirements of 
the Mining Act, Part II. The goal is to return the land as close to its natural state as 
practical for eventual relinquishment to the crown. Progressive reclamation activities 
will be carried out where possible through mine life; however the majority of 
decommissioning and reclamation work will take place once mining has been 
completed.  
After closure, reclamation activities undertaken and completed will leave the site in a 
stable condition and potential negative impacts mitigated. If the project progresses to

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  387	

permitting, a detailed reclamation and closure plan will be developed which will 
provide specific details regarding facilities and site decommissioning, end land use 
objectives, soil handling and site preparation methods, re-vegetation treatments, and 
reclamation costs.  
 
The proposed Brookbank Mine project will include the features shown in Table 
20.2.8. There were two areas used for calculating reclamation costs; for demolition 
of infrastructure (i.e. buildings), the footprint size of the feature was used. To 
calculate the costs for site preparation, re-vegetation, and maintenance, the areas 
included the footprint area of the project features and a buffer zone to account for 
additional disturbed ground surrounding the project features.

Once the proposed mine project is ready for permanent closure, all on-site structures 
and facilities will be removed, with all salvageable parts sold or recycled, and the 
remainder disposed of in an appropriate manner. Non-salvageable materials and 
waste may be disposed of in the underground workings or open pit if permitted by 
regulatory agencies.  
 
Costs related to permanent closure of the underground workings, sealing of the vent 
raises and portals are regarded as mine operation costs and were not considered in 
the decommissioning and reclamation. The liner material used to construct the ore 
stockpile areas will be removed and hauled away for off-site disposal, or may be 
disposed of in the underground workings or open pit if permitted by regulatory 
agencies; these areas will be reclaimed and vegetated. Waste rock piles will be 
designed for closure, and minimal effort will be expected for stabilization at closure. 
Waste rock slopes will be re-graded where necessary and will be re-vegetated. For 
the purpose of this study, re-vegetation has been assumed at 100% of the surface 
area. All hazardous materials will be removed from site and appropriately disposed 
of. Any contaminated soils will be collected and disposed of appropriately or 
collected to undergo in-situ treatment. The building foundations, which cannot be 
removed, will be capped with locally sourced till material and vegetated.

20.2.3.5 Beardmore Mill Site 

The Beardmore Mill site comprises an old mill site (existing Northern Empire Mill) to 
be used for the planned operation; the new mill facilities, and TMF. Reclamation of 
all mill facilities and tailings disposal areas will be designed to follow environmental 
best practices and aim to return the land as close to its natural state as practical.  
 
Progressive reclamation activities will be carried out where possible throughout the 
proposed project life; however the majority of decommissioning and reclamation 
work will take place once milling has been completed.  
 
At permanent closure, the proposed and existing mill complexes will be cleaned out, 
decommissioned, and equipment sold or salvaged prior to demolition and removal. 
Foundations will be filled or broken and covered as required for safety, stability, and 
aesthetics. The tailings area will be allowed to drain, and the surface contoured as 
needed to ensure site stability. Surface drainage area channels will be allowed to 
form, and be stabilized with coarse rock. A small pond will be left to attenuate flows, 
provide settling time, and capture run-off for safe conveyance to the receiving 
environment through a spillway. The pond and water conveyances will be designed 
and built to ensure long term stability of the tailings storage facility under severe 
storm conditions (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, LRIA 454/96, and Dam 
Decommissioning and Removal Technical Bulletin August 24, 2011). The exposed 
tailings area will be re-vegetated to stabilize the surface. Once the site is stabilized, 
and suspended solid limits are met, it should be possible to remove the polishing 
pond and allow a natural flow from the area. 
 
The Beardmore Mill site will include the features shown inTable 20.2.9. In order to 
calculate the reclamation costs for this site, the same approach was used as the 
Brookbank Mine site in Section 20.4.1.1.

General Reclamation Approach for Brookbank Mine and Beardmore Mill 

After closure, reclamation activities undertaken and completed will leave the site in a 
stable condition and potential negative impacts mitigated. If the project proceeds, a 
detailed reclamation and closure plan will be developed for aboriginal, community 
consultation, and formal government approvals which will provide specific details 
regarding facilities and site decommissioning, end land use objectives, soil handling 
and site preparation methods, re-vegetation treatments, and reclamation costs.  
 
Following decommissioning of facilities and structures, site preparation activities will 
be undertaken to prepare the sites for re-vegetation including: 
 

 Permanent deactivation of mine access roads in which all natural drainages 
crossing the road prism are restored; ripping/scarification of the road to 
decompact the surface; pullback of sidecast slopes and backfill of cutbanks; 
installation of cross-ditches and waterbars. 

 Scarification/ripping of any compacted ground surfaces. 
 Recontouring of all disturbed areas to blend in with surrounding topography 

and to re-establish natural drainage patterns. 
 Deactivation of water management features that are no longer required such 

as the polishing pond and ditches. This will include recontouring/spreading of 
pond berms; backfilling of ponds; backfilling of ditches; and re-establishing 
natural drainage patterns. 

 Backfilling of mine portals to prevent access into the portals and to blend in 
with the surrounding topography. 

 Capping of disturbed areas as needed with locally sourced soil material to 
provide a growth medium for reclamation vegetation. 

 
Once the disturbance sites have undergone preparation they will be re-vegetated 
with plant species that are suitable for reclamation and the end land uses of the 
area. The goals of reclamation vegetation will be to: 
 

 Prevent erosion and sedimentation to protect aquatic resources and prevent 
invasive plant establishment. 

 Re-establish a productive land use that is of value for wildlife and other 
potential stakeholders (e.g. First Nations), and mitigates the residual effects 
of mining on ecosystems. 

 
For decommissioning of the open pit, the project proponent will follow the guidelines 
set out in Schedule 1, Part 2, Sections 21 to 24 of the Mine Rehabilitation Code of 
Ontario. This will include tasks such as flooding, backfilling, resloping of pit edges, 
method of egress, and installation of safety barriers, such as chain link fencing or 
boulders. 
 
If the mine project is approved for development, the reclamation and closure plan will 
detail vegetation species that will be suitable for use in site reclamation.

 Corporate Commitments and Consultation 

20.2.4.1 Corporate Commitments 

This section discusses the social and community factors related to the project, and 
summarizes Premier Gold's requirements and status of current strategies and data 
gaps.  
 

20.2.4.2 Government Agencies 

Early engagement with regulators is key to ensuring a unified path forward. 
Discussions should be initiated with MNDM, the Ministry of the Environment, the 
Ministry of Natural Resources, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and other applicable agencies, to raise awareness 
about the Project.  
 
Building relationships with the key Federal and Provincial departments will help 
improve the visibility of the Project and confirm acceptance of the proposed path 
forward, possibly allowing for expedited approval times. Active management of 
issues and leveraging Federal and Provincial government relationships will help 
improve Project understanding and minimize the any deviation from the proposed 
Project schedule.  
 
Given the Provincial government is responsible for the majority of the key permits / 
approvals required for the Project, consulting with the appropriate entities before 
application/approval submission will ensure a greater level of clarity regarding the 
need to amend permits/approvals or the submission of new application. It will assist 
Premier in developing the most expeditious route for obtaining the necessary 
permits/approvals with the least amount of anticipated conflicts and issues.  
 
The development of a Regulatory Engagement Strategy would ensure the correct 
information is provided to the appropriate agency as it is required. Engagement with 
regulators would foster a functional working relationship and ensure information 
sharing is consistent.  
 
The key regulatory agencies that would form the core Government Review Team 
would be expected to include: 

 
 Provincial Agencies: 
- Ministry of Northern Development and Mines;  
- Ministry of the Environment; 
- Ministry of Natural Resources; 
- Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport; and 
- Ministry of Transportation. 

 Federal Agencies: 
- Canadian Environmental Assessmenr Agency 
- Natural Resources Canada 
- Fisheries and Oceans Canada; 
- Transport Canada; and, 
- Environment Canada. 

 Local Agencies: 
- Municipality of Greenstone 

 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  391	

A more expanded Government Review Team would be required under the proposed 
scenario whereby a coordinated EA would be undertaken. 
 

20.2.4.3 General Public 

Premier intends to provide relevant, timely information to residents, guided by a 
consultation program with all milestones identified, and how they fit into the 
permitting process. Premier will follow the Code of Practice for Consultation in 
Ontario's Environmental Assessment Process (2007), and relevant best-practices 
identified by the Project team.  
 
Premier understands that effective consultation will be a key driver to project 
success, and development of the Terms of Reference (ToR) for any environmental 
assessment will be in coordination with relevant stakeholders and Aboriginal 
communities. The ToR will define next steps and methods for baseline and impact 
assessment studies, and will identify valued components of the local environment 
that are of importance to its residents.  
 
In anticipation of the permitting and consultation process, Premier has opened a 
local office in Geraldton, ON, conducted community meetings, and initiated a 
communications log to track all communications for the Project. All consultation 
outcomes will be integrated into the socio-economic and natural environment 
baseline, and the effects assessment.  
 
Premier will open the Northern Empire Mill in Beardmore, in the Municipality of 
Greenstone, and the Brookbank Mine site northeast of Beardmore. Local residents 
will need to be actively engaged, with frequent updates on Project timelines, 
activities, and potential impacts on their community.  
 
Potential community engagement opportunities: 
 

 Follow through on March 2013 community meeting. 
 Community newsletter. 
 Web presence. 
 Targeted communications for adjacent communities and tourism operations. 
 Continued discussions with the Municipality of Greenstone. 
 Investigate funding of local events. 
 Community meetings. 
 Site visits. 
 Community advisory committee. 
 Website portal for local residents. 
 Job fairs. 

 
20.2.4.4 First Nations and Métis 

Premier has been working effectively to build and maintain personal and respectful 
relationships with First Nations and Métis communities in the area. The Brookbank 
Project is located in parts of the traditional territories of Nokiiwin affiliated First Nation 
(such as Animbiigoo Zaagi'igan Anishinaabek (AZA), Biinjitiwaabik Zaaging 
Anishinaabek (BZA) and Bingwi Neyaashi Anishinaabek (BNA) First Nations) and 
Matawa affiliated First Nation (such as Ginoogaming, Long Lake #58 and Aroland

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  392	

First Nations). The Brookbank component may also impact Metis activities (such as 
Metis Nations of Ontario and Red Sky Independent Metis Nation). 
 

20.2.4.5 Authorizations 

Federal 

Environmental Assessments 

Under CEAA, 2012 only Designated Projects included in the Regulations 
Designating Physical Activities require a Federal EA. It is anticipated that the Project 
will be a Designated Project pursuant to Section 15(c) of the Regulations as it 
involves the construction, operation, decommissioning, and abandonment of a gold 
mine, other than a placer mine, with an ore production capacity of 600 t/d or more.  
 
The Standard EA process is comprised of a project description, screening, 
assessment, environment impact statement (EIS) guidelines, EIS statement, and 
ministerial decision. The regulated timelines under which the CEAA Agency has 
management of the project is 52 weeks. It is anticipated that approximately an 
additional 9 to 12 months would be required to prepare, review, and finalize the EIS. 
 
Permits / Approvals 

Table 20.2.10 presents the possible Federal permits and approvals required for 
development at the Project site. 
 
Federal regulators responsible for key permits/approvals will not approve the permit/ 
approval until after the Federal EA is complete and approved.

Provincial 

Environmental Assessments 

In Ontario, mining development projects are carried out by private sector proponents 
and are not subject to Provincial EA requirements, although certain ancillary 
activities such as constructing road access, transmission lines, generation facilities 
or modifications to Provincial highways associated with a mining development may 
be subject to the OEAA through one or more prescribed Class EA processes. Based 
on the current understanding of the Project, the following infrastructure/equipment 
would require the completion of a Class EA or equivalently regulated EA process: 
 
A transmission line connecting the Brookbank site to Hydro One Networks' existing 
infrastructure located at the intersection of Windigokan Rd and Highway 11 (Class 
EA For Minor Transmission Facilities); 
 
A diesel generator for mine dewatering and identified critical loads (Electricity 
Projects Regulation, Ontario Regulation 116/01); 
 
The disposition of Crown land and potential impacts to Species at Risk (Class EA for 
MNR Resource Stewardship and Facility Development Projects); and, 
 
A waste disposal site for solid nonhazardous/non-toxic clean waste (other than 
domestic garbage) (Waste Management Projects, Ontario Regulation 101/07). 
 
Once Premier confirms the preferred option for the Brookbank project final 
confirmation of the approval requirements will need to be completed.  
 
Permits / Approvals 

A number of permits/approvals will be required at the Provincial level (Table 20.2.11) 
for the Project to enter into the development phase. Provincial regulators responsible 
for key permits/approvals will not approve the permit/approval until after any 
applicable Provincial EAs are complete and approved.

21. CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

The following section of Capital and Operating Costs is taken directly from the report 
titled "Trans-Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary 
Economic Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, 
prepared by Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 

 HARDROCK 

All costs are estimated in Q1 2014 Canadian Dollars and are to a preliminary 
economic assessment level of accuracy of ±35% to ±45% percent. Costs have been 
calculated from first principles, or based on recent experience for similar installations 
at other project sites. Equipment and material purchase prices are based on recent 
and escalated vendor quotes.  All surface capital construction will be completed by 
contractors. The facilities will be operated by the owner over the life of the mine. 
 
The costs have been calculated using Hard Dollar estimating software. Material take 
offs for construction activities were prepared and entered into Hard Dollar where unit 
costs were then applied. 
 

 Capital Costs 

Capital costs are defined as all costs incurred up to the end of the project period. 
Capital costs incurred after this date are included in sustaining capital costs. For this 
study, the end of the project period is defined by achieving 60% of steady state 
production for three consecutive months from open pit operations. 
 
The capital costs include pre-feasibility and feasibility study, detailed engineering, 
closure plan, permitting, surface infrastructure construction, capital equipment 
procurement, and the Hardrock Mill construction. A contingency of 25% for the mill 
construction and a contingency of 30% have been applied to all other pre-production 
capital costs. The capital costs have been summarized in Table 21.1.1.

production are estimated at $5.86M and sustaining capital costs are estimated at 
$120M. 
 
Capital fixed plant equipment (pumps, compressors, etc.) are included with the direct 
costs of facilities construction.  
 

21.1.1.2 Surface Infrastructure 

Surface infrastructure construction will be completed by contractor personnel. 
Surface infrastructure estimates are developed based upon pro-rated costs from 
Stantec's cost resource database and historical quotes from suppliers. 
 

21.1.1.3 Process Plant Capital 

The process plant capital costs were estimated using cost models, suppliers' budget 
quotes, experience, conceptual designs and information from recent similar projects. 
The process plant direct capital cost, including the tailings and water reclaim 
pipelines, is estimated at $209.5M for Phase I and $113.9M for Phase II. The overall 
process plant's capital cost, including indirect costs and contingency, is estimated at 
$305.4M for Phase I and $166.0M for Phase II. The capital cost breakdown by 
discipline is shown inTable 21.1.2.

geotechnical information, it is assumed that no special foundations such as piling will 
be required. 
 
To minimize the initial capital investment, most equipment and plant infrastructure for 
Phase I have been sized for the initial throughput of 10,000 tpd. During the next 
stage of the project, the construction schedule and capital costs will be better 
defined. At this time it will be feasible to decide if certain construction activities 
assigned to Phase II should be undertaken during the Phase I construction period 
and considered as part of the initial CAPEX. 
 
Indirect Costs 

With the exception of milling indirect costs, indirect cost estimates are based on the 
anticipated annual manpower and equipment operating costs required for the capital 
period of the project.  Indirect costs are established at 17% of the direct costs for the 
process plant and 12% for the tailings and water reclaim pipeline. It is assumed that 
the Owner will manage and supervise the construction activities with minimal 
assistance from external organizations. 
 
Owner's costs are excluded from this process facility estimate and are calculated 
based on the global project cost. 
 
Contingency 

The contingency for the process facility only is established at 25% of the total of the 
direct and indirect costs for the life of mine. Contingency for the remaining areas of 
the cost estimate are established at 30% of the direct and indirect costs for the 
capital period only. 
 

 Operating Costs 

Operating costs include all open pit and mill costs, other than sustaining capital 
costs. The life of mine operating costs will include both direct and indirect costs. The 
total operating costs (Including Year – 1) are summarized in Table 21.1.3.  
 
 
Table 21.1.3 – Budgeted Operating Cost Summary

Spare Parts/Liners/Maintenance 

The annual cost for liner changes has been estimated based on previous internal 
projects and comparable operations. Spare parts for the equipment, other than the 
required liner changes, have been estimated at approximately 5% of the total 
mechanical equipment cost. Other costs include maintenance allocations for the 
assay and metallurgical laboratories, staff offices and process plant in general. 
 
Grinding Media 

The grinding media consumption in the SAG and ball mills were taken to be 49 and 
58 g/kWh respectively, based on benchmarked values. 
 
Electrical Power and Propane 

The electricity cost was taken to be 0.080 $/kWh. The annual consumption of 
electricity was estimated based on the electrical loads of major mechanical 
equipment with allocations for peripheral equipment. The cost for natural gas was 
taken to be 0.32 $/m3. Natural gas consumption for heating was calculated based on 
building volumes and includes heating for the crushing and reclaim areas as well as 
mill building. 
 

 Indirect Operating Costs 

All costs not directly related to mine development, construction, or production 
activities have been included in the indirect operating costs. Indirect operating costs 
have been developed from first principles and recent experience on similar projects. 
The indirect operating costs consist of the following: 
 

 Support labour (built up labour rates including wages, overtime, bonus, and 
allowances); 

 Indirect hourly labour; 
 Staff operating; 
 Engineering and geology;  
 Administration; 
 Mobile equipment operating costs (fuel and lubricants, spare parts, tires,

The open pit mobile fleet is shown in the table below.  
 
 
Table 21.1.10 – Open Pit Mobile Fleet by Year 

 
 
 

 Scheduling 

Scheduling is based on a 365 day per year operation.  
 
The estimate and schedule are presented in three phases: 
 

 Studies and permitting phase, which includes completing a feasibility study, 
detailed engineering, closure plan, and permitting. 

 Capital (project period) infrastructure phase, which includes surface 
construction, open pit infrastructure development, capital equipment 
procurement, and the Hardrock Mill construction.  

 Operating phase, which includes direct and indirect costs of open pit mining 
and sustaining capital.  

 
21.1.7.1 Studies and Permitting 

Once the preliminary economic assessment is complete, the next phase will be to 
complete a prefeasibility study followed by a feasibility study and detailed 
engineering. During the completion of the prefeasibility study, permitting and closure 
plans can be started. The time line required to complete the above tasks is 
approximately 24 months. 
 

21.1.7.2 Surface Infrastructure Construction 

Surface construction activities can begin once the closure plan has been approved 
and the required permits are in place. The time line to complete the required surface 
infrastructure to start open pit activities is approximately nine months.  
 
The mill construction at the Hardrock site is scheduled to be complete in two years. 
Surface construction crews will work a 12 hour shift, one shift per day, seven days 
per week.

 BROOKBANK 

All costs for the base case and option B are estimated in Q4 2013 Canadian dollars 
and are to a preliminary economic assessment level of accuracy of ±35% to ±45% 
percent. Costs have been calculated from first principles, or based on recent 
experience for similar installations at other project sites. Equipment and material 
purchase prices are based on recent and escalated vendor quotes. All underground 
mine development and operations work (excluding portal construction and ventilation 
raising), will be completed by the owner's labour force. All surface capital 
construction will be completed by contractors. The facilities will be operated by the 
owner over the life of the mine. 
 
The costs have been calculated using Hard Dollar estimating software. Material take 
offs for construction and mining activities were prepared and entered into Hard Dollar 
where unit costs were then applied. 
 

 Capital Costs 

Capital costs for both the base case and option B are defined as all costs incurred up 
to the end of the project period (December 2018). Capital costs incurred after this 
date are included in sustaining capital costs. For this study, the end of the project 
period is defined by achieving 60% of steady state production for three consecutive 
months from underground operations. 
 
The capital costs include pre-feasibility and feasibility study, detailed engineering, 
closure plan, permitting, surface infrastructure construction, underground 
infrastructure development, underground infrastructure construction, capital 
equipment procurement, and the Beardmore Mill construction. A contingency of 30% 
has been applied to pre-production capital cost only and 25% contingency for the 
process plant construction. The capital costs for both cases have been summarized 
in Table 21.2.1.

21.2.1.1 Ramp Development 

Ramp development quantities are based on two typical level drawings (a Main Level 
and a Sub Level). Each active production level in the mine will be accessed by the 
ramp system. 
 
The estimated unit cost for ramp development has been developed from first 
principles using labour rates (including wages, overtime, bonus, and allowances), 
mobile equipment operating costs (fuel and lubricants, spare parts, tires, buckets), 
consumable materials, services materials (piping, ventilation ducting, electrical 
cables), and calculated productivities. The ramp development unit costs do not 
include haulage of the waste rock (identified separately). The ramp development unit

costs are based on an average 4.5 metre per day advance rate. This advance rate is 
consistent with Stantec experience with other projects. The 5.5 metre x 5.5 metre 
ramp development unit cost is summarized in Table 21.2.2

21.2.1.2 Waste Infrastructure Development 

Waste infrastructure development quantities have been based on typical level 
drawings. Waste development includes lateral waste accesses to the mineralized 
zones, FAR access, and underground facility development. All waste infrastructure 
development will be completed with owner crews. 
 
The estimated unit cost for lateral waste development has been developed from first 
principles using labour rates (including wages, overtime, bonus, and allowances), 
mobile equipment operating costs (fuel and lubricants, spare parts, tires, buckets), 
consumable materials, services materials (piping, ventilation ducting, electrical 
cables), and calculated productivities. The lateral waste development unit costs do 
not include haulage of the waste rock (identified separately). The waste development 
unit costs are based on an average 6 metre per day advance rate (multiple heading). 
This advance rate is consistent with Stantec experience with other studies. The 5 
metre x 4.5 metre waste infrastructure development unit rate is summarized in Table 
21.2.3.

buckets), alimak machine rental, consumable materials, services materials (piping, 
ventilation ducting, electrical cables), and calculated productivities. The unit costs do 
not include haulage of the waste rock (identified separately) or primary mucking of 
waste rock (this will be completed by the owner). The raise development unit costs 
are based on an average 1.0 metre per day advance rate (includes setup and 
teardown) and accounts for pilot raising and second pass raise slashing. This 
advance rate is consistent with Stantec experience with other studies. The 4.3 metre

Capital fixed plant equipment (fans, pumps, compressors, etc.) are included with the 
direct costs of facilities construction.  
 

21.2.1.5 Surface Infrastructure 

Surface infrastructure construction will be completed by contractor personnel. 
Surface infrastructure estimates are developed from first principles using labour 
rates (including wages, overtime, bonus, allowances, and overhead), mobile 
equipment operating costs (fuel and lubricants, spare parts, tires, buckets), 
consumable materials, services materials (piping, ventilation ducting, electrical 
cables), and quotes from suppliers.  
 
The capital costs for the surface infrastructure at the Beardmore mill and tailings 
area has been removed from Option B. 
 

21.2.1.6 Underground Infrastructure and Construction

Direct Costs 

The process plant direct costs are based on the process mechanical equipment 
costs. Major equipment costs were obtained from supplier budgetary quotations for 
new equipment. The remaining equipment was estimated using BBA's in-house 
database and similar projects. Direct costs were calculated for each discipline using 
information and factors from recent estimates. The electrical substation cost was 
estimated based on the overall electrical requirements obtained from the equipment 
list and recent project data that was adjusted for this study.  
 
Used equipment will be purchased when possible. For this estimate the secondary 
crusher, the ball mill and the mill electrical substation were considered as such. The 
associated savings are estimated to be approximately $4M. 
 
Indirect Costs 

Indirect costs include owner's cost, engineering, procurement and construction 
management (EPCM), factored from the total direct costs. Owner's cost and EPCM 
are estimated respectively at 9% and 16.5% of the direct costs. 
 
Contingency 

The contingency is established at 27% of the total of the direct and indirect costs.

21.2.2.2 Operating Development  

Underground operating development quantities have been based two typical level 
drawings and includes sill development along the mineralized zones as well as 
operating waste development to access the mineralization.  
 
The estimated unit cost for operating waste development is the same as the capital 
lateral waste development. 
 
The unit cost for sill development has been developed from first principles using 
labour rates (including wages, overtime, bonus, and allowances), mobile equipment 
operating costs (fuel and lubricants, spare parts, tires, buckets), consumable 
materials, services materials (piping, ventilation ducting, electrical cables), and 
anticipated productivities. The unit costs do not include haulage of the waste rock 
(presented in Table 21.2.9). The operating development unit costs have been based 
on a 6.0 metre per day advance rate. This advance rate is consistent with Stantec 
experience with other studies. The 5 metre x 4.5 metre sill development unit rate is 
summarized inTable 21.2.7.

New trucking costs were derived to move the open pit and underground production 
from the Brookbank site to the Hardrock mill and were added to the operating cost of 
Option B. The basis for the cost estimate was a factored contractor haulage costs 
from a similar recent project. A transportation charge of $14.76/t was used for 
trucking the Brookbank ore to the Hardrock mill. 
 

21.2.2.5 Indirect Operating Costs 

All costs not directly related to mine development, construction, or production 
activities have been included in the indirect operating costs. Indirect operating costs

Spare Parts / Liners / Maintenance 

The annual cost for liner changes has been estimated based on previous internal 
projects and other comparable operations. Equipment spare parts, other than 
required liner changes, have been estimated at approximately 5% of the total 
mechanical equipment cost. Other costs include maintenance allocations for the 
assay and metallurgical laboratories, staff offices and process plant in general. 
 
Grinding Media 

The grinding media consumption in the ball mill was estimated at 65 g/kWh based on 
benchmarked values. 
 
Electrical Power and Propane 

The electricity cost was estimated at 0.10 $/kWh. The annual consumption of 
electricity was estimated based on the electrical loads of major mechanical 
equipment with allocations for peripheral equipment. The propane price is 0.60 $/L. 
Propane consumption for heating was calculated based on the building volume and 
included heating for the crusher and mill buildings and for the reclaim area beneath 
the mill feed bin. 
 

21.2.2.7 Process Plant Operating Costs for Option B 

Based on historical test work, it is expected that additional reagents would be 
required to process the Brookbank material at the Hardrock mill. The 900 tpd of 
Brookbank material will replace 900 tpd of Hardrock material for a continuous total 
throughput of 18,000 tpd. BBA recalculated the Hardrock mill operating costs to take 
into account the additional reagents required. The operating costs were revised as 
shown in the table below. The operating cost for the mill at 18,000 tpd (including the 
900tpd from Brookbank) was recalculated to be $11.24/t. Option B was used for the 
financial analysis.

21.2.2.8 Labour Count (On Payroll) 

The total payroll labour count to support a 900 tpd operation is summarized in Table 
21.1.9. This includes direct hourly, indirect hourly, staff operating, engineering and 
geology, and administration. Total payroll labour count at the mine is 133 and 49 at 
the mill for a total of 182 during steady state. 
 

21.2.2.9 Mobile Equipment Count 

The mobile equipment fleet required to support a 900 tpd operation is summarized in 
Table 21.1.10. The list includes surface mobile equipment and direct and indirect 
underground mobile equipment. During steady state production, 35 units of mobile 
equipment will need to be maintained for life of mine. Mobile equipment replacement 
costs have not been included in the estimate given the seven year life of mine.  
 

 Scheduling 

Mining and development tasks were designed in AutoCAD and scheduled in MS 
Project. The mining and development tasks/quantities were transferred into Hard 
Dollar. 
 
Scheduling is based on a 355 day per year operation. The estimate and schedule 
are presented in three phases: 
 

 Studies and permitting phase, which includes completing a feasibility study, 
detailed engineering, closure plan, and permitting. 

 Capital (project period) infrastructure phase, which includes surface 
construction, open pit infrastructure development, underground infrastructure 
development, underground infrastructure construction, capital equipment 
procurement, and the Beardmore Mill construction.  

 Operating phase, which includes direct and indirect costs of mining and 
sustaining capital.  

 
21.2.3.1 Studies and Permitting 

Once the preliminary economic assessment is complete, the next phase will be to 
complete a prefeasibility study followed by a feasibility study and detailed 
engineering. During the completion of the prefeasibility study, permitting and closure 
plans can be started. The time line required to complete the above tasks is 
approximately 24 months. 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  418	

21.2.3.2 Surface Infrastructure Construction 

Surface construction activities can begin once the closure plan has been approved 
and the required permits are in place. The time line to complete the required surface 
infrastructure to start underground activities is approximately nine months.  
 
The mill construction at the Beardmore site is scheduled to be complete in 2016. 
 
Surface construction crews will work a 12 hour shift, one shift per day, seven days 
per week.  
 

21.2.3.3 Underground Infrastructure Development and Construction 

Underground infrastructure construction will begin in March 2016 with the new portal 
construction. Steady state production (900 tpd) will be obtained in March 2019, three 
months after the project period end of December 2018.  
 
Underground crews will work 10 hour shifts, two shifts per day, and seven days per 
week. 
 

21.2.3.4 PEA Level Closure and Reclamation Costs 

Conceptual closure and reclamation cost estimates are provided in the PEA study to 
provide an idea of overall reclamation costs at mine closure. The costs are based on 
PEA level engineering design; and for that reason they are subject to change once 
mine plans are further developed. The PEA level closure and reclamation costs will 
include: 
 

 Costs to develop a formal closure plan to meet requirements for aboriginal, 
community consultation, and Provincial government approvals. 

 Decommissioning and closure of mine, mill and tailings infrastructure, and 
facilities. 

 Site preparation for re-vegetation such as resloping, ripping, and soil 
replacement. 

 Re-vegetation treatments. 
 Water and reclamation monitoring programs. 
 Mobilization and demobilization. 
 Closure plan management costs, including the need for periodic updates 

during the life of mine, detailed engineering, and project management costs 
at closure. 

 Allowance for additional costs (20 percent). 
 Option B closure costs were adjusted to remove costs related to the 

Beardmore site. 
 
A summary of reclamation costs has been provided inTable 21.2.15. The total 
reclamation costs at mine closure for permanent reclamation is approximately 
$6,542,669 for the Base Case and $3,202,411 for Option B. All costs are presented 
in 2013 dollars and have not been adjusted for inflation. This amount would be the 
basis for the financial assurance required by MNDM to cover costs for mine closure, 
decommissioning, and reclamation.

Key Assumptions and Approach 

Certain key assumptions have been made for this estimate, which drive the cost 
estimate for final mine closure costs. These assumptions are highlighted as follows: 
 
 All costs are calculated in 2013 CAD$, and costs for reclamation liability are 

presented for various mine project features and areas as listed in Table 21.2.15. 
 General costs cover the Beardmore Mill (old Northern Empire Mill, new 

Beardmore) and Brookbank sites assume: 
 

o Post-closure monitoring is for a period of five years with three field monitoring 
occasions following completion of permanent reclamation.  

o Monitoring costs were derived from variety of typical sampling programs 
conducted by Stantec.  

o Monitoring costs to cover the following programs: water quality; aquatic effect 
monitoring; vegetation biomass and species composition; metal uptake in 
vegetation; soil monitoring; tree/shrub assessments; invasive plant surveys / 
management; contaminated site investigation; dam inspections; waste rock 
dump stability inspections and erosion assessment. 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  420	

o Monitoring costs are based on work done by third parties.  
o Consultation with Aboriginal groups and communities. 
 

 Tailings and mine waste rock will be Non-Potentially Acid Generating (NPAG). 
 Flooding of the open pit at closure will be acceptable by authorities and pit 

closure will follow the guidelines set out in Schedule 1, Part 2, Sections 21 to 24 
of the Mine Rehabilitation Code of Ontario.  

 Minimal care and maintenance requirements following post-closure (five year 
monitoring period). 

 Natural site run-off and storm flows will meet downstream water quality 
requirements from all developed areas, including the tailings area. 

 Project feature areas have an additional buffer area to account for adjacent 
disturbed ground and inaccuracies in area measurements.  

 Costing values are contractor rates, not mine operating rates. 
 For the equipment unit costs, Ontario 2013 Ontario Provincial Standard 

Specifications were used. 
 Budget has been allocated for heavy equipment mobilization and demobilization 

costs and all estimates are based on one mobilization and demobilization. 
 Equipment productivity rates are based on actual production rates from a number 

of Canadian mines, the Caterpillar Performance Handbook (Edition 40, January 
2010) and from a number of mine reclamation costing studies. 

 Ripping rates are based on 30 – 50 cm rip depth using D8 to D11 CAT dozers 
with rippers. 

 Soil material capping costs are based on an average replacement depth of 0.2 
metres over all surface disturbances being permanently reclaimed. 

 Re-vegetation material costs were reviewed and determined from seed, fertilizer, 
and seedling suppliers. 

 Costs were derived from similar sized underground mine projects for which 
closure costs have been recently calculated. 

 Site preparation costs for reclamation include: load/haul/spread locally sourced 
soil capping material; recontouring, scarification of compacted ground; and road 
deactivation. 

 Re-vegetation costs include aerial application of native grass seed mix and 
fertilizer and planting of native tree/shrub seedlings. 

 Re-vegetation maintenance costs include two years of aerial fertilizer application 
following initial re-vegetation. This treatment is to aid establishment/growth of 
reclamation vegetation. 

 Costing includes a 20% allowance to cover any cost overruns due to project 
delays, weather shutdowns, equipment/manpower availability delays, additional 
features or cost increases, etc. 
Costs not included: 

o Senior management costs. 
o Mine water treatment if required. 
o Treatment of potentially acid generating material (if found). 
o Treating contaminated soils (if found). 
o Legal costs. 
o Land holding costs: municipal taxes and leases.

22. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The following section of Economic Analysis is taken directly from the report titled 
"Trans-Canada Property, Hardrock and Brookbank Projects, Preliminary Economic 
Assessment, NI 43-101 Technical Report", dated March 13, 2014, prepared by 
Stantec Consulting Ltd (St-Laurent et al., 2014). 
 

 HARDROCK 

 Basis of Evaluation 

Stantec has assessed the project based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash 
flow from the production plan (base case) has been forecast and the resulting Net 
Present Value (NPV) calculated. The sensitivity of the NPV to changes in the base 
case assumptions were assessed. 
 

 External Factors 

22.1.2.1 Exchange Rate 

All costs, revenues, etc., in this study are expressed in Canadian dollars. Costs are 
based on constant, Q1 2014 Canadian dollars with no provision for escalation or 
inflation. 
An exchange rate of C$1.00 = US$0.95 was used. This exchange rate was provided 
to Stantec by Premier Gold. 
 

22.1.2.2 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (Discount Rate) 

A discount rate of 5% has been used in the NPV calculations based on current 
interest rates and the rates used in recent 43-101 compliant reports. This discount 
rate was provided to Stantec by Premier Gold. 
 

22.1.2.3 Metal Prices 

A base case gold price of US$1,250/oz. (C$1,316/oz.) was used throughout the life 
of the project. This gold price was provided to Stantec by Premier Gold. 
 

22.1.2.4 Taxes 

The Hardrock Project is subject to mining rights payments, taxes, and municipal, 
provincial and federal income taxes. The project is eligible for a tax credit for 
exploration activities. Mining rights payments and tax credits were not evaluated in 
this study. Taxes were calculated by Premier, reviewed by Price Waterhouse Cooper 
and evaluated into the cash flow model.  
 

22.1.2.5 Royalties 

A 3% royalty was applied to the Hardrock economic analysis per advice from 
Premier Gold. 
 

22.1.2.6 Selling Expense  

An allowance of $4.00 per ounce has been included in the financial analysis for gold

 Sensitivities 

The capital and operating costs, gold price, average mine grade and discount rate 
was varied to observe the influence of these parameters on project profitability. Each 
parameter was changed over a range of ±25% from the base case assumptions. 
 
Figure 22.1.2 illustrates the influence of changes in these parameters (before taxes) 
on the project NPV. Increases in capital and operating costs will decrease the NPV 
while increases in the price of gold or mining grade will increase the NPV. Altering 
the discount rate had a relatively minimal impact on the project economics.

 Basis of Evaluation 

Stantec has assessed the project based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash 
flow from the production plan of the base case and option B has been forecasted 
and the resulting Net Present Value (NPV) calculated. The sensitivity of the NPV to 
changes in the base case assumptions were assessed. 
 

 External Factors 

22.2.2.1 Exchange Rate 

All costs, revenues, etc., in this study are expressed in Canadian dollars. Costs are 
based on constant, 2013 Canadian dollars with no provision for escalation or 
inflation. 
 
An exchange rate of C$1.00 = US$1.0526 was used. This exchange rate was 
provided to Stantec by Premier Gold.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  427	

22.2.2.2 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (Discount Rate) 

A discount rate of 5% has been used in the NPV calculations based on current 
interest rates and the rates used in recent 43-101 compliant reports. 
 

22.2.2.3 Metal Prices 

A base case gold price of US$1,250/oz. (C$1,316/oz.) was used throughout the life 
of the project. 
 

22.2.2.4 Taxes 

The Brookbank Project is subject to mining rights payments, taxes, and municipal, 
provincial and federal income taxes. The project is eligible for a tax credit for 
exploration activities. Mining rights payments and tax credits were not evaluated in 
this study. Taxes were calculated by Premier, reviewed by Price Waterhouse Cooper 
and evaluated into the cash flow model.   
 

22.2.2.5 Royalties 

A 1% royalty was applied to the Brookbank economic analysis per advice from 
Premier Gold. 
 

22.2.2.6 Selling Expense  

An allowance of $4.00 per ounce has been included in the financial analysis for gold 
refining charges and transportation costs.

 Sensitivities 

The capital and operating costs, gold price, average mine grade and discount rates 
were varied to observe the influence of these parameters on project profitability. 
Each parameter was changed over a range of ±25% from the base case 
assumptions. 
 
Figure 22.2.3 illustrates the influence of changes in these parameters on the project 
NPV. Increases in capital and operating costs will decrease the NPV while increases 
in the price of gold or mining grade will increase the NPV. Altering the discount rate 
had a relatively minimal impact on the project economics.

 HARDROCK  

The following Hardrock section is taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock deposit (according to 
National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). 
 
There are no adjacent properties that have any significant information relating to the 
Hardrock Project. Premier Gold maintains a significant land position in the Geraldton 
mining camp, and most of the camp's historical mineral deposits (Fig. 23.1.1 and 
Table 23.1.1) are located within the boundaries of Premier Gold's projects. 
 
 
Table 23.1.1 – Gold production statistics for the Bankfield, Little Long Lac, 
Magnet, Talmora Long Lac and Tombill mines (from Ferguson et al., 1971; 
Mason and White, 1986) 

 
 
 

 Talmore Long Lac Mine (Past Producer) 

This description was mostly taken from Ferguson et al. (1971) except where noted.  
 
The past producing Talmore Long Lac mine is located in Errington Township, on the 
south side of Barton Bay in Kenogamisis Lake, and 4 km southwest of the Town of 
Geraldton (Fig. 23.1.1).  
 
Between 1934 and 1936, an extensive surface trenching and diamond drilling 
program was performed by Longlac Lagoon Gold Mines, revealing three mineralized 
zones.  
 
Between 1938 and 1940, a shaft was sunk to a depth of 544 ft (165.8 m) with levels 
at 195 ft (59.4 m), 315 ft (96.0 m) and 515 ft (157.0 m) on which 4,796 ft (1,461.8 m) 
of drifting and 1,038 ft (316.4 m) of crosscutting were done. Diamond drilling 
included 400 ft (121.9 m) from surface and 2,449 ft (746.5 m) in four (4) underground 
holes. All work was done by Elmos Gold Mines Ltd.  
 
Between 1940 and 1942, trenching, stripping and two (2) underground diamond drill 
holes totalling 234 ft were carried out by Tombill Gold Mines Ltd. A small 50-ton mill 
was constructed on the mine site during winter 1941-1942. Underground work was 
resumed in March, 1942, and during the summer, 1,017 ounces of gold and 36.5

ounces of silver were produced from 3,947 tons of sorted material. Due to the 
unfavourable wartime conditions, operations were suspended in November of the 
same year.  
 
Between 1947 and 1948, Talmora Longlac Gold Mines Ltd completed 1,663 ft 
(506.9 m) of drifting and 670 ft (204.2 m) of crosscutting. Diamond drilling comprised 
four (4) surface holes totalling 139 ft (42.4 m) and 91 underground holes totalling 
10,776 ft (3,284.5 m). From the start of milling on September 15, 1947 until the 
cessation of operations on March 31, 1948, a total of 398.5 ounces of gold and 30 
ounces of silver were produced from 5,623 tons of hoisted ore, for an average grade 
of 0.07 oz/t Au. At the time operations were suspended, it was estimated that about 
12,000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0.37 oz/t Au, remained in the mine (Pye, 
1951). These "reserves" are historical in nature and should not be relied upon. It is 
unlikely they conform to current NI 43-101 criteria or to CIM Standards and 
Definitions, and they have not been verified to determine their relevance or reliability. 
They are included in this section for illustrative purposes only and should not be 
disclosed out of context. 
 
In 1968, some geophysical work was carried out by Tombill Mines Ltd. 
 
The geology of the mine consists of greywackes with interbeds of iron formation 
intruded by a diorite mass, folded into a westerly-plunging anticline (Pye, 1951). A 
felsic intrusive occurs as a sill-like mass on the south limb. Two steeply dipping 
diabase dykes up to 30 m wide cross the anticline in a northerly direction. Shear 
zones striking N060° to N080° and dipping 45° near the diorite-greywacke contact 
contain quartz lenses averaging less than 30 cm thick. The main sulphides are pyrite 
and arsenopyrite.

 Little Long Lac Mine (Past Producer) 

This description was mostly taken from Ferguson et al. (1971) except where noted.  
The past producing Little Long Lac mine is located in the southeastern part of 
Errington Township, extending eastwards into Ashmore Township and surrounding 
most of Kenogamisis Lake. The Little Long Lac mine is located about 2 km south of 
the Town of Geraldton (Fig. 23.1).  
 
Between 1933 and 1953, a shaft was sunk to a depth of 2,318 ft (706.5 m) with 
levels at 200 ft (61.0 m), 300 ft (91.4 m), 445 ft (135.6 m), 570 ft (173.7 m), 695 ft 
(211.8 m), 850 ft (259.1 m), 1,000 ft (304.8 m), 1,152 ft (351.1 m), 1,300 ft (396.2 m), 
1,450 ft (442.0 m), 1,600 ft (487.7 m), 1,750 ft (533.4 m), 1,900 ft (579.1 m), 2,050 ft 
(624.8 m) and 2,200 ft (670.6 m). From level 2,200, a winze was sunk to a depth of 
3,952 ft (1204.6 m), with levels at 2,405 ft (733.0 m), 2,558 ft (779.7 m), 2,711 ft 
(826.3 m), 2,864 ft (872.9 m), 3,013 ft (918.4 m), 3,159 ft (962.9 m), 3,309 ft 
(1,008.6 m), 3,459 ft (1,054.3 m), 3,609 ft (1,100.0 m), 3,759 ft (1,145.7 m) and 
3,920 ft (1,194.8 m). Drifting totalled 37,370 ft (11,390.4 m) and crosscutting 
10,596 ft (3,229.7 m). Diamond drilling from surface totalled 105,626 ft (32,194.8m) 
and underground drilling totalled 101,558 ft (30,954.9 m). A 150-ton mill was 
installed, and a small mill for scheelite production was added later. The work was 
done by Little Long Lac Gold Mines Ltd. 
 
From 1934 to 1954 and in 1956, a total of 605,409 ounces of gold and 52,750 
ounces of silver were produced from 1,780,516 tons of hoisted ore. Average gold 
recovery was 0.34 ounces per ton of ore milled. 
 
Between 1967 and 1968, Little Long Lac Gold Mines Ltd drilled a total of 5,000 ft 
(1,524 m) to test the iron formation. 
 
The geology of the mine consists of arenaceous metasediments with interbeds of 
iron formation and some mafic intrusives that have been folded into a synclinal 
structure striking N272° (Pye, 1951). The orebodies occur in fracture zones in 
massive quartz greywacke on the drag-folded north limb of the syncline. The Main 
vein zone is 3 to 4 ft wide (0.9 to 1.2 m), strikes approximately N075°, dips 80°, and 
consists of two parallel veins 2 to 6 inches wide (5 to 15 cm). Some ore was also 
extracted from the lower grade 09 vein zone located about 600 ft (183 m) to the 
south of the Main zone; this zone is about 2 ft wide (60 cm), strikes N065°, dips 85°, 
and contains scheelite which was recovered during the war. The metallic 
constituents of quartz veins, which rarely make up more than 2 or 3% of the ore, 
include arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena and gold. 
 

 Magnet Consolidated Mine (Past Producer) 

This description was mostly taken from Ferguson et al. (1971) except where noted.  
 
The past producing Magnet Consolidated mine is located in the southwest part of 
Errington Township, about 8 km southwest of the Town of Geraldton (Fig. 23.1).  
 
The discovery of native gold on a small island in the southern part of Magnet Lake in 
1931 initiated an intensive search for gold in the area. Between 1934 and 1936, 
trenching was performed by Magnet Lake Gold Mines and 24,641 ft of diamond 
drilling were carried out by Wells Longlac Mines Ltd. Drilling uncovered three 
mineralized zones, two of which, now known as the Magnet and Wells vein zones,

showed considerable promise. In order to explore these zones jointly underground, 
the two companies amalgamated in 1936 to form the present Magnet Consolidated 
Mines Limited. 
 
Between 1936 and 1940, a shaft was sunk to a depth of 1,115 ft (339.9m) with levels 
at 203 ft (61.9m), 328 ft (100.0m), 480 ft (146.3m), 630 ft (192.0m), 780 ft (237.7m), 
930 ft (283.5m) and 1,080 ft (329.2m) on which 11,181 ft (3,408.0m) of drifting and 
1,943 ft (592.2m) of crosscutting was done. A total of 13 underground diamond drill 
holes totalling 1,665 ft (507.5m) were completed. A 100-ton amalgamation-floatation 
mill was built. 
 
Between 1940 and 1952, the shaft was continued to a depth of 1,772 ft (540.1m), 
with additional levels at 1,230 ft (374.9m), 1,380 ft (420.6m), 1,555 ft (474.0m) and 
1,730 ft (527.3m). An inclined winze 228 ft long (69.5m) constructed between levels 
9, 10 and 11. A winze was sunk 931 ft (283.8m) from the 1,730-ft level to a total 
depth of 2,640 ft (804.7m) with levels at 1,884 ft (574.2m), 2,037 ft (620.9m), 2,160 ft 
(658.4m), 2,312 ft (704.7m), 2,460 ft (749.8m) and 2,610 ft (795.5m). Drifting totalled 
19,585 ft (5,969.5m) and crosscutting 2,944 ft (897.3m). The company drilled seven 
(7) surface diamond drill holes for a total of 4,029 ft (1,228.0m) and 265 underground 
holes for a total of 43,054 ft (113,122.9m).  
 
From 1938 to 1943 and from 1946 to 1952, 152,089 ounces of gold and 16,879 
ounces of silver were produced from 359,912 tons of hoisted ore. Average gold 
recovery was 0.42 ounces per ton of ore milled. 
 
The geology of the mine consists of metasediments, mostly greywacke with 
interbeds of iron formation and conglomerate, striking N290° and dipping 75° to 80°. 
Intrusives consist of dykes and sill-like masses of diorite and porphyry, and younger 
diabase dykes cutting across the formations (Pye, 1951). The two orebodies, raking 
N300° to N315°, consist of lenticular quartz veins and accompanying veinlets 
predominantly in sheared greywacke. The Magnet vein zone, with an average strike 
of N285° and a near-vertical dip, was developed over a maximum length of about 
1,300 ft (396.2m). The leaner North zone, 50 to 100 ft (15.2m to 30.5m) to the north, 
strikes N280° and dips vertically to steeply north. The orebodies at the Magnet mine 
consist chiefly of quartz with small amounts of carbonate and subordinate sulphides. 
The metallic constituents, which seldom constitute more than 5% of the ore, are (in 
order of paragenesis): arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, 
galena and gold. 
 

 Bankfield Mine (Past Producer) 

This description was mostly taken from Ferguson et al. (1971) except where noted.  
The past producing Bankfield mine is located in the west-central part of the Errington 
Township, extending into Lindsley Township and enclosing the southwest part of 
Magnet Lake. This historical mine is situated about 10 km west-southwest of the 
Town of Geraldton (Fig. 23.1).  
 
The property was originally staked in October 1931 by T. A. Johnson and Robert 
Wells when they discovered gold-bearing quartz occupying a shear zone cutting a 
small reef in the southern part of Magnet Lake. Subsequent to this discovery, a 
mineralized zone was found by surface exploration about 1,000 ft (304.8m)

southwest of the lake. Surface-trenching and diamond drilling indicated sufficient 
material of ore grade to merit development by underground methods. 
 
Between 1934 and 1936, a shaft was sunk to a depth of 552 ft (168.2m) with levels 
at 150 ft (45.7m), 275 ft (83.8m) and 525 ft (160.0m). Drifting totalled 2,468 ft 
(752.2m) and crosscutting 781 ft (240.6m). Underground diamond drilling totalled 
1,416 ft (431.6m) and on surface 2,237 ft (431.6m) during this period. Work was 
performed by Bankfield Gold Mines Ltd. 
 
Between 1935 and 1942, a winze (located in Lindsley Township) was sunk from the 
525-ft level to a depth of 1,297 ft (395.3m) from the surface, levels at 779 (237.4m), 
900 (274.3m), 1,025 (312.4m), 1,150 (350.5m) and 1,275 ft (388.6m). Sub-levels 
were established from 275-, 400-, 1,025- and 1,150-ft levels. Drifting totalled 
14,516 ft (4,424.5m) and crosscutting 7,832 ft (2,387.2m). Diamond drilling included 
132 underground holes totalling 21,628 ft (6,592.2m), six (6) surface holes totalling 
2,328 ft (709.6m) and 10,145 ft (3,092.2m) of unspecified drilling. A 100-ton cyanide 
mill was constructed. The work was performed by Bankfield Consolidated Mines Ltd. 
 
From 1937 to 1942 and from 1944 to 1947, a total of 66,417 ounces of gold and 
7,590 ounces of silver were produced from 231,009 tons of hoisted ore. Average 
gold recovery was 0.29 ounces per ton of ore milled. 
 
The geology of the mine consists of greywacke with bands of conglomerate, slate 
and iron formation striking N290° to 300° and dipping 75° to 80° (Pye, 1951). They 
have been intruded by diorite and quartz porphyry, and ultimately by a 200-ft 
(61.0 m) wide diabase dyke which runs parallel to a strike fault near the mine 
workings. The main ore horizon, consisting of a sheared, brecciated and highly 
silicified zone, occurs near a contact between the sediments and a porphyry-diorite 
mass. It strikes N275° to N288°, dips 70° to 78°, has an average width of 7 ft (2.1m) 
and is, including its extension into the adjacent Tombill property, 2,000 ft long 
(609.6m). The orebodies at the Bankfield mine consisted mainly of sheared and 
silicified greywacke and porphyry, mineralized with sulphides and small amounts of 
gold, and cut by numerous "opalescent" grey quartz veins. The reported metallic 
minerals were arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena and 
ilmenite. 
 

 Tombill Mine (Past Producer) 

This description was mostly taken from Ferguson et al. (1971) except where noted.  
 
The past producing Tombill mine is located in the east-central part of Lindsley 
Township, about 10 km west-southwest of the Town of Geraldton (Fig. 23.1.1).  
 
Between 1935 and 1942, a shaft was sunk to a depth of 630 ft (192.0 m), with levels 
at 215 ft (65.5 m), 400 ft (121.9 m) and 600 ft (182.9 m) on which 3,762 ft 
(1,146.7 m) of drifting and 4,442 ft (135.9m) of crosscutting was done. Diamond 
drilling comprised more than twelve (12) surface holes totalling 15,570 ft (4,745.7 m) 
and 63 underground holes totalling 4,406 ft (1,342.9 m). A mill with a 100-ton 
capacity was erected, and was later increased to 150 tons. All work was carried out 
by Tombill Gold Mines Ltd. In 1940, an agreement was reached allowing Bankfield 
Consolidated Mines Ltd to explore and develop a block below the 500-ft level.

From 1938 to 1942 and in 1955 (mill clean-up), a total of 69,120 ounces of gold and 
8,595 ounces of silver were produced from 190,622 tons of hoisted ore. Average 
gold recovery was 0.36 ounces per ton of ore milled. 
 
The geology of the mine consists of metasediments and felsic intrusives along a 
sheared and fractured contact where ore zones developed. Associated minerals are 
pyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. 
 

 Gold Potential of the Other Historical Mines 

InnovExplo has been unable to verify the above information on historical gold mines 
near the Hardrock deposit. The presence of significant mineralization on these 
adjacent historical mines is not necessarily indicative of similar mineralization on the 
Hardrock deposit.

25. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 OBJECTIVE OF THE TECHNICAL REPORT 

The objective of InnovExplo's assignment is to provide a technical report for 
Centerra and Premier Gold following the disclosure of the Limited Partnership for the 
exploration, development and operation of the Trans-Canada Property, published on 
February 5, 2015. 

 
 2014 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  

In 2014, the objective of InnovExplo's assignment was to prepare an updated 
mineral resource estimate for the Hardrock deposit using recent diamond drill holes 
and an updated litho-structural model, covering the area of the past producing Hard 
Rock, MacLeod-Cockshutt and Mosher mines (Brousseau et al., 2014). The PEA 
study, released in March 2014, was included in this report for reference purposes; 
the PEA was based on InnovExplo's previous mineral resource estimate. 
 
The PEA concluded that an open pit mining scenario for the Hardrock deposit 
demonstrates potential viability, but that the mineral potential of the Hardrock deposit 
needed to be improved by definition diamond drilling programs in order to convert in-
pit inferred resources to the indicated category or better. 
 
Following the recommendations of the PEA, Premier Gold completed 86,500 m of 
definition drilling in 184 DDH on the Hardrock deposit. A resampling program of 
holes drilled by previous companies was also added to the database. 
 
Using all available geological and analytical information, a litho-structural model of 
the Hardrock deposit was created by InnovExplo and updated by Premier Gold. The 
following summarizes the methodology used to create the mineralized zone 
wireframe model: 
 

 The updated litho-structural model was used as the basis for defining 
mineralized zones; 

 Fifteen (15) mineralized zones defined by lithology were subdivided into 
eighty-six (86) sub-units based on the fold geometry of each zone (separating 
hinges from limbs); 

 A remaining undifferentiated envelope containing isolated gold intercepts was 
created; and  

 The interpolation of the mineralized material zones was constrained by the 
subunit wireframes. 

 
After conducting a detailed review of all pertinent information and completing the 
2014 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo concludes the following: 
 

 The geological and grade continuities of the fifteen (15) gold-bearing zones of 
the Hardrock deposit were demonstrated. 

 The additional infill drilling provided sufficient information to update the 
previous (2013) mineral resource estimate.  

 The estimate of overall Indicated Resources now stands at 4.87 Moz and 
total Inferred Resources at 2.74 Moz. The In-Pit Indicated Resources have 
increased to 3.97 Moz. 



 
 www.innovexplo.com 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  443	

 The overall 2014 Indicated Resources represent a 50% increase in ounces 
compared to the 2013 estimate. The 2014 Inferred Resources represent a 
27% decrease in total ounces compared to the 2013 estimate.  

 The new estimate includes a deeper and steeper pit when compared to the 
previous estimate. 

 Not all of the Inferred Resources were converted into Indicated Resources in 
the pit area, so this could have an impact on any future economic study. 

 The potential is high for upgrading Inferred Resources to Indicated 
Resources with more diamond drilling in multiples zones.  

 There is also a potential to upgrade Indicated Resources to In-Pit Measured 
Resources with detailed geological mapping, infill drilling and systematic 
surface channel sampling. 

 
Table 25.1.1 identifies any important internal risks, potential impacts and possible 
risk mitigation measures that could affect the economic outcome of the project. This 
excludes the external risks that apply to all mining projects (e.g., changes in metal 
prices, exchange rates, availability of investment capital, change in government 
regulations, etc.). Significant opportunities that could improve the economics, timing 
and permitting of the project are also identified in this table. Further information and 
evaluation is required before these opportunities can be included in the project 
economics. Some of the following risks and opportunities that were also outlined in 
the PEA must still be considered. 
 
InnovExplo concludes that the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate presented herein 
allows the Hardrock deposit to advance to the feasibility study stage for which the 
potential viability of an open-pit project has been demonstrated by the March 2104 
PEA.  
 
InnovExplo considers the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate to be reliable, thorough, 
based on quality data, reasonable hypotheses, and parameters prepared in 
accordance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards regarding mineral resource 
estimations.

26. RECOMMENDATIONS 

The following recommendations are taken directly from the report titled "Technical 
Report and Mineral Resource Estimate update for the Hardrock deposit (according to 
National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1)", dated August 22, 2014 and 
prepared by InnovExplo Inc. (Brousseau et al., 2014). Some of these 
recommendations were completed since last 2014 technical report or are still 
underway at the time of the herein report. 
 
Based on the results of the 2014 Mineral Resource Estimate, InnovExplo 
recommends that the Hardrock deposit be advanced to the next phase, which would 
be the preparation of a feasibility study and environmental test work. The 
environmental work should include baseline studies in preparation for permitting, and 
to validate assumptions made for water treatment facilities. 
 
Further definition drilling is also recommended to upgrade Inferred resources to the 
Indicated category and to more accurately assess the potential of all zones in the 
2014 Whittle shell. The drilling is currently underway. 
 
The ongoing outcrop mapping, stripping and channel sampling work should be 
completed and the results can be used to verify and establish the structural and 
grade continuity in the proposed pit area. This work will also provide the data needed 
to confirm the dilution factors and convert Indicated Resources to In-Pit Measured 
Resources. This recommendation was completed in 2014. 
 
InnovExplo recommends generating a more precise 3D model of the remaining 
historical openings, which would have a positive impact on handling any 
mineralization adjacent to the voids created by historical mining. This 
recommendation is currently underway. 
 
The definition drilling and outcrop mapping program results should be used to update 
the litho-structural model. The creation of more constrained wireframes for some of 
the mineralized zones is also recommended to optimize the grade interpolation. 
 
The recommended feasibility study should be based on an updated mineral resource 
estimate that includes future diamond drill holes, channel samples and updated 3D 
models of voids and mineralized zones. 
 
For the purpose of verification and training, an RC and production blast hole drilling 
program is recommended in the proposed pit area. This program could improve the 
penetration rate, cost and rig performance, verify the analysis and sampling 
protocols, and serve to train personal on RC and blast hole drilling. It could also be 
used to develop grade control procedures and convert Indicated Resources to In-Pit 
Measured Resources as well. 
 
In summary, InnovExplo recommended in 2014 a two-phase work for the geological 
program as follows: 
 

 Phase 1 

o Definition drilling to upgrade Inferred resources to an Indicated 
category in the proposed pit area (Drilling is underway);

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  446	

o Mapping, stripping and channel sampling (This was completed in 
2014); 

o 3D model update, including the litho-structural and void models  (3D 
model update is underway); 

o Update of the current mineral resource estimate to include future DDH 
and 3D model updates. 

 Phase 2 

o RC and production blast hole drilling program 
o Additional mapping and stripping (2015) 

 
In 2014, InnovExplo prepared a cost estimate for the recommended two-phase 
geological work program to serve as a guideline for the project. The budget for the 
proposed program is presented in Table 26.1.1. 
 
The estimated cost for Phase 1 would amount to approximately $6.6M and would 
include definition drilling, the completion of the ongoing mapping program, 3D model 
updates and an update of the current mineral resource estimate.  The estimated cost 
for Phase 2, which would include the RC and production blast hole drilling program 
and additional mapping and stripping, is approximately $2.8M.  
 
The estimated budget for the feasibility study is $15M in expenditures for 2014 and 
2015, including the implementation of a community relation strategy.

APPENDIX III – IN-PIT MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
PER ZONE 

 



 
 

 

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  498	

 
 

 The Independent and Qualified Persons for the Mineral Resource Estimate, as defined by NI 43-101, are Carl 
Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo. and Karine Brousseau, P.Eng., of InnovExplo Inc, and the effective date of the estimate is 
July 4, 2014. 

 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
 In-pit results are presented undiluted within a Whittle-optimized pit shell, designed with a 30-m buffer around 

lakes. 
 The estimate includes 15 gold-bearing zones and a remaining undifferentiated envelope. 
 In-pit resources were compiled at cut-off grades of 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.90 g/t Au. The official 

in-pit resource is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.50 g/t Au. 
 Cut-off grades must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (gold price, exchange rate and mining 

cost). 
 Density (g/cm3) data used is on a per zone basis (envelope: 2.76, porphyry: 2.74, S4_1: 2.77, S4_2: 2.76, S4_3: 

2.76, IF_N_1: 3.00, IF_N_2: 2.83, IF_N_3: 2.84, I0: 2.90, IF_HL: 2.87, IF_HU: 2.76, Tenacity: 2.86, F-Zone: 2.76, 
Central: 2.75, I1_1: 2.77, I1_2: 2.77) 

 A minimum true thickness of 3.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed, or a value 
of zero when not assayed. 

 High grade capping (g/t Au) was done on raw assay data and established on a per zone basis (envelope: 70, 
porphyry: 70, S4_1: 20, S4_2: 20, S4_3: 20, IF_N_1: 40, IF_N_2: 40, IF_N_3: 40, I0: 2.5, IF_HL: 50, IF_HU: 50, 
Tenacity: 70, F-Zone: 70, Central: 70, I1_1: 70, I1_2: 70) 

 Compositing was done on drill hole sections falling within the mineralized zones (composite = 1.5 m). 
 Resources were evaluated from drill hole using a 2-pass ID2 interpolation method in a block model (block size = 

10 m x 5 m x 10 m). 
 The inferred category is only defined within the areas where blocks were interpolated during pass 1 or pass 2. 
 The indicated category is only defined in areas where the maximum distance to drill hole composites is less than 

35m for blocks interpolated in pass 1. 
 Ounce (troy) = metric tonnes x grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). 
 The number of metric tonnes was rounded to the nearest hundred. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to 

rounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 
 InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, 

marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate. 
 Whittle parameters (all amounts in Canadian dollars): reference mining cost of $1.62; incremental bench cost 23 
 ($/10m bench) of $0.032; milling cost of $10.86/t; 3% royalty; G&A cost of $1.22/t; rehandling cost of $0.10/t, 

sustaining capital of $0.50/t; gold price of $1,339/oz; shell selection at revenue factor of 0.711 ($953/oz); mining 
recovery of 95%; mining dilution of 5% at 0 g/t; milling recovery of 90%; and pit slope of 55°.

43-101 Technical Report on the Trans-Canada Property  500	

 
 The Independent and Qualified Persons for the Mineral Resource Estimate, as defined by NI 43-101, are Carl 

Pelletier, B.Sc., P.Geo. and Karine Brousseau, P.Eng., of InnovExplo Inc., and the effective date of the estimate is 
July 4, 2014. 

 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
 Underground results are presented undiluted outside a Whittle-optimized pit shell, designed with a 30-m buffer around 

lakes. 
 The estimate includes 15 gold-bearing zones and a remaining undifferentiated envelope. 
 Underground resources were compiled at 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00 and 4.50 g/t Au cut-off grades. The official 

Underground resource is reported at 3.00 g/t Au cut-off grade. 
 Cut-off grades must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (gold price, exchange rate and mining 

cost). 
 Density (g/cm3) data used is on a per zone basis (envelope: 2.76, porphyry: 2.74, S4_1: 2.77, S4_2: 2.76, S4_3: 2.76, 

IF_N_1: 3.00, IF_N_2: 2.83, IF_N_3: 2.84, I0: 2.90, IF_HL: 2.87, IF_HU: 2.76, Tenacity: 2.86, F-Zone: 2.76, Central: 
2.75, I1_1: 2.77, I1_2: 2.77) 

 A minimum true thickness of 3.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed, or a value of 
zero when not assayed. 

 High grade capping (g/t Au) was done on raw assay data and established on a per zone basis (envelope: 70, 
porphyry: 70, S4_1: 20, S4_2: 20, S4_3: 20, IF_N_1: 40, IF_N_2: 40, IF_N_3: 40, I0: 2.5, IF_HL: 50, IF_HU: 50, 
Tenacity: 70, F-Zone: 70, Central: 70, I1_1: 70, I1_2: 70) 

 Compositing was done on drill hole sections falling within the mineralized zones (composite = 1.5 m). 
 Resources were evaluated from drill hole using a 2-pass ID2 interpolation method in a block model (block size = 10 m 

x 5 m x 10 m). 
 The inferred category is only defined within the areas where blocks were interpolated during pass 1 or pass 2. 
 The indicated category is only defined in areas where the maximum distance to drill hole composites is less than 35m 

for blocks interpolated in pass 1. 
 Ounce (troy) = metric tonnes x grade / 31.10348. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). 
 The number of metric tonnes was rounded to the nearest hundred. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding 

effects; rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 
 InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing 

or other relevant issue that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate. 
 Whittle parameters (all amounts in Canadian dollars): reference mining cost of $1.62; incremental bench cost ($/10m 

bench) of $0.032; milling cost of $10.86/t; 3% royalty; G&A cost of $1.22/t; rehandling cost of $0.10/t, sustaining 
capital of $0.50/t; gold price of $1,339/oz; shell selection at revenue factor of 0.711 ($953/oz); mining recovery of 
95%; mining dilution of 5% at 0 g/t; milling recovery of 90%; and pit slope of 55°.
