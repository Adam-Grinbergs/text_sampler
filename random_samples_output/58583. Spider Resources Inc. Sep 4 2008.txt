1 SUMMARY 
 
Spider Resources Inc. (Spider) and KWG Resources Inc. jointly hold the mineral rights to two claim 
blocks totaling 141 staked claims and comprising 2140 claim units (nominally 32,224 ha) in the Lake 
McFaulds area of the James Bay Lowlands, Porcupine Mining Division, north central Ontario.. The two 
companies first became active in the general area (commonly referred to as Spider #3) in the mid 1990's 
in search of diamond deposits. The property lies within NTS areas 43 D/13, 43 D/09 & 10 and 43 
D/16.The properties (figure 2) comprise two groups of staked claim blocks; the McFaulds East comprising 
78 claims and McFaulds West comprising 63 claims. The property is bounded between 52º 440" N and 
53º 10" N and 85º 45" W and 86º45" W. 
This updated technical report evaluates the McFaulds Lake property in accordance with the guidelines of 
National Instrument 43-101. The report is to be used by Spider, KWG and UC Resources Ltd. in 
conjunction with filings of Annual Information Forms (AIF), and may also be used to satisfy other 
regulatory requirements or financings. 

March 07, 2007 – Toronto, Ontario – Spider Resources Inc. ("Spider") (TSXV: SPQ) and UC 
Resources Limited ("UC") (TSXV: UC) announce the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI), regarding a 
four year exploration program on the McFaulds Lake volcanic-hosted massive sulphide ("VMS") project, 
located in northern Ontario in the James Bay Lowlands, held by Spider and its joint venture partner, KWG 
Resources Inc.. This LOI confirms the terms and conditions on which UC, will have an option to earn-
in(by spending $4.5 million) to an up to 55% undivided interest in the McFaulds Lake project, which is 
currently owned, as to an undivided 50% interest, by each of Spider and KWG. 

The UC Option: Subject to the terms and conditions set out in the LOI, UC shall be the operator of the 
property during the term of the option and shall have the option to earn up to a 55% undivided interest in 
the Property as follows: 

1. On or prior to the first anniversary date of the signing of the agreement, UC shall incur 
exploration expenditures, of at least $1 million on the Property in order to earn a 10% vested 
interest in the Property;  

2. If UC gives notice to Spider of its intent to continue the option for a second year, it shall be 
required to incur exploration expenditures of at least an additional $1 million on or before the 
second anniversary date in order to earn an additional 15% vested interest in the Property, 
bringing UC's interest level to 25%;  

3. On or prior to the second anniversary date hereof, UC shall give notice to Spider of its intent to 
continue the option for a third year, in which case it shall be required to incur exploration 
expenditures of at least an additional $1.25 million on or before the third anniversary date hereof 
in order to earn an additional 15% vested interest in the Property bringing the UC interest level to 
40%;  

4. On or prior to the third anniversary date, UC shall give notice to Spider of its intent to continue 
the option for a fourth year, in which case it shall be required to incur exploration expenditures of 
at least an additional $1.25 million on or before the fourth anniversary date in order to earn an 
additional 15% vested interest in the Property bringing the UC interest level to 55%. 

In the event that UC fails to give notice of its intent to continue the option as required by any of the earn-
in stages, UC shall be deemed to have elected not to continue with the option, and shall have earned the 
corresponding interest to the level of investment contemplated in the completed stage, provided however, 
that no partial interest shall be earned in respect of any requirement for expenditure in any of the stages, 
that has not been met in its entirety, within the required time period, and more particularly: 

 4



1. If UC does not expend at least $1 million in accordance with the initial stage, it shall be deemed to 
have earned no interest in the Property;  

2. If UC earns a 10% interest, and elects not to proceed with the option, it's interest maybe 
repurchased by Spider (66%) and KWG (33%) for an amount to be agreed by the parties, acting 
reasonably, other wise the parties shall immediately enter into a formal joint venture agreement, 
which shall provide, among other things, that Spider shall be entitled to contribute such further 
amounts as may be required to take its interest relative only to KWG, up to 66%, prior to KWG 
being entitled to contribute amounts to the joint venture, and otherwise shall contain standard 
provisions commonly found in joint venture agreements in the industry.  

The McFaulds Lake VMS project was initially discovered in 2002, while Spider, KWG and De Beers 
Canada Exploration Inc. in joint venture were exploring the project area for kimberlites. De Beers holds a 
1.5% net smelter royalty on the project, 0.5% of which can be purchased from De Beers by Spider and 
KWG for $1.5 million. To date, 10 isolated VMS occurrences have been identified and drill tested on the 
project, two of which have undergone detail drilling. UC plans to continue exploring this new VMS camp. 
Immediate plans involve the completion of deep exploration geophysics on McFaulds #3 and #1 to 
identify drill targets below and in the vicinity of these two partially drilled off VMS (copper and zinc) 
occurrences. 

The McFaulds Lake claim blocks are located approximately 580 km NW from the city of Timmins, 
Ontario and 530 km NNE of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Access is limited to float equipped aircraft 
during the summer and ski-equipped aircraft during the winter. The McFaulds camp is supplied from 
Nakina about 185km to the south. 

The James Bay Lowland describes an east-northeast sloping (~0.7 m/km), essentially planar region whose 
coastline is rebounding at ~1 m / 100 years.  The major rivers, Albany, Attawapiskat and Ekwan, drain 
vast area extending almost 700 km west and 350 km to the south.  Those portions flowing over the 
Lowland are broad, shallow and rocky.  The rivers reach flood stage in May and early June, and then 
water levels drop through the summer and into winter. 

Effective access is by fixed wing aircraft to the larger lakes and potentially to prepared winter strips 
elsewhere.  Skidoos provide local mobility during the winter months (November to March); however, 
helicopter support is essential for programs beyond initial ground geophysical surveys.   

Nakina, ~300 km to the south, is the closest all-weather road head. Daily passenger flights and intermittent 
cargo flights serve the First Nations communities at Webequie (90 km west) and Ogoki Post / Marten 
Falls (~130 km south).  These two communities may also be connected to the winter road system, which 
has been unreliable in recent years (Burns 2004).    

The James Bay Lowland is covered by a pair of tills and proglacial sediments, capped by soft, thixotropic 
marine clays.  Paleozoic outcrop and subcrop is comparatively common along major and secondary rivers 
suggesting an undulating bedrock surface. 

The property lies near the western margin of the Hudson Bay Paleozoic Platform, an essentially flat-lying 
succession of Silurian to Ordovician carbonates with minor clastics. In the Attawapiskat and Kyle areas, 
about 100 km to the east these rocks reach thicknesses of up to 200 m.   

Interpretation of magnetic and gravity data (Stott), confirmed by drilling, shows that the Archean Superior 
Province extends eastwards towards James Bay. Drilling has returned both well differentiated volcanic 
sequences (e.g., McFaulds Lake area) which within the Segeucho Greenstone Belt and granitic gneisses 
elsewhere.

The Quaternary sequence encountered in the diamond drill holes generally consists of 1 - 2 m of sandy 
(Wisconsin) till overlain by sand proximal (varves?) grading upwards into clays (distal varves ?) and 
marine clays.  The complete section ranges from 3.5 to 74.4 m in thickness, with the thickest section 
occurring in the central part of the area. 

The structure of the region is quite complex. It lies totally within the Superior Archon. The Trans-Hudson 
Belt Orogen follows a general east-southeast trend from the Nelson River area in Manitoba, to the Sutton 
Ridges, to the north of the Ekwan River, from whence it turns sharply northward toward the Cape Smith 
Fold Belt on the Ungava Peninsula of Quebec. 

During the Summer/Fall 2004 field season and the Winter 2005 field season most of the drilling was 
concentrated on exploring the McFaulds#3 VMS deposit with more limited exploration done at McFaulds 
#5, #6 and #1. A geophysical Max-Min anomaly located on grid "D" was tested by a single angled core 
drill hole . Several key drill holes at the McFaulds #3 and #1 VMS deposits were geophysically surveyed 
(Down-the-Hole EM/IP) in order to locate the best areas to enlarge the massive sulphide reserves. A total 
of 11 drill holes totaling 3319 m was completed at McFaulds #3 deposit, 4 drill holes totaling 1167 m was 
completed testing geophysical magnetic and Max-Min anomalies at McFaulds #5 and #6 and 255 m to test 
a conductor located at grid "D". This field season ended on a "high note" with MCF-04-57 returning an 
assay of 8% copper over 18 m. 
 
During the Winter 2005 field season 8 more drill holes (3115 m) were completed at McFaulds #3 to test 
the downward extension of the mineralization. In addition, one (1) drill hole (391.5 m) was put down at 
the McFaulds #1 VSM deposit to test the known mineralization at depth and an indicated geophysical 
conductor identified during a Down-the-Hole EM/IP survey (Conducted by JVX  2005). Concurrent with 
the drilling an extensive VTEM airborne survey was conducted by Geotech Limited (2005) and additional 
Down-the-Hole, magnetic and gravity surveys were completed by JVX Geophysical Surveys Ltd. The 
VTEM airborne survey conducted by covered the Western Claim Block and parts of the Eastern Claim 
Block. Numerous magnetic/VTEM anomalies were located in the West Claim Block and the best were 
chosen for further exploration work. To facilitate the detailed exploration seven (7) grids were cut. Most 
of the grids were covered by a MAX-MIN and ground magnetic/VLF surveys. The rapid spring breakup 
required the geophysical crews to demobilize before the work was completed. About 15-20% of the work 
remained to be done. One drill hole (129 m) tested a geophysical target on grid "K" and intersected 18m 
of sulphide/magnetite mineralization similar to that encountered at McFaulds #1 to McFaulds #7 VMS 
type deposits. The newly discovered geophysical magnetic and VTEM airborne anomalies suggest the 
area has potential for a large VMS type deposit.  
Approximately $1,2 million budget is planned for the summer/fall 2008 exploration work on the 
Spider/KWG McFaulds Lake Property. At least three drill holes were planned to test the best geophysical 
anomalies located in the West Claim Block. It is also planned to do a limited amount of ground 
geophysical surveys and systematic re-logging of the older drill core from McFaulds #3 and #1. 
 
In 2006 Spider drilled four drill holes to test MAX-MIN geophysical anomalies located on grids C, N and 
L located in the West Claim Block (Novak 2006). One deep hole was drill to test a gravity anomaly at 
Grid C interpreted to be under McFaulds #3. No significant sulphide mineralization was intersected but a 
thin mineralized horizon was identified at depth. Two EM conductors were tested by diamond drill holes 
in Grid L. Only minor intersections of pyrite and pyrrhotite were identified. The single angled hole drill on 
Grid N did not explain the EM or magnetic anomaly. 
Three drill holes were put down on claims (P-3008793, 3008267 and 269) held by Freewest Resources 
Ltd. Under terms of a Spider and Freewest Joint Venture agreement Spider could acquire an interest in 
their property by spending at least $350,000 to get a 40% interest.  The results from two holes drilled on 
Grid H where negative. However, a drill hole testing a magnetic and weak EM anomaly on Grid J 
intersected two massive bands (1.05m and 0.85m) that graded 20% to 23% Cr and ranged from 0.4 g/t to 

 6



0.75 g/t Pt-Pd. This was the first time massive chromite with chrome, platinum, palladium, rhodium and 
ruthenium, as well as anomalous nickel was discovered in the McFaulds Project Area.  
 
In the summer of 2007 Spider/KWG/UC Resources conducted a seven hole drill program at McFaulds #3 
VMS deposit to do some fill-in drilling for resource purposes and to test a deep seated gravity anomaly. A 
total of 2354 meters of core was drilled.. The project was completed in late August 
A summary of the results of two infilling drill holes FW-07-75and 76 are as follows: The FW-07-
75 intersected the Mineralized Zone from 164.28-183.30m. The zoned VMS has bands enriched in chalcopyrite 
and another enriched in sphalerite. The average grade over the 19.02m was 2.69% Cu, 4.35% Zn, 0.35 g/t Au 
and 6.65 g/t Ag. FW-07-76 intersected copper-zinc mineralization from 154 to 161.5 meters (7.5m) that 
assayed 1.8% copper, 3.3% zinc 0.22 g/t gold and 7.47% silver..  The upper part of  the zone from 154 to 
159.21 meters (5.21 m) averaged 2.49% copper and the lower part from 157 to 161.5  meters  (4.5m) averaged 
4.6% zinc. These drill holes filled in a gap in the drill pattern and was needed to help determine the grade and 
resources of this deposit. Chartrand et al 1990 gives a good description of VMS deposits of Quebec that are 
similar to the McFaulds VMS deposits. 
FW-07-73, and 74 did not hit any mineralization of economic importance. 
FW-07-77 wondered badly off course and completely missed the target. No significant mineralization was 
found. 
 FW-07-78 intersected the mineralized horizon but the results were not encouraging. Hole designed to undercut 
MCF-04-55 by 75m on L9+50E The Mineralized Zone extends from 474.12-488.8 (14.68m) within which 
occurs a massive to semi-massive section 479.82-482.27 (2.45m) of pyrite, pyrrhotite, magnetite and trace 
chalcopyrite. The Mineralized Zone was intersected about 400 m vertical depth below the surface. The results 
indicate a strongly mineralized zone approximately 15m thick (not true thickness) that could change at depth 
into copper-zinc mineralization 
The gravity anomaly below the main mineralization is still a viable target for additional copper-zinc reserves.  
FW-07-79 was designed to under  cut MCF-05-56 by 75m (on L7+50E) and 25m down dip and to the west of 
MCF-05-59 (7.9%Cu over 8m) and 25m west of 04-29 (4.4% over 2.9m). The hole hit the mineralized Zone at 
360.58-384.55m. The majority of mineralization consists of disseminated and thin bands of massive fine 
grained magnetite. The lower 1.5m had less magnetite and erratic small patches and disseminated pyrite and 
trace chalcopyrite combined < 1%. Locally the pyrite can reach 2-3% near the lower contact. The results were 
disappointing and suggested a drastic reduction in copper-zinc mineralization to the southwest 
 
Since 2002 seventy nine diamond drill holes have been drilled on the McFaulds VMS Property 
discovering ten VMS deposits and prospects. Seven have been identified as McFaulds #1 to 7 with the 
three others not identified by a name. Out of the seventy nine holes 59 were drilled at McFaulds #3 and #1 
with the rest testing MaxMin and VTEM geophysical anomalies in both the East and West claim blocks.  
 
The following conclusions can be made. 
 

•  There is a VMS prospective zone that extends from the eastern edge of the East Claim Block, 
hosting 7 VMS deposits to the West Claim Block and the contiguous Freewest claims. 

• Extensive silicification, potassic (kspar), chlorite and sericite alteration has been observed at all 
VMS targets that have been drilled. This suggests a very large area of alteration usually associated 
with VMS camps found in Canada. 

• The two best VMS targets are McFaulds #3 and #1. 
• The felsic tuffs, agglomerates, flow breccia and alteration make the McFaulds #5 and #6 and 

surrounding area very prospective for hosting a new VMS deposit. 
• The McFaulds Property is prospective for VMS, chromite, gold and diamond (kimberlite Kyle 

Type) deposits.

In August 2007 Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc was retained to determine the copper 
and zinc resources of McFaulds #3 and McFaulds # 1. The resources determined by the company 
can be summarized as follows. 
The following summary of the resource study dated July 10, 2008 is taken directly from the Scott 
Wilson Roscoe Postle MEMO to Spider Resources Inc 
"The preliminary estimates were based on 39 diamond core holes for the McFaulds 3 deposit 
totalling 12,114 metres in length and on 15 diamond core holes for the McFaulds 1 deposit 
totalling 4,715 metres in length. 
 
At a cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu, Indicated resources at the McFaulds 3 deposit are estimated to 
total 802,000 tonnes grading 3.75% Cu and 1.1% Zn.  At the McFaulds 1 deposit, Inferred 
resources are estimated at 279,000 tonnes grading 2.13% Cu and 0.58% Zn. 
 
A set of cross sections and plan views were interpreted for both deposits to construct three-
dimensional wireframe models at a cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu and a minimum true thickness of 
two metres. These criteria reflect a potential underground mining scenario. High copper and zinc 
grades were capped at 12.0% Cu and 8% Zn at McFaulds 3 and at 5% Cu and 7% Zn at 
McFaulds 1 prior to compositing to 1.5 metres. Variogram parameters were interpreted from the 
composited assay values. Block model copper and zinc grades within the wireframe models were 
estimated by ordinary Kriging for the McFaulds 3 deposit and by inverse distance squared for 
the McFaulds 1 deposit.  Classification into the Indicated and Inferred categories was guided by 
the drill hole density, interpreted variogram ranges, the apparent continuity of the mineralized 
zones, and by available density determinations.

The following recommendations for 2008 exploration are made." 
 

• A complete compilation and interpretation of all of the geophysical data acquired to date. 
• Because several geologists have logged the drill core from the McFaulds Property all of 

the core should be re-logged.  
• More drilling must be done at McFaulds #3 and McFaulds #1 and the area between the two VMS 

deposits in order to determine ore reserves compliant with the standards of NI43 101. 
• There is a gravity anomaly indicated at McFaulds #3 and #1 and the area in between. This gravity 

anomaly should be test at a vertical depth of 500m or deeper. 

 8



• Taking into account the new interpretation of the geophysical information it is recommended that 
some of the best as yet undrilled targets be drilled. 

 
Approximately $1.2  million budget is planned for the summer/fall exploration work on the Spider/KWG 
McFaulds Lake Property. At least three drill holes are planned to test the best geophysical anomalies 
located in the West Claim Block and several holes to test the McFaulds #3and #1 VMS deposits below the 
500m vertical level. It is recommended that a systematic re-logging of the older drill core from McFaulds 
#3 and #1 be done. An estimate of the 2008 exploration budget is detailed below.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

4.1 Property Location 
 
The McFaulds Lake Project area is situated on the north end of McFaulds Lake along the northwestern 
edge of the James Bay Lowland of northern Ontario.  The project area is currently bounded by the 
following geographic coordinates; 52º 440" N and 53º 10" N and 85º 45" W and 86º45" W.   The area 
straddles the Attawapiskat drainage basin and into the upper Ekwan drainage. 
 
Spider Resources Inc. (Spider) and KWG Resources Inc. (KWG) jointly hold the mineral rights to 141 
staked (Figure 1) mining claims comprising 2140 claim units (nominally 32,224 ha) in the McFaulds Lake 
area in the James Bay Lowlands of north central Ontario. The two companies first became active in the 
general area (commonly referred to as Spider #3) in the mid 1990's in search of diamond deposits. The 
property lies within NTS areas 43 D/13, 43 D/09 & 10 and 43 D/16.The properties (figure 2) comprise 
two groups of staked claim blocks; the McFaulds East comprising 78 claims (Figure 2) and McFaulds 
West comprising 63 claims (Figure 3).  
The properties were acquired by ground staking pursuant to requirements of the Mining Act R.S.O. 1990, 
Chapter M.14, attached regulations and amendments thereto.  In the James Bay Lowland, claims are 
located relative to airborne magnetic anomalies whose locations are accurate within as little as 10 m.  
Stakers locate one or more corner posts using handheld GPS units with similar accuracies and then blaze 
north-south and east-west lines to form claim boundaries.  Claims are subject to dispute for improper 
staking within a year of recording.  That period has passed for all claims listed below. 

Mining rights are retained by filing assessment expenditures at the rate of $400 per claim unit per year 
from the second anniversary of recording until the claims are taken to lease.  The claims may be taken to 
lease when the claim holder can demonstrate that the property contains a mineral resource.  Further 
development of a property is subject to meeting a variety of environmental and other requirements which 
process is currently managed by the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines. 

The project area lies within James Bay Treaty (Number 9) area (1905 and 1906). Webequie and Ogoki 
Post (Marten Falls) are both Ojibway communities belonging to the Matawa Tribal Council, a grouping of 
11 bands from Hornpayne in the south to Webequie in the north (Figure 4)  First Nations cooperation is 
perquisite for resource development.  Currently Spider meets with community leaders in a variety of 
forums and employs residents in exploration support roles.  More advanced development would require 
memoranda of understanding and ultimately negotiation of benefit agreements.  It is essential that 
exploration be conducted with the goal of ultimate production. 

The Otoskwin-Attawapiskat waterway Provincial Park stretches through the project area.  It comprises the 
Attawapiskat River and a 200 m wide buffer along each side.

4.2 Underlying agreements 

4.2.1 Spider and UC Resources Ltd 

March 07, 2007 – Toronto, Ontario – Spider Resources Inc. ("Spider") (TSXV: SPQ) and UC 
Resources Limited ("UC") (TSXV: UC) announce the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI), 
regarding a four year exploration program on the McFauld's Lake volcanic-hosted massive 
sulphide ("VMS") project, located in northern Ontario in the James Bay Lowlands, held by 
Spider and its joint venture partner, KWG Resources Inc.. This LOI confirms the terms and 
conditions on which UC, will have an option to earn-in to an up to 55% undivided interest in the 
McFauld's Lake project, which is currently owned, as to an undivided 50% interest, by each of 
Spider and KWG "Titan 24 Deep Earth Imaging" survey is offered by Quantec Geoscience.  

The UC Option: Subject to the terms and conditions set out in the LOI, UC shall be the operator 
of the property during the term of the option and shall have the option to earn up to a 55% 
undivided interest in the Property as follows: 

1. On or prior to the first anniversary date of the signing of the agreement, UC shall incur 
exploration expenditures, of at least $1 million on the Property in order to earn a 10% 
vested interest in the Property;  

2. If UC gives notice to Spider of its intent to continue the option for a second year, it shall 
be required to incur exploration expenditures of at least an additional $1 million on or 
before the second anniversary date in order to earn an additional 15% vested interest in 
the Property, bringing UC's interest level to 25%;  

3. On or prior to the second anniversary date hereof, UC shall give notice to Spider of its 
intent to continue the option for a third year, in which case it shall be required to incur 
exploration expenditures of at least an additional $1.25 million on or before the third 
anniversary date hereof in order to earn an additional 15% vested interest in the Property 
bringing the UC interest level to 40%;  

4. On or prior to the third anniversary date, UC shall give notice to Spider of its intent to 
continue the option for a fourth year, in which case it shall be required to incur 
exploration expenditures of at least an additional $1.25 million on or before the fourth 
anniversary date in order to earn an additional 15% vested interest in the Property 
bringing the UC interest level to 55%; See Table 

In the event that UC fails to give notice of its intent to continue the option as required by any of 
the earn-in stages, UC shall be deemed to have elected not to continue with the option, and shall 
have earned the corresponding interest to the level of investment contemplated in the completed 
stage, provided however, that no partial interest shall be earned in respect of any requirement for 
expenditure in any of the stages, that has not been met in its entirety, within the required time 
period, and more particularly: 

1. If UC does not expend at least $1 million in accordance with the initial stage, it shall be 
deemed to have earned no interest in the Property;  

2. If UC earns a 10% interest, and elects not to proceed with the option, it's interest maybe 
repurchased by Spider (66%) and KWG (33%) for an amount to be agreed by the parties, 
acting reasonably, other wise the parties shall immediately enter into a formal joint 

 16



venture agreement, which shall provide, among other things, that Spider shall be entitled 
to contribute such further amounts as may be required to take its interest relative only to 
KWG, up to 66%, prior to KWG being entitled to contribute amounts to the joint venture, 
and otherwise shall contain standard provisions commonly found in joint venture 
agreements in the industry.  

4.2.2 Renforth – Spider-KWG Joint Venture agreement 
In July 2006, Spider, KWG and Renforth formed the Kyle Project Joint Venture.  Renforth gained the 
right to earn a 55% of the Kyle Project by spending $2 millions per year for three years.  Seventy-five 
percent of annual expenditures of at least 75% of $2 million spent on exploration of the Kyle property per 
year starting on June 30th 2007 and ending on June 30th 2009 within a three year period. In addition, as 
part of the agreement, Renforth will put in to the new agreement 39 unexplored geophysical kimberlite 
targets and Spider/KWG will own a 45% interest in the Wycliffe Claims on or before June 30th 2009. 
Spider will be the operator of the joint venture exploration. 

4.2.3 Spider – KWG Agreement 
In May 2006, Spider and KWG agreed to unwind their long-lived James Bay Lowland joint venture.  
Broadly, properties were divided ⅓/⅔ between the partners allowing the majority holder to develop their 
projects.  The minority holder may elect to fund future programmes proportionally or to have their interest 
diluted.  

Spider gained majority ownership of the five Kyle kimberlites, the McFaulds volcanogenic massive 
sulphide and associated properties.  KWG acquired majority interest in the MacFayden kimberlites 
situated a little to the north of the Victor Mine. 

4.2.4 Ashton Mining Canada Ltd. Back-in agreement 
On 12 May 1996, Ashton relinquished its 51% interest in the James Bay joint ventures for a $1 millions 
payment and the right prior to the production decision to acquire 25% of KWG's interest in any kimberlite 
or diamondiferous discovery by reimbursing KWG for 300% of its total expenditures in the discovery.  
The three-paragraph, two-page agreement makes no mention of Spider nor is it signed by a Spider officer, 
suggesting that it may only affect "KWG's interest."  It is desirable that Spider approach Ashton to 
remove this impediment to sensible development of the project. 

The McFauld's Lake VMS project was initially discovered in 2002, while Spider, KWG and De 
Beers Canada Exploration Inc. in joint venture were exploring the project area for kimberlites. De 
Beers holds a 1.5% net smelter royalty on the project, 0.5% of which can be purchased from De 
Beers by Spider and KWG for $1.5 million. To date, 10 isolated VMS occurrences have been 
identified and drill tested on the project, two of which have undergone detail drilling. UC plans to 
continue exploring this new VMS camp. Immediate plans involve the completion of deep 
geophysics on McFaulds #3 and #1 to identify drill targets below and in the vicinity of these two 
partially drilled off VMS (copper and zinc) occurrences. 

4.2.5 Spider, KWG Freewest McFauld's Lake  VMS Option Agreement 

Toronto – Canada - December 19, 2005 - Spider Resources Inc. announces the ratification of a tri-party 
option agreement between Spider Resources Inc. (SPQ-TSXV), KWG Resources Inc. (KWG-TSXV) and 
Freewest Resources Inc. (FWR-TSXV) regarding seven mineral claims constituting 78 claim units 
currently held by Freewest located immediately west of and contiguous to, Spider and KWG's McFaulds 

 17



Lake Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide ("VMS") Project, where they have previously identified 8 VMS 
style mineral occurrences.  

Under the option agreement, Spider and joint venture partner, KWG, must each deliver 150,000 shares 
and $25,000 for the right to individually earn a 25-per-cent interest by each incurring $100,000 of 
exploration expenditures by Feb. 28, 2006, and a combined total of $3-million by Oct. 31, 2009. 
Thereafter, the parties may earn an additional combined 10-per-cent interest upon subsequent delivery of a 
bankable feasibility study. The parties may then increase their combined interest to 65 per cent for 
arranging production financing. During November Spider made the initial $25,000 cash payment in good 
faith, and will be issuing 150,000 shares of Spider to Freewest once the agreement receives regulatory 
approval. KWG has agreed with Freewest to deliver 500,000 additional treasury shares in lieu of the initial 
cash option payment. In total, KWG Resources Inc. has agreed to issue 650,000 treasury shares to 
Freewest Resources Canada Inc. for its initial payments under an option agreement.  

The Freewest property has undergone initial exploration as financed by Freewest, including a Geotem 
airborne survey flown by Fugro in 2003. Line cutting and ground geophysics has also been completed on 
the project during 2004, followed by one drill hole. Massive to disseminated pyrite was encountered in 
this drill hole, confirming the presence of VMS style mineralization. Additional work was recommended 
at the time to test other geophysical anomalies evident on the property. Spider and KWG will be 
examining these anomalies in detail, in conjunction with Freewest, to select and prioritize at least two drill 
targets, thus meeting the initial earn-in requirements. Drilling is scheduled for early January 

 

4.3 Environmental Liabilities 
The operator is required to remove camps, fuel caches and any remaining waste material upon completing 
exploration.  Currently the operator backhauls empty containers, garbage, waste and scarp on supply 
flights from Nakina where there are believed to be approved waste disposal facilities.  There are no other 
existing environmental liabilities. 

 
5 PHYSIOGRAPHY, ACCESS AND CLIMATE 

5.1 Physiography 

The McFaulds Project Area lies along the western margin of the James Bay Lowland, an almost perfectly 
planar topographic feature that slopes slightly eastwards (0.7 m / km).  Major and secondary rivers incise 
slight trenches into the soft marine clays that cover much of the Lowland.  Elevations in the project area 
are about 140 m ASL. 

Drainage is poor due to the lack of relief, consequently inland areas remain water logged throughout the 
year.  Vegetation comprises grasses and sedges, low shrubs and sparse, stunted trees, predominantly 
tamarack and black spruce.  Woody species increase in size and proportion as drainages cut into 
overburden, forming better-drained banks.  Trees reach full size along stable banks of the major rivers 
(Burns 2003, 2004). 

The perennially water logged surface makes effective surface travel impossible except during the winter 
months (December to March). 

 18



5.2 Access 

The larger lakes in the area are accessible by float or ski plane, the closest of which are available from 
Nakina, ~300 km to the south; the closest town with an all weather road and railroad.  Smaller ponds, 
closer to work areas, form potential winter ice strips.  Snow machines afford good winter access within 
tens of kilometers of temporary airstrips.  Advanced programs require helicopter support for both moving 
equipment and ferrying personnel and supplies. 

The isolated First Nations communities of Webequie and Ogoki Post / Martin Falls lie ~90 km to the west 
and 120 km to the south respectively.  These communities are serviced by daily passenger and intermittent 
freight flights from Timmins or Thunder Bay.  Bulk supplies and heavy equipment are brought in over 
winter roads that may be passable for a few weeks each year. 

Timmins and Thunder Bay, the support centers for both the James Bay communities and for the Victor 
project, lies ~570 km south-southeast and 520 km to the southwest respectively of the project area. 

5.3 Climate 
The James Bay Lowland experiences long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Freeze-up of the 
major rivers occurs in late October or early November. The mean daily minimum in January temperatures 
is about -27°C. Spring breakup occurs in April. Mean annual precipitation is approximately 660 mm, and 
mean annual snowfall is approximately 2400 mm (snow depth). 

River levels reach their maximum during the spring runoff in late April and early May. Water levels 
typically drop through the summer and then increase during the fall prior to freeze up. Water levels 
fluctuate in response to even modest rainfall and short dry spells. 

 
6 EXPLORATION HISTORY 
6.1 GENERAL 

The Geological Survey of Canada and the Ontario Department of Mines carried out regional studies in 
1906 and again between 1940 and 1965. The main focus of the work was on the petroleum possibilities of 
the sedimentary basins in Hudson and James Bays and on industrial minerals in the Moose River Basin.  

The first large scale exploration was for diamonds. Blue (1899) suggested an Ontario source for diamonds 
found in Michigan and Wisconsin. A large diamond was discovered in Bucke Township (Haileybury) in 
1905. Satterly (1949) first recognized kimberlite in Ontario in Michaud Township in 1946. In 1959, 
Selection Trust started diamond exploration in the Lowland (Janse and Sheahan, 2003) and were joined by 
De Beers's interests in 1962 (T.4663).  Lee (1964) later recognized a pyrope garnet dispersion train in the 
Munro esker and traced it back to the Upper Canada Gold Mine where kimberlite dikes were later found.  
Monopros, De Beers' Canadian subsidiary, discovered the Attawapiskat kimberlite cluster in 1988 
(T.4663) by tracing a picroilmentite dispersal train from north of Hearst to the Attawapiskat River where 
diamonds were discovered in river sands and the Uniform kimberlite found in outcrop.  An airborne 
magnetic survey was used to map the kimberlite cluster.

6.2 McFaulds Area 
The following is a chronology of the work done on the McFaulds Project to date. Up to 2004 
most of the information was obtained from an Updated Technical Report on the McFaulds 
Project by Jim Burns.  
Since the first discovery of significant copper mineralization by De Beer's reverse circulation hole SP3-
03-007 and subsequent royalty agreement with De Beers, Spider / KWG have under-taken and extensive, 
multi-discipline exploration program to further test the initial discovery and surrounding area. Billiken 
Management Services conducted the work conducted the work under contract to the two companies. All 
exploration work was performed to industry standards in a professional manner.  Their exploration 
program to date includes, in chronological order, the elements listed below. The grids on which the bulk 
of the work has been done are shown on Figures 8a and 8b (see Jim Burns 2003 report). Except for some 
claim staking and airborne surveys the program was helicopter and Turbo Otter supported. 

• October / November, 2002: Staked an additional 29 claims (385 units). Work contracted to 
Greenstone Exploration Company Ltd (Greenstone). 

• March, 2003: Cut 2 small grids, one – baseline "A" (4.55 km over the McFaulds magnetic 
anomaly and the other base line "B" (0.6 km) over the apparent satellite resistivity anomaly and 
conducted magnetic and Max Min II electromagnetic surveys (100 and 150 m coil spacings) 
thereon. An approximately 300m long, strong Max Min anomaly was detected along the base line 
coincident with the McFaulds Magnetic anomaly which, from the magnetic data was interpreted 
to plunge to the southeastward. A weak Max Min anomaly was detected coincident with the 
apparent resistivity anomaly (Figures (9a & b 10 a & b Jim's report). Work was contracted to 
Hussy Geophysics Inc. (Hussy). 

 20



 
• March & April, 2003: Drilled 1314.m m in 6 BQ core holes (MCF-03-01 to 06) to test Max Min 

anomaly associated with the McFaulds magnetic anomaly (Figure 11).  Significant copper and 
zinc mineralization (referred to as McFaulds #1) was cored in all 6 holes associated with a 
magnetite-talc zone in a felsic volcanic sequence of rocks. Drilling was contracted to Heath & 
Sherwood Drilling (1986) Inc. (H & S). 

 
• April, 2003: Staked an additional 35 claims (500 units). Work contracted to Greenstone. 

 
• April, 2003: Conducted surface and down the hole (4 holes only) TEM surveys at the McFaulds 

magnetic anomaly. The surface survey delineated a 400+ m long anomaly coincident with the 
Max Min anomaly. The work was contracted to Quantec Geosciences Inc. 

 
• April / May, 2003: Drilled 740.0 m  in 2 BQ core holes (MCF-03-07 and 08) t0o further test the 

extent of McFaulds #1 zone (Figure 11). Drilling contracted to H & S. 
 

• July, 2003: Contracted James M. Franklin (Franklin Geosciences Ltd) to conduct an independent 
review of the drilling to date. Franklin concluded that the hydrothermal system that produced the 
mineralization at the McFaulds Lake is indeed VMS in style, that the hydrothermal system that 
produced the alteration is large that the style of the alteration, metal contents and volcanism is 
similar to the Mattagami Lake VMS camp. 

 
• July, 2003: Extended the grid over the McFaulds and apparent resistivity anomalies. The full 

extent of the grid is shown in (Figure11);. Some 25.5 km cut. Work contracted to Greenstone. 
 

• July / August, 2003: Drilled 2079.3 m in 6 BQ holes (MCF-03-09, 10,11,14, 15 & 16) to further 
test the extent of the McFaulds #1 zone and 385.0 m I 2 BQ holes (MCF-03-12 and13) to test the 
apparent resistivity anomaly (Figure 11). The McFaulds #1 zone was determined to have drilled a 
length of 200+ m, with a plunge of   approximately 55o to 60o, and to at least 300 m depth. The 
mineralized zone has a maximum thickness of 45 m. Semi-massive pyrite with chalcopyrite was 
cored at the resistivity anomaly. This Zone is now referred to as McFaulds #2. Drilling was 
contracted to H & S. 

 
• August, 2003: Flew a fixed wing, combined  magnetic and electromagnetic survey totaling 2,148 

line km over claims and surrounding area. Lines were flown oriented 135o/315o at a line spacing 
of 300m. The terrain clearance for the electromagnetic receiver was 70 m. Residual magnetic 
field data (Figure 12) suggests the area is underlain by a complexly folded, boomerang shaped 
volcanic belt. Of the numerous electromagnetic anomalies detected on the property or open 
ground a total of twelve, numbers, 1,2,4, 17, M-1, M-2, M-3, 20, 21, 22, 23, & 24, which include 
4 already drill tested, were considered worthy of follow-up work (Hogg, 2003) The airborne 
survey was contracted to Fugro Airborne Surveys (Fugro) and the interpretation to Scott Hogg 
and Associates (SHA). 

 
• August 2003: Completed Max Min II (10 m & 200M coil spacing) and magnetic surveys on 6 

line km over McFaulds #2. The zone has a short strike length but may have a source of multiple 
zones. Work contracted to Hussy. 

 
• September / October 2003: Cut 4 grids (C, D, E, & F) for a total of 53.7 line km. over interesting 

airborne electromagnetic anomalies (preliminary interpretation) and completed magnetic (41.5 
km) and Max Min electromagnetic surveys (30.2 km) thereon. Weak to strong EM anomalies 

 21



were defined. Line cutting contracted to Greenstone and the geophysics to MTEC Geophysics 
Inc. (MTEC). 

 
• September / October, 2003: Staked an additional 12 claims (192 units). Work contracted to 

Greenstone. 
 

• October, 2003: Drilled 479.0 m in three holes, MCF-03-017, 18 % 19. to determine the source for 
2 of the just gridded airborne EM anomalies. Hole 17 was abandoned. Hole 18 cored a 41.0 m 
mineralized zone (20 m true width) now referred to as McFaulds #3. Hole 19 minor sulphides in 
a gabbro. Drill contracted out to H & S. 

 
The above work is described in the Technical report by Burns dated November 12, 2003. 

 
• January – February, 2004: Staked an additional 56 claims (844 units). Work contracted to 

Greenstone. 
• January – April 2004: Cut 110.0 km of line in three grids "G", "H" & "J" over groups of airborne 

electromagnetic anomalies and conducted Max Min II surveys thereon. (Note – Grids "H" and "J" 
also extend onto claims owned by Freewest Resources Canada Inc.) Completed line cutting on 
grid "D". Re-chained lines o to 7+00E on Grid "C". Conducted detailed magnetic and 
electromagnetic surveys on the re-chained lines as well as on all of the new lines cut. The line 
cutting was contracted out to Greenstone, the geophysical surveys for Grids "C", "G", "H", & "J" 
to MTEC and for Grids "D" and "E" to Greenstone. The interpretation of the geophysics was done 
by SHA. Numerous targets for the drill testing were delineated (Hogg, 2004a, & 
b).Electromagnetic anomalies detected / interpreted from ground surveys are more numerous and 
extensive than those shown presented by SHA in their first pass interpretation of the Fugro 
airborne survey data. 

 
• January April 2004: Drilled an additional 4253.7 m of BQ core in 22 holes. The McFaulds #3 

occurrence was further tested with holes MCF-04-20 to 41. This occurrence was determined to 
have a NE (45o) strike and a steep (65o – 75o) NW dip. It has a strike length of 100m and a steep 
but indeterminate plunge, open to the NE, SW and to depth. It has a copper rich core. In addition , 
significant VMS style mineralization was discovered at four new zones which are referred to as 
McFaulds #4, (Grid "C"), McFaulds 5 & 6 (Grid "G") and McFaulds #7 (Grid "H") 
respectively. Drilling contracted to H & S. 

 
 
• April, 2004: Conducted transient electromagnetic (TEM) surveys at McFaulds #3, 4 and 6 and 

bore hole transient electromagnetic surveys (BTEM) at McFaulds #3 and 6. Work contracted to 
Discovery International Geophysics Inc. (Discovery Geophysics). For all three occurrences the 
electromagnetic anomaly associated with the occurrence extended further to the northeast than 
indicated by the Max Min II survey and the plunge of the causative body extends also to the 
northeast. 

 
•  July – October, 2004: Drilled a total of 11 BQ core holes: (MCF-05-42 – MCF-05-48 at 

McFaulds #3 and MCF-05-54 – 57 at McFaulds #3; MCF-05-49 testing a conductor at Grid "D" 
and four holes MCF-05-50 – 53 at McFaulds #5 and #6 totaling 3319 m .             Four drill, holes 
(MCF-05-50 – 53) totaling 1167 m were completed testing geophysical magnetic and Max-Min 
anomalies at McFaulds #5 and #6, and 255 m to test a conductor located at grid "D". This field 
season ended on a "high note" with MCF-04-57 returning an assay of 8% copper over 18 m. 

 

 22



• January – March , 2005:Conducted a limited "down the hole" geophysical survey at McFaulds #3 
and 1. Conducted  magnetic and Max Min II surveys were conducted on Grids "L", "M". "N" and 
"O" in the western claim block. The Max Min was contracted out to JVX (Christ Hale). The line 
cutting was contracted to Greenstone. In addition a Time Domain Electromagnetic Survey 
(VTEM  was conducted of 1480.2 km over the McFaulds Lake area and 104.6 over the Western 
Claim Block by Geotech Limited (Geotech). The nominal EM sensor terrain clearance was 30 m 
as the helicopter remained 75 m above the ground. The focus of the Max Min Survey was to 
identify and locate accurately the VTEM anomalies on the ground in the above mentioned Grids. 

 
 

• During the Winter 2005 field season 8 more drill holes MCF-05 (3115 m) were completed at 
McFaulds #3 to test the downward plunge extension of the mineralization. In addition, one (1) 
drill hole (391.5 m) was put down at the McFaulds #1 VSM deposit to test known mineralization 
at depth plus an indicated geophysical conductor identified during a Down-the-Hole EM/IP 
survey. A 129 m core hole (MCF-05-68) was drilled on Grid "K" to test a Max Min II and 
magnetic anomaly. Good volcanic rocks were found similar to McFaulds #3 but only weak 
sulphide and 2-4% magnetite mineralization was intersected. 

            The initial interpretation of the results suggested that there was a large gravity anomaly centered 
near and parallel to the existing base line; basic modeling of the excess mass inferred by the   
gravity anomaly suggested it was located at least 600 metres below the surface, however this 
excess mass anomaly was not explained by the diamond drilling completed on the McFaulds #3 
occurrence to date, located in the same position with respect to the grid and base line. McFaulds 
#3 had only been drill tested from surface to the 400 meter depth level, the top of the excess mass 
anomaly was modeled at 600 meters below surface, extending much deeper. At the time of the 
initial survey, JVX recommended additional gravity work, since the contoured bouguer gravity 
anomaly clearly showed that the gravimetric survey coverage did not extend far enough to define 
the anomaly completely. By the time this interpretation was made spring conditions prevailed and 
the survey could not be completed. The gravity anomaly identified in the 2005 survey, paralleled 
the base line, and followed the drill inferred strike, dip and plunge of McFauld's #3 occurrence in 
the northeasterly direction, towards the McFaulds #1 occurrence that is located 1.1 km to the 
northeast. Insufficient gravimetric coverage at the time precluded the completion of the 
interpretation. The current program is designed to extend the coverage over the two occurrences 
and thus define the anomaly in order to complete the interpretation 

 
 
 
7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
Surficial geology of the James Bay Lowland is dominated by the widespread marine clay cover that 
obscures the Paleozoic platform rocks, which are best exposed along the Attawapiskat where they locally 
form cliffs and rapids that limited the value of the river as a fur-trading route.  Paleozoic outcrop is more 
typically restricted to isolated, often broken and frost-heaved outcrops along major and secondary rivers.  
The eastern extension of the Superior Province is deduced from magnetic and gravity data and from 
diamond drilling. 

 23

(purple dashed line) (OGS, 1991). 

7.1 Precambrian Geology 
The Precambrian geology of the area is inferred from airborne geophysical data (Stott G.M. 2007) 
supplemented by sparse gravity and diamond drill data.  Magnetic patterns suggest a basement complex 
comprising volcanic and sedimentary belts between large expanses of granite and gneisses.  The extreme 
eastern part of the Sachigo Greenstone Belt extends to the east where it extends under the western edge of 
the Paleozoic cover. The McFaulds VMS Camp occurs at the western edge of the greenstone belt. 

There are a handful of basement inliers in the Lowland as follows: 

• Coarse-grained fragmental and pillowed basalts ~30 km north of Missisa Lake (McBride, 
1994) 

• Fine- to medium-grained intermediate to felsic volcanic~55 km NNW  of Missisa Lake 

• Aphebian (Proterozoic) iron formation, greywacke and other clastic sediments (Sutton 
Ridge Formation), dolomite, limestone and minor argillite (Nowashe Formation) and 
Archean gneisses are exposed in the Sutton Outlier ~200 km north northeast of Missisa 
Lake (Bostock, 1971) 

• Sheared mafic to intermediate metavolcanics outcrop in the northeast part of the project 
area (Thomas, 1995d).  

Structurally the area represents the eastward extension of the Superior Province.  Many workers (e.g., 
Halls et al. (2005, Hogg, 1994a and others) have noted the apparent association of dike swarms with the 
locations of kimberlites largely due to the ease with which they can be traced using airborne magnetics.  
Halls et al. (ibid.) suggest that the south-southeasterly trending Winisk Fault plays a role in the 
localization of kimberlites. 

 24



A weathering profile, locally including a regolith, is developed in the upper 10 to 20 m of Precambrian 
basement underlying Paleozoic rocks. 

7.2 Paleozoic Geology 
The Paleozoic section spans Ordovician to Cretaceous, the latter being developed in the Moose River 
basin far to the southeast.  In the project area, the section is limited to Ordovician and Silurian rocks, 
which are, absent along the west edge of the project area but reaches 200 m to the south and east.  

The section in the project area comprises thin, poorly consolidated, basal sandstone, mudstone overlain by 
muddy dolomites and limestone intervals of Ordovician and Silurian age. 

7.3 Quaternary Geology 
The thickness of the Quaternary section ranges from 3.5 to 74.4 m in drill holes.  It typically comprises 1 
to 2 m of sandy (Wisconsin) till overlain by sand (proximal varves?) grading up to clays (distal varves?) 
and capped by marine clays (Thomas, 2004).  Older, pre-Wisconsin, interglacial sediments and tills are 
locally preserved (e.g., DR 95-46).  

Glacial striae suggest a southwesterly ice flow in east and south parts of the area and to the southeast west 
of 85°W (e.g., Bell, 1872, 1878; Fulton, 1995).  More recent work (e.g., Thorleifson et al., 1993) suggest 
that the predominant, Late Wisconsin, ice flow direction was west or northwest migrating through time to 
the southwest.  They argue that the south to southeast flow patterns, termed the Winisk Ice Stream 
(e.g.,Fulton, 1995), were late and short-lived. 

 
 
8 DEPOSIT TYPE 
 
The James Bay Lowlands and northern Ontario are generally under explored.  Thus even though the main 
thrust of the exploration has been to discover kimberlites, several other types of mineralization have been 
encountered particularly the McFaulds VMS deposits.  When encountered, these alternate types of 
mineralization have been quickly assessed to determine if they have a potential for economic exploitation.  
As a result, the deposit types being investigated at any one time will vary depending on what has been 
recently found.  In addition, two areas have been split off into separate projects still under the general 
Spider #3 Joint Venture.  These are the Kyle Project and MacFadyen Projects which will not be discussed 
in this report. Also the Kitchie Lake PGM to the south of the McFaulds Project will not be discussed in 
this report. 
The volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) base metal deposits are the type sought on the McFaulds Lake 
property. An idealized VMS deposit as shown in Figure xx consists of a concordant massive sulphide 
(>60% sulphide minerals) lens that is normally underlain by a discordant stockwork or stringer zone of 
vein-type sulphide mineralization contained in a pipe ("feeder pipe") of hydrothermally altered rock. The 
stock work represents the near surface channelway of a submarine hydrothermal system and the massive 
sulphide lens the accumulation of sulphides precipitated on the sea floor above and adjacent to the 
discharge vent. Submarine volcanic flows and pyroclastic rocks are the usual host rocks but volcanoclastic 
and chemical sediments such as chert bands may be present. The mineralization usually occurs at the 
contact between stratigraphic units. Of the minerals found in the McFaulds VMS (Matagami Type) 
deposits the primary mineral is magnetite with large sections of pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and lesser 
quantities of sphalerite. Chlorite and sericite are the main alteration minerals but talc is also found in the 
McFaulds deposits which are similar to that found at the Matagami VMS deposits found in Quebec. A 
single deposit or mine may consist of several individual massive sulphide lenses and their underlying 
stockwork zones. Deposits often occur in clusters. Often deposits are blanketed by a pyritic horizon that 

 25



extends as a stratigraphic marker horizon far away from the deposit. At McFaulds the blanket is magnetite 
and is found away from the deposits where the sulphides pinch out. Dimensions for a massive sulphide 
lens normally are a few hundreds of meters in length and 10's of meters thick. The average size and grade 
of the 58 VMS deposits from the Abitibi Sub Province are 9.2 million tonnes at 1.47% Cu, 3.43% Zn, 
31.9 g/t Ag and 0.8 g/t Au. (The above description was summarized from Lydon, 1988 and Chartrand and 
Cattalani 1990.) 
It is obvious that VMS deposits represent an extremely attractive exploration targets. The massive 
sulphide lenses almost always respond well to electromagnetic methods. By contrast, the stringer zone, 
due to the lesser concentration of sulphides is more easily detected by IP surveys and may also display a 
magnetic signature due to the presence of pyrrhotite and/or magnetite. Once a deposit and its surrounding 
rocks have been subject to regional deformation the geophysical footprint of a VMS deposit would be 
short (1000m) or a series of short electromagnetic anomalies in close proximity to a stratigraphically 
overlying much longer, regional, formational, electromagnetic anomaly. Any EM anomaly with a 
signature in a geological setting similar to that described above should be tested by drilling. 
 
9 MINERALIZATION 

9.1 General 

There are no outcrops on or adjacent to the McFaulds VMS deposits and occurrences. All information 
regarding the bedrock geology was determined by logging the De Beers reverse circulation holes and the 
core drilling from MCF-03-01 to 03-19, MCF-04-20 to 04-41, MCF-04-42 to MCF-04-57 and MCF-05-58 
to MCF-05-68. The drilling plan for the summer-fall 2004 and the winter 2005 was done primarily to 
delineate the McFaulds #3 deposit to the east and down dip. In addition one deep hole was drilled at 
McFaulds #1 to test a deep down –the-hole EM anomaly. Two holes were drilled testing McFaulds #5 and 
two holes to test McFaulds #6. One hole was drilled testing a weak Max Min and magnetic anomaly along 
strike and between the mineralization found at McFaulds #3 and 1. A single shallow exploration drill hole 
(MCF-05-68) tested a strong VTEM-MAX-MIN and magnetic anomaly discovered about 40 km 
southwest of the McFaulds camp. Only weak sulphide and disseminated magnetite was intersected. Over 
the know mineral deposits at McFaulds #3 and #1 an attempt was made to test the lateral and down dip 
vertical extensions of the mineralization at 25m, 50m and 100m spacing. 

9.2 McFaulds #3  

To further evaluate and delineate this mineral occurrence 11 core holes were drilled in the summer-fall 
2004 (Table 2) and an addition 8 core holes (Table 3) were drilled in the winter of 2005. The potentially 
economic part of the mineralized horizon (MH) extends approximately from L7+50E to L9+50 to the east 
and extends down to approximately 300m vertical depth with a variable thickness of a maximum of 45m 
to 3.5m. No attempt is made to determine the average thickness or average grade of the copper-zinc-gold-
silver mineralization. It strikes 040º to 45o, dips 65o to75o to the NW, and has a strike length of +/- 200m. 
(Burns, J. G., 2004). The mineralization of the VMS deposit is very variable with parts of massive pyrite 
with low grade copper, massive magnetite, massive chalcopyrite (18.8 m of >8%) and small sections of 
massive sphalerite and pyrrhotite. 

The approximate geological boundary has been determined but due to the limitations of the mobile drill 
rig (BBS 25A) the ground below a vertical depth of 500m cannot be tested. Geophysical surveys 
conducted by JVX in the fall of 2004 and winter of 2005 gave strong indications of conductivity below 
500m and a gravity anomaly indicating a potential excess mass below 500m. One deep hole drilled in the 
summer of 2006 did not intersect any significant sulphide mineralization that would explain the excess 
mass. Any further testing of the continuance or repetition of the copper-zinc mineralization will depend on 

 26



mobilizing a larger drill rig. Also the lines used in the gravity survey at McFaulds #3 and #1 would have 
to be extended to allow for a better interpretation of the gravity survey. 

The MH is generally characterized by an envelope of black magnesium rich chlorite within which 
massive, semi-massive to disseminated magnetite has precipitated and/or replaced the chlorite. The 
intensity of this magnetite mineralization is focused between L7+50E and L9+60E down dip about 300m. 
Co-existing with the magnetite-chlorite rich horizon are found lenses/bands of mass (>75%), semi-mass 
(40-75%), stringers and disseminated pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite. There is a crude 
zoning apparent in the deposit with the near surface mineralization rich in pyrite +/- pyrrhotite with a 
gradual increase in chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite with depth (Franklin J., 2005).  

Sphalerite is more common near surface and is usually concentrated above the chalcopyrite. Both the gold 
and silver concentrations are closely related to copper concentration. Generally the lower sections of the 
magnetite bands beds have been replaced by the chalcopyrite. The high grade of copper mineralization 
and the nature of the mineralogy of the alteration minerals strongly suggest that McFaulds #3 is a typical 
feeder zone of a VMS deposit (Franklin J., 2005). The alteration consists of black magnesium rich 
chlorite, minor talc with interbedded tuffs and cherty sediments. Small-scale folds are occasionally 
observed but no repetition of the sulphide beds was observed. 

A summary of the drill results from the summer-fall 2004 drilling is listed in Table 2. Similarly, a 
summary of the Winter 2005 drill results is listed in Table 3. No attempt was made to calculate the true 
thickness but an estimate of this parameter can be found by examining the intercepts calculated by James 
G. Burns found in his Technical Updated report dated July 15, 2004. 

9.3 McFaulds #1 No drilling on this VMS target was done during the summer-fall exploration program 
but one hole was drilled during the winter 2005 exploration program. Additional details of this occurrence 
can be found in the Technical Update Report prepared by James G. Buns dated July 15, 2004. A 
preliminary gravity survey by JVX discovered an gravity anomaly estimated to be at a 500m vertical 
depth. This excess mass anomaly remains to be tested by drilling deep holes. 

 
9.4 Layered Chromite Mineralization 
 
Three drill holes were put down on claims (P-3008793, 3008267 and 269) held by Freewest Resources 
Ltd. Under terms of a Spider and Freewest Joint Venture agreement Spider could acquire an interest in 
their property by spending at least $350,000 to get a 40% interest.  The results from two holes drilled on 
Grid H where negative. However, a drill hole testing a magnetic and weak EM anomaly on Grid J 
intersected two massive bands (1.05m and 0.85m) that graded 20% and 23% Cr respectively and ranged 
from 0.4 g/t to  0.75 g/t Pt-Pd. This was the first time massive chromite with chrome, platinum, palladium, 
rhodium and ruthenium, as well as anomalous nickel was discovered in the McFaulds Project Area. 
 
10 EXPLORATION 
 
10.1 General 
During February and March 2006, Billiken Management Services Inc. was contracted to carry out 
diamond drilling on ground Grid L and Grid N covering several claims in BMA 526 863 (G-
4282) and BMA 526 862 (G-5130) held by Spider Resources Inc. (50%) and KWG Resources 
Inc. (50%). The property is located approximately 30 kilometers west of the McFaulds Lake. 
discovery area in the James Bay Lowlands area of Northern Ontario. The project area is located 
585 kilometers NW of Timmins, Ontario. Figure 7, shows location of the claim group in northern 

 27



Ontario, some 200 km. west (or upstream) from the First Nation community of Attawapiskat on 
the western shore of James Bay, or conversely 80 km. east of the First Nation community of 
Webequie, or approximately 110 km north of the First Nation community of Martin Falls (Ogoki 
Post FN).

The drilling campaign covered 3 claims, held jointly by KWG Resources Inc. and Spider 
Resources Inc. The three claims involved in this project that were subject to this work report are 
P 3008691, P3008690 and P 3013546. These claims are located within the Porcupine Mining 
District and are identified on MNDM plan maps BMA 526 863 (G-4282) and BMA 526 862 (G-
5130) (see Figure 8).

Billiken staff initially reviewed the available regional airborne VTEM survey as completed by Geotech 
Ltd. in January 2005,  that was immediately followed up with local ground geophysical surveying 
(HLEM, VLF and Magnetics) by JVX Ltd. The initial proposed drill site was selected by Billiken staff in 
discussion with JVX Ltd. staff. The target anomalies were selected and holes was spotted in the field as 
required 
 
The survey area is underlain by Archean metavolcanic assemblages consisting of gabbro and felsic – 
intermediated tuffs. These rocks form part of the Eastern Sachigo sub province, or more locally the Ekwan 
belt. The area is covered by 3 billion year old supracrustal rocks, the Ekwan belt has been dated at 2.72 
billion years. The target rock type for this project is massive sulphide, copper, zinc, gold and silver being 
the commodities of interest. 

 

 
 
A crew of five drillers (2 day shift and 2 night shift, plus one foreman) were employed by Heath & 
Sherwood (1986) Inc. a diamond drill contractor from Kirkland Lake, Ontario. They used a BBS 37 
diamond drill, and drilled BQ size core for the project. Drill supervision was done out of the Billiken base 
camp, Howard Lahti Ph.D., P.Geo. and Pat Chance M.Sc., P.Eng. were the drill geologists, working under 
the auspices of Neil Novak P.Geo. in the capacity of project manager. 

 

 29



Drilling commenced on February 20 and was completed by March 5, 2006. The intended targets weres 
Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide style mineralization. The three holes were designed to test strong VTEM 
and Max-Min and magnetic anomalies.  
 
10.1.1 Hole McF-06-69 (see figure 9) 
 
Grid L was cut on claim P-3008691 and at L10+00mE at approximately 400mN a conductor was 
identified up to 300 meters long with an intermediate dip to north, the depth/conductance estimates at this 
location were 45m/35S (440Hz) and 40m/15S (1760Hz), there was also a coincident magnetic high of 
50nT. Hole McF-06-69 was collared on line 10+00E at 500 m. North and drilled grid south (azimuth 2000) 
with an initial dip of -500. This hole intersected massive pyrite along with disseminated and banded pyrite 
along with porphyroblasts of magnetite mineralization. This mineralization was intersected from ~74 – 78 
meters down hole. This intersection corresponds with and explains the anomaly seen in the surface 
geophysical survey. A feldspar porphyry (crystal tuff) was also intersected suggesting that the volcanic 
package in this area is similar to what is found at McFaulds #3 located about 25 km to the east. A drill log 
for this hole is appended to this report (appendix I). A total of 8 samples were selected from the core of 
this hole consisting of the sample series 2611399 to 261406 inclusive, assay certificates for the 8 samples 
selected from hole McF-06-69 are also included in the appendix, as is a vertical section of the hole to its 
final depth of 233 meters.

10.1.2 Hole McF-06-70 (see figure 10) 
 
On claim P-3008690 being also on Grid "L" at L6+00mE at about 400mN being some 400 meters west of 
the previous drill hole location, a continuation of the conductor is apparent. The conductor is not quite as 
intense, however the magnetic expression is higher. Hole McF-06-70 was drilled to test this anomaly. The 
hole collar was located at L 6+00E at 4+50m N and was drilled grid south (azimuth 2000) with an initial 
dip of -510. This hole cut an intermediate to felsic fragmental succession containing two significant 
intervals of banded sulphides, between 55 meters and 58 meters as well as one further down the hole 
starting at 194 meters. Host rocks exhibited sericitic alteration, garnet grains and intermittent presence of 
sulphides (mostly pyrite) and magnetite. The geophysical anomaly was explained. A drill log for this hole 
is appended to this report (appendix II). A total of 28 samples were selected from the core of this hole 
consisting of the sample series 261371 to 261398 inclusive, assay certificates for the 28 samples selected 
from hole McF-06-70 are also included in this appendix, as is a vertical cross-section of the hole to its 
final depth of 300 meters.

10.1.3 Hole McF-06-71 (see figure 11) 
 
On claim P-3013546, Grid "N" was cut, and a moderate to strong anomaly is evident on lines 5+00 and 
6+00mE at about 4+50mN, corresponding with a magnetic high. Hole McF-06-71 was drilled to test this 
anomaly. This holes collar is located at Line 5+00E at station 5+25 m N, drilled grid south (azimuth 2000) 
with an initial dip of -500. An intersection of massive to semi-massive pyrrhotite and pyrite was made 
between 117 meters and 121 meters, with strongest mineralization near the upper portion of the 
intersection. Both the magnetic anomaly and EM conductor was explained by the encountered sulphide 
zone.. A total of 21 samples were selected from the core of this hole consisting of the sample series 

 33



261425, 261435 to 261454 inclusive, assay certificates for the 21 samples selected from hole McF-06-71 
are also included in this appendix, as is a vertical cross-section of the hole to its final depth of 230 meters.

10.1.4 Conclusion and Recommendations 

 
A number of other geophysical anomalies were indicated on Grid L and N as per the final JVX report 
dated June 2005, some of which should be tested by diamond drilling at a later date, particularly since the 
holes on Grid L intersected moderate mineralization in copper and zinc.  

The primary tested anomalies on this property that were targeted for drilling intersected sulphide 
mineralization that is indicative of distal mineralization to classic Volcanic Massive Sulphide style 
mineralization. Hole McF-06-70 intersected minor copper mineralization (samples 261382 to 261384) 
over 3 meters between 55.6 meters and 58.6 meters averaging 0.384% Cu. Hole McF-06-69 intersected 
minor zinc mineralization (samples 261403 t0 261406) over 2.24 meters between 74.77 meters and 77.5 
meters averaging 0.997% Zn. No other significant assays were received from the sampling of the 
mineralized section encountered by these holes. Alternate drill targets of lesser priority, within the same 
grid areas should be tested by additional drill holes. Only semi-massive sulphide mineralization was 
encountered in the two holes drilled on Grid L, both of which qualify as new VMS style mineralization 
discoveries.  The complete report is located in Appendix 3. 

10.2  Spider/KWG/Freewest 2006 Project 
During January and February 2006, Billiken Management Services Inc. was contracted to carry out an all 
inclusive diamond drilling program on ground Grid "H and J" covering portions of claims in BMA 
527861 held by Freewest Resources Canada Inc. under option to Spider Resources Inc. and KWG 
Resources Inc (Novak, 2006). These latter two companies are in a regional Joint Venture program and 
have optioned the subject property from Freewest. In the Winter 2006 field season three drill holes were 
drilled on the Freewest Claims to drill test several VTEM-magnetic anomalies, which were confirmed by 
ground MaxMin surveys,  for massive sulphides.  
Billiken staff initially reviewed the available regional airborne survey as completed by Fugro in the 
summer of 2003, that was immediately followed up with local ground geophysical surveying (HLEM, 
VLF and Magnetics) by Scott Hogg & Associates. The proposed drill sites were selected by Billiken staff 
in discussion with Scott Hogg and their staff, as well as Freewest and their staff. The target anomalies 
were selected and holes were spotted in the field as required and position was verified using hand held 
GPS. In addition to locating the drill hole with GPS a number of claim posts were also located on the 
ground grids and position recorded by GPS providing reasonable assurance of claim post location with 
respect to drill hole location.  
 
Drilling commenced on January 11 and was completed by February 13, 2006. The intended targets were 
Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide style mineralization. An unfortunate accident occurred on the project on 
the 22 of January, when the initial drill being used burnt. The project was on hold for 10 days while a new 
drill was located, and brought into site. The drilling recommenced on the 2nd of February. Prior to the fire, 
an Astar BA was used, then an Astar B2 was brought in to move the heavier drill that replaced the first 
drill. Three holes totaling 804.5 meters were drilled in this program and are hereby presented in detail. 
 
10.2.1 General 
 
The property is located approximately 20 kilometers WSW of the McFaulds Lake discovery area 
in the James Bay Lowlands area of Northern Ontario. Figure 1, shows location of the claim group 
in northern Ontario, some 200 km. west (or upstream) from the First Nation community of 
Attawapiskat on the western shore of James Bay, or conversely 80 km. east of the First Nation 
community of Webequi.  More specifically, the center using UTM co-ordinates it is centered 
upon 555000mE 5845000mN (NAD83 Z16).

Billiken employees and the diamond drill crew operated from a large base camp, located at McFauld's 
Lake, approximately 20 kilometers to the ENE of the project area. Access to the drill site was by 
helicopter, based at McFaulds Lake, the drill crew flew daily to and from the site. Access to the McFaulds 
base camp is by fixed wing (float planes in summer, ski planes in winter) as well as helicopter year round. 
This camp is serviced out of Nakina, Ontario. 

Billiken contracted the drilling to Heath & Sherwood (1986) Inc., and used  James Burns P.Eng. (camp 
supervisor) and Howard Lahti Ph.D., P.Geo., (senior geologist), and Neil Novak P. Geo. (project manager) 
to complete the work described herein. A helicopter BA and then a B2 Astar under contract to Billiken 
from Les Helicoperes Abitibi Ltee., of La Sarre PQ.  was used for moving men back and forth, as well as 
the drill move to and from the site.  

The drilling campaign covered 6 claims, held by Freewest Resources Canada Inc. under option to Spider 
Resources Inc. and KWG Resources Inc. The five claims involved in this project that were subject to this 
work report are P 3012250, P 3012252, P 3012253, P 3008268, P3008269 and P 3008793. These claims 
are located within the Porcupine Mining District and are identified on MNDM plan map BMA 527861 
Area. (see Figure 13). The claims were originally staked and recorded on April 22, 2003.  

The survey area is underlain by Archean metavolcanic assemblages consisting of gabbro and felsic – 
intermediated tuffs. These rocks form part of the Eastern Sachigo sub province, or more locally the Ekwan 
belt. The area is cored by 3 billion year old supracrustal rocks, the Ekwan belt has been dated at 2.72 
billion years.  Nearby to the east there is a thick blanket of Paleozoic sediments that cover much of the 
James Bay Lowlands area. These Paleozoic rock types vary with depth, changing from dolomite to 
limestone to calcareous and/or arenaceous sandstone to unconsolidated or poorly cemented sandstone, 
their thickness wanes to none existent a few kilometers east of the project site. 
 
10.2.2 Drilling 
 
After the completion of line cutting and ground geophysics (subject of a different report by Scott Hogg 
and Associates dated April 2005) as well as a few trips back and forth to the drill site by the helicopter 
with various Billiken personnel for drill site selection purposes, three drill holes were selected to test 
agreed upon anomalies identified by various ground geophysical surveys completed including Horizontal 
Loop electromagnetic, and magnetic surveying. The drill program commenced on January 11, 2006 and 
was completed by February 13, 2005, with a 10 day hiatus midway through program due to fire incident. 

 10.2.3 Hole FW-06-02 
Drill hole FW-06-02 was collared on claim P 3008269, at GPS location 555368 E, 5845849 N using NAD 
83 datum UTM Zone 16. The initial azimuth of the hole was 130 degrees (grid south), with an initial dip 
of –50.3 degrees. Additional dip tests were taken at 20m, 80m and 140 meters down hole, flattening to 
48.6 degrees at 140m. The hole had a final depth of 197 meters. The target anomaly was classified as a 
Max-Min anomaly  with a conductor axis that is centered at ground grid "H" location L 30+00 mE, at  
10+00 mS. The drill hole was collared at L 30+00 mE at 9+00 mS.  
This hole intersected a 9.85 meter wide sulphide bearing zone that contained an estimated 40 – 50% pyrite 
in a black chloritic altered felsic tuff, within a much wider muscovite alteration halo. Samples were 
selected for analysis and were submitted to ALS Chemex in Thunder Bay, Ontario for sample 
preparation, then forwarded to the ALS Chemex Lab in Vancouver B.C. for assay. 
 
10.2.4 Hole FW-06-03  
Drill hole FW-06-03 was collared on claim P 3012353, at approximate GPS location 555835 E, 
5845852 N using NAD 83 datum UTM Zone 16. The initial azimuth of the hole was 120 degrees 
(grid south), with an initial dip of –50.0 degrees. Additional dip tests were taken at 17m, 77m, 

 36



137m, 212m, 251m and 353.5 meters down hole, flattening to 47.6 degrees at 353.5m. The hole 
had a final depth of 353.5 meters. The target anomaly was classified as a VTEM/Max-Min on the 
southern flank of a triangular shaped magnetic anomaly, with a conductor axis that is centered at 
ground grid "J" location L 10+00 mE, at  13+20 mN. The drill hole was collared at L 10+00 mE 
at 15+25 mN.  
 
No sulphides or other conductive minerals were observed that adequately explained the 
conductivity exhibited by this anomaly, however two massive chromite beds were intersected 
being 1.05 meters wide, followed by 0.85 meters wide starting at a down hole depth of 153.27 
meters followed by second bed starting at 159 meters. Most of the hole was in a serpentinized 
ultramafic containing a variable amount of disseminated and seams of magnetite, thus explaining 
the strong magnetic anomaly. This ultramafic rock was later determined to be mildly conductive, 
perhaps explaining the conductor anomaly in the VTEM and Max-Min surveys. Samples were 
selected for analysis and were submitted to ALS Chemex in Thunder Bay, Ontario for sample 
preparation, then forwarded to the ALS Chemex Lab in Vancouver B.C. for assay. The initial 
assay certificate contained over detection limit for chrome, so additional assaying was completed. 
Once the initial assay results were received, additional sampling was undertaken to infill above 
and below the very anomalous chrome sections, as well as a short section where gold assays were 
received further down the hole.  
 
10.2.5 Hole FW- 06-04  
 Drill hole FW-06-04 was collared on claim P 3012353, at GPS location 551604 E, 5845237 N 
using NAD 83 datum UTM Zone 16. The initial azimuth of the hole was 120 degrees (grid 
south), with an initial dip of –50.0 degrees. Additional dip tests were taken at 17m, 68m, 137m, 
167m, 218m and 254 meters down hole, flattening to 44.5 degrees at 254m. The hole had a final 
depth of 254 meters. The target anomaly was classified as a VTEM/Max-Min on with associated 
magnetic signature, with a conductor axis that is centered at ground grid "J" location L 14+00 
mE, at  10+20 mN. The drill hole was collared at L 14+00 mE at 12+00 mN. (see Figure 5).   

The hole intersected several sulphide rich zones, including 0.74 meters of massive pyrrhotite at 
128 meter hole depth, followed by another short section (0.47m) of massive pyrrhotite starting at 
132.38 meters. There were two observed sulphide rich zones of approximately 9 meters each, 
containing an estimated 10 – 20 % pyrite – pyrrhotite in seams and as disseminations. These two 
zones explain the conductor and magnetic anomalies. The mineralized zones were sampled, 
starting with sample number 261336 through to 261370 and were submitted to ALS Chemex in 
Thunder Bay, Ontario for sample preparation, then forwarded to the ALS Chemex Lab in 
Vancouver B.C. for assay. The assay certificates (TB 06012722 and TB 06019405 for this hole 
are appended to this report, along with the diamond drill log and a vertical cross section. 

10.2.6 Conclusion and Recommendations 
Three geophysical anomalies located on Freewest Grids "H" and "J" were drill tested during the early part 
of 2006. Out of the three holes the best results were from hole FW-06-03 where a new chrome – platinum 
– palladium occurrence was discovered. The mineralization occurs as two layered bands 1.0 and 0.85 m 
respectively. Continuation of this hole encountered gold mineralization contained within thin quartz 
veinlets with minor chalcopyrite. This is also geologically interesting by adding gold as a potential target 
in this area. The magnetic unit that hosts this new discovery is considered a prime exploration prospect for 
additional chrome, PGM and gold mineralization and should be followed up by additional geophysics and 

 37



diamond drilling. The other two anomalies that where tested encountered mineralization that was of 
volcanic hosted massive sulphide style, however, only geochemically anomalous values in copper and 
zinc were encountered. 

10.3 SPIDER/KWG/UC RESOURCES 2007 DRILLING PROGRAM 
10.3.1Introduction 
 
In June 2-7 UC Resources commenced a drilling program to extend the known mineralization on 
the McFaulds # 3 VMS deposit in the Porcupine Mining District James Bay Lowlands. The 
drilling program was designed to test a strong gravity anomaly that was thought to indicate the 
mineralized zone extended at depth (top of anomaly was estimated to be at 500m below the 
surface) and the copper rich mineralization southwest of L8+00E. The drilling was supervised by 
Howard Lahti Ph. D. P. Geo and assisted by Mike Kilborne, a geologist. A total of 2354 meters 
of core was drilled in 7 holes (Table1) and a total of 117 samples were collected. The project was 
completed in late August.

10.3.2Results 
 
10.3.2.1 MCF-07-73 
 
This hole was planned to under-cut by 75 m drill hole MCf-05-59 (7.91% Cu over 8.54m: 285.04-293.58m) on 
L7+75E 2+50N. The hole intersected the Mineralized Zone at 329.03-345.2m (16.17m) but consisted only of 
disseminated sulphides of pyrite, minor pyrrhotite and some thin bands of magnetite. This intersection was not 
considered to be of economic importance.  
 

 38



 
10.3.2.2 MCF-07-74 
 
This hole was designed to under-cut MCF-05-57 (238.8-257.6m: 18.8m with a grade of 8.02% 
Cu) by 75M on L8+00E 1+75N. The excessive deviation of the hole would mean that the hole 
would intersect the Mineralized Zone well above MCF-05-57 at about 200m above the intended 
target. Because of the excessive flattening of the hole it was stopped at 158m and abandoned. 
 
 
10.3.2.3 MCF-07-75 
 
This hole was design to over-cut MCF-04-41 by 75M. The DDH intersected the Mineralized Zone from 
164.28-183.30m. The zoned VMS has bands enriched in chalcopyrite and another enriched in sphalerite. The 
average grade over the 19.02m was 2.69% Cu, 4.35% Zn, 0.35 g/t Au and 6.65 g/t Ag. This drill hole fills in a 
gap in the drill pattern and was needed to help determine the grade and resources in this deposit. 
 
10.3.2.4 MCF-07-76 
 
This drill hole over-cuts MCF-07-75 (L8+25E 1+65N) and was designed to intersect the mineralized zone at a 
shallower depth. The hole was drilled at minus 49 degrees south. And intersected copper-zinc mineralization 
from 154 to 161.5 meters (7.5m) that assayed 1.8% copper, 3.3% zinc 0.22 g/t gold and 7.47% silver..  The 
upper part of  the zone from 154 to 159.21 meters (5.21 m) averaged 2.49% copper and the lower part from 157 
to 161.5  meters  (4.5m) averaged 4.6% zinc.  
 
10.3.2.5 MCF-07-77 
 
This drill hole was designed to under cut MCF-05-57 by at least 75m. This hole had intersected 18.8 m grading 
8.08% copper. Due to very bad ground casing had to be reamed to 46.5m to the felsic tuff. lithology. The hole 
starting flattening drastically in the felsic tuff down to about 150m and went off its start azimuth. It's wandered 
off-section too with pierce point closer to 7+75 E and did not hit the target. 
 
10.3.2.6 MCF-07-78 
 
This hole targets a strong gravity anomaly identified by JVX geophysical consulting company in 2006. This 
hole was designed to intersect the down dip/rake to the northeast of the shallower part of the McFaulds # 3 
VMS deposit. The target was estimated to start at a 500m vertical depth. 
Hole designed to undercut MCF-04-55 by 75m on L9+50E. The hole was backed up down section to correct 
for abundant flattening so far encountered in this drill program. However, hole still flattened to an extreme 
degree causing the hole to miss the intended target at a higher elevation.  
The Mineralized Zone extends from 474.12-488.8 (14.68m) within which occurs a massive to semi-massive 
section 479.82-482.27 (2.45m) of pyrite, pyrrhotite, magnetite and trace chalcopyrite. The Mineralized Zone 
was intersected about 400 m vertical depth below the surface. 
 
The Mineralized Zone consists of a 2.45m core of massive to semi-massive pyrite (pyrrhotite) within a 14.68m 
layer of fine grained massive to thinly layered magnetite. Some of the magnetite is fine grained and 
disseminated. The core just above the sulphides is massive magnetite, with blebs and stringers of chalcopyrite. 
Within the sulphide and adjacent magnetite zone there are erratically scattered euhedral porphroblasts of pale 
off white talc. 
The results indicate a strongly mineralized zone approximately 15m thick (not true thickness) that could change 
at depth into copper-zinc mineralization. The drill core thickness should be increased to NQ size to take care of 
the excessive flattening when BQ core size was used. Also at least one hole should be drilled behind MCF-07-
78 to intersect the mineralized zone at a vertical depth of 650m. 

 39



The gravity anomaly below the main mineralization is still a viable target for additional copper-zinc reserves.  
 
10.3.2.7 MCF-07-79 
 
This hole was designed to under  cut MCF-05-56 by 75m (on L7+50E) and 25m down dip and to the west of 
MCF-05-59 (7.9%Cu over 8m) and 25m west of 04-29 (4.4% over 2.9m). The hole hit the mineralized Zone at 
360.58-384.55m. The majority of mineralization consists of disseminated and thin bands of massive fine 
grained magnetite. The lower 1.5m had less magnetite and erratic small patches and disseminated pyrite and 
trace chalcopyrite combined < 1%. Locally the pyrite can reach 2-3% near the lower contact. The results were 
disappointing and suggested a drastic reduction in copper-zinc mineralization to the southwest.  
 
10.3.2.8 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The drilling was divided into three stages: a) Drilling at depth for copper rich mineralization west of L8+00E; 
b) the deep drilling to test a gravity anomaly along line L9+50E (down rake to the NE) and L7+75E and c) 
shallow drilling to test the mineralization above that found in MCF-04-41(164.28-183.30m). From the 
beginning there was a problem with excessive flattening of the deep holes resulting in the drill holes 
intersecting the Mineralization Zone above the original target. The following are the salient conclusions: 
 

• The deep drilling on L7+75E and L9+50E did not adequately test the deep gravity anomaly identified 
by JVX which extended to about 500m below the surface. 

• FW-07-75 and 76 confirmed the upward extension of the copper and zinc mineralization on L8 
 
 

 

11 DRILLING 
 
The next phase of drill occurred in January-February-March 2006 when 3 core holes were drilled testing 
EM and magnetic targets located on the Freewest Claims and three holes on the Spider West Claim Block. 
The results are presented in the pervious section. 

 In five field seasons 10 individual VMS occurrences have been discovered and drill-tested, some with 
only a single hole. Seven of these contain VMS-style sulfide zones. In addition to the original discovery 
(McFaulds #1) a second significant mineralized occurrence was discovered in late 2003, McFaulds #3. 
This occurrence is 1.5km SW of McFaul's #1 and has been intersected by 31 holes, all of which contained 
massive sulphides. The widest intersection, and the last hole drilled in the 2004 field season, intersected 
18.8 meters containing 8.02% copper at a vertical depth of 250 meters. In 2005 summer and winter 
drilling more or less outlined a VMS copper-zinc deposit at McFaulds #3 with dimensions of a maximum 
of 45m thick by 250m long and about 300m depth. More drilling has to be done at McFaulds #1 presently 
the next most significant VMS target. 

The exploration program to date supports Dr. Jim Franklin's initial review and comments on the area, that 
were originally made during the summer of 2003 (full text available on Spider's website 
www.spiderresources.com ) "In summary the area intersected by the drill holes contains evidence of a 
large hydrothermal system, and the potential for discovery of an economic Cu-Zn (Noranda-style) 
volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit is good." He goes on to state " This part of the Sachigo Belt, 
although exceptionally poorly known, may contain a typical distribution of VMS deposits; this includes 
one giant (25 million tonnes) deposit and 3 to 8 smaller (1 – 5 mt) deposits, based on a comparison with 
other better known productive belts. Much more knowledge about the nature of the physical volcanism is 
needed to refine this estimate." It is UC's belief that this area has the signatures of a Matagami or

Noranda-type VMS setting, as widespread VMS style sulphide zones have been discovered as the result of 
the work completed by Spider and KWG over the past 5 years 

To date, in excess of $9 million has been expended on the project of which 47 drill holes, totaling nearly 
15,000 meters have been drilled on the McFauld's #1 and #3 occurrences. Down hole IP, coupled with 
surface geophysics (Max-Min) delineated the surface expression of both occurrences, confirmatory 
drilling has traced both occurrences below the detection limits of the surface and down-hole geophysics. 
Gravimetric surveying was completed late in the program (winter 2006), focusing on the McFauld's #3 
occurrence. Excess mass, not explained by the size of the sulphide body that has been drill tested to date, is 
evident in the gravity survey results, identifying a high specific gravity anomaly that tops out at 600 
meters below surface, although more gravity work needs to be completed to close the gravity anomaly. 
Diamond drilling has only effectively tested this zone to 400 meters depth. Deep drilling has been 
recommended and is contingent on completion of deep imaging geophysical surveying as required to 
position drill holes to intercept any conductive targets below or nearby the two main occurrences. 
Successfully intersecting massive sulphide mineralization below McFauld's #3 would infer a large VMS 
target and could also explain the excess mass evident in the gravity survey. UC plans on aggressively 
pursuing this mineralized zone to depth.  

Following are some of the highlights (as reported in Spider Resources Inc. press releases on the identified 
dates) of these two occurrences over the course of the exploration program: 

McFauld's #1 (16 holes drilled to date, 4,720 meters) 

• Oct 23, 2003: SP3-03-007 intersected 8 meters averaging 1.6% Cu  
• May 21, 2003: McF-03-08 intersected 5.68 meters averaging 3.39% Cu, followed by 4.1 meters 

averaging 7.64% Zn.  
• April 9, 2003: McF-03-01 undercut SP3-03-007 intersected 1.43% Cu over 8.9 m, followed by 

1.79% Zn over 4.7 m. 

McFauld's #3 (31 holes drilled to date, 10,169 meters) 

• Nov 8 2004: McF-04-57 18.8 meters of 8.02% Copper  
• Oct 27, 2003: Mc-03-18 discovery hole intersected multiple zones, enriched in Zinc, averaged 

4.83% Zn over 25.75 meters (also 0.51% Cu)  
• May 11, 2004: McF-04-41 8.0 meters of 6.5% Copper and 3.3% Zinc  
• March 18, 2004: McF-04-21 13.8 meters of 5.50% Copper  

UC is in the process of developing a $1 million exploration program with the intent of tracing the 
McFauld's #3 occurrence to depth, beyond the known depths of mineralization (this occurrence has been 
drilled to around 400 meters depth). The initial UC program will focus on geophysical surveys, including, 
but not limited to gravimetric and deep imaging electromagnetic surveying. Timing of the geophysical 
surveys is contingent on equipment availability. The gravimetric survey is best done under winter 
conditions, while deep imaging electromagnetic sounding can be done year round. It is expected that the 
gravimetric program will commence in late March to early April and the electromagnetic survey will 
commence in June. Community consultation meetings are currently scheduled for mid-May where UC 
will be introduced as a new joint venture partner of Spider and KWG on the McFauld's Project. Diamond 
drilling will follow after the two aforementioned geophysical surveys are completed. 

The McFauld's VMS occurrences consist primarily of stringer copper-style mineralization associated with 
intense talc-chlorite alteration. The alteration at McFauld's is very similar to that observed in stringer 

 41



zones in the Matagami Lake and Noranda districts, Quebec. Its intensity and the high copper contents in 
the McFauld's occurrences attests to these having formed from a series of well-focused, high-temperature 
systems. Such stringer systems typically have associated, but structurally separated zinc zones. Searching 
for these, as well as additional copper mineralization will be a priority of the next round of geophysical 
surveying and drilling.                                                                                                                                    
In 2008 UC Resources was planning to do more drilling of EM and magnetic anomalies that have not been 
drill yet. 

 
12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

The mineralized horizon was assayed by measuring out intercepts that represent different visible 
amounts of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, magnetite, pyrite and pyrrhotite. This was done to get a 
better understanding of the distribution of copper and zinc with attended concentration of silver 
and gold within the mineralized horizon. To check on possible geochemical anomalies that may 
bracket the mineralized horizon the contact area of the host rock was sampled and assay. No 
rigorous cut-off grades were applied.  

As of April 2004 a total of 929 core samples were selected for assaying. An additional 536 core 
samples were selected for assaying in the summer-fall of 2004 and the winter of 2005. In the 
winter of 2006 and summer 2006 an additional 250 samples were collected. Samples were 
collected for assaying from both the MH and rock on either side. The nominal assay interval was 
1.5m but varied from 0.3 m to 2.5 m (out side of the mineralized zone) within the mineralized 
zone the sampling reflected discrete bands of different types of mineralization i.e. chalcopyrite 
rich bands, sphalerite or bands primarily of pyrite, pyrrhotite or magnetite. However, in order not 
to cross lithological, structural, degree and type of alteration contacts, if recognizable, or the 
amount of sulphides present, sampling was restricted to staying within the contact boundaries. No 
drilling, core recovery or other factor was recorded that might impact the accuracy and reliability 
of the results or introduce a sample bias. A rock-cutting saw with a diamond-impregnated blade 
was used to cut the assay intervals. The water to lubricated and cool the blade was changed after 
each diamond drill hole. To reduce any possible bias during the cutting of the assay interval, a 
line was put on the core and the sample selected for assay always taken from the same side. 
(Note: lost core was not an issue as the core recovery was better than 99 %.) The summary of the 
various drill holes with the sample interval and average assay grade is given in Table 2 and 3. 
The true thickness of each mineralized intercept was not estimated. 

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

All samples were cut in a separate tent at the McFaulds Lake camp. Only authorized personnel 
were allowed access to this facility. Each assay sample was placed in a durable plastic bag with a 
uniquely numbered assay tag and sealed with a nylon tie wrap. Seven (7) to nine (9) assay 
samples were then placed in a rice bag and sealed with a unique orange plastic security tie so no 
sample could be removed without cutting the security tag.  The rice bags were then placed and 
sealed in 20-gallon plastic pails, flown to Nakina and then stored in a secure building until 
shipped by courier to the ALS Chemex Laboratory in Thunder Bay Ontario. The sample 
preparation and assaying in 2004 and 2005 were the same as done in 2003 and the winter-spring 
of 2004. ALS Chemex prepared the samples (Prep Code 31) in their sample preparation facility 
in Thunder Bay Ontario. The sample preparation procedure involves the following steps; logging 

 42



each sample into their computer tracking system with a unique bar code, drying the sample, fine 
crushing the sample to better than 70% <2mm, splitting off a 250gm sub-sample and then 
pulverizing the sample to better than 85% passing through a 75 micron screen. After the samples 
have been crushed, pulverized and homogenized a sub-sample was sent to the ALS Chemex main 
laboratory in Vancouver BC. 

In Vancouver all 536 samples were assayed for copper, zinc, gold and silver and a separate 
analytical method was used to determine Cu, Zn Ag, and an additional 47 elements by code MS-
61. This method uses a 4 acid digestion with the metal elements determined by ICP-ES. The 
detection limits for Ag is 0.2 to 100 ppm, Cu 0.2 to 10,000 ppm, 2 to 10,000 ppm for Zn and 0.5 
to 10,000 ppm for Pb.  Gold analysis was done by fire assay (Au ICP21) by using a 30gm sub-
sample with the final determination done by ICP-MS. The detection limit by this method is 0.001 
to 2 ppm. Over limits for Zn and Cu were re-assayed using code Cu AA62 for copper and code 
Zn AA62 for zinc. The upper limit for both of these methods was 30% contained metal. 

All of the ALS Chemex's laboratories have attained ISO 9002 accreditation. They have put into 
place a rigorous in-house QA/QC system to prevent cross contamination between samples. An 
important step in the system includes the use of a barren quartz rich wash material between 
sample batches and when necessary between highly mineralized samples. The glassware was 
thoroughly cleaned, and glassware used in high gold assays was discarded. All crucibles used to 
determine high gold assays were destroyed. To ensure acceptable quality control and assurance 
ALS Chemex employs a program that uses sample blanks, sample duplicates, and standard 
samples on a routine bases. Details regarding the ALS Chemex QA/QC programs may be found 
on their www.alschemex.com.  

It is the Author's opinion that the sampling, sample security, sample preparation and sample 
analysis methods employed in this exploration program are sound. The sample preparation and 
analytical methods were obtained from ALS Chemex Laboratories and are given below.

The bead is digested in 0.5 mL dilute nitric acid in the microwave oven. 0.5 mL concentrated 
hydrochloric acid is then added and the bead is further digested in the microwave at a lower 
power setting.  The digested solution is cooled, diluted to a total volume of 4 mL with de-
mineralized water, and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry 
against matrix-matched standards.

14 DATA VERIFICATION AND SECURITY 

No samples were taken for comparative purposes a) since the Author was intimately involved 
with both the summer-fall 2004, Winter 2005 and Winter 2006 exploration programs and b) ALS 
Chemex have stringent QC/QA as well as contamination prevention procedures in place. The 
remaining half of the cut core that was sampled and crushed had sample rejects that are available 
for any future data corroboration requirements.

16 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

In August 2007, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was 
retained by Spider Resource Inc. to assist in the preparation of a preliminary resource estimate for 
the McFaulds Lake property in northern Ontario. For details see APPENDIX 2. 

 
 
 

17 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Since 2002 seventy nine diamond drill holes have been drilled on the McFaulds VMS Property 
discovering ten VMS deposits and prospects. Seven have been identified as McFaulds #1 to 7 with the 
three others not identified by a name. Out of the seventy nine holes 59 were drilled at McFaulds #3 and #1 
with the rest testing MaxMin and VTEM geophysical anomalies in both the East and West claim blocks.  
The drilling has identified one or more sulphide-magnetite mineralized horizons that extend for over 25 
km in a northeast –southwest direction within a greenstone belt. The most prospective location is the 
contact zone between quartz-feldspar porphyry and volcanoclastics and tuffs. The mineralization is found 
within an intense envelope of black magnesium rich chlorite with disseminated talc. In the footwall 
quartz-feldspar porphyry side as one gets near the mineralized horizon there is an increase in silicification 
and potassic (kspar) alteration. At McFaulds #5 and #6 the drilling encountered felsic agglomerates, flow 
breccia and locally very intense sericite and potassic alteration. However, the limited drilling did not find 
any significant VMS mineralization. Dr. James Franklin has visited the property twice examining the 
drilling from McFaulds #3 and #1. In his reports he states that the copper rich mineralization represents a 
stringer feeder zone that vented into a deep water depression. Also the mineralization occurs in a very 
extensive alteration zone indicating a large system. Furthermore he states that there is a good possibility to 
discover many VMS deposits some which could be in the millions of tons. This mineralization package is 
very similar to the prolific Matagami VMS camp in Quebec. 
Since geophysical surveys are an indirect method of detecting targets and cannot alone so drilling must be 
used to examine the targets. The original drilling by De Beers was to test kimberlite targets i.e. small 
circular magnetic anomalies that were or were not conductive. In drilling one of the targets McFaulds #1 
was discovered in 2002. In 2006 while drilling a magnetic anomaly with a coincident conductor two 
layered massive chromite bands were intersect approximately 150m down the hole. What makes this 
discovery interesting is that the chromite bands have a grade of 20 to 23% Cr and one of the bands graded 
0.75ppm platinum- palladium and lesser quantities of rhodium and ruthenium. Further down the hole 
anomalous gold was found in a quartz vein. 
There are no outcrops in this area so all of the exploration to date has depended on the geophysical 
methods MaxMin, VLF, Magnetics, down-the-hole IP, gravity, Airborne EM and the new deep 
penetrating VTEM technology.  
Form the exploration work to date the following conclusions can be made. 

• There is a VMS prospective zone that extends from the eastern edge of the East Claim Block, 
hosting 7 VMS deposits to the West Claim Block and the contiguous Freewest claims. 

 48



• Extensive silicification, potassic (kspar), chlorite and sericite alteration has been observed at all 
VMS targets that have been drilled. This suggests a very large area of alteration usually associated 
with VMS camps found in Canada. 

• The two best VMS targets are McFaulds #3 and #1. 
• The felsic tuffs, agglomerates, flow breccia and alteration make the McFaulds #5 and #6 and 

surrounding area very prospective for hosting a new VMS deposit. 
• The McFaulds Property is prospective for VMS, chromite, gold and diamond (kimberlite Kyle 

Type) deposits. 
 
18 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The following exploration work plan is recommended. 
 

• A complete compilation and interpretation of all of the geophysical data acquired to date. 
• Because several geologists have logged the drill core from the McFaulds Property all of 

the core should be re-logged.  
• More drilling must be done at McFaulds #3 and McFaulds #1 and the area between the two VMS 

deposits in order to determine ore reserves compliant with the standards of NI43 101. 
• There is a gravity anomaly indicated at McFaulds #3 and #1 and the area in between. This gravity 

anomaly should be test at a vertical depth of 500m or deeper. 
• Taking into account the new interpretation of the geophysical information and the 

recommendations drill some of the best targets. 
 
 
19 BUDGET 
 
For the summer and fall of 2008 it is planned to re-establish previously cut grids, and to test the 
gravity feature at McFaulds #3 at a vertical depth of at least 500m. Other EM and magnetic 
conductors will also be drilled. The work will be conducted out of the McFaulds Lake Camp and 
will be supported by a helicopter and turbo Otters.

SUBJECT: MCFAULDS LAKE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

DATE: JULY 10, 2008 
 
 
 
In August 2007, Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was 

retained by Spider Resource Inc. to assist in the preparation of a preliminary resource 
estimate for the McFaulds Lake property in northern Ontario.  

 
As per our discussion on July 9, 2008, we understand the independent Qualified 

Person (QP) for this resource estimate will be Howard Lahti, P.Geo who will be taking 
full responsibility for the estimate and any associated disclosure.   

 
The text below describes the procedures used to estimate the resources.

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

SUMMARY 
The preliminary estimates were based on 39 diamond core holes for the McFaulds 3 
deposit totalling 12,114 metres in length and on 15 diamond core holes for the McFaulds 
1 deposit totalling 4,715 metres in length. 
 
At a cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu, Indicated resources at the McFaulds 3 deposit are 
estimated to total 802,000 tonnes grading 3.75% Cu and 1.1% Zn.  At the McFaulds 1 
deposit, Inferred resources are estimated at 279,000 tonnes grading 2.13% Cu and 0.58% 
Zn. 
 
A set of cross sections and plan views were interpreted for both deposits to construct 
three-dimensional wireframe models at a cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu and a minimum true 
thickness of two metres. These criteria reflect a potential underground mining scenario. 
High copper and zinc grades were capped at 12.0% Cu and 8% Zn at McFaulds 3 and at 
5% Cu and 7% Zn at McFaulds 1 prior to compositing to 1.5 metres. Variogram 
parameters were interpreted from the composited assay values. Block model copper and 
zinc grades within the wireframe models were estimated by ordinary Kriging for the 
McFaulds 3 deposit and by inverse distance squared for the McFaulds 1 deposit.  
Classification into the Indicated and Inferred categories was guided by the drill hole 
density, interpreted variogram ranges, the apparent continuity of the mineralized zones, 
and by available density determinations.

lithology and assays was stored in comma delimited format.  This drill hole information 
was modified slightly so as to be compatible with the format requirements of the 
Gemcom-Surpac v6.0.3 mine planning software and was imported into that software 
package.  A number of additional tables were created during the process of creating a 
grade block model of the mineralization found at the McFaulds 3 deposit to store such 
information as zone composites and assorted domain codes.  A description of the revised 
database is provided in Table 1.

A total of 39 drill holes were contained in this database which were completed to 
examine for the extent of the mineralization found in the McFaulds 3 Zone at the 
McFaulds Lake Project.  A drill hole collar plan of these drill holes is presented in Figure 
1 and a listing of the drill hole collar information is provided in Table 2.

Lithology Model 
 
The copper-zinc mineralization contained within this deposit class occurs in two settings 
1) as accumulations of Cu-Zn bearing sulphide minerals upon an old sea floor and 2) as 
copper rich stringer-style sulphides that are typically situated in the footwall stratigraphic 
units (exceptions occur in stacked deposit settings).  Consequently, an important step in 
preparation of a mineral resource estimate for this deposit type is the construction of a 
lithologic model that attempts to define the location and extent of any paleo-seafloor 
settings, and searches for the presence of any stringer-style mineralization in either 
footwall or hangingwall rocks. 
 
To this end, drill hole lithologies were colour coded according to the logging codes 
assigned by the field geologists and were examined in a series of vertical cross sections 
Assay information for copper and zinc assays were also displayed in an attempt to 
highlight any occurrences of stringer-style mineralization.   It can be seen that the bi-
modal, Archean-aged volcanic stratigraphy sits below units of flat-lying chemical and 
clastic sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age and Quaternary-aged glacial materials that 
combined total some 30-50 metres in thickness.  The mineralized intervals encountered 
by the drill holes have been assigned such codes as Su or Mz, which field examination 
have shown to correspond to intervals of talc-rich materials.  It can be seen that for the 
most part, these talc-rich intervals occur as a steeply dipping plane that has a general 
azimuth of 045˚ and dips approximately 60˚ to the north west (Figure 2).  For the 

 5



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 
purposes of this assignment, these talc-rich intervals are interpreted as accumulations of 
material on a paleo-seafloor sitting either as sedimentary layers on the old seafloor, as 
filling material of local basins and depressions, and as mounds that develop as a result of 
hydrothermal processes  (J. Franklin, pers. comm.).  Indeed, the tabular, steeply dipping 
nature of this talc horizon is distinctly disrupted in the central portions of the deposit, 
possibly resulting from either structural or hydrothermal events (Figure 3).

Models of these main lithologic units (the glacial materials, the Paleozoic sediments, and 
the Archean-aged talc-rich horizons) were created on vertical cross sections that were 
oriented to azimuth 315˚ and were spaced at 25 metre intervals (viewing windows of +/- 
12.5 metres).  The locations of the contacts were "snapped" to the observed location in 
the individual drill holes such that the sectional interpretations "wobbled" in three 
dimensional space.  In all, interpretation was carried out on 11 cross sections, and the 
resulting "wobbly polylines" were then linked together to form a three-dimensional solid 
of the talc-rich horizon (Figure 4).

Trend Analysis 
 
An analysis of the trends of the various components of the mineralization such as copper 
and zinc grades and mineralization thickness was conducted to assist in the understanding 
of the spatial distribution of these items within the limit of the mineralized domain.  In 
order to complete this task, the composite copper and zinc values contained within the 
three-dimensional model of the talc-rich horizon were extracted from the database and 
the true widths of the talc-rich horizon in each of the drill holes was determined on cross 
sections displayed on the computer screen, as the drill holes have intersected the 
mineralization at varying angles.  In the cases where a drill hole did not penetrate the 
lower contact of the mineralization, the assay information for that drill hole was excluded 
from the data set.  A summary of the resulting data is presented in Table 3.

* ETW=Estimated True Width 
 
The revised data points were projected in plan view for treatment and analysis.  Due to 
the dip of the mineralization towards the north west, projection of the pierce points from 
the dipping talc-rich horizon vertical viewing plane will result in a small degree of 
foreshortening, however  Scott Wilson RPA  believes that the amount of foreshortening 
that occurs does not materially affect the conclusions forthcoming from this exercise.  
Contoured images of copper and zinc grades and true thickness are presented in Figures 
5, 6 and 7, respectively.

SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 
It can be seen that the copper values appear to be concentrated in three areas within the 
talc-rich horizon while the zinc values appear to be more concentrated in the upper, north 
east portions of the talc-rich horizon, correlating with one of the sections of higher copper 
grades.  In terms of thicknesses of the talc-rich horizon, it can be seen that the thicknesses 
reach a maximum estimated true width of 28 metres in drill hole MCF-04-2, and that this 
thick section shows a trend that plunges steeply to the north east.

Domain Model Construction 
 
The trends resulting from the trend analysis were used as guides to construct a domain 
model of the distribution of copper and zinc values within the talc-rich horizon.  This 
domain model was constructed on the same cross sections as were used to construct the 
model for the talc-rich horizon using a nominal threshold of 1.5% Cu and the limits of the 
talc-rich horizon as constraints.  Once again, the interpretations were "snapped" to 
individual points in space in the cross sectional views, and the cross sectional 
interpretations were then joined together to form a three-dimensional model of the 
copper-zinc mineralization (Figure 8).

Cut Off Grade Estimate 
 
Development of the McFaulds 3 deposit would require an underground mining method 
given its depth below surface and geometry.  Scott Wilson RPA assumes that part of the 
deposit would be amenable to long-hole methods while other parts would require narrow 
vein mining.  Scott Wilson RPA used a breakeven cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu.  Assuming a 
copper recovery of 85% and a copper price of US$2.50/lb, this break-even grade equates 
to gross in-situ value of $70/t.   
 
Grade Capping 
 
All of the raw samples contained within the copper-zinc mineralized domain were coded 
and extracted from the database for examination.  The descriptive statistics of these 
samples are provided in Table 4 and frequency histograms of the raw assays contained 
within the copper-zinc domain model are presented in Figures 9 and 10.  Based upon the 
distribution of the copper and zinc grades, SWRAP believes that the selection of 12% Cu 
and 8% Zn are appropriate capping values for this sub-domain.

Compositing Methods 
 
The selection of an appropriate composite length for samples contained within the copper 
domain model began with an examination of the relationship of the copper grades vs the 
sample length to check for any grade bias introduced due to short sample lengths (Figure 
11).  It can be seen that the sample lengths ranged from a minimum of 0.2 metres to a 
maximum of 2.1 metres in length, with many samples being (Figure 12).  The highest 
copper grades generally occur with samples that are in the 1.0 to 1.5 metre range and the 
most frequent sample length was 1.5 metres.  As a result,  Scott Wilson RPA  selected a 
composite length of 1.5 metres for this domain. 
 
All samples were composited to an equal length of 1.5 metres using the downhole 
compositing function of the Surpac-Gemcom mine modelling software.  In this function, 
compositing begins at the point in a drill hole at which the zone of interest is encountered 
and continues down the length of the hole until the end of the zone of interest is reached.  
As often happens, the thickness of the mineralized zone encountered by any given drill 
hole is not an equal multiple of the composite length.  In these cases, if the remaining 
length was 75% or greater of the composite length (in this case 1.125 metres), the 
composite was accepted as part of the data set.  The remaining sample lengths less than 
75% of the composite length were discarded from consideration.  A comparison of the 
descriptive statistics for the capped and uncapped sample values for the composited data 
is presented in Table 5.

Bulk Density Determinations 
 
The bulk density of the various lithologies encountered by the diamond drill holes were 
determined and were recorded in the digital data base.  The densities for all samples that 
were contained within the copper domain were identified in the database, and the sample 
information was extracted for examination.  In all, 38 samples containing density 
information were contained within the copper domain model.  Their descriptive statistics 
are presented in Table 6 and a frequency histogram is presented in Figure 13.  On the 
basis of the 38 density determinations,  Scott Wilson RPA  believes that a density of 4.01 
g/cm3 is appropriate for this material.

Variography 
 
Examination of the variographic characteristics of the copper and zinc grades contained 
within the copper domain model began with the construction of an omni-directional 
variogram using the capped, composited data set.  The search for any anisotropies 

 17



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 
contained within the data set revealed that the direction of maximum continuity for the 
copper data was directly down-dip.  Little to no anisotropy was found for the zinc data.  
A summary of the best variographic parameters determined for the copper-zinc domain is 
presented in Table 7.

All blocks contained within either the talc-rich domain or the copper-zinc domain were 
coded with respective codes for use in the subsequent interpolation steps. Values for 
average densities for the talc-rich and copper domains were assigned to the respective 
blocks.  Copper and zinc grades were interpolated for the copper domain using the copper 
domain model as a hard boundary where only those capped, composited samples 
contained within the copper domain were included for the calculation of the block grade, 
and only those blocks contained within the boundaries of the copper domain were 
allowed to receive copper and zinc grades.  During the interpolation process for the 
copper and zinc grades, the distance to the nearest informing sample, the average distance 
of informing samples, and the number of informing samples per block were recorded in 
the respective attributes. 
 
Three interpolation methods were used to estimate the copper and zinc block grades:  
Inverse Distance, Power 2, Ordinary Kriging, and Nearest Neighbour.  The parameters 
used for these interpolation runs are presented in Tables 10 and 11.  A Search ellipse 
using a quadrant search, a minimum of 1 sample and a maximum of 5 composite samples 
and a discretization ration of 1:1:1 were used to estimate the block grades.

It is to be noted that application of the range of 70 metres for the zinc values resulted in 
an incomplete filling of the blocks within the copper-zinc domain model due to a variable 
drill hole spacing resulting from deviation of the drill holes (Figure 14).  The range of the 
search ellipse was increased to 100 metres to achieve a full fill of the zinc grades in the 
block model.

Block Model Validation 
 
The objective of the assignment was to prepare a global estimate of the mineral resources 
for the mineralization discovered at the McFaulds 3 deposit.  To this end, validation 
methods focused on comparing the overall volumes and average grades between the 
block model reports and the informing data.  The estimated copper grades using the three 
interpolation methods are compared to the informing composite data in Table 12 while 
the estimated zinc grades using the three interpolation methods are compared to the 
informing composite data in Table 13.  A comparison of the volumes reported from the 
solid model and the block model is presented in Table 14.

It can be seen that the average grades of the composite sample population is in good 
agreement with the block model average grades, suggesting that little clustering effect is 
present.  A slight difference (1,651 m3) is observed between the volume of the domain 
model and the block model report, however this difference is judged to not be of 
significance, as it amounts to slightly less than 1 % of the volume. 

 
It is to be noted that there is a degree of uncertainty to the estimation of mineral reserves 
and mineral resources and corresponding grades being mined or dedicated to future 
production. The estimating of mineralization is a subjective process and the accuracy of 
estimates is a function of the accuracy, quantity and quality of available data, the 
accuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in 
interpreting engineering and geological information. There is significant uncertainty in 
any mineral resource/mineral reserve estimate, and the actual deposits encountered and 
the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ significantly from our estimates. 
Until mineral reserves or mineral resources are actually mined and processed, the 
quantity of mineral resources/mineral reserves and their respective grades must be 
considered as estimates only. In addition, the quantity of mineral reserves and mineral 
resources may vary depending on, among other things, metal prices. Fluctuation in metal 
or commodity prices, results of additional drilling, metallurgical testing, receipt of new 
information, and production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of 
any mineral resource estimate may require revision of such estimate. 
 
Mineral Resource Classification Criteria 
 
The mineral resources in this report were estimated in accordance with the definitions 
contained in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines that were 
prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the 
CIM Council on December 11, 2005.  The mineral resources include all blocks located 
within the copper-zinc domain model.  Given the relatively high density of drill hole 

 22



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 
information relative to the ranges determined for continuity of copper and zinc grades,  
Scott Wilson RPA  believes that the material contained within the copper-zinc domain 
model is appropriately classified in the Indicated Resources category.  The mineral 
resources are summarized in Table 15.

MCFAULDS 1 - MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 

DESCRIPTION OF DATABASE 

A digital database was provided wherein such drill hole information as collar, survey, 
lithology and assays was stored in comma delimited format.  This drill hole information 
was modified slightly so as to be compatible with the format requirements of the 
Gemcom-Surpac v6.0.3 mine planning software and was imported into that software 
package.  A number of additional tables were created during the process of creating a 
grade block model of the mineralization found at the McFaulds 1 deposit to store such 
information as zone composites and assorted domain codes.  A description of the revised 
database is provided in Table 16.

Lithology Model 
 
The copper-zinc mineralization contained within this deposit class occurs in two settings 
1) as accumulations of Cu-Zn bearing sulphide minerals upon an old sea floor and 2) as 
copper rich stringer-style sulphides that are typically situated in the footwall stratigraphic 
units (exceptions occur in stacked deposit settings).  Consequently, an important step in 
preparation of a mineral resource estimate for this deposit type is the construction of a 
lithologic model that attempts to define the location and extent of any paleo-seafloor 

 25



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 
settings, and searches for the presence of any stringer-style mineralization in either 
footwall or hangingwall rocks. 
 
To this end, drill hole lithologies were colour coded according to the logging codes 
assigned by the field geologists and were examined in a series of vertical cross sections 
Assay information for copper and zinc assays were also displayed in an attempt to 
highlight any occurrences of stringer-style mineralization.   It can be seen that the bi-
modal, Archean-aged volcanic stratigraphy sits below units of flat-lying chemical and 
clastic sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age and Quaternary-aged glacial materials that 
combined total some 30-50 metres in thickness.  The mineralized intervals encountered 
by the drill holes have been assigned such codes as Su or Mz, which field examination 
have shown to correspond to intervals of talc-rich materials.  It can be seen that for the 
most part, these talc-rich intervals occur as a steeply dipping plane that has a general 
azimuth of 060˚ and dips approximately 70˚ to the northwest (Figure 16).  For the 
purposes of this assignment, these talc-rich intervals are interpreted as accumulations of 
material on a paleo-seafloor sitting either as sedimentary layers on the old seafloor, as 
filling material of local basins and depressions, and as mounds that develop as a result of 
hydrothermal processes  (J. Franklin, pers. comm.).

Rich Horizon, Looking North East. 
 

 
 
Models of these main lithologic units (the glacial materials, the Paleozoic sediments, and 
the Archean-aged talc-rich horizons) were created on vertical cross sections that were 
oriented to azimuth 330˚ and were spaced at 50 metre intervals (viewing windows of +/- 
25 metres).  The locations of the contacts were "snapped" to the observed location in the 
individual drill holes such that the sectional interpretations "wobbled" in three 
dimensional space.  In all, interpretation was carried out on 6 cross sections along a strike 
length of 300 metres and to a depth of approximately 300 metres, and the resulting 

 26

"wobbly polylines" were then linked together to form a three-dimensional solid of the 
talc-rich horizon (Figure 17).

Trend Analysis 
 
An analysis of the trends of the various components of the mineralization such as copper 
and zinc grades and mineralization thickness was conducted to assist in the understanding 
of the spatial distribution of these items within the limit of the mineralized domain.  In 
order to complete this task, the composite copper and zinc values contained within the 
three-dimensional model of the talc-rich horizon were extracted from the database and 
the true widths of the talc-rich horizon in each of the drill holes was determined on cross 
sections displayed on the computer screen, as the drill holes have intersected the 
mineralization at varying angles.  In the cases where a drill hole did not penetrate the 
lower contact of the mineralization, the assay information for that drill hole was excluded 
from the data set.  A summary of the resulting data is presented in Table 18.

*ETW=Estimated True Width 
 
The revised data points were projected in longitudinal view for treatment and analysis.  
Due to the dip of the mineralization towards the north west, projection of the pierce 
points from the dipping talc-rich horizon to a vertical viewing plane will result in a small 
degree of foreshortening, however  Scott Wilson RPA  believes that the amount of 
foreshortening that occurs does not materially affect the conclusions forthcoming from 
this exercise.  Contoured images of copper and zinc grades and true thickness are 
presented in Figures 18, 19 and 20, respectively.

Domain Model Construction 
 
The trends resulting from the trend analysis were used as guides to construct domain 
models of the distribution of copper and zinc values within the talc-rich horizon.  These 
domain models were constructed on the same cross sections as were used to construct the 
model for the talc-rich horizon using a nominal threshold of 1.5% Cu or 1% Zn and the 
limits of the talc-rich horizon as constraints.  Once again, the interpretations were 
"snapped" to individual points in space in the cross sectional views, and the cross 
sectional interpretations were then joined together to form a three-dimensional model of 
the copper-zinc mineralization (Figure 21).

Cut Off Grade Estimate 
 
Development of the McFaulds 1 deposit would require an underground mining method 
given its depth below surface and geometry.  Scott Wilson RPA assumes that part of the 
deposit would be amenable to long-hole methods while other parts would require narrow 
vein mining.  Scott Wilson RPA used a breakeven cut-off grade of 1.5% Cu.  Assuming a 
copper recovery of 85% and a copper price of US$2.50/lb, this break-even grade equates 
to gross in-situ value of $70/t.   
 
 
Grade Capping 
 
All of the raw samples contained within the copper and zinc mineralized domains were 
coded and extracted from the database for examination.  The descriptive statistics of these 
samples are provided in Table 19 and frequency histograms of the raw assays contained 
within the copper and zinc domain models are presented in Figures 22 and 23.  Based 
upon the distribution of the copper and zinc grades, SWRAP believes that the selection of 
5% Cu and 7% Zn are appropriate capping values for this sub-domain.

Compositing Methods 
 
The selection of an appropriate composite length for samples contained within the copper 
domain model began with an examination of the relationship of the copper and zinc 
grades vs the sample length within the respective domain models to check for any grade 
bias introduced due to short sample lengths (Figures 24 and 25).  It can be seen that the 
sample lengths ranged from a minimum of 0.5 metres to a maximum of 2.5 metres in 
length for the copper domain, with many samples being 1.5 metres in length (Figure 26).  
The highest copper grades generally occur with samples that are in the 1.0 to 1.5 metre 
range and the most frequent sample length was 1.5 metres.  As a result,  Scott Wilson 
RPA  selected a composite length of 1.5 metres for the copper domain.  Similarly, it can 
be seen that the sample lengths ranged from a minimum of 0.75 metres to a maximum of 
2.5 metres in length for the zinc domain, with many samples being 1.5 metres in length 
(Figure 27).  The highest zinc grades generally occur with samples that are in the 1.0 to 
1.5 metre range and the most frequent sample length was 1.5 metres.  As a result,  Scott 
Wilson RPA  selected a composite length of 1.5 metres for the zinc domain. 
 
All samples were composited to an equal length of 1.5 metres using the downhole 
compositing function of the Surpac-Gemcom mine modelling software.  In this function, 
compositing begins at the point in a drill hole at which the zone of interest is encountered 
and continues down the length of the hole until the end of the zone of interest is reached.  
As often happens, the thickness of the mineralized zone encountered by any given drill 
hole is not an equal multiple of the composite length.  In these cases, if the remaining 
length was 75% or greater of the composite length (in this case 1.125 metres), the 
composite was accepted as part of the data set.  The remaining sample lengths less than 
75% of the composite length were discarded from consideration.  A comparison of the

Bulk Density Determinations 
 
No bulk density information was gathered for the McFaulds 1 deposit.   Scott Wilson 
RPA  recommends that the bulk densities for samples contained within the mineralized 
domains, along with the enclosing talc-rich horizon, be determined.  For the purposes of 
this assignment, an average density of 3.5 g/cm3 is chosen on the basis its experience 
with the average bulk densities for this deposit type. 
 
Variography 
 
Examination of the variographic characteristics of the copper and zinc grades contained 
within the copper domain model began with the construction of down-hole and omni-
directional variograms using the capped, composited data set.  A search for any 
anisotropies contained within the data set was then undertaken, which resulted in no valid 
variograms.  Consequently the interpolation of block grades was accomplished by 
application of the Inverse Distance, Power 2 algorithm using the parameters presented in 
Table 22.  These parameters were derived by taking the spatial orientation of the 
respective domain models.

Block Model Construction 
 
An upright, rotated block model was created with the parameters presented in Table 23.  
A number of attributes were created within this block model to store such information as 
copper and zinc grades, distance to nearest informing sample, average distance of 
informing samples and the number of informing samples per block (Table 24).

All blocks contained within either the copper-rich domain or the zinc-rich domain were 
coded with respective codes for use in the subsequent interpolation steps.  Copper and 
zinc grades were interpolated for the copper domain using the copper domain model as a 
hard boundary where only those capped, composited samples contained within the copper 
domain were included for the calculation of the block grade, and only those blocks 
contained within the boundaries of the copper domain were allowed to receive copper 
and zinc grades.  Similarly, copper and zinc grades were interpolated for the zinc domain 
using the zinc domain model as a hard boundary where only those capped, composited 
samples contained within the zinc domain were included for the calculation of the block 
grade, and only those blocks contained within the boundaries of the zinc domain were 
allowed to receive copper and zinc grades.  During the interpolation process for the 
copper and zinc grades, the distance to the nearest informing sample, the average distance 
of informing samples, and the number of informing samples per block were recorded in 
the respective attributes. 
 
The Inverse Distance, Power 2 method was used to interpolate grades into the respective 
blocks using the parameters presented in Table 22 above.  A search ellipse using a 
quadrant search, a minimum of 1 sample and a maximum of 5 composite samples and a 
discretization ration of 1:1:1 were used to estimate the block grades. 
 
Block Model Validation 
 
The objective of the assignment was to prepare a global estimate of the mineral resources 
for the mineralization discovered at the McFaulds 1 deposit.  To this end, validation 
methods focused on comparing the overall volumes and average grades between the 
block model reports and the informing data.  The estimated copper and zinc grades for 
the copper domain are compared to the informing composite data in Table 25 while the 
estimated copper and zinc grades for the zinc domain are compared to the informing 
composite data in Table 26.

It can be seen that the average grades of the composite sample population is in good 
agreement with the block model average grades for both modeled domains, suggesting 
that little clustering effect is present.  A slight difference (74 m3) is observed between the 
volume of the copper domain model and the block model report, however this difference 
is judged to not be of significance, as it amounts to slightly less than 1 % of the volume.  
The volume of the zinc domain block model report is in good agreement with the solid 
model volume 

 
It is to be noted that there is a degree of uncertainty to the estimation of mineral reserves 
and mineral resources and corresponding grades being mined or dedicated to future 
production. The estimating of mineralization is a subjective process and the accuracy of 
estimates is a function of the accuracy, quantity and quality of available data, the 
accuracy of statistical computations, and the assumptions used and judgments made in 
interpreting engineering and geological information. There is significant uncertainty in 
any mineral resource/mineral reserve estimate, and the actual deposits encountered and 
the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ significantly from our estimates. 
Until mineral reserves or mineral resources are actually mined and processed, the 
quantity of mineral resources/mineral reserves and their respective grades must be 
considered as estimates only. In addition, the quantity of mineral reserves and mineral 
resources may vary depending on, among other things, metal prices. Fluctuation in metal 
or commodity prices, results of additional drilling, metallurgical testing, receipt of new 
information, and production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of 
any mineral resource estimate may require revision of such estimate. 
 
Mineral Resource Classification Criteria 
 
The mineral resources in this report were estimated in accordance with the definitions 
contained in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines that were 
prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the 
CIM Council on December 11, 2005.  The mineral resources include all blocks located 
within the copper or zinc domain models.  Given the lack of density information for these 
materials, the determination of the tonnages in the respective domains has a high degree 
of uncertainty, consequently  Scott Wilson RPA  believes that the material contained 
within the copper and zinc domain models is appropriately classified in the Inferred 
Resources category.  The mineral resources are summarized in Table 27.
