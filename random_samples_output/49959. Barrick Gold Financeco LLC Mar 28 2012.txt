1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) 

to prepare an independent Technical Report on the Pueblo Viejo Project (the Project) 

located in the Dominican Republic.  The purpose of this report is to support disclosure of 

the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for the Project as of December 31, 2011.  

This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 

Projects.  RPA visited the Project on March 14 to 17, 2011. 

 

Barrick is a Canadian publicly traded mining company with a portfolio of operating mines 

and projects across five continents.  Pueblo Viejo, a precious and base metal deposit, is 

located in the central part of the Dominican Republic on the Caribbean island of 

Hispaniola in the province of Sanchez Ramirez.  The Project is 15 km west of the 

provincial capital of Cotuí and approximately 100 km northwest of the national capital of 

Santo Domingo.  Barrick controls 60% of the mineral rights to the Pueblo Viejo deposit 

and Goldcorp Inc. (Goldcorp) holds the remaining 40%.  Pueblo Viejo Dominicana 

Corporation (PVDC) is the operating company for the joint venture partners. 

 

The Pueblo Viejo Project comprises development of a 24,000 tpd mining and processing 

facility.  The mine will consist of two open pits, Moore and Monte Negro, and will be 

mined by conventional truck and shovel method.  The mine life will be 18 years, with 

total material movement of approximately 47 Mtpa.  Lower grade ore will be stockpiled 

for later processing, resulting in a forecasted processing life of the Project of 36 years. 

 

Table 1-1 summarizes the Pueblo Viejo Mineral Resources exclusive of Mineral 

Reserves as of December 31, 2011.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 
2. Mineral Resources are estimated at a break-even cut-off grade that equates to between 1.3 g/t Au 

and 1.4 g/t Au. 
3. Mineral Resources are estimated using a long-term price of US$1,400/oz Au, US$28.00/oz Ag, and 

US$3.25/lb copper. 
4. There are also zinc resources that have not been converted to Mineral Reserves. 
5. A minimum mining width (block size) of 10 m was used. 
6. Mineral Resources are exclusive of resources converted to Mineral Reserves. 
7. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
8. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 

 

Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves for the Project, contained in the Moore and 

Monte Negro pits, are listed in Table 1-2.

2. No cut-off grade is applied. Instead, the profit of each block in the Mineral Resource is calculated 

and included in the reserve if the value is positive. 
3. Mineral Reserves are estimated using an average long-term gold price of US$1,200 per ounce. 
4. Totals may not add due to rounding. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 
Based on RPA's site visit, interviews with Pueblo Viejo personnel, and subsequent 

review of gathered information, RPA offers the following conclusions: 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

• The Pueblo Viejo deposits are high sulphidation, quartz-alunite epithermal gold 
and silver deposits. 

 
• The sampling, sample preparation, analyses, and sample security are 

appropriate for the style of mineralization and Mineral Resource estimation. 
 

• The end of year (EOY2011) Mineral Resource estimates are competently 
completed to industry standards using reasonable and appropriate parameters 
and are acceptable for use in Mineral Reserve estimation.  The resource 
estimates conform to NI 43-101.   

 
• Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves and are estimated 

effective December 31, 2011. 
 
• On a 100% basis, Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 181.73 Mt, 

grading 1.88 g/t Au, 10.43 g/t Ag, and 0.08% Cu, containing 11.0 Moz Au, 60.9 
Moz Ag, and 340 Mlbs Cu. 

 
• On a 100% basis, Inferred Mineral Resources total 22.6 Mt, grading 1.6 g/t Au, 

12.8 g/t Ag, and 0.08% Cu, containing 1.2 Moz Au, 9.3 Moz Ag, and 38.4 Mlb Cu.

• On a 100% basis, open pit Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves total 285.4 

million tons grading 2.8 g/t Au, 17.5 g/t Ag, and 0.09% Cu containing 25.3 million 
oz Au, 160.2 million oz Ag, and 590.5 million pounds Cu.  

 
• The Pueblo Viejo Mineral Reserves stated for the EOY2011 meet Canadian NI 

43-101 requirements to be classified as Mineral Reserves. 
 

• Mining planning for the Pueblo Viejo open pit mine follows industry standards. 
 

• In RPA's opinion, the methodology used by PVDC for pit limit determination, cut-
off grade optimization, production sequence and scheduling, and estimation of 
equipment/manpower requirements is in line with good industry practice. 

 
MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURICAL TESTING 

• RPA is of the opinion that the metallurgical testwork is adequate to support the 
Project and that the recovery models are reasonable. 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
RPA recommends that: 
 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

• The Measured classification be defined by 40% to 50% of the variogram sill and 
requires at least one composite from two drill holes. 

   
MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• Sulphur grades be reported in the LOM and sulphur received in the processing 
plant be reconciled with reserve sulphur grades.  Monitor the effectiveness of the 
sulphur decay in the stockpiles and adjust stockpile design if the required rate of 
decay is not achieved.  

 
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
RPA was provided with the December 2011 updated individual production plans, capital 

forecasts, manpower forecasts, and operating cost forecasts for the Pueblo Viejo open 

pit.  The LOM plan for the open pit provides for mining and processing through to 2047.   

 

The Net Present Value (NPV) for Pueblo Viejo is based on revenue and costs from the 

open pit between 2012 and 2047.  A discount rate of 5% has been used by Barrick.  In 

RPA's opinion, this is a low rate for a developing project. 

 

From the information provided RPA prepared a pre-tax cash flow analysis, which is 

presented in Table 1-3.  A summary of the key criteria is provided below.

CASH FLOW AND PROJECT ECONOMICS 
Considering the Pueblo Viejo Mine on a stand-alone basis, excluding sunk cost of $3.17 

billion, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $10.1 billion over the mine life.  The 

annual cash flow is positive in all years through the end of the mine production in 2041.  

The pre-tax NPV at a 5% discount rate starting in 2012 and excluding sunk cost is $4.2 

billion and the IRR is 39%.  Simple payback occurs in the second quarter of 2015, or 34 

months from the start of production.   

 

If full capital expenditure of $3.63 billion for construction is included, the cash flow drops 

to $7.3 billion, the pre-tax NPV at a 5% discount rate to $1.7 billion, the IRR to 9.1% and 

payback occurs near the midpoint of 2022.  

 

The Total Cash Cost is $467 per ounce of gold, calculated by subtracting silver and 

copper revenue from the cash cost.  The mine life capital unit cost is $246 per ounce of 

gold, for a Total Production Cost of $713 per ounce of gold.  Average annual gold 

production during operation is 666,200 ounces per year. 

 

RPA notes that the economic analysis confirms that the material classified as Mineral 

Reserves is supported by a positive economic analysis. 

 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic 

risks were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:  

• Metal prices, metallurgical recovery, and head grade  

• Operating costs (Total Direct Operating Cost) 

• Capital costs 

 

The sensitivity of the NPV at 5% over the base case has been calculated for -20% to 

+20% variations.  The revenue for gold is proportional to the product of price times head 

grade times metallurgical recovery.  Therefore, the metal sensitivity is shown as a single 

item where the change in the variable is the combination of the changes to the price, 

metallurgical recovery, and head grade.  The sensitivities for the base case are shown in 

Figure 1-1 and Table 1-4.  The NPV is most sensitive to changes in gold, silver, and 

copper price/recovery followed by the operating costs and capital costs.  The total cost of

construction is not included in the sensitivity analysis, which explains the lack of 

sensitivity to capital costs. 

 

The 28.75% NPI is highly sensitive to revenue and therefore the metal prices.  Below 

$1,300/oz of gold, no NPI is payable.  The effect of increasing metal prices on the NPI 

can be seen in Figure 1-2 and Table 1-5.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

PROPERTY LOCATION AND LAND TENURE 
The Pueblo Viejo site is located in the central part of the Dominican Republic on the 

Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the province of Sanchez Ramirez.  The Project is 15 

km west of the provincial capital of Cotuí and approximately 100 km northwest of the 

national capital of Santo Domingo. 

 

The Pueblo Viejo property, situated on the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve (MFR), is centred 

at 19°02' N, 70°08' W in an area of moderately hilly topography. The MFR covers an 

area of 4,880 ha and encompasses all of the areas previously included in the Pueblo 

Viejo and Pueblo Viejo II concession areas, which were owned by Rosario Dominicana 

S.A. (Rosario) until March 7, 2002, as well as the El Llagal area. 

 

Placer Dome Inc. (Placer), through PVDC, acquired the Project in July 2001.  PVDC is 

the holder of a lease right to the MFR by virtue of a Special Lease Agreement of Mining 

Rights (SLA).  In March 2002, the Dominican state created the MFR with an area of 

3,200 ha.  The SLA was ratified by the Dominican National Congress and became 

effective in 2003.  On August 3, 2004, the Dominican state modified the MFR to include 

El Llagal.  In February 2006, Barrick acquired Placer and subsequently sold 40% of the 

Project to Goldcorp.

The SLA governs the development and operation of the Project and includes the right to 

exploit the Las Lagunas and Mejita Tailings impoundment facilities and the Hatillo 

limestone deposit.  The SLA will extend for 25 years following PVDC's decision to 

develop a mine, with one extension by right for 25 years and a second 25 year extension 

at the mutual agreement of PVDC and the Dominican state, allowing a possible total 

term of 75 years. 

 

PVDC shall make Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) payments to the Dominican state of 3.2% 

of net receipts of sales, make an NPI payment (with a rate that varies with the price of 

gold) after PVDC has recaptured its initial and ongoing investments, and pay income tax 

under a stabilized tax regime. 

 

In November 2009, amendments to the Project SLA were ratified which set out revised 

fiscal terms and clarified various administrative and operational matters to the mutual 

benefit of the state and PVDC.  Barrick issued a statement on November 16, 2010, 

confirming amendments had been approved on the Project, including fiscal adjustments.   

 

EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
The Project is located approximately 100 km northwest of Santo Domingo, the capital of 

the Dominican Republic, which is the principal source of supply for the mine.  It is a port 

city with a population of over three million with daily air service to the USA and other 

countries. 

 

The main road from Santo Domingo to within about 22 km of the mine site is a surfaced, 

four-lane, divided highway, which is generally in good condition.  Access from the 

divided highway to the site is via a two-lane, surfaced road.  Gravel surfaced, internal 

access roads provide access to the mine site facilities. 

 

In order to transport the autoclaves, which weigh over 700 tonnes each, upgrades to a 

north coast road were completed so that this road could be used instead of the route 

from Santo Domingo.  Upgrading included road and bridge improvements, clearing of 

overhead obstructions, erosion control, bypass route construction, clearing utility 

interferences, and work permitting.

As well as the existing access roads, current site infrastructure includes accommodation, 

offices, truck shop, medical clinic and other buildings, water supply, and old tailings 

impoundments with some water treatment facilities.  Upgrades and renovations will be 

performed on some of these facilities. 

 

A tailings storage facility (TSF) is under construction in the El Llagal valley approximately 
3.5 km south of the plant site and consists of two rockfill dams with saprolite cores. 

 

PVDC will supply power for permanent operations from a new power plant that it is 

building near San Pedro de Macoris on the south shore of the Dominican Republic.  The 

output will be 215 MW.  The plant will operate on heavy fuel oil (HFO) and will be 

connected to the mine by 110 km of private transmission line that is being constructed by 

PVDC.  The power supply for permanent operations will be completed in 2013.  

Currently, on-site generation supplies 13 MW, sufficient for pre-commissioning, which 

has been supplemented by an additional 30 MW of power generated on-site for 

commissioning.   

 

HISTORY 
The earliest records of Spanish mine workings at Pueblo Viejo are from 1505. The 

Spanish mined the deposit until 1525, when the mine was abandoned in favour of newly 

discovered deposits on the American mainland.  There are few records of activity at 

Pueblo Viejo from 1525 to 1950, when the Dominican government sponsored geological 

mapping in the region.  

 

Rosario Resources Corporation of New York (Rosario) optioned the property in 1969 

and completed drilling, which resulted in an oxide deposit of significant tonnage.  Open 

pit mining of the oxide resources commenced on the Moore deposit in 1975, and in 1980 

Rosario merged into AMAX Inc. (Amax). 

 

Rosario continued exploration throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, and the Monte 

Negro, Mejita, and Cumba deposits were identified by soil sampling and percussion 

drilling and were put into production in the 1980s.

Rev. 0 Page 1-13 

With the oxide resources diminishing, Rosario initiated studies on the underlying 

refractory sulphide resource in an effort to continue the operation.  Feasibility level 

studies were conducted by Fluor Engineers Inc. in 1986 and Stone & Webster 

Engineering/American Mine Services in 1992. 

 

Rosario continued to mine the oxide material until approximately 1991, when the oxide 

resource was essentially exhausted.  Mining in the Moore deposit stopped early in the 

1990s owing to high copper content (which resulted in high cyanide consumption) and 

ore hardness.  Mining in the Monte Negro deposit ceased in 1998, and stockpile mining 

continued until July 1999, when the operation was shut down.  In 24 years of production, 

the Pueblo Viejo Mine produced a total of 5.5 million ounces of gold and 25.2 million 

ounces of silver. 

 

Lacking funds and technology to process the sulphide ore, Rosario attempted to joint 

venture the property in 1992 and again in 1996.  Three companies were involved in the 

privatization process: GENEL JV, Mount Isa Mines Ltd. (MIM), and Newmont Mining 

Corporation (Newmont).  This privatization was not achieved, but each of the three 

companies conducted work on the property during their evaluations. 

 

In 1996 and 1999, the GENEL JV completed diamond drilling, developing a new 

geological model, mining studies, evaluation of refractory ore milling technologies, socio-

economic evaluation, and financial analysis.  In 1997, MIM conducted a 31 hole, 4,600 

m diamond drilling program, collected a metallurgical sample from drill core, carried out 

detailed pit mapping, completed induced polarization (IP) geophysical surveys over the 

known deposits, and organized aerial photography over the mining concessions to 

create a surface topography.  MIM also proposed to carry out a pilot plant and feasibility 

study using ultra-fine grinding/ferric sulphate leaching.  In 1992 and 1996, Newmont 

proposed to carry out a pilot plant and feasibility study for ore roasting/bio-oxidation.  

Samples were collected for analysis, but no results are available.   

 

Between 2002 and mid-2005, Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation, a subsidiary of 

Placer Dome Inc. (together Placer), completed extensive work on Pueblo Viejo including 

drilling, geological studies, and mineral resource/reserve estimation.  This work was 

compiled in a Feasibility Study completed in July 2005.

In addition to drilling programs in 2002 and 2004, Placer conducted structural pit 

mapping of the Moore and Monte Negro open pits in 2002.  Placer also mapped and 

sampled a 105 km2 area around the concessions as part of an ongoing environmental 

baseline study to identify acid rock drainage (ARD) sources outside the main deposit 

areas.  Part of the regional mapping and sampling program focused on evaluating the 

potential for mineralization in the proposed El Llagal tailings storage area. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
Pueblo Viejo is hosted by the Lower Cretaceous Los Ranchos Formation, a series of 

volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that extend across the eastern half of the Dominican 

Republic.  The Los Ranchos Formation consists of a lower complex of pillowed basalt, 

basaltic andesite flows, dacitic flows, tuffs and intrusions, overlain by volcaniclastic 

sedimentary rocks and interpreted to be a Lower Cretaceous intra-oceanic island arc.  

The unit has undergone extensive seawater metamorphism (spilitization) and lithologies 

have been referred to as spilite (basaltic-andesite) and keratophyre (dacite). 

 

The Pueblo Viejo Member of the Los Ranchos Formation is confined to a restricted, 

sedimentary basin measuring approximately three kilometres north-south by two 

kilometres east-west. The basin is interpreted to be either due to volcanic dome collapse 

forming a lake, or a maar-diatreme complex that cut through lower members of the Los 

Ranchos Formation. The basin is filled with lacustrine deposits that range from coarse 

conglomerate deposited at the edge of the basin to thinly bedded carbonaceous 

sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone deposited further from the paleo-shoreline. 

 

The Moore deposit is located at the eastern margin of the Pueblo Viejo Member 

sedimentary basin.  Stratigraphy consists of finely bedded carbonaceous siltstone and 

mudstone (Puerto Viejo sediments) overlying horizons of spilite (basaltic-andesite flows), 

volcanic sandstone, and fragmental volcaniclastic rocks. The entire sequence in the 

Moore deposit area has a shallow dip to the west.  The numerous north-northeast and 

north-northwest faults in the area are associated with an intense cleavage and bedding-

parallel quartz veins with gold mineralization. 

 

The Monte Negro deposit is located at the northwestern margin of the sedimentary 

basin.  Stratigraphy consists of interbedded carbonaceous sediments ranging from

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 1-15 

siltstone to conglomerate, interlayered with volcaniclastic flows.  These volcaniclastic 

flows become thicker and more abundant towards the west.  This entire sequence has 

been grouped as the Monte Negro Sediments.  In the eastern part of the Monte Negro 

deposit area, the bedding dip is shallow to the southwest; in the west, the dip is shallow 

to the northwest.  Numerous dikes barren of mineralization intrude the Monte Negro 

stratigraphy.  A steep north-northwest trending fault (Monte Negro Fault) with a west-

side-up sense of movement is interpreted to separate the sediments in the east from the 

volcanic rocks in the west and has been a focus for silicification, breccia dyke 

emplacement, and mineralization.   

 

The Pueblo Viejo deposits have undergone typical high sulphidation, zoned alteration 

characterized by silica, pyrophyllite, pyrite, kaolinite, and alunite.  Silica is predominant in 

the core of the alteration envelope and occurs with kaolinite in the upper zones where a 

silica cap is often formed.  Unlike typical high sulphidation deposits where silicic 

alteration is residual and a result of acid leaching, silicification at Pueblo Viejo represents 

silica introduction and replacement.  Silica enriched zones are surrounded by a halo of 

quartz-pyrophyllite and pyrophyllite alteration. 

 

The Pueblo Viejo mineralization is predominantly pyrite, with lesser amounts of 

sphalerite and enargite.  Pyrite mineralization occurs as disseminations, layers, 

replacements, and veins.  Sphalerite and enargite mineralization is primarily in veins, but 

disseminated sphalerite has been noted in core. 

 

Gold is intimately associated with pyrite veins, disseminations, replacements, and layers 

within the zones of advanced argillic alteration.  Gold occurs as native gold, sylvanite 

(AuAgTe4), and aurostibnite (AuSb2).  The principal carrier of gold is pyrite where the 

sub-microscopic gold occurs in colloidal-size micro inclusions (less than 0.5 µm) and as 

a solid solution within the crystal structure of the pyrite. 

 

Assay results for silver demonstrate that it has the strongest correlation with gold.  In 

particular, silver has a strong association with Stage III sulphide veins where it occurs as 

native silver and in pyrargyrite (antimony sulphide), hessite (silver telluride), sylvanite 

and petzite (gold tellurides), and tetrahedrite.

Rev. 0 Page 1-16 

The majority of the zinc occurs as sphalerite, primarily in Stage III sulphide veins, and to 

a lesser extent as disseminations.  The sphalerite is beige to orange coloured and is 

relatively iron-free.  Sphalerite commonly contains inclusions and intergrowths of pyrite, 

sulphosalts, galena, and silicate gangue. The encapsulated pyrite is often host to sub-

microscopic gold mineralization. 

 

Most of the copper occurs as enargite hosted in Stage III sulphide veins.  Only trace 

amounts of chalcocite and chalcopyrite have been documented.  Enargite-rich vein 

zones typically are confined laterally and vertically within the larger sphalerite-rich vein 

zones. 

 

EXPLORATION STATUS 
In 2006, PVDC began to review the entire geological potential of the Project, using 

works performed by previous owners to develop an understanding of the geology of the 

deposit and its potential.  The 2006 program included data compilation, rock sampling 

and pit mapping, alteration studies, geophysical and geochemical surveys, two-phase 

diamond drilling program (53 holes totalling approximately 14,000 m), and preparation of 

an updated mineral resource estimate.  The 2006 program allowed better definition of 

deposit geology and significantly increased the amount of ounces in both the Moore and 

Monte Negro deposits. 

 

A total of 67,127 m were drilled in 2007, primarily for definition drilling, condemnation, 

and limestone purposes.  During 2008, PVDC completed 121 diamond drill holes for 

28,067 m. 

 

In 2009, PVDC undertook a major relogging program of all historical drill core, carried 

out detailed geological mapping of pits and construction excavations, and reinterpreted 

the geological models underpinning resource and reserve estimates.   

 

In 2010, PVDC continued the detailed in-pit and construction excavation geological 

mapping and also undertook a close-spaced, reverse circulation (RC) grade control 

drilling program for Phase 1 pit shells in the Moore and Monte Negro open pits.  This 

drilling comprised 1,120 holes for 38,485 m in Monte Negro and 593 holes for 22,026 m

in Moore.  In-fill RC drilling of 33 holes for 5,306 m was also carried out within the 

limestone resource areas.  

 

PVDC continued close-spaced RC grade control drilling program for Phase 1 pit shells in 

the Moore and Monte Negro pits.  A total of 22,876 m were completed in 2011. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCES 
The EOY2011 Mineral Resources were estimated by conventional 3D computer block 

modelling based on surface drilling and assaying.  Geologic interpretation of the drilling 

data was carried out and wireframes were constructed for resource estimation based on 

major geological areas, lithology, alteration, oxidation boundary, and a grade indicator to 

define broad grade shells. The three main geological areas are Monte Negro, Moore, 

and Cumba.  Statistical analysis of assay data was carried out to determine grade 

capping levels and metal losses for each domain.  Variography using 10 m composites 

was completed to determine search parameters and inverse distance to the third power 

was employed for gold, silver, and sulphur grade interpolation in the block model.  

Copper grades were interpolated using ordinary kriging and inverse distance to the 

second power.  The resource model was classified using a combination of estimation 

pass number, number of composites used to assign the block grade, and the distance to 

nearest composite.  PVDC visually validates the block model gold grades against drill 

holes and composites in section and plan view.  Grades are also compared against the 

nearest neighbour (composite) gold grades and a histogram of the original composite 

distribution is compared to the block gold grade estimate. 

 

RPA examined the EOY2011 Mineral Resources as reported in Table 1-1 in detail and 

found them to meet or exceed industry standards.  The EOY2011 Mineral Resources are 

based on the same block models but have been estimated using higher metal prices.  

The Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves and could not be converted to 

Mineral Reserves due to operational constraints or economics (i.e., Measured and 

Indicated Mineral Resources), or an insufficient level of confidence (i.e., Inferred Mineral 

Resources).

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 1-18 

In RPA's opinion, the EOY2011 Mineral Resource estimates are competently completed 

to industry standards using reasonable and appropriate parameters and are acceptable 

for reserve work.  The resource estimates conform to NI 43-101.   

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect the open pit 

mineral resource estimates. 

 

MINERAL RESERVES 
Mineral Reserves were estimated based on the value, or profit, calculated for each 

Mineral Resource block, which takes into account metal grade, sulphur content, time 

required for processing (higher sulphur means longer processing time and reduced daily 

plant capacity), processing plant recoveries, and costs in determining the value of a given 

block. 

 

To further optimize the block value, a Ranking Index (profit/hr) was applied to each block 

of the Mineral Resource model.  Measured and Indicated Resource blocks were treated 

as potential mill feed, while Inferred Resource and unclassified blocks were treated as 

waste and were assigned a Ranking Index of zero. 

 

RPA reviewed the reported Mineral Reserves, production schedules, and cash flow 

analysis to determine if the Mineral Reserves met the CIM Definition Standards for 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  Based on this review, it is RPA's opinion that 

the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource within the final pit design at Pueblo Viejo 

can be classified as Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves.   

 

MINING    
Pueblo Viejo will be a conventional truck and shovel operation.  The Mineral Reserves 

are contained in two pits, Monte Negro and Moore.  The operation is designed for 

processing 24,000 tpd and mining approximately 100,000 tpd ROM total material 

(excluding rehandle). 

 

Until first ore is processed, all run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be stockpiled in three 

locations, for high grade, medium grade, and low grade material.  By the start of the

plant feed in July 2012, the total ore on stockpile is scheduled to be 21 Mt.  Total ore on 

stockpiles will reach a maximum of approximately 152 Mt in 2029. 
 

The initial pre-stripping requirement is very low as previous mining has left ore 

outcropping on surface.  The waste to ore ratio is 1:0.98 but increases to 1.19:1, i.e., by 

21%, in the final pit design.  This indicates that the final pit design is sub-optimal and 

there is scope to further optimize the pit design and improve the economics of the 

Project.  
 

The pit stages have been chosen to facilitate the early extraction of the higher grade ore.  

Elevated initial cut-off grades have been used for this purpose.  Notwithstanding, the 

driver of the mine schedule will be the sulphur blending requirement.  This variable is as 

important as the gold grade, because the metallurgical aspects of the processing 

operation, the recoveries achieved, and the processing costs all strongly depend on a 

very stable, low-variability sulphur content in the plant feed. 
 

All waste rock from the Moore and Monte Negro pits will be hauled to the El Llagal 

tailings area, with potential acid generating waste being submerged in the tailings facility. 

An eight kilometre haul road has been constructed to link the pit area to the TSF.  
 

The processing method requires a significant amount of limestone slurry and lime 

derived from high quality limestone.  Limestone quarries, located approximately two 

kilometres from the Project, have been in production since 2009.   
 

Processing higher grade ore in the early years, while stockpiling lower grade ore for later 

processing, results in a mine life of 18 years and a processing life of 36 years.  In years 

2012 to 2029, total material movement, including limestone, averages approximately 47 

Mtpa, and about 84%% of ROM ore is stockpiled for later processing. 
 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
METALLURGY 
The Pueblo Viejo ore is refractory and consists primarily of gold and silver intimately 

associated with pyrite that occurs as encapsulated sub-micron particles and in solid 

solution.  As a result, there is a requirement to chemically break down the pyrite to 

recover the precious metals.  In addition, there are cyanide consuming minerals and 



  www.rpacan.com

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 1-20 

preg-robbing carbonaceous material in some of the ores.  Pyrite and sphalerite are the 

two main sulphide minerals, both occurring in veins and disseminated within the host 

rock. 

 

Using lithological and mineralization criteria, five metallurgical ore types have been 

defined, including two for the Moore deposit and three for the Monte Negro deposit.  The 

main criterion used to define metallurgical domains was carbon content, i.e., separating 

carbonaceous rocks from lower carbon-content rocks in each deposit. 

 

In addition to the mineralogical examinations used to identify gold association in the 

various ore types, diagnostic leach procedures were also used.  Test results showed that 

approximately 55% to 70% of the gold is encapsulated in sulphide minerals and is not 

recoverable by cyanide leaching without prior destruction of the sulphide matrix.  For the 

two black sedimentary ore types, 19% to 29% of the gold in the ore was preg-robbed by 

gold adsorption onto organic carbon. 

 

Metallurgical testwork indicated that pressure oxidation (POX) of the whole ore followed 

by CIL cyanidation of the autoclave product will recover 88% to 95% (average 91.6%) of 

the gold and 86% to 89% (average 87%) of the silver. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that the metallurgical testwork is adequate to support the Project 

and that the recovery models are reasonable. 

 

The efficient and trouble-free operation of the POX circuit relies heavily on maintaining 

relatively constant sulphur content in the autoclave feed.  Studies showed that there are 

wide variations in the sulphur content of the ore as the blocks are mined sequentially.  

The variation in sulphur grade ranges from 3% to 20% sulphur and generally between 

5% and 10%.  Blending will be practiced by the mine through mine planning and 

blending of ores prior to crushing.   

 
PROCESSING PLANT 
PDVC is currently building the processing plant as described in its December 2007 FSU.  

The process plant is designed to process 24,000 tpd of ore and will consist of the 

following unit operations:

• Crushing 
• Semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) and ball milling 
• Pebble crushing 
• POX 
• Hot curing 
• Counter-current decantation (CCD) washing 
• Ferric precipitation 
• Copper recovery 
• Neutralization 
• Solution cooling 
• Lime boiling for silver enhancement 
• Slurry dilution and cooling 
• CIL circuit 
• Carbon acid washing, stripping and regeneration 
• Electrowinning 
• Refining 
• Cyanide destruction 
• Tailings disposal 
• Tailings effluent and ARD treatment 

 
LIMESTONE AND LIME PLANT 
Ground limestone and lime are required to neutralize acidic liquors and to control the pH 

in the CIL circuit.  Lime is also used to adjust the pH of the effluent after water treatment.  

Satisfying the 24,000 tpd ore process requirement includes grinding 9,070 tpd of 

limestone to 80% passing 60 µm and calcining 2,785 tpd of limestone in vertical kilns to 

produce 1,484 tpd of lime.  The proposed limestone plant will include primary crushing 

and screening, grinding, calcining, and lime slaking. 

 

PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
Gravel surfaced, internal access roads provide access to the mine site facilities.  A 

network of haul roads are being built to supplement existing roads so that mine trucks 

can haul ore, mine overburden, and limestone from the various quarries.  As well as the 

existing access roads, current site infrastructure includes accommodation, offices, truck 

shop, medical clinic and other buildings, water supply, and old tailings impoundments 

with some water treatment facilities.  Some of these facilities are being upgraded or 

renovated.  

 

The new process plant site will be protected by double and single fence systems.  Within 

the plant site area, the freshwater system, potable water system, fire water system,

Rev. 0 Page 1-22 

sanitary sewage system, storm drains, and fuel lines will be buried underground.  

Process piping will typically be left above ground on pipe racks or in pipe corridors. 

 
POWER SUPPLY 

Power supply for the Project can be broken into two time periods: 1) start-up and initial 

operations; and 2) permanent operations.  For start-up and initial operations, power will 

be supplied by 43 MW of onsite diesel generators with the balance being supplied from 

the national grid pursuant to a power purchase agreement from EGE Haina S.A., a major 

power generator in the Dominican Republic.  PVDC owns the Monte Rio power plant, 

which has a rated output of 100 MW.  The output of Monte Rio will be sold to EGE Haina 

to "firm" Haina's deliveries to PVDC, with EGE Haina providing the balance of PVDC's 

demand from other generators.  The Project is connected to the national grid at a new 

substation built by PVDC near the town of Piedra Blanca.  Power then is delivered to the 

Project though 26 km of private transmission line owned by PVDC. 

 

Due to a deficit of power supply and reliability issues in the national system, PVDC will 

supply power for permanent operations from a new power plant that it is building near 

San Pedro de Macoris on the south shore of the Dominican Republic.  The plant is a 

dual-fueled reciprocating engine plant that will operate in combined cycle.  The output 

will be 215 MW.  The plant will operate on HFO and will be connected to the mine by 110 

km of private transmission line that is being constructed by PVDC.  The power supply for 

permanent operations will be completed in 2013.  Upon completion, the Project will be 

able to access power from its own plant as well as the national grid. 

 

It is the opinion of RPA that the permanent plan and back-up plans for supplying power 

to the site are adequate, although successful implementation remains contingent on a 

number of factors, including granting all the necessary permits and also resolving current 

land claims and issues from local residents. 

 
PROCESS CONTROL FACILITIES  
The plant wide distributed control system (DCS) will use Ethernet communication links, 

fibre optics, Foundation Fieldbus for analogue devices, conventional controls for discrete 

devices, and radio-links for remote sites.  Three main control rooms, 13 satellite control 

rooms, and three maintenance workstations will be located throughout the site.

Rev. 0 Page 1-23 

WATER SUPPLY  
The Hatillo and Hondo reservoirs will supply fresh water to the site.  Reclaimed water 

from the TSF sites will only be used as a supplementary water supply under drought and 

flood situations.  Barge-mounted pumps at the larger Hatillo Reservoir will pump fresh 

water to the Hondo Reservoir for make-up purposes.  Fresh water will then be pumped 

to a fresh water/fire water tank at the 400 m level and a freshwater pond, and from there 

will be distributed throughout the site for process, fire protection and potable needs.  The 

potable water will be a treated system.  

 
CONSTRUCTION 
In order to build the Project, PVDC retained major Engineering, Procurement, and 

Construction Management (EPCM) organizations to oversee the detailed design, the 

procurement, and the construction management functions for the Project.  Fluor 

Corporation (Fluor) is responsible for the execution of the whole plan, while Hatch Ltd. 

(Hatch) has been retained to look after the POX and oxygen plants.  BGC Engineering 

has been directed to perform the detailed design of the TSF as well as to provide 

geotechnical engineering support for the Project.  SNC-Lavalin was awarded the EPCM 

contract for the power plant and transmission line. 

 

Most notably, PDVC made the initial decision to use a combined self-perform 

construction (direct hire) and construction management (CM) approach to build the 

Project, using a mix of local subcontractors and specialty contractors.  A key 

consideration in this process was helping PDVC build strong relationships with the local 

community, authorities, and labour organizations. 

 

In the opinion of RPA, PDVC has used an adequate construction execution strategy.  

The completion of the 230 kV transmission line is on the critical path and efforts must be 

devoted to ensure completion in a timely fashion. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY 
When the Rosario mine shut down in 1999, proper closure and reclamation was not 

undertaken.  The result was a legacy of polluted soil and water and contaminated 

infrastructure.

Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) studies confirm that historic mining (prior to Placer Dome 

Inc.'s acquisition of the Project) and consequential ARD generation have severely 

impacted the surrounding area. ARD has developed from exposure of sulphides 

occurring in the existing pit walls, waste rock dumps, and stockpiles to air, water, and 

bacteria.  Untreated and uncontrolled ARD has contaminated local streams and rivers 

and has led to deterioration of water quality and aquatic resources both on the mine site 

and offsite.   

 

Under the SLA, environmental remediation within the mine site and its area of influence 

is the responsibility of PVDC, while the Dominican government is responsible for historic 

impacts outside the Project development area.  However, agreement was reached in 

2009 that PVDC would donate up to $37.5 million, or half of the government's total 

estimated cost of $75 million, for its clean-up responsibilities.  In December 2010, PVDC 

agreed to contribute the remaining $37.5 million on behalf of the government towards 

these clean-up activities. 

 
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 
Background data and baseline information were collected on the existing biophysical 

and human environments from 2002 through 2007.  The baseline studies covered the 

immediate project areas and also areas beyond the mine site.  The studies included 

ARD, air quality, archaeology sites, aquatic biology, flora and fauna, bedrock geology, 

soil geochemistry, and surface drainage. 

 

ARD studies confirm that historic mining (prior to Placer's acquisition of the Project) and 

consequential ARD generation have severely impacted the surrounding area.  Test 

results indicate that most of the exposed rock at the mine site is acidic and contains 

significant sulphide levels providing a source for additional acidity. 

 
PROJECT PERMITTING 
As of January 2011, PVDC had obtained 62 permits required to operate a mine in the 

Dominican Republic and 53 remained outstanding.  The full list of obligations arising 

from the various permits, licences, and agreements total some 4,600, of which 80% 

relate to the mine site and the remaining 20% relate mainly to the power transmission 

line and other aspects of power supply.

TAILINGS AND WASTE ROCK STORAGE FACILITY 
Tailings and waste rock from mine development will be deposited in the El Llagal valley, 

a tributary of the Rio Maguaca.  The El Llagal valley is being constructed to store tailings 

from the CIL circuit blended with sludge from the neutralization circuit and also waste 

rock from the open pits.  Storage of tailings and waste rock under a permanent water 

cover will prevent the onset of ARD.  The rock fill dams are being constructed with a 

compacted saprolite core to provide an impermeable barrier to seepage, and appropriate 

filter zones are being provided.   

 

Design criteria for static and seismic stability meet the minimum safety factors for the 

high to very high consequence of failure classification as recommended by the Canadian 

Dam Association, Dam Safety Guidelines.  Flood storage and spillway design have been 

developed based on extreme precipitation events. 

 

Currently, the El Llagal TSF is the only one permitted and approved for construction.  

With respect to Mineral Reserve estimates, the current mine life is constrained by the 

TSF availability.  Other potential TSF sites have been identified and negotiations are 

underway to obtain relevant permits. 

 
MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
PVDC's intent is to leave the site at closure with better water quality in the Margajita 

drainage system downstream than existed when the Project commenced.  Freshwater 

diversions, ARD collection ditches, ARD collection ponds, and ARD pump stations will 

be required to remain in service during the post closure phase.  These facilities will have 

to be maintained in good operating condition until water quality meets acceptable 

discharge criteria. 

 

There is potential to submerge waste rock, tailings, and/or sludge in the pits after 

completion of mining. 

 

Seepage from the TSF will be required to be collected and pumped back to the 

impoundment until such time as the seepage meets acceptable standards for release to 

the environment.  The water level in the TSF will be allowed to increase and the water 

will be allowed to flow over the emergency spillways once the water quality meets the 

discharge criteria.

BOND 
The Environmental Licence requires a compliance bond of RD$635,250,000 

(approximately US$16,400,000), corresponding to 10% of the cost of the Environmental 

Adjustment and Management Plan (PMAA) of the construction phase.  Once the 

construction phase is completed, PVDC will provide a bond that corresponds to 10% of 

the amount of the updated PMAA defined for the operational phase.  At the end of the 

operational phase, PVDC will provide the corresponding bond at 10% of the total amount 

of the PMAA for the closure and post closure phases. 

 

As part of the SLA agreement, PVDC is required to create an Environmental Reserve 

Fund in an offshore escrow account funded at a rate equal to 5% of all operational costs, 

other than costs of concurrent rehabilitation, until the funds are adequate to discharge 

the closure reclamation obligations. 

 

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES 
Current Forecast to Completion capital costs for the Project are estimated to be $3.63 

billion as shown in Table 1-6, of which $3.14 billion was committed at the end of 

December 2011.

LAND TENURE 
PVDC is the holder of a lease right to the MFR by virtue of a Special Lease Agreement 

of Mining Rights (SLA). On March 2002, Rosario renounced the Pueblo Viejo and 

Pueblo Viejo II concessions and the Dominican state terminated such concessions. On 

March 7, 2002, the Dominican state, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 169-02, 

created the MFR with an area of 3,200 ha. The SLA was ratified by the Dominican 

National Congress and published in the Official Gazette of the Dominican Republic on 

May 21, 2003, and became effective shortly thereafter. On August 3, 2004, the 

Dominican state, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 722-04, modified the MFR to 

include El Llagal resulting in a current area of 4,880 ha. The SLA governs the 

development and operation of the Project and includes the right to exploit the Las 

Lagunas and Mejita Tailings impoundment facilities and the Hatillo limestone deposit.  In 

August 2003 PVDC, informed the Dominican Government that it was not going to include 

the Las Lagunas tailings impoundment facilities as part of its development areas.  

 

Pertinent terms of the SLA are: 

1. The SLA will extend for 25 years following notice by PVDC to the Dominican 
state that PVDC will develop a mine at the Pueblo Viejo site (Project Notice), with 
one extension by right for 25 years and a second 25 year extension at the mutual 
agreement of PVDC and the Dominican state, allowing a possible total term of 75 
years. 
 

2. PVDC may exploit the Hatillo limestone deposit and all other limestone deposits 
within the MFR at no additional charge. 
 

3. The Dominican state will acquire and lease to PVDC the lands and mineral rights 
necessary for the permanent disposal of tailings and waste. 
 

4. The Dominican state will mitigate all historical environmental matters, except 
those conditions within areas designated for development by PVDC in the Project 
Notice. 
 

5. The Dominican state will relocate, at its sole cost and in accordance with World 
Bank Standards, those persons dwelling in the Los Cacaos section of the site. 
 

6. The Dominican state will provide a permanent and reliable source of water 
necessary to conduct the operations, at no additional charge to PVDC. 
 

7. PVDC shall make Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) payments to the Dominican state of 
3.2% of net receipts of sales, make a Net Profits Interest (NPI) payment (with a 
rate that varies with the price of gold) after PVDC has recaptured its initial and 
ongoing investments, and pay income tax under a stabilized tax regime.

In November 2009, following approval by the Dominican Republic National Congress, 

President Leonel Fernandez ratified amendments to the Project SLA. Amendments to 

the SLA included revised fiscal terms and clarified various administrative and operational 

matters to the mutual benefit of the state and PVDC, the Project operator.  Barrick 

issued a statement on November 16, 2010, confirming amendments had been approved 

on the Project, including fiscal adjustments. The most notable modifications included: 

 

1. Adjustment of the NPI sliding scale to ensure a minimum Internal Rate of Return 
(IRR) of 10%.  The NPI rate will be 0% until the Project reaches an IRR of 10%.  
Once this rate is reached, the NPI percentage that corresponds to the Dominican 
state shall be 28.75%.   
 

2. PVDC agreed to cover 50% of the capital costs required for the environmental 
remediation of the historic environmental matters that are the responsibility of the 
Dominican state under the SLA, up to US$37.5 million.  It is noted that in a 
separate agreement executed in 2010, PVDC agreed to cover up to US$75.0 
million towards historic environmental liabilities. 
 

3. In addition to relocating the persons residing in the Los Cacaos Basin, the 
Dominican state will also relocate, at its sole cost, those persons from El Llagal 
Basin, an area necessary for Project operations. Relocation will be in accordance 
with World Bank Standards as set forth in the SLA. 

 

PERMITS 
General Environmental and Natural Resources Law No. 64-00 (Law 64-00) of August 18, 

2000 and its complementary regulations, governs all environmental related issues, 

including those applicable to mining, in the Dominican Republic. Law 64-00 sets out the 

general rules of conservation, protection, improvement, and restoration of the 

environment and natural resources by unifying segregated rules concerning 

environmental protection and creating a governmental body (the Ministry of Environment 

and Natural Resources) with wide authority to oversee and regulate its application. The 

Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources enforces Law 64-00 and establishes the 

process of obtaining environmental permits. 

 

PVDC completed a Feasibility Study on the Project in September 2005 and presented 

an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to the Dominican state in November of the 

same year. The terms of reference for the Project were approved by the Environmental 

Authority on May 30, 2005, and the Ministry of Environment approved the EIA in

December 2006 and granted the Environmental License 101-06. Requirements of the 

Environmental License included submission of detailed design of tailings dams, 

installation of monitoring stations, and submission for review of the waste management 

plan and incineration plant. 

 

An environmental evaluation report was submitted in 2008 to address an increase in the 

planned processing rate to 24,000 tpd and in September 2010 the Ministry of 

Environment and Natural Resources issued the Environmental License 101-06 Modified. 

 

When the former Rosario mine shut down its operations in 1999, proper closure and 

reclamation was not undertaken. The result has been a legacy of polluted soil and water 

and contaminated infrastructure. Responsibility for the clean-up is now shared jointly 

between PVDC and the Dominican government. Terms have been set for both parties in 

the SLA that governs the development and operation of the Project.  

 

In November 2009, following approval by the Dominican Republic National Congress, 

President Leonel Fernandez ratified amendments to the SLA for the Project. The 

amendments better reflected the scope and scale of the Project since its acquisition by 

Barrick in 2006 and the amendments set out revised fiscal terms and clarified various 

administrative and operational matters to the mutual benefit of PVDC and the Dominican 

state. In particular, the agreement stipulates that environmental remediation within the 

development area is the responsibility of the company with the exception of the 

hazardous substances; the Dominican government is responsible for historic impacts 

outside the Project development area and hazardous substances at the plant site. 

However, PVDC may manage the cleanup effort on the government's behalf, subject to 

the execution of management agreement with the Dominican Government. 

 

The Pueblo Viejo mine site requires 146 permit approvals from 16 governmental 

agencies. At the time of writing, approval had been granted for 86 permits, 18 have been 

submitted to the government, and 42 have been identified to be prepared. 

 

In addition to mine site permit approvals, in March 2011 PVDC obtained an 

environmental license for a power transmission line (TL) of approximately 122 km in 

length from Azua to the mine site.  PVDC has decided to resort to a new power solution

which includes a 215 MW combined circle power plant to be installed in Quisqueya, San 

Pedro de Macoris and a power transmission line approximately 110 km in length from 

Quisqueya to the Pueblo Viejo Mine.  The length of the original power line was reduced 

to 26 km and was completed from Piedra Blanca, Monseñor Nouel to the Mine. In 

January 2012, PVDC submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources 

the EIA for the new power solution and is currently awaiting approval.  Ten 

authorizations for the new power project have been obtained and 11 have been 

identified to be obtained in the future. 

 

The principal agencies from which permits, licenses, and agreements are required for 

mine operation in the Dominican Republic include:

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
Access from Santo Domingo is by a four lane, paved highway (Autopista Duarte, 

Highway #1) that is the main route between Santo Domingo and the second largest city, 

Santiago.  This highway connects to a secondary highway, #17, at the town of Piedra 

Blanca, approximately 78 km from Santo Domingo.  This secondary highway is a two 

lane, paved highway that passes through the towns of Maimon, Palo de Cuaba, and La 

Cabirma on the way to Cotuí.  The gatehouse for the Pueblo Viejo Mine is 22 km from 

Piedra Blanca or approximately 6.5 km from Palo de Cuaba. 

 

The main port facility in the Dominican Republic is Haina in Santo Domingo.  Other port 

facilities are located at Puerto Plata, Boca Chica, and San Pedro de Macoris. 

 

CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The central region of the Dominican Republic is dominated by the Cordillera Central 

mountain range, which runs from the Haitian border to the Caribbean Sea.  The highest 

point in the Cordillera Central is Pico Duarte at 3,175 m.  Pueblo Viejo is located in the 

eastern portion of the Cordillera Central where local topography ranges from 565 m at 

Loma Cuaba to approximately 65 m at the Hatillo Reservoir. 

 

Two rivers run through the concession, the Margajita and the Maguaca.  The Margajita 

drains into the Yuna River upstream from the Hatillo Reservoir while the Maguaca joins 

the Yuna below the Hatillo Reservoir.  The flows of both rivers vary substantially during 

rainstorms. 

 

The Dominican Republic has a tropical climate with little fluctuation in seasonal 

temperatures, although August is generally the hottest month and January and February 

are the coolest.  The average annual temperatures in the Project area are approximately 

25ºC, ranging from daytime highs of 32°C to night time lows of 18°C.  Annual rainfall is

approximately 1,800 mm, with May through October typically being the wettest months.  

The Dominican Republic is located in an area where hurricanes occur, with the hurricane 

season typically from August to November.  

 

Earthquakes are a real risk.  Major earthquakes occur on average every 50 years 

because the island of Hispaniola sits on top of small crustal blocks sandwiched between 

the North American and Caribbean plates.   

 

As a result of previous mining and agriculture, there is little primary vegetation on the 

Pueblo Viejo Mine site and surrounding concessions.  Secondary vegetation is abundant 

outside of the excavated areas and can be quite dense.  Rosario, the previous owner of 

the concessions, also aided the growth of secondary vegetation by planting trees 

throughout the property for soil stabilization.  

 

The economic base of the Project area is mainly agriculture and cattle ranching.  

Vegetation mainly consists of crops and grasses.  South of Cuance, submontane rain 

forest occurs in uncultivated areas.  Crops include sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, 

bananas, rice coconuts, cassava, tomatoes, pulses, dry beans, eggplants, and peanuts.  

Mining is an increasingly important economic activity and the Pueblo Viejo Mine currently 

employs nearly 6,500 workers. 

 

INFRASTRUCTURE 
The Pueblo Viejo Project is located approximately 100 km northwest of Santo Domingo, 

the capital of the Dominican Republic.  The main road from Santo Domingo to within 

about 22 km of the mine site is a surfaced, four-lane, divided highway that is generally in 

good condition.  Access from the divided highway to the site is via a two-lane, surfaced 

road.  Gravel surfaced, internal access roads provide access to the mine site facilities. 

 

In order to transport the autoclaves, which weigh over 700 tonnes each, upgrades to a 

north coast road were completed instead of the route from Santo Domingo.  Upgrading 

included road and bridge improvements, clearing of overhead obstructions, erosion 

control, bypass route construction, clearing utility interferences, and work permitting.

Rev. 0 Page 5-3 

A network of haul roads within the Project limits will supplement existing roads so that 

mine trucks can haul ore, mine overburden, and limestone from the various quarries. 

 

As well as the existing access roads, current site infrastructure includes accommodation, 

offices, truck shop, medical clinic and other buildings, water supply, and old tailings 

impoundments with some water treatment facilities.  Upgrades and renovations will be 

performed on some of these facilities. 

 

A double and single fence system will protect the new process plant site.  Within the 

plant site area, the freshwater system, potable water system, fire water system, sanitary 

sewage system, storm drains, and fuel lines will be buried underground.  Process piping 

will typically be left above ground on pipe racks or in pipe corridors. 

 

A tailings storage facility is under construction in the El Llagal valley approximately 3.5 
km south of the plant site and consists of two rock fill dams with saprolite cores. 

 

POWER PLANTS 
Power supply for the Project can be broken into two time periods: 1) start-up and initial 

operations; and 2) permanent operations.  For start-up and initial operations, power will 

be supplied by 43 MW of onsite diesel generators with the balance being supplied from 

the national grid pursuant to a power purchase agreement from EGE Haina S.A., a major 

power generator in the Dominican Republic.  PVDC owns the Monte Rio power plant, 

which has a rated output of 100 MW.  The output of Monte Rio will be sold to EGE Haina 

to "firm" Haina's deliveries to PVDC, with EGE Haina providing the balance of PVDC's 

demand from other generators. The Project is connected to the national grid at a new 

substation built by PVDC near the town of Piedra Blanca.  Power then is delivered to the 

Project though 26km of private transmission line owned by PVDC. 

 

Due to a deficit of power supply and reliability issues in the national system, PVDC will 

supply power for permanent operations from a new power plant that it is building near 

San Pedro de Macoris on the south shore of the Dominican Republic.  The plant is a 

dual-fueled reciprocating engine plant that will operate in combined cycle.  The output 

will be 215 MW.  The plant will operate on HFO and will be connected to the mine by 110 

km of private transmission line that is being constructed by PVDC.  The power supply for

Rev. 0 Page 5-4 

permanent operations will be completed in 2013.  Upon completion, the Project will be 

able to access power from its own plant as well as the national grid. 

 

Currently, on-site generation supplies 13 MW, sufficient for pre-commissioning, which 

has been supplemented by an additional 30 MW of power generated on-site for 

commissioning.  A temporary connection to the national grid, supplying an additional 80 

MW will allow operation of the processing plant at 6,000 tpd (76 MW), then eventually to 

12,000 tpd (105 MW).   

 

Infrastructure issues and requirements are discussed in detail in Section 18. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
The city of Santo Domingo is the principal source of supply for the mine.  It is a port city 

with a population of over three million with daily air service to the USA and other 

countries. Most non-technical staff positions and labour requirements are filled from local 

communities.

6 HISTORY 
The following exploration and mining history summary is mainly taken from Barrick's 

2007 FSU (Volume 1 - Geology). 

 

PRE-1969 
The earliest records of Spanish mine workings at Pueblo Viejo are from 1505, although 

Spanish explorers sent into the interior of the island during the second visit of Columbus 

in 1495 probably found the deposit being actively mined by the native population. The 

Spanish mined the deposit until 1525, when the mine was abandoned in favour of newly 

discovered deposits on the American mainland. 

 

There are few records of activity at Pueblo Viejo from 1525 to 1950, when the Dominican 

government sponsored geological mapping in the region. Exploration at Pueblo Viejo 

focused on sulphide veins hosted in unoxidized sediments in streambed outcrops. A 

small pilot plant was built, but economic quantities of gold and silver could not be 

recovered. 

 

ROSARIO/AMAX (1969-1992) 
During the 1960s, several companies inspected the property but no serious exploration 

was conducted until Rosario Resources Corporation of New York (Rosario) optioned the 

property in 1969.  As before, exploration was directed first at the unoxidized rock where 

sulphide veins outcropped in the stream valley and the oxide cap was only a few metres 

thick. As drilling moved out of the valley and on to higher ground, the thickness of the 

oxide cap increased to a maximum of 80 m, revealing an oxide ore deposit of significant 

tonnage. 

 

In 1972, Rosario Dominicana S.A. was incorporated (40% Rosario, 40% Simplot 

Industries and 20% Dominican Republic Central Bank).  Open pit mining of the oxide 

resource commenced on the Moore deposit in 1975.  In 1979, the Dominican Central 

Bank purchased all foreign held shares in the mine.  Management of the operation

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 6-2 

continued under contract to Rosario until 1987. Rosario was merged into AMAX Inc. 

(Amax) in 1980. 

 

Rosario continued exploration throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, looking for 

additional oxide resources to extend the life of the mine.  The Monte Negro, Mejita, and 

Cumba deposits were identified by soil sampling and percussion drilling and were put 

into production in the 1980s.  Rosario also performed regional exploration, evaluating 

much of the ground adjacent to the Pueblo Viejo concessions, with soil geochemistry 

surveys and percussion drilling.  An airborne electromagnetic (EM) survey was flown 

over much of the Maimon Formation to the south and west of Pueblo Viejo. 

 

With the oxide resources diminishing, Rosario initiated studies on the underlying 

refractory sulphide resource in an effort to continue the operation.  Feasibility level 

studies were conducted by Fluor Engineers Inc. (Fluor) in 1986 and Stone & Webster 

Engineering/American Mine Services (SW/AMS) in 1992. 

 

Fluor concluded that developing a sulphide project would be feasible if based on 

roasting technology, with sulphuric acid as a by-product.  Rosario rejected this option 

due to environmental concerns related to acid production. 

 

SW/AMS concluded that a roasting circuit would be profitable at 15,000 tpd using 

limestone slurry for gas scrubbing and a new kiln to produce lime for gas cleaning and 

process neutralization. 

 

Rosario continued to mine the oxide material until approximately 1991, when the oxide 

resource was essentially exhausted.  A carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant circuit and new 

tailings facility at Las Lagunas were commissioned to process transitional sulphide ore at 

a maximum of 9,000 tpd.  Results were poor, with gold recoveries varying from 30% to 

50%.  Selective mining continued in the 1990s on high-grade ore with higher estimated 

recoveries.  Mining in the Moore deposit stopped early in the 1990s owing to high copper 

content (which resulted in high cyanide consumption) and ore hardness.  Mining ceased 

in the Monte Negro deposit in 1998, and stockpile mining continued until July 1999, 

when the operation was shut down.

Rev. 0 Page 6-3 

In 24 years of production, the Pueblo Viejo Mine produced a total of 5.5 million ounces of 

gold and 25.2 million ounces of silver. 

 

PRIVATIZATION (1996) 
Lacking funds and technology to process the sulphide ore, Rosario attempted two 

bidding processes to joint venture the property, one around 1992 and the other in 1996.  

In November 1996, Rosario selected Salomon Brothers (Salomon Smith Barney) to 

coordinate a process to find a strategic partner to rehabilitate the operation and to 

determine the best technology to economically exploit the sulphide resource.  Three 

companies were involved in the privatization process: GENEL JV, Mount Isa Mines Ltd. 

(MIM), and Newmont Mining Corporation (Newmont).  This privatization was not 

achieved, but each of the three companies conducted work on the property during their 

evaluations. 

 

GENEL JV 
The GENEL JV was formed in 1996 as a 50:50 joint venture between Eldorado Gold 

Corporation and Gencor Inc. (later Gold Fields Inc.) to pursue their common interest in 

Pueblo Viejo. The GENEL JV expended $6 million between 1996 and 1999 in studying 

the Project and advancing the privatization process. Studies included diamond drilling, 

developing a new geological model, mining studies, evaluation of refractory ore milling 

technologies, socio-economic evaluation, and financial analysis. 

 

MOUNT ISA MINES 
In 1997, MIM conducted a due diligence program as part of its effort to win Pueblo Viejo 

in the privatization process.  It conducted a 31 hole, 4,600 m diamond drilling program, 

collected a metallurgical sample from drill core, carried out detailed pit mapping, 

completed induced polarization (IP) geophysical surveys over the known deposits, and 

organized aerial photography over the mining concessions to create a surface 

topography.  MIM also proposed to carry out a pilot plant and feasibility study using ultra-

fine grinding/ferric sulphate leaching.

Rev. 0 Page 6-4 

NEWMONT 
In 1992 and again in 1996, Newmont proposed to carry out a pilot plant and feasibility 

study for ore roasting/bioheap oxidation.  Samples were collected for analysis, but no 

results are available.  Both of Newmont's attempts to privatize or joint venture the 

property failed. 

 

PLACER DOME INC. 
Placer Dome Inc., through PVDC, acquired the Project in July 2001.  Between 2002 and 

mid-2005, Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation, a subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc. 

(together Placer), completed extensive work on Pueblo Viejo including drilling, geological 

studies, and mineral resource/reserve estimation.  This work was compiled in a 

Feasibility Study completed in July 2005.  In February 2006, Barrick Gold acquired 

Placer and subsequently sold 40% of the Project to Goldcorp. 

 

In addition to drilling programs in 2002 and 2004, Placer conducted structural pit 

mapping of the Moore and Monte Negro open pits in 2002.  Placer also mapped and 

sampled a 105 km2 area around the concessions as part of an ongoing environmental 

baseline study to identify acid rock drainage (ARD) sources outside the main deposit 

areas.  Part of the regional mapping and sampling program focused on evaluating the 

potential for mineralization in the proposed El Llagal tailings storage area.  Mapping and 

stream sediment sampling were conducted in the El Llagal valley and adjacent Maguaca 

and Naranjo river valleys.  Further geotechnical evaluation of the El Llagal valley 

resulted in BGC Engineering Inc. (BGC) of Vancouver drilling 20 core holes and 

collecting numerous outcrop samples.  Select samples identified with the most 

favourable mineralization were sent for gold and trace element analysis. 

 

PREVIOUS RESERVE ESTIMATES 
Previous reserve estimates for the Project are presented in Table 6-1.  Barrick has 

revised the Mineral Reserve estimates for Pueblo Viejo each year reflecting a number of 

factors that changed as the Project progressed.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 
The following regional geology description is taken largely from Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 

REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
Pueblo Viejo is hosted by the Lower Cretaceous Los Ranchos Formation, a series of 

volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that extend across the eastern half of the Dominican 

Republic, generally striking northwest and dipping southwest (Figure 7-1).  The Los 

Ranchos Formation consists of a lower complex of pillowed basalt, basaltic andesite 

flows, dacitic flows, tuffs and intrusions, overlain by volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and 

interpreted to be a Lower Cretaceous intra-oceanic island arc, one of several bimodal 

volcanic piles that form the base of the Greater Antilles Caribbean islands. The unit has 

undergone extensive seawater metamorphism (spilitization) and lithologies have been 

referred to as spilite (basaltic-andesite) and keratophyre (dacite). 

 

The Pueblo Viejo Member of the Los Ranchos Formation is confined to a restricted, 

sedimentary basin measuring approximately three kilometres north-south by two 

kilometres east-west. The basin is interpreted to be either due to volcanic dome collapse 

forming a lake, or a maar-diatreme complex that cut through lower members of the Los 

Ranchos Formation. The basin is filled with lacustrine deposits that range from coarse 

conglomerate deposited at the edge of the basin to thinly bedded carbonaceous 

sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone deposited further from the paleo-shoreline. In 

addition, there are pyroclastic rocks, dacitic domes, and diorite dykes within the basin. 

The sedimentary basin and volcanic debris flows are considered to be of Neocomian age 

(121 Ma to 144 Ma). The Pueblo Viejo Member is bounded to the east by volcaniclastic 

rocks and to the north and west by Platanal Member basaltic-andesite (spilite) flows and 

dacitic domes. 

 

To the south, the Pueblo Viejo Member is overthrust by the Hatillo Limestone Formation, 

thought to be Cenomanian (93 Ma to 99 Ma), or possibly Albian (99 Ma to 112 Ma), in 

age.

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
Pueblo Viejo hosts the Moore and Monte Negro deposits (Figure 7-2).  A revised 

stratigraphic column as prepared by Barrick in 2009 is shown in Figure 7-3.  Cross 

sections with interpreted structures and the lithology are shown in Figure 7-4.  The 

following property geology description is mostly taken from Placer (2005) and Barrick 

(2007).   

 

MOORE DEPOSIT 
The Moore deposit is located at the eastern margin of the Pueblo Viejo Member 

sedimentary basin.  Stratigraphy consists of finely bedded carbonaceous siltstone and 

mudstone (Puerto Viejo sediments) overlying horizons of spilite (basaltic-andesite flows), 

volcanic sandstone, and fragmental volcaniclastic rocks. The entire sequence in the 

Moore deposit area has a shallow dip to the west. 

 

Fragmental Dacite Porphyry (FDP) that outcrops north of the plant site intrudes the 

stratigraphic sequence. FDP is best described as a vent breccia with a volcaniclastic 

appearance with quartz eyes and lithic fragments, intrusive phases such as local breccia 

dikes, and intrusive contacts.  Propylitically altered porphyry has been intersected in core 

with intrusive textures and appears to form a north-northeast striking root zone to the 

FDP.  The FDP appears to have been emplaced prior to mineralization with local zones 

of disseminated pyrite and anomalous gold mineralization.  The eastern margin of the 

sedimentary basin hosting the Moore deposit, is defined by fragmental volcaniclastic 

rocks (Zambrana Member) and non-carbonaceous sedimentary rocks (Mejita 

Sediments). 

 

There are indications that an internal sub-basin exists at Moore below the Puerto Viejo 

Sediments. The sub-basin is partially filled with a mixed sedimentary sequence 

consisting of inter-fingering Puerto Viejo Sediments and fragmental volcaniclastic rocks. 

Graded bedding and slump folding textures are often observed in core. The south and 

west margins of the sub-basin are defined by pinching of the spilite and volcanic 

sandstone horizons.

Rev. 0 Page 7-7 

Bedding generally dips shallowly westwards (less than 25°), but locally steep faults with 

north-northeast and north-northwest strikes have rotated bedding into steep orientations. 

The north-northeast faults preserve evidence for an east-side-up and left-lateral sense of 

movement subsequent to mineralization.  The north-northeast faults appear to link with a 

north-northwest trending fault that controls the eastern margin of the Moore dacite 

porphyry and is a boundary to a gold-bearing pyrite vein zone at North Hill.  The 

westward-dipping thrust and bedding plane faults offset pyrite veins with only minor 

displacement evident.  The faults are associated with an intense cleavage and bedding-

parallel quartz veins with gold mineralization. 

 

MONTE NEGRO DEPOSIT 
The Monte Negro deposit is located at the northwestern margin of the sedimentary 

basin.  Stratigraphy consists of interbedded carbonaceous sediments ranging from 

siltstone to conglomerate, interlayered with volcaniclastic flows. These volcaniclastic 

flows become thicker and more abundant towards the west.  This entire sequence has 

been grouped as the Monte Negro Sediments.  In the eastern part of the Monte Negro 

deposit area, the bedding dip is shallow to the southwest; in the west, the dip is shallow 

to the northwest. 

 

The Monte Negro Sediments overlie a horizon of spilite and spilite-derived 

conglomerate.  The conglomerate consists of pebble to boulder size clasts of spilite that 

are often silicified and a light pink colour.  Silicification is likely volcanogenic, occurring 

prior to the sedimentation of the basin.  The conglomerate horizon represents either a 

basal conglomerate channelled into the margin of the basin or a reworked, brecciated 

flow top of the spilite below.  The horizon ranges in thickness from tens of metres to non-

existent and is likely filling channels in the uneven spilite surface below. 

 

Spilite that forms the basement of the Monte Negro deposit is the Platanal Member of 

the Los Ranchos Formation.  Porphyritic textures and massive andesitic flows, often 

separated by brecciated flow tops are in the west part of the deposit.  The brecciated 

textures become more abundant towards the east. 

 

Thin section work on the porphyritic spilite indicates a composition of either a high-silica 

andesite or a low-silica dacite.  Primary textures observed are consistent with an

intrusion indicating that either a dome or a near surface plug may exist under the west 

hill of Monte Negro.  The dimensions of this possible intrusion have not been determined 

because core drilling is limited.  Dikes that intrude the Monte Negro stratigraphy include 

a steeply dipping north-northwest striking mafic (diorite/andesite) dike approximately 

10 m wide.  The dike typically follows the F5 fault through the deposit area but 

occasionally splays to the north.  The dike is propylitically altered and is barren of gold 

mineralization. Similar dikes have been intersected in core in the west part of the 

deposit, but they are much thinner.  Thin breccia dikes (pebble dikes) have also been 

mapped in the pit walls. 

 

Interbedded carbonaceous siltstones, sandstones, and volcanic rocks in the Monte 

Negro Central Zone generally dip shallowly towards the southwest.  In the Monte Negro 

South Zone andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks generally dip shallowly (13°) 

towards the northwest.  A steep north-northwest trending fault (Monte Negro Fault) with 

a west-side-up sense of movement is interpreted to separate the sediments in the east 

from the volcanic rocks in the west.  The fault is interpreted to have been a focus for 

silicification, breccia dyke emplacement, and mineralization. 

 

Bedding in the hanging and footwalls of the Monte Negro Fault has been folded into 

upright, open folds in close proximity to the fault.  The axial trace of the folds trends 

north-northwest sub-parallel to the strike of the north-northwest conjugate vein set. 

 

Thrust faults displace veins and have brought sedimentary rocks into contact with 

andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.  A disconformable thrust contact is well 

exposed at the southern end of Monte Negro West. 

 

STRUCTURE 
Surface mapping and core logging have identified two main structural trends (Figure 7-

5).  The first trend is northeast bearing with vertical dips.  The second, later trend is 

north-northwest bearing with vertical dips, and cuts the northeast structures.  This 

second trend is more economically important because many feeders in the hydrothermal 

system used these structures for mineralization.

Both structural trends have contributed to basin formation, as many of these faults were 

growth faults during basin development. 

 

Low angle faults are recognized in surface mapping.  These faults were the last 

deformation event in the basin because they cut the previous systems and mainly affect 

the carbonaceous sedimentary package.  They have an average dip of 8º to 10º and no 

mineralization is related to these low angle faults. 

 

HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION 
The Pueblo Viejo deposit has undergone typical high sulphidation, zoned alteration 

characterized by silica, pyrophyllite, pyrite, kaolinite, and alunite.  Silica is predominant in 

the core of the alteration envelope and occurs with kaolinite in the upper zones where a 

silica cap is often formed.  Unlike typical high sulphidation deposits where silicic 

alteration is residual and a result of acid leaching, silicification at Pueblo Viejo represents 

silica introduction and replacement.  Silica enriched zones are surrounded by a halo of 

quartz-pyrophyllite and pyrophyllite alteration. 

 

Ongoing studies by Barrick have determined four main alteration assemblages at the 

Pueblo Viejo deposit (Figure 7-6).  These assemblages are: 

 
• Quartz – Alunite ± Dickite (qtz – al ± dk) 
• Quartz - Pyrophyllite ± Dickite (qtz - py ± dk) 
• Pyrophyllite – Illite - Kaolin (py – ill - kao) 
• Illite – Chlorite - Smectite (ill – chl - sm) 

 

Advanced argillic alteration is easily distinguished from the assemblage typical of the 

seawater metamorphosed (spilitized) Los Ranchos Formation.  Limits of the alteration 

zones are marked by a rapid change (over a few metres) in mineralogy.  Outside of 

alteration zones, finer grained sedimentary rocks are pyritic (framboids) or sideritic with 

diagenetic conditions suggesting an anoxic, restricted basin. Within mineralization, 

siderite is completely replaced by pyrite.

In the Moore deposit, silica and kaolinite are more common in the upper parts of the 

system.  In the now depleted oxide mineralization, silicification was closely associated 

with gold mineralization and caused mineralized zones to form hills with relief of about 

200 m.  In areas of intense silicification, jasperoid masses were produced, original 

sedimentary textures destroyed, and carbonaceous material removed.  Locally, veins 

and masses of pyrophyllite cut the jasperoid bodies. 

 

In the Monte Negro deposit, silica and kaolinite are again more abundant in the upper 

portions of the system and a silica cap is present.  Silicification is more widespread at 

Monte Negro and not as closely associated with gold mineralization.  Regardless, gold 

content is typically higher in silicified or partially silicified (quartz-pyrophyllite) rock. 

 

WEATHERING 
Past mining operations have stripped the deposit areas of almost all surface oxidation 

and the oxide mineralization is now virtually depleted.  The oxide was formed where 

surface oxidation removed sulphide minerals and carbon from the host sediments, 

leaving silicified host rock and massive jasperoid with jarosite, goethite, and local 

hematite mineralization.  The thickness of the oxide mineralization ranged from 80 m at 

North Hill in the Moore deposit to 50 m in the South Hill and East Mejita deposits to 

nothing in the stream valleys.  The thickest oxide mineralization was developed in 

intensely silicified, thinly bedded, and well fractured sedimentary rocks.  In contrast, 

areas underlain by intensely pyrophyllitized sedimentary rocks only had a few metres of 

oxidation.  Soil cover and saprolite were negligible over the oxide mineralized zones. 

 

Gold mineralization was largely immobile in the oxide mineralization.  No gold 

enrichment occurred, but free gold existed.  Fine specks of gold (less than 100 μm) 

could be panned from only the highest grade zones.  Silver was depleted in the near-

surface parts of the oxide mineralization and enriched at the oxide-sulphide interface.  

Zinc and copper were leached from the oxide with the destruction of the sulphides.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
Metallic mineralization in the deposit areas is predominantly pyrite, with lesser amounts 

of sphalerite and enargite.  Pyrite mineralization occurs as disseminations, layers, 

replacements, and veins.  Sphalerite and enargite mineralization is primarily in veins, but 

disseminated sphalerite has been noted in core. 

 

Studies have determined that there were three stages of advanced argillic alteration 

associated with precious metal mineralization: 

 
1. Stage I alteration produced alunite, silica, pyrite, and deposited gold in 

association with disseminated pyrite. 
 

2. Stage II overprinted Stage I and produced pyrophyllite and an overlying silica 
cap. 

 
3. Stage III of mineralization occurred when hydro-fracturing of the silica cap 

produced pyrite-sphalerite-enargite veins with silicified haloes.  Syntaxial vein 
growth preserves evidence for pyrite-enargite-sphalerite-grey-silica 
paragenesis. 

 

Individual Stage III veins have a mean width of four centimetres and are typically less 

than 10 cm wide.  Exposed at surface, individual veins can be traced vertically over three 

pit benches (30 m).  Veins are typically concentrated in zones that are elongated north-

northwest and can be 250 m long, 100 m wide, and 100 m vertical.  Stage III veins 

contain the highest precious and base metal values and are more widely distributed in 

the upper portions of the deposits. 

 

Veins tend to be parallel to follow a number of local structures that crosscut the deposit.  

Those structures have a northerly trend at Monte Negro and Moore, with a northwest-

southeast trend also present at Moore. 

 

The most common vein minerals are pyrite, sphalerite, and quartz, with lesser amounts 

of enargite, barite, and pyrophyllite.  Trace amounts of electrum, argentite, colusite, 

tetrahedrite-tennantite, geocronite, galena, siderite, and tellurides are also found in 

veins. 

 

The abundance of pyrite and sphalerite within veins varies across the deposit areas.  

Veins in the southwest corner of the Monte Negro pit are relatively sphalerite-rich and

Rev. 0 Page 7-14 

pyrite-poor when compared to veins elsewhere in the Moore and the Monte Negro 

deposits.  The sphalerite in these veins is darker red in colour, possibly indicating that it 

is richer in iron.  The abundance of dark red sphalerite in these veins may also be 

indicative of the outer margins of a system of hydrothermal-magmatic mineralized fluids. 

 

Late massive pyrophyllite veins that probably represent the last stage of veining and 

alteration cut the Stage III veins.  All stages of veining are cut by thin, white quartz veins 

associated with low angle thrusts that post-date mineralization. 

 

The Moore resource pit will have final dimensions of approximately 1,200 m by 850 m 

and a depth of 280 m.  The Monte Negro pit will have final dimensions of approximately 

1,500 m by 800 m and a depth of 360 m.   

 

METAL OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION 
The following summary is taken from Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 
GOLD 
Gold is intimately associated with pyrite veins, disseminations, replacements, and layers 

within the zones of advanced argillic alteration.  Gold values are generally the highest in 

zones of silicification or strong quartz-pyrophyllite alteration.  These gold-bearing 

alteration zones are widely distributed in the upper parts of the deposits and tend to 

funnel into narrow feeder zones.  

 

In the Moore deposit, a high-grade structural feeder zone within an alteration funnel was 

intersected by a GENEL JV core hole GEN_MDD6.  The hole intersected an intensely 

silicified shear zone that returned gold values of 9.1 g/t Au over 40 m (30 m true width).  

The shear is steeply dipping and appears to strike either north or northwest.  While the 

shear is open to depth, it possibly has a strike length of less than 100 m.  This style of 

mineralization differs from the upper zones of the deposit, where high grade gold is 

associated with sulphide veins.  This feeder zone also contains a higher concentration of 

lead in the form of lead sulphosalts and galena. 

 

In the Monte Negro deposit, a high-grade feeder zone has not been identified.  A 

potential target is the Monte Negro Fault that is intensely silicified and bounds high-

grade mineralization at the surface.  A second possibility is a deeper zone of 

mineralization that has been intersected by a vertical core hole testing an IP-

chargeability anomaly approximately 100 m east of the main deposit.  

 

AMTEL Laboratories of London, Ontario, conducted a study to establish the deportment 

of gold in four separate composites from Pueblo Viejo.  These composites represented 

four of the five metallurgical rock types established for the deposit: sedimentary rocks 

(MN-BSD) and volcanic rocks (MN-VCL) at Monte Negro and sedimentary rocks (MO-

BSD) and volcanic rocks (MO-VCL) at Moore.  Spilites at Monte Negro (MN-SP) were 

not sampled (see Section 13 for further discussion on the metallurgy of the deposit). 

 

Gold occurs as native gold, sylvanite (AuAgTe4), and aurostibnite (AuSb2).  The principal 

carrier of gold is pyrite where the sub-microscopic gold occurs in colloidal-size micro 

inclusions (less than 0.5 µm) and as a solid solution within the crystal structure of the 

pyrite.  The abundance of the gold minerals varied significantly between the different 

composites (Table 7-1).

Studies have shown that there are four major forms of pyrite: microcrystalline, 

disseminated, porous, and coarse grained.  The microcrystalline pyrite tends to have the 

highest gold concentration.  This type of pyrite is also the most arsenic-rich, which 

renders it the most prone to oxidation and the most difficult to liberate, as it forms 

complex intergrowths within the rock and with sphalerite.  Coarse-grained pyrite has the

Rev. 0 Page 7-16 

lowest gold concentration and has a well-developed crystal habit making it less 

susceptible to oxidation. 

 

There are less common forms of gold, gold minerals such as native gold, electrum, 

tellurides (sylvanite, calaverite, petzite), and locally, aurostibnite.  Most grains are less 

than 10 µm in diameter and are largely associated with growth zones of pyrites.  To a 

lesser extent, gold minerals occur as inclusions in enargite, quartz, and lead-sulphosalts 

(primarily geocronite).  Gold may also exist in the crystal structure of sulphosalts, such 

as enargite and geocronite, but additional research is required.  

 

While there is a strong correlation between gold and zinc (zones with sphalerite veins 

tend to have the highest gold grades), sphalerite carries gold only as intergrowths of 

gold-bearing pyrite.  The quantity of gold carried by the sphalerite depends on the 

percentage of gold-bearing pyrite encapsulated and the amount of sub-microscopic gold 

within the pyrite. 

 
SILVER 
Assay results for silver demonstrate that it has the strongest correlation with gold. In 

particular, silver has a strong association with Stage III sulphide veins where it occurs as 

native silver and in pyrargyrite (antimony sulphide), hessite (silver telluride), sylvanite 

and petzite (gold tellurides), and tetrahedrite. 

 
ZINC 
The majority of the zinc occurs as sphalerite, primarily in Stage III sulphide veins and to 

a lesser extent as disseminations.  The sphalerite is beige to orange coloured and is 

relatively iron-free.  An exception is the dark red veins found in the southwest corner of 

the Monte Negro deposit that may represent a discontinuous halo surrounding the 

alteration zone. 

 

Sphalerite commonly contains inclusions and intergrowths of pyrite, sulphosalts, galena, 

and silicate gangue. The encapsulated pyrite is often host to sub-microscopic gold 

mineralization. 

 

Trace amounts of zinc can be found in tetrahedrite and enargite.

Rev. 0 Page 7-17 

COPPER 
Most of the copper occurs as enargite hosted in Stage III sulphide veins.  Only trace 

amounts of chalcocite and chalcopyrite have been documented.  Enargite-rich vein 

zones typically are confined laterally and vertically within the larger sphalerite-rich vein 

zones.  Enargite is difficult to identify in hand specimen and is easily confused with 

tennantite-tetrahedrite. 

 
LEAD 
Lead minerals include galena, geocronite, boulangerite, and bournonite, most of which 

are present as fine inclusions or within fractures in pyrite, sphalerite, and enargite.  

Geocronite and boulangerite are the most prevalent. 

 

There are a limited number of lead assays in the Project database.  Assaying completed 

by GENEL JV shows a strong correlation between gold and lead.  Elevated lead values 

were found in the structural feeder zone in the Moore deposit and lead may provide 

clues on where to search for other feeder zones. 

 

MOORE DEPOSIT MINERALIZATION 
Pyrite-rich, gold-bearing veins at the deposit have a mean width of four centimetres and 

are steeply dipping with a trend commonly north-northwest.  Secondary pyrite vein sets 

trend north-south and north-northeast.  The orientation of pyrite veins and steep faults is 

similar, albeit with different dominant sets (north-northwest for veins and north-northeast 

for faults).  This suggests a probable link between steep faulting and vein development. 

 
WEST FLANK ZONE 
Thinly bedded carbonaceous siltstones and andesitic sandstones in the West Flank dip 

shallowly westwards.  Dips increase towards the west where north trending thrusts 

displace bedding. 

 

Pyrite and limonite-rich veins with gold mineralization are subvertical and trend 

commonly north-northwest.  The veins are oblique to the general north-northeast strike 

of bedding and do not appear to have been rotated.  Quartz veins with gold trend 

northwest oblique to the pyrite veins have a similar strike to the interpreted contact with 

the overlying Hatillo limestone.  They also occur as tension gash arrays in centimetre-

scale dextral shear zones that trend north-northwest.

Rev. 0 Page 7-18 

Faults create centimetre-scale displacement of bedding and pyrite-sphalerite veins occur 

along steep north-northeast trending faults and westerly dipping thrusts.  Two main 

north-northeast faults were mapped across the West Flank, sub-parallel with the Moore 

dacite porphyry contact.  Displacement of veins preserves evidence for a lateral, sinistral 

component of movement. 

 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILLS ZONES 
Bedding to the north of the Moore dacite porphyry dips shallowly westwards.  Bedding 

has been rotated about both north-northwest and north-northeast axes.  The change in 

bedding orientation reflects movement associated with north-northwest and north-

northeast trending faults. 

 

There are three steep-dipping, gold-bearing, pyrite-rich vein sets: northwest, northeast, 

and north-south.  Northwest trending veins generally contain enargite and sphalerite, 

while northeast trending veins are more pyrite ± pyrophyllite rich.  The average vein 

width is 3.5 cm.  

 

The fault pattern is dominated by steep north-northeast trending faults that appear to link 

with north-northwest trending faults.  A north-northeast trending steep fault along the 

western margin of the Moore dacite breccia has rotated bedding from shallow to steep 

dips, indicating an east-side-up sense of movement.  The sense of movement along 

north-northwest faults could not be determined.  Thrusting parallel to bedding is common 

and is evidenced by intense cleavage and quartz veins parallel to bedding.  Bedding 

plane displacement is minor, generally less than 20 cm. 

 

MONTE NEGRO DEPOSIT MINERALIZATION 
MONTE NEGRO CENTRAL ZONE 
Pyrite-rich veins with gold mineralization are sub-vertical and have bimodal trends, which 

are interpreted to form conjugate sets.  The mean width is two centimetres.  The north-

northwest trending set is sub-parallel to the strike of bedding and fold axes, indicating a 

possible genetic relationship between folding and mineralization. Enargite and 

sphalerite-bearing veins with gold dominantly trend north-northeast and have a mean 

width of three centimetres.  The combination of vein trends forms a high grade gold zone

(Vein Zone 1) which extends 500 m north-northwest, is 150 m wide, and up to 100 m 

thick between the F5 Fault to the east and the Main Monte Negro Fault to the west. 

 

The fault pattern is dominated by steep north-northwest trending faults sub-parallel to 

the dominant pyrite vein set. The main Monte Negro Fault is a 25 m x 500 m zone of 

silicification, brecciation, mineralization, folding, and faulting.  It is interpreted as a major 

fault that was active during and subsequent to mineralization. 

 
MONTE NEGRO SOUTH ZONE 
Andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks with minor intercalations of carbonaceous 

sediments dip shallowly northwards.  Close to the interpreted Monte Negro Fault, 

bedding dips more westerly and strikes north-northwest. 

 

North-northwest trending steep faults displace bedding and dip towards the southwest.  

Displacement of marker agglomerate beds indicates a metre scale west-side-up sense 

of movement.  The faults are sub-parallel to the interpreted Monte Negro Fault, which 

also has an apparent west-side-up sense of movement. 

 

Mineralized veins at the Monte Negro South Zone are relatively pyrite-poor, sphalerite-

rich, and wider (five centimetres to six centimetres).   The veins are sub-vertical and 

trend northwest.  The episodic vein fill demonstrates a clear paragenesis (massive 

pyrite-enargite-sphalerite-grey silica).  

 

Shallow-dipping bedding and sub-vertical sphalerite-silica veins on the southern margin 

of Monte Negro South are cut by a westerly-dipping thrust.  The thrust has brought thinly 

bedded pyritic sedimentary rocks into contact with andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic 

rocks.  The fault dips 35° and was mapped across the top of the Monte Negro South hill. 

The overthrust sedimentary rock package contains asymmetric folds and bedding 

cleavage relationships that indicate a reverse (west-side-up) sense of movement.  An 

upper thrust has brought a massive volcanic unit into contact with the underlying folded 

sediments. 

 

The main zone of gold mineralization that results from this combination of structures 

extends for approximately 150 m along the West Thrust Fault.

MINERALIZATION CONTROLS USED IN RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
Lithology does not constraint mineralization at Pueblo Viejo.  The primary controls on the 

geometry of the gold deposits are strong quartz-pyrophyllite alteration and quartz-pyrite 

veining along sub-vertical structures and stratigraphic zones.  The stratigraphic shape of 

some zones may be controlled by sub-horizontal structures that contain pyrite veins.  

The veins are tens of centimetres wide but are most commonly less than two 

centimetres wide.  Narrow veinlets occur along bedding planes and along fracture 

surfaces.  These veins are commonly highly discordant to bedding but locally branch out 

along shallow-dipping bedding planes, linking high angle veins in ladder-like fashion 

without obvious preferred orientations.  These veins served as feeders to the layered 

and disseminated mineralization that occurs in shallower levels in the deposit.  The 

result is composite zones of mineralization within fracture systems and stratigraphic 

horizons adjacent to major faults that served as conduits for hydrothermal fluids.  

 

In summary, gold is intimately associated with the pyrite veins, disseminations, 

replacements, and layers within the zones of advanced argillic alteration.  Gold values 

generally are the highest in zones of silicification or strong quartz-pyrophyllite alteration.  

Sphalerite is largely restricted to the veins, with pyrite lining the vein walls and sphalerite 

occurring as botryoidal aggregates.  Galena, enargite, and boulangerite occur in small 

quantities in the centre of the veins. 

 

These gold-bearing alteration zones are widely distributed in the upper parts of the 

deposits and tend to funnel into narrow feeder zones at depth.  Mineralization is 

generally contained within the boundaries of advanced argillic alteration.  The outer 

boundary of advanced argillic alteration, combined with lithological and veining zones 

were used to generate domains for resource estimation.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Pueblo Viejo is a high sulphidation, quartz-alunite epithermal gold and silver deposit.  

High sulphidation deposits are typically derived from fluids enriched in magmatic 

volatiles, which have migrated from a deep intrusive body to an epithermal crustal 

setting, with only limited dilution by groundwater or interaction with host rocks.  Major 

dilatant structures or phreatomagmatic breccia pipes provide conduits for rapid fluid 

ascent and so facilitate evolution of the characteristic high sulphidation fluid. 

 

Similar deposits occur at Summitville, Colorado; El Indio, Chile; Lepanto, Philippines; 

and Goldfield, Nevada.  They are characterized by veins, vuggy breccias and sulphide 

replacements ranging from pods to massive lenses, occurring generally in volcanic 

sequences and associated with high-level hydrothermal systems.  Acid leaching, 

advanced argillic alteration and silicification are characteristic alteration styles.  Grade 

and tonnage varies widely.  Pyrite, gold, electrum and enargite/luzonite are typical 

minerals and minor minerals include chalcopyrite, sphalerite, tetrahedrite/tennantite, 

galena, marcasite, arsenopyrite, silver sulphosalts and tellurides (Panteleyev 1996).  

 

The geological setting of the deposit is not certain at this time.  Sillitoe and Bonham 

(1984), Muntean et al. (1990), and Kesler et al. (2005) have described the setting as a 

maar diatreme complex with the various deposits around the margins of the diatreme.  

These studies concluded that coarse-grained fragmental rocks that occur at depth are 

the product of an explosive volcanic eruption that partially filled the crater with 

fragmented rock.  The crater was subsequently filled with shallow, marine sedimentary 

rocks with variable amounts of fragmental rocks from nearby volcanoes.  This sequence 

was cross-cut by younger dykes and small dacite and andesite lava domes. 

 

Alternatively, Nelson (2000) describes the setting as a volcanic dome complex emplaced 

in a shallow marine environment and attributes the coarse fragmental rocks to collapsing 

carapaces on those domes.  The author concludes that sedimentary rocks were 

deposited in depressions between the domes. 

 

More recently, Sillitoe et al. (2006) provide evidence from the Pueblo Viejo district that 

an extensive advanced argillic lithocap and the contained giant high sulphidation

Rev. 0 Page 8-2 

epithermal gold-silver deposits were emplaced beneath a thick limestone cover.  The 

authors imply that alteration and mineralization cannot be synchronous with the host 

volcano-sedimentary sequence and are substantially younger. Hence, there is no 

genetic relationship between the Moore and Monte Negro deposits and either a maar-

diatreme system or volcanic dome complex.  Whereas other interpretations imply that 

mineralization pre-dated deposition of the Hatillo Limestone, Sillitoe et al. (2006) suggest 

that the impermeable limestone acted as a barrier inhibiting upward fluid flow, 

groundwater recharge, and heat dissipation.  This resulted in high gold and zinc tenors, 

the dominance of quartz-pyrophyllite over vuggy quartz alteration, prograde overprinting 

of alunite by higher temperature pyrophyllite, and the almost exclusively magmatic 

character of the mineralized fluid.  The authors present a model of blind high 

sulphidation deposits, based on a regional rather than detailed analysis of the 

mineralized zone within the open pits that could be applied to exploration in calc-alkaline 

magmatic arc elsewhere, especially in limestone terranes or potentially beneath other 

low permeability rock units.   

 

In 2009, PVDC undertook a major relogging campaign of historical drill core and carried 

out detailed mapping of pits and construction excavations.  The work has led to an 

updated geological model underpinning the resource and reserve estimations and a 

maar-diatreme deposit formation interpretation in which extensive and compressive 

deformation resulted in the present-day lithostructural domains.  The conduits provided 

by maar-diatreme formation controlled mineralization.  Structural control predominates, 

particularly at depth, and passes into lithological control near surface.   Mineralization is 

present in pyroclastic rocks and sediments and occurs along bedding planes in upper 

sedimentary units and within narrow, local structures in the lower volcanic package.   

 

The PVDC interpretation is based on geological evidence observed within the Pueblo 

Viejo deposit and is not a regional interpretation as presented by Sillitoe et al. (2006). 

However, PVDC believes uncertainty with respect to the deposits origin has no practical 

impact on exploration at the levels that may be mined by open pit methods.  The areal 

extent of the deposits has been constrained by drilling and the vertical extents are 

reasonably well known, although additional drilling is required to define the deepest parts 

of the deposit.

9 EXPLORATION 
Section 9 provides a general overview of pre-PVDC exploration conducted on the 

Project.  Reviews of drilling and sampling from this era are included in subsequent 

sections of this report.  Much of the following exploration description is taken from 

Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 

PVDC EXPLORATION PROGRAMS 
In 2006, PVDC began to review the entire geological potential of the Pueblo Viejo 

Project, using works performed by previous owners to develop an understanding of the 

geology of the deposit and its potential. 

 

The main components of PVDC's 2006 exploration program, which provided data for 

input to the 2007 FSU were: 

 
• Data compilation and integration 

• Rock sampling (300 samples) and pit mapping 

• Alteration studies on 1,427 soil samples, 3,591 rock samples and 5,249 core 
samples 

• Geophysical surveys.  

o 41 km of IP Pole – Dipole 

o 132 km of ground magnetic readings on a 200 m grid  

• Geochemical Survey 

o 1,482 samples collected for gold and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 
assaying 

• Two-phase diamond drilling program:  

o Phase 1, 13 diamond drill holes, 3,772m 

o Phase 2, 40 diamond drill holes, 6,334m  

• Updated Mineral Resource estimate 

 

The 2006 program allowed better definition of deposit geology and significantly 

increased the amount of ounces in both Moore and Monte Negro deposits.

No significant drilling was undertaken in 2009, but PVDC undertook a major relogging 

program of all historical drill core, carried out detailed geological mapping of pits and 

construction excavations, and reinterpreted the geological models underpinning 

resource and reserve estimates.   

 

In 2010, PVDC continued the detailed geological mapping of the pits and construction 

excavations, and also undertook a close-spaced reverse circulation (RC) grade control 

drilling program for Phase 1 pit shells in the Moore and Monte Negro open pits.

10 DRILLING 
Much of the following drilling description is taken from Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 

Drilling campaigns have been conducted by most of the participating companies during 

the history of the Pueblo Viejo Project including Rosario, GENEL JV, MIM, and Placer.  

In 2006, PVDC began its first core drilling campaign to evaluate the Project.  The time 

periods of drilling on the Project are summarized below: 

 

• Rosario – 1970s to the early 1990s 

• GENEL JV – 1996 

• MIM – late 1996 to 1997 

• BGC – 2002 to 2004 

• Placer – 2002 to 2004 

• PVDC – 2006 to present 

 

All pre-PVDC drill campaigns plus the drilling used in the Feasibility Study Mineral 

Resource estimate are listed in Table 10-1.  Figures 10-1 and 10-2 show the drill hole 

locations on the Moore and Monte Negro deposits including the holes drilled by Barrick.

PRE-PVDC DRILLING 

ROSARIO DRILLING 
Rosario employed several drilling methods as summarized in Table 10-1.  Geological 

information was recorded on paper logs or graphic logs for all core, RC, and rotary 

percussion drill holes. 

 

Geology was recorded for deeper holes and for some of the shallow holes.  Very few of 

the shallow holes are relevant to the 2007 Mineral Resource estimate.  No photographs 

of the core were taken, a common practice in the 1970s and 1980s.  The majority of 

holes were vertical with a drill hole spacing ranging from 20 m to 80 m.  Downhole 

surveys were not performed and the type of instrumentation used for surveying collar 

locations is not documented. 

 

Core recoveries were reported to be approximately 50% in areas of mineralization and 

within silicified material.  This was evaluated by Fluor in 1986 with the following 

observations: 

 

• Gold grades varied with different recovery classes.  In zones of 80% to 100% 
recovery, gold values decreased with decreasing core recovery.  In zones of 60% 
to 80% recovery, gold values increased with decreasing recovery.  For recoveries 
less than 60%, gold values were generally low. 

• Silver values were not affected by recovery. 

• Zinc grades exceeding 1.5% decreased with decreasing core recovery.  Zinc 
grades below 1.5% appeared to be unaffected by core recovery. 

 

Fluor concluded that poor core recovery affected gold grades but in both positive and 

negative ways.  It also concluded that in the context of the whole deposit, statistical 

noise was apparent but the data were not biased. 

 

With respect to rotary and RC drill holes, Fluor concluded that, with the exception of the 

P-series RC holes and the RS series of holes below the 250 m elevation in the West 

Flank of the Moore deposit, there was no systematic high bias in RC gold values versus 

core gold values.  Zinc values appeared to be affected by "placering" in overflowing RC 

sampling devices, resulting in a low bias in RC holes.  In any case, most of the shallow

Rev. 0 Page 10-6 

Rosario holes were drilled in oxide areas now mined out and have only limited, if any, 

influence on sulphide mineral resource estimates. 

 

GENEL JV DRILLING 
In 1996, the GENEL JV drilled 20 holes at Pueblo Viejo, eleven in the Moore deposit and 

nine in the Monte Negro deposit (Table 10-1).  Swiss-Boring was contracted to do the 

drilling using HQ core size.  All holes were drilled at an angle.  Downhole surveys were 

performed, but there is no record of the type of instruments used for the surveys.  

GENEL JV used a GPS system to locate drill holes and to survey the existing pits. 

 

AMEC verified 5% of the assay data from these holes 2005 and found no errors in the 

database. 

 

MIM DRILLING 
In late 1996 and into 1997, MIM drilled 31 holes at Pueblo Viejo, 15 in the Moore deposit 

and 16 in the Monte Negro deposit (Table 10-1).  Geocivil was contracted to do the 

drilling.  Core size was HQ with occasional reductions to NQ as necessary to complete 

the holes.  Five holes were vertical and 26 were drilled at an angle. There was 

apparently no downhole surveys performed on these holes.  There is no record of 

instrumentation used to survey collar locations. 

 

Original data documentation is not available from this drilling campaign for database 

confirmation and so the laboratory that analyzed the samples or the methodology used 

cannot be confirmed.  Source certificates for confirmation of the database results are not 

available.  Drill logs were entered into MS Excel and assays presented as printouts. 

 

Placer personnel found some of the core, but because of its very poor condition, it could 

not be relogged or reassayed. 

 

HISTORICAL DRILL HOLE SURVEYING 
It has been concluded that the accuracy of the surveying methods used for GENEL JV 

holes are suitable to support resource estimates.  The accuracy of collar and downhole 

surveys for Rosario and MIM drill holes cannot be confirmed.  However, review of

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 10-7 

comparisons made between the results of these holes and results from more recent 

proximal holes of good quality, it has been taken to be sufficiently accurate to support 

resource estimates. 

 

PLACER DRILLING 
Placer completed 3,039 m of core drilling in 18 holes during 2002 and 15,424 m of core 

drilling in 111 holes during 2004 (Table 10-1).  The drilling used thin-walled NQ rods that 

produce NTW (57 mm) core.  All but one of the holes was angled, allowing the vertical 

sulphide veining to be better represented in the drill hole intercepts.  Placer drilled with 

oriented core to calculate the true orientations of bedding, veining, and faulting in the 

deposit areas. 

 

Drill pads were located using GPS or surface plans where the GPS signal was weak. 

After completion, the drill hole locations were surveyed in UTM coordinates by a 

professional surveyor, translated into the mine coordinate system, and entered into the 

drill hole database.  

 

Two or three downhole surveys were completed in all drill holes using a Sperry-Sun 

single-shot survey camera.  Surveys were spaced every 60 m to 75 m and deviation of 

the drill holes was minimal.  Azimuth readings were corrected to true north by subtracting 

10°.  

 

Drill holes were logged on paper forms using codes, graphic logs, and geologists' 

remarks.  Geological information related to assay intervals was recorded on a geology 

log.  A second log was used to record structural information and a third log used to 

record geotechnical information.  Coded data and remarks were typed into MS Excel 

spreadsheets and edited on site by geology technicians.  Coded data were later 

imported into Gemcom to generate sections for resource modelling. 

 

The following data were recorded on the geological log: 

 

• Lithology – type, interval in metres 

• Assay – interval, sample number (interval normally 2 m but intervals were also 
cut at lithology changes or major structures)

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 10-8 

• Oxidation – oxide, transitional, or sulphide facies 

• Alteration – type, intensity 

• Veining – type, estimated percentage 

• Disseminated sulphides – type, percentage 

 

The following data were recorded on the structural log: 

 

• Oriented Interval – core interval oriented by crayon mark 

• Structure Interval – downhole depth of structure 

• Structure description – type, true thickness (mm), oxidized (Y/N) 

• Structure angle – alpha angle to core axis (0-90°), beta angle from bottom of the 
core to the downhole apex of the structure (0-360°) 

• Vein composition/dominance – minerals in vein listed in order of abundance 

 

The following data were recorded on the geotechnical log (by technicians under the 

supervision of a geologist):  

 

• Drill interval – From-To and length in metres of block-to-block intervals; 1.5 m 
under normal drilling conditions 

• Core recovery – measured in block-to-block intervals  

• Sum of core pieces greater than 10 cm (rock quality designation, or RQD), 
measured from block-to-block intervals 

• Fracture count – number of natural fractures per interval 

• Oriented – whether or not drill interval was successfully marked with orienting 
crayon 

 

Prior to making geotechnical measurements, the entire core interval was removed from 

the core box and placed in a long trough made of angle-iron.  The fractures in the core 

were lined up and artificial fractures were identified.  This process allowed the technician 

to mark the orienting line on the core for a better estimate of core recovery and RQD. 

 

EVALUATION OF DRILLING PROGRAMS 
Validation of the historical drilling information was addressed as part of AMEC's 2005 

Pueblo Viejo Technical Report.  To evaluate the possible biases between drill types and

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 10-9 

to validate the historical Rosario and MIM drilling information, Placer and AMEC 

performed two tests prior to the 2006 Barrick drilling.  The first test compared assays 

from Placer and previous drilling programs.  The second test was a cross section review. 

 

The following conclusions were drawn by Barrick in the 2007 FSU: 

• Approximately 2.5% of the Rosario data have been verified against original 
documents. Extensive evaluations of the possible bias introduced by various 
drilling procedures have been undertaken by Fluor, PAH, Placer, and AMEC. 
After reviewing the drill data, AMEC was of the opinion that the Rosario core, RC, 
and some Rosario conventional rotary data (pre-1975 and some Rosario RS-
series) are generally reliable. There may be some bias in the RC data but those 
holes have been individually evaluated and obvious problems have been 
eliminated. The risk involved in using those data is judged to be acceptable. 
Drilling types that have produced questionable results, such as the P-series 
percussion holes, ST-series rotary holes and select RC holes, have been 
excluded from the database and are not used in the resource estimate. 
 

• GENEL JV data have been verified against original documents and are believed 
to be reliable. 
 

• MIM data have not been verified against original documents and there is some 
risk involved with using those data.  AMEC compared those data to nearby 
Placer data and found that the MIM holes indicated mineralized zones with very 
similar tenors and thicknesses as the Placer and Rosario data. The risk involved 
with using the MIM data is considered acceptable. 
 

• Placer data have been verified against original documents and are believed to be 
reliable. 

 

PVDC further reviewed the historical drill hole data prior to updating the 2007 resource 

estimate (see Section 12). 

 

PVDC DRILLING  
2006 
PVDC completed 10,015 m of core drilling in 53 holes during 2006. The drilling was a 

part of the resource confirmation program conducted by the Barrick Geological Team.  

Six holes totalling 1,506 m were drilled to identify mineralization along high grade trends 

and potential mineralization with high priority targets near the pits.  Forty-two holes 

(7,293 m) tested open mineralization along pit edges to define inferred resources along 

the pit edges, and five holes totalling 1,216 m were drilled to test the pit bottom.

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 10-10 

The drilling was completed using thin-walled NQ rods that produce NTW (57 mm) core. 

Some holes were started on PQ and some holes were reduced to 42 mm.  All the core 

holes drilled by Barrick were angle holes, allowing for a better representation of the 

vertical sulphide veining. 

 

Drill pads were marked with wooden pegs after using GPS to find the pre-selected 

locations.  In areas where the GPS signal was weak, the Rosario bench map and 

IKONOS satellite images were used.  Holes were aligned using foresight and backsight 

pegs. 

 

Two or three downhole surveys were completed in all drill holes using a Sperry-Sun 

single-shot survey camera.  Surveys were spaced every 60 m to 75 m and deviation of 

the drill holes was minimal.  Azimuth readings were corrected to true north by subtracting 

10o.  After completion, a wooden post marked with the drill hole number was placed in 

the collar of every hole.  Final drill hole locations were then surveyed in UTM coordinates 

by a professional surveyor, translated into the mine coordinate system (truncated UTM), 

and entered into the drill hole database. 

 
2007 
Exploration drilling undertaken during 2007, post-dating the Barrick FSU exploration 

programs, concentrated on exploration drilling near the pits, condemnation drilling in the 

proposed plant area, and exploration drilling in outer targets.  A total of 67,127 m of 

drilling was completed resulting in the discovery of new deeper mineralization on the 

east side of Monte Negro and additional mineralization in the west part of the Moore pit. 

 
2008 
During 2008, PVDC completed 121 diamond drill holes for 28,067 m. The programs 

included definition drilling on open mineralization at Monte Negro North, definition drilling 

between the Moore and Monte Negro pits, and geotechnical drilling to define pit slope 

parameters.  In addition, 19 diamond drill holes for 3,366 m were drilled into the 

limestone areas to assist in the definition of limestone quality for construction and 

processing purposes. 

 
2009 
No PVDC drilling was undertaken in 2009.

2010 
In 2010, PVDC undertook a close-spaced RC grade control drilling program for Phase 1 

pit shells in the Moore and Monte Negro pits.  This drilling comprised 1,120 holes for 

38,485 m in the Monte Negro pit and 593 holes for 22,026 m in the Moore pit.  In-fill RC 

drilling of 33 holes for 5,306 m was also carried out within the limestone resource areas. 

 
2011 
PVDC continued close-spaced RC grade control drilling program for Phase 1 pit shells in 

the Moore and Monte Negro pits.  A total of 22,876 m were completed in 2011.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
Much of the following description of sample preparation, analyses, and security is taken 

from Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 

SAMPLING STRATEGY 

PRE-PLACER DRILLING PROGRAMS 
No information is available concerning the sampling strategies used by Rosario during its 

drilling programs.  The record indicates that Rosario generally sampled core on two 

metre intervals with some samples based on lithology.  RC holes were generally 

sampled on two metre intervals.  

 

The GENEL JV sampled on two metre intervals. The core was split into thirds and one-

third was used for the analytical sample. The remainder could be archived or split again 

for metallurgical testwork.  

 

From the records, it appears that MIM samples were collected on two metre intervals 

with adjustments for lithological boundaries. There is no documentation of the approach. 

 

Averaged sample intervals for the different drilling campaigns are summarized in Table 

11-1.

PLACER DIAMOND DRILLING 
Placer sample intervals were normally two metres, but were shortened at lithological, 

structural, or major alteration contacts. Prior to marking the sample intervals, 

geotechnicians photographed and geotechnically logged the core, then a geologist 

quick-logged the core, marking all the geological contacts.  Geotechnicians then marked 

the sample intervals and assigned sample numbers.  After the sample intervals were 

marked, the geologist logged the core in detail and the core was sent for sampling where 

it was cut into halves using a core saw. 

 

PVDC DIAMOND DRILLING 
PVDC adopted Placer's core sampling procedures as described above, with the 

exception that three metre samples are used in non-mineralized zones. 

 

SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

ROSARIO 
Samples were analyzed by fire assay for gold and silver, by LECO combustion furnace 

for carbon, and sulphur and by atomic absorption (AAS) for copper and zinc.  No details 

are available on crush sizes, sub-sample sizes, or final pulp sample weights used during 

sample preparation.  It was reported in a feasibility study undertaken for Rosario by

Stone & Webster International Projects Corporation in 1992 (Stone & Webster, 1992) 

that the analytical procedures used up to that time were of industry standard.  

 

For the sulphide drilling program that started in 1984, two assay laboratories were 

present at site, a mainline laboratory responsible for gold, silver, copper, zinc, and iron 

analyses and a sulphide laboratory responsible for carbon and sulphur analyses.  

Sample preparation methods are not documented for this period. 

 

Security of the samples after removal from the hole is not documented. 

 

GENEL JV 
It is inferred from discussions in GENEL JV documents, that samples were prepared on 

site by GENEL JV personnel.  A one-third split of the core was crushed to minus 10 

mesh, homogenized by passing through a Gilson splitter three times and sub-sampled to 

about 400 g using a Gilson splitter.  The sub-sample was packaged and sent to Chemex 

Laboratories Ltd. in Vancouver, BC, Canada (Chemex) where presumably the final 

pulverization was undertaken.  In GENEL JV documents, the final pulp grain size is not 

stated.  

 

Samples were assayed at Chemex for gold, silver, zinc, copper, sulphur, and carbon.  

The procedures are not stated in GENEL JV documentation.  A 32-element ICP analysis 

(G-32 ICP) was performed on each sample.  

 

Security measures utilized by the GENEL JV are not documented. 

 

MIM 
No details are available on the sample preparation, analytical procedures, or security 

measures for the MIM samples. 

 

Core from Rosario, MIM, and GENEL JV drilling was previously stored in inadequate 

storage facilities, which led to severe oxidation of the remaining core rendering it of 

limited value.

PLACER 
During the 2002 and 2004 programs, drill core was cut in half with a diamond blade saw 

at site.  The second half of the 2002 core was consumed in metallurgical testwork.  The 

archived half of 2004 core was stored on site for future reference in suitable storage 

conditions.  The other half was placed in plastic sample bags marked with the 

appropriate sample number and sealed with a numbered security tag (zap-strap).  The 

manager of the drilling company drove the samples from the site to the airport 

unaccompanied by a Placer employee.  The core samples were sent to Vancouver using 

airfreight and were received by ALS Chemex Labs Ltd. (ALS).  No record was kept of the 

state of the security tags when logged into ALS.  

 

The samples were prepared by marking all bags with a bar code, drying and weighing 

the sample, crushing the entire sample to greater than 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh), 

and splitting off 250 g.  The split was pulverized to better than 85% passing 75 µm (200 

mesh) and was used for analysis. The remaining sample was stored at ALS in 

Aldergrove, BC, Canada. 

 

Samples were assayed for gold, silver, copper, zinc, carbon, sulphur, and iron using the 

analytical techniques listed in Table 11-2.  In addition to these elements, multi-element 

analysis was performed on 80 samples from drill hole PD02-003 using ALS's ME-MS61 

procedure.  In 2004, every other sample from all drill holes was also analyzed using the 

ME-MS41 procedure. 

 

All drill core samples from the Placer drilling programs were analyzed for total carbon by 

ALS's C IR07 LECO furnace procedure. To ensure that the total carbon values 

represented organic carbon, a suite of 114 samples were reanalyzed by the C-IR6 

procedure which removes all inorganic carbonate by leaching the sample prior to LECO 

analysis.  The sample suite represented all of the lithologies found in the deposit area.  

All exhibited advanced argillic alteration or silicification of varying intensities.  The results 

showed that the total carbon analysis was representative of organic carbon in samples 

with advanced argillic alteration or silicification.

PVDC 
PVDC drill core is cut in half with a diamond blade saw at site.  The entire second half of 

core is kept for records and future metallurgical testwork.  The archived half of the core 

is stored on site for future reference in suitable storage conditions.  The sampled half is 

placed in plastic sample bags marked with the appropriate sample number and sealed 

with a numbered security tag.   

 

Core samples from 2006 and early 2007 were shipped directly to ALS (ISO 9001, 

ISO/IEC 17025).  PVDC requested fire assay (FA) with atomic absorption (AA) finish for 

gold and silver on 30 g aliquots and gravimetric finishes (GR) for all assays exceeding 

10 g/t Au.  A 32-element ICP analysis was done on all samples.  All of the LECO furnace 

assays for 2006 and 2007 were done at Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd., Vancouver 

(ACME) (ISO 9001).  PVDC switched to ACME in February 2007.  In 2007, PVDC 

changed the crushing specification from at least 70% passing 10 mesh to 80% passing 

10 mesh and also modified the analytical protocols.  The gold fire assay aliquot was 

increased to 50 g and ICP was used for silver, copper, and zinc.  Silver values over 50 

ppm were reanalyzed using FA-GR and copper and zinc values over 10,000 ppm were 

reanalyzed using a total digestion method.

ACME set up a sample preparation facility at the Pueblo Viejo site in 2007.  RPA 

previously visited the ACME facility while at the site and found it was clean, organized, 

and professionally operated.  Since mid-2010, PVDC has been preparing the sub-

samples on-site and sending the pulverized samples to commercial laboratories: ACME 

in Santiago, Chile, and ALS in Lima, Peru.  Construction of the on-site laboratory is 

expected to be completed in late 2011. 

 

Figure 11-1 shows PVDC's on-site sample preparation flow sheet.  In RPA's opinion, 

sampling by Placer and PVDC has been performed appropriately for the style of 

mineralization present at Pueblo Viejo.  Sampling of the pre-Placer samples may have 

been adequate, but there is little in the way of documentation to confirm this.  Sample 

preparation for the Rosario and MIM samples has not been documented. 

 

PVDC currently requests gold assays by FA with AA on 30 g aliquots and gravimetric 

finishes for all assays exceeding 10 g/t Au.  Silver and zinc values are analyzed using 

aqua regia digestion method and AA finish.  A 35-element inductively coupled plasma 

atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis is done on all samples.  Sulphur and 

carbon are assayed by LECO furnace.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures have varied significantly 

during the work history at Pueblo Viejo.  AMEC (2005) found the QA/QC data pertaining 

to all the historical (pre-2005) drilling programs, except GENEL JV, to be inadequate for 

proper validation of the assay results.  Placer data from 2002 to 2004 was found to be 

adequate, but improved QA/QC protocols would benefit future drill programs.   

 

ROSARIO 
The number of check assays completed for the Rosario drill holes is limited but provides 

a level of confidence for specific drill holes.  In general, Rosario did not insert duplicates, 

blanks and standards, however, they did send replicates in 1978 and 1985 to outside 

laboratories.   

 

In 1978, Rosario sent 1,586 replicate samples from ten drill holes to Union Assay 

Laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The gold check assays exhibited substantial scatter, 

including several obvious outliers.  Some of the scatter may have been due to sample 

swaps, but most of it was unexplained.  There was a small bias just outside a reasonable 

acceptance limit of 5%.  Overall, excluding obvious outliers, the data corresponded 

reasonably well.  The silver data was similar to the gold data in the significant amount of 

scatter and the large number of outliers.  There was a small (5%) bias between the 

laboratories.  Copper exhibited a small amount of scatter and no appreciable bias 

between the laboratories.  Zinc exhibited more scatter than copper but less than gold 

and silver, although some of the outliers appeared to be sample swaps.  There was 

about a 7% bias between the laboratories (direction of bias not stated). 

 

In 1985, Rosario sent samples to three laboratories for gold, silver, carbon, and sulphur 

assay validation including: 

 

• 392 samples sent to the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute (CSMRI) 
for check assaying of the Au and Ag values in three batches. 
 

• 236 samples sent to Hazen Laboratories. 
 

• 154 samples sent to AMAX Research and Development Laboratory for sulphur 
and carbon analysis.  Results for these checks have not been located.

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 11-9 

AMEC (2005) reviewed the CSMRI check and reported that gold results generally 

corresponded well, but there were a number of outliers, possibly caused by sample 

swaps.  The same conclusions were drawn for silver.  AMEC also noted that there was a 

small bias between the two laboratories of about 7% (direction of bias not stated). 

 

GENEL 
The GENEL JV used a combination of duplicate and Standard Reference Materials 

(SRMs) to monitor the quality of its assays and a detailed review of the results found that 

the relative error of the 171 duplicates at the 90th percentile was 14%, which is very 

good precision for gold mineralization, and that the standard results were generally 

within acceptable limits (AMEC, 2005).  However, the standard dataset includes many 

results that exceed the accepted limits and it is not known if these samples were 

reassayed. 

 

MIM 
The MIM samples have no known QA/QC data.   

 

PLACER 
In 2002, Placer inserted SRMs as every 20th sample to the primary laboratory, ALS.  The 

SRMs where commercially purchased for gold only and corresponded to the average 

grade and cut-off grade at the time.  Plots of gold versus batch number showed that the 

majority of the SRMs returned values within two standard deviations of their established 

means. 

 

In 2004, Placer began inserting one blank (barren limestone) in addition to one SRM 

with every batch of 20 samples.  All of these standards and the blank were assayed for 

Au, Ag, C, S, Cu, Fe, and Zn and provide a basis to evaluate the performance of those 

elements.  AMEC calculated best values for all of the elements in each sample based on 

the results from ALS.  Gold was the only certified value, and the best values calculated 

from the ALS data were indistinguishable from the certified values indicating that ALS 

generally performed well.  The blank data (380 analyses) generally showed blank values 

except for ten anomalous of these samples which were inadvertently switched for SRMs.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 11-10 

Placer also monitored the ALS internal quality control results for its blanks, duplicates, 

and SRMs.  As well, Placer sent approximately ten sample pulps from every drill hole, 

resulting in 187 samples, or 13% of the total samples, from the 2002 drill program, to 

ACME.  An additional 247 sample pulps were shipped during the 2004 drilling program 

and were analyzed for gold only.  SRMs were not inserted into the external check pulp 

shipments.  Results for gold, copper, and zinc indicated no significant biases between 

the two laboratories.  The ALS Chemex silver assays, however, averaged approximately 

12% lower than ACME. 

 

ALS QUALITY CONTROL 
ALS conducted analytical quality control in its laboratory by inserting blanks, standards, 

and duplicates into every sample run, results being reviewed by laboratory staff.   

 

PVDC 
PVDC inserted two blanks, two standards (commercial and custom), and two core 

duplicates into each batch of 75 samples sent to ALS.  From February 2007 onwards, 

PVDC inserted two blanks, two to three standards (commercial and custom), two core 

duplicates, two coarse duplicates, and seven cleaning blanks into each batch of 76 

samples prepared on the site and sent to ACME.  Since August 1, 2007, PVDC began 

sending 5% of the pulps to a secondary laboratory (SGS in Peru) and, as of January 

2008, was still working towards getting external check assays for 5% of all of its 

samples.  The ACME on-site preparation facility carried out regular granulometric control 

tests on approximately three percent of the crushed and pulverized material.  The results 

were monitored by ACME and PVDC personnel. 

 

From July 2006 to August 2007, PVDC sent 29,977 samples and 2,997 control samples, 

or 10%, to ALS and ACME.  The control samples included 958 blanks, 960 core 

duplicates, and 1,079 SRMs.  The blank results show a significant reduction in failures in 

February 2007, coincident with the changeover to ACME.  The scatter plots compiled by 

PVDC indicate fairly poor precision for core duplicates, probably in the ±30% to ±40% 

range for assays in the 2 g/t Au to 4 g/t Au range.  Scatter plots for the duplicates were 

also compiled on a monthly basis and some months exhibit significantly more scatter 

than others, suggesting that some parts of the deposit, such as the Stage III veined 

areas, have much higher nugget effects than other parts.

Rev. 0 Page 11-11 

PVDC made five custom SRMs, averaging approximately 1 g/t Au to 10 g/t Au, from 

Pueblo Viejo mineralization.  PVDC also inserted five commercial SRMs in 2006.  

Surprisingly, the commercial SRMs had much higher failure rates, in the 5% to 10% 

range, compared with the in-house standards with failure rates of generally less than 1% 

to 2%.  No gold assaying bias is evident from any of the standard quality control charts.   

  

Monitoring is completed on a batch by batch basis.  For check samples that fell outside 

of the established control limits, PVDC examined the cause and, if found not to be the 

result of a sample number switch, the relevant batch was re-assayed.  Corrective actions 

taken by PVDC are detailed in its in-house resource database and reports. 

 

A PDVC internal quarterly report details the QA/QC results of the check samples for 

January to August 2010 on the RC grade control drilling currently underway.  A total of 

32,437 samples were dispatched in 560 shipments including 2,161 SRMs (6.7%), 2,161 

blanks (6.7%), and 2,166 field duplicates (6.7%).  Samples were sent to ACME from 

January to May and to ALS from June to August.  Nine SRMs were available for 

insertion into the sample stream.  Monitoring of the results required reanalysis of 136 

groups of samples.  Selected control charts for the SRMs are shown in Figure 11-2.  

Control Charts for the blanks and field duplicates are shown in Figures 11-3 and 11-4.

RPA SUMMARY AND COMMENTS 
QA/QC procedures have varied significantly during the history of work at Pueblo Viejo.  

During the time of Rosario's operation, QA/QC consisted of two batches of check assays 

sent to a second laboratory without duplicate, blank, or standard samples.  Although the 

QA/QC was sub-standard relative to current industry practice, it must be viewed in its 

historical context and check assaying was the industry standard for QA/QC at that time. 

 

MIM sample data lack any QA/QC validation.  The quality of those data is indeterminate.  

There is no reason to believe that there are any problems with those data, but the quality 

cannot be directly evaluated.  Comparison of the tenor and thickness of mineralized 

zones defined by the MIM data with tenor and thickness of mineralized zones defined by 

the Placer and GENEL JV indicate that the grades are similar. 

 

Placer relied on two standards and check assaying for QA/QC.  No duplicate samples 

were analyzed and the check analysis program included no certified reference materials 

or blank samples.  RPA considers Placer assay data to meet a minimum standard to 

include in resource model and estimates. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the QA/QC results from PVDC are acceptable and have shown that 

sample preparation carried out by PVDC and assaying completed by the commercial 

laboratories are suitable for resource estimate purposes.  RPA is also of the opinion that 

sample security is adequate and meets industry standards.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
Much of the following description of data verification is taken from Barrick's 2007 FSU 

with additional material from AMC's 2011 Technical Report. 

 

PRE-PLACER DATA 
American Mine Services (AMS), as part of the 1992 Stone & Webster (1992) study, 

developed a computer database consisting of drill hole collar locations, assays and 

assay intervals, and geological data.  The AMS database formed the foundation of the 

database provided to GENEL JV and MIM in 1995 and subsequently acquired by Placer.  

Placer compared the GENEL JV database with that provided by Rosario and confirmed 

that only minor changes had been made since AMS's validation exercise.  The changes 

were corrected based on original Rosario assay sheets and drill logs at the Pueblo Viejo 

site.  

 

Placer compared drill locations and assay grades to original paper plans and sections at 

the mine site.  Drill hole collar maps were plotted using the computer database and 

compared against hand-drawn maps and typewritten drill hole collar reports.  A complete 

description of the validation work is contained in Placer (2003). 

 

For the MIM drill holes, original drill logs or assay certificates are not available for 

validation.  Assay data for MIM drill holes was received electronically.  For the GENEL 

JV drill holes, the original assay certificates, which were used to validate the assay 

database and copies of drill logs, were printed from an MS Excel database.  These were 

entered from the original logs, which have been lost.  Survey notes are not available to 

validate the GENEL JV collar data.  Placer checked 8% of the Rosario samples, 64% of 

the GENEL JV samples, none of the MIM samples, and 0.8% of its own samples and 

found very few data entry errors.  

 

DRILL HOLE PSEUDO PAIRINGS 
Rosario "pseudo" twin assay pair testing was completed by AMEC (2005).  The test 

compared results of nearby holes by searching for Rosario samples near Placer drill 

holes (2002 and 2004 drilling programs) and also using earlier drilling by GENEL JV.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 12-2 

Assays from Placer and GENEL JV drilling were paired with assays from Rosario drilling 

using different search radii and AMEC constructed declustered QQ plots and confirmed 

conclusions by Placer.  The work generally showed that Rosario drilling was reliable, 

although biases where noted at grades higher than 6 g/t Au and below 2 g/t Au (Figure 

12-1). 

 

FIGURE 12-1   AMEC DRILL HOLE COMPARISON 

 
 

HISTORICAL TWINNED HOLE COMPARISONS 
As part of the 1986 Feasibility Study, Fluor (1986) undertook "twinned" hole comparison, 

looking at closely spaced drill holes applying a metal accumulation (grade x interval 

thickness) approach.  Fluor concluded that there was no significant gold, silver, and zinc 

biases and that "carbon assays were consistently lower by 7% and zinc assays were 

lower on average by 36% than the original hole".  One hole, RS-40, was removed from 

the resource estimation database because it appeared to have been drilled down a near-

vertical mineralized structure.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 12-3 

AMEC (2005) compiled a list of "twinned" holes (Table 12-1) and found that the wide 

divergence in "twinned" hole behaviour allowed no simple conclusions to be drawn.  

AMEC also observed that there was a tendency for RC holes to return somewhat higher 

grades and metal contents than core holes, due possibly in part to localized, downhole 

contamination in the RC holes; and that there appeared to be zones within the Pueblo 

Viejo deposits where the grades were extremely erratic and holes separated by only a 

few metres returned very different results.  AMEC concluded that this probably explained 

many of the differences observed between twin holes.  RPA notes that the 39 "twinned" 

holes in Table 12-1 represent pairs of holes with collars that are located within 

approximately one metre to ten metres.  Normally, twinned holes are drilled to compare 

the reliability of different sample media and diamond drill holes are used to validate RC 

holes.   

 

The types of "twin" hole pairs are summarized in Table 12-2.  There are 26 pairs of holes 

that are of the same type, including eighteen rotary air blast (RAB) pairs, five diamond 

drill hole pairs, and three RC pairs.  These 26 pairs are useful for investigating short-

range variability, which is reported to be high locally (AMEC, 2005).  Some of these 

same type drill hole pairs may have been a second test of holes with unusually high or 

low values.  These 26 pairs cannot be used to validate the results from specific historical 

drilling programs.

Placer (2005) used the average of 17 "twin" holes (Table 12-3), including four pairs that 

are spaced more than 10 m apart and that are not included in Table 12-3, to conclude 

that:  

 

the average grades of the twinned hole results compare well, within 10% of each 

other.  There does not appear to be any obvious trends between drilling methods, as 

many of the different drilling methods compare well.   

 

Placer (2005) excluded two additional twin pairs (RC16-RS40 and DDH259-RC47) 

because of poor results and did not use RS-40 in its resource estimate.  Placer excluded 

all of the ST series holes due to concerns related to poor sampling techniques and all of 

the SX holes because they were outside the resource area.  Some 58 R-series, 38 RS-

series, and 18 DDH-series holes were also excluded due to contamination concerns or 

because the holes were situated outside the resource area.

RPA is wary of the manner in which twin hole data have been compiled and documented 

in previous studies.  RPA compiled results of six DDHs and three RC holes that twin 

RAB holes and four DDH that twin RC holes (Table 12-4).

The RAB holes can be divided into shallow rotary holes (AH, HA, CU, MN, MO, ST, SX, 

and R-series) and the deeper RS-series rotary holes.  The AH-, CU-, HA-, and SX-series 

holes are less relevant because they were drilled mostly on targets outside the resource 

area.  Only three shallow rotary holes have been twinned and these limited results 

suggest that the AH-series holes are unreliable as they significantly overstate the grade.  

The single R-series rotary hole from 0 m to 92 m compares very well with hole RC51, 

collared 8.8 m away.  In general, the four DDH and the single RC hole (excluding RS40)

match the RS-series holes reasonably well, with the exception of DDH131-RS83 and the 

likely contaminated deeper portion of hole RS11 from 84 m to 130 m.   

 

The results for three out of the four RC holes that were twinned by DDH are very poor.  

The electronic database only contains core recovery data for the PVDC holes and does 

not contain any water table information. 

 

Neither Placer nor PVDC twinned any holes, with the exception of GT04-10, which is a 

low grade geotechnical hold drilled by Placer.  All of the twinned hole data except for the 

MIM hole were generated by Rosario. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that the assay results from some of the Rosario drill holes, either 

entire holes or portions thereof, may be biased slightly to significantly low or high.  This 

is consistent with the Fluor (1986) observation that poor core recovery did affect gold 

grades in samples, but in both positive and negative ways, and that in the context of the 

whole deposit, "statistical noise" was apparent – but the data were not biased. 

 

In RPA's opinion, there are some data that indicate that some of the Rosario drill holes 

are unreliable.  In general, RPA believes that drill hole data should not be excluded from 

a resource estimate unless compelling evidence supports doing so.  Each hole or 

interval that is excluded from a resource estimate needs proper justification and should 

be documented on an individual basis.   

 

VERIFICATION OF PRE-PVDC DATA 

PLACER DATA 
AMEC compared one in twenty samples in the Placer part of the assay database with 

original assay certificates and found no errors.  Approximately 5% of the Placer assay 

values in the database were checked against original assay certificates. 

 

DOWNHOLE CONTAMINATION OF RC AND ROTARY HOLES 
AMEC investigated the possibility of downhole contamination in the RC portion of the 

drilling at Pueblo Viejo.  AMEC's review focused on the two specific downhole 

contamination problems that can occur in RC drilling: cyclicity and decay.  Cyclicity is the

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 12-10 

tendency of metal to concentrate at the bottom of holes during pauses in drilling, which 

typically occurs when rods are changed but can happen at any time during the drilling 

process.  Collapse of unstable zones in RC holes tends to occur when drilling is stopped. 

Decay is the tendency of material from soft, gold-bearing zones to travel down hole, 

contaminating samples from less mineralized material.  This usually is expressed as a 

gradual diminishing of values down hole.  This feature can also occur naturally due to 

halos of low grade material around high grade material. Typically, cyclicity and decay are 

linked. Gold grades can be enhanced by both factors. 

 

AMEC investigated the possibility of downhole contamination in nine Rosario RC holes 

(RC-series), 16 Rosario rotary holes (RS-series), and 34 other Rosario rotary holes (ST-

series).  It concluded that the 59 holes investigated showed greater or lesser degrees of 

possible downhole contamination.  However, with the exception of the ST series holes, 

contamination was not believed to be a widespread problem. 

 

GOLD GRADE DISTRIBUTION COMPARISONS 
Barrick used gold grade histograms of the historical drilling campaigns, each compared 

to a histogram of gold assays from all drilling, to identify those campaigns with 

unacceptable gold grade biases. The comparisons were broken out by company and 

drilling type. Only the drill holes used for the resource estimate were considered.  

 

The histograms show that the diamond core drilling from all campaigns except PVDC 

compare well with the global distribution. The PVDC drilling was targeted at the 

periphery of the existing mineralization so that overall lower grades would be expected 

(Figure 12-2).  The RC and rotary drilling compare well also, with the exception of the 

Placer rotary holes (Figure 12-3) which are biased high and were possibly preferentially 

drilled in shallow high grade areas to better delineate early production.  The information 

from these holes should have been removed from the database, but this does not 

constitute a material issue to the Project. 

 

CROSS SECTIONAL REVIEW OF MIM, ROSARIO, AND PLACER DRILLING 
Barrick reviewed the assays from cross sections on the computer screen and assessed 

the similarity of the MIM, GENEL JV, Rosario, and Placer drilling in both the Moore and 

Monte Negro deposits.  In general, there is close agreement of the orientation, tenor,

DRILL HOLE DATABASE VALIDATION 
The Pueblo Viejo resource database is regularly validated by mine staff using mining 

software validation routines and by regularly checking the drill hole data on-screen 

visually.  Barrick also runs a number of MS Access queries to validate the database 

(Métail, 2007).   

 

SUMMARY 
Extensive evaluations of the possible bias introduced by various drilling procedures have 

been by Fluor, Placer, and AMEC and, more recently, by PVDC.  AMC and RPA have 

also undertaken checks of database information against original data, and visually 

reviewed cross-sectional plots of drilling information. 

 

The Rosario core, RC, and some rotary data are generally reliable but may be locally 

inaccurate. Those data that are considered to be of questionable validity have not been 

used in PVDC resource estimates.  Most of the shallow Rosario drill holes were drilled in 

oxide areas now mined out and have virtually no influence on sulphide mineral resource 

estimates. 

 

GENEL JV and Placer data have been verified and are considered reliable. 

 

A portion of the PVDC data has been reviewed by AMC and RPA and is considered to 

be satisfactory. 

 

Based on our past evaluations and our current review, it is RPA's opinion that the data 

are acceptable for the purposes of overall resource and reserve estimation and 

economic assessments.  Some of the data may result in minor inaccuracies in local 

estimates.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
The following description of mineral processing and metallurgical testing is largely taken 

from Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 

INTRODUCTION 
The Pueblo Viejo Mine consists of two open pits: Moore and Monte Negro.  The ore from 

these two deposits is refractory and consists primarily of gold and silver intimately 

associated with pyrite that occurs as encapsulated submicron particles and in solid 

solution.  As a result, there is a requirement to chemically break down the pyrite to 

recover the precious metals.  In addition, there are cyanide consuming minerals and 

preg-robbing carbonaceous material in some of the ores.  Pyrite and sphalerite are the 

two main sulphide minerals, both occurring in veins and disseminated within the host 

rock. 

 

Using lithological and mineralization criteria, five metallurgical ore types have been 

defined, including two at Moore and three at Monte Negro.  The main criterion used to 

define metallurgical domains was carbon content, i.e., separating carbonaceous rocks 

from lower carbon-content rocks in each deposit.  Table 13-1 summarizes the 

metallurgical ore types. 

 

The metallurgical ore types are based on an arbitrary boundary between the Moore and 

Monte Negro deposits.  Although Barrick has now built a continuous lithology model that 

incorporates both deposits, this boundary is a carry-over from Placer work, which had 

separate geology interpretations for each deposit.

Preg-
robbing Description 

MO-BSD Moore Black 
Sediment 

Moderate Fine interbeds of carbonaceous shale and siltstone.  
Bedding is sub-horizontal and is intersected by 
vertical sulphide veins.  It is a main lithology and 
exposed within the Moore pit. 
 

MO-VCL Moore 
Volcaniclastic 

No A group of volcanic (andesitic) lithology units in the 
Moore pit.  Units include massive and fragmental 
volcanic flows as well as sedimentary units 
composed primarily of volcanic material.  These units 
typically have lower organic carbon content. 
 

MN-BSD Monte Negro 
Black 
Sediment 

Moderate Interbeds of carbonaceous shale, siltstone, and 
volcanic flows. Beds are up to three metres thick and 
have a shallow dip to the south.  The carbonaceous 
beds are similar to MO-BSD and comprise more than 
50% of MN-BSD.  The unit is exposed in the eastern 
half of the Monte Negro pit. 
 

MN-VCL Monte Negro 
Volcaniclastic 

Weak Similar to MN-BSD except that the unit is less than 
30% carbonaceous beds.  It is exposed in the 
western half of the Monte Negro pit. 
 

MN-SP Monte Negro 
Spilite 

No Volcanic spilite (andesite) flows are found at depth.  It 
is currently exposed only at the north end of the 
Monte Negro pit. 

 

GOLD DEPORTMENT 
In addition to the mineralogical examinations used to identify gold association in the 

various types of mineralization reported in Section 7 of this report, diagnostic leach 

procedures were also used.  Test results showed that approximately 55% to 70% of the 

gold is encapsulated in sulphide minerals and is not recoverable by cyanide leaching 

without prior destruction of the sulphide matrix.  For the two black sedimentary ore types, 

MO-BSD and MN-BSD, 19% to 29% of the gold in the ore was preg-robbed by gold 

adsorption onto organic carbon. 

 

For MO-VCL, MN-SP, and MN-VCL ore types, 6% to 9% of the gold was also preg-

robbed.  This may be caused by gold adsorption onto sulphide minerals as these ore

types contain very little organic carbon.  Laboratory tests have demonstrated that the 

preg-robbing ability of the ore is reduced after the ore is oxidized in an autoclave.  At a 

grind size of 80% passing 150 µm, less than 2% of the gold in the ore was locked up in 

the silicate gangue minerals.  

 

Metallurgical testwork indicated that pressure oxidation (POX) of the whole ore followed 

by CIL cyanidation of the autoclave product will recover 88% to 95% (average 91.6%) of 

the gold and 86% to 89% (average 87%) of the silver. 

 

VARIATION IN SULPHUR GRADE 
The efficient and trouble free operation of the POX circuit relies heavily on maintaining 

relatively constant sulphur content in the autoclave feed.  If the variability of the sulphur 

grade in the short-term is significant, it may be necessary to blend ores with different 

sulphur content in the mine.  For this reason, the short-term variability in the sulphur 

content of the ore was assessed extensively in 2004.  Block models for sulphur grade 

were developed on a block size of 50 m x 50 m x 10 m containing roughly 70,000 tonnes 

of ore.  The result of this exercise showed that there is a wide variation in the sulphur 

content of the ore as the blocks are mined sequentially. The variation in sulphur grade 

ranges from 3% to 20% and generally between 5% and 10%. 

 

Blending is necessary to maintain a relatively constant sulphur grade to the autoclave 

feed.  Blending will be practiced by the mine through mine planning and blending of ores 

prior to crushing.  In the mill, some blending will occur as a result of the surge capacity 

provided for the autoclave feed.  Although there will still be variation in the sulphur 

grade, this variation will not happen abruptly, but rather in a slow and controlled 

predictive manner.  Therefore, adjustment in process conditions to suit the sulphur 

content of the feed can be anticipated. 

 

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOLD AND SULPHUR GRADES 
There appears to be a relationship between the gold and sulphur grades.  Placer (2004) 

showed that the relationship could be described by the regression equation:

% S = 6.330 x Gold Grade (g/t) 0.121 

 

The relationship between sulphur grade and gold grade is illustrated in Figure 13-1, 

while the relationship between the gold to sulphur ratio and gold grade is given in Figure 

13-2. 

 

Based on these relationships, Placer concluded: 

 

• For a fixed sulphur throughput, revenue can be increased by mining to an 
elevated cut-off grade during the early years of operation; and 

• Pre-concentration of the lower grade ore (1 g/t to 2 g/t gold) and treating the 
pyrite concentrate product in the autoclave circuit will not be economically viable 
because of the very high sulphur to gold ratio.

As Table 13-2 shows, gold recoveries predicted from the testwork were in the range of 

80% to 84%.  Each of the concepts that were capable of yielding gold recoveries in this 

range involved expensive destruction of the sulphide minerals by either roasting or 

oxidative leaching. 

 

PLACER AND BARRICK METALLURGICAL TESTWORK (2003-2007) 
INTRODUCTION 
Bio-oxidation of whole ore and flotation concentrate, and ultra-fine grinding of flotation 

concentrates, were subsequently investigated by Placer as alternative pre-treatment 

options prior to CIL cyanide leaching for gold and silver recovery.  Ultimately, a fairly 

straightforward process based on POX of the whole ore followed by CIL cyanidation was 

selected for the recovery of gold and silver. Two innovations have also been 

incorporated into the process design: 

 

• A hot cure of the slurry from the autoclave to reduce lime consumption by solid 
basic ferric sulphate in the CIL circuit. 
 

• A lime boil process, involving heating the CCD washed slurry to 80ºC to 85ºC 
with 35 kg CaO/t to release the silver in the jarosites formed in the autoclave for 
improved CIL silver recovery. 

 
SAMPLES FOR METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
A number of ore samples from each of the five ore types were used for the initial 

metallurgical investigations.  These samples were assayed in detail before being used in 

the various test programs.  The following information is relevant to the processes 

considered: 

• The gold content of the ore samples ranged from 2.10 g/t to 6.60 g/t. 
 

• The sulphur content ranged from 6.9% to 9.7%. 
 

• The ores contained insignificant amounts of elemental sulphur and sulphates. 
 

• The black sedimentary ore types (MO-BSD and MN-BSD) contained from 0.5% 
to 0.7% organic and graphitic carbon, which caused preg-robbing in the later 
leaching tests. The other ore types have very weak or no preg-robbing ability. 
 

• The carbonate content varied from 0.05% to 0.37% CO2 but averaged 0.19% 
CO2. 
 

• The aluminum content ranged from 7% to 10%.

Rev. 0 Page 13-8 

• The mercury content ranged from 8 g/t to 14 g/t. The extent of mercury 
dissolution during POX varied significantly according to the ore type. 
 

• The arsenic content ranged from 260 g/t to 1,650 g/t. Most of the arsenic was 
dissolved and precipitated during POX. 

 

Three ore types were used for the later metallurgical investigation.  Similarly, these 

samples were composited and assayed in detail before being used in the test programs 

to confirm the effectiveness of the silver enhancement process.  The following 

information is relevant to the process evolved: 

 

• The gold content of the ore samples ranged from 5.3 g/t to 5.6 g/t. 

• The silver content of the ore samples ranged from 19.6 g/t to 36.1 g/t. 

 
COMMINUTION TESTWORK 
The original Placer Feasibility Study circuit was designed with high pressure grinding 

rolls (HPGR) technology. Subsequent trade-off studies concluded that a conventional 

semi-autogenous-ball milling-crushing circuit offered superior economics.  

 

Work index (Wi) measurements on the five main rock types undertaken in 2004 indicated 

that the Bond ball mill Wi of the ore will vary from 12.8 kWh/t to 16.1 kWh/t (average 14.4 

kWh/t), while the rod mill Wi will vary from 14.9 kWh/t to 18.6 kWh/t.  Supplementary 

testwork undertaken on 58 different samples in April 2006 for SAG Power Index (SPI®) 

and Wi returned consistently higher Wi values (Table 13-3).

Average 17.05 18.17 15.62 16.73

The Bond ball mill Wi used to size the grinding mills was the average Wi for the hardest 

of the five ore types (MN-SP) and approximately the 80th percentile Wi of all ore types. 

 

Grinding simulations using the Minnovex proprietary program "Comminution Economic 

Evaluation Tool", or CEET®, were undertaken using SPI® values from all 58 samples.

Rev. 0 Page 13-9 

The result of these simulations was almost identical to Fluor's SAG mill power estimate 

when using the 18.1 kWh/t ball mill Wi. 

 
WHOLE ORE PRESSURE OXIDATION 
Whole ore POX followed by CIL was selected as the preferred process option in July 

2003 after a reasonable power cost was assured.  POX gave higher gold recoveries for 

all the Pueblo Viejo ore types tested, using a technically robust, proven process.  POX is 

energy intensive, more so than most other refractory processing options.  Due to the 

complexity of the autoclaves and associated oxygen plant, POX is also capital intensive.  

The higher gold recovery and associated cash flow mitigate the high energy operating 

cost and the high capital cost of the oxidation circuit. 

 

Extensive batch and continuous pilot autoclave testwork was undertaken at the Barrick 

Technology Centre (BTC, formerly the Placer Dome Research Centre) and at SGS 

Lakefield Research Limited (SGS Lakefield).  Testwork at SGS Lakefield included a two-

week POX pilot plant program in 2004.  The results of the testwork undertaken on whole 

ore at the design autoclave operating conditions and grind size P80 of 80 µm is 

summarized in Figure 13-3.   

 

Scale formation inside the autoclave was an issue during pilot plant operation.  Most of 

the scale, which comprised basic ferric sulphate and lesser hematite, was formed in the 

first compartment and became increasingly less severe towards the end of autoclave. 

Severe scale formation can offer brick or liner protection inside the autoclave, but it can 

also impair agitation efficiency, oxygen injection and dispersion, slurry flow and control of 

slurry levels in the autoclave.  Analysis of the scale chemistry and review of scale 

formation and management in other autoclave circuits have led to design features 

aligned to help prevent the formation of scale.  Allowance has also been made in the 

autoclave operating strategy and maintenance schedule for control of scale formation.

HOT CURE  
At a temperature significantly below the autoclave operating temperature of 230°C, basic 

ferric sulphate formed during POX at this temperature dissolves to form ferric ions in 

acidic solution.  The test program showed that by holding the autoclave flash discharge 

slurry for a period of 12 hours at 85°C to 100°C, the basic ferric sulphate solids formed in 

the autoclave re-dissolves to form ferric sulphate in solution.  The formed ferric ions are 

washed away from the CIL feed in the three-stage CCD washing thickener circuit.  The 

re-dissolution of basic ferric sulphate takes place in what has been termed the hot curing 

step in the flow sheet. 

 

With the addition of the hot cure, it becomes possible to remove the effects of high lime 

consumption in CIL and concentrate on the optimization of the POX process.  It is 

preferable to operate with as high as possible a temperature in POX to allow for the 

fastest kinetics.  A temperature of 230°C was considered the maximum practical 

temperature for POX and was therefore chosen for all subsequent tests. 

 
COUNTER CURRENT DECANTATION (CCD) 
Three-stage CCD washing was tested as part of the POX pilot plant operation in 2006.  

Based on this testwork, 99.3% wash efficiency is expected with an average thickener 

underflow density of 40% solids.  These results confirm the three-stage CCD washing 

circuit testwork undertaken for each of the five ore types in the original pilot plant 

operation in April 2004. 

 
LIME BOIL 
In 2006, a lime boil/CIL study was undertaken to improve the silver recovery. 

 

Bench scale tests were performed using washed, CCD thickened and underflow slurry 

for the tested ore composites.  Liberation of silver was shown to reach completion within 

two hours.  No apparent improvement in gold extraction was observed with longer 

retention times.  Variations in pulp temperature were shown to have a large effect on the 

amount of silver liberated.  Indications from the bench scale results in Figure 13-4 show 

that the process was best carried out at as high a temperature as practical to minimize 

lime consumption and achieve the highest gold and silver extraction rates.

FROM LIME BOIL PLANT OPERATION 

 

 
 
CARBON-IN-LEACH (CIL) 
Placer testwork conducted in 2003 established that destruction of the preg-robbing 

carbon in the black sedimentary ores during pressure oxidation was slow. Reduction in 

the organic carbon content through extended residence time, which also corresponds to 

higher sulphur oxidation, reduces the degree of preg-robbing thereby improving gold 

recovery. Unlike direct cyanidation (DCN), up to 0.50% organic carbon may be tolerated 

in the oxidized solids with CIL cyanide leaching before there is a noticeable drop in gold 

recovery. This effect is shown in the results from testwork undertaken on MO-BSD and 

MN-BSD ore types in Figure 13-5.

FIGURE 13-5   RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOLD RECOVERY AND 
ORGANIC CARBON CONTENT 

 

 
 

CIL pilot plant runs were undertaken by PVDC in June 2006 on three ore types to 

determine maximum precious metal loadings on carbon and gold and silver extractions.  

Average gold recoveries ranged from 90.5% (MO-BSD) to 95.2% (MN-SP) and silver 

recoveries, 84.4% (MO-BSD) to 89.9% (MO-VCL).  PVDC (2007) concludes that "the 

performance of the gold and silver loadings was considered above expectation for the 

three ore types" with total loadings of 12,000 g/t (gold plus silver) being achieved. 

 
COPPER RECOVERY 
Copper dissolution is very high under the expected operating conditions in the autoclave.  

The value used in the design criteria is 97.5%, but it will likely be higher than this, 

particularly after hot curing. 

 

Copper recovery from autoclave discharge solutions was tested using sulphide 

precipitation process.  Copper can be selectively precipitated as a copper sulphide (CuS) 

using hydrogen sulphide (H2S).  The H2S is produced from the action of bacteria under 

anaerobic conditions fed with elemental sulphur, ethanol, and nutrients.  The sulphide 

concentrates at a high grade can be sold to a third party smelter.

Initial preliminary batch testwork was carried out in May 2004, followed by a continuous 

pilot plant campaign in September 2004 and finally concluded by a Prefeasibility Study in 

November 2004.  Encouraging results and higher metal prices required a re-evaluation 

with pilot plant testwork by SGS Lakefield in September 2006.  

 

In summary, the pilot plant operated without problems and a consistently good 

concentrate grade was obtained.  After the losses from POX, CCD, and iron precipitation 

are taken into account, recovery was excellent at more than 99% for the precipitation 

stage and 88.05% overall.  Copper concentrates analyzed 58.5% Cu, 26.7% S, and 

0.26% Zn. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that the metallurgical testwork is adequate to support the Project 

and that the recovery models are reasonable. 

 
CYANIDE DESTRUCTION 
The CIL tailings slurry generated during the pilot plant campaign in June 2004 was sent 

to Inco Technology Services to evaluate the effectiveness and economics of cyanide 

destruction.  The conventional SO2/air cyanide destruction process was selected, but 

confirmatory testwork was required in 2006 with the incorporation of the lime boil into the 

process flow sheet.  This testwork was successful in reducing the residual WAD CN 

weak acid dissociable cyanide (WAD CN) to below 1.0 mg/L in the treated Pueblo Viejo 

Project tailings slurry. 

 
NEUTRALIZATION OF AUTOCLAVE ACIDIC LIQUORS 
Significant amounts of sulphuric acid and soluble metal sulphate salts are produced 

during POX.  The acidic liquor generated from the pilot plant operation in April 2004 was 

used to determine the most cost effective neutralization process.  

 

A continuous 7-day pilot plant test was subsequently performed to confirm the limestone 

and lime to sulphur ratios determined in batch testwork.  The high density sludge (HDS) 

neutralization process was used in the pilot plant.  The HDS process removes the 

contained base metals in a chemically stable form by co-precipitating them with ferric 

iron hydroxide in the presence of limestone or lime.

The pilot plant confirmed the effectiveness of limestone neutralization removing 92.5% of 

the sulphate, 99.9% of aluminum and copper, 100% of iron, and 86.8% of the zinc, with 

less than 1 mg/L of the metals left in solution.  The sulphate level in the clarifier overflow 

was 1,800 mg/L for removal of 94%.  Manganese removal was 89.8% at a final 

concentration of 1.6 mg/L. 

 
LIMESTONE GRINDING, CALCINING AND SLAKING TESTWORK 
Samples representing the limestone deposit were sent to the SGS Lakefield for Bond 

work and abrasion index measurements.  The result showed that the Bond WI of the 

limestone deposit ranged from 8.4 kWh/t to 10.1 kWh/t (average 9.5 kWh/t).  Most of the 

samples tested assayed better than 96% CaCO3. 

 

Six limestone samples were collected in 2004 and 2005 and sent to Maerz in 

Switzerland for calcining and slaking tests.  The results of the testwork showed that: 

  

• The CaO content of the kiln product ranged from 94% to 96%. 

• The burnt limestone had a high mechanical stability. 

• The burnt lime was highly reactive. 

 

Testing was also completed to evaluate grindability and abrasiveness of the limestone 

for use in the process calculations.

INTRODUCTION 
PVDC's Mineral Resource estimate of EOY2011 is reviewed in this report.  The 

resources were estimated by PVDC and Barrick Technical Services staff.   

 

Table 14-1 contains the Pueblo Viejo Mineral Resources exclusive of Mineral Reserves 

as of December 31, 2011.  These Mineral Resources could not be converted to Mineral 

Reserves due to operational constraints or economics (i.e., Measured and Indicated 

Mineral Resources) or an insufficient level of confidence (i.e., Inferred Mineral 

Resources).  The Qualified Person for this Mineral Resource estimate is Chester M. 

Moore, P.Eng.

It is understood that the EOY2011 Mineral Resources are based on the same block 

models as the EOY2010 Mineral Resources but have been adjusted for higher metal 

prices. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the underground EOY2011 Mineral Resource estimates are 

competently completed to industry standards using reasonable and appropriate 

parameters and are acceptable for reserve work.  The resource estimates conform to NI 

43-101.   

 

RESOURCE DATABASE AND VALIDATION 
RPA received header, survey, assay, lithology, and solids for the Monte Negro and 

Moore mineralized zones from PVDC.  There are 4,165 drill holes entered into the PVDC 

database for the entire property.  The resource database audited by RPA has 2,678 drill 

holes totalling 259,377 m.  RPA flagged holes intersecting the Monte Negro resource 

wireframes and referenced 557 drill holes totalling 86,428 m.  As well, RPA flagged 

holes intersecting the Moore resource wireframes and referenced 1,076 drill holes 

totalling 109,533 m.  The database contains 119,691 assay records for gold, silver, 

copper, zinc, and sulphur totalling 243,638 m of assays for an average interval length of 

2.04 m. 

 

All drill core, survey, geological, geochemical, and assay information used for the 

resource estimation was verified and approved by the TRJV geological staff and 

maintained as an Acquire database by an on-site database manager.  The data has 

been extensively used in the past five years and has been corrected for errors.  As well, 

low-confidence data has been removed from the resource database. 

 

RPA completed a variety of validation queries and routines in Gemcom to identify any 

remaining data entry errors.  The following is a list of some of the checks performed on 

the resource model by RPA: 

• Checked collar locations for zero/extreme values. 
 

• Checked assays in database for missing intervals, long intervals, extreme high 
values, blank/zero values, reasonable minimum/maximum values.

• Ran validity report to check for out of range values, missing interval, overlapping 
intervals, etc. 
 

• Checked for overlapping wireframes to determine possible double counting. 
 

• Checked mineralization/wireframe extensions beyond last holes to see if they are 
reasonable and consistent. 
 

• Compared basic statistics of assays within wireframes with basic statistics of 
composites within wireframes for both uncut and cut values. 
 

• Checked for capping of extreme values and effect of Coefficient of Variance 
(CV). 
 

• Checked for reasonable compositing intervals. 
 

• Checked that composite intervals start and stop at wireframe boundaries. 
 

• Checked that assigned composite rock type coding is consistent with intersected 
wireframe coding. 
 

• Checked search volume radii and orientations against available variography. 
 

• Checked interpolation parameters against available variography. 
 

• Visually checked block resource classification coding for isolated blocks. 
 

• Compared block statistics (zero grade cut-off) with assay/composite basic 
statistics. 
 

• Visually compared block grades to drill hole composite values on sections and/or 
plans. 
 

• Visually checked for grade banding, smearing of high grades, plumes of high 
grades, etc., on sections and/or plans. 

 

The database was found to be acceptable and no significant problems were noted.   

 

RPA also verified a number of data records with original assay certificates.  No 

significant discrepancies were identified. 

 

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND DOMAINS 
The geology of the deposits was reinterpreted by PVDC in 2009.  The work consisted of 

the following items: 

• Review of previous GENEL JV, Placer, and Barrick models 
• Reinterpretation and recoding of historic drill logs where core no longer exists

Rev. 0 Page 14-4 

• Relogging of all 395 Barrick drill holes with focus on lithology and structure 
• Simplification of geological units to facilitate interpretation 
• Sirovision imaging survey for structural data 
• Interpretation on plans and sections 
• Scanning of plans and sections and export to Vulcan for modelling 

 

The main results of the 2009 geological reinterpretation were the recognition of growth 

faults in a faulted sedimentary basin.  One new epiclastic volcanic unit was added to the 

revised stratigraphic column.  The new geological model uses brecciated feeders to 

explain the higher grade mineralization.  At depth, those feeder zones are steeply 

dipping and appear to be oriented similarly to the local structure, striking north-northwest 

for Monte Negro and almost due north for Moore.  Nearing the surface, the breccias 

seem to flatten.  In Moore, these flatter zones tend to follow lithology bedding, which dips 

west about 20°, while in Monte Negro, they seem to have a plunge of 10° to the south. 

 

Changes were made to the oxide and overburden domains as pit mapping recognized 

remnant bodies of oxide material.  However, the updated structural model was not 

significantly revised and, similarly, the updated geometallurgical, alteration, and litho-

structural models (Table 14-2) were essentially unchanged from the previous resource 

estimate.

Domaining for resource estimation is based on major geological areas, lithology, 

alteration, oxidation boundary, and a grade indicator to define broad grade shells. The 

three main geological areas are Monte Negro, Moore, and Cumba (Figure 14-1) named 

1, 2, and 3 for modelling purposes.  The four alteration zones are: 

1. Quartz, alunite, dickite (main mineralized zone) – referred to as Qz 
2. Quartz, pyrite, dickite (main mineralized zone) – referred to as Qz 
3. Chlorite, illite, smectite 
4. Pyrophyllite, illite, kaolinite (argillic alteration) 

 

The boundary between the oxide and sulphide is well defined.  It was assumed that all 

oxide material had been mined by Rosario but relogging and pit mapping identified minor 

remnant oxide and transitional material.  The three main lithology domains are: 

• Lithology 32 = PDTQ 
• Lithology 80 = IA 
• Lithology 100 = Cover 

 

The principal controls for interpolation of grades are the alteration domains and the use 

of two probability indicators.  The first indicator serves to isolate the higher grade 

population associated with the hydrothermal breccias or feeders.  The second indicator 

is used to define the mineralized envelope and separate areas of low grade from areas 

of high grade as observed in the cumulative frequency curves.

RPA imported the mineralized models and reviewed them with respect to drilling.  RPA 

notes that the mineral domain envelopes appear generally reasonable. 

 

DATA ANALYSIS 
In order to understand and establish gold grade characteristics in the Project area, an 

exploratory data analysis was conducted.  Data within the individual alteration domains 

and main lithological domains were analyzed.  Histograms and box plots of composite 

uncapped gold, silver, copper, and sulphur assays were generated using a standard 

Barrick in-house package. 

 

Basic statistics for the assays are given in Table 14-3.  The table shows that the Qz zone 

contains most of the metal and has relatively high CVs for gold, copper, and silver.  The 

sulphur CV is low.

RPA notes that statistical analysis for the raw assays is done to industry standard. 

 

GRADE CAPPING 
The assay database was statistically examined for the presence of local high grade 

outliers which could potentially affect the accuracy of the resource estimate.  Once these 

outliers were identified, criteria used to determine capping grades include the cumulative 

distribution function, the uncapped CV, and the percentage of metal loss at various caps.  

Capping grade is primarily determined by a sudden deviation of the cumulative 

distribution curve. The percent metal loss is determined at this grade.  The alteration 

domains were examined individually for each metal individually and the final decision on 

the cap value was made by the resource modeller.  The cap values for gold, silver, 

copper, and sulphur are shown in Table 14-5.

RPA concurs with the capping levels chosen by PVDC and notes that the CVs for the Qz 

mineralization are generally within the acceptable range. 

 

Resource estimates were run for the Monte Negro and Moore deposits using uncut 

assay values for comparison with the cut assay results.  The uncut resource contained 

approximately 14,922,950, or 2.3%, more ounces of gold in the Monte Negro deposit 

and 17,651,200, or 1.4%, more ounces of gold in the Moore deposit. 

 

COMPOSITING 
The average length of samples within the mineralized domains is 1.98 m.  A 10 m 

composite length was used by PVDC in the current estimations.  This coincides with a 

planned bench height of 10 m and is comparable to composite lengths used in previous 

estimates.  Composite assay intervals were flagged by domain for further statistical 

analyses and to allow for composite selection during estimation. 

 

RPA notes that composites less than 10 m are not omitted from statistical analysis and 

are used for grade interpolation as well.  General industry practice omits short 

composites from interpolation.  RPA reviewed the omission of composites less than 

three metres in length for the potential for grade bias.  No significant effects were 

observed. 

 

VARIOGRAPHY 
A complete variographic analysis was carried out on 10 m composite data.  Three-

dimensional relative-by-pair variograms were generated using Vulcan's 'Variography 

Utility' to look for the major axis of preferential directions of continuity. 

 

Correlograms (omni & multi-directional) are established using the 10m capped 

composite file.  Search orientations are selected from the multi-directional correlograms, 

but are checked against the geological interpretation to ensure proper matching.  Moore 

tends to behave more isotropically than Monte Negro and so search orientations for 

Moore are determined primarily from geology.  Search distances are determined from 

omni-directional correlogram using 0.8% and 0.9% of the total sill variance (Figure 14-3).

BULK DENSITY 
The main bulk densities are listed in Table 14-6.  AMAX Engineering and Mining 

Services (AMAX) derived a linear regression formula (density = (0.0322 * sulphur %) + 

2.617) for density based on 152 pairs of density and sulphur samples from diamond drill 

holes drilled in 1985.  AMEC (2005) compiled all of the newer density data from Rosario 

and the GENEL JV and confirmed the above equation.  This regression curve was used 

to assign density values to every block in the resource model.

Further studies were undertaken to review this formula in 2008.  As a result, it was 

changed to (0.0237 * S%) + 2.675.  However, the effect on bulk densities for the major 

mineralized units was insignificant, but the variability in values was reduced. 

 

RPA's opinion is that the AMAX sulphur-based density regression equation is 

reasonable and acceptable for estimating tonnage factors. 

 

CUT-OFF GRADE 
Mineral Resources are reported at a break-even cut-off grade (COG) that equates to 

between 1.3 g/t Au and 1.4 g/t Au.  There was no distinction made between the Monte 

Negro and Moore deposits in the COG estimation.  The key assumptions used for the 

COG were based on an average direct operating cost at $51.47 per tonne processed, 

gold recoveries varying between 83% and 90% depending on ore type, and a gold price 

of $1,400/oz, a silver price of $28.00/oz, and a copper price of $3.25/lb. 

 

BLOCK MODEL 
A single block model is defined, encompassing both the Moore and the Monte Negro 

areas.  Blocks size is set at 10 m by 10 m by 10 m, no sub-celling is employed and the 

model is not rotated.  Table 14-7 shows the block model geometry.

The only solids used to define geology were the interpolated, intrusive andesitic dykes.  

Although the dyke geometry is inaccurate due to extrapolating centreline dyke shapes 

halfway to the next section, the dykes were volumetrically accounted for and allowed to 

dilute the overall block grades.  These andesitic dykes are often quite narrow.  Flagging 

the centroid of 10 m blocks would leave the dyke mass under-represented.  A one metre 

block model was therefore created using the site defined shapes. This model was then 

regularized into a 10 m model, resulting in each block containing a percentage of dyke 

material.  This dyke percentage was transferred to the main 10 m model. 

 

USE OF INDICATORS FOR GRADE SHELLS 
Indicator values and threshold limits to outline broad gold grade shells are determined 

from the same curves used to determine capping levels.  A 0.2 g/t Au low grade indicator 

and 3.5 g/t Au high grade indicator were selected to define two populations as observed 

in the exploratory data analysis. 

 

GRADE INTERPOLATION 
Three major estimation domains were defined for gold estimate: Moore, Monte Negro, 

and a low grade structural zone south of Monte Negro.  Preferential directions of 

continuity were defined for Moore and Monte Negro. 

 

A set of two discriminators, or probability indicators, was generated.  The first indicator 

serves to isolate the higher grade population interpreted to be associated to the 

hydrothermal breccias or feeders.  The second indicator is used to separate the two 

populations observed on the cumulative frequency curves.

Rev. 0 Page 14-16 

Interpolation of grades is processed in two passes, one pass for exploration data only 

and the second pass for exploration plus RC grade control data (RC data is constrained 

to a production solid 'PV10m_rc_area_1.00t').  Each of these runs is subject to several 

passes based on different search criteria. 

 

The first pass (locally named the "box search") is on a very restricted 5 m x 5 m x 5 m, to 

determine Measured Resource blocks.  The second pass is based on 80% of the 

variogram sill, 75 m x 75 m x 50 m.  A third pass uses 50% of these search distances 

and the final pass is based on 90% of the variogram sill, 140 m x 140 m x 70 m. 

 

Gold grades are estimated using inverse distance weighting cubed (ID3).  Sulphur and 

silver grades are estimated using alteration domains in the same way as gold, while 

copper is estimated using both ID and ordinary kriging (OK). 

 

HIGH GRADE INDICATOR 
Site geologists defined a series of hydrothermal breccias that are steeply dipping at 

depth and tend to flatten out and follow bedding near the surface.  In the absence of 3-D 

solids, a probability indicator at a gold cut-off grade of 3.5 g/t Au was generated to 

simulate the breccias.  All 10 m composites were assigned either 1, 0, or -9, depending 

on the composite gold value being greater than or equal to 3.5 g/t, less than 3.5 g/t, or 

not available, respectively.  The 0 and 1 indicators were then estimated by domains, 

using ID2 interpolation.  A minimum of four composites, maximum of 13, and maximum 

of two composites per hole were required for an estimate to be made.  This condition 

ensures that at least two holes were within the search range for a block to be estimated.  

Only composites within the same domain as the block being estimated were considered. 

The estimation parameters for Moore and Monte Negro are shown in Table 14-8. 

 

LOW GRADE INDICATOR 
A second probability indicator is generated at a 0.2 g/t Au cut-off grade to define a 

mineralized envelope and separate areas of low grade from areas of high grade.  

Statistical analysis and sectional interpretation of gold grades show 0.2 g/t Au to be a 

logical cut-off value.  Attempting to hand-contour grade at a higher cut-off grade would 

generate too many isolated pods that would be difficult to link between sections.

Rev. 0 Page 14-17 

The same technique, search criteria, and ellipsoid definition are used as for the high 

grade indicators.  All composites are flagged with 1, 0, or -9, depending on whether the 

10 composites are greater than or equal to 0.2 g/t Su, less than 0.2 g/t Au, or not 

sampled, respectively.  The new indicators are estimated and, using a 30% break on the 

estimate result, two populations are defined separating areas of higher and lower 

mineralization.  The resulting values are written to a separate field to differentiate them 

from the previous, high grade indicator.

GOLD ESTIMATION FOR BLOCKS THAT CONTAIN COMPOSITES 
A first gold value estimate is done for all blocks containing at least one 10 m composite.  

This estimate pass uses ID2 of all composites within that block.  The search is therefore 

defined as a box search, covering the entire block.  Table 14-9 shows the search and 

sample selection parameters gold grade estimates.

HIGH GRADE GOLD ESTIMATE 
The resulting probabilities of a block to be greater than or equal to 3.5 g/t Au are back-

flagged to each 10 m composite and serve as selection criteria for the estimate of gold 

grade.  Only blocks with a 10% or greater chance of being greater than or equal to 3.5 

g/t Au are estimated, using matching composites.  Note that a composite could be lower 

than 3.5 g/t Au but be surrounded by higher grade composites. In this instance, the 

lower grade composite would be considered if the block that it fell in had a probability of 

10% or greater.  Again, estimates are run separately for Moore and Monte Negro 

domains and only composites in similar domains as the block being estimated are 

considered.  A series of two passes are used for the estimate, with increasing search 

distances and varying numbers of composites. 

 

LOW GRADE GOLD ESTIMATE 
As previously, composites are back-flagged with the resulting probabilities of the blocks 

being greater than or equal to 0.2 g/t Au.  Blocks that were not previously estimated for 

gold grade and have a 30% or greater chance of being above 0.2 g/t Au are estimated 

with similarly flagged composites.  A three pass estimate scheme is used, with 

increasing distances and varying numbers of composites. 

 

GOLD ESTIMATE WITHIN MID-GRADE AREA 
In order to reflect the soft contact between lower grade disseminated and higher vein 

related mineralization, a mid-grade estimation pass is used. This population is 

interpreted between 0.2 g/t Au and 3.5 g/t Au.  The same technique, search criteria, and 

ellipsoid definition are used as for the high grade and low grade indicators.  However, 

samples are selected using probability thresholds determined from the low and high 

grade indicators.  Composites with a low grade probability of greater than 30% and a 

high grade probability of less than 90% are selected in order to interpolate mid grade 

mineralization. A three pass estimate scheme is used, with increasing distances and 

varying numbers of composites.

GOLD ESTIMATE IN WASTE AREAS 
Similarly, all blocks not previously estimated for gold, and with less than 30% chance of 

being greater than 0.2 g/t Au, are also estimated using a three pass scheme.  

Composites are capped at 6.0 g/t Au during the estimate. 

 

COPPER ESTIMATION 
Copper grades estimation parameters were set by oxidation level, alteration, and 

lithology. OK was carried out in the alteration domains and ID2 in the lithology domains.  

A similar multi-pass approach with increasing distances was used for copper grade 

interpolation. 

 

RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
The resource model was classified using a combination of estimation pass number, 

number of composites used to assign the block grade, and the distance to nearest 

composite.  Ranges for Indicated and Inferred Resources are derived from the gold 

omni-directional correlogram, with 80% of the sill defining Indicated Resources and 90% 

of the sill defining Inferred Resources (Figure 14-3).  The area which is estimated by the 

grade control RC holes is reported as Measured Resources.  Otherwise, a block can be 

classified as Measured only if it is intersected by an assayed drill hole.  A block was 

considered Indicated if it had two composites within 75 m, or at least one composite 

within 45 m.  In order to classify a block as Inferred, two composites had to be located 

within 75 m to 140 m of the block. 

 

A post-processing, manual smoothing of the resource categories was applied to the 

model.  The smoothing used the following rules: 

• If a Measured block is surrounded by Inferred blocks, it is downgraded to 
Indicated. 

• If an Indicated block is surrounded by Inferred blocks, it is downgraded to 
Inferred.  

• If the number of neighbouring Indicated blocks is less than four, the block is 
downgraded to Inferred. 

• If an Inferred block is surrounded by Indicated blocks, it is upgraded to Indicated.

Rev. 0 Page 14-21 

Figures 14-4 and 14-5 illustrate the distribution of grade and resources classification at 

the Monte Negro and Moore deposits. 

 

In RPA's opinion, grade continuity does not allow single blocks to be classified as 

Measured, even at five metre distances from a drill hole composite value.  It is 

recommended that the Measured classification is defined by 40% to 50% of the sill and 

requires at least one composite from two drill holes. 

 

BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 
PVDC visually validates the block model gold grades against drill holes and composites 

in section and plan view.  Grades are also compared against the nearest neighbour 

(composite) gold grades and a histogram of the original composite distribution is 

compared to the block gold grade estimate (Figure 14-6). 

 

RPA completed ID2 estimates for each block model.  The results are compared with the 

PVDC estimates in Table 14-10.  It is RPA's opinion that the estimates show acceptable 

agreement considering the different methodologies used.

MINERAL RESOURCE SUMMARY 
The Mineral Resources are in addition to the Mineral Reserves and could not be 

converted to Mineral Reserves due to operational constraints (e.g. Measured and 

Indicated Mineral Resources) or an insufficient level of confidence (e.g. Inferred Mineral 

Resources).  The Mineral Resources and are based on a Whittle pit shell based on 

$1,100/oz gold, $16.50/oz silver, and $2.50/lb copper and Measured, Indicated, and 

Inferred resources are included in the pit shell. 

 

The Mineral Resources at Pueblo Viejo are listed in Table 14-11.

MINERAL RESOURCE RECONCILIATION 
PVDC completed a large RC drill program at the Monte Negro and Moore deposits in 

areas planned for initial mining.  This Grade Control (GC) drilling was done at a 10 mE 

by 15 mN spacing in high grade areas (3.0 g/t Au cut-off grade) and 15 mE by 12.5 mN 

in lower grade areas (1.4 g/t Au cut-off grade).  Two metre samples were collected using 

a rotating cone splitter, prepared on site, and sent to ACME labs in Chile and ALS in 

Peru for assaying. 

 

The GC models for parts of Monte Negro North (2.4 Mm3) and Moore deposits (2.9 Mm3) 

were prepared using Hellman and Schofield MP3 conditional simulation software.  The 

GC model delineated 112% of the total tonnage and 97% of the gold grade for 109% of 

the total ounces of gold.  In general, the GC model tends to predict more tonnes in the 

1.5 g/t Au to 4.5 g/t Au range compared with the resource model. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the block model validation is reasonable and adequate. 

 

CONCLUSIONS 
In RPA's opinion, the Mineral Resource estimates are competently conducted using 

reasonable and appropriate parameters.  The data collection system (i.e., the sample 

data) is well configured and maintained.  Estimation procedures are very well organized 

and documented.  All personnel interviewed during the audit appeared to be comfortable 

and confident with their roles in the process. 

 

It is understood that the EOY2011 Mineral Resources are based on the same block 

models as the EOY2010 Mineral Resources but have been adjusted for higher metal 

prices. 

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect the open pit 

mineral resource estimates.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
MINERAL RESERVE STATEMENT 
The Mineral Resource estimates discussed in Section 14 were prepared using standard 

industry methods and provide an acceptable basis for estimation of Mineral Reserves.  

RPA reviewed the reported Mineral Reserves, production schedules, and cash flow 

analysis to determine if the Mineral Reserves met the CIM Definition Standards for 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  Based on this review, it is RPA's opinion that 

the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource within the final pit design at Pueblo Viejo 

can be classified as Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves.  The Qualified Person for 

this Mineral Reserve estimate is Robbert Borst, C.Eng. 

 

Mineral Reserves for the Project, contained in the two adjacent Moore and Monte Negro 

pits, are listed in Table 15-1.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Reserves. 
2. No cut-off grade is applied. Instead the profit of each block in the Mineral Resource is calculated 

and included in the reserve if the value is positive. 
3. Mineral Reserves are estimated using an average long-term gold price of US$1,200 per ounce. 
4. Totals may not add due to rounding. 

 

CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA AND RANKING INDEX 
To estimate the Mineral Reserves and to develop the associated mining schedule, the 

profit, or value, for each block in the Mineral Resource model was calculated.  The profit 

takes into account metal grade, sulphur content, time required for processing, 

processing plant recoveries, and costs in determining the value of a given block. 
 

Profit = Revenue – Costs, in $/t. 
 
Unit Revenue = [Gold grade (oz/t) x Gold Rec. (%) x Gold price ($/oz) x (1 – 0.032) x 
Payable Metal – Gold TC&RC($/t)] + [Silver grade (oz/t) x Silver Rec. (%) x Silver price 
($/oz) x (1 – 0.032) x Payable Metal – Silver TC&RC($/t] + [Cu grade (lb/t) x Cu Rec. (%) x 
Copper price ($/lb) x (1 – 0.032) x Payable Metal – Copper TC&RC($/t)] 

 

It should be noted that the cost for each block considers all operating and sustaining 

costs – mining, processing, general and administrative (G&A) - plus the incremental 

sustaining capital associated with the El Llagal and La Piñita tailings storage facilities.  

Accordingly, any block showing a Profit higher than zero, is a block of ore, i.e., eligible to 

be fed to the plant. 

 
To further optimize the block value, a Ranking Index is applied to each block of the 

Mineral Resource model.  This allows blocks with better gold, silver, and copper grades, 

and lower sulphur grades, to be selected for earlier mining and processing (higher 

sulphur means longer processing time and reduced daily plant capacity). 

 
The following is used to calculate the treatment rate in tonnes per hour: 

• Treatment rate = 1,000 t/hr, for S ≤ 6.79% 

• Treatment rate = (67.9/S%) t/hr, for S > 6.79%

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 15-3 

The Ranking Index is then calculated by multiplying the profit (per tonne) by the 

treatment rate (tonnes per hour) for each block: 

 
Ranking Index = (Profit/tonne) x (tonnes/hr) = Profit/hr 

 

Measured and Indicated Resource blocks are treated as potential mill feed, while 

Inferred Resource and unclassified blocks are treated as waste and assigned a zero 

value in the Ranking Index.

16 MINING METHODS 
SUMMARY 
The Pueblo Viejo property was the site of gold mining operations under the ownership of 

Rosario until March 2002.  The operations of Rosario were based on exploitation of the 

oxide zone in two principal mineralized areas, Monte Negro and Moore.  Mining in the 

Moore deposit stopped early in the 1990s owing to ore hardness and high copper 

content, which resulted in high cyanide consumption.  In the Monte Negro deposit, 

mining ceased in 1998 and stockpile mining continued until July 1999, when the 

operation was shut down.  In 24 years of production, the Pueblo Viejo Mine produced a 

total of 5.5 M oz of gold and 25.2 M oz of silver. 

 

Suspension of the operations of Rosario was directly related to exhaustion of oxide zone 

resources and the need to develop suitable technology for commercial exploitation of the 

underlying sulphide mineralization. 

 

During 2000, the Dominican Republic invited international bids for the leasing and 

mineral exploitation of the Pueblo Viejo sulphide deposits.  Placer won the bid and 

negotiated a Special Lease Agreement (SLA) for the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve.  The 

SLA became effective on July 29, 2003. 

 

In February 2006, Barrick acquired control of Placer Dome Inc. (Placer) and in 

December 2007 prepared a feasibility study of the Project (the FSU).  Mine development 

began in August 2010.  Current mine activity is in the Monte Negro 1 and Moore 1 

phases.  Mining is by conventional truck and shovel method.   

 

The EOY2011 Mineral Reserves as reported in Table 15-1 are the basis for this 

Technical Report.  Whittle analysis has been used for pit optimization.  Compared to 

EOY2010 Mineral Reserves, contained gold increased from 23.7 Moz to 25.3 Moz, 

contained silver increased from 147.3 Moz to 160.2 Moz, and contained copper 

increased from 532.1 Mlb to 590.5 Mlb.  Gold reserves increased by 2.5 Moz as a result 

of an increase in the price of gold from US$975 to US$1200/oz and new pit slope 

angles. Grade control drilling completed in 2010 in addition to higher fuel costs and 

limestone mining cost reduced reserves by 0.8 Moz.  Ore tonnes increased from 254.6

to 285.3 Mt, and the total pit size is now 619.8 Mt.  Pit sizes remain constrained by 

tailings dam capacity.   

 

Until first ore is processed, all run-of-mine (ROM) ore is stockpiled in three locations, for 

high grade, medium grade, and low grade material.  By the start of plant operation in 

July 2012, the total ore on stockpile is scheduled to be 21 Mt.  Total ore on stockpiles will 

reach a maximum of approximately 152 Mt in 2029. 

 

The initial pre-stripping requirement is very low as previous mining has left ore 

outcropping on surface.  The waste to ore ratio increases by 21%, between pit 

optimization and the final pit design.  This indicates that the final pit design is sub-optimal 

and there is scope to further optimize the pit design and improve the economics of the 

Project.  

 

The pit stages have been chosen to facilitate the early extraction of the higher grade ore.  

Elevated initial cut-off grades have been used for this purpose.  Notwithstanding, the 

driver of the mine schedule will be the sulphur blending requirement.  This variable is as 

important as the gold grade, because the metallurgical aspects of the processing 

operation, the recoveries achieved, and the processing costs, all strongly depend on a 

very stable, low-variability sulphur content in the plant feed. 

 

All waste rock from the Moore and Monte Negro pits will be hauled to the El Llagal 

tailings area, with potential acid generating waste being submerged in the tailings facility. 

An eight kilometre haul road has been constructed to link the pit area to the TSF.  

 

The processing method requires a significant amount of limestone slurry and lime 

derived from high quality limestone.  Limestone quarries, located approximately two 

kilometres from the Project, have been in production since 2009.   

 

Processing higher grade ore in the early years, while stockpiling lower grade ore for later 

processing, results in a mine life of 18 years and a processing life of 36 years.  In years 

2012 to 2029, total material movement, including limestone, averages approximately 43 

Mtpa, and about 66% of ROM ore is stockpiled for later processing.

The following sections are based on Barrick (2012) and AMC (2011). 

 

OPEN PIT OPTIMIZATION 
The Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm contained in the Whittle software package has been 

used for pit optimization and sensitivity analysis, with a set of nested pit shell surfaces 

being generated by varying the Revenue Factor (RF).  Results presented in the following 

sections correspond to the latest work done by PVDC in December 2011 (Barrick, 2012). 

 
The December 2011 topographic surface of the site was used in the analysis. Pit shell 

generation was unconstrained by infrastructure as all major facilities will be outside the 

ultimate pit design and area of influence. 

 
It should be noted that most of the parameter values have been tested in preceding 

runs. The operating costs used, particularly, have been taken from existing LOM Plan 

versions and correspond to an operation designed for processing 24,000 tpd and mining 

approximately 100,000 tpd ROM total material (excluding rehandle). 

 

RESOURCE MODEL 
The Mineral Resource block model used was the "PV10m_0611", released for long term 

planning purposes in June 2011. Original blocks of 10 m x 10 m x 10 m were used (no 

reblocking was done). 

 
Grades relevant to the economic value calculation for each block are gold, silver, copper, 

and sulphur. Zinc does not contribute to block value as this metal is not recovered into a 

saleable product in the current Project. 

 
Only Measured and Indicated Resources have been used for revenue estimation in the 

pit optimization and mine design work.  Inferred Resources within the mine design have 

been considered as waste and have only been reported to indicate possible 

opportunities for additional mining inventories.

GEOTECHNICAL INPUT - SLOPE ANGLES 
Geotechnical domains and recommended inter-ramp pit slope angles were originally 

designed by Piteau Associates Engineering Ltd. in 2005. 

 

In March 2011, SRK Consulting presented a simplified slope set to use for final pit 

optimization. It is based on four main lithological groups: Sediments, Pyroclastics, Lavas 

and Mudstone Carbonaceous Sediments (SKM). Recommended maximum inter-ramp 

slope angles are a function of the mean dip direction of the pit wall, as described under 

Mine Design Factors. 

 

ECONOMIC INPUTS 
Commodity prices used for pit optimization runs upon which the Mineral Resource and 

Mineral Reserve estimates are based are summarized in Table 16-1.

METALLURGICAL INPUTS 
Metallurgical recoveries for gold, silver, and copper were defined for each ore type, 

using the variable "mettype" stored in the Mineral Resource block model.  See Section 

13 for a discussion of the metallurgical ore types and corresponding recoveries. 

 
OPTIMIZATION RESULTS 
Table 16-4 lists the global rock tonnages for the series of nested pit shells obtained in 

optimization runs.  Constrained by the total tailings capacity, pit #19 was selected for the 

EOY2011 Reserves.  This shell is sub-optimal in terms of Net Present Value (NPV) 

because of this constraint.

SENSITIVITY OF PIT LIMITS TO GOLD PRICE AND COSTS 
The sensitivity of the pit limits to gold price was examined.  Gold prices used were 

US$1,000/oz, US$1,200/oz, and US$1,400/oz, while silver and copper prices were 

maintained constant and no TSF capacity constraint was applied.  Results of the

The impacts of varying mining costs, process costs, and gold price from -20% to +20% 

on the gold content in the pit are expressed in the spider diagram presented in Figure 

16-1. The base case is the Whittle pit shell at RF=1.  An increase of 20% in process 

costs would result in a decrease of 0.3 Moz contained gold, while a decrease of 20% in 

process costs leads to an increase of 0.2 Moz contained gold.  Reserves are more 

sensitive to a reduction in gold price, dropping 2.9 Moz when the price decreases 20% 

and gaining only 1.7 Moz when the price increases by 20%.

FINAL (ULTIMATE PIT) SELECTION AND DESIGN 
Currently, the capacity of the TSF available for the Project (519 Mm3) is lower than the 

total ore contained in t h e  RF=1 optimum pit shell.  Accordingly, pit shell selection is 

driven by the TSF capacity.  In general, one tonne of ore will produce approximately 

1.5 t of mixed tailings - CIL and HDS precipitate (see Section 13).  Based on a settled 

dry density study done by BGC, these tailings will have an overall LOM average dry 

density of 1.2 t/m3. For the current assessment, the waste dumps generally do not 

advance over tailings and a uniform density of 2.1 t/m3 has been assumed for the waste 

rock. Therefore, the tailings plus waste storage capacity required for a given amount of 

ore and waste is defined by: 

 
Volume of Tailings plus Waste Storage (m3) = Ore tonnes *(1.5/1.2) + Waste tonnes / 2.1 

 

This relationship is used to calculate the required capacity indicated in column "vol 

tailings req" in Table 16-4.  Given the storage capacity of 519 Mm3 that is currently 

available, the maximum pit size is limited to pit shell 19, which requires approximately 

510 Mm3 of storage capacity for its tailings plus waste. 

 

The current final pit design is based on pit shell 19.  Design parameters used are as 

follows:  

 

• Bench height is 10 m for Monte Negro and Moore pits. No double or triple-
benching except in reduced and limited sectors. 
 

• Main roads are designed with 30 m width and 8% gradient, except on the bottom 
three benches which are 25 m width at 10% gradient. 
 

• Berm widths and bench face angles are read directly from the block model.  They 
are based on four main lithological groups and the wall orientation.  Bench face 
angles (BFA) are set to a maximum of 75o and inter-ramp angles (IRA) vary 
between 46o and 52o for sediments, pyroclastic rocks and lavas, resulting in a 
catch bench width ranging from 10.3 m to 13.3 m.  For mudstone carbonaceous 
sediments (SKM), a 65o BFA and 35o IRA is recommended, with 9.6 m berm 
width. Recommendations were made by SRK Consulting (SRK) to PVDC in 
March 2011. 

 

The resulting final pit design is shown in Figure 16-2. The comparison of this design 

with respect to pit shell 19 is presented in Table 16-6.

The waste to ore ratio (strip ratio) for pit shell 19 is 0.98:1.  The strip ratio increases to 

1.17:1, i.e., by 19% in the final pit design.  This indicates to RPA that the final pit design 

is sub-optimal in relation to the pit optimization.  There may be scope to further optimize 

the pit design and improve the economics of the Project. 

 

MINE DESIGN FACTORS 

ORE PROCESSING RATE – SULPHUR DEPENDENCY 
The ore processing rate and the nominal plant capacity for the Project is set at 24,000 

tpd. The capacity of the processing plant is limited by the rate at which the four 

autoclaves can process sulphur, which is constrained by oxygen availability. A "cap" 

of 407 tpd of sulphur per autoclave has been stipulated for ore delivery to the mill. At 

6.79% sulphur, this equates to 24,000 t of ore containing 1,630 t of sulphur being 

processed per day. This figure is matched, with plant availability taken into 

consideration, to the design capacity of the crushing-grinding circuit and the processing 

plant as a whole. Figure 16-3 illustrates the daily throughput as a function of sulphur 

content. The ultimate capacity of each autoclave is somewhat above 407 tpd but, for 

control of mill feed purposes, that has been deemed to be the maximum.

Rev. 0 Page 16-12 

FIGURE 16-3   PLANT DAILY ORE TREATMENT CAPACITY AS FUNCTION 
OF S CONTENT 

 

 
 

Figure 16-3 clearly shows the importance of maintaining the sulphur content of the ore to 

be processed at or below 6.79%. Based on the Mineral Resource block model, the 

average sulphur content of the resource is approximately 6.0% (AMC, 2011), while the 

EOY2011 reserves within the Whittle pit design have an average sulphur grade of 7.7%. 

This indicates that for a significant period during the LOM, the plant will have to handle 

more than the desired 6.79%, reducing the ore tonnage throughput to maintain desired 

maximum daily sulphur mass.  The current strategy depends in part on an expected 

sulphur decay when the ore is exposed to the environment while on ROM stockpiles. 

That expected decay rate is defined as: 

 
Decayed Sulphur Grade (%) = (1 – 0.0118) ^N, Where N is the number of years the rock has 
been exposed. 

 

Figure 16-4 shows this relationship.  For example, it is expected that after about 19 

years of environmental exposure, the sulphur grade of the stockpiled ore will have 

reduced by approximately 20%.  The decay relationship was applied by PVDC to the in-

situ sulphur grades, assigning N as the time scheduled to have elapsed between 

stockpiling and reclaiming the ore.

FIGURE 16-4   SULPHUR GRADE DECAY MODEL FOR ORE IN STOCKPILES 
 

 
 

In RPA's opinion there is a risk of not achieving the planned throughput of 24,000 tpd in 

some years during the LOM considering that the average sulphur grade of the reserves 

in the final pit design exceeds 6.79% and the expected sulphur content decay could be 

slower than calculated.  In the worst case scenario, the processing rate could drop to 

22,000 tpd. 

 

METALLURGICAL RECOVERY 
The ore has been divided into five metallurgical domains by PVDC (see Section 13 of 

this report) with gold recovery equations based on the results of metallurgical testwork. 

The weight average recovery of each metallurgical ore type will be used to predict 

the average metallurgical recovery of the stockpiles. The block Rating Index (profit per 

hour) is mostly affected by gold grade and sulphur grades, and these two parameters 

are the main drivers of the stockpiling strategy. 

 

SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS AND DESIGN - GEOTECHNICAL 
PARAMETERS 
SRK was retained to provide geotechnical slope design and blasting criteria for the 

Project and in March 2011 presented a simplified set of slopes to be used in final pit 

optimization.

Rev. 0 Page 16-14 

The SRK pit slope design considered the pit layout based on Placer's 2004 geologic 

model. The size of the open pit has subsequently increased and additional geological 

and groundwater information has been obtained. For SRK's design, information was 

gathered from an investigation program that included geotechnical drilling and mapping, 

documentation of existing slopes, geomechanical core logging, field point load index 

testing, and sampling for laboratory rock mechanics testing (direct shear and uniaxial 

compressive strength).  Field data included structural information, rock mass quality and 

estimated blast damage. 

 

As described earlier in this section, the SRK set of slopes is based on four main 

lithological groups: sediments, pyroclastic rocks, lavas, and SKM.  Recommended 

maximum inter-ramp slope angles are function of the mean dip direction (DDR) of the pit 

wall, as detailed in Table 16-7.

Bench face angles were set to a maximum of 75o to ensure that sufficient catch bench 

widths were retained until blasting and excavation techniques could be verified. With the 

recommended IRAs, this will result in catch bench widths ranging between 10.3 m and 

13.3 m, which still exceed the minimum width recommended for a 20 m bench height. 

 

For the SKM, it was assumed that dewatering was in place and an IRA of 35o, a BFA of 

65o, single 10 m benches, and 9.6 m berm width were recommended. 

 

New slope angles recommended by SRK resulted in a pit with less stripping, which 

added 0.312 Moz to reserves. 

 

It is noted that any depressurization work may be time consuming and potentially 

disruptive to the mining schedule; however, there appears to be sufficient flexibility in the 

mining plan for this not to be a major issue. 

 

Inter-ramp slope angles of 38o to 50o degrees are deemed reasonable for the rock types 

to be encountered. 
 

MINE PRODUCTION AND TOTAL MATERIALS HANDLING 
SCHEDULE 

MINE PHASE (PUSHBACK) DESIGN PARAMETERS AND SEQUENCING 
Design Parameters: The final pit and intermediate phase designs consider the 
following parameters: 
 

• Bench height:                        10 m 

• Minimum phase floor width:   70 m (at working bench)

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 16-16 

• Road width:                            30 m 

• Maximum road gradient: 8% in-pit and 10% out of the pit. 
 

A simplification of the 2007 feasibility study matrix of inter-ramp angle IRA, BFA, 

and bench height has been used for the pit.  The slope design recommendations that 

have been developed more recently by SRK have not yet been applied. 

 

Minimum operational width has been established at 70 m.  All of the pushbacks exceed 

the minimum width, except for Moore Phase 0, which is close to the minimum. 

 

Pit internal and external roads were designed at 30 m width, adequate for medium-size 

trucks.  In general, ramp slopes were designed at 8%, except for the last three benches 

of each phase where the maximum ramp slope is 10%. 

 

Sequencing Method: Whittle nested pit shells were used as a guide to define mining 
sequence, considering minimum pushback width and economic contribution. The 

sequence follows the Ranking Index (higher value means higher priority), except 

where this is not possible for geometry reasons. 

 

SULPHUR BLENDING AND ORE STOCKPILING 
The pit stages have been chosen to facilitate the early extraction of the most profitable 

ore.  Elevated initial cut-off grades have been used for this purpose.  Notwithstanding, 

the driver of the mine schedule will be the sulphur blending requirement.  This variable is 

as important as the gold grade, because the metallurgical aspects of the processing 

operation, the recoveries achieved, and the processing costs, all strongly depend on a 

very stable, low-variability sulphur content in the plant feed.  As shown in Figure 16-3, a 

decline in process plant capacity can be expected as soon as sulphur content 

exceeds 6.79%. Such a capacity reduction is acceptable for short periods of time; 

however, sulphur content must not be allowed to exceed 10% as the heat generated 

by the sulphides oxidation reaction can produce severe damage in autoclaves. 

Conversely, at all times, a minimum sulphur content of 5.3% is required to sustain the 

auto-fuelled oxidation reaction of sulphides. Accordingly, throughout the pit life, the 

mining schedule combines a plant feed stream continuously composed of a blend of ore 

coming directly from benches with ore reclaimed from stockpiles, aimed to maintain an

average of 6.79% sulphur with as little variation as possible. This mining requirement 

implies: 

• On average, the ROM ore will go partly to the primary crusher and partly to 
stockpiles. 
 

• On average, the plant feed will be composed of ROM ore and reclaimed ore 
from older stockpiles. 
 

• The total ore stored in stockpiles will, on average, increase year by year, 
reaching a peak of 152 Mt by 2029. 

 

BASIC CRITERIA FOR MINE/STOCKPILE SCHEDULING 
Ore mined is taken to the low, medium, and high grade stockpile locations shown in 

Figure 16-5. Volumes and tonnages are calculated from the survey monthly surfaces, 

and grades are obtained from the Grade Control model. 

 

• Low grade is cut off to 3.0 g/t Au. There are three bins separating 0 – 5% S, 5% – 
8% S and >8%S. 
 

• Medium grade is 3.0 g/t Au to 4.5 g/t Au, using the same three grades of sulphur. 
 

• High grade is above 4.5 g/t Au, split in 0 – 7.8% S and >7.8% S.

The stockpiling strategy has been designed taking into account the following: 

 

• High grade feed to four autoclaves. (Highest gold with approximate sulphur grade 
of 6.75%, which is just below the optimal sulphur feed.) 
 

• High grade, high sulphur feed to allow the blending up of the HG 4 autoclave 
stockpile to achieve the 6.79% S feed. (Increased blending ratios when one or 
more autoclaves are offline and the available sulphur feed is higher.) It is 
operationally less risky to blend up. 
 

• Medium grade, low sulphur stockpile on the high grade stockpile to allow 
blending down of the feed if sulphur grades are too high. This may reduce the 
feed gold grade but will optimize the sulphur grade, as a too high sulphur feed 
has a significantly detrimental impact on the metallurgical process. 
 

• Maximizing NPV and cash flow by mining first those blocks identified as per the 
Ranking Index parameter.  This maximization is constrained by the requirement 
for an average of 6.79% S for any period of time.  Such maximization requires 
substantial use of stockpiled material and the corresponding additional 
rehandling costs. 
 

• Whenever possible, the maximization will prefer feed from ROM ore above 
reclaimed ore in order to minimize rehandling cost. 
 

• Gradual ramping up to full plant capacity at 24,000 tpd in late 2013, as the four 
autoclaves become fully operational. 
 

• Two or three active production phases at any time, with a minimum of two 
phases supplying ore to the plant for sulphur blending purposes. Maximum 
production rate per phase and per period established according to the geometry 
of the phases and the number of loading units that can work continually within 
that geometry. 
 

• Average of seven to eight sinking benches per annum. 
 

• On average, about four days per year of non-production has been allowed due to 
severe weather events. 

 

PRE-PRODUCTION MINE WORKS 
Mine development began in August 2010. The initial pre-stripping requirement is very 

low as previous mining has left ore outcropping on surface. Current mine activity is in the 

Monte Negro 1 and Moore 1 phases.  Until first ore is processed, all ROM ore is being 

stockpiled; by the start of the plant feed in July 2012, the total ore on stockpile is 

scheduled to be 21 Mt.

Additionally, since 2009, the limestone quarries have been in production. Prior to 

plant start-up, roads to connect both pits with the primary crusher, the two stockpile 

areas, and the El Llagal tailings/waste rock facility will be constructed. 

 

CUT-OFF GRADE STRATEGY 
The Ranking Index parameter, which accounts for block value as well as treatment rate, 

is used to maximize NPV of cash flows.  Ranking Index cut-off grades based on profit per 

hour were established for each period and for each category of high, medium, and low 

sulphur content. 

 

ORE CONTROL AND STOCKPILING STRATEGY 
Ore blending for sulphur content, and early processing of high grade ore are key to 

maximizing NPV. Stockpile management and ore control practices, therefore, will be 

a prime consideration. The current proposed scheme for stockpile segregation 

considers 12 bins whose boundaries are based on both gold and sulphur contents in 

the blasted rock.  Bins are in a matrix arrangement. On one axis is gold grade, on 

the other the sulphur content.  Major groups of bins along the gold grade axis will be: 

 

• Waste group: gold grade equal or less than the reserve cut-off (i.e., Ranking 
Index < 0; this value is approximately. equivalent to 1.5 g/t Au). 
 

• Low Grade group: gold < 3.0 g/t. 
 

• Medium Grade group: 3.0 g/t < Au < 4.5 g/t. 
 

• High Grade group: gold > 4.5 g/t. 

 

There will be no regular waste dumps. All waste (except the waste that is produced 

before the process plant starts) will be placed inside the TSF and submerged. The 

waste and the mineralized waste will be deposited adjacent to, but separate from, each 

other, both eventually submerged by tailings. Waste that is produced before the process 

plant is commissioned will temporarily be stored on the Low Grade Stockpile and at the 

soonest opportunity it will be rehandled to the El Llagal TSF. 

 
PVDC recognizes that recovering the mineralized waste in future will be difficult, but is 

potentially achievable if the economic conditions justify the expense.

Rev. 0 Page 16-21 

All three of the upper (ore) categories will be eligible to feed the plant directly from the 

mine or to be allocated to stockpiles. Depending on the sulphur content, both the 

Low Grade group and the Medium Grade group will each be split into three bins, while 

the High Grade group will be split into two bins. The stockpiling and blending plan calls 

for storing each of these eight subcategories in well separated stockpiles. 

 

The stockpile strategy is based, in part, on that in use at the Barrick Kalgoorlie (KCGM) 

operation in Australia, which allows for mixing of mined material on and off the stockpile. 

PVDC evaluated stockpile stability using accepted methodology. Analysis was 

performed at three sections, with results showing both static and dynamic stability, and 

only minor deformation under severe earthquake conditions. 

 

MINE LIFE AND MATERIAL MOVEMENT 
Processing higher grade ore in the early years, while stockpiling lower grade ore for 

later processing, results in a mine life of 18 years and a processing life of 36 years.  In 

the steady state mining years (2012 to 2029), total material movement, including 

limestone, averages about 47 Mtpa, and about 84% of ROM ore is stockpiled for 

later processing. The total ROM material movement scheduled from the pit has been 

capped at 35 Mtpa. The mining schedule is summarized in Figures 16-6, 16-7, and 16-8.

ORE PRODUCTION RATE 
Figure 16-8 illustrates the annual proportion of ore to crusher direct from the mine and 

from medium-to-long term stockpiles. 

 

FIGURE 16-8   PROPORTION OF ORE TO CRUSHER DIRECT FROM MINE 
AND FROM STOCKPILES 
 

 

A major item with respect to gold production is the ability of the mine to produce ore at 

the metal grade and sulphur content levels required to satisfy the processing schedule. 

In this regard, there is a particular risk in 2012 when autoclave capability is still building, 

but high gold production is projected. A good understanding of high grade areas and 

their extent, together with very selective mining practice and a disciplined stockpiling 

process, will be necessary to achieve the scheduled mill feed. The RC grade control 

drilling undertaken in the initial mining areas of Moore and Monte Negro is designed to 

achieve this aim. 

 

SHORT-TERM PLANNING 
The early years of the Project (2012- 2017) are particularly important in terms of setting 

up the mining process and then delivering early high grade ore. To demonstrate

the viability of the planned approach the first three years were planned out on a monthly 

basis. 

 

LIMESTONE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION 
Pueblo Viejo operations will require significant amounts of limestone for: 
 

• Processing. 
 

• Tailings storage facility wall construction for the Lower and Upper Llagal and La 
Piñita facilities. Non-acid generating storage facilities are required, with the walls 
being raised as the required volume of storage capacity increases. 
 

• Construction, such as internal roads, diversion channels, and additional dams. 
Again, non-acid generating material is required. 

 
According to LOM plans, total limestone requirement is as shown in Table 16-8. 

 

TABLE 16-8   PROJECT LIMESTONE REQUIREMENTS 
Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project 

 
Purpose Mt 

Process 99.8 
Road & Construction 108.4 
Waste 8.94 
Total 217.1 

 

The limestone tonnage required, with acceptable quality, has been located in the 

surroundings of the project. About 10 Mt will be obtained from the excavations required 

for processing facilities and workshops, while the remaining requirements will be 

satisfied from the mining of two quarries, namely Quemados and San Juan. The 

Quemados quarry will be mined during the first 11 years of operations after which the 

Lagunas quarry and the Lagunas extension will be mined.  Sufficient high quality 

material (SiO2 content of less than 1%) has been identified, suitable as feed for 

processing limestone aggregate and lime requirements.  

 

The mining of the quarries has been planned with similar parameters to those for the ore 

pits, thereby facilitating the sharing of haulroads and mining equipment.

Rev. 0 Page 16-26 

WASTE DUMP SEQUENCING 
Waste will be classified and dumped according to its gold and sulphur contents. All 

designated waste will be located within the TSF area. Tailings will cover the waste rock 

shortly after its deposition to help minimize acid rock drainage. The waste rock is to be 

deposited in five metre lifts, with the level of tailings generally maintained close to the 

advancing crest level of the waste dump. 

 
To maintain the waste rock level only slightly above the tailings level, two levels of 

waste rock will generally be maintained: (1) A higher waste dump lift which acts similar 

to a coffer dam, and (2) a lower lift behind this higher lift. This gives the plan more 

flexibility to respond to variations in waste rock production rates without curtailing plant 

(and therefore tailings) production rates. 

 
Waste rock will be deposited in the Lower Llagal facility up to the 245 m level, after 

which deposition will be done first in the Upper Llagal facility and then in La Piñita. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the methodology used by PVDC for pit limit determination, cut-off 

grade optimization, production sequence and scheduling, and estimation of 

equipment/manpower requirements is in line with good industry practice.  However, the 

capacity of the TSF could present an operational risk.  All tailings and potential acid 

draining waste rock is stored in the Lower and Upper El Llagal tailings dams and the 

plant throughput is limited by the storage capacity of the TSF.  Any additional waste 

rock, tailings or unexpected water flowing in the TSF could compromise production rates, 

if only for a limited period of time. 

 

MINE EQUIPMENT 

EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS 
Equipment planning has considered mine design production of approximately 45 Mtpa, 

including mill feed of 24,000 tpd, reclamation from stockpiles, with simultaneous mining 

in the limestone quarries and several operating pit phases. The drilling and loading 

equipment has been selected with the aim of combining high productivity and low cost 

with high mobility to allow maximum flexibility and selectivity.

Estimates of truck speeds were based on typical values, with correction factors to allow 

for slower speeds at the benches and at the dumps, and for weather conditions. Truck 

hours were calculated per period, type of material, and loading unit. Ancillary equipment 

includes bulldozers, wheel-dozers, graders, and water trucks. 

 

Some equipment will be purchased early to give additional flexibility and redundancy 

during the particularly critical, initial mining years.  Table 16-9 shows the units of mobile 

equipment purchased during the pre-production and production years of the LOM.

TRAINING PROGRAM AND LABOUR BUILD-UP 
During pioneering work, PVDC personnel will be working in quarries, control, planning, 

and management areas. Hiring of operations and maintenance personnel has begun 

with initial safety training followed by training for individual functions and as equipment 

is available. The build-up has been planned to include: 

 

• New operators, mechanics, and staff for maintenance and operations will be 
hired following a training period of three months.  
 

• For selection of operators, the Vienna Dover system is used, which tests hand-
eye coordination and ability to learn among other skills.  The steps following this 
application are: 

o Medical screening 
o 2 week introduction practising teamwork, motivation and leadership. 
o 5 weeks classroom and field training

• The mine has an apprentice training program and works with the Caterpillar 
agent in Santa Domingo to train graduates from the local Tech High school.  
The best graduates are offered apprentice positions on the mine. Caterpillar 
also has personnel on site. 
 

• The head of training on site is selected from another Barrick operation.  In 
addition, five expatriates and two national trainers are on site.  The expats will 
be replaced by nationals in the middle of 2012.  
 

• Mine operators work 12 hour shifts, 4 days on and 4 days off.  Most staff are on 
a 5 day work week, although some technical jobs are on a 4 days on/ 3 days off 
rotation. All personnel have the option to stay free of charge in the camp while 
working.  This is the company's preferred option in order to avoid fatigue.  
Approximately 75% of employees are expected to stay in camp. 
 

• Staff for technical services is hired 11 months before the start of operations due

17 RECOVERY METHODS 
The following description of recovery methods is largely taken from Barrick's 2007 FSU. 

 

PROCESS PLANT DESCRIPTION 

INTRODUCTION 
PDVC is currently building the processing plant as described in its December 2007 FSU. 

The Board approval was obtained on February 20, 2008, and the formal Notice to 

Proceed was given on February 26, 2008. 

 

Initially, the process plant was to be built using a two phase approach.  Phase 1 was to 

build the process plant with a capacity of 18,000 tpd by installing three autoclaves. 

Subsequently, a fourth autoclave was to be added, which would increase the capacity to 

24,000 tpd as part of an expansion program (Phase 2).  Phase 2 would also require 

additional equipment for some of the other processing units.  During the fourth quarter of 

2009, PDVC made the decision to accelerate the capital outlay program and to proceed 

with installing all four autoclaves in a single phase.  Therefore, the 24,000 tpd plant is 

currently being built. 

 

The Pueblo Viejo deposit is a refractory ore that consists primarily of gold and silver 

intimately associated with pyrite as submicron particles and in solid solution.  Therefore, 

there is a requirement to chemically break down the pyrite to recover the precious 

metals.  In addition, there are cyanide consuming minerals and preg-robbing 

carbonaceous material in some of the ores.  Different processes were investigated, but 

the selected process was whole ore POX followed by cyanidation.  This process has the 

highest energy cost as well as the highest capital cost, but provides the highest recovery 

with 88% to 95% of the gold recovered.   

 

The process plant is designed to process 24,000 tpd of ore and will consist of the 

following unit operations: 

 
• Crushing 
• Semi-autogenous grinding and ball milling 
• Pebble crushing

A simplified block flow sheet of the process plant design is provided as Figure 17-1. 
 

FLOW SHEET DESCRIPTION SUMMARY 
The ore is ground to an optimum size of 80% passing 80 µm and pressure-oxidized in 

autoclaves at a temperature of 230°C and a pressure of 3,450 kPa for 60 minutes to 75 

minutes. The autoclave product is discharged to a flash tank where heat is released, 

cooling the slurry to approximately 106°C.  It is then transferred by gravity to the hot cure 

circuit where the slurry temperature is maintained between 100° and 105°C for 12 hours 

in order to dissolve the basic ferric sulphate that forms during autoclaving.  

 

The next step in the process is to separate the acidic liquors from the oxidized solids 

within the slurry.  This is accomplished using a wash procedure in a three-stage counter-

current wash thickener circuit to remove more than 99% of the sulphuric acid and the 

dissolved metal sulphates.  The washed thickened slurry is then contacted with steam 

from one of the autoclave flash vessels to heat the slurry to 95°C ahead of a two-stage 

lime boil treatment.  Adding a milk of lime slurry to the oxidized slurry effectively raises 

the pH to the 10.5 to 10.8 range breaking down the silver jarosites, exposing silver 

minerals to CIL leaching.  Lime boil slurry is then diluted with reclaimed water and cooled 

to 40°C in cooling towers.  The cooled slurry is pumped to the CIL circuit.

The addition of lime to the lime boil circuit provides sufficient protective alkalinity in the 

CIL circuit.  No further addition of lime is required in this circuit.  In the CIL circuit, 

cyanide is added to dissolve the gold and silver and is contacted with activated carbon to 

absorb the gold and silver cyanide complexes.  Retention time in this circuit varies from 

18 hours to 22 hours, depending on the processing rate. 

 

The acidic liquor overflow from CCD thickener #1 is sent to the autoclave plant to 

quench flash steam.  The quench vessel underflow is then treated with limestone in the 

iron precipitation circuit to remove ferric iron.  From there, the overflow from the iron 

precipitation thickener is forwarded to the hydrogen sulphide precipitation plant to 

recover the copper.  H2S gas is added to the solution to precipitate the copper as CuS.  

The precipitate is thickened and filtered to produce market grade copper concentrate.  

Neutralizing the thickener overflow solution is accomplished first with limestone and then 

with the introduction of lime in the HDS circuit where most of the remaining metal 

sulphates are precipitated.  After neutralization, the slurry is thickened in a high rate 

thickener.  The thickener underflow (sludge) is pumped to the tailings pond while the 

overflow is cooled and recycled to the process water tank for distribution, including use 

as wash water in the CCD circuit.  

 

Loaded carbon from the CIL circuit is forwarded to the refinery for acid washing and 

stripping.  The resulting pregnant strip solution proceeds to the EW circuit for gold and 

silver recovery while the barren carbon travels to the reactivation kiln.  A combined gold 

and silver sludge from the EW cells is filtered, dried, retorted to remove the mercury from 

the sludge, and smelted to produce bullion bars. The reactivated carbon is recycled to 

the CIL circuit. 

  

The CIL tailings slurry pours over the safety screens and is pumped to the cyanide 

destruction circuit.  The conventional SO2/air process reduces the cyanide content of the 

CIL tailings solution from more than 100 g/t cyanide to less than the regulatory maximum 

of 5 mg/L (5 ppm) cyanide.  The detoxified slurry together with the HDS circuit sludge is 

pumped to the tailings storage facility (TSF).

PRIMARY CRUSHING  
The primary crushing station will consist of a primary gyratory crusher equipped with a 

hydraulic rock breaker to reduce oversize rocks in the dump pocket.  Water sprays will 

be provided at the truck dump pocket and an ADS (fogging dust suppression) system will 

be deployed at the feeder to conveyor transfer point to comply with the dust emission 

standards in the Dominican Republic.  

 

The ore is transferred from the gyratory crusher station, by an apron feeder onto a 

stacking conveyor that discharges the ore onto a 16,000 t live capacity stockpile.  A belt 

scale will monitor the material flow rate from the crusher to the stockpile. 

 

A dust control system positioned at the reclaim tunnel below the stockpile will service the 

material transfer locations.  Two variable speed apron feeders under the coarse ore 

stockpile reclaim the ore and feed a common SAG mill feed conveyor.  The feed rate to 

the SAG mill is monitored by a belt scale installed along the SAG mill feed conveyor.  

The proposed ore primary crusher has a rated capacity slightly higher than the design 

rate of 24,000 tpd.  

 

The proposed limestone primary crusher is exactly the same size as the ore primary 

crusher, and therefore more than adequate for the 12,000 tpd rate.  

 

To counteract critical size build-up in the mill, the SAG mill will be equipped with pebble 

ports.  Oversize pebbles are screened from the discharge and transferred onto a 

conveyor recirculation loop feeding the material to the pebble crusher, or alternatively 

bypassing the pebble crusher if it is not in service.  The pebble crusher product is 

conveyed back to the SAG mill feed conveyor.  The undersize material is pumped to the 

cyclone feed pump box.  

 

The ball mill will be in closed circuit with a cluster of fifteen cyclones, with ability to 

expand to eighteen.  The underflow is fed via gravity back to the ball mill feed chute 

while the overflow flows by gravity over two vibrating trash screens.  The undersize 

material is thickened to approximately 50% solids in a 70 m diameter high rate thickener.  

The thickener underflow is pumped to the autoclave feed storage tanks while the 

overflow is recycled to the grinding circuit.

PRESSURE OXIDATION 
The selection of the process design criteria and the design of the POX and ancillary 

processes based on the results of the various test programs were completed by Hatch 

Ltd. (Hatch). 

 

The POX facility is comprised of four autoclave circuits, with minimal interconnections to 

achieve high capacity utilization.  Each autoclave circuit includes a high pressure slurry 

feed system, slurry pre-heater, autoclave vessel and agitators, flash vessels, and gas 

handling system.  The operation of the autoclaves are supported by agitator seal 

systems, a steam boiler (for start-up), and a high pressure cooling water system for 

autoclave temperature control. 

 

The autoclave vessels are refractory lined with approximate process dimensions of 4.9 

m inside diameter and an overall length of 37 m. The autoclaves will operate at 230ºC 

and 3,450 kPa, with a retention time of between 60 minutes and 75 minutes depending 

upon the sulphur grade and feed density.  

 

Oxygen required for the oxidation reactions in the autoclaves is provided from two on-

site oxygen plants. 

 

Two of the three autoclave circuit preheating systems are used for slurry feed heating, 

while the third pre-heating system is used for heating washed CCD underflow slurry prior 

to the lime boil process.  The design incorporates slurry piping interconnections between 

these preheating systems to allow for maintenance and de-scaling while maintaining 

capacity utilization.  The gas handling design will adopt a solution spray quench process 

providing over 90% condensation of the flash steam. Depending on the preheating 

requirements, a portion of the flash steam will be used to preheat autoclave feed slurry 

or lime boil feed slurry with the remaining steam reporting to the gas handling system.  

The quenching of the excess flash steam and autoclave vent gas is accomplished with 

CCD overflow solution.  The hot CCD overflow solution then reports to the partial 

neutralization circuit.

OXYGEN PLANT 
Two oxygen plants will be built concurrently.  The first air separation unit (ASU) is 

designed to supply 2,850 tpd of gaseous oxygen as well as trickle liquid oxygen for the 

first three autoclaves.  Although this is a large capacity ASU plant (compared to industry 

references), it is still well below the largest single ASU plant of 4,300 tpd operating at 

SASOL, Secunda, South Africa.  The second plant which will supply the fourth autoclave 

will have a capacity of 1,100 tpd contained oxygen.  

 

The ASU plant design is based on machinery that is widely used in the cryogenic gas 

industry and will adopt a double column cryogenic distillation process.  This is a 

conventional process for the air separation industry. 

 

HOT CURING 
Oxidized slurry produced from the 24,000 tpd capacity rate is held in five cascading 

tanks in series for a total of 12 hours.  Upon expansion to 24,000 tpd, an additional tank 

will be commissioned to ensure the optimal dissolution of basic ferric sulphate.  The 

slurry feed to the hot cure circuit arrives at approximately 105°C and, based on heat loss 

calculations performed by Hatch, exits at approximately 100°C.  The cured slurry flows 

by gravity to the first CCD thickener. 

 

CCD WASHING 
A three-stage CCD circuit is utilized to treat the slurry from the last hot cure tank.  Each 

thickener will be 70 m in diameter and constructed of 316 L stainless steel walls, floor 

and rakes.  The purpose of this circuit is to wash and separate acid and soluble metal 

salts from the gold-bearing solids phase prior to the CIL circuit.  The slurry is gravity fed 

to the first stage CCD thickener mix tank where it is diluted with overflow from the 

downstream CCD thickener.  Overflow solution is then sent to the autoclave flash steam 

quench vessels where it is used to condense and scrub excess steam before proceeding 

to the ferric precipitation reactors.  The balance of the overflow solution is fed directly to 

the ferric precipitation neutralization circuit ahead of copper recovery.  The underflow 

slurry is pumped to the flash steam preheating vessels in the autoclave area prior to 

discharge to the silver enhancement lime boil circuit.

Rev. 0 Page 17-8 

As per the design, the nominal wash ratio in the CCD circuit is expected to yield a wash 

efficiency of 99.0% to 99.5%. 

 

FERRIC IRON PRECIPITATION AND COPPER RECOVERY 
The copper recovery circuit will use the hydrogen sulphide precipitation technology to 

precipitate the contained copper in the CCD wash solution as a copper sulphide 

concentrate.  The process uses bacteria to convert elemental sulphur to H2S gas, which 

then reacts with copper ions to precipitate copper sulphide (CuS).  

 

The introduction of limestone in a series of mechanically agitated, stainless steel 

precipitation tanks works to partially neutralize the CCD overflow solution.  The 

discharge from the limestone neutralization tanks is directed by gravity to the ferric 

thickener in the copper recovery plant.  The pH is closely controlled in the first two 

precipitation tanks to precipitate ferric iron from the solution while minimizing the amount 

of copper co-precipitation.  The iron precipitate is gravity fed to the ferric thickener, which 

was sized at the FSU stage to handle the full flow of 24,000 tpd.  The thickener 

underflow sludge is pumped to the neutralization circuit for completion of the 

neutralization process. 

 

The ferric thickener overflow solution is pumped to the copper contactor circuit where it 

is mixed with H2S gas.  In order to handle the 24,000 tpd production rate, three copper 

contactors will be mechanically agitated.  Closed-top tanks will ensure adequate mixing 

and gas liquid mass transfer.  The H2S gas is produced by a bacterial process, which 

utilizes sulphur reducing bacteria to convert elemental sulphur into H2S under anaerobic 

conditions.  The two bioreactors are gas-lift loop type reactors that allow the generated 

H2S gas to be drawn off the head space of the bio-reactor unit and compressed by gas 

blowers.  The compressed gas stream, containing 8% to 10% volume H2S, is sparged 

into the copper contactor vessels.  The barren H2S gas returning from the contactors, 

saturated with water is dewatered in a condensate knockout stage and returned to the 

bio-reactor.  

 

The precipitated copper sulphide solution is degassed and fed to a 50 m diameter 

thickener clarifier to facilitate solids removal.  The underflow is then pumped to a 

secondary dewatering stage.  The sulphide filter cake is discharged onto a conveyor

delivered to a bagging facility.  Bagged concentrate will be containerized and delivered 

by flatbed trucks from the plant site to a port near Santo Domingo.  

 

The copper clarifier overflow solution is pumped to the high density sludge neutralization 

circuit.  

 

All of the tank head spaces containing H2S are connected to a common header to 

effectively capture and control fugitive emissions.  The vapour passes through a 

condensate trap and emergency scrubber unit.  It is then compressed by the blower and 

re-introduced into the bio-reactor vessel. 

 

HIGH DENSITY SLUDGE NEUTRALIZATION CIRCUIT  
Neutralization of remaining acidity and the precipitation of metals and sulphate in the 

CCD overflow are accomplished in the HDS neutralization circuit. The HDS 

neutralization circuit will comprise a three stage limestone addition followed by two 

stages of lime treatment with an additional reactor added to both the limestone and lime 

circuit during expansion to 24,000 tpd. 

 

The limestone and lime reactor tanks are to be arranged in a staggered, cascading 

fashion.  Step-down elevations along the train will enable gravity flow.  Limestone slurry 

is metered into a mix tank where it is blended with recycled HDS thickener underflow to 

condition the recycled material and promote the HDS precipitation seeding process.  The 

mix tank overflows into the first neutralization tank and mixes with the cooled copper 

clarifier overflow solution and ferric thickener underflow product stream. 

 

The neutralized slurry is gravity fed from the final lime neutralization tank to the HDS 

thickener. The HDS thickener underflow is pumped to the tailings pond via the cyanide 

destruction tailings pump box. The overflow solution is directed to the HDS thickener 

overflow tank and pumped to the HDS solution cooling towers. 

 

HDS SOLUTION COOLING 
HDS thickener overflow solution is pumped to a bank of eight cooling towers to allow for 

temperature reduction.  The actual cooling requirements are determined by the heat

Rev. 0 Page 17-10 

balance.  The cooled solution is pumped to the process water tank.   It is then distributed 

for use as CCD wash, limestone grinding and flocculant dilution. 

 

SILVER ENHANCEMENT LIME BOIL PROCESS 
The CCD circuit thickener underflow is pumped to the lime boil preheating vessel and 

using steam from the autoclave flash tanks, is reheated to 95°C.  The reheated slurry is 

treated with lime to effectively break down the silver jarosites formed during the POX and 

hot cure processing stages.  This allows for maximum silver extraction during CIL 

leaching.  

 

The lime boil circuit, installed to treat the full production rate of 24,000 tpd, will consist of 

two agitated tanks. The lime boil slurry is cooled to approximately 40°C in five slurry 

cooling towers.  The cooled slurry is pumped to the CIL circuit where gold and silver are 

extracted using cyanide and activated carbon.  

 

CARBON-IN-LEACH (CIL) CYANIDATION 
A CIL circuit was selected to maximize gold and silver extraction from preg-robbing 

carbonaceous ore sources in the deposit. 

 

The cooled lime boil discharge is screened for the removal of trash and fed to the first of 

11 agitated tanks providing a retention time of approximately 20 hours. 

 

A carbon loading of 2,000 g/t Au is projected from the pilot plant tests carried out at the 

FSU stage when processing ore grading 5.0 g/t Au or better.  This will require a carbon 

advance rate of 72 tpd for the full 24,000 tpd ore production rate. 

 

The pilot plant tests indicated average gold and silver extractions in the CIL circuit of 

92% and 85% respectively. The average cyanide addition is estimated at 1.0 kg/t of CIL 

feed.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 17-11 

CYANIDE DESTRUCTION 
The average total cyanide level in the CIL discharge is estimated at 150 mg/L.  The 

SO2/air process was retained based on the results of pilot plant cyanide destruction 

testwork conducted by Inco Technology. 

 

The Weak Acid Dissociable Cyanide total cyanide and copper levels in the treated 

effluent produced during an updated laboratory evaluation of the 2006 pilot plant CIL 

product showed good effluent quality and met the target levels of less than 1 mg/L. 

 

CARBON ACID WASHING AND STRIPPING 
Twelve tonne batches of loaded carbon from CIL Tank #1 are acid washed with diluted 

hydrochloric acid and rinsed with water before being stripped using the Pressure Zadra 

elution process.  The pregnant solution gravity-flows to the pregnant solution tank and is 

then pumped at a controlled rate to the EW circuit. 

 

The stripped carbon is thermally reactivated at a temperature of 700°C in two of three 

electrically fired horizontal furnaces at a rate of 1,000 kg/h. The kiln exhaust gases vent 

through a wet scrubber followed by passage through columns packed with sulphur-

impregnated carbon designed to remove mercury. 

  

The reactivated carbon is screened to remove carbon fines before being returned to the 

last CIL tank to replace the forwarded carbon. The fine carbon is transferred to a settling 

pond and periodically recovered and bagged for sale.  

 

ELECTROWINNING 
The pregnant solution or eluate is pumped from the pregnant solution tank to five parallel 

EW trains.  All EW cells will be provided with a gas extraction system connected to a 

mercury capture system.  

 

Gold and silver, along with trace impurities (mainly copper and mercury), are plated onto 

punched stainless steel plate cathodes.  The barren electrolyte, containing less than 2 

g/t Au, flows by gravity to a collection tank from there it is pumped to the barren solution 

storage tank for recycling to the elution circuit.

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 17-12 

The EW cells will use non-basketed cathodes within the sludge-type EW cells to allow 

for high pressure cathode washing of the gold and silver sludge within the cell unit.  The 

cells will periodically be taken offline to allow for the harvesting of cathodes and the 

recovery of gold and silver.  The resulting gold and silver sludge will be filtered in a plate 

and frame filter. 

 

REFINING 
The gold/silver sludge from the EW circuit may contain up to 5% mercury.  If this trace 

amount is not removed, it will volatilize during smelting and report to the off-gases.  To 

comply with air quality standards, a mercury retort will be provided to remove and 

recover the mercury from the sludge before smelting. 

 

The filtered sludge is loaded into boats, dried, and heated in an electric mercury retort.  

The retort is kept under vacuum, to remove the contained mercury.  The gas stream 

containing the volatilized mercury passes through a water-cooled condenser collecting 

the mercury in flasks.  Sulphur-impregnated carbon columns remove residual mercury 

from the discharge gas of the condenser. 

 

The mercury-free sludge will be fluxed and smelted using from two to three units at a 

time among four induction furnaces to produce 1,000 oz bullion bars.  The furnaces will 

be provided with a dust collection gas baghouse system.  This collection system will 

recover the gold- and silver-laden dust generated during smelting and clean the furnace 

off-gases before discharge in the atmosphere.  

 

TAILING DISPOSAL AND TAILINGS WATER RECLAIM  
The detoxified leach residue will be combined with the sludge recovered from the 

neutralization circuit for disposal to the El Llagal TSF.  Earthen containment berms will 

be installed alongside the tailings pipeline.  Any spillage will be directed toward and 

stored in collection ponds. 

 

The TSF will be built using broken limestone material supply by the limestone quarries 

as well as a low permeability core of saprolite material recovered from the immediate 

site.  Granular filters material will be imported from off-site or manufactured from 

quarried rock.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 17-13 

The tailings pumping system will consist of two dual stage slurry pump trains with 

variable speed drives to regulate the discharge head to match with the gradually rising 

tailings embankment height.  While one unit is operational, the second unit will serve as 

a standby unit.  Spigots will distribute tailings across the tailings embankment towards 

the upstream side of the storage pond.  Additional spigots will be provided to discharge 

along the eastern and western sides to create a small, supernatant pool in the middle of 

the storage pond. 

 

A reclaim pump barge will pump the tailings water to the process plant from the 

supernatant pool.  Due to the negative impact of chloride ions in the reclaim water on 

gold extraction recycling of this tailings water to the process will only be implemented 

under extreme drought and flood conditions.  Within the catchment of TSF, any spillage 

from the reclaim pipeline will drain into the TSF.  Beyond that, the reclaim pipeline will be 

installed alongside the tailings pipeline, inside the common containment berms for 

spillage control. 

  

Seepage from the TSF will be collected in a small pond in front of the main containment 

embankment.  A pumping and pipeline system will return this seepage to the 

impoundment.  

 

The TSF will also be used to store potentially acid-generating mine waste rock.  The 

material will be trucked to the storage site by way of a haul road.  To prevent ARD 

formation, the waste rock will be kept submerged.  The total storage capacity of the TSF 

will be for 450 million m³ of waste material (waste volume) resulting from storing 262 

million tonnes of waste from the processing plant as well as 268 million tonnes of waste 

rock.

FLOW SHEET 
Ground limestone and lime are required to neutralize acidic liquors and to control the pH 

in the CIL circuit.  Lime is also used to adjust the pH of the effluent after water treatment.  

Satisfying the 24,000 tpd ore process requirement includes grinding 9,070 tpd of 

limestone to 80% passing 60 µm and calcining 2,785 tpd of limestone in vertical kilns to 

produce 1,484 tpd of lime, all of which will be slaked in a ball mill slaker.  The proposed 

limestone plant will consist of the following unit operations: primary crushing and 

screening, grinding, calcining, and lime slaking. 

 

PRIMARY CRUSHING AND SCREENING 
ROM limestone is crushed to minus 85 mm (P80) in a gyratory crusher (1,067 mm x 

1,650 mm) equipped with a rock breaker to break oversize rocks in the dump pocket.   

Provision is included for the future installation of a dust control system at the primary 

crushing station if required to reduce fugitive dust emission.  The configuration of the 

limestone crusher is similar to that for the ore.  The crusher product is screened and the 

+50 mm -110 mm intermediate fraction is sent to the kiln circuit for calcination.  The 

balance of the crusher product reports to the limestone SAG mill feed stockpile. 

 

GRINDING 
The limestone grinding circuit will consist of a SAG mill (6.70 m dia. x 3.65 m effective 

grinding length, EGL) driven by a 2,610 kW synchronous motor with a variable frequency

drive (VFD) and a ball mill (4.88 m dia x 9.80 m EGL) driven by a 3,540 kW synchronous 

motor.  The SAG mill will be in open circuit while the ball mill will be in closed circuit with 

a cluster of sixteen hydrocyclones.  The limestone slurry is pumped to three agitated 

storage tanks holding approximately 6,500 tonnes of limestone. This provides 22 hours 

of storage capacity at peak limestone demand. 

 

LIMESTONE CALCINING AND LIME SLAKING 
The lime calcining plant will be designed to process 2,785 tpd of limestone to produce 

1,484 tpd of lime required for the ore production rate of 24,000 tpd.  The high lime 

requirement and the availability of high quality limestone deposits near the mine justify 

the installation of the lime plant. 

 

Three 550 tpd vertical twin-shaft parallel flow regenerative (PFR) lime kilns were 

selected because of their efficiency.  The kilns will be fed with +50 mm -110 mm 

intermediate screen product produced from the screening circuit. 

 

Lime is slaked at a rate of 1,484 tpd in a ball mill operating in closed circuit with one 

hydrocyclone to produce hydrated lime slurry.  The lime slurry is pumped to four agitated 

storage tanks and is distributed from these tanks via lime loops to the lime boil and 

neutralization circuits, and to the effluent treatment plant.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
The following description of Project infrastructure is largely taken from AMC's 2011 

Technical Report. 

 

The main road from Santo Domingo to within about 22 km of the mine site is a surfaced, 

four-lane, divided highway in generally good condition.  Access from the main road to 

the site is via a two-lane, surfaced road.  In order to transport the autoclaves, which 

weigh over 700 t each, a road from the north coast was upgraded instead of the route 

from Santo Domingo.  Upgrading covered road and bridge improvements, clearing of 

overhead obstructions, erosion control, bypass route construction, clearing utility 

interferences and work permitting. Gravel surfaced, internal access roads provide 

access to the mine site facilities.  A network of haul roads are being built to supplement 

existing roads so that mine trucks can haul ore, mine overburden, and limestone from 

the various quarries. 

 

As well as the existing access roads, current site infrastructure includes accommodation, 

offices, truck shop, medical clinic and other buildings, water supply, and old tailings 

impoundments with some water treatment facilities.  Some of these facilities are being 

upgraded or renovated.  

 

The new process plant site will be protected by double and single fence systems. Within 

the plant site area, the freshwater system, potable water system, fire water system, 

sanitary sewage system, storm drains, and fuel lines will be buried underground.  

Process piping will typically be left aboveground on pipe racks or in pipe corridors. 

 

POWER PLANT  
Power requirements will be approximately 175 MW for the full 24,000 tpd production 

rate.  Due to the fact that the power supply from the national grid in the Dominican 

Republic is fairly unreliable, even though some improvements were made over the 

recent years, PDVC made the decision at the FSU stage not to rely on the national grid 

to supply permanent power to the site.  The current plan for permanent power supply by 

March 2012 calls for 93 MW from an existing Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) plant (Monte Rio) 

located on the coast near Azua.  This requires the construction of a 122 km 230 kV dual

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 18-2 

circuit transmission line and associated substation from the plant to the mine site.   To 

complete power requirements, a new power plant will be constructed at San Pedro de 

Marcoris with a transmission line to site. 

 

Due to significant construction delays which have been incurred by the project, PDVC 

has decided as a mitigation measure to use a temporary alternative to supply power for 

the forecast commissioning and production ramp-up milestones. The plan is as follows: 

 

• Supply 13 MW for pre-commissioning from on-site diesel generators  
 

• Supply an additional 30 MW for commissioning from onsite diesel generators. 
 

• Complete a temporary connection to the national grid to supply up to 65 MW until 
March 2012 to operate the processing plant initially at 6,000 tpd (80 MW total 
site) then eventually 12,000 tpd (107 MW total site). 
 

• Once the Monte Rio plant starts delivering the planned 93 MW, power 
requirements from the grid would vary from 15 MW to 37 MW until the new power 
plant at San Pedro de Marcoris is available. 

 

Construction power for the Project is provided by small 1 MW portable diesel-fired power 

plants.  

 

It is the opinion of RPA that the permanent plan and back-up plans for supplying power 

to the site are adequate, although successful implementation remains contingent on a 

number of factors, including granting all the necessary permits and also resolving current 

land claims and issues from local residents. 

 

SITE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM  
Power will be distributed through the site from the mine main substation via a single 230 

kV bus system. In addition, four main transformers will provide power for all site loads, 

with two being dedicated to the oxygen plants. 

 

In case of interruption, the plant will operate on emergency feed. This will be provided by 

15 MW of diesel generation that connects to the main substation for distribution to critical 

areas such as lighting, communication, and computer and process equipment which has 

already been installed.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 18-3 

PROCESS CONTROL FACILITIES  
The plant wide distributed control system (DCS) will use Ethernet communication links, 

fibre optics, Foundation Fieldbus for analogue devices, conventional controls for discrete 

devices, and radio-links for remote sites.  Three main control rooms, 13 satellite control 

rooms, and three maintenance workstations will be located throughout the site. 

 

COMMUNICATION FACILITIES  
A redundant fibre communication backbone system of approximately 40 km will link and 

manage the data transmission of the DCS, third party PLCs, motor controls, fire 

detection system, Vo-IP telephone system, and computers around the mine site. 

 
FUEL 
Two permanent fuelling stations will feed the fleet of mine vehicles.  A permanent HFO 

storage will supply the lime kilns.  New tanks and fuel stations will be built for fuel 

storage during construction. 

 

WATER SUPPLY  
The Hatillo and Hondo Reservoirs will supply fresh water to the site.  Reclaimed water 

from the TSF sites will only be used as a supplementary water supply under drought and 

flood situations.  Barge-mounted pumps at the larger Hatillo Reservoir will pump fresh 

water to the Hondo Reservoir for make-up purposes.  Fresh water will then be pumped 

to a fresh water/fire water tank at 400m level and a freshwater pond, and from there will 

be distributed throughout the site for process, fire protection and potable needs.  The 

potable water will be a treated system.  

 

Initial water for earthworks and construction is being supplied largely from the Maguaca 

River, but also from the pipeline that connects the Hondo Reservoir and the fresh water 

pond.  Potable water for construction offices, dining rooms, toilets, and use mainly at the 

plant site, is being supplied during construction from a temporary tank located north of 

the oxygen plant.  Potable water is being delivered by trucks to another potable water 

tank located at the south side of the plant site.

Rev. 0 Page 18-4 

STORM WATER  
The plant site is located on a ridge between two drainage catchments.  Where possible, 

runoff from the process plant will be directed to the Margajita drainage area to separate it 

from the storm water runoff from the old facilities.  Otherwise, a collection pond will 

capture the runoff before it is returned to the process plant to serve as make-up water. 

 

WASTE MANAGEMENT  
Domestic waste water from the various sites will be collected through an underground 

gravity sewer system.  Separate, underground, gravity systems will be built to serve the 

construction and operations camps.  The clean effluent will be discharged to the local 

river system.  Non hazardous domestic solid waste will be sent by truck to a central 

handling facility.  An incinerator will be installed at the non-hazardous waste dump to 

burn the solid waste. 

 

SEWAGE TREATMENT  
The proposed sewage treatment configuration is based on three 280 m3/d plants at the 

construction camp, one 280 m3/d plant at the plant site, and one 61 m3/d plant for the 

houses.  All three plants utilize the same three-part modular arrangement concept: 

primary settlement tank, biological treatment unit with biological rotating contactor, and 

final settling tank. 

 

FIRE PROTECTION  
Fire protection throughout the site will be provided by a variety of measures, including 

fire walls, hose stations, automatic sprinkler systems, and fire hydrants.  A fresh 

water/fire water tank will supply fire water to the site.  The fire water will be distributed to 

the protected areas through an underground water pipes network. 

 

DUST CONTROL 
A scrubber will be used as a dust control system for the refinery furnace.  Water sprays 

and fogging systems will also be used where required on the site as dust control 

measures depending on specific needs. 

 

Dust control on roads will include watering and use of brine solutions.

LANDFILL  
Non-hazardous material will be stored in an area south of the Mejita TSF for removal at 

a later date.  Landfills for historical hazardous waste which are the responsibility of the 

Dominican Republic Government are proposed to be located east of the Mejita TSF. 

 
CONSTRUCTION 
In order to build the Project, PVDC adopted the construction execution strategy of using 

internationally renowned major Engineering, Procurement, and Construction 

Management (EPCM) organizations to oversee the detailed design, the procurement, 

and the construction management functions for the project.  Fluor Corporation (Fluor) is 

responsible for the execution of the whole plan, while Hatch has been retained to look 

after the POX and the oxygen plants.  BCG Engineering has been directed to perform 

the detailed design of the TSF as well as to provide geotechnical engineering support for 

the Project.  SNC-Lavalin was awarded the EPCM contract for the power plant and 

transmission line. 

 

Most notably, PDVC made the initial decision to use a combined self-perform 

construction (direct hire) and construction management (CM) approach to build the 

Pueblo Viejo Project, using a mix of local subcontractors and specialty contractors.  The 

objective was to optimize the benefits generated by the flexibility of this EPC/CM 

construction approach which was expected to provide cost efficient labour and ready 

access to equipment and materials, particularly in the early phases of construction.  A 

key consideration in this process was helping PDVC build strong relationships with the 

local community, authorities, and labour organizations. 

 
It is the opinion of RPA that PDVC has used an adequate construction execution 

strategy.  It is very common for major mining companies to use internationally renowned 

large EPCM organization to help them with the construction.  In this case Fluor, Hatch, 

and SNC-Lavalin are all well known major EPCM firms with extensive experience with 

international major mining construction projects. 

 

The First Gold milestone actual forecast is for the middle of 2012 vs. a planned date of 

September 21, 2011.  Although this would represent a nine to ten month delay, RPA 

believes that this would not constitute an unacceptable performance.  Considering the

Rev. 0 Page 18-6 

scope of this Project and associated complexity, as well as the fact that the mining 

industry is currently very active with several major mining construction projects being 

built, delays could be expected.  Another important factor to take into consideration is 

that PDVC had substantially increased the scope of the Project by deciding in 2009 to 

build the processing plant with a 24,000 tpd capacity in one phase instead of the initial 

two phase approach.  This difference in scope can easily account for extending the 

construction schedule by three to four months. 

 

The completion of the 230 kV transmission line is on the critical path and efforts must be 

devoted to ensure completion in a timely fashion.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
MARKETS 
Gold, silver, and copper are the principal commodities at Pueblo Viejo and are freely 

traded, at prices that are widely known, so that prospects for sale of any production are 

virtually assured.  Prices are usually quoted in US dollars per troy ounce for gold and 

silver and US dollars per pound for copper. 

 

CONTRACTS 
Pueblo Viejo is planned as a large modern operation and Barrick and Goldcorp are 

major international firms with policies and procedures for the letting of contracts.  The 

contracts for smelting and refining are normal contracts for a large producer. 

 

There are numerous contracts at the mine including project development contracts to 

provide services to augment Barrick's efforts.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, 
PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 
The following description of environment studies, permitting, and social/community 

impact is largely taken from AMC's 2011 Technical Report. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY 
The Rosario Pueblo Viejo Mine operated prior to June 1999.  Previous development 

included the mining of two main pits (Monte Negro and Moore) and several smaller pits, 

construction of a plant site, and construction of two tailings impoundments (Las Lagunas 

and Mejita).  Waste rock dumps and low grade ore stockpiles from these operations are 

located throughout the pit areas.  When the Rosario mine shut down, proper closure and 

reclamation was not undertaken.  The result was a legacy of polluted soil and water and 

contaminated infrastructure. 

 

The major legacy environmental issue at the Project is ARD.  It has developed from 

exposure of sulphides occurring in the existing pit walls, waste rock dumps, and 

stockpiles to air, water, and bacteria.  Untreated and uncontrolled ARD has 

contaminated local streams and rivers and has led to deterioration of water quality and 

aquatic resources both on the mine site and offsite.  There have been previous attempts 

to treat the ARD water, but with limited success. 

 

The Mejita and Las Lagunas tailings storage facilities were constructed during the 

Rosario mine operation.  It is reported that uncontrolled seepage has occurred from 

these impoundments since they were commissioned and that the geotechnical stability 

of the earth embankment dams and foundation suitability is questionable. 

 

Large amounts of hazardous waste materials were present on the mine site, including 

rusting machinery, hydrocarbon contaminated soils, mercury contaminated materials, 

asbestos, and tailings that had escaped into neighbouring watersheds.  The hazardous 

materials and contaminated infrastructure have now largely been removed from site.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 20-2 

Under the SLA, environmental remediation within the mine site and its area of influence 

is the responsibility of PVDC, while the Dominican government is responsible for historic 

impacts outside the Project development area.  However, agreement was reached in 

2009 that PVDC would donate up to $37.5 million, or half of the government's total 

estimated cost of $75 million, for its clean-up responsibilities.  PVDC will also finance the 

remaining amount, allowing the government to repay the debt with revenues generated 

by the mine.  In December 2010, PVDC agreed to contribute the remaining $37.5 million 

on behalf of the government towards these clean-up activities. 

 

Acting as agents for the government, PVDC is implementing an action plan to install 

infrastructure for capturing ARD water and to reinforce the Mejita TSF.  PVDC will also 

build a water treatment plant larger than would otherwise be required for mining 

operations. This will make it possible for the plant to capture and process water in both 

PVDC's and the government's areas of responsibility. 

 

EnviroGold Limited is developing an operation to re-treat the Las Lagunas tailings.  It is 

understood that the Las Lagunas project area would become the responsibility of the 

Dominican government on completion of the Project and that no liability should fall to 

PVDC.  However, because of the proximity of the area to PVDC's operations and the 

uncertainty of the political and environmental environment in seven or more years, there 

is some risk that PVDC may become involved.  RPA does not believe that any 

involvement would represent a material risk to the Project. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 
A number of consultants were employed to collect background data and baseline 

information on the existing biophysical and human environments from 2002 through 

2007.  The baseline studies covered the immediate Project areas and also areas beyond 

the mine site. 

 

ARD studies confirmed that historic mining (prior to Placer's acquisition of the Project) 

and consequential ARD generation have severely impacted the surrounding area.  Test 

results indicated that most of the exposed rock at the mine site is acidic and contains 

significant sulphide levels providing a source for additional acidity.  The Arroyo Margajita

Barrick Gold Corporation – Pueblo Viejo Project, Project # 1659 
Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 20-3 

is impacted by releases of treated water and treatment sludge followed by extended 

periods of untreated ARD releases.  Tests were performed to assess various 

remediation options. 

 

Air quality baseline studies included collection of particulate matter less than 10 µm in 

size in the town of Maimon and at the Pueblo Viejo camp.  The results indicated that the 

concentration of PM10 particulate matter is in compliance with the Dominican Republic 

daily standard.  Monitoring for the new standard for particles of less than 2.5 μm in size 

has not been undertaken.  Climate and meteorology baseline studies were also 

completed. 

 

An archaeology study was undertaken in the area of the Pueblo Viejo Mine, El Llagal, 

and the area towards the Hatillo Reservoir.  The study identified ten sites with signs of 

past activity of which four are located within the Project boundaries.  An additional 

archaeological site was identified in 2007.  Mitigation plans are being implemented. 

 

The results of aquatic biology studies undertaken in local streams and the Hatillo 

Reservoir indicated that the health characteristics of stream invertebrate communities 

were higher at the Maguaca River stations relative to the Margajita River.  No fish were 

found in the Margajita area and fish habitat is highly degraded.  The absence of small 

fish in the Maguaca River is indicative of historical mining impacts.  None of the species 

captured are on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. 

Fish tissue tests indicate metal concentrations were well below the Canadian 

government benchmark for arsenic, lead, and mercury and therefore consumption of fish 

is not a risk to humans for these elements. 

 

Terrestrial biology vegetation and fauna baseline studies were also performed.  Little 

vegetation cover was found in the pit areas and most of the surrounding area is forested.  

One vegetation species found within the Pueblo Viejo area, introduced as part of the 

mine site reclamation, is protected by the IUCN Red List.  Other species are protected 

by draft local regulations.  None of the 22 mammals identified during the baseline 

studies are listed in a protected category.  Thirteen species of amphibians and 13 

species of reptiles were recorded.  Based on local regulations five of the reptile species 

are considered threatened due to loss of habitat, hunting and impact from introduced

birds.  Three species of the 66 bird species identified are protected by local regulations. 

They are classified as vulnerable on the ICUN Red List due to loss of habitat, hunting 

and impact from introduced birds. 

 

International consultants and PVDC personnel carried out studies for geology and 

geochemistry in the area of El Llagal, the mine site, and the Hatillo Reservoir.  In the El 

Llagal area and the northwestern area of the Hatillo Reservoir, there was no evidence of 

materials with significant potential for acid generation.  Sediment samples collected from 

the upper Maguaca, lower El Llagal, and Lower Naranjo streams indicated low total 

sulphur content.  Higher total sulphur values were found in the western area of the 

Hatillo Reservoir, however, the stream water has neutral pH indicating acid generation is 

not occurring.  In the area of the Las Lagunas TSF, both acid generating potential and 

neutralization potential was found in collected samples.  Rock at the plant site area was 

found to have acid-generating potential. 

 

A soil geochemistry survey was undertaken to determine existing metal levels.  Tests 

were completed for iron, arsenic, mercury, zinc, lead, cadmium, and gallium. 

 

Hydrology conditions in the area have been studied.  Surface water flows at the mine 

site and on the Arroyo Margajita, Rio Maguaca, and Arroyo El Llagal indicate that 

highest flows and runoff could occur between April and December, with lowest flows 

occurring typically between January and March.  Minimum flow rates were established 

and peak instantaneous flows were estimated.  This work is being used to develop water 

management plans for the mine site.  Stream flow measurements were obtained at 

several locations. 

 

Twenty wells were drilled for hydrogeology feasibility study baseline studies around the 

mine site and in the area of El Llagal, Maguaca, and Margajita. Since then, two pumping 

wells in Monte Negro and nine pumping wells in Moore have been drilled. Groundwater 

samples indicate that groundwater contamination is limited to the area of the Cumba pit 

draining towards the Arroyo El Rey and Maguaca River, and to the area of Monte Negro.  

Groundwater draining towards the Cañada Hondo and Marguaca River from the Mejita 

tailings appears to be neutralized by the Hatillo limestone formation. In the area of the

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 16, 2012 
 

Rev. 0 Page 20-5 

Moore and Monte Negro pits, the groundwater is contaminated with acid and trace 

metals. 

 

Twenty-five streams were sampled as part of baseline studies of surface water and 

sediment characterization.  Water quality sampling is continuing at specific sites as part 

of the continuous monitoring program.  The studies indicate that the Margajita River and 

Arroyo Hondo have been most severely affected by acid generation.  The northern 

tributaries of the Margajita River have naturally low pH and low conductivity and the 

southern tributaries have neutral pH.  Metal loadings in the Hatillo Reservoir water are 

highest close to the Margajita River inflow, but the sediments show higher metal content 

closer to the dam located downstream.  The upper area of the El Rey River was found to 

be affected by contaminants from the Cumba pit.  The Maguaca River has been slightly 

affected by mine site contaminants that potentially affect the lower Yuna River.  Elevated 

sulphate concentrations in the Yuna River at the confluence with the Margajita River are 

slightly lower than Dominican Republic standards.  Good quality water and sediment 

were found in the El Llagal area. 

 

Wetland characterization studies were carried out, with three stations in the Las Lagunas 

wetland and two stations in the Mejita wetland being sampled.  The results indicated 

generally higher water quality and nutrient parameters and generally lower metal 

parameters in the Las Lagunas wetland.  Ammonia and cyanide concentrations 

decrease from the upper to lower ends of both wetlands.  The benthic invertebrate 

community at the Las Lagunas wetland appeared to be healthier than the Mejita 

wetland.

The full list of obligations arising from the various permits, licences, and agreements total 

some 4,600, of which 80% relate to the mine site and the remaining 20% relate mainly to 

the power transmission line and other aspects of power supply. 

 

SPECIAL LEASE AGREEMENT (SLA) 
The SLA is the main agreement covering the Project.   The amended SLA was signed by 

the President of the Dominican Republic in November 2009. 

 

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN 
A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), prepared for the government with the support of 

PVDC and with assistance from expert technical personnel, local consultants, and local 

personnel, was developed in accordance with World Bank Standards.  The RAP was 

approved and signed on September 25, 2007, by representatives of the three local 

communities affected by the plan, the Dominican state, PVDC, and the Catholic Church. 

 

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 
PVDC and the Dominican state signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 

November 30, 2007, that covers funding for resettlement of households under the RAP, 

acquisition of land, and mitigation of the various historical environmental liabilities.  The 

MOU facilitates the advance of funds by PVDC to resolve the historic environmental and 

social liabilities that under the SLA are the government's responsibility and requires the 

government to reimburse PVDC for the funds advanced. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL LICENCE 
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was submitted to the 

government on November 21, 2005.  Following various meetings and workshops, and 

upon conclusion of the government process of review and evaluation, the ESIA and the

environmental management plan (EMP) were approved by the Secretariat of State for 

the Environment and Natural Resources on December 26, 2006, and Environmental 

Licence No. 0101-06 was issued on January 2007.  Conditions of the Environmental 

Licence require submission of detailed designs for the TSFs, installation of monitoring 

stations, and submission for review of the waste management plan and incineration 

plant design.  An updated EMP including silver/copper recovery was submitted on 

September 30, 2007, and subsequently approved in December 2010. 

 

SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY REQUIREMENTS 
The results of a socio-economic baseline study showed poverty and low levels of literacy 

in the towns and local communities around the mine site, together with significant 

unemployment.  Potable water, energy, and sewage systems are non-existent.  

Elementary and high school education is available in local towns, as well as basic 

medical facilities.  The studies found that communities were concerned about the 

reopening of the mine but realized the environmental and social benefits.  The study 

identified the communities most concerned about mining activities and provided a means 

to address their concerns through a community relations program. 

 

WATER AND WASTE MANAGEMENT 

WATER MANAGEMENT 
The following guidelines are used to develop the water management designs for the 

Project: 

• International Cyanide Management Code 

• Dominican Republic Water Quality Standards 

• International Finance Corporation (IFC) Water Quality Guidelines 

• Barrick Water Conservation Standard 

• Barrick Principles for Tailings Management 
 

Mine development is designed to treat the majority of surface water that has been 

impacted by historical mining activity, and to control water quality during mine operation 

and post closure so that the water released to the receiving environment will meet water

Bank.  The treated water will be discharged to the Margajita River.  The compliance point 

for water quality monitoring is the confluence of the Margajita River and the Hatillo 

Reservoir. 

 

PVDC intends to meet compliance standards for water release from new mine 

development upon commencement of operations and within five years of start of 

construction for previously disturbed areas.  Monitoring will be undertaken at the site and 

the regional receiving environment during mine operations and into the post closure 

period. 

 

Within the PVDC development area, two dams are to be constructed to collect and store 

ARD contaminated water prior to treatment.  Contaminated water from the proposed 

mining areas will be captured at Dam 1, located in the headwaters of Arroyo Margajita.  

ARD runoff from the low grade ore stockpile area will be captured at Dam 3 adjacent to 

the Moore pit in the upper Mejita drainage. 

 

Water levels behind Dam 1 and Dam 3 will be maintained at the lowest possible level at 

all times to provide sufficient storage for the calculated 200 year return period storm 

event.  At Dam 1 storage capacity will not be sufficient for the 200 year design storm 

event until year 7.  The pond behind Dam 1 is designed with a geomembrane liner and 

underdrains to limit seepage.  Both dams will be constructed with spillways designed to 

pass the probable maximum flood resulting from the 24-hour Probable Maximum 

Precipitation. 

 

Storage and pumping requirements for the ponds at Dam 1 and Dam 3 have been 

evaluated for return periods up to the design event of 200 years. 

 

Limestone and lime requirements for the water treatment plant have been determined 

based on the results of testwork at the HDS pilot plant.  The pH discharge criterion used 

for the test was 8.5 to 9.0, which meets the Dominican Republic Standards for Mining 

Effluents and Receiving Water Quality applicable to mining effluents discharged to 

surface water (pH 6.0 to 9.0) but is slightly high for drinking water (pH 6.5 to 8.5).

CYANIDE TREATMENT 
Cyanide in the tailings stream will be routed to a partial cyanide-detoxification process to 

destroy most of the cyanide.  The product will be blended with mill neutralization sludge 

prior to pumping to the TSF.  Further cyanide degradation is expected to occur in the 

TSF to a level that will meet discharge criteria.  The treatment process in the 

detoxification plant can be adjusted if necessary to reduce levels of cyanide. 

 

TAILINGS AND WASTE ROCK STORAGE FACILITY 
Tailings and waste rock from mine development will be deposited in the El Llagal valley, 

a tributary of the Rio Maguaca.  The El Llagal valley, 3.5 km south of the plant site, is 

being constructed to store tailings from the CIL circuit blended with sludge from the 

neutralization circuit and also waste rock from the open pits.  The impoundment is 

designed as two cells contained by cross valley dams.  Storage of tailings and waste 

rock under a permanent water cover will prevent the onset of ARD.  The rock fill dams 

are being constructed with a compacted saprolite core to provide an impermeable barrier 

to seepage, and appropriate filter zones are being provided.  Rock that is not susceptible 

to ARD generation is being quarried from within the lease to provide suitable material for 

construction of the downstream rockfill shell. 

 

Design criteria for static and seismic stability meet the minimum safety factors for the 

high to very high consequence of failure classification as recommended by the Canadian 

Dam Association Dam Safety Guidelines.  Flood storage and spillway design have been 

developed based on extreme precipitation events. 

 

Construction of a starter dam will provide storage for the first 1.5 years of production.  

Annual raises in the walls of the TSFs will be designed and constructed to provide 

storage for subsequent years. 

 

Currently, the El Llagal TSF is the only one permitted and approved for construction.  As 

discussed in earlier sections with respect to Mineral Reserve estimates, the current mine 

life (36 years) is constrained by the TSF availability.  Other potential TSF sites have 

been identified and negotiations are underway to obtain relevant permits.

A tailings pipeline from the plant to the TSF and a return tailings pond decant water 

pipeline will be installed.  The pipelines will be provided with secondary containment 

where they cross the river to minimize environmental damage in the unlikely event of a 

rupture at this location.  Excess runoff from the TSF will be treated and released to the 

Arroyo Margajita. 

 

Stabilization upgrade plans have been developed for the Mejita TSF. 

 

LOW GRADE STOCKPILE 
Up to 100 Mt of low grade ore will be stockpiled for treatment after both open pits have 

been mined.  PVDC is assuming that all stockpiles (excluding limestone) will be 

potentially acid-generating and is implementing procedures to collect and treat all runoff. 

 

MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
A Reclamation and Closure Plan (the Plan) has been prepared to assist PVDC in the 

implementation of appropriate environmental management measures during the 

construction and operation of the Project that will facilitate closure when mining and 

processing are complete.  The Reclamation and Closure Plan is one of the 

Environmental Management Plans (EMP) which forms part of the Environmental 

Management System (EMS) for Pueblo Viejo.  This plan is complimentary to and 

considers the commitments made within the other EMPs.  The other operational EMPs 

which are relevant to this Plan are as follows: 

• Air Management Plan; 
• Archaeology Management Plan; 
• Cyanide Management Plan; 
• El Llagal Greenbelt Management Plan; 
• Hazardous Materials Management Plan; 
• Integrated Pest Management Plan; 
• Soils Management Plan; 
• Vegetation Management Plan; 
• Waste Management Plan; 
• Water Management Plan; and 
• Wildlife and Effects Management Plan. 

 

The design of the Reclamation and Closure Plan considers a number of interrelated 

components.  Among these are legal and other obligations, closure objectives,

environmental and social considerations, technical design criteria, closure assumptions, 

health and safety hazards, and relinquishment conditions.  The Plan has been prepared 

in accordance with the following Barrick environmental standards or guidelines: 

• Barrick Mine Closure Guidelines; 
• Barrick Mine Closure Cost Estimate Guideline; 
• Barrick Social Closure Guidance; 
• Barrick Biodiversity Standard; and 
• Barrick Water Conservation Standard. 

 

The overall, long term post-closure land use objective for the site is to return it to a self-

sustaining condition suitable to support pre-mining land use activities such as small 

scale agriculture, hunting, artisanal forestry. 

 

A number of key issues have been identified with respect to reclamation and closure 

planning, and implementation.  These include: 

• Water management: surface water and seepage from the TSF, water filling the 
pit, and runoff and seepage water from disturbed areas.  Water from some of 
these areas will require treatment prior to discharge for an unknown period of 
time. 
 

• Cover material: Amount of quarry waste material available for closure covers. 
 

• Vegetation: Successful revegetation will help control erosion of valuable soil 
resources, maintain soil productivity and minimize sedimentation in streams. 
 

• Open pits: The pits will fill until the water level reaches the lowest elevation in the 
pit wall when water from the pit will discharge to the Margajita drainage. 
 

• Waste rock: The waste rock will be placed in the TSF away from the dams and 
covered during operations with tailings. 
 

• TSF: Management of residual supernatant and surface water, tailings 
consolidation, and control of seepage from the impoundment. 
 

• Plant site: The majority of the facilities will be decommissioned and removed 
during closure. 
 

• Water treatment: The existing ARD collection and HDS treatment system will 
continue to operate during closure to treat ARD water from the site and additional 
water from the Government Responsibility Areas via the effluent treatment plant. 
In addition, a second water treatment plant will be constructed to treat water from 
the TSF after closure. 
 

• Water Diversion: The diversion canals at El Llagal and from Monte Negro pit to 
ARD Dam 1 will be constructed to convey the peak flow of a 200-year storm

event after which the ditch is expected to partially fail and allow excess water into 
the collection area. 

 

RECLAMATION PLANS 
A conceptual biodiversity program has been developed for the ESIA and PVDC is 

working with others to identify potential biodiversity projects in the region and to 

implement studies and programs that meet the program objectives. The aim is to 

maintain the biodiversity resources and possibly enhance them with funding included in 

the operating costs. 

 

The biodiversity program includes a forest habitat development program for site 

reclamation.  Greenhouse facilities will be provided and the reclamation program will 

include open field trial plots. 

 

PVDC plans to progressively reclaim the mine site as sections of the site become 

available. 

 

BOND 
The Environmental Licence requires a compliance bond of RD$635,250,000 

(approximately US$16,400,000), corresponding to 10% of the cost of the Environmental 

Adjustment and Management Plan (PMAA) of the construction phase.  Once the 

construction phase is completed, PVDC will provide a bond that corresponds to 10% of 

the amount of the updated PMAA defined for the operational phase. At the end of the 

operational phase, PVDC will provide the corresponding bond at 10% of the total amount 

of the PMAA for the closure and post closure phases. 

 

As part of the SLA agreement, PVDC is required to create an Environmental Reserve 

Fund in an offshore escrow account funded at a rate equal to 5% of all operational costs, 

other than costs of concurrent rehabilitation, until the funds are adequate to discharge 

the closure reclamation obligations.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
The Pueblo Viejo Mine is an open pit gold mine in the pre-production phase.  Pre-

production stripping started in August 2010, commissioning of the autoclaves is 

scheduled to start in February 2012, and first gold is scheduled to be poured in mid-

2012.  The major milestones for the Project are as follows. 

 

Power - 103 MW available      Jan 2012 

Autoclave #1 ready for commissioning   Feb 2012 

Ore grinding ready for commissioning   Feb 2012 

Autoclave #2 ready for commissioning  Apr 2012 

Mechanical Completion    Jul 2012 

First gold poured    Mid-2012 

Tailings starter dam complete - 182.5 m  Aug-2012 

First phase of permanent power available  Q4 2012 

 

The open pit capital and operating costs are discussed below. 

 

CAPITAL COSTS 
Current Forecast to Completion capital costs for the Project are estimated to be $3.63 

billion, of which $3.14 billion was committed at the end of December 2011.   

 

The capital cost estimate is shown in Table 21-1.  Total capital costs itemized per year 

for the major categories over the LOM are summarized in Table 21-2.  Expansion capital 

includes $457 million to complete construction and $440 million to complete full power 

requirements. 

 

The original budget, including a $515 million contingency, was $2.96 billion.  The major 

areas over budget in the Forecast to Completion are on-site infrastructure (39% over 

budget) and indirect costs (50% over budget).  Overall, the Project is 23% over budget.  

RPA finds the currently projected Forecast to Completion to be reasonable.

The strategy to mine ore at approximately 2 to 2.5 times the plant feed rate during half 

the LOM, in order to process high grade material and stockpile lower grade material, 

increases revenue, particularly in the first eight years of operation.

Revenue from gold alone is 65% higher when comparing the average grade of 3.40 g/t 

gold during the first eight years of operation with the average LOM grade of 2.64 g/t 

gold.  This offsets the higher capital and operating cost for additional mining equipment 

and more than doubles the mining rate and rehandling of stockpiled material to the 

process plant in the second half of the LOM.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
RPA was provided with the December 2011 updated individual production plans, capital 

forecasts, manpower forecasts, and operating cost forecasts for the Pueblo Viejo open 

pit.  The LOM plan for the open pit provides for mining and processing through to 2047.   

 

The NPV for Pueblo Viejo is based on revenue and costs from the open pit between 

2012 and 2047.  A discount rate of 5% has been used by Barrick.  In RPA's opinion, this 

is a low ratio for a developing project. 

 

From the information provided, RPA prepared a pre-tax cash flow analysis, which is 

presented in Table 22-1.  A summary of the key criteria is provided below.   

 

ECONOMIC CRITERIA 
REVENUE  

• Average 15.4 M tpa mined from 2012 to 2029 in Monte Negro and Moore pits 
sent to process plant and stockpiles. 

• 8.8 M tpa process plant feed from 2012 to 2047.  
• All ore to plant supplied from stockpiles after 2029. 
• Average gold head grade of 2.64 g/t and recovery of 92.1% for LOM. 
• Average gold head grade of 4.30 g/t between 2012 and 2019. 
• Average silver head grade of 16.6 g/t and recovery of 87.6%.  
• Average head grade of 0.10% Cu and recovery of 79.4%. 
• For the LOM, the gold price is $1,200 per ounce, silver is $20 per ounce, and 

copper is $2.75/lb. 
• Revenue is recognized at the time of production.  

 
COSTS 

• Mine life from 2012 through to 2047, including closure. 
• Capital cost totals $5,730 million for the period 2012 to 2047, including $457 

million to be committed before completion of construction and $1,367 million for 
sustaining capital.  

• Average operating cost over the mine life of $50.18 per tonne milled.  
• Royalty of 3.2% is payable to the Government of the Dominican Republic over 

revenues minus freight and refining charges. 
• Net Profit Interest (NPI) is 28.75% of net profits, payable to the Government of 

the Dominican Republic, which is charged after the Project, including the full cost 
of construction capital, has achieved a 10% IRR.  The NPI is discounted to 2008 
dollars at a 10% discount rate. 

• Average cash cost (minus Ag and Cu revenue) of $467 per ounce Au. 
• Average capital cost of $246 per ounce. 
• Total production cost of $713 per ounce Au sold.

CASH FLOW AND PROJECT ECONOMICS 
Considering the Pueblo Viejo Mine on a stand-alone basis, excluding sunk cost of $3.17 

billion, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $10.1 billion over the mine life.  The 

annual cash flow is positive in all years through the end of the mine production in 2041.  

The pre-tax NPV at a 5% discount rate starting in 2012 and excluding sunk cost is $4.2 

billion and IRR is 39%.  Simple payback occurs in the second quarter of 2015, or 34 

months from the start of production.   

 

If full capital expenditure of $3.63 billion for construction is included, the cash flow drops 

to $7.3 billion, the pre-tax NPV at a 5% discount rate to $1.7 billion, the IRR to 9.1% and 

payback occurs near the midpoint of 2022.  

 

The Total Cash Cost is $467 per ounce of gold, calculated by subtracting silver and 

copper revenue from the cash cost.  The mine life capital unit cost is $246 per ounce of 

gold, for a Total Production Cost of $713 per ounce of gold.  Average annual gold 

production during operation is 666,200 ounces per year. 

 

RPA notes that the economic analysis confirms that the material classified as Mineral 

Reserves is supported by a positive economic analysis. 

 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic 

risks were examined by running cash flow sensitivities:  

• Metal prices, metallurgical recovery, and head grade  

• Operating costs (Total Direct Operating Cost) 

• Capital costs 

 

The sensitivity of the NPV at 5% over the base case has been calculated for -20% to 

+20% variations.  The revenue for gold is proportional to the product of price times head 

grade times metallurgical recovery.  Therefore, the metal sensitivity is shown as a single 

item where the change in the variable is the sum of the changes to the price, 

metallurgical recovery, and head grade.  The sensitivities for the base case are shown in 

Figure 22-1 and Table 22-2.  The NPV is most sensitive to changes in gold, silver and 

copper price/recovery followed by the operating costs and capital costs.  The total cost of

construction is not included in the sensitivity analysis, which explains the lack of 

sensitivity to capital costs. 

 

The 28.75% NPI is highly sensitive to revenue and therefore the metal prices.  Below 

$1,300/oz of gold, no NPI is payable.  The effect of increasing metal prices on the NPI 

can be seen in Figure 22-2 and Table 22-3.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
EnviroGold Limited (EnviroGold), an Australian-based gold producer with Latin American 

operations headquartered in Santo Domingo, is exploiting Pueblo Viejo tailings from the 

Rosario era at Las Lagunas (the Las Lagunas Gold Tailings Project) through its 

subsidiary EnviroGold (Las Laguna) Limited.  The company signed a development 

agreement with the Dominican government in 2004 to reprocess the tailings deposit 

under a profit sharing arrangement.  The project involves the reclamation and 

concentration of gold bearing sulphides through flotation, followed by sulphide oxidation 

using the Albion Process Technology, prior to extraction of gold and silver using 

standard CIL cyanidation. 

 

EnviroGold expects to complete construction of the Albion/CIL plant in Q4 2011 and 

commence tailings reprocessing in April 2012 at a rate of 65,000 oz/yr gold and 600,000 

oz/yr silver.  The Las Lagunas tailings dam has a JORC Inferred Resource of 5.137 Mt 

of tailings at 3.8 g/t Au and 38.6 g/t Ag.  The company estimates production costs at 

US$312/oz gold-equivalent, with a target project life of 6.5 years (EnviroGold, 2011). 

 

At the completion of the project, the property is to become the responsibility of the 

Dominican government and no liability should impact on PVDC.  However, because of 

the location immediately next to PVDC's operations, there is some risk that PVDC may 

become involved.  RPA does not believe that any involvement would represent a 

material risk. 

 

There are two additional mining operations in the general vicinity of the Pueblo Viejo 

Project: 

• Falcondo Nickel Project, operated by Xstrata Nickel, located approximately 15 
km from the Pueblo Viejo Project, and 
 

• Cerro de Maimon Copper-Gold Project, operated by Globestar Mining, also 
located approximately 15 km away. 

 

Neither project impacts materially on the Pueblo Viejo Project.

Rev. 0 Page 25-1 

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Based on RPA's site visit, interviews with Pueblo Viejo personnel and subsequent review 

of gathered information, RPA offers the following conclusions: 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

• The Pueblo Viejo deposits are high sulphidation, quartz-alunite epithermal gold 
and silver deposits. 

 
• The sampling, sample preparation, analyses, and sample security are 

appropriate for the style of mineralization and Mineral Resource estimation. 
 

• The EOY2011 Mineral Resource estimates are competently completed to 
industry standards using reasonable and appropriate parameters and are 
acceptable for use in Mineral Reserve estimation.  The resource estimates 
conform to NI 43-101.   

 
• Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves and are estimated 

effective December 31, 2011. 
 
• On a 100% basis, Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 181.73 Mt, 

grading 1.88 g/t Au, 10.43 g/t Ag, and 0.08% Cu, containing 11.0 Moz Au, 60.9 
Moz Ag, and 340 Mlbs Cu. 

 
• On a 100% basis, Inferred Mineral Resources total 22.6 Mt, grading 1.61 g/t Au, 

12.76 g/t Ag, and 0.08% Cu, containing, containing 1.2 Moz Au, 9.3 Moz Ag, and 
38.4 Mlbs Cu. 

 

MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• On a 100% basis, open pit Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves total 285.4 
million tons grading 2.8 g/t Au, 17.5 g/t Ag, and 0.09% Cu containing 25.3 million 
oz Au, 160.2 million oz Ag, and 590.5 million pounds Cu.  

 
• The Pueblo Viejo Mineral Reserves stated for the EOY2011 meet Canadian NI 

43-101 requirements to be classified as Mineral Reserves. 
 

• Mining planning for the Pueblo Viejo open pit mine follows industry standards. 
 

• In RPA's opinion, the methodology used by PVDC for pit limit determination, cut-
off grade optimization, production sequence and scheduling, and estimation of 
equipment/manpower requirements is in line with good industry practice.

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURICAL TESTING 

• RPA is of the opinion that the metallurgical testwork is adequate to support the 
Project and that the recovery models are reasonable.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
RPA recommends that: 
 

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

• The Measured classification be defined by 40% to 50% of the variogram sill and 
requires at least one composite from two drill holes. 

   

MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• Sulphur grades be reported in the LOM and sulphur received in the processing 
plant be reconciled with reserve sulphur grades.  Monitor the effectiveness of the 
sulphur decay in the stockpiles and adjust stockpile design if the required rate of 
decay is not achieved.
