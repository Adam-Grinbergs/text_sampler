Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 1 

 

1.0 SUMMARY 
 

Martin Taylor, P. Geo., was retained by Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Corporation ("Tanzanian 

Royalty") in June 2009 to prepare a technical report to the standards of NI 43-101 on their 

Kibara mineral property in the United Republic of Tanzania.  The author is familiar with gold 

exploration in Tanzania, having spent 8 years working there in that regard in 1999-2009, and 

visited the Kibara property in July 2009. 

 

Tanzanian Royalty is a publicly-traded financial gold company whose business strategy is to 

acquire royalty interests in gold production from its core assets in the Lake Victoria Goldfields 

of Tanzania.  As of December 31, 2008, the company had 88,793,958 common shares issued and 

outstanding.  Tanzanian Royalty's head office is in South Surrey, British Columbia, Canada and 

it trades on the TSX Exchange under the symbol TNX and on the AMEX as TRE.  The company 

operates in Tanzania through two wholly-owned, Tanzanian-registered companies, TANCAN 

Mining Company Ltd. and Tanzam 2000 Ltd. 

 

The Kibara Project is at an early exploration stage and consists of 6 granted Prospecting 

Licences plus 5 approved applications covering a total area of approximately 375.91 km².  The 

property is located in northern Tanzania within the Musoma-Mara Greenstone Belt, towards the 

western end of a large peninsula extending into Lake Victoria from its eastern shore.  Kibara lies 

145 km southwest of the North Mara gold mine of Barrick Gold Corp. The large village of 

Kibara lies to the south of the property on the gravel road linking the village of Nansio on 

Ukerewe Island with Bunda on the paved highway between Mwanza and Kenya.   

 

The Archaean Tanzanian Craton and its surrounding Proterozoic mobile belts underlie much of 

the Central Plateau of Tanzania.  Tertiary volcanics of mafic to intermediate composition occur 

primarily in the Kilimanjaro and Eastern Rift areas in the north. The producing gold mines of the 

Lake Victoria Goldfields are hosted within a series of Archaean greenstone belts, similar in age, 

lithologies and mineralization to the Abitibi Belt of northern Ontario and Quebec.  These east-

trending linear greenstone belts are separated by granite-gneiss terranes.  Tanzania is the 3
rd

 

largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa and Ghana.  This has been achieved with the 

opening of five open-pit mines (Golden Pride, Geita, North Mara, Tulawaka and Buzwagi) and 

one major underground mine (Bulyanhulu) in recent years.  Mining of gold from bedrock 

deposits around Lake Victoria was recorded as early as 1898 and continued intermittently on a 

limited scale into the 1970s in the Mara, Musoma, Serengeti, Iramba Plateau and Geita areas.  

Some mineralized zones are sub-parallel to lithologic layering in the greenstones, and others cut 

across layering, especially in the more competent units.  Dilational openings along shear zones 

are common hosts for the mineralization, which is often open space filling. 

  

The bedrock lithologies at Kibara are dominated by Nyanzian-age (Archaean) mafic volcanics, 

intruded by granites.  Tanzanian Royalty commenced exploration on the Kibara Project in 2002 

with mini-BLEG sampling in the precursor to PL 2308/2003.  This was followed by rock and 

termite mound sampling to validate BLEG anomalies and then by trenching, biogeochemical 

(BGC) sampling and gradient IP surveys.  The other licences were covered with BGC sampling, 

mapping and chip sampling and limited auger soil follow-up.  None of the geochemical or other 

targets throughout the Kibara Project have yet been tested with any form of drilling.

The trenching on Nyakona Hill in PL 2308/2003 exposed a gossanous quartz vein with up to 

40% malachite in a felsic tuff/feldspar porphyry package.  Neither the later soil sampling nor IP 

gradient survey were able to confirm the extent of the mineralization beyond the 160 m of strike 

shown in the trenches.  This mineralization, however, with gold values up to 14.80 g/t Au and 

copper up to 29.15 % Cu, constitutes the principal target on the property for follow-up with 

RAB/RC drilling.  On PL 2785/2004 grab samples from muck piles at an abandoned artisanal 

mining site confirmed the presence of gold mineralization with values up to 18.75 g/t Au.  Soil 

and BGC sampling did not detect a significant gold anomaly around the artisanal workings, but a 

gradient IP grid did reveal a chargeability anomaly.  On PLs 2931/2004, 3146/2005 and 

3314/2005 scattered BGC gold anomalies were detected.  The strongest ones were followed up 

with auger soil sampling, but no BGC anomalies were confirmed. 
 

Initial preparation of soil samples was done by Tanzanian Royalty at their own facility in 

Mwanza.  All other preparation and analysis was carried out at internationally-recognized 

laboratories with ISO certification.  The quality-control programs implemented by Tanzanian 

Royalty conform to industry standards and show that the sampling procedures and analyses 

received were acceptable.  The author is of the opinion that the programs were carried out in a 

professional manner, to industry-standard procedures. 

 

The favourable lithogies and presence of significant gold mineralization in trenches on Nyakona 

Hill in PL 2308/2003 and in artisanal gold workings in PL 2785/2004 make those two areas in 

the Kibara Project targets for initial RAB/RC drilling.  The objectives would be to confirm the 

existence at depth of gold/copper-in-quartz mineralization sampled in the trenches at Nyakona 

Hill and to extend the gold mineralization in the artisanal workings.  This should be done with 

lines of heel-to-toe RAB or RC drilling, possibly preceded by additional trenching on Nyakona 

Hill to extend the surface strike of the mineralization.  If the Phase I RAB/RC program provides 

suitable confirmation of mineralization and significant intersections at either or both target areas, 

the next phase should consist of additional RC drilling to expand the mineralization from Phase I 

along strike and to depth.

In the author's opinion, the character of the Kibara Property and its current stage of exploration 

are of sufficient merit to justify the nature and scale of the programs outlined above. The budgets 

are considered appropriate by the author.

2.0 INTRODUCTION and TERMS of REFERENCE 
 

Martin Taylor, P. Geo., was retained by Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Corporation ("Tanzanian 

Royalty") in June 2009 to prepare a technical report to the standards of National Instrument 43-

101 on the Kibara mineral property in the United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania) in which 

Tanzanian Royalty holds an interest.  Mr. Taylor visited the property in July 2009.  The author is 

aware that Tanzanian Royalty may use this report in support of future fundraising efforts, or as 

required for other purposes by the TSX Exchange and the relevant provincial Securities 

Commissions.  

 

In writing this report the author relied on corporate and extensive property data provided by 

Tanzanian Royalty, his observations in the field, his knowledge of Tanzania and its geology 

obtained from his many visits, and public information from his own files and websites of other 

companies operating in Tanzania.  Government of Tanzania reports and maps, and other relevant 

reports, papers and data in the public domain were also examined.  All available data on 

Tanzanian Royalty's Kibara property was reviewed in Toronto, including reports on recent 

exploration programs.  Copies were examined in Toronto of the original licence documents for 

each of the Prospecting Licences.   

 

All of the licence documents issued by the Minerals Development Division of Tanzania and 

examined by the author appear to be in order.  Although the author is familiar with both the 

procedure of acquiring Prospecting Licences in Tanzania and the nature of the relevant 

documents pertaining to them, as a Professional Geoscientist he is not qualified to give a formal 

legal opinion on the validity of the licence or agreement documents and takes no responsibility 

for any errors or omissions within said documents that might affect Tanzanian Royalty's title or 

interest in the properties.   

 

Recommendations for a phased exploration program together with budgets were prepared by Mr. 

Taylor, the latter in consultation with the management of Tanzanian Royalty.  These programs 

reflect the minimum work considered appropriate to advance or evaluate the properties rather 

than what is merely required to maintain the properties in good standing.

3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 

The Kibara mineral property in which Tanzanian Royalty holds an interest and described in this 

report is located within the United Republic of Tanzania, in East Africa.  The following section 

(3.1) provides background information on Tanzania. 

 

3.1 The United Republic of Tanzania 

 

Tanzania covers a total area of 945,087 sq. km between longitudes 29°E - 41°E and latitudes 1°S 

- 12°S.  It is bounded on the north by Kenya and Uganda, on the east by the Indian Ocean, on the 

south by Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, and on the west by The Democratic Republic of 

Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda (Figure 1).  Three of Africa's largest lakes, Victoria in the north, 

Tanganyika in the west, and Nyasa in the south, lie within Tanzania.  Mount Kilimanjaro 

(5,895m) in northern Tanzania is the highest point on the African continent. 

 

The original hunter-gatherers in Tanzania were absorbed by successive pastoralist migrants from 

the north and west, especially in the 15
th

 and 16
th

 centuries.  Coastal Tanzania included important 

trading posts as early as 400 BC, and permanent settlements were established in the early 

centuries AD by Phoenician and later Arab and Persian traders.  Intermixing of these traders with 

the indigenous Bantu speakers giving rise to the development of the Swahili language.  Islam 

was introduced from Arabia and was dominant by the 11
th

 century.  Portuguese explorers 

reached the Tanzanian coast by the beginning of the 16
th

 century, and controlled trade from 1525 

until the early 1700s when local control was re-established.  Omani Arab influence was growing, 

however, and soon came to dominate all trade, including that of slaves.  European explorers 

began to penetrate the interior in the mid-19
th

 century, culminating with a British Protectorate 

being established over Zanzibar, and most of what is now mainland Tanzania being administered 

as German East Africa.  After WWI the mainland was administered by Britain under a League of 

Nations mandate and renamed Tanganyika.  The country achieved independence on December 9, 

1961, and became a republic one year later.  Zanzibar achieved independence in December 1963 

and the two countries merged on April 26, 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanganyika 

(renamed the United Republic of Tanzania in October 1965).  

 

Julius Nyerere became prime minister of Tanganyika on Independence in 1961 and president in 

1962 with the adoption of a republican constitution.  In 1977 a new party (CCM) was formed by 

merging the dominant parties of the mainland and Zanzibar, ruling a one-party state until 1995 

when opposition parties were legalized.  Jakaya Kikwete of the CCM won the 2005 election and 

continues as President in 2009. 

 

Tanzania is divided into 27 administrative regions, each headed by a Regional Commissioner 

and subdivided into districts administered by a District Commissioner.  Twenty-one of the 

regions cover the mainland, comprising a total of 86 districts.  Tanzania's population is estimated 

at about 35 million, 95% of Bantu origin.  The largest tribal group, the Sukuma, comprises about 

13% of the population with the balance made up of about 120 smaller tribal groups.

The main urban centres are Dar es Salaam, the largest city and port on the Indian Ocean, 

commercial capital and seat of government with a population of about 3 million; Dodoma, the 

appointed capital, where some government offices are located; Mwanza, a major city and the 

principal port on the south shore of Lake Victoria; Tanga, an industrial centre and the second 

seaport; Mbeya in the southwest and Arusha in the north.  Roughly one third of Tanzanians are 

Moslem, another third Christian with most of the remainder following traditional beliefs.  

Swahili and English are the official languages, the former being the most important universal 

language amongst Tanzania's ethnic groups and Arabic is widely spoken in Zanzibar.  

Tanzania's legal system is based on English common law.  The currency is the Tanzanian 

shilling, Tshs 1,330=US$1.00 in May 2009.  Since the liberalization of the financial sector in the 

1990s, many private foreign and local banks now operate in the country, as well as numerous 

Bureaux de Change. 

 

Tanzania is one of the least urbanised countries in sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture providing 

some 60% of GDP in 2007 and employing about 80% of the workforce.  Major commercial 

crops include coffee, tea, cotton, cashews, sisal and cloves.  Tourism plays an important role, 

especially in the game parks in the north of the country.  Industry accounts for 17% of GDP and 

is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light consumer goods.  Mining is 

becoming increasingly important to the Tanzanian economy, especially with the opening of the 

major Geita (Anglogold/Ashanti), Bulyanhulu (Barrick) gold mines in 2000 and 2001, plus 

North Mara (Barrick) and Buzwagi (Barrick) in 2005 and 2009.  Gold sales comprised about 

86% of the total mineral exports of about US$886.5 million in 2007, with the balance coming 

mainly from diamonds and other precious stones.   

 

The Mineral Resources Department (MRD) is an integral part of the Ministry of Energy and 

Minerals and consists of the Mines and Minerals Development Divisions.  The MRD is based in 

Dar es Salaam, with zonal offices in Mwanza, Arusha, Shinyanga, Mpanda, Morogoro, Mbeya, 

Mtwara and Singida.  The Mines Division is responsible for health and safety standards in mines, 

enforcement of environmental regulations and standards, production statistics and services to 

mineral producers, particularly to small scale miners.  The Minerals Development Division 

issues mineral licences, maintains the mineral rights registry and the mineral occurrence database 

and archive, and is responsible for mineral sector promotion and review of minerals policy. 

 

The Tanzania Geological Survey is an executive agency within the Ministry of Energy and 

Minerals, and consists of the Regional and Engineering Geology, Economic Geology and 

Geophysics, and Laboratory Services and Research Directorates.  The Survey's headquarters are 

in Dodoma and it is responsible for: undertaking reconnaissance mineral exploration and basic 

regional geological mapping of the country; preparation and publication of geological maps, 

reports and drawings; analysis of rocks, soils, water and minerals, and provision of mineral 

processing services; maintenance of mineral resources databases; and investigating and assessing 

earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides etc. 

 

The Government of Tanzania has recognised the importance of the mineral sector in the future 

development of the country.  The revision of the Mining Act in 1998 and the Mining Regulations 

in 1999 were directed at attracting private sector investment in the exploration, mining 

development, mineral beneficiation and marketing of Tanzania's mineral resources.  Details of

the Mining Act and Mining Regulations are included in Appendix I.  The government is also 

focussing on regulation and improvement of the artisanal mining sector, ensuring that revenue 

from mining supports sustainable economic and social development, and minimizing the 

potential adverse social and environmental impacts of mining development through the use of 

best practices and community participation. 

 

Title to minerals in the ground is vested in the United Republic of Tanzania, and no prospecting 

or mining operations can be carried out without the appropriate mineral rights licence granted by 

the government. Of the various levels of licensing available to local companies working in 

mineral exploration (which may be wholly-owned by a foreign company such as Tanzanian 

Royalty), almost all companies work under a Prospecting Licence in the exploration stage and a 

Mining Licence in the exploitation stage.  A Prospecting Licence grants exclusive exploration 

rights over an area not exceeding 200 km² for a period of three years, after which the licence may 

be renewed for two 2-year periods with a 50% reduction in area for each extension.  Required 

work expenditures and land fees per sq. km increase with each renewal. Annual work 

expenditures are US$300/km² for the initial 3-year period, increasing to US$1,000/km² and 

US$3,000/km² for each successive 2-year period.  Annual land rents are US$20/km² for the 

initial 3-year period, increasing to US$30/km² and US$50/km² for each successive 2-year period.  

A Mining Licence can be granted for a period not exceeding 10 years, renewable for a period of 

up to 10 years, on presentation of a suitable feasibility study, environmental impact study and 

employment plan.  

 

The mining taxation, fiscal and legal frameworks were designed to attract investors to the mining 

industry through a stable and internationally competitive regime.  In the Investment Act of 1997 

Tanzania recognises the investor's need to recover exploration and development costs, to achieve 

a rate of return commensurate with risk, to repatriate dividends and to meet financial obligations 

with creditors and suppliers.  The 1998 Mining Act and Regulations are also designed to deter 

hoarding of data on new discoveries and speculative freezing of exploration lands.  The State 

does not participate directly in exploration or mining operations.  Royalties payable to the 

government are 3% of net-back value for minerals, and 5% of net-back value for diamonds. 

 

3.2 Description of Kibara Property 

 
The Kibara property is located in northern Tanzania within the Musoma-Mara Greenstone Belt, 

towards the western end of a large peninsula extending into Lake Victoria from its eastern shore.  

The property is bounded to the north by Baumann Gulf and the south by Speke Gulf.   

 

The large village of Kibara lies to the south of the property on the gravel road linking the village 

of Nansio on Ukerewe Island with Bunda on the paved highway between Mwanza and Kenya.  

The town of Bunda serves as the headquarters for the Bunda District with the offices of the 

District Commissioner and the District Courthouse.

Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 9 

 

The Kibara property originally comprised four Prospecting Licences, PLs 2308/2003, 

2785/2004, 2931/2005 and 3146/2005, with the additional sliver of PL 3314/2005 added between 

2308/2003 and 2931/2004.  On September 1, 2003, Tanzania American International 

Development Corporation 2000 ("Tanzam 2000") (a Tanzanian subsidiary of Tan Range, which 

is now Tanzanian Royalty) signed an option agreement with the licence holder of PL 2308/2003, 

Eb-Hance Company Limited ("Eb-Hance"), whereby Tanzam 2000 could acquire 90% of Eb-

Hance's interest in the property by making cash payments and exploration expenditures.  All 

required payments and expenditures have been made and Tanzanian Royalty, through its wholly-

owned Tanzanian subsidiary Tanzam 2000, now owns 90% of the property covered by PL 

2308/2003 and its subsequent splits. 

 

On September 28, 2004, Tanzam 2000 entered into an option agreement with Givex Company 

Limited ("Givex"), the holders of PL 2785/2004, whereby Tanzam 2000 could acquire 90% of 

Givex's interest by making cash payments and exploration expenditures.  All required payments 

and expenditures have been made and Tanzanian Royalty, through its wholly-owned Tanzanian 

subsidiary Tanzam 2000, now owns 90% of the property covered by PL 2785/2004 and its 

subsequent split. 

 

On April 18, 2005, Tanzam 2000 entered into an option agreement with Fadhili D. Mbaga, the 

holder of PL 2931/2004, whereby Tanzam 2000 could acquire 85% of Mr. Mbaga's interest by 

making cash payments and exploration expenditures.  All required payments and expenditures 

have been made and Tanzanian Royalty, through its wholly-owned Tanzanian subsidiary 

Tanzam 2000, now owns 85% of the property covered by PL 2931/2004 and its subsequent split. 

. 

Also on April 18, 2005, Tanzam 2000 entered into an option agreement with A.P. Mdabwa and 

T. Yusufu, the holders of PL 3146/2005, whereby Tanzam 2000 could acquire 90% of 

Mdabwa/Yusufu's interest by making cash payments and exploration expenditures.  All required 

payments and expenditures have been made and Tanzanian Royalty, through its wholly-owned 

Tanzanian subsidiary Tanzam 2000, now owns 90% of the property covered by PL 3146/2005 

and its subsequent split. 

 

Renewals and divisions of the four original optioned licences plus PL 3314/2005 have resulted in 

the property now consisting of 6 Prospecting Licences and 5 application areas covering an area 

of approximately 375.91 km².  

 

All of the 11 sectors of the Kibara property have valid Prospecting Licences granted or, as in the 

case of the application areas, the acquisition of a new Prospecting Licence is in progress.  Due to 

a serious administrative backlog in the Minerals Development Division, applications accepted as 

far back as February 2008 have still not had their licences granted, nor have the letters of offer 

(the last step before the actual licence grant) been received.  Copies of the original documents for 

the six granted Prospecting Licences were verified by the author in June 2009, as were those for 

the five pending applications accepted by the Ministry.  These documents show accepted 

payment of annual land rents for the PLs and application fees plus the dated stamp of acceptance 

by the Ministry for the application areas. 

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 10 

 

None of the exploration licences on the Kibara Project have been legally surveyed.  This is not a 

requirement of the 1998 Mining Act where Prospecting Licences are issued with a list of the 

latitude and longitude coordinates of the corners.  Licence holders are, however, required to 

mark each corner with a post and a short ditch pointing to the next post.  This will be attended to, 

using GPS control, as part of future exploration programs.  As far as is known, none of the 

Prospecting Licences in the Kibara property are subject to any environmental liabilities. 

 

Prospecting Licences, under the 1998 Mining Act, are issued for an initial period of 3 years, 

renewable for two 2-year periods with a reduction in area of 50% in each case.  Annual land 

rental fees are charged per square kilometre of the licence and minimum exploration 

expenditures are calculated on the same basis.  Both land fees and exploration expenditures 

increase per sq. km with each renewal of a licence. The turn-around time for renewals and 

applications at the Ministry of Energy and Minerals is currently between 6 and 24 months.  For 

both processes a Letter of Offer is first received from the Ministry.  This letter, or notice of grant, 

notifies the applicant that the renewal or licence will be granted providing the applicant confirms 

acceptance of the description of the property; gives notice within 28 days of willingness to 

accept the proposed licence; and pays the required preparation fee.  Once the licence fee has 

been paid the applicant is effectively guaranteed that the renewal or licence will be granted.  

Typically at least more three months will lapse before the actual grant of the renewal or new 

licence.   

 

In the case of renewal of an existing licence the applicant may commence work on the ground 

once the Letter of Offer has been received.  For new licence applications, however, exploration 

can only commence once the new licence has actually been granted.

4.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE   

AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

4.1 Introduction 

 

Most of mainland Tanzania consists of a central plateau from 900-1,800 metres above sea level 

(averaging about 1,200 m), rising gently from a fertile coastal belt that is about 15-65 km wide.  

The western arm of the Great Rift Valley runs down the west side of the plateau and contains 

Lakes Tanganyika and Nyasa, while the eastern arm cuts through the central part of the plateau.  

The Lake Victoria basin lies in the northwest of the country between the arms of the rift valley.  

The principal mountain ranges are the Eastern Arc, in the northeast of the country, the Southern 

Highlands in the southwest, and the volcanic mountains in the north (Mt. Kilimanjaro, 5,896m, 

Mt. Meru, 4,566 m, and the Crater Highlands including Ngorongoro and Oldoinyo Lengai).  The 

interior plateau is covered by dry thorn scrub, savannah grasslands and a variety of deciduous 

woodlands and forests.  About 30% of the country, mainly in the south and west, is covered by 

miombo woodland.  The largest river is the Rufiji, draining from the Southern Highlands to the 

Indian Ocean and including much of southern Tanzania in its catchment. 

 

The Zanzibar archipelago, including the principal coral island of Unguja (1,650 sq. km) lies 

about 40 km from the mainland.  Pemba, about 984 sq. km, lies 50 km east of the mainland and 

50 km northeast of Unguja. 

 

Tanzania's climate varies markedly with its topography.  There are four main climatic zones: the 

hot, humid coastal plain with average temperatures of 27-29ºC and maximums of 29-34ºC; the 

hot, semi-arid central plateau where maximum daytime temperatures average 20-27ºC from June 

through August and 29-32C from December to March; the high-moist lake regions; and the 

temperate highland areas.  Throughout the country there are two rainy seasons, the long rains 

from mid-March through May, and the short rains which fall primarily in November and 

December.  Much of central Tanzania is semi-arid with less than 500 mm of rain per year, 

though the western part of the plateau is generally moister.  In the Lake Victoria basin, especially 

west of the lake, annual rainfall usually exceeds 800 mm. The mountains in the northeast and 

southwest may receive over 2,000 mm annually, while rainfall on the coast ranges between 1,000 

and 1,900 mm.  

 

Tanzania has an extensive network of over 88,000 km of classified roads, most of which are 

unpaved away from the main routes from Dar es Salaam to Arusha, Tanga, Mbeya and Dodoma.  

A paved road that has particular importance for access to the area southwest of Lake Victoria 

runs south from Mwanza through Shinyanga and Kahama and west to the Burundi border.  The 

Government is working to upgrade and maintain roads, especially to improve access for major 

agricultural, tourism and mining areas.  Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) runs passenger 

and cargo services on a 1.067 m gauge line from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza on Lake Victoria, 

Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika, and from Tanga to Moshi and Arusha.  The Tanzania-Zambia 

Railway Authority (TAZARA) operates a standard gauge line between Dar es Salaam and Kapiri 

Mposhi in Zambia via Mbeya.   

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 20 

 

Tanzania has three major ports on the Indian Ocean, Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara.  An 

alternative route for large freight shipments to the Lake Victoria area is through the port of 

Mombasa in Kenya and then along good roads to Mwanza. The principal ports on Lake Victoria 

are Mwanza and Bukoba, while Kigoma handles most of the trade on Lake Tanganyika.  Major 

airports at Dar es Salaam (DIA), Kilimanjaro (KIA), and Zanzibar (ZIA) are served by many 

international airlines.  Domestic scheduled and charter flights connect the major centres, 

especially Mwanza which can handle jet aircraft, and utilize over 50 local airports and airstrips.  

 

Domestic and international telephone and facsimile services are provided by the Tanzania 

Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL).  The system is fair, operating below capacity 

and being modernized for better service.  Five private companies provide good cellular service in 

the main population centres and along major roads, with adequate reception over much of the 

area around Lake Victoria.  Internet cafés are now available in the cities and most towns. 

 

4.2 Kibara Project 
 

The Kibara Project consists of six Prospecting Licences and five application areas covering a 

contiguous area of 375.91 km² on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria in northern Tanzania.  The 

area typically has two rainy seasons, the "small rains" from mid-November through December 

and the "big rains" from mid-March into May, though significant rain often falls in January and 

February.  The months of June through October are usually dry, with occasional thunderstorms.  

Annual rainfall averages 750-900 mm.  Access along the dirt tracks within the PLs may be 

impaired directly after heavy rainfall, though exploration activities should not be seriously 

affected during a normal rainy season unless access is required across areas of mbuga soils. 

 

The property is centred approximately 50 km west of the district headquarters in Bunda.  

Principal access is north to Bunda from Mwanza on the paved highway that continues to Nairobi 

in Kenya.  From Bunda a graded gravel road extends west to Nansio on Ukerewe Island in Lake 

Victoria, passing through the southern edge of the Kibara property.  Various minor roads and dirt 

tracks provide good access across the property.  The large village of Kibara is located on the 

Bunda-Nansio road just south of the centre of the property.  Small villages, hamlets and farms 

are scattered throughout the property.  Fishing on Lake Victoria is the principal activity of the 

communities around the lake shore. 

 

The project area covers much of the western part of the Mwibare Peninsula extending into Lake 

Victoria, between Speke Gulf to the south and Baumann Gulf to the north.  Much of the property 

is gently rolling hills below 1,200 m asl, with some of the intervening low-lying areas covered 

with mbuga soils.  Sediments from Lake Victoria cover the lower areas around the shore.  The 

Kurwirwi Hills in the western part of HQ-P17392 are underlain by greenstones and reach an 

altitude of 1,605 m asl.  Their northern extension into PL 2308/2003 includes Mwigundu Hill at 

1,309 m and Nyakona Hill at 1,292 m asl.  The northwest corner of PL 2785/2004 includes part 

of the granitic Iramba Hills, reaching 1,407 m asl.  The isolated granitic Neruma Hill in the 

southwest corner of PL 3146/2005 reaches 1,354 m asl.

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 

6.1 Introduction to the Geology of Tanzania  

 

The Archaean Tanzanian Craton and its surrounding Proterozoic mobile belts underlie much of 

the Central Plateau of Tanzania.  The craton is bounded to the east by the polymetamorphic 

Mozambique Belt, to the southwest by the Ubendian Belt and to the northwest by the Karagwe-

Ankolean System.  Continentally-derived sediments of Mesoproterozoic and younger age cover 

part of the craton, especially in the east.  Tertiary mafic to intermediate volcanics including 

carbonatites occur mainly in the Kilimanjaro and Eastern Rift areas of the north of the country.

Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 26 

 

Tanzania is now the third-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa and Ghana.  This 

has been achieved with the opening of three major open-pit mines (Golden Pride, Geita and 

North Mara) and one major underground mine (Bulyanhulu) in recent years.  These mines are all 

within the Nyanzian greenstone belts in the Lake Victoria Goldfields.  Diamonds are produced 

from kimberlites within the Archaean craton, principally from the Williamson Mine at Mwadui. 

Other gemstones, especially tanzanite (a blue zoisite), are produced from gneisses of the 

Usagaran mobile belt.  A major undeveloped resource is the nickel sulphide deposit at Kabanga; 

where close to 1 million tonnes of contained nickel has been outlined.  The general geology of 

Tanzania is shown in Figure 6.1, and the stratigraphic table in Figure 6.2. 

 

6.1.1 Archaean 

 

The oldest rocks of the craton are highly metamorphosed and migmatized sediments and 

minor igneous rocks of the Dodoman System, forming a band across the central part of 

the craton.  These rocks are predominantly gneissic sediments, granites, schists and 

migmatites, with minor quartzites and amphibolites occurring in the southern part.  The 

main part of the Archaean craton comprises migmatites, biotite gneisses, gneissic granites 

and local massifs of biotite granites, and includes the Nyanzian greenstone belts to the 

south and east of Lake Victoria.  These greenstone belts host the major gold deposits in 

Tanzania and are the principal focus of current exploration. 

 

The greenstones of the Nyanzian System can be divided into a Lower Series of 

dominantly mafic volcanics and associated sediments that include banded iron-formation, 

cherts, shale and conglomerate, and an Upper Series characterized by felsic volcanics, 

cherts and banded iron-formation.  The greenstones are generally metamorphosed to 

lower to middle greenschist facies, locally to almandine amphibolite facies.  They are 

commonly folded about steeply dipping axial planes, generally striking east-west.   

 

The Nyanzian is unconformably overlain (locally) by conglomerates, arkoses and 

quartzites of the Kavirondian System.  These rocks appear to have been derived, at least 

in part, from the Nyanzian and contain clasts of all Nyanzian lithologies, some apparently 

deformed.  A major period of granitoid emplacement followed the Kavirondian, and was 

followed in turn by major tectonic deformation.  

 

Syntectonic granitoids have been dated at 2450-2500 Ma while some unfoliated 

granitoids may be post-tectonic. Many hypabyssal intrusives cut these Archaean 

sequences, including feldspar-porphyries and lamprophyres.  Abundant younger dykes 

are related to Mesozoic and Tertiary tectonic events.  The ages of the granite-gneiss 

terranes surrounding the greenstones are confusing, with the structural relationships not 

clearly understood.  Some granites are discordant and intrusive; others display 

conformable contacts with the greenstones, though most are of indeterminate affinity.  

Both Proterozoic and Archaean ages have been obtained from the granite-gneiss terranes 

and it is locally difficult to distinguish the two components. 

 

 

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 27 

 

6.1.2 Proterozoic 

 

The NW-trending Paleoproterozoic Ubendian ductile shear belt occurs on the southwest 

side of the Archaean craton and consists of a variety of medium to high-grade 

metamorphic rocks, much of which are reworked Archaean.  Gneisses and schists 

predominate with minor amphibolites and marbles, and late granitoids along the 

craton/belt boundaries.  The metamorphic grade is mostly almandine-amphibolite, locally 

up to granulite, the latter dated to 2.1-2.0 Ga and likely related to the Usagaran orogeny.  

 

The Usagaran tectonic domain, which forms part of the Mozambique Belt on the eastern 

side of the craton, is of similar age to the Ubendian.  It consists mainly of biotite-gneisses 

of pelitic origin and lesser granulites and quartzites.  The structural trends are dominantly 

southwest, but the Neoproterozoic-Palaeozoic Pan-African deformation and granulite 

facies metamorphism has obliterated most of the signature of the older structures and 

metamorphism.  The Usagaran granulites host a variety of gemstone deposits, including 

the unique tanzanite, a blue zoisite. 

 

The Mesoproterozoic Karagwe-Ankolean System forms part of the Kibaran Belt which 

extends from Uganda to Zambia, west of Lake Victoria, including the northwestern edge 

of Tanzania.  The Karagwe-Ankolean is clearly younger than the Ubendian and Usagaran 

and is made up of phyllites, quartzites and sericitic schists derived from shallow-water 

sediments.  The Tanzanian part of the belt includes both the Western Internal and the 

Eastern External Domains, their border zone marked by major mafic and granitic 

intrusives of 1250-1275 Ma and post-orogenic tin-bearing granites ~1000 Ma.  The 

Kabanga nickel deposit, on the border with Burundi, is hosted by the feeders to a major 

gabbroic sill. 

 

Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic? sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Bukoban 

System occur in western Tanzania between the Kibaran Belt and the Archaean craton.  

The Bukoban includes sandstone, chert, plateau-type basalts, dolomitic limestones and 

red beds, weakly deformed and unmetamorphosed.  These continental clastic sediments 

were deposited on a peneplain of the Archaean craton and older Proterozoic belts.  

Abundant mafic dykes cut the sequence, predominantly trending north-northeast and 

appear to have been essentially contemporaneous with sedimentation.  Most of the 

Bukoban rocks have subsequently been removed by erosion, but the major outlier in 

western Tanzania includes one formation, the Bukoba Sandstone, which forms part of the 

Eastern External Domain of the Kibaran orogenic zone and may be of Mesoproterozoic 

rather than Neoproterozoic age.  A significant outlier of Bukoban sediments occurs south 

of the Musoma-Mara greenstone belt. 

           

6.1.3 Palaeozoic - Mesozoic 

 

Continental sediments of the Karoo System, named after the type locality in South 

Africa, reach their northern limit in Tanzania.  The Karoo sediments were deposited from 

Late Carboniferous to Jurassic times during a long period of erosion of the Archaean 

highlands, punctuated by episodes of glaciation, volcanism and marine incursions.  The 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 28 

 

Karoo rocks are predominantly coarse sandstones, shales and siltstones with coal, 

unconformably overlying the Precambrian basement in eastern and southeastern 

Tanzania.  North of Dar es Salaam these rocks pass into marine sediments of similar age. 

 

Sediments of Upper Mesozoic age only occur in the coastal basins that were formed 

during the breakup of Gondwana in the Mesozoic.  These sediments include limestone, 

sandstone, shale, marl and local evaporites.  The major rifting commencing at this time 

was accompanied by the intrusion of alkalic rocks (carbonatites, kimberlites, alkali 

syenites) within the Archaean craton and into the Karoo. 

  

6.1.4 Tertiary 

 

The break-up of the eastern part of the African Plate that commenced in the Upper 

Mesozoic accelerated considerably in the late Tertiary.  The East African Rift system 

consists of a series of en echelon grabens, often with associated volcanism.  In Tanzania 

the rifting is primarily along the Western Rift occupied by lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika 

and the Eastern (or Gregory) Rift passing through lakes Natron and Manyara in the north 

to Lake Nyasa.  Subsidiary rifts occur around Lake Rukwa, Lake Eyasi, in the Selous 

Basin and elsewhere.  The Lake Victoria basin is generally interpreted as being formed 

by gentle down-warping between the Western and Eastern Rifts. 

 

The rifts have preserved the Karoo rocks and are locally sites for Tertiary sedimentation.  

The coastal basins contain thick Miocene and younger marine sediments.  The volcanism 

associated with the rifting is mostly intermediate to mafic alkalic, with carbonatite lavas 

continuing to the present day on Oldoinyo Lengai.  Intrusion of kimberlites continued 

into the early Tertiary, with some diamondiferous kimberlites being less than 50 Ma old. 

 

Much of the Archaean craton and surrounding rocks was subject to extensive lateritic 

weathering in the Tertiary.  The resulting ferricretes and saprolites, and their subsequent 

weathering products, are an important focus of mineral exploration efforts in Tanzania 

given the general paucity of outcrop.  Thin lacustrine sediments of proto-Lake Victoria 

locally overlie the Nyanzian and granitoid rocks in the Lake Victoria Basin, between 

about 1,170 m asl and the current lake level of 1,135 m. 

 

6.2 Archaean Greenstone Belts of the Lake Victoria Goldfields 
 

The Lake Victoria Goldfields consists of a number of distinct east-trending linear greenstone 

belts separated by granite-gneiss terranes, together with several inliers or roof pendants of the 

greenstone lithologies within the granite-gneiss.  Recent work, including exploration drilling, has 

shown that some of the greenstones are more extensive than was previously realised. The 

greenstone belts have undergone a varied nomenclature during the history of geological mapping 

in the country.  The nomenclature used in this report is based on that in Hester, B.W., 1998 (ed.), 

Tanzania - Opportunities for Mineral Resource Development.  The outline of the principal 

greenstone belts in the Lake Victoria Goldfields area of Tanzania is shown in Figure 6.3. 

 

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 29 

 

6.2.1 Musoma-Mara Greenstone Belt 

 

The Musoma-Mara Greenstone Belt (Figure 6.4) is the most northerly in Tanzania, from 

just south of the Kenyan border west to (and presumably under) Lake Victoria.  In the 

northern section, termed the Mara Belt, the rocks are predominantly mafic flows and tuffs 

with minor felsic volcanics and banded iron-formation.  These are locally overlain by 

gneisses and schists possibly of Nyanzian age and by Kavirondian molasse sediments 

containing varied clastic fragments of the Nyanzian.  The southern section,   the Musoma 

Belt, has generally similar lithologies though with a higher incidence of felsic flows and 

tuffs and banded iron-formation.  Much of the area around the Mara River, between the 

two sections of the belt, is covered by Quaternary and Tertiary sediments. 

 

 
 

Figure 6.3.  Greenstone Belts of Lake Victoria Goldfields (after Hester, 1998) 

 

The greenstones have been metamorphosed to lower to middle greenschist facies, 

generally of somewhat higher grade in the Mara area.  Fold axes are dominantly east-

northeast, along with other minor trends.  Regional geophysical data indicates that two 

major faults oriented 060° occur between the Mara and Musoma sections, and many of 

the known gold occurrences are closely related to these structures.  A second prominent 

structural direction is at 130°, the most marked expression being the Suguti Shear Zone 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 30 

 

that cuts across and displaces the southern part of the Musoma greenstones.  A similarly-

oriented structure occurs in the eastern part of the Mara area, and may be a significant 

control on the gold mineralization of the North Mara Mine. 

 

Most of the gold deposits in the Mara-Musoma Belt consist of gold associated with pyrite 

and minor base metals in flat to steeply-dipping quartz veins, with carbonatized wall 

rocks, spatially related to the regional faults at 060° and 130°.  Banded iron-formation is 

locally associated with the auriferous quartz veins.  Bedrock gold was first discovered at 

Buhemba in the early 1920's.  The principal mine in the Mara-Musoma Belt is the North 

Mara Mine which is unusual in having a granite host proximal to the greenstones.  North 

Mara was discovered by Afrika Mashariki and put into production by Placer Dome with 

reserves of 4.2 million ounces of gold.  The mine is now owned and operated by Barrick 

Gold Corp. The second largest deposit is Buhemba, northeast of Bunda, with a reported 

production of 12,213 kg of gold between 1927 and 1970.  Kiabakari, northwest of Bunda, 

produced 8,814 kg of gold between 1935-1940 and 1959-1966, the Mara mine produced 

about 2,000 kg of gold from 1932-1970 and the Ikungu mine 587 kg of gold.

6.3 Geology of the Kibara Project 
  

The regional geological mapping published by Barth in 1990 shows the western half of the 

property to be largely underlain by volcanic rocks and the eastern half underlain by granites 

(Figure 6.5).  In February 2009 Tanzanian Royalty prepared a new geological interpretation map 

(Figure 6.6) from the geochemical, regolith, outcrop and satellite image data.  Unfortunately the 

area falls outside the coverage of the government airborne magnetic survey.  This mapping 

confirmed the dominantly granitic eastern half of the area with a raft of mafic volcanics and a 

western half dominated by various greenstone lithologies and minor intrusives.  
 

6.3.1 PL 2308/2003 + HQ-P19022 

 

The licence and application area include five main geological units: mafic flows and tuffs 

on the flanks of Mwigundu Hill and on the north of Nyakona Hill; intermediate tuffs on 

Nyakona Hill; quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusives on the southern part of Nyakona Hill 

and in much of HQ-P19022; granite underlies the southwest corner of PL 2308/2003; and 

Kavirondian conglomerates, grits, lithic sandstones and shales occur on both Nyakona 

and Mwigundi Hills. 

 

Nyakona Hill in the south of the licence trends roughly north-south and includes a 

gossanous quartz vein in a felsic tuff/syenite package that returned 18.75% Cu and 3.33 

g/t Au from one sample.  This vein strikes 115º and dips 70ºS. 

 

On Mwigundu Hill in the north of PL 2308/2003 shales interbedded with laminated 

sandstones and conglomerates outcrop on the upper slopes and chert plus banded iron-

formation occurs on top of the hill.  These rocks strike north-northwest and dip steeply 

west.  Mafic volcanics occur on the lower slopes and presumably underlie the 

Kavirondian sediments. 

 

Within HQ-P19022 a feldspar porphyry/porphyritic dacite outcrops on Nyakongobera, 

Mabiga and Mangire Hills. 

 

 6.3.2 PL 4606/2007 

 

The southern part of the licence was interpreted by Tanzanian Royalty to be underlain by 

mafic volcanics and a syenitic porphyry.  The northern part of the peninsula was 

interpreted as granite while the western part was interpreted to contain mafic volcanics, 

quartz-porphyry and syenite porphyry. 

 

6.3.3 PL 2785/2004 + HQ-P17009 

 

Granite outcrops in the Iramba Hills in the northwest of PL 2785/2004 and on Miramba 

Hill in the southwest of HQ-P17009.  Tanzanian Royalty has interpreted much of the 

southern part of the licence and the northern part of the application area to be underlain 

by mafic to intermediate volcanics.  Some 30% of the licence is covered by mbuga and 

various transported soils.

The Miramba Hill granite is composed of equigranular feldspar, quartz, biotite +/- 

hornblende, is light grey in colour and has no obvious foliation.  The Iramba Hills granite 

in the northwest of the licence is pinkish (K-feldspar?) composed of 50% feldspar, 30% 

quartz and 20% biotite.  Similarly no foliations were noted by Tanzam 2000 and feldspar 

phenocrysts were locally evident. 

 

Mafic volcanic rocks, largely basalt to andesite, were mapped along road cuts and on 

slightly elevated areas, especially in the vicinity of Namhula school and the abandoned 

Namhula artisanal mining site.  In the southwest of the licence Tanzam 2000 mapped a 

sheared felsic volcanic with cross-cutting quartz veins. 

 

Two other quartz veins were mapped.  One milky-white vein striking 235º was exposed 

for about 200 m close to Namhula village in the vicinity of the artisanal site.  The other 

occurs as a 2 m wide zone in a granite\/ in the northeast of the licence. 
 

6.3.4 PL 2931/2004 + HQ-P17392  

 

The published geological map (Barth, 1990) shows HQ-P17392 is essentially underlain 

by Nyanzian greenstones, with granite interpreted along the eastern edge.  Tanzanian 

Royalty's reinterpretation has largely confirmed this and better defined the banded iron-

formation and tuffs that occur in the upper parts of the Kurwirwi Hills.  These 

volcanogenic/chemical sediments occur within largely mafic volcanics.  The eastern part 

of PL 2931/2004 to the west is underlain by the same mafic volcanics while most of the 

centre and west is underlain by the Kurwirwi Diorite and quartz-porphyry.  As much as 

40% of the property is covered by lake deposits of proto-Lake Victoria, including 

limestone, sandstone, mudstone and cemented beach conglomerates. 
 

6.3.5 PL 3146/2005 + HQ-P18109 

 

The published geological map (Barth, 1990) shows PL 3146/2005 to be underlain by 

granite, and by greenstones in the centre of the current licence.  Tanzanian Royalty's 

reinterpretation suggests the entire licence is underlain by granite that outcrops on the 

Ragata Hills along the eastern edge and on Neruma Hill in the southwest corner.  HQ-

P18109 to the north is interpreted to be largely underlain by granite, with greenstones 

extending southeast from PL 2785/2004 in the western part.  Much of the lower-lying 

area is covered by lake deposits of proto-Lake Victoria including limestone, sandstone, 

mudstone and cemented beach conglomerates. 
 

6.3.6 PL 3314/2005 + HQ-P18524 

 

PL 3314/2005 and HQ-P18524 to the west are interpreted as being underlain by 

Nyanzian greenstones, extensions of the belt that forms the Kurwirwi Hills to the south.

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

 

7.1  Introduction 

 

The granite-greenstone sequences of the Tanzanian craton show many features that are typical of 

other Archaean cratons around the world, including the existence of numerous granitoids within 

and around substantial masses of greenstones, a predominance of greenschist facies regional 

metamorphism, regional scale crustal deformation and the existence of numerous gold deposits. 

 

Most of the giant gold deposits in the world are spatially associated with regional first-order 

structures, the deposits usually hosted by late-tectonic splay faults or shear zones.  The first-order 

structures may have acted as major conduits for fluid transport from deep in the crust while the 

secondary structures acted as the loci for mineral deposition with locally-reduced fluid pressure.  

Although granites typically occupy more than 50% of the exposed Archaean cratons, where they 

are in proximity to the greenstone belts they also host significant gold deposits containing over 1 

million ounces (e.g. Buzwagi and North Mara in Tanzania, Renabie in Ontario, Woodcutters, 

Tarmoola and Granny Smith in Western Australia, and Freda-Rebecca in Zimbabwe). 

  

The dominant orientation of gold-bearing structures in the Tanzanian craton is northwest (e.g. 

Bulyanhulu, Tulawaka and Buck Reef) and structures with this general orientation can be traced 

across the Tanzanian and Ugandan cratons and into the Democratic Republic of Congo.  More 

subtle northeast trends may control the mineralization in banded iron-formation at Geita and 

Golden Ridge and are also clearly visible on airborne magnetic maps west of Bulyanhulu.  

North-south structures appear to be significant at the Nyakafura deposit as are east-west 

structures at Golden Pride. 

 

Mining of bedrock gold was recorded as early as 1898 in the Lake Victoria Goldfields and 

continued intermittently into the 1970s in the Mara, Musoma, Serengeti, Iramba Plateau and 

Geita areas.  These operations were primarily on mesothermal lode-type deposits within the 

greenstone belts, most of the veins being associated with faults and shear zones though no major 

regional shear zones like the Cadillac Break of the Abitibi Belt in Canada have been recognized.  

Some mineralized zones are sub-parallel to lithologic layering in the greenstones, and others cut 

across layering, especially in the more competent units.  Dilational openings along shear zones 

are common hosts for the mineralization, which is often open space filling accompanied by 

replacement of adjacent wallrock at some sites.    

 

In his 1990 compilation, Barth listed 237 gold mines and occurrences in the area to the south and 

east of Lake Victoria, some of which remain the focus of small-scale artisanal mining.  This is 

particularly of eluvial and alluvial deposits and, locally, quartz veins within the upper weathering 

profile.  With the advent of widespread modern exploration in the 1990s, several major gold 

discoveries have been made.  By the end of 2008 four new large-scale gold mines had been put 

into production (Golden Pride, Geita, Bulyanhulu and North Mara) as well as the smaller 

Tulawaka Mine, while other projects were at an advanced stage and the Buzwagi Mine was 

commissioned in the second quarter of 2009.

7.2 Golden Pride Mine 

 

The Golden Pride Mine, located north of the town of Nzega, is owned and operated by Resolute 

(Tanzania) Ltd., the Tanzanian subsidiary of Resolute Mining Limited of Australia and was the 

first major gold mine in Tanzania when it was officially opened in February 1999.  In 2008 the 

plant throughput was 2.5 million tonnes at a head grade of 2.04 g/t Au, the mill recovery of 90% 

producing 150,000 ounces for the year at a cost of $449/oz.  Since commissioning the mine has 

produced in excess of 1.55 million ounces of gold.  2009 is expected to see a decrease in gold 

production with completion of mining in the western (main) pit and the central pit coming on 

stream later in the year. 

  

The mine lies in the Nzega Greenstone Belt and the area is underlain by intermediate to felsic 

tuffaceous volcanics and intercalated terrigenous sediments of Nyanzian age, with minor banded 

iron formation units (to the north of the mine). The Nyanzian is intruded by various granitic 

rocks and overlain by Kavirondian shales, sandstones and conglomerates.  South of the deposit is 

a pile of rhyolitic volcanics lying on granitic basement, while to the north the volcanics are more 

dominantly extrusive and interfingered with the terrigenous sediments.  Within the mine area, the 

ratio of volcaniclastics to sediments is approximately 1:1. 

 

The mineralization of the Golden Pride deposit lies within a major shear zone, some 200 metres 

wide and approximately 15º to the strike of the local stratigraphy. The shear zone strikes 080-

090º with a steep south dip to the foliation.  The bedding dips 70-80º S.  There are no apparent 

chemical controls on the mineralization; rather it appears that the competency contrast between 

the tuffs and sediments has resulted in cracking during shear movements.  The saprolite zone 

extends down to about 90 m below surface, and there is no apparent change in gold grade within 

the saprolite.  A narrow graphitic zone lies along the footwall of much of the significant 

mineralization, though it is not a clear indicator of the edge of the ore zone. The gold 

mineralization completely crosses lithologic boundaries and it is very hard to visually correlate 

between sections with no preferential direction to the mineralization.  Arsenopyrite is common 

throughout the shear zone and usually associated with the better gold grades but there is no direct 

correlation between gold and arsenic values.  Narrow subvertical quartz veins occur within the 

main shears and may contain higher grade gold mineralization.  Their overall effect on the gold 

resource, however, is minor.  Banded iron formation has little effect on the deposit and is only 

important where BIF units are folded into the main shear.  Small drag folds within the shear zone 

may suggest larger-scale folding within the shear zone, but no further evidence has been noted in 

the pit. 

 

7.3 Bulyanhulu Mine 
 

The Bulyanhulu Mine is owned and operated by Kahama Mining, a 100%-owned subsidiary of 

Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada, and was officially opened in July 2001. Bulyanhulu is the 

only major underground gold mine in Tanzania and had proven+probable reserves of 34.22 Mt 

averaging 10.86 g/t Au or 11.98 Moz Au plus contained copper at 0.589% or 444.3 million lb Cu 

as of December 31, 2008.  Production in 2008 was 200,000 ounces at a cash cost of US$ 620/oz.    

Mill recoveries are approximately 89%, with 42% of the gold recovered by gravity and 47% in a 

copper concentrate. 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 37 

 

 

No outcrops are known on the property.  The main rock types in the mine area are bimodal mafic 

and felsic volcanics rocks of the West Kahama segment of the Nyanzian age Kahama Greenstone 

Belt.  The mafic rocks are predominantly flows, overlain by a series of felsic pyroclastics and ash 

tuffs.  Argillites occur within the mafic flows and at the mafic/felsic contact and are the principal 

host for the mineralization.  Mafic dykes/sills, commonly lensoid along their northwest strike, 

are a significant part of the lithological package southwest of the deposit itself.  The Bukoli 

Granite, which separates the Kahama belt from the Rwamagaza belt to the west, lies 

approximately 3 km southwest of the mine.  Together with regional faults, the Bukoli Granite 

forms the bounds of a rhomboid-shaped greenstone domain at Bulyanhulu. 

 

The gold mineralization, together with copper sulphides and silver, occurs in quartz veins 

localized along steeply-dipping structures parallel to the regional northwest strike.  Nine of these 

extensive quartz vein systems have been discovered so far with Reef 1, hosted by a shear zone 

developed preferentially along the most extensive sedimentary unit, the most significant.  The 

ore is characterized by sub-continuous lenses and veins of black quartz concentrated in narrow 

shear zones. An initial stage of syn-depositional barren clastic pyrite has been identified, 

overprinted by a polymetallic hydrothermal event associated with gold and copper 

mineralization.  Alteration, dominantly carbonatization with the major introduction of Fe, Ca, 

As, Zn and S, is largely restricted to <5 m around the mineralized quartz veins.  Initial fluid 

inclusion studies suggest the mineralizing fluid was carbonic and methane-bearing at 300-450ºC.   

 

Three separate deposits have been outlined within Reef 1, the Main, East and West Zones, 

extending over a strike length of at least 5 km and down dip for at least 2 km.  The bulk of the 

current reserves are contained within the Main Zone, which has the highest average grade at 

more than 14 g/t Au and is open to depth.  A 1,090 m shaft in the centre of the Main Zone 

provides the principal underground access, with three internal ramps.  The East Zone contains at 

least 1.2 Moz in reserves averaging 12 g/t Au, close enough to surface to be mined from a ramp 

access.  The West Zone contains at least 2.0 Moz of gold in reserves averaging 14.0 g/t Au, in 

deeper mineralization that was discovered beneath a series of earlier shallow, barren drill holes.  

Development in 2009 is focussing on Reef 2 and Reef 0, east and west of Reef 1 respectively. 

Additional mineralization has been discovered west of the Bulyanhulu River, west of the West 

Zone, in what is termed the Far West Zone.  The gold mineralization is unusually continuous, 

and limited deep drilling to about 2,000 m below surface suggests the continuity along strike at 

that depth may be similar to that demonstrated by the more detailed drilling closer to surface.  

Mining width varies from 2-6 m, depending on the orientation of the quartz vein. 

 

A 138 km powerline carrying 220 kV was brought in from the national grid, but the power is 

dependent on good seasonal rains so Barrick installed stand-by generators to meet the 14.5 MW 

required.  A water pipeline was constructed between the mine and Lake Victoria and the existing 

airstrip has been upgraded to 1,700 m.  A dedicated satellite link provides communications.

7.4 Geita Mine 
 

The Geita Mine, operated by AngloGold-Ashanti, was opened in June 2000 with reserves of 49.1 

Mt averaging 4.05 g/t Au, or approximately 6.4 Moz Au. The mine is located immediately west 

of the town of Geita, in the centre of the Geita Greenstone Belt.  Between 1936 - 1966, the Geita 

area produced an estimated 940,000 oz Au from 5.5 Mt of ore at an average recovered grade of 

5.3g/t Au from five underground deposits.  In 2008 the mine produced 264,000 ounces of gold at 

a recovered grade of 1.92 g/t Au, cash cost of $728/oz and total production cost of $929/oz.  Q1 

2009 production was 44,000 oz Au at a total cost of $1,018.  The mine currently operates several 

open pits, serviced by a 5.2 million tonnes/year CIL plant.  The lack of access to higher-grade 

orebodies following a major wall collapse in the Nyankanga pit in Q1 2007 continues to affect 

production grades in 2008.  The Star and Comet pit was commissioned in 2008 and Lone Cone 

was depleted.  Pushback 5 at Nyankanga will provide ore access in Q1 2009. 

 

The Geita belt is the most northerly of the greenstone belts south of Lake Victoria, and is part of 

the "outer arc" of the regional Sukumaland Greenstone Belt.  The Geita belt is dominated by 

isoclinally folded oxide facies BIF ridges averaging 500m in thickness and flanked by younger 

felsic pyroclastics.  The ridges have been later deformed into west-plunging open folds with 

WNW axial trends.  These have subsequently undergone major displacement along NW trending 

shears.  Regional Proterozoic quartz-gabbro dykes intrude along reactivated NE-SW faults. 

 

Most of the Geita gold occurrences are related to BIF and chert within tuffaceous/volcaniclastic 

sediments where this sequence is intruded by dioritic to monzonitic dykes. The BIF is considered 

to be a favourable site for gold mineralization as it can be chemically reactable during shearing. 

 

Emphasis was made by AngloGold personnel that there are over "21" individual gold deposits 

and major gold occurrences within their Geita land package in the Geita belt and that while all of 

the deposits bear some relation to the presence of chemically reactable BIF, and that the deposits 

exhibit a wide range of structural and lithological settings. It was emphasized that no single 

model described completely the settings of all of the gold occurrences discovered to date.  

Clearly the exploration criteria important to the discovery of Geita style deposits, is the presence 

of BIF, abundance of parasitic folding and shearing, felsic to intermediate composition intrusives 

present within the BIF sequences and the presence of gold mineralization with the latter often 

indicated by previous artisanal and/or colonial mining. 

 
The Nyankanga, Lone Cone and Geita Hill deposits form a semi-continuous NE mineralised 

trend (the Geita Trend) near the hinge of the principal west-plunging synform.  All deposits dip 

northwest to west, sub-parallel to stratigraphy.  They are located on structures subsidiary to the 

regional NW trending shears close to which local compression causes breaks in continuity. 

 

Nyankanga was discovered in the late 1990s after a review of exploration drilling results. The 

thrust zone hosting the deposit has little surface expression and is masked by thick ferricrete on 

the flanks of a hill.  At Nyankanga a granodiorite-diorite suite has intruded as dykes and sills into 

banded iron-formation with lesser mudstone and siltstone from a plug centred on a WNW fault.  

This has produced a suite of alteration assemblages similar to Cu-porphyry systems as well as 

sulphide and gold deposition.  The main gold mineralization, however, is controlled by low-



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 39 

 

angle sigmoidal northeast-trending structures dipping northwest and north with numerous splays 

in the hanging wall.  High grade shoots at Nyankanga plunge to the west (lithologically-

controlled) and to the northwest (fault-controlled).  The deposit subcrops in low ground below 

10-15m of barren, transported laterite cover.  NNW to NW-trending regional shears form the 

strike limits of the deposit. 

 

The main orebody ranges up to 50m thick in the central part of the deposit, with areas of higher-

grade mineralization ranging up to 45 g/t Au over 18 m generally representing uniformly 

mineralized BIF units.  A wide zone of anomalous mineralization up to 60 m thick occurs within 

the microdiorite, typically containing multiple intersections of 1-2 g/t Au over 5-8 m.  

Rheological contrast with the diorite has focussed shearing within the BIF and mineralization has 

followed these units wherever possible.  Where BIF is absent or the shear zone cuts a thicker 

diorite sill, the lack of stress focus has dispersed mineralizing fluids resulting in a wider orebody 

with a more erratic gold distribution and lower average grade.  Two phases of syn- to post-

mineralization dykes occur throughout the deposit and are thought to represent late felsic 

evolution of the intrusive system at Nyankanga.  Late stage deposition and/or re-mobilization of 

gold may have occurred during emplacement as grades up to 200 g/t Au have been observed 

where the dykes cross-cut the orebody.  

 

Gold is closely associated with fine pyrite and silicification.  Free gold occurs as inclusions, in 

fractures in pyrite and as discrete grains within secondary quartz.  Mineralization and ductile 

shearing have occurred preferentially in magnetite bands in BIF and along magnetite-chert 

bedding contacts.  Brecciation has occurred in higher strain areas, the resultant higher fluid flow 

causing silica flooding and pervasive pyrite mineralization, eventually leading to total 

replacement of the protolith in areas of very high grade (approx. >50g/t).  Within the diorite, 

pyrite occurs as fracture fill in biotite/calcite stockworks and in quartz veins.  In areas of higher 

grade (approx. >3g/t), pyrite is also finely disseminated throughout the groundmass and silica 

replacement is pervasive. 

 

The Geita Hill succession is similar to Nyankanga, though felsic pyroclastics are more common.  

Mineralization is controlled by a major northeast-trending shear dipping 50-55 NW.  This 

shearing is sub-parallel to the regional strike of the BIF sequence but cross-cuts local folding and 

lithological contacts.  The outer contacts of the orebody are sharp with a rapid drop in grade over 

1 or 2m to background levels < 0.02 g/t Au.  Economic mineralization continues on strike for 2.3 

km, including  four lithologically-controlled shoots up to 8 g/t Au over 40 m that plunge to the 

north.  These are the historic Geita and North East Extension mines (BIF dominated) and the 

previously undiscovered Gap (interbedded BIF & felsic tuff) and Geita West (interbedded BIF & 

microdiorite) shoots.  Gold mostly occurs as fine-grained inclusions and fracture-filling in fine-

grained pyrite (and locally pyrrhotite) mineralization, the sulphides typically being 10-20%.  The 

sulphide mineralization within the BIF is similar to Nyankanga, and is generally disseminated in 

other lithologies.    

 

At Lone Cone the North Zone (mined between 1940 and 1953 on 3 levels) is hosted by a distinct 

BIF unit within interbedded BIF and microdiorite, while the South Zone is hosted by BIF with 

minor interbedded felsic tuffs.  Both deposits strike ENE (the North Zone over at least 480m and 

the South Zone 240 m) and dip 50 to the north.  The North Zone has a total width of up to 25 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 40 

 

m, with footwall and hanging-wall zones of 6-7 g/t over 5-8m separated by lower grade material.   

The South Zone is made up of various thin, patchy sections over a total width of up to 40m.  

Gold mineralization and wallrock alteration are similar to Geita Hill. 

 

The Kukuluma Trend comprises five NW trending areas of significant gold mineralization along 

a 3 km ESE-trending gold in soil anomaly (+80ppb Au) that cuts obliquely across a NW trending 

horseshoe ridge (Bukolwa Hill) of BIF and  chert interbedded with mudstone, siltstone and 

wacke.  The BIF sequence is underlain by a distinctive carbonaceous pyritic mudstone and 

overlain by felsic tuffs that flank the ridges.  Tight anticlinal folding, with the BIF and pyritic 

mudstone in the core, has been refolded along a NW axis to produce the horseshoe ridge.  

 

The Kukuluma and Matandani deposits are located in topographic bowls incised into the 

Cretaceous ferricrete plateau.  The host lithologies at Matandani tend to be more clastic than 

those at Kukuluma and include shaly BIF and wackes.  Gold mineralization is fault controlled, 

stratabound and localised by the intersection of steeply-dipping shears with ferruginous 

lithologies of a similar northwest strike but shallower dip.  Gold mineralization at Kukuluma 

below the limit of weathering is very fine- grained, included in magnetite and arsenopyrite 

within fibrous grunerite aggregates, spatially associated with pyrrhotite and pyrite, and confined 

to the iron-rich mudstone.  Most of the mineralization at Matandani is contained in discrete BIF 

units, with minor quartz vein-hosted gold in the other sediments and tuffs.  Both deposits have 

been weathered to over 100m in places, with major redistribution of gold.  Extensive leaching of 

gold appears to have taken place near surface, while exploration drilling at Kukuluma has 

revealed a general 2 to 3 g/t Au increase in mean grade between 60 and 105m depth and a planar 

zone of gold enrichment, the latter at least in part due to stringer zones coalescing in this area. 

 

Area 3 comprises three mineralized zones along the eastern limb of Bukolwa Hill.  The BIF 

sequence (vertical, northwest strike) includes more chert than at Kukuluma although the same 

carbonaceous pyritic mudstone is seen at the core of the limb and iron-rich sediments are found 

interbedded with the BIF at the southeast end of the ridge.  Mineralization at two locations along 

the limb occurs at the intersection of crosscutting NE faults with the principal NW shear.  Gold is 

associated with arsenopyrite in magnetite-rich bands or occurs with silicification and quartz 

veins at the sheared contact between the BIF and the felsic tuff. 

 

7.5 North Mara Mine 

 

The North Mara Mine is situated within the Mara Greenstone Belt.  The underlying geology 

comprises felsic and mafic volcanics intercalated with sediments which are intruded by various 

granitoid and gabbroic plutonic rocks.  Tertiary volcanic lava flows partially cover the 

underlying Archaean geology and the ore bodies are structurally controlled, shear-hosted lode 

gold deposits. 

 

The mine is located in Tarime District of Mara Region, about 100 km east of Lake Victoria, 20 

km south of the Kenyan border and 200 km northeast of Mwanza.  The mine was originally 

developed by Afrika Mashariki then by Placer Dome and currently by Barrick Gold Corp after 

their 2006 takeover of Placer.  The operation comprises three open pit deposits.  Mining is under 

way at Nyabirama and the Nyabigena pit is in the development phase. The Gokona pit is 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 41 

 

currently being prepared for development. The mine plan is to exploit the Nyabirama open cut to 

a depth of 325 m, Nyabigena to 160 m and Gokona to 280 m. 

  

North Mara produced approximately 197,000 ounces of gold in 2008 at a total cash cost of $757 

per ounce.  Proven and probable mineral reserves as of December 31, 2008 were estimated by 

Barrick at 3.0 million ounces of gold.  

 

Ore is fed from the run-of-mine pad to a crushed ore stockpile via a single jaw crusher and a 

secondary crusher. The crushed ore is conveyed into an open circuit SAG mill before passing to 

a closed circuit ball mill regrind. A gravity separation circuit is used to scalp free gold from 

regrind circuit.  The ore is then processed via cyanidation and carbon-in-leach, followed by 

electrowinning and gold refining to doré on site.  The plant was expanded from 2.0 to 2.8 million 

tonnes annual capacity in 2004.

8.0 MINERALIZATION 

 

The gold mineralization in the Lake Victoria Goldfields in northwestern Tanzania occurs in all 

units of the Nyanzian greenstone belts as well as certain of the major felsic intrusives as at 

Buzwagi and North Mara.  The known gold mineralization within the area of the Kibara Project 

is restricted to historic artisanal mining activity and to a gold+copper-bearing quartz vein 

exposed by trenching. 

 

The mineralization on Nyakona Hill within PL 2308/2003 occurs as narrow gossanous quartz 

veins with abundant malachite (up to 40%) apparently along the contact between felsic-

intermediate tuffs and a feldspar porphyry intrusive.  The quartz veins are sub-parallel to 

observed bedding at 115º/70ºS.

9.0 EXPLORATION by TANZANIAN ROYALTY 
 

Tanzanian Royalty commenced exploration on the Kibara Project in August 2002 with mini-bleg 

sampling in the precursor to PL 2308/2003.  This was followed by rock and termite mound 

sampling to validate BLEG anomalies and then by trenching, biogeochemical (BGC) sampling 

and gradient IP surveys.  The other licences were covered with BGC sampling, mapping and 

chip sampling and limited auger soil follow-up.  None of the geochemical or other targets have 

yet been tested with any form of drilling.  Year-by-year and total expenditures for the Kibara 

Project were not available as these had been included in "other projects" in the annual reports of 

Tanzanian Royalty. 
 
 

9.1 PL 2308/2003, PL 4606/2007 and HQ-P19022 

 

 9.1.1 BLEG Geochemistry 

 

The first phase of exploration on PL 2308/2003 was a mini-BLEG sampling survey 

carried out in August 2002.  A total of 128 samples were collected over the licence and 

sent to SGS in Mwanza for analysis.  Six of the samples returned anomalous gold values 

greater than 10 ppb Au, with the highest value of 27 ppb Au coming from Nyakona Hill.  

Follow-up termite mound (14 samples) and grab sampling (14 samples) in October 2003 

reported anomalous gold values of 49 ppb Au and 6.67 g/t Au, respectively, from the 

same area.  Termite mound and grab samples were also taken to check the elevated gold 

BLEG results from Mwigundu Hill, with inconclusive results. 

 

Also in 2002 a total of 27 BLEG samples were collected from the western half of PL 

2308/2003, in what is now PL 4606/2007.  All samples returned low gold results. 

 

Tanzanian Royalty reports describe a further 198 BLEG samples being taken in March 

2004 on 50 x 100 m spacing over an area of 0.7 x 1.0 km on Nyakona Hill.  The available 

data, however, does not include any mention of these samples.  The survey was intended 

to validate the BLEG, termite mound and grab gold anomaly and was reported by 

Tanzanian Royalty to return encouraging gold values up to 27 ppb Au. 

 

The BLEG anomalies were field-checked in 2004 and it was apparent that the BLEG 

anomalies were related to Kavirondian sediments forming the top of the hill. 

 

9.1.2 Soil Sampling 

 

In November 2004 a follow-up soil sampling program was carried out over a 600 x 600 

m grid on the eastern side of Nyakona Hill.  This was centred on an anomalous grab 

sample collected in June 2004 (J-3881, 6.0 g/t Au and 13.8% Cu).  There is no mention

certificate including it.  A total of 45 samples were collected at 100 m x 100 m spacing.  

Results for this program were encouraging with values up to 230 ppb Au and 2760 ppm 

Cu.  The cluster of anomalous gold values appears to be open to the east where there is

mbuga cover, while the copper anomaly is open to the south.  The results are shown on 

Figure 9.1.   

 

In the first quarter of 2008 60 soil samples were collected in PL 4606/2007 on a 200 x 

200 m grid.  These were submitted to ALS-Chemex for analysis together with 2 standards 

and 1 blank.  No anomalies were detected with most samples below detection for gold. 

  

In November-December 2008 a combined soil and auger sampling program was carried 

out to extend the anomalous gold-copper zone on Nyakona Hill.  Totals of 269 soil 

samples, 12 termite mound samples and 120 auger samples (from areas covered by 

mbuga or lake sediments) were collected, together with 8 duplicates.  The majority of 

these samples were collected from PL 2308/2003 (see Table 9.1) and those from 

adjoining areas have been included in this description for simplicity.  The gold and 

copper results are shown on Figure 9.2.

There is an apparent northeast trend to the copper-gold anomalies within a broad zone 

outlined by the 90 ppm Cu contour, extending over 1,800 m north-south and over 1,000 

m east-west in PL 2308/2003.  The copper-gold anomalies are open to the east as no 

sampling was possible in the deeper sediments close to the shore of Lake Victoria.  A 

smaller group of weaker anomalies is similarly outlined south of Nyakona Hill, straddling 

the boundary between PLs 3314/2005 and 2931/2004.

9.1.3 Biogeochemical (BGC) Sampling 

 

BGC sampling of the Buguma licence (PL 2308/03) was carried out from 16
th

 to 25
th

 

January 2006. A total of 468 samples plus 17 duplicates were collected over 25 traverses 

covering 69.6 line km. Of this 254 samples were collected at 400 m x 200 m spacing 

while 231 samples were derived from a small tighter sampling grid covering a known 

copper-gold soil anomaly, where sampling was carried out in 100m intervals along 200m 

spaced lines.  The licence was also botanically mapped to establish plant associations and 

distribution patterns. The preferred sampling species, MLJ, was abundantly present, 

especially in the southern and central parts of the licence and constituted 429 samples or 

88.5%.  TBT becomes more dominant towards the north.  A sample station located 

directly on the soil anomaly provided four different species for comparison studies.

All samples were prepared at the TANCAN facility in Mwanza then submitted to ACME 

Laboratories in Vancouver for ICP-MS gold+37 element analysis.  The gold values were 

mostly low to moderate and ranged from below detection limit (0.1 ppb Au) to a 

maximum of 3 ppb Au.  The mean plus 2 and 3 standard deviations (M+2 and M+3) for 

gold approximate the 95

 and 98

Contour maps were generated by Tanzam 2000 for all 38 assayed elements. Au 

anomalies were recorded by species MLJ, MLM, TBT and NTG, the MLJ anomalies 

possibly being enhanced by its generally lower uptake rate compared to MLM and TBT. 

The anomalous gold values from the BGC sampling lie outside and primarily to the north 

of the detailed grid covering the gold-in-soil anomaly and the trenches.  The initial 

statistical analysis by Tanzam 2000 showed only As and Sc had a substantial peripheral 

relationship to gold.  An external statistical analysis was carried out by Tom Woolman of 

OnTarget and this predicted the source gold mineralization would be located just off-

shore to the north of the BGC sampling area.  The multiple regression equations and 

linear regression analysis pointed to a moderate relationship of Th to Au.   Primary 

precursor elements to Th were shown to be Fe, Cr and As, with a moderate relationship 

calculated for Na, U and Cu.  

 

Five distinct east-west gold anomalous zones were detected by the BGC (Figure 9.2).  No 

single element or a combination of elements could be seen as pathfinders for the BGC 

gold anomalies.  Elevated Ag and Cs were recorded at two or more anomalous zones; Co, 

Cu, Pb and U at only one zone. Of the remaining elements, elevated Cd, Fe and Na are 

commonly found to be associated with elevated Au, while elevated Ni, P, Pb, Ti, Th and 

Zn are limited to a single anomalous gold zone.  As and Sc form strong east-west 

envelopes paralleling some of the gold anomalies. 

 

The strongest gold trend observed is 090°, supported by As, Cu, Hg and Mo (99
th

 

percentile) and subordinately supported by Ag, Co, Cs and Cu (95
th

 percentile) plus La 

and Ni.  Minor gold trends at 065° and 130° parallel major structural trends in the 

Musoma-Mara Greenstone Belt. 

 

A strong Ni-Cu-Ti anomaly was recorded in the NE of the peninsula, best delineated by 

species TBT. This species possesses high uptake rates for these elements hence the 

anomaly may be species- rather than geology-related.

9.1.4 Geological Mapping and Grab Sampling 

 

The area of PL 2308/2003, including what is now PL 4606/2007 and HQ-P19022, was 

mapped in the latter part of 2004 along approximately 50 line km of traverses.  A 

significant part of the original licence is covered by Lake Victoria and much of the lower-

lying ground is covered by sediments of proto-Lake Victoria. 

 

Five main geological units were identified within PL 2308/2003 and HQ-P19022.  Mafic 

flows and tuffs outcrop on the flanks of Mwigundu Hill and on the north of Nyakona 

Hill; intermediate tuffs on Nyakona Hill; quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusives on the 

southern part of Nyakona Hill and in much of HQ-P19022; granite underlies the 

southwest corner of PL 2308/2003; and Kavirondian conglomerates, grits, lithic 

sandstones and shales occur on both Nyakona and Mwigundi Hills. 

 

Nyakona Hill in the south of the licence trends roughly north-south and includes a 

gossanous quartz vein, striking 115º and dipping 70ºS in a Nyanzian? felsic tuff/feldspar 

porphyry package that returned 18.75% Cu and 3.33 g/t Au from one sample.  A typical 

bedding trend in Kavirondian shales on the upper slopes is 297º/56º/202º.   

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 50 

 

On Mwigundu Hill in the north of PL 2308/2003 shales interbedded with laminated 

sandstones and conglomerates outcrop on the upper slopes and chert plus banded iron-

formation occurs on top of the hill.  These rocks strike north-northwest and dip steeply 

west.  The chert and BIF resemble the same units found elsewhere in the Nyanzian of the 

Mara-Musoma Belt but their relationship to the Kavirondian is not clear at Kibara.  Mafic 

volcanics that are clearly Nyanzian occur on the lower slopes and presumably underlie 

the Kavirondian sediments. 

 

The southern part of what is now PL 4606/2007 was interpreted by Tanzanian Royalty to 

be underlain by mafic volcanics and a syenitic porphyry.  The northern part of the 

peninsula was interpreted as granite while the western part was interpreted to contain 

mafic volcanics, quartz-porphyry and syenite porphyry. 

 
Initial grab sampling to follow-up the 2002 BLEG anomalies included a result of 6.67 g/t 

Au, reportedly from quartz veining although the internal reports did not describe the 

program.  Tanzanian Royalty also mention a gold-copper grab sample assaying 6 g/t Au 

and 13.0% Cu from Nyakona Hill (sample J-3881) but this was not described in the 

reports provided to the author nor was it included in the grab sample database provided.   

In November 2004 the source of the anomalous Nyakona Hill grab samples was re-

checked by Tanzam 2000.  Twelve grab samples of mineralized float material were 

collected, most with up to 40% malachite.  No bedrock with similar mineralization was 

detected.

During a further field visit in December 2004 Tanzam 2000 identified an outcrop 45 m 

southwest of J-6733 as the source of the mineralized float.  The outcrop included quartz 

veining and cherty gossan with up to 40% malachite in a syenitic tuff striking 115º and 

dipping 70º SSW.  Plate 9.1, showing a sample of mineralized rock from the outcrop, was 

taken by the author in July 2009. 

 

9.1.5 Trenching 

 

In February and March 2006 approximately 410 m of trenching was done on the east side 

of Nyakona Hill, across the area where several grab samples had returned copper values 

up to 13.0% Cu and gold up to 6.0 g/t Au.  All 16 trenches, KB132TR01-KB132TR16, 

were dug to bedrock and all except KB132TR01, KB132TR06, KB132TR07, 

KB132TR10 and KB132TR11 intersected quartz veins and gossan.  The lithologies 

intersected were primarily a fine-grained, massive intermediate tuff / syenite and feldspar 

porphyry.  There is an apparent southwest trend to these rocks with a shallow southeast 

dip.  The highly weathered quartz veining with gossan and malachite is parallel to the 

strike of the host rocks. 

  

A total of 52 samples were collected from 11 trenches and sent to Humac Laboratories in 

Mwanza for gold analysis by fire assay with atomic absorption finish (method Au4).  The 

samples were mainly taken from quartz vein/gossan material with one footwall and one 

hanging-wall sample at each location.  Significant gold assay results included 20 samples 

with values ≥1.22 g/t Au, the highest being 14.80 g/t Au from trench KB132TR02.  

Significant copper and silver values were also received with 17 samples greater than 1% 

Cu with a high of 27.4% Cu and silver values ranging up to 87 g/t Ag. 

  

Most of the hanging-wall and footwall rock samples had elevated gold, copper and silver 

values, suggesting that hydrothermal activity had extended outside the vein structure.   

The hanging and footwall rock samples returned values between 0.01 and 0.83 g/t Au.

 9.1.6 2008 Review and follow-up. 
 

During Q1 2008 Tanzanian Royalty compiled all the available data for PL 2308/2003 and 

imported it into Micromine.  The two main hills, Mwigundu Hill to the north and 

Nyakona Hill to the southeast, were the main focus of the evaluation.  As a result, follow-

up auger sampling and IP gradient surveys were planned and executed.  A single line of 

hand-auger sampling was done along an east-west trending BGC gold anomaly to 

establish the regolith profile.   Three of the holes bottomed at 1 m or less in Kavirondian 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 55 

 

sandstone colluvium with minor cherty material while the other two passed through a 

sequence of mbuga and other clays, ending at 3 m and 7 m. 

 

Figure 9.5 displays both the BLEG Au and the contoured BGC results with Au (red), Cu 

(green) and Ag (Dark brown).  The contours are for the 95
th

 percentiles for each element.  

Towards the north of the licence on Mwigundu Hill the BLEG and BGC anomalies 

coincide, although the BGC has an east-west trend that is not clear on the BLEG results.  

Other than a single-point plant anomaly on Nyakona Hill to the south, there is no 

correspondence between the BLEG and BGC results.     

 

 
 

Figure 9.5  BLEG and BGC Results plus IP lines, PL 2308/2003 

 

An IP gradient survey was carried by Tanzanian Royalty out over Nyakona Hill, on 100 

m east-west line spacing and 25 m station intervals.  Towards the east of the grid a 

chargeability zone of 8mV/V was detected that corresponds with the anomalous BLEG 

soil gold results, though not with the trench locations and high-grade grab results.  

Towards the west a chargeability of 12 mV/V was detected.  There are no BGC, BLEG or 

soil anomalies in this area, and this chargeability anomaly is thought to be a specific 

geological unit.

Two additional IP gradient grids were surveyed, over Mwigundu Hill and the low ground 

between Nyakona and Mwigundu Hills (see Figure 9.x).  These grids were oriented at 

307º with 400 m line spacing and 25 m station intervals.  Chargeabilities of 17mV/V and 

24mV/V were detected that coincide with the contoured elevated BGC gold values.  The 

IP results do not indicate any distinct east-west structures that would parallel the trend of 

the BGC gold results.

9.2.1 Mapping and Grab Sampling 

 
In November 2004 reconnaissance geological mapping of the licence was carried out, 

primarily along the roads and tracks traversing the area.  The central part of the licence is 

largely covered by light brown lateritic soils; the northwest and southwest by light grey 

sandy soils below granitic hills; the east-central and northeast areas by mbuga; and the 

shores of Lake Victoria by lake sediments. 

 

Granite outcrops in the Iramba Hills in the northwest of PL 2785/2004 and on Miramba 

Hill in the southwest of HQ-P17009.  Tanzanian Royalty has interpreted much of the 

southern part of the licence and the northern part of the application area to be underlain 

by mafic to intermediate volcanics.  The Miramba Hill granite is composed of 

equigranular feldspar, quartz, biotite +/- hornblende, is light grey in colour and has no 

obvious foliation.  The Iramba Hills granite in the northwest of the licence is pinkish (K-

feldspar?) composed of 50% feldspar, 30% quartz and 20% biotite.  Similarly no 

foliations were noted by Tanzam 2000 and feldspar phenocrysts were locally evident. 

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 59 

 

Mafic volcanic rocks, largely basalt to andesite, were mapped along road cuts and on 

slightly elevated areas, especially in the vicinity of Namhula school and the abandoned 

Namhula artisanal mining site.  Two quartz veins were mapped other than those at the 

mining site.  One milky-white vein striking 235º was exposed for about 200 m close to 

Namhula village in the vicinity of the artisanal site.  The other occurs as a 2 m wide zone 

in a granite? in the northeast of the licence. 
 

During the reconnaissance mapping in November 2004 17 grab samples were collected, 

primarily selected from muck-piles from the artisanal mining site plus pits and quartz 

veins near Namhula village and in the northeast of the licence.  These were sent to 

Humac Laboratories in Mwanza for gold analysis by 50 g fire assay with a gravimetric 

finish.  Five of the grab samples from the artisanal site returned gold values >1.0g/t Au 

with a maximum of 18.75 g/t Au from sample J-6713.

9.2.2 Soil Sampling 

  

In November 2004 18 holes totalling 76.3 m were drilled with hand augers.  Thirteen of 

these holes intersected bedrock and the other five were stopped on reaching ferricrete or 

quartz gravels due to the hardness of the ground.  The auger holes showed there were 

calcrete layers below the mbuga horizon and/or above the saprolite.  All holes except 

KB71AUG11 were sampled, with a total of 18 samples prepared and analyzed by ALS-

Chemex.  All samples reported values less than 3 ppb Au. 

 

 9.2.3 Biogeochemical (BGC) Sampling 

 

PL 2785/2004 and what is now HQ-P17009 were covered with biogeochemical (BGC) 

sampling in Q1 2006.  A total of 1,132 leaf samples were collected plus 49 duplicates, on 

lines 400 m apart and 200 m station intervals.  The predominant species sampled were 

YFA (60%) and MLJ (29%), with minor NTG, NYA and TBT.  The samples were 

processed in the TANCAN preparation facility in Mwanza before being sent to ACME 

Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver for gold + 37 element ICP-MS analysis. 

 

Clusters of low-anomalous Au values were recorded from the Lake Victoria shore in the 

northeast of the licence. 511 samples were below the detection limit of 0.2 ppb Au.  The 

80
th

 percentile for gold is at 0.5 ppb Au and the 99
th

 percentile at 1.2 ppb Au. The highest 

gold value of 2.10 ppb Au was recorded from a TBT specimen.  All vegetation samples 

returned gold values at or below detection (0.2 ppb Au) from the abandoned artisanal 

area where 5 anomalous grab samples from 1.07 g/t to 18.75 g/t Au were collected.

9.2.4 2008  Follow-up Soil Sampling 

 

In February-March 2008 Tanzanian Royalty carried out a program of soil sampling with 

hand augers to follow-up BGC targets.  A total of 39 holes were drilled to depths of up to 

5 m, a total of 116.1 m drilled.  Six of these holes totalling 14.0 m were drilled on what is 

now HQ-P17009.  Where possible the holes were drilled to bedrock, though many were 

stopped in ferricrete or quartz gravels that the auger could not penetrate.  A total of 123 

samples were collected, for each metre or partial metre drilled, together with 2 duplicates 

from PL 2785/2004 and one from HQ-P17009.  These were prepared at the TANCAN 

facility in Mwanza and submitted to ALS-Chemex for ICP-MS analysis together with 5 

blanks and 5 standards.

9.2.5 2008 IP Survey 

 

In March 2008 an IP gradient survey was completed over the Namhula artisanal 

workings.  The grid was 1.5 km long with lines 400 m apart.  Station interval was 25 m. 

A northwest-trending chargeability anomaly was indicated to the west of the abandoned 

workings.   This zone is open to the northwest with a strike length of at least 800 m.  

Figure 9.z illustrates the chargeability, with the artisanal workings shown as blue dots on 

the northeast edge of the chargeability anomaly.

9.3 PL 2931/2004 and HQ-P17392 

 

 9.3.1 Mapping and Grab Sampling 

  

In Q1 2006 approximately 21 days were spent mapping the geology and regolith of the 

licence.  East-west traverses about 1 km apart were mapped across the Kurwirwi Hills in 

the eastern half of the licence (now HQ-P17392).  The remainder of the area was mapped 

along road traverses and paths between them. 

 

The published geological map (Barth, 1990) shows HQ-P17392 is essentially underlain 

by Nyanzian greenstones, with granite interpreted along the eastern edge.  Tanzanian 

Royalty's reinterpretation has largely confirmed this and better defined the banded iron-

formation and tuffs that occur in the upper parts of the Kurwirwi Hills.  These 

volcanogenic/chemical sediments occur within largely mafic volcanics.  The eastern part 

of PL 2931/2004 to the west is underlain by the same mafic volcanics while most of the 

centre and west is underlain by the Kurwirwi Diorite and quartz-porphyry.  As much as 

40% of the property is covered by lake deposits of proto-Lake Victoria, including 

limestone, sandstone, mudstone and cemented beach conglomerates. 
 

The geology and regolith mapping indicated that reddish brown lateritic soil occurs on 

and around the Kurwirwi Hills, associated with ferricrete that includes chert/BIF/tuff 

fragments.  Sandy soil light brown to light grey in colour was mapped in the southwest 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 63 

 

and west portion of the licence area. Black cotton soils (mbuga) occur in the northeast, 

northwest and southwest of the licence.  

 

The Kurwirwi Hills trend northwest for almost 10 km and are up to 2 km wide.  Mapping 

of the geology was hindered by heavy rainfall, thick forest cover and steep slopes 

especially in the eastern side.  Outcrops of banded iron formation (BIF), chert and 

volcaniclastic sediments / felsic tuff were mainly encountered on top of the hills with the 

chert/BIF package more dominant to the west.  Extensive scree deposits of all lithologies 

occur on the slopes.  Structural measurements suggest outcrops on the east were 

160º/80º/055º while those in the west were 320º/65º/225º.  The shear fabric and fracture 

cleavage parallel and cross-cut bedding respectively at 330º/25º/245º and 060º/75º/335º.  

The mapping, especially in the BIF, suggested the entire range was a steep anticline with 

multiple minor folds.  A Z-fold symmetry was noted in several outcrops by looking down 

the steep northerly plunge of the minor folds where bedding measurements on different 

limbs were 035º/70º/NW, 110º/70º/NE and 330º/70º/SW. 

   

In the southeast corner of what is now HQ-P17392 a granite was mapped on Nyalulimi 

Hill.  This rock is light grey-brown, coarse-grained, containing 50% feldspar, 35% quartz 

and 15% biotite.  In the northeast part of PL2931/2004, around Mifube Hill, a porphyritic 

trachyte with feldspar phenocrysts in a dark grey groundmass was exposed.  In the 

western part of the licence, west of Kigaga village, a light grey, medium-grained 

syenodiorite/monzodiorite with feldspar±quartz outcrops on the small low hills. 

 

Seventy-three rock grab samples were collected during the mapping and sent to Humac 

Laboratories in Mwanza for gold analysis by fire assay with AA finish.  Only 11 samples 

returned values ≥0.01 g/t Au with a highest value of 0.045 g/t Au. 

 
9.3.2 Biogeochemical (BGC) Sampling 

 

In January-February 2006 a total of 1561 vegetation samples including 50 duplicates 

were collected from the Kurwirwi licence (PL 2931/2004).  Samples were collected at 

200 m intervals along 25 lines 400 m apart, totalling 304.6 line km.

Generally good sampling coverage was achieved, with the gaps principally on the upper 

slopes of the Kurwirwi Hills.  MLJ was the preferred sampling species with 1402 or 

92.8% of the samples collected.  The samples were processed in TANCAN's Mwanza 

preparation facility before being sent to ACME Laboratories in Vancouver for gold+37-

element ICP-MS analysis.  The gold results were generally low to moderate with a 

highest value of 8 ppb Au.   74 samples exceeded the 95
th

 percentile (0.8 ppb Au) and 29 

samples exceeded the 98
th

 percentile of 1.35 ppb Au. 
 

 
 

Figure 9.11 BGC Gold Results PL 2931/2004. 

 

 The anomalous gold values occur over a variety of regolith and bedrock types.   

 

Area 1a includes multiple anomalies over 6.5 km trending east on 9767400.  It stretches 

across the Kurwirwi Hills where it is underlain by greenstones, and to the east of the hills 

where it is underlain by granites.  The soils are typically lateritic or mbuga respectively. 

 

Area 1b includes multiple isolated anomalies on the eastern slopes of the Kurwirwi Hills 

and the lower (granitic) ground to the east.  Cobalt is an associated element. 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 65 

 

Area 2 consists of a group of small, scattered, low-level gold anomalies with associated 

thorium located in and between the Buguma and Igundu settlements along the main 

Buguma road.  Sandy soils and mbuga overlie trachytic rocks. 

 

Area 3 includes the highest gold value of 8.0 ppb Au, supported by adjacent lower 

anomalous values also from the MLJ species.  Sandy soils and mbuga overlie 

syenodioritic rocks in an area where copper and sulphur are associated anomalous 

elements. 

 

Area 4 consists of a small cluster of anomalous gold values with associated B, P, Se, Sr, 

Ti and U around a 4.8 ppb Au anomaly, in the southeast corner of the property.  Sandy 

soils cover interpreted granites and the area is within the drainage off the greenstones of 

the Kurwirwi Hills to the northwest. 

 

 9.3.3 2008 Follow-up Soil Sampling 

 

In the first quarter of 2008 the review of the property data was completed and 18 BGC 

targets were selected for follow-up geochemical sampling.  42 holes were dug, for a total 

of 77.7 m.  A total of 91 soil/hand-auger samples plus one duplicate were collected and 

sent to ALS-Chemex in Mwanza for gold and multi-element ICP analysis together with 

three blanks and four standards.  The gold results were low with only one clearly 

anomalous sample at 11 ppb Au.  None of the BGC anomalies were confirmed.

9.5.2 2008 Follow-up Soil Sampling 

  

In the first quarter of 2008 the review of the property data was completed and 4 BGC 

targets were selected for follow-up geochemical sampling.  13 holes were dug, for a total 

of 35.0 m.  A further 51 holes totalling 92.8 m were dug in November 2008.  Two sites 

didn't provide a suitable sample so overall a total of 87 soil/hand-auger samples plus one 

duplicate were collected and sent to ALS-Chemex in Mwanza for gold and multi-element 

ICP analysis.  The gold results were low with none of the BGC anomalies confirmed.

10.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

 

The available information on the work by Tanzanian Royalty on the Kibara Project includes 

mostly brief descriptions of the sampling methods used to collect BLEG, soil, BGC and auger 

samples.  These descriptions are summarized below.  All sampling was carried out by personnel 

of TANCAN or Tanzam 2000, the Tanzanian subsidiaries of Tanzanian Royalty.  All samples 

were transported by company vehicle from site to the TANCAN house/office in Mwanza.   

 

10.1 BLEG Soils 

 

BLEG soils were generally collected on 400 m x 400 m or 400 x 200 m spacing over areas 

covered by lateritic soils.  At each site a hole was dug to approximately 50 cm depth and the soil 

from this depth was sieved on site.  Approximately 500 g of -80 mesh material was collected, 

bagged and sealed at site.  No further sample preparation was done by TANCAN/Tanzam 2000 

and the entire sample was sent to SGS in Mwanza for cyanide leach and AA analysis for gold.  

 

10.2 Conventional Soils 

 

The conventional soil sampling programs targeted the top of exposed or buried ferricrete or 

laterite, or a sample at a depth of 0.5 m. Transported soils such as black cotton clays (mbuga) 

were not sampled. The sampling was carried out by TANCAN/Tanzam 2000 staff, supported by 

local personnel.  Soil samples of between 1-2 kg were collected from holes dug to a depth of 50 

cm, or to the top of ferricrete and laterite horizons. All organic material and any other potential 

contamination was cleared from the surface prior to digging. Each sample was placed in a plastic 

bag together with a sample tag, before the bag was sealed using rope. The samples were laid out 

in sequential order for checking then placed into large rice bags for transport to the laboratory. 

The sample field notes included a description of the soil type, soil colour, and any rock type as 

set out by a standard company coding system. Each sample was assigned a number, in sequential 

order, from pre-made sample tag books. 

 

10.3 Biogeochemical (BGC) 

  

Tanzanian Royalty chose biogeochemistry (BGC) as its exploration method for identifying 

shallow gold deposits under transported overburden such as mbuga.  A company BGC sample 

preparation facility was set up in Mwanza to expedite the sample preparation.  From February to 

April 2004 TANCAN conducted 6 orientation surveys across known mineral deposits in 

Tanzania.  Although this orientation did not test over thick mbuga the results were sufficiently 

encouraging for BGC to be used as a grassroots exploration technique.  The orientation surveys 

showed that only the leaves of the plant need to be sampled, not the bark as well. Leaves were 

picked from around the circumference of the plant and stored in calico bags. Sample numbers 

were placed on the field sheet and recorded on the calico bags.  With the assistance of Colin 

Dunn and the Botany Department of the University of Dar Es Salaam, up to 15 tree and shrub 

species were identified as suitable for sampling. 

 

Each plant species was sampled in a standard manner in order to obtain a representative sample.  

Field duplicates were inserted after approximately every 20
th

 field sample to check on the 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 71 

 

uniformity of the actual plant sampling process, possible nugget effects for individual elements 

and what species might be affected by this.  Field duplicates were derived from a larger initial 

sample that was homogenized and split into the primary sample and it's duplicate.  Each sample 

was assigned a unique number, and the duplicates were submitted for analysis in the same batch 

as the originals.  

 

10.4 Auger Soils 

 

Auger holes were drilled by hand to a depth where bedrock, ferricrete, or impenetrable coarse 

gravels were intersected.  All organic material and any other potential contamination was cleared 

from the surface prior to use of the auger.  The material in the auger bit was placed in separate 

consecutive piles on a plastic sheet for logging.  It would appear from the auger database that 

each 1 metre (or less) interval was sampled, with the exception of the Q4 2008 sampling where a 

single (basal?) sample was taken.  It is not clear where in the interval the sample was taken.  

Normal practice is to sample the base of each interval, however.  Each sample was placed in a 

plastic bag together with a sample tag, before the bag was stapled shut.  The samples were laid 

out in sequential order for checking then placed into large rice bags for transport to the 

laboratory.  The sample field notes included a description of the entire profile intersected by the 

auger.  All sample equipment was washed after completion of each hole. 

 

10.5 Database 
 

For all geochemical methods TANCAN/Tanzam 2000 prepared spreadsheets with all sample 

location, description and analytical data as well as date of sampling, PL#, sample type and 

number. Much of the older sampling dates and laboratory information were recorded as 

"historic".  All data except the GPS location was recorded on field sheets and later transferred by 

hand to the computer files.  This data was also prepared for each licence or application area.  

Sample location data was controlled by hand-held Garmin GPS units and recorded in UTM 

coordinates using the ARC 1960 datum.  Analytical data was transferred to the database from the 

digital files received from the laboratory. 

 

The field sheets were especially detailed for the BGC sampling, with species type, age and 

height as well as drainage data recorded.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES and SECURITY 

 

11.1  Biogeochemistry 

 

All BGC samples were brought from the field by TANCAN/Tanzam 2000 vehicles and 

personnel and delivered to the company sample preparation facility in Mwanza.  This facility 

was designed and built in 2004 by TANCAN, the principal Tanzanian subsidiary of Tanzanian 

Royalty, when it became clear that sending raw vegetation samples to Acme Laboratories in 

Vancouver for preparation prior to analysis was too costly.  The facility has not undergone an 

external audit though regular checks have been made by the Exploration Manager. 

 

There is on-going debate among practitioners of biogeochemical exploration as to whether or not 

leaf samples should be washed prior to analysis. The orientation surveys conducted by TANCAN 

suggested that washing of leaf samples prior to analysis is not generally necessary. In areas 

where there may be dust contamination from artisanal mine sites, tailings dams, roads or RC 

drilling, the leaves should be washed.   Washing of the leaves might break down the outer cells 

of the leaves and release some elements into the washing medium. 

 

Samples were air-dried at the TANCAN sample preparation facility in an oven for 24 hours at 

70º C, in their calico sample bags. Several sample bags were stained brown from the tannins that 

were released during washing.  Dried leaves were further prepared by removing the stalks and 

any fibrous mid-ribs from the larger leaves, since these are typically of different composition 

from the main body of each leaf. Portions of 10-20 g were macerated (ground) to a powder in 

heavy-duty coffee grinders and placed in small cardboard envelopes. The coffee grinders were 

thoroughly cleaned after each sample.  Two samples were prepared from each pulp, one for 

dispatch by courier to Acme Laboratories in Vancouver for analysis, and one as an archive to be 

stored in Mwanza.  Field duplicates were collected during the surveys at approximately 5% 

frequency, and given a new number close to the original sample number.  Field duplicates were 

derived from a larger initial sample that was homogenized and split into the primary sample and 

it's duplicate, both of which were submitted for analysis in the same batch.  

 

ACME's standard procedure involved digesting 1g of each dry sample first in nitric acid and 

then in Aqua Regia, before analysis for gold + 37 elements by ICP-MS. 

 

11.2  Soil Samples 

 

In 2004 TANCAN set up its own sample preparation facility for soil samples in Mwanza.  On 

receipt in Mwanza, the samples were first sorted to ensure agreement with the samples listed on 

the field shipping order. The soil samples were then dried on aluminum trays in the open air or in 

ovens, depending on the weather. The samples were then disagglomerated with a wooden mortar 

and pestle, with the equipment being cleaned between samples. The samples were then passed 

through a #80 sieve, with an approximately 100 g sub-sample of the fines being stored in wire-

topped kraft envelopes and taken to ALS-Chemex in Mwanza.  Commercial standards and 

blanks were inserted in the sample stream by TANCAN, the objective being at least one field 

duplicate, one blank and one standard every 50 samples. 

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 73 

 

The wire-top kraft packets were dried at 80°C overnight at the ALS-Chemex facility prior to 

shipment to Johannesburg, South Africa. Shipping and customs clearance were completely 

handled by ALS-Chemex.  In Johannesburg the samples were homogenized prior to taking a split 

for analysis. Gold results were obtained by ALS's Au-ICP21 method whereby the 30 g split was 

fire-assayed with an ICP finish to a detection limit of 1 ppb Au. In addition a 34 element suite by 

ICP (method ME-ICP41) was requested for each sample. 

 

Soil samples taken from termite mounds were processed according to the procedure above.  

Soil/regolith samples obtained with the hand augers were dried in the same manner then passed 

through 425 micron (Tyler 35 mesh) sieves before approximately 100 g of the fines were sent to 

ALS-Chemex for gold by Au-ICP21 and other elements by ME-ICP41.  

 

ALS Chemex is the minerals division of ALS, a global company providing laboratory services to 

environmental, oil, food and pharmaceutical clients as well as to mining and exploration 

companies. The ALS group is owned by Campbell Brothers Limited, a publicly-listed Australian 

company.  ALS Chemex has been certified under ISO 9002 in Peru and Australia as well as by 

KPMG in Canada, USA and Mexico.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

 

12.1 Soils 

 

Quality control procedures for the analysis of conventional and auger soil samples included the 

insertion of blanks, duplicates and commercial standards with each batch of samples.  Blanks 

consisted of finely crushed/pulverized granite from Humac Laboratories in Mwanza, certified by 

them to have a gold analysis of <3 ppb Au.  These were inserted to check on possible 

contamination in the preparation process as well as the calibration in the analysis.  Field 

duplicates were taken to determine the repeatability of results and verify the reliability of the 

sampling procedure.  Pulp duplicates monitor the analytical precision as multiple assays are 

made from the same pulp.  Commercial standards prepared by Gannet of Australia were inserted 

to verify instrument calibration within acceptable limits.  Field duplicates were taken after 

approximately every 20
th 

sample while one blank and one standard were inserted for each 50 

samples. 

 

The standard reference materials were received from Gannet in 1 kg plastic bags and this 

pulverized material was split into samples of approximately 60 g and placed in the same kraft 

envelopes as the field samples.  The blanks were received from Humac in 40 kg pails, already 

crushed and pulverized.  As with the standards this material was transferred as 60 g samples into 

kraft envelopes.  All blanks and standards were kept under strict control by TANCAN's 

laboratory manager in Mwanza or by the Exploration Manager. 

 

ALS-Chemex have their own quality control procedures which involved the insertion of 

standard, blank and duplicate samples into every assay batch.   

 

Analyses of the standards used by Tanzanian Royalty for the Kibara Project program were 

generally acceptable, with all 12 used for the conventional soils returning gold results very close 

to their expected values.  Nine of the twelve standards used in the auger programs were similar, 

with two poor values for ST-299 and one for ST-195.  In each case the multi-element data 

confirmed the standard used and the other standards inserted in those sample batches were 

acceptable.  Most blanks returned values at or below the 1 ppb Au detection limit with the 

exception of one auger program blank at 5 ppb Au and one soil program blank at 4 ppb Au.  

Neither of these are thought to indicate any problems with sample preparation. 

 

The majority of the sample pairs that included duplicates were above the 1 ppb Au detection 

limit. Some variations occurred between the original samples and both auger and soil field 

duplicates, but none of concern given the sampling medium and the inherently low gold values. 

 

The 2002 BLEG soils were analyzed at SGS Laboratories in Mwanza.  No assay certificates or 

description of QC were available but the method does not lend itself to conventional QC 

procedures.  There is no preparation of the samples hence there is little need for blanks.  The 

entire 500 g sample from the field is used in the analysis so no lab duplicates are possible.  It is 

impractical at the geochemical level to use standards and the author is not aware of any 

commercial standards that are certified for the BLEG method.

12.2 Biogeochemical (BGC) Sampling 

 

The precision and accuracy of the analysis were monitored through the insertion of field and 

preparation (laboratory) duplicates as well as and one or more standards with known values.  

ACME Analytical Laboratories ("ACME"), who carried out the analysis, routinely carry out 

repeat-sample measurements to test their own accuracy.  Field duplicates were taken, always 

from the same species, to check on the uniformity of the actual plant sampling process, possible 

nugget effects for individual elements and what species might be affected by this.  The 

laboratory duplicates were intended to check on possible nugget effects for individual elements 

as well as uniformity and possible contamination in the sample preparation process. 
 

The BGC QC protocol requires the field crews to take field duplicates after every 20 samples and 

the laboratory staff to insert laboratory duplicates after every 20 samples processed.  In the 

Kibara BGC programs, however, only 161 field duplicates were collected versus a total of 4462 

field samples, well short of the 1 in 20 rule.  A total of 194 laboratory duplicates were inserted in 

the sample stream, again well short of 1 in 20.  For each collected sample and field duplicate 20g 

of prepared material is submitted for analysis.  When the reserve fraction of the sample 

designated for a laboratory duplicate was insufficient, the closest sample with a large enough 

reserve fraction was selected for the duplicate, resulting in varying laboratory duplicate ratios for 

individual licences.  Standards inserted by ACME included 109 V13 and 42 V14.

ACME have their own internal quality control procedures that include samples from bulk 

mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) foliage collected from the vicinity of an unworked 

epithermal gold deposit on Vancouver Island.   

 

Two external plant standards were prepared by biogeochemistry consultant Dr. C. Dunn.  

Standard V13 with gold value of 0.47 ppb Au was the principal standard used, but its value was 

only approximate and described by Dunn in a previous report as "not yet fully characterized".  

Standard V14 was used for PL 3146/2005.  No target value was available for this standard, 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 78 

 

however.  The external standards were inserted at approximately one per 30 primary samples.  

ACME also carried out repeat sampling to test their precision. 

 

The author selected Ag, As, Au, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni and Zn as elements to be reviewed.  Of these the 

Au and As results for field duplicate pairs, laboratory duplicate pairs and standards were 

particularly variable while the other elements generally showed good to excellent correlation.

The comparison of field duplicates is typical of the pattern when analyzing vegetation 

tissue at a detection limit of 0.1 ppb Au.  A significant number of the duplicate pairs 

(which were always taken from the same species) are within acceptable limits while 6 of 

the pairs show variable degrees of nugget effect.  This is common at this level when there 

is a non-uniform distribution of metals within the plant biomass.

The pattern of field duplicates for PL 2785/2004 is similar to that for PL 2308/2003, with 

a majority (39) of the pairs within acceptable limits for Au and 40 for As.  The other 10 

Au and 9 As duplicate pairs showed variable degrees of nugget effect.  The laboratory 

duplicates were similarly variable.  The V13 standards showed a significant variance 

from the expected value for 10 of the 38 samples, within a range of 0.1-1.2 ppb Au.  

Other elements reviewed were essentially within acceptable limits.

The pattern of field duplicates for PL 2931/2004 is similar to that for PL 2308/2003, with 

a majority of the pairs (41 of 50) within acceptable limits for Au.   A high proportion of 

pairs reported one or both samples at the detection limit of 0.1 ppb Au.  A similar 

situation occurs with the laboratory duplicates, with 16 pairs showing significant nugget 

effects for Au and 15 for As.  The V13 standards showed particularly poor correlation 

with the expected value of 0.40 ppb Au with values ranging from 0.1-1.7 ppb Au.  This 

group of standards was unusual in also having 5 significantly low results for Ni.

eight for As and 5 for Hg.  As with PL 2931/2004 the variability was higher with the 

laboratory duplicates for each of Au, As and Hg.  The V14 standards used in the analysis 

of sample batches from this licence showed a typical variability for Au with lesser 

variability for Ag and Hg.

Two of the three duplicate pairs from PL 3314/2005 showed what is probably a slight 

nugget effect within the leaves, as did two of the five laboratory duplicate pairs, although 

all gold values were at or close to the detection limit of 0.1 ppb Au.  The five V13 

standards included two with significant nugget effects, of 1.1 and 4.8 ppb Au versus the 

expected value of 0.4 ppb Au.

Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 85 

 

13.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

The Kibara Project of Tanzanian Royalty is at an early exploration stage.  The property is located 

in the Lake Victoria Goldfields area within the Musoma-Mara Belt, one of the principal 

Archaean greenstone belts of Tanzania.  The bedrock lithologies at Kibara are dominated by 

Nyanzian-age (Archaean) mafic volcanics, intruded by granites.  These rocks host most of the 

gold mines and deposits in Tanzania and are both similar and time-equivalent to the greenstones 

of northern Ontario and Quebec.  The Kibara Project lies about 145 km southwest of Barrick's 

North Mara gold mine. 

 
Tanzanian Royalty commenced exploration on the Kibara Project in 2002 with mini-BLEG 

sampling in the precursor to PL 2308/2003.  This was followed by rock and termite mound 

sampling to validate BLEG anomalies and then by trenching, biogeochemical (BGC) sampling 

and gradient IP surveys.  The other licences were covered with BGC sampling, mapping and 

chip sampling and limited auger soil follow-up.  None of the geochemical or other targets 

throughout the Kibara Project have yet been tested with any form of drilling. 

 
The trenching on Nyakona Hill in PL 2308/2003 exposed a gossanous quartz vein with up to 

40% malachite in a felsic tuff/feldspar porphyry package.  Neither the later soil sampling nor IP 

gradient survey were able to confirm the extent of the mineralization beyond the 160 m of strike 

shown in the trenches.  This mineralization, however, with gold values up to 14.80 g/t Au and 

copper up to 29.15 % Cu, constitutes the principal target on the property for follow-up with RC 

drilling. 

 

On PL 2785/2004 the central part of the licence is underlain by mafic volcanic rocks and 

includes an abandoned artisanal mining site.  Grab samples from the muck piles confirmed the 

presence of gold mineralization with values up to 18.75 g/t Au.  Soil and BGC sampling were 

unable to confirm a mineralized system around the artisanal workings, but a gradient IP grid did 

reveal a chargeability anomaly.  Further work should be done in the area around the artisanal 

workings, primarily fences of heel-to-toe RAB drill holes along the projected strike of the 

artisanal zone. 

 

On PL 2931/2004 the greenstone rocks of the Kurwirwi Hills returned no significant gold values 

from grab sampling during the mapping program.  Scattered BGC gold anomalies across the 

property were followed up with auger soil sampling, but none of the BGC anomalies were 

confirmed.   

 

On PL 3146/2005 BGC sampling returned generally low gold results, with weak anomalies 

scattered across the property.  Follow-up soil sampling on 7 BGC targets returned only low gold 

values, except for 221 ppb Au from one sample in lacustrine sediments.  This is not considered 

significant for bedrock gold mineralization.   

 

Similarly on PL 3314/2005 two weak BGC gold anomalies were followed up with soil sampling 

that failed to confirm the anomalies. 

 

 



Report on the Kibara Mineral Exploration Property of Tanzanian Royalty 86 

 

 

Initial preparation of soil samples was done by Tanzanian Royalty at their own facility in 

Mwanza.  All other preparation and analysis was carried out at internationally-recognized 

laboratories with ISO certification.  The quality-control programs implemented by Tanzanian 

Royalty conform to industry standards and show that the sampling procedures and analyses 

received were acceptable.  The author is of the opinion that the programs were carried out in a 

professional manner, to industry-standard procedures. 

 

The favourable lithogies and presence of significant gold mineralization in trenches on Nyakona 

Hill in PL 2308/2003 and in artisanal gold workings in PL 2785/2004 make those two areas in 

the Kibara Project targets for initial RAB/RC drilling.

14.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

In the next phases of work at the Kibara Project Tanzanian Royalty should focus on initial RAB 

and/or RC drilling on the two principal targets at Nyakona Hill on PL 2308/2003 and the 

artisanal workings on PL 2785/2004.  The objectives would be to confirm the existence at depth 

of gold/copper-in-quartz mineralization sampled in the trenches at Nyakona Hill and to extend 

the gold mineralization in the artisanal workings.  This should be done with lines of heel-to-toe 

RAB or RC drilling, possibly preceded by additional trenching on Nyakona Hill to extend the 

surface strike of the mineralization.   

 

In the situation for most exploration companies, where they have to hire contract drillers, the cost 

of this work would mandate most if not all of the drilling in Phase I would be done with a RAB 

rig.  Tanzanian Royalty, however, has an in-house drill rig and can justify using an RC string.  

While slower, RC would provide a larger sample as well as being less prone to sample 

contamination during drilling.  In this instance RC data could potentially be used for resource 

purposes in the future. 

 

If the Phase I RAB/RC program provides suitable confirmation of mineralization and significant 

intersections at either or both target areas, the next phase should consist of additional RC drilling 

to expand the mineralization from Phase I along strike and to depth.

In the author's opinion, the character of the Kibara Property and its current stage of exploration 

are of sufficient merit to justify the nature and scale of the programs outlined above. The budgets 

are considered appropriate by the author.
