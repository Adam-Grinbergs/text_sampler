Foreword 
 

On June 25, 2018, Aftermath Silver Ltd. (Aftermath) announced that it entered into a definitive 

agreement with Apogee Opportunities Inc. (Apogee Opportunities) to purchase their holding in the 

Cachinal De La Sierra Silver-Gold Project (Cachinal Project) through the of purchase of Apogee 

Opportunities' shares in the Chilean holding company Minera Cachinal S.A., representing 80 percent 

ownership. This technical report was originally prepared for Valencia Ventures Inc. (Valencia) and 

was subsequently re-addressed to Apogee Minerals Ltd (Apogee) on February 9, 2010 and amended 

on July 8, 2010. It is now being readdressed to Aftermath on October 30, 2019 to support the 

original disclosure of a Mineral Resources Statement prepared by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. 

(SRK) on April 30, 2008. 

 

The Mineral Resource Statement documented in the original technical report dated April 30, 2008 

released by Valencia Ventures Inc. (Valencia) considered drilling and trenching information up to 

January 25, 2008. Drilling on the property was ongoing at that time. Subsequent to the technical 

report, Valencia completed an additional 17 core boreholes, 43 reverse circulation boreholes and five 

geotechnical core boreholes (the "subsequent drilling"). The subsequent drilling aimed at infilling 

the deposit to 50-metre sections in the northern part of the deposit, testing the depth extensions of the 

deposit below the mineral resources and testing other exploration targets outside the resource areas. 

Some of the exploration targets investigated by the subsequent drilling were recommended in the 

April 30, 2008 technical report. 

 

Apogee made available to SRK the results from the subsequent drilling. SRK reviewed the location, 

geology and assaying results for the subsequent drilling. In the professional opinion of the qualified 

persons authoring this technical report, the subsequent drilling results would not materially impact 

on the mineral resource evaluation prepared by SRK as documented in the original April 30, 2008 

technical report. The results of the subsequent drilling were considered to modify the 

recommendations for additional drilling expressed in the April 30, 2008 technical report except for 

the targets actually tested. As a consequence, SRK considers that the Mineral Resource Statement for 

the Cachinal Project documented in the April 30, 2008 technical report remains current. The same 

Mineral Resource Statement was re-addressed to Apogee in a technical report prepared by SRK 

dated February 9, 2010 and amended on July 8, 2010. This same Mineral Resource Statement is still 

regarded as current and is now being re-addressed to Aftermath on June 3, 2019.  

 

In the professional opinion of SRK it is not justified to revise the mineral resource evaluation for the 

Cachinal Project until exploration drilling program recommended in the April 30, 2008 technical 

report is fully completed. Apart from the few targets tested by the subsequent drilling, the 

conclusions and recommendations remain current. 

 

SRK is therefore of the opinion that it is appropriate to readdress the latest technical report for the 

Cachinal Project (dated July 8, 2010) to Aftermath. The following re-addressed technical report is 

similar to the July 8, 2010 technical report. 

 

In this technical report, the legal aspects, mineral tenure, and illustrations have been updated to 

reflect status of the property.

1 Executive Summary 
 

1.1 Introduction 
 

On June 25, 2018, Aftermath Silver Ltd. (Aftermath) announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with 

Apogee Opportunities Inc. (Apogee Opportunities) to purchase their holding in the Cachinal De La Sierra 

Silver-Gold Project (Cachinal Project) through the of purchase of Apogee Opportunities' shares in the Chilean 

holding company Minera Cachinal S.A., representing 80 percent ownership. 

 

This technical report originally prepared for Valencia Ventures Inc. (Valencia) and subsequently re-addressed 

for Apogee is now being readdressed to Aftermath on August 7, 2018 to support the original disclosure of a 

Mineral Resources Statement prepared by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) on April 30, 2008. 

 

The Cachinal project is a resource delineation stage silver-zinc-gold exploration project located in the Cachinal 

de la Sierra area in the Region II of Chile. It is located approximately 175 kilometres southeast of Antofagasta, 

Chile. The project encloses several silver occurrences including the Cachinal silver-gold deposit that is an 

exploration focus of Aftermath.  

 

During the third quarter of 2007, Valencia commissioned SRK to review and audit the exploration work 

undertaken by Valencia, and to prepare a revised mineral resource estimate for the Cachinal silver-gold 

deposit. This technical report documents the resource model constructed by SRK. It was prepared following 

the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, and 

in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best 

Practice Guidelines."  SRK visited the Cachinal project on October 10, 2007. 

 

1.2 Property Description and Agreements 
 

Minera Cachinal S.A. was formed on December 9, 2013 from the division of the assets owned by Minera 

Silver Standard Chile S.A (Minera Silver). Minera Silver had two controlling partners: (i) Silver Standard 

Resources, Inc. (SSR) and (ii) Silver Standard Ventures, Inc. (SSV). 

 

Minera Silver was divided into three companies: (i) Minera Silver Standard Chile S.A (Minera Silver), (ii) 

Minera Cachinal S.A (Minera Cachinal), and (iii) Minera Juncal y La Flora S.A (Minera Juncal). The assets 

were divided among the resulting companies: 96 mining concessions for Minera Silver, 11 mining concessions 

for Minera Cachinal and 11 mining concessions for Minera Juncal. 

 

The Cachinal Project is comprised of sixteen Chile mining concessions (Table 1) covering an aggregate area of 

approximately 4,867 hectares, comprising of the 11 mining concessions gained from Minera Silver (3,387 ha) 

in 2014 and an additional 5 mining concessions (the Cachinal claim group) purchased from Compañia Minera 

Valencia Ventures Chile Limitada in 2016. The property boundaries have not been legally surveyed. 

 

1.3 Location, Access and Physiography 
 

The closest community to the Cachinal project is the township of Taltal, with a population of about 11,000, 

which is approximately 170 kilometres from the project. Taltal is located 306 kilometres south of Antofagasta 

and 25 kilometres from Route 5, with no local public transportation to Antofagasta. Mining is the primary 

activity for the community of Taltal.  

 

Access to the project area from the Pan American Highway is along a sand and gravel road. Numerous 

secondary tracks provide easy access to all parts of the project area. The center of the property is located at 

69.5333 degrees longitude west and 24.9716 degrees latitude south. The property and the region have no 

established towns or villages and electricity or water supply.

The project is located in the Atacama Desert, considered to be the driest desert of Chile. The west and south 

sides of the property are comprised of gentle rolling terrain, with rounded hill tops, while the central and 

eastern parts of the property form slightly inclined to nearly flat plain. Elevation varies between 2,690 and 

3,150 metres above sea level.  There is no sharp contrast in temperature between seasons. The average 

temperature of the coldest month (July) is 11.8°C and the average temperature for the hottest month (January) 

is 19.2°C. The daily variation is significant, ranging from a maximum of 33.5°C to a minimum of 2.3°C. 

Exploration work can be carried out year-round.  

 

1.4 History 
 

Although different references give conflicting dates about the early history of the Cachinal de la Sierra district, 

it appears that initial mineral activities began during the 1850s focussing on silver mineralization. Gold was 

discovered 10 to 20 years later in the Guanaco District about fourteen kilometres to the south of Cachinal. 

 

Silver was first produced in the district in 1875 and production continued uninterrupted from 1880 to 1930. 

The total historic production was estimated to be approximately 1,000 tonnes of silver (about 32 million 

ounces). Independent miners intermittently mined the area when silver prices were relatively high in the early 

1980s, from 1985 to 1987 and in the early 1990s. Unverifiable records suggest that between 1985 and 1987 a 

total of 170,639 tonnes were mined at an average grade of 280 grams of silver per tonne ("g/t silver") and 0.58 

g/t gold. 

 

1.5 Regional and Local Geology 
 

The Cachinal project area is located within the Paleocene Gold Belt of northern Chile, which hosts several 

significant gold and silver deposits. The known Cachinal veins are all located within and near the western 

margin of the Cachinal volcanic caldera that is approximately 30 kilometres in diameter and developed in 

Paleocene-Eocene volcanic rocks assigned to the Chile-Alemania Formation. This bimodal rhyo-andesite 

sequence is widely distributed throughout the Antofagasta Region.  

 

The western margin of the caldera is characterised by a chain of dacite flow domes and their related dacite to 

andesite lava.  The southern end of the dome chain appears to be related to the high sulphidation epithermal El 

Guanaco Gold district. 

 

The center of the district is underlain by a propylitic-altered diorite stock and related andesite lavas, covered by 

rhyodacite, ash-flow tuff with co-genetic porphyry facies. The rhyodacite and ash-flow tuff are overlain by and 

interbedded with reddish volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and dacite to andesite lava.  

 

The age of the diorite stock ranges from 62 to 60 million years. This sequence is intruded by dacite flow-

domes to the west. The diorite stock in turn intrudes the rhyodacite tuff and the volcaniclastic sedimentary 

rocks. A flat relief plain composed of colluvial and alluvial loose sediments covers a buried sequence of green 

coloured conglomerate and sandstone sedimentary rocks to the east of Cachinal. 

 

1.6 Deposit Types and Mineralization 
 

The Cachinal project was assembled by Valencia for its potential to host low and high sulphidation epithermal 

silver and gold deposits. Epithermal deposits comprise a wide clan of hydrothermal deposits associated with 

volcanic and magmatic edifices and formed by the circulation of hydrothermal fluids into fractured rocks. 

Exploration work in this area has uncovered several precious metal (silver, gold-silver and silver-gold 

associated with base metals) deposits and occurrences exhibiting characteristics indicative of epithermal 

hydrothermal systems. 

 

The Cachinal silver-gold deposit is the most important exploration target on the Cachinal project. This deposit 

was mined from underground workings during the twentieth century and drilling by Valencia since 2005 has 

delineated a near surface silver, gold and zinc mineral resource associated with a network of steeply dipping 

north to northwest trending low-sulphide quartz veins.

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

 

The epithermal veins and breccias have been recognized by trenching and drilling over a strike length of at 

least two kilometres and are known to have been mined to a depth of at least 300 metres. They range in 

thickness from a few centimetres to two metres, reaching up to twenty metres locally at the intersection of two 

structures. The main veins trend north-northwest and north-west with a secondary set trending east-northeast to 

east-west, best developed at the southern end of the deposit. 

 

1.7 Exploration and Drilling 
 

All exploration work completed by Valencia at Cachinal since 2004 was conducted by SBX Consultores Ltda. 

("SBX"), an independent consultant. The exploration work included: 

 

• 219 inclined reverse circulation boreholes (over 31,000 metres). 

• 27 core boreholes (6,241 metres).  

• 43 trenches (2,076 metres). 

• 129 line-kilometres of ground electromagnetic surveying (VLF-EM). 

• 955 line-kilometres of ground magnetic surveying. 

• 1,109 soil geochemical samples (200-400 metre lines and 50-100 metre stations). 
 

Drilling was conducted by Terra Services S.A. and Perfo Chile Ltda. Boreholes have been drilled on 50 to 100 

metres sections to sample the Cachinal mineralization to a depth of 40 to 200 metres below the surface. All 

borehole collars were surveyed using a theodolite and reported in UTM coordinates (PSAD-56 datum). The 

drilling area extends approximately two kilometres in strike length. Downhole deviation was monitored in 56 

reverse circulation boreholes using a gyroscope. The remaining reverse circulation boreholes could not be 

probed. Eleven of the core holes were surveyed for downhole deviation using a Maxibore device or a 

gyroscope.  

 

Valencia completed an additional seventeen core boreholes, forty-three reverse circulation boreholes and five 

geotechnical core boreholes (the "subsequent drilling"). The subsequent drilling aimed at infilling the deposit 

to fifty metre sections in the northern part of the deposit, testing the depth extensions of the deposit below the 

mineral resources and testing other exploration targets outside the resource areas 

 

1.8 Sampling Method, Approach and Analyses 
 

Limited details are available for the sampling procedures used by previous project operators. No historical 

sampling was used for estimating the Cachinal mineral resources.  

 

Valencia used industry best practices to collect, handle and assay soil, trench, reverse circulation chips and 

core samples of the Cachinal silver mineralization. All assay samples were prepared and assayed by ALS-

Chemex Laboratory in Antofagasta and La Serena, Chile that are accredited ISO 9001 by NCS International 

Pty. The La Serena Laboratory is also accredited under ISO 17025 (INN LE 246) by the Instituto Nacional de 

Normalization of Chile for a number of specific test procedures. The analytical protocols used by Valencia are 

not within scope of the accreditation. 

 

Samples were assayed for gold by conventional fire assay, and silver and zinc using multi-acid digestion and 

atomic absorption spectrometry. Valencia relied on the laboratory internal quality control measures but 

implemented increasing external control measures consisting of inserting an appropriate frequency of quality 

control samples (blanks, project specific standards and certified reference standards) with each batch of trench, 

reverse circulation and core drilling samples submitted for assaying. The quality control program developed by 

Valencia for this project is mature and overseen by appropriately qualified geologists. 

 

1.9 Data Verifications 
 

During the fourth quarter of 2007, Valencia mandated Maxwell GeoServices (Maxwell) from Australia to 

review, compile and verify the Cachinal exploration database.  In its review of analytical quality control data, 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page vii 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

Maxwell did not uncover any material issues with the quality of the assaying data for the Cachinal project. 

Maxwell noted few control sample failures.  

 

In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the Cachinal project on October 10, 

2007 while active drilling was ongoing.  The purpose of the site visit was to inspect the property and ascertain 

the geological setting of the Cachinal deposit, witness the extent of exploration work and assess logistical 

aspects and other constraints relating to conducting exploration work in the area. SRK was given full access to 

project data. 

 

SRK reviewed the report produced by Maxwell and visually examined assay results for the internal quality 

control samples used by the assay laboratory and found no suspicious or anomalous results. SRK aggregated 

the assay results for the external quality control samples for further analysis, focussing exclusively on assay 

results for silver, gold and zinc. After review, SRK is of the opinion that the analytical results delivered by 

ALS-Chemex are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of resource estimation. SRK identified a number of 

sample mislabelling issues, especially mislabelling of control samples. SRK concurs with Maxwell's 

recommendations for improvement in sample labelling procedures. 

 

The Cachinal silver-bearing mineralization was sampled by surface trenches and by reverse circulation and 

core drilling. SRK conducted certain verifications to ensure that the three sample supports yielded 

geostatistically comparable silver assay results. In general, SRK considers that, for the main silver grade ranges 

observed in the Cachinal deposit, there is no significant bias between each sample support and that, therefore, 

all three sample types can be used for resource estimation. 

 

In 2007 and 2008, Valencia drilled eleven core holes to reproduce eleven reverse circulation intersections. The 

analysis of the twin hole data suggests that the core boreholes delivered on average lower grades for all three 

metals considered. Not only the core holes failed to reproduce the average grades of each intercept, but the 

widths of silver-bearing mineralization are also different. Analysis of Q-Q' plots suggest that reverse 

circulation boreholes deliver higher grades than core boreholes for all grade categories, except for zinc. The 

difference in grade distribution may be in part attributed to the wireframe interpretation or high variability of 

metal grades across short ranges that are not unusual for epithermal vein deposits. The quality control data 

does not highlight any material bias between the two drilling types. Accordingly, SRK cannot draw 

conclusions from the limited twin hole data available. 

 

1.10 Mineral Resource Estimation 
 

The mineral resource model presented herein represents the second mineral resource evaluation for the 

Cachinal silver-gold deposit. An earlier resource model was prepared in February 2007 by Gonzales and Diaz 

using a polygonal method on vertical sections. The current resource estimate was completed by Mr. Glen Cole, 

PGeo an independent qualified person as this term is defined in National Instrument 43-101. The effective date 

of this resource estimate is June 3, 2019.  

 

Eleven north to northwest trending silver-bearing vein wireframes were constructed to constrain geostatistical 

analysis and grade estimation using a geological interpretation prepared by SBX personnel using assaying data 

over a minimum width of two metres. Two sets of faults and four lithological wireframes were also modelled. 

The impact of the mined-out areas on the resource model was considered at the geological modelling stage. 

Modelled veins are considered as remnants of the veins left behind the historical mine. SRK considers this 

approach represents a reasonable interpretation for the "in situ" silver-bearing veins with the current level of 

information available about the historical mining. Further investigations are required for feasibility level work. 

 

A total of 3,293 data points was extracted from the eleven modelled veins for statistical analysis. All assay 

samples were composited to equal 1-metre lengths. Grade capping was assessed using probability plots for 

assays samples within each domain. In general, the silver, gold and zinc composites belong to a single 

population, requiring minimal outlier treatment. Only three silver, two gold and four zinc composites were 

capped. 

 

A Datamine sub-block routine was used to fill the vein wireframes with blocks aligned with the local UTM 

grid (PSAD-56 datum). Each vein mineralization block was assigned a density of 2.43 grams per cubic 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page viii 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

centimetre and waste blocks were assigned an average bulk density of 2.45 grams per cubic centimetre, based 

on a database containing 289 measurements on core samples. Parent block size was sent at 3 by 5 by 5 metres 

(minimum block size of 0.75 by 1.25 by 1.25 metres). A regularized block model was also generated from the 

detailed sub-block model for the pit optimization. 

 

Variograms were used to assess grade continuity along various ellipse axes and to determine appropriate grade 

interpolation ranges. Normal-score variography was conducted with Isatis software for silver, gold and zinc. A 

single spherical structure variogram (including a nugget effect) was constructed and fitted for each modelled 

vein and direction for silver, gold and zinc (with rotation angles relative to the vein parallel reference plane set 

at primary = N340, secondary = N070). 

 

Metal grades were estimated into the block model using ordinary kriging and search neighbourhood parameters 

adjusted from variography results. Metal grades were estimated using two estimation runs for each modelled 

vein. The first pass considered full variogram ranges to estimate block grades assigned to Indicated Mineral 

Resources. The second pass considered three times the variogram ranges to estimate metal grades for Inferred 

Mineral Resources. A third estimation run was completed to assign metal grades to the blocks surrounding the 

silver-bearing veins. The average mining dilution grade was determined from the average of all composites 

located outside the modelled veins, but within an enveloping 'low grade shell' defined by considering all drill 

data (this includes 11,749 data points).  

 

The Cachinal mineral resources were classified according to the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 10, 2014) by Glen Cole, PGeo (APGO #1416), an appropriate 

independent qualified person for the purpose of National Instrument 43-101. Resource blocks are informed by 

a minimum of four a maximum of twenty composites. Resource blocks situated within the primary ranges 

defined by variography are assigned an Indicated classification. All other resource blocks situated within three 

times the maximum variography ranges are assigned an Inferred classification. 

 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement was assessed by considering the most likely 

extraction scenarios for the vein mineralization taking into account processing recoveries. SRK believes that 

portions of the Cachinal deposit are amenable for open pit extraction, while the deeper parts of the deposit 

could be extracted using an underground mining method. 

 

In order to determine the quantities of material offering reasonable prospects for economic extraction by an 

open pit, SRK used Minesight and the Lerchs-Grossman optimizing algorithm, which evaluates the 

profitability of each resource block based on its value. The optimization parameters are based on ongoing 

scoping studies undertaken by SRK on the Cachinal project. The reader is cautioned that the results from the 

pit optimization are used solely for the purpose of reporting mineral resources that have "reasonable prospects" 

for economic extraction by an open pit. 

 

After review of several scenarios considering different metal prices, design criteria and operating costs 

assumptions, SRK is of the opinion that the portion of the Cachinal silver deposit above a 40 g/t silver-

equivalent grade and situated between the surface and approximately 150 metres depth shows "reasonable 

prospects" for economic extraction via open cast mining. SRK considers that the silver mineralization located 

below that elevation is amenable for underground mining using a cut-off of 150 g/t silver-equivalent to reflect 

the higher costs associated with underground mining. Silver equivalent grades were derived using metal price 

assumptions of US$12.50 per ounce of silver, US$650 per ounce of gold and metallurgical recoveries of 

eighty-five percent for silver and gold. Zinc does not contribute to revenues (Table i). 

 

SRK undertook a sensitivity analysis to determine if the application of current (2017 / 2018) metal prices and 

cost inputs would have a material impact on the dimensions of the conceptual pit shell being referenced during 

mineral resource reporting. It was found that the application of current metal prices and costs did not lead to a 

deep or larger conceptual pit shell. It seems likely that the positive impact of increased metal prices has been 

neutralized by the negative impact of higher mining and processing costs. SRK is therefore satisfied that 

applying the vertical elevation of 150 metres is still appropriate to segregate mineral resources amenable to 

open pit mining from that that amenable to underground mining. SRK has recently verified that the application 

of current metal prices (and costs) will not have a material impact on the silver equivalency formula, reporting 

cut-off grades and on the reported mineral resources.

metal price assumptions of US$12.50 per ounce of silver, US$650 per ounce of gold and metallurgical 
recoveries of eighty-five percent for silver and gold. Zinc does not contribute to revenues.

The SRK 2019 mineral resource statement supersedes an earlier mineral resource model prepared by Gonzales 

and Diaz (as reported in a technical report dated February 14, 2007; the "Gonzalez and Diaz model").  

 

The direct comparison between the SRK resource model with the Gonzalez and Diaz February 2007 polygonal 

model is difficult, because the two models consider different areas and are reported using different reporting 

assumptions. 

 

The Gonzales and Diaz model considered sampling information from 42 reverse circulation and 40 surface 

trenches in the southern portion of the Cachinal silver deposit (00 metre SSE to 800 metres SSE). The mineral 

resources were estimated using a polygonal methodology. A total of 128 polygons were constructed and 

assigned a grade based on the weighted average grade of the borehole or trench assay data. Inferred polygons 

metal grades were derived from the nearest adjacent Indicated polygons. Where sufficient information was 

available, mined out areas were excluded from the interpreted vein polygons. An average specific gravity of 

2.5 was used to convert volumes into tonnages. Mineral resources were tabulated at various cut-off grades and 

reported at a cut-off grade of 20.0 g/t silver, without considering gold revenues and metallurgical recoveries. 

 

The SRK model extends over the entire strike length of the deposit (from sections 1,250 metres NNW to 1,000 

metres SSE) and includes resource blocks to a depth of 250 metres. The SRK mineral resources were estimated 

using a geostatistical block modelling approach constrained by vein mineralization wireframes interpreted 

from the drilling data. Mined out areas were removed during wireframing. The mineral resources are reported 

using a silver equivalent grade taking into account reasonable metallurgical recoveries. 

 

The impact of using a silver equivalent grade to report resources is that the SRK global quantities and grades 

are marginally larger than if a silver cut-off was applied. The differences are not material to the comparison. 

 

At a cut-off grade of 40 g/t silver-equivalent considered by SRK to be reasonable for reporting open pit 

resources for this project, the SRK model reports approximately 43 percent less tonnes and 50 percent less 

silver and gold. At the cut-off grade used by Gonzales and Diaz, the SRK model forecasts approximately 45 

percent less silver and gold for a tonnage approximately 25 percent less. At all cut-off grades global quantities 

and grades are considerably less than those predicted by the Gonzalez and Diaz model.  

 

SRK is also of the opinion that the application of a silver equivalency formula based on 2017/2018 metal 

prices will also not have a material difference on the reported mineral resources, primarily due to the low gold 

grades intersected within the modeled veins.

1.11 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 

In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource classification reported herein are a 

reasonable representation of the global silver, gold and zinc mineral resources found in the Cachinal deposit. 

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no 

certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 

 

In reviewing the mineral resource model, SRK draws the following conclusions: 

 

• A cut-off of 40 g/t silver-equivalent is considered appropriate for potential opencast mining resources. 

• The SRK model reports approximately 43 percent less tonnes and 50 percent less silver and gold at a 
cut-off grade of 40 g/t used by Gonzales and Diaz. 

• The SRK model forecasts approximately 45 percent less silver and gold for a tonnage approximately 
25 percent less at a cut-off grade used by Gonzales and Diaz. 

• At all cut-off grades, global quantities and grades are considerably less than those predicted by the 
Gonzalez and Diaz model. 

• A drilling spacing at 25 to 30 metres should allow conversion of Indicated to Measured mineral 
resources. 

 

The geological and mineral resource models were reviewed to identify any potential target areas warranting 

additional drilling. Three types of targets are identified: vein extensions, new vein structures and infill drilling 

around poor drilling results. Each target was assessed in terms of size, quality of the potential silver vein 

mineralization and potential quantities and grades. 

 

When the April 2008 technical report was prepared, drilling at Cachinal was ongoing. Subsequent to the 

preparation of that technical report Valencia completed an additional seventeen core boreholes, forty-three 

reverse circulation boreholes and five geotechnical core boreholes (the "subsequent drilling"). The subsequent 

drilling aimed at infilling the deposit to fifty metre sections in the northern part of the deposit, testing the depth 

extensions of the deposit below the mineral resources and testing other exploration targets outside the resource 

areas. Some of the subsequent drilling tested some recommended drilling targets. In consideration for the 

subsequent drilling, the recommended drilling program was revised by SRK on February 9, 2010 to remove 

targets tested by the subsequent drilling. The revised recommended drilling program comprises seventy-nine 

boreholes totalling 11,800 metres. 

 

SRK propose a phased approach to advancing the Cachinal project. In addition to the strategic exploration 

drilling outlined above, additional exploration and engineering activities such as satellite surveys, database 

management and metallurgical testwork will need to be undertaken. SRK support the Phase 1 exploration 

program proposed by Aftermath, which is estimated to cost C$655,000. 

 

SRK is satisfied that the disclosure of mineral potential follows the National Instrument 43-101 guidelines in 

relation to mineral disclosure of exploration targets. The mineral potential is expressed as a range of quantity 

and grade, with explanation of the basis of the statement. Mineral potential is only recognized where supported 

by one or more intersections with grade and width that meet current economic parameters for mineral 

resources, or where the lateral extent of mineralization is supported by physical sampling that indicates 

economic parameters will be met, or where the lateral extent of mineralization is known and its characteristics 

may be assessed on the basis of immediately adjacent similar, economically delineated mineralization. 

 

The mineral potential was evaluated by SRK to provide a range of quantities and grades for each target and 

assist Aftermath management to prioritize the recommended drilling program. The summary statement of 

potential for each target is expressed explicitly on the basis that the potential range of quantity and grade is 

conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if 

additional drilling will result in the delineation of a mineral resource on the targets. 

 

For each target, a polygonal interpretation of the potential vein structure was constructed and sub-divided at 

the 150-metre depth threshold used for reporting open pit resources. The ranges of quantity are obtained by 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd.

multiplying the surface area of the potential vein structure by its potential ranges of thicknesses, based on 

existing drilling information and observed thickness variations for each specific vein structure. The potential 

quantities above cut-off were estimated using the grade tonnage characteristics specific to the Cachinal deposit. 

The open pit mineral resources reported at a cut-off of 40 g/t silver equivalent grade to a depth of 150 metres 

represent approximately 44 percent of the tonnage for the modelled silver-bearing vein structures. Conversely, 

the underground mineral resource reported at 150 g/t silver equivalent grade represent only five percent of the 

tonnage contained in the modelled veins. Accordingly, the ranges of open pit and underground quantities of 

potential mineralization are obtained by multiplying the ranges of vein quantity by the ratio above cut-off. 

 

The aggregated mineral potential for the Cachinal deposit is estimated at between 1.1 and 2.8 million tonnes 

grading between 80 to 120 g/t silver, or between 2.9 and 10.9 million potential ounces of silver to a depth of 

150 metres. The underground mineral potential is estimated at between 0.1 and 0.2 million tonnes grading 

between 144 and 216 g/t silver or between 0.3 and 1.5 million potential ounces of silver below 150 metres to a 

depth of 250 metres. The underground mineral potential below the 250-metre depth has not been evaluated.

2 Introduction and Terms of Reference 
 

On June 25, 2018, Aftermath Silver Ltd. (Aftermath) announced that it entered into a definitive 

agreement with Apogee Opportunities Inc. (Apogee Opportunities) to purchase their holding in the 

Cachinal De La Sierra Silver-Gold Project (Cachinal Project) through the of purchase of Apogee 

Opportunities' shares in the Chilean holding company Minera Cachinal S.A., representing 80 percent 

ownership. 

 

This technical report was originally prepared for Valencia Ventures Inc. (Valencia), which was 

subsequently re-addressed to Apogee Minerals Ltd (Apogee) on February 9, 2010 and amended on 

July 8, 2010. It is now being readdressed to Aftermath on August 7, 2018 to support a financial 

transaction and to support the original disclosure of a Mineral Resources Statement prepared by SRK 

Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") on April 30, 2008. 

 

The Cachinal project is a resource delineation stage silver-zinc-gold exploration project located in 

the Cachinal de la Sierra area in the Region II of Chile. It is located approximately 175 kilometres 

southeast of Antofagasta, Chile. The project encloses several silver occurrences including the 

Cachinal silver-gold deposit that is an exploration focus of Aftermath.  

 

During the third quarter of 2007, Valencia commissioned SRK to review and audit the exploration 

work undertaken by Valencia, and to prepare a revised mineral resource estimate for the Cachinal 

silver-gold deposit. This technical report documents the resource model constructed by SRK. It was 

prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-

101 and Form 43-101F1, and in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines."  SRK visited the Cachinal project on 

October 10, 2007. 

 

2.1 Scope of Work 
 

The original scope of work, as defined in the letter of engagement presented to Valencia in 

September 2007, comprised of an audit of the exploration work undertaken by Valencia and the 

preparation of a mineral resource estimate for the silver, gold and zinc vein mineralization delineated 

by Valencia during 2007. It also included a compilation of an independent technical report in 

compliance with National Instrument 43-101 Form 43-101F1 guidelines. This typically requires an 

assessment of the following aspects of the project: 

 

• Topography, landscape, access 

• Regional and local geology 

• Exploration history 

• Audit of exploration work carried out on the project 

• Geological modelling 

• Mineral resource estimation and validation 

• Preparation of a Mineral Resource Statement 

• Recommendations for additional work

2.2 Work Program 
 

The mineral resource estimate for the Cachinal silver-gold-zinc deposit was a collaborative effort 

between Valencia and SRK personnel. The geological model and outlines for the silver-bearing vein 

mineralization were constructed by SRK using geological interpretations provided by Valencia in 

September 2007 and early February 2008. The geostatistical analysis, variography and grade models 

were completed by SRK during the month of March 2008. The mineral resource statement was 

presented to Valencia in mid March 2008 and disclosed publicly in a news release dated March 27, 

2008. 

 

The original technical report was assembled in Toronto, Canada during the month of April 2008, 

whereas this revision was undertaken during 2019. 

 

The Mineral Resource Statement reported herein was prepared in conformity with the generally 

accepted CIM Exploration Best Practices Guidelines and CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and 

Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines. This technical report was prepared following the 

guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-

101F1.  

 

2.3 Basis of Technical Report 
 

This report is based on information collected by SRK during a site visit performed in October 2007 

while active drilling was ongoing, on additional information provided by Valencia and its 

consultants, and other information obtained from the public domain. SRK has no reason to doubt the 

reliability of the information provided by Valencia. 

 

This technical report is based on the following sources of information: 

 

• Discussion with Valencia personnel. 

• Discussions and exchange of information with SBX Consultores Ltda. an independent 

consultant supervising exploration work on the Cachinal project. 

• Exchange of information with Maxwell GeoServices of Australia who has compiled and 

verified the Cachinal project exploration database. 

• Inspection of the Cachinal project area, including drill core from the Cachinal deposit. 

• Review of the exploration data collected by Valencia. 

• Additional information from public domain sources.

experience in most aspects of applied economic geology in a host of geological settings and 

commodities. These applications include: scientific research, target generation, technical exploration, 

database management, geological modelling, resource estimation, mineral mine economics and mine 

production. Mr. Cole has not visited the property. 

 

Dr. Couture is a Principal Geologist with SRK and has been employed by SRK since 2001. He has 

been engaged in mineral exploration and mineral deposit studies since 1982. Since joining SRK, Dr. 

Couture has authored and co-authored independent technical reports on several exploration and 

mining projects in Canada, United States, China, Kazakhstan, Northern Europe, South America, 

West Africa and South Africa.  Dr. Couture visited the Cachinal Project on October 10, 2007. 

 

2.5 Site Visit 
 

In accordance with the NI 43-101 guidelines, Dr. Couture visited the Cachinal project on October 10, 

2007. Dr. Couture was accompanied by Mr. Brian Connolly, PEng and Mr. Tom Rannelli, PEng also 

of SRK and by Mr. Doug Currie of Valencia and Mr. Sergio Diaz of SBX Consultores Ltda. Mr. 

Diaz was supervising the drilling program on the Cachinal project. 

 

The purpose of the visit to was to ascertain the geology of the project area, with a specific emphasis 

on the Cachinal silver deposit. SRK examined drill core and visited outcrop exposures in different 

portions of the property. SRK was able to witness an active drilling site (Borehole CLRC-113) as 

well as recent drilling sites used by Valencia. SRK also examined several trenches. 

 

At the time of the site visit a surveying contractor, Comprobe, was conducting downhole surveys in 

recently drilled boreholes. Drill data generated subsequent to the filing of the April 30, 2008 

technical report was reviewed by the QPs, who consider that this would not materially impact the 

mineral resource evaluation documented in that technical report. No other additional scientific or 

technical information has been generated on the property since that time. The QP reviewed the 

public disclosure for all three companies (news releases, financial statements etc.) to confirm that 

such disclosure did not indicate any material work on the property in the intervening years. This  

confirmed that no material change has occurred on the property since the subsequent drilling defined 

in this report. 

 

SRK was given full access to relevant data and conducted interviews of Valencia personnel to obtain 

information on the past exploration work, understand field procedures used to collect, record, store 

and analyse exploration data.

4 Property Description and Location 
 

4.1 Introduction 
 

The Cachinal project is located in the Cachinal de la Sierra area of Region II of Chile, in the 

Community of Taltal. It lies approximately 175 kilometres southeast of Antofagasta, the largest port 

city and main supply centre for the region, and 105 kilometres northeast of the village of Taltal 

(Figure 1). The property is situated approximately thirty kilometres east of the Pan American 

Highway and is centred on UTM coordinates (datum: PSAD-56, Zone 19S) 7,238,200 North and 

446,300 East (69 degrees 32 minutes longitude west and 24 degrees 58.3 minutes latitude south). 

 

4.2 Mineral Rights in Chile 
 

There are two types of mining concessions in Chile: exploration mining concessions and exploitation 

mining concessions.  

 

In accordance with the Chilean Mining Code, the owner of a mining concession can explore, exploit 

and benefit from all minerals within the boundaries of the relevant concessions, except for 

hydrocarbon and lithium, without additional administrative concessions or operation agreements. 

 

Every titleholder of a mining concession, whether exploitation or exploration, has the right to 

establish an occupation easement over the surface properties required for the comfortable exploration 

or exploitation of its concession. In the event that the surface property owner does not voluntarily 

agree to the granting of the easement, the titleholder of the mining concession may request such 

easement before the Courts of Justice, which shall grant the same upon determination of due 

compensation for losses. 

 

All mining exploration and exploitation concession applications are submitted to the Chilean court 

and granted through a court procedure. Once the court procedure is completed, the court issues a 

final ruling decision. If the decision is supportive of the application, the ruling decision acts as the 

legal title of the concession, which is then registered in the national mining registrar. The application 

to court decision process typically takes 6 to 8 months for an exploration concession and 12 to 

15 months for an exploitation concession. 

 

The main characteristics of exploration and exploitation concessions are described in the following 

subsections.

4.2.1 Exploration Mining Concessions 
 

The titleholder of an exploration concession has the right to carry out all types of mining exploration 

activities within the area of the concession. Exploration concessions can overlap or be granted over 

the same area of land, however, the rights granted by an exploration concession can only be 

exercised by the titleholder with the earliest dated exploration concession over a particular area.  

 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 8 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

For each exploration concession, the titleholder must pay an annual fee of approximately US$1.60 

per hectare to the Chilean Treasury. Exploration concessions have a duration of two years. At the 

end of this period, they may: (i) be renewed as an exploration concession for two additional years in 

which case at least 50 percent of the surface area must be renounced, or (ii) be converted, totally or 

partially, into exploitation concessions.  

 

A titleholder with the earliest dated exploration concession has a preferential right to an exploitation 

concession in the area covered by the exploration concession, over any third parties with a later 

dated exploration concession for that area or without an exploration concession at all and must 

oppose any applications made by third parties for exploitation concessions within the area for the 

exploration concession to remain valid.  

 

4.2.2 Exploitation Mining Concessions 
 

The titleholder of an exploitation (or mining) concession is granted the right to explore and exploit 

the minerals located within the area of the concession and to take ownership of the minerals that are 

extracted. Exploitation concessions can overlap or be granted over the same area of land, however, 

the rights granted by an exploitation concession can only be exercised by the titleholder with the 

earliest dated exploitation concession over a particular area. 

 

Exploitation concessions are of indefinite duration and an annual fee is payable to the Chilean 

Treasury of approximately US$8 per hectare. Where a titleholder of an exploration concession has 

applied to convert the exploration concession into an exploitation concession, the application for the 

exploitation concession and the exploitation concession itself are back-dated to the date of the 

exploration concession.  

 

A titleholder to an exploitation concession must apply to annul or cancel any exploitation 

concessions that overlap with the area covered by its exploitation concession within a certain time 

period in order for the exploitation concession to remain valid. 

 

4.3 Mineral Tenure 
 

On June 25, 2018, Aftermath announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with Apogee 

Opportunities to purchase their holding in the Cachinal De La Sierra Silver-Gold Project (Cachinal 

Project) through the of purchase of Apogee Opportunities' shares in the Chilean holding company 

Minera Cachinal S.A. (Minera Cachinal), representing 80 percent ownership. 

 

By agreement dated as of June 22, 2018, as amended by agreements dated June 24, 2019 and July 

24, 2019 (collectively the "Purchase Agreement"), Aftermath agreed to purchase from Apogee 80% 

of the issued shares of Minera Cachinal S.A., which owns a 100% interest in the Cachinal Property 

in consideration of the sum of $1,575,000. The vendor has the right to receive all or part of the 

purchase price in the form of common shares of Aftermath at a deemed price of $0.20 per common 

share. The purchase is to be closed five business days following the acceptance of the Purchase 

Agreement by the TSX Venture Exchange, and the initial payment of $250,000 is to be paid on 

closing. Additional payments of $250,000, $525,000 and $550,000 are due six, 12 and 18 months 

following the closing, respectively 

 

Minera Cachinal S.A. was formed on December 9, 2013 from the division of the assets owned by 

Minera Silver Standard Chile S.A (Minera Silver). Minera Silver had two controlling partners:  

(i) Silver Standard Resources, Inc. (SSR) and (ii) Silver Standard Ventures, Inc. (SSV). 

 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 9 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

Minera Silver was divided into three companies: (i) Minera Silver Standard Chile S.A (Minera 

Silver), (ii) Minera Cachinal S.A (Minera Cachinal), and (iii) Minera Juncal y La Flora S.A (Minera 

Juncal). The assets were divided among the resulting companies: 96 mining concessions and also 

some water rights for Minera Silver, 11 mining concessions for Minera Cachinal and 11 mining 

concessions for Minera Juncal. 

 

The current ownership of Minera Cachinal is approximately as follows: 

 

• SSR  19.99% 

• SSV  0.01% 

• Apogee  80% 

 

The Cachinal Project is comprised of sixteen Chile mining concessions (Table 1) covering an 

aggregate area of approximately 4,867 hectares, comprising of the 11 mining concessions gained 

from Minera Silver (3,387 hectares) in 2014 and an additional 5 mining concessions (the Cachinal 

claim group) purchased from Compañia Minera Valencia Ventures Chile Limitada in 2016. The 

property boundaries have not been legally surveyed, with the approximate location of the claim pillar 

posts shown in Figure 3. A listing of the concessions is presented in Table 1. 

 

The mineral resources reported herein are located within the Silvania 2, 3 and 8 mining concessions 

(Figure 2 and  Figure 3) registered in the name Minera Cachinal S.A. 

 

The mining concessions are two groups of contiguous mining concessions, for a total property area 

of 4,867 hectares. Please note that the surface of the mining concessions "Silvana 3, 1 al 59" and 

"Silvana 4, 1 al 30" were reduced during their measurement operation to respect the surface area of 

three older mining concessions with preferential rights, named "Carmela", "Pastora", and "Victoria". 

The impact of these surface area modifications is highlighted in Figure 2 and  Figure 3.

4.4 Environmental Considerations 
 

The Cachinal project is an undeveloped exploration project in an historical mining area with 

substantial historical surface disturbance (i.e. shafts, pits, trenches, abandoned plant foundations, 

etc.). Recent surface disturbances resulting from exploration work completed by Valencia, which has 

included some trenching, partially rehabilitated, reverse circulation and diamond drilling and other 

non-disturbing geological activities, is considered minimal. 

 

There are no known aboriginal or surface rights issues relating to the project area. There are no other 

significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the 

property. 

 

Valencia undertook baseline archaeological, anthropological and environmental studies, which, 

although incomplete, are not known to have identified any substantial concerns which might limit or 

preclude future development of the Cachinal deposit. There are no known environmental issues 

related to this property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure, and Physiography 
 

5.1 Accessibility 
 

The Cachinal project is located in the Cachinal de la Sierra area of Chile, in the Community of 

Taltal. It lies approximately 175 kilometres southeast of Antofagasta. Access to the project area from 

the Pan American Highway is along a sand and gravel road which also connects the Guanaco mine 

to the Highway (Figure 1). Apart from the access road to the property, there are a number of 

secondary tracks to the property such that access to every corner is available by motorized 

transportation.  

 

The closest community to the Cachinal project is the township of Taltal, with a population of about 

11,000, which is approximately 170 kilometres from the project. Taltal is located 306 kilometres 

south of Antofagasta and 25 kilometres from Route 5, with no local public transportation to 

Antofagasta. Mining is the primary activity for the community of Taltal. 

 

Valencia exploration camp was located approximately fourteen kilometres north of the Guanaco 

mine and the total distance to the camp from the Pan American Highway was approximately fifty-

five kilometres. Access to the project area is available all the year round. 

 

5.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 

The property and the region have no established infrastructure like towns or villages, electricity and 

water other than the roads.  Cellular telephone communication is however available as is the case of 

many isolated areas in Chile. The project is an early stage exploration project which has not yet been 

evaluated for potential mining infrastructure aspects such as the availability and sources of power, 

water, mining personnel, potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, heap leach 

pad areas, and potential processing plant sites. 

 

5.3 Climate 
 

The project is located in the Atacama Desert, which is considered to be the driest desert in Chile 

(Figure 4). The west and south sides of the property are comprised of gentle rolling terrain, with 

rounded hill tops, while the central and eastern parts of the property form slightly inclined to nearly 

flat plain (pampa). Elevation varies from about 2,690 metres above sea level in the valley floors to 

about 3,150 metres in the highest peaks.  

 

A meteorological station has been operated since 2006 at the Guanaco Gold Mine, located 16 km to 

the south of the Cachinal project. The following extract is from a technical report by Roscoe Postle 

Associates (2017). There is no sharp contrast in temperature between seasons. The average 

temperature of the coldest month (July) is 11.8°C and the average temperature for the hottest month 

(January) is 19.2°C. The daily variation is significant, ranging from a maximum of 33.5°C to a 

minimum of 2.3°C. Exploration work can be carried out year-round.

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

5.4 Physiography 
 

The vegetation in the Cachinal region is quite variable. Short-lived flowers emerge immediately after 

minor rainfall in the early part of the year. Sparse vegetation still exists in topographic lows and 

sheltered areas. The hills and plain (pampa) are generally barren of vegetation.

6 History 
 

There has been a sporadic history of mining in the Cachinal Mining District dating back to the 

middle 1800s. Silver was first discovered at Cachinal de la Sierra in 1881 by prospectors Pedro or 

Jose Peñafiel and Simon Figueroa, who were grubstaked by entrepreneur Berazarte, the owner of the 

Germania and Lagunas saltpeter works, located west of the Cachinal de la Sierra area (Vicuña 

Mackenna, 1882; Bermudez, 1963). The mine was first named "Descubridora", but was 

subsequently named Arturo Prat.  Mining began at the Arturo Prat mine in 1881. 

 

Although different references give conflicting dates of the early history of the area, it appears that 

initial mineral exploitation was mainly for silver, with gold discovered 10 to 20 years later, in the 

Guanaco District, about fifteen kilometres south of Cachinal. 

 

Cachinal de la Sierra became an important mining centre, with a large population, public services, 

and a railway to the coast at Taltal.  Silver production continued uninterrupted from 1881 to 1930. 

During the fifty years the Arturo Prat silver mine operated, mining concentrated on high-grade ore 

because the critical silver mining cut-off grade during the first decades of the 20th Century was 

higher than 700 grams of silver per tonne ("g/t silver") (Kuntz, 1928).  

 

Between 1920 and 1930, the District produced five tonnes of silver bars per month.  The total 

historic production was estimated to be approximately 1,000 tonnes of silver (about thirty-two 

million ounces) for the district (Llaumett, 1992).  Independent miners intermittently mined the area 

when silver prices were relatively high in the early 1980s, from 1985 to 1987 and in the early 1990s. 

Historical records suggest that between 1985 and 1987 a total of 170,639 tonnes were mined at an 

average grade of 280 g/t silver and 0.58 g/t gold. 

 

Historical reports also indicate that from 1882 to 1886 the silver ore was amalgamated at an ore 

treatment plant owned by Sociedad Beneficiadora de Cachinal, established approximately twenty 

kilometres to the south, adjacent to the wetland at Aguada de Cachinal (Vicuña Mackenna, 1882).  

Later, Compañia Arturo Prat itself built a plant in the Port of Taltal, but at the beginning of the 

19th Century, they built a second amalgamation plant at Cachinal de la Sierra (Darapsky, 2003). 

 

In addition to the historic workings developed on the Cachinal Vein System, five kilometres to the 

north, in the El Soldado District, a series of old small-scale workings were excavated (this sector has 

been called "Islote" in some reports).  

 

When mining ceased in 1930, due to the world economic depression, there was an estimated 190,000 

tonnes of tailings left, with a silver content of 178 g/t silver and 180,000 tonnes of waste material 

containing 288 g/t silver (Clunes, 1973). These tonnage and grade estimates are historical and should 

not be relied upon. The qualified persons of this report have not been able to verify these estimates. 

The issuer is also not treating these historical estimate as current "mineral resources or mineral 

reserves' A portion of this material was reworked as a heap leach on the east side of the Cachinal 

property, reportedly during the 1980s. 

 

6.1 Previous Work by Silver Standard and Others 
 

Several exploration and evaluation studies have been conducted in the Cachinal area by other 

companies since the last mining activity in the 1970s - 1980s.  The most comprehensive work was 

conducted by Enami (Llaumet, 1980), which included IP geophysics and topographic surveying of 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 17 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

the veins, and by the Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería ("Sernageomin") and the Japan 

International Cooperation Agency ("Jica") who carried out a comprehensive geological exploration 

program including two phases of angled diamond drilling at Cachinal between 1986 to 1987. 

Sernageomin and Jica drilled thirteen short boreholes 100 to 150 metres in length (1,568.5 metres). 

Their objectives were to test rock chip geochemical anomalies, to evaluate strike extensions of 

known veins, and to locate possible new parallel veins. 

 

Only holes B-1, B-5, B-8 and MJC-11 were collared to intercept the main veins (Carmen and Arturo 

Prat veins). In B-1 the possible north extension of Carmen vein was intercepted from 39.3 to 40.7 

metres (1.4 metres) yielding 140 parts per billion ("ppb") gold, 14.0 g/t silver, 0.21 percent lead and 

925 parts per million ("ppm") zinc, in a silicified breccia zone with quartz-hematite veinlets. The 

best intercept in this hole was 7.0 metres grading 217 ppb gold and 140 g/t silver (between 83.0 and 

90.0 metres). 

 

MJC-11 apparently cut the same Carmen north extension breccia-vein at 500 metres north of B-1, 

and yielded a 6.5-hole length interval (from 69.7 to 76.2 metres) grading less than 20 ppb gold and 

less than 12 g/t silver. The best intercept was a 0.3-metre-wide veinlet grading 300 ppb gold, 115 g/t 

silver, 0.26 percent lead and 0.41 percent zinc. The other drill holes didn't intercept any interesting 

vein or veinlets. 

 

There is insufficient information to determine if the reported core length intervals represent true 

widths. This historical information is unverifiable and therefore should not be relied upon. 

 

As part of a regional evaluation program, Silver Standard investigated the Cachinal area in 2002 

(Smith, 2002a). After some initial reconnaissance mapping and sampling, they completed more 

detailed mapping and sampling of historical workings and mine dumps. In total they took 128 rock 

chip samples and excavated thirty-one trenches (Smith, 2002b). A program of 1,700 metres of 

follow-up reverse circulation drilling was recommended but not completed. 

 

6.2 Previous Work by Work by Valencia 
 

After completing an assessment of several potential acquisition targets in Chile, Valencia 

commenced exploration at Cachinal in 2004. They negotiated farm-in agreements to acquire interests 

in three contiguous concession areas at Cachinal and have subsequently expanded the property by 

acquiring 100 percent interest in additional concessions. 

 

During 2004, Valencia completed geological mapping of the property at 1: 10,000 scale and 

performed an orientation geochemical survey across the historical mining area. This survey was 

expanded to cover a broader area and VLF-EM16 electromagnetic surveying was performed in 2005. 

Trenching and three programs of reverse circulation drilling were also completed in 2005, primarily 

in the main Carmen-Arturo-Prat mining area. 

 

As a result of the exploration program carried out at the Cachinal Project during 2005, an infill 

trenching and reverse circulation drilling campaign was conducted at the Carmen-Arturo Prat area of 

the property from May to October 2006. The program intended to evaluate the size and continuity of 

the mineralized area and to determine the potential to delineate an open pit mineral resource. The 

results of the 2006 drill programs allowed Valencia to complete a mineral resource estimation for the 

Cachinal Project early in 2007. 

 

During 2007, exploration activities were focussed on expanding the resource. Three phases of 

drilling were completed in 2007. Encouraged by the results of the first two phases of drilling,

Valencia appointed SRK to assist with preparation of an updated mineral resource estimate (the 

subject of this report) and to commence preliminary engineering studies. 

 

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 

The Cachinal project area is located within the Paleocene-Eocene Gold Belt of northern Chile, which 

hosts several significant gold and silver deposits (Figure 5). The known Cachinal veins are all 

located within and near the western margin of a volcanic caldera (Cachinal caldera), which is 

approximately 30 kilometres in diameter (Puig et al. 1988). The west rim of the caldera is outlined 

by distinct rounded hills forming a gentle arc on the west side of the property. The caldera is 

developed in Paleocene-Eocene volcanic rocks assigned to the Chile-Alemania Formation which is a 

bimodal rhyolite-andesite sequence distributed widely throughout the Antofagasta region. Another 

younger and smaller caldera, El Soldado, protrudes through the Cachinal caldera on its northern end. 

It is associated with polymetallic, gold-rich veins in the El Soldado Mining District  

 

The western margin of the caldera is characterised by a chain of dacite flow domes and their related 

dacite to andesite lava.  The southern end of the dome chain appears to be related to the high 

sulphidation epithermal El Guanaco gold district.  

 

The center of the district is underlain by a propylitic-altered diorite stock and related andesite lava, 

covered by rhyodacite, ash-flow tuffs with co-genetic porphyry facies. The rhyodacite and ash-flow 

tuff are overlain by and interbedded with reddish volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and dacite to 

andesite lava.  

 

The age of the diorite stock ranges from 62 to 60 Million years ("Ma"). A flat relief plain (pampa) 

composed of colluvial and alluvial loose sediments covers a buried sequence of green coloured 

conglomerate and sandstone sedimentary rocks to the east of Cachinal. 

 

7.2 Property Geology 
 

7.2.1 Lithology 
 

In the vicinity of the Cachinal deposit there are six main lithological types. 

 

Cachinal Diorite and Pyroxene Andesite: In the center of the district and principally to the west of 

the Cachinal veins a diorite-microdiorite stock (62-60 Ma.) crops out (Figure 6). It is spatially and 

genetically related to pyroxene andesitic lava (circa. 60 Ma.). These rocks form a gentle to flat relief 

characterized by greenish coloration due to the weak generalized propylitic alteration (chlorite-

epidote-calcite). The diorite textures vary from medium to fine porphyritic to equigranular. The 

andesite textures vary from aphanitic to finely porphyritic, with plagioclase and pyroxene 

phenocrysts.

Dacitic-rhyolitic ash flow tuffs and QFP: A dacitic to rhyolitic ash-flow tuff sequence (circa. 60 

Ma.) covers the Cachinal Diorite (Figure 6). It is characterized by abundant quartz eyes crystals and 

fragments, feldspar and scarce oxidized biotite and amphibole in a vitreous fluidal matrix. The tuff 

grade locally to lapilli and/or pumice welded tuff and passes also gradually to rhyolitic-dacitic 

quartz-feldspar porphyry("QFP") dikes, probably feeders of the tuff flow. The QFP dikes have a 

silicified aphanitic groundmass with corroded quartz eyes and feldspars fragments; usually they 

display reddish to yellowish colors due to supergene oxidation of mafic minerals; most of its 

outcrops are not distinguishable from the dacitic crystal tuff, but in the contact between both types of 

rocks a crystalline - single phase - quartz stockwork and/or brecciation is developed. 

 

To the east of Cachinal, a flat topography descending to northeast paved by alluvial to colluvial 

loose sediments partially cover a poorly documented tightly folded sequence of porphyritic andesite, 

crystal dacitic tuff and scarce diorite (Figure 6). These rocks are assigned to the same Paleocene-

Eocene sequence of Cachinal (Chile- Alemania Formation), but at Cerro Islote Range a faulted 

contact with Jurassic calcareous formation (El Profeta Formation) and Cretaceous clastic 

sedimentary rocks (Santa Ana Formation) are recognized (Figure 7).  

 

Reddish volcaniclastic sediments: A reddish volcaniclastic sediment of dacitic composition 

overlies and is interbedded with the dacitic-rhyolitic tuff. This rock unit exhibits graded bedding, and 

is distributed all over the property, but is more prominent in the southern part surrounding Sierra del 

Relincho Range. This unit includes fine to coarse grained sandstone, volcanic lithic breccia and also 

lapilli tuff, mainly at Cerro Limbo area. 

 

 
Figure 7: Schematic Section through the Cachinal District 

 

Green conglomerate and sandstone: In the waste dumps of the exploration pits excavated from the 

Cachinal cemetery to the southeast green conglomerate and volcaniclastic sandstone are recognized.

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

The conglomerate contains sub-rounded andesitic, dacitic and tuffaceous clasts up to twenty-five 

centimetres in diameter in a volcaniclastic sandstone matrix. The sandstone is arkosic containing 

quartz, feldspar and lithic fragments in an argillaceous matrix. In the pits, the conglomerate overlies 

andesite lava and dacitic crystal tuff, and is covered by up to thirty metres of consolidated gravels. 

 

Dacitic-Andesitic Plateau Lava: The western parts of the district are underlain by a thick sequence 

of fine grained dacite and subordinate andesite, (58-53 Ma.) with weakly porphyritic to mottled fine 

textures, covering stratified lapilli tuff and reddish volcaniclastic sediments at Cerro Limbo 

(Figure 7). Along Sierra Peñafiel Range these lavas are intruded by the dacitic domes, and to the 

west of the Sierra the dacite and andesite were erupted as horizontal lava plateau. At Cerro Relincho 

massif and surrounding hills the dacite is a monomictic breccias with argillized feldspars in a matrix 

of crystalline silica, possibly of hydrothermal origin. Nevertheless, the breccia has the same texture 

and appearance as the small brecciated portions topping the dacitic domes at Cerro Peñafiel, Cerro 

2953 and others. 

 

Dacitic Domes: Along the western margin of the inferred Cachinal Caldera a set of isolated flow 

banded dacitic domes were emplaced from Cerro la Isla to Cerro Campana, also including the 

eastern slope of Cerro Limbo. The domes have a fluidal fine to coarse porphyritic texture, with 

plagioclase, biotite and hornblende phenocrysts in an aphanitic groundmass. Most of the domes 

exhibit green perlitic glass margins indicative of fast cooling and suggesting sub-aerial emplacement. 

Radiometric dating suggests the domes vary in age from 59 Ma. at Cerro La Isla to 55 Ma. at Cerro 

Campana. 

 

7.2.2 Structural Geology 
 

The most significant structural feature of the district is the preserved western half portion of the 

Cachinal Caldera hosting the diorite, pyroclastic flows, lava and the stacked epithermal veins. The 

Caldera is bordered to the west and south by the dacitic dome chain. 

 

In the vicinity of the Cachinal epithermal veins, the stratigraphy is flat to gently east dipping. East of 

the vein system, up to the Cerro Islote Range, the volcano-sedimentary sequence is more strongly 

folded but this area is covered by extensive alluvial and colluvial cover (Figure 7). 

 

7.3 Mineralization 
 

At Cachinal, the silver-gold-zinc mineralization occurs in a cluster of interconnected sub-parallel, 

low-sulphidation epithermal quartz veins, and vein breccias located in the centre portion of the claim 

group, approximately four kilometres east of dacite domes (Figure 7). Generally, the vein structures 

are sub-parallel to the caldera rim and occur along a chain of dacitic domes.  

 

According to scarce historical records, more than twenty individual vein structures have been mined 

at Cachinal. The veins are characterized by crustiform crystalline to amethyst quartz filling open 

space fractures or forming breccia bodies. 

 

The veins have been recognized by trenching and drilling over a strike length of at least two 

kilometres and are known to have been mined to a depth of at least 300 metres. They range in 

thickness from a few centimetres to two metres, reaching up to twenty metres locally at the 

intersection of two structures. The main veins trend north-northwest and north-west with a secondary 

set trending east-northeast to east-west, best developed at the southern end of the deposit.

Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 23 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

In the Cachinal area, the oxidation profile is extensive reaching between 120 and 150 metres below 

the surface. The depth of the hypogene mineralization is unknown, the deepest known workings 

reach 320 metres at the intersection of Carmen and Arturo Prat veins. 

 

The veins formed as open space fracture and fault fillings. Silica is the dominant proximal 

hydrothermal alteration. In the wallrock, feldspar is typically replaced by propylithic to advanced 

argillic alteration (sericite-pyrophyllite) assemblages and adularia-fluorite intergrowths occur in wall 

rock in proximity to the quartz stockwork. There are three different styles of low-sulphidation 

epithermal vein mineralization (Figure 8):  

 

• Massive crystalline quartz, locally amethyst, accompanied with minor silver, iron, lead, zinc 

and copper sulphide and oxides. 

• Hydrothermal vein breccias composed of silica, argillic and mica altered fragments 

cemented by crustiform and banded quartz (minor amethyst), locally intergrowth with 

adularia, fluorite and silver, iron, lead, zinc and copper sulphides and oxides. 

• Fractures filled or stained by iron oxides and silver oxides. 

 

The Cachinal epithermal veins occupy open space fractures and faults sub-parallel to the caldera rim, 

approximately four kilometres east of the dacitic domes (Figure 7). The silver-bearing epithermal 

veins trend north-northwest to northwest with subordinate sets trending more north-easterly to east. 

The veins have been segmented by late east-trending faults. 

 

Mineralogical studies have reported the presence of the following mineral species: freibergite, native 

silver, stromeyerite, chlorargirite, bromargite, miargirite and pearceite-polybasite, as silver minerals, 

accompanied by galena, sphalerite, specularite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, magnetite, chalcocite, 

covellite, cynabar and native gold. Anglesite and chalcocite were found in the upper, oxidized 

portion of the veins.  

 

The low sulphidation veins are surrounded by a thin halo of pervasive silica-argillic alteration and 

crystalline quartz stockwork. The latter is best developed in the QFP host rock where hydrothermal 

quartz overgrows the pre-existent quartz eyes. Feldspar is replaced by sericite and lesser 

pyrophyllite. The stockwork consists on thin (one to two millimetres) wide crustiform quartz-

adularia-sericite-fluorite veins. Sericite in the walls of Flor de Chile vein was dated as 59.2 Ma, 

while that from the Gemela Vein (Virginia 23 Shaft) carry an age of 59.3 Ma. 

 

A series of small old workings have been excavated five kilometres north of the Cachinal.  In this 

area, referred to as "Islote" in previous reports, a set of predominantly northeast trending thin veins 

and breccia veins cut through andesite lava and breccia-tuff, green conglomerate and few diorite. 

None of these workings reach the intensity of development as in Cachinal, possibly due to thin vein 

widths (0.2 to 2.5 metres) and lower silver content. 

 

The dacitic domes are mostly barren, except for small gold showings reported at Cerro Campana 

(outside the Cachinal property). 

 

On the eastern side of the property, the Jurassic sedimentary rocks contain minor iron-rich calcite 

veins (Figure 7).  

 

In the southern part of the property, minor quartz veining occurs in an alteration zone possibly 

related to the high-sulphidation of El Guanaco district occurring south of the Cachinal property.

8 Deposit Types 
 

The Cachinal project is located within the Paleocene-Eocene Gold Belt in the northern Chile  

(Figure 5) known for its significant low and high sulphidation epithermal silver-gold deposit. 

 

The Cachinal project was assembled by Valencia for its potential to host low and high sulphidation 

epithermal silver and gold deposits. Epithermal deposits comprise a wide clan of hydrothermal 

deposits associated with volcanic and magmatic edifices and formed by the circulation of 

hydrothermal fluids into fractured rocks. Exploration work in this area has uncovered several 

precious metals (silver, gold-silver and silver-gold associated with base metals) deposits and 

occurrences exhibiting characteristics indicative of epithermal hydrothermal systems. 

 

The Cachinal silver-gold deposit is the most important exploration target on the Cachinal project. 

This deposit was mined from underground workings during the twentieth century and drilling by 

Valencia since 2004 has delineated a near surface silver, gold and zinc resource associated with a 

network of steeply dipping north to northwest trending low-sulphide quartz veins. The character of 

the silver-bearing vein mineralization is described in Section 7.3.

9 Exploration 
 

9.1 Historical Exploration Work 
 

Historical exploration activities on the property, prior to Valencia involvement, are documented in 

Section 6.1 of this technical report.  

 

 

9.2 Exploration Work Undertaken by Valencia 
 

Initial field programs deployed by Valencia following the acquisition of the property included 

topographic surveying, geological mapping, soil sampling and ground electromagnetic surveys 

(VLF-EM). All exploration work completed by Valencia at Cachinal since 2004 has been conducted 

by SBX Consultores Ltda. (SBX), an independent consultant. 

 

Between February and June 2005, more soil sampling and ground geophysics was followed by 

trenching (seventeen trenches; 640 metres) and an initial reverse circulation drilling program 

comprising sixteen boreholes (2,294 metres). 

 

In the second half of 2006 Valencia excavated twenty-six trenches (1,436 metres) and drilled thirty-

four reverse circulation boreholes (4,804 metres). All trenching and drilling work was tied to the 

ground geochemistry and geophysics grid data. Old workings were also surveyed. Towards the end 

of the program, five core boreholes (552 metres) were drilled to twin reverse circulation drilling 

data. One core hole was lost. The result from that exploration work was used by Valencia to prepare 

an initial mineral resource estimate for the Cachinal silver-gold deposit. In February 2007, the 

mineral resources were estimated by Ralf Gonzales, an independent consultant (Gonzales and Diaz, 

2007). 

 

Between February 2007 and February 2008, Valencia drilled 131 reverse circulation boreholes 

(20,000 metres) with the objective of expanding the resources of the project and infilling the 

delineation of the silver-bearing mineralization to fifty metre sections. Nine core boreholes (3,241 

metres) were drilled to test the depth extensions of the Cachinal silver-bearing veins at depth. During 

the same program, ten reverse circulation boreholes (1,370 metres) and one core home (266 metres) 

were also drilled to test three other vein targets (Vino-9, Vino Central and Sector Islote). In 

summary, since 2004, Valencia has completed (Figure 11): 

 

• 197 inclined reverse circulation boreholes (over 28,000 metres). 

• 22 core boreholes (4,951 metres, 892 metes for geotechnical reasons).  

• 43 trenches (2,076 metres). 

• 129 line-kilometres of ground electromagnetic surveying (VLF-EM). 

• 955 line-kilometres of ground magnetic surveying. 

• 1,109 soil geochemical samples (200-400 metre lines and 50-100 metre stations). 

 

The result of the exploration program was the definition of an extensive vein hosted system of silver 

mineralization as defined in Figure 11.

9.2.1 Exploration Sampling  
 

Soil Sampling 

 

Soil samples were collected along east-west surveyed lines separated by 200 to 400 metres with 

sampling stations spaced at 50 to 100 metres. Since no true soil profile is developed in the Atacama 

Desert, small pits (0.4 to 0.6 metre) were hand dug and a single sample collected at the bottom of 

each pit.  Samples were collected using a plastic shovel and sieved on site, to minus 80 Tyler-mesh 

to obtain a sample of approximately 0.8 kilogram. At each tenth sample site, a duplicate sample was 

collected and inserted in sequential order (the rate was reduced to one in twenty samples later in the 

program).   

 

Trench Sampling 

 

Surface trenches were excavated using an excavator. Each trench was positioned as to cut the vein 

structures perpendicular to its strike. Trench rock samples were collected over continuous two-metre 

intervals by cutting a channel with a rock hammer and a chisel. A duplicate sample was collected at 

a rate of one in ten samples (later at a rate of one in twenty) by chiselling a second sample over the 

same interval. 

 

Core Drilling Sampling 

 

Core boreholes were drilled for three purposes:  

 

1. To duplicate reverse circulation drilling results. 
2. For geotechnical purposes.  
3. To test the depth extensions of the silver-bearing veins at approximately 200 metres below 

the surface.  

 

In all cases inclined boreholes were drilled towards the west as to interest the projected silver-

bearing structure as close as possible to a right angle. 

 

Core assay samples were collected using two different procedures. 

 

Initially, core recovered for drilling was logged and marked for sampling on the field. Core boxes 

where then sent to the SBX sample preparation and storage facility in Copiapo, Chile. Assay samples 

were collected over regular 1 metre intervals from half core sawed lengthwise with a diamond saw. 

The remaining half sample was replaced in the core box and archived. 

 

In 2007, Valencia and SBX installed a core saw directly at the Cachinal camp to facilitate sample 

logistics. Core holes drilled in 2007 were sampled at regular one metre intervals from half core 

sawed lengthwise with a diamond saw. Prior to sampling all core was logged for geological, 

structural and geotechnical features. 

 

Reverse Circulation Drilling Sampling 

 

Reverse circulation boreholes were used to sample the silver-bearing veins on sections (50 to 100 

metres spacing) perpendicular to the strike of the projected structures. Fences of inclined reverse 

circulation boreholes were drilled towards the west as to intersect the targeted vein structures as 

close as possible to a right angle.

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

 

Reverse circulation samples were collected on regular one metre drill advance. The material exiting 

the drill rig cyclone was collected in a clear plastic bag, weighted and riffle-split twice to yield assay 

sample approximately eight kilograms in weight. Representative chips were collected and described 

by a geologist. 

 

In the past, samples were collected in 20-litre plastic pails and split twice through a mechanical riffle 

splitter to obtain approximately eight kilograms of material for assaying. The first split was stored in 

clear plastic bags in a selected area immediately adjacent to Valencia's field camp. SRK noticed that 

the plastic bags have deteriorated, and the older samples are useless.

10 Drilling 
 

10.1 Historical Drilling 
 

There are few records for historical drilling performed by Sernageomin and Jica on the Cachinal 

project. Thirteen short core boreholes (1,568.5 metres) were drilled at Cachinal in 1986-87 to test 

rock geochemical targets and evaluate the strike extension of the known silver-bearing veins. Four 

holes investigated the Carmen and Arturo Prat veins (see Section 6.2 above). 

 

Jica brought its own drill rigs and personnel directly from Japan. Detailed core logging and some of 

the assays are reported in the Sernageomin-Jica 1988 report. The entire half-core pieces were finally 

sent to the Universidad del Norte in Antofagasta, but they are not available for review. 

 

Silver Standard investigated the Cachinal area in 2002 but did not drill any boreholes. 

 

10.2 Drilling by Valencia (to January 2008) 
 

Terra Service S.A. was contracted for the initial phases of reverse circulation drilling (2006 and early 

2007) that targeted primarily the Carmen-Arturo Prat veins (southern portion of the Cachinal 

deposit) at vertical depths of 40 to 80 metres on sections spaced by 50 metres. 

 

The latter phase of drilling (February 2007 to August 2008) was conducted by Perfo Chile Ltda and 

Boart Longyear. The objective of the program was to expand the delineation of the Cachinal deposit 

towards the north while infilling to 50 metre sections the southern portions of the deposit, where 

appropriate. Drilling undertaken after January 25, 2008 (cut-off date for resource evaluation) tested 

the depth extent of the deposit below the mineral resources areas, infill to 50 metres spacing the 

Cachinal deposit in the north and also tested other exploration targets on the property, outside the 

resource area. Figure 12 shows the drill collar locations of the various phases of drilling on the 

Cachinal property. 

 

All borehole collars were surveyed using a theodolite (Total Station) and reported in UTM 

coordinates (Datum PSAD 56). 

 

The drilling completed by Valencia aimed at intersecting the targeted vein structures as close as 

possible to a right angle so that the samples recovered from drilling approximately represent the true 

thickness of the intersected structures. Additional information about sampling length and true 

thickness of the vein structures is provided in Section 11 and Section 16.

10.2.1 Reverse Circulation Drilling 
 

Two hundred and nineteen (219) reverse circulation boreholes (31,306 metres) have been drilled by 

Terra Service S.A and Perfo Chile Ltda in the Cachinal main resource area and adjacent targets areas 

(Gemelas, North Anomaly). Sixteen holes (1,980 metres) have been drilled in three regional 

exploration targets (East of Cachinal Veins, Vino-9 and Vino Central). 

 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 34 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

One-hundred and seventy-six (176) reverse circulation boreholes (25,199 metres) were considered 

for resource evaluation. All reverse circulation boreholes are 5.25 inches in diameter (13.3 

centimetres). Terra Service used a Drilltech S40 KX and a Schramm drill rigs. Perfo Chile used an 

Atlas Copco RD-10 and an Ingersoll Rand T-4 drill rigs. The position of all borehole collars was 

surveyed with a differential GPS for the first two campaigns and a theodolite (Total Station) for the 

last ones. 

 

Downhole deviation was monitored in fifty-six reverse circulation boreholes by Comprobe, a local 

contractor, using a digital gyroscope. The contractor was on site when SRK visited the property in 

October 2007. The remaining reverse circulation boreholes were not surveyed because they had 

collapsed. 

 

10.2.2 Core Drilling 
 

Twenty-seven (27) core boreholes (6,241 metres) were drilled on the main Cachinal resource area 

and surrounding exploration targets. 

 

The initial five core holes (714 metres) were drilled in 2006 by Geotec S. A. contractor from 

Santiago, using a Drilltech S-40KX drill rig mounted on a truck. Drilling diameter was HQ 

(6.4-centimetre diameter) except for core hole CLDD-05 which was drilled on NQ diameter 

(4.8-centimetre diameter). Data from these initial five core boreholes were the only available for 

resource evaluation. 

 

After January 25, 2008, ten HQ core boreholes (CLDD-06 to CLDD-15) were drilled by Boart 

Longyear using a Longyear LF-90D truck-mounted drill rig. Seven twin core holes (892.2 metres) 

CLDD-12t to CLDD-85t were also drilled in 2008 by Perfo Chile, on HQ diameter, using a 

Longyear 44 drill rig. Finally, five additional geotechnical core boreholes (GEOTECH_1 to 

GEOTECH_5; 1,290 metres) were drilled in 2008 by Boart Longyear. All drill collars were surveyed 

using a theodolite (Total Station). 

 

The initial five core holes (CLDD01-CLDD-05) were not surveyed for downhole deviation. Their 

trace is assumed to be straight. Boreholes CLDD-06 to CLDD-14 were surveyed for downhole 

deviation by the drill contractor (Boart Longyear) using a Maxibore device. Borehole CLDD-15 was 

drilled over four kilometres northeast of the Cachinal deposit and was not surveyed. Three of the 

seven twin holes, CLDD-40t, CLDD-63t and CLDD-85t, were surveyed by Comprobe using a digital 

gyroscope. A review of drill logging indicates that  drill core recoveries were generally good 

(>90%). The five geotechnical core boreholes GEOTECH_1 to GEOTECH_5 were not surveyed for 

downhole deviation. 

 

10.2.3 Drilling After January 2008 
 

 

2008 Exploration Program 

 

The Mineral Resource Statement documented in Section 13 considers drilling and trenching 

information up to January 25, 2008. Drilling on the property was still ongoing at that time, Valencia 

completed an additional seventeen core boreholes, forty-three reverse circulation boreholes and five 

geotechnical core boreholes as discussed in Section 10.2.3. Some of the exploration targets 

investigated by the subsequent drilling were recommended for drilling in the original April 30, 2008 

technical report.

The subsequent drilling includes forty-three reverse circulation boreholes CLRC-177 to CLRC-219, 

seventeen core boreholes CLDD-06 to CLDD-15, twin core holes CLDD-012t to CLDD-085t and 

geotechnical core holes GEOTECH_1 to GEOTECH_5. These boreholes had four objectives: 

 

• Infilling and possibly extending the silver bearing veins in the northern and southern 

portions of the Cachinal deposit. 

• Testing the potential depth extension of the Carmen-Arturo-Prat vein system. 

• Assess the geotechnical properties along potential open pit walls. 

• Testing other exploration targets outside the resource areas. 

 

Significant assay results from the subsequent reverse circulation boreholes are presented in Error! 

Reference source not found.. The most significant results are from boreholes CLRC-181 to CLRC-

187 drilled in the northern portion of the deposit near the Buena Esperanza Pit to infill at 25 metre 

line spacing an area previously tested at 50-metre spacing and demonstrate the geological continuity 

of the silver and gold mineralization. 

 

Nine core boreholes were drilled at intervals varying from approximately 500 metres to 100 metres 

over two kilometres to test the depth extension of the primary Carmen-Arturo-Prat vein system. One 

hole failed to reach its final depth. Subsequent drilling completed by Valencia aimed at intersecting 

the targeted vein structures as close as possible to a right angle so that the samples recovered from 

drilling approximately represent the true thickness of the intersected structures. Significant assay 

results are summarized in Error! Reference source not found.. This table also contains significant 

results from seven twin core boreholes aimed at validating reverse circulation borehole results. A 

review of core drill logging from the subsequent drilling suggests that core recovery was good 

(>90%). 

 

Geotechnical Investigation 

 

In preparation for supporting conceptual design of a mining project at Cachinal, five geotechnical 

core boreholes were drilled to investigate the quality of the rock mass in the vicinity of conceptual 

pit walls. SRK provided personnel to log nine core boreholes (CLDD-06 to CLDD-14) and the five 

geotechnical core boreholes (GEOTECH_1 to GEOTECH_5) to record information about 

geotechnical properties of the rock mass.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 
 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Analyses 
 

All aspects of the sampling, handling and dispatching to the assay laboratory was conducted under 

the supervision of SBX Consultores Ltda., an independent consultant. SRK also has no reason to 

believe that any tampering of data has occurred on this project.  

 

Valencia used only one primary laboratory for preparing and assaying all samples (soil, rock, core 

and reverse circulation drilling) collected on the Cachinal project. All samples submitted for 

assaying were dispatched by SBX personnel to Antofagasta where ALS Chemex operates a sample 

preparation facility. Prepared samples were thereafter transferred by ALS Chemex to its assaying 

facility in La Serena, Chile. 

 

The management system of ALS-Chemex Antofagasta and La Serena Laboratories are accredited 

ISO 9001 by NCS International Pty. The La Serena Laboratory is also accredited under ISO 17025 

(INN LE 246) by the Instituto Nacional de Normalization of Chile for a number of specific test 

procedures. The analytical protocols used by Valencia are not within scope of the accreditation. 

ALS-Chemex laboratories also participate in a number of international proficiency tests, such as 

those managed by CANMET and Geostats. In 2007, Valencia submitted a small shipment of ninety 

samples to SGS Minerals Services laboratory in Santiago, Chile for check assaying. SGS Mineral 

Services are independent of the issuer and which are accredited and certified by several national and 

international entities including ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. 

 

Assay samples were prepared using standard preparation procedures developed by ALS-Chemex. 

Rock chips and core sample are weighted, dried and crushed to 70 percent passing -2.0-millimetre 

sieve and subsequently pulverized to better than 85 percent passing a 75 microns screen. Soil 

samples are weighted, dried and sieved dried to -180 microns screens. 

 

All trench and drilling samples were assayed for gold by fire assay on a fifty grams sub-sample 

(method code Au-AA24) and silver and zinc using multi-acid digestion and atomic absorption 

spectrometry (method code Ag-AA62 and Zn-AA62). Samples with silver grades exceeding 200 g/t 

silver were systematically re-assayed using gravimetric method (method code Ag-GRA21). Sample 

rejects and pulps were archived and remain available for additional resting. 

 

 

11.2 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 
 

Quality control measures are typically set in place to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of 

exploration data. This includes written field procedures and independent verifications of aspects such 

as drilling, surveying, sampling and assaying, data management and database integrity. Appropriate 

documentation of quality control measures and regular analysis of quality control data are important 

as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for the quality assurance program implemented 

during exploration. 

 

Analytical control measures typically involve internal and external laboratory control measures 

implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the sampling, preparation and assaying. They 

are also important to prevent sample mix-up and monitor the voluntary or inadvertent contamination 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 40 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

of samples. Assaying protocols typically involve regular duplicate and replicate assays and insertion 

of quality control samples to monitor the reliability of assaying results throughout the sampling and 

assaying process. Check assaying is typically performed as an additional reliability test of assaying 

results. This typically involves re-assaying a set number of sample rejects and pulps at a secondary 

umpire laboratory. 

 

SRK cannot comment on the quality control measures used by previous project operators. 

 

The exploration work conducted by Valencia was carried out using quality assurance and quality 

control program generally meeting industry best practices.  All aspects of the exploration data 

acquisition and management including mapping, surveying, drilling, sampling, sample security, and 

assaying and database management were conducted under the supervision of appropriately qualified 

geologists. 

 

The analytical quality control data for the Cachinal project include both internal and external quality 

control measures. ALS-Chemex implemented internal laboratory measures consisting of inserting 

quality control samples (blanks and certified reference materials and duplicate pulp) within each 

batch of samples submitted for assaying. The quality control data produced by ALS-Chemex was 

communicated to Valencia with assaying results. 

 

Valencia also implemented external analytical quality control measures that were strengthened 

during 2007. This included inserting quality control samples (blanks, project specific standards and 

certified reference standards) with each batch of trench, reverse circulation and core drilling samples 

at an appropriate frequency. The quality control program developed by Valencia for this project is 

mature and is overseen by appropriately qualified geologists. 

 

In the opinion of SRK, the exploration data from the Cachinal project was acquired by Valencia 

using adequate quality control procedures that generally meet or exceed industry best practices for a 

drilling stage exploration property. 

 

11.3 SRK Comments 
 

In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by 

Valencia were consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate.

12 Data Verification 
 

12.1 Verifications by Valencia 
 

During drilling Valencia implemented routine visual verifications to ensure the collection of reliable 

exploration data. Sample shipments and assay deliveries were routinely monitored as produced by 

the preparation and assaying laboratories. However, much of the quality control analysis was 

completed retrospectively and not as the data was produced. This limited the ability of Valencia to 

promptly identify sample mislabelling and react to abnormal assaying results delivered by the 

assaying laboratory. 

 

During the fourth quarter of 2007, Valencia mandated Maxwell GeoServices ("Maxwell") from 

Australia to review, compile and verify the Cachinal exploration database. Sampling data acquired 

by Valencia were transferred to Maxwell and analysed to create a Data Shed database for the 

Cachinal project. In this process the integrity of the project data was verified by Maxwell.  

 

Maxwell also reviewed the quality control data produced by Valencia and ALS-Chemex on the 

Cachinal project (Maxwell, 2008). Maxwell aggregated all internal and external analytical quality 

control data produced for the Cachinal project and analysed these data using a series of bias and 

precision plots. 

 

In its review Maxwell did not uncover any material issues with the quality of the assaying data for 

the Cachinal project. Laboratory internal quality control data do not highlight assaying issues at the 

laboratory. The performance of the certified commercial standards used by Valencia is also good. 

The Maxwell analysis shows that the performance of the field standards prepared by SBX is 

acceptable, although assay results show more scatter resulting from non- homogeneous samples. 

Maxwell noted few control sample failures.  

 

Maxwell formulated five main recommendations for Valencia to consider in the future: 

 

• Use of commercial standard reference material with set tolerance intervals. 

• Monthly analysis and review of quality control data to identify and investigate any abnormal 

assaying results and take appropriate actions. 

• Development of a quality assurance and quality control policy. 

• Improve sample labelling procedures to reduce frequency of mislabelled samples. 

• Additional check assaying at an umpire laboratory (five percent recommended). 

 

During 2007, Valencia drilled five core boreholes in an attempt to replicate four reverse circulation 

intersections. In 2008, an additional six core holes were drilled to replicate reverse circulation 

boreholes and for geotechnical purposes.  

 

12.2 Verifications by SRK 
 

12.2.1 Site Visit 
 

In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, SRK visited the Cachinal project on 

October 10, 2007 while active drilling was ongoing.  The purpose of the site visit was to inspect the 

property and ascertain the geological setting of the Cachinal deposit, witness the extent of historical 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 42 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

exploration work carried out on the property and assess logistical aspects and other constraints 

relating to conducting exploration work in the area. SRK was given full access to project data. 

 

During the visit, SRK personally inspected an active drilling site, several trenches and recent drilling 

sites, including one of the sites where a reverse circulation borehole was twinned by a core hole. All 

drilling sites remain clearly visible. Sampling lines in trenches were also visible.  

 

During the visit, the surveying contractor Comprobe was conducting downhole surveys in recently 

drilled boreholes. While on site, SRK interviewed project personnel regarding the exploration 

strategy and field procedures used by Valencia. Core from four core holes was examined. 

 

Considering the comprehensive quality control program used by Valencia, SRK did not deem 

necessary to collect independent verification samples.  

 

The site visit undertaken by the QP was undertaken during the subsequent drilling program – 

although the data from this program was not available in time for considering during resource 

estimation, it is not considered necessary to undertake another site visit as no addition exploration 

information was generated after the subsequent drilling. 

 

12.2.2 Verifications of Analytical Quality Control Data 
 

Valencia and Maxwell made available to SRK the Cachinal project data in the form of extracts from 

the DataShed database created and verified by Maxwell. 

 

SRK conducted a series of routine verifications to ensure the reliability of the electronic data 

provided by Valencia and Maxwell. In the opinion of SRK, the electronic data are reliable and 

exhaustive. 

 

Valencia provided to SRK a copy of the Maxwell analytical quality control review report and 

separately, Maxwell provided to SRK an extraction of all analytical quality control data produced for 

the Cachinal project (to the end of January 2008 and for the "subsequent drilling"). 

 

SRK reviewed the report produced by Maxwell and visually examined assay results for the internal 

quality control samples used by the assay laboratory and found no suspicious or anomalous results. 

 

SRK aggregated the assay results for the external quality control samples for further analysis, 

focussing exclusively on assay results for silver, gold and zinc. Sample blanks, field standards and 

certified reference materials data were summarized on time series plot to highlight any potential 

failure. Field duplicate and pulp replicate paired assay data were analysed using bias charts and 

ranked half absolute relative deviation charts.  

 

The analytical quality control data produced by Valencia on the Cachinal project are summarized in 

Table 4. Quality control data are presented in graphical format in Appendix A. 

 

In general, the quality control data examined by SRK suggest that silver, gold and zinc grades can be 

reasonably reproduced suggesting that the assay results reported by the primary assay laboratory are 

generally reliable for the purpose of resource estimation. SRK identified a number of sample 

mislabelling issues, especially mislabelling of control samples. SRK concurs with Maxwell's 

recommendations for improvement in sample labelling procedures. 

 

In the opinion of SRK, the analytical results delivered by ALS-Chemex are sufficiently reliable for 

the purpose of mineral resource estimation.

12.2.3 Comparison of Trench, Core and Reverse Circulation Drilling Data 
 

Assay data for the Cachinal deposit were collected using three different sampling methods. On the 

surface, the silver mineralization was sampled using trenches excavated by excavator. Assay samples 

were collected on regular intervals by chiselling the wall of the trench. 

 

The Cachinal deposit was sampled in the sub-surface using two drilling techniques. The vast 

majority of the sampling was conducted using a reverse circulation drilling technique. The chips 

recovered by the drilling process were sampled at regular one metre of drill advance and 

mechanically split to yield the assay sample. Finally, diamond drilling equipment was used to 

recover core from the Cachinal deposit. The assay samples were collected on half core sawed

lengthwise with a diamond saw. In total, eighty-six percent of the vein samples were collected from 

reverse circulation chips (Table 5). 

 

SRK conducted certain verifications to ensure that the three sample supports yielded geostatistically 

comparable assay results. The analysis focussed on silver assays. Silver assay results intersecting the 

wireframes were extracted for analysis. Q-Q' plots comparing silver assay results on a percentile 

basis for each sample type are presented in Figure 13. 

 

Above about 10 g/t silver, the graphs on Figure 13 show no significant bias between each sample 

support. Above about 250 g/t silver, core and trench sample populations are somewhat different than 

the reverse circulation population. The bias occurs above the 95th and 97th percentile, respectively. 

 

In general, SRK considers that for the main silver grade ranges observed in the Cachinal deposit, 

there is no significant bias between each sample support and that therefore all three sample types can 

be used for resource estimation. 

 

Considering the preponderance of reverse circulation samples (eighty-six percent; Table 5), the 

inclusion of core and trench assay data will introduce an insignificant sample support bias to mineral 

resource estimation.

12.2.4 Review of Twin Drilling Results 
 

In 2007 and 2008, Valencia drilled eleven core holes to reproduce eleven reverse circulation 

intersections (Table 6). The assay results for four core holes drilled in early 2008 were 

communicated to SRK in April 2008 and therefore were not considered for resource estimation. 

 

Silver assay results for each pair of twin borehole are graphically presented in Figure 14. Assay 

samples from core and reverse circulation drilling within the vein wireframes defined from reverse 

circulation data were extracted and aggregated for geostatistical analysis (Table 7).

The respective sample populations are graphically presented on Q-Q' plots (Figure 15). The analysis 

of the twin hole data suggests that the core boreholes delivered on average lower grades for all three 

metals considered. Not only the core holes failed to reproduce the average grades of each intercept, 

but the widths of silver-bearing mineralization are also different (Figure 14). Analysis of Q-Q' plots 

suggest that reverse circulation boreholes deliver higher grades than core boreholes for all grade 

categories, except for zinc.  

 

The wireframes used for extracting assay data was modelled using reverse circulation drilling data 

only. The difference in grade distribution may be partially be attributed to the wireframe 

interpretation. 

 

Nonetheless, the grade difference emphasizes the high variability of metal grades across short ranges 

within the Cachinal silver bearing deposit. This poor grade correlation is not unusual for epithermal 

vein deposits exhibiting highly variable grade on short ranges. 

 

Considering that the quality control data does not highlight any consistent material bias between the 

two drilling types RK cannot draw conclusions from the limited twin hole data available. More twin 

hole data is required to investigate the apparent bias between core and reverse circulation drilling 

samples and to study the grade variability at short ranges. 

 

A detailed analyses of within wireframe data sources used for resource estimation demonstrated that 

above 10 gpt silver grades (Figure 13) no grade bias exists between core (198 assays) and RC 

derived assays (2,825 assays). 

 

The limited twinning program in 2007 / 2008 yielded a higher variance between core and RC assays 

for silver and gold (but not for zinc). The QPs consider this variance to be caused by: 

• Data extracted within mineralization wireframes defined by RC data, with some core 
mineralization external to that 

• Different sampling methodologies used for drilled core and RC material 

• Uncertainty whether the core drilling precisely matched the collar azimuth and dip of that of 
its twinned hole

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

• Extreme differences between certain twins (like CLRC056 vs CLDD-02) suggest a human 
error associated with the sampling data 

• A poor grade correlation is not unusual for epithermal vein deposits exhibiting highly 
variable grade on short ranges 

 

The QPs do not have much confidence in the absolute differences between the sets of twin assays 

and suggest that this 5% drilling dataset is not representative of the population grade variance of the 

deposit. The QPs however strongly recommend that more well-controlled twin hole data be 

generated to investigate the apparent bias between core and reverse circulation drilling samples and 

to study the grade variability at short ranges.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 

In January 2007, SBX Consultores Ltda (on behalf of Valencia) submitted five composite samples 

for metallurgical testing at SGS Minerals Services ("SGS") (Santiago, Chile) to determine silver, 

gold and zinc extractions, as well as cyanide and lime consumption on the five samples (17876, 

17877, 17878, 17879 and 17880.) These five samples were taken from the latest core drilling and are 

generally representative of vein-hosted mineralization at the Cachinal project.  The following 

information is a summary from a memorandum report prepared by SGS and submitted to SBX 

Consultores Ltda. This report was made available to Valencia and SRK. 

 

13.1 Samples Preparation 
 

The samples were screened below 10# and put into 500-gram charges. For each sample, one charge 

was taken for assaying purposes and another charge was used for the actual cyanidation test. The 

samples taken for head assays were pulverized to 100 percent -150# and split into two sub-samples 

in order to perform the assay twice to check the reproducibility of the result. 

 

13.2 Testing 
 

The bottle cyanidation tests were carried out using 500 grams of mineral (100 percent -100#) in 33 

percent solids slurry prepared with a NaCN solution (0.5 gram per litre). The slurry was agitated 

placed in a bottle and rolled for fourty-eight hours. During this period, seven samples were taken to 

study the extraction kinetics for gold, silver and zinc. 

 

The following conditions were also followed during each test: 

 

• The NaCN concentration was kept constant (0.5 gram per litre) by adding make-up NaCN. 

• The pH was maintained between 10.5 and 11.0 and Ca(OH)2 was added to keep this variable 

in range. 

• The total weight of the reactor was also kept constant, by adding water in order to maintain 

the total volume constant throughout the test. 

 

A Buchner funnel was used to filter the slurry once the cyanidation time was completed. The cake 

was then washed with tap water. The wet cake was weighed and placed in an oven at eighty degrees 

Celsius for twenty-four hours. The sample was taken out of the oven when completely dried to cool 

off and then weighed to determine the dry weight. The residue was pulverized to 100 percent -150 # 

and assayed twice in order to check the reproducibility of the result. 

 

The concentrations of the elements of interests in the final solutions were estimated based on the 

grades of the head and the final residue for each sample. 

 

13.3 Results from the Preliminary Testing 
 

The assay values obtained for zinc and silver fall within an acceptable margin of error, whereas in 

the case of gold, the experimental error turned out to be high due to the low gold head grades. The 

assay values used in the metallurgical balances presented in this report correspond to the average 

head grade determined for each sample. 

 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 53 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

The analysis of the results did not include the gold due to the low concentrations present in all the 

cyanidation products. The highest silver recovery (76.36 percent) was observed for sample 17877, 

whereas the lowest silver recovery (14.1 percent) was observed on sample 17879. The recoveries 

observed for the rest of the tested samples were around fifty percent. The zinc recoveries were in 

general quite low. The highest zinc recovery observed was eleven percent (sample 17880). 

 

13.4 Preliminary Findings 
 

The head assays performed on the samples revealed low gold grades in three out of the five tested 

samples. Sample M-17876 exhibited the highest silver and zinc head grades, 411 g/t and 572 g/t, 

respectively. In general, the zinc recoveries were low and ranged between 2.6 and 11.9 percent. 

 

The cyanide consumption in the majority of the tested samples was high (around two kilograms per 

tonne), probably due to the presence of cyanide consuming compounds and the pH level used in the 

test. Only sample 17880 exhibited a cyanide consumption rate lower than 1.0 kilogram per tonne.  

 

To lower the cyanide consumption in future tests, it is recommended to carry out the test at a pH 

close to 11.5. The silver extraction could be increased with a finer regrind. It is also recommended to 

carry out a mineralogical study on the tested samples to supplement the results obtained in the 

cyanidation tests. 

 

 

13.5 Metallurgical Investigation 
 

In 2007, Valencia submitted five composite samples for metallurgical testing SGS laboratories in 

Santiago, Chile to determine silver, gold and zinc extractions, as well as cyanide and lime 

consumption on the five samples. Results of this initial work are summarized in this section. 

 

Since the original release of this resource evaluation in April 2008, SRK associates Starkey & 

Associates Inc. designed a more thorough program to provide information on recovery 

characteristics of the potential ore. Testwork included heap leach simulation, gravity separation, 

floatation, whole ore cyanidation and grinding tests. Following this work, SRK concluded that: 

 

• Heap leaching should not be considered at this time. Preliminary testwork indicated 

recoveries less than 50 percent for silver and less than 15 percent for gold. 

• Recovery by a gravity circuit would be poor. Gravity testwork using a Knelson concentrator 

indicated silver recovery of only 11.5 percent in 0.21 percent of weight. High gold 

recoveries were not obtained. 

• Flotation results were good, with about 88 percent of silver and 70 percent of gold recovered 

by rougher floatation pulling a weight recovery in the order of 20 percent to the flotation 

rougher concentrate. Unfortunately, only 25 percent of the zinc reported to the flotation 

concentrate. 

• The Cachinal ore is amenable to whole ore cyanidation after grinding to P80 75microns, with 

an average recovery of 85 percent for both silver and gold. 

• SAGDesign testwork concluded a Bond Ball Mill Index on SG ground material of 

18.2kWh/t. Based on a 1.75Mtpa throughput, a 24 x 11.5ft SAG mill and 16.5 x 24ft Ball 

mill are recommended. 

 

Further testing is recommended prior to beginning mining studies on the Cachinal deposit. Further 

testwork is recommended to determine optimal grind, the optimal flowsheet for whole rock 

cyanidation and the presence of deleterious elements that could impact recovery.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 
 

14.1 Introduction 
 

The mineral resource model presented herein represents a new mineral resource evaluation for the 

Cachinal silver deposit. This new mineral resource model was initially prepared to provide an 

assessment of silver zones delineated by drilling on this project and to provide Valencia management 

an independent assessment to justify additional exploration and development work. This assessment 

is now available for Aftermath management.  

 

The resource estimate was completed by Mr. Glen Cole, PGeo an independent qualified person as 

this term is defined in National Instrument 43-101. The effective date of this resource estimate is 

June 3, 2019.  

 

This section describes the work undertaken by SRK and key assumptions and parameters used to 

prepare the initial mineral resource model for the Cachinal deposit together with appropriate 

commentary regarding the merits and possible limitations of such assumptions. 

 

In the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource classification reported herein 

are a reasonable representation of the global silver and gold mineral resources found in the Cachinal 

deposit at the current level of sampling. The mineral resource estimate documented in this section 

complies with all disclosure requirements for mineral resources set out in the Instrument, including 

sections 2.2, 2.3, and 3.4. The mineral resources presented herein are reported in accordance with 

Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 (2011) and have been estimated in 

conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves 

Best Practices" guidelines (2014). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource 

will be converted into mineral reserves. Mineral reserves can only be estimated as a result of an 

economic evaluation as part of a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study of a mineral 

project. Accordingly, at the present level of development there are no mineral reserves on the 

Cachinal project. 

 

The database used to estimate the Cachinal mineral resources was audited by SRK and the 

mineralization boundaries were modelled by SRK using a geological interpretation prepared by 

Valencia personnel. SRK is of the opinion that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable 

to interpret with confidence the boundaries of the silver mineralization and that the assaying data is 

sufficiently reliable to support estimating mineral resources. Mineral Resource Statement considers 

drilling and trenching information up to January 25, 2008 and excludes additional drilling 

undertaken after this cut-off date. 

 

Geological and mineralization wireframes were constructed using Datamine modelling software. 

Statistical analysis, variography and resource estimation work was completed in Isatis Version 7.0. 

 

14.2 Mineral Resource Database 
 

The Cachinal project exploration database comprises descriptive and assaying information for a total 

of five diamond drill holes, 176 reverse circulation holes and 36 surface trenches (Table 8). This

database was assembled by Maxwell. It was provided to SRK in an electronic format. The resource 

estimation database is a sub-set of the main database.

The database was audited by SRK. For mineral resource estimation, SRK replaced assay results 

below the detection limit with zero. 

 

Downhole survey information was available for ten reverse circulation boreholes measured at ten 

metre intervals. Other boreholes have not been surveyed for downhole deviation. 

 

The final geological interpretation on vertical sections for the SE and NW portions of the deposit 

was received from the SBX on January 25, and February 4, 2008, respectively. 

 

All drilling and trench data as well as the digital vertical sections were provided to SRK using an 

UTM grid coordinate system. Resource modelling and grade estimation work has been conducted in 

UTM coordinate space (Datum: PSAD-56. Zone 19 South). 

 

A topography wireframe DTM surface was generated in Minesight software from survey point data. 

Drill collar positions honour this surface well. 

 

An overburden surface of variable thickness was generated from overburden drill log information in 

the final Maxwell drill database. No overburden is developed in the central part of the project area. 

 

The specific gravity database contains 289 records derived from measurements on drill core 

(CLDD01 to 15). A total of 171 density measurements were derived from non-vein material and 118 

from the silver-bearing veins. The average density for the vein material is 2.43, whereas the average 

waste specific gravity is 2.45 (Figure 16). The former value will be applied for modelled veins, 

whereas the latter will be applied to waste material. Although this limited dataset will suffice for the 

scoping study, it is recommended that additional specific gravity data be acquired for all lithological 

types for the next resource update. The specific gravity database is presented in Appendix B.

14.3 Evaluation of Extreme Assay Values 
 

In order to assess grade capping, probability plots were generated for assays falling within each of 

the grade shells. The composited dataset was then checked for outlier values. In general, the silver, 

gold and zinc composites belong to a single population, requiring minimal outlier treatment. 

Figure 17 illustrates a log probability curve informed with composited silver data from the northern 

zone (showing only two values that require capping). 

 

After review of log probability plots, the composited data were capped using the levels indicated in 

Table 9. 

 

14.4 Solid Body Modelling 
 

A series of NW-striking silver-bearing vein wireframes were constructed using Datamine software to 

constrain geostatistical analysis and grade estimation. This was done by applying geological 

information sourced from drilling, trenches, paper plans as well as a careful consideration of the 

sectional interpretations received from SBX.  

 

From the drilling data, five and six silver mineralization sub-parallel veins characterized by 

continuous silver (+/- gold) grades (usually above 30 g/t silver) over a minimum width of two metres 

were modelled in the 'northern zone' and 'southern zone' respectively.  

 

Two sets of fault structures were also modelled. One set define NW-SE structures, sub-parallel to the 

silver-bearing veins. The other set comprises younger ENE faults crosscutting the earlier faults and 

silver-bearing veins. The 'northern zone' is separated from the 'southern zone' by an ENE-striking 

fault zone.

Also, four main lithological types based on the drilling data were also modelled in three dimensions. 

These lithological units include:  

 

1. Overburden (varying from zero to 30 metres in thickness),  
2. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rock  
3. Mafic intrusive rock and  
4. Tuffaceous volcanic rock.  

 

Considerable variation occurs within each of these lithotypes. 

 

The impact of the mined-out areas on the resource model was considered at the geological modelling 

stage. In the final database, logging details for intersected underground workings was available for 

forty-one boreholes (out of a total of 176 reverse circulation holes). The three-dimensional position 

of these underground workings and their surveyed position on the surface were considered during the 

interpretation of the various veins on vertical sections. Modelled veins are considered as remnants of

the veins left behind the historical mine. SRK believes that this approach represents a reasonable 

interpretation for the "in situ" silver-bearing veins with the current level of information available 

about the historical mining. The approach is adequate for scoping level resource modelling and 

engineering design, but will require further investigations for feasibility level work. 

 

14.5 Compositing 
 

All assay data within the eleven modelled veins were extracted for statistical analysis. A total of 

3,293 data points was extracted from the total dataset. The majority of the assay samples were 

collected on regular 1-metre intervals. Therefore, all assay samples were composited to equal 1-

metre lengths. Figure 18 illustrates original sample lengths within modelled Vein N1 (comprising 

588 data points).

14.6 Composite Statistics 
 

A total of 3,240 composites were generated (1,146 in the north part of the deposit and 2,274 in the 

south). Summary statistics for silver from the eleven modelled veins are presented in Table 10.

14.7 Resource Estimation Methodology 
 

A block model was constructed to cover the entire extent of the Cachinal mineralization and the 

potential limits of an optimized pit. The specifications for the block model (origin and extents) are 

presented in Table 11.  

 

A Datamine sub-block routine (within the parent three by five by five metre blocks) was applied to 

fill the vein wireframes. A minimum block size was set at 0.75 by 1.25 by 1.25 metres. Each sub-

block was estimated individually. An additional regularized block model was also generated from 

the detailed sub-block model for the pit optimization process. The regularized block model is a 

'smoothed' version of the sub-blocked model derived by averaging the field values of all sub-blocks 

within a parent block. The regularized block model contains the additional fields FILLVOL and 

VOIDVOL, which sum to seventy-five square metres. Waste blocks were assigned a bulk density of 

2.45 grams per cubic centimetre while each vein mineralized block was assigned a density of 2.43 

grams per cubic centimetre.

Z 2,320 2,800 96 

 

 

14.8 Variography and Grade Interpolation 
 

Variograms were used to assess grade continuity along various ellipse axes and to determine 

appropriate grade interpolation ranges. Block grades were estimated by ordinary kriging. Normal 

scores variography for the kriging process was conducted with Isatis software for silver, gold and 

zinc. A single spherical structure variogram (including a nugget effect) was constructed and fitted for 

each modelled vein and direction for silver, gold and zinc (with rotation angles relative to the vein 

parallel reference plane set at primary = N340, secondary = N070).  

 

Variography parameters (and search distances) for all eleven modelled veins are tabulated in 

Table 12. Variograms were modelled with the reference plane inclined at seventy degrees towards 

direction N070 degrees. 

 

Metal grades were estimated into the block model using ordinary kriging and search neighbourhood 

parameters presented in Table 12. Two estimation runs were made for each modelled vein. The first 

pass considered full variogram ranges (Table 12) to estimate block grades assigned to Indicated 

Mineral Resources. The second pass considered three times the variogram ranges (Table 12) to 

estimate metal grades for Inferred Mineral Resources. The Inferred and Indicated block models were 

combined into a single block model for each vein and subsequently aggregated into a single 

composite block model for the Cachinal silver deposit. 

 

A third estimation pass was completed to assign metal grades to the blocks surrounding the silver-

bearing veins. The average mining dilution grade was determined from the average of all composites 

located outside the modelled veins, but within an enveloping 'low grade shell' defined by 

considering all drill data (this includes 11,749 data points). The mining dilution grades are presented 

in Table 13.

14.9 Mineral Resource Classification 
 

The Cachinal mineral resources were classified according to the CIM Definition Standards for 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) by Glen Cole, PGeo (APGO #1416), an 

appropriate independent qualified person for the purpose of National Instrument 43-101. 

 

The mineral resource model is largely based on geological knowledge derived from boreholes drilled 

on 50 metre sections. The Cachinal resource area is large (about 2,300 metres long and 300 metres 

wide) and although silver-bearing veins are geologically continuous and have been modelled with 

confidence, the metal grades are highly discontinuous and highly skewed towards lower values. This 

grade discontinuity is typical for this type of deposit, requiring closer-spaced drilling to improve the 

confidence in local grade estimates. In particular, no information is available for the critical short 

range (typically twenty to thirty metres). 

 

Mineral resources at Cachinal have been classified as Indicated and Inferred primarily based in the 

distance from the nearest informing composites and on variography results. All resource blocks are 

informed by a minimum of four composites with a maximum set at twenty. Mineral resource blocks 

situated within the primary ranges defined by variography are assigned an Indicated classification. 

All other resource blocks situated within three times the maximum variography ranges are assigned 

an Inferred classification. 

 

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) defines a 

mineral resource as: 

 

"a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural 

solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial 

minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality 

that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 64 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 

interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge".  

 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the quantity 

and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources are reported at 

an appropriate cut-off grade considering extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. To meet this 

requirement, the QP considers that portions of the Cachinal silver mineralization is amenable for 

open pit extraction, while the deeper parts of the deposit could be extracted using an underground 

mining method. 

 

To determine the quantities of material offering reasonable prospects for economic extraction by an 

open pit, SRK used Mintec's Minesight and the Lerchs-Grossman optimizing algorithm, which 

evaluates the profitability of each resource block based on its value. The optimization parameters are 

based on ongoing scoping studies undertaken by SRK on the Cachinal project. The reader is 

cautioned that the results from the pit optimization are used solely for reporting mineral resources 

that have "reasonable prospects" for economic extraction by an open pit. After review of several 

scenarios considering different metal prices, design criteria and operating costs assumptions, SRK 

believes the portion of the Cachinal silver deposit above a 40 g/t silver-equivalent grade and situated 

between the surface and approximately 150 metres depth shows "reasonable prospects" for economic 

extraction via open cast mining. SRK considers that the silver mineralization located below that 

elevation is amenable for underground mining using a cut-off of 150 g/t silver-equivalent to reflect 

the higher costs associated with underground mining. The silver-equivalent grades are derived using 

the 2008 metal prices and recovery assumptions presented in Table 14 considering a 5,000 tonne per 

day conventional processing mill.

SRK recently undertook a sensitivity analysis to determine if the application of current 2018 metal 

prices and cost inputs would have a material impact on the dimensions of the conceptual pit shell 

being referenced during mineral resource reporting. It was found that the application of current metal 

prices and costs did not lead to a deeper or larger conceptual pit shell. It seems likely that the 

positive impact of increased metal prices has been neutralized by the negative impact of higher 

mining and processing costs. SRK is therefore satisfied that applying the vertical elevation of 150m 

is still appropriate to segregate mineral resources amenable to open pit mining from that that 

amenable to underground mining. The applied reporting cut-off grades are also still considered to be 

reasonable.

14.10 Validation of the Block Model 
 

Various measures have been implemented to validate the produced resource block model. These 

measures include the following: 

 

• Comparison of input composited datasets with output resource block models from all 

modelled veins (including sectional visual comparisons as well as full statistical analyses 

comparisons). 

• Comparison of the Ordinary Kriging estimates with estimates derived using an inverse 

distance squared algorithm. 

• Visual comparison of original drill hole data with resource block data. 

 

14.11 Mineral Resource Statement 
 

The mineral resources for the Cachinal silver deposit are reported using two cut-offs to reflect 

reasonable prospect for economic extraction considering an appropriate extraction scenario.  

Potential opencast mining resources are reported at a cut-off of 40 g/t AgEq, which is considered 

appropriate for shallow opencast mining, whereas mineral resource below the 150 metres elevation 

are reported at a cut-off of 150 g/t AgEq. The mineral resources statement for the Cachinal silver 

deposit is presented in Table 15. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. All figures have been rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of 

the estimates. A wireframe of inferred underground workings was generated, and modeled workings 

were excluded from modeled veins.  

 

SRK has recently verified that the application of current 2018 metal prices (and costs) will not have 

a material impact on the silver equivalency formula, reporting cut-off grades and on the reported 

mineral resources and that the applied mineral resources reporting criteria are still reasonable.

subsequent Mineral Resource estimates. The Mineral Resource Statement may also be affected by 

subsequent assessments of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, legal, title, taxation, 

socio-economic, and other factors.  

 

The mineral resources are sensitive to the selection of the cut-off grade. The global tonnage and

* The reader is cautioned that the figures presented in these tables should not be misconstrued as mineral resource 
statements. The reported quantities and grades are only presented as a sensitivity of the resource model to the selection of 
cut-off grade 

 

 

The QPs consider the original March 4, 2008 mineral resource statement to still be current as the 

subsequent drilling generated after this date will not have a material impact on the mineral resource 

statement.  

 

In addition to a consideration of the spatial impact of the 'subsequent drilling' the QPs also 

considered the impact of changing commodity prices on metal equivalency calculations and pit 

optimization. A comparison between 2008 and 2018 commodity prices was undertaken. In 2008 

metal prices of US$12.50 per ounce of silver and US$650 per ounce of gold with metallurgical 

recoveries of 85% for both silver and gold was applied. For 2018 metal prices of US$20.00 per 

ounce of silver and US$1,400 per ounce of gold were considered also with metallurgical recoveries 

of 85% for both silver and gold. Zinc does not contribute to revenues and was not considered. 

 

The QPs undertook a series of sensitivities applying different input parameters determine their 

impact. Applying the optimistic 2018 metal prices and constant metallurgical recoveries for silver 

and gold and a mining rate of 5,000 tonnes per day, it was found that the pit shells drove down to a 

maximum vertical elevation of 150m below surface (similarly to that found in 2008). 

 

 The QPs found that the application of current metal prices and costs did not lead to a deeper or 

larger conceptual pit shell. It seems likely that the positive impact of increased metal prices has been 

neutralized by the negative impact of higher mining and processing costs. SRK is therefore satisfied 

that applying the vertical elevation of 150m is still appropriate to segregate mineral resources 

amenable to open pit mining from that that amenable to underground mining. SRK is also of the 

opinion that the application of a silver equivalency formula based on current metal prices will also 

not have a material difference on the reported mineral resources, primarily due to the low gold 

grades intersected within the modeled veins. It is therefore the opinion of the QPs that the March 4, 

2008 mineral resource statement, although stated at outdated commodity prices of US$12.50 per 

ounce of silver and US$650 per ounce of gold is still valid and can be regarded as 'current'. To 

reflect this opinion, the mineral; resource statement date has been revised to June 3, 2019. 

 

 

Apogee made available to SRK the drilling results from drilling completed after the cut-off date of 

the mineral resource considered in this report which comprised seventeen core boreholes, forty-three 

reverse circulation boreholes and five geotechnical core boreholes. SRK reviewed the location, 

geology and assaying results for the subsequent drilling. In the professional opinion of the qualified 

persons authoring this technical report, the subsequent drilling results would not materially impact 

on the resource evaluation prepared by SRK as documented in the original April 30, 2008 technical 

report. The results of the subsequent drilling were considered to modify the recommendations for 

additional drilling expressed in the April 30, 2008 technical report. Therefore, SRK considers that 

the Mineral Resource Statement for the Cachinal Project documented in the April 30, 2008 technical 

report remains current. The same Mineral Resource Statement was re-addressed to Apogee in a

technical report prepared by SRK dated February 9, 2010 and amended on July 8, 2010. This 

Mineral Resource Statement remains current for this technical report, which is re-addressed to 

Aftermath. 

 

For the Cachinal silver deposit, variogram ranges vary from 60 to 70 metres in the strike and dip 

direction, suggesting that a drill spacing at 25 to 30 metres should allow conversion of Indicated to 

Measured Mineral Resources. The Cachinal mineral resource model is hosted by the modeled vein 

wireframes illustrated in Figure 19. Figure 20, Figure 21 and Figure 22 present a plan view and two 

vertical sections through the Cachinal deposit.

14.12 Reconciliation with Polygonal Resource Estimate 
 

The SRK 2008 and 2019 Mineral Resource Statement supersedes an earlier mineral resource model 

prepared by Gonzales and Diaz as reported in a technical report dated February 14, 2007 (the 

"Gonzalez and Diaz model"). 

 

The Gonzalez and Diaz resource model considered sampling information from forty-two reverse 

circulation and forty surface trenches in the southern portion of the Cachinal silver deposit. The 

mineral resources were estimated using a polygonal methodology with Gemcom. Vein 

mineralization polygons were constructed from the interpretation of sampling data on vertical 

sections spaced at fifty-metre intervals 

 

Resource blocks were projected at section mid-distance and projected along the dip of the veins at 

the half distance to adjacent borehole or trench and to a maximum of twenty-five metres below the 

deepest drill intercept. The polygons were extended from the top of bedrock to a depth of 200 

metres. Blocks located at distances greater than twenty-five metres from the nearest borehole, were 

classified as inferred and assigned grades based on the nearest adjacent polygons. 

 

A total of 128 polygons were constructed (84 Indicated polygons and 44 Inferred polygons) and 

assigned a grade based on the weighted average grade of the borehole or trench assay data. Inferred 

polygons metal grades were derived from the nearest adjacent Indicated polygons. Where sufficient 

information was available, mined out areas were excluded from the interpreted vein polygons. 

 

An average specific gravity of 2.5 was used to convert volumes into tonnages. Mineral resources 

were tabulated at various cut-off grades and reported at a cut-off grade of 20.0 g/t silver, without 

considering gold revenues and metallurgical recoveries. 

 

The direct comparison between the SRK resource model with the Gonzalez and Diaz February 2007 

polygonal model is difficult, because the two models considers different areas and are reported using 

different reporting assumptions. 

 

The SRK model extends over the entire strike length of the deposit (from sections 1,250 metres 

NNW to 1,000 metres SSE) and includes resource blocks to a depth of 250 metres. 

 

The mineral resources were estimated using a geostatistical block modelling approach constrained by 

vein mineralization wireframes interpreted from the drilling data. Mined out areas were removed 

during wireframing. The mineral resources are reported using a silver equivalent grade taking into 

account reasonable metallurgical recoveries. 

 

The Gonzalez and Diaz model considers the southern portion of the deposit (from sections 00 metre 

SSE to 675 metres SSE) to a depth of 200 metres. The mineral resources were estimated using a 

polygonal methodology with metal grades derived from weighted averages of assay data interesting 

polygons, without geostatistical analysis. The mineral resources were reported using a silver cut-off 

grade without considering metallurgical recoveries.  

 

In order to attempt to reconcile the two resource models, the global quantities and grades at various 

cut-offs were re-tabulated from the SRK block model for the Southern Zones area only to a depth of 

200 metres. This area approximates the volume area considered by the Gonzalez and Dias February 

2007 model.  

 

The global quantities and grades at various cut-offs for the SRK 2019 and Gonzalez and Diaz models 

are presented in Table 17 and Table 18 . SRK notes that the figures reported in the technical report

filed on SEDAR differ from those extracted from a mineral resource spreadsheet provided by 

Valencia. The figures reported for 80, 100 and 120 g/t silver cut-offs are considerably less than those 

extracted from the spreadsheet (refer to Table 19). It must also be noted that the SRK Mineral 

Resource Statement is reported at a silver equivalent cut-off considering metallurgical recoveries of 

eighty-five percent for gold and silver.

The differences between the two models are summarized in Table 20 for two cut-off grades. At a 

cut-off grade of 40 g/t silver equivalent considered by SRK to be reasonable for reporting open pit 

resources for this project, the SRK model reports approximately 43 percent less tonnes and 

50 percent less silver and gold. At the cut-off grade used by Gonzales and Diaz, the SRK model 

forecasts approximately 45 percent less silver and gold for a tonnage approximately 25 percent less. 

At all cut-off grades global quantities and grades are considerably less than those predicted by the 

Gonzalez and Diaz model. 

 

The impact of using a silver equivalent grade to report resources is that the SRK global quantities 

and grades are marginally larger than if a silver cut-off was applied. The differences are not material 

to the comparison.

15 Adjacent Properties 
 

Three small older mining concessions with preferential rights located on mining concessions Silvana 

3 and 4, highlighted in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 12 are located adjacent to the mineralization 

delineated on the Cachinal project. The presence or continuity of mineralization of these concessions 

in not known by the qualified persons of this report. 

 

Although there are no other significant adjacent properties that are considered directly relevant to the 

mineral resource reported in this technical report, Austral Gold's Guanaco Gold Project, comprising 

the Guanaco and Amancaya mines, is located approximately 16 kilometres to the south of the 

Cachinal project. Although geologically not related to the mineral resource reported in this technical 

report, the Guanaco Gold Project merely demonstrates the ability to build and operate a precious 

metal operation in the Cachinal district.  

 

The information below is extracted from the Roscoe Postle Associates (2017) technical report on the 

Guanaco Gold Project.   

 

The Guanaco Gold Project deposits are considered an example of a high-sulphidation epithermal 

deposit. The Guanaco Gold Project has produced approximately 50,000 ounces of gold per year for 

the last four years from a heap leach operation. In late 2017, a new processing plant was 

commissioned, designed to treat up to 1,500 tonnes per day using crushing, grinding, agitated 

cyanide leaching and Merrill-Crowe to produce doré. Ore is sourced from underground at Guanaco 

and from Amancaya, a satellite deposit, where ore is hauled by contractor via a 75-kilometre road.  

 

The Guanaco camp has capacity for 333 people. Power is a 34.8-kilometre long, 33-kilovolt power 

line and substation that were constructed to transport power from the Central Interconnected System 

(SIC, Sistema Interconectado Central) to the Guanaco operations. Diesel generators provide backup 

power generation. The Guanaco Gold Project operations have water rights to 18.79 litres per second: 

4.84 litres per second, that is sourced from a surface catchment area and piped under gravity 

30 kilometres to Guanaco, with the remaining 13.95 litres per second from wells.   

 

The underground operations at Guanaco and Amancaya are designed to produce approximately 

1,000 tonnes per day and 800 tonnes per day, respectively. Open pit operations at Amancaya 

commenced early 2017 are planned to produce 400 tonnes per day. Each operation will overlap to 

produce an average mill feed of approximately 1,000 tonnes per day during peak production in 2017 

and 2018.  

 

The mineral resources and reserves for the Guanaco Gold Project as of December 31, 2016 are 

tabulated in Table 21 and Table 22. The qualified person is unable to verify this information and 

cautions that this information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property that 

is the subject of the technical report

16 Other Relevant Data and Information 
 

 

 

 

 

16.1 Mineral Potential of Exploration Targets 
 

JORC (2012, Section 18) and National Instrument 43-101 (Section 2.3, sub-paragraph 2) recognize 

that it is appropriate to comment on and discuss exploration results in terms of mineral potential 

provided that such information relating to exploration targets is not misconstrued as an estimate of 

Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves. Mineral potential must be expressed as ranges, include a 

detailed explanation of the basis for the statement, and a proximate statement that the potential 

quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient exploration to define a 

mineral resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a 

mineral resource. 

 

The mineral potential was evaluated by SRK to provide a range of quantities and grades for each 

target and assist Aftermath  management to prioritize the recommended drilling program. The 

summary statement of potential for each target is expressed explicitly on the basis that the potential 

range of quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a 

mineral resource and it is uncertain if additional drilling will result in the delineation of a mineral 

resource on the target. 

 

SRK is satisfied that the disclosure of mineral potential follows the National Instrument 43-101 

guidance in relation to mineral disclosure of exploration targets. The mineral potential is expressed 

as a range of quantity and grade, with explanation of the basis of the statement. Mineral potential is 

only recognized where supported by one or more intersections with grade and width that meet 

current economic parameters for mineral resources, or where the lateral extent of mineralization is 

supported by physical sampling that indicates economic parameters will be met, or where the lateral 

extent of mineralization is known, and its characteristics may be assessed on the basis of 

immediately adjacent similar, economically delineated mineralization. 

 

The mineral resources for the Cachinal silver deposit are reported by SRK at two cut-offs based on 

reasonable prospects for economic extraction by open pit and underground mining. In assessing the 

mineral potential for the exploration targets, the potential ranges of quantity and grades were 

evaluated on the basis of potential silver mineralization above the respective cut-off grades used for 

reporting mineral resources for this deposit. 

 

For each target, a polygonal interpretation of the potential vein structure was constructed and sub-

divided at the 150-metre depth threshold used for reporting open pit resources. The ranges of 

quantity are obtained by multiplying the surface area of the potential vein structure by its potential 

ranges of thicknesses, based on existing drilling information and observed thickness variations for 

each specific vein structure. The potential quantities above cut-off were estimated using the grade 

tonnage characteristics specific to the Cachinal deposit. The open pit mineral resources reported at a 

cut-off of 40 g/t silver equivalent grade to a depth of 150 metres represent approximately 44 percent 

of the tonnage for the modelled silver-bearing vein structures. Conversely, the underground mineral 

resource reported at 150 g/t silver equivalent grade represent only five percent of the tonnage 

contained in the modelled veins. Accordingly, the ranges of open pit and underground quantities of 



3CA054.000 – Aftermath Silver Ltd. 
Independent Technical Report for the Cachinal Silver-Gold Project, Region II, Chile Page 81 

 

 

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

potential mineralization are obtained by multiplying the ranges of vein quantity by the ratio above 

cut-off. 

 

SRK reviewed the statistical distribution of the silver block grades in the Cachinal deposit. The range 

of grades for each target is derived from the average grade of the mineral resources above the 

respective cut-off grade and is expressed as a range of silver grade 20 percent below and above the 

mean resource grade of 100 g/t and 180 g/t silver for open pit and underground potential, 

respectively.  

 

The mineral potential is summarized in Error! Reference source not found.. The aggregated open 

pit mineral potential is estimated at between 1.1 and 2.8 million tonnes grading between 80 to 120 

g/t silver, or between 2.9 and 10.9 million potential ounces of silver to a depth of 150 metres. The 

underground mineral potential is estimated at between 0.1 and 0.2 million tonnes grading between 

144 and 216 g/t silver or between 0.3 and 1.5 million potential ounces of silver below 150 metres to 

a depth of 250 metres. The underground mineral potential below the 250-metre depth has not been 

evaluated.

* The reported ranges of potential quantity and grade are conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient exploration to define 
a mineral resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a mineral resource. The reported 
mineral potential is expressed as ranges of tonnage and grade based on sampling data, interpreted continuity and range of 
thicknesses for each vein structure. Potential quantity range is derived from the ratio between the tonnage of each vein structure 
and tonnage above cut-off in the Cachinal mineral resources, 44 and 5 percent for open pit and underground resources, 
respectively. Ranges of grade are based on ranges about the mean resource grade. 

 

The summary statement of potential for each target is expressed explicitly on the basis that the potential 

range of quantity and grade is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral 

resource and it is uncertain if additional drilling will result in the delineation of a mineral resource on the 

target.

17 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 

SRK reviewed and audited the exploration data available for the Cachinal project. This review 

suggests that the exploration data generated by Valencia is generally reliable for the purpose of 

resource estimation. 

 

SRK was impressed by a geological interpretation provided by Valencia personnel to construct 

geological and silver mineralization wireframes using Datamine software. Eleven separate silver 

mineralization wireframes were interpreted and modelled.  

 

Following geostatistical analysis and variography, SRK constructed a new mineral resource block 

model for the Cachinal silver deposit constraining grade interpolation to within the eleven silver 

mineralization domains. After validation and classification, SRK used preliminary pit optimization 

routines to assess the portions of the Cachinal deposit that shows reasonable prospects for economic 

extraction from an open pit. A pit shell was used to report an open pit resource at cut-off grade of 40 

g/t silver equivalent, while the resource blocks external to the selected pit shell are reported as an 

underground resource at a cut-off grade of 150 g/t silver equivalent to reflect reasonable prospects 

for economic extraction by bulk underground methods. 

 

Mineral resources for the Cachinal deposit have been estimated in conformity with generally 

accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" Guidelines. In 

the opinion of SRK, the block model resource estimate and resource classification reported herein 

are a reasonable representation of the global zinc, gold and silver mineral resources found in the 

Cachinal deposit. There is some uncertainty regards the precise location of the full extent of 

historical workings, which presents a risk to the estimate. Additional drill data will provide more 

confidence to the definition of the modeled mineralization-hosting veins which may impact the 

volumetrics of the mineral resource model. The apparent discrepancy between the twinned reverse 

circulation and core drilling-derived assays should be investigated. 

 

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There 

is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 

 

The drilling data generated after January 2008, would not materially impact the resource evaluation 

prepared by SRK as documented in the original April 30, 2008 technical report. The results of the 

subsequent drilling would not alter the recommendations for additional drilling expressed in the 

April 30, 2008 technical report. SRK therefore considers that the Mineral Resource Statement for the 

Cachinal Project documented in the April 30, 2008 technical report remains current 

 

In reviewing the mineral resource model and comparing against previous estimates, SRK draws the 

following conclusions: 

 

• A cut-off of 40 g/t silver equivalent is considered appropriate for potential opencast mining 

resources. 

• The SRK model reports approximately 43 percent less tonnes and 50 percent less silver and 

gold at a cut-off grade of 40 g/t silver. 

• The SRK model forecasts approximately 45 percent less silver and gold for a tonnage 

approximately 25 percent less at a cut-off grade used by Gonzales and Diaz. 

• At all cut-off grades, global quantities and grades are considerably less than those predicted 

by the Gonzalez and Diaz model.

• A drilling spacing at 25 to 30 metres should allow conversion of Indicated to Measured 

mineral resources.

18 Recommendations 
 

The geological and mineral resource models were reviewed to identify any potential target areas 

warranting additional drilling. Each vein structure was closely examined on vertical sections to 

identify areas where additional drilling would positively impact the geological interpretation and 

possibly extend the vein model along strike and down-dip. 

 

Three types of targets are identified. The first target type consists of extensions of existing veins 

along strike and down-dip beyond the available drilling information. The current geology and 

resource model has been cut to the north and south at the end of the drilling information, but the vein 

structures remain open at both ends and untested below the 250 metres depth. SRK is of the opinion 

that additional drilling will extend the silver mineralization further to the north and south and at 

depth. 

 

The second target type consists of new vein structures intersected during the latest drilling and for 

which there are not enough drilling intersections to model a vein structure with confidence. One such 

target is located towards the south end of the deposit where a few boreholes suggest the presence of 

several vein splays. The other target area is located in the northern part of the deposit, to the west of 

the main vein structure. 

 

The third target type consists of vein segments where the current drilling data suggest poor silver 

mineralization. In many instances, the resource model is driven by a few low-grade boreholes that 

sterilize the vein structure on some vertical sections. Considering the silver grade distribution 

observed in the Cachinal deposit, SRK considers that additional infill drilling in those areas may help 

constrain better the barren vein segments and therefore "upgrade" those areas. Two main targets of 

this type occur in the northern part of the deposit. 

 

Twelve target areas were identified by SRK as illustrated in Figure 23. Each target was assessed in 

terms of size, quality of the potential silver vein mineralization and potential quantities and grades. 

After review,  the qualified persons designed a drill program to adequately test these targets, based 

on drilling two holes per section on average; one-hole testing at about the 100-metre elevation and 

the second at about 200-metre elevation. 

 

When this technical report was originally prepared, drilling at Cachinal was ongoing. Subsequent to 

the preparation of this technical report Valencia completed an additional seventeen core boreholes, 

forty-three reverse circulation boreholes and five geotechnical core boreholes (the "subsequent 

drilling"). The subsequent drilling aimed at infilling the deposit to fifty metre sections in the northern 

part of the deposit, testing the depth extensions of the deposit below the mineral resources and 

testing other exploration targets outside the resource areas. Some of the subsequent drilling tested 

some recommended drilling targets. In consideration for the subsequent drilling, the recommended 

drilling program was revised by the QPs, to remove targets tested by the subsequent drilling. No 

drilling has been undertaken on the project since the 'subsequent' drilling program. The revised final 

recommended drilling program comprises seventy-nine boreholes totalling 11,800 metres. 

 

SRK propose a phased approach to advancing the Cachinal project. In addition to the strategic 

exploration drilling outlined above, additional exploration and engineering activities such as satellite 

surveys, database management and metallurgical testwork will need to be undertaken. SRK support 

the

From : Carey y Cía. 

Ref. : Legal Opinion on Minera Cachinal S.A.'s Mining Concessions 

Date : May 31, 2019 

 

 

Dear Mr. Hurd, 

 

To update our legal opinion issued on March 29, 2018, we have reviewed updated information, 

requested by us from public registries or available in public databases1, related to Minera Cachinal 

S.A. ("Cachinal") and its mining concessions, and a new version of the cadastral report prepared by 

the independent mining expert Mr. Juan Bedmar (the "Technical Report")2. Based on these 

documents, we prepared the below report, which contains our observations from the review of 

Cachinal and 16 groups of already constituted exploitation mining concessions, located in the 

borough of Taltal, Region of Antofagasta, which are registered under the name of Cachinal. 

 

Aftermath Silver ("Aftermath") has an interest in acquiring a controlling interest over Cachinal. The 

goal of the project would be for Aftermath to acquire all the shares that Apogee Silver Ltd. has of 

Cachinal, which correspond to 80% of the shares. 

 

For a better understanding of the observations and conclusions of this opinion, we include, as Annex 

1, an overview of the Chilean Mining Law. 

 

A. EXECUTIVE SUMARY 

 

• Cachinal is a closed corporation (277,587 shares), dully constituted, valid and in full force. 

The company was created on December 9th, 2013, and its current shareholders are: 

 

Silver Standard Resources, Inc. : 55,516 shares 19.9995% 

Silver Standard Ventures, Inc. : 1 share 0.00036% 
Apogee Silver Ltd. : 222,070 shares 80.00014% 

 

• All Mining Concessions are currently valid and registered under the name of Cachinal. 

 

• Except for the observations made below, the Mining Concessions have been properly 

granted. 

 

• The Mining Concessions have preferential rights over the area covered by them. 

 

• Please note that according with the payment receipts of the annual mining licenses of the 
Mining Concessions, the National Geology and Mining Service's database3 and the 

Technical Report we can conclude that: (i) the mining licenses of the Mining Concessions 

have been duly paid until the period 2018-2019; and (ii) regarding the period 2019-2020 the 

mining licenses of the Mining Concessions were extemporary and partially paid for, with the 

exception of "Silvana 2, 1/30" and "Silvana 3, 1/59". Accordingly, the Mining Concessions, 

with the exceptions pointed out, could be included, during June 2019, in the auction lists due 

to non-payment of the mining licenses. In order to exclude the Mining Concessions from the 

auction lists it has to be paid the double of the non-paid amount until the public auction date.

B. LEGAL OPINION 

 

II. MINERA CACHINAL S.A. 

 

a. CORPORATE SITUATION 
 

Cachinal was created on December 9th, 2013, as a result of a corporate division. 

 

The originating company was Minera Silver Standard Chile S.A. ("Minera Silver"), which had two 

partners: (i) Silver Standard Resources, Inc. ("SSR") with 28,711 shares, and (ii) Silver Standard 

Ventures, Inc. ("SSV") with 1 share. 

 

Minera Silver was divided into three companies: (i) Minera Silver Standard Chile S.A, (ii) Minera 

Cachinal S.A., and (iii) Minera Juncal y La Flora S.A. The assets were divided among the resulting 

companies: 11 mining concessions for Cachinal, 11 mining concessions for Juncal y La Flora, and 96 

mining concessions and also some water rights for Minera Silver. 

 

SSR and SSV kept the same ratio of participation on these new entities as they had in the original 

corporation. 

 

On April 18th, 2016, Cachinal made the following capital increase: 

 

i. Company capital was increased from     $151,904,347 CLP (approx.  $252,161 USD) to 
ii. $1,468,610,275 CLP (approx. $2,437,893 USD). 

iii. 248,875 new shares were issued, which, when added to the original 28,712 shares, gave a 
total amount of shares of 277,587. 

iv. SSR subscribed 26,805 additional shares, ending up with a total of 55,516 shares of 
Cachinal. SSR relinquished its right to subscribe any more shares. 

v. SSV relinquished its right to subscribe any shares. 
vi. It was agreed that the remaining shares, 222,070, would be offered to Apogee Silver Ltd. 

("Apogee"), who would be allowed to pay for the shares through the transfer of mining 

resources study which includes probing and other costs over the mining concessions of 

Cachinal. 

 

On April 18th, 2016, Apogee subscribed 222,070 shares of Cachinal, equivalent to the 80.00014% of 

interest over the company. The shares were paid for by the transfer of the aforementioned study, 

payment which was accepted by Cachinal. This means that these shares are fully paid for by Apogee. 

 

The current corporate ownership composition of Cachinal, corroborated by Cachinal's shareholders 

registry, is the following: 

 

• SSR: 55,516 shares 19.9995%  

• SSV: 1 share  0.00036%  

• Apogee: 222,070 shares 80.00014% 

 

 

b. CONCLUSIONS 
 

1. Validity. Cachinal was properly created and duly incorporated under Chilean law. As of 
May 9, 2019, there are no records indicating the partners have terminated the corporation.

GC / jfc - ah  October 30, 2019 

2. Partners. Cachinal has only three partners: SSR, SSV and Apogee. 
3. Capital and Shares. The corporate capital is USD$2,113,594, divided among 277,587 

shares. There are no special or preferential classes of shares, being all of them equal. All the 

capital and shares have been fully subscribed and paid. 

4. Shareholders agreements. According to the information and statements provided by 
Cachinal, until March 29, 2018, there are no shareholders agreements or any other 

commitment among the partners. 

5. Management. Cachinal is managed by a 5-member board, elected at the shareholders 
general assembly, and by a CEO, designated by the board.

Cachinal acquired the Mining Concessions as follows: (i) the "Silvana" and "Katherine" groups of 

mining concessions were contributed by Minera Silver Standard Chile S.A. at the moment of 

Cachinal's incorporation, and (ii) the "Cachinal" groups of mining concessions were acquired from 

Compañía Minera Valencia Ventures Chile Limitada on June 6th, 2016. 

 

The Mining Concessions are two groups of contiguous mining concessions, for a total property area 

of 4,867 hectares. Please note that the surface of the mining concessions "Silvana 3, 1 al 59" and 

"Silvana 4, 1 al 30" were reduced during their measurement operation in order to respect the surface

area of three older mining concessions with preferential rights, named "Carmela", "Pastora", and 

"Victoria". Details of this can be seen on Annex 2 of this report. 

 

The total annual 2019 mining license tax for Mining Concessions was CLP$23,533,405 - or 

US$33,868.81-, using an exchange rate of CLP$694.84 to one US dollar. Details of the payment of 

the mining licenses and also a summary of them can be found on Annex 3. 

 

b. CONCLUSIONS 
 

6. Ownership. According to the ownership certificates issued by the Custodian of Mines of 
Taltal on May 16 and 17, 2019, Cachinal is the registered owner of all the Mining 

Concessions. 

7. Preferential Rights. According to Technical Report, dated May 15 and 27, 2019, issued by 
the Mining Engineer Mr. Juan Bedmar Rivera, all the Mining Concessions have preferential 

rights over their respective area. Furthermore, according to the maps obtained from the 

National Cadastre of the National Mining Service ("Sernageomin"), there would be no third 

parties mining concessions overlapping the Mining Concessions. These maps can be seen in 

Annex 2. 

8. Mining Licenses. According to 146 of the Mining Code provides that if the owner of a 
mining concession does not pay the mining license opportunely, the Chilean National 

Treasury Office ("Treasury") will be entitled to initiate a judicial procedure to publicly 

auction such mining concession. 

 

The affected mining concession can be excluded from the auction before such auction is executed, 

by paying an amount equivalent to twice the unpaid mining licenses. If the latter does not occur, the 

affected mining concession will be auctioned, and if there are no bidders on such mining 

concessions, the Court will declare it as "terreno franco" (free space or terminated). 

 

According to payment receipts, the information available in public sources4 and the Technical 

Report, only the annual mining licenses of "Silvana 2, 1 to 30" and "Silvana 3, 1 to 59" were entirely 

paid for the period 2019-2020. 

 

The rest of the annual mining licenses of the Mining Concessions5 regarding the period 2019-2020 

were partially and extemporary paid on April 17, 2019, assuring the good standing of some hectares 

of each group of the Mining Concessions. 

 

Even though these partial payments are registered in the Treasury website, it also states that the 

amount owed equals to the total mining licenses value. Therefore, these Mining Concessions will be 

totally included in the auction lists. We suggest paying the entire licenses amount in order to assure 

the exclusion of the concessions and their good standing. The overpaid amounts, if any, could be 

attributed to the payment of the 2020-2021 mining licenses, if it is required. 

 

In addition, all the mining licenses of the Mining Concessions until the period 2018-2019 have been 

duly paid; except for the 2005 period for "Silvana 1, 1 al 60" and "Silvana 8, 1 al 30" concessions, 

which appear to be unpaid according to the Technical Report and the website of Sernageomin. 

Notwithstanding the above, the statute of limitations to initiate this judicial action procedure is three 

years according to third paragraph of article 146 of the Mining Code, which for the mining 

concessions "Silvana 1, 1 al 60" and "Silvana 8, 1 al 30" has already elapsed. 

 

Annex 3 describes the current status of the Mining Concessions regarding payment of mining 

licenses.

9. Royalties. We could not find any royalty agreements taxing the Mining Concessions in any 
of the documents we reviewed. 

10. Mortgages, Encumbrances, Prohibitions and Litigation. The official certificates issued 
by the Custodian of Mines of Taltal on May 16 and 17, 2019, declare there are no 

mortgages, encumbrances, prohibitions or any litigation affecting any of the Mining 

Concessions. 

 

Notwithstanding the above, we noticed the certificates declare that the Custodian of Mines reviewed 

the registries only from a specific year onwards and not from the year the concession was granted6. 

This means that technically the certificates do not prove whether or not there is any Mortgage, 

Encumbrance, Prohibition or Litigation affecting the concessions from before the year the Custodian 

of Mines declared it made its revision. Even though, the registrations of the measurement minute and 

final award of the Mining Concessions in the relevant Custodian of Mines, do not have any 

annotation related to mortgages, encumbrances, prohibitions and/or litigation. 

 

6. Other observations regarding the Mining Concessions. 

 

6.1. "Silvana 3, 1 al 30". The registration of the judicial award contains an error in coordinate V27 

North of the mining concession, which mentions "2.240.500,00" instead of the correct coordinate 

"7.240.500,00". This error does not appear neither in the registration of the measurement minutes 

nor the publication of the abstract of the judicial award, both of which refer to the correct coordinate. 

 

Considering the prior, in our opinion this is most likely a transcription error on the judicial award or 

its registration, but in either case it can be amended. 

 

In any case, we do not consider that this situation may imply negative consequences for the mining 

concessions, as more than 4 years have elapsed since the publication of the abstract and therefore the 

statute of limitation established in section 2 of the article 96 of the Mining Code becomes applicable. 

 

6.2. "Cachinal" mining concessions. According to article 90 of the Mining Code, the publication of 

the abstract of the judicial award of all these groups of mining concessions should have mentioned 

the year of their court file number and the date of filing of their corresponding exploration claims, as 

they were filed by making use of the preferential rights derived from a prior exploration mining 

concession. However, the publications of their corresponding abstracts do not mention this 

information. 

In any case, we do not consider that this situation may imply negative consequences for the mining 

concessions, as more than 4 years have elapsed since the publication of the abstract and therefore the 

statute of limitation established in section 2 of the article 96 of the Mining Code becomes applicable.

2 In the case of all the "Silvana" and "Katherine" mining concessions groups, the Custodian of Mines declared 

to have reviewed its registries from 2014 onward, even though these concessions were granted before  that. 

Regarding the "Cachinal" concessions groups, the Custodian of mines declared to have reviewed its registries 

from 2016 onward, despite these concessions being granted before that.

6.3. "Cachinal 21A, 1 al 60". The registration of the judicial award contains an error in 

coordinate L1 East of the mining concession, which mentions "445.700,00" instead of the correct 

coordinate "444.700,00". We confirmed that this is a transcription error on the registration, as the 

judicial award mentions the correct coordinates. This error can be amended by a request to the 

Custodian of Mines, and in our opinion,  it does not imply any negative consequence for the mining 

concession. 

 

6.4. "Cachinal 24A, 1 al 60". The registration of the judicial award contains an error the year of 

registration of the exploitation claim, indicating "2008" instead of the correct year "2009". We 

confirmed that this is a transcription error on the registration, as the judicial award mentions the 

correct year. This error can be amended by a request to the Custodian of Mines, and in our opinion,  

it does not imply any negative consequence for the mining concession. 

 

III. C.  OTHER ASSETS. 
 

Environmental Permits. According to the information provided by Mr. César López from Cachinal, 

there are no environmental permits requested or granted for any project involving the Mining 

Concessions. 

 

Water rights. According to the information provided by Mr. César López from Cachinal, there are 

no water rights owned by Cachinal.
