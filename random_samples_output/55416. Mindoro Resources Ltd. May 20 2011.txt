3.2 Economic Analysis 

The PEA economic model prepared by Mindoro indicates a nickel project based on hydrometallurgical 
processing justifies further investigation. Mindoro has commenced a pre-feasibility study (PFS) on the Agata 
Nickel Project. 

An economic analysis using the discounted cashflow (DCF) methodology has been prepared based on the 
high pressure acid leach (HPAL) and atmospheric leaching (AL) and saprolite neutralisation (SN) 
hydrometallurgical process described in this report.    

The project has a net present value (NPV) of USD390 M at a 10% after tax discount rate. Based on the 
mining schedules, capital and operating costs and a long term nickel price of USD10 per pound. 

A summary of the PEA financial model is presented Table 3-2. The currency for all estimates is US dollars 
(USD)  

Table 3-2: Summary of Financial Analysis Results 

Nickel Price USD/lb USD8.50 USD10 USD12 

NPV (10% discount rate) Post Tax USD M 160 390 680 

IRR Post Tax % 14% 19% 26% 

 

Sensitivity analysis also shows that the project is robust to changes in economic modelling assumptions. The 
analysis has identified that the project is most sensitive to factors which impact on revenue (nickel price, feed 
grade and recovery) followed by capital costs. The project is least sensitive to operating cost estimates. 

3.2.1 Capital Costs 

The project costs are presented in Table 3-3 are estimated in February 2011 US dollar (USD) values.

3.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis 

Sensitivity analysis also shows that the project is robust to changes in economic modelling assumptions.  
The analysis has identified that the project is most sensitive to factors which impact on Revenue (nickel 
price, feed grade and recovery) followed by capital costs. The project is least sensitive to operating cost 
estimates. The relative sensitivity of the project to revenue, capital and operating cost estimates is illustrated 
in the sensitivity chart below. 

 

Figure 3-1: Sensitivity Analysis 

The sensitivity analysis undertaken on the financial model has identified revenue assumptions as the highest 
risk factor in the financial performance of the Agata Project.

3.3 Mining Operations 

3.3.1 Mining Schedule 

A preliminary mining and plant feed schedule referred to in this PEA as the "mining inventory" was 
developed for the first 15 years of operations. 

The mining inventory input to the mine production schedule (Table 3-6) is a subset of the Mineral Resource 
from the September 2010 NI43-101 estimate. The Mineral Resource was categorised into six material types 
according to iron grade in the limonite zone and magnesium grade in the saprolite zone for preparation of the 
mining inventory. 

The mining inventory includes Measured and Indicated Resources and approximately 5% of the mining 
inventory is Inferred Resources. No Mineral Reserve is estimated. The estimation of a "mining inventory" for 
input to a preliminary economic assessment is considered reasonable for a conceptual study.   

An open pit optimisation (Lerchs Grossman) evaluation was not completed to define the economic open pit 
limit. The pit shell used to develop the mining inventory was based on the lower the saprolite contact surface 
generated from available drill hole data. This method is considered reasonable for a conceptual study. An 
evaluation of economic cut-off grades and open pit limits is recommended as a further study.   

Table 3-6: Mining Inventory Estimate 

Mining Inventory Mbcm Mdmt Ni% Co% Fe% Mg% Al% AiO2% 

Ore 19.1 26.1 1.06 0.06 24.0 11.2 1.6 27.4 

Waste 5.2 8.3       

Total 24.3 34.4       

 

The pit shell was split into 63 mining panels generally 250 m × 250 m in lateral extents. Three mining areas 
A, B and C were delineated based on geography and grade characterisation. This level of detail is 
considered adequate for a preliminary schedule for a conceptual study.  

The mining panels were scheduled in several iterations (over 60 quarterly periods commencing January 
2014) and sequenced to generate a plant feed schedule (V9d) that maximised nickel production in the early 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 7 

 

years, but also maximised mineralisation feed to high pressure acid leach, saprolite neutralisation and 
Atmospheric Leach circuits. The mine production schedule by quarter and area is shown in Figure 3-2.  

Mining will be carried by open pit method using excavators, articulated dump trucks and ancillary support 
fleet. The mining schedule was smoothed over quarterly periods with mine production commencing at a rate 
of 3 400 bcm per day, peaking in Year 10 at 6 700 bcm per day. The average mine production rate over 
15 years is 5 400 bcm per day.

The schedule allows for the ramp-up of plant feed throughput over the first 3 years of operation to 
1 786 000 dmt per annum (Figure 3-3) which is maintained for the duration of the schedule. Plant feed is 
constrained by a limonite/saprolite ratio of 1:1.67 and a saprolite neutralisation/HPAL ratio of 0.35. Nickel 
metal production peaks at 18 500t per annum in Year 3. 

 

Figure 3-3: Plant Feed and Material Type 

3.3.2 Conclusions 

The mining inventory representing the estimated mill feed tonnage and quality includes Indicated and 
Inferred Resources. Approximately 5% of the mining inventory is classified as an Inferred Resource. No 
Measured Resource is currently reported in this PEA or previous Technical Reports documenting the Mineral 
Resource estimate. 

No Mineral Reserve estimate is reported in this PEA prepared as a conceptual level study. Mindoro has 
committed to proceeding with a PFS. 

The mineral inventory and scheduling are reasonable for the level of study. 

The equipment sizing used in the planning is appropriate for the size and style of operation and mining 
selectivity.  

3.3.3 Recommendations 

� Carry out fleet selection study based on version 9d schedule 

� Carry out marginal cut-off grade study on material type categories based on March 2011 processing 
and financial models. 

� Develop mining dilution and mineralisation loss criteria for application in future mining studies. 

� Open pit optimisation to be run for future mine planning to improve delineate open pit deposit. 

� Optimise mining and plant feed schedules with consideration to optimise stockpile balancing.

3.4 Processing and Plant Design 

3.4.1 Mineral Processing Background 

A scoping study undertaken in 2010 examined three options for hydrometallurgical processing as follows: 

� Base Case – Separate leaching circuits for saprolite and limonite mineralisation followed by solution 
purification and metal refining. The design total nickel production in this option was 27,400 t/a. 

� Increased Throughput Case (Also identified as Option 1) – Similar to the Base Case with a larger 
throughput to produce 42,000 t/a nickel. 

� Atmospheric Leaching Case (Also identified as Option 2) – Saprolite leaching circuit only to produce 
14,300 tpa of nickel contained in a mixed hydroxide product (MHP). 

This PEA includes a review of the 2010 Scoping Study and updated mine schedule and has incorporated 
changes to the process flowsheet based on metallurgical testwork results from the most recent testwork 
program. The key design feed and production parameters for the favoured option in the updated study, as 
adopted for the PEA, are presented in Table 3-8.

3.4.2 Plant Design 

3.4.2.1 Processing Technology 

In the process plant, limonite mineralisation is treated by conventional high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) 
and saprolite mineralisation is treated by a parallel atmospheric leach (AL) circuit.  

The process design for the leach plant will be based largely on the hydrometallurgical route proven at Moa 
Bay in Cuba for 5 decades and at the Sumitomo/Nickel Asia operated Coral Bay Nickel Project (Coral Bay) in

the Philippines since 2005. The leach flowsheet incorporates high pressure acid leaching and counter-
current decantation. 

Limonite and low magnesium saprolite mineralisation will be treated by conventional HPAL and medium 
magnesium saprolite mineralisation will be treated by a parallel atmospheric leach (AL) circuit. The PEA 
design throughput has been based on 1 Mtpa of mineralisation feed to HPAL (resulting in a HPAL circuit 
smaller in scale than that employed at Coral Bay). This was chosen because both autoclave trains at Coral 
Bay had very fast ramp-ups to full production. Autoclave throughput is based on 31% solids in the autoclave 
feed slurry (after direct steam heating).  

Additionally, the recent start of construction at the Taganito Nickel Project (a sister company of Coral Bay 
Nickel Company (CBNC)) in the Surigao District, also employing the HPAL process, is considered to be a 
major step towards launching the region into the ranks of globally important nickel laterite processing zones.   

A parallel atmospheric leaching circuit will treat about 38% of the saprolite mineralisation fed to the process. 
Atmospheric acid leaching is well established technology practised in many industries over several decades. 
Atmospheric Leaching of nickel laterites has gained recognition recently as an alternative to the high capital 
cost HPAL route, and was operated in parallel to the HPAL circuit at Ravensthorpe. The process is currently 
being investigated by Weda Bay Nickel (Eramet) in Indonesia, Berong Mining in the Philippines and BHP 
Billiton nickel projects to treat their high grade saprolitic material.   

An innovation in the proposed processing route will be the inclusion of saprolite neutralisation. This will 
involve pre-neutralisation of the residual free acid in the combined leach discharge streams using high 
magnesium saprolite ore. This process, performed at atmospheric pressure, will consume much of the free 
acid while recovering additional nickel and cobalt values from the saprolite ore. Neutralisation of the 
remaining acid will be achieved using limestone. 

The concept of saprolite neutralisation was first investigated for laterite ores from the Surigao district in 
testwork conducted in 1998. Recovery of 60–65% of the nickel and cobalt contained in the high magnesium 
saprolite mineralisation was achieved. In recent years much higher recoveries have been achieved in 
testwork for the Weda Bay (Indonesia), Sulawesi (Indonesia) and Mindoro (Philippines) nickel projects. 
Bench-scale testwork at SGS using Agata saprolite has demonstrated that recoveries of 83-89% are 
achievable. Higher recoveries may be possible and ongoing testwork on the Agata mineralisation may 
improve upon the PEA assumptions. 

After saprolite neutralisation, the pregnant solution will be recovered by conventional counter-current 
decantation (CCD), followed by limestone neutralisation of excess acid and precipitation of iron, aluminium 
and chromium, prior to metal recovery by mixed hydroxide product or precipitation (MHP). 

Metal recovery will be by a two-stage MHP circuit similar to that operated for several years at the Cawse 
Nickel Project (Western Australia) and more recently at Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation (Western Australia). 

3.4.2.2 Process Preparation 

The treatment plant includes separate circuits to treat limonite and saprolite ores. The limonite preparation 
circuit produces fully de-agglomerated limonite slurry for high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) and the 
saprolite circuit produces three types of ground saprolite slurry for HPAL, atmospheric leaching (AL) and 
saprolite neutralisation (SN). The limonite treatment plant comprises the following principal operations: 

� primary crushing to <200 mm by roll sizer 

� limonite de-agglomeration by wet rotary drum scrubbing and rejection of the coarse oversize fraction 
(>10 mm) by screening 

� single stage, closed circuit ball milling to produce a ground limonite slurry 

� HPAL feed slurry thickening. 

The saprolite treatment plant consists of the following principal operations:

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 11 

 

� primary crushing to <200 mm by roll sizer 

� single stage, closed circuit saprolite semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) milling to produce ground 
saprolite slurry 

� storage tanks for three types of ground saprolite slurry: low magnesium saprolite, medium magnesium 
saprolite and high magnesium saprolite 

� thickening of the medium magnesium saprolite and high magnesium saprolite slurries for delivery to 
atmospheric leaching and saprolite neutralisation. 

3.4.2.3 Leach Plant 

HPAL feed is comprised of limonite and low magnesium saprolite slurries, which are combined in the 
required proportions in the HPAL feed thickener. The HPAL plant includes feed slurry heating, leaching of 
nickel and cobalt from limonite at high temperature (255°C) and pressure (4425 kPag), and autoclave 
discharge slurry pressure letdown. Atmospheric leach feed is comprised of medium magnesium saprolite 
slurry. In the atmospheric leach circuit nickel and cobalt are leached from saprolite at atmospheric conditions 
(95-100°C and ambient pressure). Sulphuric acid is used as the lixiviant for both HPAL and atmospheric 
leaching.  

A recycle leach circuit utilises a small stream of sulphuric acid to re-dissolve nickel and cobalt precipitated in 
the downstream iron/aluminium removal and second stage MHP circuits. Discharge slurries from the HPAL, 
atmospheric leach and recycle leach circuits are combined and forwarded to the saprolite neutralisation 
circuit where the neutralising capacity of the high magnesium saprolite consumes some of the excess free 
acid. Additional nickel and cobalt are leached from high magnesium saprolite during this process. The 
resultant slurry flows to the CCD circuit, to separate and wash soluble nickel and cobalt from the leach 
residue solids. 

The recovered pregnant liquor is forwarded to two stages of iron/aluminium removal. In the first stage of 
iron/aluminium removal the majority of the remaining free acid in solution is neutralised with limestone slurry 
and most of the iron and some of the aluminium are precipitated. In the second stage of iron/aluminium 
removal the remaining iron and aluminium are precipitated. The pregnant liquor is separated from the 
precipitated solids by thickening prior to transfer to the MHP area. The thickener underflow slurry is directed 
to the recycle leach circuit for recovery of co-precipitated nickel and cobalt.  

The barren leach residue solids from the final stage of counter current decantation (CCD) washing along with 
barren solution from the MHP circuit report to final neutralisation circuit where most of the remaining metals 
in solution are precipitated.  

Treated residue is pumped to the residue storage facility (RSF).   

3.4.2.4 Products Section 

Nickel and cobalt are recovered as a mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP).   

The virtually iron/aluminium-free pregnant leach solution (PLS) is forwarded to the first stage MHP reactors 
to precipitate the nickel and cobalt from the solution by the addition of magnesia slurry. The resulting 
precipitate contained in the slurry is thickened and forwarded to wash filtration where the precipitate is 
filtered for further dewatering and washed with demineralised water to displace the chlorides and other sea 
salts entrained with the precipitates. The filter cake is then repulped with demineralised water and filtered in 
a pressure filter to achieve the required product moisture specification. The MHP product is packaged in 2 t 
bulk bags and containerised for shipment and sale. 

The un-precipitated nickel and cobalt values remaining in solution after first stage MHP are recovered by 
lime precipitation in the second stage MHP reactors. The resulting precipitate is thickened and recycled back 
to the recycle leach area to re-dissolve the nickel and cobalt.

3.4.2.5 Major Process Packages 

Major process packages include a sulphur-burning acid plant, a limestone slurrying plant, a lime kiln and lime 
slaking plant, a magnesia slurrying plant and a RSF. 

The sulphuric acid plant provides sulphuric acid for the leaching circuit and other process consumers, and 
high pressure steam for power generation. The acid plant products are up to 2700 t/d of 98.5% sulphuric 
acid and up to 152 t/h of steam. 

The limestone plant provides limestone in slurry form for neutralisation of acidic process liquors and crushed 
limestone for burnt lime production. The limestone plant consists of crushing and slurrying facilities.  

The lime plant provides lime in the form of milk-of-lime slurry for neutralisation of acidic process liquors and 
precipitation of nickel and cobalt in the second stage MHP circuit. The plant consists of a fuel-oil fired 
limestone calciner and lime slaking facilities.  

The magnesia slurrying plant provides magnesia slurry for the precipitation nickel and cobalt as mixed 
hydroxides in the first stage MHP circuit.  

The RSF area includes transport and storage facilities for process residue slurry. The impoundment area 
consists of a walled coastal valley located a short distance from the mine area. The neutralised tailings are 
pumped via a slurry pipeline to the RSF.  

3.5 Infrastructure 

The provision of infrastructure is a significant part of the overall development of the project due to the 
greenfield nature of the proposed site. Existing infrastructure facilities are virtually non-existent in the 
immediate area of the proposed site except for an existing gravel public road and the exploration camp 
facilities. 

The facilities will be located predominantly in a coastal valley west of the mine site, as the topography is 
relatively flat compared to the steeper inland terrain.  

The infrastructure facilities to be provided for the project include: 

� water supply and treatment 

� power station and power reticulation 

� port 

� bulk materials handling 

� fuel tank farm 

� solid and liquid waste management 

� plant control system 

� plant site and service buildings and ancillary facilities 

� accommodation village and facilities 

� communications 

� mobile equipment 

� roads, and 

� security services.

3.5.1 Residue Management 

Golder has developed quantities for the following residue management approach: 

� Management of residue generated in the first seven years in a valley RSF. 

� Management of the remaining eight years of residue in the pit void, with the perimeter embankment 
raised as required to provide sufficient capacity. 

The cost for residue management has been based on unit rates adopted by Golder after a review of 
available information relating to similar projects in the Philippines. The sources of information include: 

� Unit rates from our internal database, based on Contractor rates provided by our Manila office 

� Unit rates estimated by Golder for a similar project  

� Unit rates estimated by Ausenco Vector, provided by Mindoro 

� Experience-based judgement from Golder personnel who have recently worked on Philippines-based 
projects. 

The unit rates adopted for this cost estimate are presented in the table below. 

Table 3-9: Unit Rates Estimated 

Item Unit Rate 

Clear and Grub USD0.50 per m
2
 

Liner System, including delivery and placement USD10.00 per m
2
 

Embankment Bulk Fill* USD10.00 per m
3
 

Liner Bedding Material USD12.50 per m
3
 

Excavation of Diversion Channel USD4.30 per m
3
 

* Including winning, hauling, placement, moisture conditioning and compaction 

Adopting these unit rates, the estimated costs are as follows: 

� Capital Cost of Valley RSF = ~USD120 M 

� This cost will be spent in Year 0 and the RSF provides residue management capacity for seven 
years or approximately 12.6 Mm

3
. 

� Deferred Capital Cost of In-pit RSF = ~USD133 M 

� This cost will be spent in Years 6 and 7, ready for deposition in Year 8, and the RSF provides 
residue management capacity for an additional eight years or approximately ~14.4 Mm

3
. 

Please note that the accuracy of the cost estimates presented in this PEA is about ±35%. A contingency 
amount of 40% would therefore typically be included at this level of study. The contingency has not been 
included in our cost estimate, as Mindoro has applied a contingency to the total capital cost estimate in the 
PEA. 

Our review of the Scoping Study indicates that the assumptions and approach appear to be reasonable, with 
the exception of selection of an above-ground RSF. Based on the survey provided, a suitable site for an 
above-ground RSF was not considered feasible within the extent of the survey provided. However, a valley 
RSF location was identified and costed to provide a comparison price. 

Based on our desktop study, it is recommended that a cost of USD120 M be adopted as the capital cost for 
residue management for the PEA. A further USD133 M should be allowed as deferred capital, to be spent 
during Years 6 and 7.

3.5.2 Port Facilities 

The port will incorporate the following wharf facilities: 

� the main berth accommodating: 20 000 DWT liquid tankers for acid, heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel, 
50 000 DWT bulk cargo ships for sulphur and product despatch, and 5000–10 000 DWT barges 

� a pipeline corridor and pumps for unloading liquid materials (diesel fuel, heavy fuel oil and acid) from 
the ships to storage tanks 

� a 100 tonne crawler crane for loading and unloading containers 

� admin office and warehouse. 

A heavy lift ramp is provided for unloading autoclaves and other heavy modules during construction. This 
ramp will be designed such that it can be utilised as a permanent facility for accessing heavy loads for 
construction for future expansion and/or for operations. 

3.6 Utilities 

3.6.1 Water 

The scoping studies (Boyd Willis Hydromet Consulting, 2010 & Mindoro Resources, 2011), indicated that the 
main water requirements during the construction phase of the project and during mine operations and mine 
processing would be: 

� Raw water for dust suppression and wash down 

� Seawater for mineralisation slurrying 

� Filtered raw water for general process plant use 

� Raw and potable water for domestic use, and 

� Demineralised water for steam generation and processing.  

The water requirements were estimated based on the process water balance and typical water demands. 
The estimated total daily water consumption for the Agata Nickel Project is summarised in Table 3-10. 

Table 3-10: Estimated Daily Water Requirements 

Description Water usage (kL/d) 

Total Raw Water 9 330 

Filtered Water 8 630 

Demineralised Water 1 110 

Potable Water 100 

Seawater 9 780 

 

The potential water sources include:  

� Direct water abstraction and treatment of water from the Kalinawan River (referred to as the Tubay 
River in the scoping studies) 

� Groundwater wells established in the alluvial aquifer of the Kalinawan Valley 

� Groundwater wells established in fractured rock aquifers, and  

� Direct abstraction and treatment of seawater with the intake situated in the port area. 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 15 

 

For the purposes of this study, we assumed that raw water will be sourced by means of direct abstraction of 
water from the Kalinawan River. The conceptual design for the water supply and major distribution system 
for this project has been divided into the following elements: 

Raw Water 

� Pump station intake works at the Kalinawan River 

� Pumping station at the Kalinawan River 

� Pipeline from pumping station to raw water storage pond 

� Raw water storage pond. 

Sea Water 

� Pump station intake works at the proposed port site 

� Pumping station at the proposed port site 

� Pipeline from pumping station to seawater storage pond 

� Seawater storage pond. 

The approximate capital cost associated with the water supply is about USD12.5 M (±50%) and includes 
supply and installation of the pump station intake works, pump station, pipeline and water storage facilities. It 
excludes power supply and reticulation as this has already been accounted for. 

Water Treatment 

The proposed raw water treatment system will produce three standards of quality: 

� Filtered raw water for process and general plant use 

� Potable water for human consumption and ablutions, and 

� Demineralised water for boiler feed water and other process water requirements. 

A small water treatment plant will be required to supply potable water to meet the "desirable" drinking water 
standards recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and national Department of Environment 
and Natural Resources (DENR) standards. The potable treatment system may include: 

� Filtering to remove suspended solids 

� Ultraviolet (UV) treatment to purify and disinfect the water from microbiological contaminants, and 

� Chemical treatment such as chlorination to meet health requirements. 

Water treatment may also be required for the disposal of water to comply with the World Bank/International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) guidelines for marine discharge. A preliminary analysis of the water quality in the 
discharge liquor showed that the discharge water might be acceptable for discharge in the ocean (Boyd 
Willis Hydromet Consulting, 2010). For the purpose of the study, we assumed treatment would comprise only 
clarifiers before discharge into the ocean. The estimated costs associated with water treatment are: 

� USD20 M for the filtered water, reverse osmosis (RO) plant required for demineralised water and 
potable water treatment plant (±100%), and 

� USD9 M for the clarifier treatment of water prior to disposal into the ocean (±50%).

3.6.2 Power 

The power station uses steam generators to provide electrical power for the operation of the process plant, 
services and utilities, as well as for the accommodation village and all other related infrastructure.  

High pressure steam is produced from two sources. The major source of high pressure steam is from waste 
heat boilers in the sulphuric acid plant. The secondary source of high pressure steam is from auxiliary boilers 
that will produce supplementary steam into the same header for the high pressure steam distribution system. 

The power station is designed to satisfy two main operating scenarios: 

� generation of 30.9 MW of power, including 16.8 MW of power for normal plant operations, with 124 t/h 
of HP steam imported from the sulphuric acid plant  

� provision of 7.8 MW of power and 16.3 t/h of process steam, to maintain leach plant operation, critical 
equipment in other areas, and the accommodation village during acid plant outages. 

The plant configuration comprises two 16 MW condensing steam turbine generators and two 25 t/h package 
boilers. The two boilers provide significant flexibility to meet varied steam demands. The selection of 
condensing turbines allows low pressure steam to be extracted for process use. 

In addition, for emergency conditions and the black start of the power station, there are two diesel powered 
generators located within the power station complex. These ex-construction generators will be of sufficient 
capacity for their intended long-term function.  

3.7 Hydrogeology and Water Management 

3.7.1 Hydrogeology 

The Agata Project is located in a mountainous region with several creeks draining towards the Mindanao 
Sea on the western side and towards the Kalinawan Valley on the eastern side.   

The Kalinawan River is situated about 1 km east of the proposed mine area and flows in a southerly 
direction. Tumanda et al. (2004) report that the average discharge of the Kalinawan River is about 
2 M m

3
/day (2000 ML/d) and more than adequate to meet project water requirements. The water quality of 

this river is very good (Coffey, 2008) with Total Suspended Solids (TSS) concentrations of about 2 mg/L and 
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations of about 70 mg/L. Nutrient levels are low ranging between 
0.2 to 1.2 mg/L nitrate. 

Lake Mainit is a large freshwater lake situated approximately 4 km north of the proposed mine area. The 
water quality of this lake is very good (Coffey, 2008) with TDS concentrations of about 80 mg/L and low 
nutrient concentrations.      

The groundwater potential in the mining region and port is probably poor. The geology is complex and the 
mine area is bound between two major strands of the Philippine Fault with one or more splays passing 
through the region. There are at least six different lithologies, each likely to have different aquifer 
characteristics. In the mining region, the laterites are developed over ultramafic rocks which lie along the 
Western Range. Groundwater is probably associated with fractured rock aquifers. These aquifers may have 
the potential to meet potable water supply but would probably not be sufficient for process water 
requirements. 

3.7.2 Water Management 

Water associated with any aspect of the mining operation will be managed so that it would not have any 
detrimental impact on the environment and on mining operations. The water management plan would 
comprise: 

� Sediment control structures required to capture any sediment-laden runoff from mine affected areas. 
This will avoid the release of suspended solids into the environment. The proposed sediment control 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 17 

 

structures would comprise earth embankment facilities to capture and store sediment-laden runoff and 
the release of clear water to the environment. 

� Drains to divert non-impacted runoff from entering the mine workings; and  

� Installation of buffer storage, pumping facilities and pipelines to ensure the site can cope with large 
rainfall events and subsequent flooding of the mine pits.  

The mine water management plan will also comprise drains to avoid downstream contamination of rivers, 
creeks and streams, provide facilities for the storage and disposal of low quality water and manage surface 
runoff from the process plant and other mine facilities.      

For the purposes of this study, we assumed that water management would include the following works: 

� Sediment control structures 

� Diversion channels and drains 

� Flood protection earthworks 

� Stormwater drainage systems, and 

� In-pit pumps and pipeline.  

For the purposes of this PEA, it was assumed that the flood protection earthworks would form part of the 
mining operations and the stormwater drainage system would form part of the process plant infrastructure 
requirements. The estimated costs for the sediment control structures and diversion channels and drains is 
USD20 to 40 M. 

3.8 Environment and Social 

3.8.1 Environment 

To date Mindoro has met environmental assessment requirements appropriately. Mindoro has also received 
two key environmental permits to operate. 

Mindoro now needs to focus on gaining the remaining environmental permits and ensuring all environmental 
permits apply to the new mine plan. 

Mindoro also should consider updating environmental information and establishing structured environmental 
management systems and documentation, as they are important components of meeting permitting 
requirements. 

Mindoro has undertaken baseline studies and impact assessments covering all relevant environmental 
aspects, however these studies were undertaken prior to development of the new 2010 mine plan. Golder 
reviewed summary information in the environmental impact statement (EIS) (Technotrix Consultancy 
Services Inc and Mediatrix Business Consultancy 2007) and concludes that studies were appropriate and 
reasonable. 

3.8.2 Community Engagement 

Mindoro has demonstrated a comprehensive approach to community consultation and socio-economic 
impact studies to date as they have related to exploration activities. The existence of current relationships 
will only assist with the effectiveness of future programming as the project progresses towards feasibility 
studies and potential operations. The aim of the program appears well aligned to international standards for 
good practice engagement but no comment can be made on effectiveness until the program is implemented.

3.8.3 Occupational Health and Safety 

Mindoro has recognised the importance of environment health and safety (EHS) at a corporate level and 
now needs to develop an EHS system on site as a matter of priority during all phases of project 
development. 

Mindoro is committed to EHS and oversees corporate actions through its corporate board EHS committee. 

In developing the Agata Nickel Project, Mindoro has identified the need to adhere to both local and 
international legislation and guidelines such as:  

� World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Standards for Mining including IFC Performance 
Standards 

� Labour Code of the Philippines including occupational safety and health standards for all mining 
activities 

� Sanitation Code of the Philippines. 

In addressing EHS requirements, Mindoro has committed to preparing a Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Policy (HSEC) document jointly with the IFC. 

 

3.9 Conclusions and Recommendations 

3.9.1 Geological Setting 

3.9.1.1 Conclusions 

Mindoro has a good understanding of geology and geomorphology controls on nickel mineralisation in the 
Agata region. The extent of the laterite, hence nickel mineralisation, is well defined by surface and outcrop 
mapping by Mindoro.   

The following items pose potential technical risks to the project: 

Transition material – transition material may occur at the limonite and saprolite contact. In this style of 
deposit, it may occur over very short distances and thicknesses. Transition material will generally have 
poorer metallurgical properties than either pure limonite or saprolite. 

Variable and irregular contacts – laterite deposits such as at AGATA DEPOSIT can be variable over short 
distances. Evidence from costean mapping indicates the potential for a high degree of variation in the 
limonite and saprolite surface, which may have an impact on mining technique, mining rates, mineralisation 
selectivity, and process recovery. 

Presence of boulders – in similar deposits elsewhere in the region, poorly weathered boulders have a 
significant impact on recovery of saprolite ore. 

Definition of saprock – Mindoro define saprock as less intensely weathered saprolite typically with lower 
nickel grade. In reality, the identification of saprock is by 0.4% Ni grade cut-off. This approach is consistent 
with industry norms. The nature of this transition from saprolite to saprock results in a highly irregular 
surface, which may have an impact on mining, mineralisation selectivity, and resource recovery. 

3.9.1.2 Recommendations 

� Metallurgical test work programs should attempt to identify preferred process streams for transition 
material. This might include defining parameters such as magnesium and/or iron cut-off grades for each 
process stream. 

� The nature of contacts between limonite, saprolite, and saprock requires greater understanding. 
Feasibility programs should attempt to characterise the very short-scale (mining scale) irregularity 
through one or more of the following: 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 19 

 

� Close-spaced (5 × 5 m) drilling programs 

� Long (>20 m) and deep (~5 m) trenches in several orientations 

� Geophysical surveys such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) 

� Small-scale (~50 × 50m) trial mine  

� The presence, frequency, and extent of boulders in the saprolite horizon also require better definitions.  

� Another component of the feasibility study might include conditional simulation studies to assess 
potential mineralisation loss and dilution due to boulders and irregular contacts. 

3.10 Drilling 

3.10.1 Conclusions 

Drilling techniques are industry standard and Golder considers them appropriate for nickel laterite deposits. 

Core recovery is good and procedures for recording depth and hole location are industry standard. 

 

3.11 Sampling Method and Approach 

3.11.1 Conclusions 

Drilling, drill sampling and logging procedures are well documented and industry standard. Golder considers 
them to be appropriate for nickel laterite deposits. 

Mindoro also has QAQC systems in place that indicate good quality sampling and assaying. Regular 
independent verification and audits confirm good compliance with procedures and continuous improvement 
to methods and protocols. 

It is Golder's opinion that there are insufficient density measurements to qualify any part of the resource as 
Measured. Based on our experience, the dry bulk density values for limonite may be too high given the high 
moisture content and may impact on tonnages reported for Mineral Resources.  

Similarly, the preferential selection of competent core in saprolite may cause an over statement of saprolite 
density. However, it does not appear that Mindoro allows any density variation for boulders, which will be 
higher density than weathered saprolite.  

3.11.2 Recommendations 

� Mindoro should maintain the high standard sampling and QAQC protocols and systems currently in 
place for all future drilling and assaying programs. 

� Golder recommends increasing the coverage of bulk density sampling. Sample sizes should be as large 
as practically possible. If Mindoro dig any pits similar to previous density sampling programs, consider 
measuring volume and weight of the total material from the pit. Mindoro may wish to investigate 
alternative density measurement methods such as downhole geophysical methods. 

3.12 Sample Preparation and Security 

3.12.1 Conclusions 
Drilling, drill sampling and logging procedures are well documented and industry standard. Golder considers 
them as appropriate for nickel laterite deposits. 

Mindoro also has QAQC systems in place that indicate good quality sampling and assaying. Regular 
independent verification and audits confirm good compliance with procedures and continuous improvement 
to methods and protocols.

3.12.2 Recommendations 

� Mindoro should maintain the high standard sampling and QAQC protocols and systems currently in 
place for all future drilling and assaying programs. 

� Mindoro should consider developing a suite of matrix-matched standard reference samples from 
AGATA DEPOSIT sample reject material to monitor the quality of future drilling and assaying programs. 

3.13 Data Verification 

3.13.1 Conclusions 

Golder has not undertaken any independent data verification.   

3.14 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

3.14.1 Conclusions 

The approach taken to build the geology is standard industry practice. It balances and validates subjective 
geological logging of drill samples with geochemistry to determine the position of lithology contacts. 

More than 10% of the modelled saprolite domain is consisted of boulder. This may present mining recovery 
and metallurgical recovery issues. 

The search parameters used for estimation are reasonable. 

The basis for the resource classification used by QG with classes defined by drill spacing is considered by 
Golder to be reasonable. Further drilling density assessment will be beneficial to the project progression. 

No Mineral Reserves are estimated in this PEA.  

3.14.2 Recommendations 

Golder recommends further investigation about the nature of the limonite/saprolite contact.   

Priority 1 

� Occurrences of boulder and their associated grades in the saprolite modelled area needs to be further 
investigated and characterised.  

� Golder believes that presence of boulder within the saprolite layer will present mining recovery and 
metallurgical recovery issues. Boulder has presently been mixed with saprolite in the current model and 
there is no indication of amount or grade of such material. It is recommended that conditional simulation 
studies be carried out. The simulation studies should include the simulation of the likelihood of 
intersecting boulder runs of various lengths within the saprolite. This will help characterise the risk of 
recovering saprolite for both mining and metallurgical purposes.  

Priority 2 

� Investigate the possibility of separating LF, LA and LB horizons for domaining purposes.  

� Golder notes a lack of use of high grade cutting or high grade restraining. It is recommended that an 
assessment of high grade outliers be carried out prior to interpolation for the PFS. 

� Investigate possibility of modelling variograms using unfolding techniques.  

� Use variogram maps and directional variography to identify and model orientations of continuity.  

� The 3D integrity of the variogram models need to be assessed to determine whether the models 
provide a satisfactory fit in other directions.  

� Perform assessment of the smoothing effect associated with the current block model.

� Perform drilling grid analysis to better guide the PFS and DFS studies. 

� Assessment of the uncertainty inherent in the geological model needs to be investigated.  

Priority 3 

� Investigate possibility of using 25 × 25 × 1m block size to better align with current drill spacing.  

3.15 Metallurgy 

3.15.1 Conclusions 

Two metallurgical testwork programs have been conducted on mineralisation samples from the Agata 
deposit. The most recent program of work conducted at SGS Lakefield in Perth has shown that: 

� Limonite mineralisation is amenable to processing by HPAL and has fast leaching kinetics with 
approximately 97-99% of the nickel extracted within 20 minutes of leaching time. 

� Saprolite mineralisation is amenable to AL with favourable extractions of over 95% Ni in four hours. 

� Other metallurgical characteristics are considered to be typical of tropical nickel-cobalt laterite 
mineralisation deposits. 

� Further detailed programs of metallurgical testwork including locked cycle and continuous testing, as 
well as variability testing, should be undertaken in the next phase of testwork. 

3.15.2 Recommendations 

Metallurgical testwork undertaken to date has been of a scoping nature. More detailed programs of work are 
required as part of the Feasibility Studies planned for the project. The work should include: 

� Additional bench scale testwork on representative composite samples based on the mine schedule. 

� Comprehensive leach variability testwork using samples from a range spatial pit locations, 
mineralisation types and grades throughout the deposit. This should include both HPAL and AL testing 
for the relevant mineralisation types, as well as slurry characterisation. 

� Further evaluation for upgrading of limonite by large scale scrubbing tests and continuous scrubbing 
piloting. 

� Continuous testwork and piloting of the total proposed circuit with recycling of intermediate streams. It is 
important that blending of composite samples for piloting reflects the amount of each mineralisation 
type in the deposit, including the three classifications of saprolite. 

3.16 Residue Tailings Management 

3.16.1 Recommendations 

� Our review of the Scoping Study indicates that the assumptions and approach appear to be reasonable, 
with the exception of selection of an above-ground RSF. Based on the survey provided, a suitable site 
for an above-ground RSF was not considered feasible within the extent of the survey provided. 
However, a valley RSF location was identified and costed to provide a comparison price. 

� Based on our desktop study, it is recommended that an operating cost of USD10.49 per dry tonne of 
tailings, inclusive of a 25% contingency, be adopted for the PEA. Assuming a 15 year mine life at 
1.6 Mtpa, plus a 12.5% contingency, the estimated cost for residue management is estimated to be 
USD284 M. The capital cost of the residue management is USD253 M excluding the 12.5% 
contingency summarised above. Mindoro is applying a global 30% contingency on all capital costs.

3.17 Environment 

3.17.1 Recommendations 

Golder considers Mindoro's environmental actions should focus on obtaining outstanding environmental 
permits. Key factors are likely to be upgrading site environmental information and corporate environmental 
management systems. Golder recommends: 

Permitting and Approvals 

� Reviewing the Philippine permitting and approvals process with respect to the new mine plan. 

� Reviewing the existing environmental information against the applicable World Bank standards and 
identify gaps. 

� Developing an environmental assessment program to address knowledge gaps in meeting both local 
and international environmental requirements. 

� Undertaking the necessary assessments and updating environmental approval documentation 
accordingly. 

Environmental Management 

� Completing an EMP for exploration activities that will provide the basis for a construction and 
subsequently operations EMP. 

� Establishing an EMS that is upgraded as the project ramps up. The EMS need not be complex at this 
stage of project development but should refer to all relevant environmental management aspects. 

3.18 Community Engagement 

3.18.1 Recommendations 

� Golder recommends that more emphasis be placed on communicating the negative impacts of an 
operating mine, and associated environmental and social issues, particularly where those 
environmental impacts will directly affect current livelihoods and lifestyles. Achieving Free, Prior and 
Informed Consultation(s) (FPIC) for operations will require evidence that indigenous people understand 
the potential negative impacts as well as potential benefits of the entire project. This means involving 
stakeholders in information about the detailed design, operations and environmental impacts as a 
matter of course. Golder understands there is a particular challenge in the Philippines to reach 
vulnerable or less powerful groups, where community leaders and more privileged persons can 
sometimes dominate the attention of proponents.  

� Environmental and social impact assessment should also seek and incorporate community feedback as 
part of the assessment and mitigation process. The key element of this process will be providing 
feedback to stakeholders who have been consulted and responding to their concerns in a detailed and 
effective way. 

� Golder emphasises the limitations of this assessment as a preliminary desktop assessment and 
strongly recommends a comprehensive audit be conducted to accurately assess and characterise 
Mindoro's social performance to IFC standard. The scope for such an audit would include field 
assessments, interviews and a thorough analysis of documentation and reporting. 

3.19 Occupational Health and Safety 

3.19.1 Recommendations 

We recommend a staged approach to the establishment of an EHS system that can be reviewed, updated 
and expanded as the project develops. The following core elements should be developed and implemented 
to assist in the management of key EHS risks for the project: 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 23 

 

� Health and Safety Policy 

� Fitness for Work Policy, including travel medicine and malaria risk 

� Site Access and Control Procedures, including site induction, security and travel arrangements 

� Hazard and Risk Management Procedure 

� Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure 

� Site Health and Safety Plan 

� Emergency Management Plan. 

These EHS components could be developed as standalone documents and form the basis of an EHS 
system. 

We recommend a project hazard workshop be held to inform and develop the scope of the EHS system and 
to ensure that the key risks are captured and systems are developed to manage them.

4.0 INTRODUCTION 

Mindoro proposes to develop the Agata Nickel Project. The nickel laterite mineralisation will be mined by 
conventional strip mining and hauled to the plant at the coast. The process design is a combination of high 
pressure acid leach (HPAL), agitated tank atmospheric leach (AL) and saprolite neutralisation (SN) 
processing, producing a mixed hydroxide product (MHP). 

This PEA report identifies recommendations for development of the project to undertake a PFS. Mindoro has 
begun activities including metallurgical test work and resource exploration to support the PFS. 

4.1 Previous Studies 

4.1.1 Summary 

The following Technical Reports were provided by Mindoro: 

� Agata Resource Report, (Mark Gifford and QG, September 2010). 

� Agata Nickel Project Scoping Study (Boyd Willis, September 2010)  

� Additional acid leach metallurgy and impact on costs and feed proportions (limonite/saprolite, etc) 
prepared by Boyd Willis 

� DSO Scoping Study (Peter Geddes) internal Mindoro report  

� Mine and processing schedules based on preliminary modelling (Dallas Cox and Boyd Willis) 

� Economic modelling of preferred project plan (Michael Conan-Davies). 

All references to dollars in this report are in United States Dollars (USD or US$). 

4.1.2 Resource Estimation 

The Agata Nickel Project has estimated combined Measured and Indicated Resource of 32.6 Mt at 1.04% Ni, 
and an Inferred Resource of 1.7 Mt at 1.04% Ni for a combined 357 500 t of nickel, as reported in Mindoro's 
NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate of 8 September 2010, using a cut-off grade of 0.5% Ni for 
limonite and 0.8% Ni for saprolite. The summary of the NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource is presented 
in Table 19-1.  

� Total metal contents in the reported resources represent metal in the ground and have not been 
adjusted for metallurgical recoveries and other factors which will be considered in a later study. 

� Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

� The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues. 

4.1.2.1 Mine Plan 

A preliminary mining and plant feed schedule was developed for the Agata Nickel Project for the first 15 
years of operations based on the September 2010 Mineral Resource (Cox, 2011). The mine plan estimates a 
mining inventory and schedule for feed to hydro-metallurgical process as contemplated in this PEA.  

4.1.2.2 Early Production 

Direct Shipping Operation 

A conceptual level study into a direct shipping operation (DSO) of higher grade zones within the Agata 
resource was also considered as part of the PEA. However, due to the relatively low margins and current 
market uncertainty associated with DSO. Mindoro is not planning to pursue a stand-alone DSO at this stage. 
Golder will not consider this concept further in this report and it has not been included in the economic 
evaluation section of this PEA Report.

Thermal Upgrading Concept Study 

Mindoro is examining the potential for thermal upgrading to enhance the value of the shipped product.  

An October 2010 Concept Study by Hatch Associates investigated thermal upgrading options to produce a 
value-added DSO product. Unprocessed laterite contains 30-45% moisture. Thermal upgrading is the 
process of removing moisture from the material, improving blending and handling properties and, most 
importantly, dramatically reducing the shipping cost, which in combination allows achievement of a premium 
price over DSO. Further upgrade of the nickel content can be achieved through optional process 
enhancements. Work is ongoing on this concept. 

Golder has not considered this further and it is not included in the economic section of this PEA report. 

4.1.3 Acid Leaching Options 

An acid leaching study undertaken for Mindoro by Ausenco Vector (Vector, 2010) and Gifford (2010) for 
Mindoro evaluated three development options: 

� Base Case – a major integrated high pressure acid leach (HPAL), atmospheric leaching (AL) and 
saprolite neutralisation (SN) process. This option employs an autoclave of 4.7 metres internal diameter 
(m ID). The nickel will be recovered by direct solvent extraction (DSX) followed by Electrowinning (EW) 
to produce a Ni-cathode product. The base case is designed to produce 27 400 tpa nickel as 
Ni-cathode. 

� Option 1 – a scale-up of the base case which employs the maximum HPAL autoclave size to date 
(5.4 m ID) as per the Ambatovy Nickel autoclaves in Madagascar. The nickel production for this option 
is increased to 42 000 tpa nickel as Ni-cathode. 

� Option 2 – AL of saprolitic materials only. The nickel will be recovered by hydroxide precipitation 
producing an intermediate mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) product. The design capacity for this 
option is 14 300 tpa nickel contained in MHP. 

The acid leaching study (Vector, 2010) provided this PEA processing options at ±30-35% accuracy and 
identified the accompanying issues such as environmental and technological risks. The process plant costs 
for the three options (with the exception of the refinery area for the Base Case and Option 1) were developed 
from detailed estimates for similar nickel projects and locations. The applicable data were adjusted for flow or 
equipment capacity and currency movements. The refinery area of the Base Case and Option 1 were costed 
separately by Canopean Pty Ltd. 

This PEA for the Agata Project was prepared for Mindoro by Golder in May 2011. The study is based on the 
scoping study (Mindoro, 2010) and additional work undertaken by Mindoro in resource estimation, mining, 
metallurgy and process design based on a modified base case processing plan producing 18,000 tpa nickel 
in mixed hydroxide product (MHP). Golder reviewed previous studies and completed scoping level 
assessment of the requirements for residue management, water, environment, health and safety and 
Personal Inspection by Qualified Persons 

Peter Onley, Golder Principal, visited the principal prospects in Agusan del Norte including the Agata Project 
from 23 May to 28 May 2010 specifically for the purpose of preparing an Independent Geologist's Report 
dated October 2010 Report Number 107641227-001-R-Rev2. 

Tony Showell, Principal Metallurgist Battery Limits has not visited the Agata Site. Mr Showell has reviewed 
the metallurgy and process design prepared by Boyd Willis, Process Consultant Hydrometallurgy at Boyd 
Willis Hydromet Consulting for Mindoro. Mr Willis' most recent visit to the Agata nickel laterite exploration 
sites located in Northern Mindanao, Philippines was in May 2011, for the purpose of identifying potential 
plant, port, infrastructure and tailings deposition sites for the recently commenced PFS.

6.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

6.1 Location 

The Agata Projects are located within the northern part of Agusan del Norte province in northeastern 
Mindanao, Republic of the Philippines. It lies within the Western Range approximately 10 kilometres south of 
Lake Mainit (Figure 6-1). The Agata Project falls within the political jurisdiction of the municipalities of Tubay, 
Santiago and Jabonga. 

The Agata Project is centred at 125°32' E, 9°17' N.  

 

Figure 6-1: Site location of the Agata Nickel Project 

6.2 Land Tenure 

The Agata Project is secured by MPSA 134-99-XIII and Exploration Permit EP 00021-XIII registered to 
Minimax and Estrella Bautista respectively. Application has also been made for the Agata Extension EPA-
107-XIII to the south and east of the Agata MPSA. 

MPSA 134-99-XIII was approved on 26 May 1999 and has been reduced from 99 to 66 blocks covering an 
area of 4995 ha. The fourth two-year exploration period on the tenement was granted on 19 June 2009. On 
20 May 2008, an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) was issued by the DENR to Mindoro for nickel 
laterite mineral production covering 600 ha within the Agata MPSA Contract area, including both the 
Northern area of the Agata deposit and Agata South tenements. In February 2005, the Philippine Supreme 
Court granted 100% foreign ownership of the mineral tenement under the Financial and Technical 
Assistance Agreement (FTAA). There are no known environmental liabilities other than those imposed by the 
Philippine Mining Act of 1995.

The Agata-Bautista Exploration Permit EP 00021-XIII covers an area of 84.39 ha. The EP was approved on 
2 October 2006 and application was made for the first renewal on 29 September 2008. This was granted on 
23 June 2010 and will expire on 22 June 2012. 

Mindoro's interests in the tenements are held by way of agreements with the original tenement holders.  
Mindoro entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOA) with Minimax on 19 January 1997 and 
Minimax assigned all its rights in the MOA to Mindoro on 27 June 1997. Under the terms of the MOA 
Mindoro has earned a 75% interests in the Agata, Tapian Main, and Tapian San Francisco and the 
Extension Projects (tenements acquired after the finalisation of the MOA) in the Surigao Mineral District. 
Mindoro has a further option to acquire an additional 25% direct and indirect participating interest. 

There are no dwellings within the Agata Project deposit area. Most local villages are populated by non-
indigenous peoples but there are some indigenous peoples that live in the surrounding areas both within and 
close by the MPSA (Sitio Coro, EMorgado, La Paz, Santiago, and Tagmamarkay).

7.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

7.1 Accessibility 

The Agata Project is located approximately 10 km south of Lake Mainit and 47 km north northwest of Butuan 
City in Agusan del Norte province, on the island of Mindanao. 

The site is accessible from either Surigao City or Butuan City via the Pan Philippine Highway which runs 
parallel to the length of the Agata MPSA, just outside the eastern boundary. A minor road crosses the 
northern portion of the MPSA area, near the Kalinawan River. Access is gained either by leaving the 
highway at Bangonay and then along 10 km of partly paved roads to E. Morgado or alternatively by leaving 
the highway at Santiago and then by 1.5 km of municipal road to La Paz. The latter route requires crossing 
the Kalinawan River by pump boat to a landing immediately below the project field exploration office. The 
northern part of the tenement is accessible on foot from E Morgado (approximately 1.5 km). Both Surigao 
City and Butuan City are major regional centres served by daily jet services from Manila and provide a broad 
range of services and facilities.  

7.2 Topography, Climate and Vegetation 

The Agata Project is located on the Western Range which runs north northwest parallel to the coast of the 
Mindanao Sea to the west. The Kalinawan River to the east drains south from Lake Mainit. The western part 
of the area is rugged with a maximum elevation of 528 m above sea level. The western area has steep 
slopes and deeply-incised valleys while the floodplain of Kalinawan River to the east is generally flat with an 
elevation of less than 30 m. 

Within the project area, the nickel laterite is developed on a broad ridge bounded to the east and west by 
steep to very steep slopes incised by gullies and ravines. Elevations on the plateau range from 200 to 320 m 
where nickeliferous laterite is widespread. 

Climate in the area is wet tropical with no dry season and experiences months with very pronounced rainfall.  
Climatological Records from 1981 to 2000 show that peak rainfall months are from October to February. The 
highest mean monthly rainfall is 308 mm during January and the lowest mean monthly rainfall is 104.8 mm 
during May while mean annual rainfall is 2027 mm. 

The plateau on which the laterite is developed was formerly rainforest. Since being logged it is now bracken 
dominated open grassland with sparse seedlings and saplings of planted species. A few secondary growth 
trees line the streams along the lower slopes. The floodplain of Kalinawan River is planted with tropical 
agricultural crops such as rice, corn and bananas.

8.0 HISTORY 

The earliest recognised geological work done within the area is mostly from government-related projects 
including: 

� The Regional Geological Reconnaissance of Northern Agusan reported the presence of gold claims in 
the region (Teves et al. 1951).  

� Geologists from the former Bureau of Mines and Geosciences Regional Office in Surigao documented 
the results of regional mapping in the Jagupit Quadrangle.  

� The United Nations Development Program (UNDP, 1982) conducted regional geological mapping at 
1:50 000 scale and collected stream sediment samples over Northern Agusan. The UNDP report of 
1984 described the geological evolution of this region and included a detailed stratigraphic column for 
the Agusan del Norte region.  

La Playa Mining Corporation, financed by a German company in the late 1970s, explored within the Agata 
Project area for chromiferrous laterite developed over weathered ultramafic rocks. There were five (5) test 
pits dug in the area. 

In 1987, Minimax conducted reconnaissance and detailed mapping and sampling. Geological mapping at 
1:1000 scale was undertaken in the high-grading localities, and an aerial photographic survey was 
conducted and interpreted. Mindoro established a mining agreement with Minimax in January 1997, and 
commenced exploration in the same year.

9.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

9.1 Geology 

The dominant structural feature in the regional is the Philippine Rift Fault, a major regional structure that 
extends for 1200 km in a north northwesterly direction over the length of the Philippines from southern 
Mindanao to northern Luzon. The fault is located approximately 200 km west of the Philippine Subduction 
System which dips west under the Philippines landmass and provides the main source of Tertiary volcanism 
and copper and gold mineralisation. It is also the key feature in the development of physiography. 

There is a close spatial and genetic association between epithermal precious metals and porphyry deposits.  
Typically, mineralisation is associated with Pliocene to Pleistocene igneous intrusions developed along splay 
structures to the main fault zone. Primary mineral deposits in the region are dominated by structurally 
controlled epithermal gold and porphyry copper-gold deposits. Tropical weathering of ultramafic rocks in the 
basement sequence has resulted in the development of lateritic nickel deposits. While Mindoro continues to 
explore for copper and gold that activity will not be discussed further in this report.  

The basement sequence comprises Cretaceous greenschist metamorphic rocks overthrust by Cretaceous 
Pangulanganan Basalts which themselves are overthrust by Humandum Serpentinite, probably during the 
Cretaceous. Laterite developed on the Humandum Serpentinite forms the major source of the nickel laterite 
sequence. The Humandum Serpentinite is overlain by Upper Eocene Mabanog Formation limestone and 
clastic sediments and Oligocene and Miocene volcanic rocks including conglomeratic andesite, pillow basalt 
and limestones. Intrusive events associated with the volcanism during this period resulted in the 
emplacement of plutons and stocks that are associated with porphyry copper-gold and precious metal 
epithermal mineralisation in the region. 

Geological mapping in the project area showed favourable development of laterite on the plateau where 
drilling by Mindoro has focused. Where the topography is steeper, the laterite tends to be thinner. Mindoro 
recognises two geomorphic features influencing laterite formation with consequent nickel enrichment. The 
eastern part of the mineralisation is developed on an area of moderate relief and laterite is thinner and 
contains boulders suggesting transport. The western laterite occurs in an area of low relief resulting in a 
thick, well developed profile with higher grade mineralisation.

10.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The Agata Nickel Project is based on a single nickel laterite resource type that is typical of laterites 
developed on utramafic rocks in a tropical weathering environment. The nearest analogues to Agata are 
located on the east coast of Surigao del Norte at Taganito, Hinatuan and Nonoc. Other significant Philippine 
analogues includes the Coral Bay Operation on Palawan Island in the western Philippines operated by 
Sumitomo Mining & Metal Corporation. Other world class nickel laterite deposits that are analogous to Agata 
are located in New Caledonia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

11.0 MINERALISATION 

Nickel laterite deposits have developed over the ultramafic rocks. The mineralisation extends over about 
520 ha within the tenements. The largest of the laterite areas is developed over the central ultramafic body. 
About 80% of the nickel laterite in the Agata Project has been tested by drilling to date. 

Nickel laterites are the products of intense chemical weathering of ultramafic rocks. Silica and other elements 
are leached from the rock resulting in the concentration of iron, nickel, chrome and cobalt from the parent 
rock into the weathering profile. Laterites form preferentially in stable terrains in the presence of wet tropical 
climates. Typical laterite is zoned parallel to the weathering surface. The uppermost horizon is classified as 
ferruginous laterite underlain by the limonitic zone (both are iron rich – hematite, goethite, limonite and clay) 
which is again underlain by saprolite (magnesium rich clays). The interface between the fresh rock and the 
saprolite zone is classified as saprolitic rock or "saprock" and is characterised by the presence of garnierite. 

For the Agata Project drilling program, the horizons are classified according to nickel and iron content as 
follows: 

� Ferruginous laterite – <0.80% Ni, ≥30% Fe% 

� Limonite – ≥0.80% Ni, ≥30% Fe% 

� Saprolite – ≥0.80% Ni, <30% Fe% 

� Saprolitic Rock – <0.80% Ni, <30% Fe%. 

Reconnaissance geological mapping originally outlined an area of laterite covering approximately 600 ha. 
The southern part of the Agata deposit is the subject of Minimax-Mindoro-Delta agreement. Delta carried out 
a resource delineation program in the southern area in 2007-2008. A regional mapping program was then 
carried out in 2008 to determine the potential nickel laterite areas throughout the tenement. Further potential 
for nickel laterite mineralisation was recognised on the adjacent Tapian Main, Tapian SF and Mat-I 
tenements.

12.0 EXPLORATION 

La Playa Mining Corporation mapped the Agata area and dug test pits while exploring for chromiferous 
laterite beginning in 1987. La Playa subsequently withdrew as the mineralisation was not considered 
economic at that time. 

Minimax Corporation took up the tenements between 1996 and 1999 and Mindoro established a mining 
agreement with Minimax in January 1997 and began exploration later that year concentrating on the copper 
and gold potential. 

Discovery of lateritic nickel mineralisation within the northern part of the Agata deposit occurred in the early 
1990s with grades confirmed by the development of test pits in 1997.  

Exploration of the Agata nickel laterite began in 2004 with Taganito Mining Corporation granted the 
non-exclusive right to assess the nickel laterite potential of the project. Results were encouraging with 
surface samples collected from an area of about 300 ha within a more extensive area of nickel laterite 
mineralisation returning assays up to 2.09%, with most of the values exceeding 0.5%. 

Mindoro signed an MOU with Queensland Nickel Phils. Inc. (QNPH), a subsidiary of BHP Billiton Ltd (BHPB) 
to allow QPNH to conduct exploration on the property. Reconnaissance drilling began in 2006 initially at a 
spacing of 200 m by 200 m later infilled to 100 m grid spacing. A total of 660 m were drilled in 35 holes over 
an area of approximately 80 ha, however, QNPH subsequently withdrew from the joint venture. 

Regional mapping indicated additional potential for nickel laterite mineralisation on the adjacent Tapian Main, 
Tapian SF and Mat-I tenements. Reconnaissance auger drilling indicated several areas warranting follow-up 
drilling to establish potential Mineral Resources. This evaluation drilling formed the basis of the exploration 
targets for the Regional Exploration Target of 50 to 70 Mt at a grade of 0.9% to 1.2% Ni.

13.0 DRILLING 

13.1 Agata 

The following information is summarised from Gifford, 2010 and Mindoro, 2010. 

In the northern part of the Agata deposit drilling is concentrated over about eighty (80) percent of the 
interpreted nickel laterite extent (Figure 13-1). 

 

Figure 13-1: Drill hole plan showing 

Mindoro has carried out exploration drilling on a progressively smaller drill pattern using small mobile open 
hole NQ coring rigs (Figure 13-2). Recovery from these drill rigs is high, with losses generally occurring due 
to changes in the hardness of the drilled material causing disruption at the bit face (Figure 13-3). The major 
mineralisation zone is generally a softer material and losses within the mineralisation zones have been 
minimal at all stages of the drilling programs.

14.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
The following information is summarised from Gifford, 2010 and Mindoro, 2010. 

14.1 Drill Sampling 

The majority of data in the resource database is from core drilling. During drilling Mindoro provide close 
supervision of contract drillers and diligently record core recovery, core run, laterite horizons, degree of 
weathering, boulder size, and colour for all sample intervals. 

On completion of logging, a geologist marks the core for sampling typically at one metre downhole intervals 
with sample lengths adjusted for changes in lithology and laterite horizon. Minimum sample length is 0.7 m 
and maximum is two metres. 

Mindoro has used slightly different sampling techniques for the different programs: 

� Mindoro Phase 1 – whole core samples. 

� Mindoro Phase 2 – split core samples where technicians crush the core using a pick, mix the crushed 
product thoroughly, and quarter the sample pile. The technicians then bag two opposite quarters for 
assaying with the remainder retained. 

� Mindoro Phase 3 and 4 – Technicians split the core in half using a spatula or core saw and bag half the 
core for despatch to the assay laboratory. 

In all cases, the technicians label all samples and residual material with hole identification, sample number, 
and sample interval and secure all sample bags firmly. 

Mindoro have modified sampling methods and QAQC procedures following regular audits and reviews by 
independent consultants and industry experts. 

All drilling and sampling is under the close supervision of Mindoro's Exploration Manager. 

14.2 Density Determinations 

Mindoro collected the majority of samples for dry bulk density determination from test pits. Mindoro collected 
30 samples from 15 test pits for the ferruginous laterite horizon; 37 samples from 19 pits for limonite; and 17 
pit samples from 6 pits for saprolite.  

In addition, Mindoro also collected and tested 19 core samples from the saprolite zone.  

On-site bulk density determinations came from large samples ranging in volume from 0.005 m
3 
to 0.08 m

3
 

collected from twenty test pits distributed around the drilling area. For the bulk samples, Mindoro measured 
volume, wet weight, and dry weight.  

For the drill cores, Mindoro selected relatively solid, less compressed portions of 100-200 mm lengths of 
core. Drill holes are spatially distributed and samples coated in paraffin wax to preserve the moisture.  
Mindoro dispatched these samples to McPhar Laboratories who use the water displacement method for 
density determinations.  

Moisture content averages from approximately 20 to 25% in saprolite to 30% in limonite. Mindoro report dry 
bulk density averages of approximately 1.2 and 1.45 t/m

3
 for limonite and saprolite respectively.

15.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

15.1 Analytical Laboratories 

McPhar Geoservices (Phil) Incorporated (McPhar) has been the primary laboratory for the Agata Project 
drilling and assaying programs. McPhar are an ISO 9001-2000 accredited laboratory based in Manila. 

McPhar's sample preparation and assay flow sheet follows standard industry methods. McPhar analyse 
each sample for nickel, cobalt, iron, magnesium, and aluminium by dissolving a 25 g charge with a two acid 
digest followed by an Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) finish. McPhar also analyse silica and some 
samples for phosphorous using a gravimetric process.  

15.2 Sampling and Analytical QAQC 

Quality Assurance (QA) is the system and set of procedures used to ensure that the sampling and assay 
results are of high quality. Quality Control (QC) is the data used to prove the results of sampling, sample 
preparation, and chemical analyses are fit for purpose. 

At Agata, Mindoro has stringent quality control and assurance programs in place, which include: 

� Check samples 

� Repeats of coarse rejects 

� Repeat assays of pulp rejects 

� Insertion of standard (certified) reference samples (standards) with each batch of samples. Mindoro 
sourced 12 types of standards from Geostats Pty Ltd of Australia covering a range of nickel grades from 
0.11% to 2% 

� Pulp repeat assays by an umpire laboratory, Intertek Phils (Intertek). 

Independent reports of QAQC results show check samples and assays all correlate well with original results 
and variations are within acceptable limits (Gifford, 2010). Gifford, 2000 notes for the two standards, which 
most closely match Agata samples, McPhar and Intertek consistently underestimate iron content by 
approximately 3% of the certified value. 

Full details of results are available in Gifford, 2010.

17.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Surigao peninsula in northeastern Mindanao, where the Agata project is located, is a significant mining 
district of the Philippines.  There are four commercially significant nickel laterite resources, including 
Taganito, Cagdianao, Hinatuan and Nonocs.  There are also other known but undeveloped nickel laterite 
resources in the area. Nickel laterite has  been mapped beyond the immediate boundaries of Mindoro 
Tenements.  These occurrences may be of future interest to Mindoro but are not contemplated or provided 
for in the current PEA.  In addition both Mindoro and other companies have interests in epithermal gold and 
porphyry copper-gold projects in the area.

18.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

18.1 Introduction 

The first phase of metallurgical testing of mineralisation from the Agata nickel deposit was performed by 
metallurgical laboratory and consultants Enlin Stainless Steel Corporation (ESSC) in 2008. Golder was 
advised that the ESSC Manila Laboratory is not a certified laboratory. The ESSC bench scale testwork 
program included AL, HPAL, saprolite neutralisation, limestone neutralisation, iron removal and MHP. The 
available reports by ESSC were found to be lacking test details in some areas. 

A more comprehensive bench scale program was completed by SGS Lakefield Oretest (ISO 9001:2008 
Certified) in Perth in 2010/2011. This program included mineralogy, beneficiation (scrubbing), slurry settling, 
AL, HPAL, saprolite neutralisation and counter current decantation (CCD) settling on composites of different 
mineralisation types from the deposit, as well as limestone testing.   

18.2 Testing at Enlin Stainless Steel Corporation 

18.2.1 Ore Samples 

Six mineralisation samples were tested in the ESSC testing program. The head analyses for the six samples 
are summarised in Table 18-1. 

Table 18-1: Mineralisation Sample Head Analyses 

Sample Ni % Fe % Co % Mg % Mn % Cr % 

1 0.97 47.9 0.17 0.83 1.27 1.33

6 1.76 16.3 0.03 13.5 0.28 0.35 

 

Samples 1 to 4 were clearly limonite as evidenced by high iron grades of 46 to 50% Fe, and low magnesium 
grades in the range 0.69 to 0.83% Mg. Sample 5 is transitional material and Sample 6 represents high Mg 
saprolite. 

18.2.2 Sizing Analyses 

Size analysis was performed on a limonite sample. The results are presented in Table 18-2. 

Table 18-2: Limonite Sizing Results 

Mesh Mass % Ni % Fe % Co % Mg % Mn % Cr % Al % Ca %

The results on the limonite sample showed relatively even distribution of nickel across the size range tested, 
and ESSC concluded that there was little potential for beneficiation.

18.2.3 Ore Slurry Thickening 

ESSC conducted a thickening test on an unidentified mineralisation sample and reported that 50% w/w 
solids was achieved in just three minutes. It was also concluded by ESSC that flocculation was not required. 
These results are considered to be uncharacteristic of typical nickel laterite ore, but insufficient test data was 
published by ESSC to permit a review of procedures and calculations.   

18.2.4 Atmospheric Leaching (AL) 

No detailed results from the AL testwork program were presented by ESSC. The covering report by ESSC 
indicated that 90% nickel extraction was obtained from saprolite mineralisation at an acid dosage of 900 kg/t. 

18.2.5 HPAL Testing 

A range of tests were performed by ESSC to investigate the effects of temperature, acid to ratio, and 
residence time, on the performance in HPAL. Representative HPAL test results are summarised Table 18-3.

These results are considered to be fairly typical of a limonite HPAL solution and thus provide some 
confidence in the experimental methods applied. 

18.2.6 Saprolite Neutralisation 

Partial neutralisation of HPAL discharge slurry by the addition of saprolite mineralisation was tested by 
ESSC. Unfortunately some critical details of this testwork were not reported. These include: 

� the initial and terminal acid concentrations are not stated 

� saprolite dosage was reported in grams per 800 ml of HPAL solution, with no indication of how much 
limonite mineralisation was leached to produce the HPAL solution.

Terminal acidity was reported to be in the range pH 1.3-1.5. Higher extractions may have been achievable if 
a higher terminal acidity of approximately 5-10 g/L was targeted. 

18.2.7 CCD Settling 

Settling tests were performed on slurry samples produced during the saprolite neutralisation testwork, 
however only flocculant rates and settling times were reported. No underflow density data was presented in 
the ESSC report. 

18.2.8 Iron Removal 

Iron removal tests were performed by pH adjustment using limestone. The results of testwork at 85°C are 
presented in Table 18-6.

The results were considered to compare well with data from other nickel laterite projects. Reconciliations 
indicated nickel and cobalt co-precipitation of 0.6-0.9% at pH 3 rising to 3.4-4.5% at pH 4.5. 

18.2.9 Nickel-Cobalt Precipitation 

Precipitation of mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxides was tested using both sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 
magnesia (MgO). ESSC concluded that: 

� the optimum pH for precipitation of mixed hydroxides using sodium hydroxide is pH 6.6-6.7 

� the optimum pH for precipitation of mixed hydroxides using magnesia is pH 6.5-6.7 

� two stages of precipitation are required to achieve a satisfactory nickel grade in the product.

18.3 Testing at SGS Lakefield Oretest (SGS) 

A program of metallurgical testwork was undertaken in 2010 to investigate the metallurgical characteristics of 
Agata mineralisation samples. The work was undertaken at the SGS Lakefield (ISO 9001:2008 Certified) 
metallurgical laboratory in Perth, Western Australia. 

18.3.1 Testwork Samples 

The samples were sourced as intervals from the walls of three metallurgical test pits located to target three 
mineralisation types. The intervals used, and test pit identifications, are presented in Table 18-7. The 
samples were blended in a manner to target elemental composite grades similar to that of global resource 
values, especially those elements influencing leaching properties such as iron and magnesium.

Three composites were initially prepared and the composites were identified as limonite, transition and 
saprolite. In the proposed operations it is planned to treat transition mineralisation with limonite 
mineralisation in HPAL processing. A fourth composite was therefore prepared as a blend of limonite and 
transition ore, and was identified in testwork as 'limonite transition' (L/T) blend. The L/T blend sample was 
mixed in the ratio of 95% limonite and 5% saprolite. 

Drill samples from the nearby Payong Payong limestone deposit were evaluated by SGS. Two samples 
identified as Agata LS-01 and Agata LS-02 were received by SGS. The two samples were blended to form a 
limestone composite sample for testwork. 

18.3.2 Mineralogy 

Mineralogical examinations of size fractions from the limonite and saprolite composites were undertaken by 
SGS South Africa. A subsample of each composite was screened into four size fractions (+212 µm down to 
-38 µm) for examination. The main aim of the work was to investigate mineral liberation and Ni-deportment in 
the samples. 

The investigations included qualitative X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis; chemical analysis; electron 
microprobe analysis of the mineral phases present; and QEMSCAN BMA and PMA analyses.   

Some observations from the work on the limonite sample fractions were: 

� The mineralisation is predominantly of made up of quartz, chromite and Fe-hydroxides. 

� The amount of quartz in size fractions decreases with decreasing screen size. Almost all of the quartz is 
rimmed by Fe-hydroxides.  

� The amount of chromite decreases with decreasing screen size. The chromite is mostly well liberated. 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 49 

 

� The amount of Fe-hydroxides in screen fractions increases with decreasing screen size. The 
Fe-hydroxides are well liberated in the -75 µm fractions but relatively poorly in the +75 µm fractions.  
Most of the unliberated Fe-hydroxides in the +75 µm fractions are intergrown with Mn-wad, 
magnetite-hematite and/or contain silicate inclusions. Most of the nickel is hosted by the Fe-hydroxides. 

� The Mn-wad in limonite is poorly liberated and is closely associated with the Fe-hydroxides. The 
Mn-wad contains significant nickel. 

Some observations from the work on the saprolite sample fractions were: 

� The saprolite size fractions consist primarily of altered serpentine and saponite clay (an alteration 
product of serpentine) 

� The Mg:Si ratios of the serpentine and saponite are on average 1.1 and 0.9 respectively as the Mg is 
leached from the serpentine during alteration 

� The Fe-hydroxides present in the fractions are poorly liberated in the serpentine 

� Approximately 50-60% of the serpentine is liberated. The saponite is mostly well liberated. Unliberated 
saponite is mostly associated with Fe-hydroxides as rims. 

� The serpentine is nickel rich 

The mineralogical work suggests that moderate upgrading may be achieved by rejection of quartz in coarse 
fractions. Removal of chromite in coarse fractions by magnetic separation was suggested by SGS.   

SGS also considered that the saprolite sample would be amenable to atmospheric sulphuric acid leaching as 
none of the fractions were observed to contain excessive Fe oxide/hydroxides or a high Fe-content. 

18.3.3 Head Analyses 

Head analyses were conducted on the four samples. The samples were subjected to a four acid digest and 
metal elemental compositions determined by ICP-MS. Analyses for Si and Cr were determined by X-Ray 
Fluorescence (XRF). 

The analytical results are presented in Table 18-8.

L/T Blend 1.33 0.086 2.39 1.3 7.7 2.00 0.10  0.75 

 

The results are considered to be typical of tropical nickel-cobalt laterite deposits. The sample blends were 
prepared with the main objective of achieving similar grades to the scoping study mine schedule in species 
significant to leach chemistry, particularly iron, magnesium and aluminium. The nickel grade in the limonite 
sample was determined to be 1.32% Ni and is approximately 30% higher than the limonite nickel grade in 
the current planned mine schedules. The saprolite sample is similar in nickel and iron grade to that reported 
in the proposed mine schedules, but the test sample is significantly lower in magnesium.   

Further variability work is recommended to examine effect of head grade and elemental variations on 
extraction and metallurgical performance.

18.3.4 Ore Scrubbing and Head Sizing 

A sub-sample of each composite was lightly scrubbed to assist in removing Fe-hydroxides from silica 
particles, and then wet screened to examine potential for mineralisation beneficiation by sizing. Scrubbing 
was achieved by soaking a 10 kg subsample of mineralisation in water overnight and then bottle rolling the 
slurry for one hour prior to wet screening.  

The mass, grade and metal recovery in wet screening for a reject screen size of 0.25 mm is summarised in

showed a poorer response than nickel. Further large scale scrubbing testwork should be undertaken in the 
next phase of testwork. 

Saprolite mineralisation showed no potential for upgrading by beneficiation from scrubbing and sizing. 

18.3.5 Heap Leaching Amenability Testing   

Agglomeration, percolation and bottle roll acid leaching testwork was conducted on a saprolite sample 
crushed to finer than 25 mm to evaluate amenability to heap leaching.   

The agglomeration tests were conducted in a cement mixer with varying additions of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. Agglomerates were then cured for three days in columns and flooded. After a 48 hour soak period, the 
mineralisation height slump and column percolation maximum drain rate were determined. Results are 
presented in Table 18-10.

The results showed that acid additions over 100 kg/t resulted in low drainage rates. 

The response of mineralisation samples to acid heap leach conditions was investigated by acid bottle roll 
leaching of 3 kg sub-samples prepared by agglomeration at 50 kg/t acid. The tests were conducted at 30% 
solids and varying target free-acid concentrations in leach over a period of 50 days. The nickel extraction 
results with leach time for each target acidity are presented graphically in Figure 18-1.

Figure 18-1: Acid Bottle Roll Test Results 

High nickel extractions ranging from 90 to 99% were achieved, but at very high acid addition requirements of 
887 to 985 kg acid/ tonne of ore. Both metal extraction and acid consumption increased as target acidity was 
increased from 25 to 50 g/L.   

18.3.6 Feed Mineralisation Settling Testwork 

Settling testwork was undertaken on the limonite transition and saprolite samples to investigate requirements 
for thickening of leach feed. A flocculant screening program was first undertaken resulting in selection of 
Magnafloc 10 for the settling trials. 

The settling tests were conducted in 2 metre high raked columns. The key test parameters and test results 
are presented in Table 18-11.

18.3.7 High Pressure Acid Leach Testing  

HPAL leaching tests were conducted on the limonite transition composite sample at varying acid additions to 
examine extraction response with retention time and acid addition. All tests were conducted with slurry made 
up to 29% solids with a mix of seawater and fresh tap water blended in a ratio of 1.33 of sea to fresh. The 
target water blend was established by BWHC modelling in METSIM® and reflects mineralisation slurrying 
using seawater adjusted for the impact of mineralisation moisture and process dilution by gland water, 
screen sprays, flocculant make-up water and condensation of live steam during slurry heating. All tests were 
conducted in a mechanically stirred laboratory batch autoclave at a temperature of 255°C. Acid addition 
rates varied between 276 and 351 kg/t. 

Some key results from the testwork program are presented in Table 18-12.

The results show that the mineralisation exhibits very fast leaching kinetics with approximately 97-99% of the 
nickel, and 95-96% of the cobalt, extracted within 20 minutes of leaching time. Free acid levels at the end of 
the tests amounted to approximately 35-45 g/L for acid additions ranging between 276 and 351 kg/t. Ferrous 
iron concentrations were generally high (up to 9.6 g/L) but with air overpressure in the autoclave the ferrous 
iron concentration in leach solution was decreased to 4.7 g/L. In a later HPAL test, HPAL.08, conducted as 
part of the integrated HPAL/AL/SN test SN.03, higher air overpressure (500 kPa) resulted in a ferrous iron 
concentration of just 270 mg/L.

18.3.8 Atmospheric Leach Testing  

AL tests were conducted on saprolite samples in stirred vessels at 95°C and at acid addition rates from 850 
to 1000 kg per tonne of feed mineralisation. The samples were prepared using a sea water/fresh water mix 
in the ratio 3.8:1. The water blend was established by modelling in METSIM® and reflects mineralisation 
slurrying using seawater adjusted for the impact of mineralisation moisture and process dilution by gland 
water, screen sprays and flocculant make-up water.   

The results of the atmospheric AL tests are presented in Table 18-13.

and 88 to 94% for cobalt. Final free acid concentrations ranged between 17 and 39 g/L.

Ferric and ferrous iron concentrations were shown to significantly increase with increasing acid additions.  
Magnesium concentrations were very high at 65-75 g/L. 

18.3.9 Saprolite Neutralisation Testwork – Combined HPAL, AL Slurry 

A combined leach pulp for the saprolite neutralisation testwork was prepared from two separate leach tests 
as follows:   

� AL test on saprolite sample at a pulp density of 35% w/w for 240 minutes at a temperature of 90°C   

� HPAL test on a sample of L/T blend sample for a leach time of 30 min at an acid addition of 350 kg/t 
and temperature of 255°C and a density of 29% w/w. 

Saprolite mineralisation for neutralisation was added to sub-samples from the combined pulp in varying 
ratios. In each test the slurry was agitated for six hours and subsamples taken to monitor solution acidity and 
elemental concentrations, as well as solids samples to monitor metal extraction.  

Results from saprolite neutralisation are summarised in Table 18-15.

A scoping test (SN.01), during which saprolite mineralisation was progressively added in the SN step to 
establish the optimal conditions for subsequent confirmatory tests, produced the first four test results shown 
in Figure 18-2. The last two tests (SN.02 and SN.03) were confirmatory tests in which all of the SN feed 
mineralisation was added at the beginning. The confirmatory tests showed that neutralisation of a combined 
HPAL and AL pulp with saprolite mineralisation resulted in the dissolution of 83-89% of the nickel and 78-
87% of the cobalt contained in the neutralising saprolite. Concentrations of total iron in solution decreased 
with residual free acid due to precipitation of sodium jarosite, a benefit of using seawater for mineralisation 
slurrying. Final ferrous concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 4.5 g/L.    

The kinetics of the neutralisation reactions for the test at a ratio of 1.00:0.79:0.36 (L/T:Sap:SN Sap) are 
plotted in Figure 18-2.

18.3.10 Saprolite Neutralisation Testwork –AL Slurry 

AL tests were undertaken to provide a pulp for saprolite neutralisation at a pulp density of 35% w/w for 240 
minutes.   

Subsamples of the leached pulp were neutralised with varying ratios of saprolite. In each test the slurry was 
agitated for six hours and subsamples taken to monitor solution acidity and elemental concentrations, as well 
as solids samples to monitor metal extraction.

Approximately 70-84% of nickel and cobalt was leached from the saprolite mineralisation used in 
neutralisation at a residual acid concentration of 4-8 g/L. 

18.3.11 Settling Testwork on Saprolite Neutralised Slurry  

Settling testwork was undertaken on the pulp from the saprolite neutralisation testing to investigate slurry 
thickening characteristics. Tests were conducted in two metre high raked columns. Flocculant used in the 
testing was Magnafloc 10. Tests were conducted on both HPAL/AL/SN pulp and AL/SN pulp, Table 18-17.

Settling testwork on the AL neutralised pulp showed lower densities and higher thickener requirements than 
that for HPAL/AL. 

18.3.12 Limestone Calcination and Activity 

Drill samples from the limestone deposit at the mine lease were obtained for testwork and a composite 
sample prepared. 

A sub-sample of the limestone was crushed to size -25 mm +9 mm and then calcined in a furnace at 1050°C 
for varying residence times from 30 to 120 minutes. The mass loss of sample was monitored, and the 
available lime determined. The test results showed that after 60 minutes the mass loss was 44% with an 
available lime of 92%. The neutralising capacity of the lime was reported at 1.26 t acid/ t hydrated lime. 

A test on a sub-sample of limestone was undertaken to investigate the neutralisation activity. Tests were 
undertaken by neutralising a 48 g/L sulphuric acid solution with staged additions of dry ground limestone and 
pH monitoring. The neutralising capacity of the limestone was reported at 0.94 t acid/ t limestone.

19.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

The Mineral Resource estimation was completed by Mike Job, Principal Consultant for Quantitative Group 
(QG) of Fremantle, West Australia.  

The geological modelling uses a set of points at the contacts of the various layers in each drill hole. These 
points are triangulated into a surface wireframe to generate the geological model 

The approach used by QG is to distinguish the limonite layer (LIM) from the saprolite (SAP) layer by the 
lower magnesium values in the LIM. The SAP to Bedrock (BED) contact was identified by using nickel assay 
data (generally less than 0.4% Ni) and geological logging. Additional control points were inserted at 
interpreted locations in-between drill holes in order maintain geological consistency and to account for drill 
holes finishing before hitting bedrock.  

The main geology zones modelled are limonite (LIM), saprolite (SAP) and bedrock (BED). 

19.1 Unfolding 

To assist in proper grade interpolation, the Datamine dynamic search feature was used which allows the 
orientation of the search neighbourhood ellipse to be defined separately for each block (in this instance, the 
variogram was also rotated to align with the search, but this does not always need to occur). 

19.2 Data Preparation 

19.2.1 Grades 

The following grades are estimated in the resource modelling process: Ni%, Co%, Fe%, SiO2%, Mg%, and 
Al2O3%.  

19.2.2 Sample Length 

The drilling database for the Agata deposit provided to Golder contains a range of sample intervals, with 
approximately 78% of intervals assayed for nickel being less than or equal to 1 m length, 21% on 1 to 2 m 
length, with the remainder greater than 2 m length. The long samples appear to be predominantly in bedrock 
material.  

19.3 Geology Model 

19.3.1 Geology Interpretation 

Gifford, 2010 describes the interpretation process. The abrupt change in geochemistry between limonite and 
saprolite and the grade decrease from saprolite to bedrock provide the position of these surfaces on each 
drill hole.  

The resource analyst used these points in Datamine software to create a triangulated surface of the contacts 
across the deposit area. These triangulations then become limits for coding cells in the Resource block 
model.

19.4 Independent Review 

19.4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis 

Domaining 

The geological modelling was used as the input for creating domains for estimation purposes. Interpolation 
of the various assay elements was done separately for: 

� LIM 

� SAP. 

Physical or chemical attributes were not estimated for the Bedrock layers. 

Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis has been carried out by QG on the final drill composited data. This involved generating 
univariate statistics and histograms. 

Golder composited the data to 1 m downhole and flagged the composite data to the saprolite and bedrock 
wireframe surfaces provided. Analysis of cumulative log probability plots of Ni% within the modelled LIM 
domain shows a difference in lithologies codes of LF, LA and LB horizons. Analysis of Figure 19-2 indicates 
that the Ni% distribution is somewhat different for the three limonite zones. Fe, Al and Mg show some 
differences too. 

Ni% distribution within the modelled SAP domain also shows two distinct populations. One associated with 
general saprolite material and one associated with boulders. Figure 19-3 provides probability plots of Ni% 
and Mg% for boulder and saprolite samples within the modelled SAP domain. The Ni% grade is much lower 
grade for the boulder and with much elevated Mg% than the saprolite material.  

The relationship between various elements was also examined for the composited data by plotting various 
scatter diagrams. A moderate positive relationship is noted between Ni% and Fe%. The relationship for Ni% 
and Mg% is also moderate to strong negative. Mg% increase sharply as the Ni% decreases.

19.4.2 Compositing 

The first part of any resource estimation is to ensure that all data are defined at the same support. Given the 
raw sample length distribution, the use of 1 m composites for the interpolation process is reasonable. This is 
also supported by the narrow geometry of some of the geological layers. Splitting of the larger intervals 
(i.e. 22% of the data) may tend to artificially understate the true variability of the data, by creating 1 m 
composites that have the same grades. However, as the majority of the large composites sit between 1 m 
and 2 m in length the impact is expected to be minimal.  



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 60 

 

Due to the geometry and position of the some of the regolith horizons, the use of 1 m composites is 

acceptable. Preparation of the composite map files for grade estimation has been carried out in a 
diligent manner. 

19.4.3 Grade Capping 

No outlier or high grade cutting was used. 

19.4.4 Variography 

Variography was undertaken to provide parameters for Ordinary Kriging grade estimation. QG modelled 
variograms for all the major elements (Ni%, Co%, Fe%, SiO2%, Mg% and Al2O3%) based on 1 m 
composites. 

Nugget effects in the QG variogram models used for estimation appear to be low and reasonable, with 
overall ranges of influence of the order of 100 m. QG observed consistent spatial trends between the 
variables. The variography has assumed an isotropic behaviour in horizontal direction with an 
omni-directional variogram representing both major and semi-major axis. This reflects variography by QG 
which indicated that there was not anisotropy in the horizontal plane. The directional variograms were not 
presented by QG to demonstrate that the isotropy assumption was valid. 

Unlike estimation approach which uses local dip and dip direction (unfolding) the variography has been done 
horizontally. 

19.4.5 Density 

Density sampling and determination completed by Mindoro is discussed in Section 14.2. 

It is Golder's opinion that there are insufficient density measurements to qualify any part of the resource as 
Measured. Based on our experience, the dry bulk density values for limonite may be too high given the high 
moisture content.   

Similarly, the preferential selection of competent core in saprolite may cause an over statement of saprolite 
density. However, it does not appear that Mindoro allowed any density variation for boulders, which will be 
higher density than weathered saprolite.  

19.5 Block Model Estimation 

The Mineral Resource for Agata was estimated using Ordinary Kriging (OK) which is based on variogram 
parameters that provide the parameters for the spatial continuity. The interpolation of grade was constrained 
to the geological modelling domains. The domains confining the composited samples were defined using 
Datamine wireframe triangulations developed for the limonite and saprolite domains. The geology is 
assigned into blocks of size 20 m × 20 m × 1 m. The estimation is based on 1 m composited data into these 
blocks. 

The grid drilling is nominally 25 m × 25 m, 50 m × 50 m, 100 m × 100 m or larger. In this context a block size 
of 25 m × 25 m would be a better option to keep the drill holes uniformly distributed into the blocks. This 
however is not expected to alter the final outcome. 

Grade interpolation by OK was implemented using hard boundary conditions for each of the estimation 
domains. The search ellipses were oriented according to the local dip and dip direction using the Datamine 
dynamic search feature. The process of estimation involved three passes. The search distance was doubled 
for each pass to enable estimation of more blocks into the block model. Implementation of passes for each 
layer was the same and systematic, with a normal search. 

A maximum of 40 samples was used for the first and second estimation pass, reducing to 20 for the third 
pass. Overall the search parameters are reasonable. No outlier or high grade cutting was used.

19.5.1 Validation of Block Models 

The 2010 documentation contains statistical and swath plot checks to demonstrate the validity of the 
resource model. Overall, these validations are well-presented and demonstrate that the model behaves 
reasonably. 

19.6 Resource Classification 
The procedure adopted by QG to define reporting classes is primarily by the density of drilling. 

For the majority part of the deposit comprising 50 × 50 m or 100 × 100 m drilling the model is classified as an 
Indicated Resource. The only areas of Inferred Resources are around the steep-sided creek systems, where 
the drilling is on a broader pattern and the laterite horizons thin out. 

A small amount of Measured Resources has also been introduced where drilling approaches to 25 × 25 m 
density. 

19.7 Selectivity, Mineralisation Loss and Dilution 

No assessment of the block model smoothing is evident in the 2010 documentation. This is necessary as the 
estimation always incorporates a smoothing effect to account for the change of volume from sample to 
blocks. The question that need to be addressed if this level of smoothing is a desirable level to account for 
potential dilution and mineralisation losses based on the expected mining selectivity.  

The success of the resource model at Agata will to a large extent be dependent on the accuracy of the 
geological model produced. Therefore the uncertainty inherent in the geological model also needs to be 
investigated. 

Golder believes that presence of boulders within the saprolite layer will present mining recovery and 
metallurgical recovery issues. Boulder has presently been mixed with saprolite in the current model and 
there is no indication of amount or grade of such material. 

Golder recommends the evaluation of the saprolite mining recovery using a conditional simulation model with 
appropriate transfer function. 

19.8 Assessment of Reasonable Prospects of Economic Extraction 

19.9 Mineral Resource Statement 

The Agata Nickel Project has estimated combined Measured and Indicated Resources of 32.59 Mt at 1.04% 
Ni, and an inferred resource of 1.68 Mt at 1.04% Ni for a combined 357 500 t of nickel, as reported in 
Mindoro's NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate of 8 September 2010, using a cut-off grade of 
0.5% Ni for limonite and 0.8% Ni for saprolite. The summary of the NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource is 
presented in Figure 19-1.

20.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

20.1 Preliminary Hydrological and Hydrogeological Assessment 

The Western Range is located in a mountainous region with several creeks draining towards the Mindanao 
Sea on the western side and towards the Kalinawan Valley on the eastern side.  

The Kalinawan River (referred to as the Tubay River in previous studies) is situated about 1 km east of the 
proposed mine area and flows in a southerly direction. Tumanda et al. (2004) report that the average 
discharge of the Kalinawan River is about 2 M m

3
/day (2000 ML/d) and more than adequate to meet project 

water requirements. The water quality of this river is very good (Coffey, 2008) with Total Suspended Solids 
(TSS) concentrations of about 2 mg/L and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations of about 70 mg/L.  
Nutrient levels are low ranging between 0.2 to 1.2 mg/L nitrate. 

Lake Mainit is a large freshwater lake situated approximately 4 km north of the proposed mine area. The 
water quality of this lake is very good (Coffey, 2008) with TDS concentrations of about 80 mg/L and low 
nutrient concentrations.   

There is no information on the groundwater potential in the region from previous studies. Groundwater does 
occur in (probably shallow) alluvial sediments in the Kalinawan Valley. Groundwater is being used for mostly 
domestic Process Plant 

20.2 Mining Plan 

20.2.1 General 

The mining inventory and methodology used to develop the Agata Nickel Project Mining and Plant Feed for a 
hydro-metallurgical process. Schedule V9d.was prepared by Dallas Cox (2011) Principal Consultant Crystal 
Sun Consulting Limited for Mindoro  

Scheduling was carried out using three phases and 63 mining panels (approximately 250 m by 250 m). 

Approximately 5% of the mining inventory is categorised as Inferred Resource but is only mined towards the 
end of the scheduled periods. Golder considers the impact of the Inferred Resources in the schedule to be 
not material. 

Golder recommends future estimates of mining inventories include only Mineral Resources classified as 
Measured and Indicated or Mineral Reserves if estimated. 

Excessive stockpile build-up in the latter half of the schedule was flagged by Cox (2011) as an issue to be 
addressed in future studies.  

The high quantities of stockpile and rehandling of mineral inventory for plant feed result in higher mining 
costs. Further mining scheduling is recommended to optimise balancing of grades and quantities to the 
plant. The present schedule is acceptable for a conceptual study. 

20.2.2 Mining Inventory 

The Mineral Resource defined by the NI43-101 Technical report (September 2010) was the used as a basis 
to generate a mining inventory.  

The cut-off grades used to define mineralisation in the mineral inventory were 0.5 Ni% and 0.8 Ni% for 
limonite and saprolite, respectively. These are arbitrary cut-offs in line with the resource estimate cut-off 
grades.  

A "pit base" was generated using the "Base of Saprolite" contact. Future pit design work will incorporate final 
ramps and batters/berms where necessary (Figure 20-1). 

Nickel mineralisation in the lower part of the mineralisation profile, namely saprock and boulder saprolite 
categories, were excluded from the resource base. The mining inventory of 26.1 M dmt represents a 76% of 
the Mineral Resource of 34.1 M dmt.

The methods used to delineate the likely open pit extent are considered reasonable.

The pit was divided into three areas/phases (Figure 20-2) partly based on mineralisation categorisation and 
to obtain early nickel production.

Moisture contents of 31.7% and 20.6% for limonite and saprolite respectively were used for equipment

20.2.3 Mining and Plant Feed Schedule 

The primary goal of the schedule was to deliver the highest grade nickel mineralisation to the plant in the 
early years of operation and maintain a balanced feed of material stream feed to the respective HPAL, SN 
and AL circuits.    

The mining schedule (V9d) in general meets both plant feed and mining considerations (Table 20-3).  
However it generates excessive stockpile build-up from Year 6. This issue needs to be addressed in future 
scheduling studies.

20.3 Metallurgy 

Two metallurgical testwork programs have been conducted on samples from the Agata deposit. The most 
recent program of work conducted at SGS Lakefield in Perth has shown that: 

� Limonite mineralisation is amenable to processing by HPAL and has fast leaching kinetics with 
approximately 97-99% of the nickel extracted within 20 minutes of leaching time. 

� Saprolite mineralisation is amenable to AL with favorable extractions of over 95% Ni in four hours.

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 72 

 

� Other metallurgical characteristics are considered to be typical of tropical nickel-cobalt laterite 
mineralisation deposits 

The metallurgical testwork undertaken to date is considered to be of a scoping nature only. More detailed 
programs of work are required as part of the planned project Feasibility Studies. It is recommended that 
future work programs include: 

� Additional bench scale testwork on representative composite samples based on the latest mine 
schedules. 

� Comprehensive leach variability testwork using samples from a range of spatial pit locations, 
mineralisation types and grades throughout the deposit. This should include both HPAL and AL testing 
for the relevant mineralisation types, as well as slurry characterisation. 

� Further evaluation for upgrading of limonite by large scale scrubbing tests and continuous scrubbing 
piloting. 

� Continuous testwork and piloting of the total proposed circuit with recycling of intermediate streams. It is 
important that blending of composite samples for piloting reflects the amount of each mineralisation 
type in the planned mine schedule.  

20.4 Process Plant 

20.4.1 Introduction 

A Scoping Study to evaluate hydrometallurgical processing of the limonite and saprolite mineralisation types 
from the Agata deposit was issued in 2010. The processing aspects of the Scoping Study were jointly 
undertaken by Boyd Willis Hydromet Consulting (BWHC) and engineering company Ausenco Vector, under 
management of BHWC. The Scoping Study evaluated a number of options for the project involving HPAL 
and AL.   

In 2011 BHWC has undertaken further process and engineering studies as part of this PEA based on a 
preferred option involving parallel HPAL and AL circuits.    

20.4.2 Process Selection 

Limonite and low magnesium grade saprolite mineralisation will be treated in a dedicated HPAL circuit. The 
process design for the HPAL leach plant is based largely on the hydrometallurgical route proven at Moa Bay 
in Cuba for five decades, and at the Sumitomo/Nickel Asia operated Coral Bay Nickel Project (Coral Bay) in 
the Philippines since 2005.   

Medium grade magnesium saprolite mineralisation will be treated in a parallel AL circuit. The AL circuit 
option has recently gained recognition as an alternative to the high capital cost HPAL route. An AL circuit 
was operated by BHP Billiton at their Ravensthorpe operations. The process is currently being investigated 
by Weda Bay Nickel (Eramet) in Indonesia, Berong Mining in the Philippines and BHP Billiton nickel projects 
to treat their high grade saprolite mineralisation types.   

An innovation in the Agata proposed processing route will be the inclusion of saprolite neutralisation (SN).  
This will involve pre-neutralisation of the residual free acid in the combined leach discharge streams using 
high magnesium saprolite ore. This process, performed at atmospheric pressure, will consume much of the 
free acid while recovering additional nickel and cobalt values from the saprolite ore. Neutralisation of the 
remaining acid will be achieved using limestone. 

After SN, the pregnant solution will be recovered by conventional counter-current decantation (CCD), 
followed by limestone neutralisation of excess acid and precipitation of iron, aluminium and chromium, prior 
to metal recovery.

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 73 

 

Metal recovery will be by a two-stage MHP circuit similar to that operated for several years at the Cawse 
Nickel Project (Western Australia) and more recently at Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation (Western Australia). 
The MHP will be exported. 

20.4.3 Development of Process Design Criteria 

20.4.3.1 Preparation of Mineralisation  

Separate mineralisation preparation facilities are proposed for limonite and saprolite mineralisation types.   

The slurry settling tests at SGS demonstrated that limonite could be settled to 40% solids and saprolite to 
34-36% solids.   

Testwork at SGS included preliminary scrubbing and screening. This work demonstrated that scrubbing a 
sample of limonite/transition mineralisation blend followed by screening at 0.25-0.50 mm would recover 
about 90% of the nickel while rejecting 18-19% of the total mass, 36-38% of the silica and 37-40% of the 
magnesium. Based on these results additional equipment has been included in the design to allow for 
de-agglomeration (scrubbing/screening) to potentially liberate nickel bearing fines from barren coarse 
material, however no upgrade or rejection has been included in the PEA mass balance.

Ramu, Marlborough and Wingellina. Design criteria for the downstream processing steps were selected from 
database information for these projects. 

20.4.4 Mass Balance Calculations 

The process flowsheets, process design criteria and the testwork data from the SGS metallurgical testwork 
program were used to develop a process mass and energy balance. The simulation software used for the 
PEA process model was METSIM®, and the model was developed by BWHC.  

The METSIM® model was developed using the selected flowsheet, including the major equipment items. 
METSIM® employs a comprehensive component database, including detailed thermodynamic properties, to 
balance the mass and energy flows, and to simulate the performance of a full scale operating plant. The 
inputs into the model included: 

� plant feed tonnages 

� head grades 

� chemical reactions and reaction extents 

� reagent composition and utilisation 

� operating conditions (temperature, pressure, etc). 

The objective of the METSIM® model was to generate: 

� mass balance 

� energy balance 

� reagent consumptions 

� product tonnages 

� waste/effluent quantities. 

The METSIM® model generated stream mass and volume flows, which were used in developing the capital 
and operating cost estimates.

Product Section: 

� Mixed Hydroxide Precipitation Stages 1 and 2. 

Process Services: 

� Sulphur Handling 

� Sulphuric Acid Plant 

� Limestone Plant 

� Lime Plant 

� Reagent Preparation. 

20.4.5.2 Leach Plant 

The mineralisation treatment plant includes separate circuits to treat limonite and saprolite ores. The limonite 
mineralisation preparation circuit produces de-agglomerated limonite slurry for HPAL and the saprolite circuit 
produces three types of ground saprolite slurry for HPAL, AL and SN.  

The limonite mineralisation treatment plant comprises the following principal operations: 

� primary crushing to <200 mm by roll sizer 

� limonite de-agglomeration by wet rotary drum scrubbing and rejection of the coarse oversize fraction 
(>10 mm) by screening 

� single stage, closed circuit ball milling to produce a ground limonite slurry 

� HPAL feed slurry thickening. 

The saprolite mineralisation treatment plant consists of the following principal operations: 

� primary crushing to <200 mm by roll sizer 

� single stage, closed circuit saprolite SAG milling to produce ground saprolite slurry 

� storage tanks for three types of ground saprolite slurry: low magnesium saprolite, medium magnesium 
saprolite and high magnesium saprolite 

� thickening of the medium magnesium saprolite and high magnesium saprolite slurries for delivery to 
atmospheric leaching and saprolite neutralisation. 

HPAL feed comprises limonite and low magnesium saprolite mineralisation slurries, which are combined in 
the required proportions in the HPAL feed thickener. The HPAL plant includes feed slurry heating, leaching 
of nickel and cobalt from limonite mineralisation at high temperature (255°C) and pressure (4425 kPag), and 
autoclave discharge slurry pressure letdown. Atmospheric leach feed comprise medium magnesium saprolite 
slurry. In the atmospheric leach circuit nickel and cobalt are leached from saprolite mineralisation at 
atmospheric conditions (95-100°C and ambient pressure). Sulphuric acid is used as the lixiviant for both 
HPAL and atmospheric leaching. The HPAL circuit maximises heat recovery by recycling steam flashed 
during depressurisation of the slurry back to the preheat circuit. 

A recycle leach circuit uses a small stream of sulphuric acid to re-dissolve nickel and cobalt precipitated in 
the downstream iron/aluminium removal and second stage MHP circuits. Discharge slurries from the HPAL, 
atmospheric leach and recycle leach circuits are combined and forwarded to the saprolite neutralisation 
circuit where the neutralising capacity of the high magnesium saprolite mineralisation consumes some of the 
excess free acid. Additional nickel and cobalt are leached from high magnesium saprolite during this

PROJECT

process. The resultant slurry flows to a seven-stage CCD circuit, to separate and wash soluble nickel and 
cobalt from the leach residue solids. 

The recovered pregnant liquor (CCD-1 overflow) is forwarded to two stages of iron/aluminium removal. In the 
first stage of iron/aluminium removal the majority of the remaining free acid in solution is neutralised with 
limestone slurry and most of the ferric iron and some of the aluminium in solution are precipitated. The 
product slurry is thickened and the precipitated solids are directed to CCD-3 for recovery of soluble nickel 
and cobalt across the back half of the CCD circuit. In the second stage of iron/aluminium removal the 
remaining iron and aluminium are precipitated. The pregnant liquor is separated from the precipitated solids 
by thickening prior to transfer to the MHP area. Some nickel and cobalt are co-precipitated so the thickener 
underflow slurry is directed to the recycle leach circuit for recovery of the metal values.  

The barren leach residue solids from the final stage of CCD washing along with barren solution from the 
MHP circuit report to final neutralisation (FN) circuit where limestone and lime slurries are added sequentially 
to raise the pH of the slurry and precipitate most of the remaining metals from solution. An air stream is used 
as an oxidant in this process to aid manganese precipitation. The discharge slurry is thickened and the clear 
overflow solution is returned to the CCD circuit as wash water.  

Treated residue is pumped, at about 30% solids content, through an approximately 6 km long slurry pipeline 
to the residue storage facility (RSF). At the RSF, the residue is hydraulically deposited behind the retaining 
wall. Consolidation of residue over time produces a decant liquor which is returned via a decant pipeline to 
the process plant. The excess RSF decant is discharged to ocean outflow and is closely monitored to ensure 
compliance with the environmental discharge standards. 

20.4.5.3 Product Section 

The virtually iron/aluminium-free pregnant leach solution (PLS) is forwarded to the first stage MHP reactors 
to precipitate the nickel and cobalt from the solution by the addition of magnesia slurry. The resulting 
precipitate contained in the slurry is subsequently directed to thickening. A portion for the thickener 
underflow slurry is recycled as seed to the first stage MHP reactors and the balance is forwarded to wash 
filtration. In wash filtration, the precipitate is filtered for further dewatering and washed with demineralised 
water to displace the chlorides and other sea salts entrained with the precipitates. The filter cake is then 
repulped with demineralised water and filtered in a pressure filter to achieve the required product moisture 
specification. The MHP product is packaged in 2 t bulk bags and stored in standard 6 m containers for 
shipment and sale. 

The un-precipitated nickel and cobalt values present in the first stage MHP thickener overflow are further 
recovered by lime precipitation in the second stage MHP reactors. The resulting precipitate is thickened and 
recycled back to the recycle leach area to re-dissolve the nickel and cobalt.  

20.4.5.4 Plant Services 

Major process packages include a sulphur-burning acid plant, a limestone slurrying plant, a lime kiln and lime 
slaking plant, a magnesia slurrying plant and a residue storage facility. 

The sulphuric acid plant provides sulphuric acid for the leaching circuit and other process consumers, and 
high pressure steam for power generation. The acid plant products are up to 2700 t/d of 98.5% sulphuric 
acid and up to 152 t/h of HP steam. 

The limestone plant provides limestone in slurry form for neutralisation of acidic process liquors and crushed 
limestone for burnt lime production. The limestone plant consists of crushing and slurrying facilities. The 
limestone slurry at 30% solids is pumped to the process plant via a limestone slurry ring main. 

The lime plant provides lime in the form of milk-of-lime slurry for neutralisation of acidic process liquors and 
precipitation of nickel and cobalt in the second stage MHP circuit. The plant consists of a fuel-oil fired 
limestone calciner and lime slaking facilities. The milk-of-lime is pumped to the process plant via a ring main.

The magnesia slurrying plant provides magnesia slurry for the precipitation nickel and cobalt as mixed 
hydroxides in the first stage MHP circuit. The magnesia slurry is pumped into the MHP reactors under 
dosage control. 

20.5 Plant and General Infrastructure 

20.5.1 Introduction 

The provision of infrastructure is a significant part of the overall development of the project due to the green 
field nature of the proposed site. 

Existing infrastructure facilities are virtually non-existent in the immediate area of the proposed site except for 
an existing gravel public road and the exploration camp facilities. 

Key factors affecting the layout of infrastructure for the project include: 

� the location of the mineralisation bodies 

� the site topography 

� access to site for equipment, operating personnel and reagents 

� the position of the industrial and port sites. 

The facilities will be located predominantly in a coastal valley west of the mine site, as the topography is 
relatively flat compared to the steeper inland terrain.  

The infrastructure facilities to be provided for the project include: 

� water supply and treatment 

� power station and power reticulation 

� port 

� bulk materials handling 

� fuel tank farm 

� solid and liquid waste management 

� plant control system 

� plant site and service buildings and ancillary facilities 

� accommodation village and facilities 

� communications 

� mobile equipment 

� roads 

� security. 

20.5.2 Existing Regional Infrastructure 

A substantial population base exists within a short distance of the project area. The municipalities of 
Santiago and Jabonga, located within 10 km of the project area, each have populations of around 20 000 
people. Situated about 35 km by road to the south, Cabadbaran City has a population of over 60 000.  



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 79 

 

Butuan City, located about 65 km by road to the south, has a population of approximately 310 000, and 
Surigao City, located about 80 km by road to the north, has a population of approximately 132 000. 

Facilities and services in Cabadbaran City include: 

� hospital (Cabadbaran District Hospital) 

� rescue service (Rescue 085) 

� fire station 

� police station 

� electrical utility (ANECO: Agusan del Norte Electric Cooperative) 

� elementary and high schools 

� university (a campus of Caraga State University). 

20.5.3 Site Development 

20.5.3.1 Process Plant Site 

The process plant site is proposed to be located on a coastal site to the southwest of the mine site. The 
advantages of this location are: 

� It has excellent access to the port facilities and the sea. 

� It largely avoids land currently under agriculture. 

� It provides an opportunity to locate the plant at a level above any likely tsunami effect created by 
seismic activity. 

� It provides a platform to locate very heavy plant items on a cut bench therefore reducing foundation 
costs and potential impacts of differential settlement. 

The site is proposed to be located about 200 m inland in order to place the heavier plant on solid ground at 
an elevation of 30–80 m above MSL. The process plant pad will be approximately 650 m in length and 400 m 
in width in a north–south orientation. Some of the lighter plant equipment will be located in fill areas. Surface 
drainage is directed from a central elevated part of the site towards the northeast. Vehicle access to and 
from the plant site is from the north. 

The plant site will be cleared of all vegetation, tree roots grubbed and topsoil stripped from the site will be 
stored in stockpiles for later reuse as topsoil on the completed earthworks. 

Cut material shifted from the more elevated areas of the plant site will be used as fill in the lower areas of the 
plant site and in the port area to meet a minimum plant floor level above MSL. 

This cut to fill construction will include nearby facilities such as: mineralisation stockpile areas, port facilities 
areas, process plant offices, laboratories and control room pads. 

20.5.4 Power Supply 

20.5.4.1 Power Station 

The power station uses steam generators to provide electrical power for the operation of the process plant, 
services and utilities, as well as for the accommodation village and all other related infrastructure.  

High pressure steam is produced from two sources. The major source of high pressure steam is from waste 
heat boilers in the sulphuric acid plant. The secondary source of high pressure steam is from auxiliary boilers 
that will produce supplementary steam into the same header for the high pressure steam distribution system. 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 80 

 

The power station is designed to satisfy two main operating scenarios: 

� generation of 30.9 MW of power, including 16.8 MW of power for normal plant operations, with 124 t/h 
of HP steam imported from the sulphuric acid plant  

� provision of 7.8 MW of power and 16.3 t/h of process steam, to maintain leach plant operation, critical 
equipment in other areas, and the accommodation village during acid plant outages. 

The plant configuration comprises two 16 MW condensing steam turbine generators and two 25 t/h package 
boilers. The two boilers provide significant flexibility to meet varied steam demands. The selection of 
condensing turbines allows low pressure steam to be extracted for process use. 

In addition, for emergency conditions and the black start of the power station, there are two diesel powered 
generators located within the power station complex. These ex-construction generators will be of sufficient 
capacity for their intended long-term function.  

Electric power will be generated at 13.8 kV 60 Hz with the generators connected to a main distribution 
substation for supply to the various process and infrastructure substations. 

The substations will contain switch gear, transformers and motor control centres for the connected loads. 

20.5.4.2 Power Usage Summary 

The estimated power requirements for the project are summarised in Table 20-11.

Total 25.5 16.8 

 

20.5.4.3 Power Reticulation 

The power station complex will contain the Main High Voltage Distribution Room from which will originate the 
feeders to all areas of the facility. 

High voltage distribution from the power station main switchboard will be via 13.8 kV cable. For major load 
centres within the process plant area the cables will go to the relative step down transformers for local 
distribution. 

For sites remote to the process plant, the cables will be connected to open wire 13.8 kV overhead 
transmission lines once they are outside the plant area. These areas include the accommodation 
facilities/camp, river water supply and similar areas.  

The transmission lines generally follow either roads or service corridors to the respective load centres. 

Ex-construction generators will be used at the mine site and at the limestone quarry.

20.5.5 Water 

20.5.5.1 General 

The project has significant water requirements for mining, processing and other uses.  The main water 
requirements are: 

� raw water for dust suppression 

� seawater for ore slurrying 

� filtered raw water for general process plant use 

� potable water for domestic use 

� demineralised water for steam generation and processing. 

Seawater and river water sources were identified as two potential water supply sources for this Project.  
Coffey

1
 ('Consulting Services for the Conduct of Preliminary Baseline Environmental Studies, Volume 3: 

Water') established that there was ample fresh water available from the Kalinawan River system, 
approximately 4 km to the northeast of the process plant site. 

The Water Supply system will consist of the following: 

� main raw water supply to the process plant, port area and accommodation facilities 

� seawater supply to the process plant.

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 82 

 

20.5.5.2 Water Requirements 

The water requirements were estimated based on the process water balance and typical potable water 
demands. 

The total raw water requirement has been assessed at approximately 9330 kL per day.  For design 
purposes, an additional 15% allowance was added to this flow requirement. 

The overall water consumption for the project is summarised in the following table. 

Table 20-12: Water Consumption Summary

Total raw water 9 330 

Filtered water 8 630 

Demineralised water 1 110 

Potable water 100 

Seawater 9 780 

 

20.5.5.3 Concept Design 

The conceptual design for the water supply and major distribution system for this Project has been divided 
into the following elements: 

� pump station intake works at the Kalinawan River 

� major pumping station at the Kalinawan River 

� pipeline from pumping station to raw water storage pond 

� raw water storage pond 

� pipeline from storage pond to process plant and water treatment plant balance tanks. 

20.5.5.4 Water Reticulation 

The water reticulation system will provide water for the following uses: filtered raw water, potable water, 
demineralised water and firewater. 

Treated water will be reticulated throughout the site including to the process plant, port and accommodation 
facilities. 

20.5.5.5 Water Treatment 

The water treatment system produces water to three water quality standards: 

� filtered raw water for process and general plant use including gland seal water, cooling water and fire 
water 

� potable water for human consumption and ablutions 

� demineralised water for boiler feed water and other process water requirements. 

The primary source of water supply will be the Kalinawan River.  The Coffey report states that the river water 
quality is generally good, with little suspended solids and turbidity. 

The proposed treatment consists of the following processes: 

� coagulation/settlement for treatment of filtered raw water 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 83 

 

� R.O. for demineralised water 

� chlorination treatment for potable water. 

The water treatment plant will be located on a designated site at the south of the process plant.  

20.5.5.6 Seawater Supply 

Seawater for the process plant is harvested near the wharf.  The water is screened and then pumped from a 
pumping station near the barge loading area to the sea water storage tank for distribution. Most of the 
seawater is used for ore preparation and in the HPAL vent scrubber.  

20.5.6 Port 

The wharf is located on the northeastern side of the plant area. The water depths beyond 50 m offshore are 
unknown at this stage as well as the seabed geotechnical properties. Assumptions have been made for the 
design and cost estimate for the underwater structures/foundations. The main wharf measures 
approximately 500 m × 35 m. Concrete caissons foundation type will be used in shallow water and steel 
tubular piles in deeper water. The estimate has allowed for piles with maximum length of 40 m. 

The following wharf facilities provide the functional requirements of port operations: 

� the main berth accommodating: 20 000 DWT liquid tankers for acid, heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel, 
50 000 DWT bulk cargo ships for sulphur and product despatch, and 5000–10 000 DWT barges 

� pipeline corridor and pumps for unloading liquid materials (diesel fuel, heavy fuel oil and acid) from the 
ships to storage tanks 

� a 100 t crawler crane for loading and unloading containers 

� admin office and warehouse. 

A heavy lift ramp is provided for unloading autoclaves, at up to 700 t, and other heavy modules during 
construction. This ramp will be designed such that it can be utilised as a permanent facility for accessing 
heavy loads for construction for future expansion and/or for operations. An access road, with maximum slope 
6% and a road width of 6 m, accommodates multi-wheeler trailers with due allowance to minimise curves. 

20.5.7 Bulk Liquid Handling 

The quantities of petroleum products to be consumed by the mining and process operations are sufficiently 
large to make bulk tankers the most cost effective solution. 

The main storage area will be located at the port with service (day) tanks located at the process plant and 
the mine sites, etc. Supply is from either within the Philippines or from Singapore, and it is anticipated that 
vessels will be 20 000 DWT. 

Products that will be delivered by these vessels are heavy fuel oil (power generation, lime kiln) and diesel 
fuel (mobile equipment fleet, etc). 

20.5.7.1 Heavy Fuel Oil 

Heavy fuel oil (HFO) will be pumped ashore by the ship's on-board pumps through a flexible hose to the 
wharf product piping contained in a gallery on the back of the wharf. Product will be metered during delivery 
to bunded storage tanks located onshore adjacent to the wharf. 

The HFO will be pumped from the port storage tanks to the process plant day tank at the rate of 25 m

/hr 

using pumps situated adjacent to the port tanks. A stand-by pump will be provided in case of a breakdown.

20.5.7.2 Diesel Fuel 

Diesel Fuel will be pumped ashore by the ship's on-board pumps through a flexible hose to the wharf product 
piping contained in a gallery on the back of the wharf. Product will be metered during delivery to bunded 
storage tanks located onshore adjacent to the wharf. 

Diesel fuel will be pumped from the port storage tanks to the day storage tanks at the vehicle refueling 
facilities adjacent to the process plant at the rate of 25 m

3
/h using pumps situated adjacent to the port tanks.  

Stand-by pumps will be provided in case of a breakdown. 

A road tanker loading facility will be located adjacent to the port storage tank farm. Diesel fuel will then be 
transported to mine site day storage tanks. At these facilities the tanker will be unloaded into the day tank 
using flexible hoses between tanker and unloading pump manifold. 

At the mine site fuelling facilities, diesel fuel will be independently pumped from day storage tank to heavy 
and light vehicle fuel dispensing equipment according to the required demand. 

A marine fuelling facility will be located at the barge unloading wharf where provision is made to meter and 
control refuelling of marine vessels such as the tugs and line boats. It may be possible for this facility to be 
gravity fed from the port storage tanks. 

20.5.8 Bulk Solids Handling 

20.5.8.1 Bulk Sulphur Handling and Storage 

Bulk prilled sulphur will be delivered in geared Handymax vessels (52–58 000 DWT), and will be unloaded 
using the ships gear and mechanical grabs of 7.5 m

3
 capacity. 

The grabs will discharge to rubber tyred hoppers at the wharf. The hoppers will incorporate a variable speed 
belt feeder discharging to cross-wharf conveyors. The cross-wharf conveyors will also be mounted on rubber 
tyres. 

Sulphur will be transported by a wharf conveyor and transfer conveyor to a radial stacker that will discharge 
to a rectangular stockpile of 65 000 t capacity. The stockpile will be located close to the port area. 

Sulphur will be reclaimed from the stockpile by front-end loader for feed to the plant. 

20.5.8.2 Bulk Limestone Handling and Storage 

Limestone will be quarried from a deposit regional to the process plant. 

Limestone will be delivered by quarry trucks to a ROM hopper adjacent to the quarry. The ROM hopper will 
incorporate a fixed grizzly and a hydraulic rock breaker mounted on the hopper at the grizzly level for 
secondary breakage of any oversize material delivered to the ROM hopper. 

Limestone will then be trucked from the ROM hopper to the process plant site for further crushing and 
processing. For details of this process, please refer to the Process Description section of this report. 

20.5.9 Fuel Tank Farm 

The main storage area will be located at the port with service (day) tanks located at the process plant and 
the mine sites, etc. The size of the storage required is governed by the size of the bulk ships which are 
readily available for charter. It is anticipated that vessels would be up to 40 000 DWT. Products that would 
be delivered by these vessels are Heavy Fuel Oil (power generation, lime kiln) and diesel fuel (mining fleet 
and mobile equipment fuelling). 

The storage tank capacities are sized on the basis of the compartment volumes of the sea tankers likely to 
be used to deliver bulk liquids and the need to have service storage at the site to cover any interruption to 
supply. This interruption could be in the form of a delay in the arrival of a tanker to a break down or failure in 
the transfer pumping system. The storage tanks will be located on-shore, adjacent to the wharf facilities.

Tanks will be fabricated from mild steel and placed inside separate earth bunds at the port and mine sites, 
and inside bunding appropriate to the location in the process plant. The size of tanks at the process plant 
and mine site is based on daily consumption estimates. 

20.5.10 Liquid and Solid Waste Management 

20.5.10.1 Waste Water Treatment 

In order to meet the appropriate environmental standards for the disposal of sewage effluent from the facility, 
it is proposed to construct a centralised sewage reticulation system to cater for the administration centre, 
change house and other buildings. A packaged sewage treatment plant to handle domestic type waste water 
will be installed. 

As the service buildings are scattered over a wide area it may not be practical to connect some of the more 
remote buildings with only one or two toilets to the central sewage reticulation system. In these cases septic 
tanks with transpiration beds to absorb the partially treated effluent would be provided. Alternatively the 
septic tanks could be increased in size to form holding tanks and the influent could be pumped out to a 
tanker and carted on a daily basis to the main sewage treatment plant for further processing. 

20.5.10.2 Solid Municipal Waste Management 

Infrastructure facilities will be developed to provide for the disposal of solid wastes generated by the process 
plant and the accommodation village facilities and construction camp, in separate sites. These solid waste 
disposal facilities will most likely be located in a remote valley close to the mine area. They will be provided 
with secure access to ensure safe and efficient operation and storage. 

20.5.10.3 Plant Process Control System 

The process control system is a vital element in achieving safety of personnel and plant as well as efficiency 
and reliability of plant operation. It will be designed to maximise the operability and availability of the 
respective operating areas, while minimising the operator intervention required to control the plant.  
However, in accordance with normal operating procedures, sufficient full time operators are still required to 
handle potential plant upsets. 

All plant devices are to be operated and controlled from a single Central Control Room (CCR) by Operator 
Interface Stations (OIS) via a Distributed Control System (DCS). All interlocking and sequencing will be 
performed by the DCS. The DCS will be capable of upward data integration to a Management Information 
System (MIS) and a Maintenance Management System (MMS). A secure internet connection will also be 
included to allow remote plant monitoring. 

Sufficient measuring devices are to be installed to enable the operator to have a total view of the plant. This 
will allow the operator to control all aspects of the plant, such that faults and hazardous occurrences can be 
detected and monitored, and the consequences minimised. 

The parts of the processing plant supplied as vendor packaged equipment are, in some cases, essentially 
'stand-alone' and may be controlled locally by the vendor supplied control panel. The stand alone control 
systems will form part of and be supervised by the plant control system. 

Control of the entire plant is possible from the CCR, which is interconnected via a dual redundant fibre-optic 
data highway to substations and field auxiliary rooms located around the plant. A telemetry system for 
monitoring of remote sites (i.e. the residue storage facility) is integrated with the plant DCS system. 

Each control room operator works on a control panel of multiple OISs. An additional OIS is provided for 
engineering activities and can be used as an operator station in the event of an emergency. The control 
panels are adjacent to each other to allow efficient interaction of the operators. Each panel is capable of 
controlling all areas of the plant, but will typically display the control screens for only part of the plant. 

The CCR is to be located in the leach plant to allow a high interaction between the control room operator and 
the field operators in this area. The control room operators will be in communication with the field operators 
chiefly by hand held radios. Closed circuit television (CCTV) will be installed to allow the control room

operators to visually monitor critical equipment. The field operators will perform all other visual equipment 
monitoring.  

The system provides fully redundant main processor modules operating in parallel. The processor units 
operate independently from each other and any failure detected during internal diagnostic routines will not 
degrade operation of the system. Failure of any one of these processors will cause the system to switch over 
to the back-up module and an alarm to be initiated. 

Communications between different modules on the DCS network will be via a dual redundant data highway.  
Communications between the substation/field auxiliary rooms control system modules will be via a dual 
redundant fibre optic network. 

The DCS controller electronics will be supported by a UPS which will provide 30 minutes of continuous 
operations in the event of a power system failure. 

As the exception to this rule several large equipment items and package plants such as the power station, 
water treatment plant, HPAL feed pumps and process filters may be supplied with their own PCS/PLC 
control equipment. These vendor-supplied systems will form part of, and be supervised by, the plant control 
system and shall be supplied in accordance with the project selection requirements and design criteria. 

Suitable graphic/control group displays will be configured on the OISs in the DCS to monitor the operating 
conditions on each of the above packages. Interlocking between these packages and other process 
equipment will be performed by the plant control system. 

All motors shall have a 'MANUAL/LOCAL' condition reported on the DCS and some motors shall have 
'AUTO/MANUAL' selection on the DCS. 

An emergency bus will supply the emergency lighting distribution boards, UPSs, critical plant instruments 
(including the DCS) and critical equipment such as thickener rake mechanisms, the autoclave agitator seal 
water system and certain utilities. 

20.5.11 Buildings 

20.5.11.1 Plant Site Buildings 

A number of buildings will be constructed at the plant site to support operational activities.

Workshop, storage, shelter buildings will be steel framed structures with corrugated metal sheet walling and 
roofing. 

Foundations will be reinforced concrete spread footings with a maximum depth of 1.5 m from ground level.  
No allowance has been applied for pile foundation. 

The estimate has allowed for furniture, kitchen/laundry equipment and mechanical equipment such as 
overhead crane at the workshop, HVAC, pumps, etc.  

20.5.11.2 Town/Village 

A town/village will be built as the main accommodation facilities to support plant operations. The village has 
been designed to accommodate approximately 50% of the project workforce, with the balance of the 
personnel commuting to site daily from local towns. The accommodation village is located about 1 km from 
the plant area. A dedicated access road will connect the village and plant.  

The town consists of the following: 

� four units at 14 personnel – expatriate/senior staff accommodation 

� four units at 10 personnel – national staff accommodation 

� six units at 48 personnel – non-staff accommodation 

� 300-seat mess hall and kitchen 

� emergency clinic building – can accommodate four patients 

� laundry building 

� general storage building 

� admin building 

� recreation hall 

� Indoor Sport Hall to accommodate table tennis and badminton 

� outdoor sport fields comprise of three lawn tennis courts, one football field, two volley ball/basket ball 
fields 

� sewage treatment plant complete with catch basin 

� two generators: silent type at 750 kVA complete with 5000 L diesel day tanks. 

All buildings at the town/village will be constructed from reinforced concrete structure, brick walling and 
corrugated metal sheet roofing. 

Foundations will be reinforced concrete spread footings with max depth of 1.0 m from ground level. No 
allowance has been made for pile foundations. 

The cost estimate has allowed some assumptions as below: 

� a water supply pipeline, 1000 m long × 150 nominal bore (NB), to transport potable water from the plant 

� allowances for culverts crossing the internal road at the town 

� landscaping 

� furniture, kitchen/laundry equipment and general mechanical equipment, e.g. pumps, High Voltage AC 
(HVAC), etc.

20.5.12 Access Roads 

Access roads are provided to link various coastal infrastructure facilities with the process plant site. These 
facilities include the permanent accommodation facilities and construction camps, port, construction 
industrial area, water and sewerage treatment plants, limestone quarry, waste tips, etc. 

The site access roads will consist of a 6 m wide unsealed crushed rock pavement (i.e. 4 m wide travel lane 
with 2 m wide shoulder allowance). The maximum grades will be limited to 1:8 (12.5%) to allow truck access 
for maintenance purposes. 

20.5.13 Communications 

20.5.13.1 Overview 

Communications are vital for both the construction and the operation of a large plant such as that proposed 
for the Agata Nickel Project. The key focus of this stage of the study has been to produce an estimate for a 
solution that will provide a good compromise between functionality and cost. 

The proposed communications system integrates telephone, facsimile, UHF radio and computer data 
requirements on a VSAT satellite circuit linked to the public network. For mobile communications, a 
multi-channel trunked radio system will provide mobile voice communication. A broadband cable will be 
provided to link the plant area into the main system. 

20.5.13.2 Communications Infrastructure and Equipment 

The scope of the project communications includes: 

� voice communications, both fixed and mobile 

� data communications including network infrastructure and hardware 

� desktop hardware and software (excludes business software and hardware for sulphuric acid plant, etc) 

� security video system 

� satellite television for the permanent accommodation facilities. 

20.5.14 Security and Fencing 

Chain link fencing complete with security posts at access gates will be installed at the perimeter of process 
plant site, village, port, mine camp, mine industrial area and magazine-explosive storage area. A concrete 
wall fence will also be installed at the magazine-explosive storage area for blast containment.  

The fences shall be constructed from: 

� posts: galvanised steel pipe 75 mm × 2 m high, at 3 m spacing 

� galvanised steel chain link 50 mm diamond mesh 

� three lines of galvanised barbed wire on top of fence 

� post-bracing: galvanised steel pipe 50 mm with 45° angle, to be installed at corners or at 12 m spacing 
for straight fence 

� foundation: reinforced concrete with minimum 0.5 m post-embedment 

� gates shall be made of the same material as the fence, and may be either swing or slide operated.

20.6 Residue Management 

20.6.1 Introduction 

As part of the PEA review, Golder has reviewed the sections of the Agata Nickel Project Scoping Study 
(Boyd, USVC-00008-00 RevC, 2010) that relate to residue management. This section presents the results of 
our review and provides a revised cost estimate, based on option to store the first seven years of residue 
generated by the process plant in a valley located to the southwest of the main pit, with subsequent storage 
in an above-ground facility located within the pit footprint. 

20.6.2 Review of existing Information 

A review of the residue management section of the Scoping Study, presented in: 

� Process Plant Description – Base Case and Option 1, Residue Storage Facility  

� Process Plant Description – Option 2, Residue Storage Facility 

� Capital Costs, Table 9-1 and Table 9-2 

� Capital Costs, Residue Storage Facility and Site Development Costs 

� Environmental and Social, Solid Residue Storage 

Information relating to residue management is also referenced in other sections. The pertinent information 
resulting from the review, with commentary from Golder, is presented below. 

� A representative residue sample was not available and hence, the physical properties were assumed 
based on the authors' previous experience. Physical testing of the residue was recommended by the 
authors of the Scoping Study. 

� This approach is reasonable for this level of study. 

� Two alternatives were considered for the RSF: a valley RSF located in the coastal range or 
above-ground impoundments constructed on level ground to the east of the project area. 

� The authors indicate that further work is required to identify suitable valleys and hence, the 
above-ground impoundment was costed for the study. Golder has carried out a desktop study to 
identify candidate valley RSF locations (see Section 20.6.4). 

� A retaining structure was designed for the first eight years of operation, with future expansions allowed 
for as deferred capital. The tailings would be delivered at 23% solids through a 5 km pipeline, with 
hydraulic deposition into the above-ground RSF. 

� This approach seems reasonable provided that sufficient "level ground" is available for the 
above-ground RSF. 

� No figures or drawings were available for review. It is assumed that the RSF is raised in the 
downstream direction. 

� The RSF proposed for Option 2 is consistent with the Base Case and Option 1. 

� This approach appears reasonable for this level of study. 

� The costs associated with the RSF were based on earthworks data provided by Mindoro and estimates 
prepared by Ausenco Vector for a similar project in Northern Philippines. The RSF cost was developed 
assuming three phases of development. 

� This approach appears reasonable. Earthworks data were not available for review, however, costs 
were included in Tables 9-1 and 9-2 and are reproduced in Table 20-13 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 90 

 

� The phases presented in Table 9-2 are not consistent with the phases presented in Section 9.5.1.3 
of the Scoping Study. 

� The RSF is acknowledged as being one of the higher risk components of mining. The authors indicated 
that the RSF should be designed to conventional tailings standards, should make a provision for water 
management and should include other engineering controls such as a liner (geomembrane and/or 
compacted clay), leachate collection systems to minimise hydraulic head on the liner, subsurface drains 
beneath the liner to address groundwater upwelling and aggressive surface water controls to divert 
flows from the TSF. 

� The inclusion of a liner will be dependent on the environmental compliance criteria for the project 
and the points of measurements. However, it appears reasonable to include provision for a liner at 
this level of study. 

� A leachate collection system and subsurface drains are supported by Golder. 

� It is agreed that surface water management will be critical to the success of the project. 

� Incident rainfall, non-diverted surface water and supernatant water will be treated prior to discharge into 
the ocean. 

� This approach is reasonable, provided that sufficient studies are carried out to assess the feasibility. 

� Costs for the RSF estimated in the scoping study (2010) are presented in Table 20-13. 

Table 20-13: Summary of Initial and Deferred Capital Costs included in the Scoping Study 

Phase of RSF Development Estimated Cost from Scoping Study 

Phase 1 USD35 714 000 

Phase 2 USD17 860 000 

Phase 3 USD17 860 000 

Phase 4 (Base Case and Option 1 only) USD17 860 000 

Total USD89 294 000 

 

 

There was no specific information relating to the capacity of this RSF. Assuming a mine life of 20 years 
(reference Section 9.5.1.3 of the Scoping Study) and assuming a tailings tonnage of 1.6 Mtpa (estimated 
based on the solids deposition rate per day presented in Appendix 1.3) the cost per dry tonne of residue is 
estimated to be USD2.79. This cost per dry tonne of residue appears to be on the low end for residue 
management in the Philippines. No allowance for discounting using a net present value approach has been 
included in this calculation. 

20.6.3 Residue Management Options 

20.6.3.1 Overview 

As part of our review, Golder carried out a desktop study to identify candidate locations for the RSF. The 
initial focus was to identify the "level ground" location referenced in the Scoping Study, to allow the 
earthworks volumes to be estimated and a meaningful cost comparison to be made. Candidate locations for 
a valley-fill RSF were also considered. 

20.6.3.2 Engineering Design Criteria and Assumptions 

The following information and assumptions were used in the desktop study. 

� The currently available topographic survey represents the extent of the available leases and candidate 
RSF locations are required to be within this extent 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT

� The facility will lined with a geomembrane or similar 

� A leachate collection system and subsurface drainage system will be required 

� Surface water diversion structures will be required 

� A 5 m freeboard has been allowed for management of supernatant water and stored incident rainfall / 
runoff 

� The tailings beaches have been assumed to be horizontal 

� There are no constraints (e.g. wildlife reserves, townships, etc.) within the area covered by the 
topographic survey 

� Approximately 1.6 Mt of tailings will be generated annually for 15 years (provided by Boyd Willis 
Hydromet Consulting via email on 22 February 2011) 

� An allowance of 12.5% in addition to the above tonnage is recommended to account for possible 
increases in plant through-put (provided by Boyd Willis Hydromet Consulting via email on 22 February 
2011) 

� The tailings will achieve a dry density of about 1 t/m
3
 in the longer term, indicating that a total volume of 

27 Mm
3
 is required to be stored 

� The mined out pit will initially not be available for storage of residue due to scheduling constraints 

Based on the above information, candidate RSF locations were identified within the extents of the survey. 

20.6.4 Candidate RSF Locations 

The candidate valley RSF locations identified in the desktop study are presented in Figure 20-7.

It should be noted that due to the proximity of the river and the slope of the existing topography, a "level 
ground" RSF was not considered to be feasible. The available space was insufficient to construct an 
embankment in three phases (downstream) and provide the required storage capacity. Consequently, the 
costs associated with an above-ground RSF have been estimated assuming that a location with an area of 
~150 ha is available in other locations. 

20.6.5 Cost Estimate 

Golder has developed quantities for the following residue management approach: 

� Management of residue generated in the first seven years in a valley RSF 

� Management of the remaining eight years of residue in the pit void, with the perimeter embankment 
raised as required to provide sufficient capacity. 

The cost for residue management has been based on unit rates adopted by Golder after a review of 
available information relating to similar projects in the Philippines. The sources of information include: 

� Unit rates from our internal database, based on Contractor rates provided by our Manilla office 

� Unit rates estimated by Golder for a similar project near Mindoro 

� Unit rates estimated by Ausenco Vector, provided by Mindoro 

� Experience-based judgement from Golder personnel who have recently worked on Philippines-based 
projects. 

The unit rates adopted for this cost estimate are presented in the table below. 

Item Unit Rate 

Clear and Grub USD0.50 per m
2
 

Liner System, including delivery and placement USD10.00 per m
2
 

Embankment Bulk Fill* USD10.00 per m
3
 

Liner Bedding Material USD12.50 per m
3
 

Excavation of Diversion Channel USD4.30 per m
3
 

* Including winning, hauling, placement, moisture conditioning and compaction 

Adopting these unit rates, the estimated costs are as follows: 

� Capital Cost of Valley RSF = ~USD120 M 

� This cost will be spent in Year 0 and the RSF provides residue management capacity for seven 
years or approximately 12.6 Mm

3
. 

� Deferred Capital Cost of In-pit RSF = ~USD133 M 

� This cost will be spent in Years 6 and 7, ready for deposition in Year 8, and the RSF provides 
residue management capacity for an additional eight years or approximately ~14.4 Mm

3
. 

Please note that the accuracy of the cost estimates presented in this memorandum is about ±35%. A 
contingency amount of 40% would therefore typically be included at this level of study. The contingency has 
not been included in our cost estimate, as Mindoro has advised that a contingency will be applied to the total 
capital cost estimate in the Preliminary Economic Assessment 

20.6.6 Conclusions 

Our review of the Scoping Study indicates that the assumptions and approach appear to be reasonable, with 
the exception of selection of an above-ground RSF. Based on the survey provided, a suitable site for an 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 94 

 

above-ground RSF was not considered feasible within the extent of the survey provided. However, a valley 
RSF location was identified and costed to provide a comparison price. 

Based on our desktop study, it is recommended that a cost of USD120 M be adopted as the capital cost for 
residue management for the PEA. A further USD133 M should be allowed as deferred capital, to be spent 
during Years 6 and 7. 

If a suitable location for an above-ground RSF is identified, the cost of residue management could be 
reduced. 

20.7 Preliminary Hydrological and Hydrogeological Assessment 

The Agata Project is located in a mountainous region with several creeks draining towards the Mindanao 
Sea on the western side and towards the Kalinawan Valley on the eastern side.   

The Kalinawan River (referred to as the Toubay River in previous studies) is situated about 1 km east of the 
proposed mine area and flows in a southerly direction. Tumanda et al. (2004) report that the average 
discharge of the Kalinawan River is about 2 M m

3
/day (2000 ML/d) and more than adequate to meet project 

water requirements. The water quality of this river is very good (Coffey, 2008) with Total Suspended Solids 
(TSS) concentrations of about 2 mg/L and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations of about 70 mg/L.  
Nutrient levels are low ranging between 0.2 to 1.2 mg/L nitrate. 

Lake Mainit is a large freshwater lake situated approximately 4 km north of the proposed mine area. The 
water quality of this lake is very good (Coffey, 2008) with TDS concentrations of about 80 mg/L and low 
nutrient concentrations.      

There is no information on the groundwater potential in the region from previous studies. Groundwater does 
occur in (probably shallow) alluvial sediments in the Kalinawan Valley. Groundwater is being used for mostly 
domestic purposes, but there is no known large scale use of groundwater (e.g. for irrigation). The 
groundwater resource potential should be further assessed if it is considered for a water supply.     

The groundwater potential in the mining region and port is probably poor. The geology is complex and the 
mine area is bound between two major strands of the Philippine Fault with one or more splays passing 
through the region. There are at least six different lithologies, each likely to have different aquifer 
characteristics. In the mining region, the laterites are developed over ultramafic rocks which lie along the 
Western Range. Groundwater is probably associated with fractured rock aquifers. These aquifers may have 
the potential to meet potable water supply but would probably not be sufficient for process water 
requirements. 

20.8 Water Management Plan  

Water associated with any aspect of the mining operation will be managed so that it would not have any 
detrimental impact on the environment and on mining operations. The water management plan would 
comprise: 

� Sediment control structures required to capture any sediment-laden runoff from mine affected areas.  
This will avoid the release of suspended solids into the environment. The proposed sediment control 
structures would comprise earth embankment facilities to capture and store sediment-laden runoff and 
the release of clear water to the environment. 

� Drains to divert non-impacted runoff from entering the mine workings. 

� Installation of buffer storage, pumping facilities and pipelines to ensure the site can cope with large 
rainfall events and subsequent flooding of the mine pits.  

The mine water management plan will also comprise drains to avoid downstream contamination of rivers, 
creeks and streams, provide facilities for the storage and disposal of low quality water and manage surface 
runoff from the process plant and other mine facilities.      



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 95 

 

For the purposes of this study, we assumed that water management would include the following works: 

� Sediment control structures 

� Diversion channels and drains 

� Flood protection earthworks 

� Stormwater drainage systems, and 

� In-pit pumps and pipeline.  

For the purposes of this study, we assumed that the flood protection earthworks would form part of the 
mining operations and the stormwater drainage system would form part of the process plant infrastructure 
requirements. The estimated costs for the sediment control structures and diversion channels and drains is 
USD20 to 40 M. 

20.9 Open Pit Dewatering  
No information on dewatering requirements has been found from previous studies.   

Dewatering requirements depend on the depth of the proposed open pits and the depth to groundwater. 
During the exploration program, none of the shallow laterite drilling holes encountered groundwater. In 
deeper holes, groundwater was encountered at about 40 m depth. A study carried out in the region indicates 
that deeper groundwater depths range between 38 m to 55 m (Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2010).       

Mining the limonite and saprolite resources may require the open pits to be dewatered. This might entail 
dewatering from in-pit sumps or from in-pit and perimeter dewatering bores.  

Dewatering requirements, if necessary, should be reassessed during the pre-feasibility study, once the 
pre-feasibility mine plan is available and more information about the depth to groundwater is obtained.     

For the purpose of this study, as dewatering is not likely, costs associated with dewatering have not been 
included. Surface water management is described in Section 22.11.  

20.10 Environment 

20.10.1 Summary 

To date Mindoro appears to have met environmental assessment requirements appropriately. Mindoro has 
also received two key environmental permits to operate. 

Mindoro now needs to focus on gaining the remaining environmental permits and ensuring all environmental 
permits apply to the new mine plan. 

Mindoro also should consider updating environmental information and establishing structured environmental 
management systems and documentation, as they are important components of meeting permitting 
requirements. 

20.10.2 Overview 

Mindoro is committed to environment, health and safety (EHS) and oversees corporate actions through its 
corporate board EHS committee. 

Mindoro has committed to develop the Agata Nickel Project in accordance with the International Finance 
Corporation Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability, and the requirements under 
Philippine law. 

In response to this commitment, Mindoro is to develop a Health, Safety, Environment and Community Policy 
(HSEC) document jointly with the IFC. Mindoro has also agreed to prepare an Environmental and Social 
Action Plan to cover all HSEC aspects related to exploration activities, feasibility work and potential future 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 96 

 

mine development. In addition, Mindoro, has announced it is developing an Environmental Management 
System (EMS) with the IFC's assistance to adequately manage, plan and document the environmental 
issues relating to their activities in the Philippines. 

In reviewing Mindoro's environmental actions to date relevant to the Agata Nickel Project, Golder reviewed 
Company documents including the following: 

� a series of independent technical reports on the Agata Nickel Project scoping study since September 
2008 (Willis and Gifford, 2010). 

A site reconnaissance to view environmental aspects was not undertaken. 

20.10.3 Environmental Baseline Information 

Mindoro has undertaken baseline studies and impact assessments covering all relevant environmental 
aspects, however these studies were undertaken prior to development of the new 2010 mine plan. Golder 
reviewed summary information in the environmental impact statement (EIS) (Technotrix Consultancy 
Services Inc and Mediatrix Business Consultancy 2007) and concludes that studies were appropriate and 
reasonable. 

20.10.4 Permitting and Approvals 

The permitting and approvals process has been well described (Mindoro Resources Ltd 2011) and the 
following two key approvals for the Agata Project have been approved by the Department of Environmental 
and Natural Resources: 

� Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) 

� Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC). 

The Director of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau also requires the following environmental documentation 
to be submitted and approved before operations may commence: 

� Environmental protection and enhancement program (EPEP) 

� Social development and management program (SDMP) 

� Final mine rehabilitation and decommissioning plan (FMRDP). 

Several other permits relating to port construction, water use and waste management are required that have 
an environmental component. A social and environmental impact assessment that meets IFC standards has 
also yet to be completed. 

20.10.5 Outstanding Environmental Concerns 

The key environmental concern for the ongoing development of the Agata Project is being awarded the 
outstanding permits and approvals, and ensuring the existing permits apply to the updated mine plan, i.e. to 
not only directly ship mineralisation offshore but also to process mineralisation on site in a purpose-built 
facility. 

Updated information addressing the following will be necessary: 

� the specifications, location, and inputs and outputs of the processing facility 

� the environmental effects of the processing operation on both terrestrial and aquatic (including marine) 
environments 

� feasible management options for the environmental effects 

� ongoing environmental management systems. 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 97 

 

A second environmental concern is the apparent lack of completed environmental management 
documentation and a systematic approach to environmental management. Environmental management 
plans for all exploration, construction and operational activities should either be completed or in preparation, 
in parallel with an integrated environmental management system (EIS). Even a simplistic EIS at this stage of 
project development should refer to all permitting aspects, information and documentation requirements, 
roles and responsibilities, site monitoring, compliance requirements and environmental health and safety. 

20.11 Community Engagement and Social Concerns 

20.11.1 Summary 

Mindoro has demonstrated a comprehensive approach to community consultation and socio-economic 
impact studies to date as they have related to exploration activities. The existence of current relationships 
will assist with the effectiveness of future programming as the project progresses towards feasibility studies 
and potential operations. The aim of the program appears well aligned to international standards for good 
practice engagement but no comment can be made on effectiveness until the program is implemented. 

20.11.2 Performance Review 

A Golder desktop assessment of community engagement and social programs indicates that Mindoro has: 

� engaged with the projects near neighbours 

� understands the views of community stakeholders 

� provides information about the project and anticipated impacts for communities 

� supports community needs for education, health and other development needs 

� engages with and seek free and prior informed consent (FPIC) from appropriate indigenous people 

� conducts socio-economic impact studies. 

The approach is consistent with international standards. Work in this area has been assigned to a 
Community Relations and Development Department (ComRel). Some of the key methods Mindoro has 
employed include: 

� Regular Information, Communication and Education (ICE) campaigns, delivering information to 
stakeholders about exploration activities, environmental impacts and mitigations. 

� The establishment of a Community Technical Working Group (CTWG), which includes community 
representation and acts as an advisory group for technical matters relating to the project and 
community development initiatives. 

� Social development programs aimed at local schools, computer literacy, health improvements and the 
empowerment of women. 

� Indigenous people have been engaged in a FPIC program including fieldworks and received benefits 
including capacity building training. 

� A socio-economic profiling study has identified barangays (villages) likely to be impacted by a mining 
project and highlighted potential impacts on those populations (Coffey, 2009). 

20.11.3 Project Impacts and Community Expectation 

While the approach so far has been active and measurable against international standards, Mindoro will be 
aware the move towards feasibility studies and construction of an operating nickel mine will present new 
challenges for maintaining the company's record of achievements in this area. Some of the expected 
impacts of this work will include: 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 98 

 

� resettlement requirements (Golder understands some resettlement and land acquisition discussions 
have taken place) 

� impacts on marine ecology (fisheries) 

� changes to livelihood and lifestyle of communities 

� changes to local habitats 

� impacts on Indigenous people. 

These issues need to be considered in the context of current community expectations which are likely to 
include: 

� financial compensation for land and resettlement 

� high levels of local employment 

� ongoing provision of community services – such as for health and education. 

Mindoro has publicly discussed a five-year program to implement programs aimed at community information, 
capacity building, livelihood, infrastructure, education, health, safety and tourism 
(http://www.MRLgold.com/s/Social.asp). The challenge will be for the company to develop an achievable 
plan for implementing these programs and communicate realistic outcomes to stakeholders. 

20.11.4 Community Engagement 

A desktop assessment of community engagement and social programs currently underway in connection 
with the Agata Project was based on documents provided by Mindoro. 

The material reviewed for this assessment indicates Mindoro has: 

� engaged with the projects near neighbours 

� understands the views of community stakeholders  

� provides information about the project and anticipated impacts for communities 

� supports community needs for education, health and other development needs 

� engaged with and seek free and prior informed consent (FPIC) from appropriate indigenous people for 
exploration and mining work 

� conducts socio-economic impact studies (profiling studies commenced). 

The approach is consistent with international standards including the International Finance Corporation's 
Stakeholder Engagement: A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets 
(IFC, 2007) and the International Council on Mining & Metals' Good Practice Guide: Indigenous Peoples and 
Mining (2010). Both authorities recommend early and effective stakeholder engagement, particularly 
involving those who will be directly affected by a project. All available written information about Mindoro's 
approach to community engagement shows recognition of these principles, which has been steadily building 
into a series of tangible outcomes through the project's exploration phase. Work in this area has been 
assigned to a Community Relations and Development Department (ComRel). Some of the key methods 
Mindoro has employed include: 

� Regular Information, Communication and Education (ICE) campaigns, delivering information to 
stakeholders about exploration activities, environmental impacts and mitigations.

� The establishment of a Community Technical Working Group (CTWG), which includes community 
representation and acts as an advisory group for technical matters relating to the project and 
community development initiatives. 

� Social development programs aimed at local schools, computer literacy, provision of health services

� A socio-economic profiling study has identified barangays (villages) likely to be impacted by a mining 
project and highlighted potential impacts on those populations (Coffey, 2009). 

20.12 Environment Health and Safety  

20.12.1 Summary 

Mindoro has recognised the importance of environment health and safety (EHS) at a corporate level and 
now needs to develop an EHS system on site as a matter of priority during all phases of project 
development. 

20.12.2 Overview 

Mindoro is committed to EHS and oversees corporate actions through its corporate board EHS committee. 

In developing the Agata Nickel Project, Mindoro has identified the need to adhere to both local and 
international legislation and guidelines such as:  

� World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Standards for Mining 

� Labour Code of the Philippines including occupational safety and health standards for all mining 
activities 

� Sanitation Code of the Philippines. 

In addressing EHS requirements, Mindoro has committed to preparing a Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Policy (HSEC) document jointly with the International Finance Corporation. 

20.12.3 Site EHS 

No Mindoro EHS documentation was seen for this PEA and we understand that significant improvement in 
the implementation of EHS standards could be made on site. 

Golder therefore recommends that upgrading EHS standards on site is considered a priority. 
Recommendations to improve EHS performance are proposed in Section 22.11.

PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 100 

 

21.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

21.1 Geological Setting 

Mindoro has a good understanding of geology and geomorphology controls on nickel mineralisation in the 
Agata deposit. The extent of the laterite and hence the nickel mineralisation is well defined by surface and 
outcrop mapping and drilling by Mindoro.  . 

The following items pose potential technical risks to the project: 

� Transition material – transition material may occur at the limonite and saprolite contact. In this style of 
deposit, it may occur over very short distances and thicknesses. Transition material will generally have 
poorer metallurgical properties than either pure limonite or saprolite. 

� Variable and irregular contacts – laterite deposits such as at Agata deposit can be variable over short 
distances. Evidence from costean mapping (Figure 9-4) indicates the potential for a high degree of 
variation in the limonite and saprolite surface, which may have an impact on mining technique, mining 
rates, mineralisation selectivity, and process recovery. 

� Presence of boulders – in similar deposits elsewhere in the region, poorly weathered boulders have a 
significant impact on recovery of saprolite ore. 

� Definition of saprock – Mindoro define saprock as less intensely weathered saprolite typically with lower 
nickel grade. In reality, the identification of saprock is by 0.4% Ni grade cut-off. This approach is 
consistent with industry norms. The nature of this transition from saprolite to saprock results in a highly 
irregular surface, which may have an impact on mining, mineralisation selectivity, and resource 
recovery. 

21.2 Drilling 

� Drilling techniques are industry standard and Golder considers them appropriate for nickel laterite 
deposits. 

� Core recovery is good and procedures for recording depth and hole location are industry standard. 

21.3 Sampling Method and Approach 

� Drilling, drill sampling and logging procedures are well documented and industry standard. Golder 
considers them to be appropriate for nickel laterite deposits. 

� Mindoro also has QAQC systems in place that indicate good quality sampling and assaying. Regular 
independent verification and audits confirm good compliance with procedures and continuous 
improvement to methods and protocols. 

� It is Golder's opinion that there are insufficient density measurements to qualify any part of the resource 
as Measured. Based on our experience, the dry bulk density values for limonite may be too high given 
the high moisture content and may impact on tonnages reported for Mineral Resources.  

� Similarly, the preferential selection of competent core in saprolite may cause an over statement of 
saprolite density. However, it does not appear that Mindoro allows any density variation for boulders, 
which will be higher density than weathered saprolite.  

21.4 Sample Preparation and Security 

� Drilling, drill sampling and logging procedures are well documented and industry standard. Golder 
considers them as appropriate for nickel laterite deposits.

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 101 

 

� Mindoro also has QAQC systems in place that indicate good quality sampling and assaying. Regular 
independent verification and audits confirm good compliance with procedures and continuous 
improvement to methods and protocols. 

21.5 Data Verification 
Golder has not undertaken any independent data verification.   

21.6 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

Mineral Resource 

� The approach taken to build the geology is standard industry practice. It balances and validates 
subjective geological logging of drill samples with geochemistry to determine the position of lithology 
contacts. 

� The simplified connection of limonite/saprolite contact points in drill holes may understate irregularity 
and variation in the contact. This may result in understatement of mineralisation volume and overstate 
lateral continuity of mineralisation. 

� While limonite and saprolite domaining as a whole is a valid starting point, various other lithologies 
within these show distinct and different statistical behaviour. These include LF, LA and LB lithology 
codes within limonite and boulder domains versus saprolite within the saprolite modelled domain. 

� Bivariate relationships between Ni% and other elements in the modelled saprolite domain suggest a 
sharp increase in Mg% as the Ni% grades are reduced. The relationship is positive with Fe% data. 

� More than 10% of the modelled saprolite Domain is consisted of boulder. This may present mining 
recovery and metallurgical recovery issues. 

� Due to the geometry and position of the some of the regolith horizons, the use of 1 m composites is 
acceptable. Preparation of the composite map files for grade estimation has been carried out in a 
diligent manner. 

� Interpretation of the nugget variance used in variography for the purpose of estimation is acceptable. 

� The omni-directional variograms used by QG for variography are based on the assumption of isotropy. 
This approach is an approximation and does not necessarily provide an accurate reflection of local 
directions of continuity or the spatial nature of the variability. Further work in defining local spatial 
variability may provide local improvements in the estimations. Globally this will have a minimal impact 
on estimates and the risk on the reserves will be low.  

� Although the drill hole spacing is quite variable, for the purposes of a resource estimate model the block 
sizes chosen are acceptable for reasonable local estimation quality and to control the smoothing effect. 
The drill hole spacing is generally sufficient to characterise the grade-tonnage curve of 20 m × 20 m × 
1 m blocks for most domains. 

� Use of the Datamine dynamic search feature which equates to a process of unfolding is supportable by 
Golder. 

� The search parameters used for estimation are reasonable. 

� Estimates of block grade for most variables in the block model show good conformance to the data 
average grade.  

� The swath plot model validation indicates acceptable conformance of the OK estimated grade to the 
composited data for most elements and domains.  

� The basis for the resource classification used by QG with classes defined by drill spacing is considered 
by Golder to be reasonable. Further drilling density assessment will be beneficial to the project 
progression.

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 102 

 

� The small undercall in Fe and slight overcall in Ni grades represent a minor risk item.  

Mineral Reserve 

� The mining inventory representing the estimated mill feed tonnage and quality includes Indicated and 
Inferred Resources. Approximately 5% of the mining inventory is classified as an Inferred Resource. No 
Measured Resource is currently reported in this PEA or previous Technical Reports documenting the 
Mineral Resource estimate. 

� No Mineral Reserve estimate is reported in this PEA prepared as a conceptual level study. Mindoro has 
committed to proceeding with a PFS. 

21.7 Mining 

The mineral inventory and scheduling are reasonable for the level of study. 

Approximately 700 kdmt remained on stockpile due to inability to schedule and meets grade requirements at 
the plant.  

The equipment sizing used in the planning is appropriate for the size and style of operation and mining 
selectivity.  

21.8 Metallurgy 

Two metallurgical testwork programs have been conducted on mineralisation samples from the Agata 
deposit. The most recent program of work conducted at SGS Lakefield in Perth has shown that: 

� Limonite mineralisation is amenable to processing by HPAL and has fast leaching kinetics with 
approximately 97-99% of the nickel extracted within 20 minutes of leaching time. 

� Saprolite mineralisation is amenable to AL with favourable extractions of over 95% Ni in four hours. 

� Other metallurgical characteristics are considered to be typical of tropical nickel-cobalt laterite 
mineralisation deposits. 

Further detailed programs of metallurgical testwork including locked cycle and continuous testing, as well as 
variability testing, should be undertaken in the next phase of testwork. 

21.9 Economic Analysis 

An economic analysis using the discounted cashflow (DCF) methodology has been prepared based on the 
HPAL and AL and SN hydrometallurgical process described in this report.    

Based on the mining schedules, capital and operating costs documented in this PEA and a long term nickel 
price of USD10 per pound, the project has a NPV of USD390 M at a 10% after tax discount rate. Based on 
these results Mindoro indicates it will proceed with further study towards development. 

A summary of the PEA financial model results after taxation and excluding financing is presented in 
Table 21-1.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the project is robust to changes in the economic modelling assumptions. The 
analysis has identified that the project is most sensitive to factors which impact on revenue (nickel price, feed 
grade and recovery) followed by capital costs. The project is least sensitive to operating cost estimates. The 
relative sensitivity of the project to revenue, capital and operating cost estimates is illustrated in the 
sensitivity chart Figure 21-1.

22.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

22.1 Geological Setting 

� The nature of contacts between limonite, saprolite, and saprock requires greater understanding. 
Feasibility programs should attempt to characterise the very short-scale (mining scale) irregularity 
through one or more of the following: 

� Close-spaced (5 × 5 m) drilling programs 

� Long (>20 m) and deep (~5 m) trenches in several orientations 

� Geophysical surveys such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) 

� Small-scale (~50 × 50 m) trial mine  

� The presence, frequency, and extent of boulders in the saprolite horizon also require better definitions.  

� Another component of the feasibility study might include conditional simulation studies to assess 
potential mineralisation loss and dilution due to boulders and irregular contacts. 

22.2 Sampling Method and Approach  

� Mindoro should maintain the high standard sampling and QAQC protocols and systems currently in 
place for all future drilling and assaying programs. 

� Golder recommends increasing the coverage of bulk density sampling. Sample sizes should be as large 
as practically possible. If Mindoro dig any pits similar to previous density sampling programs, consider 
measuring volume and weight of the total material from the pit. Mindoro may wish to investigate 
alternative density measurement methods such as downhole geophysical methods. 

22.3 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

� Mindoro should maintain the high standard sampling and QAQC protocols and systems currently in 
place for all future drilling and assaying programs. 

� Mindoro should consider developing a suite of matrix-matched standard reference samples from Agata 
Project sample reject material to monitor the quality of future drilling and assaying programs. 

22.4 Drilling 

� Mindoro should maintain the same standard of drilling for future resource definition programs. 

22.5 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

Mineral Resources 

Golder recommends further investigation about the nature of the limonite/saprolite contact.   

Priority 1 

� Occurrences of boulder and their associated grades in the saprolite modelled area needs to be further 
investigated and characterised.  

� Golder believes that presence of boulder within the saprolite layer will present mining recovery and 
metallurgical recovery issues. Boulder has presently been mixed with saprolite in the current model and 
there is no indication of amount or grade of such material. It is recommended that conditional simulation 
studies be carried out. The simulation studies should include the simulation of the likelihood of 
intersecting boulder runs of various lengths within the saprolite. This will help characterise the risk of 
recovering saprolite for both mining and metallurgical purposes.  



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 105 

 

Priority 2 

� Investigate the possibility of separating LF, LA and LB horizons for domaining purposes.  

� Golder notes a lack of use of high grade cutting or high grade restraining. It is recommended that an 
assessment of high grade outliers be carried out prior to interpolation for the PFS. 

� Investigate possibility of modelling variograms using unfolding techniques.  

� Use variogram maps and directional variography to identify and model orientations of continuity.  

� The 3D integrity of the variogram models need to be assessed to determine whether the models 
provide a satisfactory fit in other directions.  

� Perform assessment of the smoothing effect associated with the current block model.  

� Perform drilling grid analysis to better guide the PFS and DFS studies. 

� Assessment of the uncertainty inherent in the geological model needs to be investigated.  

Priority 3 

� Investigate possibility of using 25 × 25 × 1 m block size to better align with current drill spacing. 

Mineral Reserves 

Mindoro will work towards estimating a Mineral Reserve in the PFS. 

22.6 Mining 

� Carry out fleet selection study based on Version 9d schedule 

� Carry out marginal cut-off grade study on Material type categories based on March 2011 processing 
and financial models 

� Develop mining dilution and mineralisation loss criteria for application in future mining studies 

� Run Pit Optimisation to be run for future planning to better delineate open pit deposit 

� Optimise Mining and Plant Feed schedules with consideration to Stockpile balancing. 

22.7 Metallurgy and Process 

Metallurgical testwork undertaken to date has been of a scoping nature. More detailed programs of work are 
required as part of the Feasibility Studies planned for the project. The work should include: 

� Metallurgical test work programs should attempt to identify preferred process streams for transition 
material. This might include defining parameters such as magnesium and/or iron cut-off grades for each 
process stream. 

� Additional bench scale testwork on representative composite samples based on the latest mine 
schedules. 

� Comprehensive leach variability testwork using samples from a range spatial pit locations, 
mineralisation types and grades throughout the deposit. This should include both HPAL and AL testing 
for the relevant mineralisation types, as well as slurry characterisation. 

� Further evaluation for upgrading of limonite by large scale scrubbing tests and continuous scrubbing 
piloting. 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 106 

 

� Continuous testwork and piloting of the total proposed circuit with recycling of intermediate streams. It is 
important that blending of composite samples for piloting reflects the amount of each mineralisation 
type in the deposit, including the three classifications of saprolite. 

22.8 Residue (Tailings) Management 

� Our review of the Scoping Study indicates that the assumptions and approach appear to be reasonable, 
with the exception of selection of an above-ground RSF. Based on the survey provided, a suitable site 
for an above-ground RSF was not considered feasible within the extent of the survey provided. 
However, a valley RSF location was identified and costed to provide a comparison price. 

� Based on our desktop study, it is recommended that an operating cost of USD10.49 per dry tonne of 
tailings, inclusive of a 25% contingency, be adopted for the PEA. Assuming a 15 year mine life at 
1.6 Mtpa, plus a 12.5% contingency, the estimated cost for residue management is estimated to be 
USD284 M. The capital cost of the residue management is USD253 M excluding the 12.5% 
contingency summarised above. Mindoro is applying a global 30% contingency on all capital costs.  

� If a suitable location for an above-ground RSF is identified, the cost per dry tonne of tailings could be 
reduced. 

22.9 Environment 

Golder considers Mindoro's environmental actions should focus on obtaining outstanding environmental 
permits. Key factors are likely to be upgrading site environmental information and corporate environmental 
management systems. Golder recommends: 

Permitting and Approvals 

� Reviewing the Philippine permitting and approvals process with respect to the new mine plan. 

� Reviewing the existing environmental information against the applicable World Bank standards and 
identify gaps. 

� Developing an environmental assessment program to address knowledge gaps in meeting both local 
and international environmental requirements. 

� Undertaking the necessary assessments and updating environmental approval documentation 
accordingly. 

Environmental Management 

� Completing an EMP for exploration activities that will provide the basis for a construction and 
subsequently operations EMP. 

� Establishing an EMS that is upgraded as the project ramps up. The EMS need not be complex at this 
stage of project development but should refer to all relevant environmental management aspects. 

22.10 Community Engagement 

� Golder recommends that more emphasis be placed on communicating the negative impacts of an 
operating mine, and associated environmental and social issues, particularly where those 
environmental impacts will directly affect current livelihoods and lifestyles. Achieving FPIC for 
operations will require evidence that indigenous people understand the potential negative impacts as 
well as potential benefits of the entire project. This means involving stakeholders in information about 
the detailed design, operations and environmental impacts as a matter of course. Golder understands 
there is a particular challenge in the Philippines to reach vulnerable or less powerful groups, where 
community leaders and more privileged persons can sometimes dominate the attention of proponents.  



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 107 

 

� Environmental and social impact assessment should also seek and incorporate community feedback as 
part of the assessment and mitigation process. The key element of this process will be providing 
feedback to stakeholders who have been consulted and responding to their concerns in a detailed and 
effective way. 

� Golder emphasises the limitations of this assessment as a preliminary desktop assessment and 
strongly recommends a comprehensive audit be conducted to accurately assess and characterise 
Mindoro's social performance to IFC standard. The scope for such an audit would include field 
assessments, interviews and a thorough analysis of documentation and reporting. 

22.11 Occupational Health and Safety 

We recommend a staged approach to the establishment of an EHS system that can be reviewed, updated 
and expanded as the project develops. The following core elements should be developed and implemented 
to assist in the management of key EHS risks for the project: 

� Health and Safety Policy 

� Fitness for Work Policy, including travel medicine and malaria risk 

� Site Access and Control Procedures, including site induction, security and travel arrangements 

� Hazard and Risk Management Procedure 

� Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure 

� Site Health and Safety Plan 

� Emergency Management Plan. 

These EHS components could be developed as standalone documents and form the basis of an EHS 
system. 

We recommend a project hazard workshop be held to inform and develop the scope of the EHS system and 
to ensure that the key risks are captured and systems are developed to manage them. 

22.12 Economic Analysis 

Golder recommend that the financial model is updated regularly as amended parameters and data comes to 
hand during the Pre-Feasibility Study. 

22.13 Risk 

Summarised in Table 22-1 are key risk factors and strategies to mitigate risk that may impact on the results 
of the economic assessment. The sensitivity analysis undertaken on the financial model has identified 
revenue assumptions as the highest risk factor in the financial performance of the Agata Project.

25.0 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

25.1 Mining Operations 

Mindoro has assumed that mining will be carried by 40-85 tonne hydraulic excavators loading 40-55 tonne 
payload articulated dump trucks. Life of Mine production rate averages 5 400 bcm per day, ramping up from 
3 400 bcm/day in the first year and peaking at 6 700 bcm per day in Year 10. Details of the mining plan are 
provided in Section 20.2. 

25.2 Recoverability 

25.2.1 General 

This PEA is based on process design criteria developed from testwork performed by SGS in Perth and mass 
balance information developed by BWHC using METSIM® software. Where the results of the SGS testwork 
were not adequately reported, data from actual operations and metallurgical test programs for similar 
South East Asian laterite ores has been used to augment the available information. The SGS data has been 
used to guide the selection of the most applicable data from other nickel laterite projects. Readers are 
cautioned that the sample sizes were limited and may not be representative of the deposit. 

25.2.2 HPAL 

SGS reported HPAL extractions of approximately 98% of the nickel and 95-96% of the cobalt from limonitic 
material within 20 minutes at a leaching temperature of 255°C. 98% nickel extraction and 96% cobalt 
extraction, at 30 minutes HPAL residence time, were adopted for the PEA, based on the SGS data. This was 
considered conservative given that the testwork indicated 98% nickel extraction was achieved in less than 
20 minutes. The selected nickel extraction is also comparable to similar South East Asian limonite ores. 

The SGS test results indicated that an acid addition rate of about 325 kg/t mineralisation was required, 
however for the PEA some low magnesium saprolite mineralisation has been included in HPAL, and 
METSIM® modelling estimated a higher acid demand of 430 kg/t for the PEA. 

25.2.3 Atmospheric Leaching  

SGS reported >97% nickel extraction and >93% cobalt extraction in AL, at acid addition rates of 
950-1000 kg/t ore, at a leaching temperature of 95°C. 97% nickel extraction and 93% cobalt extraction, at 
four hours residence time, were adopted for the PEA, based on the SGS data. Based on feeding medium 
magnesium grade saprolite to AL, METSIM® modelling estimated an acid demand of 960 kg/t for the PEA. 

25.2.4 Saprolite Neutralisation  

High nickel extraction from the saprolite mineralisation fed to SN is an important facet of the project 
economics. SGS reported SN nickel extractions in the range 79-89% and cobalt extractions of 79-93%, with 
residual free acid concentrations of 6-16 g/L, for a residence time of 6 hours. A confirmatory test produced 
extractions of 84% for nickel and 78% for cobalt, and these have been adopted for the PEA.   

25.2.5 Counter-Current Decantation 

The CCD circuit has been modelled in detail in METSIM®. Based on SGS testwork data the SN discharge 
slurry can be settled to 40% w/w solids. A declining mixing efficiency was used in the model, from 98% in 
CCD 1 to 92% in CCD 7. The modelling demonstrated that 7 CCDs were required to achieve a 99% recovery 
of soluble nickel from the feed slurry, at a wash ratio of 2.2 m

3
 per tonne of solids in CCD 7 underflow. 

The underflow % solids has by far the greatest influence on the overall recovery.   

25.2.6 Iron/Aluminium Removal 

Iron/Aluminium Removal was not tested at SGS. In Stage 1 Iron/Aluminium Removal a nickel recovery of 
99.5% has been assumed for the PEA based on the metallurgical response of similar South East Asian 
laterites. For Stage 2 Iron/Aluminium Removal a 3.0% co-precipitation of nickel has been assumed for the 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 112 

 

PEA, however the resulting solids are treated in the Recycle Leach circuit where 95% of the contained nickel 
is recovered, hence the net loss of nickel in stage 2 is less than 0.2%. 

25.2.7 Mixed Hydroxide Product 

The MHP process was not tested at SGS. In MHP Stage 1 a residual nickel concentration in solution of 
200 mg/L has been assumed for the PEA based on the typical metallurgical response for hydroxide 
precipitation using magnesium hydroxide. The remaining nickel in solution is recovered by precipitation using 
lime in MHP Stage 2, and the resulting solids are treated in the Recycle Leach circuit where 95% of the 
contained nickel is recovered, hence the net loss of nickel in MHP is minimal. For MHP Stage 2 a residual 
nickel concentration in barren solution of 5 mg/L has been assumed for the PEA, based on similar 
flowsheets. 

25.2.8 Overall Recoveries 

The estimated predicted overall metal recoveries from mineralisation for nickel and cobalt are 92.0% and 
90.5% respectively. Recoveries from individual mineralisation types are summarised in the following table: 

Table 25-1: Recoveries by Mineralisation Type 

Ore Type Nickel (%) Cobalt (%) 

Limonite 95.74 92.76 

Low Mg Saprolite 95.74 92.76 

Med Mg Saprolite 94.76 89.86 

High Mg Saprolite 82.06 75.36 

Overall 92.0 90.5 

 

Readers are cautioned that the above predicted recoveries are based on batch bench scale tests on 
samples of limited representivity. The predicted recovery data presented above will need to be confirmed in 
later stages of process development by testing with more representative samples. This will need to include 
including continuous testwork and piloting of the full process circuit including recycle streams. 

25.3 Markets 

25.3.1 Mixed Hydroxide Product 

Intermediate products of nickel are widely traded for processing in various refineries around the world. In the 
processing of laterite mineralisation using hydrometallurgical methods there are a variety of processes which 
can produce different intermediate products depending on the reagents used. The MHP product to be 
produced in the Agata Project is accepted as a suitable feed for a number of refineries. Mindoro is aware 
that the Jinchuan and the Votorantim's refinery in Sao Paolo in Brazil are prepared to accept the MHP 
product.  

The world market for nickel exceeds 1.6 Mtpa and over 60% of this is in China, Korea and Japan. There is 
also expected to be substantial growth in demand for nickel containing products in India. The estimated 
production of the project is less than 2% of world demand. There should no difficulty in placing this output in 
nearby Asian growth regions with an appropriate offtake partner.   

Mindoro will agree the required product specification with the preferred take-off partner. Mindoro will arrange 
to place its output with one or more refining companies which may not include the companies identified 
above. There is no reason to expect that this production cannot be sold at the estimated terms.  

Recent negotiations for sale of these products has resulted in metal payments for 75-80% of the nickel 
content and between 40-45% of the cobalt content. This has been on the basis that the product is sold on a 
CIF basis to the customer's port of delivery. 
 



PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AGATA NICKEL 
PROJECT 

  

May 2011 
Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 113 

 

The packaging in 2 tonne bags has been preferred with the aim to pack 10 bags into each 6 m container. As 
the likely customer is to be in China the cost of transport is expected to range between USD250-400 per 
container from main port in Mindanao. It should not be necessary to purchase containers as these will be 
supplied by the shipping company employed to transport the product to market. 

Forward prices for nickel are subject to continued review. The most authoritative summary of forecast prices 
is that published in the Metal Bulletin (April 2011). This confirms that prices around USD10 per lb are 
expected to prevail over the next four years. This price represents a fair assessment of prices that can be 
expected over the life of the project. 

Cobalt has a less established market and a price USD17 per lb is the middle of the likely price ranges for this 
metal. As it is largely a by-product metal it can be subject to sudden price changes however its demand is in 
sophisticated end uses which are not price sensitive. We confirm that this price is in the likely forecast range.  

25.4 Contracts 

Mindoro has not concluded any contracts as at the date of this PEA regarding any of the following items: the 
terms of mining, concentrating, smelting, refining, transportation, handling, sales and hedging and forward 
sales contracts or arrangements.  

Regarding the pre-feasibility study for the Agata Nickel Project, Ausenco Services Pty Ltd (Ausenco) has 
been awarded the contract to complete the process plant and utilities engineering study and 
Ausenco-Vector, also part of the Ausenco group, has been awarded the infrastructure and environment part 
of the study. 

25.5 Environment Considerations 

Mine Rehabilitation and Closure 

Mindoro are required, under Chapter XVIII of the Republic of Philippines' Department of Environment and 
Natural Resources Administrative Order Number 96-40, to provide funds for mine rehabilitation and closure. 
Table 25-2 outlines the various monetary funds that Mindoro must contribute to.

Incorporated in Operating Costs 

 

Mindoro has included the estimated cost of rehabilitation as shown in Table 25-2 in the economic evaluation.  

The funds are to ensure that mining activities are managed in a technically, financially, culturally and 
environmentally responsible manner to promote the general welfare of the country, and at the same time, to 
ensure that planning for mine rehabilitation and closure is integrated into every stage of mining operation. 

Mindoro will need to develop mine rehabilitation and closure plans throughout the life of mine with 
increasingly more accurate detail as the project moves towards the end of mining activities. Similarly Mindoro 
will need to ensure it has available funds to undertake the necessary rehabilitation and closure works in 
compliance with the regulatory requirements.

25.6 Taxes 

Income Tax: 

Life of mine income tax paid by the Agata Project is estimated at USD510 M. The detailed financial model 
has been calculated on an after tax basis which includes the following: 

� Philippines corporate tax rate 30% 

� Tax Holiday   4 years from first production.  

A conservative position has been taken on tax depreciation in which all capital is depreciated over the 
operating life of the plant. No provision has been made for accelerated depreciation which may be available 
to projects in the Philippines. 

Royalties: 

Royalties paid on gross project revenue total over the life of mine USD156 M. The estimate is based on the 
following:  

� Local Government Business Tax 2.0%  

� Indigenous Persons tax 1.5%.   

25.7 Capital Cost Estimate 

25.7.1 Capital Cost Summary 

The capital cost estimate for the proposed flow sheet was prepared by BWHC and is presented in Table 25-

The pre-development cost estimate of USD12 M was omitted  

A deferred capital amount of USD21.1 M per annum is allocated after year 6 for expansion of the residue 
storage facilities. 

The capital cost estimates are developed using the factored estimating techniques. Where applicable, an 
equipment scale-up/down and cost escalation is applied. Two factored estimating approaches are used in 
the study estimates: the model driven approach, which is applied to the direct costs and the approach that 
factors the facility cost from the total equipment cost, which is applied to the project indirect costs. 

The accuracy of the capital cost estimates are aimed at ±35%. 

25.7.2 Scope of the Capital Cost Estimate 

The scope of the Agata Nickel Project direct costs estimate includes the capital for the following: 

� process plant including mineralisation preparation, leach plant section and products section 

� major process packages such as the sulphuric acid plant, acid storage facility, limestone and lime 
plants and reagents preparation 

� utilities and services including water supply and treatment, power plant, power and air supply, plant 
control system and mobile equipment 

� process plant infrastructure including site development, process plant buildings, port facility, residue 
storage facility and unloading and storage facilities at the process plant 

� general infrastructure including roads, workforce accommodation and communications facilities. 

The indirect cost includes the following costs: 

� EPCM and vendor supervision 

� construction facilities 

� construction camp and operating expenses 

� mobile equipment operating costs 

� first fills 

� spares 

� other construction services 

� contingency.

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 116 

 

25.7.3 Basis of the Capital Cost Estimates 

The process plant costs were developed from similar nickel projects and locations compiled in the Ausenco 
Vector and BWHC databases. The applicable data were adjusted for flow or equipment capacity and 
currency movements.  

The sulphuric acid plant cost was based on a recent pricing from a western supplier for a nickel laterite 
project in the Philippines. Other major packages such as the power plant and auxiliary boilers, the limestone 
and lime plant were all based on a recent vendor quotation for a similar nickel project. 

The residue storage facility cost was based on costing calculations by Golder, adjusted to allow for staged 
construction of the storage area/s. 

The infrastructure costs were based on a nickel project in the Surigao area that has recently commenced 
construction. 

The indirect costs were prepared on the basis of a project management team being retained to perform the 
services of engineering, procurement of major equipment and management of construction. 

A contingency of 30% has been applied to direct costs. The contingency reflects the state of development of 
the project, and allows a margin for changes to the process and equipment selection and sizing where 
specific design criteria are not yet available. 

25.7.4 Capital Estimate Exclusions 

The following items have not been included in the capital estimate developed for the Project: 

� owner's costs 

� mobile mining equipment capital costs are assumed to be included in the contract mining rates 

� duties and taxes for equipment 

� technology and license fees and ongoing project support  

� EPCM assistance following introduction of feed to the plant, during commissioning and ramp up 

� an estimate of the working capital is included in the economic analysis. 

Pre-feasibility and feasibility study costs are estimated totalling USD12 M are included in the capital estimate 
but were omitted from the economic analysis. 

25.8 Operating Costs 

25.8.1 Operating Cost Summary 

Operating costs have been developed for each year of operation based on the projected project ramp-up. 
Year 3 is considered to represent full nameplate production. Annualised nickel grades are based on the mine 
production schedule (Cox 2011). 

Table 25-4 details the operating cost data for the PEA flow sheet after ramp-up in Year 3. Estimated costs 
are presented in February 2011 US dollar (USD) values. For Year 3 onwards (full nameplate capacity), the 
project operating costs are USD106 M per annum or USD2.61 per pound of nickel (excluding cobalt credits). 
The main operating cost items are sulphuric acid production, processing costs, and mining and haulage (in 
order). Operating costs (per pound of nickel) are higher in Years 1 and 2 of production due to lower metal 
production during project ramp-up, particularly Year 1 of the project.

The accuracy of the operating cost estimate is considered to be ±35%. 

More power is generated from acid plant surplus steam than the project requires. Approximately 
106 000 MWh per year of power is available for export to the grid. Mindanao is experiencing a power 
shortage and power costs are high, with diesel generator cost recoveries at PhP 7–9/kWh and long-term 
costs forecast to be PhP 12–15/kWh. After applying a credit of PhP 8/kWh (USD186/MWh) for power 
exported to the grid, the operating cost reduces to USD1.65/lb nickel for Year 3 onwards. 

Readers should note that the unit operating costs presented above are low in comparison with available 
published information from some nickel laterite operations in production. The relatively low cost of the 
proposed operations will need to be confirmed in more detailed studies. 

25.8.2 Basis of the Agata Nickel Project Operating Cost Estimates 

The operating cost estimate is based on the process mass and energy balances developed in METSIM®. 

The significant exchange rates used in the development of this estimate are: 

USD 1.0 = AUD 1.00 

USD 1.0 = PHP 44 

USD 1.0 = Euro 0.73 

Operating costs were developed for six areas: 

� mining and haulage 

� labour 

� consumables 

� maintenance materials 

� contract expenses 

� administration and general expenses.

Report No. 107641354-004-R-Rev1 118 

 

The key inputs to the operating cost development were as follows: 

� mining and haulage costs of USD8.50 per wet tonne of ore, developed by Mindoro 

� manning levels were evaluated for each project area and labour rates at different salary levels, 
including on-costs, were sourced from a database of Philippine based HR consultant's data 

� reagent and consumables quantities were based on the process mass and energy balances and unit 
pricing was sourced from both budget pricing or from data for recent projects 

� the costs of maintenance consumables, which are replacement parts necessary to maintain equipment, 
were estimated using historical ratios for similar scale plants based on the installed equipment costs 

� contract expenses were estimated for a range of services provided to the project on a contract basis, 
including: product transport and insurance, contract maintenance, periodic metallurgical testing and 
consultants fees in areas such as safety and training 

� administration and general expenses were estimated for a range of miscellaneous expenses associated 
with providing services to the project, including: insurances, safety equipment and training, medical 
costs, community relations, vehicle operating costs, environmental costs, human relations costs, 
telecommunications costs, business travel, Manila and Butuan City office costs. 

25.8.3 Operating Cost Estimate Exclusions 

There are a number of costs that have been excluded from the operating cost estimate for this PEA. These 
are outlined below: 

� sustaining capital costs are included in the capital cost 

� some government charges as yet undefined 

� royalties as yet undefined 

� corporate head offices 

� duties, customs or other imposts. 

25.9 Economic Analysis 

A financial model of the preferred development option has been prepared and the results are presented on 
an after tax and before finance basis in constant June 2011 US dollars. The model has been prepared on a 
stand-alone basis and contains no head-office or external sources of revenue or costs. Revenues and costs 
are estimated in US dollars converted from local currency where applicable at the rate of 44 Philippine peso 
to 1 USD. The final cashflow, NPV discounted at 10% and IRR are presented in Section 21.2. 

25.9.1 Economic model input parameters 

The financial model is based on the preferred development case put forward by Mindoro and following model 
parameters: 

� An HPAL, AL and Saprolite neutralisation hydrometallurgical plant processing 1.8 Mtpa of limonite and 
saprolite mineralisation to produce a nominal 18 000 t of nickel in mixed hydroxide product (MHP). 

� A pre-production and construction period of 34 month to allow sufficient time for permitting, detailed 
engineering and finance/due diligence. 

� A mining schedule, estimated on a quarterly basis which optimises the use of current resource.  Plant 
feed not processed is stockpiled.

Sustaining capital (Residue infrastructure) 173.0 

  

Total capital expenditure 1 162.8 

 

The pre-development estimated costs of USD12.0 M was omitted from the economic analysis.  

Pre-development costs include additional metallurgical drilling and testing, completion of the pre-feasibility 
and feasibility study. Direct development costs include all the process plant packages, acid plant, power 
station, residue storage and general site infrastructure. Indirect development costs include EPCM and 
construction services, temporary construction facilities and commissioning costs. A further 30% contingency 
is applied to all the installed capital costs. The total installed capital cost including pre-development is 
USD906 M. 

Sustaining capital cost equivalent to 1% of the direct installed capital is incurred annually. In addition, 
following 6 years of production, additional expenditure on tailing retention of approximately USD21.1 M per 
annum is incurred thereafter for a Life of Mine tailing retention cost of USD253m as estimated by Golders. 

Excluded from the capital cost estimate is mining fleet which is assumed to be contracted. Also excluded are 
owner's costs, Value Added Tax (VAT) and import duties as the company. 

Key assumptions which drive the operating costs are summarised in Table 25-6.

Contract mining operating costs have been estimated from similar nickel laterite mining operations in the 
Philippines. The mining cost is inclusive of fleet hire, labour cost, waste mining, stockpile rehandle, and 
haulage costs.  

Plant consumable costs have been determined on the basis of unit consumption rates as determined in 
metallurgical tests and reagent/consumable costs obtained from suppliers as at February 2011.   

Fixed, general and administration costs have been estimated on the basis of comparable Philippines 
operations and other nickel laterite operations. Indirect costs refer to compensation and land access.  

The changing operating cost over the life of mine expressed in USD per tonne of nickel in MHP produced is 
shown in Figure 25-1. The gradual rise in operating cost per tonne of nickel produced is a function of the 
falling grade.

25.9.3 Sensitivity Analysis 

Sensitivity analysis on the financial model shows that the project is robust to changes in modelling 
assumptions and has identified that the project is most sensitive to factors which impact revenue (nickel 
price, feed grade and recovery) followed by capital costs. The relative sensitivity of the project to revenue, 
capital and operating cost estimates is illustrated in Figure 25-3 and Table 25-9 below.
