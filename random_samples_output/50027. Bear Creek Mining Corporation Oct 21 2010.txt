J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  1 

1 Summary 
This Technical Report summarizes the results of an updated resource determination and a 
Feasibility Study (FS) for the Santa Ana Silver Project in Peru. This work was completed by three 
engineering companies working as a team on behalf of Bear Creek Mining Corporation (Bear 
Creek). The three companies and their responsibilities are as follows: 

• Ausenco Vector (Vector) provided design and cost estimation for the process plant, heap 
leach facilities and all infrastructure items required for project development. Vector also 
assembled the cash flow analysis of the FS, and acted as the primary author of this Technical 
Report. The preparation of this report and analysis of the data are the responsibility of Vector 
except for those areas listed below which were performed by IMC and RDI; 

• Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. (IMC) developed the estimated reserves and 
resources, mine plan, and mining costs for the FS. IMC also supervised the parts of the 
reports dealing with geology and sampling; and 

• Resource Development, Inc. (RDI) was responsible for review and interpretation of the 
process test results, development of the flow sheet, development of the process design 
criteria and the quantity of the consumable items in the process plant. 

1.1 Introduction and Executive Summary 
The results of the Feasibility Study are as follows: 

• The Santa Ana project can be in production within the second half of 2012; 

• Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves containing 63.2 million ounces of silver are currently 
defined at Santa Ana; 

• Santa Ana Project pre-tax NPV of $85.3 million at a 5% discount rate and IRR of 25.3% at 
$14.50 per ounce silver. After tax net present value of $66.5 million and IRR 21.8%; 

• 11 year mine life producing 44.2 million ounces of silver; 

• Average annual saleable silver production of 4.6 million ounces per year for the first 6 years; 

• Cash cost of $9.02 per ounce silver for the 11 years LOM; 

• Capital costs of $68.8 million with Capital Payback in 3.4 years at $14.50/oz Ag; 

• At $22.92 per ounce silver (London Silver spot price fix from October 6, 2010), the project 
would have a pre-tax IRR of 70.2% and an NPV at 5% of $341 million. On an after tax basis 
the IRR would be 52.6% and NPV $232 million; 

• At silver prices of $22.92 per ounce, free cash flow estimated at $46 million per year for the 
first 6 years with a 1.4 year pay back; 

• Numerous upside opportunities are being explored including increase of silver recovery, 
reductions in cash costs, and an extended mine life plan to include an additional 35.7 million 
ounces of silver; and 

• The Santa Ana deposit remains open, mainly at depth and to the north where the 
northernmost holes contain up to 22 meters @ 124 g/t Ag from surface.

1.2 Property Description 
The Santa Ana Project is located about 120 km south-southeast of the city of Puno, in southern 
Peru. The elevation in the deposit area varies from 4150 to 4300 meters. The deposit contains 
silver, zinc and lead mineralization. Zinc and lead mineralization is not currently considered to be 
economic because it is not recovered in the heap leach processing method utilized in this FS. This 
report focuses on the evaluation of the economic recovery of silver. 

The deposit outcrops and is roughly 1.5 km long in the north-south orientation and approximately 
0.75 wide in the east-west orientation. The deposit is best described as a high-level, low-
temperature epithermal polymetallic silver deposit hosted within volcanic units. Bear Creek controls 
5400 hectares of mineral concessions that encompass the Santa Project through claims held 100% 
by Bear Creek. 

1.3 Geology 
The Santa Ana property occupies a broad volcanic upland that lies between extensive exposures of 
thin-bedded grey lithic sandstones and red beds that underlie the volcanics to the north and south. 
The central and western portion of the upland is occupied by a sequence of fine-grained andesite 
flows that strike generally north and dip to the west at angles ranging from 15° to 45°. To the west, 
these flows are capped by coarse-grained dacitic porphyry that is, in turn, overlain unconformably 
by a thick sequence of dacitic volcanoclastic rocks. The andesite flows are the mineral hosts. 

Earlier descriptions of the mineralization described a northern Anomaly A and a southerly Anomaly 
B. Drilling has connected these zones so that they represent major structural orientations that 
contain continuous mineralization. 

The sandstones exposed to the north and south likely underlie the host volcanic field. Total 
thickness of the volcanic package is not well known. 

1.4 Resources and Reserves 
The mineral resource is based on a block model developed by IMC and a floating cone pit geometry 
that was used to assure that the resource has reasonable expectation of economic extraction. The 
FS and the reserve and resources are based on an updated resource estimation described in a 
press release dated 7 October 2010. The mine sequencing performed as part of this FS by IMC is 
based upon 60,458 meters of drilling and assays in 349 diamond drillholes and trenches completed 
through June 2010. Measured and Indicated Resources contained within the Feasibility Study 
design pit were used to determine final pit limits and thus converted respectively into Proven and 
Probable Reserves. In addition to reserves, 72.8 million ounces of silver remain in measured and 
indicated resources occurring outside of the Feasibility Study pit. Table 1.1 presents the reserves 
and resources of the Santa Ana project.

Inferred 21,632 40.6 0.32 0.49 28.2 

Note: no lead and zinc will be recovered. 

1.5 Mining Plan 
The Santa Ana deposit lends itself to development by conventional open pit hard rock mining 
techniques. Consequently, a floating cone computer algorithm was applied to the block model to 
establish the mineral resource component of the block model. Economic value was applied to silver 
only with a metal sales price of $13.00/troy oz. resulting in a variable cut-off grade of between 24 
and 27 g/t silver. No economic consideration has been applied to lead or zinc; however, a slight 
benefit is realized through by-product gold recovery. 

The mining plan was developed by IMC. The mine plan was developed using conventional open pit 
methods using 63t trucks and 8.6 m3 wheel loaders mining on 5 m high benches. The mine requires 
minimal pre-production waste stripping of 2.97 million tonnes. During the life of the project the 
overall stripping ratio will 1.96:1 (Waste:Ore). For the first nine and a half years of the operation, ore 
will be directly shipped from the pit to the crusher where the trucks will dump the ore directly into the 
crushing system. After crushing the ore will be loaded using an automated conveyor loading system 
and then be hauled to the heap leach where the ore will be placed in cells and leached using weak 
cyanide solution. In addition to the direct dump ore, the mining plan calls for a low-grade stockpile to 
be built up in the first 5 years of the mining. The low-grade stockpile will contain 2,964 kt of ore 
having an average grade of 29.9 g/t. The low-grade stockpile will be fed through the crusher once 
the main mining activity has ceased. Waste will be hauled to a single waste storage facility located 
approximately 1 km southwest of the pit. 

The plan for the operation of the mine is to use a contract miner. IMC developed mining costs of 
$1.68 per tonne of material mined (ore and waste) and $0.71 per tonne for the rehandling of the 
crushed ore onto the heap leach. Separate budgetary quotes were received from local mining 
contractors and closely matched the detailed estimate prepared by IMC.

1.6 Metallurgy 
Six column leach test have been completed at McClelland Labs and over one-hundred leach 
amenability tests. The results have consistently demonstrated that the Santa Ana ore responds well 
to conventional heap leaching techniques. The overall recovery is expected to be 70% silver for 
minus ¾-inch crushed material. More recent column tests indicate that further improvements in 
recovery to 75 percent silver can be achieved by crushing the ore to minus 3/8-inch. McClelland 
Laboratories is currently performing a column test on minus 3/8-inch crushed material and the 
Company will release the results when this long-term test is finished. Initial results strongly indicate 
an improvement in recovery and acceleration of the silver leaching. 

1.7 Processing 
Santa Ana is an epithermal polymetallic deposit hosted within volcanic rocks with significant 
quantities of primary silver. Considering its proximity to the surface, the ore will be mined in an open 
pit operation. 

The main operations are blasting, ore transportation to the crushing plant which will comprise two 
crushing stages and one classification stage, heap leaching and recovery by Merrill-Crowe 
extraction.

Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  6 

The crushed ore, 80 percent passing 19mm (¾-inch) will be conveyed to the coarse ore stockpile 
with a live capacity of approximately 6 hrs. The reclaim system will consist of one fixed conveyor 
stockpile to withdraw material from the stockpile and deliver onto trucks. Trucks will be used to 
transport the ore from the crushed ore stockpile to the heap leach pad. A sodium cyanide solution 
will be irrigated on the heap to dissolve silver minerals and the pregnant solution will be sent to the 
Merrill-Crowe plant to produce a silver-zinc precipitate, which will be smelted to produce a Dore bar 
containing mainly silver. 

The operation will treat 10,000 tpd and the estimated life of mine is 11.3 years. The design 
considers a heap leaching process and the average silver content is 53 g/t. The metallurgical 
recovery of silver by the leaching process is 70% with a 360 day leach recovery cycle. The leach 
cycle is divided into a 120 day primary leach and a 240 day secondary leach occurring in the lower 
levels of the heap. 

The estimated monthly production is 306,255 ounces of silver. 

The Merrill-Crowe plant was designed to treat 571 m3/hr of pregnant solution in order to assure the 
production mentioned above. The design includes an effluent detoxification plant to treat 120 m3/hr 
of solution with low cyanide content. This detoxification plant will only operate under special 
circumstances such as excess of barren solution produced during the rainy season. 

The estimated installed power is 3,547 kW, the maximum draw power is 1,683 kW and the 
estimated critical consumption is 1,445 kW. The estimated power consumption is 1,132,027 kW-hr 
per month. Emergency backup will be provided by diesel generators of 1,500 kW of continuous 
service at 4,000 meters above sea level. This equipment will assure the operation of equipment 
critical to the metallurgical process. 

The requirement of water for the operation is approximately 3.86 litres per second during the first 
year of operation. If the leaching operation starts in the dry season (May to September), the 
requirement of water will be higher. The opposite will occur during the wet season (November to 
April). At the start of operations, the storm water pond should contain no less than 42,000 m3 of 
water. When the rainy season starts, it will be important to collect the rain water through the leach 
pad. 

The estimated direct cost of the investment for processing is US$ 12,359,000 million and the 
indirect cost is US$ 2,740,000 million. The total cost of the investment (Capex) is US$ 15,009,000 
million. The details of the capital cost estimate are presented in Section 23.9. The estimated 
operating cost of the process is 2.644 dollars per tonne of ore processed or 1.186 dollars per ounce 
of silver. The details of the operating cost estimate are presented in Section 23.9. 

1.8 Infrastructure 
The project has favourable infrastructure. Access will be via a good 8 km gravel road that will be a 
combination of a new and improved roads requiring mostly upgrading. The new road will connect to 
the existing paved highway connecting the Bolivian border to the port of Ilo, Peru. The mine is 42 
km from an electrical substation at Pomata and the project includes building a transmission line to 
the mine. The project has an excellent site for the heap leach pad resulting in a low capital and 
operating cost as the plant will be located immediately adjacent to the heap leach pad and ponds. 
The site is close to a very large alluvial aquifer that is replenished by a flowing river in the valley; 
wells have been drilled in the aquifer and sufficient water is available to provide water for the mine's 
needs. Steps are being taken to acquire the necessary permits for water use. A 12 km pipeline from 
the wells to the mine will be built to transport the water.

1.9 Environmental, Permitting and Closure 
The project has been designed to meet industry standards of environmental compliance. The heap 
leach and solution ponds have been designed industry standards of containment and stability. The 
waste rock storage facilities are designed to capture and manage any flows that may originate from 
the waste rock. Finally an initial closure plan has been developed that will provide covers the both 
the heap leach and waste rock facilities that will result in safe and environmentally compliant 
closure of the mine. The lab tests on spent ore and waste rock have shown that the site has a very 
low potential to produce acid rock drainage (ARD). 

The Company is currently advancing the permitting process and expects to submit the 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to the Peruvian authorities before the end of 
2010. All additional necessary permitting will be processed once the ESIA has been approved by 
the national government. 

The Company has maintained good working relationships with the local communities.  

1.10 Project Execution 
The project is expected to be developed into a mine over the next 24 months. The figure below 
illustrates the major parts of the development plan. First the company expects to present the ESIA 
to the Peruvian authorities prior to the end of 2010. There will then be a period of review by the 
government that is expected to last 6 to 9 months. In late 2010 and early 2011, the detailed project 
engineering is expected to commence and is estimated to be completed in approximately 9 months. 
Following ESIA approval the Company is expected to advance the permitting process by obtaining 
the necessary construction and operating permits. In late 2011, once the proper permits are 
obtained, the principal off-site project infrastructure is expected to be developed. This will include 
the power line, the upgrading of the access road, the construction of the water supply pipeline and 
drilling of any additional production water wells. Any temporary construction housing will be installed 
in preparation for the on-site construction. Finally, the onsite construction is expected to start in the 
2nd quarter of 2012, or earlier depending on the end of the rainy season and continue through the 
dry season. Commercial production is expected to start in early part of the fourth quarter of 2012, or 
earlier if the rainy season permits liner installation sooner.

1.11 Operating Cost Estimate 
Mining costs were prepared on a year-by-year basis with costs varying mostly due to changing 
haulage distances. The life-of-mine average mining costs will be $1.68 per tonne of the total 
material moved. The cost for hauling and placing ore on the pad will be $0.71 per tonne. The 
process costs are estimated to be $3.19 per tonne of processed ore and the G&A is estimated to be 
$1.17 per processed tonne or $4.2 million per year. The average life-of-mine, on site operating cost 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  8 

per ounce of silver will be $8.35. Including refining charges, doré transport and Peruvian production 
royalties, the average cash cost per ounce will be $9.02. 

1.12 Capital Cost Estimate 
The project capital cost estimate has been prepared by two independent engineering companies. 
The mining costs were prepared by Independent Mining Consultants of Tucson, Arizona, and the 
process heap leach and infrastructure costs have been prepared by Ausenco Vector of Peru. The 
initial start up capital is estimated to be $68.8 million and the total life of mine capital cost is 
estimated to be $83.8 million. The initial capital equates to $1.56 per ounce of silver recovered. The 
life of mine capital costs used in the financial model includes detailed long-term plans for heap 
leach expansions as well as ongoing mine closure and monitoring. Sustaining capital expenditures 
are estimated at an average $1.4 million per year over the 11-year life of the mine. 

Tabulated below are the Capital costs for each of the principal areas. 

Table 1.4 
Capital Cost Summary 

Item Cost 
Civil Works $13,598,000 
Water Supply $3,215,000 
Process Plant $15,099,000 
Auxiliary Facilities $5,859,000 
Water Distribution $2,403,000 
Electrical (LT & Distribution) $9,709,000 
Crusher System $4,763,000 
Preproduction Mine Development & Equipment $9,909,000 
Owners Costs $4,226,000 
Total Initial Capital $68,781,000 

 

The estimates of the Capital Costs have been prepared to a feasibility level with a 15% contingency 
applied to the estimates. An additional 15% has been added for Engineering Procurement and 
Construction Management (EPCM). 

1.13 Economic Analysis 
The project has a pre-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 25.3%, a net present value of $85.3 million 
at a 5% discount rate and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 
of $144 million over the 11-year life based upon $14.50 per ounce silver. Recovered silver 
production in the first six years averages 4.6 million ounces per year and the project is expected to 
produce an average of 4.0 million payable ounces of silver per year over the 11-year mine-life. 
Based upon a $14.50 silver price, the project achieves payback of capital in approximately 3.4 
years. The Feasibility Study has been prepared using cost bids and estimates and production 
forecasts provided by qualified engineering consulting groups who have recent bids and cost 
structure experience relating to various Peruvian mining projects under development. 

The project is sensitive to metal price and recovery. Additionally, given that the cash costs per 
ounce are $9.02 per ounce of silver, the project is also sensitive to variations in operating costs. 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  9 

The project is least sensitive to capital cost variations and this can be explained by the relatively low 
cost of $1.56 per produced ounce for the initial capital. 

Sensitivities to various parameters are summarized below: 

Table 1.5 
Cost Sensitivities 

Case IRR NPV @ 5% NPV @ 0% 
Base Case 25% $85.3M $143.6M 
Recovery +10% 34% $127.4M $203.5M 
Recovery -10% 16% $43.1M $83.5M

Operating Cost +10% 20% $59.1M $106.6M 
Operating Cost -10% 31% $111.5M $180.5M 
Metal Prices Oct. 6, 2010 - $22.92/oz Ag 70% $341.1M $508.0M 

Note: 
Base case price is $14.50/oz Silver; London Silver spot price fix from October 6, 2010 = $22.92/oz Ag .All values are pre-tax. 

1.14 Opportunities 
The study has identified areas of opportunities that will be analysed immediately in detailed 
engineering, column leach test work and future exploration: 

1.14.1 Organic Growth 
The Feasibility Study leaves 36 million ounces of measured and indicated silver resources in either 
stockpiles or pit walls that can lead to expanded mine life on the order of 50%. Relatively minor 
additional capital will be required in order to increase the size of the heap leach pad and waste 
dump sites for which there is ample area for expansions (see Sections 23.4.5 and 23.12.3).  

1.14.2 Exploration Upside 
The deposit is still open at depth, to the north and northwest, and the "North" anomaly is under-
explored. 

1.14.3 Enhanced Silver Recovery 
Analysis of the recently completed column leach studies indicates that higher recoveries are likely 
with a slightly finer crush size. At 80% passing 3/8 inch crush size the anticipated recovery is 75% 
of the silver and initial results from test work indicate the speed of silver recovery is greatly 
improved. 

1.14.4 Operating Cost Reductions 
The project is sensitive to operating costs. The Company and its consultants believe that, once the 
project is in operation, many of the reagent consumption levels used in the Feasibility Study will be 
reduced with a beneficial effect on the operating costs. Additionally, assuming that a finer crush size 
is chosen, there is potential to reduce the cash costs by $0.30 to $0.40 per ounce resulting from

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  10 

accelerated silver leaching rates and increased recoveries. Details of the finer crushing potentials 
are provided in Section 23.10.1. 

1.15 Conclusions & Recommendations 
This Report recommends proceeding with detailed engineering and permitting based on: 

• Positive economics with excellent exposure to up-side silver prices; 

• Well-defined resources open to expansion and potential conversion to reserves; 

• Favourable infrastructure; heap leach, power and access; 

• Available local water supply; 

• Well-defined permitting path; and 

• Local community acceptance. 

The study has identified areas of opportunities that will be analysed in ongoing engineering studies 
and test work: 

• Reduce the crush size to minus 3/8" to improve silver recovery and leaching rate; 

• Investigate reducing the process plant footprint to reduce capital costs; and 

• As the sensitivity analysis shows, the project is sensitive to operating costs. BCM and its 
consultants will explore opportunities for reducing operating costs mainly through reducing 
reagent consumption both in ongoing leaching tests and after operations start-up.

3 Reliance on Other Experts 
Project coordination and communication was the responsibility of Marc Leduc, Chief Operating 
Officer for Bear Creek Mining who is also a qualified person under the definitions within 
NI 43-101. 

Bear Creek Mining Corp. has provided much of the information regarding the project property 
situation as well as background information on the property. Where possible, the authors have 
confirmed information provided by Bear Creek or previous authors by comparison against other 
data sources or by field observation. Where checks and confirmations are not possible, the authors 
have assumed that all information supplied is complete and reliable within normally accepted limits 
of error. During the normal course of the work, we have not discovered any reason to doubt that 
assumption. 

Vector has not specifically reviewed or audited the property ownership documents at Santa Ana. 
Vector has relied on the opinion of Peruvian legal counsel to Bear Creek Mining. Estudio Grau 
Abogados provided a letter dated 19 October 2010 to Bear Creek Mining outlining the property 
ownership at Santa Ana and signed by Juan Carlos Escuder (partner), and Edgardo Portaro 
(Associate) which has been reviewed by Vector as support to the information provided in Section 4.

4 Property Description and Location 
The Santa Ana Property is located approximately 45 km west of Desaguadero, a small city located 
near the Bolivian – Peruvian border southwest of Lake Titicaca. Santa Ana is 120 km south of the 
much larger city of Puno in the Department of Puno in south-eastern Peru. 

The Santa Ana property covers an area of 5,400 hectares in an area to the south of the village of 
Huacullani. The approximate UTM grid coordinates for the centre of the main portion of the property 
are 8,158,000 m North and 466,000 m East using the Prov. S. Am '56 map datum (zone 19). 

The property consists of six claims: the Karina 9-A, Karina 1, Karina 2, Karina 5, Karina 6 and 
Karina 7. Bear Creek has executed its option to acquire 100% interest in the six mineral claims 
which comprises 5,400 hectares. The claims were subject to payments under a finder's fee 
agreement to a Peruvian individual of which $15,000 was paid upon receipt of title and $15,000 was 
paid upon initiation of drilling. In addition, in accordance with the finder's fee agreement, the 
property is subject to a 3% payment of the direct exploration expenditures to a maximum payment 
of $280,000. 

The mineral titles were held on behalf of the Company by a third party. The Company initiated a 
process to transfer the titles to its name under a Supreme Decree, whereby a foreign controlled 
entity, such as Bear Creek Mining Corporation, can hold title to mineral rights located within the 50 
kilometre border zone of Peru. The Company made a total payment of $7,000 to the third party 
upon transfer of title. This process was completed late in 2007 and the company now holds clear 
title to the claims. Table 4.1 presents a list of the claims and their sizes.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Access 
Access to the property is obtained by driving west 44 km from Desaguadero on paved and gravel 
roads to the village of Huacullani, then south on a good dirt road another 4.9 km to the project site. 
In good weather, two-wheel drive vehicles can easily access the property; off road or wet weather 
travel requires four-wheel drive vehicles. 

5.2 Climate 
The climate of the region is typical of the high Andes of Peru. There is a pronounced dry season 
with little precipitation from May through September and a pronounced wet season from January 
through March. The temperatures are mild with average daytime high temperature above freezing. 
Occasionally, the overnight temperatures drop below freezing. 

There are no climatic conditions that would cause the project great operational difficulty. The largest 
concern will be managing stormwater but this is a concern at all mine sites and can be managed 
with proper controls. 

Vegetation is primarily the stiff bunch grass found at these altitudes in the Andes. Trees are nearly 
absent. 

The property lies within a volcanic upland to the south of Huacullani. Elevations generally vary from 
4150 to 4300 meters above mean sea level. A stream flows through the broad valley east of the 
deposit, which might be developed to provide some of the water requirements for mining and 
processing. 

5.3 Local Resources 
Local resources are beneficial for resource projects. Huacullani is a small provincial town with small 
scale farming as the primary economic activity. Local farming is mostly limited to growing of market 
vegetables (potatoes and corn) and the herding of sheep, alpaca and cattle. The recently utilized 
exploration labour force came from the nearby communities. There is no history of mining in the 
area during the recent past. 

5.4 Infrastructure 
Infrastructure is in-place for mine development with a good paved highway 8 km north of the 
project. Water for mining operations could be obtained from a large river located 10 km to the north 
of the project (next to the paved highway). Power for exploration was supplied by generators but for 
a mining operation a power line will be constructed and connected to the national grid at the sub-
station located in Pomata (43 km to the northeast). 

The project area has a moderate topography so the construction of site access roads is easy 
compared to other projects in Peru where there is more severe topography.  

There is only one small structure within the project property and the exploration group used it during 
the drilling phase for offices and accommodations. The mine development plan describes 
installation of all new site infrastructure for the project.

5.5 Physiography 
The physiographic features are moderate to gentle and access is easy to all parts of the project 
either by 4x4 truck or on foot. The project is located at the top of a mesa shaped mountain with the 
top of the mesa forming a gentle bowl shape. The sides of the mesa are more rugged than the 
project site: consequently, the access road from Huacullani to the top of the mesa is more sinuous 
and steeper than other roads in the area. The project is located at the 4200 meter elevation on 
average.

6 History 
Bear Creek Mining Corporation became aware of old Colonial workings on the Santa Ana property 
and began a concerted exploration campaign during the second half of 2004. Otherwise, little is 
known of the exploration history of the property. The Spanish in the Colonial era had a modest, vein 
mining and exploration operation here with most of the workings concentrated at the southern end 
of the deposit.

7 Geologic Setting 
The Santa Ana property occupies a broad volcanic upland that lies between extensive exposures of 
thin-bedded gray lithic sandstones and red beds of the Puno group (Cretaceous to lower-Tertiary) 
that underlie both Huacullani and the region to the south of the ore body. The central and western 
portion of the upland is occupied by a sequence of fine-grained andesite flows and autobreccias 
that possibly belong to the Tertiary Tacaza group, strike generally north or northeast and dip to the 
west at angles ranging from 15° to 60°. To the west these Tertiary flows are capped by a coarse-
grained dacitic porphyry that, in turn, is overlain unconformably by a thick sequence of Miocene- 
Pliocene dacitic volcanoclastic rocks. The andesite flows, autobreccias and dacitic porphyry are the 
mineral hosts. 

Earlier descriptions of the mineralization described a northern Anomaly A and a southerly Anomaly 
B. Recent drilling has connected these zones so that they represent major structural orientations 
that contain continuous mineralization. 

The andesite volcanic unit host the mineralization including veins and bulk tonnage material. 
Quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusives host minor mineralization in the northern Anomaly B and in the 
canyon south of Huacullani. The best evidence of attitude in the andesite rocks is the ledges of 
outcrop that, from a distance, appear to be flows striking north-northeast and dip west at 15° to 60°. 
This attitude would be in general accord with the attitude of some overlying flows observed to the 
west.  

Presumably, the sandstones exposed to the north and south underlie the host volcanic field in the 
central part of Anomaly B. Total thickness of the volcanic package is not well defined.

8 Deposit Types 
The Santa Ana deposit is typical of intermediate-sulfidation polymetallic silver-bearing vein and 
stockwork deposits that, although epithermal, represent mineralization both laterally and vertically 
distal to an intrusive source rather than the shallow, very high-level mineralization commonly 
associated with hot springs systems. 

These kinds of deposits are typically distal to porphyry copper systems and characterized by quartz, 
galena, sphalerite, pyrite, magnetite-pyrite, minor chalcopyrite and rhodochrosite mineralization in 
the sulfide zone with variable amounts of silver, generally in the form of argentite. Barite is locally 
abundant occurring as an important gangue mineral.  

Depending on the host rocks available, these deposits occur as discreet veins, brecciated bodies, 
stockwork systems, or replacement deposits (in calcareous rocks). The oxidized portions of these 
deposits generally contain cerrusite, abundant manganese wad or other manganese oxides, 
abundant iron oxides and small amounts of argentite and cerargyrite. Both oxide and sulfide zones 
commonly contain economic mineralization in typical deposits of this type.

9 Mineralization 

9.1 General 
The majority of mineralization is within two major structural trends and hosted within the andesite 
unit. Both vein and disseminated mineralization occur within these trends, with higher grade 
associated within veins, vein swarms, breccias and open space fillings. 

Brecciation associated within the broad structural zones are thought to be tectonic in origin, with 
occasional overprints of hydrothermal brecciation.  

The host rock has been described as primarily volcanic andesites with minor dykes and intrusive. 
XMOD analysis of 12 drillholes describes K-feldspars as the predominant gangue mineral, followed 
by illite and chlorite. The quartz content is low at less than 10%. The carbonate content is less than 
5%. 

Figure 9.1 is a thickness map of plus 20g/t silver at Santa Ana. The north-south trend of the 
northern two thirds of the deposit can be seen on this map. The southern third of the deposit is 
generally oriented north-easterly. This appears to be caused by a flexure in the structure where it 
bends to the west. 

Figure 9.2 is an east-west cross section through the southern portion of the deposit, and 
Figure 9.3 is an east-west section through the northern portion of the deposit. Both sections 
illustrate the generally vertical character of the mineralization. 

Higher grade zones within the deposit are ubiquitous but are not particularly continuous. The 
percentage of high grade (plus 200g) intercepts is relatively constant from drillhole to drillhole, but 
the continuity of those zones is spatially limited. 

9.2 SEM 
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study of 12 drillholes identifies argentite as the predominate 
silver mineralization. Argentite accounts for 85% of the total silver in the samples. Arsenopolybasite 
(AgCu)16 As2S11 and McKinstyrite (AgCu)2S were identified as the other silver bearing minerals in 
the study. Native silver was identified in one sample as a microscopic inclusion in barite. The zinc 
sulfide mineral sphalerite and the lead mineral galena were free of included silver. 

The silver mineralization was mostly associated with goethite and pyrite. 

The relative order of cyanide solubility of the silver mineralization is: 

• Mineral   Solubility 

• Argentite  90% 

• McKinstyrite  ±60% 

• Arsenopolybasite ±40% 

The SEM study indicates low levels of cyanocide minerals. The cyanocide minerals are covellite 
and the manganese oxide sulfosalts.

10 Exploration 
Bear Creek conducted exploration activities since mid-2004 at Santa Ana. Drilling finished in May 
2010. Drilling activities are summarized in Section 11. 

Exploration work at Santa Ana included detailed surface mapping, sampling of outcrops, hand 
trenching with channel sampling, geophysics, and diamond drilling. Surface trench data has not 
been used in the estimation of the resource, but was used as an exploration guide for drill site 
selection. 

Bear Creek is unaware of exploration efforts on the property prior to its work in the district. Local 
prospectors and Colonial Spanish workings may have been the only prior work on the site.

11 Drilling 
Bear Creek has utilized HQ-size diamond core drilling methods for all drillhole sampling at Santa 
Ana. The drilling contractor, Bradley, utilized LD- 250 skid mounted drills. Most completed drillholes 
consisted of 70-degree angle holes at Santa Ana in order to cross cut the near vertical 
mineralization. 

Drillhole collar surveys were completed using hand held GPS units, with an accuracy of ±3 meters, 
and then followed up with a survey by a total station with three geodesic points of order "B" located 
on the property from the closest IGN (Geographic National Institute) point on the Peruvian national 
grid. Down hole surveys were not completed in the exploration holes. The orientation of each 
exploration drillhole is based on the orientation of the drill mast. 

In addition to the exploration borings, thirteen geotechnical, oriented core holes were completed. 
Downhole surveying was completed within each geotechnical, oriented core boring indicating a 
deviation of 1 to 2 degrees.  

Drillhole collars are currently abandoned with a concrete marker with pertinent drill data inscribed 
on the marker at the collar. 

As of June 2010, the following drilling information was completed, including logs and assays. IMC 
received the data for the determination of this resource. 

Santa Ana Drill Data as of June 2010 

• 349  drillholes 

• 60,143.1 meters of drilling 

• 28,694  assay intervals 

• 28,694  intervals assayed for silver, zinc, lead, and copper. 

New holes added to the Santa Ana database since February 2009 

• 43  drillholes 

• 4,567.85 meters of drilling 

• 1,978  assay intervals 

• 1,978  intervals assayed for silver, zinc, lead, and copper. 

Drill core is logged and split at site. Half core is transported to a commercial sample preparation lab 
as outlined in Section 12 on sampling method and approach. 

Figure 11.1 presents a drillhole location map for Santa Ana as of June 2010. The holes coloured 
blue were available in the February 2009 database. Holes plotted in red were added between 
February 2009 and June 2010. The plot outline also represents the physical size of the block model 
assembled for the current resource estimates.

The drilling at Santa Ana is of sufficient density and of proper orientation to support the estimation 
of resources as reported in Section 17.0. True thickness and grade of the mineralization is defined 
by multiple holes at Santa Ana due to the bulk character of the deposit. The true thickness Santa 
Ana is the overall width and depth of the deposit which is in the range of 300 to 500m.

12 Sampling Method and Approach 
All mineral sampling for determination of economic resources was collected from HQ-size diamond 
drill core. The core is logged and split on site. Split core is then delivered to a commercial lab for 
preparation. 

Drill sampling is typically completed on two meter intervals, as marked by Bear Creek field 
geologists. Core is split in half using manual mechanical core splitters and half-core is returned to 
the core boxes. Bear Creek staff then collect each half split 2-meter core sample interval and mark 
the samples using duplicate sample tag: one tag in the sample bag, and the other sample tag 
retained and recorded with the drillhole designation and interval sampled. The assay lab, therefore, 
has the sample tag number, but does not have the drillhole ID designation or sample interval for any 
of the samples. Samples are bagged by Bear Creek personnel and are transported by a vehicle 
driven by Bear Creek employees from the Santa Ana camp site to Puno for shipment by the Cruz 
del Sur bus line from Puno to Lima, Peru. The analytical lab, ALS Chemex, picks up the samples at 
the bus station for transport to the lab in Lima, where the samples are prepared for analysis. 

Bear Creek has implemented a procedure for determination of sample density. Whole core samples 
are weighed on site before sample splitting. Core samples are subsequently air dried and weighed 
in air. Then the samples are coated with paraffin and weighed in air again. Finally the samples are 
immersed in water and the water displacement is measured. 

As of June 2010, Bear Creek completed 843 density determinations. Most of the samples represent 
the andesite rock unit, with a few dykes, post mineralized rock and sedimentary units represented in 
the 843 samples. The average dry density of all 814 mineralized andesite samples was 2.47, and 
the average dry density for all 30 post mineralized and sedimentary samples was 2.18. 

Results presented in this report include all available density data to date. 

The sampling method applied by Bear Creek is reliable due to the use of large diameter drill core. 
The method is not susceptible to the impacts of ground water inflows and down hole contamination 
as are other drilling procedures. Core recoveries are good and their does not appear to be any 
drilling related factors that could affect the reliability of the results.

13 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 
The analytical laboratory, ALS-Chemex performs sample preparation and analyses at its facilities in 
Lima, Peru. The laboratory is located at Calle 1 LT-1A Mz-D, esq. Calle A, Urb. Industrial 
Bocanegra, Callao 01, Lima, Peru. ALS Chemex is an internationally known analytical laboratory 
commonly used by the mining industry. ALS Chemex has been the primary lab for all of Bear 
Creek's analytical results for the Santa Ana Project. 

Half core samples are retrieved at the Lima bus station by ALS-Chemex personnel and logged into 
the ALS-Chemex tracing system for preparation and assay.  

Samples are crushed and pulverized to create a sample pulp, using standard crushing and 
pulverizing equipment and procedures. Samples are first dried at 110-120°C and then crushed with 
either an oscillating jaw crusher or a roll crusher. The ALS-Chemex procedure for crushed material 
is that more than 70 percent of the sample must pass a 2mm (#10 mesh) screen. The entire sample 
is crushed, and a portion, typically 250g, is subdivided for pulverizing using a rifle splitter. The 
remainder of the crushed material, the coarse reject, is returned to Bear Creek for storage. The split 
portion derived from the crushing process is pulverized using a ring mill. The ALS Chemex 
procedure is to pulverize the sample such that more than 85 percent of the sample is finer than 75 
microns (#200 mesh); producing a sample pulp. A portion of the sample pulp is used in the sample 
digestion and analytical process to achieve and assay result. 

As a result of the data review and verification discussed in this section and the following section, 
IMC and John Marek (qualified person for mineral reserves and mineral resources) have formed the 
opinion that the Santa Ana sample preparation, analysis, and security have resulted in a data base 
that is reliable for the estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources as described in Section 
17.0. 

13.1 Analytical Procedure 
Bear Creek selected the ore-grade acid digestion with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) AAS 
finish as the analytical method (ALS code AA62b) for the mineralization at Santa Ana. The ore-
grade digestion is a three-acid digestion procedure using hydrofluoric, nitric, and perchloric acids for 
maximum digestion of the sample. This method, followed by hydrochloric acid leach and AAS 
analysis, will provide accurate silver analyses in the range of 1.0 to 1,000 g/t Ag. 

Similar methods of ore-grade digestion are used for the lead, zinc, and copper analyses. ICP 
methods are used for determining gold and other trace elements. When higher gold values are 
anticipated, gold values are also determined using fire-assay preparation and AAS finish. 

13.2 Quality Control Procedures (QA/QC) 
A QA/QC program to verify consistency of analytical results has been in place since Bear Creek 
started work at Santa Ana. The QA/QC procedures are summarized below and discussed in more 
detail in the following paragraphs. 

• Certified standards and blanks are periodically inserted by Bear Creek personnel in the 
sample submission stream to ALS Chemex; 

• Check assays on pulps are submitted to a third party lab; and 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  31 

• The remaining half core samples from every 50th core box are resampled and sent to the 
ALS-Chemex lab as a check on sample preparation procedures. 

Standards are inserted in sequence with the regular rock samples from half-split core. Since the 
inserted sample standards are pulps rather than rock, the analytical lab is aware that they are 
QA/QC samples; however, the lab does not know whether they are standards, blanks, or re-runs of 
former pulps. Bear Creek inserts one of six standard sample pulps, selected randomly, with every 
20 regular samples. The sample standards have been prepared by one of three laboratories: 
RockLabs Australia, CIMM Labs Lima, or by Inspectorate Labs Lima. CIMM and Inspectorate are 
internationally known analytical labs that service the mining industry, and have an assay lab in 
Lima, Peru. Rock Labs is an internationally known provider of sample standards to the mining 
industry. 

Typically two to five standards have been inserted into the sample stream for each drillhole 
completed to date. Bear Creek tracks the reported assay of the standards with the mid-point of the 
known range, and triggers a possible re-assay of sample batches for which the difference between 
the two values is greater than +/- 10% or 2 times the standard deviation. This event has occurred a 
few times during the project life. The final decision on sample reassays also considers the real 
difference between the standard assay and the known mid-point. For example, a standard assay of 
2.0 g/t Ag for a mid-point of 1.2 g/t Ag, while a difference of 167%, is not statistically sufficient to 
trigger a reassay of a sample batch. Should re-assays of a sample batch and standard be required, 
the corrected assays are input into the database. This procedure assures consistency of assays 
from ALS-Chemex.  

Blanks are inserted in the sample stream as part of the standards insertion process. Some of the 
early "blanks" were actually low-grade standards of approximately 1 g/t. Recent "blanks" from 
RockLabs are indeed certified values of 0.0. Drillholes added since July 2008 tend to have one 
"blank" per hole as part of the standards submission. 

Check assays are completed by sending splits from prepared pulps to a third party laboratory to 
rerun the assay. Roughly 1 out of every 10 pulps has a portion separated and sent to the 
Inspectorate Assay Laboratory in Lima for an independent re-assay of the pulp. 

Starting in late 2007, Bear Creek initiated a program of half core preparation and assaying by 
retrieving the last full 2 meter core interval from every 50th core bock. The remaining half core after 
sampling is bagged and shipped to ALS-Chemex for preparation and assay as a check on the 
original half sample preparation and assay. 

Bear Creek also retrieves the full and complete internal ALS-Chemex QA/QC data as an additional 
check on the consistency of the assays received from that lab. 

Assay results from ALS-Chemex are received electronically for incorporation into the database. The 
electronic transfer process helps to minimize data entry errors into the database. Bear Creek also 
verifies the electronic data against the hard copy certificates of assay also provided by ALS-
Chemex. 

13.3 Sample Security 
Bear Creek maintains control of the surface and drillhole samples from the drill rig to delivery of 
individually sealed samples in sealed shipping sacks at the bus depot in Puno for transport to the 
assay lab. Bear Creek retains the pulps and coarse rejects from the Santa Ana drillhole samples at 
its secure warehouse in Lima and retains the boxed half-core at a secure storage warehouse in 
Puno.

14 Data Verification 
IMC completed the following tasks as part of the due diligence data verification of the Santa Ana 
project: 

• Comparison of the June 2010 database against the previously provided February 2009 data; 

• Spot check of the July 2008 certificates of assay versus the assay information recorded in the 
February 2009 database; 

• Analysis of blanks and standards results for both 2009 and 2010 data bases; 

• Analysis of pulp check assays for both 2009 and 2010 data bases; and 

• Half core duplicate assays analysis based on February 2009 drilling. 

As a result of the tasks completed above, IMC holds the opinion that the database can be used for 
the determination of mineral reserves and mineral resources. 

14.1 Review of the Incremental Data collected between March 2009 and June 2010 
The comparison of the recent June 2010 data set versus the previous February 2009 database 
indicated that 43 new drillholes totalling 4,568 meters of drilling with 1,978 assay intervals were 
added to the database.  

In June 2010 IMC received updated topography for the Santa Ana deposit. The new topographic 
survey was conducted by a company called Digital Globe, based in Longmont, Colorado, USA. The 
updated topography was done in the PSAD _19S system and was supplied to IMC as contour data. 
The updated topography is used both in the June 2010 database and block model. 

IMC checked the drillhole collars versus the topographic information listed above and found them to 
be consistent. 

IMC has focused on the verification of silver in this report as that is the only metal for which there 
will be economic credit. Bear Creek does maintain an appropriate QA/QC program on the contained 
zinc and lead at Santa Ana. 

14.2 Certificate Check 
IMC selected 10 drillholes from the February 2009 database for detailed comparison of the paper 
certificate of assay versus the electronic database. The certificates of assay for these 10 holes were 
transferred to IMC as PDF files via email communication with Bear Creek personnel. The 10 holes 
were selected by IMC, as follows: 

DDH-SA-8  DDH-SA-26  DDH-SA-50  DDH-SA-135 

DDH-SA-168  DDH-SA-172  DDH-SA-176  DDH-SA-180 

DDH-SA-191  DDH-SA-197 

Assay Certificate data for silver, copper, lead and zinc from ALS Chemex was entered by IMC 
personnel and this data was checked against the data in the drillhole database provided by Bear 
Creek Mining. 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  33 

Out of the 813 assay intervals that IMC checked against certificates, there were no assay 
differences found for silver, zinc, or lead. In summary, the certificate check did not identify any 
issues with the assay information in the electronic data set. 

Several of the holes selected in the list above were identified from the check assay results as holes 
were outliers occurred. The certificates were reviewed to see if sample swap issues could have 
explained the check assay outliers. 

IMC has not completed a check of certificates for the 43 holes drilled in 2010. 

14.3 Standards 
Pulp standards or Certified Reference Material (CRM) are inserted roughly every 20 intervals by 
Bear Creek geologists. Since split core is received by ALS-Chemex and standards are pulps, the 
lab does know that the insertion is either a standard or blank. They however, do not know which 
standard or blank. 

IMC completed a review of the silver standards values versus the reported values from ALS-
Chemex. As of February 2009 there were 1,078 standards in the database with certified mid-values 
that are greater than 1.0. The new 2010 drilling data has 54 additional standards analysis and 52 
'blanks'. 

IMC has sorted the values that are 1.0 g/t or less out for separate review as "blanks". The standards 
with low silver values of 1.0 g/t appear to be treated as "blanks" in the Bear Creek insertion process. 
The figures below show the comparison of silver standards with grade above 1.0 g/t versus reported 
ALS-Chemex assay results. Figure 14-1 illustrates all the 2006, 2007, and 2008 standards. Figure 
14.2 shows the standards results analysed in 2009 and 2010. 

Included in Figure 14.1 are 115 assays from the standard CIMM-24. In the Excel file provided to 
IMC this standard has Two Certified Silver Grades, the values are 3.5 g/t (27 intervals) and 
4.1 g/t (88 intervals). These observations are of silver grades well below economic interest. 
However, the certified value for this standard should be verified and the correct CRM values used. 

The newer drilling data included three higher grade standards, BCSA-4357 with a CRM value of 
37.6 g/t, BSCA-1234 at 24.6 g/t, and BSCA-3875 having a certified value of 48.2 g/t silver.  

Between 2006 and 2009 the CRM checks were generally unbiased in the range of interesting 
economic grades. IMC has reviewed the standards from 2006 that appear to be outside the 
expected ranges. Historically these may have been due to the data recording and insertion process.

Figure 14.2 
2009 and 2010 Assay Standards Greater than 1.0 g/t 

 

The results of the 2010 CRM checks indicate a very slight high bias of silver values by ALS-
Chemex, in grades above 20.0 g/t. The new standards analyses show no indications of sample 
swaps. In the historic data there are a few outliers that may be due to sample swaps in the sample 
handling or database process. 

14.4 Blanks 
The standards file provided to IMC contains: 

• In the February 2009 database there are 172 inserted pulps with certified values of 0.0 g/t 
silver; 

• 110 inserted pulps with certified values of 1.0 g/t silver are contained in the February 2009 
data; 

• During 2009-2010 there were 24 samples inserted with certified values of 1.0 g/t silver; and 

• There are 28 new samples with certified values of 0.0 g/t silver.  

IMC has chosen to treat both of those standards sets as "blanks" in that the 1.0 g/t material is 
substantially lower grade than any potential economic consideration.

within the Bear Creek system.

In summary, none of the ALS-Chemex assays of blank values reported grades that were greater 
than about ¼ of the lowest potentially interesting economic cutoff grade. Figure 14.3 shows the 
assay results of the 2009 and 2010 'blank' standards.

14.5 Pulp Check Assays 
Bear Creek routinely sends duplicate pulps out for reassay at the Inspectorate Assay Lab in Lima 
as a measure of the ability of ALS-Chemex to repeat their results on the same pulp. Figures 14.4 
and 14.5 present the XY and QQ plots of silver from the February 2009 and June 2010 data base 
ALS-Chemex assays versus the Inspectorate AAS finish duplicate assay. Correlation is good and 
there is no evidence of bias or inappropriate variability within the 2009 and recent 2010 assay 
procedure. 

There are 193 recent (2009-2010) duplicate pulp analyses. This is approximately four repeat assays 
per drillhole completed in late 2009 to mid-2010. The mean of the recent drilling original values is 
17.95 g/t and the mean of the duplicates are 17.70 g/t. Historically, there were 2,573 duplicates in 
the February 2009 data set, with the ALS-Chemex mean of 24.7 g/t and the Inspectorate duplicate 
of 24.4 g/t.  

In June 2010 IMC also received duplicate assay data for zinc and lead. Figures 14.6 and 14.7 
present XY plots of zinc and lead of the 2009-2010 original ALS-Chemex assays versus the 
Inspectorate AAS finish duplicate assay. The XY plots of these elements show no bias or reason for 
concern.

14.6 Half Core Duplicates Samples 
In 2007 Bear Creek personnel began a half core check program in which the second half of the 
remaining drill core is send out for re-assay as a check against the original split core sample. This 
sample is selected as the last full 2m sample run in the 50th core box. The following results are 
based on data February 2009. No half core sample results from March 2009 to June 2010 were 
sent to IMC. 

The half core duplicates were delivered to IMC in the form of an Excel file with the title 'duplicates'. 
The second half core sample is sent to ALS-Chemex for preparation and assay in the identical 
method as the original samples. There are assays for silver, zinc, lead, and copper for each of the 
selected drillhole intervals. This report focuses on the results for silver. 

The 350 split core samples are from 284 drillholes. 

Figure 14.8 is an XY plot of the original ALS-Chemex assay versus the half core duplicate assay. 
The plot shows that within the core duplicate assay, six intervals have significantly lower grades 
than their original assays. The questionable intervals are listed in Table 14.1.

DDH-SA-64B 150 152 13643 50.0 143.0 -93.0 

 

The grade differences illustrated in Table 14.1 are generally in the high-grade range, indicating that 
there is a significant variability within the high grade assays. These types of assay values occur in 
every drillhole but their size and continuity is quite variable. 

IMC also applied several statistical hypothesis tests on the data illustrated in Figure 14.8. The two 
data sets pass all of the following statistical tests indicating that the two samples could have come 
from the same population with 95% confidence, including: T-Test on Mean; Pair T Test on Sample 
differences; Binomial Test; and the Komologorov-Smirnoff test of populations. 

Detail review of the data did identify that two of the high-grade samples in the above list incurred a 
nearly matching value in a previous or following interval. This result could indicate that there may be 
some mislabeling of the sample intervals. Alternatively, the physical vein orientation could cross 
from one half-sample to the other across an adjacent sample interval.

16 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

16.1 Metallurgical Test Work 
Detailed leach test work has been performed on several representative composite ore samples 
taken from the Santa Ana ore body. The test work shows that the long-term recovery of silver will be 
70% when the ore is crushed to 80% passing 19mm. Recent analysis of the earlier test work and an 
on-going column leach test on ore crushed to 80% passing 9.5 mm, has indicated that the recovery 
of silver will increase to at least 75% and a significantly shorter recovery period can be obtained. 
However, the FS and the economic analyses have all been based on the 19mm crush case and 
70% long-term recovery. 

16.1.1 Metallurgical Testing – Phase I 
The project has no recent mining history. BCM approached the metallurgical testing in a systematic 
fashion in three phases. 

The samples for the Phase I test program were coarse assay rejects. Ten intervals were selected to 
represent all areas of known mineralization including both high and low grade mineralization. The 
samples assay ranged from 52g/t Ag to 172g/t Ag. 

16.1.1.1 Test Procedures 
Three laboratories performed tests on the samples. 

• ALS/Chemex Laboratories in Lima performed 24-hour shaker tests on the coarse assay 
rejects.(#10 mesh); 

• Plenge Lab in Lima performed 96-hour bottle roll tests on samples ground to 50% -200 mesh; 
and 

• McClelland Laboratories performed 168 hour bottle roll tests on coarse assay rejects (#10 
mesh).

The tests demonstrated the viability of cyanide leaching of these ores as well as a recovery 
sensitivity to size and leach times.

16.1.2 Metallurgical Testing – Phase II 
BCM initiated a series of bottle roll and column tests to simulate the effect of fine grinding high-
grade ores and adding the pulp to crushed low-grade ores for heap leaching. The process is known 
as pulp agglomeration. 

BCM selected half core samples from the results of assays to be representative of the ore body. 
The high grade sample assayed 106 g/t, the low grade ores [heap grade] assayed 37 g/t. 

The tests were done at McClelland Laboratories in Sparks, Nevada. 

16.1.2.1 Bottle Roll Tests 
168 hour bottle roll tests were performed on heap grade ores at p80 19mm and the high grade ores 
at p80 212 micron, p80 150 micron and p80 75 micron (200 mesh). Table 16.2 presents results of 
the Phase II bottle roll testing.

Three 150 day column leach tests were done on: 

• Heap Grade ore at p80 19mm; 

• High Grade ore at p80 19mm; 

• Pulp Agglomeration with 20% high grade at p80 150 micron; and 

• And 80% heap grade at p80 19mm.

The bottle roll tests indicated that grinding high-grade ores finer than 150 micron was not effective 
for recovery. The grind of 212 micron was only moderately effective. 

In the column tests, virtually identical recoveries were obtained for the three columns. 

The slight advantage in recovery of a pulp agglomeration process does not justify the capital cost of 
the equipment (i.e., grinding mills and thickeners) or the operating cost of ore separation and 
operation of the system. 

16.1.2.3 Cyanide Amenability Tests (Shaker) 
The series of Cyanide Amenability tests were done as part of the Phase II testing. A shaker test 
involves placing a sample in a cyanide solution and shaking for 24 hours. 

Table 16.4 presents results of all the shaker tests, including the Phase I tests.

The shaker tests along with the other Phase I and Phase II tests provide BCM with sufficient data to 
select drill locations for a representative master sample for definitive testing. 

16.1.3 Metallurgical Testing – Phase III 
The Phase III testing included: 

• Whole rock and ICP identification; 

• Bottle roll tests at three crush sizes; 

• Column tests at three crush sizes; and 

• Comminution testing. 

16.1.3.1 Sample Selection 
BCM selected three locations for representative metallurgical samples on the basis of the Phase I 
and II test results. Three PQ size holes were drilled and a master composite created with whole 
core. 

Table 16.5 presents the master composite make up and Figure 16.1 illustrates the drilling and 
sampling location within the Santa Ana project.

The Master Composite was shipped to McClelland Laboratory. McClelland Labs reduced the core to 
p80 63-mm in stage crushing and thoroughly blended the crushed product. A split was taken from 
the Master for bottle roll and column tests at 63 mm and comminution testing. Splits were taken 
from the Master Composite and stage crushed to 37.5 mm and 19-mm for bottle roll and column 
testing. The range of silver assays and calculated heads from the tests was 52-60 g/t.

16.1.3.2 Bottle Roll Tests 
Bottle roll tests were performed at 63mm, 37.5mm, and 19mm sizes. The 168 hour (7 day) tests 
were performed at pH of 10.5 (maintained with lime) and a maintained NaCN concentration of 1.0 
g/L.

Silver leaching was ongoing in all tests of 168 hours albeit at a low rate. Lime and NaCN 
consumption increase as the crush size decreases. 

16.1.3.3 Column Leach Tests 
Column tests were performed on the 63mm, 37.5mm and 19mm sizes. The column test procedure 
included head and tail assay screens, and a 23-element ICP scan of a composited first 5-day 
pregnant solution. 

Agglomeration testing was not required. Previous column testing and screen analysis of crushed 
product indicated that percolation would not be affected at any height. In general, heap percolation 
problems do not occur with ores with less than 10% -200 mesh materials. The Santa Ana ores at 
the finest crush indicate less than 5% -200 mesh size. 

The columns were leached at 12 L/hr/m2 solution application rate with a 1.0 g/L NaCN solution. A 
target pH of 10.5 maintained with milk of lime. After 30 days of leach, the NaCN concentration was 
allowed to go to 0.50 g/L and was maintained at that level through the remainder of the leach cycle. 

The columns were leached and rinsed for a total of 144 days. The columns were placed on 1 week 
leach and 1 week rest cycles when silver solution tenors dropped to low levels. 

Results of the Phase III column tests are presented in Table 16.7.

The silver recovery is based on the calculated head. The calculated head is the sum of all the silver 
in solution through the leach/rinse cycle plus the silver in the residues as determined by duplicate 
fire assays. 

Table 16.8 presents reagent consumptions for the column test.

The column test charges were treated with the amount of dry lime as indicated by the bottle roll 
tests. The 63-mm and 37.5-mm columns reached the desired pH level of 10.5 at the onset of 
leaching and maintained pH levels with modest additions of milk of lime. 

The 19-mm column initially reached the desired pH level but within 30 days the pH had dropped to 
levels as low as 9.2. The adjustment to the desired pH level required large amounts of milk of lime. 
The milk of lime must be added in small increments to avoid plugging the column. 

The column test results indicated that the p80 19mm crush size should be utilized for the feasibility 
study and the project. 

The column data for all sizes indicate an early return of silver values followed by a long period of 
steady but small returns. This behaviour is illustrated in Figure 16.2 and these leach curves are 
typical for silver ores. A finer crush favours the early return and the long-term recovery. 

Column leach times understate the time required in the heap. Columns tend to plug flow, heaps 
tend to diffusion flow. Empirical formulas have been developed to predict heap requirements or field 
days. The early return period of the curve is multiplied by 3 times, the curve break area is at 2.5 
times and the tail-out is at a 1/1 ratio. BMC has utilized a 360 day complete leach cycle for silver 
production. The leach cycle includes allowances for placement, wetting of ore, solution retention in 
the heap and processing to a silver bar. Recovery data derived from Santa Ana laboratory column 
testing is illustrated in Figure 16.2 along with the modelled recovery curve used in the financial 
model.

Figure 16.2 
Column Test Recovery vs. Time 

 

The columns were leaching albeit at slow rates at the cessation of the tests. Once the tail-out of the 
silver values has begun, the leach rate can be predicted by the use of regression formulas. The p80 
19mm column recovery at 144 days leach and rinse regresses to a recovery of 70% silver in 210 
days of column leach which in turn is 360 days of field leach. For the design of the heap leaching 
pad, a 120-day primary leach cycle was assumed. The additional 240 days of leaching to finish the 
recovery is assumed to happen in the lower lifts of the heap as leach solution passes through the 
pad. 

The long term leach cycle demands multi-lifts in the heap and recirculation of low grade solution are 
done. Also solution application rates on ores in the latter stages of the cycle are reduced. 

The NaCN consumption in the 19mm column was high at 1.15 kg/t. In the absence of cyanocides 
(such as is the case at Santa Ana), heap leaching NaCN consumptions under operating conditions 
are characteristically ¼X to 1/3X of column testing consumptions. In addition, poor pH control in the 
19mm column test probably affected the NaCN consumption negatively. Therefore, NaCN 
consumption of 0.4 kg/t ore was considered appropriate for this feasibility study.

The lime consumption in the 19mm was very high, at 5.86 kg/t mostly due to the attempt to correct 
the initial low pH from the column. A review of all previous tests indicate the 3.0 kg/t lime to be 
added during crushing will be adequate. 

16.1.3.4 Comminution Testing 
Phase III comminution testing resulted in the following data: 

• Low Energy Impact Test 10.3 kwh/t; and 

• Abrasion Index 0.0539 

The low energy impact test is a measure of power required to crush the ore to 19mm size. This ore 
is moderate to low in power requirements. 

The abrasion index is a relative measure of the wear to be expected on crushers and screens. This 
ore has a very low abrasion index. Wear will be minimal. 

16.1.4 Process Selection 
A heap leach operation at p80 19mm crush size is appropriate for the Santa Ana Project. 

The relatively low silver grade (>50 g/t) combined with the 15% differential in heap leach recovery 
vs. milling recovery does not justify the much higher capital and operating costs of milling. 

A Merrill-Crowe (zinc precipitation) is appropriate for recovery of silver. Economic studies 
comparing carbon adsorption vs. Merrill-Crowe recovery in gold/silver ores show that for a 
silver/gold ratio of over 4/1 the Merrill-Crowe presents the best economic case. 

The Santa Ana silver/gold ratio is 7142/1. 

16.2 Silver and Gold Recovery 
Silver recovery of 70.0% is projected for the Santa Ana Project. The recovery is predicted on a p80 
19mm crush size and a 360 day total (primary and secondary) leach cycle. 

Gold recovery of 75% is projected for the Santa Ana Project. The master composite for the 
definitive test program contained gold at 0.006-.008 g/t of gold. The definitive test column at p80 
19mm extracted 0.008 g/t of gold in seven days of leaching or a recovery of 100%. Both the initial 
assay and the solution assays from which the extracted gold was calculated are at or below assay 
limits. The actual recovery is questionable. A 75% recovery is a conservative estimate.

17 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
Estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves at Santa Ana were developed from a computer 
based block model of the mineralization. The mineral resource was based on the application of the 
floating cone open pit computer program to that model. The floating cone was used to determine 
the component of mineralization with reasonable expectation of economic extraction. 

The mineral reserve was based on a detailed mine plan. The mine plan was guided by additional 
floating cone results that guided mine phase designs and mine plans that incorporated access 
roads and appropriate equipment operating room. The mineral reserve is the total of all proven and 
probable category ore that is planned for processing within the mine plan. 

This section describes the block model and summarizes the mine plan and floating cone that result 
in the mineral reserves and mineral resources. Section 23 presents a more detailed discussion of 
the mine plan. 

17.1 Block Model 
The block model was developed using blocks sized 5 x 5 m in plan and 5m high. The selection of 
this small block size was based on a number of judgments including the width of high-grade 
mineralization and the potential to eventually mine the deposit with smaller mining equipment. 

The block model is assembled in the UTM coordinate system and is parallel to the UTM grid. 
Topographic information was assigned to the model based on topographic maps provided to IMC 
from Bear Creek. The topographic maps are consistent with field observations and with drillhole 
collar coordinates.

17.1.1 Data Base 
The data base for the block model assembly was developed from 349 diamond drillholes. The 
following summarizes the data available as of June 2010: 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  58 

• Number of Drillholes:  349 holes 

• Meters of Drilling:  60,143.7 meters 

• Number of Drill Intervals: 28,923 intervals 

• Number of Silver Assays: 28,696 assayed intervals 

Each of the intervals that were assayed for silver was also assayed for copper, lead, and zinc. 
Copper, lead, and zinc were modelled, but the heap leach process applied for metal recovery at 
Santa Ana does not recover the lead, zinc, or copper. 

17.1.2 Rock Type and Estimation Boundaries 
Population bounds or estimation zone boundaries have been assigned to the Santa Ana Block 
model. There are four estimation zones, two zones are to align the estimation parameters with the 
predominate mineralization directions. Figure 17.1 illustrates the zone assignments applied to the 
model on the 3990 meter elevation. Zone 1 has been estimated with a North-South oriented ellipse; 
while model blocks and composites in Zone 2 were estimated with the ellipse oriented North 40° 
East. 

The host rock is primarily volcanic andesite with minor dykes and intrusives. There are post mineral 
volcanics that overly the andesites on the western edge of the deposit. They just appear on the 
northwest edge of Figure 17.1 on the 3990 elevation. The post mineralization volcanics are barren 
and were assigned as Zone 3. Also added to the Santa Ana block model is a barren sedimentary 
rock Zone 4. Zone 4 is mainly on the northern end of the deposit. No grades were assigned in either 
of Zones 3 or 4 as they are barren or low grade.

17.1.3 Density Assignment 
Bear Creek collects density data on a regular basis by weighing whole core samples in two steps: 
1) dry and, 2) suspended in water. IMC has spot checked the calculation of the individual densities 
from each sample. In total there were 843 density measurements provided to IMC. The density 
results correlate well with rock type but showed no correlation with the silver grade of the sample. 
Consequently, a simple density assignment by rock type was applied to the block model: 

• Rock Type  Dry Specific Gravity 

• Mineralized Tuff  2.469 

• Post Mineral Tuff 2.059 

• Sediments  2.318 

17.1.4 Block Grade Estimation 
Block grades were estimated for silver, and zinc using Indicator Kriging (IK). Lead and copper were 
estimated using linear kriging. The indicator kriging procedure that was applied for silver and zinc 
was used to establish a computer generated grade contour. The boundary or contour is generally 
referred to as a discriminator value. Silver incorporated a discriminator value of 
15.0 g/t Ag, and zinc utilized a discriminator value of zinc 0.13% Zn. These grade contours were 
used to segregate a moderate grade population from a lower grade population within the deposit. 
Grades were estimated above and below the discriminator values, and only inside zones 1 and 2 
(Mineralized Tuff).  

Assay data was composited to 5m down-hole composites. Prior to compositing, individual assay 
values were cut in order to limit the influence of high-grade outliners on the block grade distribution. 

Assay Cuts Prior to Compositing: 

• Silver  +1000 g/t set to 1000 g/t 21 assays 

• Lead  +4.5% set to 4.5%  35 assays 

• Zinc  +4.5% set to 4.5%  28 assays 

• Copper  +0.35% set to 0.35%  15 assays 

The Santa Ana drillholes were composited to 5m down hole or length composites for use in block 
grade estimation after the above cuts were completed on assays. 

Cumulative frequency plots were generated for each of the metals. These were evaluated to 
determine breaks or boundaries within the mineral population. Review of those graphs resulted in 
the use of population breaks for both silver and zinc at 15 g/t and 0.13% respectively. No grade 
boundaries were applied to lead or copper. 

The 15 g/t discriminator was used to establish an indicator kriged boundary of plus 15g/t blocks 
versus lower grade blocks for silver. For zinc, the discriminator grade was 0.13%. Both indicators 
were sorted on a 50% probability level to establish whole block assignments where the blocks have 
a greater than 50% chance of being above 15 g/t silver. A similar approach was used for zinc with a 
0.13% discriminator.

Although the zones utilize different search orientations, the zone boundaries 1 and 2, were not 
treated as hard boundaries for the indicator assignment. Composite grades were allowed to 
comingle between the zones. However, zones 3 and 4 were not estimated and are considered 
barren.  

Once the silver and zinc indicators codes were assigned to the model, the respective block grades 
were estimated using ordinary linear kriging inside and outside of the indicator areas, treating the 
indicator breaks as hard boundaries. A maximum of 10 composites were used and a minimum of 2 
were used to assign the grade. A maximum of 3 composites per drillhole were allowed within the 
search process.

Lead and copper were estimated based on ordinary linear kriging without the application of indicator 
grade boundaries. Table 17.3 summarizes the search and kriging parameters used to estimate the 
block grades.  

The high-grade limit on Table 17.3 was used to reduce the impact of high-grade composites on the 
grade estimate. For example, in Silver Zone 1, a silver value of 200 g/t utilized a search limit of 33-
m. Consequently, high grades over 200 g/t could not be extended more than a 33-m radius. 

17.1.5 Bottom Limit 
Once the block grades were assigned for silver, lead, zinc, and copper, a limit was applied below 
the bottom of the drillholes to stop the downward extrapolation of the extensive vertical search. A 
boundary was established that limited downward extrapolation below the bottom of a drillhole to 
less than 30 m. Any block value that was more than 30-m below a drillhole was assigned a zero 
value within the model. 

An inverse distance procedure was applied as an indicator to determine the presence or absence of 
assay information. That inverse distance indicator was used to clip the mineralization if there were 
extrapolated block values below the 30-m search limit. Table 17.4 details the bottom limit 
'estimation' parameters.

17.1.6 Classification 
Blocks were coded as measured, indicated or inferred based on the silver grade estimate. The 
kriged standard deviation (square root of the kriged variance) and the number of composites were 
used to estimate the silver grade and were used to establish the block classification. The 
parameters are summarized below:

Indicated Silver grade was estimated, and the kriged standard deviation is less than or equal to 1.05 

Measured 

Silver grade was estimated, and the kriged standard 
deviation is less than or equal to 0.65, and 4 or 
more composites used to estimate the grade (2 or 
more drillholes) 

17.2 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
Mineral resources were established based on the block model and the results of an approximate 
open pit geometry. The floating cone algorithm was used to establish the component of the block 
model that meets the criteria for reasonable expectation of economic extraction for the resource. 
The mineral resource presented in this section is completely contained within a computer generated 
open pit geometry.

The mineral reserve is the result of a detailed annual mine plan. The mineral reserve is the sum of 
all proven and probable class ore that is planned for processing during the mine life. The floating 
cone algorithm was used to guide the development of the mine plan, however, the mine plan 
includes mine roads, and proper equipment working room. 

John M. Marek P.E. of Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. was in responsible charge of the 
mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and is the qualified person for this section. Mr. 
Marek is independent of Bear Creek mining.  

17.2.1 Mineral Reserves 
The mine plan that results in the mineral reserve will be discussed in more detail in Section 23. The 
basic economic input and the mine schedule is presented in this section for completeness. 

The floating cone algorithm was used to guide to the development of the final pit design and the 
extraction sequence for the Santa Ana open pit. Table 17.5 summarizes the economic input 
assumptions that were used for the floating cone runs. These values were based on the results of 
the previously completed PEA and do not reflect the final cost estimates from this feasibility study.  

The final pit was guided by a silver price of $13.00 /oz. However, multiple cones were developed to 
provide guidance for the design of practical mining pushbacks of phases. The breakeven and 
internal cutoffs for a range of metal prices are also shown on Table 17.5. Economic credit was only 
applied to measured and indicated silver mineralization within the cones used for mine planning 
guidance.  

A series of 6 phases or pushback designs were developed for input to the mine schedule. Figure 
17.2 illustrates the final pushback and correspondingly the final pit design that contains the mineral 
reserve. The waste rock facility illustrated in Figure 17.2 does not represent the optimized 
geotechnical design and was used only to account for waste volume and hauling distances. Details 
of the optimized waste rock facility are provided in Section 23.4.7. The total material movement of 
ore, low grade and waste within the final pit is 109,704 kt of which 37,077 kt of ore is planned for 
processing. 

Table 17.6 summarizes the mine production schedule for the Santa Ana feasibility study. Proven 
and Probable ores are combined on the mine schedule and are the only materials considered for 
economic benefit within the mine plan and mineral reserve. The total of all ore processed within the 
feasibility study mine plan matches the total proven plus probable mineral reserves on Table 17.7.

17.3 Mineral Resources 
Estimated mineral resources were based on a larger floating cone that was generated at a silver 
price of $16.00 /oz. Seventeen percent lower process and mining costs were utilized in the resource 
cones as compared with those on Table 17.4. Slope angles and process recoveries were 
unchanged from those on Table 17.5. The internal cutoff grade for the input economics was 15 g/t. 

The resource cone did allow economic credit for inferred mineralization. However, no economic 
analysis or credit for inferred mineralization is included anywhere in this feasibility study. 

Once the resource floating cone was established, the incremental resource mineralization between 
the mineral reserve and the resource cone was calculated by subtraction. Consequently, Table 17.8 
summarizes the mineral resources that are in addition to mineral reserves and do not include the 
mineral reserves.

19 Interpretations and Conclusions 
Ausenco Vector has relied on John Marek, the QP for sections 7 through 14 of this Technical 
Report, for the detailed review of the geology, mineralization, sampling and block modelling 
presented in this Technical Report on the Feasibility Study of the Santa Ana Project. The 
assumptions and resulting data input have been completed in accordance with acceptable industry 
standards.   

At the Feasibility-level, the Santa Ana project reflects: 

• Positive economics with excellent exposure to up-side silver prices. For example, a change in 
silver price from the assumed $14.50 per ounce used in the FS to the London closing on 
October 6, 2010 of $22.92 decreases the Capital Payback period from 3.4 to 1.4 years and 
increases the NPV and IRR by approximately 300% and 175%, respectively; 

• Well-defined resources open to expansion and conversion to reserves; 

• Favorable infrastructure; heap leach, power and access; 

• Available local water supply; 

• Well-defined permitting path; and 

• Local community acceptance. 

The key results and highlights of this study include: 

• The Santa Ana project can be in production by the later part of 2012; 

• Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves containing 63.2 million ounces of silver at Santa Ana; 

• Santa Ana Project pre-tax NPV of $85.3 million at a 5% discount rate and IRR of 25.3% at 
$14.50 per ounce silver. After tax net present value of $66.5 million and IRR 21.8%; 

• 11 year mine life producing 44.2 million ounces of silver; 

• Average annual saleable silver production of 4.6 million ounces per year for the first 6 years; 

• Cash cost of $9.02 per ounce silver for the 11 years LOM; 

• Capital costs of $68.8 million with Capital Payback in 3.4 years at $14.50/ oz Ag.; 

• At $22.92 per ounce silver the project would have a pre-tax IRR of 70.2% and an NPV at 5% 
of $341 million. On an after tax basis the IRR would be 52.6% and NPV $232 million; 

• At current silver prices of $22.92 per ounce, free cash flow estimated at $46 million per year 
for the first 6 years with a 1.4 year pay back; 

• Numerous upside opportunities being explored including increase of silver recovery through 
finer crushing, reductions in cash costs, and an extended mine life plan to include an 
additional 35.7 million ounces silver; and 

• The Santa Ana deposit remains open, mainly at depth and to the north where the 
northernmost holes contain up to 22 meters @ 124 g/t Ag from surface.

20 Recommendations 
The authors of this Technical Report on the Feasibility of the Santa Ana Project recommend 
proceeding with detailed engineering and permitting. 

The study has identified areas of opportunities that will be analysed in later engineering studies and 
test work: 

Reduce the crush size to improve recovery and leaching rate. Produce "trade-off" studies to 
examine required additional capital expenditures and crushing costs versus benefits in the form of 
reduced cash costs per ounce of silver. 

Investigate reducing the process plant footprint to reduce capital costs; and 

As the sensitivity analysis shows, the project is sensitive to operating costs. BCM and its 
consultants will explore different ways to reduce operating costs mainly by reducing reagent 
consumption in the process during operations.

23 Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development Properties 

23.1 Mining 

23.1.1 Summary 
Santa Ana is planned to be mined using conventional open pit hard rock methods to deliver 3,600 kt 
of ore per year (10,000 tpd) to the crusher for heap leach processing. The total material movement 
at the mine is planned to be around 12,500 kt per year (34,725 tpd) for years 1 through 5. After that 
time the waste stripping requirements begin to taper down. 

Mining will utilize 5m benches. Drilling and blasting is planned for all material to be moved. Blast 
hole sampling and assaying will be required for ore control within the pit. Bear Creek currently plans 
to utilize a mining contractor at Santa Ana. An estimate of contract mining cost has been developed 
for this study based on the direct operating costs of standard mining equipment combined with 
contractor equipment ownership costs and profit margin. 

The major mine equipment that was the basis of the study includes: 

• 3 - Blast Hole Drills with 45,000lb pull down and 6 inch bits; 

• 3 - 8.6 cubic meter front end loaders; 

• Up to 14 - 63 metric tonne trucks; and 

• Appropriate mine auxiliary and support equipment is also planned and scheduled. 

The mine production schedule is summarized on Table 23.1. The annual mine plan and waste 
storage drawings are summarized on Tables 23.6 through 23.16. Three quarterly mine plans were 
developed for the preproduction period and Year 1 of the mine plan, however, only the annual plans 
are presented in this text for brevity. 

23.1.2 Introduction 
Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. developed the mine plan, equipment requirements, capital 
costs, and contractor operating costs. Preproduction stripping costs were calculated as part of the 
operating costs; however, they have been treated as capital costs within the project financial 
analysis. 

The process cost and recovery input information to the mine plan was provided to IMC by Bear 
Creek personnel working with the process testing and design team members.

23.1.3 Project Production Rate Consideration 
Alternative production rates were evaluated by IMC and Bear Creek during the PEA evaluation in 
2009. No further evaluation of production rate alternatives was required at this time. The feasibility 
mine plans focus on producing 10,000 tpd of ore to the crusher. 

23.1.4 Economic Pit Limits 
As discussed in Section 17, the floating cone algorithm was used as a guide to the development of 
the final pit and mine pushback designs. Economic and process recovery information that was used 
as input to the mine design cones was summarized on Table 17.4. 

The mining cost was based on the results from the PEA study including the haulage between the 
crushing plant and the heap leach. Processing costs were provided by Bear Creek based on work 
from the process contractor (HLC, 2010). The slope angles for the cones were based on the 
Ausenco Vector Pit Slope Design report (Ausenco Vector, 2010) with a reduction in slope angle to 
reflect the impacts of haul roads in the cones. These parameters and the resulting cone geometries

were used to guide phase design and final pit design. They are not intended to represent 
engineered cost and stability estimates or to be used for financial analysis. 

Figure 23.1 illustrates the cone produced at the silver price of $13.00/oz. This cone was used as a 
guide to design the final pit. 

Cones were generated for silver prices ranging from $5.00/oz to $15.00/oz. Cones run at silver 
prices lower than $13.00/oz. were used to determine the regions containing the most valuable 
material. Figure 23.2 shows nested cones between $8.00 /oz and $13.00/oz silver sliced at the 
4200 bench elevation.

23.1.5 Phase Designs 
A total of six phases were designed for the development of a practical mine production schedule. 
The sequence of the phase geometries corresponds with cones of increasing silver price allowing 
the more valuable material to be mined earlier in the mine life. Phases were designed with proper 
equipment operating room, working geometries and access roads. 

The following criteria were followed in designing the phases: 

• Bench Height:   5 meters 

• Interramp Slope Angle:  40 degrees 

• Haul Road Width:  21 meters 

• Haul Road Gradient:  10 percent 

• Minimum pushback width: ~100 meters 

A minimum pushback width of 100 meters was chosen to provide adequate working room and to 
allow for access to multiple ore zones on a single bench. 

In order to minimize preproduction stripping and at the same time provide adequate ore on a single 
bench once production begins, the size of Phase 1 was adjusted to contain a year and a half of ore. 
This also provides an ore cushion if there is a delay in opening the subsequent phase. 

Figure 23.3 illustrates the ultimate pit design. It can be compared with Figure 23.1, the floating cone 
at $13.00/oz silver. 

Figure 23.4 shows the phases sliced at the 4200m bench level to be compared with the cones 
sliced at the 4200 level in Figure 23.2.

23.1.6 Mine Plan and Production Schedules 
The mine production schedule was developed from the previously described model and mine phase 
designs. The schedule was developed to deliver 3,600 kt of ore per year (10,000 tpd) to two semi-
mobile crushers and then to a leach pad. Pre-stripping of later phases is scheduled simultaneously 
with mining of ore in earlier phases to ensure sustained ore release to the crushers throughout the 
mine life. 

Table 23.1 summarizes the scheduled movement of ore, low-grade ore, and waste by year over the 
mine life. Pre-production and the first year of production are broken out into quarters to show 
greater detail. A graphic of the mine schedule is presented in the first graph of 
Figure 23.5. The remaining graphs show the feed to the mill and contained/recovered silver.

23.1.6.1 Description of the Schedule 
For the first five years of mine life, the cutoff grade for ore has been raised above the breakeven 
cutoff of 30 g/t. The cutoff for each year in the schedule was established to maximize the project's 
return on investment. 

The cutoff strategy produces an improved net present value for the project compared to other cutoff 
strategies that were considered. To evaluate the schedule, the same economics were used as for 
running floating cones that were shown on Table 17.5. When creating the schedule, loader 
capacities were also considered in order to prevent scheduling material movement rates that 
required fractional pieces of equipment. 

The cutoff grade for low grade material in the first five years is increased from the internal cutoff of 
24 g/t to 27 g/t to account for an added $0.88/tonne cost to rehandle material from the low-grade 
stockpile to the crusher. Ore from the low-grade stockpile is sent to the crusher during year 10 and 
year 11.  

The mine schedule shows little material movement in the first quarter of preproduction. This quarter 
is set aside for the construction of mine access roads. The ore that is mined in stripping during the 
next three quarters of preproduction is stockpiled near the crushers to be combined with ore mined 
in year one to provide the crushers with a constant feed of 10,000 tpd during Year 1.  

During preproduction, both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are opened in an effort to release enough ore to 
sustain the crusher feed in Year 1. These two phases are not adjacent to each other so the initial 
year appears as two separate pit operations. 

Figures 23.6 through 23-16 illustrate the mine and waste storage plan.

23.1.6.2 Alternative Mine Schedules 
The Santa Ana pit design and production schedule was developed to maximize the project return 
with $13.00 / oz silver. Changes in the silver price could change the mine strategy to match the 
conditions. 

A prolonged down turn in the silver price would result in a shorter mine life with a cash cost per 
ounce around $8.00/oz silver. A sustained long term price of around $19.00/ounce would result in 
an extension of the mine life to take advantage of the substantial tonnage of lower grade material 
that surrounds the Santa Ana feasibility pit. 

All three of the mine schedules: 1) Feasibility, 2) Low Tonnage, and 3) Large Tonnage utilized the 
same pushback designs for the first 3 pushbacks. Consequently, the decision to change the 
strategic course of the mine can be made as late as year 2 or 3. Consequently, implementation of 
the base case Feasibility Schedule on Table 23.1 can be modified after start up to deal with a range 
of economic conditions. The mine plan provides substantial flexibility to deal with both positive and 
negative changes in the silver price. 

Table 23.2 summarizes the Low Tonnage, low cost pit that could be utilized in a low silver price 
condition.  

Table 23.3 summarizes the Large Tonnage, long life pit option should silver prices enjoy a 
prolonged up turn.

23.1.7 Waste and Stockpile Storage 
Waste from the mine is sent to a single waste dump southwest of the pit while low-grade material is 
sent to a low-grade stockpile northeast of the pit during the first five years of production. 

The time sequence illustrations of the mine and material storage plans are shown in 
Figures 23.6 through 23.16. They illustrate the material storage as described in the following 
paragraphs. 

The waste storage area shown the Figure 23.6 to 23.16 annual maps do not reflect the final 
reclamation geometry as illustrated later in Section 23.21. The waste dumps on the mine plan 
drawings were used to calculate storage volumes and hauling distances.  

Uneconomic rock mined from the open pit is hauled to the storage area and dumped from a 
constant elevation of 4255 meters. It is constructed in a semicircular shape by increasing the radius 
with the addition of waste. This geometry results in the shortest haul distance possible over the 
mine life. At the crest, the dump has a final radius of 713 meters and a maximum elevation for this

single lift case is 85 meters. Prior to construction of the dump, all top soil is to be removed from the 
footprint of the toe to be used in reclamation. 

The low-grade stockpile is stacked from the bottom up in 5 meter lifts. The first lift is dumped at the 
4190 meter elevation and the crest of the final lift is at 4220 meters. Construction of the dump 
begins in preproduction and ends in year five. The stockpile is re-mined in years ten and eleven to 
be sent to the crusher. 

23.1.8 Mine Operations and Equipment 
Mine mobile equipment was selected to meet the production requirements as outlined on Table 
23.4. Mine equipment was selected on the basis of establishing an efficient, safe, and low cost mine 
operation. Bear Creek currently contemplates using a mining contractor and as such, the selection 
of the mining equipment fleet will actually be established by that contractor.  

The approach applied to this study was to select the most efficient fleet as if the project were to be 
owner operated. The costs of operating that equipment were then converted to contractor costs 
including ownership and profit markup. 

Mining is schedule for 360 days/year, and 3 shifts per day of 8 hours duration. Four crews will be 
required to maintain the shift schedule. The ramp up of scheduled shifts during preproduction is 
planned as follows: 

• Preproduction Quarter 1:  60 Shifts/Qtr 

• Preproduction Quarters 2 through 4: 180 Shifts/Qtr, 2 Shifts/day 

• Years 1 through 10:   1080 Shifts/Year, 3 Shifts/day  

It has been assumed that there will be 7 hours worked during a shift with a standard efficiency of 50 
minutes per hour resulting in 350 operating minutes per shift. This term is sometimes referred to as 
effective time per shift. All equipment productivities reported herein are based on 350 operating 
minutes per shift. 

The in-place material densities were presented in Section 17 Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserve Estimates. A 40% swell factor and 2.5% in-situ moisture content has been used for all 
equipment calculations. The material will re-compact slightly on the waste dumps so that a 30% 
swell from in-situ has been used for waste dump design. 

There are two components or functions that will be completed with the mine equipment. 

• Mining from the pit and delivery of ore to the crusher, low grade to the stockpile, and waste to 
the waste storage facility; and 

• Haulage of the crushed material from the crusher to the heap leach pad and spreading of the 
material with a dozer on the heap leach pad. 

The following discussion of equipment addresses the open pit mining. 

Drilling will be completed with conventional track mounted blasthole drills. Pull down levels of 
45,000 lbs (100,000 kg) were judged to be appropriate for the material at Santa Ana with bit 
diameters of 6 inches (15.25 cm). Drillholes will be sampled and assayed for ore control Holes will 
be loaded with ANFO and blasted prior to loading.

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  109 

Loading is planned to utilize front-end loaders with 8.6 cubic meter buckets. Loaders were selected 
to match the production requirements and to utilize their mobility when dealing with multiple 
pushbacks. The front-end loaders will also be used for auxiliary functions including minor rehandling 
at the crusher stockpile and mine road construction etc. 

Haulage is planned with 63t haul trucks for all material. 

Track dozers are 310 HP (D8 Class) units and graders are 14ft moldboard (Cat 14m class). A 
50,000 liter water truck is provided for dust suppression. A drill for pioneering and secondary 
breakage is provided along with a 2 cubic meter excavator for general mine support. 

Other minor support equipment is also provided in the equipment list. The minor items include but 
are not limited to items such as: lube and fuel trucks, light plants, pickups, blasting trucks, and 
loader-tire handlers.  

Once the ore has been crushed, it will be delivered by conveyor to a haul truck for transport to the 
heap leach pad. A front end loader will not be required to load the leach trucks. The same 63t haul 
trucks will be used for this task. For most years, 2 or 3 additional trucks will be working to deliver 
material to the heap. 

A D8 Class dozer equipped with a ripper is allocated to the leach pad for spreading, ripping and 
preparing the material on the pads. 

Table 23.4 summarizes the major mine equipment. The top of the table presents the mine 
equipment, and the lower portion summarizes the equipment for the heap leach haul and spreading. 

The estimated contractor personnel to operate and maintain the equipment is summarized on Table 
23.5. Contractor supervisory staff is also shown on the table. 

The owners supervisory, engineering, and geology staff at the mine are not included in the 
personnel list on Table 23.5 because they are included in the owner's cost.

23.2 Mineral Processing 
Heap Leaching Consulting in coordination with Ausenco-Vector prepared the design criteria for the 
metallurgical process considering information related to plant capacity and operating conditions. 
The information used in the design criteria was obtained from field work, metallurgical testing 
programs, and leach pad design prepared by Vector. Some data was assumed from experience on 
similar projects and from mathematical calculation. 

The basic process consists of material from the open pit transported to the crushing plant, which will 
comprise two crushing stages and one classification stage. The final crushed ore product will 
consist of 80 percent passing 19mm and will be conveyed to the temporary stockpile. The reclaim 
system will consist of one fixed conveyor stockpile to withdraw material from the stockpile and 
deliver onto trucks. Trucks will transport the ore from the stockpile to the heap leach pad, which will 
receive 10,000 tpd of ore containing 53 g/t of silver. A sodium cyanide solution will be drip irrigated 
on the heap to dissolve silver minerals. The estimated dissolution of silver is 70% and the pregnant 
solution will flow to the Merrill-Crowe plant to produce a precipitate, which will be smelted to 
produce a silver/gold doré bar. 

23.2.1 Flowsheets 
The project process flowsheet development considered the design criteria, field work, leach pad 
design, water system distribution and electric system distribution as inputs; plus, smelting, reagent 
system preparation, effluents detoxification, water distribution and plant facilities for a heap leaching 
process to recover precious metals. The Merrill-Crowe process was selected as the optimum 
alternative to recover the precious metals as a precipitate. The precipitate will be sent to the 
retorting stage, and finally will be smelted to produce a Dore bar. The process flowsheet developed 
for the feasibility study is provided as Figure 23.17 (full flow sheet in Figure 24.2). 

23.2.2 Mass Balance 
The parameters determined in the design criteria were used to calculate the mass balance of the 
process: leaching, Merrill-Crowe Plant, smelting, reagents handling, effluent detoxification process, 
water distribution, and plant facilities. The information obtained was used to select the appropriate 
equipment and flow streams for the metallurgical process as illustrated in Figure 23.17. 

23.2.3 Piping and Instrumentation 
Based on the information obtained on the leaching process, mechanical area, piping and 
instrumentation, the piping and instrumentation diagrams were developed. The diagrams include 
mechanical equipment, instrumentation equipment, piping, valves, effluent detoxification plant 
equipment, water distribution and plant facilities. 

23.2.4 Production Plan 
The production plant was prepared using the mine plan prepared by IMC and consists of periods of 
three months until the ore reserves are exhausted and the additional time required to reach 
maximum dissolution of silver bearing minerals. The metallurgical recovery of silver by the leaching 
process is 70% with leaching periods of 120 days for the primary leach cycle and a total leach time 
of 360 days. The estimated monthly production is 306,255 ounces of silver. 

23.2.5 Process Description 
The metallurgical process comprises the following operations: ore crushing, ore transportation to 
the leach pad, leach pad irrigation, leaching solutions handling, zinc dust precipitation, smelting and 
gases treatment.

23.2.5.1 Crushing 
Run of Mine Ore (ROM) will be delivered by 63t haul trucks to the dump pocket of a single jaw 
crusher located to the west of the pit. The installation was designed to allow one truck to approach 
the dump pocket. The discharge from the dump pocket will flow by gravity to the apron feeder. The 
apron feeder will discharge onto a grizzly with a 200 mm nominal spacing. The feeder will be 
employed to feed the primary crusher. The primary crusher and grizzly feeder undersize products 
will be sent to a vibrating screen in an open circuit with a cone crusher. The cone crusher will be 
operated with an approximate 20-mm closed side setting to ensure that the final screen undersize 
product will be 80% passing 19-mm. The screen undersize product will be dropped onto an 
overland conveyor provided with a belt scale. A simplified flowsheet is provided as Figure 23.17. 

A hydraulic rock breaker will be installed to clear crusher blockages caused by oversized rocks. 
Chains are to be installed on the base of the crusher dump pocket before operations commence to 
allow break up of impacted rocks prior to maintenance around the top of the crusher. The primary 
and secondary crusher service pedestal crane will be located adjacent to the crusher to service 
equipment located around and within the crusher structure. A metal detector and belt magnet at the 
discharge conveyor that feeds the screen will be used as tramp metal protection system. 

Coarse ore from the overland conveyor will be fed to the coarse ore stockpile with a live capacity of 
approximately 6-hrs (3,000t) and dead capacity of one day. The desired design basis for the 
stockpile is to provide sufficient ore capacity to allow for one day down time. The conical coarse ore 
stockpile will not be covered. The reclaim system will consist of one fixed conveyor stockpile to 
withdraw material from the stockpile and deliver onto trucks and a radial stacker building the coarse 
ore.  

The parameters used to design the crushing circuit are listed below, 

• Total capacity, 10,000 t/d 

• Capacity, 555 t/hr 

• Maximum particle size, 24-inch 

• Final product, 80% passing ¾-inch (19-mm) 

• Low Energy Impact Test, 10.3 kw-hr/t 

• BBWI, 17.1 kw-hr/t 

• Abrasion index, 0.0539 

• Specific Gravity, 2.43 

• Bulk density, 1.65 

• Ore moisture, 3-4% 

• Operation, 18 hr per day.

23.2.6 Ore Transport 
Crushed ore will be transported by 63t trucks to the leach pad and dumped into leach cells. The 
material will be placed on the pad in 7m high lifts and pushed to the final placement with a dozer in 
accordance with the stacking plan developed for the project heap leach pad. Prior to leaching the 
top of the leach cell will be ripped by a dozer to ensure proper infiltration of the leach solutions. 

23.2.7 Irrigation System 
The design considers cells of approximately 50m x 120m (6,000 m2) with their respective flow lines 
and drip irrigation system considering as initial point the distribution of manifolds, which will be 
fabricated with schedule 40 steel pipe of 300mm diameter. There will be four distribution pipes of 
150mm diameter that will be connected with an irrigation system. 

The drip irrigation system comprises HDPE pipes of 150mm diameter and Lay Flat™ hoses of 
100mm installed with hoses of 16mm diameter and drips of 4 litres per hour and separated by 
63 cm.  

23.2.8 Leaching 
The leaching operation is a hydrometallurgical process of precious metals dissolution. The cyanide 
solution is spread on the top of the ore heap using drip emitters and percolates through the pile. 
Particles of silver and gold are dissolved. The pregnant solution flows to and collects in the 
pregnant pond. The nominal flow of cyanide solution is 10 l/hr/m2 and the design is based on 
11 l/hr/m2. 

23.2.8.1 Cyanide Solution Pumping 
The pH of the cyanide solution will be adjusted between 10.5 to11 and the cyanide concentration 
will be adjusted to 1000ppm. Also, 4ppm of antiscalant will be added. The solution will be pumped 
from the barren solution tank to the leach pad by means of one horizontal centrifugal pump. The 
process design includes two pumps; one on-line and the other on standby. Each pump has an 
adjustable-speed drive that varies the speed of the pump motor. 

Once the solution is delivered to the pad, the main solution pipeline will be divided in two parts to 
border the leach pad. Within the active leach cells irrigation systems will be installed. The solution 
that feeds the barren tanks will come from the Merrill-Crowe process and the concentration of 
cyanide will be adjusted to 1000 ppm. 

The process water required will be taken from the barren pond, storm water pond or fresh make-up 
water according to the requirement of the operation. One submergible pump will be installed in each 
pond. 

23.2.8.2 Pregnant Solution Collection 
The pregnant solution that percolates through the leach pad will be collected in a pregnant pond 
where floating vertical pumps will be installed. One pond is called pregnant pond and will collect 
high grade solution and the other one is an intermediate pond and will receive low grade solution. 

23.2.8.3 Pregnant Solution Pumping 
The pregnant solution will be pumped to the unclarified solution tank using two submergible vertical 
pumps. Each pump has an adjustable-speed drive that varies the speed of the pump motor. One of 
the pumps is on-line while the other is a standby spare.

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  116 

The floating vertical pumps will be installed on barges equipped with a special maintenance system. 
The barges will be steel platforms supported on floating polyethylene.  

23.2.9 Merrill-Crowe Plant 
The Merrill-Crowe process recovers silver and gold from the pregnant solution in form of precipitate. 
Zinc powder is added to the clarified and deaerated pregnant solution to precipitate precious 
metals. 

The design has considered a Merrill-Crowe plant to treat 571 m3/hr of pregnant solution containing 
silver and gold. The capacity of the plant assures the treatment of 10,000 tpd of silver ore from the 
pit. The precipitation process comprises the following stages: clarification, deaeration and 
precipitation with zinc dust. A simplified process flowsheet is provided as Figure 23.18. 

23.2.9.1 Clarification 
The unclarified pregnant solution will be pumped to the clarifiers at the rate of 571 m3/hr. The 
design considers two centrifugal pumps, one operating and other in standby. Each pump has an 
adjustable-speed drive that varies the speed of the pump motor. One of the pumps is on-line while 
the other is a standby spare. Clarifiers are three leaf pressure filters, two operating and one in 
standby. 

When one filter is saturated, the flow of solution will be sent to the third filter. At this moment the 
other filter will be cleaned and prepared to operate. This operation will be practiced in determined 
periods in order to assure the constant feed of pregnant solution to the clarifiers and avoid 
unexpected problems. It has been estimated that each filter will be cleaned 1 to 2 times daily. The 
resultant solids will be collected and recycled to the leach pad by a pumping system. 

Prior to the operation of the clarifying filter a pre-coat layer will be applied, this will be reinforced 
with the addition of body feed. During the filtration cycle, solid particles will be retained and the 
solution leaving the filter will contain 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) of suspended solids. 

When one filter is out of operation, it will be cleaned by pumping barren solution or process water. 
In this way, solids and remaining pre-coat will be removed. 

23.2.9.2 Deaeration 
The objective is to remove dissolved oxygen from the clarified solution. The elimination of oxygen is 
important in the precipitation process because an excess of oxygen will oxidize zinc particles and 
the efficiency of the precipitation process is affected. Other negative aspect is the presence of 
excessive quantities of suspended solids in the solution, which may passivate the surface of zinc 
particles. 

A vacuum tower will be employed as deaeration unit and will be equipped with control levels, 
distributor, support and fill. The vacuum is required to maintain a high vacuum within the tower and 
removes the oxygen from the solution. The clarified and deaerated solution is withdrawn from the 
bottom of the tower by a liquid sealed pump, which prevents re-entry of air. 

The solutions from the clarifiers contain approximately 8-ppm of dissolved oxygen and pass down 
while it is distributed around the diameter of the tower. The solution leaves the tower with less than 
1-ppm of dissolved oxygen.

23.2.9.3 Precipitation 
Zinc dust is used to precipitate precious metals by means of an electrochemical reaction. Lead 
nitrate is added to catalyse the reaction. Adequate zinc dust is required to provide a coherent 
deposit on the filter surface through which the silver bearing solution passes, to make certain that 
sufficiently close contact is made with the zinc particles to obtain maximum precipitation efficiency. 
Zinc dust, lead nitrate and sodium cyanide solution will be added in an emulsifying tank.  

The solution containing the precipitate will be pumped by means of liquid sealed centrifugal pumps 
to the filter presses. The design considers two pumps with variable speed, one operating and other 
in standby and its pumping capacity is 571 m3/hr of solution. The precipitate will be collected in 
three filter presses, equipped with 55, 1200 mm x 1200 mm plates, and designed to treat 191 m3/hr 
of solution. Two filters will operate and one will be in standby. The process flowsheet presented as 
Figure 23-17 indicates a forth filter press may be added to the system in the future. 

When one filter is saturated, the flow of solution will be sent to the third filter while the saturated 
filter is discharged, cleaned and prepared to operate. This operation will be practiced in determined 
periods in order to assure the constant feed of solution to the filters and avoid unexpected 
problems. The resultant solids will be collected, dried, and sent to the retorting stage. 

Before discharging the filter, air will be injected to reduce the moisture content of the precipitate. 
The solution from the filters will be recycled to the barren solution tank. 

23.2.10 Smelting Process 
The smelting process has been designed to produce Silver/Gold Dore bars with high silver content 
from the precipitates obtained through the Merrill-Crowe process. The smelting process includes 
retorts to eliminate mercury, an induction furnace, a gases collection system and slag treatment. 

23.2.10.1 Retorting 
The precipitate from the filter press contains mercury, which comes from the leaching process and it 
is recovered in the Merrill-Crowe plant. The design considers three retorts, which operate following 
heating and cooling stages. Table 23.6 details the retort process.

During the retorting process, air enters the retorts and collects all the gases. These gases will go to 
a first condenser equipped with a water cooling system and metallic mercury is precipitated to the 
mercury recovery tank. The gases report to a second condenser to assure the complete 
precipitation of mercury. The system includes a column loaded with granular activated carbon to 
collect any remaining mercury vapour. The retorting process will allow the release of gases without 
mercury content to the atmosphere. A gas extractor system will help to remove the gases. 

23.2.10.2 Smelting 
An induction furnace will be used to smelt the precipitate. Upon completion of the retorting process, 
the precipitate is dried and mixed with fluxes such as potassium nitrate, manganese dioxide, silica, 
sodium carbonate and fluorite. The charge is loaded into the crucible. The smelting process takes 
approximately 3 hours. The molten charge is poured in ingots and the final product of this process is 
a doré bar with high content of silver. 

The doré bars will be deposited in a safe room and will be transported to the market following a 
schedule, which will be determined with taking the silver production into account. 

The smelting process area includes a gas collection system to collect all the gases produced during 
the smelting process. 

23.2.11 Chemical Reagents 
The chemical reagents that will be used in the process are lime, sodium hydroxide, sodium cyanide, 
antiscalant, lead nitrate, and detoxification reagents (hydrogen peroxide, copper sulphate) to 
destroy cyanide and precipitate some compounds in the cyanide detoxification process. The 
reagents will be stored in three separated areas; one for lime, located near the leach pad; one for 
cyanide and sodium hydroxide, located near the process plant; and the last one will be used to 
store all the other reagents. 

23.2.11.1 Lime Addition 
Lime will be stored in a special area. One tonne bags will be transported by trucks near the crushing 
plant and leach pad. The main lime addition point will be the crushing plant and a dry reagent 
feeder will be used to add lime. 

23.2.11.2 Sodium Hydroxide 
Sodium hydroxide will be added to the sodium cyanide mix tank and the effluent detoxification 
process. Sodium hydroxide will be received and stored as a powder in 25-kg bags. Water and

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  120 

sodium hydroxide are added to a mixing tank to achieve a concentration of 30 percent. The 
preparation of sodium hydroxide will be completed in batches. A pump will be used to add sodium 
hydroxide solution to the sodium cyanide preparation tank. 

When the cyanide destruction plant operates, the sodium hydroxide solution will be pumped to the 
plant.  

23.2.11.3 Sodium Cyanide 
Sodium cyanide will be received and stored as briquettes in 1-tonne bags. Process water and 
sodium cyanide briquettes are mixed to achieve a concentration of 25 percent. A service hoist is 
used to discharge the contents of the bags through a charge chute and into an agitating mix tank 
with process water. The design considers two sodium cyanide preparation tanks. 

Pumps transfer sodium cyanide from the mix tank to the storage tank. Any spillage in the cyanide 
area is recovered in a sump and pumped to the mix tank. Circulating pumps provide a distribution 
loop for sodium cyanide use in the leaching circuit and Merrill-Crowe plant. Sodium cyanide is 
pumped through this loop at a controlled pressure. The unused solution returns to the storage tank. 
The design considers two pumps with variable speed with a capacity of 20 m3/hr of solution. 

23.2.11.4 Antiscalant 
Antiscalant will be used to avoid the formation of precipitates in the pipes, equipment and 
accessories of the process plant. The antiscalant solution will be added in the barren solution tank, 
pregnant pond and storm water pond. The addition of antiscalant will be permanent in the first two 
points. 

The concentration of antiscalant must be maintained between 5 and 10 ppm in the leaching and 
pregnant solutions. 

23.2.11.5 Lead Nitrate 
Process water and lead nitrate are mixed to achieve a concentration of 5 percent. The mixing tank 
will have a capacity of 0.36 m3. The solution will be sent to the emulsifying tank.  

23.2.11.6  Zinc Dust 
The zinc dust feed system comprises one bin and one screw feeder, which feeds the material to the 
emulsifying tank. The maximum capacity of the feeder will be 30.5 kg/hr and the estimated 
consumption of zinc dust is 17 to 25 kg/hr.  

23.2.11.7 Precoat 
Process water and diatomaceous earth are mixed to achieve a concentration of 0.3 to 2 percent. 
The mixing tank will have a capacity of 13.3 m3. The solution will be pumped to the clarifier filters or 
filter presses to form a layer of 1.5 to 10-mm on the filtration medium. The solution will recirculate 
between the pre-coat tank, clarifier filter or filter press. 

23.2.11.8 Body Feed 
Process water and diatomaceous earth are mixed to achieve a concentration of 0.5 to 5 percent. 
The mix tank will have a capacity of 11 m3. The solution will be pumped to the clarifier filters. 

23.2.11.9 Hydrogen Peroxide 
Hydrogen peroxide will be used in the effluent detoxification plant to destroy cyanide.

23.2.11.10 Copper Sulphate 
Process water and copper sulphate are mixed to achieve a concentration of 5 percent. The mixing 
tank will have a capacity of 200-m3. The solution will be pumped to the storage tank, which will have 
two pumps for supply to the effluent detoxification plant. 

23.2.11.11 Reagent Requirements 
Lime and Sodium 

Lime and Sodium Cyanide are the major reagents used in the heap leach Merrill-Crowe circuit. 
Table 16.9 presents the primary reagent consumptions projected for the p80 19mm crush size. 

Table 23.7 
Primary Reagent Consumption 

Reagent Consumption Addition Trim 

Lime (@ 80% CaO) 3.0 kg/t Crushing Heap or Barren Solution 
Sodium Cyanide 0.4 kg/t Barren Solution Barren Solution 

 

The lime consumption was estimated from the test program. The p80 19-mm columns had pH 
control problems at the initial addition rate of 2 kg/t. The 3.0 kg/t addition will assure that the heap 
will maintain the pH at 10.5 or above. The sodium cyanide requirement was derived from the 
column tests. Heap leach consumptions run from ¼ to 1/3 the column consumptions. 

Other Reagents 

The zinc powder requirement of 1g Zn/1g Ag was confirmed in tests at McClelland Laboratories, 
and utilized in the feasibility study. 

Operating Merrill-Crowe plants with the same tenor of silver in solution report requirements as low 
as 0.6g Zn/1g Ag. 

The reagent consumption was determined using information from metallurgical tests, stoichiometric 
calculation and experience on similar projects. 

23.3 Infrastructure 

23.3.1 Power 
Electrical power to the Santa Ana facilities will be provided from the Peruvian grid (Sistema 
Electrico Interconectado Nacional - SEIN) by a new line to be built connecting the existing Pomata 
substation in the town of Pomata to the Santa Ana substation. In addition, there will be 10kV 
primary lines and distribution substations. 

The electrical power transmission line will supply the power required for the future Santa Ana 
operations with a power of 6MW. 

The following facilities will be involved: 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  122 

• 60kV bars expansion of the existing Pomata substation and installation of connection 
equipment for the 60kV line to the Santa Ana substation; 

• 60kV transmission line from the existing Pomata substation to the Santa Ana substation, 
about 48.55 km of a three-phase circuit with two guard wires; 

• A new substation for the Santa Ana mining operation, which includes the installation of a 
transformation cell (step-down cell) 60/10/4.16kV - 5/5/1.7MVA (ONAN), 6.25/6.25/2.13 
(ONAF) and distribution cells in 10kV; 

• Communication systems; and 

• Emergency power will be provided by diesel generators. 

23.3.2 Access Road 
In order to develop the Santa Ana project, it will be necessary to improve the existing mine access 
road between the existing interstate highway and the project site. Additional mine site roads will 
also be necessary for daily operation of the mine. 

In general terms, the roads included in this study have a total width of 7,2m including a diversion 
ditch. The slopes along these access roads are generally intended to be kept between 4 and 10%. 
Due to the relative steepness of the property some roadway sections will require slopes as great as 
15% or more. Further details and technical data on the access road development are provided in 
the DFS Engineering Design Report (Ausenco Vector, 2010). 

23.3.2.1 Mine Access Road 
Access to the project site is proposed as improvements to an existing rural road that comes from 
the town of Huacullani and continues south, passing through the proposed Santa Ana mine site to 
permit the mobilization of heavy equipment and materials along the entire 4.3km length. This road 
improvement is relatively inexpensive as it gets closer to Huacullani, as the existing ground surface 
is very flat and the road alignment does not present many horizontal curves. This road improvement 
increases in costs as it approaches the mine site, where the ground is steeper and mainly rocky. 

23.3.2.2 Main Haul Road 
The main haul road runs from the end of the mine access road and has a total length of 1.3km until 
it joins the perimeter access road of the leach pad. Its location and alignment are strategic since 
complementary haul roads to the open pit and crusher join this access as well as the access road 
that goes to the offices and camp site. 

23.3.2.3 Auxiliary Access Road 
These roads are divided into two alignments: the first auxiliary access road has a length of 2.4 km 
starting from station 0+620 of the main haul road and finishing where the general offices are 
located. The second auxiliary access road has a total length of 2.6 km and connects the west side 
of the leach pad perimeter access road with the acid water treatment plant, after passing through 
the general offices and camp site. 

23.3.2.4 Diversion Access Road 
A diversion access road is planned to permit continued access to the south for local residents while 
maintaining proper mine site security and safety. This road alignment, a rerouting of existing traffic, 
starts at the end point of the main access road, located at the north of the leach pad, going around 
the upper slopes until it meets the existing road located on the south direction of the process ponds, 
for a total length of 5.6 km.

23.4 Geotechnical 
The civil structures of the area, such as the leach pad, waste dump, solution ponds and process 
plant, are located at an average elevation of 4200 m masl and cover an area bounded roughly by 
the UTM coordinates: 8,159,000 to 8,156,500 mN and 464,500 to 468,500 mE. Five predominant 
geotechnical (surficial) units have been identified within the project area. 

23.4.1 Geotechnical Units 
Moist grasslands composed of saturated moist organic soils have a surface thickness that varies 
from 0.20 to 2.00 m. These soil units vary from very wet to saturated and are located, specifically, 
along streams northeast and southeast of the leach pad, southeast of the waste facility area and 
within the footprint of the process plant and solution ponds. This material will require removal where 
it underlies project facilities. 

Colluvial deposits are distributed around the toe of rocky outcrops covering much of the proposed 
leach pad footprint and the access road alignments. Colluvium consists of soils whose formation 
was caused by gravity, or natural landscape degradation. These deposits consist of clayey sand 
with gravel, clayey gravel with sand and clay with gravel. Typical clay content consists of medium to 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  124 

high plasticity. Cohesionless material typically has loose to medium dense consistency. On-site 
colluvium is generally in a moist condition, with angular gravel fragments and scattered cobbles and 
boulders. Colluvium falls into the following Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) codes: SC, 
GC and MS. These materials are suitable for foundations. 

Less common are the alluvial deposits, which are present in small streams, tributaries and in the 
lower reaches of the heap leach pad area and process pond footprints. Alluvium consists of a thin 
layer of subangular gravel and sand, with some silt and clay. The alluvial soil is typically moderately 
dense, and classifies as USCS codes GM, SC, SM and CL-ML. 

Residual soils are the predominant geotechnical unit in the project area. Residual soils comprise 
much of the near surface material underlying the waste dump, much of the leach pad, solution 
ponds and process plant areas. Residual soil deposits are generated in situ through the alteration 
processes of bedrock units and comprise generally clay and clayey sand with low to medium 
plasticity, classified in the USCS as CL and SC. This unit is suitable for the heap leach pad, waste 
dump, solution ponds and process plant foundations depending on the degree of compaction that is 
required after stripping the surface. 

During the investigation the presence of bedrock was determined through the mapping of rocky 
outcrops, diamond drilling, and excavation of test pits. Bedrock is present at shallow depth in much 
of the study area including the location of the leach pad, waste dump, solution ponds and process 
plant. Bedrock underlying proposed project facilities is suitable for foundation purposes. 

23.4.2 Piezometric Level 
Based on field investigations within the proposed heap leach pad footprint, groundwater exists at 
depths from 1.45 to 13.30 m below the current ground surface. Artesian conditions were recorded in 
drillholeDH_SA10-107. In the area of waste rock facility the groundwater level was recorded 
between 0.85 m and 53.0 m. 

Groundwater was recorded during drilling between 0.0 m to 19.95 m in the area of the process plant 
and solution ponds. 

23.4.3 Foundation Level 
During the geotechnical investigations a recommended depth of excavation to the foundation was 
determined for the leach pad, waste dump, solution ponds and process plant. The criterion for this 
depth was based primarily on finding a rigid non-yielding foundation resulting in minimal differential 
settlement. 

Based on these investigations, the heap leach pad may be founded on the surface of the residual 
and colluvial soils deposits, bedrock and to a lesser extent alluvial deposits. According to drilling 
results, bedrock is located 19.10 m below the existing ground surface in the central part of the pad 
and less than 3.30 m in the northern and eastern sections. The bedrock ranges from 2.60 to 
11.30 m in depth in the western section of the pad and is of very poor quality near the surface, but 
improves with depth. 

The waste dump foundation is at minimal depth and is on residual soil surface and bedrock. Drilling 
indicates that the bedrock is between 1.0 and 4.0 m depth and is from very bad to bad quality at the 
surface, improving with depth.

The foundation level of the solution ponds is on residual and colluvial soils deposits, bedrock and to 
a lesser extent alluvial deposits. Drilling indicates that the bedrock is between 1.0 to 3.40 m in 
depth, and is very poor to poor quality at the surface, improving with depth. 

The process plant is next to the solution ponds, and the foundation is on residual soils and bedrock. 
Test pits and drilling indicate that the bedrock is found between 1.0 and 4.6 m in depth, and is of 
very poor to poor quality, improving at depth. 

The camp and offices are located approximately 500 m south of the solution ponds. The foundation 
level is on bedrock and colluvial deposits. Test pits indicate that the foundation level is 1.0 m above 
the colluvial material. 

23.4.4 Open Pit / Pit Slopes 
Geotechnical investigations were conducted for the Santa Ana open pit area, including: oriented 
core drilling, geomechanical and oriented core logging, and surface outcrop mapping and sampling. 
Select samples were delivered to a laboratory for estimating strength parameters of intact rock. 
These parameters assist in slope stability analyses of the proposed pit walls.  

The open pit area consists mainly of volcanic rocks, mostly andesite of porphyritic to aphanitic 
texture, and post-mineralization tuffs in the northwest side. Other minor lithologies found were 
quartz feldspar, hypabissal dikes, breccia and sandstone.  

A structural control as part of a syncline with NW-SE trend was observed, which crosses the 
southern part of the pit area. Predominant joint sets were found to strike NW, NS, EW and NE. 

From the field and lab investigation the rock mass was geomechanically characterized, finding a 
fractured to very fractured, but hard andesite; and low fractured but relatively weak post-
mineralization tuff. 

Slope stability was first evaluated through kinematic analysis to define the maximum bench face 
and interramp angles in each rock type, as a function of the potential sliding planes or wedges, and 
then through limit equilibrium analysis to verify or optimize the proposed interramp angles by 
analysing global slopes.  

Recommended interramp slope angles are 40° for sectors of low RQD rock mass by using a 
5 m single bench design, 43° for the post-mineralization tuff with high RQD and 44° for andesite 
with high RQD, the last ones permitting the use of a 10-m double bench design. 

For further optimization of the interramp slope angles, the geological model of the deposit and the 
geomechanical database need to be improved. A more detailed RQD model can be completed after 
training technical personnel to correctly gather this parameter in future drilling works, or as mining 
progresses. 

Open pit slope stability is sensitive to the estimated phreatic condition. Therefore, it is strongly 
recommended to maintain the phreatic surface as far as possible from the slope faces by 
implementing permanent horizontal drains and pumping water from the open pit bottom during 
operation. Installation of piezometers around the final pit area is recommended for monitoring the 
impact of the pumping and drainage measures during operation, and for permanent review of slope 
stability.

A monitoring program of displacements of the crest slopes, particularly those that are higher, is 
recommended as stability oriented control through frequent surveying of control points in the slopes 
from permanent survey stations. 

23.4.5 Heap Leach Facility Construction 
The leach pad and process ponds design was prepared by Vector in accordance with the design 
criteria provided by BCM and complementary data calculated or obtained from the various field 
campaigns. This design includes: 

• Definition of the design parameters for the leach pad; 

• Field geotechnical investigation; 

• Development of the ore stacking plan; 

• Stability analysis for the most critical sections; 

• Hydrological and hydraulic calculations for diversion channels; 

• Preparation of a water balance for the leach pad; and

23.4.5.1 Design Criteria and Approach 
The criteria and approach used to develop the DFS design of the heap leach pad were provided to 
Vector by BCM and are listed as follows: 

• The preferred heap leach pad location was selected from a previous Scoping Study (Vector, 
2009).); 

• Ultimate heap leach storage capacity equals approximately 42 million tonnes (MT) of crushed 
ore for an operational life of 11 years; 

• A daily production rate was estimated at 10,000 tpd or 3,650,000 tpy; 

• The first phase of the heap leach pad is designed for a 4.18 Mt capacity or the first year's 
production; 

• The ultimate heap leach pad will see two additional phases; 

• The ore stacking plan includes 7 m lifts stacked at the internal angle of repose of the ore 
(about 37°) with internal benches 81 m wide resulting in an overall slope of 2.5H:1V; 

• The ore lifts top surfaces of each ore lift was assumed to be horizontal; 

• The assumed ore density is 165t/m3; 

• Every phase of the heap leach pad will have a perimeter access road for materials 
transportation and construction activities; 

• On-site borrow sources have been identified for construction materials (such as low 
permeability soil, drainage gravel, etc.); 

• An underdrain system will be constructed beneath the entire heap leach pad footprint to 
control groundwater flow beneath the liner system; 

• The heap leach pad foundation will be covered with a composite liner system consisting of a 
300mm thick low-permeability soil and an overlying LLDPE geomembrane; 

• The minimum static design factor of safety for stability analysis of the heap leach pad is 1.5 
while the minimum dynamic factor of safety is 1.0; and 

• The maximum design earthquake (MDE) with a recurrence interval of 2,500 years or a 2 
percent probability of exceedance in 50 years was used to estimate the potential maximum 
seismic deformations of the heap leach pad during operational life.  

23.4.5.2 Leach Pad Materials Description 
Materials necessary for construction of the design heap leach pad are summarized in the following 
paragraphs. The DFS Engineering Design Report (Ausenco Vector, 2010) provides complete 
details.

Figure 23.21 
Santa Ana's Leach Pad Ultimate Phase Layout 

 

Low Permeability Soil 

A low permeability soil layer consisting of inorganic, mostly fine-grained soil will be placed 
immediately beneath the geomembrane liner. In order to prevent damaging the geomembrane, the 
maximum particle size shall be 38 mm. The material shall have a plasticity index of 15 percent or 
higher. This material shall be placed in horizontal lifts that ensures a thickness of 300 mm after 
compaction, moisture conditioned to within plus or minus 2 percent of the optimum moisture 
content, and compacted to a minimum of 95 percent of the maximum dry density (ASTM D-698).  

Rock Fill 

Rock fill will be used for erosion control structures discharging storm water flow from the diversion 
channels to the natural valleys. This material is anticipated to be obtained from inert mine waste 
materials with a value of D50 value equal to 250mm and will be mixed with concrete. 

Drainage Gravel 

The underdrain ditches will be a part of the heap leach pad design and will be filled with a granular 
material consisting of inorganic, free-draining, durable sand and gravel with a 38mm maximum 
particle size and a maximum of 5 percent fines. The material used will be inert and placed in 
maximum 1 m thick loose lifts.

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  129 

Anchor Trenches Fill 

Fill material used to backfill geomembrane anchor trenches will consist of the material excavated 
from the trenches and will be backfilled into the anchor trenches after the geomembrane installation 
is completed. There will be no lift placement, moisture conditioning or compaction requirements, 
except the top surface must be wheel-rolled by a rubber-tired backhoe or front-end loader to seat 
and seal the fill surface. 

23.4.5.3 Underdrain System 
The underdrain system will collect the flow of water beneath the heap leach pad and divert it 
downstream of the heap leach facilities. This system consists of a network of perforated HDPE 
pipes laid out in a "herringbone" pattern and placed in trenches filled with drainage gravel. The 
underdrain system must be constructed after the unsuitable materials have been removed from the 
facility limits and the final grading surface has been excavated. 

23.4.5.4 Liner System 
The design geomembrane is single-side textured 2 mm linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) 
geomembrane meeting the minimum requirements of the Geosynthetics Research Institute (GRI) 
standards. 

23.4.5.5 Solution Collection System 
Solution collection pipelines will lie on the installed liner system to collect and evacuate the solution 
draining down through the stacked ore to the process ponds. Solution collection piping is sized to 
adequately pass the assumed design solution flow and minimize solution hydraulic head on the liner 
system. The overdrain system is installed in a pattern similar to the underdrain system. 

23.4.6 Process Ponds Construction 
In accordance with established project design criteria and information collected during the field 
geotechnical investigations, process pond design included the following key components: 

• Definition of the design parameters for the process ponds; 

• Field geotechnical investigation; 

• Development of the ponds operational process; 

• Design of the process ponds and plant site platform; 

• Stability analysis for the most critical sections; 

• Hydrological and hydraulic calculations for the pond dimensions; 

• Preparation of a water balance for the process ponds; and 

• Earthwork volumes and materials quantities estimation. 

The Vector DFS engineering design report (2010) provides additional details on process ponds 
design. A brief description of the process ponds components follows.

Figure 23.22 
Santa Ana's Process Ponds Layout 

 

 

23.4.6.1 Design Criteria and Approach 
Key criteria and assumptions used to design the process ponds at the feasibility level are 
summarized in the following list: 

• The process ponds location was based primarily on favourable site conditions and proximity 
to the design location for the heap leach pad; 

• Three separate ponds comprise the process ponds, namely: the PLS pond, the ILS pond and 
the storm water pond with storage capacities of 17,750m3, 18,000m3 and 141,700m3, 
respectively; 

• Each pond has a minimum free board of 500mm without considering the perimeter safety 
berms; 

• Two sedimentation ponds are included to prevent sediments from entering the process 
ponds; one for the PLS pond and another for the ILS pond; 

• All the process ponds are interconnected with spillways that shall alleviate any overflow 
occurring in the PLS and/or ILS ponds; 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  131 

• Site borrow sources have been identified for specific construction materials (such as 
structural fill material, drainage gravel, etc.); 

• An underdrain system will be constructed underneath the limits of the process ponds and 
plant site platform to capture groundwater flow beneath these facilities; 

• The liner system for the PLS and ILS ponds consist of a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) as the 
low permeability soil layer and a double HDPE geomembrane system with a geonet layer 
between the two liners; 

• The liner system for the stormwater pond consists of a composite liner system based on a 
geosynthetics clay liner (GCL) and a HDPE geomembrane layer; 

• The PLS and ILS pond designs include a leak detection system integrated into the double 
liner system; 

• The minimum design static factor of safety for stability analysis of the process ponds is 1.5 
and the minimum dynamic factor of safety is 1.0; and 

• The maximum design earthquake (MDE) has a recurrence interval of 2,500 years or a 2 
percent probability of exceedance in 50 years) and was used to estimate the potential 
maximum seismic deformations of the process pond slopes during operational life. 

23.4.6.2 Process Ponds Materials Description 
Construction materials necessary for building the process ponds are similar to those described for 
the heap leach pad with the exception of the low permeability soil liner that has been replaced by a 
geosynthetic clay liner (GCL). 

23.4.6.3 Underdrain System 
The underdrain system for the process ponds is similar to the system described for the heap leach 
pad and consists of a network of HDPE perforated pipes set out in a "herringbone" pattern and 
placed in trenches filled with drainage gravel. The underdrain system must be constructed after the 
unsuitable materials have been removed from the facility limits and the final grading surface has 
been excavated. 

23.4.6.4 Liner System 
The process ponds will be lined in two different ways: the PLS and ILS ponds will have a double 
liner system while the stormwater pond will have a single composite liner. However, for both cases, 
the low permeability soil layer use beneath the heap leach pad liner system is replaced by a 
geosynthetic clay liner (GCL). GCL placement permits steeper side slopes for the ponds (up to 
1.5H:1V) in order to achieve more storage capacity within the same footprint. 

The PLS and ILS ponds will have a double geomembrane liner system with a geonet (which will 
serve as a leak detection layer) between them. The storm water pond will have a single 
geomembrane liner system. In both cases, the geomembrane will be a smooth, 1.5mm thick HDPE 
liner. 

23.4.7 Waste Rock Facility Construction 
Ausenco Vector designed a waste rock facility in accordance with design criteria provided by BCM 
and in accordance with industry standard practice. A summary of key design components follows: 

• Preparation of preliminary layouts for this facility; 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  132 

• Stability analysis of the waste rock facility's most critical sections; 

• Definition and sizing of preliminary water management structures; and 

• Estimation of earthwork, material quantities and costs for staged construction.  

The design of the waste rock facility is detailed in the DFS Engineering Design Report (Ausenco 
Vector, 2010) and is briefly summarized herein. 

Figure 23.23 
Santa Ana's Waste Rock Facility Layout 

 

 

23.4.7.1 Design Criteria and Approach 
The following summary items present key design criteria and assumptions used to develop the 
waste storage facility.  

• The waste dump location was determined as the most feasible as a result of a Scoping Study 
(Ausenco Vector, 2009) comparing several potential sites; 

• In accordance with the mine plan developed for BCM, the waste storage facility was design to 
contain approximately 95 Mt of uneconomic mined rock material; 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  133 

• The first stage of the waste rock facility is design to contain the first year's production of 
8.5 Mt; 

• During operations, haul trucks will deposit mine waste from the upper platform at the natural 
angle of repose estimated at 37° or 1.34H:1V (short term conditions); 

• The recommended final layout includes benches necessary to increase the overall side 
slopes to 2.5H:1V for long term slope stability conditions; 

• The minimum design static factor of safety for slope stability analysis is 1.5 while the 
minimum design dynamic factor of safety is 1.0; 

• Dynamic analyses utilize a maximum design earthquake (MDE) with a recurrence interval of 
2,500 years or a 2 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years. for during operational life 
conditions; 

• A waste rock facility diversion channel was designed to safely pass a 500-yr recurrence 
storm event; and 

• A sedimentation pond will be constructed downstream of the waste rock facility to collect 
surface water flow originating from the waste rock facility. The pond will provide a monitoring 
point prior to release to the environment. 

23.4.7.2 Waste Rock Facility Material Descriptions 
Construction materials necessary for the waste rock facility foundation include underdrain gravel 
and HDPE drain pipes. 

23.4.7.3 Underdrain System 
An underdrain system will be constructed at the waste rock facility to evacuate any shallow 
groundwater and contact meteoric water from the facility. Based on studies to date, Santa Ana mine 
waste has a very low acid generating potential. Therefore, a liner system and/or an effluent 
collection system are not necessary for the facility. 

23.4.8 Seismicity and Seismic Hazards 
Vector prepared a site-specific, comprehensive seismic hazard analysis as part of the FS (Vector, 
2010). The study was developed to review the tectonics of the project area, review available data 
on historical and instrumented seismicity, identify seismogenic sources, estimate the regional 
seismic attenuation effects, estimate the deterministic and probabilistic ground motions at the site 
and develop response spectra for both soil and rock conditions at the site. 

Tectonics is governed by the subduction mechanism in the southwestern region of Peru, where the 
Nazca plate dips beneath the South American plate with an average angle of 30º up to300 km in 
depth. Also, various faults systems have been recognized in the southern region of Peru. The 
nearest active fault to the project site is the Cuenca de Charaña fault, located 77km southward of 
the mine site, and the East Peñas fault, located 98km to the east. Although these faults have not 
been sufficiently studied, they are near surface faults with the potential to generate destructive local 
seismic effects. 

According to the reviewed seismic history of the project area, during the last 400 years earthquakes 
have occurred with intensities of up to modified Mercalli intensity, MMI=V. in the project area, 
although the area is scarcely populated and greater intensities not reported could have occurred. 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  134 

For the seismic hazard evaluation, subduction and continental sources have been considered, 
using different attenuation laws in each case. The seismic catalogue was updated to 2009. The 
nearest faulting systems have also been identified for analysis.  

The deterministic analysis estimates that the maximum credible earthquake at the Santa Ana 
project site will cause a peak ground acceleration of 0.32g in bedrock and 0.45g in very dense soil 
sites as a result of the intermediate and superficial subduction seismic activity, respectively. 

For the probabilistic analysis, updated seismic zonal sources have been identified. Due to scarcity 
of information on the seismic activity related to continental faults, these source zones have also 
been modeled as areas having similar seismic characteristics instead of discrete linear sources. 
Earthquake recurrence rates were calculated for each seismic source from the compiled historical 
catalogue. These parameters were used as input into the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. 
Results are presented in terms of ground motion as a function of annual exceedance probability, the 
reciprocal of the average return period. 

For the seismic design of common facilities in the Santa Ana project, a 475-year return period is 
recommended, which corresponds to a 10% probability of exceedance in a 50 year time period. 
Considering the site classification system proposed by the International Building Code (IBC, 2006), 
the peak ground acceleration for this return period at the project site is 0.25 g, 0.26 g and 0.43 g, for 
site classes B, C and D, respectively. Design ground motions at varying exposure levels have been 
estimated and detailed in the Seismic Hazard Study (Ausenco Vector, 2010) report. Selection of 
applicable return period events or perceived risk is beyond the scope of this report. 

23.4.9 Instrumentation and Monitoring 
In order to monitor the geotechnical behaviour of the projected facilities, survey instruments will be 
installed at strategic locations around the project area. The monuments will be surveyed routinely 
according to an established monitoring plan and the readings used to track movements with time. 
As these monitoring instruments are very important throughout the project life, a set of hydraulic 
piezometers, to monitor groundwater conditions and slope inclinometers have been proposed in an 
area downstream of the leach pad, process ponds and the waste dump. Details and locations of the 
instrumentation elements and the monitoring schedules are provided in the DFS Engineering 
Design Report (Ausenco Vector, 2010). 

23.5 Markets 
The principal commodity of silver is freely traded, at prices that are widely known, so that prospects 
for sale of any production are virtually assured. Silver is considered both a precious and industrial 
metal having increasing applications in industrial uses and high-technology sectors. The price of 
silver historically tracks gold; however, in recent years those ratios have been more volatile. BCM 
used the average silver price of US$14.50/oz. for the Base Case economic model which 
corresponds to an average forecasted long-term consensus price from 45 capital market analyses 
as of September 2010.

23.6 Environmental Considerations and Permitting 
The project has been designed to meet industry standards of environmental compliance. The heap 
leach and solution ponds have been designed industry standards of containment and stability. The 
waste rock storage facilities are designed to capture and manage any flows that may originate from 
the waste rock. Finally an initial closure plan has been developed that will provide covers for both 
the heap leach and waste rock facilities that will result in safe and environmentally compliant 
closure of the mine. The lab tests on spent ore and waste rock have shown that the site has a very 
low potential to produce acid rock drainage (ARD). 

The Company is currently advancing the permitting process and expects to submit the 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to the Peruvian authorities before the end of 
2010. All additional necessary permitting will be processed once the ESIA has been approved by 
the national government. 

The Company has maintained good working relationships with the local communities 

23.7 Health, Safety, Environment and Community 

23.7.1 Hydrogeological Evaluation 
Vector (2010) completed a feasibility-level hydrogeological evaluation of the Santa Ana project site, 
including: 

• Field Investigations: such as, permeability testing, piezometer and test well installations, 
mapping of springs, sampling for water quality, and groundwater level monitoring; and 

• Hydrogeological characterization: such as, estimates of permeability and aquifer parameters, 
estimates of groundwater recharge and discharge relationships, numerical groundwater 
modelling, and open pit infiltration estimates. 

23.7.1.1 Field Investigations 
Field investigations included drilling and installation of 15 groundwater piezometers and 2 test wells. 
Permeability testing (Lugeon and Lefranc) was performed during drilling and included 61 
permeability tests in open boreholes and installed piezometers. In addition, two pumping tests were 
conducted to evaluate potential water supply yield and aquifer parameters. Groundwater level 
monitoring was conducted during the period of April to August 2010. Groundwater samples were 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  137 

collected from a total of 9 points for water quality analysis. Surface water mapping included 
mapping of spring locations in the study area. 

23.7.1.2 Conceptual Hydrogeological Model 
The site is situated in a mountainous and previously glaciated area. Groundwater flow is strongly 
influenced by site topography with recharge and downward flow occurring within the highland areas 
and groundwater discharge and upward flow occurring within the stream bottoms. This pattern of 
flow is evidenced by both the measured piezometric surface in piezometers and relationships to 
springs and streams. Groundwater discharge to the streams supports flow during the dry winter 
months. Calculations of runoff, real evapotranspiration and total precipitation based on published 
climatic data, resulted in a value of effective infiltration (aquifer recharge) of about 0.12 mm/day (7% 
of total average annual precipitation). 

Unconsolidated sediments are confined to the valley bottoms and consist of alluvium, colluvium and 
glacial outwash with generally limited thickness (less than 1.0 to1.5 m) except in the Zorrillo River 
valley where a thickness of 18m was found in one of the exploration boreholes.  

Regional andesite bedrock typically has a low primary porosity. Permeability and storage are 
dependent upon degree of jointing, fracturing and faulting within the bedrock, which ultimately 
controls movement of groundwater. 

Based on results of testing, bedrock permeability measurements are variable, ranging from a low of 
approximately 10-7 cm/sec to a high of 10-2 cm/sec. In the areas of the Waste Rock Facility, Heap 
Leach Facility and proposed open-pit areas, observed bedrock permeabilities are relatively lower 
(with a geometric mean of 2 x 10-5 cm/sec). 

23.7.1.3 Simulation of Groundwater Inflow to Proposed Open-Pit Areas 
A groundwater model was constructed and calibrated to field water level measurements to: 1) 
confirm the conceptual hydrogeological model; 2) provide estimates of pit inflow rates; and, 3) 
evaluate potential groundwater impacts and potential needs for dewatering. The geometric mean 
and range of permeability values determined from the model calibration were in close agreement 
with field measurements.  

Using the steady-state calibrated groundwater model, a transient-state model was used to simulate 
groundwater inflow to the open pit during different stages of development including the end of 
mining. The projected pit inflow shows steady increases over the life-of-mine as the pit widens and 
deepens, reaching a maximum predicted inflow of 7.5 m3/hour (2 L/s) after 10 years of mining. 
Provided the small projection of pit inflow, requirements for pit dewatering will be minimal 

23.7.2 Water Supply 
The amount of fresh water required by the Santa Ana facilities is approximated at 73.8 m3/hour 
(20.5 L/s) with a peak delivery of 109.4 m3/hour (30.4 L/s). The well field and water supply pipeline 
will be designed for this peak demand.  

23.7.2.1 Water Well Fields 
Water quantities are limited and environmentally and socially sensitive in the region of the Santa 
Ana mine. Groundwater near the facilities was, therefore, not considered as a main source of water 
for the project; however an area does exist for auxiliary, short-term groundwater supply in fractured 
andesitic rocks if required.

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  138 

The primary water supply for the project will be from the basin-fill deposits of the Challacollo Valley 
along the Callacame River, which lies 7.8 km from the mining facilities (Figure 24.1). A 339 hectare 
parcel along the Callacame River was explored using surface resistivity geophysical methods. After 
completion of geophysics, a piezometer and a water supply test well were drilled in the area. 
Aquifer testing of the water supply test well was conducted for determination of aquifer parameters. 
Aquifer testing results were favorable and indicated that a well field in the area could produce on the 
order of 108 m3/hr (30 L/s) or more. Water samples collected from the test well were submitted to 
an internationally-approved analytical laboratory for analysis and the results indicate that the quality 
of the groundwater is suitable for anticipated mine uses, including public water supply. It is 
estimated a total of 3 production wells in the area will meet the water supply needs for the project, 
including back-up capacity. 

23.7.2.2 Water Pipeline 
The Santa Ana water supply and pipeline originates north-northeast of the proposed plant utilizing 
two 100m³ 125 hp well pumps capable of 194 m total dynamic head (TDH). The water is then piped 
for 12.2 km following existing roads to a water storage tank located approximately 60 m above the 
plant. Pipe for this project is 150 mm carbon steel, HDPE SDR 11 and SDR 17 and 200 mm HDPE 
SDR 9 depending on pressures in the line. This alignment will require two booster pump stations to 
overcome 374 m of static head and various head losses. Each booster pump will supply 100 m³/hr 
at 75 and 150 hp to overcome 136 m and 238 m of TDH respectively. Water from the storage tank 
will then flow to the plant by gravity.  

23.7.3 Waste Geochemistry 
This section discusses the geo-chemical characterization of waste rock material and of the 
materials which will make up the final pit surface. 

The objective of the study was to characterize representative waste rock material from the 
perspective of potential generation of acidity and/or leaching of metals in such a manner as to 
ensure that any negative effects are mitigated in a timely manner in the context of any future 
projects. 

23.7.3.1 Sampling 
The sampling criteria utilized corresponded to the most representative lithologies and alterations for 
both waste rock and the final pit surface. The lithologies sampled were andesite, quartz-feldspar-
porphyry (QFP) dikes and breccias.  

The sampling procedure included the identification of representative drillholes, integrating the 
information from vertical drilling (in accordance with geological sections) with horizontal information 
(geological mapping), in order to represent the waste rock area, the area which is not economically 
viable for exploitation and areas which BCM considers to be low grade (<20% Ag) or low ore zones. 

A list of boreholes representative of the entire waste rock deposit was obtained based on the most 
recent drilling plan, in order to minimize the effects of weathering (oxidation) on older drill samples.  

Sampling of the final pit surface considered the drillholes where the bottom of the pit was taken into 
account, in accordance with the pit design provided by BCM.  

The execution of the sampling plan is described in detail below:

• When considering waste rock, the segment corresponding to the waste rock was first 
identified, and then samples were taken every ten centimetres for every two meters of core 
samples; and  

• When considering the final pit walls, the segment to be sampled was identified, and a sample 
two meters in length was then extracted, taking half of the sample found in the core boxes.  

Thirty samples of waste rock material and 23 samples of the material which will make up the final pit 
surface were collected.  

23.7.3.2 Results 
The materials analyzed contained low levels of both sulfur and sulphide(<0.24%),and are made up 
of materials such as quartz, clays, and aluminosilicates, which are very stable materials, and slow 
to react in terms of acid consumption. The presence of barite in these samples calls for caution, due 
to its association with the presence of base metal sulphides, such as the sphalerite and galena 
encountered in samples of the QFP dike and the Andesitic Lava materials.  

Mn, Sr, and Zn could be considered elements of interest in the analysis conducted of total metallic 
elements present and short term leach testing. However, further analysis must be conducted on 
these elements, given that their potential to dissolve is conditioned by the manner in which this 
waste is disposed of affecting the oxygen reducing conditions of the surrounding environment, and 
other factors. The high Pb content (750-4160 ppm) encountered in solid samples should be taken 
into account, even though the pH of the surrounding environment remains neutral, a factor which is 
not considered conducive to the release of this metal. 

Kinetic tests were conducted on two composites of the material which will make up the final pit 
surface, on fractured sandstone. For 23 weeks of pH testing, values remained within the 5.17 to 
6.68 range (near-neutral). Sulphide levels did not exceed 27 mg/L, which is indicative of the fact 
that oxidation in the cell developed at a slow rate. For metal leaching, the mobility of elements such 
as lead (Pb), magnesium (Mn) and zinc (Zn) was evaluated, the results of which are included in the 
Acid Rock Drainage study conducted by Ausenco Vector (2010). 

23.7.3.3 Conclusions 
The results of this study indicate that the pH of effluents that come into contact with the model 
waste materials tested will remain in near-neutral conditions over the long term, and the monitoring 
of elements such as Mn, Sr, Zn and Pb throughout the length of mine operations is recommended 
in order to determine the mobilization potential of metals in any effluent discharge.  

23.7.4 Closure 
Closure legislation (Peruvian Law 28090) requires that every mining operation must have an 
approved closure plan and financial guarantees capable of covering the estimated closure costs. 
The closure plan must be developed and submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) 
within a year of the approval of the ESIA, and must be approved by the MINEM prior to receipt of 
permission to operate. 

The ESIA is required to include a conceptual closure plan for the operation, with the objective of 
ensuring the physical and chemical stability of the diverse components of the project after closure 
and returning the environment to a condition similar to that found before implementation of the 
project.

J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  140 

The plan must address progressive, final and post closure stages, and also include a contingency 
plan in the event of temporary or early closure. 

23.7.4.1 Reclamation and Closure by Facility 
The principal activities at closure relate to the open pit, leach pad, and waste stockpiles, assuring 
physical and geochemical stability, including appropriate measures to mitigate the impacts of acid 
generating material (such as construction of low permeability cover systems).  

Typical principal closure activities likely for the project, based on the FS design, are described 
below. More assessment will be required in conjunction with detailed level engineering and the 
development of the ESIA for the project. 

Open Pit 

The open pit must be hydrologically and hydrogeologically analyzed in order to determine if the 
groundwater and precipitation reporting to the pit during closure and post-closure phases could 
accumulate and create a lake. These studies will provide the volumes of water that will be 
discharged. It is assumed that for the pit the following principal closure activities will be required: 

• Reshaping of parts of the pit; and 

• Construction of water management structures. 

Leach Pad 

For the leach pad, it is assumed that the following principal closure activities will be required: 

• Reshaping slopes of the leach pad; 

• Construction of water management structures; 

• Installation of a low permeability cover system; and 

• Revegetation of the leach pad area. 

Waste Rock Facilities 

It is assumed that for the Waste Rock Facilities (WRF) the following principal closure activities will 
be required: 

• Reshaping of WRF slopes; 

• Construction of water management structures, where needed;  

• Installation of organic or inert cover soils over the WRF; and 

• Revegetation of the WRF. 

Processing Areas and Buildings 

In addition, the closure plan provides for demolition of facilities and most constructed infrastructure, 
and leveling of the affected areas. It is assumed that for the plant and processing areas, office 
buildings and camp site, the following principal closure activities will be required: 



 

Rev: 0 
Date: October 2010 
J07.82.13.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  141 

• Demolition and/or removal/disposal of structures; 

• Reshaping/grading of disturbed areas; 

• Installation of organic cover soils;  

• Revegetation of disturbed areas; and 

• Construction of water management structures, where required. 

General 

Depending on the requirements of government regulators and the local communities, it is possible 
that ownership of some of the infrastructure, i.e. the electrical transmission line, camps, and road 
access might be transferred to the community for its use post-closure. 

23.7.4.2 Post Closure 
Post-closure refers to the monitoring and maintenance following completion of closure activities, 
which verify compliance with the closure objectives. 

23.7.4.2.1 Maintenance 
After the final closure, a minimum 3 year period of active maintenance must follow, in order to 
ensure both the physical and chemical stability of the mine site. It is recommended that a team is 
made responsible for maintenance and should remain on site during this period. Once active 
maintenance has been completed, a passive maintenance stage will begin, during which the team 
will carry out inspections and periodic work. A minimum of 2 years is required for this stage.  

The maintenance team should be composed of an engineer and a group of workers. They will be 
required to monitor the physical and chemical stability of the closed components and carry out any 
maintenance activities required. 

23.7.4.2.2 Monitoring 
The maintenance team must permanently monitor the facilities during the active closure stage and 
periodically monitor during the passive closure stage. 

23.8 Project Execution 
The project will be developed into a mine over the next 24 months. The figure below illustrates the 
major parts of the development plan. First the company will present the ESIA to the Peruvian 
authorities prior to the end of 2010. There will then be a period of review by the government that is 
expected to last 6 to 9 months. In late 2010 and early 2011, the detailed project engineering will 
commence and is estimated to be completed in approximately 9 months. Following ESIA approval 
the Company will advance the permitting process by obtaining the necessary construction and 
operating permits. In late 2011, once the proper permits are obtained, the principal off-site project 
infrastructure will developed. This will include the power line, the upgrading of the access road, the 
construction of the water supply pipeline and drilling of any additional production water wells. Any 
temporary construction housing will be installed in preparation for the on-site construction. Finally, 
the onsite construction will start in the 2nd quarter of 2012 or earlier depending on the end of the 
rainy season and continue through the dry season. Commercial production will start in early part of 
the fourth quarter of 2012, or earlier if the rainy season permits liner installation sooner.

23.9.1.4 Capital Cost Summary 
The project capital cost estimate has been prepared by two independent engineering companies. 
The mining costs were prepared by Independent Mining Consultants of Tucson, Arizona, and the 
process heap leach and infrastructure costs have been prepared by Ausenco Vector of Peru. The 
initial startup capital is estimated to be $68.8 million and the total life of mine capital cost is 
estimated to be $83.8 million. The initial capital equates to $1.56 per ounce of silver recovered. The 
life of mine capital costs used in the financial model include detailed long-term plans for heap leach 
expansions as well as ongoing mine closure and monitoring. Sustaining capital expenditures are 
estimated at an average $1.4 million per year over the 11-year life of the mine. 

Tabulated below are the Capital costs for each of the principal areas.

period to provide for the cash disbursement for expenses prior to the cumulative revenue offsetting 
the cumulative expenses; that is, when the operation becomes self-sustaining in its cash flow. 

The revenue was calculated on a weekly basis, based on the leaching cycle of the material. The 
following ramp-up resulted: 

• Month 1: 0 percent production; 

• Month 2: 71 percent production; 

• Month 3: 83 percent production; 

• Month 4: 89 percent production; 

• Month 5: 91 percent production; and 

• Month 13: 100 percent production. 

Revenue was projected based on receipt of 100 percent of production revenue, five weeks after the 
shipping date. Weekly shipment of product starts six weeks after ore crushing begins. 

Average weekly expenditure rates were calculated from the operating costs for Year 1. The 
processing and G&A labour costs were calculated as being disbursed on average every two weeks; 
transport, treatment and refining cost for product were calculated by reducing revenue payments. 
100% of contract mining, 33% of processing and 25% of G&A costs were calculated as weekly 
disbursals; the balance of expenses were timed to be expended one month after being invoiced. 

The largest deficiency of funds would occur in Week 10, at an amount of $6,654,870. This working 
capital cost was input into the economic cash flow, in production year +1. 

23.9.1.7 Base Case Analysis 
The base-case financial model was developed on information presented in this report as listed in 
Tables 23.9, 23.10, 23.11, 23.12. 

The NPV at a discount rate of five (5%) percent (pre-tax) over the assumed mine life is 
$85,283,009. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 25.3 percent before income tax, depreciation and 
IGV. Payback is estimated to be approximately 3.4 years after start of production. The base-case 
sensitivities according to discount rate are presented in Table 23.13

23.9.2 Taxes and Royalties 
Along with the pre-tax financial model, a financial model was prepared that incorporated the 
prevailing Peruvian corporate tax regime and took into account the current tax situation of the 
holding company of the Santa Ana project. Only losses and expenses that can be used by the 
current holding company of the Santa Ana project were used, no additional tax advantages were 
used that could be applied from other projects were used. 

The assumptions used in calculating the taxes were as follows. 

• The Peruvian production royalty was applied to the gross revenue at 1% for the first $60 
million of annual revenue, 2% on the next $60 million (increment of revenue $60 to $120 
million) and 3% to any revenue above $120 per year; 

• All capital was depreciated using straight line depreciation per year of 15%, with 10% being 
applied in year 7; 

• $23.96 million of pre-production expenses were amortizes over the life of the project on a 
silver ounces units-of-production basis; 

• Peruvian mandatory employee profit sharing of 8% is applied to the net profits. This cost is a 
pre-tax expense; 

• A 30% Peruvian corporate tax was applied to the net profits; 

• The company will have $14.414 million in tax loss carry-forward available in 2013 and this 
was applied in financial model to reduce payable taxes until the balance was reduced to zero; 
and 

• In Peru the there is a value added tax called the IGV which is applied to all goods and 
services at a rate of 19%. The company can recuperate this tax as the production will be 
exported. The company will have a credit of $8.442 million that will be recuperated once 
commercial production starts. In addition, a total of $13.068 million in IGV will be paid during 
construction of the project. The Company can recuperate these taxes based on 19% of the 
gross revenues in the early years of production. In the financial model, the IGV is recuperated 
in the first 2 years of operation. 

In the financial model, the company will pay $6.46 million in Peruvian production royalty, $9.06 
million in mandatory employee profit sharing and $31.3 million in corporate income tax. 

23.10 Opportunities 

23.10.1 Finer Crushing 
Bear Creek has completed six column leach test at McClelland Labs and over one-hundred leach 
amenability tests. The results have consistently demonstrated that the Santa Ana ore responds well 
to conventional heap leaching techniques. The overall recovery is expected to be 70% silver for 
minus 19mm (¾ inch) crushed material. More recent column tests indicate that further 
improvements in recovery to 75% silver can be achieved by crushing the ore to minus 9.5mm 
(3/8 inch). The preliminary results of the finer crushed column tests are shown in Figure 16.2 and 
the increased recovery rate is clearly evident from this test.  

McClelland Laboratories is currently performing a column test on minus 9.5mm (3/8 inch) crushed 
material. The 168hr. bottle roll test preliminary results indicated an 11.3% recovery gain over the 
p80 19mm bottle roll tests. A portion of the recovery gain can be attributed to faster leaching at the

J078213.02: Feasibility Study – NI 43-101 Technical Report – Santa Ana Project  151 

smaller size. The column test at p80 9.5mm through 49 days of leaching had extracted nearly as 
much silver as the p80 19mm column did in 144 days of leaching. The column work holds the 
promise of increasing the final silver recovery by 5% in one half of the leach time. BCM will release 
the results when this long-term test is finished. Initial results strongly indicate an improvement in 
recovery and acceleration of the silver leaching. 

Reducing the crushed ore size to a minus 9.5mm product (3/8 inch) involves capital cost 
expenditures for a necessary third crusher stage adding approximately $2M in capital cost and 
0.30/t in operating costs. With the additional recovery of silver this should result in a reduction in 
cash costs per ounce by $0.30 from the base case. Additional cost savings (not calculated) would 
be realized in reducing the amount of recirculation of solutions needed to complete the leach cycle. 

Figure 23.25 below shows the recovery by grain size fraction achieved in the last ¾ inch (19mm) 
column leach test performed at McClelland Labs. It clearly shows that there is a large improvement 
in the recovery of silver when the material is crushed fine. This is why it is anticipated that there will 
be an increase in recovery when the crush size is reduced from ¾ of an inch (19 mm) to 3/8 of an 
inch (9.5 mm).

Silver Recovery vs. Ore Grain Size 

 

23.10.2 Northern Extension 
The Company discovered a new style of base metal-rich mineralization in the northwest portion of 
the project 4 holes (SA-221, SA-222, SA-241 and SA-241A). The location of these four holes is 
shown in Figure 23.8 and the grades of the mineralized sections are tabulated below. This new 
zone includes abundant fine sulfide mineralization containing higher lead and zinc than is common 
in the central zone of the South Anomaly. This new zone trends towards the Northern Anomaly 
which has been a target for exploration for some time but has received only surface mapping and

prospecting up to this time. The Company plans to expand its exploration efforts in this area to 
identify targets for future expansions of the mine plan.

23.10.3 Longer Mine Life 
IMC prepared an alternative mine plan to the base case and it is discussed in detail in Section 
23.1.6.2. Figure 23.28 shows the amounts of recoverable ounces of silver placed on the pad. Since 
both plans have a similar stripping ratio of approximately 2:1 this shows that the mine could be 
extended easily at the latter years of the project. The base case leaves 36 million ounces of 
measured and indicated silver resources in either stockpiles or pit walls that can lead to expanded 
mine life on the order of 50%. Relatively minor additional capital will be required in order to increase 
the size of the heap leach pad and waste dump sites for which there is ample area for expansions. 

Figure 23.28 
Current Mine Plan Production vs. Extended Life Alternate Plan 

 

23.10.4 Deep Potential 
The mineralization at Santa Ana is controlled within wide structural corridors where the rock has 
been structurally shattered creating high permeability that was flooded with carbonate and silver 
mineralization. Many of the exploration holes end in ore-grade mineralization leaving the 
mineralization open for expansion at depth. Furthermore, high-grade structural feeder zones 
providing a source for the mineralizing fluids potentially underlie this large ore body and are 
considered targets for higher grade underground mining targets. The company will be targeting 
deep holes that will determine what type of mineralization occurs at depths of 300m to 400 m below 
the surface during 2011.
