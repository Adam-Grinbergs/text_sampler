  3 Summary  
This technical report has been prepared at the request of Messrs. James Dawson 

and Michael Mann on behalf of QMC Quantum Minerals Corp. ("QMC") (formerly 
0680742 BC Ltd.) A major exploration program at a total cost of $967,500.00 and 
including a diamond drilling program (2,500 metres) has been recommended. The 
proposed program is based on the surface Pulse EM Survey completed by Crone 
Geophysics and Exploration Ltd., who recently completed a total of 23 km. of Pulse 
Electromagnetic (PEM) surveying. In addition to the ground PEM program, 4920776 
Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of QMC has completed 33.5 km. of linecutting to facilitate the 
geophysical survey.  

The technical information on the Rocky Lake VMS Project in this report is 
derived from the Crone Exploration & Geophysics report on the PEM survey (Ralph, 
2007) and a report by Pelton (2007). Other information comes from the Assessment Files 
of the Industry, Economic Development and Mines of the Province of Manitoba as well 
as published technical and professional papers.  
 The Rocky Lake VMS Property consists of Mineral Exploration License No. 
219A, Jaln 1 Claim No. MB 7972 ("Jaln"), Exploration Licenses No. 358A, 359A, 360A 
and 361A   issued by the Government of Manitoba. License 219A was issued on 13 th 
April 2005 and  Jaln Claim was issued on 23rd January 2008 to 4920776 Manitoba Ltd., a 
private company. Payments have been made to extend License 219A to 13 th April 2008, 
after which it can be extended further. On October 16, 2008 QMC entered into an 
amended and restated property option agreement replacing an agreement dated for 
reference April 5, 2006 with 4920776 Manitoba Ltd., pursuant to which QMC acquired 
an option to acquire, subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty, a 100% interest in 
Mineral Exploration License 219A known as the Rocky Lake project and Jaln Claim.  To 
exercise the option QMC agreed to pay an aggregate of $242,500 and issue an aggregate 
of 450,000 Common Shares (or make payments of an aggregate of $195,000 in lieu of 
issuing 450,000 Common Shares) of QMC  payable over a four year period 
 On October 13, 2010 QMC entered into two amended and restated property 
option agreements with Balraj Mann, the President of QMC, replacing two agreements 
dated for reference October 31, 2008 pursuant to which QMC was granted an option to 
acquire, subject to a 2.5% net smelter return (the "Rocky-Namew NSR"), a 100% interest 
in Mineral Exploration Licenses 358A and 359A issued by the Government of Manitoba 
known as the Rocky-Namew property immediately surrounding Mineral Exploration 
License 219A (the "Rocky-Namew Property"); and an option to acquire, subject to a 
2.5% net smelter return (the "Namew Lake NSR"), a 100% interest in Mineral 
Exploration Licenses 360A and 360A issued by the Government of Manitoba located 
immediately to the north of Mineral Exploration Licenseses 358A and 359A and known 
as the Namew Lake property (the "Namew Lake Property"). 

To exercise the options under each of the agreements, QMC agreed to pay an 
aggregate of $485,000 and issue an aggregate of 900,000 Common Shares of the 
Company payable over a two year period in respect of each Option Agreement. 

 The Rocky Lake Property is located in northwestern Manitoba, 50 km. northwest 
of The Pas (figures 1 and 2). The mining centre and smelter at Flin Flon is located 65 km. 
to the north and the Namew Lake Ni-Cu mine is located 11 km northwest. Access is 
excellent: The Pas – Flin Flon highway (# 10) passes 14 km. east of the property, and the 
Hudson's Bay Rail line is 15 km east of the property. The property is accessible by all 
terrain vehicle (ATV) year-round, and by 4-wheel drive in the dry summer season and in 
winter. Infrastructure in the form of human resources, goods, services and transportation

are all readily available at The Pas. The smelter at Flin Flon could be available to process 
ore or concentrate that might be produced.  

Currently the main target on the Rocky lake VMS Property is a copper 
occurrence with interesting copper values intersected by Hudson Bay Exploration and 
Development Company in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Ten holes were drilled over a 
length of 1 km., with the best intersection encountering 10.3 metres grading 0.38% Cu 
(including 4.3 metres @ 0.67% Cu) in RES-122. The intersection contained high-grade 
sections (up to 3.0% Cu across 0.3m) within the 10.3 m intersection. The prospect is 
hosted in the Namew Gneiss Complex, highly metamorphosed rocks believed to be 
derived from Amisk Group volcanic rocks, the hostrocks to the world-class VMS Flin 
Flon-Snow Lake mining district. The Crone PEM survey suggests that some of the 
strongest portions of the original Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company 
electromagnetic anomaly were not adequately tested and that additional drilling is 
strongly warranted.

In the writer's opinion, the Rocky Lake VMS property is of sufficient merit to justify 
additional exploration expenditures. A recommended exploration program totalling $ 
967,500.00 would consist mainly of a diamond drill program totalling 2,500 metres. Prior 
to the diamond drilling an airborne electromagnetic-magnetic survey and limited ground 
geophysical surveying is recommended. 

 
  4 Introduction and Terms of Reference 

This technical report has been prepared at the request of Messrs. James Dawson 
and Michael Mann on behalf of QMC of Suite 600 – 666 Burrard St., Vancouver, B.C., 
V6C 2X8. The writer was contracted by Mr. Dawson to prepare a report on the Rocky 
Lake Property in October 2007. 

The report has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of National 
Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1 and is intended to be used as supporting 
documentation to be filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the TSX 
Venture Exchange. The purpose of this filing is to fulfill the qualifying requirements for 
the Rocky Lake Property and to support recommendations for an exploration program 
totalling $967,500.00. 

4920776 Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of QMC has completed a program of  
linecutting and a ground Pulse Time Domain Electromagnetic (PEM) survey by Crone 
Geophysics and Exploration Ltd. Expenditures to date total more than $172,000.00 and 
including the following: 

 

 
 
 
 

  
A $32,250.00 cash-in-lieu payment has been made to the Manitoba Government 

but will be returned to the company  following the submission of the Assessment Report 
covering the linecutting and Pulse Electromagnetic survey recently completed by 
4920776 Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of QMC 

In addition to a review of available historical data, the writer visited the Rocky 
Lake Property by helicopter on 25 October 2007 in the company of Mr. Warren Heidman 
of The Pas, Manitoba. Several outcrops of buff-coloured Ordovician dolomite were 
examined as well as the drill casing from HBM&S diamond drill holes RES 238 and RES 
198. To the best of the writer's knowledge, no work was carried out from January 05, 
2008 to August 18, 2010 and therefore there is no change to the scientific and technical 
information about the Rocky Lake property. 

Units of measure in this report are metric; monetary amounts referred to are in

  5 Reliance on Other Experts - Disclaimer 

This report is based on a review and digital compilation of publicly available and 
private historical data on the Rocky Lake Property, primarily from the Assessment Files 
of the Department of Industry, Economic Development and Mines of the Province of 
Manitoba. The geophysical surveys, drilling and assaying were all undertaken under the 
supervision of the Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company, a subsidiary of 
the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company (HBM&S).  HBM&S was a highly 
reputable mining company with high technical standards. HBM&S employed qualified 
technical people and modern geophysical, geological and assaying techniques. The author 
has no reason to question the technical standards employed in the work, but cannot 
personally verify the quality of the HBM&S work. 

The Surface Pulse EM Survey completed by Crone Geophysics and Exploration 
Ltd., an Ontario based contractor and leader in advanced electromagnetic survey 
techniques since 1962. Mr. Kevin Ralph, a 1992 graduate from the Department of 
Geology and Geophysics of Memorial University - Newfoundland, and a registered 
Professional Geoscientist in the Province of Ontario, prepared the Crone report. The 
geophysical survey parameters were formulated and the results interpreted by Dr. 
William Pelton, a well-known geophysicist with more than 40 years of international 
geophysical consulting experience. The author has no reason to question the technical 
standards employed in the geophysical survey work, nor in the interpretation by Dr. 
Pelton, but cannot personally verify the quality of the work. 

The author accepts the validity of the HBM&S and Crone Geophysics and 
Exploration Ltd and knows of no reason that it should not be accepted as high-quality 
technical data.   

Although the author is satisfied that this data was collected and processed in a 
professional manner following HBM&S and the standards of professional geophysical 
practices applicable, and that the historical data gives an accurate indication of the nature, 
style and possible economic value of known mineral occurrences on the property, there 
may be information not available to the author that could be of importance for evaluation 
of the property. The author disclaims any responsibility for any errors or omissions that 
are a result of missing, inaccurate or incomplete information. 

The author confirmed the validity of Mineral Exploration License 219A on the 
Manitoba Industry, Economic Development and Mines website on 06 January 2008 (see 
figure 2) and has no reason to believe that it is not currently in good standing. However 
there has been no title search and the author is not aware if encumbrances have been 
registered against the Property.  

Details of agreements currently in effect on the Rocky Lake VMS Property were 
provided by Mr. James Dawson, a Vancouver-based consulting geologist, who is also one 
of the property vendors and a director of 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. The writer disclaims 
any responsibility for the accuracy of this information.

  6 Property Description 
 6.1 Exploration License No. 219A 

   The following information on the option agreements has been obtained from Mr. 
James Dawson (Dawson, 2007 & 2009), one of the property vendors and a director of 
4920776 Manitoba Ltd. A copy of Mineral Exploration License No. 219A is attached to 
this report as Appendix 1. The author cannot verify whether the information is complete 
and accurate, but has no reason to believe it is not.  
   The Property consists of mineral tenures, Mineral Exploration License No. 219A 
and Jaln Claim issued by the Government of Manitoba in accordance with Part 3 of 
Mineral disposition and Mineral Lease Regulation MR64/92, to explore and develop all 
minerals found in place, or the property of the Crown in the right of the Province of 
Manitoba. The 219A Exploration Permit covers an area of 5,000 hectares and the Jaln 
Claim 256 hectares . The boundary co-ordinates of the Exploration Permit 219A are as 
follows: 

    
Boundary Point Easting Northing 

1 337,900 6,012,500 
2 328,000 6,004,600 
3 325,605 6,007,800 
4 335,500 6,015,600 

NAD 83, Zone 14 
 
The perimeter area of common interest surrounding Mineral Exploration License 219A 
and Jaln Claim is occupied by four mineral tenures; namely Mineral Exploration Licenses 
358A and 359A, immediately surrounding License 219A and Licenses 360A and 361A 
immediately located to the north of 358A and 359A (figure 2A).  Claim boundaries are 
marked by blazing trees and erecting wooden claim posts around the perimeter of the 
claims in accordance to Manitoba staking regulations. Witness posts are used to mark 
posts that cannot be placed due to water or some other obstacle. 
 Mineral Exploration License 219A was issued on 13 April 2005 and  Jaln Claim 
was issued on 23rd January 2008 to 4920776 Manitoba Ltd., a private company. All the 
licenses and the claim are currently held in good standing - a cash-in-lieu payment of 
$6,250.00 was made on April 10, 2006 and a second payment-in-lieu of $25,000.00 was 
made on March 23, 2007 to maintain the Permit in good standing. These monies were 
refunded after the assessment work described in this report and in Ralph (2007) are filed 
with the Manitoba Industry, Economic Development and Mines. Mineral Exploration 
License 219A expires on April 13, 2011 and the Jaln Claim expires on 23rd January 2011.  
With reference to surface rights on the Mineral Exploration License 219A and the Jaln  
Claim , it appears the license and the claim area are free and clear with no owners of 
surface rights. 
 Mineral Exploration Permits are issued in Manitoba for a term of 3 years and are 
renewable for an additional 3 years. Expenditure requirements are $1.25/ha during year 1, 
$5.00/ha during year 2, $7.50/ha during year 3, $10.00/ha during year 4, $12.50 during 
year 5 and $15.00 during year 6. The Permit can be reduced to mineral claims at any time 
up to the date of expiry. Assessment credits from the Mineral Exploration Permit are 
applied to the new claims. In Manitoba, claims require exploration expenditures of 
$12.50 per hectare per year in the first 10 years in order to maintain title. Cash can be 
paid in lieu of exploration work. In the 11th year and yearly thereafter exploration 
expenditures increase to $25 per hectare.

 Copper mineralization at Rocky Lake prospect was discovered by HBM&S 
through the drilling of a 1500 metre long geophysical ground EM conductor delineated 
on Exploration License 219A.  The conductor was located through the ground follow-up 
of a 5 km. long airborne EM conductor.  The mineralized zone intersected in drilling is 
not exposed on surface.  Enough exploration drilling was not carried out to delineate any 
mineral resources and to calculate mineral reserves.  Mine workings, waste deposits, 
related tailings ponds, natural features and infrastructure improvements do not appear to 
exist on the property. 

The author cannot verify whether the above information is complete and accurate 
but has no reason to believe it is not.

  7 Location, Accessibility, Climate, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 

The Rocky Lake Property is located in northwestern Manitoba, 50 km. northwest 
of The Pas (figures 1 and 2). The mining centre and smelter at Flin Flon is located 65 km. 
to the north. The Namew Lake Ni-Cu mine is located 11 km northwest of the Rocky Lake 
Property.  

Access is excellent, The Pas – Flin Flon highway (# 10) passes 14 km. east of the 
Property. From highway # 10, the Namew Lake road extends west for 12 km. to a point 5 
km north of the area of drilling. The final 5 km. is by bush track which is accessible by all 
terrain vehicle (ATV) year-round, and by 4-wheel drive in the dry summer season and in 
winter. The Hudson's Bay Rail line (formerly CNR) is located 15 km east of the property.  
 The town of The Pas is a major regional centre with an area population of  
16,000. It has a major airport with several daily scheduled flights by Calmair and 
Bearskin Airlines, trucking, health care, professional and financial services as well as 
commercial retail facilities.  The Pas is located at he junction of the Carrot and 
Saskatchewan Rivers and has been a major centre for the fur trade since the 18th Century. 
The main industry is forestry, with the main employer Tolko Industries Ltd. with major 
employment in logging, sawmill and in a pulp and paper mill. Commercial fishing, 
farming, tourism and minor trapping also provide employment.  

The area has typical northern continental climate with warm summers and harsh 
cold winters. It is within the Boreal Plain Ecozone, with a gently rolling landscape 
characterized by lacustrine deposits and hummocky to kettled glacial moraine. Extensive 
clear lakes and wetlands are characteristic of the area. Rocky Lake is at an elevation of 
261 metres – relief in the area rarely exceeds 10  metres, to a maximum of 30 metres in 
major drainages.  

The area is part of the Canadian Boreal Forest Region. Tree species include jack 
pine, black spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, white birch, aspen and tamarack. Shrub 
species include dry-ground cranberry, Labrador tea and bunch berry.  

 
  8 History 

Production began at the Flin Flon district in 1930 when the Hudson Bay smelter 
was completed by the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company (HBM&S). Syme et 
al (1998) state that the Flin Flon district is one of the largest volcanogenic massive 
sulphide (VMS) districts in the world and estimate that more than 118,700,000 tonnes of  
sulphide was mined from  25 deposits, and that a further 64,300,00 tonnes of sulphide 
mineralization is contained in 43 "subeconomic" deposits. 

The first exploration for Precambrian VMS deposits in the area covered by 
Paleozoic sedimentary strata south of the Flin Flon-Snow Lake districts began in the early 
1980's by INCO. Following airborne electromagnetic-magnetic surveys and follow-up 
ground geophysical surveys, a limited number of diamond drill holes were completed 
(Fogwill, 2007). The author does not know the precise location of the INCO work. 

The Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company completed airborne 
EM-magnetic surveys south of Flin Flon (Menard et al 1996) in the early 1980's. The 
surveys and the subsequent interpretation delineated structure in Paleoproterozoic 
metavolcanic gneisses south of the Flin Flon VMS mining district. Several conductors 
detected and drilling led to the discovery of the Namew Lake metamorphosed magmatic 
Ni-Cu deposit in 1984. The Namew Lake Mine was developed by Hudson Bay Mining

and Smelting Company (HBM&S) (60%) and Outukumpu Mines Ltd. (40%) and by the 
time the mine closed in 1993, had produced 2.57 million tonnes grading 0.63% Cu and 
1.79% Ni as well as 0.1 g/t Au, 4.1 g/t Ag, 0.5 g/t Pd and 0.6 g/t Pt (Menard et al, 1996).  

The Rocky Lake Copper prospect was discovered in June of 1987. The airborne 
geophysical surveys detected a 5 km. long conductor at Rocky Lake and ground EM 
surveys outlined a 1500 metre long conductor associated with a magnetic high. Hudson 
Bay drilled 10 NQ and BQ diamond drill holes totalling 2,292 metres in three campaigns; 
five in 1987, three in1990 and two in 1991; and two holes totalling 361 metres (RES-193, 
RES-194) in 1990 to test a significant electromagnetic and magnetic anomaly on the Jaln 
Claim area. The historical results from the Hudson Bay drilling are shown in Table 1 
shown below.

(after Fogwill (2007) and Manitoba Assessment Files 94698, 94131,94134 and 94568) 
  

 
The ground was subsequently acquired by 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. as Mineral 

Exploration License 219A and Jaln Claim.  In 2007 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of 
QMC cut a new grid over the Hudson Bay anomaly and completed a Pulse Time domain 
Electromagnetic (PEM) survey totalling 23 line km (Ralph, 2007 and Pelton, 2007a).

9 Geological Setting and Hostrocks 
  9.1 Geology of the Namew-Rocky Lake Area 

The Rocky Lake prospect is hosted within the Namew Gneiss Complex (Leclair, 
1993; Menard et al, 1996) located 40 km. south of the Paleoproterozoic Flin Flon 
greenstone belt (figure 1). The Flin Flon greenstone belt is composed of Amisk Group 
volcanic rocks, Missi Formation sedimentary rocks and various intrusive rocks (Menard 
et al, 1996). Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) deposits occur at Flin Flon and 
Snow Lake (Syme and Bailes, 1993). The geology and tectonic history of the Namew 
Gneiss Complex is not well understood because the rocks are covered by Paleozoic 
sedimentary rocks (mainly Ordovician dolomitic carbonates) and as a consequence the 
available information is limited to geophysical data, diamond drill core and exposures in 
the Namew Lake Ni-Cu mine (Menard et al, 1996). The Namew Gneiss Complex was 
metamorphosed to the upper amphibolite metamorphic facies and possibly represents a 
deeper crustal level of the volcanoplutonic assemblages exposed in the Flin Flon 
greenstone belt to the north (Leclair, 1993; Menard et al, 1996). The Namew Gneisses are 
bounded on the west by a steep fault (figure 3) against Amisk Lake volcanic and 
volcaniclastic rocks at greenschist metamorphic grade (Menard et al, 1996). On the east 
the gneisses are in fault contact with metavolcanic rocks at amphibolite metamorphic 
grade and the Cormorant Batholith. Namew Gneisses in the Rocky Lake-Namew Lakes 
area are intermediate to mafic in composition and similar to those in the Amisk Group 
(Menard, 1996) and are interbedded with minor metagreywacke, minor metapelites and 
rare 1 to 10 metre thick barren volcanogenic Fe sulphide horizons (Menard et al, 1996). 
The supracrustal rocks are interlayered with sheets of granitic to tonalitic to dioritic 
gneisses that range up to 1 km. in thickness and 10 km. in length.  

Structural trends within the Paleoproterozoic rocks have been compiled from 
magnetic and electromagnetic surveys by HBM&S and the Geological Survey of Canada, 
and are shown in figure 4 (after Menard et al, 1996). Although individual layers can only 
be correlated over short distances due to the structural complexity, Menard et al (1996) 
believe that similar stratigraphy subcrops across the area shown in figure 4. Graphitic and 
sulphide-rich conductive horizons provide useful correlative units.  

The earliest deformational event imprinted a gneissic fabric to the rocks and at 
Namew Lake the assemblage sillimanite-garnet-biotite-plagioclase-k feldspar suggests 
metamorphic conditions of 6500 to 7000 at midcrustal depths of 10 to 20 km. (Menard et 
al, 1996). Structural trends suggest intense folding, some of which may be isoclinal.  

 
   
9.2 Hostrocks – Rocky Lake Copper Deposit 

   The author was not able to view any of the Paleoproterozoic hostrocks to the 
copper mineralization at Rocky Lake because the HBM&S drill core was not stored on 
the property. As a consequence the information in this section is from the diamond drill 
logs archived in the Manitoba Government Assessment Files and written by D.E. 
McKeachnie, K. Gilmore, Dave Price and Rod MacQuarrie.  
   Overburden on the property is negligible in the area of drilling, and most holes 
are collared in unmetamorphosed buff to brownish grey massive and locally fossiliferous 
dolomite of the Ordovician Stony Mountain and Red River Formations. Locally this 
dolomite is argillaceous. The dolomite is underlain by 1 to 5 metres of argillaceous 
sandstone, commonly containing pyrite in the matrix. The Paleozoic rocks are underlain 
by several metres of regolith which reflects paleoweathering of the gneissic

Paleoproterozoic rocks to clay minerals. The uppermost sections are commonly bleached 
to white kaolinitic material.  
   Paleoproterozoic bedrock consists of layered medium to coarse grained gneissic 
rocks described as granitized gneissic rock composed of: (a) grey to black hornblende-
biotite rich units interlayered with quartzo-feldspathic pink pegmatitic units; (b) 
garnetiferous quartz-feldspar-hornblende-biotite gneiss with varying proportions of the 
aforementioned minerals and commonly interlayered with granitic rocks; (c) garnet-rich 
rocks, with garnet composing up to 50% of the rock; (d) pegmatites, pink quartzo-
feldspathic rock, with books of muscovite and biotite. There is a suggestion from the logs 
that the host gneisses on the southeast side of the deposit contain relatively more mafic 
minerals such as hornblende and biotite than those on the northwest side, suggesting that 
the conductive horizon and mineralization could be at a lithologic contact – however 
since the author has not been able to view the core first hand, this observation is 
speculative at this time.  
     

 
10 Deposit Types 

As stated above, the Namew Gneiss Complex possibly formed from Amisk 
Group volcanic rocks elevated to the upper amphibolite metamorphic facies (Menard et 
al, 1996). As such the Namew Lake rocks have the potential to host world-class 
volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits such as those currently being mined in 
the Flin Flon and Snow Lake mining districts.  
The Flin Flon camp (including the Snow Lake deposits) comprises one of the largest 
VMS districts in the world and by the mid 1990's more than 118,700,000 tonnes of 
sulphide ore had been mined from 25 deposits, with a further 64,300,000 tonnes of 
mineralized rock defined in 43 subeconomic deposits (Syme et al, 1998;  Syme and 
Bailes, 1993). The Flin Flon deposits are hosted in island-arc type volcanic rocks at a low 
metamorphic rank (generally greenschist but ranging  from prehnite-pumpellyite to 
amphibolite facies). Primary volcanic textures such as pillows, amygdules and fragments 
are generally well-preserved. The deposits are associated with felsic volcanic units, 
generally in association with major stratigraphic and compositional breaks in the 
predominantly subaqueous volcanic sequence (Syme and Bailes, 1993). The largest 
deposit, the Flin Flon deposit, is hosted within a 200 metre thick rhyolitic flow complex, 
underlain by basalt breccia and overlain by a thick basalt-basaltic andesite sequence. The 
concordant massive sulphide body is underlain by a cross-cutting hydrothermal alteration 
zone characterized by dark black chlorite (Syme and Bailes, 1993). Production at the Flin 
Flon deposit to 1990 when the mine closed totalled 62.5 million tonnes at a grade of 
2.19% Cu, 4.2% Zn, 2.6 g/t Au and 41.3 g/t Ag (Syme and Bailes, 1993). The deposit 
consisted of six ore bodies which extend 1,650 metres down plunge, each zone 
averaging 270 metres in length, 21 metres in thickness and 450 metres in vertical 
extent (Syme and Bailes, 1993). The copper-rich footwall chloritic alteration zone is 
depleted in silica and alkalis and enriched in calcium, iron and particularly in 
magnesium. Major metallic minerals include fine-grained pyrite, sphalerite and 
chalcopyrite in bands generally parallel to the wallrock contacts. The orebodies 
were zoned, with chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite enriched in the footwall areas and 
sphalerite and pyrite in the hangingwall areas. Disseminated chalcopyrite and 
pyrrhotite-rich footwall zones constituted approximately 30% of the ore mined 
(Syme and Bailes, 1993). Apparently the form and distribution of the orebodies was 
largely controlled by minor Z-folds associated with larger-scale fold structures. There are

13 other VMS orbodies in the Flin Flon-Snow Lake camp where more than 1 million 
tonnes of ore was mined, the three largest being Trout Lake  (10.2 m tonnes) in the Flin 
Flon area and Chisel Lake (7.3 m tonnes) and Stall Lake (6.3 m tonnes) in the Snow Lake 
area (Syme and Bailes, 1993). All of the deposits larger than 1 million tonnes produced 
significant zinc (between 0.3 to 10.9 percent). Three of the smaller deposits (Birch - 
279,000 t @ 6.2% Cu; North Star – 242,000 t @ 6.1% Cu and Don Jon – 79,000 t @ 
3.1% Cu) had insignificant Zn values. 

  
 

11 Mineralization 
   Within the Namew Gneiss Complex in the Rocky-Namew Lakes area, Menard et 
al (1996) state that the presence "a pair of distinctive conductive horizons suggests that 
the same stratigraphy subcrops across the area" shown in figure 4. One horizon is a 
graphite-bearing greywacke-volcaniclastic unit with abundant pyrite and pyrrhotite. And 
the other is a pyrite and pyrrhotite-rich horizon in mafic volcanic rocks. The two horizons 
are commonly closely associated (Menard et al, 1996) and have not been distinguished on 
figure 4.  
   The HBM&S drill logs for the Rocky Lake drilling describe the mineralized zone 
as being semi-massive sulphides of up to 35% pyrrhotite, trace to 10% pyrite and up to 
10% chalcopyrite. Locally the semi-massive pyrrhotite is brecciated and (or) encloses 
rounded siliceous clasts, exhibiting durchbewegung texture, a common feature 
characteristic of deformed sulphide deposits. Pegmatitic material and vein quartz 
commonly cut the sulphide mineralization. Magnetite (up to several percent) is 
mentioned in the logs as being associated with some of the mineralized sections and 
occasionally in some of the gneissic rocks containing mafic minerals. Graphite and 
sphalerite are conspicuously absent in the drill log descriptions. Significant but sub-
economic copper mineralization was encountered in most of the drill holes and has been 
tabulated in Table 2 (below on page 21). Ten holes were drilled over a length of 1 km., 
with the best intersection encountering 10.3 metres grading 0.38% Cu (including 4.3 
metres @ 0.67% Cu) in RES-122. The intersection contained high-grade sections (up to 
3.0% Cu across 0.3m) within the 10.3 m intersection. There were no significant gold or 
silver assays and the maximum zinc assay was 0.5% across 0.3 metres associated with 
0.3% Cu between 129.9 and 130.2 metres in diamond drill hole RES138 – trace sphalerite 
was noted in the drill log. The location of the ten diamond drill holes are shown in figures 
5 through 9.

 12 Exploration 

 
4920776 Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of QMC carried out linecutting and Pulse 

Electromagnetic survey on License 219A.  No exploration work was carried out to date 
by the vendor or QMC on Jaln Claim and Licenses 358A, 359A, 360A and 361A. 

 
12.1 Linecutting 

 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of QMC completed a total of 33.5 km. of 
linecutting in May and June of 2007. The grid was laid out to be about 150 metres west of 
and parallel to the HBM&S conductor. The base line was cut at 0400 and 26 cross lines 
cut (13 north and 12 south of the zero line), each line was spaced at 100 metres and 
oriented perpendicular to the baseline. Each cross line was 1,000 metres long. In addition 
to the 2.5 km. long baseline, two additional (2.5 km.) tie-lines were cut at each end of the 
cross lines.   
 GPS readings were recorded at four locations to accurately position the grid: 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 12.2 Crone Geophysics& Exploration Ltd. Pulse Electromagnetic (EM) survey 

 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. on behalf of QMC contracted Crone Geophysics & 
Exploration Ltd. to complete a total of 23 km. of Pulse Time Domain Electromagnetic 
(PEM) surveying on the newly-cut grid and the work was completed between Sept. 9 and 
Oct. 19 of 2007 (Ralph, 2007). Survey operators were Messrs. Phil Small and Claude 
Bisson. The report (Ralph, 2007) has been included as Appendix 2 in this report. Two 
separate transmit loops were utilized in the survey. Twenty four lines were surveyed, 
from line 11+00 S to 12+00 N.  
 The Crone PEM method utilizes a precise pulse of currents transmitted through a 
large loop of wire, and the rate of decay of the induced secondary field measured across a 
series of time windows during the off-time. When the primary field is terminated, the 
secondary (induced) electromagnetic field decays with time , and the amplitude of this 
secondary field and the decay rate depend on the quality and size of the conductor 
(Ralph, 2007). 

A Crone Pulse EM Surface System was utilized in the survey. The equipment 
included a 4.8 kW transmitter with a 240 volt voltage regulator powered by an 11 hp 
motor generator. A Crone Digital Receiver was used to collect the field data. The 
synchronization between the Transmitter and the Receiver was maintained by crystal 
clock synchronization for the work.    

The results of the survey and the interpretation (Ralph, 2007) are presented in 
Table 2 below (after Ralph, 2007):

12.3 Historical Exploration 
 Hudson Bay discovered the Rocky Lake Prospect in June of 1987.  The 
airborne geophysical surveys detected a 5 km. long conductor and ground EM surveys 
outlined a 1500 metre long conductor associated with a magnetic high on License 219A. 
Hudson Bay drilled 10 NQ and BQ diamond drill holes totalling 2,292 metres in three 
campaigns; five in 1987, three in1990 and two in 1991 to test the conductor ; and two 
holes totalling 361 metres (RES-193, RES-194) in 1990 to test a significant 
electromagnetic and magnetic anomaly on the Jaln Claim area.   The results from the 
Hudson Bay drilling are shown in the section "History, Table 1". 
 
Licenses 358A and 359A were acquired to cover possible extensions of these conductors 
and Licenses 360A and 361A were acquired to cover historical airborne magnetic and 
electromagnetic anomalies generated from work carried out by Hudson Bay and 
Geological Survey of Canada (Figure 4).  

  
13 Drilling 

 Neither QMC nor 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. has completed any drilling on the 
Rocky Lake VMS property.  The author reviewed information from assessment reports 
filed with the Manitoba Department of Industry, Economic Development and Mines 
("Manitoba Department of Mines) and concluded that drilling was carried out by Hudson 
Bay Exploration and Development Company (Hudson Bay).   

  
 14 Sampling Method and Approach 

Neither QMC nor 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. has completed any sampling or 
assaying of samples from the Rocky Lake VMS property.  Geological descriptions of 
core logs by Hudson Bay geologists appear to show that systematic sampling of the 
mineralized intervals was carried out, but the sampling methods was not mentioned in the 
assessment reports filed with Manitoba Department of Mines.  The author did not have 
access to the historical core which was reported to be stored in Hudson Bay's core 
storage facilities in Flin Flon.   

 
 15 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

Neither QMC nor 4920776 Manitoba Ltd. has completed any sampling or 
assaying of samples from the Rocky Lake VMS property.  Sample preparation, analyses 
and security of samples of core drilling carried out by Hudson Bay was not reported in 
the historical assessment reports filed with the Manitoba Department of Mines.   

 
 16 Data Verification             

None of 4920776 Manitoba Ltd., QMC or the author has undertaken any program 
of verification of the HBM&S technical data presented in this report on the Rocky Lake 
VMS property.  Drilling was confirmed by the verification of drill hole collar locations.  
The mineralization on the property cannot be verified as it is not exposed on surface.   As 
stated above in Section 5, the information used in the preparation of this report is mainly 
based on the Assessment Reports filed with the Manitoba Department of Mines by 
Hudson Bay.

17     Adjacent Properties  
The Namew Lake Ni-Cu Mine is located 11 km. northwest of the property. As 

discussed in Section 8, it was developed by HBM&S (60%) and Outukumpu Mines Ltd. 
(40%). Prior to mine closure in 1993, the mine produced 2.57 million tonnes grading 
0.63% Cu and 1.79% Ni as well as 0.1 g/t Au, 4.1 g/t Ag, 0.5 g/t Pd and 0.6 g/t Pt 1993 
(Menard et al, 1996). The author has been unable to verify the information and that the 
information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property. 

 
The prolific Flin Flon VMS district is located 65 km. north of the Rocky Lake 

Property and salient geological features of the district have been summarized in Section 
10 of this report.

 A compilation map showing the 2007 Grid, Crone PEM results, the historic 
HBM&S ground EM anomaly and the HBM&S diamond drill holes is presented in figure 
10 (after Ralph, 2007). As can be seen in figure 10 and from Table 2, Ralph (2007) 
recognized three main conductors: 

Portions of Conductor 1–A between line 11+00 S and 8+00 S are interpreted 
(Ralph, 2007) as having a possible bedrock source and therefore accorded a low priority 
rating,  while the northern portions of the conductor are believed to be caused by a 
"discreet bedrock source" and assigned a medium priority. The medium priority portion 
of the anomaly between lines 7+00S and 1+00 S  implies a minimum strike length of  
more than 600 metres. Ralph (2007) interprets Conductor 1-A as caused by a "large, low 
conductance feature with the potential for a significant depth extent". Ralph (2007) 
believes such a feature may be attributed to a weakly conductive fault or shear zone or 
"could represent areas of weakly conductive sulphide mineralization". It is interpreted to 
have a steep dip in a grid east direction. Ralph (2007) estimated a depth to source of 80 to 
100 metres. 

Conductor 1-B is interpreted (Ralph, 2007) to have a higher conductance with a 
localized source. It is interpreted to have a high-conductive, sulphide source. The top of 
the conductor is interpreted to be at a depth of 90 to 100 metres.  

Conductor 2-A has a strong 20 channel response on lines 0+00 to 7+00N 
(Ralph, 2007) and continues from lines 8+00N to 12+00N at a diminished 16 to 18 
channel response. "Because of the strong 20 channel response indicative of a high 
conductance source, this conductor would rank as a high priority target" (Ralph, 2007)  
The response broadens from line 6+00N to the north and is interpreted to indicate an 
increase in depth to the top of the conductor (Ralph, 2007). Between lines 9+00N and 
12+00N, the amplitude on the anomaly decreases further indicating either that the 
conductor is at a still greater depth, or that the anomaly ends somewhere between 8+00N 
and 10+00N. It is likely that the conductor has a moderate plunge to the north (Ralph, 
2007). The conductor is believed to have a steep east dip and to be at a depth of 130 to 
150 metres (Ralph, 2007). 

Ralph (2007) stated that it appears that "Conductors 1-A and 1-B have been well 
tested" and that "Conductor 2-A appears to have been well tested (on lines 0N and 100N) 
in particular with holes RES-138 and RES-198" which "appear to have intersected a 
sulphide source with varying amounts of Cu mineralization." North of line  
1+00N, the PEM anomaly deviates west from  the HBM&S EM anomaly (figure 10) 
leading Ralph (2007) to suggest that diamond drill holes RES-199 and RES-259 "did not 
test Conductor 2-A". RES-199 was terminated in low grade sulphide mineralization and 
Ralph (2007) suggests that it may not have tested the whole conductor. Ralph (2007) also 
suggests that RES-259 also may not have been deep enough to test PEM Conductor 2-A. 
Ralph (2007) suggests that "based on these results, there appears to be excellent 
potential to expand the strike extent of the mineralized zone in a grid North direction. The 
broadening of the anomaly wavelength from lines 700N-1100N could indicate an 
increasing depth to top of the source here, but the possibility also exists of the conductor 
ending somewhere in the vicinity of 800N. The conductor is located nearly in the middle 
of the loop here, and with the potential for a poor coupling situation, it is difficult to 
comment further in the significance of the results." Ralph (2007) goes on to recommend 
"future drilling of Conductor 2-A both along strike and at depth." However prior to 
drilling he suggests that the HBM&S drillholes (in particular RES-199 and RES-259) be 
accurately located.

Pelton (2007a) reviewed the Crone report and affirmed the recommendations 
made by Ralph (2007). Pelton (2007b) states that "Conductor 1-A is a long, low 
conductance, and with large depth extent, which is interpreted as a long, weakly 
mineralized shear zone. Conductor 1-B is a localized source with higher conductance, 
which is interpreted as a sulphide body or lens of sulphides which lies along the weakly 
mineralized shear zone." He also affirmed Ralph's recommendation that the HBM&S 
drillholes be accurately located. 

On the basis of the Crone Pulse Electromagnetic (PEM) Survey, Pelton (2007a) 
recommended that, following accurate location of HBM&S drillholes RES-199 and RES-
259, the following six drill holes should be completed: 

 
"1) beneath Line 4N at 50E at a depth of 160m 
 2) beneath Line 3N at 75E at a depth of 150m 
 3) beneath Line 5N at 50E at a depth of 170m 
 
Good results in these holes would warrant continuing the drilling to the north. 
 4) beneath Line 6N at 50E at a depth of 180m 
 5) beneath Line 7N at 25E at a depth of 190m 
 6) beneath Line 8N at 25E at a depth of 200m" 

 
 21.2  This Author's Geological Interpretation, Discussion and Conclusions 

Although the author believes the interpretation and conclusions by Ralph (2007) 
and Pelton (2007a) to be reasonable and believes that their recommendations should be 
implemented, there are several geological aspects which could expand the scope and 
possibly the ultimate success of the upcoming testing of the Rocky Lake VMS Property 
by diamond drilling. In particular, two aspects should be considered: 

a) The Rocky Lake mineralization is hosted in the Namew Gneiss Complex, 
believed to be an isoclinally folded, highly metamorphosed equivalent of the 
Amisk Group volcanic assemblage – the hostrocks to the prolific Flin Flon-Snow 
Lake district (Menard et al, 1996). In intensely folded VMS districts, massive 
sulphide orebodies tend to be ductile and to be flattened during deformation. 
Such deposits tend to thin on fold limbs but to thicken in fold nose areas due to 
repetition and to migration of sulphide minerals into dilatent areas. The current 
northwest-oriented geophysical surveys have tested the area well for conductors 
striking in that direction. The author believes an airborne electromagnetic-
magnetic survey flown in two directions might detect significant conductors 
and/or dragfolds which could be missed in a unidirectional survey. 
b) The current drilling has intersected mainly pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-pyrite 
mineralization characteristic of "feeder zones" from the stratigraphic footwall of  
VMS deposits. Pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite behave as ductile minerals during 
deformation and as a result tend to from continuous, connected sulphides which 
are excellent conductors and are easily detected by EM surveys. Sphalerite is 
non-conductive and pyrite is not a ductile mineral – as a consequence sulphide 
deposits rich in these minerals can be poorly to non-conductive. This author 
believes there is good potential to find zinc-rich mineralization on the Rocky 
Lake Property and that some poorly conductive targets should also be drilled. 
Induced polarization (IP) surveys have been utilized to target zinc-rich 
mineralization in other VMS camps, but the thick Paleozoic cover rocks at Rocky 
Lake might make this technique less attractive.

 22 Recommendations 
This author suggests that the 2007 grid be accurately surveyed utilizing a 

differential GPS. At the same time a high-accuracy magnetic survey should be 
completed. Part of this work should also include locating and surveying all the HBM&S 
drill holes. The HBM&S baseline should be followed and surveyed if possible and the 
HBM&S geophysical data (ground HLEM and magnetic data) compiled. 

Following this work, a finalized drilling program can be laid out on the basis of 
the 2007 Crone PEM survey. In addition to the drill hole locations recommended by 
Pelton (2007a), some of the weaker conductors along the 5 km. long HBM&S airborne 
EM conductor trend should be targeted for poorly-conductive zinc-rich mineralization.  

To detect fold-nose related deposits and/or sulphide deposits with orientations 
other than northeast, an airborne electromagnetic-magnetic survey is recommended. It is 
recommended that the one set of survey lines be oriented at 0400 and the second at 2200. 
Line spacing could be at 160 metres. This work should be followed by some limited 
ground electromagnetic-magnetic surveying. All this work would to be followed by a 
major diamond drill program.
