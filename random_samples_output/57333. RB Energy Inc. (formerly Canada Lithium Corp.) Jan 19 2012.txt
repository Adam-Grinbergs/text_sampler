1 SUMMARY 

This Technical Report on the Quebec Lithium Property (the Property) in La Corne 
Township, Quebec has been prepared by AMC Mining Consultants (Canada) Ltd (AMC) of 
Vancouver, Canada on behalf of Canada Lithium Corp (CLQ) of Toronto, Canada, and it's 
wholly owned subsidiary Quebec Lithium Corp, (QLC). It has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), "Standards of Disclosure 
for Mineral Projects", of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) for lodgment on 
CSA's "System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval" (SEDAR). This report is an 
update of the Mineral Resource section of the earlier Technical Report entitled "Technical 
Report Quebec Lithium Property La Corne Township, Quebec", prepared by J.M Shannon 
P.Geo and D. Nussipakynova P.Geo, dated 3 June 2011. This report includes work carried 
out since then in the form of a drilling campaign totaling 63 diamond drillholes and includes 
a new resource estimate prepared by AMC in November 2011. 

History, Location and Ownership 

Spodumene-bearing pegmatites were discovered on the Property in 1942, and it went 
through several ownership changes before being put into production as an underground 
mine by Quebec Lithium Corp, a 100 % subsidiary of Sullivan Mines Inc. in 1955. A refinery 
for lithium carbonate, monohydrate hydroxide and lithium chloride was constructed and 
operational by 1960. Production of lithium hydroxide began in June 1963. In October 1965, 
operations were suspended because of unfavourable market and price conditions, and lack 
of sales. Approximately one million tonnes were mined between 1955 and 1965. 

The Property was explored intermittently after 1965. CLQ's involvement started in 2008 and 
exploration and evaluation work led to the completion of a feasibility study in early 2011. 
The project has completed the detailed engineering design stage and is now in the 
construction stage. 

The Property is located in the north-east corner of La Corne Township, approximately 38 
km south-east of Amos, 15 km west of Barraute and 60 km north of Val-d'Or in the province 
of Quebec. The site is approximately 550 km north of Montreal and is serviced by road, rail 
and air. The Property is centred near coordinates 291,964m E and 5,365,763m N, UTM 
Zone 18N as located on the NTS map sheet 32C5. 

The Property consists of 19 contiguous claims covering 643.11 hectares. CLQ owns 100% 
through its subsidiary Quebec Lithium Inc. as per a Letter of Agreement with IAMGOLD 
Corporation (IAMGOLD) and subsequent transfer from Black Pearl Minerals Consolidated 
Inc (Black Pearl), and a Mining Claim Transfer and Easement Agreement with Schyan 
Exploration Inc. (Schyan).  

A mining lease will have to be obtained before any full time mining can be undertaken. An 
application has been made for a mining lease and associated surface lease. 

AMC is not aware of any environmental liabilities to which the Property is subject, other 
than the normal licensing and permitting requirements that must be met prior to undertaking 
certain operations and environmental restrictions as set forth in the Provincial Mining Act 
and Regulations. As a legacy of the previous activity, 700,000-750,000 tonnes of tailings

are stored within two dams located to the north of the mine area in a west-east trending 
valley between Lac Lortie and Lac Roy.  

The site was fully rehabilitated between 1985 and 2001, including complete removal of all 
underground and surface plant and equipment, the mine's head frame, and all office 
buildings and structures. The railway spur connecting to the C.N.R was removed and the 
crown pillar was fenced off and all openings sealed to the satisfaction of the Ministère des 
Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune (MRNF) and in conformity with Provincial safety 
standards. 

The Property is accessible by provincial highways and is traversed by an all-weather 
secondary road. Val-d'Or and Rouyn Noranda are serviced daily by regional air carriers. 
AMC understands that it is possible to re-establish the rail spur to the main trans-Canada 
C.N.R. railway line which runs through Barraute, approximately 15 km to the east of the 
Property. 

The climate is such that mining operations can be conducted year round. As the Property is 
located in an active mining belt, there is a substantial professional work force nearby 
experienced in mining and related activities. A high tension hydro-electric line (120 kv) is 
located approximately 2 km to the west of the Property. 

Geology and Mineralization 

The Property is situated on the northern flank of the Archean Preissac-Lacorne batholith, a 
syn- to post-tectonic intrusion that was emplaced in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the 
Abitibi Greenstone Belt of the Superior Province of Quebec. To the north the batholith is 
bounded by the Manneville Fault and to the south by the Cadillac Fault, the eastward 
extension of the Porcupine-Destor Fault. The batholith, which is a composite body, has 
associated pegmatites and quartz veins. 

The regional metamorphic grade is greenschist facies and close to the batholith is 
hornblende hornfels facies contact metamorphism.  

The spodumene pegmatites on the Property are very poorly exposed and as a result most 
of the information on the spodumene dykes was initially obtained by diamond drilling. 
Mining on the Property which commenced in 1955, gave a good picture of the three-
dimensional nature of the dykes. Over the whole property the rocks are split between 
granodiorite of the Lacorne Batholith, volcanics and some biotite schists and the pegmatite 
dykes which mainly intrude the granodiorite and the volcanics. 

There are two orientations of spodumene dyke, termed Main and Oblique. The Oblique 
dyke, which is thought to be younger than the Main dykes, has less tonnage associated 
with it and a lower grade. There are three identified dyke types which form a co-linear 
bifurcating array in the centre of the Property. These are designated PEG1 and PEG2, 
which are both spodumene-bearing, and PEG3 which typically hosts <1% spodumene. 
Both Main and Oblique dyke sets dip south or southwest at about 70 - 75o.

Exploration and Data Management 

As the pegmatite dykes were known to exist prior to CLQ's acquisition of the Property, 
exploration by CLQ has mainly consisted of drilling the known targets and collecting 
metallurgical samples for testwork. After the first round of sample collection for metallurgical 
testwork, Caracle Creek International Consulting Inc. (CCIC) was engaged to compile all 
the historic data and to estimate a potential tonnage and grade for the property.  

Three exploration drilling programs were carried out by CLQ as follows; late 2009 (38 holes 
totaling 9,646m), second quarter of 2010, (45 holes totaling 6,938m), and mid 2011, (63 
holes totaling 12,003m),. All holes were drilled NQ size and were oriented normal to the 
dyke orientation such that generally a true intersection width was attained. As part of the 
2009 program, the historic data was validated by a twinning program which attempted to 
twin old holes. This turned out to be difficult due to the presence of old workings, but similar 
spodumene grades were found in similar locations in the new drillholes. Thus data from 
some of the old surface drilling is usable for resource estimation purposes. However none 
of the assays for the historic underground drilling could be located.  

Sampling for metallurgical testwork was carried out by drilling in 2008, and by both drilling 
and blasting outcrops in late 2009 and early 2010 to obtain larger samples. 

Down-hole surveys were carried out at approximately 50m intervals down-hole. Casing was 
left in the majority of the holes which were capped, to allow for future down-hole testing and 
/ or extension. GPS coordinates of all collar locations were recorded and tied into the 
exploration grid.  

All drill core from both exploration programs was logged, split and stored in CLQ's core 
facility in Val-d'Or. The drill core was washed, photographed and logged prior to sampling. 
Core logging and sampling were carried out by CCIC Geologists, and the core was sawed, 
with a nominal sample length of 1.0m. Bulk density measurements were taken for the three 
main rock types. 

The samples were sent to a primary laboratory and pulps then checked by a secondary 
laboratory. While the laboratories changed between 2009 and 2010, all laboratories 
involved are accredited for ISO/IEC17025:2005 and ISO 9001 by Standards Council of 
Canada. Assay QA/QC protocols were in force with standards and blanks being inserted 
and follow up generally carried out.  

The data was logged into Coreview v. 5.0.0 software (Visidata Pty Ltd.), and the data is 
held in an Access database. Results were received electronically and merged. During a 
verification exercise however AMC found some discrepancies which suggests human 
interference in the process. 

AMC believes that the work carried out by CLQ was of an appropriate standard for resource 
modelling and estimation.

Mineral Resources 

AMC's mineral resource has been estimated using a rebuilt mineralized domain model, 
which now incorporates the 2011 drilling data, in addition to data from CLQ's 2009 and 
2010 drill programs as well as a certain amount of historical data. All the modelling and the 
estimation was carried out in Datamine software. The Mineral Resources for the project are 
tabulated below in Table 1, rounded to the nearest 10,000 tonnes. These are gross mineral 
resources as no mineral reserves have yet been estimated based on AMC's December 
2011 model. 

Table 1 Mineral Resources as of December 2011 

Classification Tonnes(M) 
Grade 

(Li2O%) 

Measured 6.91 1.18 

Indicated 26.33 1.19 

Measured and Indicated 33.24 1.19 

Inferred 13.76 1.21 
Notes: 1. CIM definitions were used for mineral resources 

2. The cut offs applied are 0.80% Li2O for all classes 
3. The reported resources are rounded to nearest 10,000 tonnes and 0.01 % Li2O 
4. These resources have been depleted for historical mining.  
5. Material estimated to be remaining in stopes is accounted for.  

AMC modelled the dykes in a similar manner to that carried out for the May 2011 estimate, 
and there are now 64 dyke domains. The mined-out areas from the earlier mining phase 
were treated by using the historic estimate to create point data by way of pseudo-holes, so 
that the whole model is now an estimated block model. Wireframes of the stopes were 
recreated and have more detail than in the earlier estimate. Cognizance was taken of the 
material remaining in the stopes.  

A block model was built with a parent block size of 5m X 5m X 5m, with sub blocking 
utilized. A composite length of 1.0m was applied and no grade capping was employed.  

There are three dyke orientations, Main and two Oblique orientations, so three different 
search ellipse orientations were used. The search parameters used were 20m X 70m X 
70m, and the minimum number of samples utilized was four and maximum 20. A number of 
passes were used to fill the blocks. Grades were estimated using an inverse distance 
squared interpolation method.  

Classification was carried out in a similar fashion to the May estimate and included a 
manual review paying careful attention to the CIM resource definitions.  

In order to report the resource, a pit shell was developed using mining costs supplied by 
CLQ (and checked at a high level by AMC) and a price of US$ 7,100 / tonne LiCO3. Of note 
is the fact that this shell trimmed a small portion of the Indicated Resource at depth. A 
regularized model was created for this exercise and to assist with the future reporting of 
mineral reserves.

The current Technical Report addresses only mineral resources. It does not address 
mineral reserves, which will be the subject of a later report by another party. 

Conclusion and Recommendations 

CLQ's exploration programs have been conducted to generally good industry standards 
and the resulting data is appropriate as the basis for mineral resource estimation. Some 
historic exploration data, including information relating to old underground workings, was 
used for resource estimation purposes after validation, which included twinning of some 
drillholes.  

The geological interpretation of the deposit is robust and, from the current knowledge, is 
reasonably predictable. The dykes in the east are narrow and diverge due to two 
orientations, demonstrating that the operation is situated where the dykes are most fertile. 

AMC's review of the 2010 resource estimate indicated that there was room for 
improvement, particularly with respect to geological domaining and the treatment of 
unsampled dyke material. This was rectified in the AMC estimate of May 2011, which 
employed a more rigorous interpretation of pegmatite dykes and restriction of the 
mineralized domains to those dykes  

The December 2011 estimate is based on a further 65 holes and has given more 
confidence moving some Inferred material into the Indicated category through more dense 
drilling. In both AMC estimates the stated Mineral Resource is constrained within a pit shell.  

AMC recommends the following: 

All known errors have been removed from the database. There are however some minor 
outstanding issues which should be changed, and a dated master database held in a 
secure environment. No copies of the master database should be made, other than well-
labelled copies for specific purposes. There appears to be an issue with some 2009 collars 
locations and these should be resurveyed or resolved. There are also analytical results yet 
to be entered for seven holes from the 2011 drilling program. 

There are also some QA/QC items which, although not materially impacting on the resource 
estimate, should be resolved before wrapping up the database. There appear to have been 
mix ups of submitted standards, blanks with high values and no umpire checks carried out. 
AMC strongly recommends that better sample control be implemented for any further 
drilling carried out. The estimated cost to rectify data issues is $15,000 

Non certified standards have been used in the QA/QC process. AMC recommends that 
certified standards be procured for ongoing QA/QC work. 

A number of survey grids have been employed on the Property over time. Some 
manipulation was required to best fit the location of the underground workings, for example. 
It is recommended that the grid issue be resolved, and survey monuments be resurveyed. 
Any resurveying costs are estimated at $10,000 

Bulk density measurements should be collected for drill core from 2010 and 2011 drilling, 
as there is not good spatial coverage of the deposit. Estimated cost $4,000

No further delineation drilling is recommended at this time. Depending on the economics 
and timing, further exploration drilling is warranted to the north west and to the south east, 
as there is potential to enlarge a pit in either direction. 

There will be some grade control drilling required on an ongoing basis. This could by the 
reverse circulation method with some initial calibration with existing or new diamond 
drillholes. This program could be part of preparation of the deposit for mining and should 
include probe drilling for the stope voids. This would be considered an operating activity 
cost, will be ongoing and is not costed here.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION  

4.1 Property Location 

The Quebec Lithium Property (Property) is located in the north-east corner of La Corne 
Township, approximately 38 km south-east of Amos, 15 km west of Barraute and 60 km 
north of Val-d'Or in the province of Quebec (Figure 4.1). The site is approximately 550 km 
north of Montreal and is serviced by road, rail and air. The Property is centred near 
coordinates 291,964m E and 5,365,763m N, Zone 18N as located on the NTS map sheet 
32C5. 

Figure 4.1 Location of Quebec Lithium Property  

 

4.2 Property Description and Ownership 

The Property consists of 19 contiguous claims covering 643.11 hectares (Figure 4.2 and 
Table 4.1). The Property contains a series of spodumene pegmatite dykes which have been 
previously mined when underground mining operations were conducted by Quebec Lithium 
Corp. from 1955-1965, with a brief hiatus in 1959. This is discussed in Section 6.0, and in 
more detail in Lavery M. E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 2010. Production 
included ceramic grade and chemical grade spodumene concentrates, lithium carbonate, 
lithium hydroxide monohydrate as well as a small quantity of lithium chloride and feldspar. 

CLQ owns 100% of the Property through its subsidiary Quebec Lithium Inc. as per a Letter 
of Agreement with IAMGOLD Corporation (IAMGOLD) and subsequent transfer from Black 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 5 

Pearl Minerals Consolidated Inc (Black Pearl), and a Mining Claim Transfer and Easement 
Agreement with Schyan Exploration Inc. (Schyan). 

Figure 4.2 Map of the Property 

 

4.3 Land Tenure 

The claims were electronically staked such that a Notice of Map Designation was filed with 
the MRNF. Therefore the claim boundaries do not have to be physically identified in the 
field. Title ownership and status of the claims were checked against information obtained 
from the MRNF claims website by AMC. The MRNF website indicates that claim ownership 
is consistent with the 2008 purchase agreement between IAMGOLD and Black Pearl, which 
was then transferred to CLQ. On 2 March, 2010, these titles were transferred to the 
Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Quebec Lithium Inc. The claims listed in the 2010 
Mining Title Transfer and Easement Agreement with Mitchell Lavery (executed on 
1 February, 2010) were also transferred to Quebec Lithium Inc. on 24 March, 2010. The 
claims are all in good standing, however, they are currently listed on the MNRF website as 
suspended because the application for a mining lease over part of the Property has been 
submitted.

The terms of the transaction with Black Pearl and IAMGOLD signed in March 2008 are 
outlined in Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 2010. 

There are no royalties on the Property.  

4.4 Surface Rights 

A mining lease will have to be obtained before any full time mining can be undertaken. An 
application has been lodged for a mining lease which includes the Pre Feasibility Study 
(PFS) pit and a buffer zone of approximately 100m. 

4.5 Existing Environmental Liabilities 

AMC is not aware of any environmental liabilities to which the Property is subject, other 
than the normal licensing and permitting requirements that must be made prior to 
undertaking certain operations and environmental restrictions as set forth in the Provincial 
Mining Act and Regulations. 

There is no liability on the old mining site as the previous owner of the claims (IAMGOLD 
Corp) had completed the full rehabilitation to the satisfaction of the MRNF and in conformity 
with Provincial safety standards and received a confirmation from the authorities for the 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION

AMC 711013: January 2012 7 

completion of the work. Rehabilitation of the mine site including complete removal of all 
underground and surface plant and equipment, the mine's head frame, the railway spur 
connecting to the Canadian National Railway (CNR), and all office buildings and other 
structures was completed from 1975 through 2001. The crown pillar was fenced off and all 
openings sealed. Old tailings are stored within two dams located to the north of the mine 
area in a west-east trending valley between Lac Lortie and Lac Roy. There is an estimated 
700,000-750,000 tonnes of material (quartz and feldspar sand), stored there (Karpoff, 
1993). Tailings rehabilitation included covering them with soil and vegetation. 

A Study of the Environmental Character (SEC) of the Property will be completed before any 
production is undertaken. This study was initiated by Genivar Inc. of Amos, Quebec, in 
2009 and since November 2010 has been continued by CLQ personnel and is expected to 
be completed by mid 2012. 

The SEC will outline all environmental concerns and constraints for CLQ's proposed 
development of a lithium mining operation. 

An environmental baseline study for the project commenced in October 2009 and will be 
incorporated into the final SEC Report. This was the first step towards obtaining the permits 
and authorizations by regulatory authorities.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY  

5.1 Accessibility 

The Property is located approximately 60 km north of Val-d'Or, Quebec and is accessible 
by either provincial highway #111 connecting Val-d'Or and Amos or by provincial highway 
#397 connecting Val-d'Or and Barraute (Figure 4.1). An all-weather secondary road 
traverses the Property. This Range road joins the above mentioned highways. 

Val-d'Or and Rouyn Noranda are serviced daily by regional air carriers and small craft 
landing areas are also located in these towns and nearby Amos. The closest all weather 
landing strip and heli-pad is located at Mont Vidéo, to the east of the property. 

The main Canadian National Railway (CNR) line runs through Barraute, a CNR section 
town, and passes approximately 11 km to the north of the Property. A CNR spur line 
serviced the Property during the period of historic production but the tracks were all 
removed after mining operations were shut down. The rail right of way has since become 
overgrown but the rail bed is still in excellent shape. 

5.2 Climate 

Summer temperatures average 16 ºC with an average rainfall of 103 mm for Amos (the 
nearest weather station to the Property). In the winter, the average daily temperature is -15 
ºC. Temperature extremes reported over the period of 1913 through 2000 are -53 °C (1914) 
and +37°C (1921). The average snowfall is 157 cm with most falling in December and 
January. Snow accumulation is 52 cm on average for Amos. Drilling, most exploration 
activities, and potential mining operations can be conducted year round on the Property. 
Surface mapping is the main exploration activity that is limited by snow cover. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Property is located in an active mining belt and as such the area offers a substantial 
professional work force experienced in mining and related activities in addition to most 
supplies and services. The current high level of mining activity could affect immediate 
availability of skilled labour. 

A high tension hydro-electric line (120 kv) is located approximately 2 km to the west of the 
Property and a 25 kV electric line along the Route Quebec Lithium, services the Mont Vidéo 
Ski and Recreation area. An Astral Media Inc. radio tower is located atop of the hill 
immediately south of the old mine area. It is anticipated that it will be moved to a location on 
a hill, 200m north of the historic tailings in Q3, 2012. 

Lac Lortie has provided some water for drilling and was initially considered for use as a 
primary water source for the project. However, most of the water for use for production 
purposes is planned to be sourced (recycled) from the Tailings Management Facility once 
production commences. Water for any pre-mining drilling, including preliminary grade 
control will continue to be sourced from Lac Lortie.

5.4 Physiography and Vegetation 

The area of the Property contains small hills but the topography is generally flat with 
swamp, sand plains and an esker on the edge of the property. The hill on which the radio 
tower resides is about 50m above the surrounding rolling countryside. Mount Video the 
local ski hill and resort is situated 2 km to the east of the site and faces to the north and is 
not seen. A photograph in Figure 5.1 shows the relief and vegetation of the property 
adjacent to the historic mine site. 

Figure 5.1 View North across Old Plant Site 

 

As it is a recently reclaimed site and also all timber has been cut earlier, vegetation is 
limited to spruce with jack pine and alders in regrowth.

6 HISTORY 

There is a large amount of information relating to the historic exploration and mining 
activities on the Property which has been summarized in the following reports: 

• Stone, M and Selway, J, Technical Report of December 2009 

• Stone, M and Ilieva, T, Technical Report of April 2010 

• Lavery ME and Stone, M, Technical Report of November 2010 

The compilation work was assisted by published reports, internal reports, drill logs and 
available assessment files from the MRNF. Historic annual mine reports are missing for the 
period of 1958 to 1962. Drilling information for all historic underground and some surface 
holes are incomplete or missing. 

6.1 Ownership and Activities 

The original discovery of spodumene-bearing pegmatite on the Property was made in 1942 
when three main spodumene dykes were intersected, along with several thinner ones. The 
owner at that time was Sullivan Mining Group, and the property went through several 
owners before being acquired by Quebec Lithium Corp. in 1954, and put into production in 
1955. This was after sinking a three-compartment shaft and establishing three working 
levels at 150, 275 and 400 ft. (approximately 46, 84 and 121m). At the end of 1955, two 
stopes were in operation which contained approximately 136,000t of ore grading 1.2% Li2O. 
The production profile for the mine life is seen in Table 6.4. 

In mid-1959, the contract for the sale of spodumene concentrate by Quebec Lithium Corp. 
to Lithium Corporation of America Inc. was terminated and a refinery for lithium carbonate, 
monohydrate hydroxide and lithium chloride was constructed and operational by 1960. 
Production of lithium hydroxide (LiOH·H2O) began in June 1963. In October 1965, 
operations were suspended because of unfavourable market and price conditions, and lack 
of sales. Table 6.1 summarizes ownership and historic exploration completed on the 
Property.

Of the above holes only 52 of the LV series holes can be used in a resource estimate due 
to either incomplete collar or assay information. The underground drill holes are missing 
assay data, and other drill data is destroyed or lost. In Figure 6.2 the location of the 
historical drillholes used in the estimate are shown. Note the majority of these were drilled 
on an 0180 azimuth, which is the orientation of what was termed the Oblique Dyke, now 
Oblique 1 orientation.

Figure 6.2 Plan of Historic Drillholes used in Estimate 

 

In 1974, Surveyer Nenniger et Chênevert Inc. (SNC), an engineering consulting firm, was 
contracted by Sullivan Mining Group (SMG) to write a feasibility report on the rehabilitation 
of the Quebec Lithium mine. It investigated market conditions, alternative mining methods 
and metallurgical processes. It also re-estimated the mining and property Li2O reserves 
which are summarized in Table 6.3 below. 

In October 1987, Cambior Inc. (Cambior) acquired all assets of Quebec Lithium Corp., 
including the mining property (Karpoff, 1993). The mining facilities were sold, infrastructure 
was demolished and the site reclaimed. The mine openings to the surface consisting of one

shaft and three raises are protected in accordance with the requirements of the Quebec 
Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Faune, (MEF). 
  

6.2 Historic Resources 

The reserves, as they are termed in the SNC report, consist of material within the Mine area 
and Surface Diamond Drilling Area which are quoted separately. 

The Mine area consists of two contiguous blocks within which underground mining 
operations were carried out and these were adjusted for 85% recovery and 7% dilution with 
the exception of the broken ore. Over a period of 10 years of operation, the ore hoisted 
from underground works averaged a grade of 1.25% Li2O against the estimated 1.13% Li2O 
derived from geological sections.  

The Surface Diamond Drilling Area extends from the Mine area approximately 2,000 feet 
(approximately 610m) to the west and 6,000 feet (approximately 1,829m) to the east.

The reserves were re-estimated using diamond drilling records, vertical geological sections 
and information from mining operations in 20 stopes. This data was supplied to SNC by 
SMG. SNC did not conduct a site visit or examine any drill core, as the drill core no longer 
existed. 

6.3 Production 

Mine production peaked at 247,000 tonnes hoisted in 1957. However production was 
intermittent after 1959 when the contract for the sale of spodumene concentrate to Lithium 
Corporation of America Inc. was terminated.

While it is not known if there were some tonnage reconciliation adjustments contributing to 
the numbers above, AMC notes that a hand sorting activity was employed to remove non-
dyke material and upgrade the mill feed. The total figures above show a difference of 13.5% 
but the impression was given that sorting removed about 10% of the hoisted material. 

AMC notes that the mine was not closed for lack of mineral resources and it was the 
previous work that laid the foundation for the 2009 drilling program undertaken by CLQ.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

This has been adapted from Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 
2010. 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Archean Preissac-Lacorne batholith is a syn- to post-tectonic intrusion that was 
emplaced in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt of the Superior 
Province of Quebec. The batholith intruded along the La Pause anticline into the ultramafic 
to basic lavas of the Kinojevis (2,718 Ma; Corfu 1993) and Malartic groups, and biotite 
schist of the Kewagama Group. To the north the batholith is bounded by the Manneville 
Fault and to the south by the Cadillac Fault and the eastward extension of the Porcupine-
Destor Fault. The batholith is a composite body comprising early metaluminous gabbro, 
diorite, monzonite and granodiorite (ca. 2,650-2,760 Ma: Steiger and Wasserburg 1969, 
Feng and Kerrich 1991) and four late peraluminous monzogranitic plutons (Preissac, Moly 
Hill, Lamotte and Lacorne) and associated pegmatites and quartz veins (ca. 2,621-2,655: 
Gariépy and Allègre 1985, Feng and Kerrich 1991). The final intrusive activity in the area 
was the Proterozoic diabase dykes. The regional metamorphic grade is greenschist facies 
and close to the batholith is hornblende hornfels facies contact metamorphism.  

A more detailed discussion of the geology of the peraluminous plutons and the associated 
pegmatite dykes, albitite dykes and quartz veins can be found in earlier Technical Reports.  

7.2 Local Geology 

The geology of La Corne and Fiedmont Townships has been discussed in reports by 
Tremblay 1950, Dawson 1966 and Mulja et al., 1995a and is shown on the Geological 
Survey of Canada (GSC) map 999A (Tremblay 1950) and GSC map 1179A (Dawson 
1966). The stratigraphic units and the regional structure are discussed below. The 
stratigraphy is discussed from oldest to youngest, and a map of the local geology is shown 
in Figure 7.1. 

7.2.1 Malartic and Kinojevis Groups – Basaltic Lavas 

The volcanic rocks are generally fine-grained and medium- to dark-green on fresh surfaces. 
They are massive or locally exhibit structures such as pillows, flow-breccia or amygdules. 
Under the microscope, the volcanic rocks are mainly green hornblende, plagioclase with 
minor amounts of quartz, epidote, biotite and chlorite. The accessory minerals include 
titanite, apatite, magnetite, pyrite and leucoxene (alteration product of ilmenite). The 
abundant green hornblende shows incipient alteration to chlorite or partial replacement by 
Holmquistite.  



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 18 

Figure 7.1 Local Geology Map 

 

7.2.2 Kewagama Group – Biotite Schist 

The biotite schists are conformably interbedded with the basaltic lavas. The schists are 
mainly sedimentary in origin derived from greywacke, sandstone and conglomerate. The 
biotite schist beds are up to 40 cm thick, fine-grained and are grey to black on fresh 
surfaces. They are foliated with the foliation parallel with either the contact or the foliation in 
the outcrops of the Preissac-Lacorne batholith. Under the microscope, the biotite schist 
consists mainly of quartz, plagioclase and biotite. Hornblende and chlorite are major 
components in a few beds. The common accessory minerals are apatite, epidote, 
tourmaline, pyrite and magnetite.  

7.2.3 Metaperidotite 

The metaperidotite is interbedded with basaltic lavas, and less commonly with biotite 
schists. Metaperidotite is fine-grained and black or dark green in colour. The weathered 
surface is typically brown and exhibits a variety of including polygonal fracture systems, 
pseudo-pillow structures and a "platy structure" (likely komatiite). The metaperidotite 
consists mainly of felted aggregates of chlorite flakes, acicular to prismatic actinolite, fibrous 
serpentine and talc flakes with accessory magnetite, carbonate and pyrite. The "platy 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 19 

structure" consists of planar concentrations of chlorite + serpentine alternating with similarly 
shaped concentrations of actinolite + magnetite. Primary olivine and / or pyroxene relicts 
are pseudomorphed by aggregates of chlorite, serpentine, talc, magnetite and carbonate.  

7.2.4 Lacorne Pluton 

The Lacorne pluton has been described by Mulja et al., 1995a. It is dominated by biotite 
monzogranite which gives way inward to two-mica and muscovite monzogranite The 
geology of the Lacorne pluton is similar to that of the rest of the Preissac-Lacorne batholith 
and shown diagrammatically in Figure 7.2, and explained briefly below. 

1. Early side-wall crystallization produces marginal biotite monzogranite and less 
dense crystal-layer melts which ascend to the roof of the magma chamber. 

2. Fractional crystallization continues to form successive two-mica and muscovite 
monzogranite layers and more differentiated melts. 

3. Expulsion of pegmatite-forming volatile-rich magma from the chamber due to fluid 
overpressure results in the emplacement of the beryl pegmatite in the overlying 
monzogranite. 

4. Later contraction of the pluton on cooling, reactivates fractures in the country rock 
and produces new fractures, into which the more evolved melts are intruded. This 
gives rise to the spodumene-beryl and spodumene pegmatites.

7.2.5 Proterozoic Gabbro / Diabase Dykes 

There are post-batholithic gabbro / diabase dykes which outcrop in the batholith and nearby 
as tabular bodies up to 60m wide and several kilometres long, striking either N25º E or 
N40º E and dipping vertically. The gabbro is fin - to medium-grained and tends to be 
ophitic. 

7.2.6 Manneville Fault 

In addition to the units above, the Manneville Fault, which is a major strike fault, is 
occasionally exposed in the basaltic lava outcrops along the north side of the batholith. As a 
result of the strike of N80º W, the distance between the fault and the batholith varies from 
approximately 3.2 km north of Preissac to less than 1.6 km at Lac Roy. It locally contains 
some base-metal sulphides. The Manneville Fault is believed to be a dip-slip fault because 
the biotite schist band east of Lac Roy shows slight evidence of strike-slip displacement. 
Many of the lithium-bearing dykes occur less than 2.5 km SW of and roughly parallel with 
the Manneville Fault zone.  

7.3 Property Geology 

7.3.1  General Description 

The spodumene pegmatites on the Property are very poorly exposed and as a result most 
of the information on the spodumene dykes was initially obtained by diamond drilling. Two 
spodumene dykes are exposed in the trenches on the hill south of the old mine and they 
are considered as the original mineralized showing on the Property. Mining on the Property 
commenced in 1955 and although the three-dimensional nature of the dykes became more 
evident, the characteristics identified in exploration remained more or less the same. On the 
whole property the rocks are split between granodiorite of the Lacorne Batholith, volcanics 
and some biotite schists as well as the pegmatite dykes which mainly intrude the 
granodiorite and the volcanics. The principal units will be discussed below but a more 
complete description can be seen in Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of 
November 2010. Figure 7.3 shows the property geology showing the surface projection of 
spodumene bearing dykes as interpreted in that report.

Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 22 

Figure 7.3 Property Geology Map 

 

7.3.2 Volcanics 

Volcanic rocks on the Property are represented by dark green mafic metavolcanics and 
medium grey silicified intermediate volcanics. The mafic metavolcanic rocks are medium 
grey to dark grey-green colour and cryptocrystalline to very fine-grained. The metavolcanic 
rocks are predominantly massive, but locally exhibit compositional banding in which the 
amphibole is slightly coarser grained. Some mafic volcanic rocks are weakly to moderately 
foliated with minor dark green amphibole-dominant bands and irregular patches mainly 
following the foliation. Overall the mafic volcanic rocks are very hard to scratch, and locally 
magnetic. 

Both mafic and intermediate volcanic rocks are affected by moderate to strong pervasive 
silicification, minor chloritization and patchy to pervasive lithium alteration. There is 
alteration of the green hornblende in proximity to the spodumene pegmatite. 

There are also amphibolites which are fine-grained, weakly foliated and dark green. A salt-
and-pepper appearance occurs locally where plagioclase is more dominant. Amphibolite is 
hard to scratch. Amphibolites are affected by strong pervasive potassic alteration, visible as 
biotitization and pervasive or patchy lithium alteration.

Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 23 

7.3.3 Granodiorite 

The granodiorite is medium grey to greenish grey, massive, coarse grained to porphryritic, 
and exhibits a "salt-and-pepper" appearance. Figure 7.4 shows a fresh, massive, coarse-
grained porphryritic granodiorite, in drill hole QL-S09-028. Granodiorite locally contains 
fragments of the same composition or that are slightly enriched in muscovite. The main 
mineral constituents of granodiorite are light grey to greenish white plagioclase (40-45 
volume %), dark green to black amphibole (most likely hornblende; 15-20 volume %), mica 
(20 volume %) - represented by biotite and muscovite, grey quartz (10-15 volume %) and 
minor epidote, chlorite and disseminated sulfides. The grain size ranges from 0.5 to 5 mm. 
Granodiorite has patchy to pervasive lithium and / or chlorite alteration, weak epidote 
alteration and locally pervasive potassic alteration. 

Figure 7.4 Massive, Coarse-grained Porphryritic Granodiorite 

 

7.3.4 Pegmatite Dykes 

Three different types of pegmatite dykes have been identified based on mineralogy and 
textures: PEG1, PEG2 and PEG3. They are described below. The main differences 
between the three types of pegmatite dykes are the amount of spodumene in the dyke, the 
feldspar and quartz content, the texture of the pegmatite and presence or absence of 
zoning. 

PEG1 dykes are zoned. Three mineralogical / textural zones have been identified and are 
described as intersected in drill core from stratigraphic top to bottom:  

1. Border zone. 2-10 cm of medium grained white to pale grey pegmatite, mainly 
composed of plagioclase and quartz without spodumene, see Figure 7.5.  

2. Spodumene zone. Medium- to coarse-grained pegmatite (35-40 volume % quartz, 
40-45 volume % plagioclase) and white to pale yellowish-green interstitial crystals of 
spodumene (5-20 volume %). Spodumene crystals are typically perpendicular to the 
dyke walls, but can be randomly oriented. Spodumene content increases towards 
the center of the dyke. The width of the zone varies from several cm up to 25m. 
Rocks with a medium grained, more aplitic appearance are included in this 
spodumene bearing zone. However, this aplitic rock could be a different generation 
of vein. 

3. Quartz core. 5 to 50 cm zone of massive, medium- to coarse-grained grey quartz 
with very rare plagioclase or spodumene crystals. Spodumene near the quartz core 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 24 

is white, elongated and crystals up to 10 cm long and 1 cm wide were observed in 
outcrop, Figures 7.5.  

4. Spodumene zone. Medium to coarse-grained pegmatite (35-40 volume % quartz, 
40-50 volume % plagioclase) with white euhedral and pale yellowish-green 
interstitial crystals of spodumene (5-20 volume %) and rare aggregates of mica 
(biotite). The size of the spodumene crystals is from 0.2 cm to 14 cm. 

5. 1-10 cm border zone (fine-grained aplitic zone). Distinct change in grain size and 
colour. The pegmatite becomes fine-grained and uniformly grey, mainly composed 
of quartz-plagioclase-K-feldspar. Very similar to the border zone at the stratigraphic 
top of PEG1.  

Spodumene grain size can be highly variable within a zone and overall through the entire 
intersection.  

Figure 7.5 PEG1 Pegmatite Dyke with Zoning  

 

PEG2 dykes are not zoned and are coarse to medium-grained, light grey and with pale 
yellowish-green crystals of spodumene (5-15 volume %), grey quartz (35-40 volume %), 
white megacrystals of plagioclase and K-feldspar (40-50 volume % and most likely albite 
and orthoclase), occasional mm-sized garnets, light coloured mica (lepidolite?), flakes of 
biotite, specks of molybdenite, very rare chalcopyrite surrounded by brownish anhedral 
mineral with resinous lustre (possibly sphalerite). The spodumene mineralization occurs 
from contact to contact with no apparent zonation. Concentration varies from 2-3 volume % 
to approximately 20 volume %. 

Spodumene crystals can be both tabular and needle-shaped within the same intersection. 
Euhedral crystals are common. Tabular crystals tend to coarser grained ranging up to 7 cm 
in length as shown in Figure 7.5. Preferred orientations are exhibited by some spodumene 
crystals (typically more with tabular crystals) and can form both the matrix or fill the 
interstices between larger quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar grains. PEG2 is very similar to 
zones 2 and 4 of PEG1-type dykes, but PEG2 has higher contents of K-feldspar, epidote 
and mica.

PEG3 dykes are quartz dominant and contain less than 1% spodumene. They are medium 
to coarse grained, light pink-grey to medium grey creamy pink colour, with black or grey 
patches of mica (biotite and muscovite). Megacrystals of mica form up to 40% of the rock 
locally. PEG3 dykes are variable in width from 0.4 to 8.0m, contain small vugs and are very 
hard to scratch and cut.

7.4.1 Historic Descriptions 

According to Derry (1950), approximately 10 separate dykes were intersected by diamond 
drilling on the property as shown in Figure 7.8. from Mulligan 1965. This vertical section is 
looking N76º W and shows steeply dipping unzoned quartz-feldspar-spodumene dykes. 
Several of the dykes are exposed on the hill south of the mine. The narrower dykes are 
simple quartz-feldspar dykes, but the majority of the dykes that are greater than 
approximately 3m in width are spodumene-bearing. The three most persistent spodumene 
dykes (continuous from hole to hole) were named dykes A, B and C. The spodumene dykes 
vary in width from tens of centimetres to approximately 14m and had been traced up to 
approximately 200m in length (Tremblay, 1950). As interpreted from the drilling, dyke A was 
traced for approximately 180m laterally and varies from approximately 3 to 15m in true 
width; Rowe, 1953). Dyke B is a lens approximately 3m in length and has a true width of 
approximately 6.5m. Dyke C has been traced for approximately 100m horizontally and has 
an average width of approximately 3m. The drill core indicates that the dykes are parallel 
striking 60 to 70º NW (nearly parallel to the main granite contact in this area) and dipping 
40 to 60º S (Derry, 1950).  

Figure 7.8 Simplified Vertical Section Showing Dykes 

 

The spodumene is typically white to cream (or buff) in colour which indicates low iron 
content as opposed to the green colour that is more common in the Preissac-La Corne 
district. Spodumene near the mine shaft area is white, fine- to medium-grained and oriented 
normal to the dyke walls. Minor coarse-grained crystals are more random in orientation. 
Spodumene in the east zone is reported as pale green, medium-grained and strongly 
oriented normal to the granodiorite contacts. Some spodumene is locally altered to a dark 
green colour, especially near an underground water-course, and leached spodumene and 
feldspar occur in the fissure.

Later after opening up the deposit underground, Karpoff (1955), Chief Engineer and 
Geologist for the Quebec Lithium mine, states that almost all of the complex pegmatites 
display zoning: 1) border zone, 2) wall zone and 3) intermediate or inner zone, but this 
zoning is so insignificant and is not always completely revealed that he considered for 
mining purposes that the pegmatite dyke is spodumene-bearing from wall to wall. Karpoff 
(1955), reports that the border zone is generally less than 1 cm wide. The border zone has 
a very fine-grained texture and is composed mostly of white feldspar. The wall zone is also 
very narrow from a few centimeters to a maximum of approximately 30 cm and occurs only 
in a few places. It is a fine-grained zone composed mostly of white feldspar (platy 
cleavelandite), white to light brown quartz and some light buff to green spodumene oriented 
normal to the walls. The intermediate or inner zone represents the bulk of the pegmatite 
bodies. It has a fine- to medium-grained texture composed of 40% feldspar (albite, 
microcline and perthite), 35% quartz and 25% spodumene. The coarse feldspar crystals 
(microcline) and spodumene are uniformly oriented normal to the walls of the pegmatite 
dyke. Dyke B shows a fourth zone, the quartz core. In this particular case, the zones are 
much wider and some beryl crystals were noted in the wall zone. 

Karpoff (1955) made the following observations on the spodumene within the pegmatite 
dykes based on surface drilling and underground workings, keeping in mind that the 
pegmatite dykes dip to the south and the granodiorite-volcanic contact dips to the north:  

• The richest concentration of spodumene occurs at or near the granodiorite-volcanics 
contact.  

• At a distance of 500 to 600 feet above the contact in the volcanic rocks, the 
pegmatite dykes become weak, narrow and low grade.  

• In the granodiorite, the pegmatite dykes remain strong and become low in 
spodumene only at a distance of 1,600 feet below the contact.  

• The amount of spodumene decrease with an increase in pink orthoclase feldspar. 
The K-feldspar begins to appear in the dykes within the granodiorite at a distance of 
about 1600 feet below the contact.  

• The spodumene is white to light green in the mafic volcanic rocks and buff to light 
grey in the granodiorite. The spodumene crystals are also finer grained in the mafic 
volcanic rocks. 

• The iron content in the spodumene is higher in the mafic volcanic rocks above the 
contact than in the granodiorite.  

• The grade and uniformity of the spodumene pegmatite dykes are affected by the 
degree of orientation of the crystals. The part of the dykes in which the crystals lie at 
any direction (random orientation) are lower than the well oriented sections.  

• Structural considerations suggest that the zone of pegmatitic dykes will have a 
depth extension of at 2,500 feet (approximately 762m) down the contact.  

7.4.2 Observations from CLQ's Drill Programs  

The following observations have been gathered from the CLQ diamond drill programs 
carried out in 2009, 2010 and 2011. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION

Three types of pegmatite dykes form a co-linear bifurcating array in the centre of the 
Property. These dykes are designated PEG1 and PEG2 (both spodumene-bearing) and 
PEG3 (<1% spodumene). The majority of the dykes intersected in the 2009 drill program 
are spodumene-bearing and include the six main dykes historically mined. The spodumene 
dykes vary in width from 0.35m to 45m and have been intersected over and are interpreted 
to extend for several hundred metres in length. The dykes strike roughly 300º to 320º, 
roughly parallel to the contact of the Lacorne Pluton in this area and dip steeply to the 
south-east. 

The 2009 drilling data and bulk sample outcrops suggest that PEG1 dykes exhibit well 
developed vertical zonation. This zonation has not been studied in detail but appears 
consistent with Karpoff's 1955 description. The transition between zones is gradual. Quartz 
cores have only been observed within intersections of the thicker spodumene dykes and in 
outcrop. 

The border zone in PEG1 dykes is generally 1-10 cm wide. It has a very fine-grained aplitic 
texture and is composed mostly of white feldspar. The spodumene zone exhibits a range of 
grain size from fine- to coarse and forms the majority of the pegmatite. Millimetre-size white 
to pale green interstitial spodumene crystals fill the interstices between intervals of very 
coarse-grained to megacrystic spodumene. In Figure 7.9 such a fine grained border zone is 
seen in PEG1 on the contact with the host rock (dark rock on the right), in drill hole QL-
M042C. 

PEG1 and PEG2 are composed of 30-40% feldspar (albite, microcline, orthoclase and 
perthite), 30-50% quartz and 5-25% spodumene. The megacrystals of plagioclase, K-
feldspar and spodumene are subhedral to euhedral and are either orientated perpendicular 
to dyke contacts or are randomly oriented. The footwall zone was intersected in several 
holes. This zone is very narrow, from 2-3 cm to a maximum of 20-30 cm. The footwall zone 
is fine-grained and consists mostly of white plagioclase (albite) and pinkish orthoclase and 
microcline, white to light grey quartz and light buff to pale green spodumene, epidote and 
mica.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES  

This has been adapted and abridged from Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of 
November 2010. 

8.1 Rare-element Pegmatites of the Superior Province 

Rare-element pegmatites may host several economic commodities, such as tantalum (Ta-
oxide minerals), tin (Sn) (cassiterite), lithium (Li) (ceramic-grade spodumene and petalite), 
rubidium (Rb) (lepidolite and K-feldspar), and cesium (Cs) (pollucite) collectively known as 
rare elements, and ceramic-grade feldspar and quartz (Selway et al., 2005). Two families of 
rare-element pegmatites are common in the Superior Province, Canada: Li-Cs-Ta enriched 
(LCT) and niobium-yttrium-fluorine (Nb-Y-F or NY). LCT pegmatites are associated with S-
type, peraluminous (aluminium-rich), quartz-rich granites. S-type granites crystallize from a 
magma produced by partial melting of preexisting sedimentary source rock. They are 
characterized by the presence of biotite and muscovite, and the absence of hornblende. 
NYF pegmatites are enriched in rare earth elements (REE), uranium, and thorium in 
addition to Nb, Y, F, and are associated with A-type, subaluminous to metaluminous 
(aluminium-poor), quartz-poor granites or syenites (Černý, 1991).  

Rare-element pegmatites derived from a fertile granite intrusion are typically distributed 
over a 10 to 20 km2 area within 10 km of the fertile granite (Breaks and Tindle, 1997). A 
fertile granite is the parental granite to rare-element pegmatite dykes. The granitic melt first 
crystallizes several different granitic units (e.g., biotite granite to two mica granite to 
muscovite granite), due to an evolving melt composition, within a single parental fertile 
granite pluton. The residual melt enriched in incompatible elements (e.g., Rb, Cs, Nb, Ta, 
Sn) and volatiles (e.g., H2O, Li, F, BO3, and PO4) from such a pluton can then migrate into 
the host rock and crystallize pegmatite dykes (Figure 8.1). Volatiles promote the 
crystallization of a few large crystals from a melt and increase the ability of the melt to travel 
greater distances. This results in pegmatite dykes with coarse-grained crystals occurring in 
country rocks considerable distances from their parent granite intrusions. Figure 8.1 shows 
the chemical evolution of lithium-rich pegmatites with distance from the granitic source 
(London, 2008). 

8.2 Lacorne Pluton Rare-Element Pegmatites 

The rare-element pegmatites associated with the Lacorne pluton are LCT pegmatites 
because they are enriched in Li and Ta and they are associated with the S-type Lacorne 
pluton (biotite to two-mica to muscovite monzogranite). The Lacorne pluton is the fertile 
parental granite from which the pegmatites were derived. The presence of garnet, 
molybdenite, columbite-tantalite and sphalerite in the muscovite monzogranite indicates 
that the Lacorne pluton is fertile granite rather than barren granite (Mulja et al. 1995a).

Figure 8.1 Chemical Evolution of Lithium-rich Pegmatites over Distance  

 

The pegmatites are regionally zoned from the Lacorne pluton outwards: beryl pegmatites to 
spodumene-beryl pegmatites, spodumene pegmatites to molybdenite-bearing albitite to 
molybdenite-quartz veins. 

These rare-element pegmatites show features similar to other rare-element pegmatites of 
the Superior province:  

1. The pegmatites occur within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt near the contact with the 
Pontiac subprovince. Many of the lithium dykes lie less than 2.5 km SW of and 
approximately parallel to the Manneville Fault zone.

2. The regional metamorphic grade is greenschist facies. 

3. The pegmatites are genetically derived from the fertile Lacorne pluton. 

4. The pegmatites are hosted by mafic metavolcanic rocks (i.e., basaltic lavas of 
Kinojevis group). 

5. The mafic metavolcanic rocks have been metasomatized to produce Holmquistite 
along the contact with the Lacorne pluton. 

6. The dominant Li-mineral is spodumene and the dominant Ta-mineral is columbite-
tantalite. Cs-minerals have not yet been found in the pegmatites.  

7. The columbite-tantalite crystals occur in the albite.

9 EXPLORATION 

This has been adapted and abridged from Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of 
November 2010. For more information and all the drawings the reader is referred to that 
report. As the pegmatite dykes were known to exist prior to CLQ's acquisition of the 
Property, exploration by CLQ has mainly consisted of drilling, which is described in this 
section. However being a lithium deposit, the collection of metallurgical samples at an early 
stage was very important and the field collection of these is also covered in this section. 

9.1 Introduction  

The Property was acquired by CLQ in 2008. In June of that year, collection of samples for 
preliminary metallurgical testwork was carried out. In December 2008, Caracle Creek 
International Consulting Inc. (CCIC) was retained to complete a review and compilation of 
the historic mine data.  

In 2009, subsequent to the 2008 conceptual resource model referred to under "CCIC 
Compilation" below, diamond drilling was completed for geological, geotechnical and 
metallurgical purposes. Two bulk samples were also taken to further metallurgical studies. 
This work resulted in the estimation of an NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource and a 
completed PFS by Hardie et al., 2010.  

A diamond drilling program was completed in 2010 to further define and potentially increase 
the resource base of the Property. An updated mineral resource estimate was completed 
with this information and released on 28 October, 2010. Additional drilling was also 
completed in 2010 for geotechnical and hydrological investigations required as part of the 
feasibility study (FS). The following sections describe the exploration activities by period 
and activity.  

9.2 2008 Field Program 

Eight holes were drilled by Forage Xtreme of Val-D'Or in June 2008 solely for the purpose 
of collecting spodumene pegmatite. The holes were not logged for lithology, down hole 
surveys were not completed and drill collars not surveyed. The pegmatite was sampled 
manually using a hammer, packed in rice bags that were sealed with tape and plastic cable 
ties. Additional pegmatite material was collected from a pile of rocks located near the 
tailings dam on the old mill site and this material was similarly prepared, packaged and all 
was delivered by a CLQ representative to SGS Lakefield in July, 2008.  

9.3 CCIC Compilation 2009 

Historic mine data was digitized and the 3D extents of the underground workings in the 
mine were constructed based on this information and mining widths cited in the historic 
reports. The collars of all available historic drill holes were digitized and basic lithology and 
hole orientation information compiled from the associated drill logs and plans. The resulting 
database for use in the 3D modelling was composed of 81 surface and 412 underground 
holes. Drill holes were displayed using Surpac Vision v. 6.1.3 and 3D solids of the 
spodumene dykes were constructed based on mine plans, drill hole intercepts and the 
interpreted surface geology.

AMC 711013: January 2012 34 

From a 10 x 10 x 10m block model which was constructed over the mine area, the tonnage 
of a conceptual exploration target for the Property was estimated. Grades were assigned 
into the blocks from the old quoted figure which had grades by cross section and dyke. 

9.4 2009 Field Program 

A drill program was designed by CCIC to twin several of the historic drill holes and to test 
the interpreted spodumene pegmatite thicknesses and available assay data. Holes were 
also drilled to test some of the dykes at depth and at a distance from the old workings.  

In November 2009, two outcrops of spodumene pegmatite were stripped and trenches 
excavated to an approximate 1m depth. This was carried out to provide a sample for 
metallurgical testwork. G.E.S.T. Inc. was contracted to manage the blasting program 
including permitting requirements.  

Both trenches exposed relatively thick pegmatite dykes (up to 8m thick) and are described 
below. 

Trench #1 is approximately 28m long and 10m wide. The trench is centred at 292,006m E, 
5,365,687m N, and 436 m elevation as recorded with a hand-held Garmin GPS (model 
GPSMAP 76CSx). The stripping uncovered an internally zoned, spodumene pegmatite 
(PEG1 type), close to the contact of the granodiorite with mafic volcanic rocks. The outcrop 
consists of a thin quartz core (approximately 1.25m long and x 25 cm thick) oriented 
roughly parallel with the dyke contacts. The quartz core is surrounded by pegmatite 
containing irregular lenses of granodiorite and amphibolite. Spodumene megacrystals are 
up to 16 cm long. Megacrystals of albite are very common.  

Stripping at Trench #2 revealed a spodumene pegmatite (PEG1 type) intruded into mafic 
volcanic rocks and amphibolites. The dyke extends the full width of the trench 
(approximately 8m) and does not display any internal zonation. Spodumene crystals are 
randomly oriented and up to 10 cm in length. The centre of the trench (approximately 12m 
long) is located at the following coordinates, which were recorded using a hand-held 
Garmin GPS (model GPSMAP 76 CSx): 292,235m E, 5,365,614m N, elevation 466m.  

Pegmatite from both trenches was placed in rice bags, sealed with tape and plastic cable 
ties and shipped as one approximately 600 kg sample to SGS Lakefield.  

While AMC was not involved in the sample collection, it is satisfied that the samples are 
representative of the spodumene pegmatite mineralization at that location for the purposes 
of preliminary metallurgical testing.

Figure 9.1 Pegmatite Outcrop for Bulk Sample 

 

In late 2009, a metallurgical drill program was commenced to provide additional material for 
metallurgical testwork. This was mainly implemented in January 2010, so is discussed 
below. 

9.5 2010 Field Program 

A 45-hole exploration drilling program was completed from late April through June 2010. 
This program focused on extending the strike length of the known deposit and on infill 
drilling to increase the level of confidence in the mineral resources. Results of the drill 
program are further described in Section 10.0.  

A metallurgical diamond drilling program, consisting of 67 short HQ holes for a total 
1,010m, was undertaken at seven locations as shown in Figure 10.2. A CCIC geologist 
logged the holes in their entirety prior to sampling. Major Drilling International Inc. (Major 
Drilling) was the contractor for the metallurgical drilling. The majority of the drill holes were 
collared within the stripped areas of the bulk sample material. Down-hole surveys were not 
completed on these holes. The spodumene bearing pegmatite was separated from the host 
rock manually using a hammer. Pegmatite intervals were placed in labelled rice bags and 
sealed with tape and plastic cable ties. Every bag contained approximately 3m of core, 
totalling 546m of HQ core (approximately 4,641 kg). One hundred and eighty two bags of 
pegmatite were delivered by a CLQ representative to SGS Lakefield for test work. While 
AMC was not involved in the sample collection, it is satisfied that, the material collected 
from the pegmatite is representative of the spodumene mineralization in the dykes on the 
Property and appropriate for use in advancing the metallurgical studies for the PFS.

In addition, several holes were drilled for geotechnical and hydrological investigations as 
part of the ongoing FS activities during August through September as quantified in Table 
9.1. Fieldwork associated with this drilling included soil and rock sampling, water level 
surveys, and bathymetry and sediment sampling in Lac Lortie. Geotechnical laboratory 
testing of soil samples was also undertaken. The results of the drilling and fieldwork have 
been incorporated into the FS.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Introduction 

This text has been partly adapted and abridged from Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical 
Report of November 2010. Three programs of exploration and resource definition drilling 
have now been completed by CLQ since acquisition of the Property. Metallurgical and 
geotechnical drilling has also been completed and has been discussed earlier in Section 9. 
After reviewing the historic data in early 2009, CCIC recommended a verification / 
delineation surface diamond drill program to twin approximately 5% of the historic holes and 
check pegmatite intersections and continuity along strike of the mined area. The 2010 
program was designed to continue testing the continuity of the deposit and potentially 
upgrade and increase the total resource. For completeness all drilling carried out by CLQ is 
summarized in Table 10.1.

10.2 2009 Drilling Program 

In this program six main spodumene dykes were tested and their locations confirmed. 
Enough information was obtained in the 2009 drill program to support the historic resource 
estimate, the geological model and the conceptual target. Part of this program was 
specifically designed to twin old (LV) holes, and the results of that portion of the program is 
discussed in Section 10.3. The detailed descriptions of the rock types and the spodumene 
mineralization intersected by the 2009 drill holes are presented in Section 7.3 in the Stone, 
M and Ilieva, T, Technical Report of April 2010, and have been summarized in this report 
along with results.  

This program consisted of 38 NQ-sized diamond drill holes and one wedge. Approximately 
9,646m were drilled, surveyed and sampled during the third quarter of 2009. Nine holes 
were abandoned because of technical difficulties or inappropriate down-hole deviation and 
were re-drilled (approximately 470m).  

The holes were drilled on eight sections intersecting spodumene pegmatite dykes 
approximately perpendicular to their strike (overall NW-SE, hole bearings were typically 18° 
or 45° (see the drill plan in Figure 10.1). The dykes generally dip 70° to 75° toward the 
south or southwest. Holes were angled typically at -45° or -60° to cut the interpreted true 
width of the dyke, in a close to normal intersection. See Figure 10.2 for a representative 
section showing the drillhole orientation in relationship to the dykes.

Twenty four holes were drilled by Orbit Garant Drilling Inc. (Orbit) and 14 holes were 
completed by Major Drilling. 

A Reflex EZ-Shot (Major Drilling) or Flexit single shot (Orbit) survey was performed at 
approximately 50m intervals down-hole. The casing was left in 29 holes, which were 
capped to allow for future down-hole testing and / or extension. GPS coordinates of all 
collar locations were recorded and tied into the exploration grid.  

The results of the 2009 drill program confirmed the data used to construct the geological 
model representing the exploration target developed for the Property, and also that the 
mineralization continues to the northwest and southeast of the currently mined area.

10.3 Results of the Twinning Program 

A number of holes in this program were specifically designed to validate the historical LV 
series holes, in order to allow their acceptance into the database. Many of the LV holes are 
in the area of old workings thus are difficult to repeat and also because of this are important 
to the estimate. A discussion hole by hole is found in Stone, M. and Llieva, T., Technical 
Report of April 2010, in Section 14.2. AMC carried out an analysis of the information and 
has tabulated the comparison as best fits in Table 10.3.  

The comparison is not perfect due to logistics resulting in some of the holes not being true 
twins and located some distance apart. In the table, a third comparison is inserted which 
shows the average grade of the zone from the historical estimate which is taken from Table 
10.1 in Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 2010. The table below 
substantiates the statement from the above report that "Assays for the new holes are higher 
typically by 0.1 to 0.4% Li2O than historic values". However this possible upside has not 
been built into the old data in the estimate. 

On the basis of the work carried out, AMC supports the use of the old data in the 2011 
estimate. In addition to using data, dummy (pseudo) holes were used in the area of the 
stopes. This is elaborated on in Section 14.

10.4 2010 Drilling Program 

This program consisted of 45 NQ-sized diamond drill holes which are shown on plan in 
Figure 10.3. Approximately 6,938m were drilled, surveyed and sampled during the second 
quarter of 2010.  

The holes were drilled on 14 sections intersecting spodumene pegmatite dykes 
approximately perpendicular to their strike (overall NW-SE), hole bearings were

approximately 45°. The dykes generally dip 70° to 75° toward the south or southwest. Holes 
were again angled typically at -45° to cut the interpreted true width of the dyke. 

Major Drilling was engaged as the drilling contractor. Again down-hole surveys were 
completed using a Reflex EZ-Shot at approximately 50m intervals down-hole. GPS 
coordinates of all collar locations were recorded and tied into the exploration grid.  

The previous geological model was supported by the results of the drilling. The deposit 
comprises a series of steeply dipping spodumene-bearing pegmatite dykes that bifurcate 
and coalesce. Dyke true thicknesses range up to tens of metres. The composite body 
extends more than 1.5 km in approximately a NW-SE direction over a width of 
approximately 500m. There is one main persistent set of dykes that strikes obliquely to this 
main orientation.

were again angled typically at around -45° to cut the interpreted true width of the dyke.

completed using a Reflex EZ-Shot at approximately 50m intervals down-hole. GPS 
coordinates of all collar locations were recorded and tied into the exploration grid. All land 
surveys were completed by personnel working for, J.L. Corriveau & Ass. Inc.

10.6 Bulk Density Measurements 

Bulk density measurements were taken from drill core and determined by the water 
immersion method. The samples were weighed in air, recorded, then placed in a 
basket suspended in the water and the weight was again recorded. The samples were not 
waxed or sealed. However AMC does not consider natural voids to be a significant issue 
with respect to bulk density determination and accepts the values as presented. 

The formula used was as follows: 

(Sample weight in air) 
(Sample weight in air) – (Sample weight in water) 

This was carried out on the 2009 drill core only as all the 2010 core was on pallets and 
frozen at the time of carrying out this work. At least one sample was taken from each hole 
in the program for each of the main three rock types. All samples were NQ core and 
approximately 15 cm long. Fifty samples were taken from each rock type. 

The work was supervised by Mitchell Lavery V.P. Exploration for CLQ and he chose the 
samples, recorded the weights and set up the Excel file. The average figures are shown in 
Table 10.3.  

Table 10.3 Bulk Density Values by Lithology 

Rock Type Number of measurements Average value t/m3 
Granodiorite 50 2.77 

Dykes 50 2.69 
Volcanics 50 3.07 

AMC notes these bulk density values were carried out in April 2011 on samples from the 
2009 program. No further measurements were taken in 2011, either for core from the 2010 
or 2011 drilling campaigns, and AMC recommends that this gap be filled.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

This text has been adapted from Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 
2010 for the pre 2011 data collection, handling and QA/QC procedures. AMC has 
discussed those programs with Mr Lavery and Ms Stone in a site visit in March 2011. In 
addition a second visit was made when the 2011 drilling program was being carried and 
AMC is satisfied that the data was collected in a manner which meets appropriate industry 
standards. 

11.1 Site Procedures 

11.1.1 General 

During the 2009, 2010 and 2011 drill programs, core was laid in wooden core boxes at the 
drill site, sealed with a lid and strapped with plastic bindings. The core was transported from 
the drill site by the drill contractor or CLQ personnel to CLQ's core facility in Val-d'Or. Upon 
arrival at the core facility, the core was washed, logged and split using a diamond blade 
saw under the on-site supervision of a geologist. 

After cutting, the core samples were sealed with a plastic cable tie in labelled plastic bags 
with their corresponding sample tag. The plastic sample bags were placed in large rice 
sacks and secured with tape and a plastic cable tie for shipping to the laboratory. The drill 
hole and sample numbers were also labeled on the outside of each rice sack and checked 
against the contents prior to sealing the sacks. Standards and blanks were inserted into the 
sample sequence prior to shipping. Samples from individual holes constitute individual 
batches of samples sent to the laboratory.  

Core recovery was excellent for these programs, being typically over 95%.with only 
occasional areas of sheared core with poor recovery.  

11.1.2 Historic Data 

There is no record in the historic information available specific to the sampling method of 
the underground or surface drill holes, or the analytical method used to determine the Li2O 
content. A review of the drill logs indicates that sample intervals ranged from approximately 
3 cm to 31m, with an average value of approximately 2.4m. Assay values in percent Li2O 
are reported (typed or hand-written on drill logs) but no original assay certificates are 
available to confirm these grades. Eight hundred and six assays are reported in 61 of the 
surface drill holes. Some reported grades appear to be composites. There is no grade 
information available for the underground drilling. This is discussed further in Section 14.1. 

11.1.3 2009 Drill Program 

All drill core from the 2009 confirmation program was logged, split and stored in CLQ's core 
facility in Val-d'Or. The drill core was washed, photographed and logged prior to sampling. 
Core logging and sampling were carried out by CCIC Geologists, one of whom was 
responsible for managing and supervising the 2009 drill program on-site. Geological 
descriptions and geotechnical information were recorded directly into Coreview v. 5.0.0 
software (Visidata Pty Ltd.), which was exported and backed up nightly on a secure data 
server.

Core samples were routinely sawn in half. One half of the sampled interval was submitted 
for analysis and the remaining core was retained in the core box for reference and future 
verification or testing if required. The nominal sample interval was 1m, or less if the 
pegmatite was less than 1m in width. Lengths were adjusted as necessary to reflect 
geological and / or mineralization contacts. Pegmatite veins that were 0.4 to 1m in 
thickness were also sampled if spodumene was visible. Longer sample lengths were taken 
in infrequent strongly sheared core or sections with poor core recoveries. Twenty three 
hundred and forty two core samples were collected from 38 drill holes. 

It was stated in Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 2010 that there 
are no known drilling, sampling or recovery factors anticipated to result in a material 
sampling bias, or otherwise materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the Li assay 
results, and AMC agrees with that statement. Also in AMC's opinion, the sampling method 
used for the 2009 drilling program would produce representative samples of appropriate 
quality for Li analysis and resource estimation purposes. In 2009 samples were delivered to 
SGS Lakefield by a CLQ representative. Sample shipments were recorded and tracked 
using an MS Excel worksheet. 

11.1.4 2010 Drill Program 

A new core facility was constructed in Val-d'Or in 2010 and all logging, sawing and storage 
equipment moved to the new facility. The 2010 logging and sampling was supervised again 
by a CCIC senior geologist, and logging undertaken by two CCIC geologists. The same 
protocols for logging, core cutting and sampling were used as per the 2009 drill program. 
Core samples were sawn in half. One half of the sampled interval was submitted for Li 
analysis. The nominal sample interval was 1m with more than 93% of the samples being 
1m or less. Lengths were adjusted as necessary to reflect geological and / or mineralization 
contacts which creates the samples of less than 1m length. A total of 1,454 core samples 
were collected from 41 drill holes. In 2010 due to a change of primary laboratory, samples 
were delivered by CLQ personnel to the ALS Laboratory Group (ALS) preparation facility in 
Val-d'Or. 

11.1.5 2011 Drill Program 

The Quebec Lithium Inc. core shack in Val-d'Or was utilized during the 2011 program and 
all the logging and sawing of core was completed at this facility. All the core from the 2011 
program is stored with previous years' core at the C-Lab core storage facility in Val d'Or. 
The 2011 logging and sampling was supervised by M.E. Lavery P. Geo., and logging was 
completed by two independent contract geologists. The same protocols for logging, core 
cutting and sampling were used as per the 2009 and 2010 drill programs. Core samples 
were sawn in half. One half of the sampled interval was submitted for Li analysis. The 
nominal sample interval was 1m with more than 93% of the samples being 1 m or less. 
Lengths were adjusted as necessary to reflect geological and/or mineralization contacts 
which creates the samples of less than 1m length. A total of 3167 core samples were 
collected from 53 drill holes. In 2011, samples were delivered by CLQ personnel to the ALS 
Laboratory Group (ALS) preparation facility in Val-d'Or, and the samples were then shipped 
to ALS facilities in either Timmins or Thunder Bay for preparation. Prepared samples were 
then shipped to Vancouver for analysis.

In order to quantify the background values since the core outside the dykes was not 
sampled, a complete hole, QL-S11-39 was sampled and submitted for analysis. Of the 139 
samples, the mean grade was 0.048% Li, the maximum was 0.173% Li and the minimum 
was 0.009% Li. 

From what AMC has seen, the sample collection was of good quality. However sampling in 
the old holes was in part selective and neither the complete dyke sampled in many 
instances nor mineralization bracketed in the normal way. This can have implications for 
resource estimation unless recognized, and if non-sampled segments are not handled 
appropriately this can lead to overestimation issues. AMC's resource estimation procedure 
has handled the issue appropriately as is discussed in Section 14. 

11.2 Assay Laboratory Procedures 

11.2.1 Historic Data 

There is no documentation of historic sample preparation, analysis or security measures 
undertaken by Quebec Lithium Corp., which completed the majority of the drilling on the 
Property prior to CLQ.  

11.2.2 2009 – 2011 Laboratory Procedures 

In all years, a primary laboratory and a check laboratory were used for the analyses. In 
2009 the core samples were prepared at SGS Lakefield and analyzed in Lakefield or the 
Toronto laboratories using a sodium peroxide fusion with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry 
(method 9-8-40) to determine the %Li content. SGS monitored the quality of the assays 
with internal pulp duplicates, blanks and standards for every batch. SGS uses NBS-181 and 
NBS-183 standards as ore-grade lithium internal standards. Check samples were prepared 
for selected samples from a split from the pulps remaining after primary analysis. These 
samples were packaged by SGS Lakefield and sent by couriers to the ALS Vancouver 
laboratory. 

Both SGS (Lakefield and Toronto) and ALS are accredited for ISO / IEC 17025:2005 and 
ISO 9001 by Standards Council of Canada. 

In 2010 the primary laboratory was ALS and the check laboratory was AGAT Laboratories 
Ltd. (AGAT). The samples were prepared at ALS Val-d'Or and analyzed in Vancouver using 
a four-acid digestion with ICP-AES finish (method Li-OG63) to determine the percent (%) Li 
content of the pulverized core samples. ALS monitored the quality of the assays with 
internal pulp duplicates, blanks and standards for every batch. ALS uses NBS-181 as an 
ore-grade lithium internal standard. Check analyses were completed on specially selected 
samples from a split from the pulps remaining after the pulps were returned to CLQ in Val-
d'Or. These samples were sent by courier to AGAT's laboratory in Mississauga, Ontario. 
These check samples were also analyzed by ICP-AES following four acid digest which is 
AGAT's method 201070, and this determined the ppm Li content for the pulverized core 
samples. Replicate analyses and blanks were used by AGAT to monitor assay quality. 

Both ALS and AGAT are accredited for ISO / IEC 17025:2005 and ISO 9001 by Standards 
Council of Canada. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 49 

In 2011 the primary laboratory remained as ALS and CLQ continued to use AGAT 
Laboratories for the Umpire samples. The procedures were the same as in 2010. 

11.3 Assay QA/QC 

For 2009-10 this has been adapted from Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of 
November 2010, which in part refers to earlier documents. As part of the review AMC has 
investigated that QA/QC data and replotted the 2009 and 2010 control charts so they are 
comparable to the 2011 charts. 

For each program, QA/QC protocols included the insertion of standards and blanks (silica 
sand) directly into the sample sequence. In addition a number of pulps were sent to a 
secondary laboratory as a check. These three activities are summarized below and 
discussed more fully in Stone, M. and Ilieva, T., Technical Report of April 2010, for the 2009 
drilling and Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 2010 for the 2010 
drilling. In all drilling campaigns the protocols were the same. The average plotted on each 
of the graphs reflects the mean figure for the year. 

11.3.1 Standards 

Every batch of samples sent to the labs had a minimum of two Li standards included. High 
and low grade Li standards were prepared by Geoscience Laboratories (Geo Labs), 
Sudbury, Ontario from a Spodumene concentrate obtained from the "Tanco" mine in 
Manitoba owned by the Cabot Corporation. These standards were termed ST-H and ST-L. 
The ST-H has a determined value of 0.424 % Li, with one Standard Deviation of 0.014% 
and ST-L has a determined value of 0.228% Li, with one Standard Deviation of 0.007%. 
These standards have not been certified. On the following graphs the standard deviation 
control lines are derived from the determined values.  

Based on 57 assays of ST-H by SGS in 2009, the average value of the high grade standard 
was determined to be 0.416% Li with a standard deviation of 0.011% Li. All of the assays of 
ST-H passed and there is no bias, as shown in Figure 11.1. Note that the dates are shown 
as February 2010 because the 2009 drilling program was completed at the end of 2009.

In 2009, ST-L was determined to have an average value of 0.225% Li based on 52 
analyses at SGS. All of the assays of ST-L passed, although there were four with warnings 
and there is no bias, as shown in Figure 11.2.

It should be noted that, in 2009, there was an issue with the primary laboratory and results 
were lower than the expected value of the external standards. After an investigation it was 
determined that the procedure for sample preparation was not being followed and samples 
analysed up to that point were reanalysed by the primary laboratory. This is discussed in 
Stone, M and Ilieva, T, Technical Report of April 2010 page 140. This also explains the 
dates in Figures 11.1 and 11.2 as the data presented consists of the reanalysed samples 
and there was a gap between drilling and the analysis.  

In 2010, the average value of ST-H was determined to be slightly higher at ALS with a 
value of 0.430%. Originally three samples had warnings and one sample was shown having 
failed in the earlier report. In AMC's validation of the QA / QC data it was found that this 
failure was due to the value attributed to the standard being actually the value of the 
adjacent sample. However this error was not carried through to the database.  All the 
samples passed, with two warnings. 

Figure 11.3 Control Chart for 2010 High Grade Standard 

 

In 2010, based on the analysis of 56 samples at ALS, the average value of ST-L was 
reported as 0.229% Li. All of the ST-L determinations had assay values within +/-3SD and 
were therefore within acceptable limits, although there were four warnings, as shown in 
Figure 11.4.

AMC 711013: January 2012 52 

Figure 11.4 Control Chart for 2010 Low Grade Standard 

 

In 2011, a total of 43 high grade and 93 low grade standards were sampled. It must be 
noted that five of the standards were labelled just as 'S' (Standard) without defining whether 
they are high or low. These were assigned based on their returned values. Because of this 
an average of the 2010 ST-H samples is shown in Figure 11.5. 

Using the determined average ST-H value of 0.424% Li with a standard deviation of 
0.014% Li, four samples fell between the 2nd and 3rd standard deviation, and the group as 
a whole showed a small negative bias with a number of samples falling between -1 and -2 
standard deviations and none falling between the +1 and +2 standard deviations. See 
Figure 11.5. The average for the batch is 0.396% Li. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 53 

Figure 11.5 Control Chart for 2011 High Grade Standard 

 

The data returned for the ST-L standards contained some errors. There was one repeated 
sample and three samples which have no sample number associated with them in QL-
S11_39.  

Using the determined average ST-L value of 0.228% Li with a standard deviation of 0.007% 
Li, eight samples were well outside of the 3rd standard deviation. Review of the samples 
has suggested that three of them were probably actually ST-H standards and one was 
possibly a blank and therefore all of these have been removed from the group. QLC is 
currently looking into whether this is fact and amending the procedural breakdown. There 
remain four ST-L standards that have failed and seven others have warnings. Again the 
group as a whole showed a small negative bias with a number of samples falling between -
1 and -2 standard deviations and only one falling between the +1 and +2 standard 
deviations. The average for the group is 0.221% Li. See Figure 11.6. 

AMC strongly recommends that better sample control be implemented for any further 
drilling carried out.

11.3.2 Blanks 

Blank material is silica sand and it was routinely inserted, initially every 10th sample in 
sequence, but later in a more random fashion. Plots for the 2009 and 2010 data are shown 
below in Figures 11.7 and 11.8. 

In 2009 the correlation was excellent with only one blank failure (sample 360 from drillhole 
QL-S09-016), which is ascribed to contamination from a previous high grade sample. It is 
not clear if this was followed up. There were also seven minor failures which are equal to 
the maximum acceptable value of 0.003% Li and are not a cause for concern. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 55 

Figure 11.7 Control Chart for 2009 Blanks 

 

In 2010, three samples have values of 0.02% Li and could represent low grade 
contamination during preparation from the previous mineralized sample. In the CLQ 
analysis the upper tolerance limit was stated as 0.03% Li. However the detection limit 
stated for the ALS method is 0.005% Li thus the previous graph is incorrect. The redrawn 
graph is shown as Figure 11.5.  

  



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 56 

Figure 11.8 Control Chart for 2010 Blanks 

 

The majority of the samples cluster at the detection limit of 0.005% Li with three samples at 
0.02% Li above the maximum allowed. This is not deemed significant. 

In 2011, 132 blanks were analyzed. Of these three have had to be rejected totally as they 
returned values of 1.62% Li; 0.9 Li% and 0.224% Li. CLQ is currently looking into the cause 
of these very high values. 

The majority of the remaining samples were returned at below the detection limit of 0.005%, 
with just a few samples lying above. There were two samples above the upper tolerance 
level of 0.015 Li% but this is not deemed significant. Figure 11.9.

11.3.3 Inter Laboratory Check Assays 

In 2009, CLQ sent splits of approximately 10% of the drill core pulps to ALS for check 
analysis. The pulp duplicates included all of the high grade >2.25% Li2O samples and 
randomly selected samples from 0.5 to 2.25% Li2O. In addition, ten samples of standard 
ST-L, five samples of ST-H and one sample of the blank were sent to both ALS and SGS. 
The initial plots identified some mislabelling issues and another due to use of method ME-
MS61, which is close to the upper limit for this method. Figure 11.10 shows the plot of the 
corrected figures. There is a full discussion on this in Stone, M and Ilieva T, Technical 
Report of April 2010.

After the 2010 drilling program, 68 primary ALS pulp samples were sent from the CLQ core 
facility in Val-d'Or to AGAT's Laboratory in Mississauga, Ontario, by courier. The analyses 
show an excellent correlation with the original Li% values in Figure 11.11.

After the 2011 drilling program 350 primary ALS pulp samples were sent from the CLQ core 
facility in Val-d'Or to AGAT's Laboratory in Mississauga, Ontario, by courier. The analyses 
show a good correlation with the original Li% values in Figure 11.12, with less than one 
percent of the samples showing a significant variance between the two laboratories. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 59 

 Figure 11.12 Scatter Plot for 2011 Checks 

 

Despite the relatively small number of adverse check results discussed above, AMC is 
satisfied with the QA/QC program that was carried out and believes that the sample 
preparation, security and analytical procedures and results were reasonable. The re-
assaying in 2009 demonstrates a diligence and follow up to non-compliance, however from 
the reports it is not evident that follow-up has always been done. For example, blank 
sample 360 from drillhole QL-S09-016 has been highlighted but it is not clear to AMC that 
corrective action was taken. 

It is noted that certified standards have not been used as had been recommended in earlier 
reports. AMC agrees with this recommendation, as there is some drift in the mean of the 
standards year on year and it would be better to be comparing to the certified value. While 
some of the value of doing this has passed, it is still required for any drilling and grade 
control work.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Database 

Rectifications of the errors discovered in the verification checks that were carried out by 
AMC for the May estimate were all incorporated in the data for the new estimate. This work 
highlighted some transposition errors and a rebuild of the database was recommended. 
This was carried out by taking source data and importing it into a new database. While the 
intent was to build this in Access and import into Datamine, due to data coming late and 
ongoing discussions, the master database was kept in Datamine and on completion was 
exported to Access. 

The QA/QC work carried out for the 2011 drilling presented some challenges and there 
appears to have been some mis-handling of standards, such that where high standards 
were inserted in a batch, low standard values were returned, and vice-versa. This is shown 
in Section 11 and is an area to be tightened up in any further drilling programs. 

12.2 Stopes and Workings 

A thorough review of the location of the historical workings was carried out based on the 
observations and recommendation from the May report. On comparing the locations by 
loading the data into Datamine for visualization and into MapInfo for comparison to known 
plans, it was noticed in Datamine that the intervals between the Shaft collar and the two 
main levels did not correspond to the intervals reported. In fact the first level was showing 
as 88 ft (26.8m) below collar and not the 150 ft reported. This immediately explained why 
the stopes were registering too high in space previously and broke through the topography 
in some instances.  

As part of this exercise it was also recognized that the tonnages recorded as being 
extracted and the stope volumes were considerably different. Therefore the stopes were re-
modelled using all the survey data available; which generally was a sill, mid point and 
ultimate back. This ultimately has given a better fit to the interpreted dyke shapes and a 
truer representation of the crown pillar thicknesses. 

Due to multiple survey grids and subsequent grid transformations there was also a grid 
transformation and rotation issue. The location of the workings has been rectified on a best 
fit basis.  

It should be noted that the changes were generally locational and AMC believes that while 
this gives a better estimate   

It is recommended that, since the exact position of the stopes needs to be ascertained prior 
to development of the open pit, the four existing survey stations at the site be resurveyed 
using differential GPS in the grid which will be used for mine planning. This grid then needs 
to be accurately reconciled with the current collar locations and the historic mine survey 
information in order to better locate the open stopes. 

12.3 Other 

There is still an anomaly in the geology interpretation and grade data through holes S10-
009, 010 and 048. This is on the fringe of the deposit and may be due to faulting. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 61 

Resolution of this issue will require further effort through investigation, interpretation or 
drilling. As a consequence the intersection in S10-009 has not been used in domaining or 
estimation in AMC's resource model. 

AMC now believes that there is a significantly improved basis for resource estimation as the 
historical and new data has been cleaned and made more fit for purpose. The data is held 
in a master database which requires analytical data from the last seven holes. Once 
updated, the master database should be used as the basis of any further estimation work.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Introduction 

This section has been summarized from the FS documentation which was reviewed by Alan 
Riles of Riles Integrated Resource Management Ltd. In addition, the reader is referred to 
Lavery M.E and Stone M, Technical Report of November 2010. However this section has 
also been updated for more recent testwork. 

Many of the documents relating to production and concentration of spodumene ore were 
lost or destroyed after the mine was closed in the 1960s. However, historic records show 
that the crushing and grinding plant had sufficient capacity to handle approximately 900t of 
ore per day with production of approximately 169 tons of spodumene concentrate at an 
average grade of approximately 5.78% Li2O. The historic processing method is described in 
the SNC (1974) and Karpoff (1993) reports, and summarized in the report above. 

13.2 Summary of Sampling for Metallurgical Testwork 

Initially material for preliminary testwork was obtained in 2008. There was more material 
collected later as described under field programs in Section 10. Table 13.1 below 
summarizes the material collected for this purpose over time with some comments. 

Table 13.1 Metallurgical Samples Collected 

Date Sample type No Meters Comments 
June 2008 Drill holes 8 n/a 400 kg incl rock samples supplied to SGS 
July 2008 Rock - -  
November 2009 Outcrop - - 600 kg supplied to SGS 
Dec' 09 - January 2010 Drill holes 67 1,010 4,652 kg supplied to SGS 

In each case the samples were packed in rice bags that were sealed with tape and plastic 
cable ties, and delivered by a CLQ representative to SGS Lakefield.  

13.3 Summary of Metallurgical Testwork 

The metallurgical testwork program and process plant design is the subject of the Quebec 
Lithium Feasibility Study Report of December 2010 by BBA Engineering. The mine study 
having been reported separately, this Feasibility Study Report focused on the process plant 
design to treat 1.17% Li2O ore and produce approximately 20,000 tpa of >99.5% purity 
Li2CO3 suitable for battery application. 

The key outcomes of this report are summarized here. 

The testwork was carried out in two phases. Phase 1 was based on eight holes drilled 
specifically for metallurgical testing purposes and not surveyed nor logged. This material 
was supplemented by outcrop samples to a total weight of 400 kg and sent to SGS 
Lakefield. The head grade was 1.61% Li2O, significantly higher than the resource grade of 
1.17% Li2O. 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 63 

A program of dense medium separation, gravity concentration and flotation followed by 
bench scale decrepitation / roasting / water leach was carried out from which a conceptual 
flowsheet based on flotation and hydrometallurgical treatment of the spodumene 
concentrate to produce Li2CO3 was developed. 

Phase 2 was an extensive programme of bench scale and pilot plant testwork, also largely 
at SGS Lakefield, to validate and optimize the Phase 1 flowsheet, provide sufficient 
spodumene concentrate for the hydrometallurgical testing, and provide plant design data. 

The sample consisted of NQ core rejects from the previous phase, HQ core from 67 short 
holes drilled for metallurgical purposes and again supplemented by outcrop samples to 
make up 6,635 kg of the "mine representative sample". The assay was 1.22% Li2O, much 
closer this time to the resource grade. 

In addition, 11 variability samples were prepared from NQ holes to represent variability 
across the deposit and variability in grade. 

Comminution results showed the mineralization to be soft-medium with a BWI of 13.2 and 
showing little variability across the deposit or with grade. 

A comprehensive programme of flotation testwork was performed to investigate the merits 
of scrubbing and desliming and test sensitivity to grind size and collector choice, and which 
also included locked cycle tests. Despite the lithium losses associated with the desliming 
stage, this was deemed necessary as the overall grade-recovery performance was 
improved. The locked cycle tests achieved concentrate grades over 6% Li2O and 
recoveries of 82-85% and these parameters were also confirmed in the pilot plant tests. 

The various stages of the hydrometallurgical process ie decrepitation / sulphation, water 
leach, solution purification, including ion exchange polishing, were extensively tested in 
batch and pilot runs including some work carried out at the METSO pyrometallurgical facility 
and also vendor tests for the various solid / liquid separation steps. 

Battery grade 99.96% Li2CO3 lithium carbonate product was successfully produced, with 
the only product quality concerns being elevated aluminium and sulphur levels for which a 
bicarbonate polishing step was successfully tested but not included in this flowsheet 
pending further evaluation during the detailed engineering phase to follow. Similarly some 
final optimization work will also be completed in that detailed engineering phase. 

The overall lithium recovery for the flowsheet is 67.6%, with 80.5% lithium recovery in the 
mineral processing section and 84% in the hydrometallurgical section.  

A critical operational element will be the water balance, it being necessary to balance 
scarce raw water supplies with the impurity impacts of recycling tailings water. A fully 
integrated pilot programme of the full flowsheet would help address this issue. 

Photometric sorting testwork on the granite waste rocks (primarily black in colour) and 
spodumene mineralization (white) has been completed in Germany during 2011. The tests 
indicate that a significant amount of waste rock can be removed from the ore stream prior to 
entering the processing plant, thus reducing waste in the process stream and increasing 
lithium feed grade. The design phase for the photometric installation within the crushing

Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 64 

circuit is under way. Preliminary scheduling indicates installation could occur during 
commissioning of the lithium carbonate circuit in early 2013. 

13.4 Process Plant Description 

The mineral processing and hydrometallurgical flowsheets have been determined from the 
testwork and will be discussed in a future Technical Report to be prepared by another party. 
Only a summary is presented here. 

The front end mineral processing section consists of a conventional rod mill / ball mill circuit 
to minimize fines generation, followed by scrubbing and desliming then a flotation circuit 
with rougher and scavenger cells and two stages of concentrate cleaning to produce a 
spodumene concentrate.  

Dense media separation as a means of upgrading the ore prior to flotation was not included 
in the present flowsheet due to high lithium losses.  

The spodumene concentrate produced in the mineral processing section is treated in the 
hydrometallurgical section of the plant to produce a battery grade lithium carbonate product.  

The hydrometallurgical section consists of concentrate calcining in a rotary kiln, sulphation 
with acid, water leaching, two stages of pregnant leach solution purification, further solution 
cleaning by ion exchange and lithium carbonate precipitation. Sodium sulphate, which is 
generated in the lithium carbonate precipitation step, is removed from the circuit by 
distillation and crystallization as a by-product.  

AMC concludes from the FS report that sufficient metallurgical testwork and process design 
has been carried out on a representative sample of the resource to support a viable 
recovery process to a saleable product and with appropriate recoveries. 

Some final optimization work is still required during the detailed engineering phase to follow 
but no material changes to the flowsheet are anticipated.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Introduction 

The mineral resource has been estimated by Ms D Nussipakynova, P.Geo of AMC, who 
takes responsibility for the estimate, under the supervision of Mr J M Shannon, P.Geo of 
AMC. This model and estimate supersedes the June 2011 mineral resource estimate, 
prepared by Ms D Nussipakynova, P.Geo in Shannon J.M, and Nussipakynova D, 
Technical Report of June 2011. The model has been rebuilt and incorporates the results of 
the 2011 drilling in addition to CLQ's 2009 and 2010 drill programs, as well as a certain 
amount of historical data. All the modelling and the estimation was carried out in Datamine 
software and the completed model is named amc_nov_mod6. The earlier model built by 
AMC was called amc_0511_mod_A.dm and is referred to as the May model in the text. 

The summary results of the estimate at a cut off of 0.8% Li20 are shown in Table 14.1 
below.

14.2 Data Used 

14.2.1 Drillhole Database 

The database was rebuilt by AMC from first principles, using the laboratory assay and 
surveyor's certificates, with the litho data coming from the drill logs. The data verified now 
resides in an Access database. This included all data that had been captured including all 
historic holes for which there were incomplete records. The total number of holes drilled 
over time and those with data used in the interpretation and estimation are shown in Table 
14.2.

14.2.2 Pseudo-Holes  

Within the stoped-out area where the raw data is missing, pseudo-holes were created to 
honour the data originally captured in that area. Two pseudo-holes intersecting each stope 
were created and use the stope grade as listed in Table 17-4 in Lavery, ME and Stone, M, 
Technical Report of November 2010. The location of these holes was created in Datamine 
by making a trace and converting this to a drillhole. The intersections were registered to the 
top and bottom of the stope surfaces. A list of the pseudo-holes and the assigned grades 
are shown in Table 14.3.

The pseudo-holes and their relationship to the stopes are shown in Figure 14.1. Note 
that the holes are in red and the stopes in blue, with development in grey.

Figure 14.1 Relationship of Pseudo Holes to Mined Area 

 

It has proved extremely difficult for CLQ to drill holes within the mined area, despite 
considerable effort. This is due to hitting openings and having to abandon holes. In the 
2011 program planning this was looked at carefully and proved not possible to achieve. 
Therefore AMC considers the use of the pseudo-holes holes as being a fair way to 
represent the old lost data. 

14.2.3 Bulk Density 

The collection of bulk density measurements is described in Section 11. The bulk density 
values used for the main rock types are shown in Table 14.4.

14.3 Domain Modelling 

14.3.1 Geology Model 

The geology model is composed of the three main rock types plus overburden as shown in 
Table 14.5 below. The pegmatite dykes are individually modelled and are given a zone 
name. Those dykes which form the mineralized domains are discussed further in Section 
14.3.3. 

Table 14.5 Rock Codes Used  

Rock Type Rock Code 

Granodiorite 100 
Pegmatite Dyke By zone name # 1 – 67 excl 46, 64, and 65. 
Mafic Volcanic 200 

Overburden 300 

Other rock types such as amphibolite and schist are included within the mafic boundary. 
Some logging issues and lack of continuity negated breaking out these individual units. 

The pegmatite units are very distinct. 

A separate wireframe was created for overburden which includes intervals coded as 
"casing".  

14.3.2 Mineralized Domains 

The mineralized domains are actually the dykes as constructed in the geology model and 
calibrated by grade such that barren dykes were not included. The domaining strategy 
followed the May 2011 model with each dyke in the AMC model modelled as an individual 
domain. Thus all significant dykes are modelled and estimation was carried out within these 
domains as for the earlier AMC model. The new interpretation of the mineralized dykes 
created a model of 64 separate dykes in total. Repositioning of the old underground 
workings resulted in the recognition of three orientations for the dykes / domains. Of the 64 
domains, 53 dykes belong to the main trend, eight dykes to the oblique 1 orientation and 
three dykes to the oblique 2 orientation. Each dyke has an individual zone number. The 
three orientations and the total dyke swarm as modelled is shown in Figure 14.2 below. The 
main change from the May model is the updated location and configuration of the stopes 
and the inclusion of additional drilling.

Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 70 

Figure 14.2 Mineralised Domains 

 

14.3.3 Stopes 

The stopes have been re modelled and differ in shape and location from those used in the 
May model. In addition there were two stopes which were not previously included, so the 
total now consists of 21 voids. These voids are open except for broken material remaining 
within them, which was estimated by Karpoff in 1993 as approximately 274,000 tonnes. 
However when the evaluation was completed in 2011, the total remaining which was 
accounted for in the estimate was 240,000 tonnes. Elsewhere in the documentation it is 
said that there is 227,000 tonnes remaining in the stopes. AMC considers that the 
differences are not material and that a reasonable effort has been made to represent the 
stope situation as it now stands. 

The stope tonnages extracted and the remaining tonnages are itemized in Table 14.6 
below. This total tonnage was calculated from the modelled void and the mined percentage 
for each stope from Karpoffs's table applied to get a remaining tonnes. This information was 
applied to the block model. This then gives a fair reflection of the stope voids, some of 
which are partially filled with broken muck.

14.4.1 Statistics 

The drill data was examined statistically as shown in Table 14.7. This summarizes the data 
selected within the pegmatite dykes for both raw data and for the composites for the three 
domain orientations. The composite data is what is used in the estimate.

Composite grades are slightly lower than the raw data, but close in all cases except for an 
oblique dyke. Composites were flagged to the domains in which they resided for the 
interpolation. This flagging involved some decisions being made manually to ensure the 
data best respected the domains. In Figure 14.3 a frequency plot is shown for the selected 
data.

14.4.2 Compositing 

Based on a review of the sampled intervals as shown in Figure 14.4, a composite length of 
one meter was chosen. Some of the outliers are from the historic LV surface holes and may 
have been calculated at set intervals and hence skew the data.

14.4.3 Grade Capping 

No grade capping was carried out after a review of the data. There are no unusually high 
grades, with the maximum value being 3.06% Li2O. 

14.5 Block Model  

14.5.1 Block Model Parameters 

Parent blocks of 5 m by 5 m by 5 m (vertical) were used in the block model, with sub 
blocking employed by setting the X and Y minimum block dimension at 1 m, and the Z 
minimum dimension at 0.25 m. In the case of stopes and underground development a finer 
split was employed. The block model dimensions are shown in Table 14.8 and model fields 
used in reporting from the block model in Table 17.9. The model is un-rotated, and is in the 
UTM system.

14.5.2 Variography and Grade Estimation 

No variography was carried out on the data for this exercise but one of the pegmatite dykes 
(Zone 22), was used as an example to confirm the selected search distance for the May 
model. This is shown and discussed in the June Technical Report.  

The estimation method used was Inverse Distance Squared (ID2) and was carried out using 
a 20m x 70m x 70m search. The angles of rotation for the search ellipsoids was different for 
the Main and Oblique dykes, and are shown in Table 14.10. Note in Datamine negative 
rotation is counter-clockwise.

A number of passes were employed and used different searches as follows; pass 1: 1 x 
search, pass 2: 2 x search, pass 3: 5 x search. The third pass was to fill the dyke 
wireframes to depth. It must be noted that the resource at depth and along strike has been 
trimmed by a pit shell.  

The minimum and maximum number of samples used for all passes were minimum 
samples four and maximum 20.  

The next two figures show slices through the block model in plan, in Figure 14.6 and in 
section in Figure 14.7. Note that the two outlines in Figure 14.6 are the Indicated Resource 
shell and the resource pit shell.

14.5.3 Resource Classification 

A rigorous classification exercise was undertaken for the AMC0511 model and the 
philosophy employed was the same for the classification of this model. A single wireframe 
was used to enclose each class so a certain amount of smoothing was employed. 

For the Measured Resource two criteria were used. The blocks informed by more than 15 
samples within the first pass were plotted to use as a guide. Then viewing this in the 
context of the underground workings, an envelope some 25m from the workings was drawn 
to constrain the Measured Resource. Because the workings have now been moved to what 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 78 

is believed to be their real location, this slightly changed the amount of Measured 
Resource. 

For the Indicated Resource, again a number of tests were applied in a similar manner to the 
May model, and the previous shells adjusted to respect the new additional data. 

The Inferred Resource was within the wireframes created filled by up to three passes but 
then trimmed by an optimized pit which was run on the Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
Resources using the Feasibility Study cost parameters but increasing the commodity price 
by 20%.  

The shapes constraining the Measured and Indicated Resources are shown in plan in 
Figure 14.7 along with the resource pit shell.

14.5.4 Block Model Validation 

Visual checks were carried out to ensure that the grades respected the raw data and also 
lay within the constraining wireframes. 

In addition to the ID2 estimate a Nearest Neighbour (NN) run was made in Datamine. A 
comparison of the outputs is shown in Table 14.11.

14.6 Mineral Resource Estimate 

The results are shown in the tables below. Table 14.12 shows a summary of the mineral 
resource at a cut off of 0.8% Li20 and within a pit shell constructed as explained above. This 
cut off is used for a direct comparison to the resource estimates previously released by 
CLQ and is the published figure. However based on work undertaken previously on mineral 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 81 

reserves which were estimated at a 0.6% Li20 cut-off, it is recommended that future mineral 
resources be stated at a 0.6% Li20 cut-off grade.

The AMC estimates in May and December use a pit shell as a constraint in order to ensure 
that the resource met the "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" test. In each case 
the pit shell was developed using mining costs supplied by CLQ and as used in the 
Feasibility Study (also checked at a high level by AMC), and a price of US$ 7,100 / tonne 
LiCO3.

are: 



CANADA LITHIUM CORPORATION 
Quebec Lithium Property 

AMC 711013: January 2012 83 

• Additional drilling, which converted some Inferred Resources to Indicated 
Resources (reduced Inferred, increased Indicated, and not all Indicated converted) 

• Reinterpretation of some dykes and mineralized domains based on new drilling 
results, new information on the location of underground workings and a review of 
previous interpretations (increased Measured, reduced overall tonnage)

to validate or update this information 

23.2 Jourdan Resources Inc 

Jourdan Resources Inc. (Jourdan) acquired three properties, the Vallée, Lacorne and 
Baillarge Lithium Properties collectively called the Barraute Lithium Project. These are in 
proximity to the CLQ Property, as announced in a news release in January 2011. From a 
later news release dated 28 April, 2011, Jourdan announced the start of a 3,000 metres 
diamond drilling program on the Vallée Property, which sits contiguous to the east and 
south of the CLQ Project. The aim of the program is stated to be to identify the same lithium 
bearing pegmatites along the 1.8 km strike of the property as those found on the adjacent 
and contiguous CLQ Project in order to potentially define mineral resources in the near 
term. 

23.3 TSR Resources Inc 

TSR Resources Inc. is a private Quebec company that holds 104 claims in Fiedmont and 
La Corne Townships. Its claims are located approximately 3 km to the southeast of the 
Property. A ground geophysical survey was completed in April 2010 by TSR according to 
the MNRF website.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Property was a producer over a ten-year period in the 1950's and 1960's and has been 
explored in phases over the past 17 years by a number of companies. The project is at an 
advanced stage with a feasibility study having been completed in early 2011. Detailed 
engineering design work for the mine and process plant is proceeding on schedule, and is 
about 80% completed. Initial site preparation has been completed with the pouring of 
concrete footings and foundations. Additional long-lead-time items have been ordered and 
the current delivery and construction schedule indicates plant commissioning as planned in 
late 2012. 

CLQ's exploration programs have been conducted to generally good industry standards 
and the resulting data is appropriate as the basis for mineral resource estimation. Some 
historic exploration data, including information relating to old underground workings, was 
used for resource estimation purposes after validation, which included twinning of some 
drillholes.  

The geological interpretation of the deposit is robust and, from the current knowledge, is 
reasonably predictable. The dykes in the east are narrow and diverge due to two 
orientations, demonstrating that the operation is situated where the dykes are most fertile. 

AMC's review of the 2010 resource estimate indicated that there was room for 
improvement, particularly with respect to geological domaining and the treatment of 
unsampled dyke material. This was rectified in the AMC estimate of May 2011, which 
employed a more rigorous interpretation of pegmatite dykes and restriction of its 
mineralized domains to those dykes  

AMC's December 2011 resource estimate is based on a further 65 holes and has given 
more confidence, moving some Inferred material into the Indicated category, through more 
dense drilling. In both AMC estimates the stated mineral resource is constrained within a pit 
shell.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Data  

All known errors have been removed from the database. There are however some minor 
outstanding issues which should be changed, and a dated master database held in a 
secure environment. No copies of the master database should be made, other than well-
labelled copies for specific purposes. There appears to be an issue with some 2009 collars 
locations and these should be resurveyed or resolved. There are also analytical results yet 
to be entered for seven holes from the 2011 drilling program. 

There are also some QA/QC items which should be resolved before wrapping up the 
database. There appear to have been mix ups of submitted standards and blanks with high 
values which do not appear to have been followed up. AMC strongly recommend better 
sample control be implemented for any further drilling carried out. The estimated cost to 
rectify data issues is $15,000. 

Non certified standards have been used in the QA/QC process. AMC recommends that 
certified standards be procured for ongoing QA/QC work. 

A number of survey grids have been employed on the property over time. Some 
manipulation was required to best fit the location of the underground workings, for example. 
It is recommended that grid issue be resolved, and survey monuments be resurveyed. Any 
resurveying costs are estimated at $10,000 

Bulk density measurements should be collected for drill core from 2010 and 2011 drilling, 
as there is not good spatial coverage of the deposit. Estimated cost $4,000 

Additional Drilling 

No further delineation drilling is recommended at this time. There will be some grade control 
drilling required on an ongoing basis. This could by the reverse circulation method with 
some initial calibration with existing or new diamond drillholes. This program could be part 
of preparation of the deposit for mining and should include probe drilling for the stope voids. 

This would be considered an operating activity cost, will be ongoing and is not costed here.
