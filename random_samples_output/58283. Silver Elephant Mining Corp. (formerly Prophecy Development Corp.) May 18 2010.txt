The Lynn Lake Property (the Property) is located in the historic mining town of Lynn 
Lake, in northern Manitoba, about 320 kilometres (km) by road access, northwest of 
the Thompson mining camp. Prophecy Resources (Prophecy) has entered into an 
option agreement with Victory Nickel Inc. (Victory Nickel) on October 21, 2009, 
whereby Prophecy has the right to acquire a 100% interest in the Lynn Lake Nickel 
Project.  The property was operated by Sherritt Gordon Mines Limited (Sherritt) from 
1953 to 1976 for a total of 24 years with production of 22.2 million tons at an average 
grade of 1.023% nickel (Ni) and 0.535% copper (Cu).  The production includes 
material from the EL Plug that is situated 3.8 km southeast of the A Plug shaft, with a 
contribution of up to 1.0 million tons grading 3.25% Ni and 1.09% Cu.  The mine 
closed in 1976 with a historic in-situ nickel and copper resource remaining. 

The Property contains eleven zones; A, B, C, D (upper and lower), E-J, F-K, G, M-N, 
0, P, and Disco and several areas of lower grade mineralization.  The upper and 
lower N and O, and the G zone are the subject of this report.  They were sub-
economic at the time of mine closure and remain either undeveloped or partially 
mined. 

1 . 1  G E O L O G Y  

Prophecy Resources Corp (Prophecy) retained Wardrop Engineering Inc. (Wardrop) 
to complete a resource estimate on the upper and lower N and O, and G zones.  The 
estimate conforms to the CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions 
referred to in National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), Standards of Disclosure of 
Mineral projects. 

The Lynn Lake A Plug property occurs in the deformed Precambrian metavolcanic 
and metasedimentary rocks, which belong to the Wasekwan Group.  This is overlain 
by a metasedimentary succession, which is known as the Sickle Group. Nickel-
copper-cobalt mineralization occurs only within the basic igneous plutons in the Lynn 
Lake Greenstone Belt, which extends westward from Southern Indian Lake in the 
east, to Laurie Lake on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border.  The A Plug nickel and 
copper deposits occur in one of these intrusions. 

The A Plug is a complex intrusion where mineralization typically occurs within 
structurally controlled vertical pipes of remobilized peridotite and amphibolite that is 
largely discordant.  The mineralization is magmatic in origin and was initially 
segregated and concentrated in a magma chamber prior to the vertical injections into 
pipes or lenticular shoots.  The mineralized pipes are generally associated with 
extensive faulting and fracturing.  Faulting ranges from imperceptible to right-hand 
off-set of 60 to 100 metres (m) where the west side is thrusted upward to the north. 



 
 

 Prophecy Resources Corp. 2 1055400100-REP-L0001-05 
Lynn Lake Nickel Project  May 2010 
 

Fracturing is related to one or more of the west dipping thrust faults and imbricate 
shearing, and is more evident where the faults pass through the contact area 
between amphibolite and a more competent member of the intrusion. 

The mined zones occur in the western half of the A Plug associated with more mafic 
to ultramafic rocks of gabbro, amphibolite and peridotite that are centred in three 
main areas of the intrusion: Situated around the A Shaft area, immediately west of 
the Farley Shaft in the middle of the Plug and towards the southern contact of the 
Plug.  The mineralization is quite diverse from each individual zone with lenses of 
tabular nature to crudely sub-circular in extent.  Mineralization consists mainly of 
pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and minor amounts of pyrite occurring as 
disseminated, stringer, semi-massive to massive sulphides and areas of cemented 
breccia sulphides types. 

The drill hole database for the Property contains 3,709 historic diamond drill holes 
with an aggregate length of 1,309,345 feet (ft). The historic holes were drilled from 
the early years of exploration to later years of mining delineation drilling. The drill 
holes were selected and entered within areas of interest and from an exploration 
viewpoint from a total of more than 7,800 drilled on the Property. 

Independent Nickel has completed an additional 28,000 plus metres of exploration 
drilling.  This has included exploration targets Golf, Hotel, N, O and Echo zones. 

Prophecy has not conducted any exploration work on the property at the time this 
report was authored. 

1 . 2  R E S O U R C E  S T A T E M E N T  

At a nickel equivalent cut-off grade of 0.4% NiEQ, using a US$7.22 per pound (lb) Ni 
and US$2.00/lb Cu, the N and O zones contain a Measured and Indicated Resource 
of about 22.9 million tons with an average grade of 0.57% Ni and 0.30% Cu.  The 
Inferred Resource totals 8.1 million tons with an average grade of 0.51% Ni and 
0.28% Cu in the N, O and G zones. 

1 . 3  R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S  

Wardrop recommends that Prophecy proceed with a two phased exploration 
program. 

Phase 1 would consist of diamond drilling the recently discovered near-surface Disco 
Zone and the portions of the N Zone inferred resource.  Furthermore, the Phase 1 
program include an Induced Polarization survey and a metallurgical study.  The 
estimated cost to complete phase 1 is $865,000. 

Phase 2 of the exploration program involves diamond drilling to expand the resource 
on the N and O zones as well as drill testing any Induced Polarization targets that

may be generated during the Phase 1 program.  The estimated cost to complete 
Phase 2 is $1.05 million.

The Lynn Lake A Plug Property is located in the historic mining town of Lynn Lake, in 
northern Manitoba about 320 km by road access northwest of the city of Thompson.  
The Property was operated by Sherritt from 1953 to 1976 for a total of 24 years with 
production of 22.2 million tons at an average grade of 1.023% Ni and 0.535% Cu.  
The production includes material from the EL Plug that is situated 3.8 km southeast 
of the A Plug shaft.  The mine closed in 1976 with a substantial nickel and copper 
resource in-situ.  The Property contains eleven zones of mineralization; A, B, C, D 
(Upper and Lower), E-J, F-K, G, M-N, 0, P and several areas of lower grade 
mineralization including the recently discovered Disco zone.  The Upper and Lower N 
and O, and G zones are the subject of this report.  They were sub-economic at the 
time of mine closure and remain either partially mined or undeveloped. 

2 . 2  T E R M S  O F  R E F E R E N C E  

Prophecy retained Wardrop to provide a resource restatement on the historical A 
Plug nickel and copper deposit occurring in the Lynn Lake Greenstone Belt.  This 
belt extends from South Indian Lake in the east, westward to Laurie Lake on the 
Manitoba-Saskatchewan border. 

Preliminary work in October 2005 entailed the capture of historic data into a digital 
format to enable the calculation of a resource estimate that conforms to the CIM 
Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in NI 43-101, 
Standards of Disclosure of Mineral projects. 

Information and data for the resource estimate were obtained from historic data 
being stored in the old mine site administration building at Lynn Lake and additional 
data in the possession of Lynn Lake Nickel.  The data comprised drill hole logs, 
working geological sections and level plans in paper format.  Two rolls of 35 
millimetre (mm) microfiche film containing 1,105 drawings were also available. The 
film records were prepared in 1978 by Sherritt as part of the mine closure plan with 
the Manitoba government. 

New diamond drill information was provided in the form of a Microsoft Access 
database.  No new work conducted on the property has material impact on the 
resource estimate. 

Todd McCracken, P. Geo. has carried out the resource restatement calculations and 
a review of all the geological work associated with this report.

The property was a historic mining area and the site is readily accessible from the 
Town of Lynn Lake.  Lynn Lake is approximately 320 km from Thompson, Manitoba 
along Provincial Highway 391.  Lynn Lake has a population of 714 (Statistics 
Canada, 2006).  There is an airport at Lynn Lake, which is serviced by Calm Air and 
Perimeter Air.  Perimeter Air maintains a regular air schedule into Lynn Lake from 
Winnipeg with stops in regional communities.  A railway line is located at Lynn Lake, 
which extends south to Flin Flon, Manitoba and from there to the rest of Canada. 

Lynn Lake has an annual average temperature of -3 degrees Celsius (°C).  The 
average summer temperature is +22°C with an average winter temperature of -20°C.  
Annual precipitation averages approximately 530 millimetres (Community Profile, 
Manitoba). 

The climate and vegetation in the Lynn Lake area is typical of northern Manitoba.  
Most of the area is covered by northern boreal forest, consisting chiefly of jack pine, 
black spruce and balsam with a few stands of birch and poplar.  The Property 
consists of patches of northern boreal forest around the former mine infrastructure 
buildings,  mine tailings, waste rock piles, former Farley headframe, core storage 
areas and five ponds and associated dikes to the north and northwest of Farley shaft 
(Figure 5.1).  The majority of the property has been levelled by waste rock, tailings 
and gravel sand mixture material.  The relief is low lying consisting of scattered 
marsh or moss-covered swampy areas. 

The previous long existing mining at Lynn Lake and in northern Manitoba confirms 
the area has adequate resources for a mining operation.

Property(1) 

Year  

1941 Austin McVeigh located the discovery outcrop. 
1945-
1946 

Sherritt Gordon (Sherritt) staked 353 claims and conducted exploration 
(magnetometer surveys and drilling) to outline a 6.8 million ton historic resource 
averaging 1.74% nickel and 0.75% copper in the A, B, E and EL zones(1)  In the 
absence of further clarification from historic documents, these would have to be 
considered as equivalent to "inferred" resources under CIM terminology 

1948-
1950 

Sherritt began sinking the A shaft. This, along with geophysical exploration and drilling 
increased the resource to 14 million tons averaging 1.22% nickel and 0.62% copper (1) 

1953-
1976 

Sherritt operated the Lynn Lake Nickel Mine from 1953-1976. During this time they 
discovered/developed additional zones and commissioned the Farley Shaft in 1961. 
The mine produced over 22 million tons of ore at a grade of 1.023% Ni and 0.535% 
copper (1) 

1977 -
1987 

Sherrgold Inc., a subsidiary of Sherrit Gordon, acquired ownership of the Property. 

1988-
1989 

LynnGold Resources Inc., owned by Hayes Resources Inc., conducted an 
assessment of Sherritt's stated a historic reserve of 19.3 million tons grading 0.61% 
nickel and 0.32% copper (Goodwin, 1988)(1)   These would probably be equivalent to 
"proven and probable" reserves under CIM terminology 

1989-
1992 

DCC Equities Hayes Resources Inc. acquired ownership of the Property following the 
bankruptcy of LynnGold Resources. 

1993-
2005 

Black Hawk Mining Inc. used the Property mill from 1993-2000 to process ore from the 
Farley Lake open pit gold mine, approximately 36 km east of Lynn Lake. The gold 
tailings were pumped into the B pit and then into open stopes of the abandoned 
underground workings on the property and the Farley shaft. 

2005-
2008 

Independent Nickel conducted the following exploration activities: re-established the 
historic mine grid at 1000 foot intervals, linecutting of 41.75 total line kilometres, an 
electromagnetic (EM) ground survey, a ground magnetometer survey, borehole EM 
surveys, an induced polarization (IP) survey, drilled 87 boreholes totalling >28 000 m.  
 
Independent Nickel filed a Preliminary Economic Assessment and filed a Pre-
Feasibility Study.  Both studies are available on SEDAR. 

2009 Victory Nickel Inc. acquired Independent Nickel Inc. 
2009-
present 

Prophecy Resources Inc. entered into an agreement with Victory Nickel Inc. to acquire 
the Lynn Lake Nickel Property.

Wardrop compiled historic data (pre-1976) from the Lynn Lake nickel mine into a 
digital format as part of a Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2006. A 
total of 3,709 drill holes out of a complete list of greater than 7,800 had their collar 
positions, surveys, assays, lithologies and other pertinent information manually 
entered into an Access database. In addition, a total of 395 drawings of sections and 
plans have been scanned from historic data from the Manitoba Mines Branch and 
data received from Lynn Lake Nickel. Subsequently these scans were digitized in-
house at Wardrop's Toronto office. This data has been used to create 3D geological 
solids using Datamine software. 

The historic data from the N, O, G, P, and Upper D zones appears to be accurate 
and complete to the mine closure in 1976. The remaining zones and zones of A, 
Upper and Lower B, Lower D, E, F, J, K, B-K and M lacked information in more than 
one of the key areas of drill hole information, mined out areas being identified or 
geological interpretation. The Lower D zone, however appeared to be only lacking in 
the area of mined out information and a decision was made not to include any 
historic in-situ resource from this area at this time. 

Comparison of the new model to the historic sectional and plan interpretations 
indicates a good correlation with historic figures.

The property historically was drilled systematically from the main underground levels 
of 800, 950 (12th level of A mine), 14th Diesel Haulage, 2,000 and 3,000 foot levels 
with horizontal drill holes spaced laterally every 400 feet out to or near the contact 
between the intrusive plug and the metavolcanics or metasediments. Unless large 
amounts of consistent mineralization were intersected in these horizontal drill holes 
no additional drilling by Sherritt was conducted. When considerable lengths of 
mineralization and grade were intersected, generally drilling was conducted 
systematically on 50 foot and then 25 foot intervals and designated an alpha zone or 
zone identification. 

Historic information indicates that the majority of drilling was carried out from 
underground using either EXT or BM diameter core drilling equipment.

ranged from less than 100 metres to 1,600 metres in core length.  Due to the genetic 
uncertainty and massive character of the A-plug gabbro, true-thicknesses and 
orientation of mineralized intercepts is not known. Wedged holes were recognized by 
an alphabetic designation after the original departure hole.

1945 initial mine production in 1953 and throughout the mine life to 1976 are not 
currently available to Wardrop.  

Wardrop commented on 23 drill hole core reviewed during a pervious site visit from 
July 26 to 28, 2005 on the property. The core review objective was to confirm the 
historical logging and identify any discrepancies from the logging to a visual review.

Wardrop had not completed a detailed reviewed the data from the 2006 to 2008 
diamond drill programs completed by Independent Nickel.  Independent Nickel 
geologists used the sampling procedures outlined below. 

Sampling was conducted on logged core in geologically pertinent intervals. These 
predominantly included intervals containing sulphide mineralization of appreciable 
semi-quantitative content, typically 5% or greater, plus unmineralized or sparsely 
mineralized "shoulders."  The geologist exercises discretion in all sampling and 
shoulder sizes.  Sample length was never less than 10 centimetres and did not 
exceed 2 metres.  Sample parsing was based on rock type, mineral occurrence, 
alteration and uniformity of sulphide content.

The Lynn Lake Greenstone Belt of northern Manitoba, hosting the nickel and copper 
deposits, is part of the deformed Precambrian metasedimentary and metavolcanic 
rocks belonging to the Wasekwan Group (Bateman, 1945), as shown in Figure 7.1. 

The Wasekwan Group is divided into two east-trending belts, referred to as the 
northern and southern Lynn Lake belts (Park et al, 2002).  The northern portion of 
the belt is overlain by Ralph Lake conglomerate and Zed Lake greywacke and the 
southern portion is overlain by a metasedimentary succession, known as the Sickle 
Group.  The belt is bounded to the south by the Kisseynew metasedimentary domain 
and to the north by the Southern Indian Domain and stretches from the Manitoba-
Saskatchewan border in the west to Southern Indian Lake in the east. 

The Lynn Lake nickel and copper deposits, mined from 1953 to 1976, occur within 
two adjacent mafic to ultramafic intrusive igneous plutons of the Lynn Lake 
Greenstone Belt known as the Wasekwan Group that is overlain by the Sickle Group. 

The following sections on geological setting have been extracted from "Nickel-
Copper Mineralization in the Lynn Lake Gabbro" (Pinsent, 1980). 

The relationship between the Sickle and the Wasekwan group, from a structural and 
stratigraphic viewpoint, show little discordance between the northern and southern 
portion of the belt.  Sickle Group metaconglomerates unconformably overlie the 
Wasekwan Group metavolcanic and post-date the Wasekwan tonalite intrusion within 
the belt. 

Three sub-circular intermediate to acid igneous plutonic complexes divide the 
Greenstone Belt into northern and southern belts along an east to west access.  The 
igneous plugs of gabbroic composition have intruded these Wasekwan Group 
metavolcanic north and south of this axis.

The Wasekwan Group at Lynn Lake consists of a homoclinal sequence of 
metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  A thicker body of felsic volcanic rocks 
then underlies a mafic to felsic succession of interlayered metavolcanic flows of tuffs 
and breccias.  This is further overlain by a fine to coarse-grained metasediments and 
a mafic to intermediate metavolcanic flows and breccias that locally show iron 
formation occurrences.  This diverse lowermost metavolcanic unit in the Town of 
Lynn Lake may represent proximity to a volcanic centre.  Stratigraphy of Lynn Lake is 
steeply dipping or vertical to the northwest with a strike of 065° azimuth.  
Metamorphism of staurolite subfacies of the lower amphibolite facies is the regional 
metamorphism of the stratigraphy.

The Lynn Lake A plug mafic to ultramafic igneous pluton of nickel and copper 
mineralization as been identified in the following alpha nomenclature by Sherritt as A, 
B, C, D, E-J, F-K, G, M-N, O and P zones.  The near vertical pluton with a size of 
three kilometres by 1.5 kilometres intruded the Wasekwan metasediments and 
metavolcanics near parallel to the structural trend of the Greenstone rocks at a 
northeast to southwest strike.  The contact of the pluton and Greenstone Belt 
intersects a thick unit of brecciated to massive rhyolite flows on the northwest contact 
and a unit of interlayered tuff flows of intermediate to mafic composition on the 
southeast contact.  The igneous pluton and volcanic contact is sheared and has 
been cut-off by the Lynn Lake fault or Griffith shear on the southern end of the plug 
with a trend of 315° and a dip of 50° to the northeast. 

Currently, the discovery outcrop adjacent to and southeast of the A shaft is the only 
area that has not been covered by waste rock from open pit mining or by mill tailings. 

The known zones occur in the western half of the A plug associated with more mafic 
to ultramafic rock types of gabbro, amphibolite and peridotite in three main centres 
within the pluton (MaCauley, 1962) as follows (see also Figure 7.2): 

• A, C, Upper D, Lower D, E and J zones at the north end of the plug situated 
around the A shaft area. 

• B, F, K and B-K zones that lie west of the Farley shaft in the middle of the A 
plug, O, N and P zones at the south end of the A plug. 

An assemblage of intermixed amphibolite, gabbro containing peridotite bodies, 
mottled quartz-biotite diorite, quartz hornblende diorite and mineralized rock types 
define the A plug geology. 

7.2.1 STRUCTURE 

The Lynn Lake fault or Griffith shear defines the southern contact of the A plug and 
the O fault disrupts and offsets the O and N zones.  These two major reverse faults 
strike northwest and dip moderately to the northeast.  The reverse movement on the 
O fault has caused sections of the O and N zones to be thrusted southwest over the 



 
 

 Prophecy Resources Corp. 21 1055400100-REP-L0001-05 
Lynn Lake Nickel Project  May 2010 
 

Wasekwan Group country rock below the 3,500 foot level.  The Lynn Lake fault with 
a similar sense of movement has moved the weakly mineralized portions of the O 
and N to the southwest over the Wasekwan.  The mineralized portions of the N and 
O zone lie between the two faults from the 1,600 and 3,500 foot levels.  If the known 
weakly mineralized M zone, which lies at surface, is the thrusted hangingwall 
equivalent of the N zone the offset of the faulting is on the order of 500 to 600 
metres.  The O zone pipe thrusted hanging wall extension has not been located or 
the footwall truncated portion of the Lower O zone. 

The Lynn Lake fault has not shown evidence of intersecting or truncating the B, K, or 
B-K zones and may possibly steepen at depth.  The A zone has been truncated to 
the west due to movement on the footwall A fault at the 15th and 18th levels of the A 
Mine, which strikes north and dips to the east.  The C zone has been displaced in 
similar fashion to the A zone due to the C fault on the 14th level and may also have 
offset the E and J zones.  Movement on the C zone has similar displacement as the 
A fault. 

All the zones appear to be affected somewhat by faulting, causing successively 
higher sections of the A, C, E and J zones to be thrusted to the east.  In general, the 
few in number easterly dipping reverse faults exhibit appreciable movement, while 
the westerly dipping imbricate reverse faults are more abundant with little disruption 
and deformation of the zones.  The faulting probably continued throughout the plug 
evolution, while the easterly dipping faults appear to predate the westerly dipping 
faults, with the age of faulting being uncertain.  Mafic dykes, which are associated 
with the fault planes, have been metamorphosed while deformation pre-dates the 
final phase of metamorphism.

The nickel and copper deposit of Lynn Lake A Plug are concentrations of sulphides 
occurring within the mafic to ultramafic intrusive igneous rocks.  The plug itself is 
kidney-shaped with an approximate size of three kilometres in the north-south 
direction and 1.5 kilometres in the east-west, comprised of an intermediate to 
ultramafic igneous pluton that has been intruded into Wasekwan Group metavolcanic 
strata.  Classification of the magmatic origin is of the tholeiitic affinity (Eckstrand et al, 
1995). 

The A Plug is a complex intrusion where mineralization typically occurs within 
structurally controlled vertical to sub-vertical pipe intrusions of remobilized peridotite 
and amphibolite, displaying all three of the usual types of mineralization, massive 
sulphide, disseminated sulphides, cemented breccia sulphides and stockworks of 
sulphide stringers. 

The bulk of the mineralization of the A Plug occurs in discrete pipes, 
characteristically containing disseminated sulphide-bearing anhydrous norite (or 
amphibolite derived from norite) and plutonic breccia mineralization found at the pipe 
interface with host-rock "gabbro".  The pipes are extensive, although the 
mineralization may be localized.  The sulphides are locally segregated into a discrete 
silicate-contaminated mineralizing fluid, either within the source magma chamber or 
in transit to the A Plug forming "high-grade" sulphide pipes and lenses within 
mineralized pipes or within host-rock. 

Although occurring in the presence of ultramafic to mafic intrusive rocks, 
mineralization is also associated with areas of faulting or intense fracturing.  
Mineralization occurs in areas of intensely fractured or brecciated mafic intrusive rock 
and target minerals are found in all types of material within the fracture zone, 
including late acid dykes.  This fracturing is related to one or more relatively minor 
west-dipping thrust faults and resulting complementary shears and faults.  Movement 
on the faults ranges from almost imperceptible to a right-hand offset of two or three 
hundred feet where the west side was thrust upward and to the north.  Fracturing is 
most intensive where the fault or faults pass through the contact area between 
amphibolite and a more competent member of the intrusive group, such as the 
Quartz Hornblende Diorite (QHD) or diorite. 

Minor acid dykes are commonly present within the fault zones or follow well-defined 
related fissures.  When in the fault zones, the dykes are usually in a highly fractured 
condition.  Target minerals post-date the acid dykes and replace them.  Sulphides 
within the fault zones are commonly display slickensides, indicating subsequent 
movement.  The relative absence of late fracturing within the zones suggests that 
post mineralisation movement was not material.

The property contains ten zones of mineralization; A, B, C, D (Upper and Lower), E-
J, F-K, G, M-N, O, and P and several areas of sub-economic mineralization.  The 
relative location of the mineralised zones is illustrated in Figure 4.3.    

Of the ten zones, only the Upper and Lower N, O, and G zones are the subject of this 
report. They are the main targets for development, as they were lower grade at the 
time of mine closure and remain either selectively mined or undeveloped.The nickel 
and copper mineralization of the A Plug pipes and zones consists primarily of 
pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite and minor amounts of pyrite and trace of 
sphalerite, magnetite and ilmenite. 

The mineralization of the pipes and zones can be classified as disseminated, plutonic 
breccia, sulphide breccia, massive sulphides and some siliceous felsite 
mineralization (Pinsent, 1980).  Disseminated sulphides consist of interstitial and 
fine-grained sulphides that are distributed homogenously.  Plutonic breccia material 
occurs at the contact of the mineralized intrusive pipe and the barren gabbro country 
rock displaying subrounded xenoliths of either diorite or gabbro.  The host rocks can 
vary from undeformed to completely recrystallized.  Sulphide breccia material 
consists of sub-angular to rounded inclusions of silicate.  Massive sulphides are 
generally coarser-grained and may cut the disseminated, plutonic breccia and 
sulphide breccia mineralization consisting of pods and veins.  Siliceous felsite 
mineralization consists of fine-grained quartz and plagioclase matrix that is often 
brittle in nature occurring as inclusions in the plutonic and sulphide breccia material. 

The pyrrhotite mineralization is comprised of interlocking crystals of fine-through to 
coarse-grained crystals that are separated by a network of stringers and veinlets of 
pentlandite that contain patches of pyrrhotite. 

The pentlandite mineralization often occurs as stringers cutting the pyrrhotite 
crystals.  Pentlandite veinlets and blebs are generally interstitial crystals associated 
with the pyrrhotite. Disseminated mineralization occurs as flames of pentlandite in 
the granular pyrrhotite. 

The chalcopyrite mineralization occurs as patches, blebs and veins of the 
disseminated to massive sulphides. Chalcopyrite veins often replace earlier pyrite, 
pyrrhotite and both the flame and vein pentlandite (Pinsent, 1980). The chalcopyrite 
appears to be crystallized later than the pyrrhotite and pentlandite. Sphalerite 
mineralization generally occurs in disseminated sulphides associated with the pyrite 
and chalcopyrite.

9 . 2  A  Z O N E  

The A zone is located 90 metres to the northeast of A Shaft with mineralization from 
surface to the 2,000 foot level.  Mineralization is typically disseminated sulphides that 
are concentrated into lenses within the faulted amphibolite pipe.  The amphibolite 
pipe lies adjacent to a large mass of QHD.  The zone has an ill-defined irregular 
contact with the amphibolite and erratic nickel and copper grades that increased in 
zones of brecciation along faulting. The faulting post-dates mineralization. 

9 . 3  B  Z O N E  

The B zone is located west of the Farley Shaft about 230 metres, with mineralization 
from subsurface outcrop to below the 3,000 foot level. The mineralized lenses of the 
zone lie adjacent to a large continuous peridotite body underlying the footwall B, B-K, 
F and K zones. Generally the mineralized lenses have an average length of 100 
metres and width of 25 metres occurring en echelon. 

The B zone has been disrupted by seven many major reverse faults and numerous 
imbricate splays stemming from the faulting. 

The mineralization of the B zone is composed of massive sulphide; sulphide 
cemented breccia and disseminated sulphide material. 

9 . 4  B - K  Z O N E S  

The B-K zone is a set of discontinuous, structurally controlled mineralized lenses 
lying between the B and K zones.  Mineralization extends from approximately the 
2,100 foot level to 3,500 foot level.  The zone is 60 metres wide and has a strike of 
315° azimuth and dips at about 50° to the northeast.  B-K zone is structurally 
controlled by two separate parallel dykes of QHD on each side of the zone that 
separates the B and K zones. 

The mineralized lenses of the B-K consist of disseminated clots and blebs of 
sulphides hosted in amphibolite and mottled gabbro. 

9 . 5  C  Z O N E  

The C zone is located approximately 350 metres northwest of the A shaft. The zone 
extends from near surface with weak mineralization to the 1 4th level of the A Mine at 
about the 1,100 foot level. The mineralization lies adjacent to a large body of QHD 
that separates the A and C zone. 

The C zone is cut-off at the 14th level by the Contact fault, striking north and dipping 
30° to the east that may also be related to the disruption of the E and J zones to the 
south. The cut-off portion of the C zone has not been identified.

Mineralization consists of disseminated sulphides in amphibolite and cemented 
breccia sulphide material. 

9 . 6  D  Z O N E  

The D zone consists of two lenses, upper and lower, that lie in the same structural 
plane separated by approximately 80 metres vertically. The lenses strike at 020° 
azimuth with a dip of 75° to the northwest. 

The Upper D zone lies 550 metres northeast of the A Shaft with mineralization 
extending from the 12th level to approximately the 20th level (about 1,600 feet below 
surface). The tabular zone consists of disseminated, semi-massive and massive 
sulphides in a fine grained diorite host rock. The Upper D fault, which strikes at 315° 
azimuth and dips at 50° to the northwest, divides the zone into two distinct partially 
separated lenses. The lens is approximately 140 metres in length with an average of 
15 metres of width. 

The Lower D zone is situated 500 metres from the A Shaft with mineralization 
extending from just above the 2,000 foot level down to about the 2,600 foot level. 
The mineralization occurs in diorite as weak disseminated sulphides with an extent of 
260 metres in length and 20 to 25 metres in width.  The lens is cut by the Lower D 
fault that strikes at 325° azimuth and a shallow dip of 30° to the southwest at the 
2,150 foot level.

The E and J zones are believed to be faulted counterparts of the same ore lens that 
has separated the hangingwall E zone to the southwest along the E-J fault. The E-J 
fault strikes 330° azimuth and dips 50° to the east. 

The E zone is located 280 metres southwest of the A Shaft with an overall 
mineralization extent from surface down to the 12th level. Mineralization occurs as 
disseminated sulphides in a talcose rich amphibolite and peridotite about 120 metres 
in length and 10 to 15 metres in width. The zone has been cut by two reverse faults 
on the 4th and 7th levels. 

The J zone is located 200 metres southwest of the A Shaft, extending from the 12th 
level to the 2,000 foot level. Mineralization consists largely of disseminated sulphides 
in amphibolite and gabbro host rocks that have been cut by reverse faults striking 
040° azimuth and dipping 55° to the southwest. 

9 . 8  F - K  Z O N E S  

The F and K zones have been interpreted as dislocated components of a single 
mineralized pipe. The F zone is the upper portion of the zone located 430 metres 
northwest of the Farley Shaft, with mineralization from 850 feet to 1,700 feet below

surface. The lower portion is the K zone, which is located 340 metres from the Farley 
Shaft, with mineralization extending from 1,550 feet to 3,000 feet below surface. 

The F zone mineralization of economic grade however is located in an 80 metre 
diameter pipe situated 950 feet below surface with a strike of 146° azimuth and a 
plunge of 50° to the southeast. The weakly mineralized amphibolite and gabbro has 
been dislocated by near vertical reverse faults and several imbricate faults with 
mineralization occurring as discontinuous lenses. The imbricate faults appear to be 
related to the Porphyry Shear a major fault that intersects the B zone. The F fault a 
major fault strikes 030° azimuth and dips at 70° to the northwest. 

The K zone is a narrower portion of the single pipe with a size of 45 metres in 
diameter and a similar plunge to the southeast as F. The zone has been disrupted by 
northwest striking faults, which has divided the zone into slices. The K shear strikes 
at 330° azimuth and dips 60° to the southwest, further dividing the ore pipe into 
upper and lower portions, which thrusts the upper portion to the northeast. 
Mineralization consists of disseminated sulphides in amphibolite and gabbro, 
sulphide breccia and veins of massive sulphide. 

9 . 9  G  Z O N E  

The G zone is located to the south of E zone with weak mineralization extending 
from the 12th level to below the 3,000 foot level. Improved nickel and copper grades 
lie in close proximity to the 3,000 foot level. Mineralization is hosted in sulphide 
breccia gabbro and weakly mineralized amphibolite units. The G zone has been 
exploration drilled to a depth of 4,500 foot with mineralized intersections. The 
mineralized zone has been block faulted by shallow faults striking 330° azimuth and 
a dip of 30° to the northeast. 

9 . 1 0  M - N  Z O N E S  

The M and N zones are interpreted to be faulted disrupted counterparts of a single 
mineralized pipe. The pipe extends from the O fault at 4,500 feet below surface to 
the subsurface outcrop of the M zone. The mineralization therefore lies above and 
below the Lynn Lake fault or Griffith Shear that strikes at 300° azimuth and dips 50° 
to the northeast.  The M zone does not appear in Figure 4.3 as it is outside the 
projection of the longitudinal. 

The M zone is located at surface about 1,300 metres southeast of Farley Shaft along 
the A Plug gabbro contact and the Wasekwan country rock volcanics. Mineralization 
consists of weakly mineralized amphibolite with a diameter of 100 metres that has 
been truncated at a depth of 150 metres by the Lynn Lake fault. 

The extensive N zone mineralization is also located adjacent to the A Plug contact 
and the country rock Wasekwan volcanics at about 1,100 metres south of the Farley 
Shaft.

Mineralization extends from the Lynn Lake Fault or Griffith Shear on the 1,600 foot 
level to the O fault at approximately 4,500 feet from surface. The majority of the 
mineralization is disseminated sulphides. 

The N zone consists of several lenses within a pipe of mineralized amphibolite to 
gabbro that has been cut by a large peridotite body and numerous thrust faults 
striking 030° azimuth and dipping 30° to the northwest. The faulting has displaced 
these blocks successively higher to the southeast. The Lynn Lake fault overlies and 
the O fault underlies the N zone mineralization. The upper and lower 1,730 shear 
separate the upper and lower N zones. The mineralized pipe is crudely sub-circular 
on the order of 250 to 300 metres in diameter. 

9 . 1 1  O  Z O N E  

The O zone is located 750 metres from the Farley Shaft, hosted in mineralized 
amphibolite that intruded the A Plug gabbro. The O zone extends from the O fault on 
the 3,550 foot level to the Lynn Lake fault on the 1,600 foot level. Extensive faulting 
on the Dyke shear has displaced the O zone into upper and lower portions. The 
complex Dyke shear that trends north-south and dips 40° to the west has separated 
the Upper and Lower by approximately 90 to 100 metres. 

The upper O zone pipe has been structurally juxtaposed by a number of reverse 
faults from 1,900 to 2,400 foot level. These reverse faults are probably curved splays 
from the underlying Dyke shear that trends north-south and dips off to the west. The 
mineralized lenses of the upper O zone consists of disseminated, sulphide breccia 
and veins of massive sulphides in a sub-circular nature. 

The lower O zone that lies below the complicated Dyke shear consists mainly of 
disseminated sulphide material hosted in amphibolite. The lower O zone is sub-
circular in nature and plunges steeply to the southeast. The pipe is cut out by the O 
fault on the 3,550 foot level. 

9 . 1 2  P  Z O N E  

The P zone is located 700 metres southwest of the Farley Shaft and 200 metres 
northwest of the O zone. P zone extends from the same dyke shear that displaces 
the upper and lower O zone at approximately 2,800 feet below surface into weakly 
mineralized gabbro down to 3,500 foot level. The mineralization is cut by a series of 
mafic dykes striking north and dipping 60º to the west and by numerous faults that 
terminate at 2,800 foot level. 

9 . 1 3  D I S C O  Z O N E  

The Disco zone is located deep in the footwall from the main Lynn Lake trend (Figure 
4.4).  This is a recent discovery, which does not have enough information to properly 
characterize the zone.

Prophecy has not conducted any sample preparation or analyses of any sort on the 
property. 

Details of the sample preparation, analyses and security of the pre-1976 data are not 
known to Wardrop.  However, during the period of mine operation, the samples were 
prepared and analyses were completed at the mine Property mill complex.   

During the 2006-2008 drill programs, Independent Nickel geologists used the sample 
preparation outlined below: 

Samples were prepared by an employee and sawn in half on site at a designated 
logging facility located in Lynn Lake, Manitoba. Upon splitting, samples were 
removed from the cutting room to a separate area for bagging.  Standard and blank 
samples were inserted every 20th and 21st sample respectively.  Standard material 
used was from the Certified Chemical Reference Materials Project (CCRMP) as 
managed by the Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN).  Each sample was bagged 
and sealed with ties to ensure no interaction between samples before they were sent 
by freight to the laboratory for analyses. 

Samples were shipped to the ALS Chemex preparation laboratory in Thunder Bay, 
Ontario where each sample was weighed, crushed to > 70% -2 millimetres, split off 
and pulverized up to 250 grams to > 85% - 75 micron before being shipped to an 
analytical laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Samples were assayed for 
nickel, copper and cobalt, using an atomic absorption method (AA) for up two 
analyses depending on results.  Nickel and cobalt have a 2-10,000 parts per million 
detection limit and 1-10,000 parts per million detection limit for copper.  Samples that 
exceed 10,000 parts per million were further analyzed and reported as a percent.  
Platinum, palladium and gold analyses were conducted using ICP-AES method. ALS 
Chemex is an accredited laboratory with ISO 9001-2000 

All standard material (SRM) data were verified using scatter and Thompson-Howarth 
quality control plots.  Wardrop have not reviewed the results of the SRM data and 
cannot comment on the validity of the results. 

Diamond drill core and metallurgical samples are stored on site and are generally in 
good condition (Figures 13.1 and 13.2). 

Wardrop is of the option that the samples preparation, security and analytical 
procedures used during the 2006 to 2008 drill programs meet industry standards at 
the time and are reliable.

Prophecy has not generated any new data requiring validation. 

Wardrop carried out an internal validation from the original drillhole logs and the 
drillhole database on 186 (5%) of the 3,709 drillholes in the total database.  Data 
verification was completed on collar co-ordinates, end of hole depth, down-the-hole 
survey measurements, From and To footage measurements of geology and assay 
sampling intervals, lithological unit and nickel and copper percentages that were 
compiled from hand written drill logs into an Microsoft Access database. Most errors 
were insignificant and related to mistakes in transcription. Details of the verification 
are set out in Table 14.1.  The digitizing of drawings and maps were validated on an 
on-going basis with information being visually checked while importing the digitized 
areas to Datamine geological software.  The data verification had less than 1% of 
errors.

A ten sample check assay program was completed on historical half split core during 
the site visit on July 26 to 28, 2005. The sampling was from two mineralized drillholes 
from the N orebody and was sent to ALS Chemex laboratory in Toronto.  Overall 
results from this sampling showed a decrease of 13% nickel and 22% copper, 
comparing assay results over the same intervals from historical drillhole data.  

The data set being used for assay validation is considered too restrictive having been 
selected from only two boreholes in one orebody. Ten samples are not considered 
statistically representative. However, the results are considered relevant and further 
validation is recommended. 

The quality of the data is considered valid to support the resource statement as 
completed in this report.

The validation of the Independent Nickel drill collar locations was initiated during the 
2009 site visit.  Eighteen drill collars representing 22% of the new drilling completed 
by Independent Nickel was surveyed using a hand held Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx.  
GPS reading were collecting in UTM NAD 83 co-ordinates system and can converted 
to the local mine grid co-ordinate system for future validation against the data 
provided in the drill hole database.  None of the Independent Nickel drill data has 
been used in the resources estimation as all the drilling was outside the resources

Since 1953, there have been a total of five additional operating mines in the Lynn 
Lake Greenstone Belt, not including the Lynn Lake A Shaft and Farley Shaft.  The 
mines operated at different periods. Currently no operating mines are active in the 
belt, see Figure 15.1.

The following historical estimates are disclosed using the historical 
terminology.  Wardrop considers the historical estimates relevant and 
produced within industry standards of the time, though not necessarily 
reliable.   

A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical 
estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  Neither Wardrop, 
nor the Company are treating the historical estimates as current mineral 
resources or mineral reserves as defined in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of National 
Instrument 43-101; and the historical estimates should not be relied upon. 

The following information is summarized from Pinsent, 1980, unless otherwise 
cited. 

1 5 . 1  E L  M I N E  

The Lynn Lake EL Mine is located 3.8 kilometres southeast of the Lynn Lake Nickel 
Property A Shaft.  The EL mine occurs within the central portion of a vertical mafic to 
ultramafic pluton that was intruded into the same volcanic rocks of the Lynn Lake 
Nickel Property belonging to the Precambrian Wasekwan Group.  The pluton is 
approximately 500 metres in diameter at surface and tapers to 200 metres at a depth 
of 610 metres.  The mineralization lies within amphibolite and altered peridotite.  
Production of the EL mine began in May 1954, however historic production figures 
were incorporated with the A mine and no distinction was made from historical 
documents.  Historic resources have been restricted to the top 270 metres of the 
deposit. and an estimate of 1.0 million tons at an average grade of 3.25% nickel and 
1.09% copper was were reported by Pinsent, 1980 for the mined upper portion of the 
mine. In the absence of clarification, these would probably constitute "Inferred" 
resources under CIM terminology.    

1 5 . 2  F O X  M I N E  

The Fox Mine is located 45 kilometres southwest of the Town of Lynn Lake, 
accessible via Provincial Highway Number 396.  The deposit was mainly a large 
body of massive to semi-massive sulphides occurring in Precambrian volcanic and 
interbedded sedimentary rocks. A total of 12 million tonnes (unclassified) of ore with 
an average grade of 1.82% copper and 1.78% zinc was mined and milled from 1970 
to the mine closure in 1985 (Olsen 1987).  

1 5 . 3  M A C L E L L A N  M I N E  

The Maclellan Mine is located seven kilometres northeast of Lynn Lake, accessible 
via Provincial Road No. 391.  The deposit lies within units of basaltic and ultramafic 
komatiite flows and tuffs, which can be subdivided into laterally discontinuous series 
of mineralized zones as follows: Central, East, and Dot Lake Zones.  The Maclellan 
Mine started production in late 1986, however, due to the irregular mineralization

geometry and construction complications, the Maclellan Mine experience difficulty in 
efficiently producing. 

1 5 . 4  F A R L E Y  L A K E  

The Farley Lake deposit is located approximately 36 kilometres east from the Town 
of Lynn Lake adjacent to Provincial Road Number 391.  The deposit is an iron 
formation, intercalated with clastic sediments hosting several zones of gold 
mineralization.  Historic production on the property between 1996 to 1999 by Black 
Hawk Mining Inc. totalled 1.4 million tonnes (unclassified) with an average grade of 
about 4.3 grams per tonne gold.  

1 5 . 5  B T  M I N E  

The Burnt Timber or BT Mine is located about 13 kilometres from the Town of Lynn 
Lake.  The BT Mine deposit is situated in highly altered sequence of Wasekwan 
Group, mafic volcanic to metasedimentary rocks.  The majority of the gold 
mineralization is within laminated shears of mylonitic and silicified metasediments 
and mafic volcanic rocks. Historic production on the property by Black Hawk Mining 
Inc., from 1993 to 1996 totalled 1.3 million tonnes (unclassified) at an average grade 
of 2.8 grams per tonne gold.  

1 5 . 6  Z  D E P O S I T  

The Z deposit is located 2.5 kilometres south and 0.5 kilometres east of the Lynn 
Lake A shaft just south of the Lynn Lake River.  The deposit lies adjacent to the 
mafic-ultramafic intrusion of the A Plug and consists of a small deposit of zinc and 
copper bearing sulphides in quartz- hornblende gneisses.  Associated with the 
mineralization is a dioritic body that may be the intrusive origin. A historic estimate  
was identified in 1949 by Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd., as 136,000 tonnes 
(unclassified) grading 1.13% copper, 2.49% zinc and minor gold. In the absence of 
clarification, these would probably constitute "Inferred" resources under CIM 
terminology.    

1 5 . 7  Y  D E P O S I T  

Another deposit that lies adjacent and to the northeast of the A Plug intrusion is the 
historic Y deposit with a historic resource of 53,000 tons at an average grade of 
0.17% copper, 4.57% zinc and 0.87% lead.  In the absence of clarification, these 
would probably constitute "Inferred" resources under CIM terminology.  Mineral

Wardrop has estimated the mineral resource estimate of the N, O and G zones of the 
Lynn Lake Nickel project.  Wardrop has produced previous estimates for the Lynn 
Lake property in October 2005 and 2007, which are disclosed in "Lynn Lake Nickel 
Project Pre-feasibility Study" NI43-101 compliant technical report (Wardrop, 2007). 

The 2009 estimate uses current metal prices, recoveries and calculating a Gross 
Metal Value (GMV) and nickel equivalent (NiEQ) for each zone. 

The model was updated using Datamine Studio 3® version 3.18.2715.0. 

The current resource has been estimated by Todd McCracken, P.Geo. Principal 
Geologist with Wardrop Engineering Inc.  Todd has over 18 years of geological 
experience in exploration and operations including 8 year of resources estimation of 
nickel sulphide deposits.  Todd is independent of the issuer and has had no prior 
involvement with this property. 

16.1.1 WIREFRAME CHECK 

Wardrop verified the wireframe volumes for each zone and compared the result to 
the findings from 2007 wireframe volume verification. Portions of the N and O Zones 
have been mined and were wire framed separately (Figure 16.1 to 16.3). 

Table 16.1 summarizes the results of the wireframe volume verification.

16.1.2 GMV AND NIEQ FORMULA 

The GMV and NiEq formula were calculated using the following parameters: 

• Metal recoveries; due to investigating the bio-leach option and not having 
yet received result the metal recoveries are set as follows: 

 Nickel 100% 

 Copper 100%. 

Metal prices were derived from the Energy & Metals Consensus Forecast (EMCF) 
instead of the typical three year rolling average used in this type of study.  The 
reason behind the use of the EMCF is due to the significant drop in metal prices 
within the last year, thus resulting in the three year rolling average price being 



 
 

 Prophecy Resources Corp. 43 1055400100-REP-L0001-05 
Lynn Lake Nickel Project  May 2010 
 

substantially higher than is currently forecasted. The long range metal prices are 
based on the EMCF October 2009 report and are effective until January 31st 2010. 

• Nickel US$7.22 

• Copper US$2.00 

The following formulas were used in Datamine to update the GMV and NiEQ for each 
zone. 

GMV2010 = (2.00 x CU% x 22.04622) + (7.22 x NI% x 22.04622) 

NiEq2010 = (((2.00 x CU% x 22.04622) + (7.22 x NI% x 22.04622))/7.22)/20 

16.1.3 DENSITY FACTOR 

Density factors were applied to the various zones to calculate tonnages. 

• N Zone: 0.100564 ton/ft3 

• O Zone: 0.101672 ton/ft3 

• G Zone: 0.105263 ton/ft3 

16.1.4 BLOCK MODEL UPDATE 

Wardrop updated the block models for the N, O and G Zones. The name of the 
Datamine regularized block models updated are as follows: 

• N_reg_4_2009 is the N Zone total resource with mined out zones removed. 

• O_reg_4_2009 is the O Zone total resource with mined out zones removed. 

• G_reg_4_2009 is the G Zone total resource (inferred only). 

The mineral resource for the Lynn Lake Nickel Project is tabulated in Tables 16.2, 
16.3, and 16.4 for the Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources respectively.  The 
resources are tabulated using NIEQ greater than 0.3% and displaying every 0.1% to 
an upper bound of greater than 1.0% NIEQ.Tables.

Mineral resources estimates were conducted by Wardrop to confirm historical 
reserve and resource calculations for the historic N, O and G orebodies.  
Calculations were also completed on the historic lower and upper D and P orebodies 
for resource model validation, comparing historic tons and grades to those Wardrop 
computed.  

16.2.1 DATA DATABASE 
Wardrop compiled all the data used in completing the mineral resource from original 
source drillhole documents and from plan and section originals and copies.  The 
Property has been drilled by 7,800 drillholes; however, only drillholes within the areas 
of interest and with exploration potential were entered into the database.  Selection 
of drillholes was conducted systematically on each area from plan and section 
drawings identifying all holes that were used for historic geological interpretation and 
additional holes to be used in completing the mineral resource. Unfortunately, not all 
the drillholes selected were available from original source documents.  Table 16.6 
summarizes the entered into database and unavailable drillholes by historic orebody 
area.

The mining and geology information was obtained from plan and section drawings 
that were scanned and digitized.  Scanning included 110 drawings received from 
Lynn Lake Nickel and an additional 285 drawings identified from historic information 
at the Manitoba Mines Branch in Winnipeg. Drawings scanned from the Manitoba 
Mines Branch were part of the mine closure two microfiche data set submitted by 
Sherritt in the Summer of 1979.  The scans were digitized into AutoCAD, which 
included information of mined out areas, drift development, ore outlines and fault 
planes.  AutoCAD digitized drawings were imported into the Datamine working 
computer model on the Property. 

16.2.2 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
ASSAYS 

The three zones N, O and G, which are part of the mineral resource, and the upper 
and lower D and P orebodies for resource model validation were sampled by a total 
of 2,290 drillholes that generated 46,764 assays (Table 16.7).  Complete assay

information were provided for nickel and copper, in addition 438 (1% of samples) 
were assayed for cobalt, 22 for zinc, 12 for gold and silver and 8 for platinum.  
Boxplots were created to provide a comparison of assay grades within the various 
interpreted solids for each zone.

COMPOSITES 

Assays were composited into 10 foot down-hole composites while honouring the 
interpreted geological solids.  Table 16.7, summarizes the composite statistics for 
each of the six areas investigated.  Zero grades were included in the composite if the 
intervals within the solids were not sampled. Assays below the detection limit, 
identified as NIL in the drillhole log were recorded as zero grades in the database.  
Assays recorded as trace were assigned a grade of 0.01% for nickel, copper, cobalt 
and 0.0005 ounces per ton for gold, silver or platinum. 

Histograms and probability plots were created to provide a comparison of composite 
grades within the various interpreted solids for each zone. 

TONNAGE FACTOR 

The drillhole log and working database does not include any bulk density or tonnage 
factor statistics, Wardrop computed tonnage factors based on nickel and copper 
grades from trendline formulas, graphing iron and insolubles against nickel grades on 
assayed intervals for each zone and orebody.  

Strong relationships were identified between assayed nickel values and percentages 
of iron and insolubles.  These correlations were then used to estimate tonnage 
factors for each individual zone based on trendline formulas, sample assay data and 
chemical formulas of chalcopyrite, pentlandite and pyrrhotite.  Certain assumptions 
were used in order to determine the tonnage factor:  

• Amount of total iron is derived from pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcoyprite. 

• Copper is derived entirely from chalcopyrite. 

• Nickel is derived entirely from pentlandite. 



 
 

 Prophecy Resources Corp. 50 1055400100-REP-L0001-05 
Lynn Lake Nickel Project  May 2010 
 

• Insolubles specific gravity assumed as 2.85.  

Trendlines and r-squared values were computed from graphing iron and insolubles 
against nickel values, displayed in Table 16.8.

factor was not available.  A tonnage factor of 9.5 ft³ per ton was used for this 
mineralization which corresponds to Sherritt's historic reserve calculation 
documentation on the G zone.  

Tonnage factor calculations derived from computed trendline formulas of iron and 
insolubles percentages based on block model grades of nickel.  An example of a 
tonnage factor calculation determination is computed below for O zone:  

Example: Ni% = 0.93 and Cu% = 0.40  

Referring to Table 16.10, for O zone:  

Ni% = 0.0808 x Fe% - 0.4425, therefore Fe% = 16.99 and  

Ni% = -0.0455 x Insol% + 4.0446, therefore Insol% = 68.45 Using the chemical 
formulas, atomic weights and average specific gravity (SG) for the following minerals:  

Chalcopyrite CuFeS2, SG = 4.9  

Pentlandite (Fe,Ni)9S8, assuming only Ni, no Fe in pentlandite, SG = 4.2  

Pyrrhotite is Fe1-xS, assuming only Fe, no Ni or other element in pyrrhotite, SG = 4.6.  
The following percentages and SG's are displayed in Table 16.10.  

Table 16.10 O Zone 

Component  Percentages SG 

Chalcopryite  1.16 4.9 
Pentlandite  1.38 4.2 
Pyrrhotite  26.19 4.6 
Insolubles  68.45 2.85 
Total  97.18 3.37 

 

The tonnage factor for an SG of 3.37 using the formula in the above table is 
equivalent to 9.53 ft³ per ton (0.11 ton per ft³)  

NICKEL EQUIVALENT FORMULA 

In the October 2005 resource model a nickel-equivalent (NIEQ) formula was 
developed for the Lynn Lake Nickel model to express the component of copper in 
terms of a nickel grade.  The NIEQ did not include any metal recovery factors in the 
formula and is based on the average nickel price of the past three years (to end of 
August 2005) of US$5.00 per pound. and copper price of US$1.00 per pound. The 
formula used for determination of NIEQ grade was as follows:  

NIEQ = Ni% + Cu%/5

This has been updated as reported in Section 16.1.2. 

RESOURCE MODEL 

Three-dimensional wireframe models of mineralization were developed for the N, O 
and G zones based on a NIEQ cut-off of greater than 0.3%.  Areas of mined out and 
drift development in mineralization were also created for the N and O zones, the G 
zone had no historic mining or drift development in the interpreted mineralization, see 
Figures 16.4, 16.5 and 16.6 respectively of the N, O and G zones.  Three-
dimensional wireframe models of the historic mineralized interpretation of lower and 
upper D, and P orebodies were also created for resource model validation, 
comparing historic tons and grades to Wardrop computed values.  

The zones of mineralization interpreted for each area were generally contiguous; 
however, due to the reverse block faulting throughout the Property especially evident 
in the mineralized zones, mineralization often terminated or shifted along these 
planes in one or more directions.  

Some non-assayed or non-mineralized intervals were incorporated into the 
interpreted solids.  No minimum thickness criterion for sulphide mineralization was 
used in the development of the solids.  Future work could incorporate an approach to 
minimize dilution from non-assayed intervals.

Sectional interpretations were digitized in Datamine Version 2.1.1444.0 software, and 
these interpretations were linked with tag strings and triangulated to build three-
dimensional solids.  Table 16.11, tabulates the solids and associated volumes.  The

SPATIAL ANALYSIS 

Variography, using Sage2001 software, was completed for nickel and copper values 
in N and O zones for which there were sufficient data available.  Downhole 
variograms were used to determine nugget effect and then correlograms were 
modelled to determine spatial continuity in the N and O zones.  Table 16.12 
summarizes results of the variography.  The G zone did not contain sufficient number 
of composites to conduct variography. 

BLOCK MODEL  

Block models were established in Datamine for the N, O and G zones and Lower D, 
Upper D and P orebodies.  

Block Size 

Drillhole spacing varies with the majority of the drilling tightly spaced from 25 to 50 
feet, only the Lower N area below elevation 3,000 feet is spaced at 100 foot intervals.  
A block size of 10 x 10 x 10 feet was selected in order to accommodate the more 
closely spaced drilling. 

Table 16.13 summarizes the block limits for N, O, G zones and lower D, upper D and 
P orebodies respectively.

INTERPOLATION PLAN  

The interpolation of the N and O zones were completed using the estimation 
methods: nearest neighbour (NN), inverse distance squared (ID2) and ordinary 
kriging (OK). The estimations were designed for three passes. In the first pass, the 
search distance for inclusion of data was 83 to 195 feet for nickel and 55 to 115 feet 
for copper and was designed to estimate blocks if a minimum of two composites 
were found in the search.  The search distance in the second pass was 150% the 
size of the first pass and the third pass was 200% of the first pass.  

MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIF ICATION 

Several factors are considered in the definition of a resource classification:  

• CIM requirements and guidelines. 

• Experience with similar deposits. 

• Spatial continuity.  

No known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing 
or other relevant issues are known to the authors that may affect the estimate of 
mineral resources. Mineral reserves can only be estimated on the basis of an 
economic evaluation that is used in a Preliminary Feasibility study or a Feasibility

study of a mineral project; thus, no reserves have been estimated.  As per NI 43-101, 
mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. Mineral resources were classified according to a number of 
criteria.  Table 16.14 summarizes those classification parameters.

2005 MINERAL RESOURCE CALCULATION 

The resource reported in October 2005 has been tabulated in terms of a revised 
NIEQ calculation (Section 16.1.4).  The mineral resource for the Lynn Lake Nickel 
Project is tabulated in Tables 16.15, 16.15, and 16.17 for the Measured, Indicated 
and Inferred resources respectively.  The resources are tabulated using NIEQ 
greater than 0.5% and displaying every 0.1% to an upper bound of greater than 1.0% 
NIEQ. 

Histograms and probability plots were created to provide a comparison of block 
model nickel and copper grades for the zones.

VALIDATION  

The Lynn Lake Nickel grade models were validated by three methods: 

1. Visual comparison of colour-coded block model grades with composite 
grades on section and plan.  

2. Comparison of the global mean block grades for ordinary kriging, inverse 
distance squared, nearest neighbour and composites.  

3. Comparison of historic tons and grades reported (Pinsent, 1980) of the N, O 
and G zones of the mineral resource and additional Lower D, Upper D and P 
orebodies that have been either mined out or selectively mined.  

Visual  Compar isons  

The visual comparisons of block model grades with composite grades for each of the 
three zones and orebodies show a reasonable correlation between the values.  No 
significant discrepancies were apparent from the sections and plans reviewed.

G lobal  Compar isons  

The global block model statistics for the ordinary kriging model were compared to the 
global inverse distance squared and nearest neighbour model values.  Table 16.18 
shows the comparisons of the global N and O zones for the three estimation method 
calculations of NN, IDZ and OK. In general, there is agreement between the ordinary 
kriging model and inverse distance squared model and nearest neighbour model.

Larger discrepancies are reflected as a result of lower drill density in some portions 
of the model. There is a degree of smoothing apparent from the ordinary kriging, 
which reflects the data density to a great extent. Comparisons were made using all 
blocks.  

Histor ic  Compar isons 

The historic comparison is another mode of validation that increases the confidence 
of the mineral resource estimations.  The comparison was conducted on the global 
N, O and G zones including the mined out areas and the lower D, upper D and P 
orebodies, which are not a part of the mineral resource.  Wardrop's interpreted 
mineralization was based >0.3% NIEQ. Generally there was correlation with 
Sherritt's interpretations but differences exist.  Table 17.18 summarizes the results 
from Wardrop calculated to report historically in Tables:  

1. 6.1 and 6.2 (Pinsent, 1980).  The historic LynnGold estimate of resources 
reported in Table 16.18 

2. 6.3 are summarized and compared with Wardrop's estimations in Table 
16.19 and 16.20 for higher and lower grade material.  Generally, there is a 
correlation with LynnGold estimations.

18.1.1 EXISTING MINE WORKINGS 

The Lynn Lake deposit was formerly mined as sub-level open (blast-hole) stoping 
(Pinsent, 1980).  This mining method was changed to cut-and-fill mining in the last 
four years of operation (between 1972 and 1976).  This more selective method was 
used on the Upper O, Lower O (below 3,000 foot level), P (3,000 foot level), the 
lowermost B-K and the N (between 2000 and 3000 foot levels) zones to minimize 
dilution and optimize extraction. 

Following closure in 1976, the mine workings have since flooded naturally to near-
surface.  The property eventually saw alternative use for its mill including the 
processing of gold-bearing rocks and subsequent storage of tailings in the shaft and 
underground mine workings. 

Figure 18.1 shows the extensive nature of the mine workings and particularly, the 
distance separating the access shafts and the mineralized zones.  The property has 
two shafts referred to as the A Shaft and the Farley Shaft.  The Farley Shaft is 3,450 
feet (1,052 metres) deep. 

The O zone is located approximately 2,000 feet (600 metres) horizontally from the 
Farley Shaft.  The N zone is 3,600 feet (1,100 metres) from the shaft.  The two 
mineralized zones are not in direct alignment with the Farley Shaft.  The O zone is 
separated into two zones referred to as the Upper O and Lower O.  Some minor 
amount of development provides access to this zone.  The N zone also has upper 
and lower zones.  The Upper N Zone has some development work and the Lower N 
Zone has none.

Based on the drill hole density and historical production within the zones estimated, 
the data is sufficiently reliable to support the resource estimate generated for the N, 
O and G zones.   

At a nickel equivalent cut-off grade of 0.4% NiEQ, the N and O zones contain a 
Measured and Indicated Resource of about 22.9 million tons with an average grade 
of 0.57% nickel and 0.30% copper.  The Inferred Resource totals 8.1 million tons with 
an average grade of 0.51% nickel and 0.28% copper in the N, O and G zones. 

The tonnage factor values derived from computed calculations are based on a limited 
amount of sampled information, which may reflect a lack of precision with respect to 
the resource tonnages. 

The geological interpretation completed was based on nickel-equivalent cut-off of 
0.3% and did not establish hard or soft boundaries between various lithological units. 
These boundaries were not established due to inconsistencies in the drill hole 
logging throughout the 24 year mine life. Note that cut-offs essentially create great 
contacts in generally a mineralized rock, that is dilution is essentially at the cut-off 
grade but, the mineralization is not necessarily always contained along lithological 
boundaries due to fracturing and faulting and the remobilized nature of the deposit.

A two-phased approach to future exploration is recommended, with Phase 1 
estimated to cost $865,000 and Phase 2 estimated at $1,045,000. 

Phase 1 would primarily target the recently discovered near surface Disco Zone with 
a diamond drill program was well as conducting an Induced Polarization survey (IP) 
and bioleach metallurgical testing of the resource material (Figure 20.1). 

The Disco drilling program is designed to extend know mineralization along strike 
and down dip and well as in-fill to provide a better understanding of the geometry of 
the zone to allow for future resource estimate. 

The drilling campaign would also target the portions of the inferred resource in the N 
Zone in order to initiate the collection of data to permit the potential upgrading of the 
resource category. 

The IP survey is to be conducted on the southern portion of the property, with the 
intentions of locating near surface targets similar to the Disco Zone, which occurs 
along a different horizon from the main mine trend. 

The collection of material from drill core and other stockpiles sources is 
recommended to allow for a metallurgical study to investigation the potential of 
bioleaching in place of conventional milling.

The completion of phase 1 will allow for adjustment the Phase 2 drill plan locations.  
However, only a portion of the Phase 2 program is depended on the results of Phase 
1, as such, it is not contingent on the successful completion of Phase 1. 

Phase 2 of the exploration program involves diamond drilling to further improve the 
resource on the N and O zones as well as drill test any IP targets that may be 
generated.  Table 21.2 summarizes the cost to complete Phase 2.
