ITEM 1:  SUMMARY 

 

Azincourt Resources Inc. ("Azincourt" or the "Company") holds an exclusive option to acquire 

100% legal and beneficial ownership of twenty-five contiguous mineral tenures (6,167.15 

hectares) located in the Iskut River District in northwestern British Columbia and known as the 

Forgold Property (the "Forgold Property" or the "Property"). The Iskut River District forms part 

of northwest B.C.'s Golden Horseshoe and has been a focus for gold and silver exploration since 

the discovery of the Snip and Eskay Creek deposits in the mid 1980's.  Exploration work by 

various previous owners in the late 1980's and early 1990's identified multiple target areas 

within the Forgold Property that have undergone limited follow-up work and the Property is 

considered a promising, early stage exploration prospect.  Figure 1 and 2 are regional scale maps 

showing the location of the Forgold Property relative to the mineral claims, access roads, and 

mines and advanced exploration prospects within northwest B.C.'s Golden Horseshoe. 

  

The Forgold Property comprises an irregular shaped block approximately 18 kilometers long and 

four kilometers wide that straddles Forrest Kerr Creek approximately 20 kilometers north of the 

Iskut River.  There are no existing access roads and the only way to access the Forgold Property 

is by helicopter from the government maintained airstrip at Bob Quin on Highway 37 

approximately 25 kilometers to the east or from the Bronson airstrip (air access only) located on 

the south side of the Iskut River approximately 20 kilometers to the southwest. 

 

In order to exercise its option to acquire the Forgold Property, Azincourt must make staged cash 

payments totaling $300,000, issue an aggregate of 250,000 common shares and incur an 

aggregate of $900,000 in staged exploration expenditures on the Forgold Property before June 

1, 2017.  In addition, upon the exercise of the option the optionor is granted a 2-per-cent net 

smelter return royalty ("NSR") on production from the Forgold Property.  Azincourt has the right 

to purchase up to 1.5% of this NSR for $500,000 in cash for each 0.5% of the NSR. 

 

The claims adjoin the southern and southeastern boundaries of the "RDN property", currently 

owned by Kiska Metals Corp. ("Kiska") and straddle a package of prospective rock units localized 

along a complex, north to north east trending deformation zone known as the Forest Kerr Fault 

Zone ("FKF Zone").  According to the British Columbia Geological Survey ("BCGS") the rocks on 

the west side of the fault zone comprise poly-deformed Paleozoic aged Stikine Assemblage 

meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks and the rocks along the east side comprise Upper 

Triassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and Lower to Middle Jurassic Age volcanic rocks.  The 

Lower to Middle Jurassic aged volcanic rocks are correlative with the Eskay Creek Horizon. The 

Upper Triassic and Lower to Middle Jurassic rocks are intruded by Early to Middle Jurassic sills 

and stocks and are associated with known vein style mineralization in the Iskut River District. 



 

6 
 

  
According to the BCGS, drilling by Noranda Inc. (which was subsequently acquired by Xstrata plc) 

and High Frontier Resources Ltd. ("High Frontier") on the RDN Property in 1991 at a prospect 

known as the "Boundary Zone" (located immediately north of the central part of the present 

Forgold Property) reportedly intersected an 11.6 meter interval that averaged 23.9 g/t gold (The 

Northern Miner, Sept. 1991).    

 

It is important for the reader to note that the technical information regarding the 

mineralization encountered at the adjoining RDN property is included solely to demonstrate 

that the Forgold Property may be prospective for this style of mineralization.   

 

The author of this report has been unable to verify the foregoing information and this 

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Forgold Property. 

 

According to Termuende (1990) rock and silt sampling (within the central part of the present 

Forgold Property) traced the highly leached, sericite altered rocks that host the Boundary Zone 

for three kilometers to the south and discovered scattered, vein type base and precious metal 

mineralization.  To assess potential extensions of the Boundary Zone onto the claims comprising 

the present Forgold Property, previous owner Ecstall Mining Corp. ("Ecstall") and GoldFields 

Canadian Mining Ltd. ("Goldfields") completed a large soil geochemical survey in 1991 consisting 

of 1,475 samples.  According to Ronning (1991) several large anomalous areas (referred to as 

Zone A through C) were defined over a strike length of two kilometers and drill testing was 

recommended. 
 

Malensek et al. (1990) classified the vein mineralization into three types: all of which appear to 

be structurally controlled by the Forest Kerr Fault.  The vein types include: steeply dipping 

chalcopyrite veins containing minor galena and sphalerite, quartz-carbonate stockwork veins 

containing minor galena and sphalerite, and, silicified zones containing chalcopyrite.  All of the 

vein mineralization is reportedly localized within the Triassic aged rocks and the majority of the 

veins trend northeasterly.  In the Iskut River District the Triassic aged rocks are the host rocks for 

the former producing Snip mine (mesothermal vein type gold prospect) and for numerous alkalic 

copper-gold porphyry type deposits. 

 

In 1992, five holes were drilled by Ecstall and Goldfields close to the boundary between the 

Forgold Property and the RDN property. Drill holes FG1 to FG4 were laid out within the northern 

part of Target Zone A to test possible extension of the 1991 high-grade drill intersection 

reported by Noranda - High Frontier Resources Ltd. Two significant intersections of gold 

mineralization were reported; 3.9 g/t Au over 1.58 meters in drill hole FG-2 and 19.2 g/t Au over 

0.82 meters in drill hole FG-3 (Bond, 1992). Two narrow zones of copper mineralization were 

reportedly intersected in hole FG-5, located approximately one kilometer south of the other 4 



 

7 
 

holes (2.97% copper over an interval of 0.31 meters and 1.14% copper over an interval of 1.16 

meters.  Ecstall maintained the Forgold Property in good standing continuously until December 

of 2009 when the claims lapsed and were re-staked by the current owner.  It is important to 

note that subsequent re-staking of the claims resulted in the boundary between the properties 

being shifted several hundred meters to the south and as a result drill holes FG 1-4 are actually 

located within the RDN property immediately north of the current Forgold claim boundary.  The 

locations of the historic drill holes are shown in Figure 7.  

 

The author of this report has been unable to verify the foregoing information and this 

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Forgold Property. 

  
According to Savell and Grill (1991) alteration and mineralization discovered to date on the 

adjoining RDN property appears to represent an exposed root system of a volcanic center active 

in the Early Jurassic.  In addition to the potential for vein type mineralization Savell and Grill 

(1991) suggest the Middle Jurassic rocks to the east and south (ie. on the current Forgold 

Property) may have potential to host exhalative deposits (i.e. Eskay-type).  The RDN Property 

has been the focus of extensive exploration work, primarily for Eskay Creek type exhalative 

deposits, which is summarized in the adjoining property section of this report.  Considering 

recent increases in precious metal prices the Forgold Property is considered a property of merit 

that warrants additional exploration. 

  

During August and September of 2011 Azincourt consultants compiled the technical data 

generated by previous owners of the present Forgold Property into a GIS database, constructed 

detailed digital elevation models of the Property to support ongoing field work, made several 

site visits to the Property and carried out a systematic geochemical survey (281 samples) to 

verify the results of the 1991 geochemical survey completed by Ecstall and Goldfields.  The 

sampling program was conducted using conventional soil augers and trenching tools.  Sampling 

was completed along irregular elevation contour lines and covered an area measuring 

approximately 1,250 meters in length and 500 meters in width that crossed several of the 

anomalous zones (Target areas B and C) reported by Ecstall and Goldfields.   

  

The results of the geochemical survey completed by Azincourt in the central part of the Forgold 

Property have confirmed the extensive gold and base metal anomalies reported by Ecstall and 

Goldfields.  Gold values in the areas sampled ranged from trace levels to a high of 0.334 g/t gold 

and copper values were up to 694 ppm.  Large areas of the central part of the Forgold Property 

exhibit elevated precious and base metal values in soils and do not appear to have been tested 

by the limited drill program completed in 1992.  

  

A preliminary review of the historic exploration work completed in the northern eastern and 



 

8 
 

south western parts of the Forgold Property indicates that there are multiple stream, soil, float 

and rock samples that exhibit elevated gold, silver, base metal and/or pathfinder elements   that 

have not been followed up. 

It is recommended that the next stage of exploration work (Stage 1) at the Forgold Property 

consist of additional detailed soil sampling in the central part of the property and additional 

reconnaissance work to assess the target areas identified by previous operators in the 

northeastern and southwestern parts of the property.  The total estimated cost of the proposed 

Stage 1 program is $275,000.  In the event that significant drill targets are identified in Stage 1, a 

follow up program of preliminary drill testing (Stage 2) would be warranted at a cost of 

$440,000.

ITEM 2:  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

 

The author was retained by the Board of Directors of Azincourt to review available technical 

reports related to the Forgold Property and if warranted prepare an updated 43-101 compliant 

technical report (the "Technical Report") including recommendations for follow up exploration.  

The Qualified Person, who is the author of this Technical Report, has worked for several junior 

resource companies on various exploration projects in the Iskut River District since 1985. The 

author visited the Forgold Property on August 13, 2011.  The author notes that the subject 

Forgold Property is at an early stage of evaluation, however the Forgold Property is situated in 

an area which hosts several known precious and base metal occurrences that have been well 

documented by the B.C. Government.   

 

This Technical Report summarizes the pertinent technical information available for the Forgold 

Property and includes recommendations for follow-up exploration work.  The Technical Report 

has been prepared under the guidelines of the National Instrument 43-101 Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101") and will be submitted as a 43-101 compliant 

technical report to the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC") and other applicable 

regulators in support of an Initial Public Offering and application to the TSX Venture Exchange 

for listing of the common shares of Azincourt. 

 

ITEM 3:  RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

 

The author has prepared this Technical Report based on information, which is believed to be 

accurate but which is not guaranteed.  The available technical data for the Forgold Property 

consists of regional geological and technical data compiled by the BC Ministry of Energy and 

Mines and documentation regarding field investigations completed within the claim area by 

GoldFields and Ecstall between 1990 and 1991. Sources are listed in the References section of 

this Technical Report and are cited where appropriate in the body of this Technical Report.  The 

reports listed in the References section of this Technical Report appear to have been completed 

by competent professionals without any misleading or promotional intent. The main source of 

regional geological information concerning the Forgold Property area is Bulletin 104 published 

by the British Columbia Geological Survey (BCGS). The author has no reason to doubt the 

accuracy or completeness of the contained information.  

 

To the best of the author's knowledge at the time of writing of this Technical Report, the 

Forgold Property is free of any liens or pending legal actions and is not subject to any royalties, 

back-in rights, payments or other encumbrances other than as disclosed herein.  To the best of 

the author's knowledge, there are no known existing environmental liabilities to which the 

Forgold Property is subject, other than the requirement to mitigate any environmental impact 

on the claims that may arise in the course of normal exploration work and the requirement to 

remove any camps constructed on the Property or any equipment used in exploration of the 

claims in the event that exploration work is terminated.

ITEM 4:  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

 

The Forgold Property is located in the Iskut River District in northwestern British Columbia.  The 

nearest road accessible community is Stewart, B.C. located approximately 200 kilometers to the 

southwest on Highway 37A.  Figure 1 shows the general project location and Figure 2 shows the 

location of the subject claims.  Figure 4 shows the title reference numbers for all mineral claims 

that comprise the Forgold Property.  The Forgold Property comprises an irregular, staircase 

shaped block approximately 18 kilometers long and four kilometers wide that straddles Forrest 

Kerr Creek approximately 20 kilometers north of the Iskut River.  The centre of the Property is at 

approximately UTM Zone 9 (NAD 83) at approximately 400185m East and 6309570m North. The 

Forgold Property consists of a total of twenty-five contiguous mineral claims covering 6,167.15 

hectares in the Liard Mining Division (Table 1- Figure 4). 

 

The Forgold Property is subdivided into three general areas.  The north eastern part of the 

Property straddles a north-east oriented, steep sided ridge with elevations ranging from 1,050 

meters a.s.l. (above sea level) to 1,900 meters a.s.l.  The central part of the Forgold Property 

straddles the north fork of Forrest Kerr Creek with elevations ranging from 880 meters a.s.l. to 

approximately 1,600 meters a.s.l. on the east and west sides of the valley.  The south western 

part of the Property straddles the junction between the main part of Forrest Kerr Creek and the 

north fork of Forrest Kerr Creek and west side of Forrest Kerr Creek valley.  Elevations in the 

southern part of the Property range from 350 meters a.s.l. within the valley to 1,750 meters 

a.s.l. on the ridge overlooking the valley. 

 

The primary target areas are the soil geochemical anomalies identified b Ecstall and Goldfields 

located on the east side of the north fork of Forrest Kerr Creek (also referred to as Nelson Creek) 

in the central part of the Property. 

 

There are no existing access roads and the only way to access the Property is by helicopter from 

the government maintained airstrip at Bob Quin on the Stewart Cassiar Highway (Highway 37) 

approximately 25 kilometers to the east.  Alternatively the Property can be accessed by 

helicopter from Bronson airstrip (air access only) located on the south side of the Iskut River 

approximately 20 kilometers to the southwest. 

 
The author made an online enquiry at the BC Ministry of Mines website with respect to the 

Forgold Property and reviewed the underlying Property Option Agreement on November 14, 

2011.  The Property is in good standing and recorded at the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, 

Mines and Petroleum Resources as set out in Figure 4 of this Technical Report. All of the claims 

are currently in good standing until November 30, 2013.

Terms of the Acquisition by Azincourt Resources Inc. 
 

On June 1, 2011, Azincourt and Carl von Einsiedel entered into the option agreement whereas 

Azincourt was granted an exclusive option to acquire 100% of the legal and beneficial ownership 

of the Forgold Property.  In order to exercise its option to acquire the Forgold Property, 

Azincourt must make staged cash payments totaling $300,000, issue an aggregate of 250,000 

common shares and incur an aggregate of $900,000 in staged exploration expenditures on the 

Property before June 1, 2017.  In addition, upon the exercise of the option the optionor is 

granted a 2-per-cent net smelter return royalty ("NSR") on production from the Forgold 

Property.  Azincourt has the right to purchase up to 1.5% of this NSR for $500,000 in cash for 

each 0.5% of the NSR. 

 
Provincial Mining Regulations 
 
All of the claims comprising the Forgold Property were staked pursuant to the BC Ministry of 

Energy and Mines Mineral Titles online system. Title to the claims is maintained through the 



 

12 
 

performance of annual assessment filings and payment of required fees.  For the first three 

years, a minimum of $4.00 per hectare in eligible exploration expenditures must be incurred.  In 

subsequent years, $8.00 per year in eligible expenditures must be incurred.  

 

To the best of the author's knowledge, no government permits will be required to carry out the 

Stage 1 exploration program.  However, to the best of the author's knowledge government 

permits will be required in order to carry out the proposed Stage 2 exploration program and for 

any follow up diamond drilling program recommended after completion of this program. These 

programs will require an application to the Ministry of Energy and Mines for the permits and 

Azincourt may be required to post security, equivalent to the estimated costs of any reclamation 

work, which may be necessary after completion of the proposed exploration work.  The reader 

is cautioned that there is no guarantee that Azincourt will be able to obtain the permits required 

to carry out the proposed Stage 2 work program.  However, the author is not aware of any 

problems encountered by other junior mining companies in obtaining the permits required to 

carry out similar programs in nearby areas.  

 

To the best of the author's knowledge, approval from local First Nations communities will not be 

required to carry out the Stage 1 exploration program, However, to the best of the author's 

knowledge approval from local First Nations communities may be necessary to carry out the 

proposed Stage 2 exploration program.  The reader is cautioned that there is no guarantee that 

Azincourt will be able to obtain approval from local First Nations. However, the author is not 

aware of any problems encountered by other junior mining companies in obtaining approval to 

carry out similar programs in nearby areas nor is the author aware of any instances where local 

First Nations communities have objected to exploration work in the general project area. 

 

To the best of the author's knowledge, none of the claims comprising the Forgold Property have 

surface rights. In the event that a significant mineralized zone is identified, detailed 

environmental impact studies will need to be completed prior to initiation of any advanced 

exploration or mining activities.  The reader is cautioned that there is no guarantee that areas 

for potential mine waste disposal, heap leach pads, or areas for processing plants will be 

available within the Forgold Property. 

 

ITEM 5:  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, PHYSIOGRAPHY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

 

There are no existing access roads and the only way to access the Property is by helicopter from 

the government maintained airstrip at Bob Quin on the Stewart Cassiar Highway (Highway 37) 

approximately 25 kilometers to the east.  Alternatively the Property can be accessed by 

helicopter from Bronson airstrip (air access only) located on the south side of the Iskut River 

approximately 20 kilometers to the southwest.

The Forgold Property is located in a rugged part of the Coast Mountains. Elevations on the 

property range from about 350 meters at Forrest Kerr Creek to 1,900 meters on ridge tops.  The 

major creek valleys on the property have been glacially scoured, with steep sides.  Timberline is 

at about 1,370 meters. The climate is typical of the Coast Ranges, with heavy precipitation.  The 

winter snow pack builds up to several meters, and the field season for geological work is limited 

to June through early October. 

Crews travelling to and from the site can stay at Bell 2 or at facilities in Bob Quin.  Driving time 

to Bob Quin from Terrace or Smithers is approximately five to six hours.  Experienced field 

personnel and drilling contractors are available in the communities of Terrace and Smithers. 

 

As shown in Figure 4, the Forgold Property comprises an irregular shaped block approximately 

18 kilometers long and four kilometers wide that straddles Forrest Kerr Creek approximately 20 

kilometers north of the Iskut River.   

 

There are abundant water sources within and adjacent to the Forgold Property.  At present 

there are no power sources available at the property however the BC Government has approved 

construction of a power line along Highway 37 (approximately 25 kilometers to the east of the 

Forgold property) and construction of a "run of river" power generating station on the south 

side of the Iskut River (approximately 15 kilometes to the south of the Forgold property).  It may 

be technically feasible at some point in the future to construct a bridge across the Iskut River 

from the existing road access on the south side of river and construct an access road along 

Forrest Kerr Creek however, no engineering studies have been undertaken to determine costs or 

potential environmental impacts.   

 

Although no detailed assessment has been undertaken to determine if there are areas within 

the Property that could be used for tailings and or waste disposal the physiography of the 

central parts of the Forgold Property may be permissible for such uses.  The reader is cautioned 

that there is no guarantee that areas for potential mine waste disposal, heap leach pads, or 

areas for processing plants will be available within the Forgold Property. 

 

The main work area within the Forgold Property is located in a rugged area on the west facing 

slope of the north fork of the Forrest Kerr Creek in the central part of the Forgold Property.  The 

physiography of the Forgold Property is extremely rugged, outcrop is extensive along the ridges 

but the slopes of the creeks within the project area are generally soil or talus covered.  Satellite 

imagery shows that the lower slopes of the creeks are covered with scrub brush and stunted 

spruce with the upper slopes devoid of vegetation except for alpine grasses and flowers.  Due to 

limited access current land use is limited to hunting.

ITEM 6:  HISTORY OF PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 

 

Exploration on the current Forgold Property group dates back to the 1980's.  The current 

Forgold Property covers several historic exploration properties as shown in figure 5.  To simplify 

our summary of previous exploration work the current Forgold Property is subdivided into three 

areas: the Forgold northeast area, the Forgold central area and the Forgold south area.  There is 

1 reported Minfile mineral occurrence (Minfile No.104B-376: Forgold) on the current Forgold 

Property.  The exploration history that has occurred within Forgold north, central and southwest 

is discussed below.  The various historic properties are shown in figure 5. 

  

Forgold Northeast Area  

 

In 1988 the Forgold northeast area was staked as the For Property for Ecstall Mining 

Corporation and Omega Gold Corporation to cover favourable Triassic volcanic rocks and 

Jurassic volcanic and sediment rocks mapped in the area by the Geological Survey of Canada 

(Figure 3). The 1989 exploration program included geologic mapping, reconnaissance stream 

sediment survey (27 silts) and reconnaissance rock sampling (171 rocks).  A number of silt and 

rock sample assay results were encouraging and combined with the reconnaissance mapping 

resulted in Nicholson (1989) to recommend further prospecting and sampling in the areas of 

encouraging assay results.  In 1990 the area was revisited and a detailed mapping and sampling 

project (171 rock; 194 silt; 30 moss mat; 4 soil) corroborated previous (1989) anomalies and 

delineated new target zones. Several samples reportedly returned copper assays with 1-2% 

copper. Copper mineralization was found to be hosted in narrow fractures. Walker & Gal (1990) 

recommended that anomalous values of copper, lead and zinc should be followed up to 

ascertain whether the mineralization is restricted to thin fractures, or if larger mineralized 

bodies are present.  In 1991 an airborne magnetic, electromagnetic and VLF-EM survey flown by 

Kennecott covered the For Property. A total of 425 linear kilometers was flown with 100m line 

spacing. The geophysical survey was never followed up and none of the anomalous base or 

precious metal samples were followed up by detailed soil geochemical surveys that can be used 

to identify larger buried mineralized bodies.    

 

 

The author of this report has been unable to verify the foregoing information and this 

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Forgold Property.

Table 2. Exploration History Forgold Northeast Area 

 
Forgold Central Area 
 

In 1989 the Forgold central area was staked for Ecstall, Omega Gold Corporation and Manridge 

Exploration Limited. Preliminary stream sediment sampling (30 silt and 15 moss mat samples) of 

the west-facing slope of the Nelson Creek valley returned very encouraging concentrations of 

gold, silver and copper, as well as anomalous lead, zinc and mercury values. Both base and 

precious metal mineralization were located apparently related to an extremely leached, sericitic 

alteration zone trending north northwest - south southeast along the west facing valley wall and 

the focus of work was shifted to this area.  

 

In 1990, Santa Marina Mining optioned the claims from Ecstall, Omega Gold Corporation and 

Manridge Exploration Limited. Santa Marina Mining collected 116 rock samples that reportedly 

returned anomalous base and precious metal assays.   The author of this report has been 

unable to verify the foregoing information and this information is not necessarily indicative of 

the mineralization on the Forgold Property. 

 

In 1991, GoldFields optioned the claims from Ecstall. GoldFields collected 244 rock samples and 

1475 soil samples for assay. The soil geochemical survey was successful and identified three 

anomalous zones (Zone A, B and C)  within the leached, sericitic alteration zone along the west 

side of the valley. The rock samples confirmed the presence of widespread copper, lead, zinc, 

silver and gold mineralization.  The locations of the Goldfields soil samples are shown in Figure 7 

and 8.   The database compilation of the Goldfields geochemical data is included as Appendix 1. 

 

Later in 1991, Goldfields carried out a limited drill program completing a total of 935m from 5 

holes in the northern part of the 2,000 meter long soil geochemical anomaly that was defined by 

the soil sample data. The first four drill holes (FG - 1, 2, 3, and 4) were designed to test the 

southern strike extent of the Noranda/High Frontier drill intersection which reportedly 

intersected an 11.6 meter interval that averaged 23.9 g/t gold (The Northern Miner, Sept. 1991).

Two significant zones of gold mineralization were intersected in holes FG-2 and FG-3 (0.113 

oz/ton (3.90 g/t) Au over 1.58m and 0.56 oz/ton (19.20 g/t) Au over 0.82m respectively).  Hole 

FG-5 did not encounter any significant gold mineralization but did intersect two narrow zones of 

copper mineralization (2.97% Cu over 0.31 m and 1.14% C u over 1.16 m respectively).  It is 

important to note that subsequent re-staking of the claims resulted in the boundary between 

the properties being shifted several hundred meters to the south and as a result drill holes FG 1-

4 are actually located immediately north of the current Forgold Property claim boundary.  The 

locations of the historic drill holes are shown in Figure 7 and 8.   

 

The author of this report has been unable to verify the foregoing information and this 

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Forgold Property. 

 

No rigorous statistical analysis of the soil sample results was ever done. The results were 

interpreted by plotting them on plan maps and inspecting them for significant patterns. For each 

element certain values were selected and plotted on the plan as contours to help distinguish 

patterns. Based on the drilling Bond (1992) concluded that the gold mineralization is narrow and 

discontinuous, however, the amount of drilling to date has not tested the highly anomalous 

geochemical signature that extends well over 2 km in a north-south trend and is over 500m 

wide.  

 

The strong geochemical response in the central part of the Forgold Property was the focus of 

the current exploration program.  A total of 281 soil samples were collected across the core 

parts of the main anomaly.  Results of the 2011 geochemical survey have verified the results of 

the 1991 program.  Assay Certificates are included as Appendix 2 and 3.

ITEM 7:  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

 

The Forgold Property lies on the western edge of the Intermontane Tectonic Belt, within Stikine 

Terrane, and is bounded to the east by the Bowser sedimentary basin and the Coast Belt to the 

west. It lies within an important base and precious metal-rich part of Northwestern British 

Columbia, termed the "Golden Horseshoe" (Lefebure, 1991). The Horseshoe extends north from 

Alice Arm to the Taku River, east of the Coast Belt, and wraps back around the northwestern 

edge of the Bowser basin as far east as the Toodoggone River (Figure 2). The Iskut River District 

forms part of northwest B.C.'s Golden Horseshoe and has been a focus for gold and silver 

exploration since the discovery of the Snip and Eskay Creek deposits in the mid 1980's.  

 

The claims adjoin the southern and southeastern boundaries of Kiska's RDN property and 

straddle a package of prospective rock units localized along a complex, north to north east 

trending deformation zone known as the Forest Kerr Fault Zone (FKF Zone).  According to the 

BCGS the rocks on the west side of the fault zone comprise poly-deformed Paleozoic aged 

Stikine Assemblage meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks and the rocks along the east side 

comprise Upper Triassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and Lower to Middle Jurassic Age 

volcanic rocks.  The Lower to Middle Jurassic aged volcanic rocks are correlative with the Eskay 



 

18 
 

Creek Horizon. The Upper Triassic and Lower to Middle Jurassic aged rocks are intruded by Early 

to Middle Jurassic sills, stocks and plugs and are associated with known vein style mineralization 

in the Iskut River District.  Both the RDN property and the Forgold Property straddle a narrow 

belt of Jurassic Age felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks believed to be equivalent to the "Eskay 

Horizon".  Figure 3 shows the geological mapping published by the BCGS. 

 
According to the BCGS, drilling by Noranda and High Frontier on the RDN property in 1991 at a 

prospect known as the "Boundary Zone" (located immediately north of the central part of the 

present Forgold Property) reportedly intersected an 11.6 meter interval that averaged 23.9 g/t 

gold (The Northern Miner, Sept. 1991).  It is important for the reader to note that the technical 

information regarding the mineralization encountered at the adjoining RDN property is 

included solely to demonstrate that the Forgold Property may be prospective for this style of 

mineralization.  

 

The author of this report has been unable to verify the foregoing information and this 

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Forgold Property. 

 

According to Termuende (1990) rock and silt sampling (within the central part of the present 

Forgold Property) traced the highly leached, sericite altered rocks that host the Boundary Zone 

for three kilometers to the south and discovered scattered, vein type base and precious metal 

mineralization.  To assess potential extensions of the Boundary Zone onto the claims comprising 

the present Forgold Property, previous owner Ecstall and GoldFields completed a large soil 

geochemical survey in 1991 consisting of 1,475 samples. According to Ronning (1991) several 

large anomalous areas (referred to as Zone A through C) were defined along the leached, 

sericitic alteration zone and drill testing was recommended. 

 

Malensek et al. (1990) classified the vein mineralization into three types: all of which appear to 

be structurally controlled by the Forest Kerr Fault.  The vein types include: steeply dipping 

chalcopyrite veins containing minor galena and sphalerite, quartz-carbonate stockwork veins 

containing minor galena and sphalerite, and, silicified zones containing chalcopyrite.  All of the 

vein mineralization is reportedly localized within the Triassic aged rocks and the majority of the 

veins trend northeasterly.

ITEM 8:  DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1  Eskay Creek Type exhalative polymetallic deposits 
 
Eskay Creek type deposits are examples of shallow, subaqueous hot spring depoists which is 

transitional between sub-aerial hot spring gold-silver deposits and deeper water, volcanogeneic 

massive sulfide exhalites like Kuroko or Besshi type occurrences.  Mineralization consists of 

polymetallic, exhalative type and discordant vein type sulphides and sulfosalts with high 

precious metal contents. 

   

According to Savell and Grill (1991) alteration and mineralization discovered to date on the 

adjoining RDN Property appears to represent an exposed root system of a volcanic center active 

in the Early Jurassic.  In addition to the potential for vein type mineralization Savell and Grill 

(1991) suggest the Middle Jurassic rocks to the east and south (ie. on the current Forgold 

Property) may have potential to host exhalative deposits (i.e. Eskay-type).  The adjoining RDN 

Property has been the focus of extensive exploration work, primarily for Eskay Creek type 

exhalative deposits, which is summarized in the adjoining property section of this report.   

 
8.2  Snip Type gold  deposits 
 

Mineralization in structurally controlled Au and polymetallic veins is epigenetic and is formed by 

structurally focused hydrothermal fluids. These types of deposits are normally associated with 

regional faults, fault sets and fractures; however, veins are typically associated with second 

order structures. Veins typically occur in the central parts of discrete shear zones within a larger 

regional fault, where the rotational or simple shear strains predominate. Vein systems are 

tabular, sub vertical structures of varying thickness and lateral extent.  
 
8.3  Alkalic and calc-alkaline porphyry copper-gold deposits  

 

Alkalic and calc-alkaline porphyry copper-gold deposits occur throughout the length of the 

Intermontane Belt in both Stikinia (Golden Horseshoe) and Quesnellia (north-western and 

central B.C.). These deposits occur either within Triassic aged intrusive rocks or in volcanic and 

sedimentary rocks associated with the intrusive bodies.  These types of deposits are common in 

the Iskut River District, comprising over 25% of the reported mineral occurrences.  These types 

of deposits tend to occupy brecciated and faulted zones related to extensively altered 

subvolcanic intrusions and their volcanic host rocks. Alteration patterns for alkalic type porphyry 

deposits are distinctly different from those of classic calcalkaline deposits, which are 

characterized by concentric phyllic-argillic-propylitic zones.  The alkalic deposits typically have a 

central potassic or sodic plagioclase zone, which passes outward into a propylitic zone. These 

often overlap and are overprinted by retrograde metasomatic alteration.  Disseminated pyrite 

and minor copper mineralization mantle the propylitic alteration zone.

ITEM 9:  EXPLORATION  

 

Between August 15 and September 30, 2011 consultants for Azincourt reviewed available 

technical data for the Forgold Property, constructed a detailed digital elevation models to 

support ongoing fieldwork, compiled all historic geochemical sampling for the central part of the 

Forgold property into a digital database and completed a systematic sampling program designed 

to confirm the gold and copper anomalies reported by Ecstall and Goldfields (1991).  

 

The sampling program was conducted using conventional soil augers and trenching tools.  

Sampling was completed along irregular elevation contour lines that crossed the high gold and 

copper in soil samples reported by Ecstall and Goldfields.   Samples were collected from 

immature soil profiles at depths of between 0.2 and 0.5 meters. The location of each sample 

was noted, in UTM coordinates (NAD 83 Zone 11), with the aid of a hand-held GPS (Garmin 

60Cx; accuracy ±5m).  A total of 281 samples were collected at 25 to 50 meter spacing over an 

area of approximately 1,250 meters by 500 meters.   

 

The results of the 2011 field program have confirmed the presence of strongly anomalous gold 

and copper values in soils in the areas of interest identified by Ecstall and Gold Fields and have 

defined an anomalous zone of approximately 400 meters in width and 750 meters in length.  

Anomalous gold values ranged from several tens of ppb to a high of 334 ppb (0.334 g/t) and 

included 23 samples above an arbitrary, strongly anomalous cut-off of 100 ppb (0.100 g/t).  

Copper analyses returned values ranging from 100 ppm to a high of 694 ppm.      

 

Field crews were mobilized from Vancouver to the government maintained airstrip at Bob Quin 

on Highway 37.  Accommodation for field personnel and all required vehicles was provided by 

contractor Ram Explorations Ltd.  Auxiliary personnel were provided by CJL Enterprises Ltd. of 

Smithers, B.C.   Access to the Property was by helicopter from the government maintained 

airstrip at Bob Quin, provided by Lakelse Air Ltd., based in Terrace, B.C.   All sample analyses 

were carried out by ALS Chemex, based in North Vancouver, B.C. 

 

The locations of the historic geochemical samples collected by Ecstall and Goldfields as well as 

the samples collected in 2011 are shown in Figure 7 and 8.  Figure 7 presents geochemical assay 

data for gold.  Figure 8 presents geochemical assay data for copper.  The base maps are 1:5,000 

scale topographic maps based on the 5m contour maps prepared by Dudley Thompson Mapping 

during the current program.  Assay certificates for the current program are included as Appendix 

2 and Appendix 3. 

 
 
ITEM 10:  DRILLING  
 

No diamond drilling was carried out by Azincourt on the Forgold Property.  According to 

published technical reports, Ecstall and Goldfields drilled five holes in 1992 in the north central 



 

21 
 

part of the present claim area.  Results are discussed in the History section of this Technical 

Report.  As part of the 2011 program field crews salvaged some of the drill core (approximately 

26.6 meters) from the 1992 program for petrographic confirmation of the rock units reported by 

Ecstall and Goldfields. 
 

 

ITEM 11:  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY  

 

The soil samples collected as part of the 2011 exploration program were collected from an area 

of interest identified by Ecstall and Goldfields in 1991. The 2011 soil survey was conducted using 

conventional soil augers and trenching tools.  Sampling was completed along irregular traverse 

lines that crossed the vicinity of the high gold in soil samples reported by Noranda.  Samples 

were collected from immature soil profiles at depths of between 0.2 and 0.5 meters. 

 

All samples from the 2011 program were delivered to the ALS Chemex (ISO 9001:2000 Certified 

laboratory)  facility in North Vancouver, B.C.  All samples were analyzed by conventional ICP-AES 

analysis for gold and a suite of 40 elements, which is typical for these types of exploration 

programs.  The author personally supervised the delivery of soil samples collected in 2011 from 

the Forgold Property to the ALS Chemex facility in North Vancouver B.C.   

 

The -80 micrometer mesh sieved fraction of the soil samples was dissolved in an aqua regia 

solution (3:1 mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid) and analyzed for the series of elements 

listed in the ALS Chemex assay reports.  The elements analyzed for and the detection limits are 

listed in the assay reports.  ALS Chemex employs standard QA and QC protocols on all sample 

analyses including inserting one blank, reference standard and duplicate analysis in every 

twenty samples analyzed.  No additional QA and QC procedures were implemented as part of 

the program.  Sample Certificates from the 2011 exploration program are included in Appendix 

2 and 3.  In the author's opinion, the sample security employed by the field personnel involved 

in the sample collection and the sample preparation and analytical procedures employed by ALS 

Chemex are adequate for the exploration program carried out by Azincourt on the Forgold 

Property.  

 
 
ITEM 12:  DATA VERIFICATION 
         

As noted, the main areas of interest within the Forgold Property are soil geochemical anomalies 

located on the east side of the north fork of Forrest Kerr Creek (also referred to as Nelson Creek) 

in the central part of the Forgold Property.  The original work was carried out by Goldfields and 

Ecstall in 1990.  All samples from the 1991 program were sent to MIN-EN Laboratories facility in 

North Vancouver. 
 



 

22 
 

Min-En's descriptions of its procedures as provided in ARIS 21868 were as follows:  Samples are 

processed by Min-En Laboratories, at 705 West 15th Street, North Vancouver, employing the 

following procedures.  After drying the samples at 95 C, soil and stream sediment samples are 

screened by 80 mesh sieve to obtain the minus 80 mesh fraction for analysis.  The rock samples 

are crushed by a jaw crusher and pulverized on a ring mill pulverizer.  Fifteen grams of sample is 

weighed into porcelain crucibles and cindered @ 800C for 3 hours. Samples are then transferred 

to beakers and digested using aqua regia, diluted to volume and mixed.  Further oxidation and 

treatment of 75% of the above solution is then extracted for gold by Methyl Iso-butyl Ketone.  

These MIBK solutions are analyzed on an atomic absorption spectrometer using a suitable 

standard set.   

 

Verification sampling to confirm historic gold and copper in soil anomalies identified by Ecstall 

and Goldfields  (Aris Report 21868) was the main priority of the current sampling program. The 

results of the samples collected by Azincourt are consistent with results reported by Ecstall and 

Goldfields and MIN-EN Laboratories in 1991.  

  
 
ITEM 13:  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
No mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been carried out on samples from the Forgold 
Property. 
 
 
ITEM 14:  MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
 
No defined body of potentially commercial mineralization has been identified to date on the 
Forgold Property and therefore no resource or mineral reserve estimate has been completed. 
 
 
ITEM 15 -22: ADVANCED PROPERTY DISCLOSURE   
 
(NOT REQUIRED) 
 
 
ITEM 23:  ADJACENT PROPERTIES  
 

The Forgold Property adjoins the southern and southeastern boundaries of Kiska's RDN property 

and straddles a package of prospective rock units localized along a complex, north to north east 

trending deformation zone known as the Forest Kerr Fault Zone (FKF Zone).  According to the 

BCGS the rocks on the west side of the fault zone comprise poly-deformed Paleozoic aged 

Stikine Assemblage meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks and the rocks along the east side 

comprise Upper Triassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and Lower to Middle Jurassic Age 

volcanic rocks.  The Lower to Middle Jurassic aged volcanic rocks are correlative with the Eskay 



 

23 
 

Creek Horizon. The Upper Triassic and Lower to Middle Jurassic aged rocks are intruded by Early 

to Middle Jurassic sills, stocks and plugs and are associated with known vein style mineralization 

in the Iskut River District. 

  

According to the BCGS drilling by Noranda and High Frontier on the RDN property in 1991 at a 

prospect known as the "Boundary Zone" (located immediately north of the central part of the 

present Forgold Property) reportedly intersected an 11.6 meter interval that averaged 23.9 g/t 

gold (The Northern Miner, Sept. 1991).  The adjoining RDN property has been the focus of 

extensive exploration work primarily for Eskay Creek type exhalative deposits.  Figure 3A shows 

a compilation of the target areas that have been identified on the RDN property. 
 
 
The author of this report has been unable to verify the foregoing information and this 

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Forgold Property. 

 
 
ITEM 24:  OTHER RELEVENT DATA AND INFORMATION  
 
There is no other relevant data or information available for the Forgold Property.  There is no 

additional information or explanation necessary to make the technical report understandable 

and not misleading. 

 
 

ITEM 25:  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS       
 
According to Savell and Grill (1991) alteration and mineralization discovered to date on the Kiska 

Metals adjoining RDN property appears to represent an exposed root system of a volcanic 

centre active in the Early Jurassic.  In addition to the potential for vein type mineralization Savell 

and Grill (1991) suggest the Middle Jurassic rocks to the east and south (ie. on the current 

Forgold Property) may have potential to host exhalative deposits (i.e. Eskay-type).  The RDN 

property has been the focus of extensive exploration work, primarily for Eskay Creek type 

exhalative deposits, which is summarized in the adjoining property section of this report.  

Considering recent increases in precious metal prices the Forgold Property is considered a 

property of merit that warrants additional exploration. 

  

During August and September of 2011 Azincourt consultants compiled the technical data 

generated by previous owners of the present Forgold Property into a GIS database, constructed 

detailed digital elevation models of the property to support ongoing field work, made several 

site visits to the Property and carried out a systematic geochemical survey (281 samples) to 

verify the results of the 1991 survey completed by Ecstall and Goldfields.   Sampling was 

completed along irregular elevation contour lines that crossed the anomalous zones reported by 



 

24 
 

Ecstall and Goldfields. 

 

The results of the geochemical survey completed by Azincourt have confirmed the extensive 

gold, and base metal anomalies reported by Ecstall and Goldfields.  Gold values ranged from 

trace levels to a high of 0.334 g/t gold and reported copper values were up to 694 ppm.  Large 

areas of the central part of the Forgold Property exhibit elevated precious and base metal values 

in soils and do not appear to have been tested by the limited drill program completed in 1992. 

  

In addition to the target area identified in the central part of the Forgold Property a preliminary 

review of the historic exploration work completed within the northern eastern and south 

western parts of the Forgold Property indicates that there are multiple stream, soil, float and 

rock samples that exhibit elevated gold, silver, base metal and/or pathfinder elements 

anomalies that have not been followed up. 

 



 

25 
 

ITEM 26: RECOMMENDATIONS  
 

It is recommended that the next stage of exploration work (Stage 1) at the Forgold Property 

consist of additional detailed soil sampling in the central part of the property and additional 

reconnaissance work to assess the target areas identified in northeastern and southwestern 

parts of the Property.  The total estimated cost of the proposed Stage 1 program is $275,000.  In 

the event that significant drill targets are identified a follow up program of preliminary drill 

testing (Stage 2) would be warranted at a cost of $440,000.
