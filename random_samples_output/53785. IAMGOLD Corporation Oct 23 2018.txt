1.0 SUMMARY 

The Boto Project (the Project) is located in the southeast corner of Senegal within the Daorala-Boto Exploration 
Permit.  The exploration permit is made up of two non-contiguous properties, i.e. the Boto property (the 
Property) and the Daorala property to which no mention is made in this report.   

IAMGOLD is an intermediate gold producer with four operating gold mines and several exploration projects 
located in North and South America, and Africa. AGEM Senegal SUARL Exploration (AGEM), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of IAMGOLD, controls the Property. 

In 2017, IAMGOLD engaged several leading consulting firms to undertake a Feasibility Study (FS) for the Project. 
The principal contributors are listed in Table 1.1.

1.1 Property Location and Description 

The Daorala-Boto Project is located in the Kédougou Region (Saraya Department) in the southeast of Senegal 
and is situated along the triple border junction of Senegal-Mali-Guinee, bounded by the Balinko and Falémé 
Rivers.  AGEM holds the mineral rights to two exploration permits consisting of the Daorala-Boto and Boto West 
projects. The Daorala-Boto exploration permit covers a total area of 236 km². 

The Daorala-Boto exploration permit consists of two non-contiguous areas, the Daorala and the Boto, along the 
southeast border with Mali.  These two areas are separated by the Bamabji exploration permit, situated 
between these two areas, and is also held by AGEM which is part of an agreement with Randgold Resources Ltd. 
(Randgold), who is the operator on the permit.   

The exploration permit for the Daorala-Boto permit was renewed on 8 August, 2017, by the Senegalese 
government, and has an expiry date of 4 March 2019.  

1.2 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiology 

Access to the Project from Dakar is either by paved road from the capital, Dakar, to the town of Saraya 
(approximately 760 km by road) and then by gravel/laterite road to the village of Noumoufoukha

(approximately 80 km).  The Boto exploration camp is situated 12 km from the village of Guémédji.  There are 
no regular scheduled flights to Kédougou, situated 135 km by road from the Project, but there are aircraft that 
are available for charter from Dakar. 

The Project is located in a subtropical continental climate zone and is characterized by two seasons: a rainy 
(wet) season from June to October, and a dry season from October to May.  Exploration activities may be 
conducted all year round.  However, during the wet season, the Kolia Kabe River, situated 14 km by road to the 
northwest of Boto Exploration Camp, floods and cuts off the road access at the Saroudia Bridge.  

There is minimal infrastructure at the Project site.  Electricity is provided by diesel generators at the Exploration 
Camp.  Water is supplied by a well with a water treatment plant.  There is some cellular telephone coverage 
which is supplied to this area of Senegal, and the Project, by Senegal-based cellular towers and by cellular 
towers in neighbouring Mali.  All equipment, supplies, and fuel are transported by road to the project site. Most 
supplies, consumables, and fuel are sourced either from Kédougou or Dakar depending on availability.  The 
village of Guémédji, and some surrounding villages, are a source of unskilled workers and fresh produce.  Skilled 
and professional workers are sourced from Dakar. 

The Property lies between 100 m and 300 m above sea level with generally low to moderate relief consisting of 
broad lateritic plateaus and eroded valleys.  The vegetation is typical of a tropical forested savannah, with 
scattered trees (including baobab), scrub brush, elephant grass, and bamboo.  Trees are more abundant along 
rivers and creeks as gallery forests and around lateritic plateaus that have been broken down by erosion.   

1.3 History 

Prior to 1994, there is no known or recorded systematic mineral exploration carried on the Property. From 1994 
to 1996, the first exploration activities were carried out by Anmercosa Exploration (Anmercosa), a subsidiary of 
Anglo American.  From 1997 to 1998, Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (Ashanti Goldfields), completed further 
exploration activities in a joint venture with AGEM.  From 1999 to present, AGEM has conducted all succeeding 
exploration activities on the Property.  

1.4 Geology and Mineralization 

The Project is located in the West African Craton, in the south-eastern part of the Early Proterozoic formation of 
the Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier, which covers the eastern part of Senegal and western Mali.  In the southern part 
of the craton, Lower Proterozoic Greenstone Lands are described as Birimian based on the Kits (1928) in the 
Birim River Valley of Ghana.  The Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier, where the Project is located, is the exposure in the 
far west of the Birimian. The Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier is bounded on the west side by the Hercynian 
Mauritanide belt; and on all other sides, it is unconformably overlain by the underformed upper Proterozoic 
sediments and the Early Phanerozoic rock of the Taoudeni, Tindouf, and Volta basins 

At Boto, the material near the surface consists of a layer of regolith which is varying in thickness and includes 
lateritic plateaus.  Few rocky outcroppings are visible in the property; the banks of streams and rivers serve as 
the main source for geological observations. Only drilling can provide a detailed knowledge of the geology 
below surface.  Boto can be divided into three north trending litho-structural domains (020˚ N) that are well

delineated in both induced polarization (IP) and magnetic surveys. From west to east, the three domains are: 
Western Flyschoid Domain, Central Deformation Corridor, and the Eastern Siliciclastic Domain. 

The western domain is dominated by a sequence of flyschoid turbidites, black shales (or graphitic pelite), 
carbonate rocks, minor volcanics (mainly basalt with subordinate rhyolite and pyroclastic breccia or 
agglomerate), and dioritic intrusions. The Boto 5 deposit is located along the contact between this domain and 
the central deformation corridor. 

The eastern domain is dominated by a detrital assemblage composed of greywacke and sandstone (+ quartzite), 
called Guémédji sandstone. It is thought that these sandstones/wackes are part of the Kofi Series which is very 
present in the Malian portion of the inlier. 

Between the west and east domains is a highly deformed north-trending domain (020˚ N) that is well defined in 
magnetic geophysical data. It is likely this highly deformed domain corresponds to a regional scale structural 
corridor that branches from the SMSZ. Lithologically, it is composed of fine schistose sediments that are 
carbonaceous in places, locally referred to as the "Pelite Unit", and fine laminated sediments (+ carbonates) 
that subtly grade into an impure marble, locally called the "Cipolin Unit". 

The Project consists of four (4) deposits, Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, Boto 4 and Boto 6, all of the late orogenic 
type. The late orogenic gold mineralization is typically associated with brittle-ductile deformation and is 
characterized by the association of Au, B, W, As, Sb, Se, Te, Bi, Mo, with traces of Cu, Pb, Zn.  Mineralization at 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4 and Boto 6 is associated mainly with chlorite-albite alteration.  Gold commonly 
occurs as native gold or as fine inclusions within the base-metal sulphides or the gangue that consists of quartz, 
albite, carbonate, muscovite, pyrite, and tourmaline.  Mineralization at Boto 5 is associated with a phase or 
quartz tourmaline veining as well as pyrite and related bleaching.  The mineralizing event was accompanied by 
biotite alteration and pyrite mineralization, and a small proportion of chalcopyrite, covellite, and chalcocite. The 
presence of arsenopyrite appears to be confirmed by recent XRF measurements. 

1.5 Exploration and Drilling 

The Project has been subject to exploration and development by AGEM since 1999 to present.  Early exploration 
consisted of geochemical soil, lag, rock and termite mound sampling; pit and trench sampling; geophysical 
surveys; and drilling.  Exploration to date has defined the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, Boto 6 and Boto 4 
deposits.  Additional exploration activities around the known deposit have resulted in several other targets for 
further exploration.    

Drilling at the Project has been conducted in various campaigns from 2000 to present.  As of March 2018, a total 
of 126,429 m have been completed from 784 drill holes.  Of the 784 drill holes in the drill hole database, 496 
drillholes intercept the interpreted mineralized zones in Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, Boto 6, and Boto 4 
deposits.

1.6 Metallurgy 

Extensive metallurgical testwork on the Boto ore deposit has been conducted from 2013 to 2018.  The testwork 
results were analyzed and used in flowsheet development and inputs into the process design criteria.  

The comminution parameters determined based on lithology weighted average per weathering type are as 
follows: 

• 85th percentile BWi of 10.8 kWh/t, 11.2 kWh/t, and 20.6 kWh/t for saprolite, saprock, and fresh rock, 
respectively. 

• 85th percentile CWi of 16.4 kWh/t for the fresh rock. 

• 50th percentile Ai of 0.033 g, 0.043 g, and 0.542 g for saprolite, saprock and fresh rock, respectively. 

The Boto fresh rock is classified as hard ore while the Boto saprolite and saprock are classified as softer ore 
when compared to the A.R. MacPherson Grinding Specialist database. 

Other key results from the metallurgical testwork include: 

• Gold extraction increased with decreasing grind size, however, a grind size of 80% passing (P80) of 75 
µm was determined to be optimum for the Project. 

• Preg-robbing assessment on the Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 5 samples showed no evidence of preg-
robbing activity. 

• Gravity separation tests (E-GRG tests), and whole ore leach tests showed limited benefits from 
inclusion of a gravity circuit in the flowsheet. The majority of the GRG amount found in MC-2 of the 
2018 testwork was very fine in nature; hence, recovery with gravity at full scale would be difficult. 

• Synergistic effects from lead nitrate and oxygen addition during pre-treatment, and oxygen addition 
during leaching provided faster leach kinetics, significant reduction in cyanide consumption, and gold 
extraction benefits. 

• Cyanide consumption was low with a consumption rate of 0.13 kg/t ore expected at the design ore 
blend (approximately, 90% fresh rock, 10% saprolite/saprock). 

• Lime consumption was moderate with a consumption rate of 1.64 kg/t ore expected at the design ore 
blend. 

1.7 Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources for the Project were updated for this report.  The mineral resources were prepared and 
disclosed in accordance with the CIM Standards and Definitions for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves

(2014).  The QP responsible for these resource estimates is Mr. Paul Daigle, P.Geo., Associate Senior Geologist 
for AGP.  The effective date of this mineral resource is May 8, 2018.   

The resource estimate has been prepared using interpreted mineralized veins (domains) for four deposits that 
comprise the Project; in order of priority: Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, Boto 6, and Boto 4.  The resource 
estimates were conducted using Geovia GEMS™ 6.8.1 resource estimation software.  The blocks models were 
estimated using inverse distance cubed. 

Table 1.2 presents a summary of the Mineral Resources for the Project.

Notes:  
• Mineral resources are reported within an optimized constraining shells using MineSight 3D software. 
• Summation errors may occur due to rounding. 
• Cut-off grades vary between 0.37 g/t Au and 0.51 g/t Au, depending on the deposit and the alteration type of material. 
• Mineral resources were estimated based on a gold price of $US 1,500/ oz. 
• Capping of grades varied between 1.71 g/t Au and 42.02 g/t Au on raw assays by mineralized zone or sub-domain. 
• The density varies between 1.70 g/cm3 and 2.76 g/cm3 depending on alteration zone. 

The mineral resources for the Project include the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, and Boto 6 deposits.  The Boto 4 
deposit is currently not classified as mineral resources because the deposit is situated within a 500 m exclusion 
zone of the Balinko River (the border of Senegal and Mali) and underneath the village of Guémédji.  Mineral 
Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

1.8 Mineral Reserves 

The reserves for the Project are based on the conversion of the Indicated resources within the current Technical 
Report mine plan.  No Measured resources are currently part of the model.  Indicated resources are converted 
directly to Probable Reserves.  The total reserves for the Project are shown in Table 1.3.

Note: This mineral reserve estimate is as of Aug 30, 2018 and is based on the new mineral resource estimate dated May 8, 2018 for 

Malikoundi and Boto 5 by AGP. The mineral reserve calculation was completed under the supervision of Gordon Zurowski, P.Eng of AGP., 

who is a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101.  Mineral reserves are stated within the final design pit based on a $1,044/oz gold price 

pit shell with a $1,200/oz gold price for revenue for Malikoundi, $960/oz for Malikoundi North and $900/ounce for Boto 5.  The cut-off grade 

varied by material type from 0.46 g/t Au in saprolite, 0.50 g/t Au in transition and 0.63 g/t Au in fresh rock for the Malikoundi and 

Malikoundi North pit areas.  The cut-off was 0.48 g/t Au in saprolite, 0.49 g/t Au in transition and 0.59 g/t in fresh rock for the Boto 5 area.  

The mining cost varied by rock type and area but averaged $2.13/t, processing costs vary by rock type but averaged $15.04/t milled and 

G&A was $4.22/t milled.  The process recovery averaged 89.5%.  The Technical Report scope only considers the Malikoundi, Malikoundi 

North and Boto 5 open pit mineralized zones. 

The reserves are based solely on the Malikoundi, Malikoundi North and Boto 5 areas.   

The QP has not identified any known legal, political, environmental, or other risks that would materially affect 
the potential development of the Mineral Reserves.  The risk of not being able to secure the necessary permits 
from the government for development and operation of the project exist but the QP is not aware of any issues 
that would prevent those permits from being withheld per the normal permitting process. 

1.9 Mining Methods 

The Project is amenable to extraction by open pit methods. Costs were developed from base principles and with 
current equipment quotations from local vendors. 

All design work is based on the Malikoundi and Boto 5 models generated by AGP with an effective date of May 
8, 2018.  Only Indicated Resources were used for the FS and all inferred resources are considered as waste.  No 
measured resources exist in the current models. 

A geotechnical study was completed on the Malikoundi and Boto 5 deposits by AG.  The study provided detailed 
slope recommendations by alteration zone, material type and orientation.  These recommendations were 
incorporated in the pit optimizations completed for the FS with allowances made for ramps in the slopes to 
determine an overall angle to use.  The recommendations were also incorporated in the detailed mine design. 

Pit optimizations utilizing the Lerch-Grossman routine were examined for Malikoundi, Malikoundi North and 
Boto 5.  A base price of $1,200/oz was used.  A series of nested shells were generated using a revenue factor 
(rf). These were varied between a gold price of $300/oz (rf=0.25) and $1,440/oz (rf=1.2) to examine the deposit

sensitivity to gold prices and outline the higher value areas. This information was graphed, and the various 
phases and final shell determined based on a net revenue curve.  The final pits are based on the $1,044/oz gold 
price shell for Malikoundi, $960/oz gold price shell for Malikoundi North and $900/oz shell for Boto 5. 

The geologic models used for the FS are whole block fully diluted models. Contact dilution was also believed to 
be a consideration and was estimated based on 0.5 m per block side if the material was below cutoff grade.  The 
calculation for dilution for the Malikoundi pits resulted in 4.5% more tonnes and 4.1% lower gold grade than 
insitu.  Boto 5 had slightly higher dilution results of 7.8% more tonnes and 6.7% lower gold grade than insitu.  
The diluted tonnes and grade were reported in the detailed pit designs. 

The detailed pit design utilized the pit shells developed to provide guidance on the phasing and final pit.  Wall 
slopes for the inter-ramp were per the geotechnical recommendations.   

Equipment sizing for ramps and working benches is based on the use of 95 t rigid frame haul trucks.  The 
operating width used for the truck is 6.9 m meaning single lane access is 21.4 m (2x operating width plus berm 
and ditch) and double lane widths are 28.3 m (3x operating width plus berm and ditch).  Ramp gradients are 
10% in the pit for uphill gradients and 8% uphill on the dump access roads. 

The Malikoundi pit is designed as 4 phases within the main pit.  Phase 0, as the initial pit is called, is a subset of 
Phase 1 to drive quickly to fresh rock for tailings dam construction purposes.  Malikoundi North is a single-phase 
pit as is Boto 5.   

The mine schedule delivers 35.1 Mt of ore grading 1.71 g/t Au to the process plant over a mine life of 12.8 
years.  Waste tonnage totalling 204.3 Mt will be placed into waste rock management facilities.  The overall strip 
ratio is 5.83:1 life of mine.  The Malikoundi cut-offs used are 0.46 g/t Au for saprolite, 0.50 g/t Au for transition 
material, and 0.63 g/t for fresh rock.  In Boto 5 the calculated cut-offs are 0.48 g/t Au in saprolite, 0.49 g/t Au 
for transition material and 0.59 g/t Au for fresh rock.   1 g/t Au cut-off was used for all materials to separate low 
grade material and high-grade material.   

The current mine life includes two years of pre-stripping and 12.8 years of mining.  Plant throughput is 2.75 
Mtpa. The final year will complete the pit and clear the stockpiled ore.  The stockpiled ore, together with pit 
phasing will be utilized to ensure enough mill feed is available in the rainy season.  This will also be coupled with 
in-pit sumps and surface ditches around the pits.  Phases will be advanced quickly in the dry season to develop 
low spots that will provide temporary water storage after a rainfall event that pumping will remove in the wet 
season. 

Laterite and saprolite overlay a zone of transition which in turn is underlain by fresh rock.  Laterite for 
Malikoundi and Boto 5 is typically comprised of 3-5 m of ferricrete with another 3-5 m of agglomerate.  
Malikoundi material mined is primarily fresh rock while the Boto 5 pit only mines the saprolite and transition 
material.  No blasting is required in Boto 5 and the laterite and saprolite in Malikoundi require minimal blasting 
as this material will be used for construction purposes.

Ore control for mining is designed using a reverse circulation drilling program in advance of mining.  Ore 
samples will be collected each metre in the drill hole and used in the ore control model to guide mine planning 
and operations.  

The mine schedule is based on mining the four phases in Malikoundi, the single phase in Malikoundi North and 
the single phase in Boto 5.  Boto 5 has been designed as a contract mining pit that utilizes a maximum truck size 
of 40 t with no drilling and blasting. 

Mining commences in Year -2 which is a three-month period and continues in Year -1 which is a full 12-month 
period.  This pre-production stripping is required to assist in the construction of various infrastructure items and 
prepare sufficient material in stockpile prior to mill commissioning.  The infrastructure items include mine roads 
to the tailings management facility (TMF), fresh water pond (FWP), process plant, various waste management 
facilities and the TMF itself. 

A total of 2.3 Mt of material will be moved in Year -2 and an additional 13.7 Mt moved in Year -1.  This includes 
the development of a 2.2 Mt ore stockpile grading 2.25 g/t Au.  Malikoundi Phase 0 and Phase 1 will be the only 
active phases in the preproduction period.  Phase 0 provides fresh rock for construction needs. 

Year 1 production assumes that the plant will require 3 months to achieve full production levels.  The first 
month the plant will be capable of 60% of capacity, the second month 80% and the third month 90%.  
Subsequent months will be at 100% of nameplate capacity in the mill.  Ore mining will be from stockpile, Boto 5 
and Malikoundi Phase 0, 1 and 2.  Mining will be initiated in Malikoundi Phase 2, Malikoundi North and Boto 5. 

Mining occurs from Year -1 until part way through Year 12.  The remainder of Year 12 and Year 13 is stockpile 
reclaim to feed the mill.  Peak mining requirements are in Year 2 with Phase 3 initiating.  This peak is 33.4 Mt of 
total material movement.  Years 3 to 6 average 28 Mt of total material movement then the mine production 
starts to drop off steadily before finishing in Year 12.  The saprolite feed to the mill is held to 10% of mill feed 
from Year 1 to 10 then only the remainder of the saprolite stockpile is mined in Year 11.   

Mining in Boto 5 occurs from Year 1 to 3.  Malikoundi North is mined from Year 1 until Year 5.  Malikoundi is 
mined continuously throughout the Project.  

The life of mine (LOM) schedule by year is shown in Table 1.4.

Various rock types are present in the material mined within the final pits.  They include the weathering profile 
of laterite, saprolite, transition and hard rock.  The percentages vary by pit and phase.  Ferricrete is present in 
some areas and will be utilized for construction material and roads.  All material types will be co-mingled in the 
waste management facilities.  Certain portions of the material will be directed to the TMF for the embankment 
construction.  In addition, there will be four waste storage areas.  These are shown in Figure 1.2.  

The waste dump northwest (WDNW) of the plant has a design capacity of 40.8 Mm3 but only 36.5 Mm3 is 
utilized.  The waste dump northeast (WDNE) of the plant has a design capacity of 53.8 Mm3 which is fully 
utilized.  The FWP requires 1.3 Mm3 from the mine for construction.  The Boto 5 facility is designed at 9 Mm3 
and is fully utilized. 

Drainage from each of these facilities is diverted to sedimentation ponds to ensure sediment washed down 
from the facilities is captured before it leaves the mine property.  Annual cleaning of the sediment ponds or 
more frequently if required is planned to ensure that storage capacity is not lost.

1.10 Recovery Methods 

The process plant design for the Project is based on extensive metallurgical testing, Lycopodium's experience 
and industry standards. The flowsheet configuration and unit operations are well proven in the gold processing 
industry.  

The plant has been designed with a nominal throughput of 2.75 Mtpa ore, crushing circuit availability of 75% 
and a mill utilization of 92%. The plant design incorporates the following unit process operations: 

• Single stage primary crushing with a jaw crusher to produce a crushed product size of P80 of 138 mm. 

• Mill feed surge/overflow bin that overflows to a stockpile.   

• The grinding circuit is a single stage semi-autogenous mill (SSAG) type, which consists of a closed 
circuit single stage semi-autogenous (SAG) mill, producing a P80 grind size of 75 µm. 

• Hydrocyclones are operated to achieve an overflow slurry density of 28.1% w/w solids to promote 
better particle size separation efficiency.  The overflow stream passes through a trash screen to 
remove foreign materials prior to downstream processing.  Subsequently, a pre-leach thickener is 
included to increase slurry density to the leach circuit, minimize leach tank volume requirements and 
reduce overall reagent consumption. 

• Leach circuit with five tanks to achieve the required 34.4 hours of residence time at nominal plant 
throughput.  A pre-oxidation step is included ahead of leaching to minimize cyanide consumption and 
improve downstream leach kinetics. 

• Carbon-in-pulp (CIP) carousel circuit consisting of six stages for recovery of gold dissolved in the 
leaching circuit. 

• Pressure Zadra elution circuit with gold recovery to doré.  The circuit includes an acid wash column to 
remove inorganic foulants from the carbon with hydrochloric acid, followed by an elution column. 

• Carbon regeneration kiln to remove organic foulants from the carbon and reactivate the adsorption 
sites on the activated carbon with heat. 

Figure 1.1 shows an overall flow diagram of the Process Plant.

1.12 Environmental Studies, Permitting, Social and Community Impact 

A summary analysis of the initial environmental and social status of the exploration permit was carried out in 
2014 by TROPICA Environmental Consultants and was completed during the preliminary study by field 
investigations. 

In order to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements as well as the World Bank Group Guidelines, an 
environmental and social impact study process was launched in June 2015 and was completed in 2018. 

To properly understand the project's human, physical and biological context, baseline environmental studies on 
social sanitation conditions, public health, fauna, flora and biodiversity, surface water and ground water quality, 
the water regime, and the cultural heritage were advanced in 2015, in the first half of 2016, and completed in 
the second half of 2017. Tailings and waste geochemical characterization studies were also conducted during 
these periods. 

The upstream public consultation process took place in 2016, and a public inquiry was made in May and June 
2016, at the request of the Kédougou region Governor. 

The complete Environmental and Social Impact Study (ESIA) report, including the ESMP and the closure and 
reclamation framework, were submitted to the authorities in 2016, on the basis of the project as developed as 
part of the original prefeasibility study. At the request of IAMGOLD, the impact study validation procedure was 
suspended due to the continuation of technical studies. 

Following the publication of the optimized prefeasibility study and the launch of the feasibility study, the ESIA 
report was updated with new data at the end of the first half of 2018 and submitted to the Ministry of 
Environment for instruction and validation. The report was reviewed in April 2018 by the technical committee, 
representing all key and administrative stakeholders, and additional information was requested. The amended 
report taking into consideration this feedback was submitted to the Ministry of Environment in May 2018. 

The downstream public consultation procedure will take place once the DEEC authorities have validated the 
ESIA report. The ESIA update is not expected to have major changes – the Optimization team made general 
positive changes on environmental and social aspects. 

The highlights of the baseline environmental studies and the impact study are provided in Section 20 and are 
from the ESIA filed in 2018. 

1.13 Capital and Operating Costs 

The overall capital cost estimate was compiled by Lycopodium and is presented in Table 1.5.  

All costs are expressed in United States Dollars unless otherwise stated and are based on Q2 2018 pricing and 
deemed to have an overall accuracy of ±15%. The capital cost estimate conforms to AACEI (Association for the 
Advancement of Cost Engineering International) Class 3 estimate standards as prescribed in recommended 
practice 47R11.

1.14 Economic Analysis 

An economic assessment of the Project was completed using a pre and after-tax cash flow model prepared by 
IAMGOLD. The model was structured using an EXCEL workbook which presents annual cash flows during the 
expected life of mine of the project.  Parameters affecting the project cash flow are: production schedule, 
revenues, royalties, sustaining and initial capital requirements, operational costs, working capital, financing 
costs, mine closure costs and Senegalese fiscal regime.   

The after-tax financial analysis and results are based on a NPV, the IRR, the payback period which is initiated at 
project approval (except for payback which refers to an amount of time after commercial production is 
declared) and the all-in sustaining costs (AISC) which is a gold industry standard in benchmarking costs per 
ounce of gold. 

The costs were evaluated in United States Dollars.  All amounts are in constant 2018 dollars, no provision is 
made for inflation nor increase in gold price.  All cash flows are estimated on the project base solely and are 
excluding debt financing and a discount rate of 6% was used for the calculation of the NPV. 

At the award of the ''permis d'exploitation'', a mining company will be created where the Government of 
Senegal will hold a 10% free carrying interest.  IAMGOLD will hold the other 90% remaining interests.  Hence the 
Senegalese government will receive 10% of all declared divided produced by the Boto mining company.   

Input data was provided from a variety of sources, including the various consultants' contributions to this 
report, pricing obtained from external suppliers and contractors, and exchange rates and project specific 
financial data such as the expected project taxation regime. 

The life of mine capital cost for the project is estimated at $320.5M, with an initial capital expenditure of 
$254.4M.  Table 1.7 presents a summary of the production information on which the financial model is based, 
while the summary of the financial results is presented in Table 1.8.

4.3 Bamadji Joint-Venture (IAMGOLD/Randgold) 

Between the Daorala-Boto Exploration Permit is the Bamadji property (see Figure 4.2).  The mineral rights to 
this property are also held by Randgold Senegal.  The Bamadji property is not subject to this report and is only 
described below for completeness. 

The Bamadji property is a joint venture between AGEM (IAMGOLD) and Randgold Resources Ltd. (Randgold), an 
Isle of Jersey, UK, based mining company.  Randgold holds the mineral rights to the Bamadji property which 
consists of a single permit, 343 km2.  The Bamadji property is situated between the Daorala and the Boto areas 
in southeast Senegal and is situated adjacent to the west of the Loulo gold mine in Mali and operated by 
Randgold.  The distribution of the share capital is 65% Randgold and 35% AGEM. 

As of 3 March 2017, Randgold became the owner of the Exploration Permit by maintaining the rights of AGEM 
in accordance with the joint venture agreement.  

4.4 Stratex Option Agreement (IAMGOLD/Stratex) 

On March 1, 2018, Stratex International PLC (Stratex) and IAMGOLD announced that an option agreement was 
signed for the Dalafin gold project in Senegal.  The option agreement was approved by the government on 26 
March, 2018.  Stratex, is an AIM-listed exploration and development company focused on gold projects in 
Turkey and Africa. 

The Dalafin project consists of a single exploration permit, 472.5 km2 is located west and adjacent to the Boto 
West permit, in the south, and extends approximately 70 km north, east of the town of Saraya (Figure 4.5). 

The option agreement was signed between AGEM, IAMGOLD's Senegalese subsidiary, and Stratex EMC SA 
(Stratex EMC), Stratex' 85% owned Senegalese subsidiary.  Under the terms of option agreement: 

• AGEM will have the right to acquire an initial 51% interest in Dalafin by expending $4 M over 4 years 
at the project (the 'First Option'). 

• Subject to the First Option being exercised by AGEM, AGEM and Stratex EMC may agree to form a 
joint-venture ('JV') company for the management of Dalafin. 

• AGEM has the option to increase its interest by a further 19%, to 70%, by expending a further $4 M at 
the project over the subsequent 2 years (the 'Second Option'). 

• Thereafter, AGEM and Stratex EMC will be required to contribute on a pro rata basis towards the 
Project, or will be diluted. Should either party be diluted below 10%, their interest will convert to a 
2% Net Smelter Returns ('NSR') royalty (the 'Royalty') on production from Dalafin, of which AGEM will 
retain the right to buy-back 0.5% of the Royalty for consideration of $0.5 M (thereby reducing the 
Stratex EMC royalty to 1.5%). 

• Subject to governmental approval.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Property is most easily accessed from Dakar by paved highway via Tambacounda-Kédougou-Saraya to 
eastern Senegal and from there, maintained dirt roads to the Project. The Property may be accessed by road 
from Dakar via: 

• Highway N1 east for approximately 470 km to Tambacounda to join. 

• Highway N7 southeast for approximately 230 km to Kédougou to join. 

• The Kédougou-Saraya Road for approximately 60 km to Saraya to join. 

• A secondary dirt road for approximately 80 km to the village of Noumoufoukha and the Project camp. 

The drive from Kédougou to the project camp is typically 2.5 hrs.  During the site visit in December, it was noted 
that several sections of the dirt road from Saraya to camp were undergoing construction; installing fords, 
culverts, and small bridges across creek beds.  

The nearest asphalt airfield to the Property is in Kédougou with a 1,800 m airstrip.  This airfield is not serviced 
by regular scheduled flights, however, there are private airline companies based in Dakar that may be chartered 
to this airfield.  In February 2016, the government of Senegal certified an 800 m laterite airstrip roughly 3 km 
southwest from the Boto Exploration camp.  The airstrip is currently unusable due to rain damage during the 
wet season and will require a renewal of the certification. 

5.2 Climate 

The Property is situated in the climate region of the Sudan-Sahel of Africa and is classified as a subtropical 
continental climate (Csa Köppen classification). This climate zone is characterized by two seasons: a rainy 
season from June to October, and a dry season from October to May. 

The weather is generally hot and dry from February to June (daytime temperatures 35°C to 45°C), hot and wet 
from June to November (daytime temperatures 30°C to 40°C); and mild and dry from December to February 
(daytime temperatures 20°C to 25°C). The Harmattan is a seasonal hot dry wind that blows from northeast or 
east from the Sahara desert during the dry season.  This wind usually carries large amounts of dust from the 
Sahara out over the Atlantic Ocean.

Exploration activities may be conducted all year round.  However, during the wet season, the Kolia Kabe River 
situated 14 km by road to the northwest of Boto Exploration Camp, floods and cuts off the road access at the 
Saroudia Bridge. 
 
5.3 Infrastructure and Local Resources 

There is very little infrastructure on, or to, this property.  The Boto Exploration Camp consists of permanent 
brick structures for rooms, toilets, kitchen, and offices.  Drill core storage and garages are sheltered open air 
structures.  At the New Camp, approximately 3 km west of Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit, there is also sheltered 
open air core storage facilities.  Both the Boto Exploration Camp and New Camp are fenced and have 24-hour 
security. 

There is no electricity from the national grid to this area of the country.  Electricity is supplied to the Boto 
Exploration Camp by diesel generators on site well with a water treatment plant.   There is some cellular 
telephone coverage which is supplied to this area of Senegal, and on the Project, by Senegal-based cellular 
towers and by cellular towers in neighbouring Mali. 

All equipment, supplies, and fuel are transported by road to the project site.  Most supplies, consumables, and 
fuel are sourced either from Kédougou or Dakar depending on availability. 

The village of Guémédji, and some surrounding villages, are a source of unskilled workers and fresh produce.  
Skilled and professional workers are sourced from Dakar. 

5.4 Physiography 

The southeast of Senegal is situated in the foothills of the Fouta Djallon, a mountainous region in west central 
Guinea, and situated to the south of the project area.  The Property lies between 100 m and 300 m above sea 
level with generally low to moderate relief consisting of broad lateritic plateaus and eroded valleys.  The Falémé 
iron deposits are visible as prominent hills to the south of the Property. 

The project area is situated in the south of the Senegal River watershed which drains northwest and west to the 
Atlantic Ocean.  The Boto deposits are located in proximity to the west of the Falémé River and the Balinko 
River.  

The vegetation is typical of a tropical forested savannah, with scattered trees (including baobab), scrub brush, 
elephant grass, and bamboo.  Trees are more abundant along rivers and creeks as gallery forests and around 
lateritic plateaus that have been broken down by erosion.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

The following information is taken from Lycopodium (2017) and RPA (2013). 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Project is located in the WAC, in the southeastern part of the Early Proterozoic formation of the Kédougou-
Kéniéba inlier, which covers the eastern part of Senegal and western Mali. 

The bedrock of the WAC is exposed inside the Léo-Mann shield, the Reguibat Shield, and the inliers of a Kédoug 
ou-Kéniéba and Kaye. It comprises an Archean nucleus (3.0-2.7 Ga, Camil et al. 1983) covered by Lower 
Proterozoic rock (2.1 Ga, Abouchami et al. 1990; Hirdes et al., 1996) (Figure 7.1). 

In the southern part of the craton, Lower Proterozoic Greenstone Lands are described as Birimian based on the 
Kits (1928) in the Birim River Valley of Ghana. These terranes have undergone the effects of Eburneen Orogeny 
(a major tectonic event to the 2.1 Ga) and are found throughout the inlier of Kédougou-Kéniéba and the Leo-
Man Shield, except in the extreme western parts where Archean terranes outcrop. 

Birimian terranes include linear volcanic belts and alternating sedimentary basins in a northeasterly direction 
that are separated by granite intrusions and past gneiss. Rocks are generally metamorphosed in green shale 
facies, although amphibolite facies are locally observed in metamorphic granitic intrusions (Boher et al., 1992). 

The Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier, where the Project is located, is the exposure in the far west of the Birimian. The 
Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier is bounded on the west side by the Hercynian Mauritanide belt; and on all other sides, 
it is unconformably overlain by the underformed upper Proterozoic sediments and the Early Phanerozoic rock of 
the Taoudeni, Tindouf, and Volta basins (Boher et al., 1992; Villeneuve and Cornea, 1994).

Lithostratigraphic Subdivisions  

The Birimian terranes of the Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier were first divided into three groups facing north to 
northeast, spread from west to east: Mako, Dialé, and Daléma. On the basis of their similar lithology, the Dialé 
and Daléma groups were later combined into the Dialé-Daléma Group (Bassot, 1966, 1987).  

Mako Group 

The Mako group is a volcano-plutonic belt composed primarily of volcanic rocks with some sub-volcanic 
intrusions and granitoids, and minor sedimentary rocks. It consists predominantly of tholeiitic and calc-alkaline 
volcanic rocks with interbedded volcanoclastic sedimentary rocks and intercalations of fluvio-deltaic 
sedimentary rocks (Kéniebandi Formation) equivalent to what Tarkwaian described in Ghana (Davis et al., 
1994). Typical lithologies include pillowed basalts with minor intercalated volcanoclastic rocks, high-Mg basalts, 
pyroxenites, sub-volcanic intrusions, and granitoids. The volcanic assemblage is dated between 2,160 Ma and 
2,197 Ma. In the eastern portion, calc-alkaline series and detrital sediments are associated with volcano-
sedimentary rocks (Boher, 1992; Dia et al., 1997, Bassot, 1987; Dia et al., 1997; Dioh et al., 2006). To the east of 
the Mako Group is the Daléma, an especially sedimentary group, which is separated from the Mako Group by a 
regional scale lineament called the "Main Transcurrent Zone" (MTZ). 

Dialé—Daléma Group 

The Dialé-Daléma Group consists mainly of sedimentary rocks with subordinate volcanic rocks. Typical 
lithologies include folded sandstones and siltstones, interbedded with calc-alkaline, and ash-and-lapilli tuffs 
(Bassot, 1987; Hirdes and Davis, 2002). This group is sub-divided into two series distinguished by their relative 
proportion of chemical and detrital sedimentary rocks. 

The Dialé-Daléma Group has a higher proportion of chemical sedimentary rocks; typical lithologies are, from the 
base to the top, crystalline limestone and dolomitic marbles, greywacke, arenite sandstone, and schist (Milési et 
al., 1989). According to Schwartz and Melcher (2004), the Dialé-Daléma Group has the most extensive 
occurrences of carbonate in the Birimian.  The Dialé-Daléma group was intruded by coalescing biotite-bearing 
granitic plutons. This sequence is overlain by distal turbidites, partially tourmalinized in the upper part, and 
carbonate-bearing fine-grained sedimentary rocks. 

The Senegalese and Malian sides of the inlier use different terminologies for the same geological formations; 
since both sides of the inlier are mentioned in this section, Table 7.1 is provided for purposes of simplification.

One of the important features of the Dialé-Daléma Group is the north-south oriented lineament, known as the 
Senegal-Mali Shear Zone (SMSZ), located in the eastern part of the inlier (Figure 7.2). Early geological 
interpretations extended the Dialé-Daléma Group over this regional lineament to the east in the Malian part of 
the inlier. Based on new observations however, a new volcano-plutonic belt has been outlined in the southeast 
portion of the inlier. It is called the Falémé Series and separates the Dialé-Daléma Group in the west from the 
Kofi Series in the east. The Kofi Series is restricted to the east of SMSZ and consists of sandstones, argillites, and 
platform carbonates intruded by syntectonic S-type peraluminous biotite-bearing granites. The detrital 
sedimentary rocks at the Loulo Deposit found in the Kofi Series, were dated between 2,093 ±7 Ma and 2,125 
±27 Ma (Boher et al., 1992). 

In summary, the inlier can be structurally described as consisting of two volcano-plutonic belts oriented north to 
northeast (the Mako Series and the Falémé Series), and two intervening sedimentary basins called The Dialé-
Daléma Group and the Kofi Series (Figure 7.2).

Tectonic Setting 

The Birimian rocks of the Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier have been affected by a polycyclic deformation and 
metamorphic history related to the Eburneen Orogeny (2.2 Ga to 2.0 Ga). Three major deformation phases 
were identified: a collisional phase (D1) associated with the initial accretion of the Birimian, and two 
transcurrent phases (D2-D3) associated with the formation regional-scale north-south shear zones. 

At the scale of the Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier, the D2-D3 deformation is clearly related to the two regional 
transcurrent ductile structures (i.e.: the north-east trending MTSZ, located between Mako and Dialé-Daléma, 
and the SMSZ located in the eastern part of the inlier - Ledru et al., 1991; Gueye et al., 2007), as well as with 
subsidiary structures (Bassot and Dommanget et al., 1986; Ledru et al., 1991; Milési and Al., 1989, 1992; Dabo 
and Aife, 2010). 

D1 features include a penetrative cleavage (S1) that has transposed bedding (S0), a stretching lineation (L1) and 
an isoclinal syn-foliation folding (Figure 7.1) with various trends (north-south, northeast-southwest to east-
west, or northwest–southeast). 

The characteristics of D2 include upright or slightly overturned folding F2 and S2 cleavage, to the southeast 
which is parallel to the F2 axial plane (Figure 7.2), and usually marked by dissolution planes, a stretching 
lineation (L2) marked by stretched conglomerate clasts, and/or metamorphic mineral lineation. The D2 phase is 
associated with lateral left-shifting strike-slip faults trending north-south to northwest–southeast and major 
granite emplacement (Pons et al., 1992).  

The S2 fabric, which typically transposes and overprints bedding (S0) and S1 structures, is the most obvious 
deformational feature of the region (Ledru et al., 1991; Pons et al., 1992). It is generally steep with statistical 
trends close to N30E, although it is overturned to become north-south near the SMSZ. D2 is also associated with 
the emplacement of the Kakadian (2,199 ±68 Ma) and Saraya (1,973 ±33 Ma) granitic batholiths (Pons et al., 
1992; Gueye et al., 2007).  

D3 is marked by northeast–southwest strike-slip faults with associated folding (Pons et al., 1992; Feybesse and 
Milési, 1994).  

The tectonic history of the region can be summarized as follows:  

• Early Proterozoic: 

- deposits of clastic, pelitic, greywacke, carbonate, and volcano-sedimentary units 

• Eburnean Orogeny:  

- metamorphism (greenschist facies) of sediments to form quartzites, schists, marbles, etc. 
(Birimian D1, D2, D3)

7.2 Local Geology 

The Boto-Daorala and Bambadji concessions lie mainly within the Falémé Series, a volcanic-plutonic belt that is 
wedged between The Dialé-Daléma Group and the Kofi Series, and separated from the latter by the SMSZ. It can 
be chronologically correlated with the Mako Series. The most eastern part of the Property is in the Kofi Series. 

Typical lithologies of the Falémé "volcanic belt" include carbonate rich sedimentary rocks, a small amount of 
basalt and andesite, rare rhyolites, and syn-tectonic granitoids. A series of calc-alkaline dominated granitoids 
occur within this "granite-volcanite belt", including the Balagouma, Bambadji, Boboti, and Falémé granitoids.  
The Boboti and South Falémé granitoids have emplacement ages of 2,080 ±1 and 2,082 ±1 Ma, respectively 
(Ndiaye et al., 1997; Hirdes and Davis, 2002). According to Lawrence et al. (2013), the Kofi Series comprises a 
sequence of shelf carbonates, limestone clastic rocks, turbidites, and impure sandstones of tourmaline quartz, 
feldspathic sandstones and greywackes with argillite interlayer.  

The granites of Balagouma and Boboti are spatially associated with the Falémé iron deposits believed to be of 
skarn type. According to Schwartz and Melcher (2004), the iron deposits are genetically linked to the 
metasomatism related to the emplacement of these granite plutons. They were described as endoskarns and 
exoskarns hosted in calcitic and hematite-bearing bodies. The topographic peaks of these iron hills are the most 
apparent landmarks of the Falémé Volcanic Belt. 

7.3 Property Geology 

At Boto, the material near the surface consists of a layer of regolith which is varying in thickness and includes 
lateritic plateaus. Few rocky outcroppings are visible in the property; the banks of streams and rivers serve as 
the main source for geological observations. Only drilling can provide a detailed knowledge of the geology 
below surface. Drilling data and geological interpretation were used to create a regional representation of Boto 
geology. 

Boto can be divided into three north trending litho-structural domains (020˚ N) that are well delineated in both 
induced polarization (IP) and magnetic surveys. From west to east, the three domains are: 

• Western Flyschoid Domain. 

• Central Deformation Corridor. 

• Eastern Siliciclastic Domain.

5084\16.04\5084-REP-001  
  

Page 7.8

The western domain is dominated by a sequence of flyschoid turbidites, black shales (or graphitic pelite), 
carbonate rocks, minor volcanics (mainly basalt with subordinate rhyolite and pyroclastic breccia or 
agglomerate), and dioritic intrusions. The Boto 5 deposit is located along the contact between this domain and 
the central deformation corridor. 

The eastern domain is dominated by a detrital assemblage composed of greywacke and sandstone (+ quartzite), 
called Guémédji sandstone. It is thought that these sandstones/wackes are part of the Kofi Series which is very 
present in the Malian portion of the inlier. 

Between the west and east domains is a highly deformed north-trending domain (020˚ N) that is well defined in 
magnetic geophysical data. It is likely this highly deformed domain corresponds to a regional scale structural 
corridor that branches from the SMSZ. Lithologically, it is composed of fine schistose sediments that are 
carbonaceous in places, locally referred to as the "Pelite Unit", and fine laminated sediments (+ carbonates) 
that subtly grade into an impure marble, locally called the "Cipolin Unit". 

Generally, the geological units in the three domains strike 020˚ N with various dips. In the western domain, the 
dip is usually between 70˚ W and sub-vertical, while in the eastern domain, lithological units usually dip less 
than 60˚ W. Intrusive rocks are found within all three domains and include diorite, dolerite, granite, and 
granodiorite. Various volcanic rocks have also been observed in drill core, including andesitic vesicular lava, 
basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. Pyroclastic rocks including lapilli tuffs, ash tuffs, and agglomerates have also been 
documented.  It should be noted however, that the local term agglomerate facies could have a tectonic origin 
rather than a pyroclastic one. Figure 7.3 demonstrates examples of some of the characteristic lithologies at 
Boto. 

The known gold deposits at the Project occur on the margins of the central deformation corridor (Figure 7.4). 
Boto 5 lies along the western boundary (contact with carbonaceous turbidites) while Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, 
and Boto 6 lie along the eastern boundary (contact with the Guémédji sandstone). 

Geochemical anomalies at Boto are strongly correlated with the structural trends described above. The Lelou 
and Guémédji geochemical domains correspond with the western flyschoid domain and the central 
deformation corridor, respectively. 

The Lelou trend, which encompasses two surface geochemical anomalies - Boto 1 and Boto 3, remains a 
prospective exploration target and is yet to be tested. The Guémédji trend hosts Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, 
Boto 6 and Boto 5 (Figure 7.5).

Malikoundi/Boto2, Boto 4, and Boto 6 

At Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4 and Boto 6, the regolith is composed of pedolith (soil, ferricrete, and laterite), 
saprolite, and transition weathering profiles (saprock) that average 8 m, 20 m, and 10 m in thickness, 
respectively. The detailed study of regolith has made it possible to distinguish between transported and in-situ

regolith. The assay results from up-dip expressions of mineralized zones, confirm in-situ mineralized regolith.   
Mineralization in fresh rock is mainly associated with pervasive albite alteration and pyrite. 

Interpretation of structural data collected from oriented drill core has shown differences between 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, and Boto 6. Boto 6 is characterized by a bedding strike of 025˚ N, whereas 
Malikoundi/Boto 2 appears to have two bedding strike directions of 015˚ N and 030˚ N. The two bedding strike 
directions observed at Malikoundi/Boto 2 may result from ductile deformation within the impure marbles and 
laminated detrital sediments. Contrary to other parts of the structural corridor, a significant rotation of bedding 
strike to 147˚ N is noted in the drill core at Boto 4. The relationship between bedding and shear structures at 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, and Boto 6 relative to the central deformation corridor is shown in Figure 7.5. 

At Malikoundi/Boto 2, a 30° to 60° westward-dipping thrust fault has been observed in drill core at the contact 
between the Guémédji sandstone and the sequence of marble/laminated sediments. Of particular interest is a 
large lens of Guémédji sandstone that lies above the fault (Figure 7.6). This over-riding block of sandstone from 
the north end, cut out and moved from the Guémédji sandstone unit, is the main host of mineralization in this 
prospect. As a result of these movements, this lenticular block was severely fractured against adjacent rocks, 
and this fracturing was the conduit through which the gold-carrying fluids circulated and the mineralization was 
deposited. Thus, the fracturing associated with the sandstone lens is the principal carrier of mineralization in 
facies as diverse as sandstone, pelites, agglomerates, cipolin (unclean marble), or sometimes even syntectonic 
diorite. This overlap/shear fault was also identified further south in Boto 4 and Boto 6, further north of the 
Falémé River to the Fekola Gold Mine in Mali (called Medinandi permit), owned and operated by B2Gold; as 
well as further south to the Tammy permit (Mali). Several different units of cipolin were observed and these 
units played the role of deformation trends as well as permeability barriers to mineralizing fluids.  At Malikoundi 
North, one of the units of cipolin corresponds to the mineralization zone having accommodated the 
deformation related to the circulation of mineralizing fluids. 

Cipolin units can be subdivided into: 

• Stratigraphic Cipolin In-situ: these marbles are distorted but remain in their stratigraphic place and 
are generally thick. 

• Cipolin of Re-crystallized Deformation: these marbles are very distorted and re-crystallized and have 
been spread along shear structures by deformation. They no longer correspond to the stratigraphic 
orientation, but to a structural orientation usually making the junction between two different 
stratigraphic cipolins that were thus accommodated; their thickness is generally low, with an average 
thickness between 2-3 m and only rarely surpassing 10-15 m.

Boto 5 

The weathering profile of Boto 5 is considerably deeper than that of Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4 and Boto 6. 
Boto 5 is covered with a layer of pedolith 10 m to 40 m thick under which the saprolite layer can reach up to 80 
m thick. The transitional layer under the saprolite is between 10 m to 40 m thick. 

The lithological units at Boto 5 strike 015°-020° and include shale, carbonaceous sediment, and basalt. An albite-
altered diorite dike that hosts the mineralization at Boto 5 cross-cuts the stratigraphy, striking 045° N dipping 
between 45° W and 60° W towards the west. Dieng (2005) described this dike as being discordant, 
approximately 30 m wide, and containing fragments of host rock in places. According to Dieng (2005), four 
deformation phases occurred at Boto 5. An early phase of brittle-ductile deformation led to the emplacement of 
barren tourmaline veins. This was followed by reverse brittle-ductile faulting overprinted and reactivated on the 
northeast trending structures. Gold-bearing quartz-tourmaline veins were formed during this phase. The D2 
structures were subsequently covered by a third ductile deformation phase. The latest deformation event is 
characterized by north-northwest and northeast trending brittle faults that offset the mineralization into blocks 
(Figure 7.7).

Alteration 

Based on core and thin section observations, it is believed the rocks that host the Boto deposits underwent five 
phases of alteration, which are strongly linked to the coeval structural and lithological hydrothermal events. The 
five main alteration phases observed are (Figure 7.8): 

• Albite-sodic pervasive alteration that has turned the rock pink. 

• Chlorite-calcite-magnetite fractures and wallrock alteration.  

• Quartz-tourmaline-pyrite veining, with very limited wallrock alteration. 

• Pyrite-hematite-calcite veining.  

• Gypsum-anhydrite veining- with fissural hematization of the host rock. 

The first alteration event is linked to intense fracturing and pervasive pink albitization. The second phase is 
related to a chlorite-calcite-magnetite alteration that developed along the fracture network as infill and locally 
overprinting the albitized wall rock. These two phases produced the crackle-breccia that characterizes most of 
the mineralized rock along the Guémédji trend.

Page 7.15

The third phase of alteration is characterized by a wallrock alteration associated with the emplacement of 
quartz-tourmaline-pyrite veins. Finally, the initial phase of chlorite-magnetite alteration is locally overprinted by 
pyrite-hematite-calcite alteration. 

The last event (the gypsum-anhydrite phase) is essentially corresponding to the recent supergene alteration, 
destroying sulfuric acid and hematite. The acid was then combined with carbonates scattered in the rock, or 
from the marbles/cipolins, with a neoformation of minerals. This strong and recent supergene alteration is 
clearly related to the well-recognized thrust/shear fault of the core by the presence of fault gouge affecting 
either the cipolin or andesite. This is nevertheless a phase of hydrothermal alteration because the presence of 
anhydrite suggests a certain pressure and heat.  

With the exception of Boto 5, Boto gold mineralization is mainly associated with crackle breccia. Brittle-ductile 
veins with a thickness varying from 0.5 cm to 2 cm have developed along pre-existing fractures filled with 
permutations of quartz, carbonate (calcite and ankerite), tourmaline, magnetite, chlorite, hematite, and pyrite.  

At the scale of the prospect, it appears gold mineralization may have been favoured by the intersection of the 
north-northeast and north-northwest faults.

7.4 Mineralization 

Primary gold mineralization within the Early Proterozoic Birimian terrane was subdivided by Milési et al. (1989, 
1992) into pre-orogenic, syn-orogenic, and late-orogenic. Mineralization of the five deposits in Boto are 
classified as late orogenic. 

Late orogenic mineralization is usually associated with brittle-ductile deformation and is characterized by the 
association of Au, B, W, As, Sb, Se, Te, Bi, Mo, with traces of Cu, Pb, and Zn. Gold commonly occurs as native 
gold or as fine inclusions within the base metal sulphides or the gangue consisting of quartz, albite, carbonate, 
muscovite, pyrite, and tourmaline. In this category, there are two types of mineralization which, in some 
instances, may have been superimposed on each other locally: 

• Disseminated gold-arsenopyrite and gold bearing quartz veins: 

- occur within northeast-southwest striking tectonic corridors

- commonly hosted by metasediments 

• Gold-quartz vein deposits with rare polymetallic sulphides (Pb, Cu, Zn): 

- associated with the final deformation phases of the Eburnean Orogeny 

- hosted in various lithological sequences 

Boto 5 

The Boto 5 prospect is located near the SMSZ. The gold is mainly hosted by an east-northeast striking, intensely 
albitized diorite intrusion, that penetrates and covers a northeast striking sequence of turbiditic sediments and 
limestone. Many diorite intrusions have also been observed. The mineralization is located mainly in albitite, 
either in a sill or in a casting.  Mineralization in the host rock was not observed either in sediments or pyroclastic 
units. The intrusion of albitic lava resulted in a strong albitization when it intersected older diorite intrusions. 

Gold mineralization follows a phase of quartz tourmaline veining as well as pyrite and related bleaching. The 
mineralizing event was accompanied by biotite alteration and pyrite mineralization, and a small proportion of 
chalcopyrite, covellite, and chalcocite. The presence of arsenopyrite appears to be confirmed by recent XRF 
measurements. Mineralization appears to be truncated against an east-northeast striking fault and is locally 
offset by a series of north-south striking faults.  

Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, and Boto 6 

The majority of the gold mineralization at the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, and Boto 6 is hosted in the upper part 
of the Guémédji sandstone, near a structurally modified contact with the overlying, finer grained sedimentary 
sequence. The three main phases of alteration and mineralization were the subject of macroscopic 
observations, with gold mineralization interpreted as part of the last two events:  

• Chlorite-albite alteration and magnetite-hematite-chlorite veining; calcite-tremolite alteration in 
distal settings. 

• Quartz-tourmaline-pyrite alteration and veins. 

• Hematite-calcite-pyrite alteration and veins. 

The chlorite-albite alteration is cited as associated with mineralization even if the fluids of this alteration did not 
carry gold due to the presence of magnetite which facilitated the precipitation of the gold; associated sulphides 
(pyrite) arrived during the phases of subsequent alteration. There is a strong relationship between the presence 
of magnetite and the gold associated with this precipitation. Microscopically, gold was observed in only two 
influxes at the end of the quartz-tourmaline phase. Macroscopically, gold is rarely observed in small sub-
millimetre points on the core.

The size of the gold particles varies from <10 µm to 100 µm and have an average of approximately 20 µm. A 
review of gold mineralization and hydrothermal alteration at Boto identified six modes of emplacement 
(Gatinel, 2012) (Figure 7.9): 

• Free gold in quartz-tourmaline veins. 

• Free gold grains in quartz. 

• Gold grains in fractures associated with chlorite-magnetite-pyrite + quartz-calcite. 

• Gold in fractures within the scheelite. 

• Free gold in pyrite. 

• Free gold in calcite.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

Similar to the majority of the deposits found in the Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier, gold mineralization at Boto is 
considered to be of the orogenic type.  The orogenic gold deposits in the Birimian Province have been classified 
into three groups (Pre-, Syn-, and Post-orogenic).  The characteristics of Boto mineralization are more similar to 
those of the post orogenic class. 

As mentioned previously, the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4 and Boto 6 deposits are hosted by a turbiditic 
sedimentary sequence, with mineralization concentrating along the contacts of the litho-structural domains.  
The association of orogenic deposits with turbiditic sequences is well documented by Poulsen et al. (2000).  
Turbidite-hosted gold deposits within the eastern Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier are controlled by north-northeast 
trending structures linked to the SMSZ and, occur within the vicinity of intersecting north-northeast and north-
northwest structures.  At the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4 and Boto 6 deposits, gold is typically associated with 
pyrite, which is either disseminated along fractures (crackle-breccia hosted type) or along brittle-ductile veins. 

Alteration assemblages observed at Boto 5 differ from those observed at Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, and Boto 
6.  The Boto 5 deposit is hosted in a diorite dike that contains abundant endogenic albite or has been 
pervasively altered to albite.  The host rock at Boto 5 is highly deformed and contains a stockwork of quartz-
tourmaline-pyrite veins.  Although differing in appearance, this style of brittle-ductile deformation and veining is 
consistent with an orogenic gold mineralization model.

AGEM has carried out exploration activities on the Project since 1999, with the majority of this work being done 
from 2007 and is currently on going. Between 1999 and 2007, AGEM compiled the results of the work carried 
out by Anmercosa and Ashanti Goldfields and carried out a number of geophysical surveys, such as gradient IP, 
radiometric, very low frequency (VLF) and HeliTEM (Helicopter Electromagnetics) surveys. Early drilling program 
centred upon the discovery and delineation of Boto 5, as well as the initial drilling fences at the Boto 2-4-6 
anomalies. After 2007, the Boto 2-4-6 targets were the object of infill drilling as well as high resolution IP 
gradient surveys. The 2012 campaign led to the discovery of Malikoundi to the north of Boto 2.

The 2016 exploration program consisted mainly of a diamond drill campaign and various technical studies.  The 
2016 diamond drilling campaign included: 

• Exploration drilling of 4,813 m including four deep drill holes totalling 2,341 m, 22 short drill holes in 
Malikoundi totaling 1,952 m, and deepening of several drill holes that were stopped within 
mineralization totalling 492 m.  This drilling defined the extension of the mineralization in Malikoundi 
to the north and at depth.

the Malikoundi and were also used in the definition of mineralization. 

• Definition drilling for Malikoundi/Boto 2 open pit including 607 m of drilling to define the northern 
extent of mineralization and 440 m from three drill holes to define a southeast extent of 
mineralization.  

9.4 Exploration by AGEM, 2017 – March 2018 

Exploration activities from 2017 to March 2018 were mainly focused on drilling with the following purposes: 

• To improve definition of mineralization at Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 5. 

• To cover the gap in drill information between Malikoundi and Malikoundi North areas. 

• To improve geotechnical characterization for the foundations of infrastructure. 

• To install piezometers and carry out tests for hydrogeological testing at Malikoundi/Boto 2 and 
Boto5. 

• To deepen geo-mechanical and hydrogeological knowledge for pits at Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 5, 
as part of the feasibility study.  

• To define mineralization at Boto 6 on a 50 m x 50 m grid. 

• To further explore new targets in vicinity of Malikoundi, more specifically located to the East, West 
and Southeast.

The Guémédji geochemical trend, which hosts the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit, extends approximately 8 km in 
length from the Falémé River (north of Malikoundi) to the Balinko River (south of Boto 6). The area is covered 
by a thick lateritic cover, which makes traditional geochemical sampling ineffective. Termite mounts sampling 
was proven to be effective in identifying geochemical anomalies over Property. These anomalies are often well 
expressed and led to delineation of Boto 2, Boto 5 and Boto 6.  

The Lelou trend, which hosts the Boto 5 deposit, has been poorly explored to the northeast, where the lateritic 
cover thick and ranges from 3 m to over 10 m. The area has not been tested by any sub-surface probing 
methods. 

West of Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 5 deposits, there is another structural trend which hosts the Boto 1 and 
Boto 3 targets, which are relatively underexplored. The Boto 3 deposit was only tested by pit sampling, where 
Boto 1 was scarcely drill-tested (Figure 9.1).  

In June 2017, was organized a targeting workshop where various dataset were re-assessed and some fifteen 
new exploration targets were defined. These targets are mainly located east and west of the Malikoundi pit and 
were assigned priority.  During Q4 2017, four of these targets were drill tested by RC, totalling 3,996 m and 
Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drilling, totalling 5,488 m.  

In February 2018, a new campaign of RC and DDH drilling has been established to follow up on the positive 
results from Q4 2017.  This program is still ongoing to the East, West and Southwest of Malikoundi.

10.2 Drilling Procedures 

Drill pads are prepared to approximately 15 m by 8 m, and the positions of the planned drilling is located using a 
handheld GPS unit. A piece of wood with flagging tape that states the technical parameters for the holes to be 
drilled (i.e. drill hole number, Azimuth, dip and planned depth) is placed firmly in the ground. 

For diamond core drilling, two pieces of wood, for a front sight and back sight, are placed in front of the hole to 
be drilled at 15 m and 25 m on the same line to facilitate alignment of the drill on the appropriate azimuth.  For 
RC and RAB drilling, a line is drawn on the ground and the drill is aligned parallel to this line. 

From the 2009 drilling campaign, drill hole collar surveys were carried out by Differential Ground Positioning 
System (DGPA).  Drill hole collars, prior to 2009 were re-surveyed by DGPS.   

10.2.1 Diamond Core Drilling 

Generally, the DD holes were drilled using HQ size core within lateritic overburden and weathered material 
(saprolite and saprock), and then reduced to NQ size core in fresh rock.  Since 2003, oriented core drilling has 
been employed.  To mark the bottom of oriented core holes, two methods were used: a "down-hole spear" 
(used before 2010) and an ACE apparatus (more recently). For both methods, the downhole tools were handled 
by the driller and markings were made every three metres. DD holes were surveyed downhole with a reflex

instrument. Downhole surveys were performed every 100 m, at the point where HQ was reduced to NQ, and at 
the end of the hole. 

The drill rig is set up by drillers under the supervision of a geologist, who checks the planned azimuth and dip 
before the drilling starts. Since 2009, the drillers have been allowed to align the rig with the marks pre-made by 
a geologist or technician. Geologists align the drill rig with a compass and a clinometer. Core trays are 
transported from the drilling site to the camp by the technician at the end of each shift. Upon arrival in the 
camp, the subsequent operations are carried out under the direct supervision of the geologists. 

At the camp, core trays are aligned on logging tables according to their depth, so the geologists can review the 
core for orientation, recovery, and rock quality designation (RQD). Core recovery and RQD measurements are 
then documented in detail by a trained technician under the supervision of the geologists who are usually 
logging the hole at the same time. The core is logged by geologists for lithology, alteration, structure, veining, 
mineralization (sulphide content), and weathering/oxidation. 

For structural logging, alpha and beta angles for each type of structure are measured and recorded. 
Observations are usually made every metre. Commonly logged structures include bedding, schistosity, veining, 
shear bands, fractures, and fault markers. Vein characteristics such as size, infill material, alteration minerals, 
and sulphides are also recorded. After logging is complete, samples are taken for density measurements. The 
core trays are then transferred to the sawing area. Since 2012, 10 cm long pieces of core have been collected 
every 25 m for density measurements using the plastic wrapped water immersion method. 

The core is sawn with a diamond saw blade and placed in bags. The saw is washed between samples. Where 
core recovery is poor, and no sufficient sample is available to prepare a sample, two or three metres are 
combined to make a composite sample. 

The following activities take place in the core sawing area: 

• Pictures are taken of core in the tray, three trays at a time. Core is split into two halves, with one half 
to be sent for assay and the other half kept for reference. Soft rocks such as saprolite are usually cut 
with a machete. 

• Half of each one metre long core is broken with a hammer and placed in a 24 cm by 40 cm plastic 
bag. A pre-prepared sample tag is added, and the bag is wrapped and stapled at the top. 

• Sample preparation starts immediately after all core in the core tray is cut. 

• A sampling sheet is provided to the technician for each hole to be sampled. 

10.2.2 Reverse Circulation and Rotary Air Blast Drilling 

Samples are taken every one metre down the hole and the entire hole is sampled. Samples are collected at the 
exit of the drill cyclone using 50 cm X 80 cm plastic bags, resulting in 25 kg to 35 kg sample weights when the 
recovery is good. The cyclone is blown clean by the drill operator between each sample. The Hole ID and the

sample depth are written on the plastic bag with a permanent marker. After collecting the sample, a sample 
tag, which includes the sample number as well as an aluminium-made tag that includes both the sample 
number and Hole ID, is put inside the bag. All these operations are under the supervision of a geologist, who is 
also in charge of logging the geology immediately after a sample is collected. Tags and sample bags are 
prepared and marked in advance. 

After the rig has moved to another hole, another crew will start splitting the samples. Each sample is split with a 
high capacity splitter until a two to three-kilogram sample for assay and a duplicate are obtained, with both 
samples being bagged and numbered. Control samples are introduced approximately every 20 samples: a 
duplicate sample and a blank sample are alternatively inserted within the sampling sequence. 

Prior to 2003, the bulk samples from the cyclone were transferred to the camp where they were weighed 
before splitting. Geology was being logged twice, with a quick log done by a site geologist to monitor geology 
while drilling and a more detailed logging was completed in the camp by another geologist, who would use a 
chipboard as a lithological reference tool. 

Two-metre composites were usually submitted to the assay laboratory. After the 2003 campaign, samples have 
been logged and prepared in the field as outlined above. The chipboard reference tool has been replaced by a 
chip tray that can be brought into the field. RC and RAB holes are logged in 1 m increments and information 
captured in the logs is the same as core logging with the exception of structural information.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Historical Sample Preparation and Analysis 

Prior to 1999, exploration was carried out by Ashanti Goldfield and Anmercosa. The only known sampling types 
conducted during this period were surface geochemical sampling and grab sampling. 

From 1999 to 2004, sample preparation was carried out at Karakaena Camp for both the Bambadji and Daorala-
Boto permits. The preparation included crushing, pulverization, and splitting of 100 g pulp which as shipped to 
the laboratory for analysis.  

Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) from 1999 to 2004 consisted of the insertion of duplicate 
samples, blank samples (blanks), and standard samples as follows:  

• A duplicate was inserted in every batch of 10 samples. 

• A certified blank was inserted every 20th sample. 

• A certified standard was inserted every 40th sample. 

During this period, preliminary preparation was carried out at the AGEM field laboratory before being 
submitted to a commercial laboratory. This field lab was under the supervision of an experienced technician.  

Diamond drill cores were split with a core saw, half of which were used as a sample and the other half retained 
for future needs. The RC and RAB samples, samples were collected meter by meter, the whole meter is dried 
before splitting down all 1 m and 20 kg mean weight, were completely dried before being divided into 2 kg 
samples each using a riffle splitter. The representative sample was then crushed and pulverized. 

Once each sample was processed, the material was cleaned using compressed air. The pulverizer was cleaned 
by pulverizing barren material (quartz sand) between samples. 

The entire 2 kg sample was crushed using a standard or hand-held mechanical crusher to achieve a maximum 
particle size of 2 mm. Portion of crushed sample was then pulverized to have 80% of pulverization passing 120-
mesh.  

The entire sample was then split using a riffle splitter and 200g extracted; 100g of which was split and send to 
the laboratory and pulverized to less than 200-mesh size material before assaying 30 g at the request of 
IAMGOLD. 

From 2004 to 2007, for certain periods only, duplicates and blanks were used to do the QAQC for RC, RAB, 
trench, and termite mound samples. Since 2004 no preparation has been made at the camp, other than splitting 
of the RC and RAB samples. Samples of core, exploration pits, trenches, and mound were packaged and 
numbered prior to being sent to the laboratory.

The insertion rates of QA/QC samples at this time were: 

• A duplicate inserted in each batch of 10 samples. 

• A local blank inserted every 20th sample. 

• No certified standard was used.

In 2007 and 2008, the QA/QC procedure was reviewed and new procedures were put in place to ensure an 
adequate degree of confidence in the sample preparation and assay results. An internal validation of the 
samples pre-2007 was carried out by IAMGOLD in 2007 and did not detect any significant sampling issues. The 
new QA/QC methods were applied to previous data from 1999 to 2007 and approximately 10% of the samples 
were re-analysed in batches that include certified standard to comply with the new procedures. From that point 
on, validation procedure was systematically applied.  

11.2 Current QA/QC Procedures 

Since 2009, all AGEM sampling campaigns have been using certified standards and blanks, in addition to taking 
duplicates and check assay samples.  

During this period, AGEM used two types of blanks. One of the blanks is sourced from a Late Proterozoic 
sandstone near the border of Guinea (blank R) and the other is sourced from a termite mound known to have

no gold (blank S). The first is usually inserted among the fresh rock samples and the second among the saprolite 
samples. Samples of certified standard materials were purchased from Rocklabs and with standard values 
covering the grade ranges observed at Boto. 

For DD holes, a certified standard sample is inserted every 20 samples, alternating with blanks, which are also 
inserted every 20 samples. The same protocol applies to RC and RAB drilling. 

QA/QC results are monitored in each drilling program. Standard and blank samples are plotted against their 
theoretical value and scatter diagrams are created for duplicates and check assays. An assay batch is considered 
validated if the value received for the certified reference is within a range of ±15% of the mean certified value 
for that standard. The entire batch will be re-assayed if any certified standard does not meet this requirement. 
For blanks, any assay value greater than 10 ppb signifies a batch failure and the entire batch is then re-assayed.  

Boto maintains detailed records of each sample including the date of collection by the laboratory, the date of 
arrival in the laboratory, the assay results and the name and date of the file containing the results. Boto keeps 
detailed records to monitor the performance of blanks, certified standards, duplicate and check assays using the 
previously mentioned control charts. Boto also tracks the performances of the internal laboratory standards 
and blanks using the same type of control chart for its own data.  

Until December 2013, all samples from Boto were being analyzed at the ALS Chemex Laboratory in Bamako. 
Upon reception in the laboratory, samples are removed from the sample bags and checked against the chain of 
custody form. Each sample is weighed and assigned a bar code number and a unique file number. The 
information of the sample is entered into the ALS system under an ALS file number.  

The sample is placed in a drying tray and a label, with a unique sample and file number, is placed in the sample 
tray with the specimen. Samples dry for 24 hours. The following procedures are applied to the following sample 
types:  

DD and RC drilling samples are coarse crushed to 75% passing 2 mm. The jaw crusher is cleaned using 
compressed air after each sample. Every five samples, barren rock is passed through the crusher for cleaning. 
ALS performs a sieve size analysis after every 70 samples, to ensure crushing is adequately performed. A 1,000 g 
split of the crushed material is pulverized in a "ring and puck" grinding mill to 80% passing 200-mesh. As a 
pulverization QAQC, ALS also performs a sieve size analysis after every 20 samples. After grinding, a 50 g pulp 
sample is split and used for analysis. 

The analysis of the core and RC drilling samples is carried out by fire assay with an atomic absorption finish 
method (ALS code Au-AA24) on pulverized 50 g, with a lower detection limit of 5 ppb and an upper detection 
limit of 10ppm. Any results are greater than 10 ppm, are subsequently re-assayed using a gravimetric finish (ALS 
code Au-GRA22). 

ALS Chemex inserts two internally certified standards and two blanks in each batch of 24 samples. Duplicates 
are also analyzed on a regular basis. An internal laboratory QA/QC assessment for each batch of samples is 
carried out. The results of the control samples are evaluated to ensure they meet the standards established by 
the precision and accuracy requirements of the method. In the event that any reference material or duplicate

results are outside the established control limits, an error report is automatically generated and triggers a re-
assay of the batch. 

From December 2013, all Boto samples were processed in the Veritas laboratory. The staff of the Véritas 
laboratory is contacted when at least 800 samples are ready to be shipped. By the time the Véritas vehicle picks 
up the samples from the camp, the number has usually risen to approximately one thousand samples. The 
vehicle then carries the samples to the Kédougou preparation laboratory. Samples are then sorted by batches of 
200 samples and a name given. Since 2016, Veritas stopped preparations in Kédougou and samples are 
currently been prepared at the Véritas laboratory in Bamako, Mali. 

All samples are then dried and weighed. The drying temperature is between 60°C to 105°C; the drying time 
depends on humidity. The sample is fully crushed to have 70% passing 2 mm, size of the particles are check on 
regular basis. The sample is divided and homogenized to obtain a representative sub-sample before 
pulverization to 85% passing 75 µm. 

Pulps are then sent to the Véritas laboratory in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for assay. 50 g of pulp of the sample is 
weighed and mixed with a known mass of fondant, consisting of a mixture of lead oxide, sodium carbonate, 
borax, silica, silver, and other chemicals if necessary, to obtain a good lead-acid. This leaded fondant is then 
transformed into silver aggregate by cupellation. The silver pellet is dissolved with 1 ml of nitric acid and 1 ml of 
hydrochloric acid and digestion takes place in a water bath. The solution obtained from digestion is cooled, 
diluted with distilled water to a final volume of 10 ml, and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry to 
obtain the gold content.  

The DD and RC samples are assayed using fire assay with atomic absorption finish on 50 g of pulp (Véritas Code 
FA450), with a lower detection limit of 10 ppb. Samples of core that are analyzed using fire assay with atomic 
absorption finish and return a result greater than 10 ppm are re-assayed using a gravimetric finish (FA550 
Véritas Code). 

The duplicate is automatically generated by the system for core and rock samples. The normal frequency is 
usually a duplicate per every 50 samples. The duplicated sample is obtained by splitting the sample after 
pulverization. The duplicated sample is treated like all other normal samples as soon as it is produced.  

Repeats of analysis are systematically and randomly produced when preparing the fusion racks. In each fusion 
rack of 50 samples two blanks, two standards, and two duplicates are added. This number may vary depending 
on the quality of the results. 

11.3 Sample Security 

The samples were transferred from the field to the camp only in the presence of a qualified and experienced 
technician. Drill core cutting, sample packaging, and storage were carried out under the supervision of Boto 
geologists and technicians.

The core halves and the RC and RAB samples were packaged in sealed, plastic, sample bags. A sample tag is 
placed in each bag of samples taken. The samples are then picked up by laboratory personnel and transported 
to ALS Chemex in Bamako, or Véritas in Kédougou or Bamako, depending on the period of dispatch.  

11.4 QP Opinion 

It is the opinion of the QP that the sample preparation and analyses are adequate for this type of the deposit 
and that the sample handling and chain of custody are satisfactory and meet industry standards.  The data is 
considered representative for the level of study presented in this report. The QP concludes that the exploration, 
sampling practices, and resulting data are suitable for the estimation of a NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Data Verification 

The database was verified by the QP.  All assay analyses in the GEMS database since 2000 were extracted and 
approximately 12% of the assay values were randomly selected and verified against the official electronic copies 
of laboratory certificates.  No errors were found. 

In addition to these checks, the QP checked for abnormally high values, missing intervals or sample numbers, 
interval lengths, and zero levels.  Any high values above detection limit, often > 10 g/t Au, were re-analysed. 
Any values below detection limit, often < 0.005 g/t, Au were assigned the value of half the detection limit. Drill 
holes were checked visually for deviations in the down hole survey.  No errors were found. 

12.2 Site Inspection, December 2017 

A site inspection was conducted from December 11 to 15, 2017.  There were no drilling activities in progress at 
the time the site visit.  Table 12.1 lists the personnel included on the December 2017 site inspection

for drill hole collars, and reviewing drill core logs against selected drill core. 

Drill Core Logging and Sampling and Storage Facilities 

Drill core for the Project is logged, sampled, and stored in two locations: at the Boto Exploration Camp, situated 
approximately 12 km due west of Malikoundi, and at the New Camp, situated approximately 1.5 km west of the 
Malikoundi deposit.   

AGP inspected the two facilities and found the core storage sheds at both sites to be clean and orderly.  Core 
boxes are stacked by drill hole number.  The aluminium core boxes are stacked one on top of the other with

enough space between the rows of stacks to access any drill hole easily.  The core boxes do not have lids but are 
easily stackable and only the top box is open to the elements.  The stacks vary in height from less than 10 boxes 
to as many as 30 boxes high.

Drill Hole Collar Locations 

AGP located 55 drill hole collars at three of the four deposit sites; Malikoundi, Boto 5, and Boto 6.  At Boto 4, 
there was no evidence of drill holes found during the site visit as most of the drill holes were in the village of 
Guémédji and any drillhole markers have been removed.  

Drill hole collars are typically marked by a cement cast around a 4" PVC pipe in the collar.  The cement cast is 
inscribed with drill hole number, Azimuth, dip, and depth of drill hole.  Many of these cement casts are showing 
signs of wear and, in some cases breakage, but most are still legible.  Since the long grass is often burnt by the 
end of the rainy season, many of the PVC pipes are melted (Figure 12.3).

Figure 12.3  Drill Hole Collar for DBDD-2298 (Malikoundi) 

 

The locations of diamond and RC drill hole collars were measured in the field using a hand held Global 
Positioning System (GPS) device (Garmin GPSmap 62s) using WGS 84 datum, the same datum used by IAMGOLD 
at the Project.  A total of 55 waypoints were collected on the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, and Boto 6.  The 
majority of coordinates measured by AGP fell within a 5 m tolerance of those reported by IAMGOLD.  In only 
one instance was the Easting off greater than 5 m (at 9 m).  This is not considered a significant error given the 
accuracy of the handheld GPS (± 10m).  It is the QP's opinion that the coordinates are acceptable, given the 
accuracy of the handheld GPS used to review the drill hole collar locations. 

Table 12.1 to Table 12.3 present the comparison of the AGP and IAMGOLD drill hole coordinates for the 
Malikoundi, Boto 5, and Boto 6 deposits, respectively.

13.1 Review of Previous Metallurgical Tests 

The sections to follow provide a high-level summary of the metallurgical findings from each of the previous 
testwork program.  For more details, refer to the individual metallurgical report. 

13.1.1 SGS 2013 Testwork Program 

The testwork conducted in 2013 was a scoping level metallurgical test program supervised by Pierre Pelletier of 
IMG.  The scope of work for the program included head analyses, and tests on the Bond work index, gravity 
separation, whole ore carbon-in-leach (CIL), gravity tailings CIL, preg-robbing, and ore acid generating potential. 

The location and rock type of the samples used in this program are shown in Table 13.1.

Gold grades calculated from screened metallic analysis ranged from 1.01 to 10.7 Au g/t, with 3% to 72% of gold 
reporting to the coarse fraction.  Silver grades were below the detection limit of 0.5 g/t Au for all samples 
except for Met #6 which was at 0.9 g/t Au. 

Met #7 and 8 appear to contain different chemical make-up from the other samples as they were both higher in 
Al, Ni and Ti, and lower in Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P and Sr in comparison to the other samples. 

Grindability Testing 

Met #1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 were subjected to Bond ball mill grindability test at a grind size of 106 µm (150 Mesh).  
A summary of the results are shown in Table 13.3, with a comparison to the A. R. MacPherson Grinding

Gold recovery for the six samples ranged from 4% to 35% with the concentrate gold grade ranging from 140 to 
3,130 g/t Au. 

Whole Ore CIL Testwork 

Nine of the samples were subjected to whole ore CIL testwork (bottle roll) at a targeted grind P80 of 90 µm.  The 
bottle roll test parameters included pulp density of 40% solids, leaching at 48-hours, addition of activated 
carbon at a concentration of 10 g/L, cyanide concentration maintained at 0.5 g/L NaCN, and pH of 10.5 to 11.

The majority of the whole ore CIL results showed gold extraction in the range of 82 to 96% with only one 
exception being sample Met #7 at 25%.  This sample requires further investigation into its poor leach 
performance.  Oxygen sparging was used instead of air for Met #1 Test No. CN-28 and the results showed a 
noticeable decrease in the cyanide and lime consumptions. 

Gravity Tailings CIL Testwork 

The gravity tailings from Met #1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 were also subjected to CIL testwork to study the impact of grind 
size on gold extraction.  The test parameters were similar to the whole ore CIL tests, except that the sample 
grind sizes were at incremental targeted P80's of 90, 75, and 53 µm. 

As seen in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.6, the overall gold extraction from gravity concentration and gravity tailings 
CIL ranged from 85 to 95%.  All the samples exhibited a positive correlation between the finess of the grind and 
the extraction achieved.

Standard preg-robbing tests were also conducted on Met #1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and the results are shown in Table 
13.7.  After 24 hours of slurrying with synthetic gold stock solution, the pregnant solution of all five samples 
increased in gold tenor, indicating that there is no potential for preg-robbing.  However, it is recommended that 
future testwork be conducted with and without carbon to provide a more definitive result.

Environmental Testwork 

Modified acid-base accounting (ABA) tests were conducted on all nine samples to assist in determining the ore's 
acid generating potential.  The results are shown in Table 13.8. 

Table 13.8 SGS 2013 Modified Acid-Base Accounting Test Results 

 
NP = Neutralization Potential 
AP = Acid Generating Potential 
PAG = Potential for Acid Generation 

Met #1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 showed NP/AP ratios between 1 and 3 indicating the potential for acid generation (PAG), 
therefore, long term kinetic humidity cell testing should be conducted for these samples in the future. 

Met #7, 8 and 9 showed negative NP values and high sulphide contents, indicating that these samples are more 
than likely acid generating. 

Met #2 showed NP greater than 20 and NP/AP ratio greater than 3, indicating that the sample is potentially acid 
neutralising (PAN).

13.1.2 SGS 2014 Testwork Program 

The testwork conducted in 2014 was also supervised by Mr. Pierre Pelletier, and was a continuation of the 
previous scoping-level metallurgical test program in 2013.  The scope of work for the program included head 
analyses, flotation optimization tests, whole ore cyanidation tests, and ore acid generating potential tests. 

The location and rock type of the samples used in this test program are shown in Table 13.9.  Most of the 
samples were half NQ cores with only some HQ cores.

The three composites had similar chemical make-up with the only noticeable difference in the calcium content 
of Comp C where it is 3 to 5 times higher than the other two composites. 

Grindability 

SAG Mill Comminution (SMC) tests were performed for the three composites at three size fractions.  The SMC 
test results are summarized in Table 13.11.

The three composites were classified as hard with respect to resistance to impact breakage (A x b), with Comp C 
being the softest of the three.  The average relative densities varied from 2.73 to 2.82. 

Bond ball mill work index and Bond abrasion tests were also performed for the three composites.  The results 
are presented in Table 13.12, with a comparison to the A. R. MacPherson Grinding Specialist database shown in

The gravity separation result indicated gravity recoverable gold of 15 % to 30%.  The recommendation at the 
time of this testwork suggested that gravity could be implemented in a scoping-level flowsheet to decrease 
complexity and size of downstream cyanidation circuit. 

Flotation Testwork 

Whole ore flotation tests were conducted using 2 kg charges at different grind sizes for Comp A, B, and C.  The 
results are presented in Figure 13.5, Figure 13.6, and Figure 13.7.

The three composites responded well to flotation treatment with gold extraction increasing with decreasing 
grind size as expected.  Comp A had gold extraction ranging from 79% at a P80 of 99 µm to 85% at a P80 of 46 
µm.  Comp B had gold extraction ranging from 83% at a P80 of 100 µm to 87% at a P80 of 53 µm.  Comp C had 
gold extraction ranging from 86% at a P80 of 99 µm to 90% at a P80 of 53 µm. 

Bulk sulphide flotation tests were also conducted using 10 kg charges to generate material for downstream 
cyanide leaching.  The results were similar to the 2 kg charges.  Comp A had a gold extraction of 82.1% and 
sulphide extraction of 96.7% at a P80 of 52 µm.  Comp B had a gold extraction of 83.5% and sulphide extraction 
of 97% at a P80 of 50 µm.  Comp C had a gold extraction of 89.3% and sulphide extraction of 97.5% at a P80 of 
47µm. 

Gravity tails from the gravity separation tests (G-1, G-2, and G-3) were also subjected to flotation tests using the 
same reagent regime as the whole ore flotation but with additional collector 3418A.  However, the overall gold

ore flotation results at the same grind size. 

Coarse Bottle Roll Leach Testwork (Heap Leach Amenability) 

The three composites were subjected to coarse bottle roll leach testwork at four different crush sizes, 19mm, 
12.7 mm, 6.3 mm, and 1.7 mm, to study the ore's amenability to heap leaching.  The leach conditions for the 
testwork were 50% solids pulp density, pH of 10.5 to 11, NaCN concentration of 0.5 g/L, 28 days retention time 
and 1-minute agitation every hour.  Pregnant solution from each composite was submitted for gold analysis at 8 
hours, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 21 and 28 days to calculate the gold extraction percent.  The results are shown in Table 
13.14 and in Figure 13.9 to Figure 13.10.

The general trend from the coarse bottle roll leach results indicates that the finer the crush size, the higher the 
gold extraction.  None of the composites reached a plateau in the leach curves during the 28 days duration.  At 
the coarsest crush size, gold extractions after 28 days were 34.7%, 24.0%, and 22.5% for Comp A, B, and C, 
respectively.  At the finest crush size, gold extractions were 62.0%, 63.2%, and 71.6% for Comp A, B, and C, 
respectively.  The cyanide consumption was between 0.2 kg and 0.3 kg NaCN/t for Comp A and B, and slightly 
higher for Comp C between 0.4 kg to 0.6 kg NaCN/t.  Lime consumption ranged from 0.7 kg to 1 kg CaO/t for all 
the composites.

Whole Ore Cyanidation 

Carbon-in-leach (CIL) bottle roll tests were conducted on whole ore at grind P80's 90, 75 and 53 µm for the three 
composites.  The leach conditions were 40% solids, pH of 10.5 to 11, 0.5 g/L NaCN, 10g/L activated carbon 
addition, and 48-hours retention time.  At the completion of the test, carbons were removed from the pulp by 
filtering and were then washed and submitted for gold analysis along with the final leach solution and residue 
samples.  The results are shown in Table 13.15 and Figure 13.11.

Cyanidation of Flotation Concentrate 

CIL tests were conducted on flotation concentrate from each composite to assess the impact of different 
sodium cyanide concentrations, aeration and regrinding.  The leach conditions were as follows: 

• 25% solids pulp density. 

• pH of 10.5 to 11. 

• NaCN concentrations of 1 g/L, 2 g/L or 5g/L. 

• Activated carbon addition of 10 g/L. 

• Aeration with air or oxygen. 

• With or without addition of lead nitrate. 

• Retention time of 72 hours. 

• Regrinding to a P80 of 23 µm for Comp A, 16 µm for Comp B, and 19 µm for Comp C. 

The results from this testwork are presented in Figure 13.12 to Figure 13.14.

It was concluded by SGS that the optimum conditions for leaching flotation concentrate were having the sodium 
cyanide concentration at 2 g/L, sparging the pulp with oxygen and regrinding the pulp.  Of all the parameters 
tested, regrinding the flotation concentrate provided the largest benefit for gold extraction. 

Comparison of Different Process Options 

The results for the three composites tested with different process options are presented in Table 13.16.  
Although the coarse bottle roll leach results for the 1.7 mm crush size provided better gold extraction, the 
results for the 12.7 mm crush size as provided in Table 13.16 is more realistic for heap leaching.  Based on the 
comparison, the optimum metallurgical process was whole ore cyanidation, which yielded gold extraction 
exceeding 90% for the three composites.

Environmental Testwork 

The three composites were also subjected to modified ABA and Net Acid Generating (NAG) testing to determine 
the potential of the samples to generate acid drainage.  The results are shown in Table 13.17 and Table 13.18. 

Table 13.17 SGS 2014 Modified Acid-Base Accounting Results 

 
NP = Neutralization Potential 
AP = Acid Generating Potential 
PAG = Potential for Acid Generation 

As seen in Table 13.17, all three composites had NP/AP ratio greater than 3 but less than 20 which classified 
them to be not potentially acid generating.

The NAG results as seen in Table 13.18 further confirmed the conclusion that the three Malikoundi composites 
are not potentially acid generating with zero for all NAG values. 

13.1.3 SGS 2015/2016 Testwork Program 

In 2015, the Project entered into its prefeasibility study phase (PFS) and Mr. Jérôme Girard at IMG supervised 
additional metallurgical testwork with SGS Lakefield.  A sample selection exercise with Mr. Guy Desharnais was 
also conducted at SGS Geostats during the time.  The program began in 2015 with sample selection and 
grindability testwork, and ended with metallurgical testwork in 2016. 

The metallurgical testing portion of the program included: 

• Gravity separation testwork. 

• Intensive cyanidation Testwork on Gravity Concentrate. 

• Cyanidation on gravity tailings. 

• Variability testwork. 

• Environmental testwork. 

The sections to follow provide a high-level description of the various aspects of the testwork program. 

Sample Selection (2015) 

The objective of the sample selection exercise was to provide a specific set of samples to meet the 
requirements for the Boto PFS.  SGS Geostats analysed the Boto ore deposits and concluded that fresh rock 
from the Boto 2/Malikoundi pit and saprolite from the Boto 5 pit are the largest contributors to gold ounces 
(see Table 13.19).

The ore vein structures at Boto were categorized by domain denoted as 119, 124_c, 121, 124b_c2, and 125 for 
Boto 2/Malikoundi, and 103, 104, 101, and 102 for the Boto 5.  The primary domain for Boto 2/Malikoundi is 
119 making up 77% of the gold ounces, while 103 is the primary domain for Boto 5, making up 59% of the gold 
ounces. 

The main sampling criteria included selecting samples representative of the ore grade and lithological types, 
geographically well distributed with at least 60% from the first five years of production, and representative of 
some external and internal dilution. 

Visual representation of where the selected samples were taken from within the Boto deposits are shown in 
Figure 13.15 to Figure 13.18 by superimposing the selected drill core samples over the pit shells.

The three domain composites (all fresh rock type) were characterized as hard to very hard with respect to 
impact resistance and abrasion parameters (A x b and ta), and as medium to very hard for the CWi's.  The other 
fresh rock samples were characterized as moderately hard to hard with respect to the A x b values, as 
moderately hard to very hard with respect to the BWi's, and as medium to very abrasive with respect to the 
Ai's.  The other rock types were all significantly softer and less abrasive than the fresh rock.  The grindability

Native (liberated) gold (>75% Au, <25% Ag) was identified as being the main gold mineral in all three 
composites.  The gold mineral abundance for MC-1, MC-2, and MC-3 were 98%, 64%, and 97%, respectively.  
Calaverite (AuTe) was found in MC-2 at ~35%, with only trace amount in MC-1 and MC-3. 

Gravity separation testwork, intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate, and cyanidation of the gravity 
tailings were also conducted as part of the metallurgical development.  A summary of the results is presented in

For MC-3, the bulk cyanidation test (CN-89) had a viscosity issue which resulted in an overall gold extraction of 
only 74%.  If this cyanidation result was replaced by the bottle roll test result (CN-20), also conducted on Boto 5 
saprolite, the overall gold extraction for MC-3 would be 87%. 

Gold extraction from gravity concentrate averaged at 23%, which at the time was believed to be sufficient to 
warrant inclusion of this step in the flowsheet. 

The impact of finer grinding was also studied and a plot of the grind size versus the leach residue grade is shown 
in Figure 13.19.  Although the leach conditions were not identical for the tests shown in this figure, a trend can 
be observed where the extraction of gold increases as the grind size decreases.

The following key observations were made for the SGS 2016 metallurgical development testwork: 

• Decreasing the grind size from P80 of 118 µm to 41 µm for MC-1, P80 of 111 µm to 40 µm for MC-2, and 
P80 of 82 µm to 27 µm for MC-3 provided an increase in gold extraction of 9.7%, 7.7% and 3.6%, 
respectively. 

• The addition of lead nitrate improved the initial leach kinetics of MC-1 but not the gold extraction after 
24-hours.  Lead nitrate addition to MC-2 showed inconclusive results. 

• The addition of a pre-aeration stage resulted in a significant reduction in cyanide consumption. 

• The use of oxygen during MC-1 and MC-2 leach tests at the time did not show any obvious benefits. 

• MC-2 showed slower leach kinetics than MC-1, possibly due to its higher Calaverite (AuTe) content.  
Higher pH or lead nitrate addition may potentially be beneficial to this composite. 

• Increasing cyanide concentration did not reveal noticeable improvement in leach kinetics or gold 
extraction for MC-1 or MC-3.  Increasing cyanide concentration to 0.75 g/L NaCN did show some 
benefit for MC-2. 

• Leach tests conducted with and without carbon showed all three composites to be non preg-robbing. 

Variability Testwork (2016) 

40 samples were submitted for gold extraction variability testwork as part of the 2016 SGS metallurgical 
testwork.  A summary of the results is presented in Table 13.27.

Gap Analysis on 2015/2016 Testwork Program 

In 2017, a review of the 2005/2016 metallurgical testwork was completed by Lycopodium to identify some 
potential gaps prior to commencing the metallurgical testwork program for the Boto feasibility study (FS) phase. 

The recommendations or gaps identified include but are not limited to the following: 

• Silver and Tellurium detection limits were too high and Mercury content was not assessed. 

• Multiple variables were changed in the same test – this should be avoided in future testwork. 

• Impact of pre-aeration or pre-oxygenation on gold extractions or leach kinetics was not fully 
confirmed due to lack of a base case for the tested grind size. 

• True specific gravity should be determined by pycnometer.  SMC tests provided relative density. 

• Drill intercepts that will be used to form future master composites should be assayed, and results 
reported first prior to forming composites to ensure proper material assignment. 

• Whole ore leach tests should be conducted to study effect of excluding gravity separation step. 

• Lime demand test and rheology testwork to precede leach testwork such that realistic pulp pH and 
pulp density ranges can be selected. 

• Kinetic sampling to be conducted at shorter time intervals (e.g. 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48-hours). 

• Effect of lead nitrate should also be assessed on saprolitic material to ensure no negative effects. 

• The 40 variability samples should be tested for Tellurium (Te) to potentially establish location of 
Calaverite mineralization in the geological model. 

• Grind calibration should be conducted to determine grind times for each targeted grind size. 

• A leach test with site water should be conducted to ensure no negative effects. 

Lycopodium also consulted Orway Mineral Consultants (OMC) to conduct a review of the 2015 comminution 
data and the following recommendations were provided for Boto 2/Malikoundi: 

• Conduct 12 more CWi tests with priority given to pelite and agglomerate lithologies. 

• Conduct four more BWi tests on Boto 2/Malikoundi material, two on saprolite and two on saprock. 

• Conduct SMC tests on 5 new agglomerate and 3 new cipolin samples (optional only if budget is not a 
constraint).

13.2 Review of Most Recent Metallurgical Tests 

13.2.1 SGS 2017/2018 Testwork Program 

In 2017, the Project entered into its FS phase and Ms. Ryda Peung at Lycopodium supervised the metallurgical 
testwork at SGS Lakefield with involvement from Mr. Ricardo Esteban at IAMGOLD.  A sample selection exercise 
with Mr. Matthew Halliday was also conducted at SGS Geostats at the start of the program. 

The key objectives of this testwork included confirming the requirement of a gravity circuit, confirming the 
optimum leach conditions such as grind size, cyanide concentration, pulp density, addition rate for lead nitrate, 
and oxygen addition during leaching.  The program also included CIP modelling, and tests for solids-liquid 
separation, pH neutralization, oxygen uptake, preg-robbing, and cyanide destruction. 

Sample Selection (2017) 

For the Boto FS phase, SGS Geostats organised the drillhole data provided by IMG in such a way as to select 
samples respecting distance from previous metallurgical sampling and matching the grade distribution of the 
deposit.  The main objective was to select samples representative of the different grades, lithology, and spatial 
locations across the entire deposit, but also within the ultimate pit shell.  Samples within the mineralized 
envelopes or may potentially contain Calaverite were also given strong preferences.  SGS Geostats provided a 
list of the selected samples respecting these parameters to Lycopodium.  The samples used in forming the 
master composites and the variability composites were then selected from this list by Lycopodium with 
agreement from IMG. 

Three master composites were formed for use in the metallurgical development testwork: 

• MC-1: 50% saprolite, 50% saprock, 100% of the ore from Boto 5 deposit. 

• MC-2: ~90% fresh rock, ~5% saprolite, ~5% saprock, 96% of the ore from Boto 2/Malikoundi deposit 
and 4% from Boto 5 deposit. 

• SAP: 100% saprolite, ~85% of the ore from Boto 2/Malikoundi deposit and ~15% from Boto 5 deposit. 

The majority of the soft ore (10%) fed to the plant come from Boto 5 deposit, therefore MC-1 was formed to 
better understanding the metallurgical behaviour of this material.  MC-2 was formed to represent the expected 
LOM blend and ore grade.  The SAP (saprolite) sample was formed without grade consideration, and will only be 
used in solids-liquid testwork.  The samples used in forming the master composites shown in Figure 13.20 and 
Figure 13.21 for Boto 2/Malikoundi pit, and in Figure 13.22 and Figure 13.23 for the Boto 5 pit. 

Since Boto 2/Malikoundi makes up close to 95% of the overall life-of-mine (LOM) tonnage, the variability 
samples selected were heavily weighted for the Boto 2/Malikoundi pit.  Boto 5 material had limited amount of 
mass, hence, the majority of it was used in forming the master composite, MC-1, and only a small amount 
remained for the variability testwork.  The samples used in forming the variability composites for the recovery 
variablity testwork are shown in Figure 13.24 and Figure 13.25.

Grindability Testwork (2017/2018) 

Following the recommendations from OMC's review of the previous comminution data, two saprolite and two 
saprock samples from Boto 2/Malikoundi were selected for additional BWi tests.  Unfortunately, one of the 
saprolite samples was too fine and disintegrated before testwork can be done.  The results for the three new 
BWi tests are presented in Table 13.28 and Figure 13.26.

* The modified BWi procedure, involving the removal of excess U/S (naturally passing the closing screen) was applied to the Saprolite 2 
material.  The purpose of this procedure is to generate an accurate power requirement for the material in the feed that requires 
comminution (the "Direct" BWI value) and eliminating the material that requires no power as it is naturally finer than the closing screen size.  
The "Overall Including Fines" BWi value is the proportionally recombined (based on mass split) BWi's for the coarse and fines fractions.

Additional CWi tests were not conducted due to limited material availability that meet the testwork rock size 
requirement.

Te in MC-1 and MC-2 is associated with Au-Bi-Te, Au-Ag-Te, Muthmannite, Petzite and Calaverite.  Based on the 
number of grains observed, MC-1 contains 26.3% of the gold in Calaverite and MC-2 contains 4.15% of the gold 
in Calaverite. 

Te Assay Analysis on Old Pulp Samples 

Te assays were analysed on pulps from the 2016 variability testwork to identify possible areas of Calaverite in 
the geological model.  SGS was only able to provide Te analysis at a detection limit of 4 g/t Au.  Results higher 
than the detection limit were linked back to their corresponding drillholes as shown in Table 13.32.

Gravity Separation Testwork  

Gravity separation testwork was conducted on MC-1 and MC-2 using a Knelson concentrator coupled with a 
Mozley laboratory separator to generate material for grind calibration and for downstream testwork such as pH 
neutralization, rheology and cyanidation tests.  Initially, one test was conducted on MC-1 and two were 
conducted on MC-2.  The results showed gravity recoverable gold at 19.2% for MC-1 (Test No. G2) and 18.8% 
and 4.9% for MC-2 (Tests No. G1 and G3, respectively). 

Additional gravity separation tests were later conducted to generate material for the leach optimization 
testwork.  The results showed gravity recoverable gold at 25.7% for MC-1 (Test No. G4), and 15.2% and 19.0% 
for MC-2 (Tests No. G3R and G5, respectively). 

pH Neutralization Testwork 

pH neutralization tests are performed by adding Milk of lime to the MC-1 and MC-2 slurries.  Boto site water 
was used in grinding both of the composites and in preparing the Milk of lime during this testwork.  The results 
from the pH neutralization testwork are shown in Figure 13.28. 

Figure 13.28 SGS 2017/2018 pH Neutralization Testwork 

 

The Boto site water, and MC-1 and MC-2 slurries reacted well to the lime addition as seen in Figure 13.28.  The 
figure also shows the results for a problematic site water in the grey line as a benchmark.  Excess lime 
consumption is not expected during the testwork and the downstream tests should be able to maintain pH 10.5 
to 11.0 for the pulp.

Rheology Testwork 

Rheology tests were conducted on two gravity tailings samples, G1 and G2.  The G1 sample represents MC-2 
gravity tailings, while the G2 sample represents MC-1's.  The main objective of this testwork is to determine the 
maximum solids density that each slurry can be operated safely at.  Figure 13.29 and Figure 13.30 show plots of 
solids density versus yield stress for both G2 and G1 samples, respectively.

Grind Optimization Testwork 

The grind optimization testwork series included four tests on G3 (MC-2) at targeted grind P80's of 125 µm, 
106µm, 75 µm and 53 µm.  Only one test at a targeted grind P80 of 75 µm for G1 (MC-1) was conducted as it is 
anticipated that the different targeted grind sizes for saprolitic material has insignificant impact on gold 
extraction.  Figure 13.31 describes the results from the grind optimization testwork. 

Figure 13.31 SGS 2017/2018 Grind Optimization Testwork Results 

 
Note: CN1R to CN4R are repeated tests of the CN1 to CN4 tests due to contamination issues at the laboratory. 

 
As expected, an improvement in leach kinetics and gold extraction is observed in general at decreasing grind 
sizes for MC-2.  A trade-off study was conducted by Lycopodium and the conclusion recommended using a 
targeted grind size of 75 µm.  More details can be found in Section 13.3.2, Grind Size Selection. 

Leach Optimization Testwork 

The leach optimization testwork series were all conducted at the targeted grind size P80 of 75 µm.  The testwork 
included varying lead nitrate concentration, cyanide concentration, pulp density, incorporating pre-aeration/ 
pre-oxygenation, and adding oxygen during leaching to increase the dissolved oxygen level. 

The results for all the leach optimization testwork conducted on gravity tailings are shown in Table 13.33.

Varying the lead nitrate addition was the first set of leach optimization tests.  Figure 13.32 and Figure 13.33 
show plots of the gold extraction at different leach time for Tests No. CN6 to CN10 in comparison to the base 
cases, CN5 and CN3R, for MC-1 and MC-2, respectively.  Based on the results, the addition of lead nitrate 
improved the leach kinetics but did not improve the gold extraction significantly.  It was also expected that 
cyanide consumption would decrease, however, this effect was not observed in the results.  It was noted that 
this set of tests encountered evaporation problems possibly due to the use of smaller sample size (i.e., 500 g) in 
an attempt to conserve sample mass.  Later tests conducted all used standard sample mass size of 1,000 g.

Additional leach optimization tests were conducted using standard sample mass size of 1,000 g to repeat a few 
of the lead nitrate tests and also to study the effect of pre-aeration, pre-oxygenation, and addition of oxygen 
during leaching.  The results for Tests No. CN11 to CN27 are plotted in Figure 13.34 and Figure 13.35 with 
comparison to the new base cases, CN17 and CN11, for MC-1 and MC-2, respectively.

MC-1 gold extractions are consistently high, ranging from 90 % to 92%.  The addition of lead nitrate, and 
addition of oxygen in the pre-treatment step and during leaching provided insignificant improvement to the 
gold extraction for MC-1.  However, improvement is seen in the leach kinetics during the initial leach period.  
There were also no improvement in the cyanide consumption. 

MC-2 overall gold extractions improved by an estimated 1.8% with the addition of lead nitrate and oxygen.  The 
leach kinetics were also significantly more rapid indicating that the leach time can essentially be decreased from 
48 hours to 36 hours, and possibly even as low as 24-hours.  Lead nitrate addition of 200 g/t Au provided better 
leach performance than the test with lead nitrate added at 75 g/t Au (i.e., CN20 versus CN22).  Adding oxygen 
mixed with air instead of only air during leaching also provided better leach performance as seen in CN20 vs. 
CN25.  Lastly, cyanide consumption was seen to be reduced by approximately 50% or more with the addition of 
lead nitrate and oxygen. 

Cyanide concentrate was varied for one of the MC-2 leach tests.  Figure 13.36 shows the comparison between 
CN20 and CN21 where one had 0.5 g/L NaCN at the start and maintained at 0.35 g/L NaCN throughout the test, 
and the other had 0.35 g/L NaCN at the start and maintained at 0.25 g/L NaCN throughout the test.  The leach 
performance was very similar between the two tests with CN20 only slightly better.  However, it was also noted 
that some tests showed signs of negative effect when the cyanide concentration dropped below 0.35 g/L by 
accident, hence, it was agreed that instructions for the lab technicians should be changed to dropping cyanide 
concentration to 0.4 g/L prior to topping up to avoid going below the 0.35 g/L level again.

A set of leach conditions was agreed upon prior to starting the pulp density optimization leach tests (CN28 to 
CN31) and those conditions were as follows: 

•  Pulp pH at 10.5 to 11 and temperature at 35 °C maintained. 

• Pre-treatment with air and oxygen mixture for 4 hours, with lead nitrate addition at 200 g/t. 

• Air/oxygen mixture addition during leaching to maintain a dissolved oxygen level at ~15 mg/L. 

• Maintain 0.5 g/L NaCN at start of test and drop to 0.4 g/L before topping up. 

The effect on gold extraction from varying pulp densities are shown in Figure 13.37 and Figure 13.38.

As seen in Figure 13.37 and Figure 13.38, both MC-1 and MC-2 gravity tailings showed slower leach kinetics with 
increasing pulp densities, however, the overall gold extractions were not impacted as significantly.  It was later 
suggested by SGS that conducting the pulp density leach tests on whole ore could yield different results from 
the tests conducted on gravity tailings.  Consequently, three additional pulp density leach tests were later 
conducted and the results are presented as part of the whole ore cyanidation testwork section. 

The pulp density selected for use in subsequent tests is 40% solids for MC-1 and 50% solids for MC-2. 

Mineralogy Analysis on Gravity Tailings and Leach Residues 

The mineralogy analysis on MC-1 and MC-2 gravity tailings and their leach residues is summarized in Table 
13.34 and Table 13.35.  The gold in the residue is mainly locked with Calaverite.

Oxygen Uptake Testwork 

Oxygen uptake tests were conducted on MC-1 and MC-2 gravity tailings to estimate the rate at which oxygen is 
consumed in the slurry.  Refer to Figure 13.39 and Figure 13.40 for details. 

Figure 13.39 SGS 2017/2018 Oxygen Uptake Results for MC-1 

 

Figure 13.40 SGS 2017/2018 Oxygen Uptake Results for MC-2 

 

The industry rule of thumb for oxygen uptake rate is 0.04 mg/L/min for saprolitic ore and 0.10 mg/L/min for 
primary ore (fresh rock).  A low oxygen uptake rate indicates that conventional air sparging will be suitable 
while a high rate indicates that oxygen sparging will be required. 

Based on the results, oxygen is consumed on average at a rate of 0.123 mg/L for MC-1 and 0.135 mg/L for MC-
2, which is considered to be on the higher end of the range, hence, sparging with oxygen is recommended.

with carbon added are very similar to the ones conducted with no carbon. 

 
Extended Gravity Recoverable Gold (E-GRG) and Gravity Circuit Modelling by FLSmidth 

E-GRG test was conducted on MC-2 composite to determine the gravity-recoverable gold (GRG) number. The 
results from the E-GRG test is presented in Table 13.37 and the GRG number was determined to be 39.6.

FLSmidth was consulted by SGS to conduct a gravity circuit modelling exercise.  The three stage E-GRG test 
ground the sample to 47 µm, however, the plant is expected to grind the ore to 75 µm, thus there will be less 
GRG liberated at this coarser grind.  FLSmidth used the "as-tested" data and adjusted them to predict the "grind 
adjusted" three stage cumulative curves in Figure 13.41.

Figure 13.41 SGS/FLSmidth Cumulative Three Stage GRG as a Function of Particle Size 

 

Based on FLSmidth's assessment, the GRG number is moderate but the majority of the GRG is classified as "very 
fine" on the AMIRA gold grain size classification scale. 

A gravity circuit model was generated based on the E-GRG results and plant inputs, and the results are 
presented in Table 13.38. 

Table 13.38 FLSmidth Gravity Circuit Modelling Results 

 

According to the assessment done by FLSmidth, the amenability for gravity recovery is low and it will be difficult 
to recover the very fine GRG at full scale.  Based on the current E-GRG results, FLSmidth concluded that the 
benefits to having a gravity circuit for the Boto project will be limited and thus it is not recommended. 

Whole Ore Cyanidation Testwork 

In order to confirm that a gravity circuit has limited benefits to the overall gold extraction, whole ore 
cyanidation tests were conducted on both MC-1 and MC-2.  The results for the whole ore leach tests are 
presented in Table 13.39.  One gravity tailings leach test for each composite is also included in the table for 
comparison purposes.

The following observations can be made from the whole ore leach tests: 

• MC-1 overall gold extraction at 36-hours was similar for whole ore leaching compared to the leach 
results for gravity tailings (CN26 versus CN32, Figure 13.42). 

• MC-2 overall gold extraction at 36 hours was similar for whole ore leaching compared to the leach 
results for gravity tailings (CN20 versus CN33, CN48, & CN95, Figure 13.43). 

• The results for whole ore leaching using site water and using stirred reactor were similar to the 
results for whole ore leach with tap water. 

• The results for whole ore leaching at the finer grind (P80 51µm) showed 2% to 3% improvement in the 
gold extraction (Average of CN33, CN48, & CN95 vs CN72, Figure 13.44). 

• The results for whole ore leaching at varying pulp densities for MC-2 showed that leach kinetics 
during the initial leach period is less rapid as the pulp density increases.  The overall gold extraction at 
36 hours for MC-2 was not impacted significantly at the different pulp densities tested.  Refer to 
CN114 to CN116 in Figure 13.45.

Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP) Modelling 

In order to perform CIP modelling, results from leach kinetics testwork, carbon absorption isotherm testwork, 
and carbon absorption kinetics testwork are required.  Figure 13.46 to Figure 13.48 illustrate the results from 
these tests.

The CIP modelling results are shown in Table 13.40.  Based on the modelling results, the currently selected daily 
carbon advancement rate of 5 tpd will be adequate for the Boto project.  The various scenarios demonstrated 
that the carbon advancement rate can be lowered to as low as 2.5 tpd if operated more aggressively by allowing 
carbon to load a higher amount of gold.

Cyanide Detoxification Testwork 

The current plant design does not include a cyanide detoxification circuit, however, cyanide detoxification tests 
were conducted to provide results for designing this circuit in case this option is considered in the future. 

Cyanide detoxification testwork was conducted for MC-2 using the SO2/Air method, and the results are 
presented in Table 13.41.

(2) Cu added using CuSO4 • 5H2O 
(3) Samples were submitted for distillation method analyses when picric acid method indicates <1 m/L CNWAD. 
 

The 4.7 g SO2 / g CNWAD, added in CND 1-1 is the standard starting dosage after initial batch treatment to the 
approximate detoxification target.  Running at that concentration resulted in a gradual increase in CNWAD 
content from 0.02 mg/L (CND 1 Batch Test) to >11 mg/L (CND 1-1). 

A moderate increase in SO2 dosage to ~5.9 g/g CNWAD was required to achieve a CNWAD level of <1 mg/L (by 
picric acid method) in test CND 1-2. 

Eliminating Cu (often required to catalyze the reaction) and running at a similar SO2 dosage yielded a similar 
CNWAD level of <1 mg/L (by picric acid method) in test CND 1-3. 
 
Variability Testwork (2018) 

A total 76 samples were submitted for whole ore cyanidation testwork.  Table 13.42 shows the type of lithology 
that the samples were associated with, along with the sample count, and ranges of gold head grades.

13.2.2 2018 Solids-Liquid Settling Testwork 

Solids-liquid testwork were conducted at both Outotec and Pocock testing facilities.  The purpose of this 
testwork is to investigate the most effective type of flocculant, flocculant dosing rates, and the solids flux or 
loading rates for thickener sizing. 

Outotec Testwork 

The samples submitted to Outotec were SAP and MC-2 with targeted grind P80 of 75µm.  The flocculant 
screening results for SAP and MC-2 are presented in Figure 13.49 and Figure 13.50, respectively.

The flocculant with the best overall performance for both composites was SNF 926 VHM as it provided the 
clearest overflow at the lowest dosages. 

The dynamic thickening test results are presented in Table 13.45 and Table 13.46.

Based on the dynamic thickening results, Outotec recommended sizes of thickeners for both pre-leach and 
post-leach in the case that a tailings thickening option is required in the future.  The thickener sizes in Table 
13.47 and Table 13.48 are based on MC-2 composite with only limited feed from the SAP composite. 

Table 13.47  Outotec 2018 Recommended Pre-leach Thickener Size and Flocculant Dosage 

 

Table 13.48 Outotec 2018 Recommended Pre-leach Thickener Size and Flocculant Dosage 

 

During the FS phase, the plant through increased from 2.5 Mtpa to 2.75 Mtpa, hence the mill feed rate became 
341 t/h of dry solids instead of the 310 t/h indicated in the Outotec report.  Based on this throughput increase, 
the recommended thickener diameter for the pre-leach thickener and tailings thickener would be 18 m and 27 
m, respectively.  The pre-leach thickener diameter is currently designed at 23 m to prevent a possible 
bottleneck from occurring at this unit operation.  The tailings thickener is currently not included in the design. 

Note that a lower flocculant dosage of 10 g/t Au can also be used as the tests conducted at this lower dosage 
showed similar results to ones conducted at 15 g/t Au.  Refer to Figure 13.51 for details.

Pocock Testwork 

The samples submitted to Pocock were MC-1 (slightly modified) and MC-2 with targeted grind P80 of 53 µm.  
MC-1 was slightly modified by adding a small portion of new saprolite material to make up sufficient mass for 
the testwork requirement.  The flocculant screening results are presented in Table 13.49.  Based on Pocock's 
observation, many types of flocculants responded well, however, SNF AN 905 SH was shown to produce a 
slightly more robust floccule structure than the other types tested.

13.3 Results Interpretation 

The sections to follow describes the main testwork results that contributed towards the development of the 
process flow diagrams and process design criteria. 

13.3.1 Comminution Parameters 

OMC compiled and analysed all comminution testwork data based on the lithology weighted average values per 
weathering type.  The weighted average bond grindability and JK parameters are presented in Table 13.52.

13.3.2 Grind Size Selection 

Cyanidation tests were conducted on both gravity tailings and whole ore samples at the finer grind size 
(targeted P80 53µm) as seen in Figure 13.52. 

Figure 13.52 Review of Cyanidation Tests at Varying Grind P80 

 

The results for the finer grind, ~P80 53µm, yielded 2% to 3% higher gold extraction than the results for grind P80 
75 µm.  A grind size trade-off study was conducted by Lycopodium (Memorandum No. 5084-MEM-006) to 
assess the benefit of incorporating a regrind milling circuit into the plant design.  The study showed a negative 
NPV and no payback on the IRR for the addition of a regrind circuit. 

The financial analysis was based on a set of inputs which included a base case gold price of $1,200/oz. A 
sensitivity analysis showed that the NPV and IRR becomes positive with a payback at the end of a 10-year mine 
life if gold price becomes $1,250/oz.   

It was concluded that a regrind milling circuit is not justifiable at the base case gold price and is not 
recommended for inclusion in the design at this stage.  However, the plant layout should include provision for 
future installation. 

13.3.3 Gravity Circuit  

A review of all the previous gravity separation results showed that out of 56 tests (from 2013 to 2018), only 
three yielded a GRG close to 35%, one close to 50%, and one Boto 5 sample over 65%.  The overall GRG average 
is at approximately 20%.  This is considered to be on the low end of the GRG range and inclusion of a gravity 
circuit cannot be justified.  Refer to Error! Not a valid bookmark self-reference. for details.

Figure 13.53 Gravity Separation Results from 2013 to 2018 

 

The E-GRG test results combined with the results from whole ore leaching during the SGS 2017/2018 program 
also did not provide justification for including a gravity circuit in the plant design. 

Figure 13.54 Review of SGS 2017/2018 E-GRG Test Results on MC-2 

 

The E-GRG test results as shown in Figure 13.54 indicated that the majority of the GRG amount in MC-2 is 
classified as very fine.  Although the GRG number is considered to be moderate at 39.6, recovery with gravity at 
the full scale would be difficult due to this fine nature and therefore a gravity circuit is not recommended.

Figure 13.55 Review of Whole Ore versus Gravity Tailings Leach Tests 

 

The whole ore leaching results for MC-1 and MC-2, as presented in Figure 13.55, produced similar results to the 
leach tests on gravity tailings.  This further validates the recommendation to omit a gravity circuit from design. 

13.3.4 Pre-treatment and Leach Conditions 

The latest metallurgical program conducted extensive leach optimization testwork (see Table 13.33 in Section 
13.2.1) to determine the ideal pre-treatment and leach conditions for the Project.  The results showed that the 
use of oxygen in pre-treatment and during leaching, along with lead nitrate addition will yield at least 1.8% 
higher gold extraction for MC-2 than if these additions were not considered. Furthermore, the leach kinetics will 
be more rapid, and the cyanide consumption will also be reduced significantly (see Table 13.53). For MC-1 (Boto 
5 Master Composite), the lead nitrate and oxygen addition provided some leach kinetic benefits, but did not 
improve gold extraction.

A trade-off study was conducted by Lycopodium (Memorandum No. 5084-MEM-005) to justify the inclusion of 
the oxygen plant and the lead nitrate system.  The outcomes from this study suggested that inclusion of these 
systems could yield a positive NPV of $15.3M and an IRR of 157%, providing a payback period within the first 
year. 

Other leach conditions recommended based on the results of the leach optimization tests include: 

• Pulp pH at 10.5 to 11 to be maintained with the addition of lime. 

• Pre-treatment with oxygen, and leaching with oxygen spargers to maintain a dissolved oxygen level 
of ~15 mg/L or higher. 

• Lead nitrate addition of 200 g/t ore. 

• Pre-treatment time of 4-hours minimum, and leach time of approximately 36-hours. 

• Cyanide concentration of 0.5 g NaCN/L to be maintained in first leach tank. 

13.3.5 Gold Recovery Models 

Gold Extraction Models 

A relationship between the leach residue and head grades was developed from the SGS 2017/2018 variability 
testwork results. Figure 13.56 and Figure 13.57 illustrate this relationship for the Boto 2/Malikoundi fresh rock 
and saprolite/saprock, respectively. The current cut-off-grade for Boto 2/Malikoundi fresh rock is 0.63 g/t Au, 
therefore the leach results for samples with head grades below 0.5 g/t Au were not used as those materials will 
not likely get mined. Similarly, the current cut-off-grades for the Boto 2/Malikoundi saprolite and saprock are 
0.46 g/t Au and 0.5 g/t Au, respectively, therefore leach results for samples with head grades below 0.25 g.t Au 
were not used as those materials will also not likely get mined.

Since MC-1 (Boto 5 Master Composite) showed little gold extraction benefit from lead nitrate and oxygen 
addition, a combination of old and new test results as seen in Table 13.54 were used to plot the Boto 5 
saprolite/saprock gold extraction model in Figure 13.58. Note that the current cut-off grades for Boto 5 
saprolite and saprock are 0.48 g/t Au and 0.49 g/t Au, respectively, therefore leach results for samples with 
head grades below 0.25 g/t Au were not used as those materials will not likely get mined.

Figure 13.58 Gold Extraction Model for Boto 5 Saprolite/Saprock 

 

The lowest leach residue grade assayed in the variability testwork was 0.02 g/t Au, hence, Lycopodium 
considered this to be the lowest leach residue grade that can realistically be achieved during cyanidation.  The 
extraction equations shown in Figure 13.56, Figure 13.57 and Figure 13.58 should then be bounded by a lower 
limit of head grade so that each equation does not give a residue grade less than 0.02 g/t Au. 

The following calculations were used to determine the lower limit ("x" is head grade and "y" is residue): 

Boto 2/Malikoundi Fresh Rock          y = 0.1204 x 0.828       0.02 = 0.1204 x 0.828      x = 0.12 g/t Au. 

Boto 2/Malikoundi Saprolite/Saprock    y = 0.0695 x 0.928   0.02 = 0.0695 x 0.928   x = 0.27 g/t Au. 

Boto 5 Saprolite/Saprock                y = 0.0681 x 0.897     0.02 = 0.0681 x 0.897           x = 0.26 g/t Au. 

The lower limit for head grade is calculated to be 0.12 g/t Au and 0.27 g/t Au for Boto 2/Malikoundi fresh rock 
and saprolite/saprock, respectively. The lower limit for Boto 5 saprolite/saprock is calculated to be 0.26 g/t Au. 

Gold Losses Models 

In order to account for gold losses, models for estimating the gold losses by solution were generated based on 
CIP inputs provided by KEMIX.  Refer to Figure 13.59, Figure 13.60, and Figure 13.61 for details.

Gold Recovery Models 

Combining the gold extraction and gold losses models, a gold recovery model can then be generated for the 
Boto 2/Malikoundi fresh rock and saprolite/saprock, and Boto 5 saprolite/saprock. Refer to Figure 13.62, Figure 
13.63 and Figure 13.64 for details.

• Fresh rock, saprolite, and saprock at Boto are readily amenable to whole ore cyanidation. 

• The optimum grind size was determined to be P80 of 75 µm. 

• Gold recovery is predicted to be 88.7% for Boto 2/Malikoundi fresh rock, 92.9% for Boto2/Malikoundi 
saprolite/saprock, and 93.2% for Boto 5 saprolite/saprock, at the design head grade of 1.71 g/t Au. 

• The ore at Boto is not expected to have preg-robbing properties. 

• A pre-oxygenation step with oxygen sparging during leach, combined with lead nitrate addition is 
critical in achieving the maximum possible recovery. 

• Leach extraction rates are essentially completed by 24-hours to 36-hours. 

• Cyanide consumption rates are expected to be low, averaging about 0.13 kg NaCN/t ore. When 
accounting for cyanide residue in CIP tailings, an addition rate of 0.27 kg NaCN/t ore is expected. 

• Lime consumption rates are expected to be moderate, average at 1.64 kg CaO/t ore at the design ore 
blend. When accounting for 85% purity of the supplied lime, and an addition rate of 1.93 kg CaO/t 
ore is expected. 

13.4.2 Recommendations 

Material meeting minimum 3-inch rock size from future drilling activities should be set aside for CWi tests since 
the additional CWi tests planned for in the FS phase were not conducted due to material availability. 

During plant operations, the following items are recommended: 

• Natural cyanide attenuation (free and WAD) be monitored in the tailings storage facility. 

• Site water quality (raw and process) be monitored during the initial wet and dry seasons to document 
the seasonal impact of water quality. 

• Gold adsorption rate and equilibrium loading on carbon be monitored as the plant head grade varies 
during the life of the operation to ensure that carbon movement and management is optimized. 

• Slurry percent solids in the leaching stage be monitored during start-up and operation as this 
parameter could reduce gold extraction if allowed to increase to over 50% solids.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Introduction 

This section discloses the mineral resources for the Project, prepared and disclosed in accordance with the CIM 
Standards and Definitions for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2014).  The QP responsible for these 
resource estimates is Mr. Paul Daigle, P.Geo., Associate Senior Geologist for AGP.  The effective date of this 
mineral resource is May 8, 2018.  

The resource estimate has been prepared using interpreted mineralized veins (domains) for four deposits that 
comprise the Project; these include, in order of priority: Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, Boto 6, and Boto 4 (Figure 
14.1).  The resource estimates were conducted using Geovia GEMS™ 6.8.1 resource estimation software.  The 
blocks models were estimated using inverse distance cubed.

The mineral resources are reported at variable cut-off grades based on alteration zones that vary between 0.37 
g/t Au and 0.51 g/t Au.  Gold grades were capped prior to compositing, with capping levels varying between 
1.71 g/t Au and 42.02 g/t Au depending on mineralized zone and sub-domain.  Several mineralized zones did 
not require capping. 

The mineral resources are reported within optimized constraining shells.  The optimized constraining shells 
were developed for each deposit by AGP using Hexagon Mining MineSight 3D and incorporates metal recovery, 
geotechnical parameters, and assumed costs for each alteration zone.  The mineral resources are classified as 
Indicated Resources or Inferred Resources in accordance with the CIM Definitions of Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves (2014).

• Capping of grades varied between 1.71 g/t Au and 42.02 g/t Au on raw assays by mineralized zone or sub-domain; 
• The density varies between 1.70 g/cm3 and 2.76 g/cm3 depending on alteration zone. 

The mineral resources for the Boto project include the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, and Boto 6 deposits.    The 
Boto 4 deposit is currently not classified as mineral resources because the deposit is situated within a 500 m 
exclusion zone of the Balinko River (the border of Senegal and Mali) and underneath the village of Guémédji.  
Should the 500 m zone be reduced or lifted the Boto 4 deposit will be re-evaluated. 

14.1.1 Database 

The database was provided by IAMGOLD on November 23, 2017 and updated on April 15, 2018 and is 
comprised of diamond drill holes (DDH) and reverse circulation (RC) drill holes completed up to March 2018.  All 
drill holes were positioned on a local grid and the final collar coordinates were surveyed using a DGPS system 
using the UTM WGS 84 datum.  The current database consists of 784 drill holes (410 DDH and 375 RC) totalling 
approximately 126,429 m, where 565 of the drill holes are used in the current resource estimates, totalling 
102,442 m.  A summary of the drill holes is listed in Table 14.2 below.

AGP received the database as a GEMS project for all deposits of the Project.  The database was made up of 
several tables that included, but are not limited to, collar, survey, assay, lithology, alteration, and structural 
mineralization (including oriented core information and principal textures).  The GEMS validation tool was used 
to verify the database for the collar, survey, assay, and lithology and alteration tables; there were no errors 
found. 

As described in Section 12 of this report, AGP reviewed approximately 12% of the assay database distributed 
over the four deposits and made a comparison with the results found in the assay certificates issued by the 
laboratory.  No errors found.  The author is of the opinion that the database is adequate for the purposes of 
mineral resource estimation for the Project.

14.2 MALIKOUNDI/BOTO 2 

14.2.1 Geological Interpretation 

In order to carry out mineral resource estimation at the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit, mineralized zones were 
interpreted by IAMGOLD's on-site geologists.  The interpreted mineralized wireframes were completed using 
conventional polylines on vertical sections defined along the 50 m to 100 m spaced drill fences and matched 
section by section for better continuity.  The rings were snapped to the assay 'From's' and 'To's' and 
subsequently, were connected by tie lines to create a 3-dimensional (3D) solid wireframe. 

In January 2018 and April 2018, the eight solid wireframes that represent the mineralized zones for the 
Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit were updated by IAMGOLD geologists based on most recent drill information.  A 
minimum true thickness of 3 m to 4 m was used in modelling the various mineralized zones.  The interpreted 
mineralized envelopes were used to capture a minimum nominal grade of 0.15 g/t Au, supported by geology, 
strong alteration, and a larger concentration of sulphide minerals, mainly pyrite.  True thickness of these 
mineralized envelopes varies between < 2 m and 119 m, with an average of 20 m.  Several short intervals exist 
where drilling was stopped within a mineralized zone.  The statistical evaluation of the gold assays, capping and 
compositing, was carried out based on these interpreted mineralized zones. 

The geological models used for the current mineral resources for Malikoundi/Boto 2 are shown in Figure 14.2.

The eight 3D wireframes were considered by AGP as a good representation of the mineralized structures 
present and were accepted by AGP.  No triangulation errors existed in any of the wireframes reviewed.  In order 
to undertake the estimation of the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit, two of the larger wireframes (MZ-04-06 and MZ-
09-10) were divided into sub-domains to avoid the influence of the neighbouring parallel zones.   

Table 14.3 shows the mineralized zones and their corresponding rock codes and sub-domain codes.  Figure 14.3 
illustrates the eight interpreted mineralized wireframes.  Figure 14.4 identifies the sub-domains for MZ-04-06 
and MZ-09-10.

Alteration Surfaces 

The alteration surfaces were modelled by IAMGOLD geologists and were updated in April 2018 based on the 
most recent drill information.  The alteration surfaces distinguish the zones of tropical weathering for laterite, 
saprolite, transition (or saprock), and fresh rock.  The alteration zones for laterite, saprolite, and transition do 
represent a large part of the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit.  The laterite zone is generally barren of gold 
mineralization and is excluded from mineral resources.  Each block is coded into the block model based on a 
50/50 rule. 

In order to capture some of the cuirass layer (also known as Ferrocrete or hardpan layer of laterite) AGP 
modelled the cuirass based on the descriptions in the drill hole database.  This model was used to capture a 
possible volume of cuirass that may be used as construction material within the laterite zone.  The laterite and 
cuirass zones are not considered for mineral resources.

Capping Analysis 

To reduce the influence of outliers on the average grade, and the co-efficient of variation (CV) of the sample 
populations, a capping analysis in the form of decile analyses, disintegration analyses, histogram, and 
cumulative plots were used to assess the sample populations of gold grade outliers within each of the 
mineralized zones and sub-domains for Malikoundi/Boto 2. 

Table 14.7 shows the capping levels and number of values affected for each of the mineralized zones and sub-
domains.

Composites 

After capping the raw assay values, the raw assay values were composited to 2 m intervals within the 
interpreted mineralized zone wireframe.  The composites were adjusted along the drill hole to avoid remnants 
at the hanging wall or foot wall of the mineralized zone.   

A nominal composite length of 2 m was selected which was at or above the 75th percentile of the raw assay 
sampling length. Composites were generated downward from the collar of the hole within the mineralized 
wireframes. Composites length were adjusted to avoid un-representative remnants at the wireframe 
boundaries where the minimum composition length is 1 m. Capping was applied to the raw assays prior to 
compositing. Table 14.9 shows the descriptive statistics of the capped 2 m composite values by mineralized 
zone and sub-domain.  Descriptive statistics for all raw assays and composite lengths are shown in Table 14.9 
and Table 14.10. Figure 14.8 presents the box plot of the capped 2 m composite values by mineralized zone and 
sub-domain.

14.2.3 Block Model 

The block model for the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit was set up with a block matrix of 5 m long by 10 m long by 5 
m high.  The block model is not rotated, with the elongated blocks aligned to the preferred mainly north-south 
strike of the deposit.  The block matrix was selected as appropriate for the 50 m x 50 m drill pattern and the 
block height was selected in consideration of a medium sized open pit operation.  Table 14.11 summarizes the 
block model parameters and Figure 14.9 presents the block model over the interpreted mineralized zones for 
the Malikoundi/Boto 2 Deposit.

Grade Interpolation  

The block model was interpolated in two passes.  The gold grades were estimated using the 2 m composites 
using the inverse distance cubed (ID3) interpolation (anisotropic) method.  This method was selected due as 
there were no reasonable variograms obtained for the individual mineralized zones.  The block model was also 
interpolated using ID2 and NN interpolation methods for validation purposes.  Table 14.12 shows estimation 
parameters for each pass used to estimate gold grades.

Search Ellipses  

The search ellipses used for the Malikoundi/Boto 2 block model interpolation used similar ranges as in the 
previous resource estimates in consideration of the regular 50 m x 50 m drill pattern and their intersections of 
the mineralized zones.  Search ellipses were oriented in alignment with the interpreted mineralized zones and 
sub-domains.   

In the mineralized zone MZ03, there are three shifts in orientation of the zone, from north to south.  To better 
estimate this zone, three separate search ellipses were used on selected blocks in the north, centre, and south 
portions of this zone.  In the mineralized zone MZ09-10, there were two changes in orientation of the zone.  To 
better estimate these zones, two search ellipses were used on selected blocks in the north portion of MZ09 and 
south portion of MZ10.   

Table 14.13 lists the search ellipse parameters used to estimate the Malikoundi/Boto 2 Deposit.

14.2.4 Validation 

The Malikoundi/Boto 2 block model and resource estimate was validated by the methods described below.  
AGP is satisfied that the block model gold grades reflect the gold grades from the drill core samples.

Visual Validation  

The block model was validated by visually inspecting the block model results on section to compare with the 
drill hole composite data. The grades of the blocks by section agreed well with the composite data used in the 
interpolation.  Figure 14.10 presents a selected cross-section (1379005N) that shows the gold grades in blocks 
with the gold grades from the 2 m composites.

Swath Plots 

AGP interpolated gold grades using the ID3, ID2, and NN interpolation methods and compared the grades of 
blocks to the 2 m composites along a particular swath of the block model.  The comparison shows no apparent 
local bias. In the charts, the composite line is generally above the interpolated grade and the peaks and valleys 
are well represented in the block model which also display normal smoothing of the composite data.  Figure 
14.11, Figure 14.12, and Figure 14.13 show the swath plots for the selected mineralized zone, MZ04-06, in the 
Malikoundi/Boto 2 Deposit by Easting, Northing, and Elevation respectively.

14.3 BOTO 5 

14.3.1 Geological Interpretation  

In order to carry out mineral resource estimation at the Boto 5 deposit, five mineralized zones were interpreted 
by IAMGOLD's on-site geologists.  The interpreted mineralized wireframes were completed using 3D rings on 
vertical sections along the 50 m to 100 m spaced drill fences and matched for better continuity.  The rings were 
snapped to the assay 'From's' and 'To's' and subsequently, connected by tie lines to create a 3D solid 
wireframe. 

In August 2017, the five solid wireframes that represent the mineralized zones were updated by IAMGOLD 
geologists based on the most recent drill information.  A minimum true thickness of 3 m to 4 m was used in 
modelling the various mineralized zones.  The interpreted mineralized envelopes were used to capture a 
minimum nominal grade of 0.15 g/t Au supported by geology, strong alteration, and a larger concentration of 
sulphide minerals, mainly pyrite.  True thickness of these mineralized envelopes varies between 2 m and 50 m, 
with an average of 11 m.  The statistical evaluation of the gold assays, capping, and compositing was carried out 
based on these interpreted mineralized zones. 

The five 3D wireframes were considered by AGP as a good representation of the mineralized structures present 
and were accepted by AGP.  No triangulation errors existed in any of the wireframes reviewed.    

Figure 14.14 shows a cross section (B5_1000N) of the five mineralized zones.  Table 14.15 lists the five 
mineralized zones and their corresponding rock codes.

It was observed that a portion of the surface of the Boto 5 deposit and surroundings have been affected by 
ongoing small scale artisanal mining.  In order to account for these workings, two 3D wireframes were 
constructed using the topographic Lidar surface, which captured the majority of these surface workings.  With 
this information, two portions of the topographic surface were clipped out (west and east) and copied 5 m 
below surface.  Two wireframes were built between these two sets of surfaces to represent material removed 
or condemned by the artisanal workings.  Figure 14.15 shows the five mineralized zones and the two areas of 
artisanal workings.

Alteration Surfaces 

The alteration surfaces were modelled by IAMGOLD geologists and were updated based on the most recent drill 
information.  The alteration surfaces distinguish the zones of tropical weathering for laterite, saprolite, 
transition (or saprock), and fresh rock for purposes of assigning density and or the optimization of the 
constraining shell.  The laterite zone is generally barren of gold mineralization and is excluded from mineral 
resources.  Each block is coded into the block model based on a 50/50 rule. 

Table 14.16 lists the alteration codes for the resources model.  Figure 14.16 presents a cross-section, B5_1000N, 
of the alteration zones for Boto 5.

Capping Analysis 

To reduce the influence of outliers on the average grade and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the sample 
populations, a capping analysis in the form of decile analyzes, disintegration analyzes, histogram, and 
cumulative probability plots were used to assess the sample populations of gold grade outliers within each of 
the mineralized zones for Boto 5.  Table 14.18 shows the capping levels and number of values affected for each 
mineralized zone.  Table 14.19 shows descriptive statistics for the capped assay values by mineralized zone.

Composites 

A nominal composite length of 2 m was selected which was at or above the 75th percentile of the raw assay 
sampling length. Composites were generated downward from the collar of the hole within the mineralized 
wireframes. Composites length were adjusted to avoid un-representative remnants at the wireframe 
boundaries where the minimum composition length is 1 m. Capping was applied to the raw assays prior to 
compositing.  Table 14.20 shows the descriptive statistics of the capped 2 m composite values by mineralized 
zone.  Figure 14.18 presents the box plot of the capped 2 m composite values by mineralized zone.

14.3.3 Block Model 

The block model for the Boto 5 deposit was set up with a block matrix of 5 m long by 5 m long by 5 m high.  The 
block model is rotated -28.5° (clockwise), with the elongated blocks aligned to the preferred mainly north-south 
strike of the deposit.  The block matrix was selected as appropriate for the 50 m x 50 m drill pattern and the 
block height was selected in consideration of a medium sized open pit operation. Table 14.21 summarizes the 
block model parameters and Figure 14.19 presents the block model over the interpreted mineralized zones for 
the Boto 5 deposit.

Search Ellipses  

The search ellipses used for the Malikoundi/Boto 2 block model interpolation used similar ranges as in the 
previous resource estimates in consideration of the regular 50 m x 50 m drill pattern and their intersections of 
the mineralized zones.  Search ellipses were oriented in alignment with the interpreted mineralized zones.  
MZ04 in the northeast has a different alignment than in the southwest and separate interpolation was made for 
selected blocks in this zone.   

Table 14.23 lists the search ellipse parameters used to estimate the Boto 5 deposit.

14.3.4 Validation 

The Boto 5 block model and resource estimate was validated by the methods described below.  AGP is satisfied 
that the block model gold grades reflect the gold grades from the drill core samples. 

Visual Validation  

The block model was validated by visually inspecting the block model results on section, to compare with the 
drill hole composite data. The grades of the blocks by section agreed well with the composite data used in the 
interpolation.  Figure 14.20 presents a selected cross-section (B5_0950E) that shows the gold grades in blocks 
with the gold grades from the 2 m composites.

Statistics 

AGP reviewed the statistics for the mineralized zones and sub-domains for Boto 5 and generally found no bias 
between the different interpolation methods and the 2 m composites.  It is noted that the de-clustered mean 
(from NN), for the MZ03 and MZ06, is closer to interpolated grades than the overall mean of the 2 m 
composites, in part, due to the lower sample density in these mineralized zones.  Table 14.24 shows the average 
gold grades (no zeroes) of the mineralized zone for the Boto 5 deposit.

Swath Plots 

AGP interpolated gold grades using the ID3, ID2, and NN interpolation methods and compared the grades of 
blocks to the 2 m composites along a particular swath of the block model.  The comparison shows no apparent 
bias.  It has been noted that the NN plot is more skewed than the ID interpolation plots due to limited sample 
support.  Figure 14.21, Figure 14.22, and Figure 14.23 show the swath plots for the selected mineralized zone, 
MZ04, in the Boto 5 deposit by Easting, Northing, and Elevation respectively.

14.4 BOTO 6 

14.4.1 Geological Interpretation  

In order to carry out mineral resource estimation at the Boto 6 deposit, two mineralized zones were interpreted 
by IAMGOLD's on-site geologists.  The interpreted mineralized wireframes were completed using 3D rings on 
vertical sections along the 50 m to 100 m spaced drill fences and matched for better continuity.  The rings were 
snapped to the assay 'From's' and 'To's' and subsequently connected by tie lines to create a 3D solid wireframe. 

In 2017, the interpreted mineralized zones were updated by IAMGOLD geologists based on most recent drill 
information.  A minimum thickness of 3 m to 4 m was used in modelling the various mineralized zones.  The 
interpreted mineralized envelopes were used to capture a minimum nominal grade of 0.15 g/t Au supported by 
geology, strong alteration, and a larger concentration of sulphide minerals, mainly pyrite.  The statistical 
evaluation of the gold assays, capping, and compositing was carried out based on these interpreted mineralized 
zones.  

The two 3D wireframes were considered by AGP as a good representation of the mineralized structures present 
and were accepted by AGP.  No triangulation errors existed in any of the wireframes reviewed.    

Figure 14.24 presents the two mineralized zones for the Boto 6 deposit.  Table 14.25 lists the mineralized zones 
and rock codes.

Alteration Surfaces  

The alteration surfaces were modelled by IAMGOLD geologists and were updated based on the most recent drill 
information.  The alteration surfaces distinguish the zones of tropical weathering for laterite, saprolite, 
transition (or saprock), and fresh rock for purposes of assigning density, and/or the optimization of the 
constraining shell.  The laterite zone is generally barren of gold mineralization and is excluded from mineral 
resources.  Each block is coded into the block model based on a 50/50 rule. 

Table 14.26 lists the alteration codes for the resources model.  Figure 14.25 presents a cross-section, E1645N, of 
the alteration zones for Boto 6.

Capping Analysis 

To reduce the influence outliers on the average grade and the co-efficient of variation of the sample 
populations, a capping analysis in the form of decile analyses, disintegration analyses, histogram, and 
cumulative probability plots was used to assess the sample populations of gold grade outliers within each of the 
mineralized zones and sub-domains for Boto 6.  Table 14.4.4 shows the capping levels and number of values 
affected for each mineralized zone.  Table 14.28 shows descriptive statistics for the capped assay values by 
mineralized zone.

Composites 

A nominal composite length of 2 m was selected which was at or above the 75th percentile of the raw assay 
sampling length. Composites were generated downward from the collar of the hole within the mineralized 
wireframes. Composites length were adjusted to avoid un-representative remnants at the wireframe 
boundaries where the minimum composition length is 1 m. Capping was applied to the raw assays prior to 
compositing.  Table 14.29 shows the descriptive statistics of the capped 2 m composite values.  Figure 14.27 
presents the box plot of the capped 2 m composite values.

Swath Plots 

AGP interpolated gold grades using the ID3, ID2, and NN interpolation methods and compared the grades of 
blocks to the 2 m composites along a particular swath of the block model.  The comparison shows no apparent 
bias.  It is noted that the NN plot is more skewed than the ID interpolation plots in the south end of Boto 6 due 
to limited sample support in this area.  Figure 14.30, Figure 14.31, and Figure 14.32 show the swath plots for the 
selected mineralized zone, MZ-Main, in the Boto 6 deposit by Easting, Northing and Elevation respectively.

14.5 BOTO 4 

14.5.1 Geological Interpretation 

The Boto 4 deposit consists of a single interpreted mineralized zone.  The 3D wireframe used to represent the 
Boto 4 deposit was interpreted for the June 2015 Resource Estimate and has not been subject to further drilling 
since.  The 3D wireframe was considered by AGP as a good representation of the mineralized structure present 
and was accepted by AGP.  No triangulation errors existed in any of the wireframes reviewed.    Table 14.34 lists 
the Rock Code used for the wireframe.  Figure 14.33 presents the interpreted mineralized wireframe for the 
Boto 4 deposit.

Alteration Surfaces 

The alteration surfaces were modelled by IAMGOLD geologists to distinguish between the laterite, saprolite, 
transition (or saprock), and fresh rock.  These surfaces were used to analyse and assign density to the block 
model and, in the optimization of the constraining shell.  The laterite is generally barren are not considered as

Composites 

A nominal composite length of 2 m was selected which was at or above the 75th percentile of the raw assay 
sampling length. Composites were generated downward from the collar of the hole within the mineralized 
wireframes. Composites length were adjusted to avoid un-representative remnants at the wireframe 
boundaries where the minimum composition length is 1 m. Capping was applied to the raw assays prior to 
compositing.  Table 14.38 shows the descriptive statistics of the capped composite values.  Figure 14.36 shows

14.5.3 Block Model 

For the current resource estimation of Boto 4, a block matrix of 5 m length x 5 m width x 4 m height was used.  
The block model is rotated 25° clockwise in the orientation of the drill fences.  The summary of the block model 
parameters is shown in Table 14.39.  Figure 14.37 shows the block model over the interpreted mineralized zone 
at Boto 4.

Grade Interpolation  

The block model was interpolated in two passes.  The gold grades were estimated using the 2 m composites 
using ID3 interpolation method (true).  The block model was also interpolated using ID2 and NN interpolation 
methods for validation purposes.  Table 14.40 shows estimation parameters for each pass used to estimate gold 
grades.

Search Ellipses  

The search ellipses used for the Boto 4 block model interpolation used the same ranges as the Boto 4 deposit in 
consideration of the regular 50 m x 50 m drill pattern and their intersections of the mineralized zones.  Search 
ellipses were aligned to the interpreted mineralized zone.  Table 14.41 presents the search ellipse parameters 
for the Boto 4 deposit.

14.5.4 Validation 

The Boto 4 block model and resource estimate was validated by the methods described below.  AGP is satisfied 
the block model gold grades reflect the gold grades from the drill core samples. 

Visual Validation  

The block model was validated by visually inspecting the block model results on section to compare with the 
drill hole composite data. The grades of the blocks by section agreed well with the composite data used in the 
interpolation.  Figure 14.38 presents a selected cross-section (E3725N) that shows the gold grades in blocks 
with the gold grades from the 2 m composites.

14.6.1 Density  

Approximately 3,400 measurements were collected for specific gravity from the Project between the 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 6, and Boto 4 deposits.  The majority of measurements were collected from the 
Malikoundi deposit.  A total of 3,282 measurements were used to assign the density values to the block models 
by alteration zone (Weather Code).  Density values were attributed to the block models based on alteration 
zone (Weather Code) using the 50/50 rule.  Table 14.43 presents the descriptive statistics for density values by 
alteration zone.  Figure 14.42 presents the box plot for the density values by alteration zone.

14.6.2 Mineral Resource Classification  

Mineral Resource Classification 

Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by CIM (2014) Standards and 
Definitions. The mineral resources for the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5 and Boto 6 deposits were classified as 
Indicated and Inferred mineral resources and captured within optimized constraining shells. 

Indicated Resources are classified where estimated blocks are situated within the 50 m by 50 m drill hole grid, 
interpolated with a minimum of two drill holes, and nominally within 25 m for the last drill hole.  Inferred 
Resources are classified as blocks estimated with a minimum of two drill holes, with a nominal distance to the 
closest composite of less than 70 m. 

The Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit and Boto 6 deposits are situated in proximity to the Falémé and Balinko Rivers, 
the border of Senegal with Mali.  With respect to prospects of eventual economic extraction, a 500 m offset, or 
exclusion zone, was applied from these rivers edges' as a protected zone.  There are no mineral resources 
declared within the 500 m offset zone. 

14.6.3 Mineral Resources – Malikoundi/Boto 2  

Optimized Constraining Shell and Cut-off Grades 

In order to demonstrate 'reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction' an optimized constraining 
shell was used to report mineral resources for the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit.  The constraining shell was 
developed using Hexagon Mining MineSight® 3D.  Table 14.44 lists the parameters used for the optimized 
constraining shell by alteration zone.

AGP is not aware of any information not already discussed in this report, which would affect their interpretation 
or conclusions regarding the subject property.  AGP is required to inform the public that the quantity and grade 
of reported Inferred resources in this estimation must be regarded as conceptual in nature and are based on 
limited geological evidence and sampling.  The geological evidence is sufficient to imply, but not verify, 
geological grade or quality of continuity.  For these reasons, an Inferred resource has a lower level of confidence 
than an Indicated resource.  It is reasonably expected that most of the Inferred Mineral Resources could be 
upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.  The rounding of values, as required by 
the reporting guidelines, may result in apparent differences between tonnes, grade, and metal content. 

It is also noted that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability.

14.6.6 Mineral Resources – Boto 4 

There are no reported Mineral Resources for the Boto 4 deposit due to the proximity to the Balinko River within 
the 500 m exclusion zone from the river and the situation of the village of Guémédji above the deposit.  Should 
the 500 m offset limit change or be lifted, the block model and mineral resources for the Boto 4 deposit will be 
re-evaluated. 

14.6.7 Mineral Resources – Summary  

The following is a summary of the mineral resources for the Project with an effective date of 8 May 2018.  The 
resources were estimated using Geovia GEMS 6.8.1 resource estimation software. Mineral resources are 
reported within optimized constraining shells using Hexagon Mining MineSight 3D software using a gold price of 
$1500/oz.  Mineralized zones were captured using solid 3D solid wireframes and gold grades were estimated 
within these zones using the ID3 interpolation method.  Cut-off grades vary between 0.37 and 0.51 g/t Au, and 
densities vary between 1.70 and 2.76, depending on alteration zone.  Mineral resources are classified as 
Indicated Resources and Inferred Resources in accordance with the CIM (2014) Standards and Definitions of 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.

Cut-off Grade Sensitivity 

To illustrate the sensitivity to cut-off grade, the Indicated and Inferred mineral resources for the 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5 and Boto 6 deposits, within their constraining shells, were combined and reported as 
grade-tonnage curves (plots) at incremental cut-off grades of 0.1 g/t Au.  The reader is cautioned that these 
grade-tonnage curves are not be taken as the reported mineral resources and serve only to show the sensitivity 
of the block model to selected cut-off grades. 

Figure 14.43 and Figure 14.44 show the grade tonnage curve for the Indicated Resources and the Inferred 
Resources within constraining shells, respectively, at various cut-off grades for the Project.

14.7 PREVIOUS MINERAL RESOURCES  

14.7.1 Previous Mineral Resources 

Since the initial mineral resources were reported on the Project, there has been an overall increase in resource 
tonnes and contained metal.  In the current mineral resource estimate there has been a significant increase in 
overall tonnes and contained metal.  This may be partially attributed to the additional drilling along strike in 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5, and Boto 6 deposits, and at depth at the Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 5 deposits.  
Additionally, in Malikoundi/Boto 2, several mineralized zones have been re-interpreted as being slightly wider 
than the previous resource interpretation and some narrower zones have been included into larger zones.  The 
additional drill information allows for upgrading of more material into the Indicated category from previously 
Inferred resources and increasing the resource tonnes captured by larger optimized constraining shells.  It 
should also be noted that the cut-off grades for the current mineral resources are lower than the previous 
mineral resource.   

Table 14.50 summarizes the mineral resources from 2013 to present.

14.7.2 Malikoundi/Boto 2 

Compared to the previous mineral resource estimate (July 2017), the Malikoundi/Boto 2 mineral resources 
show an increase in overall tonnages and contained metal.  This is due in part to the re-interpretation of the 
mineralized zones, where zones are slightly wider or larger; and have included narrower zones from the 
previous interpretation.  Additional drill hole data from the 2017 and 2018 drill campaigns have also allowed for 
greater confidence and better continuity of geology and grade to allow previously categorized Inferred 
resources to be upgraded to Indicated resources.  The change to a lower set of cut-off grades have also had the 
effect of increasing the mineral resources. 

Table 14.51 presents the comparison of the July 2017 mineral resources to the current mineral resources for the 
Malikoundi/Boto deposit.

14.7.3 Boto 5 

Compared to the previous Mineral Resource Estimate (July 2017), the Boto 5 mineral resources show an 
increase in resource tonnages and contained metal.  This is partially due to the re-interpretation of the 
mineralized zones but also in part due to the addition of drill hole information from the 2017 and 2018 drill 
campaigns that have allowed for greater confidence and better continuity of geology and grade to allow 
previously categorized Inferred resources to be upgraded to Indicated resources. The change to a lower set of 
cut-off grades have also had the effect of increasing the mineral resources.

14.7.4 Boto 6 

Compared to the previous Mineral Resource Estimate (July 2017), the Boto 6 mineral resources show a 
significant increase in resource tonnages and contained metal.  This is partially due to the additional drill hole 
information that have allowed for greater confidence and better continuity of geology and grade to allow

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1 Summary 

The reserves for the Project are based on the conversion of the Indicated resources within the current Technical 
Report mine plan.  No Measured resources are currently part of the model.  Indicated resources are converted 
directly to Probable Reserves.  The total reserves for the Project are shown in Table 15.1.

Total - - - 35,060 1.71 1,926,000 35,060 1.71 1,926,000 

Note: This mineral reserve estimate is as of Aug 30, 2018 and is based on the new mineral resource estimate dated May 8, 2018 for 

Malikoundi and Boto 5 by AGP. The mineral reserve calculation was completed under the supervision of Gordon Zurowski, P.Eng of AGP., 

who is a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101.  Mineral reserves are stated within the final design pit based on a $1,044/oz gold price 

pit shell with a $1,200/oz gold price for revenue for Malikoundi, $960/oz for Malikoundi North and $900 /ounce for Boto 5.  The cut-off 

grade varied by material type from 0.46 g/t Au in saprolite, 0.50 g/t Au in transition and 0.63 g/t Au in fresh rock for the Malikoundi and 

Malikoundi North pit areas.  The cut-off was 0.48 g/t Au in saprolite, 0.49 g/t Au in transition and 0.59 g/t in fresh rock for the Boto 5 area.  

The mining cost varied by rock type and area but averaged $2.11/t, processing costs vary by rock type but averaged $13.83/t milled and 

G&A was $4.15/t milled.  The process recovery averaged 89.5%.  The Technical Report scope only considers the Malikoundi, Malikoundi 

North and Boto 5 open pit mineralized zones. 

The reserves are based solely on the Malikoundi, Malikoundi North and Boto 5 areas.   

The QP has not identified any known legal, political, environmental, or other risks that would materially affect 
the potential development of the Mineral Reserves.  The risk of not being able to secure the necessary permits 
from the government for development and operation of the project exist but the QP is not aware of any issues 
that would prevent those permits from being withheld per the normal permitting process. 

15.2 Mining Method and Mining Costs 

The Project is amenable to extraction by open pit methods.  Costs were developed from base principles and 
with current equipment quotations from local vendors. 

All design work is based on the Malikoundi and Boto 5 models generated by AGP with an effective date of May 
8, 2018.  Only Indicated Resources were used for the Feasibility Study and all Inferred resources are considered 
as waste.  No Measured resources exist in the current models.

A geotechnical study was completed on the Malikoundi and Boto 5 deposits for use in the FS study.  This work 
was completed by AG.  

The Malikoundi deposit consists predominantly of pelite, with sandstone units present in the southeast of the 
pit, and at depth. The mineralisation is aligned to the north-south structural trend and is constrained within two 
Limestone/marble units, dipping at ~60° to the west, which are interpreted to have formed impermeable 
barriers to the flow of mineralising fluids. The Malikoundi North deposit lies on the extension along strike of the 
eastern Limestone unit. The geology of the Boto 5 deposit is more poorly understood, partly due to the deep 
(>100m) saprolitic weathering profile. A saprolitic profile overlies fresh rock at Malikoundi and is generally <40m 
thick.  

Data from previous phases of geotechnical and hydrogeological study have been collated and used within this 
assessment. Geotechnical and hydrogeological investigations targeted data gaps and areas of greater 
uncertainty within conceptual models. Geotechnical data collection for this phase of study focused on the 
hangingwall of Malikoundi (additional drilling into the footwall was undertaken subsequent to the PFS), 
Malikoundi North and Boto 5. Hydrogeological assessment was designed to refine the characterisation of the 
low permeability conditions inferred from previous phases of hydrogeological testing. A packer testing 
programme was undertaken to supplement available groundwater monitoring data, and results of previous 
phases of downhole testing.  

Geotechnical domains have been defined based on similar geological, structural, and rock mass conditions. Both 
Malikoundi and Malikoundi North pits were subdivided initially by the main Limestone units, and then by 
lithology as warranted. It has been recognised that the stability of the footwall within the Pelite is likely to be 
controlled by the orientation of the major structural fabric of the deposit. The stability of the hangingwall is 
likely to be controlled by a combination of instability through the rock mass and structural instabilities at the 
batter scale. Subdivision of Boto 5 was based primarily on the thickness of the various weathered units. Due to 
the low material strengths, instability through the rock mass is the controlling mechanism, although structural 
instability on relic structure can still occur.  

Detailed information for the recommendations can be found in Section 16.3.  For the final design, the pit slopes 
discussed in Section 16.6 were used.  These are shown in Table 15.2.

Drained conditions are assumed because horizontal drain holes are planned every 20 m vertically as mining 
progresses.  The initial design is to have drill stations every 200 m horizontally on the 20 m levels and three 
drillholes drilled 50 m from each station radiating out as a fan. 

15.2.2 Economic Pit Shell Development 

The final pit designs were based on pit shells using the Lerch-Grossman procedure in MineSight.  The 
parameters for the shells are shown in Table 15.3 and 15.4.

The final pit design was based on pit shells developed using the Lerch-Grossman procedure in MineSight.   

A series of nested shells were generated using a revenue factor (rf). Initially these were varied between a gold 
price of $300/oz (rf=0.25) and $1440/oz (rf=1.2) to examine the deposit sensitivity to gold prices and outline the 
higher value areas. This information was graphed, and the various phases and final shell determined based on a 
net revenue curve.   

The final pits are based on the $1044/oz gold price shell for Malikoundi, $960/oz gold price shell for Malikoundi 
North and $900/oz shell for Boto 5.

15.2.3 Cut-off Grade 

For determining the tonnes and grade in the pit, cut-offs were varied by pit area and weathering type.  The cut-
offs used are shown in Table 15.5. 

Table 15.5 Marginal Cut-off Grades 

Weathered 
Material Malikoundi Boto 5

Laterite n/a n/a 
Saprolite 0.46 0.48 
Transition 0.50 0.49 
Fresh 0.63 0.59 

 

For scheduling purposes, a higher-grade cut-off of 1 g/t was used to bin the higher-grade material while the 
marginal cut-off used to define the low-grade bin.  All reserves are reported based on the marginal cut-off 
grades. 

15.2.4 Dilution 

The geologic models developed for the FS were whole block fully diluted models.  This means the grade from 
the wire frames was diluted over the full volume of the block to arrive at a diluted block grade.  The geologic 
model had been created with grade wireframes prior to assigning the grade into a whole block.  AGP believed 
that this did not adequately reflect the amount of dilution that would be expected with normal mining practice, 
even with more selective equipment.  

AGP also believes that contact dilution would play a role in material sent to the mill.  To determine the amount 
of dilution and the grade of the dilution the size of the block in the model was examined.  The Malikoundi block 
size within the model was 5 m in the dip direction, 10 m along strike, and 5 m high. 

The percentage of dilution is calculated for each contact side using an assumed 0.5 m contact dilution distance.  
If one side of the block is touching waste, then it is estimated that dilution of 10% would result.  If two sides are 
contacting, it would rise to 15%.  Three sides would be 20%, and four sides 30%.  Four sides represent an 
isolated block of ore.  This assumes a development of the block on the hangingwall side first, then the two sides 
and finally the footwall. 

For Boto 5, the block model was equally sized at 5 m on each side (dip, strike and height).  The dilution 
calculation used the same 0.5 m of contract dilution.  The resulting dilution percentages were different with one 
side equal to 10%, two sides at 20%, three sides at 30% and four sides at 40%.  The same development 
sequence was assumed.

Since the model contained whole blocks already, the percentage of dilution could be estimated and then 
included in the block ore percentage item.  The mining model was modified to include an ore percent item, and 
any blocks with a grade above the marginal cut-off grade were assigned an ore percent of 100% (deemed 
entirely ore).  

MineSight has a routine that enables the user to query surrounding blocks against a set of conditions.  For the 
dilution percentage calculation, the procedure was run to determine how many ore blocks contacted a waste 
block, which determined the dilution percentage to apply.  This was stored in the waste block and the waste 
block grade used as the diluting value.  If a waste block was only surrounded by other waste blocks, the dilution 
percentage was zero. 

In this manner, the contact blocks could be included in the tonnage and grade calculation of ore tonnes.  The 
ore tonnage was then run with the block model DORE% item to report out the proper tonnes and grade. 

Comparing the in-situ to the diluted values for the designed pit phases showed an increase in ore tonnage along 
with a lowering of gold grade.  For the Malikoundi pit (phases 1-3 and Malikoundi North), the diluted ore 
contained 4.5% more tonnes and 4.1% lower gold grade than the in-situ ore summary. For the Boto 5 pit, the 
diluted ore contained 7.8% more tonnes and 6.7% lower gold grade than the in-situ ore summary. The grade 
dilution is lower due to the waste blocks containing some mineralization.  The ore tonnage contact dilution is 
lower than the one contact block dilution percentage due to the thickness of the ore where not all the ore 
blocks are diluted with waste.  The "internal dilution" from the conversion of wireframe to whole block was not 
reported separately within the reported in-situ summaries otherwise the dilution tonnages would have been 
higher. 

Tonnes and grade for the pit designs are reported with the diluted tonnes and grade. 

15.2.5 Pit Design 

The detailed pit design utilized the pit shells developed to provide guidance on the phasing and final pit.  Wall 
slopes for the inter-ramp were per the geotechnical recommendations.   

Equipment sizing for ramps and working benches is based on the use of 95 t rigid frame haul trucks.  The 
operating width used for the truck is 6.9 m.  This means that single lane access is 21.4 m (2x operating width 
plus berm and ditch) and double lane widths are 28.3 m (3x operating width plus berm and ditch).  Ramp 
gradients are 10% in the pit for uphill gradients and 8% uphill on the dump access roads.  Working benches 
were designed for 35 m to 40 m minimum on pushbacks, although some pushbacks in the Malikoundi pit did 
work in a retreat manner to facilitate access. 

The Malikoundi pit is designed as 4 phases within the main pit.  Phase 0 as the initial pit is called as a subset of 
Phase 1 to drive quickly to fresh rock for tailings dam construction purposes.  Malikoundi North is a single-phase 
pit as is Boto 5.

The mine schedule delivers 35.1 Mt of ore grading 1.71 g/t Au to the mill over a mine life of 12.8 years.  Waste 
tonnage totalling 204.3 Mt will be placed into waste rock management facilities.  The overall strip ratio is 5.8:1 
life of mine. 

The current mine life includes two years of pre-stripping and 12.8 years of mining.  The final year will complete 
the pit and clear the stockpiled ore.  The stockpiled ore, together with pit phasing will be utilized to ensure 
sufficient mill feed is available in the rainy season and for blending purposes.  This will also be coupled with in-
pit sumps and surface ditches around the pits.  Phases will be advanced quickly in the dry season to provide 
temporary water storage after a rainfall event that pumping will remove in the wet season. 

15.2.6 Mine Reserves Statement 

The reserves for the Project are based on the conversion of the Indicated resources within the current Technical 
Report mine plan.  No Measured resources are present in the current models.    Indicated resources are 
converted directly to Probable Reserves. These were prepared under the supervision of Gordon Zurowski, P. 
Eng. of AGP who is a qualified person as defined under NI 43-101.  The reserves are based solely on the 
Malikoundi, Malikoundi North and Boto 5 open pits. 

Cut-offs for the Malikoundi and Malikoundi North areas varied by material type from 0.46 – 0.63 g/t Au.  For 
Boto 5 the cut-offs were between 0.48 and 0.59 g/t Au. 

This estimate is as of August 30, 2018.  The total reserves for the Project are shown in Table 15.6 and Table 
15.7.

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Introduction 

Open pit mining was selected as the method to examine the development of the Project located in Senegal.  
This is based on the size of the resource, tenor of the grade, grade distribution and proximity to topography for 
the Malikoundi and Boto 5 deposits. 

No mining has been conducted on the Malikoundi part of the project but artisanal mining is ongoing at Boto 5. 
AGP's opinion is that with current metal pricing levels and knowledge of the mineralization, open pit mining 
offers the most reasonable approach for development. 

The Project is located to the west of the Falémé River, which also represents a border with Mali. A 500 m buffer 
zone was kept with the river and surrounding villages for all infrastructure and waste dump facilities, while 200 
m was observed for the pits. 

The potential for underground development beneath the open pit has not been examined as part of this 
technical report. 

16.2 Geologic Model Importation 

AGP worked with the IAMGOLD team to prepare the Project resource models.  While resource models were 
developed for Malikoundi, Boto 4, Boto 5 and Boto 6 only the Malikoundi and Boto 5 models were used for the 
Feasibility Study mine plan.   

The resource estimates were created using Geovia GEMS™ 6.8.1 resource estimation software.  The blocks 
models were estimated using inverse distance cubed.  These models were exported as a comma-separated 
values (CSV) file and imported into the mining software, MineSight©.   

Details of the different block models are provided in Table 16.1.

The resource block models contain rock type, density, classification weathering and gold grade.  The resource 
models are whole block models. The mining model created by AGP in MineSight uses the same model 
dimensions as the original resource model with added items used for mine planning purposes. MineSight was 
used for the mining portion of the FS to take advantage of the included Lerchs-Grossman routine for economic 
pit shell development. 

The grade in each block of the resource models is considered to be fully diluted except for any contact dilution 
of the block.  No ore percentages are considered in the block model provided.  All of the block model items in 
the mining model remain the same as in the geologic model. 

Only Measured and Indicated Resources were used for the FS with no reported Measured in the model 
provided.  All Inferred Resources were considered as waste. 

Resources for the various models are shown in Table 16.2.  The effective date of the resources is May 8, 2018.

16.3 Geotechnical Information 

 AG has been engaged to undertake a geotechnical assessment of open pit slopes for IAMGOLD's Project 
Feasibility Study (FS). The Project is located in Senegal, and consist of 3 proposed open pits –Malikoundi, 
Malikoundi North, and Boto 5. The Malikoundi design is proposed for mining in 3 staged designs. This 
geotechnical assessment has been undertaken in line with CSIRO's best practice document Guidelines for open 
pit slope design (Read and Stacey, 2009).  

The Malikoundi pit is approximately 335 m deep, and 1250 m long by 800 m wide and is understood to be the 
ultimate pit of a potential 4 phase development. The Malikoundi North and Boto 5 pits extend to depths of 
approximately 80 m and 140 m, respectively. The Malikoundi pit has been previously assessed to prefeasibility 
study level, but geotechnical assessment of Boto 5 and Malikoundi North has not previously been undertaken.  

The Malikoundi deposit consists predominantly of Pelite, with Sandstone units present in the southeast of the 
pit, and at depth. The mineralization is aligned to the north-south structural trend and is constrained within two 
Limestone/marble units, dipping at ~60° to the west, which are interpreted to have formed impermeable 
barriers to the flow of mineralising fluids. The Malikoundi North deposit lies on the extension along strike of the 
eastern Limestone unit. The geology of the Boto 5 deposit is more poorly understood, partly due to the deep

(>100m) saprolitic weathering profile. A saprolitic profile overlies fresh rock at Malikoundi and is generally <40 
m thick.  

Data from previous phases of geotechnical and hydrogeological study have been collated and used within this 
assessment. Geotechnical and hydrogeological investigation has targeted data gaps and areas of greater 
uncertainty within conceptual models. Geotechnical data collection for this phase of study focused on the 
hangingwall of Malikoundi (additional drilling into the footwall was undertaken subsequent to the PFS), 
Malikoundi North and Boto 5. Hydrogeological assessment was designed to refine the characterization of the 
low permeability conditions inferred from previous phases of hydrogeological testing. A packer testing 
programme was undertaken to supplement available groundwater monitoring data, and results of previous 
phases of downhole testing.  

Geotechnical logging and laboratory test data has been analyzed to allow characterization of intact, rock mass, 
and defect plane strengths for materials subdivided by weathering grade and lithological unit. Weathered 
materials have been classified using a weak rock classification scheme in conjunction with a programme of 
laboratory classification and strength testing. Fresh rock has been characterized using the RMR89 and GSI 
classification systems (Bieniawski, 1989, Hoek et al, 2013).  

Structural orientation data from both the geotechnical dataset and the resource definition drilling has been 
processed and used in structural analysis. A range of structure types were encountered, with foliation, bedding 
and joints dominating. The foliation and bedding are generally sub-parallel and form the dominant anisotropy of 
the deposits. Structural domaining has been undertaken based primarily on the subdivision of deposit by major 
structures.  

Pore pressure modelling was undertaken to provide groundwater inputs to stability modelling and highlighted 
the requirement for active depressurisation measures at Boto 5, due to the low permeability of the Saprolite 
units. Such materials are very sensitive to adverse ground and surface water conditions and the modelling re-
iterates the requirement for pro-active management of both.  

Geotechnical domains have been defined based on similar geological, structural, and rock mass conditions. Both 
Malikoundi and Malikoundi North pits were subdivided initially by the main Limestone units, and then by 
lithology as warranted. It has been recognised that the stability of the footwall within the Pelite is likely to be 
controlled by the orientation of the major structural fabric of the deposit. The stability of the hangingwall is 
likely to be controlled by a combination of instability through the rock mass and structural instabilities at the 
batter scale. Subdivision of Boto 5 was based primarily on the thickness of the various weathered units. Due to 
the low material strengths, instability through the rock mass is the controlling mechanism, although structural 
instability on relic structure can still occur.  

Stability analyses of the batter, inter-ramp and overall slope scales have been undertaken. Sensitivity analyses 
have also been performed to assess the potential for seismic effects, toppling instability modes, potential step-
path mechanisms and the influence of groundwater. Results of sensitivity analyses to groundwater conditions 
highlight the need for pore pressure monitoring through a network of vibrating wire piezometers. High level 
rock fall analysis has been undertaken to check the suitability of design berm widths.

The overall and inter-ramp stability analysis was undertaken primarily by two-dimensional limit equilibrium 
stability analyses, with large scale kinematic analysis and 3D limit equilibrium analysis used to augment this in 
the footwall domains of Malikoundi. The location and orientation of the stability analysis sections were chosen 
to reflect the critical sections based on pit depth, geological conditions and wall orientations.  

The following tables present the design recommendations for the overall slope heights appropriate to the pit 
designs provided. Design options are presented in places where exceeding acceptance criteria may be 
considered appropriate. Design sectors and boundaries are shown in the following figures.  

Dewatering estimates have been undertaken to allow consideration dewatering infrastructure requirements. 
Based on the predicted groundwater inflow rates and direct rainfall estimates it is anticipated that by 
completion of excavation required dewatering capacity would be in the region of:  

• Malikoundi: 15,000 m3/day. 

• Malikoundi North: 2,500 m3/day. 

• Boto 5: 8,000 m3/day. 

The dewatering requirement for Boto 5 is based on a higher design rainfall estimate given the geotechnical 
sensitivity of the pit slope material to saturated conditions at the base of pit. The pumps would operate at these 
capacities for a few weeks each year. However, continuous pumping at these rates would not be expected for 
most of the wet season.  

A geotechnical risk assessment is provided, and the greatest un-managed risks are considered to be for slope 
failure in the weathered slopes at Boto 5 in the absence of groundwater and surface water management. 
Residual risks are all reduced to low and moderate through mitigation measures as outlined in the 
recommendations for design implementation. These recommendations are an important part of the design and 
will assist in early identification of conditions which could lead to instability (as highlighted by the presented 
sensitivity analyses). Given the relatively small proportion of material sampled as part of this study relative to 
the volume of material which will constitute the pit walls, validation of the geotechnical conditions during the 
early stages of development will be important.

16.4 Economic Pit Shell Development 

The open pit ultimate size and phasing requirements were determined with various input parameters including 
estimates of the expected mining, processing and G&A costs, as well as metallurgical recoveries, pit slopes and 
reasonable long-term metal price assumptions.  AGP worked together with IAMGOLD personnel to select 
appropriate operating cost parameters for both Boto 5 and Malikoundi.  The mining costs are estimates based 
on cost estimates for equipment from vendors and the previous PFS completed by AGP.  The costs represent 
what is expected as a blended cost over the life of the mine for all material types to the various dump locations.  
Process and G&A costs were provided by Lycopodium based on Lycopodium's own study work. 

The parameters used are shown in Table 16.6.

Pit shells for Malikoundi and Boto 5 were generated to examine sensitivity to the gold price with a target of 
$1,200/oz.  This was to gain an understanding of the deposit and highlight potential opportunities in the design 
process to follow.  Only undiluted Measured and Indicated material was used in the analysis.  The gold price was 
varied from $300/oz up to $1,440/oz to determine the size of the shell.  All other parameters were fixed.  This 
was intended to visualize any natural breakpoints in the deposit and assist in phase development.  The net 
profit before capital for each pit was calculated on an undiscounted basis for each pit shell using $1,200/oz as 
the revenue. Ore/waste t and net profit were plotted against gold price.  Graphs of the two areas are shown in 
the following figures.

Figure 16.7 illustrates various break points in the pit shells.  With the increase in the waste tonnage, and to a 
lesser degree the mill tonnage, the net profit also increased.  In the case of the first break point shown at 
$540/oz Au, the cumulative waste tonnage is 18.1 Mt, with a corresponding mill feed tonnage of 5.9 Mt or a 
strip ratio of 3.07:1.  The net profit also increased beyond this point showing that there was still value to be 
obtained by going with a higher metal price or an additional phase.  This break point represented 48% of the net 
value of a $1,200/oz pit but with only 9% of the waste of the larger pit shell. 

The second break point was at $840/oz.  The incremental waste tonnage from the first break point is 38.6 Mt, 
with a corresponding increase in mill feed tonnage of 6.9 Mt or a strip ratio of 5.6:1.  The net profit also 
increased beyond this point showing that there was still value to be obtained by going with a higher metal price. 
This pit shell was used for the design of the Malikoundi phase 2 pit. There is a significant waste tonnage in the 
next higher pit price to achieve the next increase in profit.  The cumulative value of the two break points was 
75% of the $1,200/oz pit shell but with only 27% of the waste movement of the larger pit required.  

The third and final major break point was at $1,044/oz gold.  This resulted in a substantial jump in the waste 
tonnage from the second break point by 113.3 Mt with a gain of 15.3 Mt of ore for an incremental strip ratio of 
7.39:1. The net profit continues to increase beyond the third break point, although at a flatter rate than in 
earlier breakpoints. The additional potential pit value was considered negligible when considering schedule 
discounting and the accuracy of the analysis.  This pit shell was used for the design of the Malikoundi phase 3 
pit. The cumulative strip ratio of material within the $1,044/oz gold pit shell is 6.03:1.  This pit mines 98% of the 
value of the larger $1,200/oz pit shell and only 80% of the waste.  Increasing the pit size further only gains 
another 2% in net revenue for 20% of the waste.  This was not considered to be a reasonable exchange. 

Figure 16.8 shows the result for the Boto 5 pit.  A single pit due to the small size of Boto 5 was selected with the 
mining costs associated with the 40t haul trucks and process costs associated with a 2.75 Mtpa throughput.  The 
$900/oz shell pit was used for design purposes. The cumulative waste tonnage for the selected pit shell is 12.0 
Mt, with a corresponding mill feed tonnage of 1.8 Mt or a strip ratio of 6.6:1.  This represented 98% of the net 
value of the $1,200/oz pit with 87% of the contained waste. 

The Malikoundi North ultimate pit used was the $960/oz shell.  Deeper shells required flatter slopes to 
accommodate the required road lengths and switchbacks.  This was not considered to be a reasonable trade-
off, so the lower value pit shell was used. 

16.5 Dilution Calculation 

The geologic model provided was a whole block, fully diluted grade model.  This means the grade from the wire 
frames was diluted over the full volume of the block to arrive at a diluted block grade. 

The geologic model had been created with grade wireframes prior to assigning the grade into a whole block.  
AGP believed that this did not adequately reflect the amount of dilution that would be expected with normal 
mining practice, even with more selective equipment.

AGP also believed that contact dilution would play a role in material sent to the mill.  To determine the amount 
of dilution and the grade of the dilution the size of the block in the model was examined.  The Malikoundi block 
size within the model was 5 m in the dip direction, 10 m along strike, and 5 m high. 

The percentage of dilution is calculated for each contact side using an assumed 0.5 m contact dilution distance.  
If one side of the block is touching waste, then it is estimated that dilution of 10% would result.  If two sides are 
contacting, it would rise to 15%.  Three sides would be 20%, and four sides 30%.  Four sides represent an 
isolated block of ore.  This assumes a development of the block on the hangingwall side first, then the two sides 
and finally the footwall. 

For Boto 5, the block model was equally sized at 5 m on each side (dip, strike and height).  The dilution 
calculation used the same 0.5 m of contract dilution.  The resulting dilution percentages were different with one 
side equal to 10%, two sides at 20%, three sides at 30% and four sides at 40%.  The same development 
sequence was assumed. 

Because the model contained whole blocks already, the percentage of dilution could be estimated and then 
included in the block ore percentage item.  The mining model was modified to include an ore percent item, and 
any blocks with a grade above the marginal cut-off grade were assigned an ore percent of 100% (deemed 
entirely ore). The marginal cut-off grades are shown for each weathered material type and pit in Table 16.8.

MineSight has a routine that enables the user to query surrounding blocks against a set of conditions.  For the 
dilution percentage calculation, the procedure was run to determine how many ore blocks contacted a waste 
block, which determined the dilution percentage to apply.  This was stored in the waste block and the waste 
block grade used as the diluting value.  If a waste block was only surrounded by other waste blocks, the dilution 
percentage was zero. 

In this manner, the contact blocks could be included in the tonnage and grade calculation of ore tonnes.  The 
ore tonnage was then run with the block model DORE% item to report out the proper tonnes and grade. 

Comparing the in-situ to the diluted values for the designed pit phases showed an increase in ore tonnage along 
with a lowering of gold grade.  For the Malikoundi pit (phases 1-3 and Malikoundi North), the diluted ore 
contained 4.5% more t and 4.1% lower gold grade than the in-situ ore summary. For the Boto 5 pit, the diluted 
ore contained 7.8% more t and 6.7% lower gold grade than the in-situ ore summary. The grade dilution is lower

due to the waste blocks containing some mineralization.  The ore tonnage contact dilution is lower than the one 
contact block dilution percentage due to the thickness of the ore where not all the ore blocks are diluted with 
waste.  The "internal dilution" from the conversion of wireframe to whole block was not reported separately 
within the reported in-situ summaries otherwise the dilution tonnages would have been higher. 

Tonnes and grade for the pit designs are reported with the diluted tonnes and grade calculated with this 
method. 

16.6 Pit Design 

Pit designs were developed for the Boto pit areas – Malikoundi, Malikoundi North and Boto 5 pits.  The pit 
optimization shells used to determine the ultimate pits were also used to outline areas of higher value for 
targeted early mining and phase development.  

Geotechnical parameters outlined in Section 16.3 were used for each of the weathering zones and are shown 
again in Table 16.9.

Geotechnical berms of 12 m to 20 m in width were designed in the Malikoundi and Malikoundi North pits at the 
base of the weathering (transition) zone.  For Boto 5, flatter slopes on the hangingwall material were 
recommended and ramps were incorporated in this material to act as geotechnical berms.  In addition, a 
geotechnical berm was recommended at the 150 level in Boto 5 with a width of 30 m. 

Equipment sizing for ramps and working benches is based on the use of 95 tonne rigid frame haul trucks.  The 
operating width used for the truck is 6.9 m.  This means that single lane access is 21.4 m (2x operating width 
plus berm and ditch) and double lane widths are 28.3 m (3x operating width plus berm and ditch).  Ramp 
gradients are 10% in the pit for uphill gradients and 8% uphill on the dump access roads.  Working benches 
were designed for 35 m to 40 m minimum on pushbacks, although some pushbacks in the Malikoundi pit did 
work in a retreat manner to facilitate access.

Boto 5 was envisaged as a contract mining operation using 40 tonne trucks, but the same road and ramp 
requirements were applied as for Malikoundi. 

The Malikoundi pit is designed as 4 phases within the main pit.  Phase 0 as the initial pit is called is a subset of 
Phase 1 to drive quickly to fresh rock for tailings dam construction purposes.  Malikoundi North is a single-phase 
pit as is Boto 5.  The final design phase tonnages and grades are shown in Table 16.10.

The resources for the Malikoundi pit phases are based on lower cut-off grades of 0.46 g/t Au for saprolite, 0.50 
g/t Au for transition material, and 0.63 g/t Au for rock.  The resources for the Boto 5 pit are based on lower cut-
off grades of 0.48 g/t Au for saprolite, 0.49 g/t Au for transition material, and 0.59 g/t Au for rock.  The schedule 
has a high-grade cut-off of 1 g/t Au for all material types to separate high-grade from low-grade. 

The phase designs are described in further detail below: 

16.6.1 Malikoundi – Phase 0 

Phase 0 is a subset of Phase 1 with the purpose of driving quickly to fresh rock for construction purposes in 
addition to material for road and other infrastructure items.  It is the first phase mined in the Project.  The 
Phase elevations range from 165 masl to the pit bottom of 105 masl.  The design is shown in Figure 16.9.

Phase 1 expands on Phase 0 and is also developed from the north and advanced south.  It has elevations 
ranging from 165 masl to a pit bottom of 60 masl.  This is primary ore source early in the mine life.  Phase 0 is 
shown with Phase 1 in Figure 16.10 and Phase 1 alone in Figure 16.11.  As is shown in the Figures, the ramp 
starts further to the north to avoid disrupting material flow from Phase 0.

advancing.  This provides the mine planning team the flexibility to advance one side over the other quickly to 
accommodate rainy seasons and also the future development of Phase 2.

Phase 3 is a deepening of the southern area of Phase 2.  This will be a single access phase to save on waste and 
exits to topography on the south side.  The geotechnical berm is evident in the design at the base of the 
transition zone.  The multiple access points of Phase 2 assist Phase 3 by not disrupting material movement from 
Phase 2 and offer the ability to shorten haul profiles at different times in the mine life.  Phase 3 extends from 
the same 165 masl level to a final depth of -160 masl or 325 m at the deepest point.  Phase 2 and Phase 3 are 
shown together in Figure 16.14 and Phase 3 is shown alone in Figure 16.15.

16.6.5 Malikoundi North 

The Malikoundi North pit is designed as a separate satellite pit to the north of the main Malikoundi pit. It 
consists of a single small, narrow mining phase that is accessed with a slot from the north end of the pit. The 
haul road will be to full operating width, except for the single lane for the bottom benches. This phase is located 
immediately to the east of the proposed water storage facility.  Malikoundi North has an elevation variation 
from 160 masl to 50 masl.  The ultimate pit is shown in Figure 16.16.

single mining phase that is accessed with a wrap-around ramp access from the northwest corner of the pit. The 
haul road will be to full operating width, except for the single lane for the bottom benches. The ultimate pit is 
shown in Figure 16.17.  The pit ranges in elevation from 205 masl to 85 masl.

16.7 Mine Schedule 

The mine schedule delivers 35.1 Mt of ore grading 1.71 g/t gold to the mill over a mine life of 12.8 years.  Waste 
tonnage totalling 204.3 Mt will be placed into waste rock management facilities.  The overall strip ratio is 5.83:1 
life of mine.   

The mine schedule utilizes the pit and phase designs described previously to send a maximum of 2.75 Mtpa of 
ore to the mill facility.  Ore is a mixture of saprolite, transition and hard rock.   

The current mine life includes 15 months of pre-stripping and 12.8 years of mining.  The final year will clear the 
stockpiled ore.  The stockpiled ore, together with pit phasing will be utilized to ensure sufficient mill feed is 
available in the rainy season.  This will also be coupled with in-pit sumps and surface ditches around the pits.  
Phases will be advanced quickly in the dry season to provide temporary water storage after a rainfall event that 
pumping will remove in the wet season. 

When mining starts, various infrastructure items are required.  These include; establishing proper roads to the 
TMF, FWP, to the plant and to the various waste management facilities.  Boto 5 will require a 4.7 km access 
road/ore haulroad to be developed plus access to the pit area.  The TMF areas require another 4.8 km of road 
and mine roads connecting these various areas total 2.8 km. 

A fresh water storage facility will be built in the valley to the north of the plant in the preproduction period.   
Operationally, ditching around the pits to intercept surface run-off and wider ramps with rock capping 
foundations will help to minimize reductions in mine production.

Year -2 is only a three-month period beginning at the end of the rainy season.  In this time period, a total of 2.3 
Mt of material will be moved as the project ramps up. Year -1 mining brings the total material movement to a 
total of 13.7 Mt moved.  This includes the development of a 2.2 Mt ore stockpile grading 2.25 g/t Au in 
anticipation of plant commissioning and operation.  Phase 0 and Phase 1 will be the only active phases in the 
preproduction period. 

Project activities in the pre-production period include: 

• Haul road construction. 

• FWP construction. 

• TMF material placement for the starter portions of the west and central embankments. 

• Initiation of mining in Malikoundi Phase 0 and Phase 1 

• Development of an ore stockpile at plant for commissioning and operations. 

Year 1 production is based on the assumption that the plant will require 3 months to achieve full production 
levels.  The first month the plant will be capable of 60% of capacity.  The second month 80% and the third 
month 90%.  Subsequent months will be at 100% of nameplate capacity in the mill.  This ramp-up schedule 
requires the Year 1 production to be 2.59 Mt.  Ore mining will be from stockpile, Boto 5 and Malikoundi Phase 
0, 1 and 2.  Mining will be initiated in Malikoundi Phase 2, Malikoundi North and Boto 5.  Boto 5 will be mined 
by contractor using smaller 40 t trucks. 

Year 2 production is at the full 2.75 Mt of ore to the mill and continued stripping of Boto 5, and Malikoundi 
Phases 1 and 2 and Malikoundi North.  Malikoundi Phase 3 will also start pre-strip activity. Boto 5 will advance 
to the 125 level.  Malikoundi Phase 1 will be completed this year with a final pit elevation of 60 masl.  
Malikoundi Phase 2 will be at the 105 level and Phase 3 at 145 level.  Malikoundi North finishes the year at the 
115 level. Waste from Phase 3 is directed to the dump to the east of the Malikoundi Pit. 

Year 3 production is the final year for Boto 5 with its final level being 85 masl.  Malikoundi Phase 2 is the 
dominant phase of mining at this time driving to a depth of 75 masl.  Phase 3 continues to advance behind 
Phase 2 to the 125 level.  Malikoundi North is used intermittently and only drops 10 m to the 105 level. 

Year 4 maintains mining in Malikoundi Phase 2 and 3 plus Malikoundi North.  They each reach the following 
levels respectively; 40 masl, 100 masl, and 75 masl. 

Year 5 sees Malikoundi North completed to its final design elevation of 50 masl. Phase 2 remains the dominant 
source of mill feed, but Phase 3 is developing significantly.  Phase 2 completes the year at 15 masl and Phase 3 
is at 65 masl.  

Year 6 has Phase 2 and 3 mining in Malikoundi.  Malikoundi Phase 2 is at the -20 level and Phase 3 is at the 25 
masl level.

Year 7 Phase 2 is completed part way through the year to its final depth of -40 masl and Phase 3 is the only 
mining phase being mined by year end.  Phase 3 ends the year at the -10 level.  

Years 8 thru 12 have Phase 3 providing the 2.75 Mtpa mill requirement.  In Year 12, Phase 3 finishes at its final 
level of -160 masl.  The stockpile created over the mine life is being rehandled in earnest in Year 12 with 2.1 Mt 
of ore reclaimed 

Year 13 reclaims the remaining 2.2 Mt of ore in the stockpile.  There is no mining in the pit this year.  

The mine schedule was completed on a monthly basis for Years -2 and -1, quarterly for Year 1 and annually for 
Years 2 onwards.  This has been summarized to an annual schedule for conciseness.  The mine is scheduled to 
deliver 35.1 Mt of ore to the mill grading 1.71 g/t Au.  Waste totalling 204.3 Mt will be stored in waste 
management facilities in the Boto 5, Malikoundi West, Malikoundi East, TMF and FWP areas.  The overall strip 
ratio is 5.83:1.  The mine schedule is shown in Table 16.11.

16.8 Grade Control 

Grade control is an item that was considered from the beginning of the mine planning sequence.  Blasthole 
sampling was considered but due to the selectivity required was excluded.  Other operations in the area utilize 
reverse circulation drilling as a method of ore definition.  This involves using a reverse circulation drill in 
advance of mining on tight inclined drillhole spacing, to accurately define the ore/waste contacts.  This is 
typically done when the mineralized zone is more dispersed or inclined towards the horizontal which is similar 
to Malikoundi.  This information is then built into the short-range models and used to guide the loading 
equipment. This practice is widespread in Australia with great success as well as in Canada and Africa.   

The method involves using a dedicated grade control drill rig and crew in the pit to drill a series of shallow 
vertical holes drilled in a pattern similar to the blast hole pattern.  For this study, that is assumed to be a 
contract drill rig and team with experience in this type of drilling.  The grade control drill will be drilling the 
saprolite where blast holes are not required.  The pattern for drilling will be a 10 m spacing and a 5 m burden 
with samples taken every 1 m in presumed mineralized zones as outlined by both previous ore control drilling 
and the exploration drilling.  The volume of the sample to be assayed and sample intervals will need be 
determined in a grade deportation study in subsequent studies.  An additional 25% will be drilled along the 
contacts to ensure that unknown structures are not missed in the saprolite.  These "waste" samples will be 
drilled with a 20 m spacing and 10 m burden and sampled over 6m. 

The amount of reverse circulation drilling peaks in Year 2 at 33,200 m then drops off after that averaging 22,300 
m/a from Year 2 until Year 12. No ore control drilling is required after Year 12.  

The reverse circulation drills will operate in advance of mining for 24 h/d minimizing disturbance and be in 
advance of mine operations with the information.  A three-man crew per drill is required; one driller and two 
drill helpers.  In addition, geologists will provide guidance throughout the day and be on call if unknown issues 
arise. 

The drill penetration rate is estimated at 10 m/h with setups, sampling, etc.  Overall, the cost for the RC drill 
program with contract labour is estimated at $63/m.  Sampling and assay cost is estimated from laboratory 
quotes at $14.25/sample.  

The data from the grade control drilling is then interpreted by the geologist and the ore is then remodelled.  The 
production drilling and blasting will then be designed to mine the ore material separately from the waste. 

16.9 Waste Management Facility Design 

Various rock types are present in the material mined within the final pits.  They include the weathering profile 
of laterite, saprolite, transition and hard rock.  The percentages vary by pit and phase.  Ferricrete is present in 
some areas and will be utilized for construction material and roads.  All material types will be co-mingled in the 
waste management facilities.   

Certain portions of the material will be directed to the TMF for the embankment construction.  In addition, 
there will be four waste storage areas.  These are shown in Figure 16.21.

b. Is designed to stay 500 m from the river. 
c. Active from Year 2 to Year 11. 

5) Boto 5 
a. Is composed of laterite, saprolite and transition material entirely from Boto 5 

The design capacities and actual capacities used are shown in Table 16.12.

The design of the WMF's considers variable swell factors dependent on material types.  For laterite and 
saprolite a swell factor of 15% was applied.  Transition material is expected to be in the 20% range and fresh 
rock swell at 30%.   

The facilities are built in different manners dependent on the dominant material type.  For the Malikoundi 
facilities lift height will be 10 m with a bench width of 10 m.  Assuming a 37.6° face slope, the overall slope will 
be 23.5°. 

Boto 5 is constructed of lower strength material (laterite, saprolite and transition).  This requires more time for 
pore pressure dissipation and staging of the various lifts.  Initially the Boto 5 facility will be built in 5 m lifts with 
a bench slope of 30.5 degrees and berm width of 10 m.  Later stages of the facility development will be placed 
in 10 m lifts with 25 m benches.  This results in an overall slope of 15° for long term stability. 

Waste management facilities will be actively reclaimed as they are developed.  Dozers will re-slope them as 
they are advanced to allow revegetation to occur as soon as possible.

Drainage from each of the WMF's will be diverted to sedimentation ponds.  This is to ensure the sediment 
washed down from the facilities is captured before it escapes from the mine property.  The sediment ponds will 
be cleaned annually or more frequently if required to ensure storage capacity in the ponds is not compromised.

16.10.1 Comments on Section 16 

• The open pit designs are comprised of three areas: Boto 5, Malikoundi, and Malikoundi North. 

• Malikoundi is divided into four phases with Phase 1 subdivided into a Phase 0 to drive to fresh rock 
sooner for construction purposes. 

• Malikoundi North is mined starting in Year 1. 

• Boto 5 is mined from Year 1 until Year 3 to minimize the amount of saprolite in the feed initially.  

• Mill feed totals 35.1 Mt grading 1.71 g/t Au diluted. 

• Waste tonnage over the mine life will total 204.3 Mt for a strip ratio of 5.83:1 LOM. 

• Contact dilution for Malikoundi and Malikoundi North added 4.5% more tonnes and lowered the gold 
grade by 4.1% based on 0.5 m of contact dilution. 

• Boto 5 contact dilution added 7.8% more tonnes and lowered the gold grade by 6.7% with the 0.5 m 
of contact dilution. 

• The open pit mine life is 12.8 years after 2 years of preproduction stripping. 

• The final ore stockpile reclaim is in Year 13. 

• Mine production will be preceded by two years of pre-production work that will be used to establish 
roads, create an ore stockpile, build initial stages of the tailings embankments and prepare the pits 
for full production. 

• Waste Management Facilities (WMF) are located to the north-west, north and north-east of 
Malikoundi and one to the north-west of Boto 5. 

• Owner operated mining was considered Malikoundi and Malikoundi North. 

• Boto 5 is contract mined with 40 t trucks to minimize disturbance to the local populace.  No blasting 
is planned or required for Boto 5 as only soft material is mined.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Design 

The process plant design for the Project is based on a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum 
recovery with minimum operating costs.  The flowsheet is based on well proven unit operations in the industry. 

The key criteria for equipment selection are suitability for duty, reliability and ease of maintenance.  The plant 
layout provides ease of access to all equipment for operating and maintenance requirements whilst maintaining 
a layout that will facilitate construction progress in multiple areas concurrently. 

The key project design criteria for the plant are: 

• Nominal throughput of 2.75 Mtpa ore based on the 85th percentile of the bedrock or hard rock 
hardness. 

• Crushing plant availability of 75%. 

• Process plant availability of 92% supported by the design of the crushing plant, surge capacity where 
required and standby equipment in critical areas. 

• Sufficient automated plant control to minimize the need for continuous operator interface and allow 
manual override and control if and when required. 

Study design documents have been prepared incorporating engineering design criteria and key metallurgical 
design criteria derived from the results of the metallurgical testwork. 

17.1.1 Selected Process Flowsheet 

The treatment plant design incorporates the following unit process operations: 

• Single stage primary crushing with a jaw crusher to produce a crushed product size of P80 of 138 mm. 

• Mill feed surge/overflow bin that overflows to an approximately 5,000 t stockpile to provide 14.5 
hours of surge capacity.  During extended periods of up to two days for primary crusher equipment 
maintenance, additional crushed ore inventory can be generated in the weeks leading up to the 
planned shutdown by dozing crushed ore from this stockpile to the area adjacent to the stockpile.  
This ore can then be reclaimed during the shutdown by front-end loader to feed the grinding circuit. 

• The grinding circuit is a SSAG type, which consists of a closed circuit single stage SAG mill, producing a 
P80 of 75 µm.

• Hydrocyclones are operated to achieve a hydrocyclone overflow slurry density of 28.1%w/w solids to 
promote better particle size separation efficiency.  The overflow stream passes through a trash 
screen to remove foreign materials prior to downstream processing.  Subsequently, a pre-leach 
thickener is included to increase slurry density to the leach circuit, minimize leach tank volume 
requirements and reduce overall reagent consumption. 

• Leach circuit with five tanks to achieve the required 34.4 hours of residence time at nominal plant 
throughput.  A pre-oxidation step is included ahead of leaching to minimize cyanide consumption and 
improve downstream leach kinetics. 

• CIP carousel circuit consisting of six stages for recovery of gold dissolved in the leaching circuit. 

• Pressure Zadra elution circuit with gold recovery to doré.  The circuit includes an acid wash column to 
remove inorganic foulants from the carbon with hydrochloric acid, followed by an elution column. 

• Carbon regeneration kiln to remove organic foulants from the carbon and reactivate the adsorption 
sites on the activated carbon with heat. 

An overall process flow diagram depicting the unit operations incorporated in the selected process flowsheet is 
presented in Figure 17.1. 

The key issues considered in process and equipment selection are outlined in the following section.

17.2 Process and Plant Description 

17.2.1 Introduction 

The Boto mineralization is predominantly hosted in quartz veins.  Sulphide minerals comprise pyrite, pyrrhotite 
and traces of arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite.  The Boto deposits are considered free milling.  The ore body 
consists of approximately 5% saprolite overlaying a layer of approximately 5% transition material (also referred 
to as "saprock") followed by the remaining 90% fresh rock at depth.  The proposed process facility will consist of 
the following process areas: 

• Primary crushing and coarse ore storage. 

• Grinding, utilizing a SSAG circuit. 

• Leach-CIP Carousel circuit. 

• Gold recovery and carbon handling circuit (consisting of a cold acid wash followed by a pressure 
Zadra elution circuit and horizontal carbon regeneration kiln). 

• Tailings disposal in a lined TMF with natural degradation of residual cyanide. 

The process plant will be designed to process 2.75 Mtpa (7,534 tpd) ore with an average gold head grade of 
1.71 g/t Au.  ROM feed to the Plant will be a blend of 90% bedrock and 10% saprolite/transition material.  The 
process plant was designed to be fit-for-purpose with no allowances for future expansion. 

The primary crusher installation will, from the onset of production, have the full capacity of 2.75 Mtpa available.  
The primary crushing circuit will operate for 365 days per annum, for a nominal 24 hrs/day.  On this basis, and 
at a design operating availability of 75%, the crushing circuit will operate for a nominal 6,570 hrs per annum.  
This equates to a nominal crusher circuit throughput of 419 t/h. 

Downstream of the crushing circuit, the grinding, leach, adsorption and tails disposal circuits will operate for 
365 days per annum, for a nominal 24 hrs/day.  On this basis, and at a design operating availability of 92%, 
these circuits will operate for a nominal 8,059 hrs/annum.  This equates to a nominal circuit throughput of 341 
t/h. 

The grinding circuit will consist of a single 32' (9.75 m) diameter by 20.9' (5.97 m) length (EGL) SAG mill.  The 
SAG milling circuit is closed out by hydro-cyclones with the cyclone overflows reporting to a vibrating trash 
screen ahead of the pre-leach thickener. 

The gold leach circuit will be comprised of a single pre-oxygenation tank followed by five leach tanks, providing 
a nominal leach residence time of 34 hrs.  The CIP carousel adsorption circuit will be comprised of six adsorption 
contactors.  These contactors will operate with a carbon concentration of 50 g/L on a one day cycle.  The total 
slurry residence time in the CIP section is 1.3 hrs.

The gold recovery and carbon handling circuit will operate on a batch basis at a carbon throughput rate of 5 
tonnes of carbon daily. 

17.2.2 Ore Receiving and Crushing 

Run-of-mine (ROM) ore from the open pit will be transported to the plant by 95 tonne capacity rear dump 
trucks.  The trucks will tip directly into the ROM bin. However, allowance will be made for a ROM stockpile to 
blend material per grade and hardness.  The ROM stockpile will be primarily utilised for ore blending to 
optimize mill power consumption, grade and to ensure a maximum saprolite content not exceeding 20% in the 
feed to the crusher.  Ore will be reclaimed, from the stockpile, to the ROM bin by a front-end loader. 

A static grizzly (600 x 600 mm), mounted above the ROM bin, will prevent the ingress of oversize material.  A 
mobile rock breaker will be used to break oversize material retained on the static grizzly.  Ore will be withdrawn 
from the ROM bin, by a variable speed apron feeder, directly into a jaw crusher, which will operate in open 
circuit.  Crushed ore from the crusher will discharge directly onto the primary crusher discharge conveyor, 
which will convey the crusher product to the mill feed bin. 

The crusher discharge conveyor will be fitted with a weightometer, to monitor and control the crushing area 
throughput by adjusting the output of the apron feeder variable speed drive. 

The crushing circuit will be serviced by a single dust collection system, comprised of a series of extraction hoods, 
ducting and a bag house.  Dust collected from this system will be discharged onto the crusher product conveyor. 

A static tramp metal magnet will be installed at the discharge end of the primary crusher discharge conveyor.  
Tramp metal will be manually removed from the magnet when necessary. 

Any spillage generated, within the crushing area, will be manually recovered and transported to the mill feed 
bin. 

Auxiliary equipment for the crushing circuit will include: 

• Crushing area control station. 

• Primary crusher maintenance hoist. 

• Primary crusher lube pack. 

• Primary crusher area camera. 

17.2.3 Coarse Ore Storage 

The mill ore feed bin will have a live capacity of 108 t (equivalent to approximately 18 mins plant feed at the 
instantaneous feed rate to the SAG mill).  The mill feed bin includes an overflow facility, with excess crushed ore 
conveyed to the crushed ore stockpile.  The crushed ore stockpile will have a capacity of approximately 5,000

tonnes (providing 14.5 hrs of plant feed).  Crushed ore will be reclaimed from the stockpile, to the ore bin, via a 
front-end loader. 

Crushed ore will be withdrawn from the ore bin, by a variable speed apron feeder.  The feeder will discharge 
onto the SAG mill feed conveyor, which will convey the crushed ore to the SAG mill feed chute.  The SAG mill 
feed conveyor will be fitted with a weightometer, used for controlling the speed of the apron feeder and to 
account for the mass of feed presented to the grinding circuit. 

Quicklime will be added directly to the SAG mill feed conveyor, via the lime variable speed rotary feeder.  The 
Quicklime storage silo will have a storage capacity of 54 t, equivalent to 3.4 days storage.  To mitigate the risk of 
lime shortages a strategic inventory of at least 102 1t lime bags will be kept in storage, providing a 7-day 
contingency supply. 

Grinding media (a mix of 125 mm and 38 mm balls) will be added to the crushed ore bin using a front-end 
loader. 

Any spillage generated, within the reclaim area, will be manually recovered and transported to the mill feed bin, 
utilizing a dedicated drive-in sump and sump pump.  Supernatant solutions from this sump will be pumped to 
the mill discharge pumpbox while the solids will be transported to the ore bin using a front-end loader. 

Auxiliary equipment for the reclaim area will include: 

• Crushed ore stockpile dust suppression sprays. 

• Lime silo and lime hopper dust collector. 

• Lime hoist, lifting frame. 

• Weightometer calibration chain. 

17.2.4  Grinding and Classification 

The grinding circuit will be a SSAG circuit, comprised of a single, variable speed, semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) 
mill.  The SAG mill will operate in closed circuit with hydro-cyclones while pebbles will be removed by a 
Trommel screen and recycled back to the SAG feed conveyor via two conveyors.  The product particles exiting 
the grinding circuit (cyclone overflow) will contain 80% passing 75µm material. 

To achieve the required leach product size when treating ore at the 85th percentile of hardness, a 9.75 m x 6.38 
m SAG mill (32 ft x 20.9 ft; 11.60 MW) will be required. 

Crushed ore, reclaimed from the ore bin, will be conveyed to the SAG mill feed chute via the SAG mill feed 
conveyor.  Process water will be added to the SAG mill feed chute, to control the in-mill pulp density.  The SAG 
mill will be fitted with discharge grates, which will allow slurry to pass through the mill and will also relieve the 
mill of pebble build-up.  The SAG mill product will discharge to a Trommel screen for size classification.

SAG mill trommel screen oversize will be recycled back to the SAG Mill feed conveyor via two conveyor belts.  
Undersize from the discharge screen will flow by gravity to the SAG mill discharge pumpbox, prior to being 
pumped to the classification cyclone cluster by a single variable speed cyclone feed pump.  The classification 
cyclone cluster overflow will flow by gravity, via a trash screen, to the pre-leach thickener feed distribution box.  
This overflow stream will be sampled for metallurgical accounting before reporting to the trash screen.  Trash 
screen undersize will gravitate to the pre-leach thickener, whilst trash screen oversize will be discharged to a 
trash bin.  Underflow slurry, from the classification cyclone underflow launder, will flow by gravity back to the 
SAG mill feed chute. 

Spillage within the grinding circuit will be managed through a slanted floor draining to a central sump fitted with 
a sump pump.  Slurry from this sump will be discharged into the mill discharge pumpbox.  During flooding 
events the excess water will flow via trenches to an event pond. 

Auxiliary equipment within the grinding area will include: 

• SAG mill drive lubrication system. 

• SAG mill liner handler and relining monorail. 

• Mill area mobile crane. 

• Cyclone maintenance hoist. 

17.2.5 Pre-Leach Thickening 

Trash screen undersize will flow by gravity directly to the pre-leach thickener feed box, where flocculant will be 
added to aid with particle settling.  Overflow from the pre-leach thickener will flow to the process water tank.  
Underflow from the pre-leach thickener, at 50.7% solids, will be pumped by dedicated thickener underflow 
pumps to the leach circuit feed distribution box. 

The pre-leach thickener area will be serviced by a dedicated sump pump.  Spillage and wash down collected by 
the sump pump will be returned to the pre-leach thickener distribution box.  Excess water will overflow from 
this bunded area via trenches to the event pond. 

Auxiliary equipment within the pre-leach thickener area will include: 

• Pre-leach thickener flocculant in-line mixer for diluting mixed flocculant at 0.25% strength down to a 
final feed concentration of 0.025%. 

• De-aeration feed box.

17.2.6 Leach Circuit 

Pre-leach thickener underflow will be pumped to the leach feed distribution box.  The slurry from the leach feed 
distribution box will discharge into the pre-oxygenation tank.  If the pre-oxygenation tank is offline, the slurry 
will be diverted to the first leach tank, via an internal dart plug distribution system. 

Compressed oxygen will be bubbled through the slurry in the pre-oxygenation tank to oxidize cyanide 
consuming species and to improve downstream leach kinetics. 

The leach circuit will consist of five, mechanically agitated, leach tanks operating in series.  This equates to a 
nominal residence time of 34.4 hrs at a slurry feed rate of 458 m3/h.  Each leach tank will have a live volume of 
3,150 m³. 

Cyanide, for gold dissolution, will be added to the leach circuit by dedicated cyanide dosing pumps.  The primary 
cyanide dosing point will be the first leach tank, with further addition points located down the leach train.  The 
operating pH of the leach circuit will be maintained above 10.5 to maintain the protective alkalinity of the 
circuit and prevent the loss of cyanide to gaseous hydrogen cyanide.  Protective alkalinity will be maintained by 
the addition of quicklime to the SAG mill feed conveyor.  Because of the slow response time between the lime 
addition point and the leach tanks a secondary means of emergency pH control is provided in the form of 
caustic addition points into each leach tank.  Note that this will be used in emergencies only and will need to be 
monitored to limit unnecessary or accidental caustic consumption. 

To aid with gold dissolution, oxygen will be added to the leach circuit.  Oxygen will be supplied from the PSA 
system's oxygen storage tank and injected into each CIL tank via dedicated oxygen spargers.  To sustain the 
desired dissolved oxygen levels, external oxygen contactors will be installed on the first two leach tanks.  Lead 
nitrate will also be added to the leach feed distribution box. 

Following dissolution, the solubilised gold will be recovered by carbon adsorption, within the dedicated carbon-
in-pulp carousel (Pumpcell®) circuit.  Leach circuit tails slurry will gravitate to the carousel circuit feed 
distribution launder. 

Should a leach tank be off-line for maintenance, it will be possible to bypass any of the leach tanks.  The ability 
to bypass tanks will be made possible by the installation of two pneumatic gates located within the leach inter-
stage launders.  One gate will divert slurry to the following leach tank while the second gate will allow slurry 
diversion to the subsequent leach tank. 

The leach area will be serviced by two sump pumps.  The sump pump closer to the front-end will return spillage 
to the leach feed distribution box.  The sump pump closer to the back-end will discharge spillage to either the 
final leach tank or to the trash screen as an alternative.  The leach bund area will overflow in case of 
emergencies to the event pond.

Auxiliary equipment within the leach area will include: 

• Cyanide analyser. 

• Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) monitor. 

• Control and titration room. 

17.2.7 Carbon Absorption Circuit 

The slurry from the leach circuit will report to the Pumpcell® CIP plant feed launder.  The feed launder will 
distribute the slurry to the first tank, within the carousel adsorption sequence. 

The Pumpcell® circuit will consist of six, mechanically agitated, tanks operating in series each with a live volume 
of 100 m3.  This equates to a total slurry residence time of 1.3 hrs at a feed rate of 461 m3/h.  The tanks will 
operate with a carbon concentration of 50 g/L.  The adsorption tanks will operate on a daily cycle with the 
single stage inventory of 5 t carbon recovered and discharged to the acid wash circuit every day. 

Activated carbon will be retained in each of the tanks, by an inter-tank screen, which is integral to the tank 
agitator mechanism.  The inter-tank screen will be a stainless steel wedge wire cylinder equipped with an 
internal agitator and external rotating wiper blade mechanism to prevent screen blinding. 

The Pumpcell® circuit operates as a carousel, with carbon retained within the tanks and the slurry advanced 
counter current to the carbon adsorption stage.  Slurry will nominally flow from Tank 1 through to Tank 6, with 
the gravitational flow between tanks induced by the pumping action of the tank agitator/screen mechanism. 

Periodically (1 hour every day), a complete batch of loaded carbon, from the first contactor, will be pumped by 
the Loaded Carbon Recovery Pump to the Loaded Carbon Screen, where it will be washed with spray water to 
remove excess slurry.  The excess slurry (screen underflow) will return to the Pumpcell® feed launder whilst the 
loaded carbon will discharge to the acid wash column. 

Regenerated carbon (or fresh carbon) will be hydraulically added to the Pumpcell® circuit, from the carbon 
regeneration circuit.  The regenerated carbon (or fresh carbon) will be pumped, to the Pumpcell® circuit, via the 
carbon sizing screen.  The sizing screen will remove excess water and carbon fines.  The dewatered carbon will 
discharge into the last adsorption tank, with excess water and carbon fines flowing to the carbon safety screen. 

Slurry discharging the last adsorption tank will flow by gravity to a transfer hopper, from where it will be 
pumped to a carbon safety screen via the carbon safety screen feed box.  The carbon safety screen will capture 
and recover any carbon exiting the adsorption circuit.  The safety screen oversize will report to a fine carbon bin 
while the undersize will flow to the tails pumpbox.  A sampler, installed on the carbon safety screen feed will 
periodically collect a sample of the adsorption tail stream.  This sample will be used for circuit monitoring and 
for metal accounting. 

The adsorption circuit will be serviced by a dedicated sump pump.  The sump pump will return spillage to the 
Pumpcell® CIP feed distribution launder.

Auxiliary equipment within the Pumpcell® circuit area will include: 

• CIP overhead gantry crane. 

• Spare Pumpcell® mechanism. 

• High pressure cleaner. 

17.2.8 Elution and Carbon Regeneration 

The Elution circuit will consist of separate acid wash and elution columns.  A cold acid wash will be utilized.  
Following acid wash, gold will be eluted from the carbon, utilizing a pressure Zadra elution process.  With the 
CIP circuit operating on a daily cycle, one elution will be completed every day.  The elution circuit will be 
designed to complete one strip per 20-hour period.  At a carbon gold loading of 2,659 g/t the required daily 
carbon movement equates to 5 t. 

Acid Wash 

The cold acid wash sequence will be required to remove accumulated, calcified scale, from the carbon surface.  
The acid wash column fill sequence will be initiated by taking the first carbon tank offline and pumping its entire 
content to the Loaded Carbon Screen.  Carbon will gravitate from the Loaded Carbon Recovery Screen directly 
into the Acid Wash Column while the underflow slurry from this screen will return by gravity back into the 
carousel feed launder.  Once the Acid Wash Column is filled to the required level, the carbon fill sequence will 
be stopped. 

The acid wash cycle will utilize a 3% w/v hydrochloric acid solution.  This dilute acid will be prepared by the 
addition of raw water and neat (32%) hydrochloric acid, into the Hydrochloric Acid Dilution Tank.  The acid wash 
sequence will involve the injection of the dilute acid solution into the column, by the Hydrochloric Acid Dosing 
Pump, via the feed manifold located beneath the column.  Once the required amount of acid has been added to 
the column, the HCl Acid Pump will be stopped and the carbon will be allowed to soak for a period of one hour. 

Upon completion of the acid soak, the acid wash cycle will be initiated by pumping dilute acid solution through 
the column for a period of 2 hrs.  The acid solution will be recycled back to the dilute acid tank.  After 
completion of this step the acid rinse/neutralization step will be initiated.  During the rinse cycle, four bed 
volumes (4 BV) of water, at 2 BV/h, will be pumped through the column.  The first 2 BV will include a caustic 
injection, to neutralize the acid waste, whilst the last 2 BV are comprised of a fresh water rinse only.  Acid waste 
and displaced solution from both the acid rinse and wash steps will pass through the Acid Wash Discharge 
Strainer before discharging to the Tails Collection Hopper. 

The sequence will conclude with carbon being hydraulically transferred to the Elution Column.  Water, for 
carbon transfer between the acid wash and elution columns, will be supplied from the Transfer Water Tank via 
the Transfer Water Pump.

Elution 

The elution sequence will commence with the injection of make-up raw water into the Strip Solution Tank, 
along with the simultaneous injection of cyanide and caustic solution.  A set amount of cyanide and sodium 
hydroxide (caustic) will be added to achieve a 1% w/w NaOH and 0.2% w/w NaCN strip solution.  Both reagent 
additions will be automatically stopped once the prescribed volume has been added.  The pre–heating period 
will then commence.  During this period, the strip solution will be circulated through the first heat exchanger to 
pre-heat it to 95°C.  Upon completion of pre-heating, the elution sequence will commence and gold will be 
stripped from the carbon.  During this stripping time barren eluate, from the strip solution tank, will be 
pumped, through the heat recovery heat exchanger, picking up residual heat from the eluate exiting the elution 
column. 

The pre-heated, incoming eluate, will then pass through the Primary Heat Exchanger to elevate the eluate 
temperature to 135°C prior to entering the base of the column.  A diesel fired elution heater will provide the 
heat to the heat exchangers.  A temperature probe will monitor the temperature of eluate exiting the column, 
which will be used to control the heater output.  Eluate will flow up through the carbon bed and out of the top 
of the column, passing through the recovery heat exchanger via the elution discharge strainers to the flash tank.  
Initially, eluate emerging from the heat exchanger will be directed to the pregnant eluate tank. Pregnant eluate 
will flow by gravity from the Flash Tank through the electrowinning (EW) cells, with the barren eluate exiting the 
EW cells being pumped back to the strip solution tank. 

A total of 32 bed volumes of strip solution will be cycled through this closed-circuit comprising of the strip 
column and EW cells. Upon completion, heating will cease and cooling water will be injected into the circulating 
stream for a period of 1 hr. This cooling water will displace a portion of the strip solution, which will be bled 
from the circuit to the CIP feed launder.  Upon completion of the cool down sequence, the eluted carbon will be 
hydraulically transferred to the carbon regeneration kiln de-watering screen. 

The elution area will be serviced by the Elution Area Sump Pump.  Elution area spillage will be pumped to the 
CIP feed launder. 

Auxiliary equipment within the Acid Wash and Elution circuits will include: 

• Elution Heater Pump. 

• Strip Solution Heater. 

• Acid wash and elution column discharge strainers. 

Carbon Regeneration 

After elution, the carbon will be hydraulically transferred from the elution column to the carbon regeneration 
circuit by pressurizing the column with transfer water.  The carbon and transfer water will be directed to the 
carbon dewatering screen, allowing excess water to be removed prior to the carbon discharging into the carbon 
regeneration kiln feed hopper.  Dewatering screen undersize will gravitate to the carbon safety screen.

Lycopodium Minerals Canada Ltd 

Carbon will be withdrawn from the Kiln Feed Hopper, via the Kiln Screw Feeder, and discharged directly to the 
carbon regeneration kiln, at a rate of 250 kg/h.  Within the diesel fired, horizontal rotary kiln, the carbon will be 
heated to 700°C, to remove volatile organic foulants from the carbon surface, thereby restoring the carbon 
activity. 

Re-activated carbon exiting the kiln will discharge directly to the carbon quench vessel, where it will be 
submerged into water and rapidly cooled.  From the quench tank, carbon will be pumped, by the regenerated 
carbon transfer pump, to the carbon sizing screen.  Sizing screen oversize will flow to the CIP Feed Launder.  
Sizing screen undersize will discharge to the carbon safety screen feed box.  Fresh carbon will also be added to 
the CIP circuit via the Quench Tank. 

Auxiliary equipment within the Carbon Regeneration circuit will include: 

• Fresh Carbon Loading Hoist. 

• Carbon Transfer Water Pump. 

17.2.9 Electrowinning and Gold Room 

Soluble gold and silver recovery, from the pregnant eluate, will be achieved by electrowinning onto stainless 
steel cathodes.  The electrowinning circuit will consist of two parallel electrowinning cells, each containing 12 
cathodes and 13 anodes.  A dedicated rectifier, per electrowinning cell, will supply the necessary current, to 
electroplate the dissolved gold onto the cathode. 

Once the elution pre-heating cycle has been completed, the electrowinning sequence will be initiated by 
diverting strip solution through the closed loop of the elution column and EW cells.  During the electrowinning 
cycle, the electrowinning cell discharge will be continuously returned to the strip solution tank, via gravity. 

Upon completion of electrowinning, gold sludge on the plated cathodes will be washed off the cathodes, with a 
high pressure cathode washer.  The gold bearing sludge will be recovered to a sludge hopper, from where it will 
be filtered, via a pressure filter. 

The gold bearing filter cake will be thermally dried in an electric drying oven.  Dried filter cake will be mixed 
with a prescribed flux mixture (silica, nitre and borax), prior to being charged into the diesel fired gold furnace.  
The fluxes added react with base metal oxides to form a slag, whilst the gold and silver remains as a molten 
metal.  The molten metal will be poured into moulds, to form doré ingots, which will be cleaned, assayed, 
stamped and stored in a secure vault ready for dispatch.  The slag produced will periodically be returned to the 
grinding circuit, via the SAG mill. 

The gold room and electrowinning area will be serviced by a gold trap and dedicated gold room area sump 
pump.  Any spillage within this area will be pumped back to the leach circuit.

Auxiliary equipment for the Electrowinning and Gold Room circuit will include: 

• Furnace bag house, extraction fan and stack. 

• Electrowinning cell fume hood. 

• High pressure cathode cleaner. 

• Smelting furnace cascade trolley and slag cart. 

• Doré moulds and doré wash table. 

• Flux bin, platform scale, flux mixing table. 

• Doré balance. 

• Doré safe and strongroom. 

17.2.10 Tailings Disposal 

Slurry from the CIP circuit will be pumped to a carbon safety screen by the CIP Tails Transfer Pump.  The carbon 
safety screen will capture and recover any carbon exiting the adsorption circuit.  The safety screen oversize will 
report to a fine carbon bin while the undersize will flow by gravity to the Tails Collection Hopper.  A sampler, 
installed on the carbon safety screen feed will periodically collect a sample of the adsorption tail stream.  This 
sample will be used for circuit monitoring and for metal accounting.  Tailings will be pumped from this hopper 
to the lined tailings management facility for permanent storage. 

Residual cyanide will degrade naturally through hydrolysis and UV irradiation in the TMF. 

17.2.11 Reagents Mixing and Storage 

The major reagents utilized within the process plant will include: 

• Quicklime (85% CaO) for pH control. 

• Sodium cyanide (NaCN) for gold dissolution and desorption. 

• Lead nitrate (PbNO3) for gold dissolution (leach accelerant). 

• Caustic soda (NaOH) for neutralization and desorption. 

• Hydrochloric acid (HCl) for carbon acid washing. 

• Flocculant for thickening. 

• Antiscalant to reduce fouling in the process water distribution, carbon wash and stripping circuit.

• Fluxes for smelting charge preparation. 

Quicklime 

Quicklime will be delivered to site in bulk 36 t tankers or 1,000 kg bulk bags.  Bulk tankers will off-load directly 
to the lime storage silo via a dedicated pneumatic transfer system.  The bulk bags will be lifted, by the lime 
hoist, to the lime storage silo.  The lime storage silo will have a storage capacity of 3.4 days or 54 t. 

Quicklime will be withdrawn from the silo by a lime screw feeder and deposited directly onto the SAG Mill feed 
conveyor by a variable speed screw feeder. 

Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) 

Sodium cyanide will be delivered to site in 1 t boxes of briquettes.  The box will be lifted, by the cyanide hoist, to 
a platform above the cyanide mixing tank. 

Process water will be added to the mixing tank to achieve a solution with the desired cyanide concentration 
(20% w/w).  The mixing tank will be mechanically agitated to assist with cyanide dissolution.  Sodium hydroxide 
will be added to the cyanide mixing tank, to maintain the pH above 10.5 during the mixing process.  Control of 
the pH above 10.5 is required to prevent the formation of gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) during the mixing 
process. 

Briquettes will be discharged into the partially filled mixing tank from the platform.  After complete dissolution 
of a batch of cyanide the mixed solution will be transferred into the cyanide storage tank.  From here cyanide 
solution will be distributed, via a cyanide ring main, to the leach circuit.  A dedicated metering pump will deliver 
cyanide solution to the elution column. 

The sodium cyanide and sodium hydroxide mixing and storage areas will be placed in a common bunded area 
serviced by a common sump pump.  Any spillage generated within this area will be pumped to the cyanide 
mixing tank or leach feed distribution box, or, alternatively, to the tails collection hopper. 

Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) 

Sodium hydroxide (caustic) will be delivered to site in 1,200 kg bulk bags.  The bulk bag will be lifted, by the 
caustic hoist, to the bulk bag splitter mounted above the caustic mixing tank. 

Caustic will be released, from the bulk bag, by the bag splitter.  Raw water will be added to the mixing tank to 
achieve a solution with the desired caustic concentration (20% w/v).  The mixing tank will be mechanically 
agitated to assist with caustic dissolution.  Dedicated metering pumps will deliver caustic solution to the acid 
wash column strip solution tank and cyanide mixing tank.  A caustic line will also deliver caustic to the leach 
section for emergency adjustments to the operating pH.

Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) 

Hydrochloric acid (32% w/w) will be delivered to site in 1,000 L bulk containers (IBC).  The acid drum pump will 
transfer acid, from the bulk containers, to the acid mixing and storage tank.  From the acid mixing and storage 
tank, the hydrochloric acid dosing pump will transfer the requisite amount of acid, to the acid wash column. 

The hydrochloric acid storage area will be serviced by a sump pump.  Any spillage generated within this area will 
be pumped to the tails collection hopper or returned to the acid mixing tank. 

Lead Nitrate 

Lead nitrate will be delivered to site in 1,000 kg bulk bags.  The bulk bag will be lifted, by the caustic hoist, to the 
bulk bag splitter mounted above the lead nitrate mixing/storage tank. 

Lead nitrate will be released, from the bulk bag, by the bag splitter.  Raw water will be added to the mixing tank 
to achieve a solution with the desired lead nitrate concentration (20% w/v).  The mixing/storage tank will be 
mechanically agitated to assist with lead nitrate dissolution.  Dedicated metering pumps will deliver lead nitrate 
solution to the leach feed distribution box. 

The lead nitrate mixing and storage area will be serviced by a dedicated sump pump.  Any spillage generated 
within this area will be pumped to the leach feed distribution box or returned to the lead nitrate mixing/storage 
tank. 

Flocculant 

Flocculant powder will be delivered to site in 750 kg bags and mixed in a proprietary mixing system, comprised 
of a bag breaker, feed hopper, eductor, mixing tank and storage tank.  The Flocculant Plant will mix flocculant 
powder with raw water to achieve the required storage concentration (0.25% w/w). 

Upon completion of the mixing cycle, the flocculant will be transferred to the flocculant storage tank, by the 
flocculant transfer pump. 

From the storage tank, flocculant will be distributed to the pre-leach thickener (via an in-line mixer) by the 
flocculant dosing pumps.  Additional water is added to the in-line mixers to dilute the flocculant to 0.025% w/w 
prior to its discharge into the pre-leach thickener feed launder. 

The flocculant area will be serviced by a sump pump.  Any spillage generated within this area will be pumped to 
the flocculant mixing tank or the tails collection hopper. 

Antiscalant 

Antiscalant will be delivered to the plant in bulk containers (IBC).  Dosing pumps will distribute antiscalant, 
directly from the IBC, to the elution and process water circuits.

Fluxes 

The following fluxes, will be delivered to the plant in 25 kg bags, and used in the gold room; Borax (Na2B4O2), 
Sodium Nitrate (NaNO3), Sodium Carbonate (Na2CO3) and Silica (SiO2). 

17.2.12 Water Services 

The process plant will utilize fresh water, filtered water and process water.  Any shortfall of process water will 
be made up, preferentially, from water contained within the FWP.   

Run-off Water, Ponds and Water Management 

Dedicated ponds will be provided to manage site water and environmental impacts.  Water from the open pit 
de-watering station will be pumped to the FWP.  Waste dump run-off (via waste rock dump toe drains) will be 
collected within dedicated sediment ponds.  From these sediment ponds, water will be pumped to the FWP.  
From the FWP, water will be pumped to the Raw Water Tank.   

Process Water 

Process water will predominantly consist of pre-leach thickener overflow and TMF reclaim water.  Process 
water will be stored in a 1,600 m3 process water tank (PWT), which provides almost two hours of surge 
capacity.  Provision has been made to top-up the PWT from the raw water tank should this be required.  From 
the process water tank, process water will be reticulated via headers by a duty and standby configuration of 
single stage process water pumps, with off-takes supplied for the predominant user points, namely: 

• Grinding (dilution and screen spray water). 

• Leaching and CIP circuit (washing and screen spray water). 

Fresh Water and Fire Water 

Fresh water, for the process plant and mining operation, will be harvested from various runoff collection ponds 
throughout the Operation.  It could be supplemented by river water intake in emergency cases only.  Fresh 
water from the various sources will be stored within the 2.5 Mm3 FWP, which would provide 58 months of 
water storage capacity.  From here water will be pumped into a raw water tank (RWT) at the plant site.  The live 
volume of this RWT will be 718 m3, which comprises of 288 m3 fire water reserve and 430 m3 raw water storage 
(4 hrs surge).  The raw water suction take-off will be placed such as to ensure a minimum volume of fire water 
reserve is always available at the bottom of the RWT. 

Raw water from the RWT will be reticulated through the plant by dedicated raw water pumps, to the 
predominant user points, namely: 

• Dust suppression (crushing area). 

• Carbon regeneration.

• Flocculant dilution at the pre-leach thickener. 

• Reagent make-up. 

• Workshops and Mine Services. 

Firewater will be supplied from the plant raw water tank, via a dedicated suction manifold.  The firewater 
system will comprise of: 

• An electrical jockey pump. 

• An electrical firewater pump. 

• A diesel standby firewater pump. 

The firewater system pressure will be maintained by the jockey water pump.  An electric fire water pump will 
automatically start on a drop in line pressure.  The diesel fire water pump will automatically start if the line 
pressure continues to drop below the target supply pressure or during a power failure. 

Filtered and Gland Seal Water 

Some raw water users require water with a low suspended solids content (cooling water circuit, acid wash 
circuit and elution circuit, gland seal water).  To satisfy this need, a portion of the raw water will be subjected to 
water treatment by filtration.  Treated water, from the water filtration plant, will be stored within a dedicated 
filtered water storage tank from where it will be pumped to the various end users by dedicated duty and 
standby pumps.  A closed circuit cooling water circuit is utilized, with cooling water being returned to the water 
storage tank. 

Gland water will be supplied from the filtered water storage tank by a dedicated high pressure gland water 
pump (duty and standby). 

Potable Water 

Potable water will be sourced from dedicated boreholes and subjected to water treatment including a reverse 
osmosis (RO) step for calcium, magnesium and chloride removal.  Treated potable water will be pumped to 
separate camp and site storage tanks from where it will be distributed to various end users.  Potable water will 
be distributed for human consumption and to the safety showers and eye wash stations. 

17.2.13 Air and Oxygen Services 

Plant air at 700 kPa will be provided by two high pressure air compressors, operating in a lead-lag configuration.  
The entire high pressure air supply will be dried.  Dried air will be fed to plant air receivers from where it will be 
distributed to the required plant areas, via three dedicated air receivers servicing the crushing, grinding and 
elution areas respectively.

Oxygen, for use within the leach circuit, will be supplied from a dedicated PSA oxygen plant.  Oxygen 
consumption is estimated at 11 tpd (at 90% purity) 

17.3 Plant Consumption 

17.3.1 Water Consumption 

A water balance for the process plant has been completed.  Water from the pre-leach thickener overflow 
stream is recycled within the process plant to reduce external water requirements.  During an average rainfall 
year approximately 295 m3/h of decant return water is expected to be recycled from the TMF to the process 
plant.  This would fully satisfy the process water requirements i.e. there would be no make-up water required 
from the raw water system.   

Fresh water consumption is estimated at 59 m3/h.  The water balance shows that there will be an excess of 
201 m3/h in an average year (in addition to the excess from the TMF) that would need to be stored in the FWP.  
Given the very large positive water balance, no extraction from the river is anticipated. 

17.3.2 Energy Consumption 

The power demand for the plant, along with the rest of the site and camp, will be provided by on-site 
thermal/solar power plant.  The average power demand is summarized in Table 17.2 and utilized for the 
operating cost estimate.  The average power demand does not reflect the instantaneous power demand for 
equipment start-up and power plant capacity sizing.

17.4 Plant Control System 

17.4.1 General Overview 

The following provides a broad overview of the control strategy that will be employed for the plant. 

The general control philosophy for the plant will be one with a moderate level of automation and remote 
control facilities, to allow process critical functions to be carried out with minimal operator intervention.  
Instrumentation will be provided within the plant to measure and control key process parameters. 

The main control room, located in the Mill Office, will house two PC based operator interface terminals (OIT) 
and a single server.  These workstations will act as the control system supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) terminals.  The control room is intended to provide a central area from where the plant is operated 
and monitored and from which the regulatory control loops can be monitored and adjusted.  All key process 
and maintenance parameters will be available for trending and alarming on the process control system (PCS). 

Two additional OITs will be provided for data logging and engineering/programming functions. 

A field touch panel will be installed in the feed preparation area to allow local operator control of the crushing 
plant to facilitate ease of operation for rock breaking and stockpiling.  A second field touch panel will be 
installed in the elution area to allow local operator control of the elution sequence.  A third field touch panel 
will be supplied for the grinding area.

The process control system that will be used for the plant will be a programmable logic controller (PLC) and 
SCADA based system.  The PCS will control the process interlocks and PID control loops for non-packaged 
equipment.  Control loop set-point changes for non-packaged equipment will be made at the OIT. 

In general, the plant process drives will report their ready, run and start pushbutton status to the PCS and will 
be displayed on the OIT.  Local control stations will be located in the field in proximity to the relevant drives.  
These will, as a minimum, contain start and latch-off-stop (LOS) pushbuttons which will be hard-wired to the 
drive starter.  Plant drives will predominantly be started by the control room operator, after inspection of 
equipment by an operator in the field. 

The OITs will allow drives to be selected to Auto, Local, Remote and Maintenance or Out-of-Service modes via 
the drive control popup.  Statutory interlocks such as emergency stops and thermal protection will be 
hardwired and will apply in all modes of operation.  All PLC generated process interlocks will apply in Auto, Local 
and Remote modes.  Process interlocks will be disabled or bypassed in Maintenance mode with the exception of 
safety related and critical interlocks such as lubrication systems on the mill. 

Local selection will allow each drive to be operated by the operator in the field via the local start pushbutton 
which is connected to a PLC input.  Remote selection will allow the equipment to be started from the control 
room via the drive control popup.  Maintenance selection will allow each drive to be operated by maintenance 
personnel in the field via the local start pushbutton which is connected to a PLC input.  A PLC output will be 
wired to each drive starter circuit for starting and stopping drives.  Status indication of process interlocks as well 
as the selected mode of operation will be displayed on the OIT. 

Vendor supplied packages will use vendor standard control systems as required throughout the Project.  Vendor 
packages will generally be operated locally with limited control or set-point changes from the PCS.  General 
equipment fault alarms from each vendor package will be monitored by the PCS and displayed on the OIT.  Fault 
diagnostics and troubleshooting of vendor packages will be performed locally. 

Vendor package control will be implemented for the following equipment: 

• Pre-leach thickener rake mechanism. 

• CIP carousel system. 

• Carbon regeneration kiln. 

• Flocculant mixing system. 

• Compressed air system. 

• Instrument air dryers. 

• Oxygen plant.

The use of actuated isolation or control valves will be implemented around the plant for automatic control 
loops or sequencing as part of the plant control or the elution sequence.  All actuated valves and control valves 
will be operated from the OITs with remote position indication available.  Automatic control valves will be 
controlled by PID loops within the PCS. 

The PCS will perform all digital and analogue control functions, including PID control, for all non-packaged plant.  
Faceplates on the PCS displays will facilitate the entry of set-points, readout of process variables (PVs) and 
controlled variables (CVs) and entry of the three PID parameters (Proportional, Integral and Derivative). 

The majority of equipment interlocks will be software configurable.  However, selected drives will be hard wired 
to provide the required level of personal safety protection e.g. the emergency stop buttons associated with 
each and every motor and the pull wire switches associated with conveyors. 

All alarm and trip circuits from field or local panel mounted contacts will be based on fail-safe activation.  Alarm 
and trip contacts will open on abnormal or fault condition.  If equipment shutdown occurs due to loss of mains 
power supply, the equipment will return to a de-energised state and will not automatically restart upon 
restoration of power. 

Sequential group starts and sequential group stops will not be incorporated for non-packaged plant equipment, 
with the exception of the elution circuit.  However, in any process, critical safety and equipment protection 
interlocks will cause a cascade stop in the event of interlocked downstream equipment stopping (e.g. trip of 
SAG mill feed conveyor will result in stop of apron feeder).  Standard vendor packages may include automatic 
sequence start/stop controls within the vendor package only. 

17.4.2 Control System Configuration and Communications 

The process control system will be distributed throughout the plant, with a PLC installed in each of the following 
locations: 

• Feed preparation. 

• Grinding circuit. 

• Leach/CIP. 

• Elution/reagents/gold room 

• Water services. 

• Raw water dam. 

• Sedimentation ponds. 

• TMF.

The process plant PLCs will be interlinked via fibre optic cables and will all report back to the main control room.  
All field instrument and controls will be cabled back to their relevant switchroom utilizing field marshalling 
panels where appropriate.  Owing to the site topography and location of waste dumps, remote pumping 
stations will utilize fibre optic communications installed as optical fibre ground wire (OPGW) onto the HV power 
lines. 

17.4.3 Drive Controls 

Drives will be powered from starters installed in a Motor Control Centre (MCC) switchboard located in the 
electrical substation.  Each drive MCC will present a 'Running' indication and a 'Fault' alarm to the PLC system 
and will have provision for a PLC output contact for 'Process Interlocks'. 

Variable Speed Drive (VSD) units will be of a Variable Voltage Variable Frequency (VVVF) type utilising Pulse 
Width Modulated (PWM) technology.  The drive will be mounted in a free standing cubicle.  The drive will be 
provided with an integral control panel for programming and operation at the VVVF unit for commissioning and 
emergency running. 

The starting of conveyors and rotating equipment, such as mills, will be preceded with a start siren.  Interlocks 
will not be provided to stop large loads starting simultaneously. 

De-contactor connectors will be adopted for sump pumps.  Sump pumps will have low current trip relays 
installed in the MCC.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Overall Site 

The overall site plan for the Project (refer to Figure 18.1) includes the main facilities such as the open pit mines 
(Malikoundi, Malikoundi North and Boto 5), waste dumps, process plant, TMF, FWP, staff camp and main access 
road. An onsite power plant and bulk fuel storage not shown on Figure 18.1 is also provided. An airstrip not 
shown on Figure 18.1 is provided approximately 10 km from the mine site.  

The mine site is adjacent to the Falémé River to the east and the Balinko River to the North. 

The process plant, associated buildings, onsite power plant and bulk fuel storage are located west of the 
Malikoundi mine. The TMF is located north west of the process plant. The staff camp is located near the main 
access road and west of the process plant for ease of personnel access. The main access road approaches the 
site from the west. 

The site as a whole except for the open pit mines will be fenced to clearly delineate the area, prevent animal 
access and deter access by unauthorized persons. Road access into the fenced area will be through a manned 
security checkpoint. Security fencing will surround the accommodation camp. High security fencing will 
surround the process plant.

18.2 Roads 

18.2.1 Access to Site 

Main access to the mine site is approximately 67 km away via a lateritic road from the village of Saraya. As part 
of the development of the Project, the main access road will be upgraded and new bridges constructed to 
access the mine site year-round. Materials and consumables will be transported to the site via an upgraded 
access road. Culverts will also be installed or upgraded as appropriate on creek crossings. Fill material for the 
road will be obtained from borrow pits alongside the road where possible. The main access road will be 
designed for an 80 km/h speed limit. Construction of the access road will commence as part of project early 
works and at a minimum the bridges will repaired and/or replaced prior to the 2019 wet season to enable 
continued all weather access to site for construction. 

18.2.2 Project Site Roads 

Plant internal roads will provide access between the administration area, process plant facilities, bulk fuel 
storage, power plant, mine services area, and staff camp. These roads will generally be 6 m wide and will be 
constructed flush with bulk earthworks pads to ensure that storm water sheet flow is achieved across the site, 
thereby avoiding the need for deep surface drains and culvert crossings within the plant area. 

18.2.3 Haul Roads 

A network of mine haul roads will be constructed and maintained by the mining department and used to access 
the pits and waste dumps and for the transport of ore to the process plant and waste to the TMF.  

18.2.4 Access Tracks 

Several new tracks will be constructed to access infrastructure such as the TMF, sediment ponds, water storage 
pond, and water bore pumps remote from the plant site. The access tracks will be cleared and graded natural 
earth tracks. Exact routes will be determined during construction of the Project to best fit local terrain and 
vegetation density. 

18.3 Airstrip 

An existing, certified but unused airstrip located approximately 10 km from the mine site will be extended and 
upgraded to enable turboprop aircraft to access the site. The existing road track to the airstrip will be upgraded 
to a single lane laterite road. There is no provision for aircraft refuelling. 

18.4 Power 

18.4.1 Power Supply 

Due to the remote location of the Boto site, power will be provided from an onsite power plant located 
adjacent to the process plant under a 'Build, Own, Operate' (BOO) contract arrangement with an independent

power provider (IPP). The power plant will supply 11 kV to the process plant from which power will be 
distributed. Power will also be distributed to infrastructure outside the process plant via overhead pole lines. 
The power plant has been sized at 19.1 MW connected load to accommodate a peak load of 16.9 MW, and 
average running load of 13.1 MW with the following configuration: 

• 4 x 4.4 MW medium speed HFO units (Wartsila 9L32 or equivalent machines). 

• 3 x 2.2 MW high speed diesel units (CAT D3516 or equivalent machines). 

• 7.5 MWp solar units. 

Three HFO units will satisfy the average running load and the diesel units will supplement the power required 
during start-up, peak load and when one of the HFO unit is offline for maintenance. The solar units will operate 
during the day and the thermal generators will provide spinning reserve. 

The SAG mill at the process plant is the largest load and has been specified with a variable speed drive to 
provide a 'soft start' capability to reduce the load surge during start-up and minimize the need for spinning 
reserve at the power plant. 

18.4.2 Electrical Distribution 

The electrical system is based on 11 kV distribution and 410 V, 50 Hz working voltage. The 11 kV feeder from 
the power plant will feed the site distribution 11 kV switchboard. For the process plant the 11 kV supply will be 
stepped down from 11 kV to 415 V at each switchroom using separate 11 kV/415 V distribution transformers 
fed from the HV distribution board. 

The following switchrooms will be provided in the plant: 

• Primary crushing area. 

• Grinding area. 

• Thickener and water services area. 

• Leaching and CIP area. 

• Refining, reagents and air services area. 

• Mine services area. 

Switchrooms will house 415 V motor control centres (MCCs), area VVVF drives, plant control system cabinets, 
plant lighting transformers, various distribution boards and UPS power distribution.

11 kV overhead power lines will provide power to various remote facilities (TMF pumps, bore pumps, FWP 
pump, explosive storage area, etc.). Pole mounted transformers will step down the voltage at each location and 
supply an outdoor 415 V switchboard local to each equipment area. 

The staff camp power will be supplied from a local MCC/transformer fed from the 11 kV overhead line. 

18.4.3 Electrical Buildings 

Electrical buildings will be pre-fabricated 'flat pack' panel buildings to minimize installation time on site. 
Buildings will be installed on a structural framework over 2 m above ground level to allow for bottom entry of 
cables into electrical cabinets. The electrical buildings will be installed with air-conditioners and suitably sealed 
to prevent ingress of dust. 

18.4.4 Transformers and Compounds 

All the 11 kV/415 V distribution transformers will be of ONAN cooling configuration and vector group Dyn11. 

Fire rated concrete walls will be constructed around the pad mounted transformers.  

Outdoor rated 11 kV/415 V kiosk substations will be used to provide power to the TMF pumps, bore pumps, 
FWP pump and explosive storage area. 

18.5 Fuel Supply 

Bulk fuel supply will be provided by an onsite fuel storage facility and will store HFO and diesel for the power 
plant, mine trucks, light vehicles and users at the process plant. Day storage tanks are provided at the power 
plant and in the process plant. Bulk lubrication and diesel fuel dispensing is provided for the mine trucks and 
light vehicles. The fuel supply and facilities will be under a BOO contract arrangement with an independent fuel 
provider. 

18.6 Potable Water 

A common potable water system will be provided for the staff camp, process plant and mine services usage and 
will be located at the staff camp and distributed to the various users. A vendor package modular potable water 
treatment plant including filtration, ultra-violet sterilisation and chlorination will be installed. Water will be 
delivered via a reticulation system using a constant pressure variable flow pump system. The pump skid will 
include a UV disinfection unit to provide additional security against contamination.

18.10 Tailings Management Facility 

18.10.1 Introduction 

KP completed a feasibility level design for the TMF for the Project. The TMF will provide secure storage for 
tailings and process water, and protect groundwater and surface waters during operations and post closure. 
The feasibility level design is based on a projected 12.8-year mine life at a nominal processing rate of 
approximately 2.75 Mtpa. The TMF has been sized to permanently store approximately 35.06 Mt of tailings, or 
26.0 Mm3 at an average settled dry density of 1.35 t/m³. 

The TMF is located northwest of the process plant. The ultimate configuration of the TMF is shown on Figure 
18.2.

18.10.2 Tailings Characteristics 

Physical Properties 

Physical testwork was completed on samples of tailings to estimate the geotechnical properties to support the 
design of the TMF. The samples were obtained from composite sample MC2 gravity separation testwork and 
tested by SGS Minerals Services (SGS).

The tailings samples underwent a range of physical testwork to characterize the settling and consolidation 
properties of the tailings. The results are summarized as follows: 

• Specific Gravity: 2.81 

• Grain Size Distribution: Sandy (26%) SILT (66%), trace clay (8%). The P80 was measured to be 
approximately 90 µm. 

• Atterberg Limits: The liquid limit was measured to be 19% and the plastic limit was not obtainable. 
The tailings are non-plastic. 

• Classification: Based on the results described above and the unified soil classification system (USCS) 
the tailings are classified as ML (inorganic sandy silt; trace clay with no plasticity) 

• Consolidation: The Coefficient of Consolidation (Cv) values obtained from the consolidation testing 
range from 26 m2/year at low effective stresses to 36 m2/year at high effective stresses. The results 
indicate that the sample will consolidate slowly with loading. 

• Permeability: The coefficient of vertical permeability (kv) of the tailings was measured to range 
from 4.6 x 10-6 m/s at low effective stresses to 1.9 x 10-8 m/s at high effective stresses. 

• Settled Dry Density Estimate: Tests were completed at 43%, 48%, 53%, and 62% solids content by 
weight under undrained, drained, and drained and air-dried conditions. The average settled dry 
density of the tailings to be deposited into the TMF has been estimated to be 1.2 t/m3 in the early 
stages, increasing to an overall density of around 1.3 to 1.35 t/m3. It is expected that more extensive 
tailings beaches will develop with time for later stages of operation that will allow for sub-aerial 
(above water surface) tailings deposition to promote drainage, air drying, and consolidation of the 
tailings. 

Field results are depended on the deposition strategy, pond size and height of the storage facilities, 
area available for drying, thickness of deposited layers, climatic conditions at site and operating 
parameters of the processing plant. A suitable deposition plan and efficient operation of the facility 
can improve settled density for the project 

Geochemical Properties 

The geochemical characterization program, including total metals and acid-base accounting, completed by KP at 
SGS for IAMGOLD, has indicated that the majority of the rock contained in and surrounding the ore body will 
not have Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) or Metal Leaching (ML) potential.

18.10.3 Design Basis Overview 

Objectives 

The principal objectives of the TMF design are to provide secure storage for tailings and process water, and 
protect groundwater and surface waters during operations and post closure. The feasibility level design for the 
TMF has taken the following requirements into account: 

• Permanent, secure, and total confinement of all solid waste materials within an engineered facility. 

• Control and collection of potential seepage from the TMF basin and runoff from the embankments 
during operations. 

• Control, collection, and recycling of process water and runoff within the TMF basin to maintain a 
suitable operating pond volume and maintain the operating pond well away from the embankment. 

• The inclusion of monitoring features for all aspects of the TMF to compare actual facility performance 
against design expectations and help verify the ongoing safe operation of the facility. 

Embankment construction will be scheduled to provide sufficient storage capacity and freeboard in the TMF to 
temporarily store runoff resulting from the Inflow Design Flood (IDF). The design basis and operating criteria are 
based upon accepted national and international standards for mining dam design and operation (Canadian Dam 
Association - CDA, 2014, Mining Association of Canada, 2017).  

Dam Hazard Classification (DHC) 

The DHC has been determined based on the criteria below. 

• Population at risk and loss of life. 

• Environmental and cultural values. 

• Infrastructure and economics. 

The criteria were assessed based on the assumption that failure of the embankment would release all stored 
water and a portion of the tailings to the environment in an uncontrolled manner. A DHC was assigned for each 
of the individual categories listed above. The DHC was selected by taking the highest DHC from the individual 
categories. 

A hypothetical failure of the TMF embankment could potentially cause incremental losses along an inundation 
route downstream of the TMF. Water and sediments (from subsequent erosion) from a hypothetical failure of 
the embankment would be directed by the natural topography to the Falémé River. The Falémé River is the 
primary contributing factor to the DHC. Restoration or compensation of damage to the Falémé River from a 
potential breach in the embankment is suspected to be extremely difficult due to the consequences associated

with remediation of an international river. The Falémé River borders Mali (immediately downstream) and 
Mauritania (further downstream). 

The TMF has been identified as having a DHC of Extreme based on a review of the criteria outlined above. The 
Earthquake Design Ground Motion (EDGM) and Inflow Design Flood (IDF) thresholds used for the design reflect 
this classification.  

Seismic Design Criteria 

The EDGM for a facility with a DHC of EXTREME during operations is specified as the estimated ground 
acceleration generated during the 1 in 10,000-year earthquake or the MCE, whichever is higher. The peak 
ground acceleration (PGA) for the 1 in 10,000-year event is 0.069g assuming rock site conditions (Site class B; 
ASCE/SCI 7-10).  

Hydrologic Design Criteria 

The IDF for a facility with a DHC of EXTREME is specified as the runoff generated from the Probable Maximum 
Precipitation (PMP) event. The TMF is required to provide sufficient wet freeboard to temporarily store the IDF 
above the maximum operating level during operations. This event for the TMF equates to 524 mm of rainfall 
over 24 hours. The runoff that would report to the TMF during this rainfall event is estimated to be 
approximately 1,189,000 m3. For added security, the facility will also be equipped with a spillway capable of 
passing the PMP. 

18.10.4 TMF Design 

General 

Tailings will be pumped as a slurry from the process plant to the TMF via a tailings pipeline. The TMF will be 
constructed as a single cell facility within the valley located directly northwest of the plant site location. Initially 
constructed as a valley impoundment, the embankments will be raised to form a three-sided paddock style 
impoundment. Two (2) embankments will be constructed to establish the TMF, including the Northwest 
Embankment that straddles the natural valley, and the East Embankment that runs along the northeast and 
southeast side of the basin adjacent to the Malikoundi West Waste Dump. The TMF design will include an initial 
starter embankment (Stage 1) with ongoing raises using downstream construction methods throughout the life 
of the facility. 

The feasibility level design of the TMF includes an initial Stage 1 (starter) embankment with five subsequent 
embankment raises (i.e. Stage 2 to Stage 6) over the projected operational life of the facility. Staged 
development of the TMF offers the following advantages: 

• Reduction of initial capital expenditures. 

• Refining of design and construction methods as experience is gained with local conditions and/or as 
operating criteria change.

• Adjustment of plans at a future date in order to remain current with "state-of-the-art" engineering 
and environmental practices, etc. 

This staged approach will be used for the future design, construction, and operation of the facility as part of a 
continuous and integrated process to identify cost savings and enhance safety. The approach requires 
construction controls, monitoring, and review to improve the understanding of site-specific conditions.  

Storage Capacity and Filling Schedule 

The capacity and filling schedule of the TMF are based on the following: 

• Mill throughput data provided by Lycopodium (2018). 

• Reduction of initial capital expenditures. 

• Local topography, as provided by Lycopodium (2018). 

• The storage basin filling characteristics. 

• The estimated final average settled dry density of the tailings. 

• The supernatant pond volume and stormwater runoff reporting to the TMF during operations. 

• Temporary storage of runoff generated from storm events, up to and including the IDF. 

• Provision of overtopping protection for wave run-up. 

The filling schedule for the TMF is provided on Figure 18.3.  

The available storage capacity for each stage is based on the embankment layouts, crest elevations, and 
freeboard requirements. The actual filling schedule will be updated as required, based on the actual tailings dry 
density achieved and the amount of tailings deposited. The current design includes for the storage of all runoff 
under average precipitation conditions, temporary storage of the IDF, and a wave run-up allowance.

Figure 18.3 TMF Filling Schedule  

 

Embankment Cross-section 

Ferrocrete/duracrust and colluviual deposits are typically present near surface within the TMF basin foundation. 
The embankment foundations and TMF basin will be cleared, grubbed, and stripped of surface soils and 
unsuitable materials to expose stiff to hard ferrocrete/duracrust or compact to dense colluvial.  

Two embankments will be constructed to establish the TMF, including the Northwest Embankment that 
straddles the natural valley, and the East Embankment that runs along the northeast and southeast side of the 
basin adjacent to the Malikoundi West Waste Dump.  

The embankments will be constructed of zoned earthfill and rockfill with a composite liner installed on the 
upstream slope. Transition/filter zones will be established between the liner and the embankment rockfill to 
ensure internal stability.  

The downstream slopes will be 2.5H:1V. The upstream slopes will be 2.5H:1V with a 3 m wide mid-slope bench 
at each stage to facilitate the installation and tie-in of the geomembrane liner. The composite lining system will 
be installed on the upstream face of the embankment and within the basin to minimize seepage. The bedding 
material will be prepared on the slope and within the basin to support the liner.  

The crest width will be 10 m and the maximum embankment height above original ground varies from 
approximately 21.5 m along the plateau for the East Embankment that runs along the northeast and southwest 
side of the basin to 36.5 m in the valley along the Northwest Embankment.

The fill for the embankments will come from the open pits. Basin shaping will primary include development of 
the bench around the basin to facilitate installation of the geosynthetic lining system over the basin footprint 
and general dozer shaping within the basin to achieve the grades and surface required for the installation of the 
composite liner. Following removal of the surface soils from within the basin and the dozer shaping, the 
subgrade will be proof rolled with a smooth drum compactor followed by fill placement for the low permeability 
liner bedding layer for the composite lining system installation. 

Embankment Fill Zones 

The materials to be used for construction of the various components of the embankments are described below.  

• Liner Bedding - Soil (i.e. saprolite) for Embankment Fill (300 mm thick layer) - The liner bedding 
material shall consist of soil (i.e. saprolite) with a maximum particle size of 1 mm and placed and 
compacted in a 300 mm thick layer on the upstream face of the embankment to form a composite 
liner with the HDPE geomembrane.  

• Transition - Soil (i.e. laterite) for Embankment Fill (300 mm lifts) - The Zone A material shall consist 
of soil (i.e. laterite) with a maximum particle size of 30 mm and placed and compacted in 300 mm 
thick lifts in the upstream zone. The width of this zone will be 3 m.  

• Zone A - Soil (i.e. ferrocrete) for Embankment Fill (300 mm lifts) - The Zone A material shall consist 
of soil (i.e. ferricrete) with a maximum particle size of 75 mm and placed and compacted in 300 mm 
thick lifts in the upstream zone. The width of this zone will be 10 m.  

• Zone B - Rockfill for Embankment Fill (300 mm lifts) - The Zone B material shall consist of hard 
durable processed rockfill with a maximum particle size of 150 mm and placed and compacted in 
300 mm thick lifts in the upstream zone. The width of this zone will be 10 m. It is anticipated that 
production of this material will require selective excavation, closer blast hole spacing or processing 
(screening) to produce the specified gradation envelop. 

• Zone C - Rockfill for Embankment Fill (600 mm lifts) - The Zone C material shall consist of hard 
durable rockfill with a maximum particle size of 400 mm and placed in 600 mm thick lifts in the 
upstream zone. It is expected that the mine haul fleet traffic will provide the majority of the 
compaction for the Zone C material. The actual compactive effort and number of equipment passes 
will be confirmed with a test pad constructed prior fill placement. It is anticipated that production of 
this material may require selective excavation and/or closer blast hole spacing to produce the 
specified gradation envelop.  

• Zone D - Rockfill for Embankment Fill (2,000 mm lifts) - The Zone D material shall consist of hard 
durable fresh or non-weathered rockfill with a maximum particle size of 1,200 mm and placed in 
2,000 mm lifts in the downstream zone of the embankments. It is expected that the mine haul fleet 
traffic will provide the majority of compaction for the Zone D material. The material is not expected 
to require processing, except for the removal of oversized particles.

Geosynthetic Lining System 

The entire impoundment will be lined to contain the tailings solids and process water, and to reduce seepage 
from the facility. A composite liner consisting of a 60 mil HDPE geomembrane overlying a low permeability soil 
(saprolite) layer will be placed on the upstream slope of the embankments and over the entire basin footprint. 
The lining system will be installed over the prepared subgrade surface. 

The geosynthetic lining system will be installed in six stages. The lining system will be installed on the basin 
floor, basin side slopes, and upstream face of the Stage 1 embankment as part the Stage 1 construction. The 
lining system will be installed on the upper basin side slopes and upstream face of the remaining stages as part 
of the staged construction of the embankments.  

Seepage Collection Drains 

A Seepage Collection Drain will be installed in the foundation of the Northwest TMF embankment to collect 
potential seepage from the TMF. The seepage collection drains will consist of drainage sand and gravel and 100 
mm dia. corrugated perforated CPT pipe in an excavated trench. A non-woven geotextile separation layer will 
be installed between the drain sand and gravel and the foundation soils. The collected seepage will drain by 
gravity to a Seepage Collection Sump located downstream of the TMF basin where it can be monitored and 
pumped back to the TMF if required.  

Instrumentation 

Instrumentation will be installed in the embankment, embankment foundation, and Embankment Seepage 
Collection Drain to confirm that the TMF is performing as designed. The instrumentation will include:  

• Three vibrating wire piezometers (VWPs) installed in the Embankment Seepage Collection Drain and 
11 VWPs installed in the embankment fill will be used to monitor for a potential phreatic surface 
within the embankment.   

• One slope inclinometer installed during construction of Stage 1 at the toe of the Stage 6 Northwest 
Embankment, surface movement monuments installed every 250 m along the embankment crest 
following the completion of each raise of the Northwest Embankment (91 in total), and 3 slope 
inclinometers installed in the Stage 6 embankment to monitor for potential movement in the 
foundation and embankment fill.   

• Additional groundwater monitoring wells may need to be installed downstream of the TMF. 

The instrumentation will provide an early warning if the phreatic surface in the embankment or potential 
movement exceeds allowable levels. Trigger limits for the instrumentation will be defined in later stages of 
design as part of the Operations, Maintenance, and Surveillance (OMS) Manual for the TMF.

Stability 

The TMF is required to be stable under the design loading conditions. The required Factors of Safety (FoS) 
against slope instability as per CDA guidelines (2014) are: 

• Static stability: 

-   1.3 immediately following construction (undrained or total stress conditions) and prior to filling 

-   1.5 during operations and at closure (drained or effective stress conditions) 

• Pseudo-Static stability: 1.0 

• Post- earthquake (residual strengths) stability: 1.2 

Stability analyses for static loading during normal operating conditions were completed using SLOPE/W©, a 
two-dimensional Limit Equilibrium stability analysis software package. The stability models incorporated the 
proposed embankment configuration, estimated strengths of the fill and foundation materials, the projected 
tailings level, and the projected water levels. A review of the available site investigation data and observations 
made during the site investigations indicate that the embankment fill and foundation materials are not 
expected to liquefy. A 20% strength reduction was applied to the minimum undrained shear strength and the 
undrained shear strength ratio for the saprolite foundation unit for the post-earthquake loading analyses 
(Makdisi and Seed, 1978) to account for the potential for cyclic softening following the design earthquake.  

Two representative cross sections were selected for analysis based on the embankment design, geometry, 
height, and foundation conditions. The analyses considered the in-situ foundation conditions and the final 
tailings elevation for Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 6 (Ultimate) embankments. The influence of the abutting 
Malikoundi West Waste Dump was included in the analysis for Section 2 (East Embankment). It was assumed 
that Malikoundi West Waste Dump would be constructed to El. 193 m (i.e. Stage 3) prior to construction of the 
TMF and that the waste dump would be extended to adjoin the TMF following completion of Stages 4, 5, and 6. 
The target FoS are met or exceeded for all sections and loading conditions evaluated. The TMF embankments 
may be constructed to Stage 3 (El. 176 m) prior to filling. The adjacent Malikoundi West Waste Dump does not 
negatively impact the stability of the TMF.  

Seepage 

A composite liner consisting of a 60 mil HDPE geomembrane overlying a 300 mm thick fine grained soil layer 
(i.e. saprolite) will be placed on the upstream slope of the embankments and over the entire basin footprint to 
reduce seepage from the facility.

The potential leakage through the lining system was estimated with the supernatant pond at the 
Stage 6 maximum filling level. The seepage analyses considered leakage due to the presence of geomembrane 
defects. Leakage due to permeation was not considered, as this leakage rate is estimated to be several orders of 
magnitude less than the leakage due to geomembrane defects. The total estimated leakage for the Stage 6 TMF 
was calculated for the following: 

• Leakage through the basin floor. 

• Leakage through the basin side slopes and embankment for Stage 6. 

The total seepage from the TMF is estimated to be approximately 6.5 m3/hr.  

Tailings Management 

Tailings will be conveyed to the TMF as a conventional slurry and deposited from the upstream face of the TMF 
embankment. This deposition strategy will develop a low permeability tailings deposit adjacent to the 
embankment and maintain the supernatant pond away from the embankments and toward the central, 
southwest portion of the basin. Tailings will be deposited from additional locations around the perimeter of the 
TMF basin to optimize the basin filling and manage the location of the supernatant pond.  

The deposition plan will include for rotational discharge of tailings from several discharge locations to develop 
an exposed tailings beach. Following development of the tailing beach, the tailings discharge will be rotated to 
adjacent discharge locations to continue to develop the lateral extent of the tailings beach. The development of 
a tailings beach will allow for sub-aerial (above water surface) tailings deposition to achieve the following 
objectives: 

• Optimize the basin filling by depositing tailings in relatively thin layers around the perimeter of the 
facility above the supernatant pond surface. 

• Maintain the supernatant pond location well away from the embankments, while maintaining 
adequate depth adjacent to the water reclaim barge. 

• Maximize the settled density and strength of the tailings by promoting drainage of process water and 
air drying of the tailings.  

The conventional tailings slurry will be approximately 48% solids by weight. The tailings slurry will be conveyed 
to the TMF from the plant site via a HDPE pipeline. The pipeline will extend to the farthest discharge point along 
the embankment crest during Stage 1 operations with discharge spigots at approximately 25 m spacing along 
the embankment crest. The pipelines will be extended around the basin perimeter as required during 
operations. During subsequent staged construction, the pipelines will need to be raised to the staged 
embankment crest and perimeter bench around the TMF basin.

18.10.5 TMF Water Management 

Objectives 

The primary water management objectives for the TMF are as follows: 

• Maximize the recycle of process water and runoff water from the TMF to the plant site. 

• Divert run-off water reporting to the TMF from the upstream catchment areas. 

• Provide temporary containment of the IDF within the TMF basin during operations. 

The process limitations, available precipitation, and extreme storm event data were used to estimate the water 
reclaim, water removal and diversion requirements. The Water Reclaim System, Diversion System, Water 
Balance, and Stormwater Management for the TMF are summarized below. 

Water Reclaim System 

The Water Reclaim System at the TMF will reclaim water from the TMF to the plant site for use in the process. 
The system will include a barge, pump, and HDPE pipeline. The system will convey reclaim water to the plant 
site. The supernatant pond in the TMF basin will be managed to provide adequate draft for the barge.  

Diversion System 

Diversion ditches will be constructed upstream of the TMF basin during each stage of construction to reduce 
the amount of runoff entering the basin. The ditches were designed to divert runoff from storms up to and 
including the 1 in 200 year, 24-hour storm event. The ditches will be excavated into natural ground and will be 
trapezoidal in shape. The ditches in the southwest will be approximately 1.2 m deep with a 6 m wide base and 
2H:1V side slopes. The ditches in the northeast will be approximately 0.65 m deep with a 1 m wide base and 
2H:1V side slopes.  

Water Balance 

The water balance model for the TMF was developed to estimate the monthly pond volume in the TMF, 
quantify any reclaim water shortfalls that would require additional make-up water from the Fresh Water Pond 
(FWP), and determine if there is any period of excess water in the TMF that would potentially require treatment 
and release. 

The monthly operational water balance estimates were calculated using GoldSim software. The findings of the 
water balance are summarized as follows: 

• The estimated TMF pond volume will range from 39,000 m3 to 1.96 Mm3 under average precipitation 
conditions.

• The results from the TMF water balance indicate that the TMF will generally operate with a monthly 
net surplus of water based on average precipitation conditions. It is estimated that the TMF will be 
able to provide sufficient reclaim water during the wet season. In the dry season, a portion of the 
required reclaim water will need to be taken from the FWP. 

Storm Water Management 

The TMF has been sized to provide temporary storage of the IDF during operations. In addition, during 
operations, a spillway will be installed during each stage to convey the IDF from the TMF.  

The inflow to the TMF basin resulting from the IDF was estimated using HydroCAD© software. The estimated 
inflow was used to determine the required storage volume to temporarily contain the IDF and to size the 
spillways during operations. The analysis assumed that the diversion ditches would fail during the IDF and that 
all runoff within the upstream catchment area of the TMF would report to the TMF basin. 

The estimated IDF volume ranges from 928,400 m3 for Stage 1 to 1,189,000 m3 for Stage 6. Approximately 0.8 m 
to 1.0 m of wet freeboard is required during all stages of operation to temporarily store the IDF. A dry freeboard 
of 0.5 m is also required to provide overtopping protection for wave run-up. Although the TMF is planned to 
contain sufficient freeboard for the operating pond and containment of the IDF, for added security, emergency 
overflow spillways have been incorporated into the design for each stage to safely pass the IDF (in addition to 
the IDF temporarily stored in the TMF). The emergency overflow spillways will be located at the northwest 
abutments of the embankment. The emergency overflow spillways meet the recommendations by CDA (CDA, 
2014). The spillway invert ranges from 0.75 m to 1 m below the embankment crest and is designed for 
conveyance of the peak inflow resulting from the IDF storm event. The total freeboard above the maximum 
operating levels range from 1.8 m to 2.8 m for the 6 stages.  

18.10.6 Monitoring and Surveillance 

General 

The facilities will be operated in compliance with applicable international and national guidelines and standards. 
An OMS Manual and Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) for the TMF will be developed prior to operations. 
These documents will be used for operator training and support for the management of the TMF. 

A TMF manager shall be designated for the TMF. The TMF manager will have overall responsibility for the TMF, 
including the review of operational, monitoring, and surveillance data. The general monitoring and inspection 
protocols for the operation of the TMF are summarized in the following sections. 

Monitoring 

Monitoring of the TMF will be carried out at specified regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the TMF 
and to refine the operating practices. Key monitoring requirements will include: 

• Daily recording of the supernatant pond level.

• Daily recording of the tailings discharge location. 

• Monitoring of pump and pipeline performance for pressure fluctuations and potential leaks. 

• Equipping all water pumps and pipelines with devices to measure flows and volumes. Measurements 
will be used to calibrate the water balance and to adjust the water management strategy, as 
required. 

• Collection of site-specific meteorological data. The data will be used to calibrate the water balance 
and to adjust the water management strategy, as required.  

• Daily monitoring of piezometers during embankment construction. 

• Weekly monitoring of piezometers during operations. 

• Monthly monitoring of the embankment crest, surface movement monument surveys, and review of 
slope inclinometer data to confirm that embankment displacement has not occurred. 

• Quarterly surveys of the deposited tailings surface and supernatant pond extents and depth to 
estimate the tailings in situ settled dry density. 

The monitoring data will be reviewed by the TMF manager and submitted to the Design Engineer for review. 

Inspections 

Regular inspections of the TMF will be completed as part of the TMF operations to confirm that the TMF is 
being operated in accordance with the design intent. The inspections will include: 

• Visual inspection of the embankment to check for evidence of displacement and/or instability.  

• Visual inspection of the tailings beaches to identify situations that may require adjustments to tailings 
deposition practices.  

• Visual Inspection of the supernatant pond location and water level, and water levels in Sediment 
Basin #1, and the Seepage Collection Drain Sump.  

• Visual inspection of the pipelines and pumps to identify any damage, leaks, and other operational 
issues will need to be addressed.  

The following inspections will be completed in addition to the regular inspections by the TMF operators:   

• Detailed monthly inspections of all the TMF components by the TMF Manager. 

• Detailed inspections by the TMF Manager following any extreme precipitation or seismic event. 

• An annual inspection by the Design Engineer will be completed to verify that all components are 
performing as designed and that the facilities are being operated as intended.

for the construction and operation of the TMF shall be kept on site and available for review by authorities on 
short notice. 

18.10.7 Reclamation and Closure 

Reclamation and closure will be based on the following general goals and objectives: 

• Reclamation goals and objectives will be considered during the design of the TMF. 

• Reclamation goals and objectives will be periodically updated during construction and operations. 

• Progressive reclamation will be implemented wherever possible. 

• Upon cessation of operations, the TMF will be decommissioned and reclaimed to allow for future 
land use as guided by local regulators. 

• Reclamation and closure construction will be designed to meet long-term physical and chemical 
stability objectives. 

Generally, the closure work will consist of the following: 

• Removal of all ponded water. 

• Decommissioning and dismantling of all tailings delivery and distribution pipework. 

• Decommissioning and dismantling of all water reclaim and the pump barge. 

• Decommissioning and dismantling of all seepage recycle pipework and pumps, assuming that the 
seepage water meets water quality objectives. 

• Placement of a soil cover and vegetation on the tailings to minimize water infiltration and to improve 
site aesthetics. 

• Construction of final water management measures (spillways, ditches, berms, etc.) to convey run-off 
from the IDF to the environment.

18.11 Fresh Water Pond 

18.11.1 Introduction 

KP completed a FS level design for the FWP for the Project. The FWP will be constructed to store water to 
support mine operations. A storage volume of 2.5 Mm3 has been selected by IAMGOLD to ensure adequate 
capacity to provide water to the process under all operating and climatic scenarios. The FWP will be constructed 
within the valley feature located directly west of the Malikoundi North Open Pit and northeast of the 
Malikoundi West Waste Dump. 

18.11.2 Design Basis Overview 

The design basis and operating criteria are based upon accepted national and international standards for mining 
dam design and operation, available site information, and the operational requirements developed in 
consultation with Lycopodium and IAMGOLD. The FWP has been designed to meet the Canadian Dam 
Association Technical Guidelines for Mining Dams (CDA, 2014), and includes freeboard and design earthquake 
ground motion (DEGM) considerations to minimize operational risks. The FWP has been identified as having a 
Dam Hazard Classification of Extreme based on the foreseeable consequences. 

18.11.3 Embankment Section and Basin Lining System 

General 

The typical embankment section has been developed based on the results of the stability assessment (KP, 
2018b) and the construction staging and methodology proposed by AGP. The FWP has been designed as a lined 
valley impoundment confined by an earth embankment. The embankment has been designed using available 
materials from mining activities and local borrow sources as required. The embankment will be buttressed to 
the downstream by waste overburden. 

The embankment has been designed to crest El. 157.0 m to provide 2.5 Mm3 of fresh water storage in addition 
to freeboard contingencies for storm water runoff management (under normal operating conditions), excess 
water discharge, wave run-up, and conveyance of the IDF through the Overflow Spillway.  

Embankment Section 

The overall downstream slope of the FWP embankment will be 3H:1V with a 20 m wide buttress constructed to 
El. 135 m along the downstream toe. The overall upstream slope will be 3.5H:1V with a 3 m internal bench at 
El. 147 m to accommodate for the geomembrane liner installation and staged embankment construction. A 0.3 
m thick liner bedding layer will be placed along the upstream slope of the embankment to reduce the risk of 
damage to the HDPE liner and to reduce the potential for seepage and excess pore pressures to develop within 
the embankment fill during a rapid drawdown scenario. A seepage drain will be located along the toe of the 
liner bedding material to convey any potential seepage from the basin below the embankment.

5084\16.04\5084-REP-001  
  

Page 18.24 

September 2018 
Lycopodium Minerals Canada Ltd 

Basin Lining System 

The FWP basin and upstream embankment face will be lined with a geosynthetic lining system to reduce 
seepage from the facility. The lining system will include a 60 mil HDPE geomembrane installed over a 12 oz./yd2 
non-woven geotextile and a sand and gravel liner bedding cushion layer on the upstream face of the 
embankment. A basin underdrain will be installed below the liner system along the floor of the FWP and the toe 
of the embankment at the base of the liner bedding layer to collect seepage. 

18.11.4 Water Management 

During operations, fresh water will be obtained from direct precipitation on the pond (when present) and runoff 
from the surrounding catchment area, Malikoundi West Waste Dump, Malikoundi and Malikoundi North Pits, 
and groundwater inflow into the Malikoundi and Malikoundi North Pits. In addition, the facility will serve as a 
settling basin for the surface water runoff originating from the contributing catchment areas, and reduce the 
total suspended solids in the runoff prior to discharge to the environment (KP, 2018c). 

The FWP will include an Overflow Spillway to route excess water and flows through the FWP basin. The spillway 
will consist of a trapezoidal channel. The spillway will discharge downstream of the FWP and the toes of the 
embankment and buttress will be lined as required with geotextile and rip rap to minimize erosion. The 
Overflow Spillway has been designed as a two-stage channel, with the lower portion (Stage 1) designed to 
discharge excess water from normal operating conditions up to the EDS, and the upper portion (Stage 2) 
designed to convey the peak flow resulting from the IDF. 

Details regarding the site wide surface water management plan, and estimation of normal operating surface 
water flows to the FWP are summarized in the Site Wide Surface Water Management Design (KP, 2018c), and 
Site Wide Water Balance (KP, 2018d), respectively.  

18.11.5 Monitoring and Instrumentation 

The FWP will require the installation of geotechnical instrumentation to support the monitoring of the FWP 
during the initial construction of the embankment, and long term operations of the facility. The instrumentation 
is required to ensure the facility is meeting or exceeding the design intent, and to detect for potential changes 
in the facility's performance. The instrumentation will be installed during the initial construction of the facility 
and will include vibrating wire piezometers, an inclinometer and survey monuments. Regular data collection 
from the instrumentation will be completed to ensure the facility is meeting the design intent.

18.12 Site Wide Water Management Plan 

18.12.1 Introduction 

KP completed a FS level site wide water management plan for the Project. The site water management plan and 
feasibility design of the associated water management measures have been developed based on the FS level 
site arrangement, operational requirements and environmental site conditions. The proposed plan and 
measures will allow for the management of runoff from disturbed areas while minimizing the runoff from 
undisturbed areas reporting to the mine site. 

Following a precipitation event, the runoff will be managed to reduce the total suspended solids prior to 
discharge to the environment. This is a requirement of the Project's operating conditions.  

The primary objectives of the site water management plan are as follows: 

• To collect runoff originating within disturbed areas, through a series of ditches and berms, and 
convey the runoff to one of a number of sediment basins, where the majority of the total suspended 
solids can settle out prior to sending the water to the FWP (for potential use in the mining process) or 
releasing it to the environment. 

• To minimize the volume of runoff entering the mine site from undisturbed areas by diverting 
upstream runoff around mine infrastructure through a series of diversion berms and ditches. 

18.12.2 Catchment Areas 

The development of the site water management plan was based on dividing the project area into two main 
types of catchment areas (Undisturbed and Disturbed Catchment Areas). The two main types of catchment 
areas are described as follows: 

• Undisturbed Catchment Areas - Areas within (or adjacent to) the main project footprint that will not 
be disturbed by the project operations. In general, the undisturbed catchment areas consist of desert 
shrub terrain that is flat to gently sloping. Where feasible, surface water runoff from the undisturbed 
catchment areas will be diverted around mine infrastructure areas, reporting directly to the 
environment. 

• Disturbed Catchment Areas - Areas within the project footprint that are disturbed by project 
activities and whose runoff may require treatment prior to discharge (i.e. settling of suspended 
solids). Surface runoff from the disturbed catchment areas will be conveyed by ditches and 
temporarily stored in sediment basins. Disturbed areas include the pits, waste dumps, and TMF and 
FWP embankments, and the Plant Site. 

18.12.3 Methodology 

The runoff volumes and peak runoff flows resulting from the design storm events were estimated using 
HydroCAD® (HydroCAD®, 2015).  The runoff volumes and peak flows were then used to determine the storage

capacity of the sediment basins and typical details of the water management measures (collection/diversion 
ditches, diversion berms and sediment basin overflow channels). 

18.12.4 Water Management Measures 

General 

Water management measures for the Project will include a series of diversion berms, collection and diversion 
ditches, sediment basins, and water transfer pipelines. In general, runoff from the various catchment areas will 
be directed towards the water management structures. If required, site specific regrading may be conducted in 
order to accomplish this. 

Diversion Berms 

Diversion berms will be constructed to facilitate and direct runoff away from the pits, and to help direct site 
runoff to collection ditches or sediment basins. The berms will have a minimum height of 0.5 m, a crest width of 
approximately 0.5 m and side slopes of 1.5H:1V. Berms will be constructed from durable processed waste rock 
excavated from the pits and nominally compacted. Berms will be used where necessary to suit site specific 
conditions. 

Diversion and Collection Ditches 

In order to convey surface runoff around and away from the mine site infrastructure, or to the sediment basins 
(including the FWP), diversion/collection ditches will be constructed. The diversion/collection ditches have been 
designed to safely convey the 1 in 200 year, 24-hour storm event. 

Each diversion/collection ditch will be trapezoidal in section with 2H:1V side slopes. Ditches will be excavated 
into the existing overburden or formed by grading surface material to achieve the required ditch geometry. 
Excavated or graded material will be used to form a berm alongside the ditch in order to prevent runoff from 
adjacent areas from flowing into the ditch. It is suspected that the majority of the ditches will be constructed in 
overburden and will require erosion protection along their base and side slopes. Erosion protection will likely 
consist of riprap overlying non-woven geotextile (if required).  

Sediment Basins 

Runoff from disturbed areas will be conveyed to one of the sediment basins, to the FWP or to the Event Pond at 
the Plant Site prior to discharge or use as process water at the Plant Site. The main components of the sediment 
basins include the basin geometry (retention capacity for runoff), discharge structure(s) (to facilitate drainage) 
and overflow channel (to safely release extreme event runoff).  

• Basin Geometry - The sediment basins have been sized for temporary storage of runoff resulting 
from the 1 in 10 year, 24-hour storm event. Temporary storage of this runoff will allow the majority 
of the suspended solids to settle out prior to the water being discharged to the environment or

pumped to the FWP for eventual use in the milling process. Sediment basins have been sized based 
on site specific conditions and inputs from industry standard recommendations that include: 

o Sediment Storage: 0.5 m above the basin floor for storage of accumulated sediment 

o Operating Pond Volume: Varies but equals volume of runoff reporting to basin from the 1 in 
10 year, 24-hour storm event 

o Wet Freeboard: Varies but equals peak flow depth into the overflow channel, resulting from 
the 1 in 200 year, 24-hour storm event 

o Dry Freeboard: 0.5 m above the peak spillway flow depth 

• Decant Structures - Each sediment basin will be equipped with a floating decant system to discharge 
water from the basin to the environment during normal operating conditions. It is estimated that the 
water stored in these basins will be released over a period of approximately one to five days 
following the design storm event (1 in 10 year, 24-hour event). 

• Overflow Channel - Each sediment basin will be equipped with an overflow channel to convey flows 
resulting from storm events greater than the 1 in 10 year, 24-hour event, and up to and including the 
1 in 200 year, 24-hour event, to the downstream environment. The peak flows were calculated to 
determine the required channel width, depth and erosion protection requirements.  The overflow 
channels will be trapezoidal in section and lined with riprap overlying non-woven geotextile.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Market Studies 

No formal market studies have been undertaken. 

A gold price of $1,200/oz has been used for the Mineral Reserve estimate and $1,250/oz has been used for the 
economic analysis. 

The Project will produce gold doré which is readily marketable on an 'ex-works' or 'delivered' basis to a number 
of international refineries.  There are no indications of the presence of penalty elements that may impact the 
price or render the product unsalable. 

19.2 Contracts 

There are no material contracts or agreements in place as of the effective date of this report.  Refining contracts 
are typically put in place with well recognized international refineries and sales are made based on spot gold 
prices.  These contracts typically include fees for transportation of the product from the site, insurance, 
assaying, refining and an allowance for metal losses during refining.  The ability to get a contract in place for the 
sale of doré prior to start of production is not seen as a risk to the Project.  IAMGOLD has contracts in place for 
sale of gold from its producing mines and it has been assumed that Boto doré will attract similar terms.

• Decree No. 2004-647 of May 17, 2004, establishing the terms of application of Act No. 2003-36 of 
November 24, 2003, on the Mining Code. 

• Act No. 2009-24 of July 8, 2009, on the Sanitation Code. 

• Act 81-13 of March 4, 1981, on the Water Code. 

The main environmental and social requirements in accordance with the Mining Code are: 

• Completing an ESIA in compliance with the Environment Code and its regulations (Section 83-CM). 

• Creating a mine site reclamation fund at the Caisse de dépôt et de consignation (Deposit and 
Consignment Office) (Section 84-CM). 

As for the main environmental and social requirements in accordance with the Environment Code, they are: 

• The necessity of completing an impact study and implementing an Environmental and Social 
Management Plan (ESMP) (Section L. 44 et seq. of the Code and its regulations).  

• The acquisition of an environmental compliance certification granted by the Directorate of 
Environment and Classified Establishments (DEEC) of Senegal after: i) completion of the ESIA by a 
certified studies office (by the DEEC); ii) validation of the ESIA report by the technical committee; and 
iii) public hearing. The ESIA's Terms of Reference must be approved in advance by the DEEC. 

• As part of the environmental assessment, there is a requirement to notify the authorities of 
neighbouring countries of a mining operation i) if operations are liable to have a cross-border impact 
(section L44 of the Environment Code), or ii) if the mining operation must use shared infrastructures 
or resources (e.g. drawing water from a river on the border).  

• Compliance with safe distance rules: a mining operation is a classified establishment, i.e. it can 
include facilities deemed classified for the protection of the environment (grinder, crusher, 
hydrocarbon or chemical depot, etc.). Section L 13 stipulates that a first class classified facility 
(applicable to the mining project) must be located at least 500 m from a watercourse, habitations, 
thoroughfares, and water catchment areas. After verification with the Directorate of Classified 
Facilities, it was determined that pits are also considered classified facilities, but their distance to 
watercourses and habitations can be discussed. 

• A requirement to consult local communities as part of the ESIA procedure for a mining project, 
because the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), which is part of the ESIA, must take 
into account their concerns (Section L 52-CE). Public consultation is done upstream and downstream 
(Section 2 – Order No. 9468 MJEHP-DEEC of November 28, 2001, on the regulation of public

20.2 Environmental and Social Impact Study 

A summary analysis of the initial environmental and social status of the exploration permit was carried out in 
2014 by TROPICA Environmental Consultants and was completed during the preliminary study by field 
investigations. 

In order to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements as well as the World Bank Group Guidelines, an 
environmental and social impact study process was initiated in June 2015 and to be completed in 2018 for the 
Project. The mandate to complete the impact study was awarded to Norda Stelo, who collaborated with the 
Senegalese study firm Synergie Environnement and the Canadian firm BBA to carry out the study. 

To properly understand the Project's human, physical and biological context, baseline environmental studies on 
social sanitation conditions, public health, fauna, flora and biodiversity, surface water and ground water quality, 
the water regime, and the cultural heritage were completed in 2015, in the first half of 2016, and in the second 
half of 2017. Tailings and waste geochemical characterization studies were also conducted during these periods. 

The upstream public consultation process took place in 2016, and a public inquiry was made in May and June 
2016, at the request of the Kédougou region Governor. 

The complete ESIA report, including the ESMP and the closure and reclamation framework, were submitted to 
the authorities in 2016, on the basis of the Project as developed as part of the original prefeasibility study. At 
the request of IAMGOLD, the impact study validation procedure was suspended due to the continuation of 
technical studies. 

Following the publication of the optimized prefeasibility study and the launch of the FS, the ESIA report was 
updated with new data at the end of the first half of 2018 and submitted to the Ministry of Environment for 
instruction and validation. The report was reviewed in April 2018 by the technical committee, representing all 
key and administrative stakeholders, and additional information was requested. The amended report taking 
into consideration this feedback was submitted to the Ministry of Environment in May 2018. 

The highlights of the baseline environmental studies and the impact study are presented in the following 
sections. The complete ESIA report contains more detailed information. It must be noted that the information 
presented in the following sections are from the ESIA filed in 2018.

50 m in the uplands, plains and alluvial valleys of the sedimentary basin. There are four main landscape entities: 
hills, cuirass plateaus, plains, and riverbanks.  

Each of these entities is characterized by a specific vegetation cover type, use, or human activities. Hills are 
covered with shrubs with a rather limited human presence, while riverbanks, which are densely wooded, 
remain bio-corridors and major biodiversity areas with significant human activities. Plains are the preferred 
areas for habitation. Cuirass plateaus often host a grass savannah type vegetation used for pasture.

Climate 

Climate data for the Boto mine site comes from the closest weather station, which is at Kédougou. For the 
purposes of the study, IAMGOLD acquired the most recent data from the National Agency of Civil Aviation and 
Meteorology (ANACIM) over the 1985-2014 period. This data comes from the Kédougou station. The climate of 
the Kédougou region which hosts the Project is of the Sudano-Guinean type. It is located between 7° and 12° 
north latitude and constitutes a transitional zone toward Guinean humid subtropical climate. The Boto zone's 
climate is characterized by seasonal variations (a four-month humid season and an eight-month dry season), 
reinforced by a continental touch with effects discernible late in the dry season. To obtain climate data specific 
to the Project's site, a latest generation meteorological station was installed in Spring 2016, which provides real-
time data. 

Temperature  

The analysis of monthly temperature averages charts for the 1968-2014 period shows that temperatures are at 
their lowest at the end and beginning of the year, and they gradually increase during the year. There is a 
relative drop in temperature in July, August and September and the highest temperatures are observed in April 
and May, as shown in the figure below.

Figure 20.5 Heat Regime at the Kédougou Weather Station (1968‐ 2014) 

                         

Kédougou's annual temperature average is 28.4°C, and the annual temperature range average is 14°C. Diurnal 
variations are between 14°C (April) and 17°C (December). Kédougou's temperature extremes during the 1978-
2007 period are 41.4°C (April 2007) and 14.6°C (December 2002).  

Relative Humidity  

Relative humidity is the ratio of water vapour in the air to the air's absorption capacity at a given temperature. 
It varies based on seasons. During the rainy season (June to October), it is affected by the monsoon, while 
during the dry season, it is affected by continental trade winds.  

In the region studied, average annual relative humidity is at its highest in August (81%) and at its lowest in 
February (29.1%). Maximum relative humidity is at its highest in September (97.5%) and at its lowest in 
February (44.9%). As for minimum relative humidity, it varies between 64% in August and 13.4% in February.

Winds  

Wind conditions are characterized by seasonal variations in prevailing wind directions, with easterly winds or 
the harmattan, which blows for practically the entire year and the maritime trade winds from the west 
(December, January). Wind speed rarely exceeds 3 m/s. But the wind can reach speeds of 3.3 m/s in May and 
2.8 m/s in June, decreasing to 1.5 m/s in August. 

The harmattan can be felt in this zone starting in February. In May-June, it meets the monsoon from the Gulf of 
Guinea, which brings humidity. This is the period of tornadoes and storms, followed by the rainy season until 
October. In November, the monsoon is replaced with westerly winds (maritime trade winds). 

Insolation  

Insolation is the factor that directly affects temperature. In the region studied, over the period of 1968 to 2005, 
average insolation is at its highest in April (9.1 h/d) and May (8.3 h/d), and drops to its lowest in August 
(6.2 h/d), July (6.7 h/d) and September (7.0 h/d). The monthly average rarely exceeds 10 h, especially during the 
dry season. 

Evaporation  

Evaporation depends on temperature, insolation, wind speed and relative humidity. It increases with 
temperature, insolation and wind speed, but decreases with relative humidity. In Kédougou, over the period of 
1985 to 2014, the monthly average for evaporated water varies similarly to insolation and temperature. It is at 
its highest in March with 307 mm and at its lowest in September with 49 mm. The annual average during this 
period is 2,089 mm. There seems to be a slight increase in evaporation between the period of 1968-2005 and 
the period of 1985-2014. This could be partially attributable to the higher temperatures recorded in the past 
few years.   

Rainfall 

Rainfall in the region hosting the permit is distinctive of the Sudanese zone with a two-season regime: a humid 
season from June to September-October, and a dry non-rainy season from November to April. Rainfalls are only 
observed during five or six months (May to September or October), and can continue until November in the 
event of a late season. Annual pluviometry varies between 600 mm and 1,900 mm. The average pluviometry for 
the period of 1923-2006 is 1,247 mm, while the one for the period of 1985-2014 is 1,191 mm. The highest 
pluviometry was recorded in 2006 (1,966 mm), and the lowest, in 2007 (685 mm). There seems to have been a 
decrease in average annual rainfall from the period of 1923-2006 to the period of 1985-2014. This decrease is 
mainly observed in June and October. However, pluviometry is characterized by high internal variability, as the 
average annual total can be below average by over 400 mm (1990, 1992, and 2007), or above average by nearly 
950 mm (1954).

Surface Water Hydrology 

The Boto exploration area is located in the hydrological basin of the Falémé River, which is a tributary to the 
Senegal River, and it is the largest watercourse in the zone. This perennial river, whose water regime is closely 
related to the rainfall regime, constitutes a natural border between Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.  

The river drains a hydrological basin which extends from latitudes 12°11 N to 14°27 N, and longitudes 11°10 W 
to 12°13 W, and covers an area of 28,900 km² in Kidira, spread over Mali (47.8%), Guinea (12.5%), and Senegal 
(39.7%). The Senegalese part of the basin is centred in the Bakel and Saraya Departments, respectively located 
in regions of Tambacounda and Kédougou. The river's total length is 650 km.  

Falémé's water regime combines a rising stage during the rainy period, and falling stage during the dry period. 
The rising stage lasts four months (May to August), including three months of high water (July, August, and 
September). Hydrology is at its highest in September, out of sync with the highest rainfall, which is in August. 
This one-month difference is due to periods of capillary retention and runoff organization. The falling stage 
starts in September and continues until May, which is the beginning of the rainy season on the basin. 

The Falémé River is essentially fed by rain water, and its drainage is characterized by high irregularity and high 
interannual variability. Drainage is generally observed throughout the year. The table below shows the Falémé 
River's flow for three hydrometric stations located on the river, based on recurrences of dry and humid years. It 
must be noted that the Fadougou station is located directly downstream from the location where it is planned 
to draw fresh water to feed the mine site.

Table 20.1 Falémé River Flow Frequency at the Hydrometric Stations of Kidira, Gourbassi, and 
Fadougou (m3/sec) 

 

The main tributary to the Falémé River is the Balinko River from Guinea and acting as a natural border with 
Mali, including the eastern part of the permit near Guémédji. 

There is also another tributary in the northern part of the permit, the Koila Kobé, which is crossed by the Boféto 
Bridge and is a temporary river originating in Guinea.  

Other temporary and less important watercourses include the Sondogna, the Kiriboung, and the Boto, which 
are also tributaries to the Falémé River. 

Surface water resources in the project zone are mainly used to meet the local populations' domestic needs. 
These mainly include consumption by the populations and cattle, laundry and swimming. Surface water 
resources are also used by local populations for gold washing at small-scale mining sites. 

Two sampling campaigns (June 2015 and February 2016) were carried out to establish the current surface water 
quality status. Broadly, surface waters are of poor quality due to the generalized presence of fecal and total 
coliforms. However, chemical metrics such as cyanide and heavy metals are generally present in low or 
undetectable concentrations.  

Hydrogeology 

The permit zone is located in the hydrogeological basin of the Falémé River and the ground water resources 
depend of the formations in place, of their weathering, of tectonic accidents such as faults and of food 
conditions, which depend on the climate. Two types of ground water formations are observed: high ground 
water contained in perched colluvial-alluvial water tables and in clay or sand alterites, and deep ground water 
from the fissure or fault zone of the crystalline or foliated crystalline bedrock. 

Ground water is used for the local populations' domestic needs and provided by the few existing wells and 
boreholes in the area. 

A series of piezometers were installed in the Boto sector at the location of the future mining facilities to 
establish ground water quality before conducting the project. These piezometers will be used to monitor the 
water table's quality based on the sensitivity of each type of ground water formation.

Two sampling campaigns were completed in 2015 and 2016 to collect data on ground water quality before 
conducting the project. Generally, ground waters are of poor quality, as most samples are contaminated with 
coliforms and streptococci, except at a few points. Arsenic was detected in 17 samples from the first campaign, 
but only one sample exceeded the WHO's standard (0.03 mg/l). In the second campaign, the pH of traditional 
wells exceeded the standard; only the boreholes complied with the standard, except for one.  

20.2.2 Biological Environment 

Flora  

Existing plant formations vary based on topographical units. They include savannah woodland, as well as 
grassland savannah, on cuirass plateaus, and dry woodland and wooded savannah on hills. On more extended 
slope biotopes, there are wooded savannahs and open forests, while the thalweg hosts gallery forests with 
arborescence around the stream system.  

Two main strata are observed: the grass cover made up of the species Andropogon pseudapricus and 
Andropogon gayanus characterized by its vulnerability to bush fires and the wood population including 
Sudanese and Sudan-Sahelian species. 

Recent studies in the Boto sector list 205 plant species, including 80 woody species and 125 herbaceous species. 
In addition to the ecosystemic diversity, there is also intraspecific diversity. The vegetation cover rate is 
important because the average density is 446 individuals per hectare, but it is not homogenous as it varies 
between 266 and 136 individuals per hectare, Plant formations are mainly represented by the shrub to wooded 
savannah (74.1%) and the grass savannah (13.5%). Gallery forest and open forest cover respectively 5.2% and 
3.6% of the total area of the study zone. 

Out of the identified species, 11 are threatened, 9 are partially protected, and 3 are fully protected, under the 
national legislation. 

A few habitats with an ecological potential were also identified as part of the ESIA. They are: 

• The silty banks of watercourses, which include threatened and rare species, such as Borassus 
aethiopum, Celtis toka, Cola laurifoli, Diospyros mespiliformis, and Saba senegalensis. 

• Bamboo groves, which are the specific habitats of a threatened species of the Senegalese flora, 
Oxytenanthera abyssinica. 

• The open forest, which includes Holarrhena floribunda. 

• Wooded savannahs of low plains, which include Acalypha senensis. 

• Shrub savannahs with boval, which can host Lepidagathis capilliformis, Indigofera leptoclada and 
Ozoroa pulcherrima.

Gallery forests include threatened or rare species, such as Cassia sieberiana, Diospyros mespiliformis, Khaya 
senegalensis, Saba senegalensis, and Pavetta cinereifolia. These forest resources are exploited, namely by the 
local communities, for various uses: food (edible fruits, culinary usage), medication, construction, source of 
energy, etc. 

Regarding protected areas, the permit is located in part in the Zone d'Intérêt Cynégétique (ZIC) (hunting zone) of 
Falémé. It covers 177.5 ha of this ZIC, which has a total area of 1,360,000 ha. In a ZIC, the fauna has a partial 
protection for its development, but certain species have particular statuses (full protection, partial protection, 
protection of endemic species, etc.). Additionally, the permit zone is located at more than 100 km south-west of 
Niokolo-Koba National Park (PNNK). 

Figure 20.5 and Figure 20.6 show the various plant formations and locations where special status plant species 
were identified in the study zone.

Fauna 

The diversity of biotopes or habitats in the zone affects the diversity of the fauna. This fauna, more specifically 
mammals, has been subject to a regression during the past decades due to several natural or human factors, 
including climate change, increased rural population, poaching, and disruptive activities such as small-scale 
mining. 

The wildlife is subject to various threats and constraints, the most significant ones being small-scale mining 
activities, which progressively developing in the Kédougou region, namely near the Boto 5 deposit, in Fadougou, 
Guémédji, and Diakha-Sénégal, the forest agrarian system in which new lands are progressively being cleared, 
logging conducted as part of the exploitation of forest resources, bush fires, transhumance, the early depletion 
of ponds and poaching. 

The latest inventories from July and November 2015 identified four reptile species: a garter snake species 
(Psammophis sp.), the red-sided skink (Trachylepis (Mabuya) perrotetii), the African spurred tortoise 
(Centrochelys (Geochelone) sulcata) and the Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus).  

The number of bird species listed in Senegal varies based on the sources. According to Bird Life international 
(2016), there are 548 bird species in Senegal, including 135 species of water birds. Migratory species, i.e. those 
with populations that move to other regions on a seasonal basis, account for 44% of avian species observed in 
Senegal, or 242 species (Bird Life International, 2016). More than half of these migratory species are of 
Palearctic origin and migrate to Senegal during the northern winter (Coulthard, 2001). 

16 bird species in Senegal are internationally considered critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable by 
the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2016). 17 additional species are considered 
threatened by the IUCN (2016). Based on the known distribution area, 13 of these species could be observed in 
the Project's study zone. Out of these, nine are resident species in the region and three are Palearctic species 
that winter in Africa. The red-footed falcon is a Palearctic species that could be observed during its migration to 
Southern Africa. 

A total of 38 fish species from 12 families were listed during the two experimental fishery campaigns carried out 
in the study zone by Norda Stelo and Synergie in July 2015 (high water period) and in December 2015 (recession 
period). The most species-rich families are the Mochokidae (nine species), representing nearly 25% of all 
captured species, followed by the Cichlidae (five species), the Claroteidae (five species), the Cyprinidae (five 
species), the Alestidae (five species) and the Mormyridae (three species). The other families are represented by 
one or two species. By comparison, as part of a study performed in 2011 in the Boto permit zone, a total of 21 
species were collected in the Falémé and Koïla Kabé rivers (Tropica, 2013). The Cichlidae family was the most 
represented, with four species, following by the Alestidae, with three species. The number of fish species 
captured was greater during the second fishery campaign, with 30 species from 11 families, compared with 22 
species divided into 10 families during the first campaign, in July 2015. 

The composition of the fish communities differs markedly between the two listing seasons. Out of the 38 fish 
species listed in total for both listings, less than half, or 14 species, are common to both campaigns. Combining 
the fishery results for both seasons shows that fish communities are richer in the Falémé (24 species) and

Balinko (23 species) rivers than in the Koïla Kabé River (13 species). The communities of the three rivers are 
relatively more diverse, with only nine common species out of a total of 38 listed species. Finally, the 
communities of the Falémé and Balinko rivers are the ones with the most similarities, with 16 fish species in 
common. 

According to IUCN (2016), Senegal has 187 mammal species, including sea mammals (whales, dolphins, 
manatees). Out of those species, one is extinct in the wild (scimitar oryx), one is critically endangered (dama 
gazelle), four are endangered, twelve are vulnerable and five are near threatened, based on the IUCN Red List.  

The 2015 field inventories identified twelve mammal species in the Project's study zone. The most common 
species are the green monkey and the striped ground squirrel. Two of these observed species, the Cape 
bushbuck and the Gambian sun squirrel, were not reported as present in the region during the inquiry 
conducted among local communities. None of species observed have a special status on the IUCN Red List. 
However, the hippopotamus is fully protected in accordance with Decree No. 86-844 on Hunting and Fauna 
Protection Code. 

Meetings with the local communities in 2017 confirmed the presence of chimpanzees around the majority of 
villages visited. The presence of chimpanzees was also confirmed by observing several indications of indirect 
presence along the transects made in 2017 on the concession: nests (140 in total), fecies, and scraps of food. 
Additionally, images obtained from camera traps confirmed the presence of 19 species of mammals in the study 
zone, including the chimpanzee and two other species with a precarious status: the common hippopotamus and 
the Guinea baboon. Based on the results from camera traps, gallery forests represent the habitat with the 
richest biodiversity. In total, 20 species of mammals were identified during the 2017 inventories, which brings 
the total number of confirmed species in the study zone to 22 mammals, including the results from the 2015 
inventories (small mammals included). Several additional species were added to the list of large and medium 
mammal species present in the study zone, including the chimpanzee, the jackal, the greater cane rat, the 
Guinea baboon and the civet. Out of the 20 mammal species still observed today, five have a special status in 
the IUCN Red List: the chimpanzee (endangered), the common hippopotamus and the lion (vulnerable), and the 
leopard and the Guinea baboon (near threatened). 

20.2.3 Human Environment 

Based on the 2013 census, the population of the Saraya Department was 50,724, or 33.5% of the total 
population of the Kédougou region. The Saraya commune, administrative centre of the department, had a 
population of barely over 2,700 inhabitants, far less than the rural communities of Madina Baffé 
(6,782 inhabitants) and Bembou (13,646 inhabitants). 

The rural community of Madina Baffé, where the permit zone is located, covers an area of 965.8 km2, for an 
average population density of approximately seven inhabitants per km2.  

In the permit zone, there are two major villages and six hamlets with a total population of more than 
3,000 inhabitants, or nearly 50% of the population of the rural community. The three main villages 
are Guémédji, Noumoufoukha and Madina Baffé. Many other villages and hamlets are located near the Project

zone or access road connecting Boto to the town of Saraya. Figure 20.7 below shows the location of the villages 
and hamlets in the zone. 

Figure 20.10 Map showing the Location of the Villages and Hamlets in the Boto Zone 

 
The population present in the Project zone is relatively young and is 98% Muslim; majority ethnic groups are, 
respectively, the Malinkés and the Djallonkés and Peuls. The settlement of the villages and hamlets was done 
through the movement of populations looking for fertile lands. 

Human settlements are very dispersed, certainly due to the logic of being close to fertile lands. 
Accommodations are mainly huts built in adobe, bamboo and straw. 

Agriculture is the main socio-economic activity, followed by small-scale mining, husbandry – which has clearly 
declined as a result of cattle theft and recurrent animal diseases – and fishing, which is done scarcely on the 
Falémé River or the Koila Kobé. Agriculture is of the subsistence type, and it barely provides self-sufficiency due 
to constraints related to its rudimentary nature, the lack of inputs and its abandonment in favour of small-scale 
mining, which unfortunately does not guarantee gains to compensate agricultural shortfalls.  

In terms of health, the predominant diseases are malaria, pulmonary diseases, infectious diarrhea, and 
malnutrition and they appear on a seasonal basis. The main health facility is the Madina Baffé health centre, 
which faces certain challenges during the rainy season due to its remote location. In addition, there are

challenges related to the mobility of communities, whose access to the facility is particularly hindered during 
the rainy season. 

In terms of education, the multitude of temporary shelters and/or multigrade classes, the insufficient 
equipment, the lack of support infrastructures, such as toilets and waterworks, and the difficulty of accessing 
school supplies due to poverty are all obstacles to schooling in the zone.  

Regarding access to potable water, some villages have boreholes (Noumoufoukha, Guémédji, Madina Bafé, 
Saroudia, Nafadji and Boféto), but traditional wells, marshes and rivers are the most frequently used sources of 
water. 

It must be noted that the zone, due to its geographical position (borders with Guinea and Mali) and the 
existence of small-scale mining sites, which are points of convergence for foreigners from the region or the 
bordering countries, is faced with serious, constantly growing insecurity. 

The Project is located near Guémédji village and its Kouloumindé hamlet. Guémédji village is one of the largest 
official villages of the rural community of Madina Baffé. Established approximately two centuries ago, it has the 
distinction of being the most easterly village of its administrative district. Guémédji has five hamlets: 
Kouloumindé, Diakha-Guémédji (commonly called Diakha-Sénégal), Fadougou, Fandiandia and 
Botokhoto-Guémédji. Guémédji's population was estimated at 1,700 inhabitants in 2015.  

The Diakha-Sénégal hamlet, located in the zone that is subject to a dispute between Senegal and Guinea-
Conakry, was relocated along the road connecting Boféto and Guémedji, just outside the limited study zone 
defined for this project. It was also renamed Diakha-Guémédji (or, according to certain inhabitants, Diakha-
Macky). 

The Kouloumindé hamlet, created around the 2000s due to the presence of pasturelands and farmland, is one 
of the three main hamlets of Guémédji village. It is located approximately 4 km south-west from the village, on 
a site wedged between the range of hills forming the border between Guinea to the west and south, the 
cuirasse plateau to the east and a small-scale mining site and the forest to the north. According to the hamlet's 
chief, the population was evaluated at 272 inhabitants in 2014 and currently includes 30 households.

Small-Scale Mining 

Small-scale mining, an income-generating activity, is ubiquitous on the Boto permit zone. A specific study on the 
small-scale mining situation was completed as part of the ESIA. The main sites currently used by small-scale 
miners are the deposit Boto 5 and Fadougou. Intense activities of processing the ore mined the small-scale 
miners take place along the Balinko River, in Guémédji village. A draft small-scale miner engagement plan was 
developed as part of the ESIA. For safety reasons, small-scale mining activities currently in progress at Boto 5 
will have to stop.  

Archaeology and Cultural Heritage 

The permit zone fits perfectly in the culture of eastern Senegal, where one of the most ancient stone industries 
in Senegal was developed. 

Essentially, the populations of the villages in the Koudékourou sector come from Guinea, except for the 
inhabitants of Boféto, which are purportedly from Bétékhill, a Malian village, and the inhabitants of Samécouta. 
Most villages maintain that their founder left his country or land of origin to escape conflicts (Madina Baffé, 
Noumoufoukha), retaliation that could result from loss of power, or taxation (Saroudia). However, other villages 
state that their founder came to their current land in search of more fertile lands (Boféto, Babouya). 

Sacred sites including cemeteries, sacred trees, rock shelters and rocks were listed. Most villages have mosques, 
but aside from Saroudia, a marabout village that seems well resourced, the mosques of the other villages are 
built in bamboo. 

Archaeological sites and isolated finds in the zone show a highly variable material culture and includes lithic 
industries and pottery industries, predominant in the assemblages. Grinding stones collected on several sites 
suggest activities related to processing grains, leaves, etc., for food or medical purposes.

A literature review of the archaeological potential was conducted as part of the ESIA in progress. In consultation 
with the relevant authorities, it will be decided whether excavations are necessary on the site before the start 
of operations. 

20.3 Waste and Tailings Geochemistry 

Tailings 

The geochemical characterization of 43 tailings samples from the treatment of samples representative of the 
ore was completed in 2016. The main components of the tailings are iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium and 
potassium. Tailings have low levels of heavy metals (nickel, copper, chrome, zinc and cobalt).  

According to Price's classification (2009) used in Canada to determine acid generating potential (AGP), the 
materials that show an acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) twice as significant as the acidifying potential (AP) 
(ANC/AP > 2) are not likely to generate acid mine water. As a whole, samples presented an average AP of 
26.1 kg CaCO3/t and an average ANC of 128 kg CaCO3/t, for an average ANC/AP ratio of 4.9. Tailings sent to the 
tailings storage facility are not likely to generate acid water.  

Leaching kinetic tests conducted over a period of 20 weeks on 3 tailings samples corroborated the absence of a 
mine drainage potential. Indeed, leachates collected were still alkaline (pH > 7.0), and sulphate concentrations 
(indicator of the extent of sulphide oxidation) at the end of the tests were low (< 50 mg/l). Regarding heavy 
metals, nickel and copper concentrations remained low after the initial leaching period. 

Waste 

Geochemical characterizations were carried out from 2015 to 2017 on 44 samples from the Malikoundi deposit 
and 27 samples from the Boto 5 deposit. Four composite samples were also formed from a selection of 
individual samples to complete the leaching kinetic tests. These four samples were also characterized. However, 
the Project currently only involves mining saprolite and a portion of the Boto-5 deposit's transition zone. Only 
14 waste samples from the Boto 5 deposit come from mined weathering profiles.  

Compared with the Boto 5 deposit, the Malikoundi deposit is characterized by high aluminium, iron, calcium 
and magnesium contents. The Boto 5 deposit, which has been more weathered, shows higher arsenic, cobalt 
and copper contents. In fact, the Boto 5 deposit's calcium and magnesium content suggest that the carbonates 
were consumed over time.  

As a whole, the Malikoundi project's waste does not present an acid generating potential. Both composite 
samples used for the leaching kinetic tests also showed an absence of metal leaching potential.  

None of Boto 5's eleven individual samples from non-consolidated horizons (saprolite and transition) and 
collected at less than 30 m showed an acid generating potential. Three non-consolidated material samples 
collected between 30 m and 40 m from the surface showed an acid generating potential. However, the average 
sulphide content of these three samples is 1.36%, which is not very high compared with many other acid 
generating mine materials. But these three samples were from the same drill core. Therefore, one can suspect

that these samples are representative of a very limited portion of the total non-consolidated materials of the 
deposit and that they constitute a nugget effect. In fact, samples collected closer to the surface (19 m -20 m) 
and deeper (50 m  51 m) in the same drill core showed very low sulphide contents (<0.01% and 0.03%, 
respectively), which tends to confirm the very localized and limited presence of sulphide materials.  

In this context for the Boto 5 deposit, an in-depth study of mineralogical analyzes completed on all drill cores 
will be carried out.  

If an acid mine drainage issue were to be identified, mitigation measures would be implemented to manage 
potentially acid generating waste, in accordance with the best environmental practices recognized in the mining 
industry.  

It must be noted that additional static and kinetic tests are currently in progress, and the results will be used to 
better document the Boto 5 deposit's surface horizon geochemical behaviour. 

20.4 Potential Impacts of the Project and Mitigation Measures 

The ESIA resulted in the identification of the main potential impacts as well as the benefits the Project could 
have on the environment and the social environment. The main potential negative impacts are the following: 

• Reduced area for lands that could be used by the community for the purposes of agriculture, 
husbandry, market gardens and other uses, due to land occupation by infrastructures and various 
components of the Project. 

• Loss of cropland to build certain infrastructures and to establish a safety radius around components 
that present a risk to the population. 

• Disruption of plant and wildlife habitats by construction activities and mining operations. 

• Modification of the sector's hydrological and hydrogeological regime due to land occupation by 
infrastructures and components of the Project, the development of ditches and drainage channels, 
the development of water storage ponds, the excavation and dewatering of open pits, etc. 

• Increased ambient noise level due to blasting and ore and waste handling activities, as well as the 
equipment used in the industrial sector. 

• Disruption of ambient air quality due to handling of material, ore and waste, operation of the thermal 
power plant and of the ore processing mill, etc. 

• Disruption of surface and ground water quality as a result of deforestation exposing the land to 
erosion, the potential discharge of contaminated water by the septic waste water treatment plant, 
waste dumps and tailings storage facility, potential discharges of hazardous material or petroleum 
products, etc.

• Increased pressure on already limited services related to health, education, and water and food 
supply, potential increase in crime rate and cases of communicable diseases, caused by the influx of 
migrants, namely crossing the borders from Mali and Guinea, seeking job and economic 
opportunities in the sector.  

On the other hand, the Project will bring several benefits for the Senegalese State and the communities in the 
Kédougou and Saraya regions. Indeed, the mine operations will result in significant revenues for the Senegalese 
Treasury, create hundreds of direct and indirect jobs, provide business opportunities for Senegalese service 
providers and suppliers, and offer possibilities of professional development and training to local populations. In 
addition, the Project will contribute to the development of local communities through its development support 
program, whose outlines are presented below. 

20.4.1 Mitigation Measures 

IAMGOLD's Zero Harm vision guides all of the company's operations and activities. It is the company's 
commitment to continually strive to reach the highest standards in health and safety, minimize impact on the 
environment, and work co-operatively with host communities.  

The Zero Harm vision is not only a corporate commitment, it is also the vision that guides the development of 
the Project and the design of its various components. Thus, the Project was developed in order to:  

• Promote a beneficial, harmonious and respectful coexistence between local communities and mining 
operations. 

• Comply with national and international regulations in terms of environment, occupational health and 
safety and corporate social responsibility (CSR). 

• Protect the communities' health and safety. 

• Effectively mitigate impacts, nuisances and inconveniences caused by the activities on local 
communities and the environment. 

• Minimize encroachment of project components on lands used by the communities and on protected 
or important habitats. 

The Project was designed to minimize impacts on the population and the environment. First, the 500 m safety 
distance prescribed by Senegal's Environmental Code will be complied with for all project components. Indeed, 
the Project's various infrastructures and components were positioned so that they are at more than 500 m from 
permanent watercourses and population centres. These include waste dumps, TMF, explosive magazines, the 
process plant, the FWP, etc. The only exception is the Boto 5 pit, which is located at less than 500 m from some 
of the Kouloumindé hamlet residences.  

For safety and security reasons, it was proposed to plan significant buffer zones around the main infrastructures 
that could present a risk for the community as well as their cattle. As part of the ESIA, it was proposed to the 
Senegalese authorities that a 500 m wide buffer zone be implemented around the tailings storage facilities, the

explosives storage area, the ore processing mill, the open pits and the waste dumps. Additionally, a linear 50 m 
wide buffer zone was proposed around the ore hauling road connecting the Boto 5 pit to the processing plant. 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of community members who cross this road at the two points 
where it crosses paths currently used by the inhabitants. Figure 20.12 shows the location of infrastructure 
planned in the original feasibility study and the 500 m safety radii around them. 

Various common mitigation measures were integrated to the Project during its design. The storage and 
handling areas for petroleum products and reagents will have a secondary spill retention capacity, run-off water 
from waste dumps and drainage water from pits will be collected and directed to settling ponds to reduce its 
concentration of suspended solids and septic waste water will be treated by a proven technology before it is 
released in the environment.  

In addition, the TMF's foundation will be designed and developed to minimize the risk of exfiltration. A 
watertight geomembrane will be installed at the bottom of the TMF to protect the quality of ground water. The 
TMF will also be designed and operated so as to prevent process waste from being released into the 
environment, except in the event of extreme weather events. In such a situation, the emergency spillway 
developed for that purpose would become functional to reduce risks of damage and breach in the facility's dam.  

Many other mitigation measures will be implemented. They are presented in detail in the ESIA report. 

Kouloumindé Hamlet 

Since a part of the Kouloumindé hamlet is located at less than 500 m from the Boto 5 pit, there will be no 
blasting operations in the Boto 5 pit.   

A model of the noise level of ground vibration and excess air pressure resulting from blasts was completed. The 
noise at the Kouloumindé hamlet will reach levels of 35 to 42 dBA during the day. These levels comply with the 
55 dBA limit for daytime. Operations at the northern portion of the Boto 5 pit during the night will produce 
maximum noise levels of 30 to 39 dBA in the Kouloumindé village. These levels comply with Senegal's 40 dBA 
limit for night time as well as with the IFC/World Bank's guidelines (45 dB for night time). 

20.4.2 Relocation and Compensation Strategy 

While the Project had been designed to minimize encroachment of infrastructures and components on 
inhabited sectors and fields, its completion will inevitably lead to impacts in that regard.  

Additionally, lands currently used for agriculture, husbandry or market gardens and lands that have a good 
agronomic potential will be impacted by the Project. This is namely the case for the sectors of the pit, of the 
Malikoundi waste dump and of the ore processing mill.  

In compliance with Senegalese regulatory requirements and World Bank guidelines, measures will need to be 
taken to mitigation the effects of these involuntary relocations. Thus, a relocation and compensation strategy 
was developed for the Project by the specialized firm RePlan, which supported several developers with 
relocation and compensation programs in Senegal.

Should the displacement of revenue-generating activities or of people to other revenue-generating activities be 
required to complete the Project, AGEM will implement a relocation and compensation program in compliance 
with the requirements of Senegalese regulations and international standards. For the development and 
implementation of the provisional relocation and compensation program, a four-phase process will be 
implemented: 

• Phase 1: The provisional program published as part of the current ESIA will be the main output of this 
phase. 

• Phase 2: Comprehensive investigation to document the impacts of relocations and to identify all 
affected persons. 

• Phase 3: Implementation and individual negotiations. 

• Phase 4: Monitoring and support, including implementation of the agreed upon livelihood restoration 
program, the vulnerable person assistance program, and the monitoring-assessment program. 

The activities necessary to achieve a comprehensive and operational relocation and compensation program are 
as follows: 

• Development of a stakeholder engagement strategy specific to relocations and compensation, 
including the creation of a forum for discussions about issues related to land acquisition, relocation, 
and livelihood restoration. 

• Development of a compensation framework, including defining a policy and eligibility criteria, rules, 
and specific compensation types. 

• Selection of relocation sites and action planning to facilitate the relocation. 

• Development of a livelihood restoration program. 

• Development of a support plan for vulnerable people and groups. 

• Implementation of a grievance management system. 

20.4.3 Local Community Development Support Program 

The Boto sector is characterized by deep poverty, remoteness and isolation during the rainy seasons, and 
lacking public utilities. The public inquiry conducted in May-June 2016 at the request of the Governor of 
Kédougou revealed that the local populations are pinning their hopes on the Project, hoping that the project's 
arrival will promote the development of local communities. 

The completion of the Project could represent a structuring project that will allow the State to sustainably 
improve the inhabitants' living conditions. Therefore, if the Project is implemented, AGEM intends to provide 
effective support to the authorities and communities to improve living conditions in the zone and help the

development of local communities. This support will remain within the financial limits of the company and in 
accordance with the mandates of the State.  

The guiding principles of the local community development support program are as follows:  

• Act in partnership with the State, public agencies and specialize non-governmental organizations 
(NGO's). 

• Invest in the sustainable development of local communities. 

• Act in partnership with local communities. 

• Give preference to one-time investment in projects already identified in priority action plans and 
other development plans from the authorities. 

• Establish an agreement for each investment. 

The priorities that the company intends to support as part of the program are as follows: 

• Population health. 

• Water supply. 

• Food security. 

• Education and training. 

• Population safety. 

• Income-generating activities and local economy. 

• Energy. 

• Collective sanitation of villages and districts. 

• Leisure and population retention. 

• Income-generating activities. 

AGEM will focus as a priority on sectors located near mining operations and indirect activities related to the 
construction and operation of a mine. To this end, five action zones will be established (map 3.2). These zones 
are:

Direct impact zone: 

• Zone 1 – Médina Baffé, Doumakhia, Touréboung, Babouya, Khérémakhono, Kiribou, Boféto, 
Bétékhali, Guémedji, Fadougou, Koulimindé, Noumoufoukha, Boto-Boféto, Boto-Guémedji, Diakha-
Guémedji, Khouréforé, Guémedji, Niengueya, Fandiandian Sonkhoya. 

Indirect impact zones: 

• Zone 2 – Rest of the Madina Baffé commune (outside zone 1) and Nafadji village. 

• Zone 3 – Saraya Department: nearby villages on the Saraya road and Saraya town (due to the 
expected presence of the majority of workers and their family). 

• Zone 4 – Rest of the Kédougou region. 

• Zone 5 – Rest of the Senegalese territory. 

AGEM's support of community development will be provided as a priority to zones 1, 2 and 3, but without 
neglecting zones 4 and 5. 

20.5 Environmental and Social Management Program (ESMP) 

To effectively reduce environmental and social impacts and adequately monitor activities, Senegal's 
Environmental Code requires that an Environmental and Social Management Program (ESMP) be developed, 
implemented and maintained for large-scale projects such as the Project.  

An ESMP addresses the main environmental and social issues identified in the ESIA. It must include mitigation 
measures that will be implemented, monitoring and surveillance measures, key performance indicators, 
relevant records and emergency measures to be implemented if needed. It also includes a relocation and 
compensation plan (if required) as well as a local community development support program. The ESMP applies 
to all project phases: construction, operation and closure. 

A preliminary ESMP was presented to the authorities in the ESIA report. Once the environmental permit is 
obtained for the Project, an official version of the ESMP will be prepared and implemented.  

20.6 Reclamation, Restoration and Closure Plan 

As required by Senegalese authorities, volume II of the ESIA report details the reclamation, restoration and 
closure activities planned for the Project. The main activities planned are the following:  

• At the end of operations, all infrastructures and service buildings will be dismantled, unless the State 
formally acquires them, without any civil liability for AGEM. 

• Concrete foundations will be crushed and integrated into the soil in place. Lands will return to a state 
similar to their original state.

• Soil characterization will be carried out at locations that may have been contaminated (e.g. fuel 
storage zone). Contaminated soil management will be done in compliance with authorities' 
requirements and/or good practices. Waste dumps, TMF and FWP will be revegetalized using, among 
other things, the accumulated topsoil. The use of endemic plant species that cattle do not feed on 
will be favoured. It should be noted that the reclamation strategy will be progressive for waste 
dumps. 

• As soon as water quality is established, a breach will be made in the process water pond of the TMF 
to allow the free flow of water. A breach will also be made in the FWP to allow the free flow of water. 

• The open pits' access ramps will be dismantled. Berms will be made at the edge of the pits to prevent 
animals and people from accidentally entering. 

• Site monitoring will continue for five years after the end of production. The quality of water, air and 
soils will be monitored to confirm that all parameters studies return to their pre-mining levels. The 
success of revegetation will be monitored to make sure the new vegetation is self-sufficient.  

A cost estimate for reclamation, restoration, and closure is provided in Section 21. This amount does not include 
the costs to carry out social and community projects. The amount to be invested for that will be determined in 
the mining agreement that will be signed between AGEM and the Senegal. Wherever practicable, progressive 
restoration activities for the TMF and the waste dump slopes to reduce the cost of reclamation and restoration 
activities to be carried out upon closure of the mine. 

20.7 Permit 

The expiry date of the existing exploration permit is March 4, 2019. Normally, a request for a mining permit or a 
mining concession permit must be filed at least four months before the expiry date of the exploration permit. 
The request must be supported by, among other things, a FS, an ESIA, a development and start-up plan and an 
investment plan.

The open pit mining equipment capital costs are based on conventional medium scale open pit equipment, 
common for West Africa and contractor quotes with regional experience 

Production drilling is completed with down the hole (DTH) hammer rigs drilling either a 154 mm bit or a 104 mm 
bit.  The drill rigs will do both production drilling and pre-shear drilling as required.  The loading fleet is 
comprised of 15 m3 hydraulic excavators as the primary loading unit together with 13 m3 front end loaders (FEL) 
and 6.7 m3 hydraulic excavators.  The truck fleet is rigid frame trucks with 95 t capacity.  The trucks will be 
outfitted with lightweight boxes to increase their payload.  Support equipment includes track dozers, graders, 
water trucks, support backhoes, stockpile loaders, pumps and additional equipment. 

Boto 5 is planned as a contract mining pit which starts in Year 1.  The contractor will be using 40 t trucks and the 
associated support equipment.  No capital is required for the Boto 5 pit other than road construction from the 
plant to the pit which has been included in the Pre-production stripping. 

The mining capital detail by period is shown in Table 21.6.

Equipment pricing was received from the local vendors and Caterpillar, Komatsu, Sandvik and Atlas Copco. 

The distribution of the capital costs was completed using the units required within a given period.  This may be 
new units or replacement units as needed for sustaining capital. 

The number of units are determined by the annual operating hours required.  These were balanced over the 
periods of time so that if there are fluctuations in the hours from period to period, or year to year, these are 
distributed over the entire equipment fleet to balance the hours. 

Replacement times for the equipment are average values from AGP experience and from vendor estimates of 
reasonable replacement hours.  Options around rebuilds and recertification of equipment like track dozers are 
not considered nor is used equipment.     

The balancing of equipment units was based on operating hours is completed for each major piece of mine 
equipment.  The smaller equipment was based on number of units required based on operational experience.   

The most significant quantity of major mine equipment are the haulage trucks.  At the peak of mining 20 units 
are necessary to maintain mine production.  This happens from Year 6 onwards and is a result of the stripping 
requirements of Malikoundi Phase 3.  The maximum hours per truck per year are set at 6,000.

The other major mine equipment is determined in the same manner.  In some instances, the loaders have a 
longer period life (same number of hours between replacements) because of this sharing of hours with the 
other units in the fleet. 

The support equipment is usually replaced on a number of year's basis.  Pickup trucks are leased on a monthly 
basis and form part of the operating cost but not the capital.  

Major equipment purchase timing is indicated in Table 21.7.

The engineering office equipment includes items such as mining software purchase for geology and 
engineering, survey equipment with associated peripherals including survey drones.  This cost is estimated at 
$200,000 with the majority of the cost being the mining software. 

The mine dispatch system will assist in the routing and tracking of material movement during operation. 

The dewatering system is a set of pumps in the pit with piping to bring water to the surface ditches which will 
flow by gravity to the FWP.  Two pumps will be purchased initially with 1 km of piping to start the system.  
Average pumping requirements assumed are expected to be 1,700 m3/d initially with an initial maximum 
pumping rate of 3,400 m3/day during storm events or in the rainy season.  As the mine expands in size laterally 
and depth, the pumping rate will increase and that is considered under sustaining capital for the purchase of 
additional pumps and piping. 

Boto 5 has a different terrain with more vegetation and poorer foundation conditions than the Malikoundi area.  
One dump facility will be developed for Boto 5, which requires additional preparation of the foundation due to 
removing more vegetation and topsoil prior to waste placement.  Appropriate cost allowances have been made 
for the Boto 5 waste dump foundation preparation. 

The geotechnical instrumentation includes vibrating wire piezometers and other slope monitoring 
instrumentation as recommended by the geotechnical consultant, Absolute Geotechnics. 

Pre-Production Stripping 

The mine is scheduled to initiate mining in Year -2.  Year -2 is only three months long and Year -1 is 12 months 
long for a total of 15 months preproduction stripping. The material moved will be used to develop the mine 
roads, TMF construction, FWP, initial waste management facility development and provide ore for the stockpile.  
A total of 13.8 Mt of waste will be mined and 2.2 Mt of ore stockpiled.   

Waste material will be hauled longer to the TMF areas for construction of the facility prior to plant 
commissioning.  Ore will be stockpiled at the plant for commissioning and surge capacity.   

This is expected to cost $35.0 M or $2.19/t material moved.  This includes all costs associated with IAMGOLD 
management, dewatering, drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, support, engineering and geology department 
labour and ore control. 

These construction activities are typically less productive hauls due to narrower working conditions and longer 
hauls than normally scheduled for the waste material.  The TMF construction means the trucks will have to turn 
around on narrow road widths requiring back and forth movement to negotiate the turns.  This plus extended 
reversing of the loaded trucks to the dumping point results in longer truck cycle times.  This has been factored 
into the haulage times.

Contingency 

Significant effort has been undertaken to determine the mine capital costs, and in particular the mine 
equipment.  With the level of confidence from these negotiations, no contingency is applied to the mine capital 
costs. 

21.3 Plant and Infrastructure Capital Costs 

The capital costs for the process plant and infrastructure capital are based on the facilities described in Chapters 
17 and 18 and prepared by Lycopodium with input from KP on the TMF, FWP and Site Water Management Plan. 

The purpose of the capital cost estimate is to provide substantiated costs which can be utilized to assess the 
preliminary economics of the Project. The capital cost estimate is based on an EPCM implementation approach 
and horizontal (discipline based) construction contract packaging.  

The various elements of the Project estimate have been subject to internal peer review by Lycopodium and 
have been reviewed for scope and accuracy. 

A summary of the estimate methodology is provided in Table 21.8 and estimate methodology is provided in 
Table 21.9.

21.3.1 General Estimating Methodology 

The process plant was broken down into unit operation areas with quantity take-offs benchmarked against 
similar facilities from previous projects to provide the additional scope and level of confidence needed to 
confirm a FS level estimate was achieved.  

Overall plant layout and equipment sizing was prepared with sufficient detail to permit an assessment of the 
engineering quantities for the majority of the facilities for earthworks, concrete, steelwork, and mechanical 
items.  The layouts enabled preliminary estimates of quantities to be taken for all areas and for interconnecting 
items such as piperacks. 

Unit rates for labour and materials were derived from responses to BQRs sent to fabricators and contractors 
experienced in the scale and type of work in the region.  

Budget pricing for equipment was obtained from reputable suppliers with the exception of low value items 
which were costed from Lycopodium's database of recent project costs. 

For the offices, workshops and similar items appropriate budget pricing was obtained from reputable suppliers 
of similar prefabricated designs with erection/installation costs derived from solicited contractor rates.

Plant Equipment 

This component represents prefabricated, pre-assembled, off-the-shelf types of mechanical or electrical 
equipment, either fixed or mobile.  Pricing is inclusive of all costs necessary to purchase the goods ex-works, 
generally excluding delivery to site (unless otherwise stated) but including operating and maintenance manuals.  
Vendor representation and commissioning spares have been allowed for separately in the estimate.  

Bulk Materials 

This component covers all other materials, normally purchased in bulk form, for installation on the Project.  
Costs include the purchase price ex-works, any off-site fabrication, transport to site (unless otherwise stated), 
and over-supply for anticipated wastage.  

Installation 

This component represents the cost to install the plant equipment and bulk materials on site or to perform site 
activities. Installation costs are further divided between direct labour, equipment and contractors' distributable. 

The labour component reflects the cost of the direct workforce required to construct the Project scope.  The 
labour cost is the product of the estimated work hours spent on site multiplied by the cost of labour to the 
contractor inclusive of overtime premiums, statutory overheads, payroll burden and contractor margin.

The equipment component reflects the cost of the construction equipment and running costs required to 
construct the Project.  The equipment cost also includes cranes, vehicles, small tools, consumables, PPE and the 
applicable contractor's margin. 

Contractors' in-direct costs encompass the remaining cost of installation and include items such as offsite 
management, onsite staff and supervision above trade level, crane drivers, mobilization and demobilization, 
R&Rs, meals and accommodation costs, and the applicable contractors' margin. 

21.3.4 Temporary Construction Facilities 

Facilities will be capable of servicing the Owner's and EPCM teams.  

Included in the estimate for construction facilities are the following: 

• Construction offices.   

• Computers and computing servers, telephones, printers, etc. and office furniture. 

• Provision of services. 

21.3.5 Heavy Lift Cranage 

A heavy lift crane of 250 t capacity has been allowed for in the estimate for the duration of the installation of 
the mill. 

21.3.6 Contractor Distributable 

Mobilization/Demobilization 

Costs for mobilization/demobilization of labour and equipment to/from the Project site were, where practical, 
adopted from budget quotation enquiries to contractors or adjusted from current tenders/contracts to reflect 
the Project location. 

21.3.7 Earthworks 

Quantities for plant site bulk earthworks have been estimated from the layout. Quantities for the TMF, FWP and 
surface water management facilities were provided by KP. 

Rates were derived from quotations for the wet hire of the earthworks fleet built-up with allowances for 
miscellaneous additional labour and equipment and supervision.  It is considered that the rates used are 
appropriate to complete the work as an addition to the mining contract, as a 'self-perform' activity by the 
Company using hired equipment or as a contract let to a local 'second tier' contractor.

As place and compact earthworks activities to construct the TMF embankment will continue virtually 
uninterrupted for the life of mine it is considered likely that the earthworks will be undertaken by the mining 
contractor. 

Quantities for the ROM pad (at the process plant) are limited to the engineered fill and drainage and site 
earthworks required around the ROM pad retaining wall.  The cost of the balance of the ROM pad is included in 
the mining estimate using material that would otherwise go to the waste dumps. 

21.3.8 Concrete 

Quantities for concrete works were established using the following: 

• Material take-offs from layouts prepared for the FS. 

• Benchmarking against detailed drawings for similar sized projects completed by Lycopodium. 

Rates for this estimate were based on responses to BQRs from regional subcontractors with experience on this 
kind of work and capacity to perform the works.  

Rates and quantities were prepared on a composite per cubic metre basis.  Mobilization, demobilization and 
indirect costs were separated to reflect contract methodology. 

21.3.9 Steelwork 

Quantities for structural steel were established using: 

• The layout and equipment elevation drawings/sketches prepared for the FS. 

• Benchmarking against detailed drawings for similar sized projects completed by Lycopodium. 

Rates for this estimate were based on responses to BQRs from fabricators with experience on global supply.   

Site installation hours were applied from responses to BQRs from regional subcontractors with experience on 
this kind of work and capacity to perform the works.  

21.3.10 Platework/Tankage 

Platework and tankage quantities were determined using the sizing provided in the mechanical equipment list 
prepared for the FS as the basis.  A preliminary design was undertaken for each tank to select appropriate plate 
thicknesses to develop tank tonnages.  Lining materials, where applicable, were quantified separately. 

Rates for this estimate were based on responses to BQRs from fabricators with experience on global supply.   

Site installation hours were applied from responses to BQRs from regional subcontractors with experience on 
this kind of work and capacity to perform the works.

21.3.11 Mechanical Equipment 

The mechanical equipment list prepared for the FS provided the quantities and sizing for the cost estimate. 

Budget pricing was obtained from reputable suppliers for the majority of mechanical equipment, based on 
equipment data sheets prepared for the FS. 

Equipment installation hours were estimated based on responses to BQRs solicited from contractors and 
installation hours estimated by Lycopodium.  For each individual item of equipment due allowances were made 
for retrieval from the storage location, handling, placing, installing and commissioning the equipment. 

21.3.12 Plant Pipework 

The supply and installation estimate for in-plant piping was derived using factors derived from previously built 
projects.  These factors are a percentage of the mechanical equipment supply and are calculated per individual 
plant area.  The plant piping costs allow for the supply and installation of pipe, fittings, mountings and manual 
valves. 

21.3.13 Overland Pipework 

The overland piping, i.e. raw water supply, tailings discharge line and decant water return line were quantified 
based on material take-offs.   

Supply Rates and Installation Cost for this estimate were based on responses to BQRs from regional 
subcontractors with experience on this kind of work and capacity to perform the works. 

21.3.14 Electrical and Instrumentation 

The supply of electrical equipment was estimated in detail and compiled using electrical equipment lists, loads 
lists, GA drawings and supplier pricing. The Plant Control System was quoted by reputable suppliers and the 
major instruments and valves were estimated using first principles engineering.  

The supply and installation estimate for electrical and instrumentation bulks was estimated using factors 
derived from previously built projects. 

21.3.15 Erection and Installation 

Included in the discipline by discipline assessment of erection/installation costs detailed above, allowances 
were made for major construction cranage and equipment and construction costs such as site establishment, 
construction personnel meals, accommodation, transportation from/to site, flights and fuel usage, etc.

• Site supply of power and raw water (for operations and construction), sewage removal and 
treatment, communications network for construction facilities are included in the infrastructure 
costs. 

21.3.21 Owner's Costs 

The following items are included in the Owner's costs: 

• Owner's project management team (labour and expenses). 

• Owner's Consultants. 

• Health Safety Environment and Community. 

• Site IT and Communication. 

• Mobile Equipment. 

• Owner's travel expenses. 

• Operation Readiness. 

• Commissioning and Ramp-up. 

• Corporate Administration. 

• Condemnation Drilling. 

21.3.22 Spares 

Spares have been estimated based on the Critical Spares List. Estimate pricing has been derived from a 
combination of quoted rates and factors of equipment supply and benchmarked against the spares expenditure 
on projects of a comparable scale.   

The approach assumed is that a minimal quantity of spares will be purchased at the outset of operations with 
spares stocks progressively expanded during operations. 

21.3.23 First Fill and Opening Stocks of Consumables 

Quantities for opening stocks and first fill consumables have been assembled from basic principles and using the 
Project design criteria.  Unit rates are based on budget quotations solicited from suitable suppliers. 

21.3.24  Contingency 

The purpose of contingency is to make specific provision for uncertain elements of cost within the Project 
scope.  Contingencies do not include allowances for scope changes, escalation or exchange rate fluctuations.

Contingency is an integral part of an estimate and has been applied (after careful analysis) to all parts of the 
estimate on a line by line basis, i.e. direct costs, indirect costs, services costs, etc. 

21.4 Operating Costs 

21.4.1 Introduction 

The project operating cost estimate is built-up from three components: 

• The mine operating costs developed by AGP. 

• The process plant operating costs developed by Lycopodium. 

• The General and Administration (G&A) operating costs developed by IAMGOLD. 

The estimated life of mine operating cost per tonne of ore processed is summarized in Table 21.12.

G&A $148 $4.22/t 

Total Cash Cost $1,132 $32.27/t 

 

The foreign exchange rates summarized in Table 21.3 were used to develop the operating costs. 

21.4.2 Mining Operating Costs 

Mining costs were estimated based on the hourly costs of the various equipment, equipment utilization rates 
and productivity assumptions.  The mine operating costs by total material and per tonne of ore are illustrated in 
Table 21.13 and Table 21.14.

Mine Operating Costs 

Diesel is estimated based on equipment hourly consumption with a price of 365 CFA/L provided by IAMGOLD.  
There is a separate fuel delivery fee that is carried in the mining General and Mine Engineering cost category.  
This covers the cost of fuel storage and delivery to the equipment reducing the need for the mine to have fuel 
trucks or manpower to deliver the fuel. 

Labour costs for the various job classifications were obtained from IAMGOLD.  These rates were used and 
include the appropriate burden for each category to cover items such as health care, vacation and federal 
holidays.  The mine labour is based on a 12-hour shift schedule with three crews.

The mine labour includes a mixture of expatriate and local labour.  The expatriate workforce is scheduled to 
train the local workforce and then be reduced over time.  The only expats that are expected to remain on site 
over the mine life is that of the Superintendent of Mine Operations. 

Year 6 is the peak in manpower but the staff manpower remains fairly constant through this period. Year 2 
manpower levels are shown in Table 21.15.

Labour costs are based on an owner operated scenario for Malikoundi.  Blasting will be handled by the 
explosives contractor who will also load and shot the holes.  Tire maintenance is handled by a tire contractor 
who is responsible for changing the tires.  Fuel is also under contract and delivered to the equipment in the 
field. 

Drilling labour force is based on one operator per drill per crew while operating. This peaks at 21 drillers in Year 
5 then drops down over time as the drilling hours are diminished.   Maintenance factors are used to determine 
the number of HME Trades, Drill Maintenance Trades and apprentices required.  The number of people

required is a factor based on the number of operators.  The factors for the various mine cost categories are 
summarized in Table 21.17.

The number of excavator, loader, truck and support equipment operators is estimated using the projected 
equipment operating hours.  The maximum number of employees is 3 per unit to match the mine operating 
crew schedule.  This schedule is comprised of 2 each 12-hour shifts per day requiring 3 operating crews.   

Repair and maintenance (R&M) costs for each piece of equipment were provided by vendor.  The costs for the 
R&M are expressed in a $/hr form.  Fuel consumption rates are based on vendor supplied data and estimated 
for the conditions expected at the Boto Gold Project.   R&M and fuel costs are used in the detail costs for the 
mine equipment.   

AGP solicited purchase costs from local vendors for various tire sizes that will be used during the Project.  
Estimates of the tire life are based on AGP experience and information from other mine operators.  The 
operating cost of the tires is expressed in a $/h form.  The life of the haulage truck tires is estimated at 5,000 
hours per tire for the rigid frame trucks with proper rotation from front to back.  On the rigid frame trucks (95 
tonne) each tire costs $13,100 so the cost/h for tires is $15.67/hr for the truck using the six tires in the 
calculation. 

Ground Engaging Tools (GET) costing is estimated from other projects.  This is an area of cost that is expected to 
be fine-tuned with mine operations.   

Drill consumables were estimated as a complete drill string using the parts list and component lives provided by 
the vendor.  The bit life has been estimated at 600 m per bit.  Drill productivity for both ore and waste is 
estimated at 17.5 m/h for the 5 m bench holes and 24.1 m/h for the 10 m bench holes. 

Lubricants, oil and filters are estimated as a percentage of the fuel cost per hour.  The summary of the 
equipment operating costs is shown in Table 21.18.

Drilling in the open pit will be performed using down the hole hammer drills with two different bit sizes 
depending on the bench being drilled.  The pattern size is the same for ore and waste but varies by the bit size.  
The drill pattern specifications are shown in Table 21.19.  There is a slight expansion in the patterns for 
laterite/saprolite and transition but the majority of the material is rock.

The sub-drill was included to allow for caving of the holes in the weaker zones, reducing re-drilling of the holes 
or short holes that would affect bench floor conditions.  Proper floor breakage will improve travel times and 
decrease tire and overall maintenance costs.

Table 21.20 outlines the parameters used for estimating drill productivity.  This is based on studies of these 
parameters at similar operations and vendor supplied information.  Due to the bench heights and the

An emulsion product will be used for blasting to provide water protection.  With the high rainfall it is expected 
that a water-resistant explosive will be required.  The powder factors used in the explosives calculation are

Presplit holes will be drilled along the rock walls as the pit depth deepens.  The burden of those holes will be 2.2 
m with a spacing of 1.2 m.  These will have a charge factor of 0.5 kg/m2 of blast face. 

The blasting cost comes from quotations of the local vendors.  They are responsible for the explosives plant, 
magazines, loading and shooting of the holes.  The price per kg of emulsion provided was $98.07/100 kg.  In 
addition, there is a monthly fee that covers all other cost components of blasting and their support equipment. 

Ore and waste loading costs were estimated using the front-end loaders and excavators as the only loading 
units.  The smaller excavators are primarily for the ore loading to reduce dilution but have been scheduled for 
some waste material movement as required.  The excavators are responsible for the majority of the waste rock 
movement.

Haulage profiles were developed for each pit phase and destination by end of period plans.  These profiles were 
used in Alastri's Haul Infinity to determine haul cycle times for each of these hauls and then used in the cost 
model.  Various limits were applied to the haulage profiles to consider rolling resistance, up or down hauls and 
congested area speeds.  These are shown in Table 21.23.

The distance applied refers to the length of that particular segment of the haulage profile.  In the case of the 
working face, it is the first 50 m near the shovel or loader.  On the waste dump, it is the last 300 m of the dump 
as the truck approaches to dump their load. 

Support equipment hours and costs are allocated using the percentages as shown in Table 21.24.

Integrated Tool Carrier 3 hours/day 

Compactor 8.5 hours/day 

Lighting Plants 12 hours/day 

Pickup Trucks 4 hours/day 

Dump Truck – 20 ton 5 hours/day 

 

These percentages resulted in the need for five track dozers, three graders and one support backhoe.  Dozer 
tasks include clean-up of the excavator faces, construction and maintenance of roads, dumps and blast patterns 
and ripping of competent rock that is too thin to be blasted.  The graders will maintain the ore and waste haul 
routes.  In addition, water trucks have responsibility for patrolling the haul roads and controlling fugitive dust 
for safety and environmental reasons.  The small backhoes will be responsible for cleaning out sedimentation 
ponds and water ditch repairs. 

The transfer loader is full time at the primary crusher tramming material in to maintain full capacity of the 
crusher.  The crushed pile loader is inside the fence and is used to tram material on the crushed pile and load 
onto the belt as required for maintenance or any other issues. 

These hours are applied to the individual operating costs for each piece of equipment.  Many of these units are 
support equipment so no direct labour force is allocated to them due to their function. 

Grade Control 

Reverse circulation drilling and sampling will be employed as the method of ore definition due to the steep 
inclination of the mineralized zone.  The RC program will work in advance of mining using tight inclined drillhole 
spacing to accurately define the ore/waste contacts.  This ore-waste boundary information is then built into the 
short- range models and then marked in the field to guide the loading equipment. This practice is widespread in 
Australia with great success and also in Canada and Africa.

The method involves using a dedicated grade control drill rig and crew in the pit to drill a series of shallow 
inclined holes drilled in a pattern similar to the blast hole pattern.  For this study, that is assumed to be a 
contract drill rig and team with experience in this type of drilling.  The grade control drill will be drilling the 
saprolite where blast holes are not required.  The pattern for drilling will be a 10 m spacing and a 5 m burden 
with samples taken every 1 m in presumed mineralized zones as outlined by both previous ore control drilling 
and the exploration drilling.  The volume of the sample to be assayed and sample intervals will need be 
determined in a grade deportation study in subsequent studies.  An additional 25% will be drilled along the 
contacts to ensure that unknown structures are not missed in the saprolite.  These "waste" samples will be 
drilled with a 20 m spacing and 10 m burden and sampled over 6 m. 

The amount of reverse circulation drilling peaks in Year 2 at 33,200 m then drops off after that averaging 22,300 
m/y from Year 2 until Year 12. No ore control drilling is required after Year 12.  

The reverse circulation drills will operate for 24 h/d to minimize disturbance and be in advance of mine 
operations with the information.  A three-man crew per drill is required; one driller and two drill helpers.  In 
addition, geologists will provide guidance throughout the day and be on call if unknown issues arise. 

The drill penetration rate is estimated at 10m/h with setups, sampling, etc.  Overall, the cost for the RC drill 
program with contract labour is estimated at $63/m.  Sampling and assay costs are estimated from laboratory 
quotes at $14.25/sample.  

The data from the grade control drilling is then interpreted by the geologist and the ore is then remodelled.  The 
production drilling and blasting will then be designed to mine the ore material separately from the waste. 

Dewatering 

Pit dewatering is a significant work function at the Boto Gold Project.  Efficient and cost-effective dewatering 
will be crucial to the success of the Boto Gold Mine project development and slope stability.  Dewatered slopes 
allow a reduction in the strip ratio by permitting steeper inter-ramp angles that are also be inherently safer. 

Initial estimates of the daily pumping requirements were made while waiting for additional testwork.  It is 
estimated that on average in the initial years 3,700 m3/day will need to be pumped from within the pit to the pit 
rim with peak of 8,200 m3/day.  As the mine expands its footprint and goes deeper those numbers rise to 5,100 
m3/day on average with a peak of 11,200 m3/day.  This water will be pumped to the pit rim and discharged to 
the FWP or discharged if the water quality is met. 

Storm events are common and have the potential to impact mining operations.  Pumping rates as high as 
11,200 m3/day of pumping may be required for several weeks to recover from one of these events.  The capital 
cost has considered this in the estimation for the number of pumps required on site to handle such an event.

The dewatering cost estimate is broken into two components: 

• In-pit. 

• Ex-pit. 

In-pit includes the pumps, sumps, pipelines responsible for moving water from the pit to the pit rim and any 
additional items.  Labour for this is already included in the General and Mine Engineering category of the mine 
operating cost.   

Ex-pit gravity will be employed in the surrounding ditches to transport the water from the pits to the various 
discharge points around the mine property.  In some instances, water in this ditch may require transfer to 
another discharge point and that has been allowed for in the cost estimate. 

The in-pit pumps, like the ex-pit pumps are the same size to allow them to be interchanged as required.  All the 
pumps are diesel powered. 

The pumps required changes as the pit deepens with 2 pumps will be required for normal operation in the pit.  
Storm events would require up to 4 pumps for short periods of time.  The operating parameters are shown in 
Table 21.25.

The dewatering operating cost works out to $0.01/t moved over the period of Year 1 to 13. 

21.4.3 Process Plant Operating Costs 

Overview 

The process plant operating costs have been developed based on an ore processing rate of 2.75 Mtpa. The plant 
will normally operate 24 hrs/day for 365 d/y with 75% (6,570 h/y) crushing plant utilization and 92% milling 
plant utilization (nominal 8,059 h/y). 

The operating cost estimates are expressed in United States Dollars in Q2 2018 terms and are deemed to have 
an overall accuracy of ±15%.

Cost Categories 

The operating cost estimate includes the following major categories as defined below: 

1. Operating Consumables.  

2. Plant Maintenance. 

3. Power.  

4. Plant Laboratory. 

5. Labour (Operation and Maintenance). 

A description of each cost category is provided in the following sections. 

Operating Consumables 

The consumables category covers all wear parts, consumable materials, reagents, fuel used to operate the 
process plant. Consumption and cost per tonne rates for consumables and reagents are summarized in Table 
21.26.  The tables are based on the following: 

• Comminution consumables (crusher liners, mill liners and grinding media) were evaluated based on 
comminution testwork performed on various samples representing the lithologies in the Boto ore 
bodies. Crusher liner, SAG mill liner and steel ball consumption rates are based on calculations and 
vendor supplied data. 

• Laboratory testwork results are used to determine the reagent consumption rates for the most costly 
reagents (cyanide, lime, lead nitrate and oxygen). In the absence of testwork data, reagent 
consumption rates are assumed based on first principle calculations, Lycopodium experience and 
generally accepted practice within the industry. 

• Diesel fuel consumption rates for the mobile equipment and plant operations (elution heating, 
carbon regeneration and gold smelting) are based on first principles calculations and Lycopodium 
experience.  

• Fuel costs of CFA 365.176/L for diesel and CFA 328.329/L for HFO delivered to site was provided by 
IAMGOLD. 

• Consumables and reagents pricing were provided by IAMGOLD.   

• Laboratory costs are based on a contract laboratory at site.

Maintenance 

Maintenance material costs were estimated by applying factors to the fixed capital investment in each area of 
the plant.  Note that the fixed capital investment constitutes the installed cost of all equipment excluding civil 
works, foundations and concrete and indirect costs. Crusher and mill wear parts are included in the 
consumables allowance.  The factors applied are based on Lycopodium's database and experience and are 
average costs over the life of the mine. As such, actual spares costs may be lower during the initial years but rise 
later.  An overall factor of 3.7% is applied to the fixed capital investment for the process plant areas.   The 
estimated annual maintenance cost for process plant and mobile equipment is $3.6 M. Note that the mobile 
equipment element includes the cost of leasing light vehicles as well as medium/heavy equipment. The 
maintenance costs are summarized in Table 21.27.

Power 

Electricity is generated on site.  The power unit cost for the first five years of operation of $ 0.181/kWh is based 
on HFO and diesel fuel consumption rates and BOO costs. From year 6 onwards the fee for the photovoltaic 
solar plant decreases resulting in a reduced energy price of $0.172/kWh.  

Electricity consumption estimate is based on the installed power excluding standby equipment.  Electrical load 
factors and utilization factors are applied to the installed power to arrive at the annual average power draw, 
which is then multiplied by total hours operated per annum and the electricity price to obtain the annual cost. 

Power consumptions and costs per plant area are summarized in Table 21.28. The estimated annual power cost 
for the site during the initial years of operation, including infrastructure and the permanent camp, is $ 20.69 M 
or $ 7.52/t of ore.

Annualized Plant Operating Cost 

During the initial years of operation the ROM blend will contain more saprolite and transition material than the 
LOM average for the ore body. These two ore types are significantly softer to grind and are also less abrasive. 
Consequently, it is expected that the grinding energy and grinding media consumption rates will be lower than 
average during the initial payback period. Table 21.30 below summarizes the estimated annual Plant operating 
cost linked to the mine plan.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Introduction 

An economic assessment of the Project was completed using a pre and after-tax cash flow model prepared by 
IAMGOLD. The model was structured using an EXCEL workbook which presents annual cash flows during the 
expected life of mine of the project.  Parameters affecting the project cash flow are: production schedule, 
revenues, royalties, sustaining and initial capital requirements, operational costs, working capital, financing 
costs, mine closure costs and Senegalese fiscal regime.  Previous costs related to the valuation of the project are 
estimated at $70.3 M and are considered in the financial analysis in terms of future tax depreciation.   

The after-tax financial analysis and results are based on a NPV, the IRR, the payback period which is initiated at 
project approval (except for payback which refers to an amount of time after commercial production is 
declared) and the all-in sustaining costs (AISC) which is a gold industry standard in benchmarking costs per 
ounce of gold. 

The costs were evaluated in United States Dollars.  All amounts are in constant 2018 dollars, no provision is 
made for inflation nor increase in gold price.  All cash flows are estimated on the project base solely and are 
excluding debt financing and a discount rate of 6% was used for the calculation of the NPV. 

At the award of the ''permis d'exploitation'', a mining company will be created where the Government of 
Senegal will hold a 10% free carrying interest.  IAMGOLD will hold the other 90% remaining interests.  Hence the 
Senegalese government will receive 10% of all declared divided produced by the Boto mining company.   

Input data was provided from a variety of sources, including the various consultants' contributions to this 
report, pricing obtained from external suppliers and contractors, and exchange rates and project specific 
financial data such as the expected project taxation regime. The assessment was based upon: 

• Capital cost estimates and expenditure schedules prepared by Lycopodium and AGP. 

• Mine schedule and mining operation cost estimates based on owner operated mining operations, as 
developed by AGP for the study. 

• Process operating cost estimates prepared by Lycopodium, with contributions from IAMGOLD. 

• General and administration cost estimates prepared by IAMGOLD. 

• Metallurgical performance characterized by testwork completed for the study, managed by 
Lycopodium. 

• Sustaining capital cost estimates for the mine development provided by AGP and TMF stage 
development provided by KP. 

• Owner's capital cost estimates prepared by IAMGOLD.

• Royalty, tax, discount rates and other model inputs provided by IAMGOLD. 

• Closure costs estimated by IAMGOLD. 

22.2 Assumptions 

Key economical parameters consist of: price of gold, price of hydrocarbons and exchange rate EUR/USD which 
dictate the value of the local currency since it is pegged to EUR (XOF).  The financial model was built according 
to those assumptions and the ones stated below. 

22.2.1 Metal Price 

The price of gold considered for the revenue base is at $1,250/oz.  No price variation was considered for this 
model. 

22.2.2 Fiscal Regime 

The corporative fiscal regime is specified by the Code Minier 2003-36 and in the mining convention between 
AGEM and the Government of the Republic of Senegal, which states the advantages given during the operation 
phase. 

According to the mining convention, during the investment period including production start-up the producing 
company benefit from an exoneration of all import taxes and duties. Those exonerations starts of the delivery 
date of ''permis d'exploitation'' or of the mining concession and are valid for a maximum of four years. 

Finally, a seven years total tax exoneration is applied at year 1 of the project was applied for the purpose of this 
study, which is compliant with the mining convention.  This exoneration applies on all corporate income tax as 
well as VAT on good and services procured locally or outside Senegal. 

In the financial model, the corporate taxes are at 30% and applied on taxable benefits starting year 8 of the 
project based on the seven years tax exoneration.  The corporate taxes for this project stands at $93.4 M and 
$856 k for other taxes. 

22.2.3 Royalties 

Royalties applied are standing at 3% of revenues, which is compliant to the Code Minier 2003-36.  The royalties 
amount to $64.7 M. 

22.2.4 Working Capital 

This amount represents dues and incomes, inventory, storage fees and bullion inventory before payment.  The 
working capital was estimated at $10.0 M which includes necessary inventories for spare parts, other 
inventories as well as initial cash requirements. 

22.3 Financial Results 

The LOM capital cost for the project is estimated at $320.5M, with an initial capital expenditure of $254.4M.  
Table 22.1 presents a summary of the production information on which the financial model is based, while the 
summary of the financial results is presented in Table 22.2.

The host rocks and observed structural setting demonstrated at the Project are also observed at many of the 
economic gold deposits located along the Senegal-Mali shear zone. Well established gold mines are situated 
along this trend such as: Fekola (B2Gold), Loulo and Gounkoto (Randgold) and Sadiola and Yatela (IAMGOLD) 
(Figure 23.1).

The most proximal and significant property to the Project is the operating Fekola gold mine located in 
southwest Mali and is owned and operated by B2Gold. The Fekola gold mine is situated approximately 6 km 
north and along strike with the Malikoundi/Boto 2 deposit.  The most recent mineral resource estimate for the 
Fekola deposit reports, at a 0.6 g/t Au cut-off grade, Indicated Resources of 56.6 Mt at 2.04 g/t Au (inclusive of 
Reserves), and an Inferred Resource of 4.2 Mt at 1.69 g/t Au (B2Gold AIF, 23 March 2018; www.sedar.com; 
most recently viewed on 2 May 2018).  This information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization at the 
Project.  

In Mali, IAMGOLD holds eight exploration permits covering 600 km2 at the triple junction between Mali, Senegal 
and Guinea. A recent discovery has been made on the Fekola-Malikoundi trend, known as Diakha Project with 
reported Inferred mineral resources of 14.8 Mt at 1.81 g/t Au (RPA, 2015). Exploration is still ongoing on the 
project with step out and infill drilling at Diakha as well as some sub-surface sampling through the project area. 

Figure 23.2 IAMGOLD Properties in Mali 

 

In Guinea, IAMGOLD holds an exploration license located south of the Project and north of Diakha in Mali. A 
termite mount sampling has been performed and an outstanding anomaly determined. This anomaly is being RC 
drilled at the moment.

24.1 Project Implementation and Schedule 

The implementation strategy for the Project is based on an engineering, procurement and construction 
management (EPCM) implementation approach and horizontal discipline-based contract packaging.  Horizontal 
packages are for the earthworks, building works, concrete works, field erected tankage, structural, mechanical 
and piping installation, electrical and instrumentation supply and installation.  An experienced engineering firm 
will be engaged to provide engineering and procurement services for the development of the process plant and 
the associated infrastructure, and provide construction management services as part of an integrated team with 
IAMGOLD for the development of the Project.   

The initial strategy for implementation of the Project is to commence early works to enable access to site year-
round and to meet the first gold pour end of 2020. Early works includes upgrading the main access road and 
main bridges, commencing engineering related to long lead items and finalizing contracts for immediate award 
following board approval.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Geology 

The Project is located in the West African Craton (WAC), in the south-eastern part of the Early Proterozoic 
formation of the Kédougou-Kéniéba inlier, which covers the eastern part of Senegal and western Mali.  At Boto, 
the material near the surface consists of a layer of regolith which is varying in thickness and includes lateritic 
plateaus.  Below the regolith, the geology may be divided into three north trending litho-structural domain: 
Western flyschoid domain, central deformation Corridor and eastern Siliciclastic Domain.  One of the important 
features of this group is the north-south oriented lineament, known as the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone (SMSZ), 
located in the eastern part of the inlier. 

The western domain is dominated by a sequence of flyschoid turbidites, black shales (or graphitic pelite), 
carbonate rocks, minor volcanics (mainly basalt with subordinate rhyolite and pyroclastic breccia or 
agglomerate), and dioritic intrusions. The eastern domain is dominated by a detrital assemblage composed of 
greywacke and sandstone (+ quartzite), called Guémédji sandstone. Between the west and east domains is a 
highly deformed north-trending domain (020˚ N) that is well defined in magnetic geophysical data. It is likely 
this highly deformed domain corresponds to a regional scale structural corridor that branches from the SMSZ.  
Lithologically, it is composed of fine schistose sediments that are carbonaceous in places, locally referred to as 
the "Pelite Unit", and fine laminated sediments (+ carbonates) that subtly grade into an impure marble, locally 
called the "Cipolin Unit". 

The known gold deposits at the Project occur on the margins of the central deformation corridor.  The 
Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4, and Boto 6 deposits lie along the eastern boundary (in contact with the Guémédji 
sandstone) and where the Boto 5 deposit lies along the western boundary (in contact with carbonaceous 
turbidites).  The mineralization at Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 4 and Boto 6 is hosted in the upper part of the 
Guémédji sandstone, near a structurally modified contact with the overlying, finer grained, sedimentary 
sequence.  The mineralization occurs in quartz-tourmaline-pyrite alteration and veins and in hematite-calcite-
pyrite alteration and veins.  The mineralization at Boto 5 is mainly hosted within albitite and follows a phase of 
quartz tourmaline veining as well as pyrite and related alteration/bleaching. 

Drilling to date has been primarily focussed on the development of the Malikoundi/Boto 2, Boto 5 and Boto 6 
deposits.  As of March 2018, the database for the Project contained 784 diamond core and reverse circulation 
holes totalling 126427 m.  AGP is satisfied that the drill hole database is adequate to conduct an estimate of 
mineral resources.  AGP completed a site visit to the Boto Project in December 2017 that included an inspection 
of drill core logging, sampling and storage facilities, a review of sampling methods, chain of custody; a review of 
drill hole locations.  AGP completed an independent verification of the drill logging and drill hole database.  AGP 
is of the opinion that the sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures followed by IAMGOLD are to 
industry-standard and the resulting data and database are adequate for use in the estimation of mineral 
resources.  

The majority of drilling to date, on the principal deposits that make up the Project, has been conducted on drill 
sections oriented to the south-southeast, on a nominal drill hole spacing of between 50 m by 50 m, and up to

100 m, on the known mineralized zones.  Most recent drilling in 2017 and 2018 at Malikoundi/Boto 2 has 
targeted the wider spaced drill fences to in-fill these areas to a 50 m by 50 m spacing to confirm continuity 
between the north and south areas of the deposit, to increase mineral resources and to upgrade Inferred 
resources to an Indicated classification.   

The mineral resources were estimated using Geovia GEMS 6.8.1 resource estimation software.  The current 
mineral resource estimates for the Project was carried out using inverse distance cubed interpolation method 
within 3D wireframe models representing interpreted mineralized zones for each of the deposits.  

The Mineral resources are classified as Indicated Resources and Inferred Resources in accordance with the CIM 
(2014) Standards and Definitions of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The classification is based on the 
number of drillholes and distance to nearest sample and are reported within an optimized constraining shell.  
Mineral resources are reported within optimized constraining shells using Hexagon Mining MineSight 3D 
software using a gold price of $1,500/oz.  Cut-off grades vary between 0.37 and 0.51 g/t Au, and densities range 
between 1.70 g/cm3 and 2.76 g/cm3, depending on alteration zone.  The effective date of the mineral resources 
for the Project is 8 May 2018.   

Mineral resources are reported inclusive of mineral reserves. 

Table 25.1 presents the Mineral Resources for the Project.

The optimized constraining shells for Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 6 mineral resources, had a 500 m offset 
applied from the Balinko and Falémé Rivers.  The Boto 5 deposit is located approximately 1 km west of the 
Balinko River and is not affected by the 500 m offset.  However, the Boto 5 deposit is affected by workings from 
artisanal miners that have affected the surface of the deposit.  These workings were taken into consideration 
and excluded from the current mineral resources by creating two wireframes to represent material removed 
from the mineralized zones.  The Boto 4 has adequate drill information to complete resource estimate, 
however, this deposit is currently not classified as having mineral resources due to the proximity of the Balinko 
River, the border between Senegal and Mali, and is situated within a 500 m exclusion zone of the river and 
below the village of Guémédji.  Should the exclusion zone change or be lifted mineral resources the Boto 4 block 
model and mineral resources may be re-evaluated. 

AGP is not aware of any information not already discussed in this report, which would affect their interpretation 
or conclusions regarding the subject property.  AGP is required to inform the public that the quantity and grade 
of reported Inferred resources in this estimation must be regarded as conceptual in nature and are based on 
limited geological evidence and sampling.  The geological evidence is sufficient to imply, but not verify, 
geological grade or quality of continuity.  For these reasons, an Inferred resource has a lower level of confidence 
than an Indicated resource.  It is reasonably expected that most of the Inferred Mineral Resources could be 
upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.  The rounding of values, as required by 
the reporting guidelines, may result in apparent differences between tonnes, grade, and metal content.

It should benoted that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic 
viability. 

25.2 Mining 

Mining studies have been completed using the resource estimates as of May 8, 2018 for both Malikoundi and 
Boto 5 and include the following aspects: 

• Pit optimization utilized the Lerch-Grossman algorithm to determine the ultimate pit limits.  A metal 
price of $1,044 per ounce gold was used to define the ultimate pit for Malikoundi Pit, $960 per ounce 
gold for Malikoundi North and $900 per ounce gold for Boto 5 for the feasibility study. 

• Final pits were designed for Boto 5, Malikoundi and Malikoundi North.  Bench and overall pit slope 
designs were based on recommendations by the geotechnical consultants (Absolute Geotechnics). 

• Mineral reserves have been determined from mineral resources by taking into account geologic, 
mining, processing, legal and environmental considerations and are therefore classified in accordance 
with the 2014 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 

• There are no Proven Mineral Reserves.  Probable Mineral Reserves amount to 35.06 Mt at an average 
grade of 1.71 g/t Au.  Total estimated Mineral Reserves amounts to 35.06 Mt at an average grade of 
1.71 g/t Au.  Inferred Mineral Resources have not been converted to reserves and instead are treated 
as waste for mine planning purposes. 

• The mine schedule moves 204.3 Mt of waste and 35.1 Mt of ore for a strip ratio of 5.83:1. 

• Waste storage areas were designed near Boto 5, Malikoundi and Malikoundi North.  They have been 
designated as WDNE, WDNW, Boto 5 and FWP. 

• Mining at Malikoundi and Malikoundi North will be completed with size appropriate equipment in 
the form of 95 t haulage trucks matched to 15 m3 hydraulic excavators, 13 m3 front-end loaders and 
6.7 m3 hydraulic excavators.  Support for dilution control will be the responsibility of the smaller 
excavators in delineating the ore/waste contacts.  Drilling and blasting will be required of all horizons 
but to a lesser amount in the saprolite/lateritic zones.  Support equipment such as dozers, graders 
and water trucks will assist in the mining operation.  Boto 5 will be mine by contractor using 40 t 
trucks and the appropriate loading and support equipment. 

• Grade control will be provided by a separate fleet of contract reverse circulation drills working in 
advance of the active mine faces in the saprolite, transition and fresh rock horizons. 

• Dewatering activities will be of a large scale to accommodate the annual 2+ m of rainfall.  Water will 
be pumped from the pits to the pit rim then pump horizontally (or by gravity) to various discharge 
points if the water is of suitable quality. 

• Estimates of both mine capital and operating costs are made.  Capital costs consider owner-operated 
mining for the Malikoundi pits and contract mining in Boto 5.  Pre-production stripping will be

completed by IAMGOLD mining equipment.  Replacement and additional equipment purchase costs 
have been included over the life of the Project. 

• The mine operating cost estimate is dominated by equipment operating costs (fuel, tires, labour and 
maintenance). Blasting, mine operations administration, and services have also been included. 

25.3 Processing 

25.3.1 General Conclusions 

The following conclusions can be made from the metallurgical testwork with regards to a leach/CIP process: 

• Fresh rock, saprolite, and saprock at Boto are readily amenable to whole ore cyanidation. 

• The optimum grind size was determined to be P80 75 µm. 

• The ore at Boto is not expected to have preg-robbing properties. 

• A pre-oxygenation step with oxygen sparging during leach, combined with lead nitrate addition is 
critical in achieving the maximum possible recovery. 

• Leach extraction rates are essentially completed by 24 hrs to 36 hrs. 

• Cyanide consumption rates are expected to be low, averaging about 0.13 kg NaCN/t ore. When 
accounting for cyanide residue in CIP tailings, an addition rate of 0.27 kg NaCN/t ore is expected. 

• Lime consumption rates are expected to be moderate, average at 1.64 kg CaO/t ore at the design ore 
blend. When accounting for 85% purity of the supplied lime, and an addition rate of 1.93 kg CaO/t 
ore is expected. 

25.3.2 Grind Selection 

Cyanidation tests were conducted on both gravity tailings and whole ore samples at the finer grind size 
(targeted P80 of 53 µm). The results for the finer grind, ~P80 53 µm, yielded 2% to 3% higher gold extraction than 
the results for grind P80 75 µm.  

A grind size trade-off study was conducted by Lycopodium to assess the benefit of incorporating a regrind 
milling circuit into the plant design.  A simple financial analysis was completed and based on a set of inputs 
which included a base case gold price of $1,200/oz. At this base case gold price, the analysis yielded a negative 
NPV and no payback on the IRR for the addition of a regrind circuit. A sensitivity analysis showed that the NPV 
and IRR becomes positive with a payback at the end of a 10-year mine life if gold price becomes $1,250/oz.   It 
was concluded that a regrind milling circuit is not justifiable at the base case gold price and is not recommended 
for inclusion in the design at this stage.  However, the plant layout should include provision for future 
installation.

25.3.3 Gravity Circuit 

A review of all the previous gravity separation results showed that out of 56 tests (from 2013 to 2018), only 
three yielded a GRG close to 35%, one close to 50%, and one Boto 5 sample over 65%.  The overall GRG average 
is at approximately 20%, which is considered to be on the low end of the GRG range. 

The E-GRG test results conducted in 2018 indicated that the majority of the GRG amount in MC-2 is classified as 
very fine.  Although the GRG number is considered to be moderate at 39.6, recovery with gravity at the full 
scale would be difficult due to this fine nature. 

The whole ore leaching results for MC-1 and MC-2 produced similar results to the leach tests on gravity tailings.   

All the results combined provided no justification for inclusion of a gravity circuit in the flowsheet. 

25.3.4 Pre-treatment and Leach Conditions 

Extensive leach optimization testwork were conducted to determine the ideal pre-treatment and leach 
conditions for the Project.  The results showed that the use of oxygen in pre-treatment and during leaching, 
along with lead nitrate addition will yield at least 1.8% higher gold extraction than if these additions were not 
considered.  The leach kinetics will be more rapid, and the cyanide consumption will also be reduced 
significantly. 

A trade-off study was conducted by Lycopodium to justify the inclusion of the oxygen plant and the lead nitrate 
system.  A simple financial analysis yielded a positive NPV of $15.3M and an IRR of 157%, providing a payback 
period within the first year. 

The leach conditions recommended based on the results of the leach optimization tests include: 

• Pulp pH at 10.5 to 11 to be maintained with the addition of lime. 

• Pre-treatment with oxygen, and leaching with oxygen spargers to maintain a dissolved oxygen level 
of ~15 mg/L or higher. 

• Lead nitrate addition of 200 g/t ore. 

• Pre-treatment time of 4 hours minimum, and leach time of approximately 36 hours. 

• Cyanide concentration of 0.5 g NaCN/L to be maintained in first leach tank.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Geology 

In order to continue the development of the known deposits and determine the potential of other exploration 
targets, the following drill programs and exploration activities are recommended:  

• Continue to collect density measurements from the drilling, both within and outside the mineralized 
zones, and to validate density measurements externally as needed.  A 5% check of the current 
database at an external lab is recommended with an estimated budget of approximately $5,000. 

• Continue drilling on Malikoundi/Boto 2 and Boto 5 both along strike and at depth to upgrade inferred 
resources to an indicated classification.  An additional 10,500 m of RC and diamond core drilling is 
recommended with an estimated budget of approximately: $700,000. 

• Drilling on Malikoundi/Boto 2 to test an area of 200 m x 200 m with a grid spacing of 25 m by 25 m to 
confirm the continuity of grades, geology and mineralized zones.  A diamond core drill program of 
approximately 4,500 m of is recommended with an estimated budget of approximately: $550,000. 

• Continue drilling to the east of the known mineralized zones in order to determine the extents of the 
different alteration zones within the optimized constraining shells.  Since the majority of drill holes 
are drilled from northwest to southeast, there is less geological and geotechnical information to the 
east and southeast of the various deposits.  A combination of RC and diamond core drilling of roughly 
2,500 m is recommended with an estimated budget of approximately: $220,000. 

Pending positive results from these exploration and drill activities, additional recommendations may be made. 

26.2 Geotechnical 

Recommendations for the next stage of engineering for the Project (detailed design) are summarized below: 

Site Investigations 

• Additional site investigations should be completed as part of detailed design to namely confirm the 
foundation conditions below the FWP embankment, select Waste Dumps, and potential construction 
materials. Additional undisturbed samples should be collected for laboratory testing based on the 
encountered conditions to refine the foundation material strength estimates and optimize the 
designs.

TMF 

• Develop a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the TMF to identify and characterize 
potential risks associated with the TMF for the construction, operations and closure phases. The 
FMEA should include a risk evaluation matrix that provides a rating for the likelihood and 
consequence for each of the identified risks for the TMF and identify design mitigation measures to 
reduce the identified risks. 

• Complete a breach analysis for the TMF to estimate the potential flood inundation zones that could 
result if the embankment associated with the facility were to fail. The estimated downstream 
inundation zone will help identify any residences, infrastructure and/or receptors that are at risk 
downstream of the TMF. An EPP should be developed to reduce the risk of human life loss and injury, 
and minimize property damage in the event of the occurrence of an unusual or emergency at the 
TMF. 

• Develop and Operations, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) Manual for the TMF as part of the 
detailed design.  

• Development of a full closure plan for the TMF based on the final design configuration. 

• Assess the compaction characteristics of the ferricrete/durricrust through the construction of a test 
pad prior to completion of final design. 

FWP 

• Develop a FMEA for the FWP to identify and characterize potential risks associated with the FWP for 
the construction, operations and closure phases. The FMEA should include a risk evaluation matrix 
that provides a rating for the likelihood and consequence for each of the identified risks for the FWP 
and identify design mitigation measures to reduce the identified risks. 

• Complete a breach analysis for the FWP to estimate the potential flood inundation zones that could 
result if the embankment associated with the facility were to fail. The estimated downstream 
inundation zone will help identify any residences, infrastructure and/or receptors that are at risk 
downstream of the FWP. An EPP should be developed to reduce the risk of human life loss and injury, 
and minimize property damage in the event of the occurrence of an unusual or emergency at the 
FWP. 

• Perform a trade-off study to investigate the use of geosynthetics (i.e. geonet) as a replacement for 
the sand and gravel liner bedding cushion layer on the upstream face of the FWP Embankment. 

• Perform stability analysis between the FWP and Malikoundi North Pit. 

• Develop and OMS Manual for the FWP as part of the detailed design.

Water Balance 

• The catchment areas contributing runoff to the Plant Site, open pits and waste dumps, and the 
amount of groundwater inflow to the open pits with time need to be confirmed based on the 
ultimate mine plan. 

• Collection of site specific meteorological and hydrology data. This data will be used to refine seasonal 
runoff values and design storms to be used in future detailed design work. 

• Calibration of the water balance should be completed, based on actual site data, during early years of 
operation 

Water Management Measures 

• Perform further analysis to characterize the geochemical composition of runoff water to provide 
insight into the acceptable discharge limits. 

• Perform bench scale settling testing to characterize the required retention time for suspended solids 
in the runoff water. 

• Develop an operations and management schedule to confirm the design criteria and performance of 
the water management design, specifically the operational, monitoring and maintenance 
requirements. 

26.3 Open Pit Mining 

Significant work has been completed to date on the open pit designs and costing for the Boto 5 and Malikoundi 
pits.  This work demonstrates the potential for economic development of the Project.  There are still some areas 
that can be enhanced to assist in the mine development. 

26.3.1 Geotechnical 

The Boto 5 area and Malikoundi North areas are lacking geotechnical monitoring.  Recommendations by 
Absolute Geotechnics included the installation of instrumentation for monitoring of pore pressure and slope 
stabilities.  This instrumentation has been included in the cost estimate but will need to be detailed and 
installed in the appropriate time frames. 

Waste management facility foundations for Boto 5 and FWP area were a concern on how fast material could be 
placed to allow for sufficient pore depressurization.  That has been considered in the FS but improvements on 
these facilities may assist mine operations during construction.  Further examination needs to be undertaken to 
optimize the existing designs.  This can be completed as part of basic engineering.

26.3.2 Ore Control Procedures  

The FS went into detail with the specific methods of ore control but this area represents a significant area of 
benefit to the overall mine operation if dilution is reduced.  Additional study is required to evaluate exact 
equipment for use in the grade control program and methodologies regarding appropriate sample size to be 
employed in mine operations.  There are specific experts in the field that should be contacted and it would 
benefit the project to consider them prior to mine operations commencing.  

26.3.3 Dewatering 

A more detailed design from a mine operation perspective needs to be completed on the dewatering system.  
This will need input from the hydrogeological engineers to provide further guidance on flow rates.  

26.3.4 Low Grade Material 

An opportunity exists dependent on mill capacity and the gold price.  A review was completed of material that 
existed below the marginal cut-off due to the fact the diluting material was carrying grade.  If the marginal cut-
off was to drop from the existing 0.46 – 0.48 g/t Au to 0.35 g/t Au, an additional 15.6 Mt grading 0.49 g/t Au is 
currently categorized as waste.  This has 246,000 oz contained within that material. Testing of the gold recovery 
at that low level has not been completed but should be part of any basic engineering.  With that information a 
proper economic evaluation of the below cut-off material can be completed to determine if the opportunity to 
process this material is valid.  It is not currently in the mine plan but could be processed in the final year if it 
makes economic sense. 

26.4 Processing 

The process plant is scalable and can be expanded at a later stage to accommodate an increase in throughput. 

Material meeting minimum 3-inch rock size from future drilling activities should be set aside for CWi tests since 
the additional CWi tests planned for in the FS phase were not conducted due to material availability. 

During plant operations, the following items are recommended: 

• Observations made during the test program indicated that an abundance of saprolite in the plant 
feed may cause materials handling and sedimentation problems. A blending strategy should be 
implemented as soon as ore is being mined in order to limit the amount of saprolite in the ROM feed 
to the plant. 

• Particular attention should be paid to the operation and commissioning of the thickener and 
associated flocculant addition systems as this unit operation is expected to be the bottleneck during 
initial operations (given the high proportion of saprolite and transition material scheduled for 
treatment in the mine plan during the first 4 years of operations).  

• Natural cyanide attenuation (free and WAD) be monitored in the TMF. 

• Site water quality (raw and process) be monitored during the initial wet and dry seasons to document 
the seasonal impact of water quality.

• Gold adsorption rate and equilibrium loading on carbon be monitored as the plant head grade varies 
during the life of the operation to ensure that carbon movement and management is optimized. 

• Slurry percent solids in the leaching stage be monitored during start-up and operation as this 
parameter could reduce gold extraction if allowed to deviate significantly from the design value of 
50% w/w solids. 

• Investigate recovering carbon fines with a view to recover additional gold. 

26.5 Overall Recommendation 

Following board approval, it is recommended that IAMGOLD commence implementation of the Project in line 
with the preliminary implementation plan and schedule developed during the FS, and committing to the capital 
expenditure presented in Section 21.
