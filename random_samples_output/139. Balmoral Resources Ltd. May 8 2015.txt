1.0 SUMMARY 
The Grasset Property ("Grasset" or the "Property") covers 380 contiguous claims (210.6 km2) of flat-

lying swamp in the Nord-du-Québec Region of western Québec. The center of the property is located 
approximately 55 km west-northwest of the town of Matagami, Québec, and 155 km north of the town of 
Amos, Québec. Balmoral Resources Ltd. ("Balmoral") holds 100% interest in the mining rights of the 
Property. 

Road access to the property is possible all year, over gravel (20 km) and paved (240 km) roads to the 
towns of Mattagami and Amos, Québec. Camp Fenelon, a permanent road-accessible trailer camp owned by 
Balmoral is located directly to the west of the property, on the Fenelon claims (also owned by Balmoral). 
From this camp, the western portions of the property can be accessed over a network of logging roads; the 
eastern areas of the property require a helicopter for access.  

Several gold and base metal mines are in production or undergoing construction in this part of 
Québec and Ontario, supporting a vibrant infrastructure of mining and exploration services and supplies. 
Several railway lines and commercial airports are located within 200 km of the Grasset property. The region 
experiences a continental-style climate with cold winters and warm summers and drilling can be carried out 
year-round with the exception of spring break-up. 

Grasset lies in the northern portion of the Abitibi Subprovince of the Archean Superior Province of the 
Canadian Shield. It is located in the Harricana-Turgeon greenstone belt within the 2720-2723 Ma Stoughton-
Roquemare assemblage, which is locally referred to as the Manthet domain. This domain comprises 
predominantly east-west trending mafic to intermediate volcanic/pyroclastic rocks that are intercalated with 
pelitic sedimentary rocks and intruded by mafic to ultramafic intrusions and felsic plugs, dykes and sills. The 
southern margin of this domain is bounded by the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone (SLDZ), an east-west 
striking crustal-scale high-strain zone that hosts significant orogenic gold mineralization 75 km to the west at 
the Detour Lake mine (15.55 Moz @ 1.02 g/t Au). 

The Grasset property has been sporadically explored by multiple companies since 1957. As thick 
overburden cover limits the potential for mapping and surface sampling, work has been limited to geophysical 
surveys and diamond drilling. Exploration for orogenic gold and VMS base metal mineralization occurred with 
limited success and the various claims which cover the present Grasset property were allowed to lapse. The 
area was re-staked in 2010 by Balmoral, who have since conducted five drilling campaigns over the course of 
three separate years for a total of 74 diamond drill holes and 23,933 m drilled. In addition to drilling, Balmoral 
has conducted ground based HLEM, airborne VTEM, ground based IP, downhole EM and soil sampling 
programs in an effort to identify buried geological features and refine drill targeting.  

Three distinct mineralization styles have been discovered at Grasset: orogenic gold, ultramafic hosted 
magmatic sulphide Ni-Cu-PGE, and volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS). Of the three, VMS mineralization 
is the least significant, with only a few minor intervals discovered to date and no economically significant 
intersections. Orogenic gold is more significant, as several small zones of high-grade mineralization have 
been discovered. However, the deposit style presently most important to the development of Grasset is 
magmatic sulphide Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization. A package of ultramafic rocks containing Ni-Cu-PGE bearing 
sulphides was discovered during the 2012 drilling program, significantly expanded during the 2014 
exploration season, and continues to be the main exploration target on the property.  

The thick overburden cover and near total lack of outcrop at Grasset makes geophysical surveying 
methods key to identifying prospective targets for drill testing on the property. Property-wide airborne 
VTEM/MAG surveys have identified a large number of magnetic and conductivity anomalies (the majority of 
which are untested) which could be associated with any of the three mineralization styles (VMS, orogenic 
gold and Ni-Cu-PGE) found on the property.  While many of these anomalies are likely to be unmineralized 
bedrock features, they do present an abundance of targets for future work. More targeted ground-based 
methods have also been applied to areas of specific interest – most notably the area surrounding the main 
Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery. This zone has been surveyed with both IP and borehole EM; the results of 
these surveys show that this deposit type has a geophysically detectable signature, that potential exists for 



6 

 

Amended 

the mineralization to extend beyond its presently defined limits and that these methods will prove effective in 
testing other areas.   

A total of 574 soil samples were collected during two campaigns, in the fall of 2012 and spring on 
2013. The majority of samples were analyzed via the MMI (mobile metal ion) method of SGS Labs in an 
attempt to detect the presence of deeply buried mineralization. This method proved to be less effective at 
detecting known mineralization than IP and EM surveys.  

The Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery is a type II ultramafic hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposit which consists of 
discrete horizons of net-textured, massive and semi-massive sulphides within a serpentinized package of 
pyroxene peridotite and olivine pyroxenite termed the Grasset Ultramafic Complex (GUC). The mineralized 
horizons would have originally been conformable with weakly established internal stratigraphy within the 
GUC, but subsequent tectonic deformation has tilted the entire regional sequence such that the stratigraphy, 
and thus the mineralized horizons, are now roughly sub-vertical. The dominant sulphide mineral in these 
horizons is pyrrhotite, with subordinate amounts of pentlandite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. Two significant 
horizons (termed Horizon 1 and Horizon 3) have been discovered, with Horizon 1 extending over the largest 
defined distance and Horizon 3 containing the highest grades of nickel, copper and platinum group elements. 
The horizons strike roughly northwest-southeast, and are separated by 50 – 150 m of sulphide-poor 
members of the GUC. True thickness of the higher-grade intercepts in Horizon 3 is estimated to be 20 – 30 
m, with an average grade of ~1.5% Ni, ~0.15% Cu and ~1 ppm Pt+Pd. There is a moderate amount of 
internal variation within these larger intervals, with individual samples commonly containing >2% or <1% Ni; 
however, the majority of the samples have metal contents relatively close to the mean for the larger zones 
and as such it is appropriate to treat these larger (tens of meters wide) zones as single mineralized intervals. 
These high-grade zones are generally flanked by similarly-sized low-grade zones containing up to 0.5% Ni. 
Relative contents of Ni, Cu, Pt and Pd are remarkably consistent in all mineralized samples, with a 
Ni:Cu:Pd:Pt ratio of approximately 10,000:1,000:0.5:0.25. Stated another way, a sample with 1% Ni will likely 
also contain ~0.1% Cu, 0.5 g/t Pd and 0.25 g/t Pt.    

Minor gold mineralization is hosted in quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins and shears on the Grasset 
Property, but at present no zone large enough to have economic significance has been discovered. The best 
intersections are from an east-west trending structure immediately north of the SLDZ, which hosts multiple 
samples in excess of 5 g/t Au that are sporadically distributed over ~200 m of strike length. However, this 
zone has only been tested by six drill holes and does not demonstrate continuity between individual samples. 
Small discrete gold-bearing veins have also been discovered in the hanging wall to the GUC, but do not 
appear to have significant continuity between them. 

The author has reviewed the analytical techniques, which are industry standard, and the quality 
control and assurances (QA/QC) procedures employed by Balmoral, and believes that sample preparation, 
security, and analytical procedures were adequate for the 2012 and 2014 drilling programs at Grasset. The 
quality control and check assay results confirm that the Grasset assay data generated from the 2014 drilling 
program is accurate, precise and free of contamination to industry standards, and is of sufficient quality to be 
used in resource estimation. Insufficient information is available to make a determination of the quality of 
assay data from the 2011 drill program; however given the lack of significant nickel results and small number 
of significant gold results from 2011, exclusion of this data from any future resource model is not likely to 
have a material impact on the economic viability of the Grasset property.  

The author believes that follow-up exploration on the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery is warranted and 
recommends a program consisting of 10,000 m of diamond drilling, 20 line-km of surface IP and 3,000 m of 
borehole EM be conducted in the winter of 2015. This program would take approximately two months to 
complete at an estimated cost of approximately C$2.05 million.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
The technical report titled "2015 Technical (N.I. 43-101) Report on the Grasset Property" (the 

"Technical Report") was originally filed on SEDAR on March 31, 2015.  The Technical Report is being re-filed 
in order to correct certain typographical errors in Table 5 (pages 44-45). The changes to Table 5 were made 
in order to: (i) add several hole identifications to the "Hole ID" column that had been omitted in the original 
report, and (ii) correct the attributed mineralization horizon for intervals in holes GR-14-16, GR-14-17, GR-14-
22, GR-14-23 and GR-14-25. Additional changes to the report include correction of several minor typographic 
and grammatical errors, and the re-formatting of tables for clarity and consistency. Other than the changes 
noted above, and a note in the first paragraph of Section 2 noting these changes, the Technical Report 
remains the same in all aspects. 

This Technical Report has been prepared for Balmoral Resources Ltd. ("Balmoral") in order to satisfy 
its continuous disclosure requirements for the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Equity Exploration Consultants 
Ltd. ("Equity") was contracted to execute the 2012 diamond drilling program on the Grasset property (Perk et 
al., 2012a), as well as soil sampling programs in 2012 (Perk et al., 2012b) and 2013 (Perk et al., 2013). 
Equity has been engaged by Balmoral to compile all exploration information available on the property and to 
make recommendations for further exploration, if warranted. This report has been prepared on the basis of 
personal observations, information and reports supplied by Balmoral, core-logging carried out by Equity and 
Balmoral geologists, assessment reports filed with the Québec MRN, news releases issued by Balmoral, and 
regional geological publications by the Québec MRN. A complete list of references is provided in Appendix A. 

As author of this report, I am an independent Qualified Person under the meaning of National 
Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). I am not a director, officer or shareholder of Balmoral and have no interest 
in the Grasset property or any nearby properties. I am aware of the operational details of the 2012 and 2013 
exploration programs supervised by Equity, and have reviewed data from the 2014 exploration program 
managed by Balmoral. I inspected the Grasset property from February 3 - 5, 2015, examining mineralized 
drill core, verifying collar locations, inspecting sampling protocols and discussing geological interpretations 
with Balmoral geologists.  

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
In Section 4.0, the author has relied entirely upon information provided by Balmoral concerning 

mineral tenure, ownership and the absence of any royalties or other encumbrances. Otherwise, the authors 
have not relied upon a report, opinion or statement of another expert concerning legal, political, 
environmental or tax matters relevant to the technical report. 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Grasset Property is located in the James Bay region of the province of Quebec, approximately 55 

km west-northwest from the town of Matagami and 155 km north of the town of Amos (Figure 1). The 
Property consists of 380 contiguous claims that cover an area of 21,059.44 hectares (210.6 km2) within the 
townships of Fenelon, Du Tast, Subercase, and Grasset on NTS map sheets 32L01, 32L02, 32E15, and 
32E16. The centre of the property lies at 49˚ 58' N latitude and 78˚ 20' W longitude (NAD-83 UTM Zone 17N: 
692000E 5539000N). 

Claim data is detailed in Appendix B. In Québec, claims give the holder an exclusive right to search 
for mineral substances except sand, gravel, clay and other unconsolidated deposits. Claims are acquired 
through Internet map-staking with boundaries defined on maps kept at the MRN's Bureau du Registraire. The 
claims form a seamless grid without overlap (Figures 2a, b). 

The Grasset package of claims was staked by Balmoral adjacent to the Fenelon Property, which they 
acquired from American Bonanza in 2010. All claims are 100% registered in the name of Balmoral 
Resources. Staking of the claims happened in several stages, with the initial round immediately following 



8 

 

Amended 

acquisition of the Fenelon property, with additional ground staked in 2011 and 2013 (see Appendix B for 
details).  

To the author's knowledge, the property is not subject to any royalties, back-in rights or other 
agreements and encumbrances. No significant environmental liabilities were noted by the author on the 
Grasset property. 

The claims confer rights to hard-rock mineral exploration only. Mine development requires conversion 
of claims to a mining lease. Surface rights over the Grasset property are held by the Crown, as administered 
by the Province of Québec. The ownership of other rights (timber, water, trapping, etc.) over the Grasset 
property has not been investigated by the author. The Grasset property is located within the traditional 
territory of the Cree First Nations of Waskaganish and Washaw Sibi. The Property is located within the 
confines of the James Bay Accord between the Cree First Nations and the province of Québec which 
facilitated the development of extensive hydro-electric facilities to the north of the property.

Claims have initial terms of two years. Québec law requires assessment expenditures to maintain 
tenure ownership past the current expiry dates. Allowable assessment work must be completed prior to 60 
days before expiry of the claim. Required amounts of work for two-year renewals vary depending upon 
location, size and age of the claim. For all claims within the Grasset Property, the required biennial 
assessment amounts to $2,500/claim. Assessment filing fees of $53/claim are payable if filed >60 days prior 
to the claim expiry date, doubling to $106/claim if filed within 60 days of the claim expiry date.  

Permits are required for any exploration program which involves camp construction or tree-cutting, 
including drilling, helicopter use or road construction. Permitting timelines are short, typically on the order of 
3-4 weeks. Balmoral has the required permits to execute drilling during the upcoming exploration season, 
although amendments may be required to allow minor shifts in the locations of drill sites.  

The author is not aware of any of significant factors which may affect access, title or ability to perform 
exploration work on the property. 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 
All of Balmoral's exploration programs have been based out of Camp Fenelon, which is road 

accessible from the town of Amos along 168 km of paved provincial highway 111, then 70 km of paved forest 
road R1036 and 20 km of gravel road. The town of Val d'Or lies an additional 67 km south of Amos whereas 
Matagami lies 185 km to the north.  

The Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE prospect lies ~5 km from Camp Fenelon. In summer time, the best way to 
access the project area is by helicopter although historic logging roads may be used to access parts of the 
property via all-terrain vehicle (ATV). These logging roads require some upgrading in order to become 
passable for pick-up traffic in the summer. In the winter time, historic logging roads can be used for winter 
road access.  

5.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
Accommodations at Camp Fenelon, which is owned by Balmoral, consists of ATCO trailers with 

indoor plumbing, potable water well and forced-air heating. Electricity runs on a 78 kW generator. The camp 
has the capacity to support up to 25 people. Supplies, personnel, and maintenance support can be brought to 
the camp from the nearby towns of Amos, Québec (pop. 12,671), and Val d'Or, Québec (pop. 31,862) 
(Statistics Canada, 2011), via road transportation. 

Amos and Val d'Or offer a full range of services and supplies for mineral exploration, including skilled 
and unskilled labour, bulk fuel, freight, heavy equipment, groceries and hardware. The nearest helicopter 
bases are in Cochrane, Ontario and La Sarre Quebec, located 210 km southwest and 140 km south of the 
Grasset Property respectively (Figure 3). Val d'Or is the nearest regional airport to Martinière which has daily 
commercial flights to Montreal. Several gold and base metal mines are in production or undergoing 
construction throughout this part of Québec and Ontario, supporting a vibrant infrastructure of mining and 
exploration services.  

The nearest rail access is via the CN Rail line to Matagami, 55 km east of Grasset and the Ontario 
Northland Railway line through Cochrane, Ontario, 210 km southwest of Grasset.  

Surface rights over the Grasset Property are owned by the Crown and administered by the Province 
of Québec and would be available for any eventual mining operation. The Property has abundant water and 
water rights could be obtained for milling. It is still too early to determine potential tailings storage areas, 
potential waste disposal areas, and potential processing plant sites.

5.3 Physiography and Climate 
The Grasset Property is covered by extensive, thick Pleistocene glacial sediments, averaging 60 to 90 

m thick. Bedrock exposures are scarce, locally occurring on small knolls and along major rivers. Most of the 
area is covered with swamps and flat forests formed by spruce, fir and pine. Some areas of the property have 
recently been logged and partly re-vegetated (Brousseau, 2006). The minimum and maximum elevations on 
the property are 250 m and 320 m above sea level, respectively. 

The region experiences a typical continental-style climate with cold winters and warm summers. Snow 
accumulation begins in November and generally remains until early May. Environment Canada climate data 
from the nearest weather station in the town of Matagami, Quebec, indicate that the daily average 
temperature ranges from -20° C in January to 16° C in July (EnvironmentCanada, 2012). The coldest months 
are December to March, during which temperatures can fall below -40° C. Matagami has an average of 91 
cm of precipitation per year with the average snow depth peaking at 65 cm in February (EnvironmentCanada, 
2012). Drilling can be conducted year-round with the exception of spring thaw from mid-March to May. 

6.0 HISTORY 
Historical work on Grasset dates back to 1957 and consists dominantly of geophysical surveys and 

diamond drilling. A total of 45 drill holes were completed between 1957 and 1996, most of which targeted 
geophysical anomalies. A brief description of the historical work completed at Grasset is provided below. 

The first public records of exploration in the Grasset area were produced in 1957 by the Subercase 
Syndicate, who drilled four holes near Grasset Lake. Three of these holes fall within the area currently 
included within the Grasset Property. The most notable result from this drill program was the discovery of a 
massive sulphide interval hosted by intermediate volcanic rocks within the upper portion of hole #2 
(Cunningham-Dunlop, 1957). 

Orchan Mines Ltd conducted magnetometer, electromagnetic (EM) and induced polarization (IP) 
surveys in 1958, followed by four drill holes in 1959. No data is available from these programs.  

In 1960, Nipiron Mines Ltd drilled two holes within the current Grasset claim boundary. Drilling 
intersected diorite and siliceous andesite along with thin layers of graphitic rock (Jowsey, 1960). Gold was 
reported in five samples with 0.2-2.1 g/t Au in association with silicification and fine-grained pyrite. 

At around the same time, in 1961, Hudson Bay Exploration drilled five holes in the northeast corner of 
the Grasset claims, near Peter Lake (Gamey, 1961). An area of strong shearing with quartz veining 
containing pyrite and pyrrhotite mineralization was intersected in Pete-1 but, unfortunately, no gold assays 
were reported.  

After a 12 year hiatus in exploration activity, Selco Exploration returned to the area in 1974 to test an 
airborne electromagnetic conductor with a single drill hole (Peacock, 1974). This hole intersected mostly 
intermediate-felsic tuffs, within which a unit of massive and disseminated pyrite, pyrrhotite and minor 
chalcopyrite, with weakly anomalous Cu, Zn, Pb and Ag, was encountered from 62.5-68.0 m depth. 

Another 13 years later, in 1987, Noble Peak Exploration drilled eight holes near the southern claim 
boundary of the current Grasset claims. Two of these holes did not reach bedrock whereas the other six 
failed to return gold values that warranted follow-up drilling. On the positive side, the authors concluded that 
they had intersected two structural zones analogous to, if not the extension of, regional gold-bearing 
structures outlined further to the west (Beesley and Forbes, 1987). Presumably this would be the structure 
now known as the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone which hosts the world-class Detour Lake gold deposit. 

In 1996, Fairstar Exploration reported on four holes that they drilled on the Grasset property, none of 
which returned significant gold values. However DT96-2 intersected a 30 cm quartz vein sample with 209 g/t 
silver (Dion and Keast, 1996). 

There have been no significant historical mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates for the 
Grasset property and there has been no production from it.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 
The Grasset Property lies in the northern portion of the Abitibi Subprovince, which itself lies in the 

south-central part of the Archean Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. Mapping of sporadic outcrops, 
integrated with regional airborne geophysical surveys, indicate that the project area lies within the North 
Volcanic or Harricana-Turgeon Greenstone Belt (Lacroix, 1990), near the boundary between the Abitibi and 
Opatica subprovinces (Figure 4). 

The Abitibi Subprovince is composed of east-trending synclines of largely volcanic rocks and 
intervening domes cored by synvolcanic and/or syntectonic plutonic rocks (gabbro-diorite, tonalite, and 
granite) alternating with east-trending bands of turbiditic wackes. Thurston et al (2008) divided the 
stratigraphy of the Abitibi Subprovince into seven discrete volcanic assemblages and two later sedimentary-
dominated assemblages (Table 2). Volcanic and sedimentary strata are generally vertically inclined and 
separated by abrupt, east-trending faults with variable dip. Smaller north-south trending cross faults are 
widespread, but do not form significant lithological boundaries. Some of these faults, such as the Porcupine-
Destor fault, display evidence for overprinting deformation events including early thrusting followed by later 
strike-slip and extension events. Two ages of unconformable successor basins occur: early, widely 
distributed "Porcupine-style" basins of fine-grained clastic rocks, followed by "Timiskaming-style" basins of 
coarser clastic and minor volcanic rocks which are largely proximal to major strike-slip faults (e.g. Porcupine-
Destor, Larder-Cadillac, Sunday Lake). In addition, the Abitibi Subprovince is cut by numerous late-tectonic 
plutons ranging in composition from syenite and gabbro to granite with lesser dikes of lamprophyre and 
carbonatite (Thurston et al., 2008). 

The northern Abitibi Subprovince has undergone four main deformation events (Daigneault et al., 
2004) that include: (1) regional D1 N-S folds developed pre-2710 Ma, (2) E-W trending and subvertical D2 
schistosity associated with E-W regional folding (2710-2706 Ma), (3) longitudinal D3 thrust faults (2705-2697 
Ma) that cross-cut D2 folds, and (4) E-W trending D4 dextral strike-slip faults.

7.2 Local Geology and Mineralization 
The Grasset Property is located in the Harricana-Turgeon (H-T) greenstone belt of the Abitibi 

Subprovince, near the boundary between the Abitibi and Opatica subprovinces. The H-T greenstone belt is 
formed by the Stoughton-Roquemare, Porcupine and Deloro assemblages of Thurston et al (2008), which are 
locally referred to as the Manthet, Matagami and Broullian-Fenelon domains (Wagner, 2012). The boundaries 
between these domains are zones of high-strain that include the Lower Detour (LDDZ) and Sunday Lake 
(SLDZ) deformation zones (Figure 5). The SLDZ separates the Manthet and Matagami domains whereas the 
LDDZ occurs between the Matagami and Broullian-Fenelon domains. In addition, the SLDZ hosts the world-
class Detour gold deposit located ~75 km to the west in Ontario.  

The Manthet Domain lies north of the SLDZ and is formed predominantly by mafic to intermediate 
volcanic/pyroclastic units that comprise part of the 2720-2723 Ma Stoughton-Roquemare assemblage. 
Volcanic units are commonly intercalated with pelitic sedimentary units and intruded by mafic to ultramafic 
inturions. Lesser volumes of felsic volcanic rocks, as wel as small felsic intrusive bodies, dykes, and sills, also 
occur throughout this domain. Late north- to northwest-trending mafic dykes appear to represent the most 
recent lithological element (Wagner, 2012). Units are predominantly east-west striking and subvertically 
oriented. The degree of metamorphism and deformation within the Manthet domain increases gradually 
northward toward the Opatica gneiss. 

The Matagami Domain is bound by the SLDZ in the north and LDDZ in the south, abutting the 
Manthet and Broullian-Fenelon domains respectively. Rock types consist mostly of wackes and argillites, as 
well as tuffaceous units and iron formation (Lacroix, 1988), all of which belong to the 2685-2690 Ma 
Porcupine assemblage of Thurston et al (2008). The iron formation units show strong lateral continuity along 
east-west trends. Other rock types include numerous mafic to ultramafic sill-like intrusions and at least one 
larger composite mafic-ultramafic intrusion. The contact between the Matagami and Manthet domains is a 
focus for shearing and faulting along the SLDZ, which dips 70°-80° to the south-southwest (Wagner, 2012). It

can be traced through geophysical interpretation for over 100 km in an east-west direction and passes 
through the center of the Grasset Property.  

The volcanic-dominated Broullian-Fenelon domain lies to the south of the LDDZ and comprises 
mostly mafic volcanic rocks that belong to the 2724-2734 Ma Deloro assemblage of Thurston et al (2008). 
This domain contains a greater volume of felsic volcanic and intrusive rocks than the Manthet Domain and 
hosts the formerly producing Selbaie VMS deposit. 

Immediately to the west, Balmoral's Fenelon property contains a typical Archean orogenic gold zone 
that is named the Discovery Zone. This zone is associated with shearing and silicification of a gabbro or 
pyroxenite body and is located north of both the regional Lower Detour and Sunday Lake deformation zones. 
High-grade gold mineralization is contained within a series of structurally controlled shears and quartz veins 
and is associated with approximately 5 to 10% pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite (Leclerc and Giguère, 
2010). No other major mineral deposits have been discovered in the immediate vicinity of the Grasset 
property, though regional mineral endowment is abundant (e.g. current and past producing mines at Selbaie, 
Matagami and Detour, as shown on Figure 4).  

7.3 Property Geology 
The Grasset Property is covered by ~100 m of glacial overburden consisting mainly of sandy and 

gravel outwash material and boulder-rich tills. As a result, outcrop is limited across the property so that 
detailed information on property-scale geology is only available for those areas that have been drilled. Figure 
6 shows a property-wide geological map derived from mapping and geophysical interpretation by the MRN 
(2007a, b). Sedimentary rocks of the Matagami Domain (or Porcupine assemblage) are interpreted to run 
through the centre of the property, with Manthet Domain occurring to the north and Brouillian-Fenelon 
Domain to the south. Presumably, the SLDZ and LDDZ structures, which bound the Matagami Domain, also 
run through the center of the Grasset Property.    

The contact between the Matagami and Manthet domains is a focus for shearing and faulting (and 
thus favourable for orogenic gold mineralization), with evidence for a deformation zone at an interpreted dip 
of -72° to -82° to the south-southwest (Wagner, 2012). During the 2011, 2012 and 2014 drill programs, gold 
mineralization was generally intersected both proximal to this contact deformation zone and at variable 
depths into the gabbro footwall. 

Of note is the presence of a thick package of heterolithic conglomerates to the south of the SLDZ 
shear, containing sheared, rounded to sub-rounded clasts of many lithologies not commonly found nearby, 
including granitoids. These conglomerates bear strong resemblances to "Timiskaming-Type" conglomerates, 
which are spatially associated with gold deposits elsewhere in the Abitibi (Wagner, 2012).  

The bulk of historical and recent drill holes have been collared north of the SLDZ, in the Manthet 
Domain. These drill holes have shown that besides mafic volcanic rocks, the Manthet Domain in this area 
also includes mafic to ultramafic intrusive bodies, namely the Grasset Ultramafic Complex (GUC), which 
hosts the Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization described in this report. The GUC itself is composed of a sequence of 
olivine pyroxenite, black pyroxenite, and pyroxene dunite, with a serpentine and talc-carbonate alteration 
overprint. Outside of the zone of the drilling outlined in section 10, there is at least one additional occurrence 
of ultramafic rocks, in the northern-most part of the claim block (hole FB-96-1 in Dion and Keast (1996)). 
Geophysical data suggests that ultramafic rocks of the GUC may extend continuously from the area of 
present drilling to drillhole FB-96-1 (Figure 6). If this unit does extend over such a large extent, this has 
significant implications for future mineral exploration.

7.4 Property Mineralization 
Mineralization on the Grasset Property is only known through drilling (Figures 7a, 7b), which has 

tested just a small part of the property. Three distinct styles of mineralization have been discovered: 
ultramafic-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE, orogenic gold and volcanogenic massive sulphide. Of these, the Ni-Cu-PGE 
mineralization is currently the most economically promising, and has received the majority of recent drilling 
(Table 4). 

7.4.1 Magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE 
Magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization was discovered on the Grasset property during the 2012 drilling 

campaign, when a zone of anomalous nickel was intersected within an ultramafic intrusive interval in GR-12-
09. Prior to this discovery, there had been no evidence for this deposit style on the property and magmatic 
nickel-sulphides had not been considered as an exploration target. Details of this deposit style are discussed 
in section 8.1.  

Mineralization is concentrated in stacked sulphide-bearing horizons within the GUC, and is 
characterized by the presence of meter-scale layers of net-textured, blebby semi-massive and massive 
sulphide. Pyrrhotite is the dominant sulphide mineral, with subordinate amounts of pentlandite, pyrite and 
chalcopyrite. Concentration of pentlandite and chalcopyrite (and thus Ni and Cu content) is proportional to the 
total sulphide content, meaning zones of massive sulphide can be expected to host significantly higher 
grades than blebby or net-textured zones. The distribution of these zones is controlled by primary 
stratigraphy and zonation within the GUC, with only minor late-stage remobilization of metals in sulphide 
veins.  

Follow-up drilling stepped to the northwest of the initial discovery hole (GR-12-09) has thus far defined 
three steeply dipping NW-SE striking horizons within the GUC that host Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization (Figure 8). 
Horizon 1 has been defined over the longest strike length of the three (~900 m) but is generally of lower 
grade than Horizon 3. Horizon 2 is the smallest and lowest-grade of the three, at present known to host only 
relatively low values of Ni-Cu-PGE (0.5 – 1% Ni) over ~250 m strike length. Horizon 3 has received the most 
drilling, is defined over ~500 m strike length and hosts the highest Ni-Cu-PGE grades defined to date. The 
horizons are stacked (i.e., at different levels in the stratigraphy, not along strike from one another), ~25 – 
50 m thick and separated by 10 – 50 m of unmineralized (sulphide-deficient) ultramafic rock. There does not 
appear to be a primary lithological control on distribution of mineralization – as described in section 8.1, 
sulphide distribution in magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits is controlled by geometry of the original magma 
chamber/lava flow and is not directly related to host lithology. All three horizons are open at depth. Assay 
results and more detailed geology of drill holes intersecting the GUC are presented in section 10.2. 

7.4.2 Orogenic Gold 
As described in section 8.2, orogenic gold mineralization is found throughout the Abitibi subprovince. 

Because thick glacial overburden obscures direct observation of outcrop and impairs soil geochemistry, 
geophysics is the primary method for targeting exploration in the area. As orogenic gold deposits are 
commonly associated with second-order structures splayed off of regional shears, the SLDZ (itself detectable 
through large magnetic field contrast on the Grasset property) and its splays are a favourable area to focus 
orogenic gold exploration, and have been the target of much of the historic drilling.  

From the documentation available (limited to partial reports filed with Quebec MNR), it appears that 
there was no significant gold found on the property until 2011, when Balmoral intersected economically 
interesting gold mineralization in hole GR-11-01 (see section 10.3 and Table 6). Mineralization consists of a 
set of gold-bearing quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins within a shear zone immediately north of the contact 
between sedimentary rocks of the Matagami domain to the south and mafic to ultramafic rocks of the Manthet 
domain to the north. This intercept was followed up on during the remainder of the 2011 season and was the 
primary focus of the 2012 drilling campaign. A zone of narrow gold-bearing veins/shears is defined over 75 m 
strike length by 150 m vertical extent, with narrow (1 – 2 m core length) high grade shoots hosting up to ~10 
g/t Au within larger (10 – 30 m core length) zones of 0.1 – 1 g/t Au (Figure 9). An additional, smaller cluster of 
gold mineralization is found in the volcanic units directly to the southwest of the Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization 



22 

 

Amended 

within the GUC (described in section 7.4.1). Despite several minor intersection hosting up to 1 – 2 g/t Au over  
3 – 5 m, this set of intercepts does not appear to link up into a larger zone and is of interest mainly as a 
secondary target of interest mainly due to its proximity to the main Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery.  

A complete description of the mineralogy, grade and thickness of the significant orogenic gold 
intercepts on the Grasset property can be found in section 10.3. 

7.4.3 Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide 
As described in section 8.3, the Grasset property is in a favourable geologic setting for VMS-style 

mineralization, and isolated occurrences of this deposit type have been discovered through exploratory 
drilling (see section 10.4 for details). However, none of the intercepts have been linked into larger mineralized 
trends and all are generally lacking in economically interesting base or precious metal contents. At present, 
there are no known instances of VMS mineralization on the Grasset property which are considered to be of 
material economic significance.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Exploration has targeted three distinct deposit types on the Grasset property: ultramafic-hosted Ni-Cu-

PGE deposits; orogenic gold deposits, and: volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits. Salient 
characteristics of each of these deposit types are summarized below. 

8.1 Ultramafic-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposits 
Magmatic sulphide Nickel-Copper-Platinum Group Element (Ni-Cu-PGE) deposits are one of the 

major global sources of nickel and platinum group elements, with notable examples including the Sudbury 
Igneous Complex and Noril'sk-Talnalk deposits. All deposits of this type are associated with mafic and 
ultramafic units and can be broadly divided into two classes based on host rock and Ni/Cu ratios. Class 1 
deposits are associated with gabbronorite and troctolite bodies and have Ni/Cu ratios from 0.8 - 2.5. Class 2 
deposits are those associated with ultramafic units, and which have Ni/Cu ratios greater than 3 (Barnes and 
Lightfoot, 2005). While the majority (~80%) of the total global Ni-Cu-PGE resources are hosted in Class 1 
deposits, the existence of the giant Sudbury and Noril'sk deposits (accounting for 30% and 35% of metal 
endowment worldwide respectively) heavily skew this figure; small to medium size Class 2 deposits are 
relatively common and often of economic significance, with notable examples including Mt Keith in Western 
Australia, the Thompson Belt in Manitoba and the Cape Smith/Raglan camp in Quebec.  

Formation of a Ni-Cu-PGE deposit requires four key steps, regardless of whether it is associated with 
mafic or ultramafic host rocks (Arndt et al., 2005). First, a sufficient volume of metal-bearing mafic or 
ultramafic magma must form and ascend to a depth where it can be intruded near surface or ultimately erupt 
as a volcanic flow. Second, the magma must interact with crustal rock, and become contaminated with and 
scavenge sulphur so that it segregates an immiscible sulphide melt. Third, the sulphide-enriched portions 
must interact with the silicate melt, preferentially incorporating/scavenging those elements with a stronger 
affinity for sulphide than silicate minerals (i.e., Ni, Cu, PGEs and chalcophile elements). Finally this Ni-Cu-
PGE enriched sulphide melt must accumulate in sufficient quantity to form an economic deposit. The final two 
steps in this process are especially key in producing a deposit of economic significance, as without the proper 
physical conditions to expose the sulphide liquid to a large volume of silicate melt from which to scavenge 
metals and then to concentrate the sulphides, the resulting deposit will be too low grade to be economically 
feasible (Naldrett, 1999). 

Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization on the Grasset property is associated with ultramafic rocks of the GUC, and 
as such the deposit can be placed in the Class 2 group of Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. In this deposit model, the key 
step of sulphide accumulation can occur in one of two ways. Type I mineralization is found as massive to 
semi-massive sulphide bodies at the base of a stratified komatiite flow. Within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, 
this mineralization style has been identified within the Tisdale and Kidd-Munro assemblages, making it the 
more common of the two within the Abitibi. Type II mineralization is defined as disseminated sulphides 
stratabound internally within a sill or dyke (Lesher and Keays, 2002). Outside of the Abitibi greenstone belt, 
one of the better studied type examples of Type II is at Mt. Keith in Australia, where Ni-PGE bearing 
sulphides are hosted within cumulate textured, dunnite and peridotite pods in which compositional variation is 
controlled by primary igneous layering. These pods are contained within a larger ultramafic intrusive unit 
which has undergone pervasive serpentinization and local talc-carbonate alteration following middle to upper 
greenschist facies metamorphism. Sulphide mineralogy is dominated by pyrrhotite-pentlandite, with 
subordinate quantities of pyrite and (locally) chalcopyrite. The form of sulphide accumulations vary between 
the layers of the ultramafic complex, ranging from finely disseminated grains to coarse blebs to up to 1.5 mm 
in diameter. In the Mt. Keith deposit, ore-grade material typically contains 1 – 5 % total sulphide (Barnes et 
al., 2011). Comparisons to the Mt. Keith deposit indicate that the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery is most likely 
a Type II Ultramafic-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposit.  

8.2 Orogenic gold deposits 
The term orogenic gold deposit reflects the temporal and spatial association of this deposit type with 

late stages of orogenesis (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et 
al., 1998). This very important category includes some of the largest gold deposits and districts in the world 



28 

 

Amended 

(e.g. Kalgoorlie in Australia, Timmins in Ontario and Ashanti in Ghana). Formation of orogenic gold 
mineralization was concentrated during the time intervals of 2.8 to 2.55 Ga (Archean), 2.1 to 1.8 Ga (Early 
Proterozoic) and 600 to 50 Ma (Phanerozoic). A very important subtype of orogenic gold deposits is 
dominantly hosted by mafic metamorphic rocks in granite-greenstone terranes, and is referred to here as 
greenstone-hosted orogenic gold. 

Greenstone-hosted orogenic gold deposits are structurally controlled, complex epigenetic deposits 
that are hosted in deformed and regionally metamorphosed terranes. They consist of simple to complex 
networks of gold-bearing, laminated quartz-carbonate fault-fill veins in moderately to steeply dipping, 
compressional brittle-ductile shear zones and faults, with locally associated extensional veins and 
hydrothermal breccias. They are dominantly hosted by mafic metamorphic rocks of greenschist to locally 
lower amphibolite facies and formed at intermediate depths (5 - 10 km). The relative timing of mineralization 
is syn- to late-deformation and typically post-peak greenschist-facies or syn-peak amphibolite facies 
metamorphism. They are formed from low salinity, H2O-CO2-rich hydrothermal fluids with typically anomalous 
concentrations of CH4, N2, K, and S. Gold is mainly confined to the quartz-carbonate vein networks but may 
also be present in significant amounts within iron-rich sulphidized wall rock.  

Greenstone-hosted orogenic gold deposits were formed during compressional to transpressional 
deformation processes at convergent plate margins in accretionary and collisional orogens. Orogenic Au 
systems are typically associated with deep-crustal fault zones, which show complex structural histories and 
may extend along strike for hundreds of kilometres with widths of as much as a few thousand metres. These 
faults commonly mark the convergent margins between major lithological boundaries, such as volcano-
plutonic and sedimentary domains. The large greenstone-hosted orogenic gold deposits are commonly 
spatially associated with fluvio-alluvial conglomerate (e.g. Timiskaming conglomerate) distributed along these 
crustal fault zones (e.g. Destor Porcupine Fault). As a result, Dubé and Gosselin (2007) infer an empirical 
time and space relationship between large-scale deposits and regional unconformities.  

Large gold camps are commonly associated with curvatures, flexures, and dilational jogs along major 
compressional fault zones creating dilational zones that allowed migration of hydrothermal fluids. Ores 
formed as vein fill of second and third-order compressional reverse-oblique to oblique brittle-ductile high-
angle shear and high-strain zones, commonly located within 5 km of the first order fault and are best 
developed in the hanging wall. Ore shoots can be localized by dilational jogs or various intersections between 
a structural element (e.g. a fault, shear or vein) and a favourable lithological unit, such as a competent 
gabbroic sill, a dyke, an iron formation, or a particularly reactive rock. Intersections between different 
structural elements active at the time of vein formation can also localise ore deposition. Individual vein 
thickness varies from a few centimetres to over 10 m, although entire deposits may be wider than 1 km and 
extend along strike for as much as 2 to 5 km. The vertical extent of ore bodies is commonly greater than 1 km 
and some deposits have been economically mined to depths of 1 to 3 km.  

The veins in greenstone-hosted orogenic gold deposits are hosted by a wide variety of rock types 
including; mafic and ultramafic volcanic rocks, competent iron-rich differentiated tholeiitic gabbroic sills and 
granitoid intrusions. In each district however, there may be lithological units which serve as better chemical 
and/or structural traps for depositing mineralizing fluids. 

The main gangue minerals are quartz and carbonate (calcite, dolomite, ankerite, and siderite), with 
variable amounts of white micas, chlorite, tourmaline, and locally scheelite. Sulphide minerals typically 
constitute less than 5 to 10% of the volume of the ore bodies. The main ore minerals are native gold with, in 
decreasing amounts, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite and occur without any significant vertical mineral 
zoning. Arsenopyrite commonly represents the main sulphide in amphibolite-facies rocks and in deposits 
hosted by clastic sediments. Trace amounts of molybdenite and tellurides are present in some deposits. 

Typically, the proximal alteration haloes are zoned and characterized, in rocks at greenschist facies, 
by iron-carbonatization and sericitization, with sulphidation of the immediate vein selvages (mainly pyrite, less 
commonly arsenopyrite). Further away from the vein, alteration is characterized by various amounts of 
chlorite and calcite, and locally magnetite. The dimensions of the alteration haloes vary with composition of 
the host rocks and may envelope entire deposits hosted by mafic and ultramafic rocks. Pervasive chromium- 
or vanadium-rich green micas (fuchsite and roscoelite) and ankerite with zones of quartz-carbonate

Amended 

stockwork are common in sheared ultramafic rocks. Hydrothermal assemblages associated with gold 
mineralization in amphibolite-facies rocks include biotite, amphibole, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and arsenopyrite, and, 
at higher grades, biotite/phlogopite, diopside, garnet, pyrrhotite and/or arsenopyrite, with variable proportions 
of feldspar, calcite, and clinozoisite. The variations in alteration styles have been interpreted as a direct 
reflection of the depth of formation of the deposits (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007). 

8.3 Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide deposits 
Some historic exploration programs at Grasset were focused on the discovery of volcanogenic 

massive sulphide (VMS) deposits. VMS deposits are formed in sub-seafloor convection systems that are 
typically established within extensional tectonic settings, and form from metal-rich hydrothermal fluids. They 
are still forming today at black smoker localities on mid-oceanic ridges around the world. The oldest known 
examples of VMS deposits formed 3.5 billion year ago. They are mined as important sources of Zn, Pb, Cu, 
Ag and/or Au, in addition to possible endowment in Co, Sn, Se, Mn, Cd, In, Bi, Te, Ga and Ge (Galley et al., 
2007). Classification schemes have been based on, for example, tectonic setting (Sawkins, 1976) and major 
ore element geochemistry (Hutchinson, 1973), with the currently most accepted scheme based on the 
lithology of the host rocks (Barrie and Hannington, 1999; Franklin et al., 2005). 

The Abitibi Subprovince hosts numerous world-class VMS deposits, including Kidd Creek (149.2 Mt 
@ 2.89% Cu, 6.36% Zn, 0.22% Pb, 92 g/t Ag) and La Ronde (88.1 Mt @ 0.32% Cu, 1.71% Zn, 40.9 g/t Ag, 
5.07 g/t Au). The former producing Selbaie Mine (47.3 Mt @ 0.98% Cu, 1.98% Zn, 20 g/t Ag, 0.9 g/t Au) lies 
within the 2724-2734 Ma Deloro assemblage (or Broullian-Fenelon domain), ~45 km southwest of the 
Grasset property.  

A typical VMS deposit comprises a concordant lens of massive sulphide, containing >60% sulphide 
minerals, that is underlain by a discordant stockwork zone, typically comprising stockwork veins and stringers 
of vein-hosted sulphide occurring within a pipe-like body of hydrothermally altered rock (Lydon, 1988). The 
most abundant sulphide mineral is typically pyrite, followed by pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena. 
Sulpho-salts and bornite may occur in trace amounts. Other common metallic non-sulphide minerals include 
magnetite, hematite and casiterite, whereas typical gangue phases include quartz, chlorite, barite, gypsum 
and carbonates (Lydon, 1988). 

The average size of VMS deposits ranges from 2.8 to 23.7 Mt depending on the host lithology (Barrie 
and Hannington, 1999), with those hosted in bimodal-siliciclastic rocks typically the largest and those hosted 
within mafic rocks the smallest. Most of the VMS deposits in the Abitibi Subprovince fall within the bimodal-
mafic category, which ranks among the smaller types of VMS deposit but is the most abundant on a global 
scale. Bimodal-mafic deposits are typically associated with rhyolite domes that formed on thick pillow basalt 
units. The deposits themselves typically comprise a zoned massive sulphide lens, comprising an upper 
pyrite-sphalerite-chalcopyrite unit underlain by pyrite-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite, passing downwards into a 
pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite stockwork zone (Barrie and Hannington, 1999; Franklin et al., 2005). 

9.0 EXPLORATION 
The Grasset property was staked by Balmoral Resources in 2010 and lies adjacent to their Fenelon 

Property that was purchased from American Bonanza. Since that time, Balmoral has conducted exploration 
campaigns in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The initial campaigns comprised property wide geophysical and 
soil sampling surveys, in addition to drilling of orogenic gold targets. The exploration focus changed in 2013, 
when a ground-based induced polarization survey revealed a significant chargeability anomaly that was 
subsequently drill-tested in early 2014. This drill program resulted in the discovery of Ni-Cu-PGE 
mineralization associated with the Grasset Ultramafic Complex. The total exploration production is 
summarized in Table 3 and described in more detail below.

9.1 Airborne Magnetic/Electromagnetic Geophysics 
Balmoral contracted Geotech Ltd. of Aurora, Ontario to conduct a helicopter-borne EM survey using 

their Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic (VTEMplus) system over the Grasset property between October 
5th and October 12th, 2011. The work was split into two smaller projects, with 440.8 line-km flown over the 
western part of the property from the 5th to the 7th of October, 2011 and an additional 1622.4 line-km of data 
acquired over the eastern portion of the property from the 7th to the 12th of October, 2011. Both surveys were 
flown with 100 m traverse line spacing and perpendicular tie lines spaced at 1000 m. The main traverse lines 
were oriented at an azimuth of 0° over the western portion of the property and 30° on the eastern grid (Fiset 
et al., 2011a, b). 

The survey was successful in identifying several strong magnetic and conductive trends on the 
Grasset property (Figures 10, 11). The magnetic trends correlate well to the interpreted regional geology, with 
magnetic highs representing mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Manthet and Broullian-Nord groups and the 
most pronounced magnetic lows representing rocks of the metasedimentary Turgeon River Formation. 
Equivalent geophysical anomalies/contacts elsewhere in the region are expressions of well-developed shear 
zones which serve as a locus for orogenic gold mineralization (e.g. on the Martinière property as described in 
Perk (2013)). As such, much of the previous exploration work (both by Balmoral and previous operators) has 
focused on areas near this contact.  

The survey of the Grasset East grid identified a number of strong conductors, largely localized in two 
distinct bands along the northeastern and southwestern edges of the property (Figure 11). Both zones are 
correlated with strong magnetic highs. The northeastern conductive zone has been drill-tested by 13 historic 
holes over a 6.5 km strike length. None of these holes intersected any significant mineralization and no 
follow-up work has been done by Balmoral. The survey of the Grasset West grid identified three discrete 
conductive zones, all of which are associated with magnetic highs within the mafic and ultramafic rock units 
of the Manthet Domain (Figure 11). Unlike results of the Grasset East survey there appears to be no direct 
correlation between the strength of the conductive response and the strength of the total magnetic field. The 
weakest conductor is found at the edge of the strongest magnetic high – and it is within this weakly 
conductive magnetic high that the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery was found, suggesting that the zones which 
gave the strongest electromagnetic responses to this survey are not necessarily the best candidates for Ni-
Cu-PGE mineralization.  

A second, somewhat smaller, airborne survey was flown during the 2014 exploration season. 
Balmoral again contracted Geotech and their airborne VTEMplus system, this time to conduct three smaller 
grids over portions of the property which had not previously been surveyed or justified more detailed 
exploration. The Nickel Test grid was flown over the area of the 2012/2014 Ni-Cu-PGE discovery within the 
GUC (see section 10.2) at a 50 m flight line spacing with tie lines spaced at 500 m. The main flight lines for 



31 

 

Amended 

this grid were oriented at 045°, with tie lines running perpendicular at 135°. A total of 106 line-km were flown 
on this grid. The Grasset North and Grasset Gap grids were flown over areas where data was not obtained 
during the 2011 airborne survey, and consisted of traverse lines spaced at 100 m and perpendicular tie lines 
spaced at 1000 m (the same setup as the 2011 survey). The Grasset North grid traverse lines were flown at 
an orientation of 0° with a total flight path distance of 193.8 line-km; the Grasset Gap grid was oriented at 
30°, with a total flight path distance of 479.7 line-km (Venter et al., 2014).  

Magnetic trends on the Grasset North and Grasset Gap grids are consistent with those found in 
previous airborne surveys. Both grids display parallel curved linear total field magnetic highs which follow a 
pattern consistent with the regional scale folding of mafic members of the Manthet Group.  The conductive 
zone outlined at the northern end of the Grasset East grid is part of a larger conductive trend which continues 
onto the Grasset Gap grid, bending into an east-west orientation at its south end. This shape is consistent 
with the regional-scale folding interpreted from the magnetic data and, as such, this conductor may simply be 
a relatively conductive horizon within the stratigraphy. Similarly, several conductivity highs are present on the 
Grasset North grid which align with the strike of coincident magnetic anomalies and regional stratigraphy. 
While these conductivity highs should not be discounted entirely as targets for mineral exploration, any work 
must take into account the possibility that these zones are simply more conductive lithologies within the 
stratigraphy of the Manthet Group.  

The Nickel Test grid comprises a more detailed survey over the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery. The 
survey successfully identified the mineralized zone as both a magnetic and EM high, demonstrating that this 
type of mineralization is detectable with Geotech's VTEMplus system, though the possibility of false positives 
(i.e., magnetic and EM highs not produced by Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization) cannot be discounted.   

9.2 Ground-based Horizontal Loop Electro-Magnetic Geophysics 
Balmoral conducted one small (3.75 line-km) ground-based HLEM and magnetic survey on the 

Grasset property in late summer 2013. Work was conducted by Abitibi Geophysics of Val d'Or, Quebec and 
consisted of three 1.25 km long survey lines spaced at 400 m, over top of the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery 
(Figure 12). The survey detected a weak magnetic field increase over the discovery, but did not generate any 
meaningful EM data. The reason for the lack of usable EM data is not entirely clear – however, given the 
small scale of the survey this result is not considered to have a material impact on the mineral potential of the 
property.

9.3 Ground-based Induced Polarization Geophysics 
Ground-based induced polarization and resistivity surveys (IP) with accompanying magnetometer 

surveys were conducted on the Grasset property during the summer 2013 and winter 2014 exploration 
programs. Work was contracted to Scott Geophysics Ltd of Vancouver, BC. The 2013 survey was conducted 
over the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery, following up on promising drill results from the 2012 exploration 
program. The 2014 survey consisted of a small addition to the 2013 grid and a separate survey on the 
eastern part of the property near Lac Grasset, covering an area identified by the 2011 airborne survey as 
hosting both magnetic and EM anomalies (see Table 3 and Figure 12 for details).  

The 2013 survey consisted of a total of 18.8 line-km of IP and magnetometer survey along survey 
lines oriented at 30°, with perpendicular tie lines at 120°. The main survey lines were 1.3 km long and spaced 
100 m apart. Readings were taken at 75 m intervals, with an "a" spacing of 75 m and "n" separations of 1-12. 
Magnetometer readings were taken at 12.5 m intervals. The results of the survey show a large chargeability 
high at depth over much of the survey grid with an accompanying magnetic high trending roughly east-west 
(Figure 13). This is the geophysical signature which would be expected from a Ni-Cu-PGE magmatic sulphide 
deposit, and as such the results of the survey were judged to be promising enough to warrant follow-up 
drilling. Results of the 2014 drilling program at this location are presented in Section 10.

Amended 

The 2014 survey on the edge of Lac Grasset consisted of 53.15 line-km of IP and 53.9 line-km of 
magnetometer readings. Survey lines were oriented north-south, and were of variable lengths and spacing 
(Figure 12). Magnetic readings were taken every 12.5 m. IP readings were taken at an "a" spacing of 50 m 
and an "n" separation of 1-10. Several chargeability anomalies of potential interest were identified by this 
survey. A well defined east-west trending chargeability high is present along the southern margin of the grid, 
and has been interpreted by Balmoral to be a potential sulphide-rich horizon. A more diffuse chargeability 
high coinciding with a resistivity high on the northern section of the grid is suggestive of orogenic gold 
mineralization (chargeable sulphide minerals hosted within a resistive zone of silicification). Five holes were 
drilled in the area as part of the 2014 drilling campaign, the results of which are described in Section 10.4. 
The third interesting zone identified by the 2014 IP survey is a chargeability and resistivity high in the far 
southeast of the grid. One drill hole tested this anomaly in 2014 and did not identify any significant 
mineralization. In addition to the main survey area, two smaller IP grids were surveyed in 2014; a small, 1.8 
line-km grid to the south of Lac Grasset ("Small Cluster Target" on Figure 12a) and an additional 1.875 line-
km on the Grasset Nickel grid from 2013. Neither of these smaller surveys produced results of sufficient 
significance to alter the interpretations and planning derived from the larger surveys.  

9.4 Bore Hole Electro-Magnetic Geophysics 
Concurrent with the winter 2014 drilling program (February – April 2014), Balmoral contracted Crone 

Geophysics and Exploration Ltd to perform surface and borehole pulse EM surveys on the Grasset Ni-Cu-
PGE discovery. Nine drill hole surveys were completed for a total downhole survey length of 1675 m with a 
total of 22.3 km of surface EM surveys conducted on the areas surrounding the drill holes (Figure 12b). 
Following completion of the winter 2014 exploration program, a separate interpretation report on the 
downhole geophysical data was produced by Sharon Taylor (Taylor, 2014). The bulk of the following 
interpretation summary is taken from that report. 

The surface EM survey defined two sub-vertical conductors with significant depth extent, both of 
which received drill testing in the summer of 2014. The smaller of the two conductors lies 100 m northwest of 
the discovery hole GR-12-09 and was tested with holes GR-14-35 and GR-14-38. GR-14-35 did not intersect 
any significant mineralization; GR-14-38 intersected several zones of weak Ni-Cu-PGE enrichment. The 
larger of the two identified surface targets coincides roughly with the main body (northwest end) of Horizon 1 
and was the target of several well-mineralized drill holes during the summer 2014 program. See Table 5 in 
section 10.2 for details. Despite these moderately mineralized intercepts, it is interpreted that the surface EM 
response is from graphitic rocks and pyrite horizons in the footwall to Horizon 1, as opposed to mineralization 
within the horizon itself.  

The downhole EM surveys were successful in locating known massive and net-textured sulphides, 
showing that the method is appropriate for detection of mineralization at the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE zone. 
Numerous additional off-hole anomalies were also identified, suggesting that additional mineralized zones 
may be present and offer promising drill targets (Taylor, 2014).  

9.5 Soil Geochemistry 
Balmoral conducted two soil sampling programs on the Grasset property (Table 3), the first in the fall 

of 2012 followed by a second campaign in spring 2013. Both programs were conducted by Equity personnel 
under the field supervision of Equity. Sample sites were widely spread over the entire Grasset property, often 
consisting of a single line (Figures 14, 15). 

A total of 574 samples (including blanks and duplicates) were collected; 225 during the fall 2012 
program and 349 during the spring 2013 program.  526 samples were collected from the upper zone of 
mineral soil (generally buried under relatively thick organic cover) and submitted for MMI (Mobile Metal Ion, 
MMI-M5 method code) analysis by SGS Minerals in Toronto. In instances where it was not possible to reach 
mineral soil (45 field samples, with 2 accompanying blanks), a sample of the organic material from ~2 m 
below surface was collected and submitted to ACME labs in Vancouver for ICP analysis with an aqua regia 
digest (analysis code 1F15). The results of both the 2012 (Perk et al., 2012b) and 2013 (Perk et al., 2013)

programs have been previously reported on by Equity and much of the discussion in this section is based on 
those reports.  

QA/QC analysis by Equity of the blank samples and duplicate pairs (described in the assessment 
reports referenced above) shows that during both the 2012 and 2013 programs there was no evidence of 
tampering with samples prior to analysis, that blank samples returned values within tolerance for relevant 
elements and that analytical precision of duplicate pairs was acceptable. 

The organic and mineral soil samples were analysed by very different methods on different substrate, 
and as such their results are not directly comparable. The small number of samples and geographic 
scattering of the organic samples makes this a much less robust dataset than the one for mineral soil 
analysed via MMI, and as such data interpretation has focussed on the latter sample type. A full description 
of the soil geochemical characteristics of the Grasset property is beyond the scope of this report; however a 
brief analysis of the MMI data reveals several salient points.  

Values for precious metals (gold, platinum and palladium) are all too low to be of practical exploration 
use. All platinum results and the majority of palladium values are below detection. The maximum reported 
gold value was 8 ppb, with the vast majority below 3 ppb. No usable trends can be extrapolated from such a 
data set.  

Nickel and copper values, however, are far enough above detection to have the potential of providing 
meaningful trends, and should be good indicators of Ni-Cu-PGE mineralisation. Statistical analysis shows two 
distinct normally distributed data population for Cu values, with a break at ~1.5 ppm (Figure 16). A response 
ratio relative to a background value of 1.5 ppm is therefore used to identify anomalies, as opposed to direct 
percentile plot or absolute value plot. The trend for Ni is much less pronounced, but a change in slope on the 
probability plot  can be found at ~0.15 ppm and is here used to calculate and plot nickel response ratios. 

The three soil lines over the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery can be regarded, in effect, as an 
orientation survey over an established zone of significant mineralization (Figures 14 and 15). Despite the 
presence of good Ni mineralization in the rocks underlying this grid, there is only a very weak nickel response 
on the relevant lines. Cu shows a slightly better response, though there are still multiple soil samples with a 
Cu response ratio <1 (i.e., not statistically elevated above background) over the known mineralization. It 
therefore appears that soil sampling with analysis via MMI is an ineffective method for identifying a nickel or 
copper signature from Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization on the Grasset Property.  

Despite this apparent lack of response from the Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, the Cu-in-soil data does 
show several interesting trends. Soil lines on the eastern part of the property show a good correlation 
between chargability/magnetic highs (as identified by the airborne VTEM survey described in section 9.1) and 
Cu response ratios >5. The significance of this result is uncertain, but is marked enough to warrant follow up 
investigation and analysis.

10.0 DRILLING 
Balmoral has drilled 23933.2 m of core on the Grasset Property since staking it in November 2010. 

Drilling was conducted through five separate campaigns in the spring and fall of 2011; winter of 2012; and the 
winter and summer-fall of 2014 (Table 4). Procedural details of these programs are summarized below 
followed by an overview of drilling results from the two most significant prospects (Grasset Ultramafic 
Complex and Sunday Lake Deformation Zone) as well as those obtained from wildcat holes across the 
Property. Appendix C lists collar location, orientation and length for all holes on the Property. 

10.1 Drilling totals and procedures 
In 2011, diamond drilling started with a single NQ hole in the spring (GR-11-01) followed by four NQ 

holes in the fall (GR-11-02 to -05) (Table 4), the latter following up on a property-wide airborne magnetic and 
EM survey (Fiset et al., 2011b). All five of these holes were collared within ~130 m of each other and targeted 
gold mineralization along the sheared contact between the Manthet and Matagami domains. Landdrill 
International Ltd. of Moncton, New Brunswick, carried out the drilling under the management of Caracle 
Creek International Consulting Inc. of Sudbury, Ontario (Wagner, 2012).

The 2011 programs were followed by a single drill campaign in the winter of 2012, which totalled 1899 
m of drilling in 7 NQ holes. The first four of these holes (GR-12-06 to -09) were drilled along 1.2 km of strike 
length on the sheared Manthet-Matagami contact with the remaining three holes (GR-12-13 to -15) testing a 
coincident EM-magnetic anomaly in the western-most part of the Property. Holes GR-12-10 through -12 were 
drilled just off the Grasset Property on the adjacent Fenelon Property, and are therefore not further discussed 
in this technical report. Drilling was managed by Equity and conducted by George Downing Estate Drilling 
Ltd. of Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Québec.  

A nickel-PGE discovery made as part of the 2012 program (Perk et al., 2012a) was followed up in the 
winter of 2014, following additional geophysical and soil sampling surveys that were completed in 2013. The 
Winter 2014 drill program comprised 11 NQ holes for a total of 3633.6 m (Table 5), of which nine (GR-14-16 
to -20, GR-14-22 to -25) were drilled into the newly discovered Grasset Ultramafic Complex (GUC), one was 
targeted at the sheared contact between the Matagami and Manthet domains (GR-14-21) and a wildcat hole 
(GRX-14-01) was drilled on a coincident EM-magnetic anomaly in the northwestern corner of the Property. 
The Winter 2014 program was successful in delineating at least three Ni-Cu-PGE mineralized horizons in the 
GUC, and was consequently followed up with a 51 hole NQ drill program, totalling 16672.6 m, in the summer 
and fall of 2014. This Summer-Fall 2014 program was mostly focused on the Ni-bearing horizons of the GUC 
(GR-14-26 to -68), with minor amounts of wildcat drilling on magnetic anomalies in the eastern part of the 
property (GRX-14-02 to -07) and at the northeast edge of the GUC (GRX-14-08). All of the 2014 drilling was 
managed by Balmoral and conducted by Norex Drilling Ltd. of Porcupine, Ontario.  

All of the Balmoral drill holes were surveyed with either a FlexIT (16.4% of holes) or Reflex EZ-Shot™ 
(83.6% holes), and most of the 2014 holes were surveyed with a Reflex Gyro as well (85.2% of 2014 holes). 
The strongly magnetic character of the ultramafic rocks necessitated the frequent use of the Gyro survey tool 



43 

 

Amended 

in 2014. FlexIT and EZ-Shot™ surveys were predominantly completed at 50 m (75.3%) or 30 m (24.7%) 
intervals, with the 50 m interval typically used for holes that were followed up with Gyro surveys or that were 
more wildcat in nature. Gyro surveys were performed at 5 m intervals.  

All of the collar locations were initially spotted with a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS), 
which typically has a horizontal accuracy of ±5 m. The collar locations for holes drilled on the GUC were 
subsequently surveyed with a Total Station GPS (TSGPS) system that established the location of each collar 
casing with horizontal accuracy of ±0.03 m and vertical accuracy of ±0.05 m (1σ). The trend and plunge of 
casings was determined with a Reflex North Finder Azimuth Pointing System (APS). The TSGPS survey was 
completed by Patrick Descarreaux Quebec Land Surveyor Inc. of La Sarre, Quebec.  

Vertical depth of overburden in the 2011-2014 Balmoral drill holes ranges widely across the property, 
from a low of 8.6 m to a maximum of 108.8 m. The overburden covering the Grasset Ultramafic Complex is 
particularly thick, averaging 80.7 m of vertical thickness with a standard deviation (1σ) of 7.1 m. Drilling 
suggests that this overburden gets even thicker to the south, where it averages 86.6 ± 12.2 m (1σ) over top of 
the sheared Matagami-Manthet contact zone, and thinner to the north, where it averages 68.2 ± 7.7 m over 
five exploration holes. In the eastern part of the property, true overburden widths are significantly thinner than 
over the GUC, averaging 16.5 ± 6.8 m (1σ).    

Core recovery averaged ~99% for all holes drilled on the Grasset Property, with slightly higher 
recovery on the wildcat holes (99.4%) relative to those drilled on the GUC (99.0%) and the sheared contact 
between the Manthet and Matagami domains (98.0%). Rock quality designation (RQD), which is a 
measurement of rock competency, averaged 75% for all of the holes drilled on the Property. The wildcat 
holes showed the highest average RQD at 83.8%, followed by the holes drilled on the GUC (74.0%) and, 
lastly, those drilled on the Manthet-Matagami contact zone (70.5%). 

Drill core processing consisted of both geotechnical and then geological logging, after which the 
samples were marked out and the core was moistened and photographed. Geotechnical logging included 
measurement of core recovery, RQD, magnetic susceptibility and, for selected holes in 2014, specific gravity. 
Core recovery, RQD and magnetic susceptibility were recorded at 3 m intervals whereas specific gravity was 
measured at variable intervals, possibly to target specific rock types.  

The author believes that there were no drilling, sampling, or recovery factors reported from any of the 
five drill campaigns conducted in 2011, 2012 and 2014 that could materially impact the accuracy and 
reliability of the results. 

10.2 Ni-Cu-PGE horizons in the Grasset Ultramafic Complex 
Following the initial intersection of nickel-bearing sulphides in drill hole GR-12-09, it became apparent 

that significant potential existed on the Grasset property for ultramafic hosted Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization (see 
section 8.1 for a description of this deposit type) and the majority of the 2014 drill campaign focused on 
expanding and developing this prospect. A total of 53 holes with an aggregate length of 17700 m have been 
drilled into the GUC to date (Table 4), with the majority of holes intersecting at least minor Ni-Cu-PGE 
mineralization.  

As discussed in section 7.4.1, three discrete mineralized horizons exist within the GUC. Horizon 1 
was the first zone discovered and has been intersected over the largest strike length, but Horizon 3 is at 
present the focus of exploration as it contains a better combination of grade and width (i.e. grade thickness). 
Table 5 shows composite Ni, Cu and PGE values for all intersections with a grade thickness greater than 
10% Ni-meters (i.e., > 100,000 gram-meters Ni). As a result of this reporting threshold, there are numerous 
intersections with appreciable mineralization from Horizons 1 and 2 that are not tabulated. This is a reflection 
of the lower grades and/or thinner widths within these horizons relative to Horizon 3, not of their geological 
significance.

Values of nickel, copper and PGEs are strongly related, with an almost linear relationship between 
them. As such, it is appropriate to focus discussions of grade on nickel values, and from that point extrapolate 
to copper and PGE values. An analysis of the values presented in Table 5 shows that copper values within 
the GUC are ~12% of the nickel grade, with ΣPGE2 (Pt+Pd) totaling ~0.75 g/t for each percent nickel (Figure 
17). The ratio of Pt:Pd can vary between samples but on average is ~1:2. As would be expected from the Ni-
Cu-PGE deposit model, the composites listed in Table 5 show much less internal variability (i.e. fewer short 
intervals of extremely high-grade material contained within a larger moderately well mineralized zone) than

commonly associated with more "nuggety" deposit types such as orogenic gold. However, it is not uncommon 
for relatively short (1 – 10 m) intervals of core exceeding 2% Ni to be contained within larger (~50 m) intervals 
of sub-1% Ni material. Nickel values in excess of 5% are rare and generally restricted to <1 m in-core 
thickness. These higher-than-average nickel grades are generally associated with massive sulphide intervals. 

It is important to note that the higher metal content of Horizon 3 relative to the other two zones does 
not guarantee that similar metal content will be present in any additional intersections of that zone, or 
conversely that future drilling of Horizons 1 and 2 will not discover zones of higher sulphide concentration. 
The larger number of good intersections in Horizon 3 is also likely representative of the fact that this zone has 
received the majority of the drilling, with only 17 (of the total 53) holes drilling through Horizon 1 and even 
less (6 of 53) drilling through Horizon 2. The concentration of work on Horizon 3 was justified due to the 
superior grades of this zone, but nevertheless contributes to a sampling bias which results in an under-
reporting of results from the other two horizons.  

All three of the mineralized horizons are subvertical tabular bodies striking generally southeast with an 
estimated true thickness of 25 – 50 m. All holes were drilled at azimuths generally perpendicular to this strike 
(towards the northeast) with dips ranging from -50° to -70°. The true thicknesses of the mineralized intercepts 
are correspondingly variable, but can be estimated to be ~40 - 60% of the in-core thickness.  

The 2014 drilling successfully defined a significant zone of Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization associated with 
three discrete horizons within the GUC. The presence of massive, semi-massive and net-textured pyrrhotite, 
pentlandite, pyrite and chalcopyrite in these horizons has been shown to exist over several hundred meters 
strike length and vertical extent, with the zones open at depth and along strike. Property-scale geophysical 
surveys suggest the potential for the GUC to extend several kilometers beyond its current known extent, and 
as such there is potential to discover further mineralization of this style on the property.

10.3 Grasset orogenic gold targets 
As described in section 7, the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone (SLDZ) runs across the Grasset 

property. This is the same structural feature which is associated with orogenic gold mineralization elsewhere 
in the region (e.g., the Detour Mine in Ontario) making it a prime exploration target. Much of the historic 
drilling prior to Balmoral's acquisition of the Grasset property was targeted at geophysical anomalies believed 
to be good candidates for this style of mineralization. None of these holes intersected significant gold values 
(Perk et al., 2012a). 

Subsequent to Balmoral's acquisition of the Property, ten holes with a total length of 3504.6 m were 
drilled into orogenic gold targets (Table 4). Initial drill targeting was based on geophysical anomalies detected 
by airborne surveys, with later holes following up on targets defined by earlier drilling. Of these ten holes, 
eight were drilled into a single target zone discovered in the first hole of the 2011 program (GR-11-01) with 
the remaining two drilled as step-outs several hundred metres to the east along what was believed to be the 
mineralized trend (Figure 7). The holes directly surrounding GR-11-01 all drilled through a thick (75 – 100 m) 
overburden layer before intersecting a zone of sheared clastic sedimentary rocks (conglomerate, argillite and 
wacke) followed by mafic volcanic. Two of these holes (GR-14-21 and GR-12-07) also intersected ultramafic 
rock that may be part of the Grasset Ultramafic Complex. The two holes drilled further east (GR-12-09 and 
GR-12-08) both intersected a similar rock package of mafic volcanic rocks, metasedimentary rocks and 
ultramafic units. GR-12-09 is especially significant as it is the discovery hole for the Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization 
found in the Grasset Ultramafic Complex, and is discussed in greater detail in section 10.2. 

Of the ten holes drilled in the main orogenic gold target, four returned at least one interval exceeding 
5 gram-metres of gold and are therefore considered to be of potential economic interest (Table 6). All other 
holes returned at least some weakly anomalous gold values but with grade thicknesses less than the 5 gram-
meter threshold reported in Table 6 below. Note that the thicknesses reported are core lengths and do not 
represent true thicknesses; this value is estimated to be ~50 – 75 % of core length. Composites in Table 6 
were calculated at a cut-off grade of 0.1 g/t Au  and with internal dilution of no more than three consecutive 
samples assaying <0.05 g/t Au.  

In the holes which returned significant gold values, mineralization is hosted within gold-bearing quartz-
carbonate veins and shear zones. This is similar to the mineralization style observed elsewhere in region, 
and is typical of orogenic gold in general. The mineralized intersections in the cluster of holes surrounding 
GR-11-01 define a sub-vertical mineralized zone with a strike of ~120-140°. This is also typical of 
mineralization in the region, where gold-bearing zones are concentrated in second or third order structures 
splayed off a larger regional feature (in this case, the east-west trending SLDZ).

Amended 

Overall, the results of the drill-testing orogenic gold targets on the Grasset property confirm that such 
mineralization is present, albeit over a relatively short confirmed strike length and with relatively low grade 
thicknesses. However, given the multi-kilometer long extent of the prospective horizon/structure ten drill holes 
is only a reconnaissance test of the orogenic gold potential of the property and so the possibility of future 
discoveries cannot be discounted.  

10.4 Other target results 
In addition to the gold and nickel targets described above, the Grasset property hosts an abundance 

of other, mostly untested, geophysical and geochemical anomalies. While the testing of these zones has not 
been the main focus of exploration work conducted by Balmoral, 11 holes with a total length of 2729 m have 
been drilled at targets outside of the Ni-Cu-PGE and orogenic gold discovery zones previously described.  

Holes GR-12-13, GR-12-14 and GR-12-15 tested for Cu-Zn VMS mineralization within a zone 
containing both an EM conductor and chargeability anomaly. Though these holes did intersect massive 
sulphide mineralization containing anomalous Cu (up to 563 ppm) and strongly altered ultramafic rocks 
containing anomalous Ni (up to 577 ppm), the results did not justify additional drilling. To date, no follow-up 
work has been conducted on this target.  

During the 2014 season an additional 8 exploration holes (distinguished in the drill database by the 
prefix "GRX" as opposed to "GR") were drilled at geophysical targets with the potential to host either orogenic 
gold, VMS or Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization. GRX-14-01 intercepted a short interval of intercalated semi-massive 
sulphide, mudstone and basalt with weakly anomalous Au and Zn over short (< 1 m) intervals (up to 0.1 g/t 
and 3610 ppm respectively) but did not receive any follow-up drilling. Six of the remaining seven drill holes 
(GRX-14-02 – GRX-14-07) were drilled near Lac Grasset on the eastern edge of the property, targeting an 
area of complex IP and chargeability anomalies. While several of the holes do contain minor mineralization 
(e.g. GRX-14-02 hosts isolated Au assays up to 0.5 g/t) none of the results are considered significant at this 
time. GRX-14-08 was collared 500 m northeast of the main drilling zone, targeted at a zone of complex EM 
and magnetic anomalies. The upper 150 m of the hole intersected anomalous (>1000 ppm) nickel associated 
with mafic and ultramafic rocks, but lacking in any massive or semi-massive sulphides.  

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

11.1 Core handling, sampling and security 
Core handling and security procedures were managed by Caracle Creek in 2011, by Equity in 2012 

and by Balmoral personnel in 2014. Similar procedures were used in each drilling campaign, with core 
samples first placed into routered wooden core trays at the drill site with the end of each drill run marked with 
a small wooden block displaying the total depth of the hole. The boxes were labelled with the hole and box 
number (e.g. GR-11-01 Bx 1), sealed with a lid, strapped with wire (2011) or fibre tape (2012, 2014) and then 
transported daily from the drill site to the core storage and logging facility. These boxes were labelled in 
permanent marker with the hole and box number (e.g. GR-11-01 Bx 1). The core was transported mostly via 
helicopter contracted from Expedition Helicopters Ltd of Cochrane, Ontario, but also by snowmobile and truck 
during the winter campaigns. Camp Fenelon functioned as the core storage and logging facility for all five 
campaigns  

Following geological and geotechnical logging, the core was sawn in half with an electric diamond-
bladed core saw, and one half of the core was placed back into the core tray. Field duplicates were collected 
as a quarter-core sample from the same interval as the half-core sample, leaving a quarter core in the box for 
reference. Core trays containing this remaining reference core were labelled with aluminum tags indicating 
the hole number and the core interval stored in each box, and are currently stored at Fenelon Mine and 
Camp Fenelon. The sampled portion of the core was placed into a clear polyethylene bag, along with a 
waterproof sample tag supplied by the analytical lab. The sample tag number was then written on the bag 
after which it was sealed with a cable tie. Up to 10 sealed sample bags were then placed in labeled rice bags, 
along with a request for analysis form, and then closed with a plastic seal. Samples from individual holes 



50 

 

Amended 

were sent to the laboratory as separate batches, or shipments, in order to optimally track and minimize 
possible handling and/or sample preparation errors. Prior to shipment to the laboratory, each sample bag was 
checked to verify it was numbered properly and sealed. Samples were then transported to ALS Minerals 
Limited ("ALS") in Val d'Or, Québec by Balmoral personnel (2011, 2012, 2014), by Equity personnel (2012), 
or by a contracted expeditor provided by Outland Camps of Amos, Québec (2012, 2014). Upon arrival in Val 
d'Or an ALS employee would sign the request for analysis form to verify that the full shipment had been 
delivered.   

Samples were collected from all mineralized zones intersected in drilling and from their immediate 
hanging walls and footwalls. A total of 1061 samples were collected from 2011 drill core (Table 7), with an 
average sample length of 1.13 ± 0.34 m (1σ) and a range of 0.25-2.50 m. The cumulative length of all core 
samples (1073.2 m) comprises 89% of the bedrock that was drilled (total drilled in 2011 minus 533.8 m of 
overburden). An additional 108 QA/QC samples were inserted into the 2011 sample stream, comprising 51 
standards, 54 blanks and 3 duplicates (Peshkepia and Silvester, 2011). In 2012, 936 core samples were 
collected in addition to 176 samples for QA/QC. The core samples from this program averaged 1.04 ± 0.31 m 
(1σ) in length and ranged from 0.30-2.35 m. The cumulate core length (968.77 m) comprises 78% of cored 
bedrock (total drilled in 2012 minus 651.4 m of overburden). The QA/QC samples collected in 2012 included 
62 standards, 58 blanks and 65 duplicates. The 2014 drill programs saw the collection of 9246 core samples 
and an additional 1647 samples for QA/QC. Average core sample length was 1.09 ± 0.29 m (1σ) with a range 
of 0.29-3.57 m, similar to the previous programs. The cumulate length of all core samples (10037.84 m) 
comprises 68% of the drilled bedrock (total drilled in 2014 minus 5585.2 m of overburden). The 1647 QA/QC 
samples consist of 551 standards, 554 blanks and 542 duplicates.

11.2 Analytical techniques 
All 2011, 2012 and 2014 core samples from Grasset were prepared and analysed by ALS Minerals. 

Samples were prepared and analyzed for gold at ALS's analytical facility in Val d'Or, Québec. This facility is 
individually certified to standards within ISO 9001:2008 and has received accreditation to ISO/IEC 
17025:2005 from the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for the following methods: 

 Determination of Au by Lead Collection Fire Assay and Atomic Absorption (AA) Spectrometry 
 Determination of Au by Lead Collection Fire Assay and Gravimetric Finish 

The ALS facility in Val d'Or is limited to sample preparation and gold analysis. In order to analyze for 
all other elements the prepared pulps were shipped to ALS's facility in North Vancouver, BC. This facility has 
been found by the Standards Council of Canada to conform with the requirements for ISO/IEC 17025:2005 
for a wide variety of geochemical procedures, including but not limited to: 

 Determination of Au by Lead Collection Fire Assay and Atomic Absorption (AA) Spectrometry 
 Determination of Au by Lead Collection Fire Assay and Gravimetric Finish 
 Multi-element (including Ni and Cu) determination by 4-acid digestion and ICP-AES 
 Determination of Au, Pt and Pd by Lead Collection Fire Assay and ICP-AES 
 Determination of Ni and Cu by sodium peroxide fusion and ICP-AES 

  



51 

 

Amended 

Sample preparation and analysis procedures include the following steps: 

 Samples were weighed, dried and crushed to material with a minimum of 70% measuring <2 
mm; 

 Crushed samples were mechanically split, with a riffle splitter, to provide a 1000 g 
representative sample; 

 1000 g samples were then pulverized to a minimum of 85% passing <75 μm material; 
 30 g of the pulverized samples were fire assayed for gold with an atomic absorption finish 

(ALS code Au-AA23); 
 For samples whose initial fire assay exceeded 5 g/t Au, another 30 g of the pulverized 

samples were then fire assayed for gold with gravimetric finish (ALS code Au-GRA21); 
 For samples whose Au-GRA21 fire assay exceeded 10 g/t Au, screen metallics fire assaying 

was carried out on a 1000 g pulverized sample (ALS code Au-SCR21); 
 Selected samples were analyzed for 33 other elements using ICP-AES methods and a four 

acid digestion (ALS code ME-ICP61); 
 Samples which contained nickel values greater than the detection limit of the ME-ICP61 

method were analyzed via the Ni-ICP81 method; 
 Samples which contained copper values greater than the detection limit of the ME-ICP61 

method were analyzed via the Cu-ICP81 method; 
 Selected samples were analyzed for Au, Pt and Pd via the PGM-ICP23 method. 

11.3 Analytical Quality Assurance / Quality Control 
Over the course of the 2011, 2012 and 2014 drilling programs, a total of 681 standards, 681 field 

blanks, 307 field duplicates and 310 preparation duplicates were inserted into the analytical sample stream to 
estimate accuracy and precision and to detect sample contamination during sample preparation and analysis. 
Every 10th sample in the sample sequence was alternately either a blank or a low, medium or high grade 
gold or multi-element standard depending on the nature of mineralization sampled. Additional blanks and 
standards were inserted for the 2011 drill program. In 2011, only one core (field) duplicate and one 
preparation duplicate were included with each hole/shipment whereas procedures established for the 2012 
and 2014 programs required that every 20th sample was alternately either a core or preparation duplicate. 
The core duplicate, a one-quarter split, was collected at the same time as the original sample using the same 
procedure and given a separate sample number. For preparation duplicates, the analytical lab was requested 
to prepare a second pulp from a selected sample's crushed reject material and mark it with a separate 
predetermined sample number. An empty sample bag with sample tag was provided to the analytical lab.  

For the majority of drilling, quartz chips purchased from ALS in Val d'Or were used as blanks. For the 
latter part of the 2014 drilling, tonalite purchased for use as blank material from the lab was used in place of 
quartz. In total, 521 quartz blanks and 160 tonalite blanks were inserted.  

Thirteen different certified reference materials (CRM) were used as analytical standards over the 
2011, 2012 and 2014 programs (Table 8) of which nine were gold-only and four were multi-element. Multi-
element standards were not extensively used before the discovery of Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, with the 
primary element of interest before that being gold. All standards were obtained from CDN Resource 
Laboratories in Vancouver, BC. 

Blank and standard results were monitored during the 2011 program, but it is not known what 
corrective action, if any, was taken to deal with results outside acceptable tolerances. For the 2012 and 2014 
programs, results from blank, standard and duplicate analyses were monitored on an ongoing basis by Gary 
Lustig of G.N. Lustig Consulting Ltd., who provided recommendations on corrective action when it was 
determined that QA/QC failures had occurred. For the 2012 program this monitoring was done on Au values 
alone; the suite of monitored elements was expanded in 2014 to also include Pt, Pd, Ni and Cu. 

A standard failure was considered to be an instance where several standards in a row exceeded the 
2σ "warning" limit or a single value exceeded the 3σ "control" limit, where σ is the standard deviation of the 
CRM as reported in the certification document (Figures 18, 19). The warning level for blank samples was set 



52 

 

Amended 

at 5x the detection limit for the analysis method used (i.e. ≥25 ppb Au, Pt or Pd and ≥0.005% for Ni or Cu), 
and any blank sample which returned a value higher than this was investigated. Generally, if failures were 
found in intervals where there was no mineralization of potential economic significance no re-analyses were 
done as the results would not have a material impact on any future drilling or resource estimates. If failures 
were found in intervals of significant mineralization, corrective action (generally re-assays of the affected 
sample run) was taken before the geochemical data was finalized.  

Comparisons of field and preparation duplicates were conducted on an ongoing basis throughout the 
2012 and 2014 program (Figure 20) to ensure there were no systematic sampling or sample preparation 
errors.  

At the conclusion of the 2012 program, 30 selected pulps were sent to Techni-Lab S.G.B. in Abitibi, 
QC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Activation Laboratories) for external check analysis for gold. Comparison of 
the re-assay Au results with original values from ALS show that the mean values of the external check 
assays were 12.6% higher than the originals when comparing means and 22.7% lower when comparing 
medians (Lustig, 2012). This spread is likely due in large part to the low absolute values (mean and median 
values are less than 0.1 g/t Au), and thus relatively low precision, of the assays in question.   

Overall, Lustig (2012) concluded the following with respect to the 2012 Grasset program: "The quality 
control and check assays completed confirm that the 2012 Grasset gold assay data is accurate, precise and 
free of contamination to industry standards and is of sufficient quality to be used in resource estimation" 

A similar set of check assays were performed following the 2014 program, with similar results. A set of 
50 samples were sent to SGS Mineral Services in Vancouver for Au, Pt, Pd, Ni and Cu analysis. Comparison 
of Pt, Pd, Cu and Ni results show no more than 2% variation in either median or mean assay values between 
ALS and SGS. Au results show a negative bias in the ALS values, with the median of ALS results 7.3% lower 
than SGS, and the mean 12.7% lower. However, as gold values were generally quite low, this does not 
represent a large absolute error (2 ppb and 6 ppb for median and mean values, respectively) and is judged to 
be an acceptable level of variation.  

Similarly to as with the 2012 program Lustig (2015) concluded the following with respect to the 2014 
Grasset assay program: "The quality control and check assays completed confirm that the winter and 
summer 2014 Grasset assay data are accurate, precise and free of contamination to industry standards and 
of sufficient quality to be used in resource estimation." 

It is the opinion of the author that sample preparation, sample security, analytical procedures and 
QA/QC monitoring during the 2012 and 2014 programs were adequate, and that the results of the 
geochemical analysis can be considered reliable. The author does not have sufficient information to 
determine whether the same is true for the 2011 program, though the author is not aware of inadequate 
sample security or improper sample preparation during that program.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
The author examined the Grasset property on February 3-5, 2015and performed a number of checks 

to verify the data provided by Balmoral: 

 he located 14 drill collars (GR-14-18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 46, 47, 57, 59) in the field and 
compared the coordinates he obtained from a hand-held GPS with those in the drill database; 

 he compared descriptions in the drill logs from six holes (GR-14-25, 37, 51, 54, 57, 63) with the 
corresponding core; 

 he collected ten duplicate core samples by quartering mineralized core intervals from five holes and 
compared the sample results to those in the Balmoral database; 

 he compared assays from five randomly-selected assay certificates against the values in the drill 
database; 

 he calculated weighted averages for five randomly-selected intervals for comparison against those 
prepared by Balmoral and summarized in this report.  

The results of these verification checks were: 

 the coordinates of the 14 drill collars given by the hand-held GPS matched those in the database to 
within 7metres, the limit of handheld GPS accuracy; 

 core lithologies, alteration and mineralization matched drill log descriptions for the examined holes 
very well, and sample intervals/numbers matched those in the drill database; 

 results of the ten re-sampled intervals are compared in (Table 9) below with analytical results from the 
original sampling. The most notable differences in assay values are from the  better-mineralized 
samples and is likely to natural variance in the abundance of base metal sulphide. There does not 
seem to be a systematic high or low bias in the re-sample analyses versus originally reported 
analyses; 

 where checked, analytical values from the assay certificates were correctly recorded in the drill 
database; 

 weighted averages calculated by the author matched those prepared and reported by Balmoral. 

The author believes that the data is adequate for the purposes of this technical report.

17.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Since staking the initial Grasset claims in 2010, Balmoral has successfully advanced the project from 

what was essentially a series of "greenfields" exploration targets (i.e., no significant drill results) to a stage 
where there are multiple types and zones of mineralization with the potential to develop into economically 
viable deposits. Shear-zone hosted orogenic gold mineralization occurs in the region (e.g., the Detour Lake 
mine), and was the target of early work by Balmoral. Drilling during the 2011 and 2012 seasons intersected 
several zones of shearing and veining containing promising, though not exceptional, gold values. Of much 
greater significance was the discovery of a series of sulphide-rich horizons within a package of ultramafic 
rocks (the Grasset Ultramafic Complex) that host significant amounts of nickel, copper and platinum group 
elements. This magmatic sulphide Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization has been the focus of exploration since its 
discovery, and will likely be for the immediate future.   

The author does not believe that there are any significant risks or uncertainties affecting the reliability 
or confidence in the exploration information on the Grasset property. As no estimates regarding mineral 
resources, mineral reserves or economic outcomes have been made, no statement regarding their 
associated risks or uncertainties can be made.  

17.1 Grasset Ultramafic Complex 
Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization is present in sub-vertical, ~25 – 50 m thick, sulphide-rich horizons within 

the Grasset Ultramafic Complex. Of the three defined horizons (Figure 8), the middle one (horizon 2) is the 
least significant, with no economically viable intersections and a limited spatial extent. Horizon 1 was the site 
of the initial discovery (GR-12-09) and has the largest defined spatial extent of the three, extending for nearly 
1 km of strike length. While it does host significant Ni-Cu-PGE grades in zones of massive and semi-massive 
sulphide (pyrrhotite ± pentlandite, pyrite and chalcopyrite), the thickness of intersections and grade within 
horizon 1 are lower than in horizon 3. Horizon 3 has received the majority of drill testing, and in turn has 
returned the majority of economically significant results, with assays commonly returning values in excess of 
1% Ni, 0.1% Cu and 1 g/t Pt+Pd over tens of meters of core thickness. Drilling up to the end of the 2014 
season defined this mineralization over ~400 m of strike length and to a vertical depth of 350 m; however the 
zone is open at both ends and to depth, as such the author believes that there is a possibility that future 
drilling will increase its strike length and vertical extent.  

The discovery of the GUC and Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization within it opens up significant exploration 
potential on the entire Grasset property. Breakdown of olivine in ultramafic rocks produces serpentine and 
magnetite, making magnetic field strength a good indicator of the presence of ultramafic host rocks. Massive 
sulphide bodies could be identified with EM and IP geophysical surveys whereas net-textured or 
disseminated sulphide may be identified with IP. The results of airborne geophysical surveys suggests that 
the Grasset Ultramafic Complex may extend well beyond its presently known extent, although drilling is 
required to confirm this. Linear magnetic and conductivity highs that occur northwest of the drilled area 
comprise additional exploration targets, as these geophysical signatures could indicate ultramafic rocks with,

Amended 

or without, ,magmatic Ni-sulphide. More work would be required to determine if these units are the equivalent 
to those which host the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE discovery. As such, the author believes that significantly more 
drill testing of geophysical anomalies is justified throughout the Grasset Property. 

17.2 Grasset orogenic gold targets 
Orogenic (shear-hosted) gold mineralization is found on the Grasset property in close spatial 

association with the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, and is most likely related to secondary structures that 
splay off this regional-scale feature. Though individual samples from these gold-bearing structures can return 
high-grade gold values (>10 g/t Au), the intersections are generally narrow (<1 m) and diluted by halos of 
low-grade or barren material. As such, based on current information, gold mineralization on the Grasset 
property is not considered to be a material factor in the evaluation of the overall potential of the property.  

Despite this lack of well-defined zones, the gold potential of the area cannot be fully discounted. A 
large amount of area obscured by thick overburden proximal to the SLDZ has received no exploration work, 
and the minor gold hits intersected to date show that a gold-bearing system occurs in the area. It is the nature 
of such systems to be inhomogeneous, and it has been shown elsewhere along the SLDZ that the orogenic 
systems associated with this deformation zone have the potential to carry large amounts of gold. Though 
there are currently no exceptionally compelling gold targets on the Grasset property, there is potential for new 
orogenic discoveries while exploring for Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, and such exploration should take into 
account that any shears or veins encountered could be gold-bearing. 

17.3 Summary 
In summary, the author believes that continued Ni-Cu-PGE exploration, and to a lesser extent, 

orogenic gold exploration, is fully warranted on the Grasset property, given:  

 Horizons 1 and 3 both contain significant Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization, and are open in all 
directions. 

 Regional geophysical surveys suggest that ultramafic units (and therefore potential for 
additional Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization) are present for over a kilometer along strike from the 
current area of drilling. 

 Significant orogenic gold deposits have been defined further west along the SLDZ and 
scattered gold has been intersected on the Grasset property in association with the SLDZ. 

18.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

18.1 Scope of Program 
The author recommends an aggressive exploration program for the winter 2015 season consisting of: 

 10,000 m of diamond drilling, primarily for step-out and infill drilling on Horizon 3; 
 20 line-km of IP; 
 6 – 8 borehole EM surveys (~3,000 m) 
 Preliminary metallurgical testwork  

18.1.1 Diamond Drilling 
The recommended 10,000 m of drilling is based on what the author believes to be a justified amount 

of additional exploration on the GUC and what is reasonably achievable in a winter season at Grasset with 
two drills.  

Production averages from previous winter programs suggest that, taking into account winter weather 
conditions and the thick overburden at Grasset, it should be possible to achieve ~100 m/day/drill rig. Utilizing 
two rigs, the total of 10,000 m could be drilled in ~50 days. If the program is initiated early in 2015, this should 
allow sufficient time to complete the recommended program before the spring thaw begins. 



59 

 

Amended 

Of the total 10,000 m, the author recommends that 5,600 m be devoted to testing Horizon 3 at depth 
and along strike, 2,000 m used to conduct infill drilling in areas of Horizon 3 where drilling density is too low to 
establish mineralization continuity, and the remaining 2,400 m to explore geophysical targets along strike of 
the GUC. Such a program should be supported out of the Fenelon Camp, with access to skid-mounted drill 
rigs via truck and snowmobile.   

Table 10: Details of proposed winter 2015 drilling 

Sub-area 
Drilling 

# of holes Average Length (m) Total (m) 

Horizon 3 northwest extension 6 300 1800 

Horizon 3 southeast extension 5 400 2000 

Horizon 3 extension to depth 3 600 1800 

Horizon 3 infill 5 400 2000 

Additional geophysical targets 8 300 2400 

Total 27 370 10000 

 

It should be noted that the proposed holes in Table 10 do not constitute a detailed drill plan, and the 
lengths and number of holes assigned to each area will be dependent upon results as the program 
progresses. Considering that stipulation, the rationale behind the drilling breakdown is as follows. 

 Horizon 3 northwest extension: Mineralization is open at the northwest end of Horizon 3, 
and a set of relatively shallow (200-400 m) holes spaced at 50 – 100 m along the strike of the 
horizon should be drilled. These holes should continue to the northern contact of the GUC, so 
as to test for extensions to Horizon 1. 

 Horizon 3 southeast extension: The targeting rationale for this set of holes is essentially the 
same as for the northwest Horizon 3 extension. As there are already shallow intersections of 
Horizons 1 and 2 in this area, these holes should be targeted slightly deeper than the previous 
set so as to undercut the existing drilling while still providing effective tests of Horizon 3. 

 Horizon 3 extension to depth: 3 deep holes beneath the best zones of mineralization in 
Horizon 3 are recommended, spaced ~100 m apart horizontally to get good coverage along 
the best portion of  the  strike length of the zone, and to give initial indications of any plunge to 
the highest-grade portions of Horizon 3.  

 Horizon 3 infill: This set of moderate length holes is intended to infill areas where there are 
gaps of 50 m or more between pierce points through Horizon 3. Filling in these gaps will allow 
a more accurate assessment of the continuity of mineralization in the horizon. 

 Additional geophysical targets: These holes should be drilled later in the program to test 
targets developed by the recommended IP and BHEM surveys.  

18.1.2 Ground-based IP 
20 line-km of IP is recommended over a survey grid with 100 m line spacing and the same 

geophysical parameters as the 2013 survey over the Ni-Cu-PGE discovery area. This survey will cover the 
northwestern continuation of the magnetic anomaly corresponding to the GUC and Horizons 1-3 for 1,500 m 
to the property boundary. A continuation of the survey into the adjacent Fenelon claims (also owned by 
Balmoral) should be considered, but is not recommended in this report nor included in this report's budget as 
it involves work on a separate claim block.

18.1.3 Borehole EM 
Borehole EM surveys should be conducted on a set of holes on the outer margins of the current 

drilling in an attempt to detect additional conductors to target for drill testing. It is recommended that 2 – 3 
holes be surveyed on each of the northwestern, southeastern and bottom edges of Horizon 3 as it is currently 
known. The selection of holes (and thus total meterage) should be made in consultation with a geophysicist 
expert on borehole EM. However, for the purposes this report, it is assumed that the total aggregate survey 
length will be approximately 3,000 m. 

18.1.4 Metallurgical test work 
It is recommended that minor metallurgical test work be conducted during the 2015 exploration 

program. This work would be very preliminary in nature (only conducted on a few select samples) and will not 
provide a complete assessment of the processing required at any potential mine stage, but will simply 
determine the general metallurgical characteristics of the Grasset Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization. 

18.2 Proposed Budget 
A budget for the proposed exploration program is presented below in Table 11. All figures are in 

Canadian dollars. The recommended program will cost approximately C$2.05 million to complete.
